Speaker 1:          00:02:25       It is, it feels like fucking Christmas Eve Ryan. No, no female supervision for no 48 hours. Completely let loose on her own. And it's uh, it's just, it just feels like a holiday. But Ryan, we teased it in, uh, in the little NFL song, but freeload contest, the free roll football contest is back baby. Little different this year, right? A little different. Is it this year? Be Freer. Old football contest is being presented by odd shark. Check them out@oddshark.com

Speaker 4:          00:02:59       giving him a fall at odd shark. Ed e, sports gambling, podcasts network, home to inside Vegas as well as the college experience and EPL show. Now what do you do to sign up? You go to contest that. Sports Gaming, podcast.com contest dot sports gambling podcast.com. Now, unfortunately we do have to do the pics page from CBS and uh, so every week the lines will go up about Wednesday, Wednesday evening, west coast time. You make your pics and then I know what you're thinking of. What are the prizes? Great Question Ryan. The prizes this season prices, we're not giving away sportsbook credit. We're giving away cold hard cash. Okay, pretty drinking. I know what you're thinking. What are the weekly prize as well? The weekly prize, whoever wins the week, you get one item for free from the SGP merchant page. But most importantly because we want to reward consistency, there could be some freak freak moments where someone has a great one, but we want to, we want guys in there day in, day out cashing tickets, much like we did in the super contests almost. We didn't actually catch when we did hit on 60% come on against the spread. Ryan. These seasoned prize pool will be determined by the listeners. Oh Wow. Really? And I know what you're thinking. How does that work? The listeners just get to decide, hold on and get the dental base. We're going to start calculating here. Here's how it works.

Speaker 1:          00:04:35       We meaning a sports gambling, podcasts, network ads, shark putting up $2,500 plus. Now this is where you, the listeners come in $1 per entry for the season long prize pool. So if we get 7,500 people, we're giving away 10 grand. If we only get a hundred people, we're only giving away 2,600 so you the listeners, it's up to you guys to spread the word, get everyone signed up and the free roll football contest and then the season long prizes first, first place, a juicy 60% cut of the prize pool percentages. Now I need a calculator again. Get the database on it. Jeez. 60% second place, 25% of the prize pool of third place, 15% of the prize pool and then fourth through eighth, one item from the SGP march page. So things a little different this year and it's not, it's not roll over credit at a sports book. Instead it's cold, hard cash, which I know you guys want. And uh, listen, ended the season. That's a perfect time. Your Post Christmas, your pockets are empty. You're going to need some cash. And uh, what better time than right after the NFL season and rolling into the playout. Yeah. What better time? I mean I would almost rather, uh, when a week then the season would that baby whale tee or you can baby whale

Speaker 5:          00:05:58       tee shirts available the year with the regular t shirts available that the hoodies available. Will there be more shown there? Well, we are a, we're just looking at some more designs and we're just going to be loading up that merge page. So stay tuned. The art department's working on them working over time. And again, we'll be out in Las Vegas this weekend so people are hitting us up. Hit us up. If, uh, you know, we may have some shirts kicking around, people are hitting us up like crazy. I mean, this contest that they're going to, I mean, we should check in with Gus Johnson because I think just the collection

Speaker 5:          00:06:32       be like the a, the moment when I was on campus as a freshman and Brittany Spears came out for that halftime performance, just penetration, a collective nutting of the, uh, the population. Yeah. No, I mean people are Jones about the contest. People are Jones and about Vegas. People are Jones in about a year. Everyone's DFS lineups. There's just, there's just a frantic energy that takes over your brain. If you're like me, I'm just stressed out. I'm laying down different DFS lineups, all of which obviously check out the, uh, the DFS picks podcast where we give out or, or DFS lineups. But Sunday morning I'll, I'll be posting all like DFS lineups on a Instagram at gambling and sports gambling packets. You'll have to show me how to use Instagram when we were in Vegas. It'll be great. Yeah. So is it, so Sean, I've already reached that point. Um, I, fantasy football got got to that point where I said yes to two of the people stopped giving a shit about a team halfway through the draft.

Speaker 5:          00:07:31       Love it just, it's, I dunno, I've, I'm stressed out about this Vegas trip. I'm leaving in like eight hours, 10 hours, got a lot of stuff to do before I leave. I don't get your honey do list. Right. But you gotta you gotta prioritize trying to find a dog that I liked this week. A lot of things are stressing me out. There are, uh, there are some ugly dogs and uh, yeah, I mean not to tip our hands here, but it does feel like I'll be ending up with a, uh, with a lot of chalk this week. Sweet. Sweet.

Speaker 4:          00:08:05       Brian, without further ado, if you're like me and like Kramer over there, you are Jonesing to lay down some sweet action head over to my book.

The wave of sweet cash and a sup 100 hundred percent deposit. Phoniness my book, you add a jeans, it's pretty simple. Play win. And most importantly, Ryan get, Hey, I thought it was half fun. No getting paid is having fun.

Speaker 1:          00:09:21       Joining us on the line, Bill Burr. Bill, how excited are you that football is officially back?

Speaker 6:          00:09:28       Oh, this is the greatest time of year. It's Jagan in La. It's starting to get colder at night. I love it. I'm actually, I, I, you know, I know there's all these new rules and they could barely hit each other. Oh my God, I don't cheat. I don't even care if it's flag football. It's football. I'm sorry. Is this the best? It's football into Halloween and thanksgiving. Christmas. I love it. Favorite time of year.

Speaker 1:          00:09:52       Honestly, Sean, it's the feeling I get when I, when I give myself a little, uh, abstinence from the old medication and then I, I get to indulge again and that, that first like sinking into the couch. That's football for me. I'm, I'm stoked. It's back. Yup. Comfort food, baby. It is so great. I feel like they scared us a little bit in the a week two and week three of the pre season. They were just flagging everything. Any, any uh, guy lowers his helmet even though he's got his head up trying to hit him right in the chest. They're throwing a flag and then all of a sudden week for the preseason, all those flags dried up. I have a feeling when it comes, you know, Thursday night we'll see very few of those penalties actually called the, because the refs are just as big a fan of football as us and they know it'll just kill the game if they do it all the time. I think they set up,

Speaker 6:          00:10:38       don't, the reps aren't making that call. It's the people up top talent to do it. This is the deal. At some point, if the game is going to continue, you're just going to have to sign a release. So if you want to play this at a professional level, these are the risks and they're going to make you like, they're probably drawing up that contract right now. You can never come back and sue us. I mean, look, if, if, if the state or the federal government can put you in jail for like 30 years and then realized they screwed up and the only way they let you out as you can't sue them. I'm sure the NFL can draft something these for these people, that belt, they'll come up with something. So I think the game will be okay.

Speaker 1:          00:11:20       Yeah. The same people who drew up the warnings for cigarettes now, the Philip Morris guys, they'll meet up with the NFL, they'll figure it out. Hey, you just got to put this warning on the helmet. You know, we'll still be good. Yeah, come on. It was great. It did feel like this, uh, this college football weekend leading into the NFL was almost a kind of a warmup or play baby. Yeah.

Speaker 6:          00:11:41       Did you watch football? Because football has been like, it's just been what it's been all about man for the last few years. Like it's just, it's so exciting. And then they finally figured out not to have all those, like just a cupcake games. You know, like I remember back in the day when you would gamble in like in like, uh, September, like Nebraska would be favored by 58 over Kent State and then they'd cover, it was like ridiculous. Um, but now there was smart enough where they had, they had the Michigan Notre Dame game, they had Lsu Miami that the Florida state game last night. I missed all of that. I was doing some daddies labor day stuff with the family. I missed that one. But, um, I I absolutely, I love college football as much as I love pro so much to my wife's Chagrin my entire weekend and this weekend I'm actually in Sacramento and then I got to go to the Toronto Film Festival. Uh, so I'm missing Saturday football and I'm flying home during the one o'clock game. So this is going to be a lot of Dvr and going on in my house.

Speaker 1:          00:12:41       Oh, that's my favorite thing. Every season is the really football's back already. It's only August, wasn't it? Just the draft. What happened. Then you got the combine and then you just go, hey honey, one of the real housewives in the off season. Exactly. The Bachelor is a full time sport. Like you know the NFL should be as well.

Speaker 6:          00:13:03       Yeah. That that Andy Cohen show, that's their sports center where they get those women all stirred up again. What about on this plate when she said you're, you're barren and you couldn't have children, they start yelling at each other. It's like watching a red round the horn.

Speaker 1:          00:13:16       Yeah it does. It does. It does end the pacing of a studio show cause they bring up game film. They're breaking it down. What do you, you know they have former players, former bachelor's weighing in turning point Madden's on the telestrator over there. That's good.

Speaker 6:          00:13:33       That's the only way I could, I had to like get like look at my wife's perspective and just be like, this is just her sports center. And then I was able to kind of relax and then I really look at a lot of the, you know, it's a lot of the sports chatter out there. It's just so ridiculous. It's like somebody like me who's not even connected to it. Just I'll tell you, I'm really concerned about a middle relief. Know talking baseball. It's like, oh, are you somebody who never played beyond not getting picked in gym class?

Speaker 1:          00:13:59       The weird thing is always funny. Sean's a big fan of doing that with the Eagle and I do enjoy the, uh, you know, we're, we're going to win it all this year. It is a way, it's a way, because if you don't win, you get all this crap you guys saw. Exactly. Show, model, Blah. Then all of a sudden your win and then the other guy, it's like, oh, we're easy to apply. You didn't play, but what do you mean? Yeah, when, when I wake up Monday and the eagles got their ass kicked, I'm fucking depressed. All right. I have to live with that. These guys, that's just a job for them. This is my fucking life. So, yeah, I may dress right

Speaker 6:          00:14:31       at, at people give you shit saying you guys suck. You guys show Philly's a bunch of losers and then all of a sudden if you're win every, that's when you know you want to gain. When people say, oh, we, it's not we, it's like, oh, we must've won something that

Speaker 1:          00:14:47       you resent. Yes, exactly. All right, well, perfect bill, we uh, we picked up a couple of games here to break down with you. Of course, all the spreads come in from our official partner, my bookie dot. Agee. He's that Promo Code Bill Bats for a hundred percent deposit bonus. First game opening game of the season. Atlanta falcons heading into Philadelphia right now it's looking like eagles minus two and a half. I think it opened at like three and a half. It was up to four when it sounded like when this playing. Now when's is out? Falls is named the starter. Which way you lean in on this game.

Speaker 7:          00:15:22       Ah,

Speaker 6:          00:15:25       you got to take the eagles at home. I know. I, you know, they're going to be raising the flag. Every one's going to be going nuts. Half the crowd will be in that little jail they have. Um, I, ah, it is, it's still the eagle. So those should win this game, but there's still, until they wouldn't that second one, there's still the eagles on Nerd, but I'm going to take the eagles at home considering, uh, nick falls at a pedestrian 300 yards in the Superbowl compared to Tom Brady's 500 yards and losing which will never be broken. And Tom, Tom does it again. Thank you so much for bringing this up.

Speaker 1:          00:16:06       I go at it with Patriots fans who say that Brady had a better game that falls out. Brady had an amazing game and you can't obviously knock Brady's play at all. But in that particular game I would say nick foals out played him because of the couple of key plays fulls made and the limiting of the turnovers and Brady obviously. Yeah, Sean's defensive of Nick

Speaker 6:          00:16:27       full is a passion of mine.

Speaker 1:          00:16:32       Well No. And then the fumble, that kind of turned the game at the end. And on the other side you've got nick foals driving down to get a touchdown. Now I'm not trying to

Speaker 6:          00:16:41       not timeout dude. First of all, Tom Brady's not a running back. He's like 51 years old. If you don't block it, he gets tackled that one fumble duty through for 500 yards. If you're really going to put that it was our defense. Right fix. What's the problem on both sides of the ball? Both sides of the ball. Nick false came out like it was a regular season game. He wasn't nervous. Tom Brady's Tom Brady, Balsa offenses played great defenses on both teams. Sucked, sucked. The only thing was the eagle sucked. A little less. Eating goes basically the eagles made the only, I think defensive play the game. I'll up saying listen you started this shit cause I'm sitting there congratulating you. If you're going to say like, like that is like like some ESPN shit. Just say like do you have any hot takes gone. Somebody throws to a 500 yards and they're the problem. They they I think they will kind of offs the

Speaker 1:          00:17:41       magic. No, I would at this point it's my, it's probably my second favorite sport or watching Sean talking about how Nicole is, had a better game than Tom Brady. And to be clear, Tom Brady had an amazing game. The reason the patriots lost was because they couldn't stop anyone on defense. That's, that's what I'm really, what you're bringing it full circle for us. Nicole's is gonna suck. Like he has the rest of his career.

Speaker 6:          00:18:01       Eagles. Eagles couldn't stop the patriots either. They stopped him one fucking to do. There was like two pumps the whole game. Yeah. Yeah. It was crazy. There's no talking shit about what your defense did in that game other than we made one play if they would like, I mean the offense was, it was the weirdest. I can't watch it because it's too still too close, but I have to go back and watch it. It's the weirdest fucking game. I mean at this, that's, that's some shit that happens at like division three high school where there's like two pumps in a game. He looked like a big game. It was really a, it was, it was bizarre. I not start yet. And it started off with what's his face is like, like, like crying, like he's had a funeral that Malcolm Butler.

Speaker 1:          00:18:46       Oh Man, what did he do? What did he do? I guess we'll never find,

Speaker 6:          00:18:50       I should've known. I should've known when he was, when they'd better. Anytime Bella check does that we lose. So I remember we were playing the jets at home and Wes Welker had made all those feet joke. Rex Ryan, we sat him and then Brady threw the worst tasks of his career on that. That screen pass or was just, it was like he threw it three yard hail. Mary went up in the air and there's always a pick six. And uh, so anyway, what happened, man, I wish that you guys beat somebody else because I was very happy. I would have what I could have enjoyed watching the eagles. Finally, what am I, because I don't wish long term misery on any sports fan other than a select stu, you, Montreal, Montreal Canadians fans and Yankee fence to everybody else. Everybody else.

Speaker 1:          00:19:37       All right. So Kramer said, are you going with, obviously I'm going to be on the eagles. The key with foals is if you give him time, if he, if he doesn't face a pass for us, she's going to be okay. They got Jason Peters coming back and left tackle. I think that'll be huge. They get some of their weapons back. I think they could scheme up a decent game plan. I think their defense will play good, uh, against the Falcons here week one. And uh, yeah, they're raising the banners. I think there'll be jacked for it. I'm going on the eagles.

Speaker 6:          00:20:04       You got shut down the vikings, you know, everybody, you guys just completely shut them down in the, in the NFC championship game, if I remember correctly. So the census there, I just don't, that was like a twilight zone game.

Speaker 1:          00:20:17       It was bizarre because I, every scenario in my head going over the game for the eagles to when it was going to be a defensive struggle, you know, or, or a low scoring game. I certainly didn't see 13 yeah, something like that. That's what I was thinking and I was shocked to see them pull it out with the, you know, 74 points or whatever scored. Yeah, I mean, listen, it's tough to go against the, the, I mean the patriots got runner up last year, but typically the team raising the banner, it's a good bet. You know, the contrarian in me also likes the line, you know, the line move is moving the wrong way. Nick falls did just win the Superbowl MVP, so got to give them better the benefit of the doubt. But what I would say the Falcons could have that pastor I've shown you mentioned the past rush, that could be the problem.

Speaker 1:          00:20:58       And just out of principle off, I'm of course I'm going to fade the eagles fan niggles. All right. Next up. Big Game. Houston Texans at the New England patriots right now. Patriots six point favorite. And uh, I'll kick things off. I like the pats here, lane six against his texts and his team. I mean, one thing that's been pretty consistent in the Brady Bellacheck era is they look good coming off a loss. And if you look at 2012 when they lost the Superbowl in 2008 they and even back to the parcels and 96 they came back and uh, they won 34 13 they want 1710 they want 41 to seven like this team. I think we'll come out with a statement game and really put it on the tech since that's what I'm saying.

Speaker 6:          00:21:42       I'm not trying to be a jerk here, but how does, how does that have anything to do with this team? All those and all of the personnel from all of that. It's like, you know, they think they play really good historically and when it's 70 degrees out,

Speaker 1:          00:21:57       Bella check I guess. Yeah, I guess. I guess to me it's, I don't Bella checks the guy that just doesn't lose back to back games and I think, listen, little brothers coming off a Superbowl loss. Yeah. Bill O'brien, former guy in the coaching tree. I think he's going to want to put it on him. I just, this patriots team seems like they're ready to make a statement at home against the Texans team.

Speaker 6:          00:22:20       Do you see it go, well, I think Texas quarterback, what's his name there to Sean Watson? He's coming off the ACL. He's going to be a nightmare. He's going to be a nightmare for us trying to contain him. And the only thing I like is like, I guess they have the worst offensive line in the league. I think that bodes well for us. Um, what's the spread?

Speaker 1:          00:22:42       Six patriots laying six at home.

Speaker 6:          00:22:45       Oh, they always pick the perfect number. Dot. Yeah, they're so good. I'm actually, I'm actually going to take the Texans with the points because a, you have the last year we played the Kansas City chiefs and they came in and they killed us, you know, so I'm gonna play your game and talk about something that happened before. Probably it doesn't matter. I think everybody's going to jump on the patch being like, oh, they're going to be pissed because they've lost the super bowl. Everything he just said. And then the time Julio Jones, that wasn't really, you're at a sports bar like me without, and makes a couple of great catches in. Now also, this is their revenge game. I'll forget, they haven't seen us since we, uh, came back and this, you know, came back historically two years ago in the Superbowl against them. So, uh,

Speaker 1:          00:23:32       sorry, I think you were bringing the falcons in there for a second right there.

Speaker 6:          00:23:38       Forgot. And we were playing Texas. I'm sorry.

Speaker 1:          00:23:40       Oh, good. Kramer. Which way? Which way you lean in here? I mean, yeah, it's Bellicheck just whoops. On his disciples period. Yeah. Not much to handicap to Sean Watson would scare me with that defense. Yeah. Uh, I do, I am curious to see the offensive line, but I've just seen, I feel like we've seen this so many times where a t and optimistic disciple of bill Bellacheck comes in and just gets, gets a shit pushed in. So yeah, I'm not, I'm not a fan of the Patriots week one. Yeah, I do. I do think bill is hitting on something. No, because I feel like, and maybe this is again just kind of a gut instinct, but the pads kind of play themselves in September. They use it as an extended preseason. Kind of try out some stuff, figure out some things. And I'm still shocked that Patricia got a head coaching job because I don't know that defense didn't want, you know, instill a lot of confidence. So that's, that's crazy that he got that Detroit Gig

Speaker 6:          00:24:35       y'all can't reminds me of, when I first moved out to la the first time it'll late nineties, everybody out here either had a Seinfeld or a friend's credit and that entitled them to some sort of show runner like, uh, or they, we get some sort of deal and they would pair them up like, oh, this guy wrote on friends, this guy wrote on sign shop. I think bill Bellacheck is to Seinfeld of writers' room. If you did, if you did anything, if you will, the waterboy. Yeah, but he was the water boy. Bill Bella check you. You don't make a lateral move. You don't become the waterboy you, you get elevated in physicians. So maybe that's why a Patricia's where we is.

Speaker 1:          00:25:15       I mean it's so true, but it sounds like Patricia is just, it sounds like people are already penciling them in is a failure. It sounds like things aren't going well. There's some weird dynamics going on with that team. All right. One of the, uh, one of the Monday night games. There's the dual Monday night game. Do a kick off the season, which fuck it. Why not the La Rams head up to Oakland right now. The Raiders four point home dog bill. I'll let you, uh, get things started here. How do you, how do you see this game shaken out? Do you look, do you like the Raiders? What's your thoughts on John Gruden?

Speaker 7:          00:25:47       MMM,

Speaker 6:          00:25:49       I'm hoping that he doesn't regret going back to the 24, seven, three 65 life of coaching when I always feel like when coaches get into broadcasting and there was good at good at it as is groupness they gotta be sitting there going like this, just job as a joke compared to what? Compared to what I used to have to do. But I imagine he missed it. Obviously they gave the right amount of money. He came back and made Gruden. I know he's been gone for a while, man. I mean, well how many years? Like almost a decade and a half. He left like early two thousands I right.

Speaker 1:          00:26:22       Yeah, I think it's good. At least 10 years. I think we looked it up. It was, it was before the wildcat. So put that in perspective. Yeah.

Speaker 6:          00:26:31       Yeah. 2007. Yeah. So that's a long time and each generation of kids is a little bit different and he's also rebuilding and I saw the thing on the Ram's head coach where he could recall like you usually see that in real sports with Bryant Gumbel. Like they'd be like, hey a minute, 42, week eight, third quarter, what happened? He's like, Oh yeah, we ran that sweep play. The guard didn't get out, uh, quite where we wanted him to, but he got the job done. He has like a photographic memory. I think that guy is, is like if anybody's going to be the next generation of guys, it's going to be him. And um, where he's, where he's just taking the rams so quickly. I just think, uh, cause is just starting to put it back together. I would take the ramps.

Speaker 1:          00:27:18       Okay. Kramer, first of all. Yeah. It comes off like somewhere between a serial killer and rain man and that piece, he's definitely like, well advanced of grew and, and, and just just imagine, I mean I have to deal with millennials on a daily basis shown. I cannot imagine John Gruden dealing with millennials. I mean, we know why he came back. We saw it in hard knocks last year. He still was making a playbook. He just didn't have anyone to give it to. He loves rocking the visors. He's, he's cut like half the team. I think I saw that there's, there's 31 new players on his 53 man roster. Um, I saw a great tweet. The Raiders decided to pay a coach $100 million and not pay their best player 90. Uh, so many reasons to, I mean, this is the ultimate, like, just take the ugly dog, right?

Speaker 1:          00:28:02       This is the ultimate take the ugly dog on money and I, but I, I can't do it. I can't do it in this spot. So yeah, I'm going to fake. I come on and we, we think Jay Gruden's a joke, at least I do. He made a mistake, he's going to realize it quickly. My talks, I wouldn't, I wouldn't normally like to take a kind of road favorite here in a divisional spot. I normally like to take a Monday night home dog. Great Opportunity here. But man, this Raiders team isn't crazy disarray and it just seems like the quarterbacks pissed off. He's upset that they traded their best player. It's a weird move to pull this close to the season and the Raiders did the 24th ranked defense with cleal Mag. You trade a all time defensive player. Now maybe this line up working out for them in the long run. But I think this rams offense, even though they didn't get a lot of reps in the pre season for whatever reason McVay maybe, you know, they use the crazy analytics and some sports side, no wig Gruden's using analytics. He openly challenges analytics, which I Kinda, I normally like the old school guy approach there, but uh, yeah,

Speaker 6:          00:29:02       I'm lucky. Yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:29:10       look at that. You look at the ram season that last year in St Louis didn't go well, moved out to Fisher. It was just a complete disaster. Just think of this. If John like John Gruden became a caricature, much like John Madden. Imagine if John Madden came back to coaching after like 15 years. No fucking way. Yeah. I, I think burden. It'll be interesting. I don't know.

Speaker 6:          00:29:31       I'm not saying, I'm just saying he walked into a hell of a situation. Yeah. He's playing these guys week one who are just going to build on what the past two seasons, how much they've improved. I just think they, I think they're going to keep going. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:29:46       The rams have a lot of momentum from last year. Not even catching like an east coast team playing that late kickoff. You're catching another west coast team, so it's not like they have no, there might be more rare. I mean there's gonna be a lot of rams fans right now that the bandwagon has gotten nice and roomy. Yeah. I think it's, I think a lot of ranch hands going up to, oh, you know, it's true. That's also true. That is such a weird tradition. The guys, let's get her costumes on and go to the game. The foam spike shoulder pads like, hey, I got to, hey, we're going to go tailgate. Let me stop off at Michael's first to get all my face pain and Styrofoam cones. The glue on the shoulder bags. I'm a pirate.

Speaker 6:          00:30:27       So yeah, they used to look like a biker gang. The crowd somewhere along the line. Yes. Starting to look like like a musical, you know what I mean? Like, like, like, like for kids, you know? Or even this even this scary thing.

Speaker 1:          00:30:40       It's a little friendly. It's almost like you've kissed. Just became a cheering section.

Speaker 6:          00:30:46       Yeah. It's like rocky horror pictures, whatever the hell that stupid movie is meets like it needs like a Disney ride or something. Like we can only make it so scary because we don't, there's something about like when you have the dad bod and foam spikes coming up, I love that. They think that they're intimidating. The other team, the other team literally has 300 pound guys trying to rip their heads off. But you're up there dressed like a pirate and you're the one who's be

Speaker 1:          00:31:15       throw him off. Oh, you're eyepatch man, you're freaking me out.

Speaker 6:          00:31:19       There's a lot of that. The dog pound a lot of that silly stuff. Like you know, your dad goes there on a rubber mask, eat dog biscuits. It's like, come on dad, I gotta go. I gotta go.

Speaker 1:          00:31:29       Oh, on Monday. I have to respect your father. Come on. Yeah, you just helped me with my math homework. You're not crazy. All right bill, before we, uh, before we let you go here, what is a, maybe it's these three games, maybe it's a, a, another game you feel really strongly about week one. Can we get you to throw out a lock? You know, we are a gambling podcasts, so what is, what is bill burrs lead pipe lock for week one,

Speaker 6:          00:31:54       my lead pipe lock. All right, this is my lock and it's not going to be gambling related. My lock is going to be whatever happens this week. Most people in sports are going to talk radio, are going to act like, you know, like say Oakland gets their asses kicked. All they're going to be talking about that John Jacob was, he sitting on $100 million and he's, and he's all in one worst case scenario, one game out of first they're going to act like every goddamn thing that happens this son Thursday, Sunday and Monday is what's going to happen the whole year. They do it every fucking when Kansas City came out and kick the Patriots, as all of a sudden Kansas City was the fucking team of the future. And what happened to them? You know, the Patriots went back and won the AFC championship, you know, so I mean, just don't listen for gamblers. Do not listen to all of the freaking out that they're going to be doing when they feel it. That's, it's just, I don't know, they always act like the fucking sky is falling or Jesus just came back after every single game. You know what I mean?

Speaker 1:          00:33:09       You look at some of the teams that started to get destroyed, missed the playoffs. And that's a great, you know, advice especially for gamblers because a lot of times you see one week and then complete crazy overreactions and we always talk about that week too. When you're picking your games, don't overreact to that week one. If you had a strong feeling or yeah, whatever you, you were really high on the team. It could just be one bad game. Don't totally throw out your shit by low Sean. Bye. Hello.

Speaker 6:          00:33:37       Exactly. Look for the look for that overreaction spread sheet. They can jump on that.

Dot. C. O Kramer. Let's do it. Oh, Sean, have you stretched? You Ready? I might pull a hand. Listen, we've had all summer. Um, although it's funny all summer to look at these lines and yet so much has changed in the last couple of weeks even since the last time we talked about it. So I mean, Sean, let's, should we just, should we just dive in or are we just making

Speaker 5:          00:35:38       sex now? Yes. Alright. Well, Thursday night, the tradition, like none other, the Superbowl winner in this case, the Philadelphia Eagles hosting the Atlanta Falcons for a revenge spot potentially for the falcons. Suddenly with Carson Wentz out, the falcons are laying a point in Philadelphia. Uh, even I questioned this minus one 20 on the money line

Speaker 1:          00:36:03       plus 100 for the eagles. 45 is the total. We did mention a different spread. Yes. When we just talked to bill, it was the night before and it was two and a half. Now the Philadelphia Eagles are home dogs have had the, I mean, do you remember the dog mass? You remember lane chats, you remember, you remember Chris Lung, you remember that this team was disrespected. And you remember how they responded and you're going to make them a home dog once again. What is Atlanta done in the off season that makes you think they're just going to come in and blow the doors off? Yes. Carson Wentz is not at the helm and that hurts their office. But you still have super bowl MVP. Nick falls at the hell.

Speaker 5:          00:36:43       I mean, yeah they are missing now. Shawn Jeffery. But you know what they have that they didn't have last time. Jason Peters and Jordan Hicks leading players on both sides of the ball. You got j a j healthy where you are you preparing cause when, when Atlanta was the dog, I, I enjoyed that side of it. I think it's going to be a close game. Uh, at two and a half I would be fine taking the falcons. But I think at a point there gets to a point where it's like, well and maybe I just had time to think about, maybe I reminded myself. Oh that's right. It's Matt Ryan. Oh, Matty ice on the road. I know he, he's a, he's a cool bro who likes to drink and natural ice and he's from Philadelphia or some shit like that. But

Speaker 1:          00:37:28       I, then I remember, oh, it's the falcons and they're going outside to a, granted it's not going to be cold or anything, anything like that, but may actually be human. It's going, they're going outside. They're going to be playing a, just a super savage crowd, savage. And we wasn't one fucking Superbowl and this is the game where they're raising the banners and you were to come in. You're not, you're not making the Superbowl champs a favorite at home. That is the definition of disrespect. Do you kidding me?

Speaker 5:          00:37:57       Yeah. So, oh, all of that being said like, I really want to take the falcons here, but there's a, I, uh, nick falls is, it's so hard to do. Hard to

Speaker 1:          00:38:08       do this with nick folds doesn't look good. No. Nicole's doesn't look good in the preseason. Right. This guy shows up in big games and this game at home is a big game. Now what's the key to the nic fall? It's the key to Nicole's is giving him time to throw the book football with Jason Peters in there who didn't play all preseason looks 100% they're going to have time to throw the football. They're going to scheme up. I mean if you want to play, if you want to talk about fantasy j a Gi I think could have a big game because they're going to be running screens. They're going to be getting him going in the first half. That's going to loosen up the Atlanta defense and really I think this game is just going to come down to Philly's defense playing really well and I like what they've done.

Speaker 1:          00:38:50       Yeah, Timmy Tim journey guns out, but they blood, they brought it in. Hello? D Nata Michael Bennet, that defensive line. Derek Barnett, second year, he's looking better brain and Graham is fired up. Fletcher Cox said he's going to try and be the defensive player of the year. He'll looks, you want to talk about pre season that guys was just fucking destroying offensive lines long. Cox and Chris long still looks good. This past her. She's going to get the Atlanta Falcons and Jordan Hicks being there really helps them app. I do think not having natural Brad, their hurts, their run defense, but this team shows up. They defend the, the trophy at home. It's going to be a nightmare for the Atlanta Falcons who didn't look great in the pre season. They can say the eagles look rusty, but the, the falcons didn't look right. I just think this is a tough spot for this falcons team who, Oh and two against the gym shorts, defense and I think a Thursday night they make it. Oh, and three. I got it. It'll be a competitive game. I got it. Like 2117 eagles. Yeah, I mean week one is not, is not the week to get into a bunch of trends or data because it's the start of something new and you don't have a sample size. Sean, this is the,

Speaker 8:          00:40:06       no, it's,

Speaker 1:          00:40:07       it's a, it's appropriate. It's, this is the ultimate time where you, you don't, you don't, don't, don't try to overthink it. Um, I think there's a lot of reasons, but look at, just look at the slate. How many home dogs do we have? Right? Cleveland, you want to compare that Superbowl champs to Cleveland? What's funny is the Raiders are a home dog. You want to compare them to the Raiders. What's funny is I'm about to pick the eagles and you're getting very defensive. Not, no, I'm mad at the lines makers. I mean, I guess I'm not mad at him. If my bookie daddy wants to give away their money, then that's their choice. This isn't the line. They opened it where it opened and now it's being bet. Yes. That's what's happening here. Uh, I will go against this, this action. I will middly. I did Bennett when it was at Philly minus four because I was sure that Carson Wentz is going to play and I thought I was getting a great number.

Speaker 1:          00:40:57       So again, probably probably worth waiting on these lines, but, well, not if you get on the right side, like say giants plus four, but we'll get to that later. Yeah. I'm, I'm gonna, I'm gonna fade this line movement. I'm going to fade the, uh, the public opinion and uh, yeah. Gimme gimme Philly as as gross as it is. Shawn, I gotta take Philly Thursday night raising the banners and everyone, everyone thinks about that patriots chief's game last year as all the defending champs got whooped at home. But that is a first off a that that was an

Speaker 5:          00:41:34       anomaly. You got Andy Reid opening opening day, which is you want to talk about trends that actually matter when Andy Reid has a long time to prepare, he is a, he is a good coach. He coaches them up. So, and that I think was more the anomaly. If you look at the previous years showing shown 80%, 80% of the cash, please say falcons. Please say falcons. 70% of the tickets on the falcons.

Speaker 9:          00:42:03       [inaudible] I felt,

Speaker 5:          00:42:07       I felt, I felt a little nervous, but now I feel much better. All right, let's should we move on to Sunday shown? I can talk about this game all day. I know you can Sunday 10:00 AM kick it. I feel you will be in the beautiful Oh, West Gate. Um, confirmed it is free again. Like march madness. Yeah, there was a, there was a little hiccup there with their formula, but we will be in the Westgate ballroom where they have a just movie screens, size fires going in and out. Sorry, I'm a little tipsy. A little fired up. Right? Yeah, I mean, so uh, I apparently, I don't know how true this is. Unconfirmed sources have told me that uh, apparently it didn't go over well when they charge for seats during March madness. So they're, they're going back to making it free. Uh, it is definitely a great place to check out.

Speaker 5:          00:42:54       Games were not being paid at all, but no, they should pay us 10:00 AM one of the games that give me a drink ticket. Come on man. One of the teams that will definitely be off to the side. One of the games that will be off to the side is this one seems to happen every year. Pittsburgh Steelers with I guess without Levy on bell at this point. It does appear that way. He's, they're heading to Cleveland where this line open. Sean, I think. I think what six and a half. It's come all the way down to four plus one 75 for the browns minus two 10 for the Steelers. 46 is the total. So, so Cleveland money is pouring in. Yeah. You know the sharps love them some by the way, Jackson, one in 31. What more do you need to see, by the way, why is it that the GM or the head coach weren't doing the cuts for the Cleveland Browns?

Speaker 5:          00:43:43       And did you watch the latest, sorry, why did they have this assistant? He was like the assistant GM looked like Bill Simmons and he was so nervous. So yeah, it's uh, it's time to have that conversation. You know, it's a tough business. You're going to be great. Be a man and look them in the AG. Oh, hey you, you played, you played hard. I mean, I appreciate it. Or just say, hey man, I appreciate you showing up. Pest and luck. Shake his hand. They realize it's the NFL. You don't need a caudal. Again, Rhone Nfl, it's, it's super awkward. It's hard to watch and shows a huge accident is not a good coach, has no control of the team, and they haven't even decided who's starting at left tackle. He wouldn't answer that question. The teams in disarray now tie Rod Taylor Ryan, who you have a hard on for.

Speaker 5:          00:44:32       Yeah, he can limit the turkeys are great. I think he's a great quarterback action, right, and you're, you're, you're hokey. Love is making you crazy. He's a bottom 10 quarterback. Whoa. Oh, I'll take that bet right now. I don't know how we quantify this movie. I'll take that, but he's not a thought of qualifying him wins. That's how we quantify it. He made the fucking playoffs last year. Shawn, the every argument you use for nick folds just, I mean, tie Rod, we'll come on. Dragos is so much the buffalo is not a playoff team with nick folds last year. Dude, you're crazy. No, it's just crazy. When when teams are bad, they need a quarterback. They can give them a little, a little bit, a little breathing room. Listen, this isn't a, this isn't a statement. Cleveland right here. You don't like Cleveland as a home dog shot one in 31 I'll, I'll say that all day.

Speaker 5:          00:45:25       Yeah. Jackson one to get the fuck out of you. I'm so glad. Love yet. But I was not playing this levy on bell's not worth two and a half points. No. And if you want to talk daily fantasy or any fantasy, uh, Connor, the backup, I think this, I mean if you listen to the, how pissed off their o linemen are, I think they're going to be motivated to, to show that they don't need levy on pal. I think this could be a statement game and it goes deeper than that. Connor local kid cancer survivor. Oh come on. Came back in college. I mean it and, and honestly like when he was in app hit, like he looked through your first round NFL running back. So I have no dad. He could step in. I it a couple of day again. I'm not getting too deep into this game. Let's Fade Hugh Jackson. Yes. And let's not apply two and a half points of line value to loving on bell. It's a simple formula. Does this line so on Pittsburgh, does he get the three?

Speaker 9:          00:46:24       Yeah,

Speaker 5:          00:46:25       Tommy. God Damn, if that gets the three trouble. All right, well we're a, I feel like we're chalky cause we took the eagles but they're not actually chalk. Anyway, moving on up to the space ship where the Minnesota Vikings are hosting the Jimmy g, the very handsome Jimmy g led San Francisco 40 niners. The vikings are laying six and a half points minus two 75 on the money line plus two 25 for the 49 there's 46 is your total Zimmer said Dalvin Cook is full. Go.

Speaker 9:          00:47:05       Okay.

Speaker 5:          00:47:05       Aye. Aye. Aye. Aye. Don't you love this Minnesota team? Like isn't this a classic like I can't wait. I mean I know you weren't as high. I'm going to say actually you weren't quite high in Minnesota. You had them winning. I liked this Minnesota team. We've always talked about Zimmer gets the most out of his guys, especially on the defensive side of the ball. Do they have a shutdown corner? They have a pass rush and they, they went out and got a quarterback that sure

Speaker 1:          00:47:30       it will make them higher variants this year. But what did I say? Well we broke down the NFC north. They are going to destroy people at home that whatever they did in that building, they built themselves and amazing home field advantage. And on the flip side, San Francisco as a team, I've been itching to fade and this should be seven points period. It's on the wrong side of seven. While you're, no you're not. It probably should be Ryan. But I'm going to go, listen, I brought two pens out here so I can throw one at you. What are you doing? Here's what I'm doing. You, you're, you're searching for a dog aren't, you know, I would never do such a thing. It Minnesota feels a little too easy. And if you remember Kirk cousins last year, opening day at home against the Philadelphia Eagles as a favorite, didn't pull it out and even turn the ball over a couple of times.

Speaker 1:          00:48:23       One, including a defensive touchdown, which helped me a when $200,000 in money or maker, so which I witnessed at the uh, west. Congratulations Sean. I don't know if I've ever mentioned on the podcast, I think this game, here's what I think of this game. If you've watched that San Francisco team last year and even during Jimmy, Geez, we're on where they went, five and o or whatever, which I I overall for the season I'm looking to fade San Francisco and get on Minnesota. However, situationally I think this could end up for me. This game feels like Minnesota gets out to a big lead and Jimmy g racks up some garbage yards and some garbage points. This to me feels like one of the few games on the slate where the spread will matter. Our Buddy Christian Pina from inside Vegas points out how often the spread doesn't matter. I'm going to make a bold prediction and say this is a game where the spread will matter.

Speaker 1:          00:49:17       This actually to me feels like a three or four point game. Now. I went into the season thinking, Hey, I want to go against the 40 niners a lot. I think they're a little over hyped. Smart. I'm going to take him here, but this is where you sell the stock because it's at its highest. It's never going to be highest or higher than when when they, before they play games, because this team is not going to be good. I don't think they're ever going to be that good. The stock is at a tie point, sell, sell. So I'm buying baby for this particular game. Jimmy Giana dome. He'll be able to move the ball enough to keep them competitive. Obviously I'm worried about Jerick Mckinnon not being there because it seemed like Shanahan had a hard on for him. Yeah. I think Shanahan schemes enough to get them to cover again.

Speaker 1:          00:50:01       This is not going to be in my lock or my dog. Ma, you're backing off it already. No, I'm not backing off at it. Slowly walk over and just know a game where I don't feel, uh, listen, I, I know they opened the season, uh, against the saints last year and beat them by 10. Like to me this is a no brainer there. They were so good at home. It's just that, that's all I see. I see what you're doing. I know you're trying to fill some dogs out on that card over there. Yeah. I just moving on, Sean, your boy Andrew Luck and the Indianapolis Colts, they host the Cincinnati Bangles culture minus two and a half. Definitely see some threes out there. I liked the two and a half minus one 50 on the money line. Cincinnati plus one 30, 48 and a half is the total.

Speaker 1:          00:50:47       Been hearing a lot of chatter about how Cincinnati is becoming a darling pick week one, uh, w w w what am I missing here, Sean? Well listen, Cincinnati is the, I'll give them the super bowl for square sharp of the year. A team because everyone who fancies themselves a handicapper, as I'm seeing stuff that you guys aren't seeing in the Cincinnati Bangles, what I'm seeing is a guy like Marvin Lewis who consistently disappoints, right? Five and 11 is past 16 road games. He's a guy who's not going to win on the road. And listen, sometimes you can overthink these things when it comes to penny on the NFL. And sometimes you just have to ride a trend like Andrew luck being the second best quarterback against the spread. You know why? Because the guy just figures out how to win fucking games. It doesn't need to get more complex than that.

Speaker 1:          00:51:42       Now what was it? What were the cults? Greatest weakness in the Andrew Lakira and that was coaching. Horrible coaching except for when our buddy, um, uh, areas was there. They had a good run, there were well coached then Pagano not a good coach and they had horrible offensive line play. That's why Andrew luck had to take a season that half off, cause he got the shit kicked out of them. Now they got Quinten Nelson, he's pulling out of the guard spot. He's dominating the offensive line. He's moving the line now is, is Andrew luck a little scared to go deep to Tui Helton? Maybe so. Maybe not. I think they roll coverage to t by Hilton and again, I've said it a million times in the daily fantasy podcast. I think Jack Doyle has a big game against the spangles defense. Now the contrarian is like, oh, indie's defense their dog shit, they're at home.

Speaker 1:          00:52:34       But I think in his defense is enough to keep them in it. This is a game you want Andrew Luck. This is the game. Now maybe you fade him week two, week three where the adrenaline where he's not playing at home, whatever the situations are. I haven't even looked at their schedule, but this seems like a spot where Andrew luck shows up. He comes out and says, Hey, I'm back. Uh, I mean I, maybe I'm not buying Cincinnati like some other people and may maybe. I remember like the crowd is going to be so juiced up to see Andrew luck and they had a year of Jacoby percent. Come on. Maybe my theme here is like, just like much like Matt Ryan just got paid and has to go outside and hard a difficult environment. Andy Dalton is going into a difficult environment and we know what Andy Dalton

Speaker 5:          00:53:26       is, don't we? Yes, it's, it's a mediocre and less than quarterback. And like our buddy, a doctor, Chao at pro football doc mentioned of the quarterbacks coming back from injury. Andrew Luck. He said he was the safest play. He was the guy that he thought was the most healed and that's all I need to hear. You're giving me a healthy Andrew luck less than three points. This is a game he shows up in wins. Yeah. And and Oh, by the way, oh, I know. Teams aren't, no team would be looking ahead after week one, but they got, Cincinnati is going to hit the Baltimore after this. So division division game. Are we really? Are we on the same fucking picks? No, I had the 40 niners right now. Thank God. Yeah. Gimme the colts. I'm, I'm back. I'm all in on Andrew luck this year. 30 to one MVP.

Speaker 5:          00:54:16       Maybe I shit. Next up. Oh, what a shit fest. This is going to be buffalo led by Mr Peterman. They head down to Baltimore. Baltimore is laying eight points minus three 40 on the money line. Buffalo plus two 70 40 and a half is the total. You know what this is Sean Circle it. This is the ugly, the ugly dog or the week of the ugliest dog. Uh, God, I mean, can can you back? He can't throw five picks and a half again. Kenny. Kenny. I mean you would think you would regress from five picks and a half, but either way, I'm not taking buffalo. I like, I like buffalo situationally. Normally I don't think they're going to be quite as bad. But I think part of that, them not being as bad as them getting Josh Allen in the lineup. So it may take a couple of games for them to do that.

Speaker 5:          00:55:07       There's no line value here. And taking Baltimore because they opened up and like minus three and a half. Everyone saw how good the ravens kind of our as a team, Joe FLACCO has a fire lit under his ass. Harbaugh's still solid coach. I like Baltimore to win the division. I'm going to take them at minus eight. Oh, really? You're laying these points? I don't like it, but I'm going to have to, uh, to me this is just the, again, I'm not going to overthink it. There has been a lot of line movement here and while it does seem like buffalo could be horrible, horrible dog shit, I see 92% of the money on the Raymond. I see 92% of the money on a ravens team led by Joe Flacco laying more than a touchdown. Give me the dog, Shawn. This was my attempt to Doug and listen, I, I see where you're coming from here, but it's so obvious.

Speaker 5:          00:56:02       Peterman socks, other no way. Come on. Do you want make it is a good coach. You don't see this as like this. This is going to be a classic, like they kick a field goal to win by five. I mean, I don't completely disagree. Baltimore's probably not one of my strongest plays at minus eight, but I'm going to fade Peterman on the road. Next up, Shawn, it's taking a road, Peterman play. I'm taking a, well maybe Alan gets a good, how many, how many picks before Peter was bold and we see Josh Allen, I may let me head over to my bookie and get some end game wager cause I, I like that kid. I just, I I wonder, I wonder about this number with Joe Flacco. I think again the theme here, I think some like, like a bunch of non non football playing months have happened and all of a sudden we have a different perception of Joe Flacco like that. He's worthy of laying this many points. Get the fuck out of here. Next up Sean, we have, I don't know much anticipated Tom Claflin revenge prevents Jacksonville heading into New York, laying the field goal. My minus minus three minus one 20 minus one 65 on the money line for Jacksonville plus one 40 for the giants. 43 and a half is the total.

Speaker 5:          00:57:19       I mean I we, this was a line that I gave out in the summer of giants plus four. Yeah, it's moved to a point that's probably smart movement. I think this line is right where it probably needs to be. Ah, Ryan. Am I going to take Blake Bortles as a road favorite? You Bet. Oh my goodness. You Bet. A, because tag God hates jags. Sean. God hates Jags, but God also, God also hates poor offensive line play. You are, you're punching your ticket to Saks and ville. This defensive line does not fuck around and your offensive line is a mess. I think it's going to be a bit of a problem. Sean, who do they play next week? Who? Who? Who? Who is the worst team the Jacksonville could have on deck check. Seville has no rivals, but who's the worst team that they could have on deck for the Patriots? They play the Patriots week too. At home. At home. Alright, possible. Look, ed spot. Conference roads. But you can't look ahead. Wordles on the road.

Speaker 5:          00:58:22       Listen, it's a bad formula. And at four I'm thinking about it much more, but at minus three, give me the Jags, the giants, Ryan who explained to me the cornerback structure, the New York. Jesus Christ. Okay, so you have to Norris Jenkins. Yeah, that guy's a player. Right? Or I'll give him that Isla apple disaster of a second. Too salesy. He's been wanting to battle players. Land in Collins has his back. He's really committed to the team. Who is Dante? Deon is the guy that you and all these other fucking talking heads that want to talk shit about the Joe Dante. Deon. It's going to come in and play the slot a, he's a baller.

Speaker 10:         00:59:01       Okay.

Speaker 5:          00:59:01       I don't really care Shawn. Okay. I know you don't care, but people have money on the Kootenays out with a high ankle sprain. That's the more concerning thing. Evan Ingram concussion. He's back. He's practicing. I just want to see the offense. Shawn, I want to see Beckham healthy. Hey, it'll be, it'll be fun. There'll be a co giants. I'll have a couple of big plays, but I think eventually the Jags, the defense will be too much. You want the hot tag? Sure.

Speaker 5:          00:59:30       Barclay goes for over 102 touchdowns. All right. I mean the jags defense is really good. I run events is not okay to take stands and a hundred yards. I'm saying that's the hot take shall. Okay. All right, well that's the take he just gave. Keeping the jags minus 30. I'll take the giants and this is where I point out even though they were the number one defense in the league last year according to Dv away shown 27th against the run. So it's definitely the way to exploit them in the, this new revamped mauling offensive line of the New York giants. It's going to come out and smash some heads. Next up, Shawn Tampa, the Jamis Winston lists Tampa Bay Buccaneers led by Ryan Fitz Fitzpatrick. They head down to the Dome in New Orleans where New Orleans is laying 10 minus five 20 on the money line, three 95 for the bucks, 49 and a half is your total.

Speaker 5:          01:00:29       That total seems low. I know it's high but it's 49 and a half second highest total on the board, uh, tied with the Rams Oakland game and then still seems low. Yeah, it does it and I think peanut mentioned it. I know I got a lot of guys in DFS calm for the saints. This Tampa Bay team is just dog shit. All right. Is there not a narrative where it's like there's a narrative for sure that a Tampa Bay, Gerald McCoy makes a couple plays. They got defensive touchdown. I, I randomly have a soft spot for Fitzsimmons but I don't think it's Patrick Fitzpatrick. Sorry. I love that guy. He went to Harvard. Ryan as they bring up every other time. It's this guy went to Hamad. He is a is a smack.

Speaker 5:          01:01:20       Nice accent was horrible. I'm going to take the saints minus 10 air. I, part of me would like to take a divisional game and take the big number, but I'm just so against this Tampa Bay team. I just don't see it man. Why? I just don't see it. And I think uh, they're loaded. Tampa Bay, Cameron Bray, Oj Howard Godwin. Evan's the Sean Jackson. Yeah, they have, they have skilled position player running backs. A bit of a question often. Some wine, a little bit of a question. The defense has players. This just strikes me as the kind of game, kind of like the buffalo one where maybe I come after two of these spots and I hit one but I, I one of these two teams is not covering. Now the thing I'll say about the saints, the saints have the offense to manage this and that. That would be my hesitation and I this, this is by no means a game that I'm looking to play. But again, 10 points, it's a of points. I'm

Speaker 1:          01:02:20       going to take the dog. Aww. Wow. You are extra chocky today. Sean, what do you mean? Just hoping that the uh, the league continues. Like last year I took the 40 niners catching six and a half. I took the eagles again. Another contrary in play for some reason. Well you're, you're certainly on the public side and this one 80% almost 80% on the saints. It is early in the week though. So some of these numbers don't mean that much. Next up, Shaun Hughston Mellow Brian, a little, a little big brother game here heading up to New England where Belichick and the Patriots are laying six and a half minus two 70 plus two 10 to 20 for the Texans. 51 is the total highest total on the board. As you were mentioning mentioning before, uh, Texans are actually getting some love right and everyone's kind of talking about how getting some love, I mean listen now that now that gambling is legal and a lot of states and fantasy football and that I think fantasy football is having to even a bigger impact in this line plot.

Speaker 1:          01:03:24       I mean everyone has a hard offer to Sean Watson. Again, great guy, great player, but he was three and three, right? Like this is a tough spot to go into New England and beat the Patriots coming off a loss we mentioned with bill, but Bella check is coming off a loss. I think the Patriots perpetually find motivation and the, I think that's as much as it pains me to say this, I think that's kind of their greatest asset is they've in this five super bowl run, they found ways to stay motivated if they don't get complacent and I don't think they're going to be complacent at home opening day against the Texans and Bella check just doesn't get beat by his assistance. Like it just doesn't happen. He doesn't, I know we're talking about a spread here. We're not, we're not picking games straight up like uh, Lee Corso and those guys, they are on the college game day.

Speaker 1:          01:04:17       Yeah. Someone, someone tweeted out, they go wow people and wonder why they're waiting. Wondering why the ratings are down. They're picking, yeah. Like 28 point spreads straight up and the acting like they have some sort of insight. This is a, you know, this is going to be a 31 17 game. I, I as much as you could make a case for a Houston's defense and the fact that they're completely healthy and how they could kind of wreck the shop of New England. I'll say this about New England. Look what they did against the eagles. The Eagles hadn't really could defense going into that super bowl and they gave Brady a bunch of time. I mean obviously Brady dropped a wide open pass and Brady fumbled the ball away when he, when they did get to him and they basically made that one play that they needed to beat them. But New England schemed up a good game and I just can't imagine Bellacheck having the whole off season stewing about that super bowl loss and he's going to lose to a guy he used to be his boss. That's a tough scenario for me to swallow. And I mean, you know, we had

Speaker 5:          01:05:18       a doctor, we had an actual doctor on talking about the coming back from the knee injury. And I think regardless of how well, how, if he can play or not, he's not going to be 100% and with a guy like the Sean Watson, I think you have to worry that, you know, part of what makes him great is his ability to do great things and he does a lot of those great things with his leg. So will that be the same? Will the offensive line hold up? You can say a lot of the same things about the patriots, the differences that Belichick and Brady, I'm a track record of doing more with less. I may be wrong here, but I'm not going to come out of the gate going against the Patriots, especially when I, when I can lay less than a touchdown against the team that I think, you know, look, here's, think he'd be a really good team and drop this game by 17 points.

Speaker 5:          01:06:02       So I'm with you, Sean. We're, we're both on New England, lock it up. Last of the early camps and maybe another game that none of us will give a shit about. Tennessee. The Tennessee Titans head down in Miami where Miami is a two point home dog. 45 is the total. I didn't see him money on it. They do not have a money line up on this over at my bookie, 45 is the total. Sean, you got a, you got to look at, you got to look at Miami early in the season, just like we're going to talk about in a couple of games with another team. Early season home field advantage, I think you could apply temperature and humidity, humidity and someone's gonna ease. You know you're going to be like, well Tennessee, it's humid there. It's not Miami.

Speaker 1:          01:06:47       Marcus Mariota is not good. Why am I the only guy who sees that and I fucking crazy

Speaker 5:          01:06:52       and it's another Bella check disciple who, I mean these guys don't, Bella check doesn't let them do like he lets them do stuff but he doesn't actually like share the intelligence. So none of these guys have really succeeded.

Speaker 1:          01:07:06       I had a Marcus Mariota had more interceptions and touchdowns last year. Why are we still talking about this guy like he's a franchise quarterback cause he's the ruins touchdown to himself. That was awesome. And yet he was in a great situation. Andy Reid in the playoffs, they found a way to fuck that up. If Travis Kelsey doesn't have his brain pushed in. Seriously, that was the turning point. That was the turning point to the game. This, this Tennessee team, Marcus ferry road is not a winner. I, I really don't like Miami, but I like Miami and the spot Ryan, we talked about how September's the new preseason football and to not overreact. Our Buddy, uh, bill burr even said it. Oh, week one, everyone's getting his lock was that week one. Everyone's going to be, all the talking heads are going to be fired up and making broad crazy statements for the season. And I think the fact that Miami will win this game, we'll win it by a decent margin and then all of a sudden become the sleeper darling, I think will eventually fall off. I know it's kind of crazy to predict that, but I, I like mammy and the spot, but I don't like the dolphins

Speaker 5:          01:08:12       for the season. Yeah, I think I, I think I agree with everything

Speaker 1:          01:08:16       you said. I, I,

Speaker 5:          01:08:18       I don't think the dolphins, it was surprising for me to see that 65% of the money. I'm a dolphins again early in the week. This is not a heavily back game, so the number doesn't mean a ton to me, but surprise to see that and

Speaker 1:          01:08:31       I mean this is,

Speaker 5:          01:08:34       I don't, I don't know. I got to see Tennessee do something honestly like Miami. I know you're low on Miami, I'm hiring Miami, but I think, I just think this is one of the games that they get as a, when they shouldn't be a two point dog to Tennessee that that's, that's really what this comes down to Sean.

Speaker 1:          01:08:50       Great. Next up early.

Speaker 5:          01:08:54       Oh afternoon kicks here on the West Coast, Kansas City heads to Los Angeles, Sean and the soccer stadium where the chargers are laying three and a half points minus one 85 on the money line plus one 55 for the new look chiefs 48 the total you back in the homes and as a first real start.

Speaker 1:          01:09:16       Yeah, I keep going back and forth on this one

Speaker 5:          01:09:20       because this is another one. Uh, Kansas City is, this is a very, uh, like kind of the stereotypical pros versus joes game.

Speaker 1:          01:09:29       The Publix on Sandy Arab. I said, there it is. The public's on Los Angeles, Sean Sandy Bay and the pros are on Kansas City. This number's probably too big. Yeah, it is a divisional game. I don't love. It's going to feel a little bit like, Oh, I'm game. Here's, here's, here's where I'm looking at of this game. I really like the over. That's what I really like in this game because I think Kansas City's defense can't stop anyone and I think the chargers will put up a lot of points. What I'm scared about is Andy read having a bunch of time to scheme up some stuff that uh, I think we'll put the chargers, you know, we'll fuck the chargers up and also the charges are just such a snake bitten franchise. But at the end of the day, I'm going to go, I'm going to go chargers minus three and a half.

Speaker 1:          01:10:25       I've debated this a lot. I just moved my pick on the spreadsheet charges minus three and a half. And that's because Joey Bosa, Melvin Ingram against Patrick, my homes and Patrick my homes. I think we'll end up being a good quarterback in this league. However you watch any, any of his early stuff, he's turnover prone, right? He'll give you a couple of big plays and that's again, why I like the over. I think if you look at uh, a fantasy defense, I think there's a defensive touchdown possible for this Los Angeles chargers team. And I think that'll end up being the difference and why they covered the spread. If it gets close, obviously there's a chance Casey wins out, right? Because of how snake bitten this chargers team is and Kansas City has plenty of weapons. So there's definitely a case to be made for the chiefs. But I'll, I'll lean

Speaker 5:          01:11:14       chargers here. Yeah, I mean again, this is there another team where they then this defense got so much better last year they brought in the kid from Florida state cane to play say they have the pass rush and uh, but they, they, they struggled to stop the run. And if you were to highlight a weakness of this defense last year it was stopping the run and you know, they, they, the teams that we're able to kind of beat him up and run on them and you, you, you take Bosa out of the game. Yeah. And I think as much as I don't like the chiefs, this, how does, how much does Andy Reid actually commit to the run? I think he know he is just, he's just sitting there with the on waiting unleased homes. Well you haven't even mentioned the coaching disadvantage that answered your own has read is one 70% he's seven and three straight up Sean.

Speaker 5:          01:12:08       We've been rolling though. College football, we're, we're, we forgot about the spreads in the NFL. Like you can't just throw a three and a half and a divisional game where you don't have any home field advantage. You'd be like, that's cool. I know my homes is going to turn the turn the ball over, but it's the NFL like this. We're not going to see all these crazy blowouts. This is going to sound really bad when we just see a whole bunch of, but Ryan, Ryan, Ryan, the exception is your, I think if you take the chiefs I respect that pick in that plight, but you're underestimating how dog shit. The Kansas City chiefs defense in particular. The secondary is, I don't, I hate doing the double negative, but I don't disagree Sean. I just don't, we, we spent the whole preseason talking about their lack of a home field and how many chiefs fans are going to be showing up to this game and I like the chargers that have a chance to win this game.

Speaker 5:          01:13:02       I just can't lay three and a half. They're going to miss a kick. They're going to do something that fucks it up. Give me Kansas City plus the points here. Okay. Just update Eric Berry. This is from coach Andy Reid. He's day to day. It's not looking good. Oh No. The chiefs turned over their entire secondary shedding. Six cornerbacks from last year and plan to start Ron Parker at one of the two safety spots. Eric Berry's not going to play from my, from my knowledge. And I think that'll be a big passing day for Philip and company. So look, start Keenan Allen. I mean if you play in Tonio gates, you I think crazy, crazier stuff. I think you target this game for DFS period. And I didn't say DFS is the Er over as the play in this game. See I, I'll go the other way. I think it's so obviously an over.

Speaker 5:          01:13:56       I'm gonna take the under. I think I, I'm telling you man, like I just want to, I want to be contrarian for these early this, this week. While you're not very contrarian around, I guess you do have the giants of the bucks. I'll give you that. And Buffalo. Yeah, I, I have some unpopular pics. I don't feel, I can't, I, the chargers are definitely the, the, the, the public and more popular side. So I have it there too. Next up, Sean, one 25 kick here on the west coast. Seattle. I guess they're all, Thomas is playing. We don't know either way. Either way. Russell, the love muscle will lead the Seahawks down into Denver or case Kanombe in the Broncos are laying three minus one 50 on the money line. Seattle plus one 30 43 is the total right. We've been talking, this came up enough.

Speaker 5:          01:14:49       They had Denver minus three add home Emmanuel Sanders case keen. Emma like that option obviously for all Thomas plays and is 100%. Well I guess we'll see. But Denver at home early is a huge advantage. Again, the collective bargaining agreement doesn't allow these guys to quite get their conditioning right. And uh, I just, Seattle probably not a great team. Maybe. Maybe they pull this out cause they do have the best player probably on the field. Russel Wilson. But I feel good about Denver Minister. Yeah. Not much to say here. Uh, I, I, I like Russell Wilson to have a good year. Statistically, I hopefully bald and we can stay healthy. I just think this is a bad spot. I think the defense is going to struggle. There's no way Earl Thomas, this is just going to play right? May I guess, who knows? Who knows? There's no way he can be ready to play at altitude.

Speaker 5:          01:15:41       Yeah. At altitude. I do worry about case Keenum but I, I liked the receivers they put around him. I liked the Royce Freeman kid. I think they're going to, I think they could do something on offense and I know they're going to be good at defense. So Denver is very obvious to me. Shawn and I, and I don't think we mentioned this, Sean, but these lines, these are the free roll football contest lines. So if you're hearing the number and you like the side, go sign up contest dot sports gambling podcast.com. And if you want to bet these lines, go to my bookie that Aig promocode, SCP or STP reload. Get in the contest, get into awesome. You're not, you're not going to. Me and Sean are going to slay everyone. I'm predicting a top two finish for us. I love it. Next up Shawn, another one, 25 kicked Dallas and the cowgirls Jason traveling with his shine box. I'll go home and get your fucking shine box. Does he checked the shine box? Is it carry on? Uh, Dallas is heading the Carolina and to take on your boy Cam Newton as minus Carolina's minus three minus one 45 on the money line. One 25 for the cowboys, 42 and a half. This is an awfully low total. Um, it, it, it's interestingly low Carolina roles. Carolina roles and I don't like Cam Newton again. I was the one who came up with Sham Newton. Don't try and steal that from me. That is intellectual property

Speaker 1:          01:17:10       over time. I like how you get more and more aggressive at, you're claiming of the nickname sham noon, Dallas name one matchup that the cowboys have better. Listen, Luke Keekley is healthy. He hasn't gotten a concussion yet at Kara. Dallas has no one to catch a pass. Carolina's just gonna Stack the box. Yeah. They have so much more weapons on the offensive side. Cam Newton, as much as I don't like him personally is a better quarterback is a playmaker. Why would this be even on a neutral field? I will say this, the potential strength of the Dallas defense is those linebackers. And if those linebackers can cover the combination of Greg Olson and Christian McCaffrey, it becomes an interesting game. But again, Dallas is offense is or their strength is their offensive line and they're not going to get that same push with all the injuries. The classic, it's a three point spread.

Speaker 1:          01:18:03       It probably, I guess it could be, uh, you know, to me, Carolina, Dallas is closer to three and a half then chargers chiefs. So I will lay the points with Carolina. Um, not, not to mention, I just, you know, we got to see, I mean we need to see the cowboys offensive line do something too. So it's cowboys could roll, but I'm taking Carolinas, came on Austin starting receiver. Look, someone has to catch the ball. I don't know if you've watched the NFL in the past 30 years. Allen Hurns, Allen Hurns that that's the DFS guy this week. Sean, last of the late afternoon kicks, early afternoon here on the west coast. The Washington to professional football team, they had to Arizona for Bradford is not a fucking franchise quarterback. Arizona is very excited to say Redskins. Uh, Arizona minus one 44 is the total.

Speaker 1:          01:19:01       I'm very torn here. Sean. Yeah, I know. I'm the same way because Sam Bradford, as much as he sucks, he has randomly showed up at a dome in a week one home. Um, but I, I'm going to feed them. I actually think David Johnson, we'll have a good game. So I do like that on the DFS side, but I think the skins pull this one out as a, I'm not super high on the skins, but Alex Smith, and again, sometimes you just don't have to overthink it. Alex Smith is a guy who wins games and Sam Bradford is the guy who loses games to Alex Smith 88 62 and one as a starter. I know you're not going to look at some crazy trends, but I think they have a very conservative game plan. I'm really worried about Arizona's defense as far as what they can trot out there, especially in week one. And I think David Johnson again has it has a good game, especially from Ppr because he's just going to get a shitload of targets and maybe that's enough. Maybe he breaks some but gun to my head or I'm going to take the, uh, the Redskins here mean I

Speaker 5:          01:20:08       guess so. Sure. Arizona could be bad. I think that's the consensus is Arizona is going to be pretty bad but, but it is Sam Bradford and it, it is the first game of the season and he is healthy and he has had good games in the first game even as recently as last year. So, uh, I don't know why. I don't know what's wrong with you Sean. Cause you're, you're backing Gruden on the road anchored and baby Jay Gruden. Yeah, sure. Alex Smith was great with Andy Reid, but we've seen quarterbacks leave Andy read before and it's not so pretty. No one's really talking about that. That is not a narrative. Right. When you go for, when you leave, when you go, when you go from a quarterback guru to a self proclaimed quarterback guru. I Dunno if that's the best thing. Look, I don't think the Redskins are going to be horrible.

Speaker 5:          01:21:00       I think this is just a tough spot and I like, dare I say Bradford to have a decent game here. Can me the cardinals minus one chigger not a great coach, but possibly better than Stephen Wilkes. We don't know. He was a good d coordinator for the panthers, right? What? Right. It was all right. The giants wanted I, there were rumors that giants wanted to hire him and I was very happy they didn't. They got a Shermer. All right, John Prime time, Sunday night football bears, packers, Lambeau field, Greenbay minus seven and a half minus three 45 on the money line plus two 75 for the bears. 47 and a half is the total. That's a lot of fucking points, right? A little too big. You see this news, Sean, what the rams aggressively, aggressively went after. Clear clue Mac. Uh, right before the Paris traded for him am I don't know where they're getting all this money. Did they get to some sort of tax exemption when they moved to Los Angeles? Um, that, that would have been pretty interesting. But yeah, the bears. Is Matt going to be a difference maker?

Speaker 1:          01:22:09       Listen, I don't think that bears defense. Was that bad to begin with? And if you throw Kahleel backin yeah, I think they're going to be better. I think, uh, I think Nagy decent coach, he has a scheme that they haven't seen before. Again, you're going against Green Bay at home, so I'm not taking them to win. Probably not. But yeah, Chicago can keep this a one score game. Why do we, why isn't it naggy going to be good? Like why isn't somatically going to be good? Does that automatically going to be good Ryan? But I'm predicting that he learned how to scheme up quarterbacks in the same way that Doug Peterson came from the Andy Re coaching tree and went to Philadelphia and and took a rookie quarterback and developed a great system for him, which helped lead them ultimately to a super bowl championship. I think the Arizona or sorry, I think that Nagy can help to ski a and they have some, they have some play makers around him. I think Jordan Howard, solid player. I think he could have a big season Terico and may still get a few catches in there. Trey Burton,

Speaker 5:          01:23:16       again,

Speaker 1:          01:23:16       it's the kind of guy you want in a Andy Reid type system. I think all that leads to a, a competitive bears team and I think the team is excited, right? The bears are jacked up. Listen, Green Bay at home and prime time. It's tough to go against some shit up, but I think seven, I think this is a game, so I'll take seven and a half. They're trapping you with the hook, Sean, because you know what still true. Very sure it happened. Mitchell [inaudible] still sucks. Yeah, I know. Why has that changed? We, we did this for five months, no football and all of, I did have John Fox.

Speaker 5:          01:23:49       All of a sudden, Mitch,

Speaker 1:          01:23:51       I washed and playing college. Dude. He said two full years of playing football. Lay the points. Give me Aaron Rodgers in total feu mode. Come on, do this at 10 point game, you can see it. So it's a possibility. I mean, if someone teased green bay down from seven and a half, have minus one and a half. That's not a bad teas. But I'm finishing strong with some favorite Sean. Next up the jets on the early, the stupid early Monday night football game. We'll rex rex Ryan be calling this game. No, he will not. The Jerry's Rex Ryan, I thought he was, wasn't calling mine somewhere. The jets had to Detroit where Matt Stafford and the lions are minus seven minus two 80 on the money line plus two 30 for the jets. 45 is the total Shaun Stafford beats bad teams that he does what Willy Cover? No, he will not. Wow. Save Your Sam and the New York jets. I liked this jet steam, rookie quarterback, rookie quarterback, youngest quarterback to start,

Speaker 5:          01:24:54       but

Speaker 1:          01:24:55       uh, younger, uh, to start like a Monday night game or I don't know, whatever the stat was. He's, he's only 21 not 22 yet. The guy has composure in the pocket. I like what I've seen at a Sam Darnold. They have skill players,

Speaker 5:          01:25:07       right? They have

Speaker 1:          01:25:08       skilled players. I think their defense is good enough.

Speaker 5:          01:25:11       Tadpoles,

Speaker 1:          01:25:11       Anne. Okay. Coach he is to me is the jet Superbowl. I love fading them next week on a short week with Sam Darnold, but I think same. Donald makes enough place to keep them in this game. This is tough, Sean, because Detroit is the kind of team that you would want to fade when they're laying seven points. Yes. It is a strangely early kick. Will everyone be there? Yeah. It's Detroit, so no one has a job. Is that what you're trying to insinuate? Oh, c'mon. Right. All right. You make enemies not booming, but I think if you're going to a lions game, you're, you're available at six, 10:00 PM on a Monday. Is it six 10? Aren't they eastern or maybe they're seven 10 the right on that edge. I think it's seven 10 either way they're going to be at the game or whoever's going to show up to the game. I, I like Sam Darnold here. You saw it with Wentz. You saw it with some other rookie quarterbacks. There's an early window before they kind of hit that rookie wall before enough tape gets out on them were guys who can play in the league really thrive and they ended up winning because they make a bunch of crazy plays. He'll make some plays at this feet. I'll kind of be playing above his head. He'll kind of crashed down to earth, but I could see Sam Darnold getting out to a hot start.

Speaker 5:          01:26:29       I just don't see, this is another game where I'm just inclined to take, it's hard for me to to take chalk on Monday night, but that's where I think I want to go. Gimme gimme Stafford and the fighting lions. Okay.

Speaker 11:         01:26:44       Staff.

Speaker 5:          01:26:46       I mean, come on dude. You're the rookie is going to get it. It's a dome road. I just don't, I don't see, I don't see him being successful right away. I think there's too many stories and too much about his inconsistencies. I know he's looked good in the pre season, but this is one of those like not so fast moments. Last game of the week, Sean let her rep the awkwardly late game on on the, on the east coast, the rams, they head down to Oakland where John Ruetten. Yeah. It depends which way you're looking at it. They had up to Oakland where Oakland and Jon Gruden art, four and a half point home dogs. Sean, this, this line opened I think in a pick to put it in perspective and it's just been bet by the rams over and over and over. All Rams money. 96% Sean, 96%

Speaker 11:         01:27:41       Aye.

Speaker 1:          01:27:42       We were, I mean there's no way 96% of the monies on one side. It's gone from pick to four and a half. Yeah. Do you like the Raiders? Four and a half points in the NFL is a lot. I'm just so, I so much want to take, I want to say I want to Fade Jan grid. If John Gruden they come out and they look amazing and their defense plays great in spite of the fact of being Natika defense and the, and then getting rid of Cleo Mack. I'll eat some crow, fill me up with a big bowl, bull crow. But uh, I think, I think the rams can handle Todd Gurley who's tackling Todd Gurley on this rams defense

Speaker 5:          01:28:22       conference road game. The lines moved four and a half points and I still that that's how bad this is. Like

Speaker 1:          01:28:30       plenty of warnings as far as why you shouldn't take this. But uh, yeah, give me the ransom at it's four and a half. I just don't see it with Oakland. I just don't see it. Koons coming in. She changing the culture of firing video coordinators who've been there for years and Kinda reminds me of chip Kelly. But I don't think they, I don't think he has the athletes and we're the brain. I like, I like Wade Phillips and that defense versus John Group. Right. So if the, the raters do win the game, it's by them. And I just

Speaker 5:          01:29:02       don't see how that happens. He's already not looked smart. It's just he's come off really poorly. Yeah. Sorry, I'm just fading, you know. I'm sorry if I want to feed him and Hugh Jackson Week one. Although I, I would, I will lie. Tie Rod almost had me, he almost had me almost sucked. The Iran is a time. Yeah, that's right Ryan. It is time for our lock dog and tees of course. Brought to you by my book. Eat Daddy g Kramer. I'll give you the honors lock. Denver. Yes. Pretty obvious. I grabbed this at two earlier in the summer. Uh, I still like it a three. I think this Seattle team, perhaps a lot of questions and not, not the pass rush you want to see week one when you have a questionable offensive line for my dog, Sean. I didn't, I don't feel like I took a lot of dogs in that actual like, oh, they could win this game range and I'm not going to give you the eagles or the giants. So

Speaker 5:          01:30:13       I'll get, I'll, I'll throw the complete like this. This is the game and I believe we were out in Vegas together, Sean, when the, uh, the saints were hosting the rams and we were sitting near a guy who had a $10,000 wager and, and w on like a minus 500 bet and lost. Yeah, it was pretty awesome. Not recommended in the NFL taken minus 500 Tampa Bay. Wow. Strange feeling about this one. Super strange feeling about this one. Uh, and I, and I just like, I honestly, I was going to throw out the giants, but you were gonna you would give me shit for that. No, I mean if you're scared of me giving you shit and yeah, no, no, no, no. I, I'm, I'm going to throw out, I'm going to go to a cop. I'm going to go big week one and give you a four to one dog all and everyone can come back and stroke it. I will say this, I will say this survival, like I'm not getting near, I'm not getting near the saints and the survivor pool. I'm not teasing the saints this week. That came worries me and a from its speaking of teas is Sean first up, bring New England down to minus 600 or two minus a half, right? Yup. Step one, step two

Speaker 11:         01:31:28       bring,

Speaker 5:          01:31:30       bring Detroit down to minus one because we know what Stafford does against bad teams. He just wins. Step three you bring green bay down to one and a half. No Way. You, no way. This goes in here. No Way. This goes wrong for you. It will not go wrong. It's too too well. I feel like getting the Detroit angle in there. I'm going to have to sweat it to Monday and I, but that's my t's New England minus a half Detroit minus one green minus one

Speaker 1:          01:32:00       and a half. All right. I'm on the clock. Carolina. My Loc so many. I mean I love feeding the cowboys, but so much just the matchups alone panthers all the way. No one's going to listen to this lock this week because you're going against the cowboys. Well, I mean I, well that's their loss run. I Agree Jeff. Just letting you know the jets plus two 30. I think they shock the world Monday night. Shit gets crazy in Detroit. Gimme the jets and save your Sam my teeth. If you're Sam, you just love saying that. It is fun to say I'll take a Baltimore down to minus two. That's good. I will take New England down to minus a half. That's the one that's going to fuck both and uh, he kicked me Washington up to seven mm smart adjustment there. Shown what you see what he did. He took it through three key numbers.
