Speaker 1:          00:00:02       Hey, what's going on? Is Bill burn his time for the Monday morning podcast from Monday, uh, June 25th, 2018 what's going on? I whoa. Yo, how you doing? How you doing with the, the summer, the summer's here, right? We're in the, we're in the twenties of June. Somewhere along the lines of first day of summer. You know, back in the day, used to know it right? Because there wasn't as many channels and you would watch the local news and they'd bring it up. Tonight is the first day of summer. Tell us, Jack, what can people look forward to weather wise? While I'll tell you a bike. We got a low pressure. Says, look, Google it. It's so don't inflate those fucking above ground pools. Yes. Yep. Um, and then they'd laugh for no reason. Your weekend's going to suck. Um, anyways, uh, it's gotta be a summertime, right? The fucking son's out.

Speaker 1:          00:00:56       There you go right there. Global warming. Um, what'd you do this weekend? I have a couple, of course, like that's his generation's Budweiser, Coors light. They're crushing it. You know, Peyton Manning's fucked up. You notice the second Peyton manning fucking bought Budweiser. Now it's second place. You know, you didn't buy it. He bought into it the second he fucking God. And I bet he started pointing fingers at everybody. You know, we, we, we got, we had some hops issues, right? And all of a sudden, nobody's getting along over there and of course lights now cause lights ahead. Right? I Bet Tom Brady invested in concourse lite. Sorry. Why would I do this? I like Peyton manning now that he's retired. You know, I could look back and be like, you know what, that fellow was sat quite quarterback, but when they're playing against your team, you hate him. It's stupid.

Speaker 1:          00:01:47       You know, you don't hate them. You just, hey, it's weird. Um, anyways, uh, the summers here I am back from vacay shawl and a, I'm getting ready this weekend. Oh, freckles. Shaking off the cobwebs. I'm going to be in Minneapolis, Minnesota, in Detroit, Michigan. Okay. A couple, uh, Joe, six pack towns, you know, where they put their pet to one leg at a thought. Uh, looking forward to that and a, so I'm going to be around La doing a bunch of spots, shaking off the dust. I'm on the elliptical, working off the cholesterol panel. Shock a lot. I never had any of those, you know, my wife's into those fucking things I liked. I like the plain old boring white guy croissant. I don't need any flavor. Uh, anyways. Oh my God. Um, I don't want to talk about this early on, but I have to out of respect, uh, to sad, sad, sad, sad day.

Speaker 1:          00:02:52       Uh, the passing of V, the Great Vinnie Paul, um, drummer of obviously Pantera damaged blend and hell yeah, good Lord. What a, what a loss. Can't even, can't even put it into words. And I was lucky enough to meet him. He was a big comedy fan and I remember the first time I met him, I was opening for the late Great Charlie Murphy. This is what happens when you get older. Like half your stories is like half the people in a more like fucking dead. It's sucks. Um, but anyways, yeah, me, Charlie and Danelle or on tour. And we did the Addison Improv and, uh, I remember that that was one of those shows, one of the few times I ever, I went over without even realizing it. I always knew when I was going over, but I did like 40 minutes and I was supposed to be like 25.

Speaker 1:          00:03:44       It just one of those that just let, there was talking and I don't know what happened. And, um, Charlie was cool with it, but I was in Paris because I never do that shit. And it's a real country thing to do and it's something, you know, mixed. The headline is job more difficult because you ate up all of that extra time wearing them out and all of that shit. So, uh, I do remember that from that weekend, but one of those shows, it wasn't the show and I went over, but, uh, I was standing after the show, selling my cds. This is how long ago this was. It was right around, uh, it was 2004. His brother was still alive. Um, and I was just standing there and I just looked up and he, and he was standing right there, Finney fucking Paul. And you know, it wasn't like he was Vinnie Paul offstage.

Speaker 1:          00:04:32       He just was Vinnie Paul. He had the fucking cowboy hat on, you know, this shirt with flames on it and shit, these crazy cowboy boots and he's just standing of the big smile on his face. And I was just like, oh, I mean, this guy, he's like, guys saw on the cover of modern drummer. I couldn't believe it. I was like, I was like, Holy Shit in fucking Vinny Foley. You started laughing and you know, it was super complimentary about the show and all that. And then he invited us out. Uh, he had his own club out there, gentleman's club, then we all went out there and he was nice enough, I actually sat with him in his club for like 45 minutes, like a total drum nerd and asked them all of these questions about, um, Trump parts that he did. And, and, um, like, who were the guys that he listened to?

Speaker 1:          00:05:30       And, uh, and, you know, I asked and I said, you know, who do you think only one of the underrated drummers out there? And he was like, Oh, Alex van Halen, you know, and we went on and on about him. It's kind of ironic because I really feel that Vinnie and dime bag where the Eddie and Alex, I should say Alex and Eddie of their generation. And um, it just sucks man. He was just such a nice guy. And then after that, uh, he probably came out to two or three other shows and he always was smiling, always was just the greatest, nicest guy. And, um, it's, I dunno, one of the reasons why I never got into double bass playing was because so many people, I just felt like once, like they all have fills, everything was just their fucking feet and their hands stunk and it didn't groove.

Speaker 1:          00:06:17       It just was going nine zillion miles an hour. And, you know, it was impressive to look at, but it didn't, it didn't give me the chills. It didn't make me want to do it. And he was a guy that changed that. And I, I, when I listened to him play, um, my younger brothers who were independent, Tara, I fucked up. I never saw him a, I remember one of my brothers went to go see him, was telling me how amazing the show is. But to be honest with you, like I, I just, you know, conscious with different, back then you could get fucked up at a concert and there was no cell phone footage. She just got fucked up and that was it. And there was like mosh pits. Like it just, it changed. And I got a little bit older. I was in my mid twenties, basically when they came around and I had already started doing standup and shit.

Speaker 1:          00:07:01       And um, you know, I remember going to a couple of, uh, you know, concerts like ACDC and shit and people were doing blow and it was, you know, it was a little fucking, you know, there was you, you had to be like a certain level of fucked up just so you could stay relaxed so you could kind of navigate it, you know what I mean? You couldn't be sitting there looking fucking nervous. And I, you know, and that was just it like ACDC, which was always like a fun show. So like put this pant, Tara came in. It was a new level of aggression and anger certainly, you know, with Phil singing, I had never heard anything like that. And um, you know, just the way I was just, I just had this feeling of my house. I was too afraid I was, I'm going to fucking going to go down there, my fucking orange hair trying to grow it out and it just gets bigger and bigger and it looked like Bernie from room to 22 and there's a mosh pit. I'm going to get the Sh, you know how I always got over with people was making them laugh and the show was going to be too fucking loud. So if they would just going to look at me the way I looked, I mean I would, I just felt like it wasn't going to go well.

Speaker 1:          00:08:05       So I was a fan from afar and I really fucked up by not seeing those guys. And, um, I remember when Vinny came down on the show, he said, hey, you know, I got this, this new, uh, this new band. I think it was. Yeah, it was, it was damaged plan. He said, we play in New York. He said, he goes, he goes, I'll hook you up. I said, really? He said, dude, he goes, you can fucking stand right behind me while I play the whole show. And of course, um, I had some fucking road gig when they came to town. I think Florentine went, cause I remember talking to him about it and I was so fucking envious that he got to go and I, I didn't get to go, so I never saw him play live. But, um, you know, since doing that Dean del Ray's show or I had to learn how to play a much, I butcher the sun, but I tried to learn how to play that song by Motley Crue live wire, which had the double bass, you know, basic thing in there.

Speaker 1:          00:08:58       Since then, I've just kinda gotten addicted to it. And I was listening to all of the Pantera stuff in a whole nother level. And um, you know, cowboys from Hell and fucking, uh, um, broken and this love, just loving the drum parts are just so fucking perfect in all of those. And I was just talking, I was talking to my drum teacher literally that day of how great, um, Finney Paul was, um, with his work in that band and, and then like it fuck, it was so weird that night. Then all of a sudden I got that text, I couldn't fucking believe it. And I'm Super Sad. But, um,

Speaker 1:          00:09:39       I don't know. Like the only good thing I could say is that got the mark that the guy left his, he, he won't be forgotten and obviously his brother hasn't been. So anyways, that's my little, my little point of view on a truly one of the great artists that I ever heard of or got to, I dunno, listen to whatever hang out with or anything. So, so that sucks. And that's sad. So I don't know where the fuck did go from here. How do you, how do you turn it back to being funny? You know, can I talk about the Germans playing the Swedes and the fucking, uh, do they play? Sweden is out or was it by the, the, the shirts for the same colors, their flags. So, um, I always fucked that up. Sweden, it's Switzerland because I'm an American and we never, they never taught us geography like that. And I remember one time I did a Gig in Sweden and I said, hey, it's great to be here in Switzerland. And they all laughed thinking I was joking and I honestly fucked it up and I just rolled with it. I was just like, Hey, just fucking with you. They both start with sw, but I, I did that the whole, thank you Cleveland. Whatever the fuck it was a spinal tap thing.

Speaker 1:          00:10:49       I got to get back there. I haven't done, um, what would you call that? Hitler's ranch up there. Norway, Sweden and Finland. All those places. When he used to look across the, was it the Baltic Sea? I don't know what the fuck it is. It's just look across that water. They're all desserts is what people should look like. Yeah. Frolicking in the grass. Um, anyways, um, tello swing, did you know, they, they, they were noncommittal a World War II ended up being a great fucking move. Not socially. It wasn't a good move, but it was a great fucking move financially. Cause just for the fact that they were still standing after World War II never got bombed. You know, let the, let the, let the crowds fucking use a train to go to Norway. MMM. They stood there. They're fucking apple piece was still open at the end of it, you know. So I mean, I, if I guess you can learn something from Sweden.

Speaker 2:          00:11:49       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:11:50       When Shit is hitting the fan and you to stand up and make a stand, don't let other people do it. Just kind of sit back and see who wins it. Ed, uh, carry on anyways, so the Swedes or play in Germany. All right. I'm mostly German, so I usually root for Germany.

Speaker 3:          00:12:15       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:12:17       Or whatever. Or I just root for an underdog. Like Iceland. I mean high enough fucking roof, Iceland and Poland and shit like that. You know, I'm rooting for all any anybody other than the powerhouses that always seem to be in an, I don't know shit about soccer. So this is, boy, it's going to make it funny. But anyway, so I'm watching this fucking game and this Swedish dude, right? Yeah. He's on a fucking break away going, God, he's all all alone. Right? And then this Joe Guy in the German team, a black dude, which is hilarious. You know what I mean? I was always just sitting there like, like how conflicted would Hitler be Germany one. But what's, what does the whole foods, is that outside, he comes down and goes to not only went to like trip the guy, he also cut, like just pushed him from behind and like, oh, fucking referee and the WWE, somehow this guy didn't see it.

Speaker 3:          00:13:16       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:13:16       I mean, I think it happened in the box, in the painted area, whatever the fuck they call it in that sport. And I think that that should have just been one of those fucking penalty kicks with a goalie. Just dives and guesses one side. Um, but anyways, the Swedes ended up going up one, nothing that Germans tied it up. And then this guy, he did the old bend it like Beckham did the old fucking a roundabout there. I don't know how to talk about the sport. Uh, but I got to tell you something. I actually,

Speaker 3:          00:13:49       okay,

Speaker 1:          00:13:50       I love making fun of soccer but I have to watch it in order to make fun of it. And now having watched it, I'm actually, I kind of love it now and I kind of understand the beauty of the game. Finally. I'm starting to get it and it is really cool that it is so hard to score that when it happens that people absolutely lose their fucking minds. So I am on board. I'm going to continue to make fun of it. I had it on in the background and you know, I had like fucking two weeks of male here that I was going through and um,

Speaker 3:          00:14:19       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:14:19       And the amount of times that I just kept looking over at the TV cause he knows he'd be like, oh, oh, he's going to be sick.

Speaker 4:          00:14:36       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:14:36       So I was sitting at the table going like, oh my God. Oh, something almost happened. That's what it just seemed like. Um,

Speaker 3:          00:14:46       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:14:46       But it really is a great game. Uh, GI bill. Yeah. You really, uh, you know, you, the rest of the world is right, Bill. And you might be wrong on this one. Um, but I missed it today. A good friend of mine wrote in a Protean sent me a text and I'm in podcast mode. She sent me a text message and asked me if I had saw the, um, England play today. I guess they played a great game. And I heard Mexico had a pretty scrappy game with the Koreans heard it was getting a little nasty. They're like, the Koreans would desperate like, oh, we don't give a fuck. You know, we can't score unless we have the ball. Uh, you know, I guess Mexico's fast. That's what I know. And I promise you this week I'm going to neglect all my responsibilities and I'm going to try to watch some of this shit cause uh, it is, it is fun. Go once every four years, the entire world gets together to play for an actual world championship is pretty, that's pretty sick. You know, I just wish I could use their hands. You just see that one Connie fucking jumped over the guy and accidentally kicked him in the face. I mean that's gotta be like,

Speaker 2:          00:15:50       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:15:50       Kicking a guy on the ground in the face, in the realm of like losing your man card forever. Like, who fuck who does that with your shoes on leash, you can be barefoot. So maybe make you foot sting a little bit. Um, I would be so disappointed if I had a fucking son and he ended up playing soccer. First of all, I'd be happy for his brain, but you know, if that's what he did,

Speaker 1:          00:16:15       you're going to frolic down the field and jump in the air like some baby deer and then kick somebody in the face. Um, knowing like the guy does, he takes out a yellow card. I hate the way they take it out in the guy just stands up in front of the guy, the stupid thing up in the air, like he's bidding on a fucking Shelby. Um, anyways, congratulations to anybody you want. Uh, I got to get into it. Sorry. I did watch the, uh, the one finally I was in town. I got to watch her watch the French GP. Congratulations to Lewis Hamilton. Max Verstappen was fucking hilarious in the press conference afterwards. Uh, cause federal slammed into botox back. She was going, you know, I think he needs, you guys should tell him he needs to adjust his style because they were given Max Shit, you know, beginning of the year.

Speaker 1:          00:17:03       I forget. He took out his own teeth, took out a, what's his face there? Um, Daniel Ricardo and they gave him all this shit does, does he need to adjust his style? All these fucking assholes who don't drive for a living. So he was trashing all of them go and you should tell Vettel. Yeah, you should tell him he needs to do it justice style and then he shouldn't adjusted at all the way I didn't adjust my style. And now here I sit three races in a row, whatever on the fucking podium. You fucking cunt Kimmy ragged. They kept bringing up the, this is his 25th, the 26th podium without winning a race. It's like this guy's fucking Lewis Hamilton went because of Louis samples at my kid's sleeping. It's cause fucking Lewis Hamilton wins every God damn week. Okay. That's like giving somebody shit who played when Michael Jordan was at the height of his powers.

Speaker 2:          00:17:50       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:17:50       He never got a ring. Nobody got a ring. You know, I've got to ring Olijahwaun would fucking, Jordan was playing basketball and then when he was a little out of shape the next year, other than that, everybody got shut the fuck down. All right. That's what happens. So what Ha, what, what needs to happen is the next, uh, the next Drake great driver has to come around. And also for one, my, what I little know about the sport is they got to fucking get with either Mercedes and Ferrari. Basically. Mercedes, it seems to have the fastest car out there cause I think, what's this? I think Daniel Ricardo was gonna fucking, he's going to jump somewhere, right? That's what they say. Um, by like both those drives and I'll put the eggs, how the Americans will be coming, like six to seventh. We've got some points and our gray cars or overcast cars.

Speaker 1:          00:18:42       Um, what else did I do here? Oh, I got back on my fucking diet. This has been tough. It's been tough to get back on the Diet. I fell the capes I fucking hate over in France, you know, and a couple of slip ups, but at back to the keen one, um, hitting the elliptical. Oh God. The first two minutes of getting on the elliptical, my age, Jesus Christ. After that I just kind of go numb and then it's fine. I listed my fucking songs and then it's over. But, um, I finally got the shoulder thing B and uh, I have, I think I have to join a gym though because in order to rehab my shoulder where I can do pull ups again, I got to do those, those fucking lat pull downs with like 20 pounds and then 30 and work my way up to my body weight and then I can attempt to do like a pull up because what I did last time when I rehabbed it was I then got these like those help or bands, you know, that you stand on and make the pull up easier. But I was still, you know, trying to pull up, you know, 90 a hundred pounds with the weight and I fucking Jack my shoulder against, so I got to do what I don't want to do. I've got to go join a fucking gym, so I got to find a local gym, not a fucking, uh,

Speaker 1:          00:19:55       a chain. What? Cause those are the ones, they get your credit card and then you can't fucking get out of it. I've been tell you that time I went to Bally's,

Speaker 1:          00:20:04       I joined Bally's and there was like trying to fucking leave AOL. You just couldn't do it. They'd be, oh okay Cindy in a hundred dollar cancellation fee. And then I sent it in and then they go, oh yeah, yeah, but there's another, there's another gym within like a five mile radius. So you can't cancel like, oh and I was to put the fuck, he just, he just took $100 from me. I should have sued the fucking shit out of him. And I, and I didn't. So I just didn't pay him. I just, you know, I did, I cancelled the credit card. That was the only way out and it was, it was quiet for months. I didn't hear from anybody. And then all of a sudden this collection agency called me up, the only anti he was William burned the hair please. And I'm like this, hey. They're like, Hey, this is showing show from the show and show collection agency. We bought your dead from Bally's total fitness and would like to discuss it with you. And I was just like, well, I don't know what the hell you did that for. You know, I didn't pay them. What, what the hell, but why would I pay you? I don't even know you,

Speaker 3:          00:21:07       you know,

Speaker 1:          00:21:08       this is your business. You actually earn a living doing this shit by debt that other people can't fucking collect. And so she was like, you know, giving me Shit, telling me I had to click or I'm not doing it. You know, I go, I go, I have perfect credit. I've paid everything. Okay. I really don't think that someday in the future when I go to buy a house, they're going to be like, you know what? We really want to let you know, give you a couple hundred thousand dollars a loan here, but you owe $300 to a gym. And she's like, oh my God. You know what? We just had a client who just called us up and said, please, please, please, I have to pay off. You know, this $400 that I owe you because I'm trying to buy a house and they won't let me. And I was like, wow.

Speaker 1:          00:21:54       I go, that's incredible. That's almost the exact same scenario that I just presented to you. It's almost like you made it up. Right. And then she got fucking mad at me and then I just started hitting on her and she started saying it was harassment and I just gay. How old are you? You know, you live around here, you know, you got a boyfriend or anything. And she ended up, she got so mad, she hung up on me. You know, I'll probably get me to get over that. And ever since then I been afraid of the phone. Every time it rings, I shake.

Speaker 3:          00:22:28       Okay,

Speaker 1:          00:22:29       please tell. Phone's always on styling.

Speaker 3:          00:22:32       Um, anyways,

Speaker 1:          00:22:38       what are we got 22 minutes in here? Is it time to fucking say? And you know what I got to met? They just kept harassing me, harassing me. I just got sick of it. It was only 300 bucks. So I just fucking pay them

Speaker 3:          00:22:48       and um,

Speaker 1:          00:22:50       I shouldn't have, there's a couple people that I shouldn't have paid and I did, but I just, I didn't like the, uh, the stress, you know, I couldn't put it into perspective and I just got sick of them calling me and I, you know, I had fun with them. Shit.

Speaker 3:          00:23:04       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:23:05       Hitting on them or are saying that I had gotten into some horrible accident. That was another big one that I just said. I don't know how many times I have to tell you I lost my leg in a car accident. What kind of Pete went? Oh my God, sir. I'm so sorry to hear that. Well, are you, this is like the third time. I'm literally sitting here right now with my stump elevated so I don't bleed out because the sutures have come loose again and here you are harassing. This is what you do. And then they would, you know, it was that thing. Um, and I just ran out of ways to have fun with them.

Speaker 3:          00:23:39       Uh,

Speaker 1:          00:23:42       and then I, I think I just finally fucking paid him.

Speaker 1:          00:23:47       Yeah, I've done that a couple of times. I had a fucking landlord that's stole from my apartment managers stove, my pubs on the road. And I came back and, uh, it was on the road for three weeks. I was on the road for so long when I came back, like most of the water had evaporated out of the toilet and they had this check the smoke alarm. So legally they could go into my apartment when I wasn't there without my consent, because if there was a fire, it could affect the other units. That's what they said. And uh, all of a sudden I noticed there was a camera missing. They'd picked through my cds. It was a hip hop fan. And, um, so I went down and I talked to the guy about it thinking that the manager was going to be like, oh my God started where we got to get to the bottom of this age, who says, I don't appreciate you coming down to excuse you, accusing me.

Speaker 1:          00:24:29       And he started saying all this shit, I have the power. He kept saying I have the power. So it was like, Oh yeah, you've got the power. I buddy and I just stood outside the office and anytime anybody new came, I stood out to for two hours. I was like, yeah, don't run from these paypal. They uh, they stole from my apartment and all that. That's like, dude, I'm a comedian. I can do this all day. I will be down here every single fucking day. And it was bullshit because the next day I went on the road and I just, I just didn't have it in me and um, I shouldn't get, hey, hey, come on in here. The lovely Nia, everybody, can we hear what's going on? I was just talking to them about collection agencies and all of that type of stuff and all the crap I've gone through.

I said I got two more reads, but I'm going to give you guys a break. All right. Yesterday I went to a music festival. All right. I went to go see the pretenders when I was in England. Um, the great Chrissy hine came down with some of her friends, some of the band members and stuff that came down to my show. That's the second time she's come to one of my shows over there. So I was like, next time you come to the u s I'm going to your show, you got me going. And she said, cool, guess what? I'm going to be there a few days after he come back. So I was like, all right, done don Dale. So I figure they're going to be playing like some theater Assam shit out here.

Speaker 1:          00:38:26       You know, I'm an old band. I'll sit down in his seat, get myself assessed Barilla. That'd be once in a while, stand up and wave my fist and feel like I've as an audience member. But now they were doing a music festival and I get the email from our manager and there's a map and it's to the rose bowl. I'm like, Holy Shit. Who the fuck is on this bill? And it was, it was Neil Young, Jack White, the pretenders, the smiths, and a bunch of other people that I'm sure I missed. And that will fucking amazing, right? So I'm like, wow, this is going to be, I never saw a concert at, uh, at the fucking Rosebowl is going to be amazing. So, you know, I walk in there, I walked right where it's, you know, the Rosebowl logo. I'm having all of these flashbacks of how many times have been they're hammered.

Speaker 1:          00:39:14       Going to the rose bowl game kind of struck me as funny to be walking the golf course. It's a big golf course outside the stadium, by the way. I'm finally doing it sober. So I'm walking in there and the first thing I tried to go into the main entrance into the, uh, the Rose Bowl stadium. They're like, Nah, Nah, you got to go around and you got to go around. And I'm like, well, of course she got to go around. They always make eco the longest fucking possible way. Why do I got to go around? Why the fuck do I got to do that? You fucking assholes. And then I go in there and then we got to make a left turn and then a, right now I'm going to cut across the bridge, the stadiums right fucking there. And I go to go across bitch gun. Sorry sir. This is one way. It's a, it's one way for walking.

Speaker 1:          00:39:57       Are you worried there's going to be a head on collision when a fuck do I have to gut guy and got to go up dairy and I'm losing my shit. And then I'm looking around, there's all these tents and all this shit and all of a sudden he finally fucking dawns on me that the concert is not in the Roseville. It's all over this giant golf course. So the whole time I'm trying to go in the stadium, there's nothing going on in the stadium. Fucking moron. Right. And uh, and also I'm trying to keep my cool because somebody told me the other day said like, dude, you, you do not handle stress well. And that of course hurt my ego. I'm like, what are you talking about? I don't handle stress. Well, I'm a stand up comedian. I've performed at Madison Square Garden. I dealt with doing five minutes of stand up on, on the Dave Letterman show when it was like 30 below with the air conditioner. Okay. One of the most intimidating things ever. And I was able to set aside that fucking stress and get through it. And uh, then the person's like, all right, all right, Geez. You know, just saying, you know, and then I realized, it's like, you know, thinking about it the next day actually snapping again over something fucking stupid. That of course, five minutes later I figured out, probably three minutes later I actually realized that this person was right. That I,

Speaker 1:          00:41:10       it's not, I don't handle inconvenience. Well, and then I turn it into like, what's going on in Hawaii right now with the lava pouring out and all his shit. So

Speaker 2:          00:41:22       yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:41:22       I don't know. I've done this so many times. The last couple of days, you know, except for at the festival when they, I was doing well with the stress until they told me the bridge where people were walking was one way.

Speaker 2:          00:41:36       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:41:37       You know, I just, all right. I mean if I even taught, say that one more time you guys, I'm going to lose my shit again. So anyways, I drove in traffic yesterday. I was completely relaxed, but I've done this a million fucking times. 1 million times is somebody says something to me about it. It makes me want to change. And then for two, three days I'm okay. And then gradually I just go back to the way I was, you know, flipping the fuck out. So I think I'm going to start talking about it on the podcast the way I do with my boozing, cause I keeps my booze and, and check to tell you guys if I'm on the wagon, I'm off or whatever. And then you guys give me shit, a Billy booze bag, a Billy fucking fat tits and all that Shit. It makes me hard. Fuck these people. I'm going back to crushing waters. Um, so anyways, I'm just, I finally, I figured out that this festival is uh, outside and now, you know, I don't know where the fuck I'm going and the pretenders are going to be on. They were on in the afternoon, five 25. Right. Right. At dusk or should have been dusk. Different time of year would have been dusk. Right. And um,

Speaker 2:          00:42:43       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:42:44       I was looking like, what, what the fuck do I do here? I've got to get some booze. Right. So, you know, they're doing these little fucking, you know, they're not pulling at home port. So I got like two whiskeys and I'm walking around, you know, my stupid Little Cup. Right. And I see this fucking guy even older than me. He must've been like 63. It's actually still in pretty good shape. But he had the long gray hair. He had his shirt off, you know, just that guy. He's been going to concerts forever, you know, and the pretenders startup. And I'm trying to find where the, uh, you know, the best place where I could watch it. And he starts doing like that, you know, that like that, that fucking hippie surfer, spiritual white guy dancing. It was a touch of Tai Chi in there. You know, he's still in that fucking dance and you know, it's the same dance he does to all music.

Speaker 1:          00:43:38       I don't even know what it is. And they always have like this look on their face. When you look in this smiling, they always look at you like they have life figured out. Like they know what, what makes they like, hey man, like you know, they're going to say all this spiritual bullshit to you that you could find on the side of a fucking Dixie Cup. You know? Um, then whoever that guy is, I want to thank you. I fuck it. It was laughing my ass off. Uh, just a faggy had his shirt off. I get to sit. He was still doing the, I got him [inaudible] he was still doing the pushups so he didn't have the man boobs. But still, it's like, come on man, these young people here, if they don't want to see that, cover yourself up. This whole fucking pride in your age and everything, you know, or how you look is all well and good, but you know, you know what?

Speaker 1:          00:44:25       It's kind of disappeared is common fucking courtesy for your fellow man. Good Lord. You know, I just, it just blows my mind. It really doesn't. It does. Doesn't cause you know what? I think that guy was a baby boomer, you know, and there's never, you know, you know, right before the baby boomer, sorry, gotta plug my headphones back in right before the baby boomers was the greatest generation. According to Tom Broker, they're the greatest generation. Like, I think the baby boomers resilink like the most selfish, like maybe because there's so many of them that they had such an influence on the culture and they think every fucking thing that happened during that time was just so God damn important. That just, I dunno, I think, and I think that there would just so up their own ass about themselves that now that they're old and all wrinkly, they just can't, they can't, they just can't let it go. Can't let it go. You know? I mean, I'm not gonna lie to you. I'm fighting aging by trying to work out and stay in shape and eat right and all that type of stuff. But yeah, I stayed covered up.

Speaker 1:          00:45:33       I have empathy for people in their 20s. They, they, they don't want to see it. So anyways, um, I go by the spiritual dancing guy and I wore my way up as close to the stage as I possibly can. And I have to tell you something, man, have Chrissy Hine, the paternity is fucking murdered. She sounded like she once again, two weeks in a row. I've seen great concerts. She sounded as great as the albums that I, I grew up listening to. And um, the song she opened with was on her, her new album. It was just about being a loner and liking not being in a relationship and shit. And, uh, the lyrics are hilarious and I, I'm almost a little ashamed at like how much I relate to the song. I told her afterwards, I was like, I fucking love this.

Speaker 4:          00:46:26       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:46:27       Um, but they just fucking murder and she's such a bad ass total rock star. Like the real deal, paid her dues, all that shit. You just see all of that. When you watch her perform. It was tremendous. And she gets off stage and then next up was Jack White, Jack fucking white, right? I get to see him come out with this new lineup, the new sound that he has, he was fucking unbelievable day. You know, there's another guy, if you go see him, it's like, when have you ever seen that guy even remotely take a show of like half a second off during a show? Forget about a show. That guy never is the intense of phoning it in. Whenever I see that guy perform live, I always get inspired as a comedian. Like I could be working a little harder.

Speaker 4:          00:47:17       Okay,

Speaker 1:          00:47:18       I can be trying to give people a better show here. So, um, his said ended and um, I walked over to go see the smiths who I run my, one of my brothers listen to them.

Speaker 1:          00:47:35       Everybody I knew listened to better music than I listened to in the 80s. I just was listening to like, I mean, I listened to some good shit, but I was listening to a lot of fucking hair metal, you know, which is why I missed out on Pantera and fucking all those bands that came out. Like I was, I was, I was too far the other direction. Like, Hey, every rose has its door, you know? Then also I was like, Pauly Paul Shad, right? I'm just like, what the fuck is this? This is, you know, I'm as cynical as the next guy, but Jesus Christ, that's another thing. I started listening to that Iowa album, that slipknot shit and like,

Speaker 2:          00:48:10       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:48:10       I always liked the, uh, the heretic thing. People equal shit. I was, that was kind of funny. Um,

Speaker 1:          00:48:18       but I never like, I dunno, it was just too much going on and now I'm listening to a fucking 20 years after it came out going like, this fucking album is unbelievable. Um, but I mean, have, you know, there's only so much fucking music he can lead. You're going to miss something, right? I've got to forgive myself on some level. So anyways, uh, I went over and I saw the smiths and I remember that one, that one song that crossed over that even like a fucking mainstream Charlie like me heard where it was a, that stopped the meds. You know, rab, uh, stop. It's up to your future. Right. Anyways, I watched those guys that band fucking murdered and did the impossible. I felt it had like 10,000 white people all dancing for their entire fucking set. It was ridiculous. Um, how hard they killed and then they ended this, this set.

Speaker 2:          00:49:12       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:49:12       Such a cool way they had the crowd do was sing along.

Speaker 2:          00:49:16       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:49:17       As a band we started playing a little more quiet, a little more quiet, a little more quiet. And, and the lead singer was like roasting people in the crowd go, great job. Great job. You don't sound that good. You feel like you got bronchitis and everybody's laughing. And then the band just sorta, just gradually stopped playing and the crowd one more time sang, uh, or does it the chorus. And then they said, thanks a lot. Good night. It was so fucking cool. And, um, and then Neil young starts playing. Now you got to walk across the golf course again. And my back was fucking killing me and I was jet lagged and all of that shit. And I just, I hate to say this, I've never seen Neil young and concert. I just, I couldn't make it, you know, and I had to get home, you know, I got a kids getting up and shit and it's just like, I don't want to fucking see Neil young standing outside with my backbone fucking

Speaker 2:          00:50:11       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:50:13       You know, it's talking to me next to some fucking 60 year old guy doing his Tai Chi fucking hey man, dance. I want to see this guy in a theater. So I, I stood there and I watched him play one song. Um, so I could say, or at least most of the first sock, he didn't even sing. It was just like him playing guitar and Shit. I think his experience was like, I got to get all those people that would just over at the Smith's time to come over. Sure. People's feet hurt and their backs hurt. I mean, he's probably doing me a favor, but I just, you know, I dunno. I just said to my friends, I was like, guys, I gotta I gotta go home. I can't and I ubered here and it's just going to be a thousand fucking people to, and I just know how I'm wired.

Speaker 1:          00:50:59       I have to find that one way bridge that's going to allow me to get the fuck outta here. And I actually left, um, during one of my favorite singers of all time during his fucking set. Um, but anyways, it's a great show and all that. If you're younger, definitely check it out. If you're older, definitely stretch, you know, try to keep your shirt on. Um, I saw these two people. Oh my God, these two fucking Wales, he's too fat people like one of those fat couples and they were just asleep on their picnic blanket. Like both in like the spooning position, but faced opposite. It was like a fat ying Yang.

Speaker 1:          00:51:41       They would just lay in there. You know what they look like, you know, like at the zoo when they tranquilize like, uh, one of those big cats when those predators and then it's just like, all right, now that we knocked it out, we need to bring a fucking machine over here to pick this thing up. It weighs like 600 fucking pounds. Um, and I dunno, they were, they were oddly adorable. Like I was like, it must be fun. You know what I mean? Like you like those commercials come out and you see like Domino's or like Papa Ginos we'll have like a fucking some deal, like get two pizzas for seven bucks and if you get that, we'll throw in the fucking chocolate chip cookie pie with the whipped cream and ice cream. Right. And I always make fun of that Shit and I always make fun of it because this is a big part of me that just wants to order that and take the ride, you know, have the salt fucking take me down to the ground.

Speaker 1:          00:52:37       Right. And that the is, I think I'm going to fucking, you know, sink into the rug like that. Dude. And trade spotting. Then he started eating the fucking cookie pie and you start coming back like Hulk Hogan. You know when he, when they went to drop his hand that last time and it didn't go down and all of a sudden you eat the cookie thing and you start shaking your Yag, he starts strutting around. Right. But you don't, you don't. And they get, they get to live that life. They get to sit there and like I bet they got one of those, you know those, you know those big fucking couches that on either side there's the recliner but it's still like a sofa. I bet they got one of those, right. And then in the middle the thing comes down. Remember that it was basically, it was a fat fuck couch.

Speaker 1:          00:53:24       These to make this thing before, like the biggest loser and everything came out. It was like catering for people who were fat fucks or were, their goal in life was to become a fat fuck because on either side of this big couch like cute, you could pull a lever and you've feet could go up. And then in the middle this thing would come down. There's a place for your drinks and like a fucking pizza and he just sit there with you, with the girlfriend, you know, watching the TV you feed up, get the AC cranked can just destroy, like just destroying the fucking planet and your absolute like Utopia. I mean, I don't know if you guys believe in an afterlife and which I've thought about a lot when Vinnie past, you know, there was all that talk about now he's reunited, reunited with his brother and I was definitely thinking, you know, I really hope that that happens, you know?

Speaker 1:          00:54:22       Um, so let's say that it does okay. If you're a fat couple and you have one of those couches and you'll watch it, one of your favorite shows on Netflix or Hulu, whatever the fuck you do, and you're sitting there with your feet reclined eating a pizza and he got that cookie fucking pizza thing coming next, drinking your favorite drink. It's just like, what could the afterlife offer you that's going to be any better than that if you truly love one another, you know, when you got the AC going, you know, you get your toes out. I mean, I dunno, I think I'm selling a lifestyle right now here. I think I'm selling some couches. Um, anyways, but I had a great time and uh, if you get a chance, you know, like I said, definitely check out that festival and I feel really bad that I had to leave to, I left during Neil Young.

Speaker 1:          00:55:16       The fuck is wrong with me. I have to, I have to fix that in the future by seeing him. But like, you know, I want to see that guy. Like, did you have a scene when he did that film was at the Ryman. That's what you want to see fucking deal young. Yeah. You see him at this, I'm not trying to not sell this festival, but I'm just saying, look, I'm old. I need a chair. Okay. There I said it all right. I used to be able to stand.

By now, I'm sure that you're heard that Vinnie Paul passed away last Friday. Uh, much like you talked about Malcolm Young after his death. I feel like Vinny was another one who just lived an amazing life. One of the great drummers to ever get behind the kid.

Speaker 1:          01:00:04       I got to tell you, like all everything that I saw on Twitter from all these big time rockstars over and over and over again, other than stating the obvious what a monster, amazing drummer he was. Everybody's just talked about what a, what a nice guy he was. Um, anyways, he said I was too young when Panthera was leaving their mark on the metal scene through the 90s. So I never got to see Pantera played live before they disbanded. However, I did get to see Vinny play with hell yeah, back in the day, uh, back in 2016 at a Rockfield festival in Jacksonville, Florida. He was quite simply incredible. Oh, this is a cool story. I read this before, um, the podcast, something I never do, but I saw it said, Vinnie. Paul said I wanted to read it. I said, I remember being pretty close to the front of the stage and Vinnie was the first band member to come out before the show started.

Speaker 1:          01:00:54       When he stood up behind the drum kit, he had this smile on his face. Like he was just really happy to be there. He twirled his drum stick at the whole crowd. A crowd saluted by putting his fist in the air and then the madness begin. But for most of the show, I couldn't take my eyes off of him because of how good he was. Oh, that's awesome. And even though he was that good, the biggest memory I have of him was that he was smiling the whole show. Like he just loved playing in c, seeing people enjoy themselves as much as he was. He will be missed by more. You will be missed by more than we know. I don't know if that sentence makes sense. Um, if you remember, please cranked a Panthera song up as loud as she can. Today. I'm sure Vinnie, we'll hear it.

Speaker 1:          01:01:37       Best switches, Eh, um, a I um, best which is incompetent. It said, um, the hours already listened to the fucking shit every day anyways. You know what, you know, it's a great album. Great live album. Is there 101 proof? I'm such a bad ass Alba and my, one of my favorite things is when they play unbroken and fill as Phil's doing the intro video. Vinnie's already counting in the song. Just how tight they were. Always our world shore. We Bernard's called our broker. No Maverick of course. Jab Brown al Bag. Alright, coco the gorilla. Oh, I saw this too at fucking sweetheart of a gorilla.

Speaker 3:          01:02:20       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:02:20       Um, did I did the bit above. Hey Bill, I saw you. You live last year and I love you special. We talk about teaching gorillas, sign language. I was watching clips of cocoa interacting with people like with flee from the Chili peppers and Robin Williams. I watched those. I was still nervous and I just saw a flea laying down and there's like a fucking gorilla right next to them. Um, I dunno, I get you're shooting the shit with it. You can kind of, I dunno. Um, um, it made me nervous, you know, I wonder if it made me nervous just because I'm such a big fan of flee and I didn't want to see anything happen to him. Like it was a bass player from a band I didn't give a shit about. And they go, look at this guy, this could get interesting. Um, anyways, it was, it was charming as hell. I was wondering if you ever sat down with cocoa, if ever given a chance. Well, no, not after the bid. I did. They probably, this guy's a fucking asshole. Uh, you could have asked him why the chicken cross the road and wait for a chuckle or try to explain humor to him.

Speaker 3:          01:03:23       MMM.

Speaker 1:          01:03:26       Five. Or sat down with that gorilla I, and that thing, actually, if that wasn't a party trick, if it actually knew how to do sign language, I imagine it would sign to me. You seem nervous.

Speaker 3:          01:03:36       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:03:37       At our and back. Yeah. Well, you're a fucking gorilla. Um, anyways, kid show recommendation. Um, hey there, Billy Barnicle balls. I want to, I want, if you want a show to watch with your girlfriend, checkout.

Speaker 3:          01:03:58       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:03:58       I thought it said octo nuts like something with eight balls. Octonauts is it an octopus in outer space? I watched it with my girls and kids and I actually learned some stuff. All right, well that was about as vague as the, uh, what was it that was that movie way back in the game, the silent game or the,

Speaker 3:          01:04:18       okay.

Speaker 1:          01:04:19       There's something game or the something or other. David spade had that joke. I'm going to tell the, so I'm going to tell you guys the secret of the crying game and he goes overrated.

Speaker 3:          01:04:36       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:04:36       All right. Hair, transplant, depression. Oh No. Hey old freckled Dick. I'm a 21 year old man. I recently got a hair transplant surgery. Well, you must be a hairy motherfucker, man. You went bald that are soon. Um, the surgery went great. Good, good for you. But I now hate that I have a huge scar in the back of my head. I don't they do it now where they just vacuum the shit out. So you don't have to have that smile on the back of your head. You Go. So every time I cut my hair, you can see it. Could you give me some advice? So what I should do? Well yeah, don't cut your hair so fucking short now that you got of back on top of your head. Grow your hair out. You'll be fine. That was an easy one.

Speaker 1:          01:05:24       What are you doing? You got hair plugs yet? I'm hacked the back of your head. Then you got fucking hair plugs and now you're shaving your head down to the point where you can fucking see it anyways. What was the point? Um, I dunno. I would just, I guess I would just grow my hair out a little bit. I don't think it has to be that long to cover the scar. As long as it's long enough that you can't see your scalp, I think he should be all right. Right. Anyways, pit bull problems. Dear [inaudible]. Oh Billy. Easy shave butter. Oh, fussy Ellie's face right now. That's easy for Seeley's. Easy.

Speaker 1:          01:06:07       I Dunno, I have no idea. I suck at that shit. As he former pit bull owner, I'd like to ask your advice on a problem I'm having. My wife comes home from, my wife comes from a large family and they get together at her parents every month for Sunday dinner and family hang out. It's the last two times. My brother in law has brought, his recently is recently adopted pit bull. It's a rescue dog and he doesn't take, it was abused or used to fight because it's so good with kids. According to him it's a large family. So there, there are about 50 kids ages three to 11 running around and my four year old daughters, one of them, she loves dogs and likes this one in particular, but both times he's brought my dog. My daughter has come running to me in tears because it got over excited and jumped onto her too rough.

Speaker 1:          01:06:55       Well that's the thing about pities man. They just a big fucking awesome ball of muscle. And when I used to wrestle with my dog, I used to have to lay my neck over the top of neck. He had to get inside because she was lightening quick and she would turn around and her head was like a wrecking ball. God, I miss that fucking dog. I still get to see her every couple of months. But I, I really miss that. Um, anyways, he goes, I don't hate dogs, but I don't love them either and I don't trust pitbulls. Well, you have to validate all of that. Okay. To be quite honest, I'm kind of afraid of them. I never forget myself as something happened to my daughter. If I say something to my inlaws, I looked like a kill joy asshole. But I'm too stressed out to enjoy the family gathering because I'm hovering over a constantly.

Speaker 1:          01:07:43       So my wife's response has been to treat me like I'm overreacting and dismiss my concerns. It's bothering me so much. I've considered just keeping my daughter home next time. But am I making too big a deal about this? I think it's a recipe for disaster. I don't feel like it's my place to tell my brother in law to keep it at home and my wife's not supporting me. Please tell him. Please let me know if you have any ideas. Uh, may I see a Vod Vod to fair for two. Thank you. Thank you. And I imagine that's saying go fuck yourself. Um, I know ed and go to is you fit all right. Anyways. Um, I would say this dude, you have to like, if that's what you're feeling, you don't have to tell anybody, leave a dog home and you just have to communicate this to people.

Speaker 1:          01:08:40       All right? Say you don't hate dogs, you don't love him either and you don't, I don't trust pit bulls. Okay. And just tell them that rather than be like he did fucking lunatic. Good. No, just tell them that. All right. And I would sit down with your wife and say that, you know, I don't feel like you're hearing me all right. She's my daughter and I'm concerned and I have to be honest, you know, if you had these concerns, I would listen to them and you're not validating what I'm feeling and it's really bothering me and I can't enjoy when I go over there. I don't want to be this kill joy, but I'm hovering over our kid and I just, you know, it's bothering me. You married me, you love me, I'm telling you something's bothering me. We need to talk. If I say you can't go there because I'd be, and you fucking talk to me about this, that's what I would do.

Speaker 1:          01:09:32       Keep it in the register. I was just in all right. And don't stop having the conversation until there's a solution that you're satisfied with. It should daughter. Okay. And uh, you know, dogs are abused. All right? And if a dog snaps, you know, it's a bad thing around a kid. And then when you have a pit bull, the thing about a pit bull is its capability. You know what I mean? Some dogs, they like a little water pistol and other dogs or like a fucking bazooka at that dog is a bazooka. So not saying the breed is bad, I'm just saying if somebody fuck that dog up and it does snap, the results are, you know, going to be really bad. So, and you have to address that. That's being a real, being a responsible parent and these people need to listen to you and a, you need to speak up.

Speaker 1:          01:10:27       You gotta stand up for yourself there, buddy. Boy, that's my advice. All right, good luck. Okay. Lay De lady manager crossing the line. Dear bill or William below will you call yourself but a little below wall. I'm a 23 or 23 year old lady who just started working in an office for, I love when women write in. It's always guys, God bless you for writing it. Who just started working in an office for a big company. It's a boring job, but while I figure out what to do with my life after graduating, it's all right. Well there you go. That's not bad. He's 23. He gets your whole life ahead of you. Uh, I got promoted with the recommendation from my former manager at this 40 something year old woman who I thought was quite nice. Uh, now she's not my manager anymore, although she's still senior to me.

Speaker 1:          01:11:16       She has been a little inappropriate with me after an office Christmas party. Me and my colleagues went to a club. Uh, I came out of the club bathrooms and she was waiting. She didn't even come with us. Well, that's weird. She waved me over to sit next to her and asked me if I was gay. I said, no, I'm not. And she went fine and it didn't speak to me for the rest of the night. All right, well she needs a better opening line that she's a little blunt. You know, she's in business. She got right down to brass tacks. Uh, she said I was a bit uncomfortable with the question because what business is it of hers.

Speaker 2:          01:11:56       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:11:56       Oh, I thought she was gay. She wanted to hook up with you.

Speaker 2:          01:11:59       Yeah,

Speaker 1:          01:12:00       because what business is it of her? So I told one of my work pals what had happened. Uh, they had been at the company longer than me went, wow, you're her new one then. Oh boy. Oh Gee. I asked them what they meant. And a guy said, well, I mean, look at her right now. She's filming you and she, Sarah enough. What? And sure enough she was. She was, when I turned around, she hid her phone as I was a little bit too drunk and under the influence. I was already paranoid, so I decided to leave because I felt so gross. Since then, she's pulled me aside to say that I looked delicious and scrumptious. Oh, what a crape. Whenever she sees me at the end of the day, she taps her cheek and demands that kiss.

Speaker 2:          01:12:53       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:12:54       Oh yeah. What the fuck is this part? She Ain't, oh, that's, that's like a gross relative. She asked a girl who works for me to take pictures of me and to send it to her. When we're at a pub. I consider myself an assertive girl, but there's something about how public about her actions, which makes me so timid, so I go along with it. No,

Speaker 1:          01:13:23       I'll do that. You think you would think that because she's not my manager anymore. Now that I've been promoted, it wouldn't be a problem, but it is because my new manager is their best friend. I don't want to cause a riff in this new job, but it's really stressing me out. Am I within my rights to tell her to stop? Absolutely. You are. I do. I tell it. Is that no, I don't want to kiss her on her cheek every time I see you without looking like a bitch. Listen, the way you're looking at this is fucking crazy.

Speaker 2:          01:13:53       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:13:53       You're, you're sitting here looking at like how like your being an asshole. You're not, this person is completely out of line. She said a few of my friends thinks it's a funny situation, but I don't, and if you don't then it isn't. You've got to validate that if this was a male manager, he'd be reported. I your stuff so much and I wish I could come back to, you'd come back to Glasgow someday from a fellow fellow pasty redhead. Um, all right. Dev Fellow fucking pasty. Um,

Speaker 2:          01:14:24       okay.

Speaker 1:          01:14:24       This is what you gotta do. She asked for a kiss. You tell her no.

Speaker 2:          01:14:31       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:14:31       And I just stare at, I mean, listen, you have all the fucking power in the world or if you just want to go to the manager and say, listen, I don't want to cause some me to scandal or any of that shit. Can You keep this weird old fucking bag away from me and tell her to be professional? I mean, that's the proper way to do it. Those are the proper channels, but I have to do it that way.

Speaker 1:          01:14:59       Do it that way. Okay. Do it that way. And, and, and document that this has been happening. You have all these witnesses about them filming her and all of this type of shit. If they ever tried to fire you, I mean, you don't have a problem at this. This kind of thing needs to stop and uh, you know, in a perfect world you'd go to her because I don't like that whole telling on her thing. But that's how the business world works. Um, you know, in a perfect world when she fucking goes, like pointed to were cheeky. That's right where you should punch her fucking blast or right in the fucking face.

Speaker 2:          01:15:38       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:15:39       Yeah. I mean if you were ever at a bar again and she's doing that Shit, I would fucking dump a drink right over her fucking head. Like that's just creepy behavior. I would just, MMM,

Speaker 2:          01:15:50       okay.

Speaker 1:          01:15:50       You got to stop this Timothy. Cause if you're timid someone like that, it's, it's gonna. It's like a magnet. They're going to go right towards you. You got to step up to her and tell her what a fucking creep she is. And if I catch you take a video of our, our, uh, pictures of me or any of this other fucking creepy sexual shit that you're doing, I'm going to report you. Okay. And you think you're going to get together with your fucking manager friend. Okay. All I gotta do is go on social media and you're fucking world is over with. The fuck is my phone. What the fuck is mine anyways, but don't do that. That's all anger. Listen, but you know,

Speaker 1:          01:16:29       you are, you seem like a really like overly nice people pleasing person at 23, which I was where you're like, is it me? That the way I'm dressing, that's attracting this, it's not you, it's that person. Okay? So whatever the fuck I said before I got upset, uh, just go, listen, I got an issue and don't be icing. I didn't want to come as a family. They go in there fucking flat footed and look right at that person and say, listen, I got an issue with her.
