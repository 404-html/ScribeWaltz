Speaker 1:          00:00:01       Hey, what's going on as bill burn his time for the Monday morning podcast from August 6th, 2018 what's going on? How are you doing? I am back. I am back in Los Honga. Oles you don't look at my last hanger lays now. Everywhere else I go is just as hot as here, but it's not as nice. Oh everybody walking around sweating their balls off. You know, you might as well be out here in Hollywood with all the real people. The forward thinking, progressive people. How we, we pushed the needle, we changed the needle, we drive the sled, whatever the fuck, whatever the fuck we're, we're always saying about ourselves. Um, and you won't, you won't find anybody out here more phony than me. Okay? I'm telling you that right now. You're going to meet me and you can take, wow, that guy is so down to earth and I want you to know it is all an act.

Speaker 2:          00:01:02       Okay?

Speaker 1:          00:01:05       You're not at my level. Sorry. Um, anyways, I just got back from, uh, I did Rochester, New York, I believe that's the first time I did a gig out there. Did it with Dean del Rey, Dean del Rey, murdering, stealing the spotlight. Everybody fucking, you know, flipping out about him. You know, we so interesting with his glasses and his tattoos and I just come out right. Fucking old milk toast Freddy. Right? Nobody cares. No, I had a great time. Um, I had a great time with that crowd. And what a beautiful fucking God damn town. Put a coach. Why can't it just say it was a beautiful town? What a beautiful f and g d town. I have got to stop cursing around my kid. I have to, I have to do that. I'm starting to do it with adults where I just say like, uh, yeah, and the f the F and guys in a hall and then I just go, sorry, I got a kid. I need the practice.

Speaker 1:          00:02:02       But is that any better cause that my kid's going to be walking around like, yeah, he fine. He's an FNA hole, right? It's people that are still going to be like, I don't, I don't know. It probably would still be adorable cause I have to tell you, I just came home and uh, it was her nap time, but she saw, I was expecting her to be asleep but it was five minutes into her nap time. But we have her on a schedule and so I figured for sure she'd be taking a nap and I came home and she wasn't, I was like tip toeing in the house and he's heard these little feet come running out. Dat, Dat, Dat, dat, Dat, dat. It is the best. It's the best thing ever. One of the few things in life that is not overhyped having a kid is the greatest thing ever.

Speaker 1:          00:02:43       So anyways, um, Rochester, New York, gorgeous, right? So I get there and a first thing I see is a giant brick factory, giant factory, smoke stacks, the whole thing. There's a little bit of steam coming out of one of them, but you know, flying in and I'm looking down and I, I, you know, I'm doing all this. I have a private pilot's license, so I'm looking at the clouds, trying to guess what's going on here. There's a bunch of like, you know, patches of clouds, a little poofy, a little puff, they're little ports or what does that tell me? That tells me that there's, there's, there's a lot of uneven air there that we're going to have a little turbulence. Okay. Cause there's, there's the, the air is being pushed up in certain areas. It's not just straight across, straight across. And it was even, and they weren't like all big and Puffy, you think, okay, that's kind of some smooth fucking air there. Right. I don't know if I'm right. Ground school was a long time ago and I fly out here in La and there's really no way that should go along the coast every once in a while. So I looked down and I see this factory

Speaker 1:          00:03:47       and like I said, it's, it looks like an old school thing or they, they, they, they Brewen some beer. Are they making some steel? What are they doing there? And uh, and I looked down and it was this giant empty parking lot, couldn't see any cars. And uh, so I was like, ah, you know, they'll just turn that into lofts. Everything just gets turned into a place to live.

Speaker 1:          00:04:08       You know, a place where we made something or was a place to go do something, they'll just take it and it'll turn into lofts and was just like, we kept a lot of the character of this place where we used to make things. So would you like to move into this luxury apartment with your Gucci bags even though you're only making 50 grand a fucking year or whatever, the whatever the fuck it is. People, please don't be that person everybody because a old freckles head. I got a bear. I got, I got a bad feeling man. It's like things are not adding up out there.

Speaker 2:          00:04:41       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:04:42       Everybody is walking around with these car Dashi and level outfits are, a lot of people are and uh, the amount of fucking 20 somethings I see driving around in BMWs. It's like, does everybody have a fucking rich dad out there? You driving around in a BMW okay with your fucking Gucci glasses and all of this shit. And then this is the thing, nobody's at work. This traffic 24 fucking seven. I looked at a census. The population really isn't, at least the legal population isn't really growing in this country. I don't think if you are an illegal, I don't think you're driving around in a fucking BMW attracting all kinds of attention to yourself. So unless everybody's a fucking Uber driver, but then where are they driving? All those people during the day, they're all late for work. I Dunno. I Dunno what's going on it this, this, this, this happens. This happens like every fucking once every 10 years. You know, first time I saw it was in the 80s, everybody was doing blow all the yuppies. Everybody was fucking walking around with a Rolex and all of this fucking shit. And then right there, Fred over

Speaker 1:          00:05:58       all of a sudden you fucking, yeah, I had nothing left in your nose. Like he'd been boxing for 20 years. Right? Skinny ties are out, z caviar, Ricci genes are in, you're a fucking coke head. You're fucked up your whole life. And, uh, they repossessed you BMW then in the 90s. Right? It was a little rough time. They're a little rough time there. And then, uh, you know, Bill Clinton came in according to the Democrats, he turns it all around. He saved it. There was a zero fucking, you know, we had no debt. He got us out of debt, you know, of course, you know, he used a couple of vaginas as a humidor, but you know, everybody's gonna have their faults.

Speaker 1:          00:06:41       What was he supposed to do? Balance the budget, play the saxophone and not fuck around on his wife. I mean, something's got to give. And I'm telling you that right now is a sober fucking person who is not drank since June. Something has got to give, you know, maybe you go out, you know, maybe you don't give into the boot, okay? Maybe you don't bang an intern, all right? But if he had made you lay off the ice cream and you don't watch Internet porn and you're basically, you're going to paint yourself into a corner. And next thing you know, you're driving down the street, talking to yourself going, am I really going to go out here? And, and, and I guess do a thrill kill. Is that what I'm doing? Am I going to kill a hitchhiker right now to just somehow inject some sort of a rush into my life, right.

Speaker 1:          00:07:38       Sorry. Um, anyways, I'm coming off the wagon tomorrow for one day. For one day only, uh, me and Joe Derosa Hall. Ah, I'll tell you right now, if I live as could talk, they would say, let me up, throw in the towel, get off of me. Um, I dunno what they would say, but it would be, they would give us a fucking, uh, a thrashing, um, if they could speak anyways. That sounds like a fucking book. If you're Oregon's could speak right and you just stretch it out over like, you know, I'm, I'm the organs. Do you have like 10, you know, one days your liver. Next Day's your kidneys.

Speaker 2:          00:08:24       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:08:24       You know, and then one day to Dick. All right, what would you, Dick Sadia you don't, nothing smart. You know, you Dick's never going to be like, why did we fuck that girl? You know? Yeah, you're fucking, your brain says that.

Speaker 2:          00:08:38       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:08:38       You, Dick Never says that. You take good know me. She was there. Um, anyways.

Speaker 2:          00:08:48       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:08:49       I'll try to pancreas is just would be like the fucking, just the grizzled vet, you know, union toll booth, booth workers just sitting there with a cigarette dangling out of his fucking mouth doesn't give a shit. Right. It's getting close to retirement. I think the, your kidneys would be the most progressive and annoying. He could just drink some more water. Sorry. Um, anyways, so then after, what is it after a,

Speaker 2:          00:09:22       okay,

Speaker 1:          00:09:23       Rochester. I then drove down beautiful, beautiful drive from Rochester all the way down into a western Pennsylvania and then down into Youngstown, which I'd never gone to. And I was say Youngstown was like three hours away from Ohio. It's like an hour and a half. I thought Akron was way down there too. I thought they were way down the fucking east side down there. Uh, Pittsburgh and shit, but they're not, they're right there. So I went, got to go to famous Youngstown a, it didn't get to see shit. I came in, I saw that there was some sort of Italian feast festival going on in the streets, which I would have loved to partake in. But I'm on my diet. Okay. I'm getting my revenge body. Everybody, uh, no, I'm sticking to my diet here. I'm actually doing really well with it. Until this morning I couldn't find a place in the, in the, in the airport that had oatmeal.

Speaker 1:          00:10:14       So I just, I got some bacon and eggs with Hash browns, toast. But every other, every other meal I ate, I ate the way I was supposed to be eating. So whatever. That was my one fuck up. And you don't have a cheat day, you have a cheat meal. So that was a cheap fucking meal. I got on the plane and the, and, and the fucking stewardess was like, uh, you know, I always have my headphones on. Right? And so she's got a wave in front of me and I go, yes. And she goes, what would you like to drink? I said, water with ice. I got, that's all I want. That's all I want. I'm good. All right. In five seconds later she's waving at me again. Would you like to breakfast? I was getting mad at her like, how the fuck did she know that that's what I meant for the whole flight. So it was like, no, Nah, I'm good, I'm good. I'll just have the fucking water. You don't want anything. Did I say?

Speaker 1:          00:11:03       I didn't say that, but I thought it and she, I could tell she was good at reading people and she sensed it and she's like, this guy's a Douche. And you know what's funny was I was still wearing my suit and tie that I had worn at the rough and rowdy taping the night before cause I just didn't feel like packing the suit. And every once in a while if you have a backpack and a little wheelie, carry on. If you also have the garment bag, they'll be somebody like the Dudley do. Right. You don't like the cop in the middle of nowhere. That has no excitement. So they got to like fucking, you know, see how far away from the curb you parked so they can give you a ticket. Someone will say, ah, I'm sorry sir, you have three items,

Speaker 1:          00:11:43       you know? And then she puts me okay in the position to say, oh, excuse me ma'am, I'm flying first class. I'm allowed to break the rules. Okay, I have, I have, I go to your Sky Lounge. Do you understand? Do you have any idea what the fuck my dad does? She puts me in that position or he, but I never say that, but I definitely think it, and that's what makes me down to earth is I don't say the things that I think. So then the world has no idea how fucking arrogant I see that. That's how that works. Um, which you got to have a little bit of arrogance in life. If you don't, then no one's ever going to make a statue of you. That's how it works. Um, so anyways, so we're all waiting in a line up and they're doing the usual thing.

Speaker 1:          00:12:41       Anybody active military duty, anybody with kids? Anybody with less than four limbs, ghee, you can board the plane now and all this shit. Nobody budges I'm like, oh great. It comes group one and all of a sudden this fucking dude, right bald. He's got the horseshoe, you know, buzz down. But he didn't shave the rest of it walks by perfectly fine. No camouflage, no fucking limbs missing, no kids, you know, can see he's not deaf. He just walks by all of us. He goes, hey, how you doing? The guy go there, what's up? And he just fucking beeps his thing and it gets on the fucking place. It's like, go on. Do you going to put on his little fucking outfit once he gets down the, uh, the jetway there?

Speaker 2:          00:13:30       Yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:13:31       I dunno. Anyways, you would know I had a great weekend. Uh,

Speaker 1:          00:13:38       so I get on the God damn plane and I'm like, you know, I didn't get a lot of sleep because the rough and rowdy, Yvette was fucking unbelievable. I am going to talk to you about that. All right. But it's gonna be a great story here. So I'm sort of teasing that. So he continued. I'll wait. You could fast forward through all of this. Well, um, I, I'm really into me TV and old movies right now. I just go through these phases and I was watching this. Uh, the postman always rings twice, which I remember from the 80s, and I thought it was an original Brian Depalma film film. I didn't know he remade it, but it kind of seems like he took the name of the movie and then he like switched it up. He did the Jimmy Page, you know what I mean? Like if Robert Plant just switched the lyrics, they wouldn't had a fucking problem.

Speaker 1:          00:14:23       Cause for a lot of those songs that Jimmy get in trouble for, he, you know, he, he changed the arrangement enough that of Robert just switched up the lyrics a little bit here. I believe it when he says that he, that he wouldn't have gotten in trouble, um, or sued that many fucking times. So anyways, plowing ahead and watching this thick and just some of the shit that they say to women in these things. This guy was in love with this woman and they were trying to plot killing her and at some point they, I dunno, they, they came up with the idea and they thought it was a good idea and they could get away with it and they were excited and he just grabs both their arms and he goes, now kiss me before I sock. Yah.

Speaker 1:          00:15:08       And that was considered a music back then because guys didn't know how to express love, but there were guys beating women where the guy's beating women. But when did beating women become a fad? Like when did that first happen? I know grunge was in the early nineties. I'll have to look that up. Um, and I'm going to leave that open. Ended to, cause somebody is going to post that and then somebody is going to be like, you know, is bill per really dense. Um, anyways, and then I was watching 77 sunset strip, my favorite fucking show on TV and I'm into the first season where they have like the, uh, the matinee idol look at and Efram Zimbalist juniors is, he's like not even an in episodes. And what somebody was saying was he was basically the Steve Urkel of 77 sunset strip. They got him in there and then he just kept getting more and more and more lines that he just fucking took over and then they phased everybody else out. So anyways, the, uh, the Dream Boat Guy, they're the lead of the show.

Speaker 1:          00:16:08       He's a, he meets this woman. She goes, I'm convinced my, my husband's trying to kill me. He's having an affair with his secretary. Uh, you know, I, the brake lines were cut on my car. He almost accidentally hit me with his boat. And, uh, I think he tried to poison me when he made me a drink. And what's funny is this woman is gorgeous and this, this guy, he's gotta be 40 years older than her and a, which amaze me that this guy was already going to trade her in. You know, cause that's what those guys do. They just sort of collect them like a cars. So I'm not saying there's anything wrong with that. You know, there's nothing wrong with the objectifying a woman if it's that obvious. You know what I mean? Cause she's uh, what's, what's the material I guess gold dig in you yet? Oh, it's like I know you're here for this stuff and you know, I'm here so you look good on my arm and I can, uh, you know, fuck something that doesn't even remotely look the way I do naked. It's an arrangement.

Speaker 1:          00:17:14       But what happens because there's no love there. Somebody always ends up pulling the plug first and then it gets fucking ugly. So anyway, she goes, this guy's trying to kill me. She goes, I'm convinced these haven't, uh, you know, he's having an affair with his secretary. So he goes down over to the office to investigate, right? And he comes walking in and you know, he's about ready to meet a woman cause the saxophone starts playing, which was what they always did back there, right? They just play the song. There's this beautiful Asian woman comes walking out and they just, it's his secretary. She comes out and the Sax

Speaker 3:          00:17:49       [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          00:17:52       right. He's always hitting on him and shit. And this, this is his opening line under it goes. Yes. He goes, they told me you're Boston ported oriental art. I have to agree. This is what he said. The sad thing is, is that same shit is still set in a Hooters every fucking night. Bio by a man of a certain age. And then he grabbed her and said, no, kiss me before he saw you.

Speaker 2:          00:18:19       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:18:21       You know, it's funny. That's one of the first things I said to Nina when I first came home.

Speaker 2:          00:18:25       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:18:27       It's just something, some lines of too good. You just, you just have to repeat them. Sweeney it was, let's get into rough n rowdy number four from Youngstown. Um, unbelievable night. I don't think I'm telling you why I can't even believe I get paid to do that shit. It's just like, it's so much fucking fun. And uh, I dunno. It's usually just hanging out, watching people beat the shit out of each other. What, what, what's not to like,

Speaker 1:          00:18:56       like I, I've just, I dunno, do you just sit there watching the fights and even the ones that are bad, they're hilarious. First of all, the, the, the fight card started off, it had two brothers like blood brothers fighting each other and in their promo videos, one was saying that my mother never loved me, you know, and I'm like, oh, Jesus is this guy's the victim of the family. And then his brother gets on and confirms it goes, yeah, she fucking hates him, you know, always hated him. Right? All he does is sit around and play video games and I'm in the National Guard and I'm out here crushing it. So the brother, when is it is, you know, a little, uh, what do you call it, ric flair, sort of a promo video. He said that the military is overrated. They're a bunch of this soft fucking hilarious trashing his brother.

Speaker 1:          00:19:49       And then they went out there and they beat the shit out of each other now. And I had to root for the older brother because I, there's this unwritten rule. I don't know if it's something somebody told me or I just, I just, just how I felt. You can never let your younger brother beat you up. You just cannot, you cannot ever let that happen. You have to be in the mindset of, you know, you're going to have to murder me and I know you don't want to go to jail. That's where you have to be mentally. You just can't have it. CanNot fucking head. Let that happen. And I sat there and I watched it happen on pay per view and I got to tell you as an older brother, it made me sick. Great fight though. Um, couple of Youngstown firemen, Jesus Christ, one went in there and just fucking knocked this guy out to the, it was the first time I saw a guy really get knocked out where he went to get back up again and went back down again. First of all, he, he, when he first went down, he was doing that thing. Do you know Bill Gates to do, what's that thing that the guy from the Carolina Panthers would do after a touchdown? It was a really easy sort of move, which is why white people are ruined it so quickly. You sort of bring your arms out to the side.

Speaker 2:          00:20:59       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:20:59       [inaudible] is that what they call it? Yeah, he looked like he was doing that the way Bill Gates did, where he didn't have his elbow bent. He just draped it across his eyes. Like the sun was beaming down there. He was laying there like that. And uh, and then he rolled over and he went to get up and uh, he went fucking back down again and, and it was a, yeah, that happened. And then, uh, what else, what were some of the other highlights? Oh, pig versus punk. The cop fight in the skateboarder, skateboarder proved he was a punk. He didn't show up. So at the last second they got a bouncer.

Speaker 2:          00:21:36       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:21:37       So you got a cop and you got a bouncer. Who's kidding? Who a bouncer is just a cop that never went pro. Right. So it's a lot of overlap. So they fucking get it in the ring and all my, that's the cop, first of all, I didn't realize he had lost his job because he did a drive along or ride along, whatever the fuck you call it. And uh, somehow the mayor got wind of it. And you didn't fucking like it. So they fired the guy and I got to tell you, a bar stool sports, uh, paid two years of the guy's salary. Um, and anyways, he went in there and Jesus Christ, and this was a, he fought a bounce and a, granted the guy didn't fucking have any time to prepare and uh, and it looked like it. Holy Shit. This guy was fast, strong, knew what the fuck he was doing, had decent footwork. I mean, you figure, you know, the cops, they teach him some of that MMA shed will stand up a little how to choke a guy out or whatever. And uh, he just, he beat the shit out of this fucking guy, but I got to tell you, the bouncer could take a punch man. He fucking, he ate all of them until the last one. And then that was kind of it. And um,

Speaker 1:          00:22:49       then the cop, the cop got ops of out of the ring and everyone's going like really huge date, three inch day. Like give him his fucking job back. And then he proceeded in the post interview, I think to ruin any chance of ever getting a job as a cop anywhere. They said to him, they go, hey, so are you upset? You know, did you do that? The mayor, you know, uh, stepped in and said, your police chief, either it's you or him, are you upset with him? Now what he should have said was like, listen to, there's a lot of variables involved. Um, I have respect for the office of the mayor and the mayor himself. He was, Dee did what he felt was best and a, I'm not gonna argue with that. I'm just happy to have the opportunity to come down here and get the people in Youngstown some entertainment. That's what he should have said. But he did like, are you upset with the Mary's just like, I don't give a shit. Yeah, I was fucking mad and I fucking, I brought that fucking anger in there and he said, it's just like, all right, that's a wrap on the criminal justice. Well, who knows? I will just say the tape is out there. So if anybody ever like

Speaker 1:          00:23:59       where to do some sort of, I dunno, Internet search on them, but I think they kind of just check to see, you know, if you were watching any porn, you know, isn't that kind of where they go? I have no idea. And then the end, the uh, the highlight, the a, the headlining match gay pat versus the two time convicted felon homophobe.

Speaker 2:          00:24:21       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:24:21       Oh, and I almost forgot to mention, uh, Pat McAfee, former puncture of the country, any Indianapolis Colts to that guy. Absolutely crushed it as he would, he was the MC for all the, uh, the major. They'd like four or five major fights and he would go into the ring and do the announcements and he was fucking hilarious. Hilarious. This one guy went in his name, just, we'll just say his name was Edward Robinson the second, and he was like standing in the red corner, hidden the sloppy gray shorts and you'd go, this is this whole fucking, they would like make fun of you. And then he says the guy's name, he says, like he says, Edward Robinson does second.

Speaker 1:          00:25:10       The second day was more than one. I'm butchering his delivery, but he did just the way he fucking ripped apart. The fact that this guy went by the second, the fact that he repeated the second again and then tagged it with there was more than one just so intelligently. It's so succinctly fucking basically says what everybody thinks when they hear the second. It's like, I don't who gives a fuck why you acting like you're Henry the eighth. You know, like you use some fucking king, you just some fucking jackass. Nobody gives a fuck. And they did that too with the felon. He is a two time, two time convicted. He was fucking unbelievable. Unfucking believable. Um, so anyways, gay pat goes in there and I'm not gonna lie to you. Everybody was nervous cause it was, you know, it was a, it was this guy, you know, he said all his fucking homophobic shit. I ain't know he was also playing a role. He was also helping a, you know, sell the fight and everything, but like nobody wanted to see that, you know, and I, and I was

Speaker 2:          00:26:22       okay,

Speaker 1:          00:26:23       really happy that the whole crowd was on pat side. They were chanting his name, Gay Pat Gay Pat, right. And, uh, oh my God, I almost forgot fucking raccoon boy. This guy went by raccoon boy. He would wear a fucking raccoon hat like Davey fucking crocket. And for whatever reason, he came down the aisle in a Trashcan, one of those recycle fucking trash cans. He was in there peeking out like a fucking raccoon and they wheel them down while they did his intro. And then he tried to get his big body out of there with boxing gloves on. And it was some of the best comedy I've seen in a while. He was very upset that they didn't let him wear his, uh, his leather vest, which I thought in a very subtle way was him giving support to gate pat. Cause it was very al Pachino cruising. It didn't look like a biker vest, I guess when you're shirtless, you know, he looked like a fat Freddie Mercury, you know, if like if Freddie lived and continue to eat steak Bob's or started, I should say, he was always in good shape, right. So anyways, and uh, he went in there and he got, uh, he got exterminated.

Speaker 2:          00:27:32       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:27:32       It was another one there. These two fat guys fight and one of the fat guys was beaten. The share, the other guy who went by the Dale show and his name was not Dale, and he was getting the shit kicked, shit checked out of them. And then the other dude had to stop because he was so fat that the head gear was choking up. And what killed me was, it was like sort of looked like it was underneath the bottom of his job. But who am I to say that it wasn't, it was probably the combination of the strap under the jaw and the eight pounds of blubber around the guy's neck. Um, and there was a lot of fucking wild eyed people getting pumped up and then wasting their energy, trying to turn fear into courage. You know, like there was one guy, he came out and he's just swinging wildly and he got a couple of punches in and then like his headgear got messed up, messed up.

Speaker 1:          00:28:20       So they had to, you know, have a quick stoppage. And as they were fixing it, he was going like, like flipping out. And we're like, well this guy's fucking crazy. And then he, I don't think it landed another punch for the, for the rest of the fight. I think he let out all of that fucking energy and that was over. So anyways, this is all coming from a guy who would get the shit kicked out of them by any of these people. Okay. Um, so anyways, gay pat comes in and he was just totally fucking comp. Went in there and then I saw the convict going. I'm like, he's not that big. He's only five, eight, one 80. So he's a little stocky, but he's not that tall. Gay Pat is six for a buck 80. So they weighed the same. So everybody knew that the convict was going to bull rush him and everything. And uh, I got to tell you, I'm gay. Pat fought a filthy fight. Mayweather would have been envious with the amount of elbows. This guy through forearms to the face, he was leaning on him. He used his height. He had a tremendous fucking strategy. His corner was great. They trained him and uh, he came out with the victory and he got some good shots in there too. It was a, it was great. It was one of the, uh, then it was such a fucking relief that he wanted,

Speaker 1:          00:29:38       because yeah, I was getting nervous that if he just came in and took an right and was knocked out really bad and the crowd was actually against him, like that could've gotten really ugly. So, uh, kind of dancing between the raindrops on that one. But I want to thank everybody at Barstool sports for letting me do that. I literally, when I saw the arena and just, I just started smiling like, I can't believe, you know,

Speaker 1:          00:29:58       I go to a zillion sporting events. I've always wanted to be in the broadcast booth. I know this is, you know, not at the professional level, but neither am I. So the next one is going to be in Kentucky outside this one, like the Thrilla in Manila. It's going to be outside. This is going to be at a baseball stadium. I believe it's October 5th in Kentucky. Unfortunately. Uh, I don't think I'll be able to make that one cause I believe I have gigs. I think I'm in Connecticut and Boston that weekend, but uh, I'm definitely going to rent it. Okay. You get it for 15 bucks a few days, but right up until the day of the fight day, the fight, it's fucking 1995 I'm telling you. Tremendous night of entertainment. Uh, anyways. All right, so now that I've done that, I'm going to read a little bit of advertising here and then we're going to talk red sox, Yankees at New York. Thanks. Hang in there. Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:40:44       bump, bump, bump, bump, bought up a pop up. Wow.

Speaker 1:          00:40:53       The red sox sweep the Yankees. How about that for game fucking sweet. We didn't have Chris sale data and Aaron judge, but the fucking luck was on our side. I thought, I thought if we were lucky we were going to split with them, you know, and it was going to be, you know, I don't know what happened. It was just one of those things. We were hot, they were not. And uh, they should have one. Certainly the last game, the last two games, they should have won. They blew leads in. They fucking had a meltdown in the last one. So the red sox are now nine and a half games up. So what does that mean to people in sports radio on ESPN and all that shit? You know what it means to them? The race is over. You know why it's over? Cause we're up nine and a half games. There's 48 fucking days,

Speaker 1:          00:41:47       probably even more. I just, I just counted the games in August and in September. What in the fuck I'm sitting there. What are these people talking about? Then it's like, oh yeah, that's right there in the job of overhyping shit. Hype it up to the fucking God damn moon. And if it comes in, you look like a genius and if it doesn't come in then you gotta be like, what happened to the Red Sox? What happened to this guy? What happened? What the fuck happened? They started asking why? Acting like, like the teams that they hype said they were going to do what the fuck they said. And I understand it now because they are 24 hour sports network. So what the fuck are you gonna do during these 16 hours a day when there's no fucking games going on? What are you going to do? Yeah, you just gotta. You gotta go big. You got to say crazy shit. So guys like me lose their fucking mind. Do the fucking red sox were up by like 16 or 18 games in August. In 1978 the Yankees came to town. That was the Boston massacre. We had the one game playoff and then it was over

Speaker 1:          00:42:54       the fucking, the mets were like 9 million games out. They came back in 1969 I don't have time to look all this. This fucking happens. Almost like dude, the red sox wrap by like 1213 games like four or five years ago. 2012 and we shit, the bed didn't even make the fucking playoffs did we had Valentine as a manager. Then the next year we won the world series. So I, I don't even know what they're talking about here. This is far from over. We have six games left alone with the Yankees. We got two series, I believe with the Cleveland Indians. Everybody's sleeping on Terry Francona and the Cleveland Indians. I still think Terry is the best manager of baseball. Uh, he, he, you know. Um, and what about the Houston Astros?

Speaker 2:          00:43:42       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:43:43       They're no slouches either. And how about the fact that despite the fact the Yankees a nine and a half games out, there's still six games up in the wild card.

Speaker 2:          00:43:51       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:43:52       So according to what I was watching, that dude Mike box seat Mike from the old Mike and Mike Show, now he's on a different show. He was saying the tea according to him, it's essentially fucking over despite the fact that the red sox have blown leads. Historically 1812 gay, we fought, we fought, we fucked this. This franchise alone is fucked it up twice in my life that I remember.

Speaker 2:          00:44:15       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:44:16       I don't have time to look up the other ones. Okay. And then, okay, so now using that logic, I don't mean to just put it on him because everybody was saying it all right. Using just that fucking logic. The Yankees being up six games in the card, they only need to be up six games for another two weeks and then the wildcard is over. Is that how the math works? That's another thing too. All the Yankees got to do is just keep playing the way they've been playing all year and they're going to win the wildcard. Okay. Which means then we all go to the playoffs were all zero and zero.

Speaker 2:          00:44:54       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:44:55       So you know what happened this weekend? A whole bunch of nothing because the greedy MLB once or wildcard, they want more people in the playoffs so they make more fucking money. Cause you know you can't make enough fucking money in defense of Major League baseball, the Federal Reserve is a private corporation that prints the money for this country. So they keep us all running on the wheel. Even those guys was their mistresses in their yachts and their masquerade parties and all that. To the point they have to keep adding rounds of baseball. See like right now as a red sox fan, I would be excited that we swept the Yankees if there wasn't a fucking wildcard that just negates the whole thing. So

Speaker 1:          00:45:41       what is all that that meant was maybe if we meet the, uh, the Yankees, maybe 50, 50. If we meet the Yankees in the playoffs, if we continue to win the way we do, the first two games of the series will be played at Fenway. That's all that meant. Okay. Everybody just stand down and fucking relax. Dude. I got, I got a bet with my agent and Paul Versey. I bet him 50 bucks each and been doing it the last two seasons. We bet the, uh, the red sox Yankees series, you know, whoever wins, you know, the regular season series, right? And then if we go to the playoffs, I think it will bump up to 100 bucks a game each. Right. Keeps it fun. It got me back into baseball and I am fucking loving baseball now. Right? Um, those two guys, they had their fucking head in the oven.

Speaker 1:          00:46:36       It was hilarious. Fucking hilarious. It's just like you guys a Yankee. We'd been up 18 games and you guys and you came back. What the fuck is wrong with you? Jesus Christ, just packing it in. And maybe we maybe actually questioned both of them as human beings. I really hope to hear this, you know, fuzzy right now. You can't rob a bank with that guy. The second anybody goes, like if ric flair walked by and went, whew, you know, he would think the cops were coming and he would just pack it and you would that you think we would think it was over. Now I've got to be thinking my agent, you know, when a a a, a promoted pushes back a little bit, he's not getting me the best deal. Um, anyways, so there's plenty of time left. I am really looking forward to, uh, when the red sox have a, uh, the Indians. And then we also play the Astros are the two that I'm paying attention to. Oh, pay the Astros and September 7th, eighth and ninth. And I'm hoping Justin Verlander is pitching because I want to see how we do against that best.

Speaker 4:          00:47:42       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:47:44       And then we get some, you know, yeah, we got to, we've got one series in August. I don't have Internet access here for some fucking reason, but in September we got the Indians on the 21st 22nd and 23rd and then I believe we closed up September. I always think that not they play for the first three, four games in October. But we have a, the Yankees 28 29 30 if not October 1st maybe my cell phone will work here.

Speaker 4:          00:48:11       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:48:12       Like how funny is that with you have 48 games left Europe, nine and a half games on this one team that you're, you're still going to play six more times in everybody's gone. Yeah. Yeah man, it's fucking over. I'll tell you right now. That's why most people's dreams don't come true. You know, not because of the, the, the patriotical fucking structure. Whatever the fuck people are saying nowadays. It's cause you quit.

Speaker 2:          00:48:36       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:48:37       All right. And I'm not saying that things are, are, are, are unfair out there, but like nobody gives a fuck. Nobody cares. Everybody's too busy trying to keep this shit afloat. To have time to give a shit about you and your fucking drink. All right. So why don't you grow the fuck up? I don't know. I'm just trying to fill time right here, people. I don't mean to fucking come down on you, man. What's the next October?

Speaker 2:          00:49:04       Okay,

Speaker 1:          00:49:04       no game scheduled. Wow. Look at that. No Games in October. I can't remember the last time they finished the regular season is September. That's kind of cool. They're playing the world series in like November now. I guess they got to get ready for all the playoffs. All the rounds of the playoffs. Playoffs. Um, anyways. All right, let's read some. Uh, so anyways, it was great to see them when all those fucking games. It's nice to have that kind of a lead, but I am by no means thinking that this, this is over by any stretch of the means. I will think that it's over when, uh, we're up nine and a half games with eight games left and the Yankees are out of the wildcard to, that's when it's over. Other than that, it's, it's gets game on there. All right. Frame Bridge. Everybody. Uh, if you've been listening to this show, oh wait, what the fuck am I doing? I'm reading the Goddamn advertising. All right, podcast comment. Hey Bill, on your latest episode on Jesus Christ, I really feel like I'm going to get shit here. You're, you said you don't appeal to women, but just wanted to let you know you have a des.

Speaker 1:          00:50:19       Okay. That creeped me out.

Speaker 4:          00:50:21       Um, all right.

Speaker 1:          00:50:25       Just for the record, I'm 50 years old. That was from a 23 year old son. God, if I fucking sat across the table from a 23 year old, I give her a rattle. Um, who's your will? Will get bulky. Why we hated, why we hate other redheads. Jesus Christ. Hey, what's up?

Speaker 2:          00:50:49       Okay,

Speaker 1:          00:50:49       Billy, no glutes. I was listening to an old podcast when you were talking about the paper planes, music video, and that a group of redheads made you feel weird. Yeah. It was weird to see because you never, you never see us. You never see just a giant group of redheads. You know, we're like the spice in the stew. You know what I mean? We're not, we're not the beef in the stove. Right. Uh, I can say that I totally agree with you on that part, but I would actually go a little bit further with that. Of course you would say and say that I hate or despise other redheads.

Speaker 1:          00:51:28       Oh, this is a self hating reddit. I didn't say I was a self hating redhead. Uh Oh Jesus. Here's my reason though. They make me look bad. Simple. I'm a normal guy, kind of tall. Try to hit the gym often enough. So I have what you once called a standing six pack. But most of the fucking red heads are a fucking disgrace. Just started shaped Dorky on athletic unfunny losers with no charm. Don't get me wrong. There are exceptions, but not many. Anyway, go fuck yourself and bring your balding red headed ass to Iceland. You can't. Um, I think with any group that gets picked on, you're hypersensitive in a negative way to the way that people around you are behaving. Cause I know what it's, I've seen the big pasty freckled shapeless arms that for some reason they're wearing like a, a a tank top. I, I definitely agree with you. I do feel that that necessarily women I do feel with guys is a redheaded mail. There's a certain level of shape you have to stay in.

Speaker 2:          00:52:34       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:52:35       Cause you're already going to get picked on. So, um, I and I do understand some of that, but I am not a, uh, I'm not self hating. I don't hate the way I look. I actually think I'm a good looking guy. I do make fun of myself, but like,

Speaker 2:          00:52:53       mmm.

Speaker 1:          00:52:55       I Dunno. I don't get like, I had never been anything else, so I don't know what the fuck, you know, that would be like, but uh, I do feel bad for redheaded kids now because of

Speaker 2:          00:53:06       mmm.

Speaker 1:          00:53:08       You know, that South Park episode, like the level of shit that, that like, that, that probably started, you know, I can't, I can't, can I play and I can't play them up. Too Big of a fan. I would say maybe whenever that kick of Ginger Day came around, like I'm so glad I can't tell if I'm glad that that wasn't around when I was a kid or I'm kind of jealous because at least you knew what date of fake sick on, you know, as a redhead. Like whereas when I was coming up there, got to see like that was more of a week rather than a day, but a whatever it or what doesn't kill you makes me, makes you stronger. Uh, all right, Tom Cruise, helicopter. Um, okay. Hey there. Billy Bald. The wise, uh, Billy bald. The wise, I always feel like I should be figuring out what the fuck that means.

Speaker 1:          00:54:05       Bald, the wise, the wise is, that's another English word, kind of Billy Ball. The wise, is that like a character? I don't know. Anyways, just wanted to hear your thoughts on the new mission impossible film. I have to see it. I haven't seen her yet. I'm seeing three movies this week. I'm seeing the Mr. Rogers movie. I'm seeing eighth grade and I'm seeing a mission possible. All right. So I'm seeing something from my childhood and seeing how millennials deal with being in the eighth grade and then I'm just watching a big summer blockbuster. So I feel like I'm, I'm, I got a nice fucking, you know, smorgasborg what the fuck's going on out there? All right. Just want to hear your thoughts on a new mission. Impossible and how Tom Cruise is notorious for doing his own stunts. Do people understand what the word notorious means? That that's like a, that's basically known usually for a bad thing.

Speaker 1:          00:54:55       Um, I'd say he's famous for doing his own stunts. I feel like a lot of people don't know what infamous in notorious meets. Uh, anyways, I read, he learned how to fly a helicopter in about three months for the film as a pilot yourself, that seems like a short amount of time for someone to do the action sequence and start work that was displayed. Check out the link below. Thanks. And Go fuck yourself. Well, I think there's a, there, there, there is a lot of this, they're trying to sell a movie, so whatever he did, they're going to, they're going to shrink it down. Um, but I don't care how long or how short the amount of time he did what he did, took an unbelievable amount of fucking balls. And, uh, I was talking to some director, he goes, I can tell you without a doubt bay definitely shut that shit on the last day. Meaning if he killed himself to think that they could easily put a stunt man in there and they would still have a movie, I don't know. Um, I, I've just only seen the movie clip, Eh, but there is no fucking way ever in my pilot and career would I ever do anything like that ever. That's how I can fucking tell you no fucking way. Uh, I like to live, you know, that's my shit. Ed. Uh, I don't have problem with stuntman. I really,

Speaker 1:          00:56:24       you know, I don't want to see them act and they don't want to see me jumping in front of a fucking moving car and I stay out of their laid. I look how I'm acting like I'm at Tom Cruise's level. I just like that shit where you jumped from one building to another and they kept it in the film and he like broke his foot or something like that. Uh, yeah, that's like, like Jackie Chan does shit like that. And then, then Tom takes it to the next level where he's, he's like, well, is he, as far as I can tell you essentially just knows the helicopter over and just was flying straight down at the earth while spinning. I believe, added that to it. Uh, which I really believe is hard enough to do on a fucking airplane. Forget about an a helicopter, like I don't understand. Um,

Speaker 2:          00:57:07       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:57:08       I don't know how that works, but uh, you know, hats off to that guy. That guy is, and he can also fly like a, like a fucking jet, like a g five, like just get in the thing and fly to England. Like I believe he's that level of a pilot. Uh, I would tell you though, I would definitely rather fly with John Travolta cause it seems like, you know, he dresses up like the captain and he just, you know, straight and level. It just sort of flies where I feel like Tom Cruise big oh shit. Look at that. And it would just do a fucking barrel roll just to scare you so you can laugh at you. I remember having a long time ago telling his story on fucking Letterman where they, they,

Speaker 2:          00:57:48       yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:57:49       they were up front and they thought it was funny and they deep pressurize the cabin and they made the guy in the back pass out. They didn't like 100% but they somehow made the,

Speaker 1:          00:57:59       the oxygen, I dunno, the mixture of it. I don't know if there's too much to oxygen. So he fucking overloaded on it and got lightheaded and passed out. Uh, I dunno, but all I remember he was crying laughing when he said it and I was like, yeah, that guy's fucking guy's nuts. But I, I'm definitely going to see the movie and I am a huge Tom Cruise fan. I had a, I didn't, you know, he's one of those guys. I didn't realize how big a fan I was until one day they listed all these movies and I realized I saw like 80% of them.

Speaker 2:          00:58:28       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:58:30       Yeah. Kind of like when you go to, somebody dragged you to a concert. Like I don't want to, I mean, I know they are. I mean, I'm a radio fan of them and then you get there and you're like, oh fuck. They sing this song to, Oh my God, dude, he's fucking awesome. Next thing you know, you come home, you're downloading all that music. That's what Tom Cruise is like. Well, I can't wait to see the movie. Uh, it's perfect. Scott. Tom Cruise, he's got helicopters and they shot a lot of it in Paris. I mean, I'm in, it's over. Um, anyways, lady asking for advice.

Speaker 1:          00:59:02       Hey Billy, no buns. I'm loving this. You motivate me. I'm going to the gym right after this and I'm doing some squats. A, I'm a 23 year old woman. Oh by the way, I, I cannot, I, I got one of those little fucking, you know, you know, this little, uh, foam rollers already had one of those, but I've been using that religiously and then I got one those little balls that you could just roll out your fucking legs, your glutes, your back, the whole fucking thing when you're on the road. If you're an old person like me, it is a game changer. Game Changer. Uh, anyways, I'm a 23 year old woman from London and I love your podcast. Oh, thank you. I'm crushing it with a 23 year old ladies this week. Uh, you always say you want to hear from more of US ladies. I do cause it gets to one, one side. So here I am. I would love your advice on my current situation. My parents were quite strict when I was growing up, so I never, I have never been on a date before. Yeah I would say that goes a little beyond. Quite strict. I would say suffocating. I still live at home. I'm studying for my masters. They are less strict now as my brother is now married and they are now more comfortable with me dating. Well what the fuck is their problem?

Speaker 1:          01:00:19       I do that. That's like sad. You should, you know, lets say go out and fucking you know, get gangbanged here but I you know, go out and you know, go on a date experience finding love, losing it and fucking

Speaker 2:          01:00:35       yeah

Speaker 1:          01:00:36       that weird thing when you finally erased their number on their phone. I mean I can't, I know your phone. I can't believe you missed all that. Anyways, I'm studying part time and I am working for the rest of the time. How do I go about meeting New People? The people I work with are all in their mid forties and don't really socialize outside of work. Any advice would be appreciated. All right. Number one, don't fuck any of those 40 year olds. Okay. Your work with them and they're rolled. Don't do it. Okay. God knows where the fuck those old dicks of Ben stay away from him. All right. You like a fucking one of those, you know those, those nerds by the uh, Star Wars action figures and it's a big thing of the box has never been opened. Your box has never been opened. All right. It's worth a lot of money there. Um,

Speaker 2:          01:01:26       yeah,

Speaker 1:          01:01:27       and also you're asking me how to meet people when I've been out of the dating scene for like 15 years. I'm 50 years old and at no point in my life was I still living at home, studying for my master's while having a job. I love that you felt enough about me that you thought at some point in my life I attained that level of success. It was that pressed for time. Um, how do I go about meeting New People? Don't you guys just like go on apps dating apps? You know what? I'm actually gonna I'm going to phone a friend on this one. The rest of the podcast listeners guys, how do you do it ladies? I should ask the ladies how in this day and age, good, someone with a vagina, 23 year old vagina that has not had the seal broken yet, how can they go out into the dating world, avoid the dirty dicks and have a nice entry into the dating world, a positive experience that's going to make her not be jaded and think that maybe her parents were right for fucking, you know, keeping her chained to a radiator for the first quarter of a century of her life.

Speaker 1:          01:02:35       Uh, how should she go about doing it? I feel like dating apps is a lot of guys on there just trying to fuck, you know, and then they, there's these, no, no, that's that APP. That's that app where people just trying to hook up this app is the more serious app or what's to prevent someone to go on there and just act like they're looking for a relationship or they just want to bang you. So, um, the first thing I would say, if you have the time is it you need some sort of,

Speaker 2:          01:03:07       uh,

Speaker 1:          01:03:10       activity that you're involved in that involves you, uh, socializing with

Speaker 2:          01:03:16       the, you know,

Speaker 1:          01:03:20       men and women basically. I don't know what it is. You know, going to bars, getting hammered and shit. That's usually not gonna. You're not gonna meet a nice guy there for the most part. Uh, I would say, I don't know. Join a softball league. You meet a lot of women there. Uh, volleyball. What it was, I mean, I'm old fucking start riding a dirt bike. Maybe you'll meet some guys out there and the trail. Uh, they're dusty. Dick's. I, I mean, I don't, I don't know how to, I don't know how to help you here. I'm sorry. Uh, I, I, yeah, I got a, I got a phone. A friend. Yeah. You guys gotta help me out here. Help this lady. Okay. Put on, on in, in the subject. Put A,

Speaker 2:          01:04:05       okay.

Speaker 1:          01:04:05       Uh, what do, what do you,

Speaker 2:          01:04:07       okay.

Speaker 1:          01:04:08       23 fresh box. All right. Fresh box 23, let's call it that. All right. And you send it, email me your advice. Okay. And then we can fucking figure it out. We can help this lady up because, uh, you know, I have empathy for you that you're late to the game. I showed up late to the game. I showed up at above fucking halftime down 40 points. Alright. Dilemma. Would you rather get punched in the head by Mike Tyson in his prime or get kicked squared and the nuts by Bruce Lee. Oh, easy. Bruce Lee. Dot. A. Dot. L. Dot. A. Dot. I would go to a sperm bank app, my sperm frozen before I had yeah,

Speaker 2:          01:04:51       that happened. And, uh, you know,

Speaker 1:          01:04:58       then I would still have my brain intact to intelligently be able to tell the woman that I ended up falling in love with why I allowed the greatest Asian of all time to kick me square in the nuts. MMM. I mean, Mike Tyson, I'd still have my balls, but I might be drooling on them afterwards as I sit down de de Lou. Uh, that was a disgusting image. I didn't mean to say that. All right. For the, for the Tyson choice. Oh, I'm sorry. Your hands are tied behind your back. Okay. Now I know I have details. Your hands are tied behind your back. Tyson can wind up and is told to cause maximum damage to your head with one punch. It's going to be his famous overhand, right? Yeah, no, fuck that. Fuck that. You know there's another thing too, is this way better footage on Mike Tyson than there is on Bruce Lee for the Bruce Lee choice. You are spread eagle and cannot defend yourself. I assumed you can only wear a European man Thong to give you a semblance of dignity. I appreciate that Bruce Lee is told to cause Max maximum damage. Jia manhood with one kick. He will get a running start. Do you choose Mike Tyson or Bruce Lee? I still got to go with Bruce Lee.

Speaker 2:          01:06:22       You know what I mean?

Speaker 1:          01:06:25       What is my quality of life going to be if Mike Tyson gives me permanent fucking brain damage, but my junk is still intact. All right. If Bruce Lee obliterates my dick and balls, but I've already frozen my fucking sperm, I could still have kids. Um, I don't know. I let my wife fuck other guys, I guess. I don't know. I don't know what to do at that point. Uh, but you know, I, I could still have my brain, but then my brain would be all day long in a loop going, you don't have any junk. You don't have any junk. You know what I mean? Junk. Yeah. But you know what? If I was still at my brain, I could be smart enough to figure out how to kill myself. All right? So I would, I would go with the Bruce Lee.

Speaker 2:          01:07:17       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:07:21       You know, it'd be funnier than watching me get kicked in the balls. Spread Eagle wearing a European man song is, you know, the only thing is funnier than that would be the yell that I let out as Bruce Lee was running at me. I think it would sound a little like this. It would just be like, and then watching my inner thighs flexing is, I tried hopelessly to try to close my legs.

Speaker 2:          01:07:53       Um,

Speaker 1:          01:07:55       oh, that would be the worst too. If your legs were tied, Spread Eagle, I mean immediately get kicked in the balls, you go into the fetal position. I would not be able to do that, you know, which I would think it would make it your, your body stay and even more of panic mode because then you go into fetal position, you know, it kind of covers up your junk unless you have old man balls and they score it out back. Right.

Speaker 4:          01:08:17       MMM.

Speaker 1:          01:08:19       At which point somebody walks by and accidentally kicked some, you know, like when you fucking think you clear the door and you actually stubbed your toe.

Speaker 4:          01:08:25       MMM.

Speaker 1:          01:08:25       All right. That was disgusting. Okay. That's the podcast man. Um, I hope you guys enjoyed it. Thank you to everybody that came out in Rochester.

Speaker 4:          01:08:59       MMM.
