Speaker 1:          00:00:01       Hey, what's going on is Bill Byrd is time for the Monday morning podcast for Monday, February 15th, 2016 hello. How are you? How was your world going on this Monday? How was your Valentine's Day? Huh? Did she get her something special? Um, if you're a smart son of a bitch, um, you're either not in a relationship or you're not taking her out until tonight or tomorrow, whatever. Whenever the prices go back down again, you know, and by the way, if enough people start doing this in the old fucking restaurants get wise to it and they start making their prices higher, Valentine's Day prices a few days before, a few days after, then fucking wait a week, wait a month, do it a month earlier. Um, it's the biggest fucking rip off probably of the year, other than probably what's going on to Bernie Sanders, but I don't really understand. I guess she has some Super Dell delegates, you know, oh fuck.

Speaker 1:          00:01:01       And Hillary Clinton's got the super and she already has to super delegate. She already has a hundred. She, he needs 120, whatever the fuck that is. Jesus Christ. It's like, it's like playing bridge, trying to keep up what's going on. I have no idea. All I know is I liked that Bernie looks like an old dog trying to eat a meal when he's talking. Harvard recovered. I don't know what the fucking jowls going. And the weird thing said his fingers do. I like it. I could look at that for four years. Um, and it got to admit, and as much as I don't like all the racist shit Trump is doing, I do love some fucking jerk off yelling at other politicians. So that part has been enjoyable. You're a liar. There are there, there weren't any mass weapons of mass destruction and they know it maybe sounds like he's quoting some podcasts.

Speaker 1:          00:01:53       Um, I have no idea. At some point I'm going to start paying attention. There's gotta be some even keeled so-and-so out there. I have no fucking clue. I have no clue. And last week I said that I hated when people are in the public eye. Talk about, uh, politics. You know, that's not true. I hate when they fucking tell me why I should vote for somebody. Oh Shit. Well you were you the guy from a interview with the vampire. Oh yeah. Who should I elect for a leader of the free world? It was like with Tom Cruise was talking about psychology. It's like, Oh yeah, you pretended to be a shogun warrior in a NASCAR champion. Let me a while. But by all means, let me listen to you talk about modern medicine. Um, as long as you preface it with like, I'm a fucking moron, I don't know what I'm talking about. But uh, here you go. You know, but when you really start believing it, that's when you get in trouble. It may be, I believe it, and maybe this is the way I'm just sort of soft pedaling it, Tia, I'm playing the more on is I'm fucking feeding your, my putting the little a ringworm and you're fucking ear whatever people say

Speaker 2:          00:02:59       there with the fucking ear worm, right? Some song you can't stand gets in your fucking head. You know, it's kind of a weird ones. What a song you like gets in your head and then you don't mind. And then you drive everybody nuts around you. Like, uh, um, Steve Gorman from Steve Gorman sports sent me this, this link to this, uh, this country star that's been, um, that's been struggling for a long, long time. And he finally got a big break. I believe he's a distant cousin of worry. Clark, I'm not sure, but his name is Wheeler Walker Jr and uh, he sent me a clip that I'll send you guys a, it's a great fucking song for Valentine's Day if you are not in a relationship for a man or a woman. And a, the hook is just been stuck in my head and I really want to sing it to you, but it's going to ruin it for you. So go look up a wheeler Walker Jr. Uh, well I guess the song kind of ruins it. It's called fuck you bitch.

Speaker 2:          00:03:57       And it's really catchy and it's a, I dunno, it's fits rich, kind of poetic. I really think the, uh, the chorus really sums up what you feel when somebody breaks your heart. So, um, you know, country music, those country music stars, they can do that to you every once in a while. And it's nice to see someone go to the left, you know, those fucking country singer. So those poor bastards for all these fucking years, you know, they've been abusing drugs and you know, going to clan meetings and beating the shit out of their women, but when they get on TV, they got to do that family values thing, you know? Yeah. Gosh, well thank Jesus. I'm just, I just feel blessed at Y'all taking me into your heart. TNL Hey yell, he wants you on some potato salad. That's stupid, phony fucking southern thing where if you're from up north the first time you see it, you know your heart and melts.

Speaker 2:          00:04:53       When you hear that Twang and you just think that the egg, the nicest fucking person, nobody can stick the fucking knife in your back like a fucking southerner. What that fucking, hey y'all, how'd you hit our, you spoke and they downplay it. They play dumb, but Blahblahblahblahblah and next thing you know, you're laying in a fucking pig trough about ready to get fucking eaten alive. That's how it goes down. All right. And that guy from fucking 50 snatches and 40 smoking barrels, that's where he got it from. Okay. Not from that content, you know, I dunno what the fuck I'm talking about. Anyways, I watched a brand new TV show last night and uh, I was really fucking disappointed, you know, I fucking turned it on. I needed a new show and I thought it was going to be the one, you know, I was like, this is going to be it. It's Valentine's Day night. Okay. Me and the lovely Nia, we're not going out. I had a fucking one of those Tomahawk steaks frozen in the freezer. The fucking

Speaker 1:          00:05:59       right defroster dead bitch all day. I watch like 30 youtube videos has had dude sat. Do you know if you're going to do to them? Look to it to do one more towards don't soon. I watch like 50 those fucking things. And I just sort of like, I took a survey with temperature and time flippage in all of that stuff, and I went down the middle and, uh, I got a little impatient with the big green egg. My temperature's a little higher than I want it. So came out of the medium rather than a medium rare, but it was still fucking delish. And now there was a new series that, that, um, that I tried to get into last night and I put it on and, uh, it looked good. The acting was great, but the dialogue just wasn't there. And I tried to fucking fight it out for the first 20 minutes and then I was just looked over at Nia. Nia did one of those.

Speaker 1:          00:06:52       Yeah. You know, big inhale and the fucking eyes like, yeah, this is a, yeah. And then I was just like, well, let's shut it off. She's like, no, you know, we gotta at least watch the pilot episode, you know, which is how she ended up marrying me because I believe 20 minutes into our relationship, she was like, yeah, but she fucking stuck it through night. She kept panning for gold and she found a little nugget and she stuck with me. I didn't, I was just like, fuck this. I'm out. And uh, by 40 minutes into it, I was imitating people in it and, uh, the whole thing just went down the shitter. So once again, but you know what it, you know, I'm finally going to do, I think I'm finally going to start watching game of Thrones now that they're fucking five, 10, 15 fucking seasons into it.

Speaker 1:          00:07:44       I've, I've been trying to watch it for the longest time, but a nia has just not into it. You know, she has want to see a bunch of white people running around chasing dragons. It's just not what she's into. And, uh, I'm not really into dragons either, but like, if you're going to cut somebody fucking head off, like, um, you know, you got to do a lot to lose me after that point, you know, I dunno. Maybe. I Dunno who the fuck knows. Maybe I, I remember watching the first one and there was some sort of spooky thing going on and there was some little kid that was supposed to watch a beheading and he looked away and then it is, I figured out what his dad did, put them on the rack or something. I don't remember. Um, but then I don't, I don't know what happened and that just kept, it kept going and you know, it was like a train that was coming right.

Speaker 1:          00:08:31       And you coulda ran and caught it, but I, but you don't, you just stand there and you watch it disappear. And in that moment when that train disappears and you realize you're late for work in that fucking moment, you question everything that you're doing in your life. Why didn't I run for that train? Because I have this job that I don't like. What am I doing in this relationship? What happened to me? What happened the last six years in my fucking life? Right? It's a critical moment there where you have to beat all those thoughts down, bury them, and go back to be in the Zombie that you are. Which brings me to the walking dead. No, I'm kidding. Um, anyways, I want to thank everyone who came out in Cheyenne, Wyoming. I kept doing a southern accent the entire time I was out there and I was addressing it, but, uh, I don't know what Wyoming people sound like.

Speaker 1:          00:09:20       I'm Cheyenne, Wyoming and Denver, Colorado. I went out with a deed del Rey and uh, we had the great fucking time played this, um, the Cheyenne civic center. How cool does that sound? Had all this amazing woodwork inside of it that really looked like one of those log cabins that either an oil man or a fucking Hollywood starlet goes and buys. You know, like when people like it, a huge amount of success pretending to be other people. At some point they have to get out of La. And then they always end up in like Wyoming or Montana. It's fucking hilarious. And they buy what looks like a log cabin, sort of. It looks like a log cabin and like a fucking resort all at the same time, you know? And then they go out there and they buy, they're a designer. I'm a fucking cattle rancher wardrobe.

Speaker 1:          00:10:14       And then they do the fucking interview, right. With their big stupid cowboy hat on and older, wiser is so and so steps back to uh, evaluate the last six years of a whirlwind, whatever the fuck it is. Right. You know what I mean? And then they pretend that they can live this little fucking life out there before they go nuts after three days and they call up and chief five to pick him up and take them right back, you know, and they end up back down to the chateau, the Chateau Mall, um, doing blow in a bungalow. That's what you do. You find it a little bit of balance. Um, Oh, speaking of fucking, before I go back on that shit. Speaking of fucking sick ass houses, I was, I went on this Paul Newman kick, you know, he's my favorite of all time. You know, a lot of people go Steve McQueen.

Speaker 1:          00:11:02       I like Steve Mcqueen, but Paul Newman's my guy. He's my fella. I just, I dunno, once I look into those blue eyes, I just, I melt to Thalia. Anything. I believe it. Are you a pool shark? Are you a lawyer? Do you play hockey? Um, I watched, uh, well I guess the first thing I watched, I watched, uh, the man with the golden arm, which d, which Delray was telling me to watch, which was a, a movie about a Frank Sinatra playing a heroin addict who, uh, you know, comes out of jail when it gets cleaned and he plays the drums and he wants to get a gig playing drums. And uh, I watched a great fucking movie. There's some brutal, brutal overacting. Um, you gotta I dunno, I would definitely recommend seeing that. So I finished that. You know, it's like the next thing that was coming up was somebody up there likes me, which I'd always heard of when I was growing up.

Speaker 1:          00:12:01       And then once I saw it was Paul Newman, I was like, all right, I'm going to watch it. And it was him playing now rocky Graziano the rocky Graziano story. And um, and I literally forget what I was talking. Oh, that's right. That's right. So then it just got me on this, this, this Paul Newman thing. And you know what's funny is, uh, this, this thing actually Steve McQueen is in that movie for fucking two seconds and it's right as Graziani was getting out of some fucking, uh, you know, juvenile detention home that he fucking escapes. So He's going around the neighborhood, tapping all these guys, all this tough guy, friends on the shoulders to be like, Hey, I'm back in the neighborhood. And all of them turn around like, who the fuck is this guy? Right? Cause cause it Tufts street kids, so fucking, uh, fucking Steve McQueen is shooting pool.

Speaker 1:          00:12:52       They rocky taps him on the shoulder and he fucking turns around with a knife out, just two seconds. And then he realizes it's reads like it's rocky. He's like gay, rocky. And he does this stupid fucking thing with his head that I don't know who fucking, there's certain things in movies that the first guy who plays that guy does. And then it's this weird fucking thing where every other actor after it starts fucking doing it. And you know, nobody ever did it. Who's actually the guy that they're playing. But then it's done enough and fucking movies that the people who were actually a guy, then they start fucking doing it. And that's when it becomes a circle. And you don't know who the fuck it is. It's this fucking thing like a, it's almost like, say you were getting a manicure, right? And you want it to dry off your nails and you do just exactly a rocky and he's doing this stupid fucking thing with his hand.

Speaker 1:          00:13:45       Um, I dunno, I'm going a really long way here to tell you what I really want to tell you. But like one of my favorite things is to watch actors during that era playing Tufts street kids. Um, like it's just, it's fucking cringeworthy dead fucking movie that Marlon Brando did. He's on the motorcycle. What the fuck was that one called? It's not the wild bunch. That was a cowboy movie. Rebel without a cart now. And it's James Dean. I can't remember, but just the, the have to sit there and watch that shit. Um, how fucking brutal it is. That west side story, which I don't think I've ever seen. I'm just going to throw that in that cause I need three of them. Um, I dunno. Whatever. So I started watching that. So then I finished that one and then the next one that came on, I can't even remember the name of it.

Speaker 1:          00:14:35       Fuck, hang on a second. I got to IMD be fucking Paul Newman. Um, he just has the bluest eyes, Paul Newman. I am fucking be filmography. So anyways, um, I think it was called not Hudson. The long story was this next movie comes on, right? And in the beginning he's driving in this car and he's clearly in Los Angeles, which was one of my favorite fucking things ever to just see old footage, black and white or color of La. And he just get to see like you can usually tell by the Hollywood hills and sometimes the highways and shit kind of where they are. And um, you'll see like train tracks and shit that they ripped up those fucking cunts or you'll see, um, you know, you just see how less populated is all right. Here it is. Harper Harper is the movie the very beginning of the movie.

Speaker 1:          00:15:32       He goes into a house and uh, Lauren because in there Lauren Bacall who married a Humphrey Bogart Bogie and Bacall, one of the great couples in Hollywood history and uh, you know, Humphrey Bogart, somebody that Frank Sinatra's stole a lot of his swagger from. They were also the first rat pack Humphrey Bogart and all his fucking crew. And uh, not only did a Sinatra steel, a lot of Humphrey Bogart swagger, he actually ended up fucking Lauren Bacall later on after Humphrey Bogart died, which is really fucked up. But anyways, I digress. So at Harper, he pulls into this fucking house that I could not believe and uh, I actually looked it up and it's still exists. Look it up right now. If you're at work, pretend that you're doing, uh, that you're doing some sort of, I'm busy work. It's, it's on one zero one one north Beverly drive, 10 11 Beverly drive. And uh, this fucking house, I think it's just called the Beverly House, it's in Beverly Hills, probably has one of the sickest fucking pools I've ever seen in my life.

Speaker 1:          00:16:44       It's like a three tiered thing. The first two tiers I believe are just considered a waterfall. And first of all, it has like a half mile driveway that he DKI comes up around. And what's Hilarious, which will, it looks like the first year they had the Porsche, which at this point by 1965, when they shot, it was just considered a piece of shit. Who would know that years later, some baby boomer would play like fucking 900 grand for it. So he's driving up one of, you know, it's one of the fenders is like that fucking, you know, what's that dead paint that they primered and all that shit. So he pulls up in this fucking house. You got to see the backyard if it, so actually I look the fucking thing up. I found out where it was and the next time I fly a helicopter, I'm gonna fucking fly over the house and check it out.

Speaker 1:          00:17:28       Um, it's actually, uh, just a little bit north of the Beverly Hills Hotel, but you got to check this fucking thing out. Um, one of the great things about living in Los Angeles, a lot of people, you know, always shit on living in la, but one of the main, I think la arguably has some of the most amazing homes, um, in the country, just for the simple fact that for whatever reason, I don't know if it's the weather out here or what, they haven't been torn down. Um, so many of them, um, you know, other places that I've been to, but they have like craftsman houses out here and then they have all the Spanish, the Mediterranean style ones. They have a, they got, it's just incredible houses. So you've got to check this one out. This house is actually kind of ugly, you know, when you pull up, they shot the godfather, part two there, but I part one there. This is actually the house where, uh, the horses head scene, um, spoiler alert if he, if you're one of the two people I've never seen that fucking movie. They shot that scene in there and JFK and his wife Jackie had their honeymoon in this fucking house and I just saw it recently. The last time it's sold. It's sold for $135 million.

Speaker 1:          00:18:49       And all I'm doing looking at it after by in my old ass house that was made in 1923, all I see is fucking 50,000 square foot of galvanized pipe and cloth wiring that they're going to have to somehow fucking redo where we'll sections of it. You know, there's a little bit of copper pipe here, a little bit of wiring that was done correctly. Um, but anyways, that's another cool thing about these fucking houses out there is that they've been around so long and if they're in a desirable area in Hollywood, like the stories of like the people that live there, like how cool. I mean, that's $135 million house, obviously be a fucking amazing house. But how fucking amazing it would be to have that house and be like, you didn't see a movie and you watch him, Paul Newman walking across your fucking terrorists that you now want to. I don't know. I think that Shit's cool as hell. But um, you know, while you're at it, you can check out a lot of those. And also just look up famous Hollywood homes. Um, I told you there's a house about, not even like,

Speaker 1:          00:19:56       I dunno, maybe a 15 minute drive away from me in, in, in Los Angeles. 15 minutes is a big fucking deal. Sometimes just, you know, 15 blocks, it can go one way or another. It can literally go like to, I'm going to get stabbed to, how to fuck can you ever afford to live in? How many people did you steal from to get this fucking, this guy's got a moat around his house. Lets, lets the way La is, it's like really like patchwork. So like a 15 minute drive away from where I live. Um, my neighbor told me there's a house that went up for sale. I think I told this story before and um, it's an old ass house. It's pre prohibition and basically, uh, when prohibition came around this, this house had a pool and then it had a, a Cabana and in the Cabana at this guy, he built a bar during prohibition and he had illegal booze or I don't know if he was making beer in the bathtub, whatever the fuck he was doing.

Speaker 1:          00:20:53       But he used to, he used to have all these famous people come over there and they would just booze it up. And um, he, anybody who came over there and drank that was famous, he would have them carve their names into the bar. And, uh, evidently according to my neighbor who went and looked at the house, even though we couldn't afford it, he just wanted to see the bar. He went and looked at it. And it's one of those things, if you buy the house, it's that bars obviously protected by the historical society, some shit. But you go in there and everyone from like Louis Armstrong to like fucking Humphrey Bogart have to have carved their names into that fucking bar. So, um, whatever, that's some sort of nerdy Los Angeles. How shit. But um, yeah, definitely. Uh, rather than work today, just go on Google earth and just look at some of those fucking houses.

Speaker 1:          00:21:44       Um, or just Google, like famous Hollywood homes through this homes where like, you know, when I was watching that, you know, somebody up there likes me, uh, or I should really know the name of the fucking actress, the one who plays Paul Newman's love interest, obviously is an absolute, uh, fucking knockout. And I had never heard of her. So the fact that I never heard of her, I'm like, ah, fuck, I, I've looked up enough of those, those old movies, like I got this creepy thing that I always look people up. Like an older person. Like, all right, that person is definitely dead. Let's see how long they lived for. Right. Or you try to find a cast where like everybody's dead, you know, which is a very difficult thing to, to, so anyways, so I started looking up, you know, the people that were, you know, this woman, I hope I say her name right, it's p, I. E. R is it Pierre?

Speaker 1:          00:22:37       Pete Pier, I dunno. And Jelly. I have no idea. I looked her up and I was immediately going like, she probably died a pills cause back then like, I dunno, like getting given people pills. Like it seems back then every guy either died of a heart attack in his fifties and sixties or he died of cancer and like 90% of the women died of an accidental, like barbiturate overdose. Because back then, like, you know, if a woman came in and she had some emotional issues, you know, the doctors are like, for God's sakes, get all the ESL and they would just give her some pills to relax her. It was like in that movie airplane where they will just slap on you and giving you a backhand and shit. So, um, she was as gorgeous, amazing actress. And then of course I looked it up and um, you know, she died accidentally. Um, some people say suicide, some people say accidentally at 39 years of age. And then I look it up and sure enough, the place where she fucking overdosed is still there. That's another one of those things. It's a really fucking, you know, and see the cool

Speaker 2:          00:23:46       or creepy, all these fucking houses that people died in. There's another actor in there. This guy's Sal Mineo or whatever. Um, I swear to God, who's a dead ringer for Ralph Machio. He's in it. And uh, he ended up, he got fucking stabbed to death in like the mid Seventies. It's fucking unreal, man. Like a lot of people, a lot of stars back in the day they dated and make it, they didn't fucking write it out. It seemed like just crazy shit app and tool and die. Guess what I'm saying is that a lot of these houses still exist and if you're sort of, um, I guess I'm becoming morbid in my older age is I realize, you know, you know what I mean? Your, your mortality, you start looking how long this parts to live, how do they live? How did they die? Fuck. Is that going to happen to me?

Speaker 2:          00:24:30       Get all that type of ship. I Dunno. All right, let's, let's read it. Let's read a little fucking advertising here for the week. Oh, Jj, what'd you look at?

So if you're still on the map, if you're still on the Google Earth math, I love looking at this shit, right?

Speaker 1:          00:27:47       And you go onto a, you go on to, um, what do you do when you click it on the fucking globe? They're all right. Now go over to the ocean. Okay, follow Santa Monica Boulevard over to the ocean. All right, right where it says the 10. Now go down a little bit and you'll see something that kind of looks like a tree, but it's made out of water. That's Marina del Rey. All right? Now if you're flying south, that's where Bravo airspace begins. Along the coastline. And when you're there, you have to be at a 150 feet or below at or below one 50 and then you transitioned the bravo airspace. If you go a little bit further south, you'll see lax. All right? And that's to the south of it is two, five, right into five left and to the north there's two five, right? Two five left, those two runways.

Speaker 1:          00:28:47       And those were the big boys are taken off. So you fly underneath those guys or ladies and you stay at or below, um, 150 feet until you get to, and then you got to zoom in, uh, the Manhattan Beach Pier and, uh, which is almost a beam as they say, the a comedy and magic club down on her most of beach. Um, so you want to be, you want to be right down there, 150 fucking God damn feet. Um, oh wait a minute. Wouldn't that be Hermosa? Yeah. And I'm sorry, Hermosa Beach Pier is where the comedy clubs that, but the Manhattan Beach Pier, that's where you want to be. You guys from, from there to Marina del Ray, you got to be at or below 150 feet. So if you come out here and you're on the beach as a tourist, you see these helicopters flying by really low. Uh, they're not buzzing the beach looking at your or whatever they are.

Speaker 1:          00:29:45       Uh, they are transitioning the bravo airspace. So I'm going to be doing that. Um, I don't know on what day, but that's my big goal this week with the helicopter thing there. Um, but anyways, let's get back to the, uh, skip back to the podcast here. Um, where is it? What else did I want to talk about? Oh, how about those Boston Bruins. And I know we lost, I know we lost to a, the Redwings. I didn't get to see the, uh, the game yet. I have a taped, I'm a game behind. I watched, um, I'm actually gaming two thirds behind. I watched the first quarter of a, of us beating the wild and Brad Marshawn scored again his 12th goal and 12 games. And I actually looked up the ticker and I saw that he scored his 13th fucking goal. And, uh, in 13 games, the guy's on fire.

Speaker 1:          00:30:38       And, uh, I saw his goal in the, um, the Minnesota wild game. Um, a shorthanded goal, just a beautiful pass. And, uh, I don't know. It's fucking awesome. And he's going to have like guys, he's on his way. He's gonna have like 40 goals is fucking year. Um, and I gotta say just the Bruins and the Celtics this year. Both of them. I was just going to be like, this is, you know, after all the moves they made, you know, I just kind of felt that neither one was going to be that competitive and it was going to be tough to watch him this year. And uh, I am, I think they're both over achieve and it's been fun to watch him, although for some reason my fucking recorder stopped taping the Celtics Games. I was really getting into it watching Isaiah Thomas and, um, Crowder, a Jae Crowder and uh, it was the jam band guy and I finally learned his fucking name.

Speaker 1:          00:31:28       They're a Kelly Olynyk. Right. I was enjoying watching it and our young coach there who I still don't know his fucking name cause I always take the games and they talked to them and I just fast forward through all of that shit. And then they just show him, I think his name's Stan. Steven. Something with an s Sean. I Dunno. It looks like a baby man. The guy's like fucking 15 years younger than me and he's coaching the Celtics. He's doing a great job. And evidently we got a couple of number one draft picks. We're in a great fucking position. Um, I missed the all star weekend stuff. I saw some of the dunking stuff and Kevin Hart, did anybody see Kevin Hardy? I, he went up against some other NBA guy. I can tell, I know watched fucking NBA. He went up against a professional basketball player and a three point contest.

Speaker 1:          00:32:17       Um, should I give you a spoiler alert or should I do that? The clickbait and the results will surprise you and it gives a fuck. He actually beat the guy. And what I loved about it, besides being a big fan of his stuff and everything was when he went to start shooting is three pointers. They were playing disrespectful music underneath them. They were playing this, I'm always in this like, oh, it's adorable. Or is it, it's silly that this little man is going to come out here and try and beat one of our professional athletes and uh,

Speaker 4:          00:32:53       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:32:54       They were right through the first two racks and then he fucking close strong. And I think he might have beat them on the last ball. You got to see it. I mean it's, uh, it's pretty fucking impressive. If I remember correctly, in long time ago, he was telling me that before he was a comedian, he went to a, uh, you know, he went to a basketball camp that had our young unknown Colby Bryant and that type of shit. So, um, but still math, you know, it was a long fucking time ago. Since then, he's gone all the way to selling out the eagles football stadium doing standup comedy. You'd think that his basketball game would drop off a little bit, that maybe he'd be a little rusty at the y. Forget about being able to beat a fucking NBA player and a three point contest. It was pretty, uh, pretty God. Damn impressive. Um, so anyways, let me get back. Jesus Christ. Why Omi? Cheyenne Wyoming. So I go there and, um,

Speaker 4:          00:33:50       okay,

Speaker 1:          00:33:50       you know, this was the last of the, the 50 that I had to do. So of course I'm reading all up on Wyoming and all that type of stuff. And I see that Yellowstone park is right in the north northwest corner of it. And I'm like, Oh fuck, I got to go up there and go do a gig in the middle of nowhere at some point. And uh, maybe I'll do a nice run through Montana, Idaho and all that shit. The DAKOTAS, um, you know, I get into all that fucking nerdy shit, right? So we do the Gig, we have a great time. It take some pictures with some people afterwards. And when I was on stage I was saying, hey, where should we go tonight if I want to go out and have a pot? Right.

Speaker 4:          00:34:26       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:34:27       So of course everybody's yelling out everything at the same time and I can't hear anything. So I'm like one at a time, one at a time. And then just in the back, this guy yells out the gray door, said to go to the green door. And then the whole crowd just goes, ah, like, you know, don't go there. And I was like, I was like, I don't even need you guys to say that. The green door just sounds like some creepy serial killer place. So I go, I'm not fucking going there. So then somebody said by, forget the fuck it was called the Cadillac lounge or something. I took a picture of it. So, um,

Speaker 4:          00:35:01       I, uh,

Speaker 1:          00:35:03       I decide, you know, all right, that's where the fuck we'll go. We'll go over to this thing. I'm actually looking at the picture right now on my, uh, on my phone here.

Speaker 4:          00:35:14       Okay,

Speaker 1:          00:35:14       come on. Come on. Where is it? Where is it? There it is. The Cadillac

Speaker 1:          00:35:22       Cadillac ranch. Sorry. So we go in there, you know, there's a big American flag lit up on the side. I'm like, all right, here we go. Let's fucking go in there and see what this place is about. And we went in there and I gotta tell you, man, it was the most diverse group of people I've ever seen in my life. And I think for the simple fact, there was no other place to go. So there was like a group of bikers, there was, there was soldiers, um, there was like ranchers, there was a group of lesbians, and then there was just filler people that you couldn't really tell what the fuck they were. They was older, younger, the whole fucking thing. So we're in, they're like, wow man, this is fucking, this is nuts. And then it had a real, like cowboy can of feel to it.

Speaker 1:          00:36:09       Yet there was like a fucking Dj play in like modern music. It was this, it was fucked. So we're in there and dean for whatever fucking reason is just pointing at Shit. And people go and look at that fucking guy, look at this shit, look at it. It's fucking bar. And I'm sitting there going, Dean, stop pointing. It's shit. Stop Pointing Shit. You know, Dean's been sober for like 20 fucking years, so he's got no excuse. He just kept but pointed shit. Um, and then finally, you know, I had a, you know, I was talking to a couple of the people in there talking to this guy that was in the middle of taking a two year welding class, which of course was really interesting to me. I was talking to about that shit. I was talking to some other people in, uh, then at one point somebody said, hey, you want to a whiskey?

Speaker 1:          00:36:51       So like, um, my thing now when I go on the road and I drink, I have a beer and uh, in a whiskey or a scotch and then that's it. I call it a fucking night and it's been working out great for me, you know what I mean? So I have a nice little taste, but then I don't get hammered and then I'm fine the next morning and I can work out and shit. Right. So, uh, this guy offers, you know, it comes over, hey, you know, I got to buy a drink. I said, well, I'm just getting a beer. And I said, well, all right, well, you know, I was going to get a whiskey too. He goes, what do you want? He goes, we've got a local fucking Wyoming whiskey. I was like, all right, when is shy? Let's fucking do it. Right? So he gets me this fucking shot and he brings it over and it looked, it was almost like seethrough.

Speaker 1:          00:37:33       Now I don't know if if they did whiskey and water or what, but I fucking took a sip of it and it had no bite or anything. I was just looking, I'm like, dude, what the fuck is this? He goes, he goes, well, it hasn't been aged at all. I've got to tell you, dude, it was the worst whiskey I've ever had in my apology to the person who bought me the shot. I couldn't finish it. I looked, I said, Dina, go look at this fucking thing. And he was just like, yeah, dude, that looks like piss. So, um, and then at that point I wasn't looking, but dean was saying that the biker people were mean mugging everybody and he goes to, let's get the fuck out of here. So we get out of there and, uh, oh, as we were driving over there, I noticed that there was a drive, there was a liquor store with a drive through.

Speaker 1:          00:38:12       So I was like, Oh God, I gotta get a picture of that. So I get pulled over, I get a picture of it. And then I'm just like, dude, I got to do it. I got to go to a drive through liquor store. So I fucking pull up. We actually, I posted video of this and I just wanted to get one beer and the guy goes, well, I can give you like the 24 ounce. So I got like a Budweiser, um, I'll repost the video, the, uh, the, the Monday morning podcast, Twitter page. So I went up, I ordered a fucking beer. And what was really cool is that had the old fucking remember the old air hoses when you would pull up at the, the, uh, the gas station and it would ring the bell, like, Dang, Dang, as your, as your car pulled in. It was so fucking cool. And, um, we was sitting there and then this dude just sort of walked into the place or whatever. And as we drive out, there's an Arby's across the street, which I never fucking eat, you know, fucking fast food roasts, roast beef. I mean, I like to think I'm a courageous person, but that's just a little, that's, that gets a little too shady for me. Right. I'd rather eat the pink slime. Um, so anyways, uh,

Speaker 1:          00:39:20       del Ray's going like came in and it goes, let's hit the Arby's. I'm hungry. So I go, all right, so we go into the Arby's, right? He owed us some shit and then I ordered like some chicken sliders, which I shouldn't have fucking got. They were fucking disgusting. It was like eating the, he'll have some chicks fucking boot boot, you know, just the way they were shaped like clogs, they would just fucking gross. So, um, we go around to the drive through and this is right across from the drive through liquor store. And I look across the street and I read the sign and what does it say? It says the green door.

Speaker 1:          00:39:53       So the drive through liquor store is part of this shady fucking teddy bar called the green door. That urban legend said that there was a one legged stripper and now the younger me would have been like, I got to go in and go see that shit. The older me goes like, oh my God, that's somebody's daughter. So I'm so technically I kind of did go to the green door. I didn't, I didn't go in there. I just fucking pulled up or whatever. So I'll, I'll, I'll post some pictures of that shit. Um, let me see if I actually took them. So, and then the next day we got up right. And we want it to go to some local place to get a, uh, to get breakfast. And we went to this local place and I don't know if the regular chef was out of town, but I ordered eggs over easy and I cut into them.

Speaker 1:          00:40:41       Dude, they were so under cooked. Like it came out clear, like the white part of the egg was still clear. Like, you know, when those people drink like egg whites, it was like that. And so deans, eggs were the same way. And a, I just never sent food back. So I just started them in with the fucking Hash. I mean, they should have just served the eggs and a glass like fucking rocky Balboa and I just suck it down. And I noticed a woman diagonally from me, she sent her eggs back to, and then in the end when I went to, uh, I went to pay, she was just like, how was it? And then when I said it was great, I kind of stumbled on when it was great. It was great. And then she goes, and then she immediately looked up, she goes, is everything okay? Is Everything okay? So I've just guessing that the, the normal chef was out of town, so I'm not going to out this place is being a, uh, as being something bad. But, uh,

Speaker 1:          00:41:33       it was pretty rough. It was one of the worst breakfast as I've ever had. But, uh, when we, when we came back down, we'd drive down to Denver. I lived for like a little kid right now. Like, I'm just telling you every moment of this fucking, this tour, but a dean's a big motorcycle guy. It's been Ryan for 30 years. So they had this huge fucking Harley Davidson dealership right on the 25 as we would come down. So we stopped in and I didn't know, but Harley has a new bike that's just right out of my childhood. It's called the 72. And it's got the big spoked front wheel. It's got the handle bars, it's like fucking Arthur Fonzie rallies bike, which obviously was fucking, uh, from the, the, you know, the 50s or whatever. But um, I haven't written in like a year and a half and, uh, I dunno man. I think I got to ride that bike. I think I'm going to rent it just one day. There's a park up around where I'm at. I've co Brent it on like a Sunday and just go up there in the morning time and just fucking ride around and bring it back on. Too much of a pussy to ride all the time because uh, you know, I got too much to fucking lose and um,

Speaker 1:          00:42:39       oh my God, they had one in, in this black and gold metal flake was fucking, it's just perfect man. As much as I love the road king, like every one to be motorcycle rider who watched a couple episodes of, uh, whatever that fucking show was, what was that fucking show there that everybody watched about? About the bikes? Um,

Speaker 1:          00:43:00       you know, like every fucking want to be bad ass who doesn't have a tattoo and it's not a motorcycle guy. Like Delray took a picture of me on the fucking 70 to 72 and I just started laughing. I was like, how much, how much am I not a motorcycle guy? Like, do you realize if what a fucking nerd you have to look like to sit on a Harley and still look like a fucking still look like somebody you could pulley? I look like every fucking just white dude having a midlife crisis. They're like, you know who watched it? What is that fucking show? What is the fucking show that was all about the motorcycles that everybody watched. I never got into it. Um,

Speaker 1:          00:43:43       goddammit, it's the perfect reference for this shit. But um, anyways, I might have to rent one coming up, uh, my go ride a dirt bike and get my fucking, my skills back up to the ridiculously low level that they were. I just go to a local park out here and I just drive this loop around and around and around. It's actually good because a, there's a lot of downshift and then that shit a lot of turns. You got to look your way through all this shit that I learned in the safety course and everything. But like I told you guys, so one time when I rode a motorcycle down sunset all the way out to the beach, just like, I want it to just thinking this is going to feel, you know, freedom man America. Right. And I was going to see all this shit, dude, I didn't see shit. I was fucking terrified. There was just too many fucking people. And um,

Speaker 1:          00:44:29       you know, we went later than I wanted to go. I rode with Dean and dean. Yeah. You know, I had done spots so he didn't get up til like 10, so we didn't get on the road till like 11. And I want it to go at like seven in the fucking morning when there was nobody on the road and really just be able to relax a little bit and not have somebody right behind me. Uh, and I just remember getting off the bike and I was like shaking and I was just like, I had to have that fucking get out of your ego moment and just be like, Bill, this isn't you. You don't have this in your blood. You're not a motorcycle fucking guy. He just not, so don't be that shithead. And, uh, I immediately sold the bike or get rid of it, whatever the fuck.

Speaker 1:          00:45:07       I don't even remember. But, um, I dunno. I think every once in a while, if, you know, I smoke a couple cigars a month, I got that under control for every once in a while I run a motorcycle and I know everybody's going to fucking be like, Oh, who jokes reward, you're a Jewish cause you're going to be focusing rusty. I right. Taking all the fun out of everything. Um, all right. Oh also, uh, this week, uh, I got back into like drinking juices and shit and there was this fucking algae shit, which was disgusting when I drank it. But I felt amazing afterwards and I'm trying to, uh, you know, like Dean said, you know, it's a good addiction to have. Like you get addicted to shit. I realized that. And if you're addicted to like working out good stuff, that's obviously a much better thing for you.

Speaker 1:          00:45:56       So I might try to get back into that type of stuff. But anyways, um, this, uh, this past weekend, on Saturday night when I got back, I went to a, uh, this music music cares event. And, um, every year they honor somebody and whoever they're honoring, everybody comes out. And I'm just does this person's music. So say they wandering, ACDC, a bunch of famous fucking musicians that are into ACDC would come out and do all their songs and switch them up and do different versions of them. So it was Lionel Richie, right? Oh, word. A feeling, right. So I go to this fucking thing and uh, it was unreal. It was like Lenny Kravis usher, who I couldn't believe how small he was. He fucking crushed it. Um, John Legend, Stevie wonder. All right, all these monsters. And then Stevie wonder, and I knew Dave Grohl was going to go on and I'm like, kind of fuck is Dave Grohl gonna follow it?

Speaker 1:          00:47:00       Is he going to play drums and saying, is he going to do the, come out with his blue guitar and sing? And he just went up and just sang a song. That was it. He told his fucking story about, you know, when he broke his leg or very fell off the stage where he broke his leg. He was talking about all the outpouring from the fans and all that. And then one day he just got this giant fucking basket of muffins, the biggest basket, I guess ever. This fucking giant thing. And there was no note or anything on, and he's, he's telling this story that the band sorta just playing, you know, some music underneath it and he's telling this story. He's got people laughing, but they're listening and all that shit. And then like two days later, I guess he got a, he got a, a, a call from his manager who said, yeah, uh, Lionel Richie, Lionel Richie just called up to see if you got the fucking giant basket of muffins.

Speaker 1:          00:47:55       And then he just goes, uh, so I just, you know, I forget how we fucking ended the story. I'm butchering it now, right as the ends the store and you realize that it was Lionel Richie, they kick into that his song. You are Dave Grohl just crushed it in the, let's argue are there's something in you are the rain. And he just was up there singing it. Fucking crushed. It went on after Stevie wonder and crushed it. Um, so I, I got to, I got to do that. You know, it was funny. It was, uh, I, I went down there and, um, you know, I'm not a suit guy, but you had to wear like a shirt and tie dude. And I swear to God, like, I dunno, just like me when I was on the motorcycle when I had on that suit and tie, dude, I don't know what it was.

Speaker 1:          00:48:41       Sometimes I look all right, but, uh, the thing about suits is if you, if you, you got to buy them, like they go on a style really quick, and this one was like three, four years old. I just gotten a dry clean to some show the last time I wore it. And I put this fucking thing on. And, uh, I was talking to Neil, I was like, and I just kept going. I look like an asshole right there. And like, she's like, no, you look fine again. Yeah, I don't think so. I looked like an asshole. So the whole fucking night, um, you know, anytime I would walk into the bathroom, you know, it was a long fucking night, was like a four hour fucking thing, you know? And, uh, anytime I would go in there and I would wash my hands and I would just sit there and I would look at myself in the mirror.

Speaker 1:          00:49:20       I just kept laughing. What a fucking jerk off I look like a, I know it wasn't a good scene, you know, I don't like hate myself. It's not good place for me to be like say I think it's time to retire that suit. Um, all right, let's get into some of the, uh, some of the fucking questions here for the week. Um, uh, here we go. A judge Scalia, bill listener from Virginia here, the death of Judge Scalia brought out some jokes on social media and a lot of people took the angle that they were happy that he died. Now I'm a, I'm assuming this is somebody on the supreme court because I don't pay attention to shit, but I did see some stuff about this is the first time the supreme court won't be conservative. He goes, what's your position on making jokes about being happy people died.

Speaker 1:          00:50:11       Thanks for, for, for that. Laughs and give me thank you. Thanks for the laughs. Um, my position on making joke about, well yeah, I think he got a be, uh, I think you gotta be like a dictator for people to do shit like that. Yeah. I mean, I wouldn't say don't do it because there's always a joke. I mean, someday when I die, there's going to be a joke. I mean, I know, and if I'm hovering around is a ghost, I'm going to laugh about it. What the fuck do I care? I'm a ghost at that point, right. I didn't go to hell. All right. I'm floating around. I could deal with this. Uh, but yeah, I don't do that. Um, well look, if you just make a joke joke, that's fine, but if you're doing it because you didn't share like their political views, uh, yeah, I'm not into

Speaker 2:          00:51:03       doing that type of shit. Like, you know, some, some Shithead, I'm going to start doing this. Like the shit had tweeted the week. Somebody sent me a text today telling me that I needed to distance myself. Bill, just to let you know, you need to distance yourself from so and so. Um, and then sent me a link and this is somebody that had been friends with for 20 fucking years. And then I see this link and it has to do with being a vegetarian or eating meat and the name of the video is so and so is an ignorant moron, which right there I love, like that's your angle, like to get someone to listen to your opinion right there. I just look at it like this is just, this is just somebody trying to make a name for themselves, trashing somebody that, that has made a name for themselves, you know, with some over the top title. First of all, I love is an ignorant moron. Like that's like redundant,

Speaker 1:          00:52:00       you know, he's a stupid, not smart person. I'm like, I need to distance myself from some, from someone who's been a great friend for 20 years because of their dietary decisions, you know, because they talk about food and nutrition in a way that's a truth that they believe in all of us, you know, like, and then, and, and what, you're a fucking genius, you know, and it's just, you know, I dunno. I Dunno why people do shit like that. So that kind of ties into you and I would never, obviously, you know, that's, I don't know, I would never tweet it. Somebody like that. You need to distance yourself from this person because I don't agree with their workout regimen. And the same thing with like, that, like, I wouldn't be happy that somebody died because I didn't like their political views. You know what I mean? I always have that in my head. They add somebody's dad, somebody's husband or some shit, you know, whatever. He was a gay judge. That's somebody's boyfriend right out of fucking know. I, yeah. I don't do shit like that, but if somebody does, you know, I'm not the comedy fucking police.

Speaker 2:          00:53:06       Um, all right. Summer home bill. My wife wants to own a home by a lake in New Hampshire. That's fucking awesome. I'm trying to convince her that it's cheaper to just rent a sick house every summer for a couple of weeks. Instead of paying 15 grand a year in taxes on top of the mortgage, help me sort out business. Please go fuck yourself. Well, what I would say is a,

Speaker 2:          00:53:30       you know, you can rent out your house, your summerhouse, you know, this is what I would do. Okay. I would, I would buy that house on the lake and then I would just rent the whole fucking, yeah. And then whenever I wanted to go, I would rent some other place. You know what I mean? And this is how I'm weird because I wouldn't want to go into a place that I own no one that everybody fucked in my bed. I would rather go to a place knowing that a bunch of people fucked it, somebody else's bed. It makes no sense. What you should do is buy it and then rent it out. I mean, buying property is always great. However, if you're having a rough time, like I, I'm a big believer in no paying down your first house,

Speaker 4:          00:54:20       mmm.

Speaker 2:          00:54:23       You should really pay that thing down and get it under control before you go and get a summer house. And I do know that in relationships, when it comes to money, there's usually one person understands it and the other person doesn't understand it and they want everything yesterday and you might be a little more conservative, which is what you sound like. So, um,

Speaker 4:          00:54:47       okay.

Speaker 2:          00:54:48       I, you know, I would just sit down and just say, look, first of all, you're in a great position because it doesn't sound like she can just go out and pull the trigger itself. So I just say, listen, I definitely want to do that, but we need to, we need to pay down this house a little bit or, you know, if we can't afford it, let's buy it and then we'll rent the thing out all the weekends that we're not going to be there. Um, I think that's definitely, it's definitely a smart way to do it. But, uh, I would just sit down,

Speaker 4:          00:55:18       okay.

Speaker 2:          00:55:19       And write out all the points that you want to make and then draw a smiley face. This is what I do when I'm being a smart person because I know how short a fuse I have. And, uh, I write all this shit out, everything that I want to say and all that stuff. And then I draw a smiley face reminding me to not lose my temper, reminding me that other people are entitled to have different opinions and uh, you know, and not to be a cunt. I didn't do that a couple of days ago and ended up having a big stupid fight over the, the bathroom sink. You know, I'd gone on the road in a ditch, start, started to clog up and I didn't have time to fucking fix it, but you know, we had drain up. So I figured, you know, my wife would fucking handle it and I come home to brush my teeth and I turn it on and within fucking two seconds, it's already filling up as a puddle. It's completely backed up

Speaker 4:          00:56:16       and you know,

Speaker 2:          00:56:19       it's usual shit, usual shit in a relationship. You say to somebody, did you know her? No, I didn't notice. And in your head you like, how the fuck did you not notice the shit? But what I learned in that argument is I have to understand that this shit that she's looking at me yet

Speaker 1:          00:56:35       looking at me at about like, how the fuck do you not notice it? And it's just cause I'm just not wired like that. And that's why you get married. Hopefully you're a yin and a Yang. I finally set him right. I didn't say ying and Yang. I said, yen, Y I n I think that's the first time publicly I've ever said it right. Um, yeah, they're going to be good at this shit that you're not good at. And um, actually had a great day with Nia yesterday. Like I didn't do shit for once and we just hung out all day. And um, you know, we watched some movies and shit. You made a little bit of food. And I always forget that, that every once in a while you guys, you got to hang out with each other rather than just being roommates to remind yourself like, oh yeah, that's right. We actually really love each other. I forgot about that shit and I don't know the amount of times I've had to fucking learn that, you know, she getting married, you really start doing the math like dude, fuck too shit. I don't need anything. I will literally give her everything.

Speaker 2:          00:57:37       I will fucking just give you fucking everything and I will walk out with the shirt on my fucking back and I will start all over again. Like I think that that's the way to fucking do it and just walked down the street after it like Johnny fucking Appleseed.

Speaker 1:          00:57:53       Um, cause I really think you just get into having all of this fucking stuff, but if you just let go of all of it, then you don't have it. I think getting divorced could be a really light feeling.

Speaker 2:          00:58:05       This is how far I went over an argument over a clogged up sink before it came to my senses. I was walking down the street with the, with the stick with the Bandana and a peanut butter and jelly sandwich in it. And I was just fine.

Speaker 1:          00:58:17       What am I doing? You know, stop being a fucking idiot. All right, let's get to some advertising here. All right, me undies, everybody.

Speaker 4:          00:59:48       No,

Speaker 2:          00:59:50       I have a little respect for yourself. You know, and then if you, you know, you're with the person intimately, you can give it to them, you know, there's no fucking way actually as a joke, you can do that,

Speaker 4:          00:59:59       you know?

Speaker 1:          01:00:00       Do you know what was actually thinking the other day when I went to buy my wife a Valentine's Day card? You know, I was looking for the blank ones cause I hate the fucking Valentine's Day cards. You know, they're either over the top gross or they're just fucking like too distant, you know, it's very hard to find that one. That's the nice balance of I love you but let's not be gross. So I was looking for the blank ones and I came to the sympathy cards and uh, I just was thinking like, you know what, I really want to stand up with Joe de Rosa again and then sent him a sympathy card afterwards, you know, telling him I hope he feels better and everything and just basically, right. Joe, I saw your set last night. I know you're going through a rough time.

Speaker 2:          01:00:43       Um, I dunno, it was funny to me. Anyways, let's get back to me and he's saying treat yourself and your boo two a matching pair of me.

Um, I went to high school with the guy who picks up my trash. I get along with them and I always wave and sometimes if he's not rushing, I'll have a short conversation with them. Last week I saw my neighbor yell at him. He wasn't a, he wasn't a jerk back, but he wasn't a dick either.

Speaker 1:          01:03:21       What? He wasn't a jerk back, but he wasn't a dick either. Later on that day, my neighbor came over and asked me if I'd make a statement about the issue that he harassed her. I saw the whole thing go down. He didn't harass her. She yelled at him for coming a day late during a week when a holiday pushed everything back a day in terms of sanitation, pickup a what? A cunt. She said that even without my statement, she's going to press charges and file a complaint. I'm going to call the town or police and let them know what's going on. I'm so livid that she would ruin this guy's life. He's a great dude. Thoughts on how we should handle this? Should I report her for lying apps? A fuckin lutely and I would take time off from work to testify that she's Elian whore apps.

Speaker 1:          01:04:06       A fuckin lutely. Who the fuck yells in a trash man? The service that they're providing. Fuck her. Fuck her. Do you know something? I would 100% do it and I would, I would even fucking tell her that you're going to do it at some point. Not Not in the beginning because you don't want to weaken his case. But I would do it without a doubt. And when the whole fucking thing goes away, I would let her know that you did that and I would let her know what a small person you think she is and that she's disgusting and to stay away from you and anybody else that you love because she subhuman there. I was at the limit dilemma. Dear Bill. Oh, what a fucking whore. He came in day late and then you harassed me to, you know what? You know what she I, you know what? I bet she does for a living. She sounds like a blogger. Always playing the fucking victim and always going down and just trying to get somebody in trouble and try and fuck over there. Their ability, you know, to earn a living. What a fucking Twat. All right. Derek, would you rather have to live in an air balloon for a month? Never you having set down or would you rather live in a submarine?

Speaker 1:          01:05:18       Never breathing the surface for a whole month. Both scare the shit out of me for a whole month, but I think I choose the submarine seems more natural. Yeah. And there's also a bathroom. I wouldn't want to have to shit on people and p why, but obviously wait till I was over a a rural area. Yeah. Plus you'd be inside, you'd have a bed. If you, when you were in the submarine, you have a blanket, you know, you get to be down there with all the fellows. Hey. Um, no man. I mean, I think it would be cool to fucking look out the window and see all the fucking, uh, the sea life and all that shit. I would go fucking nuts down there. But, um, I don't know. Fucking up there in an air balloon gets cold or hot. You're really dealing with the fucking elements when you're up there and starts fucking raining. Uh,

Speaker 1:          01:06:22       yeah, I dunno. I W I would be a, I would get over that really quickly, but I think being in a sub, you know, you're down there, you get flake cards so you could fucking break each other's balls or whatever. I don't know. Yeah, I definitely would take, I would much rather do with sub. Um, and if I had to die either way, I'd rather die in a sub. I'd rather have it just fucking, you know, if you're going to die in the cell, it's going to be quick. You know, it's just, it's just over, right. I don't know. Yeah. I don't know. Sometimes maybe it might not be quick. They close that door. Yeah. Those are two terrifying. Thanks. I got to go with you. Got To go with you on that. Um,

Speaker 4:          01:07:02       okay.

Speaker 1:          01:07:04       Alright. Dilemma Billy boy. Uh, if you had to choose which holiday to get canceled and never celebrate again, would you choose Valentine's Day or President's Day? Who deserves more recognition, your girl for doing what you do all year without a holiday. That's hilarious. Yeah. We don't get a holiday. Um, no. Maybe I read that wrong. Or presidents who may or may not be horrible people who hurt the country. I canceled president's Day because I'd rather keep the one that involved chocolate being around. Oh, that's a good reason for it. Um, if I had to get rid of one, I don't think anybody really celebrates president's Day. I don't really consider it a day off. It's kind of like flag day, you know what I mean? Or a buttermilk pancakes day. Isn't there one of those fucking days to, um, cheeses? Do you want me to cancel a holiday? Uh, I would cancel Valentine's Day just because women like it so much. Believe it or not, I am a concert, but I'm not that fucking bad. So I'd keep that one. Yeah. You know what? Fuck Presidents' Day. All those guys are bought and sold any ways. You've seen it with Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders. You've seen how the Democrats had just going to pick her because going to play ball,

Speaker 2:          01:08:16       they're all tied into the fucking, the fucking, I don't know what you want to call it. Did she? She that Bernie Sanders is too fucking radical. He's going to switch shit up too much and then they're not going to work with them. Even if Bernie Sanders gets fucking elected, they're not going to work with them. They're gonna show their fucking true colors. There are a bunch of that. Just a bunch of, they're all bought and paid for it. They don't. Well, how the fuck do the Clinton's got $3 million to throw their kid a wedding? You know what I mean? We have fucking break. Cause you went out, you gave speeches to all the people that fucking financed your campaign and then you hook them up and look the other fucking way. I swear to God, I swear to God. Do you want to have the fucking pharmaceutical companies and the people who fucked up the food supplier able to do it and there's not, there's nothing behind it is cause they fucking paid everybody off.

Speaker 2:          01:09:06       I swear to God. All right, I'm on my stomach on my eye is, this is why I always vote for that third party guy. And everybody goes, Oh, you throwing away your fucking vote. How is thrown away my fucking vote? Vote for somebody as a decent fucking human being. I swear to God, people, they, they, they don't want to try to do what's right. They just want to win. They want to be like, go buy one again. See that every time I sit there and I trashed people for fucking given the public opinion, then look, I meet the gumby. I do the exact same thing. I am what's known as a hypocrite. The HIPAA can't. Alright, that's the a, the podcast for this week. Um, I want to thank everybody that came out, Cheyenne, Wyoming, a, I know it was last second, but uh, I had a great time.

Speaker 2:          01:09:49       At a great time in your, uh, your, your state capital. Uh, Joe was just a really, really cool fucking town and I had a great time in the Cadillac ranch there. That sounds, I swear to God, like the fucking bunny ranch. It sounds like a fucking whore house, but it wasn't, um, it was cool talking to the people there and thank you to everybody. You know the bought me a beer and a shot and all that shit. Thank you everybody. Denver by the way, which was just a fucking insane show. Um, that was another thing, special one. Just cause I'd done so many fucking gigs in Colorado in the middle of nowhere. I always bring up Arapahoe community college. I'll never forget that. Nooner where they had me standing in an area where three hallways met right before class ended. That was a fucking nightmare. Next to a popcorn machine and five people scattered out about 40 chairs, empty chairs. Anyways, that's a podcast for this week. Uh, I'm going to try to watch some Celtics and get caught up on the Bruins games, um, and keep drinking my juice. All right. Go Fuck Yourself. I'll talk to you later on this week.
