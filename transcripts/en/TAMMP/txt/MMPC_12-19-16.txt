Just the level with which that sits fucking, I guess because of technology, I am able to do this. You know, if it was back in the day, I would not be able to do this. What is this you, you ask, maybe you didn't ask. Maybe I'm doing that thing where I'm putting words in your mouth, but if you did ask, you know, doing a podcast, you know, I guess there's always a price to pay and I think that, I think that that's one to grow on.

Speaker 1:          00:00:59       Maybe that's the lesson. I swear to God, I want to start a fucking church. I got to do it.

Yet I dream of genie and the fucking guy would Tejas wouldn't banger.

Speaker 1:          00:01:56       I've talked about this shit before. I remember watching as a kid. It's like he'd go, why don't you like rubbing up against her or something? You know? I don't even know what sex was. You know, why? Because it was no internet. Now if there was internet back when I was watching that show and I was like seven or eight, uh, you know, I would have been like, why does it need, why did you are a fucking prefers job? He style over the fucking genie lamp, you know? I wouldn't know extra shit. What the fuck is wrong with kids nowadays? It's like they just take ticket island. Mel, I'm going on. An old man ran, they get on these fucking computers, right? The parents are like me. They don't know how to work them. They're not even interested in him. You know, we're in the fucking corner and making homemade apple cider, getting ready for the holidays, you know, wearing a Christmas sweater that we think actually it looks good. We're not wearing it. Ironically, will it go, this is my Christmas sweater, Joe, my fucking mother's sell this together for me when I was in high school, still fit. You know, sweater is always still fits because they stretch. They like the sweatpants for your torso. You know, it takes a while. Like if you have a homemade sweater, you know, one of those lobster fishermen. Once that your mom would make you know and she just give it to you in the bag that she bought the yarn and you know,

Speaker 2:          00:03:13       yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:03:49       you got to come and meet with yard. That's the problem with all the mothers nowadays. You know what I mean? Did them and they fucking yard. They just won't let go of it. I'm just fucking with you. What kind of woman knows how to knit anymore? You know, trying to find a woman that knows how to knit is like trying to find a guy that knows, still knows how to hunt, you know what I mean? And that even goes for the fucking rednecks. You not doing it the way you fucking, you're, you're, you're way less fucking, I don't know what four wheeler fucking ancestors hunted, almost talk myself into a corner and I was like, God, I don't want to do the Hacky, you know, saying your grandfather who were first had sex with the fucking relative, you know, I didn't want to say that. I, I didn't want to go down that road. I don't even know if that's true, but how the fuck did that start? You know what I mean? One fucking guy banked his sister and then all of a sudden everybody out there that has a four wheeler, it's doing it. You know what I mean?

Speaker 2:          00:04:50       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:04:50       They can just take like, they don't have Facebook, you don't have to be lonely. I like, have they gotten more aggressive on that farmers? Only when they've really just started shitting on fucking city folk. You know what I mean? City folk just don't get it and they still make themselves look stupid. City folk just don't get it. They could go with global warming, they could go with overpopulation, they could go with quality of air, quality of life space. There's so many different directions. Did the hey, you want to come back to my place and you go there and it's like some fucking city apartment. You know what I mean? With like the kitchen is in the bedroom, you know, and the bed folds down from the wall that you could fucking attack them that way. You know what I mean? Someone true to trying to come through their window. May City folks just don't get it and then they go to their spread, right?

Speaker 2:          00:05:47       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:05:47       Fucking get your own parking space. She not driving around the block like for fucking nine hours trying to find alternative side of the street. Fucking parking. There's all these different things. Water levels rising. You know, I saw this one of these men in the street things I've been watching that debt channel Vice, you guys, what's the vice channel? It's a fucking great channel. Reminds me a lot of ways that a little bit of um, MTV during the early days where like they had a lot of funny promo commercials. I don't know why more fucking networks don't do that. Cause you know, he usually fast forward, I turned the channel when there's a commercial, but they get like, they are funny fucking commercials. Like there's some talk show on there. These two black dudes right now, at least one black dude and one guy sort of Puerto Rican maybe.

Speaker 1:          00:06:33       Uh, maybe he's light skinned. I don't know. I'm too white to understand. Right. So they, they do a talk show, so they're hyping it and they're showing like the New York City skyline, like they always do before a talk show. And it was a, I'm going to fuck up the joke. It was something like no big guests, no band, no audience, no white dudes and a then they cut to the Promo and somebody comes out, you know, and I can know what the fuck was. I was watching, I was like, this is funny. This looks like way back in the day when I would see like Randy, the redwoods agenda, taxi driver, you know, they would have like funny promos. I Dunno why they ever got away from that. But, um, anyways, Oh, speaking of that, speaking of non whities, um, I saw a fucking front man this weekend and abandon it was fucking unbelievable, right?

Speaker 1:          00:07:21       I went down, um, uh, the other day I did, uh, the dark matter podcast, um, which is Dave Navarro's plowed cast. And um, had a great time on that. And afterwards they were like, yeah, hey, Dave's doing his show down at the Roxy. You want to come down Friday, Saturday night? I guess he, I mean I'm, I'm in the dark hair. Literally, no pun intended. I didn't know he did this just Christmas show every year. Um, and it was like an all star lineup. You don't know who the fuck's coming out and um, you just go to the show and then they just start bringing people out. And um, so I went down there to go see the show and I mean, I knew it was going to be good. Dude. It was fucking ridiculous, the amount of people that they had coming out, which of course I'm going to fucking forget the names and everything, but uh, you just, you know, some of them come out, this guy, because they sang student sang the immigrant song and something else and fucking murdered it.

Speaker 1:          00:08:16       I never even heard of the guy fucking murdered at the band was unbelievable. The viral was killing it. And then they, then they brought out Macy gray and then she sang, uh, the fuck did she saying she's saying the pretenders brass in pocket and then she's saying Radiohead creep. I was just like, Jesus Christ, what the fuck? And then they brought out Cypress Hill and no one was doing like their own style of music that everybody would like switch it up. So then they bring out this, they get this fucking intro, which no performer wants to get. Right. The guy goes to do the intro and he just goes, you know, Billy Morrison was, and just fucking everybody, right? It goes, um, all right, this next guy, you know, people suggested him for this show. Uh, you know, first few like gay, you know, we don't know. We don't know if he's right for this show.

Speaker 1:          00:09:10       And then we saw him and he absolutely blew us away. Our jaws were on the ground. I'm telling you, this fucking guy is unbelievable, Yada Yada. And I'm thinking, I was in the crowd going, oh no, not that. That intro was to fucking war. You can't follow it. It's, I can stand up comedy. This guy he's wanting to on a best work in comms today, he reinvented the Mike Stand, eh, Betty Murphy was still doing stand up. He'd be be asking this guy to write from it. You know, they start giving you a fucking intro like that. You'd sit in the back like guy, he tone it down, tone it down, right to this guy came out and totally fucking lived up to it. It's this guy, he's a rapper. I man, I don't know shit about hip hop or anything like this Guy Post Malone. So the guy on stage, for whatever reason, I said this guy's responsible for Justin Bieber's career.

Speaker 1:          00:10:00       Right. Which I don't know why you would say that in front of a bunch of fucking 40 to 50 something year old white people. Right. So this dude comes walking out and there's a few people bowing like couple, you know, like five people because of the Justin Bieber thing. I love people in their forties and 50s who fucking talk about how bad Justin Bieber's music is. It's like, really, it doesn't speak to you. You're fucking dope. It's not for you. You know what I mean? That's like getting mad at the fucking a, I don't to insult the guy, but you know what I mean? It's, it's for, it's for younger people. You know what I mean? I think camp like, I don't understand people getting their forties and 50s and they just, they, they don't understand that, um, somebody, his perspective as a 20 something year old is not going to seem like the same as theirs.

Speaker 1:          00:10:53       And we sit there going like, what the fuck is he tied that? And like, that's bullshit. That's a, that's a stupid Bible, blah, blah, blah. And it's like, yeah, yeah. That's what you did when you were there that age and somebody, he'll be in his forties and look back at himself at 2123 gun. What the fuck was I thinking? Right. Somehow like four or five people don't get it and they literally Boeing, you know Justin Bieber at a show, Justin Bieber is an ad. So this guy comes fucking walking out and he just walks up to the microphone and he goes, what's up la? I'm drunk as fuck. Right? So immediately the crowd just starts cheering and uh, he goes, I, you know, I'm using, you know, I'm a rapper and I know everybody I've, I was assuming, and the crowd was like, were you going like, yeah, I'm completely unfamiliar with you. I am a white guy pushing 50. I have no idea where you are. Right? So they start playing rage against the machine, killing in the name of, and I'm like going, Oh God, Oh, rappers gonna sig did they got the auto tune on? You know, is this going to be like, uh, so you're going to have too much deodorant under his arms? Like fucking ll cool j when he did the unplugged, what's going to happen here? Dude, this guy, this guy fucking murdered the song, fucking murdered this song.

Speaker 2:          00:12:06       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:12:06       Don't just took the whole thing to another level and it never came back down again. Everybody else match this guy. This fucking dude was unbelievably sang that song. And then he's saying, Alison chains wood and fucking murdered both of them. Um,

Speaker 2:          00:12:22       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:12:23       And you literally felt it in the crowd. Everybody on their phones going like, who the fuck is this guy? I got a dog download some of his shit. Um,

Speaker 2:          00:12:31       yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:12:31       Oh, and here's hilarious thing. So later on that weekend, I'm watching vice and there's another funny promo. He's sitting there, that Guy Post Malone, right? And I was sitting there with near gone. That's the fucking guy I saw that the guy that murdered that song, those two songs. Right. So, um,

Speaker 2:          00:12:47       yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:12:47       he was talking about conspiracy theory. I don't even know what the commercial was about. It was just him talking to another guy. I'm telling you, it's very like early days of MTV. He was just talking about conspiracy theory. And, uh, being able to teleport and he was just going like say, here's area 51, right? Which of course he picks that rather than saying San Diego, okay. He goes, here's area 51 right here. Here's Australia. If you want to fly from area 51 to Australia, you've got to fly all the way here. You know, and he draws the arc to it just didn't draw a straight line. Like someone actually understands aviation, right. Because this is what creeped me out because if you just drew a straight line, it'd be like, all right, this guy's, this guy's out of his mind. But the second he drew the arc, I'm like, Oh fuck, I'm buying into this theory, right? And he goes, um, and he goes, well, with teleportation, they just do stuff like this and he just takes the paper and the x area 51 was in the expo Australia's he just takes the paper and he just folds it. He pushes them together. He goes, it's like that. He goes, I know you guys think of mine in my mind, but I know this shit is true.

Speaker 1:          00:13:51       And I was like, this guy's brain. That's what my brain tells me, you know. So I don't know anything about any of his, any of his, uh,

Speaker 2:          00:14:01       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:14:01       Any of his music. But I'm definitely gonna Watch, download some of his shit. If anybody knows what is best album is or whatever, you know, a good jump off point for that guy. Um, it would be, it would be, uh, be tremendous. Um, so anyways, oh by the way, in a viral fucking killed the guitar solo in that too. I was wondering how the hell he was going to do it. And I don't know if they came up with a, uh, an effects pedal that made the noise that the dude from a

Speaker 2:          00:14:27       okay,

Speaker 1:          00:14:27       you know, fucking rage against the machine. You know, cause he, when he came out of here that will, those weird sounds that he made, I don't know. You know, I was in over my head musically about fucking 15 minutes ago, but whatever. And I want to thank everybody at dark matter for, uh, for hooking me up to see that show.

Speaker 2:          00:14:45       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:14:45       It was fucking great, man. Just a great God damn show. So of course I talked to Dean del Rey who everything. He goes, Oh yeah man, I, he goes, I went to that show it like the fifth anniversary. And it was like fucking Ozzie, Lemmy and Steven Tyler. And I was just like, Oh fuck you man. Fucking, you're never going to beat Dean del Ray with the fucking, uh, I went to a concert story, fucking guy seen everything. So anyway, so I'm watching this vice channel. I know, I'm just plowing through this shit fucking all over the place. Um, and my wife just kept, you know, recording this shit. They were co she recorded something about, um,

Speaker 2:          00:15:26       okay,

Speaker 1:          00:15:27       like Dj's, she recorded something about these fucking kids of those, you know, oil barons or whatever, oil money in Saudi Arabia. So watching both of these, right. The DJ thing, you know, it's just something I'd seen before the show and how much money that they're making. And I'm in Vegas. And, uh, it was funny though, actually actually actually asking a couple of them what the future was in a few of them understood it. And a few of them are just like, yeah, it's never going to end. It's like, dude, at some point you're going to be the bgs in January of 1980 it happens to all genres of music and the in the so few bands figuring out how to do it, how to age gracefully from one era to another. Um, and like I was saying like, I think I was talking about that and I can't remember what fucking podcasts is. You have to, I don't know how to do it, but somehow you have to, like, your music has to age with you so you don't look like a fucking moron. Um, like Justin Bieber has got to write some fucking middle age shit when he's in his middle age, you know,

Speaker 1:          00:16:41       cause he can't be singing about whatever the, whatever the fuck he thinks about, you know what I mean? They look stupid at 40, you know, and it makes every people, everybody in the crowd feels old. Then you start, oh my God, we're gonna die. You know, you just see your mortality when they come out. I mean, the first time that I saw that was when, uh,

Speaker 2:          00:17:00       okay,

Speaker 1:          00:17:01       like 10 years ago when David Lee Roth came back with van Halen and I went to go see van Halen, I was like, oh my God, this is going to be fucking great, right. I can't believe he's back. I saw a diamond, Dave went on the Itam and smile tours can be easily thrown, you know, just think he's gonna be throwing fucking kicks and jumping off the stage doing the fucking split. Right. And a dude, he came walking out on stage and I sweated within two. I was like, oh my God. And like put it five seconds is like, ah, fuck. He's all dumb old. We're going to die. Like this wave of fucking depression just hit me until I really realized like, wait a minute. Like, you know, guitarists and drummers don't get old. I mean, they do, but like, you know, they can still fucking, you know, if they have a technique or whatever, they can still fucking,

Speaker 3:          00:17:52       yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:17:52       Still fucking shred and I forgot that Eddie and Alex have been playing again for like 50 fucking years and they were unbelievable. The singer has it the worst because your voice naturally drops. And of course everyone from my era actually fucking sang, you know, not to shit on Justin Bieber born. I was watching that Dj thing on the vice channel. They fucking, um,

Speaker 3:          00:18:14       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:18:15       He shows up at some, some pool party, you know, where everybody's fucking, you know, turning the cameras around, doing selfies and the peace sign and the duck lips and all that shit. And he shows up to sing his song and he's just clearly fucking lips thinking he's not even trying to do a good job and everybody's freaking out. There was a few times, like he took the mic away from his mouth, pointed at the crowd. He could still hear him singing and nobody gave a shit. There was no band, there was nothing. And all these Yolo Douche is, we're going fucking nuts. It's like, how is that acceptable?

Speaker 1:          00:18:53       I don't know that, that shit makes me feel old. Like back in the day, if you ever got caught Milli Vanilli oh, the whole fucking he, Millie, Millie add vanilla, his whole fucking white through that. Nobody gave a Shit Twan 20, 30 fucking years earlier. You know, I guess it's cause those guys technically never even sang on the track. I dunno, everybody's doing fucking commercials now. I mean, I, it's just back in the, it's the whole thing is just changed. He just do whatever you want. You don't have to sing. You can fucking, uh, you know, you can lip sync your way with the, your hit song through a commercial for fucking under Roos and uh, it actually equates to more album downloads of a deli.

Speaker 1:          00:19:32       I should just be sitting on a porch right now watching young people walking by yelling at them. That's what this podcast is just slowly becoming. Um, so anyways, I'm watching that channel and uh, the next thing near recorded was a, this thing about the, uh, it looked like those same guys that I saw when I was in London. The Middle Eastern dudes who fly on a cargo plane, fly in all their fucking cars. With this same ridiculous rap, you know? Or maybe it's a paint job. I think it's a wrap that they put on there. You know what I mean? They've got like the fucking a, it's like that mirrored finish, like those three people in Shanna and now with the gold suit's still do that to like Mercedes and all that. Well, when they're back in their country, another status symbol is to own a, uh, like endangered species or a exotic animals is they call them.

Speaker 3:          00:20:24       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:20:25       And these fucking guys, they owned like a cheetahs and lions and tigers. It was the most disturbing fucking thing and aren't even coming into this and like a Peter Way, I just sat there going like, dude, that is a fucking lion. You've got it on a leash.

Speaker 3:          00:20:44       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:20:44       And these things kept, you know, they have their friends and they'd sort of lunge at him and then the friends would jump out of the way and be like, Whoa, Whoa, whoa. I'm like laughing. It's just like if you saw how big these fucking things where it's just like,

Speaker 2:          00:20:57       okay,

Speaker 1:          00:20:58       they could like sort of like at the 30% like bitch, slap a refrigerator and the thing would tip over and go flying across the fucking room. You know what I mean?

Speaker 1:          00:21:08       And these guys are fucking with DC, so this fucking lay goes over there. This white lady making white people look, look fucking stupid as shit. She's like, she fucking goes over to this guy's God damn house. He's got a giant fucking lion. All right? And he goes, well, we'll get, or a tiger assumption. And he goes, I will get you comfortable. We'll let you play with some smaller ones first. So she's playing with these little ones in. Immediately I say, I wouldn't fuck with that. I did. Long time ago I was on Opie and Anthony. They brought in a fucking baby tiger and little ones, little white ones is some shit. And they asked me if they wanted a whole, if I wanted to hold it. I was like, no. The thing was upset. It didn't want to fucking be there. And I've been scratched by a house cat fucking killed right now.

Speaker 1:          00:21:53       All it got me with one goddamn claw when write down my forearm, I had to put all this shit on it so I wouldn't get some sort of God damn disease. And I'm looking at this, this cute little baby tiger alive, whatever the fuck it was. And I sick freed and Roy once the Mariah Carey one where it's all fucking white, you know, and uh, I'm just looking at the size of its fucking pause. I'm like, then things pause already a like four times the size of a house cat. I've got scratched by a house cat. This thing's in a bad mood. I don't want to fuck, I don't want to deal with the thing. You know, it's funny, he's actually scratched Anthony, if I remember correctly. And he had to get like a tetanus shot or something, some sort of ointment had to be put on his fucking neck. So anyways, so this lady goes in there, right? And she's playing with them. She's like, oh my God, there's sword Jorell. And um, was really not impressed with the intellect of the woman that thought they could have got somebody a lot of fucking smarter. Right. So then she goes outside to meet this line.

Speaker 1:          00:22:55       Okay, this lioness, and there's no way to describe to you how big a fucking lion is. It's not very often that you get to see a person standing next to a Goddamn lied. She walks up to the, to in the general area, this thing and the things immediately looking at her, the way of fucking wild animal looks at you. You know what I mean? It's the same way. I've always said this is the same way, like a fucking hooker looks at you where there's no bullshit. You know, you're going to a bar, some woman looks at you, you know, chewing. If you know, she's just trying to get a fucking drink it, well, how could it looks at you? It's, it's a real deal. Like, yeah, I will fuck you. Okay. You have to circumstances or are, you know, if you got the money I will fuck you. Right. It's the same thing with like lions. They looking at you like, if the opportunity arises, I will kill you.

Speaker 1:          00:23:43       You know, dogs don't look at you like that. Fucking lions look at, you know, cats attempted house cats, you know, you turn around and he'd catch up stock and you and shit, but then you look at them and then they fucking run away. All right, picture a cat doing that. A house cat. But you turn around and it's aligned and it doesn't run away if fucking lunges at you or maybe it gives you that refrigerator bitch slap, right? So this fucking thing is looking at her and he's the owner who has no training whatsoever. Brings his fucking thing. I'll do, my palms were like sweaty. I, I had to get, well when I was watching it in bed, I literally stood up going, what the fuck are you doing? So the thing comes over, immediately starts crawling on top of her, it's on top of her.

Speaker 1:          00:24:26       And then she puts her hands on the side of the thing. It starts like, like, you know, rubbing it like it's a giant dog. And all I remember was that there's a youtube video of that stunt man and worked with bears and he had brought us some sort of relative in there who wanted to learn how to work with bears. And he told him to keep his hands down by his side and the bear came up and like stood up on its back legs, put its paws on the dude shoulder. And he instinctively put his hands on either side of the bear, which the bear took as like an aggressive move and one of the fight and it fucking killed this guy. So she puts her hands down and I see that and go, oh fuck is this thing like a bear? I don't fucking know.

Speaker 1:          00:25:05       And all of a sudden, um, she got just a little bit scared and then the thing like collapsed down on her and it got weird really quick. And then the guy stood up with this rope fucking leash and like quickly tries to pull the lion away, what she does and this woman gets up like, Oh wow, that was Helen's. I guess I feel like that was like a spiritual experience of Albert's like Bitchy, woman's got fucking killed and then the guy goes, yeah, you got scared and it senses your fear and then Oh God, thank God she didn't make any high pitched noise like the sound of an animal like suffering. You know what I mean? You have any other that like a dog toy, you know when they bite on it and it makes that high pitched noise, it excites the Predator. And um, so I say to Nia, I go, how far into this show before they show us somebody who got killed?

Speaker 1:          00:25:57       I go, I say about 17 minutes. They did. And it was at the end of the show and they were just like two weeks after we left. Um, this fucking woman, basically the housekeeper comes in. All right. She didn't fucking do anything. She's not like these fucking guys who for some reason, like it's, it's just total like male ego shit trying to outdo the other fucking rich guy down the street that they get these things. They don't know anything about the animals. They fucking, at least that's the way it was presented. They didn't know shit about the fucking animals. And then they were like, no, the thing has a better life live in here. It's walking around in a fucking cage. You know, it was like, do what you want to walk around in a cage. I mean, you could always get knifed, you could get killed the way an animal couldn't in the wild.

Speaker 2:          00:26:46       Okay,

Speaker 1:          00:26:46       so fucking lion who's killing a lion other than another human being. Um, so anyways, uh, this fucking housekeeper came in and uh, she got mauled by these fucking lines and they bring the woman in and the guy tried to see a dog did it. And they were like, ah, these injuries are a little more than a dog. And then the owner is like, well, whatever, do you mean? It's like, well, she's missing her left arm and the claw marks on this. And He, so, you know what the fucking asshole did? He had three lions. He went home, he shot all of them, and then burn their bodies out in the desert. So we, you know, so nothing would fucking happen to them. And, uh, it was just like, again, it's like, yeah, there you go. They go fucking inevitable. They had like Cheetos, this guy's riding in a fucking six wheeled Mercedes with a fucking Cheetah.

Speaker 2:          00:27:41       Okay.

Speaker 4:          00:27:42       And that woman's getting in the car guy. Oh, it's, it's, it's acting just like a dog. It's panning. It's looking out the window.

Speaker 4:          00:27:53       Maybe they had to get somebody, I'm not saying she was not a smart person, she just wasn't very aware of the situation, I feel. And I just kept hearing like, there was, back in the day, like 50 def jam comics did bits about how white people fuck with wild animals. And so in a way I'm like, oh, this is good for once. It's not white people being idiots with wild animals, you know, now it's Arabs. Let's, let's, uh, you know, take a little heat off a Whitey and then they bring this white lady in there and she fucking does everything that, you know, every one of those bits says that we do.

Speaker 2:          00:28:24       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:28:25       So anyways, let's get to some of the, some of the reeds here for the week. If I can, if my fucking

Speaker 2:          00:28:32       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:28:32       Computer isn't going to tell me to fucking, I dunno. Updates something. Um,

Speaker 4:          00:28:37       oh Jesus. Here we go. There we go. Oh wait, I have to promote it.

Speaker 1:          00:28:41       This thing real quick. All right. I was supposed to promote this regular hero, um,

Speaker 4:          00:28:48       year in review. You can donate now and be irregular hero to change a life today. These people work around the world to help the disadvantaged. They uh, they are a non another yet another nonprofit. And I'm assuming that because it's on my podcast that this is a,

Speaker 1:          00:29:06       this is actually a legit one. You know,

Speaker 4:          00:29:10       they help out with hurricane Matthew, skid row at risk youth. Uh Oh. Regularly Heroes Show [inaudible].

Speaker 2:          00:29:19       Okay.

Speaker 4:          00:29:20       Oh fuck. I've done one of these. Oh, this is what Steve Simone thing, right. The regular heroes show has been a great fun and an awareness raiser. Thanks to comedians. Bill Berg, Gabriel Iglesias, Dane Cook, Daniel Tosh, Chris Hardwick, Chris Delea, the world at the world famous comedy store in the Improv. Yeah. This is actually a legit one in a, in a world where so many of these nonprofits are, um, a complete horse shit. This is actually a legit one, which is a very nice thing. Um, because everything is a fucking nonprofit. Like you remember that, that that lady from a couple months back, she, uh, she lost a job at that nonprofit yet another nonprofit. Uh, when she said that horrible shit about Michelle Obama, you know, and of course wrote it like a dope. She said something like, uh, it will be so refreshing to have a classy, beautiful, dignified first lady in the White House. You mean that trophy wife?

Speaker 4:          00:30:23       Well, cause she wears a red blouse. All of a sudden she's fucking, uh, you know, a better person. She wrote, I'm tired of seeing ape in heels, not an a n a ape in heels. And ape is capitalized. Like it's a, I don't know somebody's name or some shit like that. And so of course she gets fucking, she gets bounced out of this nonprofit. She gets fired because everybody knows that makes you less racist. You're racist, and then you lose your job. And then you go, oh, wait a minute, what was I thinking? Everybody is equal. Um, so anyways, then the, uh, the fucking mayor from this town, Clay County is something Virginia, Virginia, West Virginia I guess backed up her Goddamn, uh, why you would do that. You know, even if you were races, you think you'd be smart enough, keep your fucking mouth shut. This person co-signed and what the other person said.

Speaker 4:          00:31:20       And then the mayor had to fucking resigned. So anyways, they actually, so they fired the first lady who said it from the Clay County Development Corporation. Nonprofit. They're a corporation that developed shit. And then, but it's not for profit. Well, let me ask you this. How is this woman not homeless? I don't get how you work for a nonprofit and you're not homeless. If there's no profit, how do they pay you? This is what all corporations do. I'm in business. I'm in business with a certain corporation that claims in 90 to $180 million loss a year. And the people I work with are buying mansions out here, redoing them.

Speaker 4:          00:32:05       I don't know how that works. That's actually a different thing because they're not considered a nonprofit. They're considered a business entity. And if he, if you don't show that you've earned any money, then you don't have to pay any taxes. Um, so the corporation doesn't, but then everybody draws a salary. Now you have to pay taxes on, um, on the salary that you drew. But however, if you just say, and you're not making a profit, you don't have to pay any taxes. And I would think that all that extra money that you didn't pay taxes on, you then just disperse amongst your employees, right? So rather than making a million a year, you make 2 million a year and then you pay taxes on that. Right. I don't know how it works. I don't, you know, I'm too stupid to figure out how that shit works. But, um, for the life of me, I looked up this nonprofit trying to figure out what the fuck they do.

Speaker 4:          00:32:54       I cannot, I can't figure it out. So anyways, they fired these fucking lady. And um, then like a month later, they just reinstated her. They just reinstated her. And, uh, I don't know. To me that is the Trump influence. I think that that's what everybody learned from Trump. It's just like you just say, Hey, you know, that's locker room talk or a, you know, alright, he's fired and he comes back. Hey, you know, I'm back. Yeah. You know, I lie, I left for six weeks and, uh, back. Uh, you know, and what I love with media is there's no follow up after the first story. The first story is done. There's the, there's the whole fucking everybody flipping out. Let's go burn the witch. And then once it dies down, then you just bring the person back and nobody, they've moved onto something else. Um, I don't know.

Speaker 4:          00:33:41       It's really bizarre. I just don't know how somebody could fucking be in business with somebody like that. It's fucking nuts. Anyways, all right, me undies, uh, oh Jesus. But Opal, me, undies, me undies rubbing up on your Cogley Doo Doo Doo. Me, Andy's me undies. It's like a sheepskin fucking saw. Ugh. It's so fucking soft up against your Tate. You know, you fucking love it. Um, your Dick, you will page with a pair of fucking me undies. Why would you paint your deck? I don't know. How many fucking times can I sing this picture. A world in a world where putting on a new pair of underwear isn't just fresh. You're stepping into a better day. You know, I bet. Where's me undies or lives in me undies? Lifestyle is Mariah Carey. I noticed the second time I brought her up, but that fucking channel, Nia keeps watching. I know one of these reality shows that's following Mariah Carey around. Dude, she's fucking hilarious. Every fucking shot. She's like laying in a bed in an evening gown with heels on full makeup and everything with a glass of wine.

Speaker 4:          00:34:49       It's like in the 1950s what people thought rich people did all day. Just laying around with like, you know, some fucking $300,000 diamond necklace. It's like, we get it. You're a diva. Jesus Christ. She never wear sweatpants. You know, just to have a fucking white Zinfandel over there. Um, anyways, it says, think about it under, where's the first thing you put on in the last thing you take off unless you weird. You know what if you don't like your torso, what have you, one of those guys that fucks with his shirt on, you know, you sweaty tee shirt, right? You know what I mean? He's still a good tee shirt on. You know, ladies, if you're fucking a guy wears man ted. That's when you know he's really letting you win is when he takes the t shirt off to our Jesus. But why would you say that?

Speaker 4:          00:35:34       All right. Think about it and underwear. It's about why would you settle for anything less than the best feeling underwear on the planet. Be undies focuses solely on producing the most comfortable underwear you've ever experienced.

Twinkle lies. All right, let's see what this is.

Speaker 4:          00:42:56       Oh my God. All right. Let me hit pause here. This is basically, this is, I want to go to this. All right. There's this whole group of fucking dude's, they're all dressed in white. Oh my God. They're all huddled around a pole and there's a guy sitting on top of the fucking Paul and then another group of dudes come in wearing orange shirts and the fucking, they all have on like Olympic boxing headgear and then when, when the fucking orange Jude's coming in, they're trying to knock the guy off to Paul. This is like fucking ads fighting each other.

Speaker 3:          00:43:37       Yeah,

Speaker 4:          00:43:38       dude, you fucking asshole. How can you show me this and not tell me what sport this is? They tried to knock the guy off the fucking poll. What is this called? And what happens is, is basically everybody gets piled on. Once the orange crew comes in, oh, there's a weak guy. He turned and ran the other fucking way. They start jumping up on top of each other. Oh my God. That would be so fucking claustrophobic. It's basically like a rugby scrum. If you could throw fucking punches and you climb in, just imagine a rugby scrum and rather than the ball, one of the rugby dudes was sitting up on a pole and they're trying to fucking knock them off.

Speaker 3:          00:44:17       Wow, dude.

Speaker 4:          00:44:21       They're just kicking each other in the face. I swear to God, you know, how the fuck did I get so lucky to be born in this goddamn country? Where did they at least pretend to give a shit about wellbeing?

Speaker 1:          00:44:32       And your like, that is a fucking hardcore sport. You know what? Hat's off to fucking Asia right there. I would love to see them and try to get this. This is barbaric. You don't try to do it in our country. Like is everybody's listening from America. My country, I should say this is barbaric. This is, this is promoting violence against people at different kinds of shirts on. I mean, I don't even understand. What is it? What is, what is the purpose of this? Um, can you please tell me the name of that sport? Am I ever gonna get over this fucking cough and smoked a cigar and forever I'm getting eight hours sleep. Not really, you know, knee is tossing and turning and every fucking minute now. I literally, you know, I, I, I sleep in bed for like half the night and then after awhile I just ended up going upstairs and I fall asleep, you know? And I want to do the same thing. Like when the baby comes, I'm just going to be one of the baby cries too much. I'm just going to be like, you know what, I can't deal with either one of you and I'm going to go upstairs and I'm going to put on an evening God like Mariah Carey and inlay here with my fucking diamonds on.

Speaker 1:          00:45:39       I Dunno, maybe it's just for the show, but I just look at it as like, this person is out of there. If they just at some point it's just completely lost touch of reality. Um, there's something about that when you get like backup dancers and they're all hanging on your every word and they, and they literally want to be you. Like there's no way to keep, keep yourself tethered to any sort of fucking reality. Um, all right. Advice, age, different story. First of all, did I talk about everything I wanted to fucking talk about this week? I'm all, let's talk about how you guys doing with your Chi. If you late to the podcast, you can still start right now, man. I've been trying to do a half hour cardio every single day because as you know, between Thanksgiving and new year's, she eat all of this fucking shit. You put on weight and then you got to do, you just start the year behind the eight ball by the eight ball.

Speaker 1:          00:46:27       Right? I was like, I'm not fucking doing that. So as of December 1st I've been trying to do a cardio, a half hour cardio every single fucking day. And um, of course I fucked up, right? I, um, what did I do? I, I made it through the first 11 days and then December 12th I had a busy morning and you really got to knock it out in the morning, which I didn't. And uh, the day got longer and longer. And then I came home and he was watching some fucking TV and she was just like, I need comfort. And I was just like, all right, acting like I was a good husband rather than like, I don't want to get them that fucking elliptical again. So I missed a half hour. On the 12th, 13th I did my half hour. So I had 1,213 days, 14th I missed. Then I was like, fuck, this is becoming a trend now.

Speaker 1:          00:47:17       I owe that machine down there. 60 minutes plus the 30 for today. That was Friday, December 15th so I got on that elliptical bop, blah blah blah, Dodo, no baby baby red cakes. Um, I got on the thing and I did an hour and 11 minutes, 71 minutes out of the 90 minutes. I just looked at it like it was a basketball game or a sporting event that was down by 90 points. And so the next day I started my day, I was down 19 points plus the 30 I had to do and I ended up doing an hour on the elliptical. So now I was up 11 minutes and then I liked it. I liked the results of doing a fucking hour. So then, uh, on, say I did a an hour and four minutes. So then now I'm up. I was down 90 minutes now I was up, uh, an hour and 15, also known as 75 minutes.

Speaker 1:          00:48:14       And then yesterday I did an hour, 15 minutes. Uh, so I don't even know what I'm up at this point. 45 minutes plus the next to 45, I'm actually up 90 minutes, something like that. I don't know what the fuck it is. I can't really remember. But all I wanted to do, I was going to do a half hour every day and that was going to be a, so 31 days it'd be 15 and a half hours of cardio. But uh, now I think I'm just going to do hours every day for the rest of the fucking year. I weighed myself the other day. I was one 77. Now when I came back from fucking Europe, I was a buck 90. So I've taken 13 pounds off since, um, since that trip. So I dunno, it's all about the fucking cardio. Um, I would love to do that.

Speaker 1:          00:48:58       You know, if you know what the reality is, is if you've got an elliptical every day and did fucking 60 minutes, if you just did that, you know, and, and when you do that, when you put together a playlist, that's when you got to love. I tell you, you got to love like bands like iron maiden or they have six, seven minutes songs, you know, at least the songs, or at least four minutes, which is a huge fucking chunk. You don't want, I just put my sweatshirt over the clock and I'm just like, I just peek at the clock after every song's done. All right? So if you just do one a half hour of cardio, you got to listen to rhyme of the ancient mariner. It's a 13 minute song, you know?

Speaker 2:          00:49:34       Okay.

Speaker 5:          00:49:35       Hi Buddy. Hey chip. Married of the whole fucking thing. There you go. Jay showed

Speaker 1:          00:49:41       bye bye. [inaudible] he listened to the whole fucking thing. The courtesy they apart, right?

Speaker 2:          00:49:51       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:49:51       You're going to go from fucking 27 minutes down to 14 minutes. He likes is a fucking joke. I always tried to put it on, you know, have it come on time. It was like 21 minutes, you know, and then I just covered up because the next time I look, I'm going to be in single digits. I'll be done at like eight or nine minutes. It's fucking tremendous. But, um, anyways, I uh,

Speaker 2:          00:50:12       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:50:13       A buddy of mine, my drum teacher was showing me this fucking song this week and uh, I dunno how I slept in this one. I've always been a big Soundgarden fan is somehow I never heard that song rhino sore and a, as always, Matt came with the sickest fucking drums. Uh, I become obsessed with that song in that fucking album. And uh, when I saw it, I thought it said 2016 I was like, oh, they got back together. This is their latest shit. And then I looked again and sit in 1996 every fucking thing that I listened to. I don't know what happened. We, I think part of it cause I got old and then I was also like trying to fucking get somewhere as a comedian. I just completely missed out on like 20 years of music and like half the shit people show me.

Speaker 1:          00:50:57       I'm like, that's, that sounds fucking, you know, it always sounds like it's brand new to me when that come out. And they're like, yeah, like 2002. I was like, ah, I just, I just can't get contemporary. I got 20 years of Shit. I got a fucking sift through. Um, so if there's any other drummers out there, you know, part of my lessons is they'll play shit at the end, like ear training shit. Like you got to try to figure out the groove you got. Oh, you got to figure out what time signature was in. And this was to figure out what time signature was in. And of course I was fucking it up and a few drummers out there, it's in six, but if you count the eighth notes, you just count up to 12 in the phrasing is seven and five. Um, and I would play it for you on here, but I always just feel like, because I do advertising, if I play any music,

Speaker 6:          00:51:49       mmm.

Speaker 1:          00:51:52       Then all of a sudden is going to come after me be like, you owe us money cause you made money off of me on these while you played our fucking song or whatever. Um, anyways, what do you guys think of the Patriot yesterday? Everybody's flipping out about our defense. Like, I don't know what the big, you know, we beat the Ravens and the Ravens did this, they got that subs guy. But back in the, the edge sogs they had ray Lewis and they had ed reed. So they're big three is basically down to one dude and you know, they're not who the fuck they were. And then we beat the Broncos in mile high where we never fucking win. But they basically never going to get a rookie quarterback. I Dunno, I get so frustrated with the Patriots because it seems like they only protect their offensive players.

Speaker 1:          00:52:40       They'd been, I know I've been bitching about this, but they just, you know, they're fucking cornerback. Whatever the fuck his name is, Taylor Lib, whatever the fuck his name is. Like he, when he was with us, that that whole side of his whole squadron sexual, the field was just shut down. What didn't we like about that? Why don't we just keep that guy, you know, we always, we got fucking wide receivers. We got fucking a quarterback. That's where we keep all our fucking man. You know what? This is my theory. Bill Bellacheck is such a defensive genius. I think he just thinks like, you know what? I don't fucking need a, you know, I don't, I don't look at this. My fucking computer just decided, you know, I said, hey, do you know, contact me in an hour. And I was like, all right. And I was going by and I was just thinking with my fucking phone, like, who's doing this? So weird. It's like all these fucking satellites just fucking pointed at you. I don't know. Anyways, um, I think he just,

Speaker 2:          00:53:38       yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:53:39       Is convinced that he can take any second round draft pick, train this person into being a n NFL quality player at that position slash borderline all pearl if you, and if you become an all pro, Danny just fucking gets ready at the second you want money just fucking been doing it forever. But back in the day, you know, we keep McGuinness, we kept rebel. So our defense, I felt like had an identity. Now it's like every three years it's like a whole new fucking defense. It drives me up the fucking wall.

Speaker 2:          00:54:12       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:54:13       I Dunno, we'll see. Cause I watched the giants, you know and you know like all patriots fans, every year when the giants go on their run, you get this sickening feeling in your stomach going like, oh fuck yeah, you want to play him again? Cause we got to beat him one time. You know when I was sitting there going like, all right, well they lost Tom Kaufland. This is going to be huge. And Lo and behold, they're doing it again. They're on another fucking run. All right, big. Yeah, the defense looks fucking amazing. You know, I'm not saying a defense doesn't look good, but it does not look as good as theirs. And um, I dunno, that's the giants thing. Like the only thing about the giants as they don't score any fucking points for whatever fucking reason they got eli who's a goddamn beast. They got the fucking, uh, they got the diva there. What's his name? Uh, I don't, my short term memory's for shit.

Speaker 2:          00:55:02       Yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:55:03       I just thought Wyatt, I can't fucking remember his last name is same name as the fucking soccer play with all the tattoos. Who's married to the spice girl.

Speaker 2:          00:55:14       Okay,

Speaker 1:          00:55:14       back up. Bend it like Beckham, Odell Beckham. There you go. See that? I'm learning on my fucking old brainworks now I've got to go on one of those brain exercise websites to try to help you with your short term memory. Um, I dunno, I'm fascinated how they can have him at wide receiver. You know, I don't know if they play in that Cruz guy a bunch of fucking money, but they got eli, they're able to keep him. But then on the other side of the ball they got JPP. And if he didn't fucking mess up his hand like they, they seem to be, they're more balanced.

Speaker 2:          00:55:43       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:55:45       You know, so one of Chandler Jones wanted money. Fucking earned it.

Speaker 1:          00:55:51       Sometimes I just feel like we're getting, I don't know what the fuck she built, how many super bowls to they have to win before you realize bill Belichick's knows what he's doing. I know, I know. I'm just looking at the NFC west and it just seems like this stronger, I'll tell you right now, the Dallas Cowboy, you buy it, sell it. I'm selling. I don't believe in him. I don't believe in the Dallas cowboys. I don't believe in that coach. I don't know about, you know, this is just totally based on, I look at that guy and I go, I don't, I don't believe in that guy. I just don't. Uh, Pete Carroll is a fucking based, Eli is an animal and their coach, who

Speaker 4:          00:56:24       I swear to God looks like he wants some radio contest is uh, is a, is a wolf in sheep's clothing, is a wolf and upper deck fucking eating a pretzel and get mustard all over his face. Clothing. Um, I think one of those teams, and this is really isn't going out on a limb, I think one of those two teams goes to the, uh, to the Superbowl and having watched both teams, I think I would rather play, um, I rather play Seattle. And that's only because Seattle, you know, once you went, a couple of you went to, when a soup bowl you go to back to back, you know, they lost too many guys. Um,

Speaker 4:          00:57:03       not to say that they could beat the patriots every fucking beat us this year. But, uh, we'll see bossy. I never fucking believe in my team. You know what I mean? I don't know why. I always just see the fucking, you know, why are we doing this? Why are we doing that? Um, so anyways, we shall see. But uh, be nice to play the giants again and finally fucking win. We'd actually, we would have to win that game or else Tom Brady would forever just get ripped on sports, talk radio, buy all his mouth breathing dopes. They will be like, yeah,

Speaker 7:          00:57:32       don't, don't do it.

Speaker 4:          00:57:41       Like it was just one on one game. Like Tom Brady. Every Superbowl has not let his team down the field for the winning score. He's had to do that. Every Superbowl that he's been in, you know, and four out of six times the defense went out and did their job and two times they did not. Um, and I'm not taking it away from fucking Eli because two times Eli beat our defense, but he beat our defense. He did not be Tom Brady. However, when you're the quarterback, you take all the brain blame, you know, all you gotta do is look at Dan Marino and the ridiculous level of Shit that that guy takes to spite the fact, all the records that, that guy, I've never understood it. It's just, uh, did he have to tackle people too? Was he supposed to run the ball up the gut to fucking eat up some of the clock?

Speaker 6:          00:58:33       MMM.

Speaker 4:          00:58:37       I Dunno. Right? It's just so fucking the shit that Dan Marino gets us the dumbest. It's the dumbest ever. This is how much the game has changed, by the way. Uh, I looked this up the other day just because all they do is fucking throw the ball and I looked up all time, you know, running backs, just rushing all the time for your career. And I'll tell you right now, what's his face? Emmitt Smith. No one's going to break that fucking record the way, the way, they just don't run the fucking ball anymore. No one's going to get anywhere near that thing. Uh, let me look this shit up. Like I looked it up yesterday

Speaker 6:          00:59:13       and um,

Speaker 4:          00:59:16       not now. I don't know. Install these fucking things. Fuck off Jesus. It's like a

Speaker 1:          00:59:22       fucking kid tugging at you, Manny. Manny, Manny, um, where we go all time NFL rushers. Um, all right. Where the fuck is it? Pro Football reference. This is the best thing ever. So I look this shit up. Okay. And in the top 20,

Speaker 1:          00:59:44       top 20, all like, as of right now, there's only three active players in the top 20. The first seven are all retired. Okay. The, the, the, the highest ranking one is Frank Gore who has 12,000, 931 yards. All right. Then you got to go all the way down to 16. You got Adrian Peterson who granted took a year off because he beat his kids up with, with something he found in the woods. Uh, Adrian Peterson, and then he got Steven Jackson at 18. All right, you go to the all time. Uh, where the fuck is it passing? When the hell is it passing yards? How hard is it to find that passing yards? All right, so there's only, there's only, there's only a three active players. Top 20 rushing, right? Starts at eight and ends at 18. All right. Passing all time. There is in the top 14, there's six active players, six active players in the top 14 all time. There's only eight of the qbs in the history of the NFL that is thrown as many or more yards than six current fucking players. And the top two all time. Our Peyton manning and Brett Farve, Peyton manning just retired last year. Brett Farve retired six years ago.

Speaker 1:          01:01:07       It's fucking unbelievable. Like how much this game has changed. And there's only two really old school names, uh, in the top 20. Is Johnny Unitas. Where's the other one? And Fran Tarkington and uh, once, what's his face like a John Elway Warren Moon. That class? Uh, Dan Fouts, Joe Montana. They came in, they did their damage.

Speaker 2:          01:01:37       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:01:37       Do Kerry Collins is in the fucking, he's 16th all time. So he goes, so you got Peyton Manning's one. Brett Farve is to drew. Brees is three was 65,462 yards. He's an, he's less than 7,000 yards less. Uh, what? Six, 6,500 yards away from owning the record. Dan Marino's fourth. Then it's Tom Brady. John Elway, Warren Moon than Eli Manning is eight. Then Fran Tarkenton, then Ben Roethlisberger, Vinny Testaverde, Philip Rivers, drew Bledsoe, Carson Palmer, Dan Fouts. I've seen like everybody, all of these people play in my lifetime. I catch the end of friend targeting Dan Fouts, Kerry Collins, Joe Montana, Johnny United Stated and see Dave Craig, boomer, Esiason, Donovan McNabb. All right. Done. We've Navis is 21st all time. Um, that's how much the fucking game has changed. It's, it's unbelievable.

Speaker 4:          01:02:40       What it is, is that these guys are like throwing for four yards, five, six yards. It's shit he used to give to the running back. So I think Emmitt Smith, Walter Payton, those guys, no one's going to touch their phone. I don't know. I don't know how you'd get enough fucking attempts to even do it.

Speaker 1:          01:02:54       Um, was there a point to that bill? I'm, yeah, let's say they throw the ball a lot. I guess that's what I'm saying. Jimmer say completely changed. And then not nothing too is just the way that they protect the fucking quarterback. You know, when they call it the Tom Brady rule, because that time he turned around and looked at the referee, said, Hey, somebody touched my jersey. And then referee was like, oh, I'm sorry. He fucking threw the flag. Yeah. Everybody calls it the Tom Brady rule, which I love. I love that they call it the Tom Brady rule. Cause it is, you know, you gotta protect your quarterback, sets your money. Everybody realizes that, uh, you know, when, when the best, you know, everybody knows the fucking quarterback. That guy gets knocked out. No one's going to watch the game. So they protect the hell out of them and they're like, yeah, fuck everybody else.

Speaker 1:          01:03:36       And uh, people who not into sports, they're into offense. They want to see some action. So they just, they, you know, now it's like a legal to cover, cover a fucking receiver to Dan Marino did the shit you could do during that guy's fucking career and he's still through for like 60,000 fucking yards. I Dunno if he's talking about steroids. Right. And then they put an asterisk next to your name. You know, they don't, you don't have those same way they don't give Barry bonds is just do, it's just like, Hey, are you going to sit there and tell me, you know, all of these fucking guys were as good as Dan Marino with the yard. So putting up the fuck out of here. All right. Um, in Feis age difference and history a dear bill,

Speaker 4:          01:04:16       I'm just a bill. Yes. I'm only a bill. Um, I'm a big fan of yours. I really enjoy your podcast, your, thank you very much. I appreciate it. I am 28 years old and in a relationship with my girlfriend who's seven years younger than me and who I plan on marrying were really great together. I love her. Well congratulations. The thing is is as our relationship has gone on, we've slashed, I've been getting some static from people about our relationship.

Speaker 1:          01:04:42       Well who gives a fuck what they think?

Speaker 4:          01:04:44       Like I said, she's seven years younger than me, but we've known each other for a while. We've met when I was working at my first job as a counselor at a camp when she was one of the kids. Oh Jesus. When we first met I was 17 and she was 10. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:04:58       Uh Yeah Yap, Yap man. There that, that's that creepy thing. That's that creepy hippie

Speaker 4:          01:05:07       thing. Cause at some point you were like, oh look at that little kid. That's the woody Allen moment where you go, oh, isn't she adorable? And then at some point the switch flips to be in like, Hey, I think I want to fuck that. You know, there's, there's no way to get around that sir. He'd have to understand that. So anyways, he says nothing happened between us at that point. Well, I would hope so. It wasn't until we reconnected years later when we were older that we started talking again and really getting to know each other. All right, well I guess that's fair, but people are going to say some shit. Right? Anyway, I'm getting shit from some family and friends because of our history. Just from an outside source. I'd like to know what you think. Do you think it's strange or weird? I know there's people out there 15 to 20 years apart. It's just with our history, it throws people off again. What do you think from an unbiased perspective perspective? Thanks and go fuck yourself. Yeah. The thing is is that you were 17 and she was 10 when you first met her. Um, that's what makes it weird.

Speaker 6:          01:06:04       MMM.

Speaker 4:          01:06:06       Like my wife is 10 years younger than me, but I didn't meet her until I was like, you know, 35 and she was 25.

Speaker 6:          01:06:14       MMM.

Speaker 4:          01:06:15       Hey Nia, come in. Here is a question. Somebody, uh, somebody is a 28, what did he say? That Wendy Hoodie. So out of breath for

Speaker 1:          01:06:27       come here. Yeah. You need a place to sit here. Yeah. Jesus. Yeah.

Speaker 4:          01:06:31       So this guy, he's dating this woman, right? He wants to marry. He's 28 she's 21 he said, the thing is, I met her when I was a counselor. I was 17 she was only 10 he goes, obviously right,

Speaker 1:          01:06:40       nothing happened. Then

Speaker 4:          01:06:42       he goes, obviously nothing happened then, but now that we're together, people are given a shit. And I was saying how there was a 10 year difference between us, but I, you know, I was 35 yeah,

Speaker 1:          01:06:52       25 right. So, so they're looking at you like, uh, you've been grooming her since she was like seven years old. Yeah. But he like met her but then didn't seem like he didn't see her for a while. Then they reconnected and had all the chorus, which happens. Don't worry about it if you know everything's on the up and up. Just just do your thing. Yeah. Is there a family cool with it, you know, is her family given him the side eye? Like he was grooming her or seems to just be friends. What do you mean? His friends? People that he knows it just like, this is what I would do. I would just, whatever those Pete runs are giving him shit about it. I wouldn't, if you meet new people, I wouldn't tell them that that's how you first met him. Probably not. And not everybody needs to know your entire history and that way just because people will misinterpret it. But yeah. Have you guys are fine. Your family's are fine. Like don't worry about it. Yeah. As long as nothing happen when you were a counselor. Exactly. As long as you're sure nothing happened when you were a council there, which I'm sure they didn't, he always wants to push her on this. Swink oh God. I know. It's bad.

Speaker 4:          01:08:00       All right. I want to see, I did it to you. Sorry. You're gonna you're gonna have to, you know, this is certain level of shit you're going to have to deal with. Um, where are you going?

Speaker 1:          01:08:07       I'm going. I'm going out to have a little, a little breakfast with a friend.

Speaker 4:          01:08:13       I didn't like the vagueness of that. Having a little with a friend.

Speaker 1:          01:08:17       I'm going to get smoothies with Chelsea Peretti. Oh, he didn't have to say that. Smoothies. Chelsea Peretti Sacramento zone. Chelsea Peretti. Yeah, she's from Sacramento. No, Hella Sacramento. Um, she's white trash from, uh, yes she is. She's white trash from northern California and she is, she's also a Republican. Um, anyway. All right. Where the fuck am I? Um, yeah, I do it just, you know who gives a fuck?

Speaker 4:          01:08:59       This is the deal. Once you get married, you have fucking kids and shit. You're never going to see anybody anyway. So who gives a fuck? Who gives a fuck what people think? Go out and do what makes you happy. Okay. As long as you're not hurting anybody and you're not breaking a law, please go out and do it before. Just being happy becomes illegal because, uh, you know, just the level that the population is going in, you know, I'm thinking by the end of my life, I don't know what it's going to be like over here. I hope we don't end up like China. With China. It's so fucking overpopulated. They've got to like people, nobody drive cars for like five fucking days. And just the shit that they're dealing with is a, it's brutal over there.

Speaker 1:          01:09:39       What are you doing? Yeah, take the priests, take the priests. I still have the Prius. Everybody. I'm going to be selling the car. I just can't find the title. So I sent, I sent in all the forms to the DMV. Bye. Enjoy your smoothies. You big Hollywood phony. Alright. Um, so I sent it in

Speaker 4:          01:10:01       to the local one and I fucked up. Not only did I send it to the wrong DMV, I wrote for some reason 2017 on the check.

Speaker 1:          01:10:08       So they thought I was trying to be pull a fast one. So then, uh, I ended up having to send it up to fucking Sacramento, some waiting for that thing so I can finally get rid of that other, the fucking car. Um, all right, here we go. Girlfriend texts.

Speaker 4:          01:10:22       Hey Bill, I'm in in a bit of a tough situation. I think you are. You wrote in twice and we'd love to hear your take it on it. Uh, I'm 24 years old and was recently seeing a 33 year old girl. Whoa. I love it.

Speaker 1:          01:10:38       Okay.

Speaker 4:          01:10:38       Bought out. Who Do, do, do calm and rubbed my fucking balls. You are fucking nine years older. Um, for about six months. Uh, within the time span I cheated on her twice. I told her about it and although she was upset, we agreed to get back together and start over a new, uh, everything was relatively fine until last week. I went to her house before she got off of work to do some work on our computer. When I noticed her text messages opened. Oh, mac computers are usually linked to a person's phone. So I was able to see all of her texts. I'm sure you know by now where this is going. Oh, Jay. Jay's, um, since she has gone through my texts before, I figured I would take the same evasive liberty. Well, you've fucked around on a twice. I would think that she would be doing that. Uh, I found a particularly strange thread from someone named Lauren who am I found out was actually her ex boyfriend and she had it in her phone in a woman's name. Oh God. They were sexting back and forth, talking dirty and exchanging pictures. I also found out she was sending him videos of us having sex. What the fuck?

Speaker 4:          01:11:55       What the fuck? Whoa, dude. That's, I don't think that's legal.

Speaker 3:          01:12:03       Okay.

Speaker 4:          01:12:04       Is that legal weight? Did you consider, oh wait, how does that work? If you could essentially let somebody, if you didn't know you were being filmed. I don't think that that's legal. This is what I do know. I'm not a lawyer and I have no idea what the lies. All right, let's continue. I confronted her on it and at first she minimize the entire situation saying it wasn't really that big of a deal.

Speaker 4:          01:12:28       Since then, we've been going back and forth arguing, you know what, you guys are both like not ready to be in relationships remotely and thank God you both found this out before you got married and had kids. She sends apologize, but I'm not really sure what to do. I did cheat on her. So does that even the playing field or is the whole thing just rooted in disfunction and chaos? There you go. Walk towards the light. I can't tell if I'm just lonely and want her in my life again, or if I should just walk away. Please help me here. I am emotionally involved in this situation, so it's hard to make a clear objective call to just walk away, walk away, and you need to do some work on yourself because, uh, I think you're a fucked up dude. Um, and I'm, I'm saying this with empathy.

Speaker 4:          01:13:18       Uh, you're a fucked up dude was actually relationship guy and probably would have just gotten married and fucking had your own little fucking fruit stand or whatever. But something fucked up happening. He was a kid. You got weird boundaries. So you get into relationships with dysfunctional fucking people and then you could consider continue to fuck around on the side and all that. The, it's, um, it's actually a very common thing. So I would say, uh, what you need is you need to be single and, uh, you need to do some work on yourself. I'd may would go to therapy, figure out what your deal is, really figure out what the fuck it is that you want in life and what it is that you're looking for. And then just take a baby step everyday walking towards it. That's what I would do, but I would get out of this relationship.

Speaker 4:          01:14:04       Um, and I would give her the same advice to, um, [inaudible]. There you go. Yeah. Get out of it. And uh, and just know that you're going to be fucking lonely. But it, all it takes is like, do you know, two to three months you'll be fine. You know what I mean? Just make yourself go to the gym. What you gotta do is you, you're breaking a routine and you fucking use to this person being in your life. But like the further you go without seeing that person, the more objective you can be. And you can look back and then one day you're just going to be like, what the fuck was I thinking?

Speaker 3:          01:14:35       MMM.

Speaker 4:          01:14:37       And it can actually be funny to you or you can really just see like, like uh, like what the fuck is wrong with me? That I would do that to a person and what is wrong with me that someone would do that to me and I would consider staying. Uh, you need some self esteem. Their buddy. Um, all right, girl with pet rat.

Speaker 3:          01:14:56       Okay.

Speaker 4:          01:14:56       Oh Jesus Christ. Dear Billy Christmas toes. I don't know what that means. I've been listening to the podcast for a long time. I recently came into a situation that resulted in me having to make a decision instead of writing into you and asking what to do in this situation. I decided to do what I thought you would want me to do and write in what the results. Dude, don't base your life on what the fuck you think I would want to do. But this is already interesting. Last month a girl I'd been dating got a pet rat boy got a pet fucking rat. Okay.

Speaker 3:          01:15:35       Okay.

Speaker 4:          01:15:35       Is it Angelina Jolie, then she have a rat or no shits. Billy Bob's blood around her neck. We had been dating for about four months and it was going well. I would say that if we were together about six months, I would have moved in with her. We really clicked well. She got a pet rat and I wasn't down with that. Not because I had a problem with a rat in a cage, but her taking the rat out of the cage and holding it while we watched a movie.

Speaker 3:          01:16:03       Okay.

Speaker 4:          01:16:04       Bill, I can barely even stand a cat on a lap because I don't trust them. So I voiced my concern and she laughed them off and ended up being a bigger argument and eventually came back around to the rat. I told her it was me or the rat. She said she'd rather me, Oh, you missed a word here. She'd rather have me, I guess, except there was a long pause and some serious thought. I really liked this girl. And honestly, if my devotion ever came down to choosing between her in anything short of family or friends, uh, would she, are any girl ever except that.

Speaker 3:          01:16:40       Okay.

Speaker 4:          01:16:40       Dude, you're so emotional. You skipping words here. Probably not, they'd say bail on the guy who's not sure if he choose you or something that potentially spreads diseases. Anyways, that's what happened. Merry Christmas to the burrs. Um,

Speaker 3:          01:16:56       okay.

Speaker 4:          01:16:56       Yeah, but what's you're doing is she loves that rat and you're making her get rid of something that she loves. So there's going to be, I guess a pause.

Speaker 3:          01:17:07       MMM.

Speaker 1:          01:17:10       I Dunno. I think that it was really bugging you. I think it was really fucking bothering you and you let it simmer and then you just fucking hit her with, you know, you were ready to talk about this for days, weeks, I don't know how long. And then you just fucking caught her off guard and she's been bonding with this thing and you made her make a Sophie's choice between you or the rat, which, um, I gotta tell you, I don't know about that move.

Speaker 1:          01:17:46       I Dunno about that move. You could have easily just said, listen, I respect the fact that you like a rat. Okay. For, you know what the first thing I would do is I would look up life expectancy of a rat. All right? And I don't mean someone that snitches, cause I think everybody even I know at this age is white as I am, that snitches get stitches. Snapchat. Um, all right. Life expectancy. What do you guys think of? What's the over under here? How long can a fucking Ratliff, I'm gonna say they live six to eight years, you know, if those are the prices, right. And I was the last person to fucking, I would say six. I'm gonna say eight, eight years. Life expectancy of a rat. Uh, two years do it only lives for fucking two years. All right? This is what you say to her.

Speaker 1:          01:18:42       If she hasn't gotten rid of the rat, come back and say, listen, I know he loved that. Fucking wrote it. Um, here's the deal. The things only lived two years. All right. I plan on being with you in two years. Can you do me a favor? Make this be the only rat he ever have. All right. Okay. She agrees to that thing and then just put parameters. When I come over and we're watching sleepless in Seattle, I don't want to have a threesome, if you know what I mean. Just keep it in the fucking cage when I'm not here. You want to roll around the floor, get yellow fever, whatever the fuck you want to do. Whatever the fuck rats do. If you want to do that, that's fine. I just, you know, I don't want to fucking deal with the thing. You could've done that, but you know, you kind of made her a like what she going to do with the rat now? Like how do you get rid of a rat? Is there like a fucking adoption agency? They didn't make me feel bad about my dog again, which is of course been brutal. Or am I going to talk about it? All right. Um,

Speaker 3:          01:19:41       yeah,

Speaker 1:          01:19:42       yeah. You just let the fucking thing go. Do you know those lines? Do you know when the twins, those people have those fucking lions and tigers and cheetahs, fern long enough time. They can't release them back into the wild because they don't even know how to fucking hunt anymore. You know what I mean? That really blew my mind. They don't have to hunt anymore, but they can murder a fucking housekeeper. I mean, he's just had a fuck. Do you have that in the house? There's no fucking, this
