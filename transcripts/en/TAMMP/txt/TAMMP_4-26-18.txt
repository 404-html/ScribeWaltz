Speaker 2:          00:00:21       Far called mad has said,

Speaker 1:          00:00:25       Ooh

Speaker 2:          00:00:26       cares if your nose is fucking Ryan. Get some fucking clean x and have some fun and sorry. I am so sick of being sick. Just when the fuck is this going to end. I woke up Bodu Luda I had a fucking coffin fit at like four in the morning and uh, you know, I was upstairs up and vanished upstairs. You know what I mean? Like back in the day when people had like tuberculosis after the slum Lord stuck them in some damp, dark fucking apartment for years and years and years. And these poor fucking tenants would die a lonely death and then they'd build a statute statute to the fucking slum lord or name a subway stop after him. You know, what was that one on? Off The six, the fuck, I can't remember the name of the Stop I used to get off at all the time. And walk over to the fucking store. I remember everything I saw in New York. I just, anybody at his statue, I just started looking them up on the Internet. But it was all this shit that they did. But if you went to about page three f four, it was the other stuff that they did.

Speaker 1:          00:01:44       Oh yeah. Um,

Speaker 2:          00:01:48       people, if I live long enough, I'm going to do a show this weekend at the Fox theater in Atlanta, Georgia. And then you know what I'm going to do then following day, you know what I mean? Go on to do what? I'm getting in a fucking rental car and I'm driving over the fucking Talladega and I'm going to go watch a bunch of fucking rednecks watching their dream cars going around the track. One more time.

Speaker 1:          00:02:13       Okay,

Speaker 2:          00:02:13       one more fucking top. Hey, stock car racing going to change. Now that Ford is fucking phasing out all of their sedans. Did you guys see that? They're not making any cars anymore. They're going to still have the Mustang, you know, cause what would a fucking tourists rent when they come to la? You got to get the Red Mustang convertible and put the fucking top down and drive around like a Dosha, right? Oh, do you know you want to hear, you want to hear some self-involved Shit. They're always talking about the millennials. You know what I mean? You ask a millennial, what's the top fucking social issue out there today? And they'd say, lack of cell service, you know, in a tunnel. No, actually they said climate change and they're determined to tackle the issue. That's what I just read today. Millennials think that climate change is the number one social issue courses. And they are 100% right. God bless them and they're determined to tackle it. You know, wait till they get a little bit of debt under their belts. Wait to those banker cuts can scare them out of their fucking, you know, get a run on the wheel.

Speaker 2:          00:03:16       You know, wait til they get married. Yeah. I went to that APP. And so you start getting fucking Nag, then your priority becomes pay enough my fucking house and fucking redoing the garage. So I got a place for myself. But until then, until that right, you saved the polar bear. So I hope you do it. I hope you stick to hope. You keep it real man. Like whenever you see an old hippie still rocking the long fucking, you know, hair, even if he went bald, still has it all gathered in the back, you know? Um, anyways, what the fuck was I going? I was, God dammit. Bill Kia Tangent. So something I was going to talk about there. What I brown was talking about cold medicine being sick.

Speaker 4:          00:04:02       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:04:02       Led me to the cars. Tattle dagger. Ah, fuck. If I know, I don't fucking know. All I know is that I've been sick too fucking long and I've had this fucking thing started Wednesday of last week. These are these new super colts because everybody takes antibiotics and everything, right? And rather than killing the virus, all you do is slap it around a little pit and it toughens up. You know what I mean? It's like, oh, that, you know, it starts to know your tendencies. He leads with the left. Fucking Jeb always follows it with an overhand right. He doesn't like when you crowd them in the ring. Oh Shit. Somebody is calling me. Oh, it's my mother, a mom. I've told my podcasts, let me call you right back. Yeah. Uh, anyways. Um,

Speaker 5:          00:04:55       fuck. I don't even want I'm talking about anymore. Oh yes or no. And so I woke up at like four in the morning, just fucking hacking or hacking away. And um, you know, upstairs in the guest room, that's where I've been, you know, sent my wife has also sick, you know, but she gets to stay in the big bet. Do you see how that works? You know, with the Nice fucking master bathroom right next door, she has a fucking humidifier going. She's got her fucking clean x with the, uh, you know, you won't get as sore noise. Knows fucking missed autumn. I'm up in the fucking guest room, you know, throw my drawer, my old drum DVDs and shit, blowing my nose with towels, toilet paper. That's how it works, you know, and you, what do you see? All you see is women just constantly complaining about the way the way men treat women and their position in society. Right. So this is a society, right? What about me? What about my existence? You know,

Speaker 2:          00:06:01       where's my ribbon? Where's my Hashtag?

Speaker 1:          00:06:04       Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:06:04       How come I can't get somebody fired?

Speaker 1:          00:06:07       You know,

Speaker 2:          00:06:09       I'd actually been winning arguments lately with my wife. It's been good. You know, it's cost her to kind of like, you know, do a couple things around the house that I've been asking her to do it, but I know it's going to go back the other way. The same way. Like she goes, so you got to watch your temper and then for a few days I'd walk around smiling like a lunatic before I go back to who I am. But you know, I accept it for her. She is all right. That's what you have to do after awhile. Yeah. Are you ladies out there you think you gonna Change your man? You're not, you're not going to change them. The best you can hope to do is break his spirit. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:06:41       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:06:42       In fact, if that's what gets you off. What about all of that shit? Yeah. How about a ribbon for all the broken men out there?

Speaker 2:          00:06:53       I don't know why I'm talking about all of this shit. It's just fucking, it always makes me laugh. Um, anyways, how bout those bro is here we go bro and say we'd, we go bump. Bump. Wow. Did I think we were going to lose that game seven now when we started our fourth fucking line and immediately gave up a goddamn goal, I was like, wow, that reminds me of certain, somebody not starting to game crying before the Superbowl. The fuck are we doing right? Then we tie it up, then we go ahead. All right. It was two to one and we scored my right before the first fucking period ended or something that was like, oh boy, it's three to to look at that. That's what I was, it was one, nothing them then one, one us and then they immediately fucking scored like they always did and then we fucking, and we went up three to two and I'm like, okay, maybe, maybe you know, whatever. And then they score of two fucking goals throughout five to three. This is one thing I've noticed about the Bruins. We don't hit anybody. Finally started hitting somebody in the third period. But Jesus Christ, when the other team is faster than yeah, you supposed to add them to try to slow him down, given away too much fucking space. I thought, you know, I thought Anderson looks shaky in the first period. So I was like, let's pepper him with some shots there in the second. And we barely got a shot on him. It felt so. I thought that allowed them to settle down what Jesus Christ was Iraq.

Speaker 1:          00:08:23       Yeah,

Speaker 2:          00:08:23       I'll tell you, you hate to see it. You hate to see it with a fellow fellow ginger. You know, fuck it as a game like that, you know, I guess toward Kruger was a little bit screened, but uh, he left. He let up a fucking softy. That next one was f goal number five was a softy. And also one of the first three wasn't a good one either.

Speaker 1:          00:08:43       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:08:44       Not to put it all on him. Uh, but anyways, my condolences to fucking Toronto may police saying, Jesus Christ, you know, and you got to it up to the ones that still have the heart to fucking go down the maple leaf square, whatever the fuck they call it, and stand there knowing that their joy is eventually going to turn to anger and then they're just going to be part of a fucking reaction video. A bad one.

Speaker 1:          00:09:12       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:09:13       But you have to go right as a leaf San, you gotta go, cause one of these times you're going to fucking win. I liked what that one guy in the leaf said. He said, obviously it sucks, but I think in the future we're going to be a team to be reckoned with. I always love that expression team to be reckoned with. They think they're going to be mmm. You know, full of freckles settles down a little bit. They get a little more playoff experience. I'll tell you what the Bruins need. They need a physical presence in front of the each day.

Speaker 2:          00:09:43       You know, we still haven't made up for fucking loot Cheech departure. There's no, we always had that runaway fucking train that were just flat and people actually, we used to have like three of them. We just don't have that anymore. Now we're fucking fast as shit. At least I thought we were until we played the maple leafs. Um, anyway, so now the Bruins move on. We got to Tampa Bay lightning, part of that hotbed of hockey fans down there. I went to a Tampa Bay lightning game down there, right. And went with four Shah. We were sitting there and there was, he's a Florida northern Florida redneck spinus some of my favorite rednecks. I like rednecks, you know, uh, there was not a fixed shit. I'll fix it. Ain't going to fit well, it'll hang off Nass. Um, we would sit sitting there and they had on the diamond vision, they put this little baby up there, right. You know, they had an infant up on the screen. The guy behind us goes, look, I had a little baby. I Dunno why. They just stuck with us a little rest of the road trip. You driving over to fucking Orlando dead silence in the car. And the forest just be like a little baby.

Speaker 2:          00:10:56       Uh, it was hilarious and also scary. Just listen to the guy cause he didn't sound real bright and just the fact that you know, his TJ's can also make babies. I just wished that like your level of intelligence made you, oh, so like, like your Iq should be the same level as your, a reproductive like a potency. Is that the right word? Like if you're a fucking moron, it should be a half court shot that you're going to get somebody knocked up. You know, that's not how it works. Dumb people usually have like that super just, you know, let me just stand next to somebody and they get fucking pregnant. Just shooting out fucking kids. Uh, that's cause they're too dumb to plan. You know, they just lay it on the back.

Speaker 6:          00:11:45       Well it feels good. It feels good. Feels good.

Speaker 2:          00:11:49       Well I was my belly sticking out. Why is my belly moving? Does anybody else feel weird? Are for that meal and then they just fucking shit the kid out on a sofa. I mean that happens. That still happens in America out there on the Appalachian trail. God knows Hollywood and go out there and put some cameras on it and turned it into a fucking reality show. And next thing you know, we're buying it and there's fucking little kid sewing together. Tee shirts with these fucking dope faces on it. All right? And that's what's wrong with this goddamn country.

Speaker 1:          00:12:23       MMM.

Speaker 2:          00:12:25       Jesus Christ. I love all these people taking the bait on that fucking Kanye West. Shit. He obviously, he has an album coming out. You're fucking morons. Relax.

Speaker 1:          00:12:34       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:12:34       Has he lost his mind? Did you learn anything with that beyond say album? Well, she was acting like she was all annoyed with JC and that there were all these problems at all. What the fuck? Everybody just starts gossiping and everybody buys the fucking album and they're still together. How many fucking times you're going to jump on the hook. He's obviously recording a fucking album. There's no more MTV. Billboards are a lot of fucking money. Why don't you just start saying some crazy shit that makes no fucking sense.

Speaker 1:          00:13:15       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:13:16       Yeah know. And then people will listen to your next album.

Speaker 1:          00:13:20       Okay,

Speaker 2:          00:13:21       I'm going to fucking do that. Get my podcasts numbers up. What the fuck can I, uh, I going to just start saying positive shit about women.

Speaker 1:          00:13:36       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:13:36       You know, I think the real problem beyond global warming, then that swirl of trash out in the Pacific Ocean, even worse than Isis.

Speaker 1:          00:13:48       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:13:49       Oh, I got a text message. Ah, I dropped the phone. Jesus Christ Tiki Barber. Pick it up though. For Christ's sake.

Speaker 1:          00:14:00       Uh,

Speaker 2:          00:14:03       shut this fucking thing off. I think the biggest problem beyond Isis and isis is a major problem. I mean, they're just like the Third Reich. The Third Reich had no planes or boats or really any technology, um, is white male heterosexuals and their micro aggression. Um, which is why I have decided I can't even do this because you guys are gonna fucking retweet this thing. And next thing you know, it'd be some fucking, I don't want to get involved in that. I was going to say that I, I've decided,

Speaker 1:          00:14:45       okay,

Speaker 2:          00:14:45       no, I can't say it because everyone's going to get all fucking upset.

Speaker 5:          00:14:50       It rhymes with man Zishan that would be the ultimate right, if you did that.

Speaker 1:          00:15:00       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:15:01       Be Funny if you, yeah, if he did that, like as this as a sign of solidarity with all the pain that women have been through that you actually, uh, went through with the sex change operation and then everybody called you a hero and then Diane Sawyer interviewed you and they made you a woman of the year. And then after all that cleared, all these women came forward and said you were grabbing ass and titties all through the 90s and two thousands, then you'd be like, well, I didn't do that. That was frank. I'm Francis and I just feel like for me, and then you're on the other side of the issue.

Speaker 1:          00:15:39       MMM.

Speaker 2:          00:15:41       And they'd be like, well, isn't frank still in there?

Speaker 2:          00:15:45       And you could be like, well, I left frank on that, that fucking operating table. I never was frank. Frank is my white slave name given to me by my white parents. Um, Jesus Christ. How much more time do I have in this fucking podcast? I usually like doing these sinks, man. But what am I fucking head is all clogged like this? You know, when I lay down in my slippers having to podcasts with a head cold, that's a day's work. People. Now I know you guys are out there doing construction. What the fuck do people do nowadays? Everybody air quote works from home now, which means they're out driving around on the highways during the day cause and fucking rush hour traffic. You know what I mean? Cause they saw something on Pinterest that they have to go pick up to add to their fucking wardrobe for their party that night. Right? Uh, we should go back to making our own clothes.

Speaker 5:          00:16:40       You should go back to that. You make your own clothes, you grow your own Burgers, right? You want to fucking Burger, go slaughter that calf and then you figure out how to freeze the rest of that meter. You're going to start this winter if they're pilgrim. Um, I think to something's good, something like that's gonna happen. We're either going to regress to that after the shit hits the fan or this illuminati stuff is true. And the robots will kill all of us. And uh,

Speaker 5:          00:17:07       oh wow. That'd be amazing in the future, right? This, this Illuminati city, everybody's dead except for the Illuminati people. Right. And the other people that they keep making, they kept enough people, right, with good genes that they make fuck each other. So they keep making babies and stuff that they can use to fucking, uh, you know, as almost like a parts car, you know, for Oregon's, when they reach maturity. I know this is fucked up, right? Uh, sort of like Westworld meets a guy with a head cold doing a podcast on a Thursday. That's how it pitched this in Hollywood. I come in, I say hello everybody. We do all this small talk, but Baba Baba, Baba, you know, I, I read the fucking room. I try to figure out where the laughs are going to be, you know, try to block out the ice cold person. That douche was just sitting there fidgeting with their fucking pen. Um, and I would, I would just pitch it. I pitch the hell out of it. So anyways, so then you have an Illuminati city.

Speaker 5:          00:18:07       All right. And they feel like they've won, but their actual actually prisoners because the robots have the city surrounded, you know, and they still have some robots. The older versions that are good, you know, that's still work with the people. But the latest update, other one went fucking rogue and killed a couple of the, it was like the first people that died other than the parts people and like hundreds of years. So they hit the fucking shield and I got this big bubble, like the Simpsons set one time, right? They got this big bubble over the fucking city and they stay in there with the older version of the robots and they're the ones that have to try to protect him as the fuck. And the higher level ones are trying to figure out how to get into the bubble. And that's what it is. And it's weird thing you'd have to root for these pieces, shit, humans. So then obviously what would happen is you'd have a really good looking parts person like Ryan Gosling and he, Hey Nia, hi, hi. And he would, uh, he would somehow, you know, he'd bang like the hottest Illuminati person and she believed in him. And then him and one of the lesser robots then fucking

Speaker 5:          00:19:24       to feet the next level robots while freeing all the parts people and then killing the Illuminati people. There you go. And you could, you could finish the story halfway through it and then get everybody to go to the second one, right? And then all you, you have to do is just show up down at comic con wherein an Obi wan Kenobi rope. And I think he got $1 billion franchise. What do you think? Yeah, you liked that movie? I love it. What would you name that movie

Speaker 2:          00:19:52       bills?

Speaker 2:          00:19:54       Great idea for a movie. Oh, Jesus. What are you doing on my phone? I wasn't listening. I'm texting myself. Those pictures. What pictures? The pictures you took of me earlier. That's it. Yeah. I got to get back to our child. Oh, that's right. I forgot we had a kid come on you guys. You know, so he puts 10,000 hours into that idea. You got yourself a good fucking movie Boobie Boobie. It's a lot of hacky shit in there. You know, it's like Westworld meets fucking Moonraker, uh, with a dash a happy days. You know, cause at some point some I'll fucking Ron Howard directs Ryan Gosling stars. He probably wouldn't do it because you already did blade runner. Do you guys see that one? The 20, 48 blade runner that moves the movie was the Shit I just noticed. I probably had been coughing like every five fucking seconds on this. I apologize. I Apologize, but I'm not going to take a cough drop. All right.

Speaker 1:          00:21:00       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:21:01       Cough drops if for Socialists.

Speaker 1:          00:21:06       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:21:07       All right. Anyway, so you know, like when you do an interview, when you got to fucking show coming up, they go pale. So what can people expect from you? Wow. What are you gonna be talking about when I come to town? What do you what? I can't fucking tell you that cause then the jokes are going to be over. Everybody's going to know what I'm going to be talking about. What kind of fucking question is that? You sound like you're still a great way under she'll these days,

Speaker 2:          00:21:34       I'm not angry. It's just my, my default emotion. I walk around relaxed and then when anything happens, good or bad, I get it and I don't. I don't, I don't know if it's good. I don't get angry. I don't know. Hey, we got a new advertiser. Okay. We somehow convince somebody else to get on this sinking ship. Let's see here. From the halls of Mark Tazo Ma to the shores of Tripoli. I will type my far again. Password. All right. Oh, butchers box, butchers box, and we're not talking about his wife. All right. Butchers box. Now these guys actually sent me a bag of fucking butchered meat and I had a steak the other day. I may add my wife cooked it. Uh Huh. Tell me I'm not running shit in my house. I was actually sick and she's a sweetheart and she cooked it and it was fucking delicious. It was a giant portion. So much that I've actually saved it for a little bit of steak and eggs. Later on this week, a butcher box delivers healthy 100% grass fed and finished beef. I don't know what finished means. They are. That means they butchered it. Free Range, organic chicken and heritage bread. Pork directly to your door on a monthly basis. Eat like you're in the Illuminati. All their products are humanely raised.

That's old world pork before they bred out all of the fat

Speaker 2:          00:23:40       and flavor to make it the other white meat a key a. This is the way they were meant to be. I got to look up heritage bread, pork. That's fascinating. Unbelievable. It's like a mat and a old car with matching numbers. Unbelievable tastes is a huge difference in taste between animals raised on pasture and those fed and grain constant in concentration, animal feedlot operations. But your box is changing that. This is great. This is more and more of these types of people. Got To love it. Um, and they offer free shipping anywhere in the, in the 48 states, the lower 48 Alaska. Who's kidding? Who Right?

There's certain animals that I, I, you know, I like all animals, but I fucking love pigs. Is any cooler than a little piglet running around deaf Alec Ducks?

Speaker 1:          00:25:20       Yeah,

Speaker 2:          00:25:21       I like piglets. He moves freaked me out. Dogs are awesome cats I respect, but you know what I mean?

Speaker 1:          00:25:29       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:25:30       I, you know, I, there's never any like sort of like every once in a while you meet a really cool fucking cat. All right. Definitely. But they got that Freddy Krueger claws and shit. You know, you turned around real quick and they were like practicing killing, Ya know, you catch them stock and you and shit. That fucking weird.

Speaker 1:          00:25:47       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:25:47       You wake up there on your chest staring at you like that chicken misery. All right. Purpose swine at been a part of the American agricultural landscape since the arrival of the new world calling us. Why do they have to go that fucking far back?

Speaker 1:          00:26:05       Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:26:05       This is why I don't read books. Moby Dick get to the fucking whale.

Speaker 2:          00:26:13       Sorry. Swine indigenous to Europe were brought with immigrants during the colonization of America commercials. Fucking things in the, the wooden ship. Freaking the fuck out. Riding over there with us. Hairless monkeys knowing they're going to get killed. Um, and the many different types of swine. They brought. Hep provided pork, Lard, pest control in land improvement services for centuries. How to pork on a pigs, help with pest control cause they fucking eat everything. I have something else to look up. This is how you lose a day on the Internet because there's always an answer. It doesn't mean it's right, but there's always someone who some will have a page, is what I think. There's why what they do with Bar Mitzvah. A modern bread associations maintained pedigree registries of pure bred animals for each breed that descends from these colonial oh wow. These are like the fucking, the blue bloods of pigs as well as later introductions. A registration of animals destined to become breeding stock is essential to the longterm security of the breeds. Registration validates bred status of the animals and assures their availability for conservation by future generations. Many swap lines, but he swines Bree swine breeds that were once core components of regional cultures are now in danger of extinction as cultures of Homo Homo. [inaudible] Homo.

Speaker 1:          00:27:43       Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:27:44       Generalized, homogenized. God, I'm stupid. And historic agricultural traditions abandoned the flavors and food traditions that revolved or, yeah, check out Monsanto for that one fucking lunatics definition of heritage swine.

Speaker 1:          00:28:00       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:28:01       I don't even know if it's about sat off. They always said the fault people you blame. Who knows? Allegedly Monsanto heritage swine must adhere to all of the following one. I ain't a true chin. Genetic bread. The breed is a true genetic breed of swine. That is when made it together. It reproduces the breed type. All right. I guess this is from Europe to de dos. What does it ains times? I, I don't, I can't do the chairman and dangered breed. The breed is or has been endangered as defined by the livestock cons.

Speaker 1:          00:28:46       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:28:47       Conservancy and appears on or has recovered from the con conservancies conservation priority list and the critically threatened Jesus Christ. Long history in the U s purebreds. I get it. It's pure bread. I like it. They're fucking in danger and I'm eating them. I'm meeting the fucking pig version of a fucking bald eagle. Um,

Speaker 1:          00:29:10       okay.

Speaker 2:          00:29:11       What the fuck did I just, I just shut that off and I, I wanted to, what else did I want to look up? Who is it? Oh, how to pigs control pass population. What? He eat bugs. Not how, how not how to bill. How do, okay, here we go. Well, it just says forbid. Then information was forbidden. Practical feral pig control because feral pig population as the wild pigs. Anyways. Fuck this shit. How are their wild pigs by the way? Well, those, the farmers that got scalped by the native Americans, so they just steer pigs just ran off. Continue to fuck for centuries, you know?

Speaker 4:          00:30:12       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:30:13       I Dunno, I don't have the answers to these questions, but I do have some bullshit I have to do at 10 o'clock. Uh, alright. That is the podcast. This was a weird one. All right. But we came up with a good movie idea. We learned about heritage page and fucking a swine from Europe and a Gopro lunch and Celtics about those Celtics. And I try to wrap up these Pesky fucking Milwaukee Bucks. You know I like that. One guy on Milwaukee, he looks like a fucking like a mid sized minuit bull. Really dark skinned guy. He hit, he had some fucking lay up or some shit to go up by four in the second quarter. The shush the crowd. Like he just hit a game winning three does this second quarter. Then they go on to lose the game. I just don't, I tie, I don't understand these kids today. All right everybody have a great weekend [inaudible] and I'll see everybody in there.

Speaker 7:          00:31:13       Lana and I'll see you down at the fucking race track count. Come Saturday,

Speaker 2:          00:31:19       listen to the music and enjoy, you know, the half hour of our greatest sets from a Thursday just before Friday. Monday morning podcast, Thursday earlier this year, possibly this decade. All right, I'll see ya.

Speaker 7:          00:32:16       Hey, what's going on? It's bill burr and it is the Monday morning podcast from Monday, April 26th April, April 26th, 2010 how the hell are you? I'm a little late today with the podcasts doing at three 43 Los angles is time. Uh, and you probably want to like do what the fuck you supposed to be doing these Monday morning. That's why you call it the Monday morning. So when

Speaker 8:          00:32:40       I come to work on Monday morning, I have something to listen to rather than focusing on the fucking job that I hate. Well, you're right. Landless. I am late this week, but you know what, I was busy fucking busy this week. Uh, I, I was doing shit this morning, you know what I mean? And also not to mention I am filming this podcast for the first time ever. I am allowing somebody else into the Monday morning podcast bunker until now. People just had to use their imagination to wonder what the fuck does bill look like while he does this podcast? Is he wearing a Tuxedo, maybe a dinner jacket? Is he sitting there? You know, I'm not, I'm in pajamas and my t shirt with my little radio shack headphones on the exact way that you pictured me, but I am filming at this week, um, because, uh, my DVD is, uh, just about complete and now we are working on extras.

Speaker 8:          00:33:35       And I think at my last DVD I did the, uh, I did a little short history, a bunch of clubs that I loved in New York. So you kinda got that whole background and I figured out my me, I'll do this. Maybe I'll fill in the podcast, edit out the hours and hours of unfunny moments, right? See, you're going to actually hear the whole fucking podcast, these idiots who bought my DVD, who are going to watch it and just be like, oh my God, this is the greatest fucking thing I've ever seen because of the wonderful world of editing. So he probably thinking like, what are you doing bill? You filming it yourself and you're going to edit it that, that, that does not, that's not consistent with the moron that I'm used to listening to what? You're right. I'm not, I have the wonderfully talented Brian Spitz is a working the camera. Yep. That was him right there. He actually shot my failed pilot last year on comedy central. Remember that one? That was fun and we got excited then we were like, it's going to happen. It was, it grow with,

Speaker 7:          00:34:28       honestly, it was a great fucking show. Wasn't it

Speaker 8:          00:34:32       ever in the history and the history of failed pilots? I, I would say we, yeah, we weren't, we were in the, you know, we just failed as opposed to just a complete failure. It'd be like, you know, if a patch passing grade was 60, I think we, I think we've got about 58 on that, you know, I don't know. But you know what the weird thing is, it's actually up on my imdv page.

Speaker 7:          00:34:54       That's what I love. I don't know who put it up there, but you're not supposed to put shit on there that isn't on TV or it wasn't released in cinema or whatever. And uh, I, for the life of me, I don't know how to take it down, but um, you'll take it care. Okay. Thank you. Because people, all right, well it was cool. Can you actually, can you actually call IMD be okay? Yeah, but that sounded good. I was, I'm going to call those guys, I'm gonna call that website and uh, you know, get those guys on the phone to see what's up. So yeah. So if you're ever wondering what the burn effect was, that was just a working title that we gave it to them. It never aired and it won't air unless I become hugely famous or infamous. That's basically it. If I become a huge movie star or television star, you'll probably up seeing it in

Speaker 8:          00:35:38       some form. Or if I go to a mall and I just started fucking, you know, killing puppies at the local pet store or whatever the fuck you do. I wouldn't say shooting because every, everybody's done the shooting thing. Isn't that like Hackey at this point? You know what I mean? That's, it's like, it's like if I was a comedian, I went on on stage and I started talking about airline food. Basically go walking in to a mall massacring people, I think it's Hacky at this point. You know, Yawn. If I can be so bold to say I'm fucking bored with that shit. But anyways, let's get to me and my big fucking week. Do you guys have a big week? Well, if you didn't, let me fucking tell you about my big week. First of all, I don't know if I've been talking about this on the podcast as I settle into my sofa.

Speaker 8:          00:36:22       Um, basically everything that identified me as the person that I am, uh, a month ago, either it was expiring or I didn't have it, you know, I basically could not prove that I existed with any sort of paper. You know, my passport was expiring my driver's license. I needed to get that thing for about fucking two years. I'm not gonna lie to you when you first move out to Los Angeles. I think they give you about six weeks to get it. And I've almost been out here for three fucking years. So, uh, and my New York license was expiring. I didn't have a social security card that I could produce. I had the number, you know, the Illuminati gave me a fucking number when I was eight years old. Let's get them on the wheel to get them on the wheel. Let's get them in debt. Are you in college?

Speaker 8:          00:37:11       Are you making 200 bucks a week? Hey, here's a visa card. We'll give you a $3,000 limit. Don't worry. Don't worry. Give us 25 bucks a week and just get it up to you three grand limit and we'll fucking own your ass. All right, so I didn't have that. What else didn't I have my and my birth certificate, I had nothing. I had nothing. So I was like a, it was like fuck, I got to handle this shit. You know, cause all of a sudden now I'm doing gigs in Europe, you know, I think I'm going to Japan to perform for the troops. I need pieces of papers saying I am who I am and I have not done anything fucked up. So a, in one month I got my passport renewed, I went down to the social security office, I got that fucking thing, I found my birth certificate.

Speaker 8:          00:37:54       And the last thing I needed was my driver's license. Say figure out the driver's license. I mean, that's a pain in the ass to take the fucking test. You know, you ever notice like what a pussy you become as an adult when it comes to tests. Like I think once you don't take a test for what you're used to it as a kid, people are always testing you. You know where I'm in a spelling test where I've vocabulary tests, some bully punches in the face. He's testing you. You know, are you going to be a fucking man? You know, you Charles Bronson at age 12 or are you fucking are Richie Cunningham who I was and got bullied and sees no reason to go back to a fucker reunion now. It wasn't that bad. You know what? I'll be honest with you. Uh, when was it bad?

Speaker 8:          00:38:36       Maybe elementary school. Beginning of middle school, everybody hit their growth spurt and I didn't, I still had a high pitched voice in a, a an orange Afro. That wasn't a good look. That wasn't the look you wanted to rock is the youth says. So. Anyways, I have to take my driver's test out here and I brought it up with a couple other la Los Angelenos and straight across the board. Everybody was telling me like they had horror in their eyes and how difficult this fucking test was going. Oh my God, dude, dude, it's dude. It's fucking hard. It's fucking hard. They kept saying that. Remember I was living out here 10 years ago. I took the test. It wasn't fucking hard, like don't do it. I'm telling you, dude, it was fucking hard and I had this girl with this party was this, have you been to the DMV on here?

Speaker 8:          00:39:19       Oh my God. It's not like the DMV. Anyway, off La. It's just like if on Dale and I kept saying, well I bended the DMV. I been to it. I know it's crowded and she just kept going now. Now like you don't understand, there's nothing worse than somebody just tells me like you don't understand. It's like from so many from Chicago, when you try to tell him it was a cold winter and then they got to go on about fucking now you don't know what cold is until you're standing there rubbing your balls next to fucking Lake Michigan, you know, like it's fucking minus 20 degrees in Boston. But still, that's my, you know, my family all came from fucking the Midwest. So anytime I had a paper, when I bitch about the Colo, let me tell you, you don't know cold. You don't go to Chicago.

Speaker 8:          00:39:57       Let me tell you, go to Chicago so that all those fucking idiots and some good barbecue, I'll do it. You don't know barbecue? Go to fucking Texas. That's where they got the bar. Like, like they're the only people who know that shit. All right, you got a little upset there. Don't hold it against me. So anyways, uh, [inaudible] he's telling me I don't know what the fucking DMV is. You know what all this does. This just motivates me to pass this fucking test and the first time so I can just make, so I can justify me judging all these la Douche bags, like they're just mentally weak fucking people. So I started studying the test, get the book, and it's like 90 pages. I was like, fuck, all right, whatever. Break it down. I'm going to do 30 pages a day. I outlined this book, Huh?

Speaker 8:          00:40:38       What are you doing right now sitting in your cubicle instead of working, looking at your spreadsheets, what are you doing? I hear what I fucking outlined the book. I outlined the book 30 pages at a fucking time meticulously like Tom Hanks in that movie when he was chasing Leonardo Dicaprio. Catch me if you can. I was like that, that level of shit. And I was, I, I just, you know, fucking broke the whole book down. And then I sat there every day for 45 minutes to an hour and I went over all the shit in two days before the test. Saturday. I actually took the sections out that I, that I still was having problem with and I just fucking went hardcore on that section. Memorize that and went through my all my outline. I knew the whole fucking thing and how you want to ask me some questions.

Speaker 8:          00:41:22       You want to talk about parking near railroad tracks. I got to fucking answer for you. Seven and a half feet. If you're inside a seven and a half feet, you're fucked. 18 inches from the curb, three feet from a fucking handicap ramp. You know one of these fucking guys rolling by asking you for a quarter. Those guys can't get like three feet close to those guys. 15 feet from a hydro. You've got to start signaling a hundred feet before you make a turn. You get in the turning lane. You can only drive in it for 200 feet. He can't use it as a passing lane. I had the shit down, so I'm like, fuck all these people. I walked in there confident. I'm talking Colby Bryan, eight seconds left. Give me the fucking ball. All right. I ironed my shirt. I knew I was getting a picture of that day for my license to be nothing but success.

Speaker 8:          00:42:04       So I walk in there, I don't want to happen immediately. I start getting fucking nervous. You know like the first time I did Letterman. All right, like the first fucking time you do anything. I'm, I'm fucking get nervous. I've taken this fucker test four different times. Took it in Boston, passed it, New York passed it, came out to la 10 years ago I passed it, moved back to New York, passed the thing. Why am I fucking nervous? Cause he's fucking Las holes. Their voices are in my head. Did it, did you fucking hard dude, I fucking failed. You know how to I forgot to mention is they all said the same shit. Why? Why they failed. It is cause they didn't study the first time. Cause I thought it was gonna be easy cause they drive every day. Do you really? How do you just think of how stupid that statement is, dude, I drive every day.

Speaker 8:          00:42:45       I know how to do it. It's those little things, you know like what does a white curb meat, you know, he come up and it's painted white. What does that mean? Loading and unloading of passengers or picking up mail, yellow curb, what does that mean? La Loading and unloading of freight. If you're not in a commercial vehicle, the driver has to stay with the car. I studied for the Shit gimme the rock, it's fucking going in and we're going to the next round of the playoffs. I was ready for that shit and I went in there and I maybe there was just the overall anxiety, the fucking place. But I do the whole shit. First of all I do, what I always do at the DMV is I just blow off the line and I act like I didn't see it and that I'm some sorta like, you know, royalty, like I'm actually staying at the embassy for some fucking country and never heard of.

Speaker 8:          00:43:34       I'm that guy. You know when you stand in line and you followed the rules and then you get up to the fucking cashier lady and then there's that dose. He was just standing there to the side respectively, half an inch just behind your peripheral. But you know he's there and you can't have a pause in your conversation because you know that asshole's going to jump in. That's who the fuck I was. And I said, Hey, I'm sorry buddy, sorry. And I wasn't sorry. That was me really being like, dude, I'm interrupting you right now. And I said, ah, I've got to take this, uh, you know, I had a previous, you know, a schedule appointment, where do I go? Like, Oh, you go around the corner, whatever. So thank the guy. I wasn't saying thank you. I don't know what the fuck I was doing. It's just trying to prevent the guy from punching me in the face because I deserved it.

Speaker 8:          00:44:10       And I went over to go take the fucking test and a, I'm standing there and they only got like this walled off area. Okay. And that's how confident I was. I didn't even, I didn't even brush up out in the parking lot. I was just like, bring the shit on. You want me to take Lebron? I fucking got him right. So I walk in there right? And you got to wait til like only line of like five people in there at a time. So the first dude walks out and uh, you know, they got the black dude behind the counter, like the host scared straight. You need to get your shit together. Kind of do, you know, and I'm just sitting there going off, fuck, here we go. Here we go. This fucking guy, this guy's breaking hearts all day and he doesn't even give a fuck.

Speaker 8:          00:44:51       Look at it. Look on his face. He doesn't give a fuck that bill Parcells look on his face, right? So there's fucking Indian dude comes up and he and he hands him the thing and the guy just fucking puts red all over it and the guy fails. And then I'm like, oh fuck the any guy. These guys are fucking smart, right? Any guys are smart. They fucking answer our phones over here. I can't answer phones. If somebody from India called me, you know, give myself a fake Indian named, these fucking people are smart. These people were running shit until the English fucked him over, right? This guy fucking pass. But then I calmed myself down. I'm like, wait a minute, this is a second language. This is his second language. If I went to France, could I pass the driver's test? Fuck No. All right, don't compare yourself to that guy.

Speaker 8:          00:45:30       And then the next two came up and it was a slacker. This white kid who had like tight jeans yet, they were hanging off his ass and I just wanted a boot him right in his fucking taint. He passes. So it gave me hope and I went in there, I got the test, okay, I get eight hours sleep. I took a deep breath and I'm like, here we go. I have the test right in front of me and the first one was some bullshit about what is the legal alcohol level. You know that you can drive on it. I'm like, this is a fucking joke. I'm going to ace this test and dude, I'm going to tell you right now after the first question, it just went down fucking hill. Listen to these questions. I'm studying all this shit about how close to park to a curve, a curb and all that shit.

Speaker 8:          00:46:13       You must notify the DMV within five days. If you sell or transfer your vehicle are cited for a traffic violation. That's, that's obviously no paint your vehicle a different color sound like, oh fuck, I didn't read that part. I don't remember that part. Sell or transfer your vehicle, painted a different color. Five days, sell a transfer your vehicle. Don't you have to fucking tell them right then I want, they automatically know with the satellites, they won't see that transaction. Go down in the fucking driveway through it. And then this is panic just like, and I, and I, and I was like, oh my God, what the fuck? And I got like six questions in and I literally put the number two pencil down and I whispered, yell. I went, really? As I looked at the black dude when he wasn't looking at me, of course, totally passive aggressive and, uh, do it.

Speaker 8:          00:47:03       I'm not going to lie to you this fucking test. So it was brutal to fucking brutal. And I, you know, usually when you take a multiple choice test, it's like there's the obvious the half right? And then the fucking ridiculous. Like when you drink a glass of water, should you a uh, make sure you have enough air in your lungs before sucking down the entire glass. And if you do run out of air, stop drinking and inhale, you know, be smashed the glass against your head, you know, obvious shit. Right? This shit was like, when is it legal to use a cell phone? I have the test right here without a hands free device while driving. Okay. When is it legal to use a cell phone without using a hands free device? Huh? You got an answer a when making a call while stopped at a red light, that's obviously no, but here's the two close ones.

Speaker 8:          00:47:54       When making a call for emergency assistance or never, when is it legal to use a cell phone? Hands Free people, hands free, hands free device and has all this shit on TV going if he used his cell phone and it's as bad as fucking drinking and driving. And the book, it said never and it said you could use it to, if for to make to make an emergency call after you fucking pulled over and all that bullshit. Look for somebody riding a bike. You know, looking for an old guy, one of those, try sickles, all of that shit. So this just said when making a call for emergency assistance, it didn't say you pulled over. It didn't say you didn't pull over. So I fucking panicked and I wrote never got it wrong. All right, let's just, that's fucking stories taking 10 times longer. How long it took me to study for the fucking test.

Speaker 8:          00:48:45       Long story short, I'd have 18 questions. I got 15 right. Three wrong. I fucking pass the test but I owe, I owe an apology to all you Los Angelenos. This is a hard ass fucking test. It was difficult. I know what you're thinking. Like that way you guys were all talking shit cause you're relaxed right now. Right? We find another difficult one here. Highways are typically most slippery. This is a desert question cause it doesn't rain out here. And what happens is when it doesn't rain for a while, oil transmission, fluid, fluid, and gas all starts to coagulate. And when it rains, it's like, I can't say it's like ice, but God knows people drive like it out here. But this, this is the question, it says, uh, uh, would, uh, fuck was it. Highways are typically most slippery during a heavy rainstorm in the middle of, in the middle of summer.

Speaker 8:          00:49:33       All right. Middle of summer, it's fucking dry out. You know, maybe that's it. And then it says when it's, when it first starts to rain after a dry spell. Well yeah, yeah, after a dry spell. Absolutely. But the summer's dry. What the fuck writes? And at this point, my Mike fucking heart rate is going like 9,000 beats a second. And then it says after it's been raining for a long time, if it's been raining for a long time, the roads are wet. It's going to still be fucking slippery. But I know it has to do with it being dry out here. So I fucking broke that one down. I'm like, all right, it's the middle of summer. It's a heavy fucking rainstorm. Who's to say it didn't fucking rain heavily the day before and it already washed all the guests off. So then I get, so I guessed when it first starts to rain after a dry spell and I was fucking right, but that's the level you had to break this shit down. All right, so I passed. That's it. They took my thumb. The fucking Illuminati,

Speaker 7:          00:50:29       you know, sent that right to the Rothschild's fucking house. Do you know those sons of bitches actually have the audacity, the Rothschilds to have a book about the giant fucking house they bought in England off of all their fucking Shylock money from the rest of us. Do you believe you believe the fucking balls of that? Evidently there's something beyond our mansion. It's called a manner. That's when you have you, that's when you do take like fucking 12 mansions and you put it together and like, people don't even know how to get to your house. Like I can guarantee you something right fucking now. Oh, this is a great way to see if they're running shit. You know when you Google maps, like if you Google map where the fuck I live? Not only can you see my place, they'll probably, you can probably see my brand new social security card.

Speaker 7:          00:51:14       No one gives a fuck about me. But if you Google map the Rothschild's house, I guarantee you it doesn't fucking show up like the God Damn White House cause they're running shit. And you know what? They have my thumbprint on their fucking wall of the, of their fucking nine mile wine cellar. Does that make any sense? Well it shouldn't because I don't read. All right. I don't fucking read anyways. What else do I got going on here that wasn't bad hot for being filmed that in and seem to self conscious. Look at that. Get a big nod. Eyebrows up. I think it's going good. The first filmed Monday morning podcast. This is what I do. If you've been listening to this, I'm talking to the camera right now, not to you go back to work. You've been fucking off already for 19 minutes and 40 seconds.

Speaker 7:          00:51:57       This is what I do every week. I sit here in my, in my, in my pajamas and my little footlocker tee shirt, you know, is this foot locker? I don't know what the fuck this is. Footlocker, like 87 t shirts for like $9 if you ever wondered if you ever wondered, hey, did a three year old put this shirt together or was the person at least 16 you can never be more sure than when you go to footlocker and you buy those fucking tee shirts. When you get like nine of them for eight bucks, that's guaranteed that that's not even child. That's like toddler, toddler fucking labor. Be funnier if I could fucking say it. So this is what I do every week. Okay. Is what I do. So if you want to listen to the podcast, go to [inaudible] dot com click on Monday morning podcasts.

Speaker 7:          00:52:41       You hate your fucking job. Hopefully there'll be on iTunes at this point. They will be, I'm going to talk shit, they're going to be on iTunes. You know I have like 14 listeners. I'm trying to get it up to 15 whenever they put there. Why the fuck you want from me? All right, let's plow. Okay, I'm back. I'm back doing the podcast. Um, all right, let's get to the stories this week. I, uh, that was the first story. I'm just gonna tell some stories this week. I got another one for you. Um, at this point, do you want me to pause Brian and go into another room to give people something visually different to look at? Should I do that? All right, let's try to hit pause here. Uh, this is going to be really quick for you. People listening at home. It's like, I'm going to pause and then we're back.

Speaker 7:          00:53:18       So I'm pausing right now. All right. Yeah, we'll, we'll put bookshelves and the, okay, we're back. We're back. We decided, you know what, we already tried to do this and I fucking lost the whole podcast. So we're not doing it. I'm recording right now. We just, you don't need to record this. You don't even, you know, I'm not going to use this on a DVD. This is just for the poor bastards at home listening. I actually, so that's my deal. Everybody. I'm moving shit around my apartment right now. This is exciting. It's exciting to audit in an audio way to hear the it isn't. I know it's not, dude. You know what? Is there any doctors that listen to this? How fucking arrogant is that? Like they have time between surgery to listen to a moron like me. Well, a lot of doctors are arrogant anyways.

Speaker 7:          00:53:58       They save people's lives. They get that God complex. Just to let you know. I'll do, that's my water. All right. That's yours over there. Okay. Just letting you know. I mean, I like you when everything, all right. You did a great job on the pilot, but let's, let's keep it there. Um, I fucked up the arch in my foot. I did it years ago from playing drums, trying to get my foot as fast as John Bonham's having no fucking technique and not having stretched so that that tendon that runs from the ball of your fucking foot to your heel every once in a while, I fuck it up in it and it just takes forever to heal and I don't know what I'm supposed to do about it. All right? I stretch. I got the tennis ball rubbing underneath it. I know I'm not supposed to walk around, but that's what I do.

Speaker 7:          00:54:43       Okay? I use my feet. A lot of people don't, you know, if you walk into a Mcdonald's and you see those people, that's what they use their feet for, to walk to their car, to sit in their car. And then if they don't even go in anymore, they just drive right up. So I want to know what else can I be doing? Is there any sort of aspirin that I can be taking to get the fucking inflammation down? And you probably wondered, okay, you're, you're probably asking me this bill because not being able to use your footage, fucking annoying. It goes beyond that. Dr. So, and so I'll tell you what my problem is. My problem is I'm going back east for, for a friend of mine's daughter is graduating college and I have to go to the graduation and uh, I'm getting it back, get getting together with some people I used to play drums with, we used to jam with back in the day when we all thought we were going to get on MTV and be the latest hair metal band, the fact that you had a red head and a hair metal band and then he could only grow a fucking Afro right there.

Speaker 7:          00:55:48       Should've let you know that you weren't gonna make it. So long story short, we're getting together and rather than going back and playing the music we played in the 80s because that would just be too sad to go back and play my Michelle or whatever the fuck we used to play. We're like, let's do something more contemporary. And I've always played single bass drum and I became a huge fan of Pantera and shit. So I go, let's do cowboys from hell and it's got this insane double bass part. And the second I said that Shit, I fucked up my foot and I haven't been able to practice. And meanwhile, the guitar player, the Bass Player, they're all shredding, you know, ignoring their children. So, and here I am going to be the foundation of the band and my foot's fucked up. So I need a quick remedy. All right, I need something.

Speaker 7:          00:56:33       I need something fucking quickly here. Uh, that, is there anything that I can take that, that will just, you know, I don't want to take roids from my foot coming there with my right foot twice as big as the, uh, my left foot. You know, I don't need that. Have one big Jason Gme, Roger Clemens Foot and the other one's walking around like Willie McGee. I don't need that shit. All right, tell me, what do I take aspirin? Aleve. What do I take? Come on podcast fucking free. You can hook me up a little free medical advice. Can you email me a prescription or that just literally, and you're, you're fucking days as a doctor. All right, let's, let's continue on with the podcast. As I sit here, rolling a tennis ball underneath my foot. Um, the next thing, oh, here's a great story for you, Brian. You might like this.

Speaker 7:          00:57:19       Do you know I was a hero this week? I was actually, I did something heroic. I have never, I have never done anything heroic in my life. Okay. And believe me, I've walked by house fires and saw people screaming saying there's a ladder right there. Just put it up. And I walked away. I walked away. It's kind of like I didn't hear him. I'm that kind of a fucking guy. Um, no, this is the deal. It was a Sunday. And you know, people go to brunch on Sunday on like, all right, fuck it. I'll go to brunch. I'll go to brunch. Right? Remember that bid? Huh? Pace $18 as fast as the Wa. Is that a, this, how did that bit go? Is that as, I thought it was pesto. It's asparagus. I can't remember. So we go to brunch and a, you know, it's the usual shit.

Speaker 7:          00:58:04       Do you want to sit inside? You want to sit out outside as a redhead? I'm always going inside. Let's fucking sit inside. I got enough freckles. I've had enough fucking pain in my life. Please. Let's sit inside now. But you know, I'm always with broads cause they always want to go to brunch and it's fun. It's fun. It's always fucking nice when they go to brunch. It's never raining is it? Right. Sorry. All right, let's sit outside. We sit outside and because I'm the gentlemen, I have to sit with my back to the road so I can brace, you know, and protect my girlfriend and her mom and case a bread truck comes flying in because the guys text messaging or something, right? So I'm sitting there and uh, all of a sudden I just feel it. I just feel like something's fucking wrong and something my caveman DNA, like when you get in stocked by a saber tooth, tiger just kicks in and something just tells me to fucking look left.

Speaker 7:          00:58:57       And I look left and here comes this crazy fucking lady and I'm talking crazy. I'm talking shutter island. Remember that chick that shushed Leonardo Dicaprio set the second Leonardo Dicaprio fucking reference. There you go. You remember that chick who shushed him and shutter island? That's what this girl looked like, except with sort of brownish red hair. Okay? It's basically one of these people who should be getting professional help is straight up bat shit crazy, and there's just, this state is bankrupt, so they just let them go. They just let these fucking people go and you don't see Sarah McLaughlin wine and about these people come out and rescue these fucking, these people who are talking to telephone poles. It's all about the dogs with her. Her priorities are so fucked up. It's ridiculous. I hope she sees this. I am so disappointed in you Sarah McLaughlin. Huh? When are you going to grow up and stop whining about those little pussy ass fucking dogs?

Speaker 7:          00:59:56       All right. That was mean. All right, let's get back to it. So she starts coming down the street and she's like, she looks like she's going to start fucking crying. Okay. Like, and it's just one of those things, you know, you just feel it. This fucking person is going to do something and I have a feeling they're going to do it to me. So I, I'm, I'm working out my shit. I'm like first, fortunately the chairs with these really light wicker sorta kind of Douchey Brunchy chairs. So I was just going to grab the fucking chair and I was going to smash her in the face if I didn't have time or if I had time I was going to leap to my feet on my bad fucking foot and out like a lion tamer, get back crazy person, right.

Speaker 7:          01:00:34       Start whipping her with the fucking tulips on the Nice, beautiful brunch table. That's what I was going to do. So she doesn't lunge at me, but she walks by means that awful moment, the blind spot, you know what I mean? Where she's not to my left, she's not to my right. She's right behind me and she fucking goes by me and I'm like, thank God. I was seriously fucking nervous and I looked left again just to, you know, I don't know why I looked left again. And then I see this fucking sad looking woman slowly following the crazy person with this look on her face like she had been wronged. I, next thing I know, next thing I fucking know, she's talking to the table next to us and talking to us, talking about how that crazy woman had just walked up to her, reached up to her sweater and just fucking ripped.

Speaker 7:          01:01:22       I know she had a brooch. She just fucking took it off her chest and walked away with it. And I'm looking at the lady and she has the lady and she has this fucking hole in her sweater where something had clearly been ripped off. And for the life of me, I don't know why I immediately just got up. I don't know why. I have no fucking idea why there was a fight. I don't do this shit. I get up and now I'm going down the street following the shutter island lady with no training whatsoever in this situation. I'm literally walking and now I couldn't sit down. I couldn't get sit down. Like, I have this, this fucking Lee Marvin, I'm going to go, I'm going to make shit right moment. And then I go, you know what? Maybe I'll sit down. I look at the biggest pussy ever and not only my girlfriend and my mother's there.

Speaker 7:          01:02:11       So I had to keep going. So now I'm following this girl and I'm literally, I'm fine. Haven't been so fucking nervous in my life because it would have been bad enough if we, if it was like a crazy dude, a crazy guy. He's scary. But at least you know if, if, if it gets physical, I mean, what, what, what are the rules in that? Do you know Brian? What did you know? You can't hit a woman, but what if she's crazy and she just stole a brooch? How about a jab? Just kind of get a mitten, a face like Larry Holmes, so she doesn't see the overhand, right. Anyways, I don't know what to do, so, but I can't go back to the table or I'm going to look like a bitch in front of my girlfriend and my mom saw, I'm like, fuck, why didn't I get up?

Speaker 7:          01:02:52       Why did I get up? Why didn't I, why didn't I say sit inside? I wanted to sit inside, but I didn't want to seem like a root prick in front of my girlfriend's mom. Like I tell her what to do. Like she says, kept fucking woman Saddam in this situation. So I'm walking down the street and this is what I do. She's on the sidewalk. I'm literally in the street. Okay. I'm like, is that circumnavigation I'm doing some police shit where I'm staying outside of whatever she can throw at me scratching. It's one of these people, you got to get like a tetanus shot if you roll around the ground or hepatitis Assam Shit. So I'm like, what am I going to do? What do I do? So I don't know what happened. I just said I, I basically, I just started going, hey ya. Hey Sweetheart.

Speaker 7:          01:03:33       Hey Sweetie. I basically, I think I started calling her affectionate name from like the 1940s hey ya, fucking tall drink of water. And I finally got her attention and she turns around and looks at me with this crazy look with tears in her eyes. And I just say, uh, I, I, I think you have something that doesn't belong to you. And meanwhile, there's a fucking pathetic lady who just let her walk up to her to begin with. It's like he didn't see that she was crazy. That's why I'm in this situation, right. She fucking, she ends up walking up to the girl and the h when I said, I think you have something that doesn't belong to you. She just sort of looked at me and like in slow motion, lifted up her left arm and she had this green pea soup look and sweater on and she had the brooch pinned to like just right around her wrist and she just held it up. So at this point I'm like, I'm not touching this bitch.

Speaker 7:          01:04:26       So I let the, the, the fucking victim lady with the sad puppy dog eyes, she comes in and I'm basically sitting there like an NHL ref with respect for two goons that are about ready to go at it. Right. And I'm just going to jump in when I see that I can jump in to stop this, this fight that's going to happen without getting hit myself. And uh, so anyways, the lady starts unpinning the brooch and the whole time she's, she basically followed my lead by being nice. She just kept gone. Thank you. I really appreciate it. I really appreciate this. And she couldn't get the fucking thing off. It was like one of those action movies with like the clock's going down for the bomb and I'm sitting there going lady and my head, I'm like, would you get that fucking brooch off this crazy bitches arm?

Speaker 7:          01:05:09       And I just kept looking at her right hand cause I knew at some point she was either going to gouge her eye out, just do some crazy shit. Right? Like you know that the scrap metal that these people put pickup and floss their teeth. What she was just going to stick it right in the juggler. So finally, long story short, she gets the fucking broach off and then we, we back away who's like, ah, exchange. Like we were like, wait, we gave some money, briefcase and we got the abducted kid back and we fucking walk away. And I'm like, Oh fuck. Thank God. Thank God that worked on actually walked back to the, to the brunch. All right. Walk back to the brunch and I got a fucking applause break from like all these people eating eggs benedict and eggs Florentine. It was fucking awesome.

Speaker 7:          01:05:53       I was a Goddamn hero this week. People, uh, scared. Nervous fucking dude. I'm tell you Brian, I didn't come within seven feet of this woman. I was literally, you know, you know, fucking a, the avenue out there, I'm going to say where, cause I don't need psychos. Know where the fuck I live. You know, like I'm anywhere near that level of notoriety. Uh, I was literally fucking like, she's one of that wall is over there. I'm going, hey, sweeter to people who didn't know what was going on. They probably thought it was some construction worker hitting on her look in the fucking games on there. So, uh, yeah, that was my week. That was my weak people. I got my pass, my fucking driver's test, and I was at God damn hero. Huh? What did you do this week? You know what that reminds me of? What was that shitty action movie that ended that way?

Speaker 7:          01:06:40       That started that emaciated bitch? That fucking, uh, uh, I was going to say, Brian Johnson. Brad Pitt's dating. What's her name? Natasha or wrote Robin Linskey. She's got one of those. I'm a hot girl names. What's her name? Angelina. You ever seen a fucking ugly girl named Angelina? Natasha. Brooke. That's like a hell of a gamble. You just know your daughter is, is his fucking is going to be hot. Right? And she's going to go for the money. She's going for the gold. So, uh, yeah. What, what was that movie? She did what? She was the assassin and the whole movie was kind of okay. And then the movie ends with Blahblahblah and then ends. He goes, what the fuck did you do today? Yeah, no, no, not Mrs Mr. Smith. That was the one after that. Morgan Freeman was in it and they, they stayed shoot the gun in the fucking bullet would, would go, oh, this is driving everybody on the podcast.

Speaker 7:          01:07:30       And that's because they know the name of it. Well, the movie basically ends. He goes, what the fuck did you do today? I mean, they got pissed. Hi, watched the mediocre movie. I say Meteoric York. Mediocre. All right, whatever. Go fuck yourselves. Okay, this is a what, 35 minutes, then 35 minutes. And this is going to be, like I said, it's gonna be a DVD extra. And if you're watching this, I probably should've said this earlier. Maybe we'll do it in the wraparounds not to talk shop. I was going to say, where the fuck you can go see this, get this podcast. Um, but here's something new for some of you who have actually found my podcast, which I love at this point, to actually find my podcast. It's like a fucking test, really weeding out the computer illiterate, um, of which I probably couldn't even find my own podcast unless I, uh, if I didn't do it anyways, we have a new fan page.

Speaker 7:          01:08:15       Uh, it's, it's www.thempodcast.com, www.capital letters, m, m p and then all lowercase podcast.com. Uh, I explained that bad the MMP or all capital letters. All right. Fuck you. Www dot the [inaudible] podcast.com. Go there. Um, I definitely think there'll be some pictures of Leonardo Dicaprio. I make references to shit. Sometimes Times people don't know what it is. The movie that I couldn't remember the name of. It's driving you nuts that will be up there. Uh, and whatever else I fucking talked about. And as there's youtube videos and all that type of shit, um, of which this week, you know what? I don't have any youtube videos. I got to admit I was hardcore studying for this impossibly difficult, um, test. What else do I got? You want me to move again so we can have something different? Where else would I go? I went from the, the, the, the, the sofa.

Speaker 7:          01:09:11       Well, I was going to go into another room, but I'm so paranoid then I'm going to wear, I got to stand up here for a second. Maybe it be, I'll be standing up here. Can you get that? Can you get that with the camera? Is this interesting to your people at all? Oh, here's one for you. The conspiracy theory. Somebody sent me something from, uh, from England. All right. Because the 14 listeners of my podcast of I'm going international with my failure, um, was saying that in England they're actually experimenting with, um, using satellite to catch speeders satellite technology to catch speeders. Can you fucking believe that? Somewhere in the middle of that, I just lost all outrage. I knew I was fucking pissed. I stood up and I just realized I was really hungry. That's, that's one of those things that you get, you got to understand when you're starving to death.

Speaker 7:          01:10:03       If you sit down, it doesn't feel as bad. You know, if you ever watch those things when Sally Struthers back in the day used to be next to those starving kids and what we just see, they were always sitting down or laying down and you think it's because they're weak. It isn't. They could stand up if they wanted to, but you just feel hungry. There's something about your pancreas sort of fills up that spot. Oh fuck you. I know. I don't know what I'm talking about. Um, all right, let's skip back to conspiracy theories. Here's a conspiracy theory. Somebody sent me this week, somebody sent me this this week, my podcast in my lap, low level of radiation going into my nuts right now. You know what? They should start, they should make the bottom like give you some sort of optional lead suit with these things. You know, I think that would be a great thing of Billy Mills was still alive. If you could make like some sort of cell phone led helmet that comes in like three different colors, a manly color color, a a womanly color, and then a pattern. There you go. And then when it becomes huge, then you start putting sport logos on it. Then they do that with the snuggie. Then you could get like a red skin snuggie for all those people who get cold while watching football.

Speaker 7:          01:11:14       Dude, I'm telling you man, that's how I'm going to parachute out of this fucking business. I got to come up with some bullshit and just, you know, I scream all the time when I do my jokes. I don't know how, I don't know if you've ever noticed this Brian, but I don't know how to write a joke. So when I do is I say fuck a lot and I just scream it, you know? And then the, the reverb of me yelling, you can't hear that. There was no laughter afterwards. So I already know how to do the Billy Mays thing. So all we can do is just come up with some hunk of shit.

Speaker 8:          01:11:38       Old People, old people. That's where you got to go.

Speaker 7:          01:11:41       Do you ever go on the can kill me? When I went to fucking Dwayne Reed one time and I saw that booster chair for the toilet seat, I was just like, fuck,

Speaker 8:          01:11:50       that's brilliant. Yeah. 20 million later that said, people, you start in a booster chair and you ended a booster chair. If you're lucky, if you don't end in a booster chair, that means you got hit by a bus and what would you rather do? Here's a question for you. Would you rather get hit by a bus at 42 bang and some of the hot ass hardest ass on the planet, you know, or would you rather live to be 70 boost to chair on the toilet? You know, I've talked about this before, right? Your old balls hanging in the toilet water. That's why they have the booster chairs. So you're nuts on hit the water. Oh my God. Is it the eighties again?

Speaker 9:          01:12:30       So do we fucking booze to cheers.

Speaker 8:          01:12:33       Um, yeah, this is the podcast. Let's get onto the next thing. Uh, all right. That was me giving you a little button there. This is the podcast and we're out. All right, conspiracy the week. Bill, you often talk about conspiracies. Yes I do. And this may or may not fall into that category, but it definitely pisses me off. I love this guy already. I don't know if this is a conspiracy, but if fucking pisses me off eyeball to eyeball with you so far, buddy. All right. I get my cable and Internet service bundled together from Time Warner last month with my bill, I got an a in insert stating that they were modifying their privacy policy. Basically it states timewarner reserves the right to distribute my internet content with or without my consent. From my understanding, this could mean anything from the searches I requested from Google to the websites I have been to. What rights do we have in this country anymore? Just venting. All right, dude. Yeah, absolutely. Basically what they've been doing the

Speaker 7:          01:13:35       entire fucking time since the beginning of the Internet is now becoming legal. So for all you people out there who always thought like, uh, like I love when you watch like those, those talk shows and they talk about, um,

Speaker 8:          01:13:48       sexting like where you're, you're, you're text messaging, you know,

Speaker 7:          01:13:53       I'm going to fuck you from behind whatever. Why that's sexy. I even though idea, you know, do you think their thumbs tremble but whatever, I'm not going to judge or like they, they talk about Skype sex and there'll be like, why do these people do this? Why would somebody who had never done, they always bring a psychologists on, right? And always have a beard. So you know that they majored in psychology, right? And then they go, they always say the same shit and there'll be just like, well, it's the, uh, anonymity of it. They, they feel anonymous. And, and in that situation, they, they, they, they, they do things that they normally wouldn't done. Well, first of all, people, it's not anonymous. You had dumb fucks. It isn't, they just saying it's anonymous. They just sent it. We don't think that they're building a file on you.

Speaker 7:          01:14:39       So all these fucking morons who've lived the life of the straight and narrow get on Skype and they stick their junk right in the camera. You're an idiot. You're done. You're already done. Because they, they're, they're building robots right now to re to fucking replace all of us. And what did you then, but they're going to keep some of us because somebody got an oil. They're fucking robot joints. And what did you do? You stuck your Dick in the camera yet you're processed. It's over. It's over. You got to take the driver's test. I wouldn't even find, won't even study. You're fucking finish. You're going to get processed just like those people and that fucking movie with that guy just died. I can never remember the name. What's the name of the, Patrick Swayze was in it. Blood force. Thunder. New America. What the fuck was it called?

Speaker 7:          01:15:28       He'll come. The Russians pissing the radiator. All that. All that hatred is gonna. Gonna gonna eat you up. Keeps me warm. Remember that Ed Begley Jr was in it. No, he wasn't the fucking, uh, the kid who was in Seoul, man was in it. And he shot his friend avenge me. C'Mon Red Dawn. Jesus Christ. Brian, you're a fucking director. Do you get that man? When you get let you live that panic, that brain panic. Okay. He just got it. Okay, good. I thought it was only me. Uh, yeah, absolutely. No, this people, if you want to watch porn like porn, the porn industry is fucking is going through what the music industry is going through right now where all of a sudden the shit just became free. All right? So now everybody's fucking whacking off on the Internet thinking nobody's watching what? You're fucking rubbing your shit out too.

Speaker 7:          01:16:15       They're all watching and they're building a fucking file. All right. You think already, haven't you noticed why the president's keep getting worse and worse and they keep fucking getting on their knees and blowing the banks more and more? It's because of the Internet. All they got to do is break out their internet file and show him some of the shit that they know that they jerked off to. When it's fights over, it's fucking over. You got to do everything that they're gonna say they're gonna exposure. They don't even need to take you to Dallas anymore. That's old school. That's why Kennedy got shot in the head. If there was an internet, he'd still be walking around talking right now, cutting the ribbon at his fucking library, shitting his pants. He wouldn't give the eulogy at Fed head Ted's fucking funeral. Um, yeah. So that's, that's what I'm saying. Okay. If you want to, if you want to jerk off to something freaky, I would say go to a porn store and just deal with the fact that the guy behind the counter is going to know what you got. Pay Cash

Speaker 8:          01:17:10       and walk away. It's a done deal. But if you're going to go on the Internet and do some of the shit that you're doing, all you can hope now is that you're going to get lost in the shuffle. Actually. You can continue to do what you're doing as long as you never tried to effect. If you never try to effectively effect change, you know what I mean? That's, that's when they break out your Internet file. Other than that, it just goes on a fucking database. But the second you start a movement going, you know what, dude, I'm sick of paying 25 bucks in my first bag when I get on a plane. If you get enough people behind you, United will not go to Time Warner and be like, yeah, Russell Johnson. Yeah, open his file. What does he jerk? What's the most fucked up thing? He's joking. That is the end of the movement. Present Fox News will get it and they'll just be, it turns out Russell Johnson jerked off to a trainee and a magic last week. This was the guy who is going to lead us. Oh, don't get me wrong. I'm doing Glenn Beck.

Speaker 7:          01:18:12       All right, let me, Oh that fucking guy. Jesus Christ. I respect those guys cause they were in show business. I just wish maybe, maybe they can't admit that they're in show business. It's like wrestling. For the longest time they couldn't say that it was fake, but now you know at some point come on, just say, look, we're doing fake news. We know, we know who's going to win. In the end of this shit. Oh No, it's all horrible. All right, well, how much time are we up to him? 46 fucking minutes. For those of you at home, I do 50 minutes every week. It's a free fucking podcast. Admitted. You don't like your job. Maybe you don't like your wife. Maybe you don't like yourself. You need a laugh on a Monday. I do this for free. Out of the goodness of my heart. See that Brian? I've been a hero every fucking Monday. Maybe that's what inspired me.

Speaker 7:          01:18:56       You know what? It takes it away that you could tell that I'm an I'm a piece of shit. Because if I was a true fucking heroin, I wouldn't have told you that story. I wouldn't have brought it up on the podcast. It's like a heathen. I'm praying in public right now. I should have just done some heroic shit and walked away. That's when you're bad ass right? Explosion. You don't even look at it. That's what I should've done and I didn't. You know why? Because I'm a fucking coward and I'm fucking blown away by the fact that I, you know, Bill, it was a check you as soon as funny as she weighed like 70 pounds. That's the funny thing. But she was crazy. That's, that's mental steroids. When you crazy, they can all of a sudden pick you up. Do the airplane spin like

Speaker 8:          01:19:34       sergeant slaughter. Did he do that? He didn't do that. Did he? He had the fucking Cobra Clutch. All right, let's wrap this podcast up with um,

Speaker 7:          01:19:41       the overrated underrated segment and this segment is people send in stuff that they feel is overrated or underrated. They make a list. I comment on it and hopefully, hopefully it's hilarious. I will tell you what his fucking overrated is buying a God damn shoe rack. I, you like me or you to the point where your feet have stopped growing. You don't throw out your fucking sneakers and you got 58 of them and you got shoes and he got boots and all that type of crap. I got all of that shit and they were filling up my fucking closet and I'm like, all right, I got to get one of those shoe racks. Okay, but I need one that can hold a bunch of shoes. Don't look at the picture on the outside of the box because they put fucking doll shoes on those goddamn racks and it looks like you can easily fit three, four pairs of breasts and then you come home one pair of timberlands and a fucking flip flop. And that's a whole level.

Speaker 7:          01:20:35       Then you can't take it back and says whole fucking thing annoyed me. That's overrated. Overrated is doing that. Just leave his sneakers on the fucking floor. You know what? Why don't you go down to fucking, uh, I was gonna say Grossman's go down to uh, the, the, the Home Depot and build your own shoe rack for a fucking adult. I'm literally sweating in my own apartment here. Might me, am I going to be sweaty on the podcast? The Comey. Who is that cruises guy for those people at home? Huh? Who is that guy? Remember that coach? I don't remember his coach either, but he coached the team out in Vegas. Some of the teeth. It was like an old Elmer Fudd like if Elmer Fudd Fuck Don Zimmer. That's what he looked like. Jesus. That was insulting. All right, here's one from somebody underrated. Uh, Quincy, the show, Quincy, the Fonz and Sam Malone.

Speaker 7:          01:21:18       Get all the credit for getting the ladies. But Quincy got just as much as any of them. It seemed like he had a different chicken is on his houseboat. Every episode. He was basically a silent assassin. The best part of it is that he used the word broad to refer to the ladies. Those were different times. They really were. They really were. Jack Klugman is Quincy. That was like a, that was the end of an era. Remember that Brian, he ever hit me like Yo, when we were growing up, they take the casting couch when guys ran this fucking business and now look, you know what's funny is they thought if, if they, if the ladies, if they ran it, that there would be, it would be better, but it isn't. It's just is unbalanced. The other fucking direction. Now you've got a bunch of pussies on TV who are afraid of their wives.

Speaker 7:          01:22:05       You know, Ralph Kramden used to threatened every week. That's what I loved about that show because they still showed them being a moron, but he's still physically intimidator, you know, like Larry Johnson, he had that power forward respect on that show. That's all I'm looking for. Just show a guy in a relationship was getting a little bit of fucking respect, you know? All right, I'm going over my time here. The last thing we're going to talk about his bad covers. I talk last week, uh, somebody, Mary j Blige did a cover of a, a stairway to heaven and a whole lot of love and it wasn't bad, but you know what I mean? I Dunno. It's just one of those things where this some, some music, it's just sacred. It's sacred to you. So no matter how talented somebody is, uh, you're like, what the fuck? So I was talking to last really bad cover that I heard that it just really just annoyed the shit on me.

Speaker 7:          01:23:00       Well, actually I was in a gym and somebody had remixed Ah, Shit. Did the remix of a sympathy for the devil by the rolling stones. You know, and I'm gonna go out on a limb. I think Mick Keith and the guy, I think they got it right the first fucking time. These fucking assholes, first of all, first thing they do is they edit out the guitar solo. Okay? Take Keith Guitar Solo out. And then at one point literally dropped out everything other than Mick, Mick Jagger's voice, and then had some new updated like, like a Casio drum beat underneath it. It was just, ah, it's just a fucking worst Scott Damn Song I've ever heard. Jesus Christ bill. How did I not make that funny? I really bombed with that. Like I started off, it was decent. I got lost in the middle of it, you know, I got freaked out.

Speaker 7:          01:23:46       I was like, what if Mary j actually buys this fucking DVD? I went to that arrogance space. You know what it was. You know what happened there, Brian? I cared. I cared, and the whole fucking thing went away. All right, let's see. Hit last bad cover. Um, this here's one from somebody, and I know this, this, this, this. Actually the segment is starting to blow up. I just didn't have time to put everybody, so don't, uh, everybody's bad covers on there. I want to read these because you guys really came up with some great ones this week. Um, here's when he says, all right, this, the cover, the cover song that pissed me off the most has to be slash in Fergie's slash in Fergie from the black ips featuring that dude from Cypress Hill there they actually redid paradise city. And uh, right there I was immediately going, oh no, oh no.

Speaker 7:          01:24:40       And he says all that energy and swagger on the of the original, everything that made that song a bonafide classic is ruined in this version. Anyone that really holds up slash is a god and trashes axel cannot honestly sit there and tell me that this song does more to ruin guns and roses name than the Chinese democracy. What a horrible, infuriating idea. Please, please give this song. That's the treatment it deserves on your podcast. I got to admit, I am a fucking huge is how big a fan of I am of slash like I was right with them slash a snake pit. I saw velvet revolver, anything he does, I will go fucking see. I remember I saw Joe Perry project and he showed up and he played with the band. It was fucking awesome. I love slash but I got to tell you this one that I'm not trashing slash year because even Dinero has made some bad fucking movies. But uh, here it is. You guys want to hear a little, I'll, I'll play just a little bit of this and I'm actually not worry about slash thing this cause we won't have the rights to play this on the DVD. So here you go. Um, I think it's been a really nice podcast this week. Um, and you should appreciate it. Especially a free podcast from a hero such as myself.

Speaker 7:          01:25:52       I just like saying it. It's so fucking annoying. Hey, what do you do? Well, I'm a comedian and also I'm a hero. I'm a fucking hero. Uh, as long as they're crazy women and they weigh less than 70 pounds, I am right there to do my duty as, as, as a, as a standup citizen. So here it is everybody. Everybody have a great week. Thanks for listening to the podcast and we're going to close out with the Paradise City 2.0, I'll play a little bit of this shit. Uh, this is slash Fergie from the black eyed peas and that guy from Cypress Hill, you know the, the fucking trio that we've all been waiting for for years. They finally came together and here's what it sounds like, dude. What the fuck are ready? What the fuck already?

Speaker 4:          01:26:42       [inaudible]

Speaker 7:          01:26:58       right here. You going? Okay, maybe they're going to save it. Maybe they're going to save it. Ah, AH, no. Oh my God. Oh my God. Oh my God, Dude. You ever get like fucking embarrassed for somebody else? What the fuck? You know? Hey, I hate, I can't see why to rappers always have to let you know who the fuck is in the building. I can read the liner notes. We'd go at slaves in the, Ha. I know he wrote it.

Speaker 7:          01:27:36       The Duchess Fergie. Ah, that, that, that is, yeah. That one didn't bug me as much as led Zeppelin. I have to admit like, cause when, when guns and roses, when they came out, I was like 1920 already realized I could see myself becoming a loser. It's sent music that you love when you had hope, you know, speaking of which is one for my, my child. Did I hope for a speedy recover for our Bret Michaels man. Seriously, man, I know a lot of people, uh, may, may or may not like fucking poison, whatever you've got to hand to the guy that he stuck around for 25 fucking years and dies in the hospital right now. So I hope that guy, uh, comes out better than fucking ever. And uh, that's it. See, that's what a hero does. He brings it around to a nice moment. That's the, uh, that's a podcast for this week. Please tune in next week. Please keep all the, um, the questions, comments and all that stuff coming. I really appreciate it. Have a great week and a, that's it. Take it easy.
