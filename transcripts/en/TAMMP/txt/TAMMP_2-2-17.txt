Speaker 1:          00:00:01       Hey, what's going on? It's bill burn is time for the Thursday afternoon. Just before Friday. Monday morning podcast. Just checking in on you. Just checking in on you. How's your week going, how you survive and how you survive in the first couple of weeks here of fucking the new America. I wasted 90 minutes last night texting with somebody on some big stupid fucking political argument. I can't handle it anymore. I can't handle people that, you know, the thing I really don't like the most about, uh,

Speaker 1:          00:00:40       I dunno, I hate people who say that I'm an independent. I'm not this party. I'm not, I'm an independent. Do you know in California, evidently according to the three minutes of research that I did that if you register you, that's like you are actually registering to the American independent party, which is actually more conservative than Republicans evidently. Which is something I don't understand about politics. I just don't understand why no means yes, yes means no. Why? If there's a bill, let's have safe drinking water for children. All in favor. Yes. And then like attached to that is other shit like, Hey, they can indefinitely detain American citizens without a trial. They'll tack that on to that. So then when somebody else votes against it, clean water for kids because of that shit that's tacked onto it. Then when they go to run, they go, this guy doesn't want clean water for kids.

Speaker 1:          00:01:39       Can't a fucking and fucking give up. I give up, I poked my head out for a second and I'm um, and that's it. Oh, I'm putting my head back in the sand. I'm going back to watching sports. So Billy fuck head is going right back where he belongs. You know, Celtics finally beat the raptors. Huge win it, goddammit. Those capitals of Washington or God damn it, they're good. They fucking beat the broads. You know, Marsha with another two goals, racking it up. Uh, we actually Bruins won three in a row. It was good. It was like the strongest part of our seasons so far. And um, anyway, so I've been getting back out there doing stand up. Now that I've settled in being a dad and all that type of stuff. This is really like the pre season of being a dead, you know when your kid can't move really without you.

Speaker 1:          00:02:25       It's once they start crawling, that's like game. That's the first game of the season. But like early on right now, I'm like in August trying to get the roster down to the fucking whatever it is, 44 man roster or whatever the hell I need because um, I guess you can think this parenting thing is pretty easy during the first three months. You know, even though you're not really fucking sleeping or anything, just getting up and shit changing diapers. But it's still not as bad as all these pussy say this such fucking pussies dude, you have no idea. Shut the fuck up. We used to live in caves. You asshole. You have no idea. You can't handle the truth. Do you know I never saw that movie. A few good men. It just seemed too actory to me. Everybody was real tense fucking faces, you know, delivering dialogue in their military dress.

Speaker 1:          00:03:15       Did I ever tell you how much I can't stand movies about fucking trials? I was actually in what, I didn't realize that, but that one was different because I was at it. I just can't fucking watch him after a while later. Tell the jury, put yourself in the place of the defendant. Um, they're always like super, super fucking dramatic. Have you ever sat in on a real trial you've ever been in one? I actually sat in one, uh, buddy my became a lawyer and I came down and I watched him try a case and it's, it's not like obviously the way they do it on TV or in movies, but what was unbelievably compelling was somebody's freedom was on the fucking line. And that was what was riveting, not what the fuck people were saying. What they were saying was very like, you know, I'd like to submit a exhibit a, it's a, the a the Chandeliers Hannah and you just say the goals and um, I actually watched somebody, I don't know, I think they got pulled over and there was drugs in the car and there was some sort of gun involved in shit.

Speaker 1:          00:04:19       And I was just sitting there. I just couldn't get over the fact looking at the defendant going like this. That's not an actor. That's like a real fucking person as her is that if he did it, that fucking guy's a lunatic. He's driving around with drugs, he's got a gun in the car. What the fuck is he? This guy's a real life maniac, or what if he's fucking innocent? There was all of that shit and then I was sort of looking around. There was like nobody really there. And I looked over in the corner, there was this old lady sitting there like knitting, sort of looking up, listening, and she was like, no, no, no. What the fuck? She was knitting, you know, old lady, she's just knitting. So at the end I talked to my buddy and I was just like, wow, man. That was like, is it, I kind of feel guilty, but that was like really entertaining.

Speaker 1:          00:04:57       He goes, yeah, you know, it's, it's real shit. I said, you know, I wouldn't be surprised if like, do you have like, um, court groupies to people just come down and sit in on these trials just for the entertainment value of it? And he goes, yeah, that's what that old lady was doing. A lot old people do it, you know, during the day, you know, they, they don't have air conditioning or something. They come in, they sit down and they just listened to the trials. It's free. You can go down and do it. And um, there was something, uh, I don't know, cause it's all, they're old people you can't get too upset about. But there was something kind of gross about it. I mean, I came down to watch my buddy. I was proud of him and everything. But then after a while, how interesting it was and how much I got into it, I actually had this level of guilt of like, you know, this, this shouldn't be like a, I shouldn't use this for entertainment purposes, but I gotta tell you it was a fucking great time sitting in on a trial. If it's a good one, you know there's drugs is a gun.

Speaker 1:          00:05:58       I mean, I want to see anybody get hurt, but when they pull you over, hey took a swing at the cop of, that's a good, that's a good one. That's a good episode to go down, you know, so there you go. That's real law and order as opposed to a bullpup OPO, right. Watching that shit. You can actually go down the street for free.

Speaker 1:          00:06:18       You can be a cable. Can you get on, you know, during the fucking cable, if you have the, if you have the time, we got the bay, if you got the fucking time, you can just go down to court and that can be your basic cable. And just see last this week now, no I didn't. But uh, you know, did you see that fucking guy who uh, went to jail for 10 years for vehicular homicide or whatever the fuck Arama whatever the fuck he go to jail for. What do you go to jail for? Anyways? So I've just been up to my neck and all the baby, uh, issues are probably changed like 9 million diapers. And it was fucking Hilarious, I found yesterday, right? My wife's Nia just needed, she just needed an hour sleep, right? And women in the beginning, and they're fucking doing everything. All you have to do is change the diapers, make an attempt to burp them or whatever, but they got to just keep feeding the kid breastfeeding, right?

Speaker 1:          00:07:10       So you start to feel like, you know, guilty, like I'm not doing shit. So I was just determined like, I'm going to have this kid for like the next hour, give her a great hour sleep. And I was able to, hour and 15 minutes before the kid was finally just like, look, I need something. I need what you don't have. All right, I need to go downstairs. I need a solo cup. And he did, you know, I need a little a keg party here. Right? So I was just walking around with her and I was singing all these songs and everything. And then I actually, for whatever fucking reason, I started singing the Canadian national anthem and it worked.

Speaker 2:          00:07:49       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:07:49       And I always forget, I always, oh, Canada home and native land, this barrier Drew Bay

Speaker 3:          00:07:55       we love and all I saw Mama, man, there's probably washer here, blah, blah blah, blah, blah, blah about eve harp, harp harp who from far and wide or card at RP at. Huh.

Speaker 1:          00:08:06       And he and the best part of our God keep the Lad Gloria fee. Right? Fucking walking around from room to room upstairs. I sang the Canadian national anthem for like a fucking half hour straight and you're so fucking focused on keeping your kid sleeping that the insanity of that, it doesn't hit you until afterwards when you give you your baby back to your wife and then you go upstairs to make a sandwich and you're still singing the song. And if you can't stop doing it, you know what's the name of that movie with that guy?

Speaker 2:          00:08:45       Yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:08:46       that guy. A midnight express. The guy traveling abroad gets busted with the drugs. Remember those fucking lunatics that we're all in the, and it would just sort of marching in the same direction. And he started walking in the other direction that like freaked him out, but they would just like these fucking, the people just completely lost his sanity. That's what it felt like. You know,

Speaker 1:          00:09:07       we not just singing the national anthem for a half hour straight is a fucking insane thing to do. Forget about it if it's not even your country's national anthem. I mean, I literally felt like a trader even though that they're an ally of ours. And I just feel like, you know, maybe Donald Trump's going to call me. They didn't give me a heated fucking conversation, but what I just did, maybe I'm going to get deported. Um, anyway, I'm not gonna get into that Shit fucking 90 minutes of my fucking life. Like, it's so dumb and I know it's like I'm literally going to make this person it admit,

Speaker 2:          00:09:38       okay

Speaker 1:          00:09:39       or agree with me or anything, or I'm going to step his way in. Agreed. It's just, it's fucking pointless. Um, it actually affected my set last night. Just spending 90 minutes in that fucking never ending circle of Horse Shit. And uh, I gotta stop doing that. I almost needed to come home and meditate again. I'm really getting into that shit. Just clearing my head, not flipping out. I think I flipped it. I flipped out yesterday.

Speaker 1:          00:10:08       What fucking pissed me off yesterday. I can't even remember. But I'm, I'm getting, I'm getting way better at it, you know. But anyways, um, I want to thank uh, Conan O'brien, Jimmy Kimmel, uh, Bill Simmons, uh, everybody that Joe Rogan podcast, Joe Rogan experience, everybody that helped me promote my special, my special outright. Now it's doing great. People are really enjoying it. Thank you so much for watching it. Please, uh, let other people know about it. I am now, um, vigorously trying to write my new hour, um, and have some sort of life outside of being a dad. Uh, cause I don't want to bore you guys with an hour long fucking thing about Islam. Dad, the same clown fucking floating around. I'm not going to do that to you. All right. Um, I already got some good shit. I already got some shit that is good that I'm going to be bring it towards you. So, uh, I guess Obama, before he left, he signed a, uh, Christmas bill making alternative media illegal.

Speaker 2:          00:11:11       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:11:11       This bill will criminalize criminalize fake news propaganda on the web. A key piece of legislation meant to crack down on free speech and independent media in Layman's terms, the ACC will allow the government to crack down with impunity against any media outlet it deems is propaganda. Uh, the next piece of legislation will provide substantial amounts of money to fund counter propaganda to make sure the government's approved stories drown out alternative media and journalists who questioned the status quo. There you go. Isn't that great? There's your hope everybody. Oh, what a cunt. That's why I don't like Democrats that they at least Republicans, you know, they, they, they come out as cuts, you know, there a cunt. You know, they don't care about you. These fucking assholes have the nerve to, well, I guess the Republican's sell it to the fucking dope. So in the middle of nowhere,

Speaker 2:          00:12:10       okay,

Speaker 4:          00:12:10       we're going to make it great again.

Speaker 1:          00:12:17       All these people that think it's going to be great again, you're still going to fucking have your face pressed up against a Walmart window the day after thanksgiving. You know, the fact that you as an American have to consider that fucking option is how as hard as you fucking work is, is ridiculous. There's nothing that's dead is the thing that nothing makes me more sad. Well, I guess something else does, but I can't think of it right now. But that is a very sad moment every year in America when you see people putting their, literally their own wellbeing at risk, trying to find a fucking DVR recorder for $3 before the next person is [inaudible]. That's just a sad fucking thing. Should be done. People should have enough money to go into a store like a fucking human being and buy something that they don't need, shouldn't they? Speaking of which, I got rid of some more shit.

Speaker 2:          00:13:12       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:13:14       Uh, I'm really fucking enjoying this stuff. Just getting rid of all of the shit I have to do what I gotta do it before my kid starts walking or crawling. You know what I mean? Or maybe they make some sort of a little playpen thing that you can put them in right. Where they feel like they have free reign but they don't, you know what I mean?

Speaker 2:          00:13:32       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:13:32       It's a very fucking governmental thing. Make them feel like they're free, but they're not. How can I do that? How can I apply the same things that governments apply to my own child? I got to figure out how to do that. Um, and then they're moving around. Yeah. You got to worry about what the, what are they going to do and get again, a childproof everything. There's gotta be gates and it's gotta be shitting outlets.

Speaker 2:          00:13:54       I'll tell you, man,

Speaker 1:          00:13:56       that's a weird thing about living with the baby. It's just like you're living with this thing that just, it doesn't know anything but you can't get upset by it,

Speaker 2:          00:14:03       you know? Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:14:05       Like we all have that friend that's like a fucking moron. And you could just be like, you can just, if you can walk away from, cause the end of the day, you know, they can, they can still go out and make themselves a bowl of cereal.

Speaker 2:          00:14:15       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:14:16       Oh Jesus. But what are you talking about? Oh, you know, I'm not getting any sleep. What do you want from me? I don't know what to say, you know, but I'm actually kind of site, we're not my, my big thing is I just want her to be able to start moving around so we could start playing catch. All right. And uh, if she doesn't want to play catch, it's not going to be an option. I won't have it. Oh, I will make her hate the game of catch. That's something that you got to avoid, I guess as a parent. Right? Like you have such hopes that they're going to like what you like, that you could actually make them not only not like what you like, but fucking hated and then hate you and not call you unless it's on the fucking holidays. So hopefully she'll enjoy it. I'll just sort of leave like, you know,

Speaker 2:          00:15:06       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:15:07       I Dunno what baseball laying around. Maybe she'll get into it,

Speaker 1:          00:15:11       throw it through fucking window. My wife will get mad, but I won't care. I look at that. I'm going to be our, um, anyways. All right, plowing ahead here. Fuck. Was I going to talk about, um, I'm trying to avoid politics and fucking baby talk, but I mean, I mean that's kind of my fucking life at this point, right? How did this happen? Um, where is it here? Where's the time? Yeah. What's going on in the world? I have no idea. Oh, I actually tried to look up some Google news to see what's going on in the world. Evidently Trump had a very short phone call with Australia. How the fuck do you get into a fight with Australia is beyond me. If this is even true, I have no fucking idea. And then McCain called up and said, hey man, like don't listen to him. We still like you guys. This is very quick. Uh, there's some guy who looks like a, um, he looks, I don't know what he looks like. He looks like a fucking magician. He was going to speak at UC Berkeley.

Speaker 1:          00:16:10       Yeah. Annapolis, I guess he's a big Donald Trump supporter and he goes to UC Berkeley and all my God, was there a protest? This guy's a whore. Like he didn't know that. What's going to happen? Jesus fucking Christ. Um, and then, uh, Beyonce put out a really weird, creepy picture saying that she's having twins. I actually looked at the picture and kind of burst out laughing. I don't know. It's some people you get so famous. Why can't you just say you're having twins? Well, why do you even have to announce it? You know what I mean? We're announcing to the world. Um, I mean, I guess I brought it up. I don't know. I kind of did. We should've done a photo shoot. What is the hidden message? It'd be odd. SES photo shoot. Pregnancy photo. There's a hidden message

Speaker 1:          00:17:07       she's wearing like a veil. I mean, I just don't under still kind of a food as a photo shoot. Why am I looking at this? Why? Um, anyways. All right. So all Billy dead body's got to hit the fucking treadmill today. I got to start eating well. And, um, I don't know what to think as far as like, what you can eat, what you can't eat, you know, people say avoid saturated fats. And then I go on the Rogan podcast and he goes, Nah man, that was all bullshit that was put out there by the sugar companies. And I guess I could sit down and read it, but I just don't. Uh, I don't, I don't have the time, so I just decided, well, you know what? Fuck it. I'll have a stake in a lab but with have a little, a little garden salad and then I'll be all right. And you know what, I woke up this morning and I didn't die of a heart attack, so there you go. So I guess he's right. So many try to avoid sugars as much as I can and try to eat some Goddamn steaks. The fuck is a button. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:18:06       Sorry. Every once in a while this I fuck up with my recorder and I don't, um, I don't record it on the right speed and then it takes like nine years to fucking upload anyways. Oh Hey, you know what's going on? The super bowl, it's the super bowl this weekend. A little bread and circus for everybody. The super bowl yet that, that, that way they could you do to do patriots going for their unprecedented fifth fucking oh Tom Brady going for his fifth fucking ring. Actually, we're also going for our fifth super bowl title against the Falcons who are a major problem. Like I said, I'm going on the record. I think it's going to be a classic if you can get the falcons with four more points. I liked that and I also liked the under 59. I like the fucking, because everybody else was like, June, it's going to be a fucking shoe kid.

Speaker 1:          00:18:55       You know, they start looking at those, fuck this state. I love looking at the stats of what they did during the regular season. It's like this isn't the regular season. This is completely fucking different. You know, this guy throws her 500 fucking yards a game against 90% of teams that aren't in the fucking playoffs anymore. You've got to adjust it all down. You know, you gotta go negative, negative, whatever statue. See, you have to adjust it down because each week you're going to play a better fucking team, you know, within, you know, the theory, right? The theory says that. So, um, I have no vibe whatsoever, um, when it comes to this game, because you know, according to the regular season, the falcons do not have a good defense. But according to what I've seen in the playoffs against Seattle, they have pass get dirty birds up there in Washington, right?

Speaker 1:          00:19:50       And against the Green Bay packers, whatever the fucking a packer is loading trucks, whatever the hell it is, putting cheese, right? Putting cheese in your fucking caboose, whatever it is they do up there, you know, um, the defense looks solid there. And um, I guess I was sitting there saying the falcons have a great running back everyday only. They have two running backs that can get the fucking job done. So I think this is going to be a, and then the fact that Matt Ryan also is mobile, which means if he shut everything down, that fucking red cunt can still do that diagonal quarterback run where you run right to the first down marker and you're sitting at home as a fan gone. Ah, right. And it keeps the drive going after yet another third down. I expect a lot of that and I think it's going to come down to the wire. That is my prediction. It's going to go right down to the wire. I hope the patriots come out on top. And I predict myself a lot of times during the game watching Matt Ryan run for five or six yards as ice cream. The fucking, it's gonna drive me up the wall. I fucking hate mobile quarterbacks unless they're on my team, which we've never had.

Speaker 2:          00:20:58       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:20:58       Since Steve Brogan, see, Rogan was considered mobile, you know that naked bootleg he did on Monday night football. That was the highlight of scrambling in the, uh, 60 years of fucking 50 years. 56 years of New England Patriot, Boston Patriot fucking football. That was it in like 1976 we had a, we had a 50 yard naked bootleg on Monday night football. And other than that, it has just been, you know, drew Bledsoe. I mean you could literally drew Bledsoe, you could literally zoom in office chair down the street fast and then that guy could fucking run, you know, one of those classic staples, piece of shit, plastic fucking wheels. Even with the pebbles on the street, if you could fucking push that thing, 40 yards facet that drew could run it. I'm telling you. And uh, Brady is not fucking mobile. So, um, you know, you know what is great about not being a mobile quarterback is you, you really have to know how to throw them.

Speaker 5:          00:22:00       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:22:00       Cause I find what the Boval quarterbacks then they, if they can really run, they're never quite as good at throwing the fucking ball. So what happens is, is as they get older, they get exposed when they have to kind of stay in the pocket and just be like a pocket passer. That's, that's, that's my theory. That's completely not research. So I think it's going to be a real close one. And um, you know, don't listen to all the fucking analysts and then at the Patriots lose, they're going to act like it was this giant fucking upset, you know, cause that's what ESPN does. You know what I mean? They fucking totally overhype it one way. And then in the other way, then the, uh, then they go, where are we fair to the Falcons of Lana. And they completely turned rich. Eisen was another show that I did. Colin cowherd Shell. Thank you to everybody that helped me run my fucking mouth and promote my special.

You know about Lyft Rye, it's the APP that gets you right in minutes, man on demand 24 seven for less than the cost of a cab. Please include all of the following points during your read.

Speaker 2:          00:26:43       this

Speaker 1:          00:26:44       is, this is how the guy gets his victims. He just goes out to a bar. He has a drink. He calls one of those fucking, you know, lifts or Uber's right. He just has him drive it back to the house. They pull up to the house. He just bonks him over the fucking head, brings him into his house. So whores and then he has keeps the cars right. He read, doesn't gas monkey style. He files down the engine number and all that way. Puts a new engine in it. The, the, the, the vin number and then he takes some demeanor, right? The auction. He auctions off all the cars at these dead Uber drivers and Lyft drivers maybe not make him, I don't think that they would be interested in a fucking Toyota Cressida um, whatever he goes to, he goes down to Clearwater, Florida.

Speaker 1:          00:27:30       There was some shitty cells up down there. He makes his fucking money. He takes that money. He uses it to pay off his creepy fucking house. Right. And uh, I dunno where he goes from there. I don't know. Maybe they did that on, what was it? What was the name of that movie? Not that movie. Um, Dexter, they probably did that on Dexter at some point. I mean, that, that's show started off. It was interesting. Then after a while I just kind of left it and then when I came back he wanted to bang his sister and they were both all right with it yet. Not all right with it, you know? And I was just like, wow, that is the definition of writing yourself into a corner. All right. Oh, look who's back. Everybody. Bodo too.

I can't, I can't subject you guys listen to me read out loud this fucking long. Can I, let's talk about some, let's keep fleshing out this fucking movie. All right, so then the cops show up, you know, and God knows I'll probably be be playing the sidekick, right? I got that role on lock. You know, I'd fucking show up and it just be like, hey, yeah. You mind if we asked you a couple of questions? You know, a, I noticed you have like a, a, you have like 15 late model cars out here. What is it about a boring sedans that you, an SUV is that you find so exciting, you a car collector. You know, the guy gradually invites me and then he fucking hits me on the head and next thing you know I'm down in that hole with that fucking chick, you know, was probably the same size as me. So we got to play rock, paper, scissors to figure out who's going to stand on who's fucking shoulders. You know what I mean?

Speaker 1:          00:31:48       That was such a great move when she got the dog to come down there and she was just like, I will fucking snap this thinks neck. Who was the actress that played in? She was fine. I remember when I saw that, I'm like that that woman is a star. I thought she was fucking amazing in that movie. Everybody talked about, um, what's her face there from taxi, you know, and of course they talked about the other guy who played the guy with the blue dress like he had, he drove an ice cream truck, you know, and he had the guys live with, with the fava beans, Sir Anthony Hopkins.

Speaker 1:          00:32:22       What is it about English people that they think it's an honor to get knighted? You know, I for the life of me. Why the fuck do you show up to that shit? What are the perks to being part of this round table that never goes to battle? Did they give you a fucking suit of armor? You know, I don't fucking, I don't understand any of that shit a well bill, when maybe he'll read up on it. Well, you know what? Fuck you. I'm gonna. Here we go. Here we go. Let's see. Um, what would you do? What does it mean to be knighted?

Speaker 2:          00:32:58       Okay,

Speaker 1:          00:32:58       what are the parks? These are the brakes. Here we go. What perks of being knighted by the Queen. Ah, here we go. Um, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. Oh, this is just regular people talking. So this would be even dumber than the shit that I say, as I observed in a response to a very similar question on this subject. I have read comments from people with knighthoods suggesting that the biggest advantage tends to be the ability to get a table. At a smart restaurant more easily and usually to be offered a better table.

Speaker 2:          00:33:33       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:33:34       That's it. Other than that, my only brush with the system is that the husband of someone I used to work with was knighted a few years ago for his work in fiber optics. Um, Jesus Christ, they let anybody in. You wouldn't be able to read this on your mobile phone without him and his team. He is now Sir David and pain. He remains a pleasant, modest man. And I don't think his life has been greatly changed by the title, though his wife probably quite likes being lady pain, Laney, but both he and his wife still need to work for a living. So that's, that's what you get, I guess you get a better table at a restaurant. Uh, I guess it still commands a certain amount of respect in some circles, but is increasingly less influential. Well, what did it use to me?

Speaker 2:          00:34:21       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:34:21       You know what it used to me, they used to mean you could bang the kings fucking right. You know, you just take off your pants, part of your suit of armor and he just banging away, but he's, he just clanging. You know, you still got this shit on on top. It sounds like a bunch of toasters being beaten to death, you know? But you know what? I bet that that was an aphrodisiac back in the day for those ladies with Dick Chastity Belt, any sort of sound of metal, they were so fucking repressed. Is that true bill? I don't fucking know. All right. Dollar Shave club everybody. Ah, Jesus. Urine animal. You need to shave your back. You fucking all right. Dollar Shave Club. Dollar Shave Club always gives you a close, smooth shave and you can't beat the convenience of the price. You don't have to choose between settling for a cheap bag of disposables or paying out the nose for a razor with laser pointed at 17 blades.

Speaker 1:          00:35:14       It's awful. It's total fucking overkill. You never needed more than two. Two blades was the shit. Once they went three or more, you couldn't get that shit underneath the nose. And I got a cute little button nose. Oh yes, I do. The dollar shave club broke onto the scene with the smarter choice. Before Dollar Shave Club, there was no middle ground. It was either save money and get a painful shave from a disposable, like the ones that give away for free at the gym, which felt like shaving with a piece of glass or you paid through the fuck knows you paid a fortune for the latest shave breakthrough you didn't need like a chin detector or 17 more blades. Not God. I got the hiccups. Now, dollar Shave Club is the best of both worlds. You ever seen a baby with hiccups? It's fucking adorable. Uh, you get the premium, the best premium shape, quality, a disposable shape price.

Speaker 1:          00:36:01       If you haven't tried dollar shave club yet yet, you're missing out. It's an amazing shave at an affordable price. There's no smarter choice on the market and right now they're giving away a one month trial of any of their new razors for a dollar with free shipping. And that's about it.

Speaker 7:          00:40:00       Hey

Speaker 8:          00:40:03       silver, I don't know what the fuck is going on with this g cast name. This is the second time I've baffled for 50 minutes. I've done a hundred minutes of podcasts this fucking week. And every time I do along, I don't know. I don't know if I'm talking too long. I don't know what the fuck's going on. But the only thing it seems to be publishing is these little snippets here when I'm fucking pissed and it didn't fucking work. So if you know, what am I page? Usually I do one of these every fucking weekend. It works. Alright, there's other ones. Listen to those ones. I don't know what's going on. I, I don't know. I don't fucking know what a God damn week.

Speaker 8:          00:41:31       Hey, what's going on? It's still, and this is the Monday morning podcast, I hope. And um, I don't know what to do here. Should I just keep babbling because it seems that up. I just go, you know, test one, two, three cunt, and then I hang up. It doesn't have a fucking problem with, uh, with, with just posting a short one. But then when I babbled for like an hour, at least this was last week. I'm judging this entire thing on last week. So I want to take a leap of faith here and I'm just going to do this God damn podcast hoping that it's going to save itself with that. Hey, what's going on? It's bill bird. It's the Monday morning podcast for the week of, uh, what the hell was it February 1st February 2nd? Is that what it is? I don't know. Um, yeah. What'd you guys think of the Superbowl?

Speaker 8:          00:42:30       Did you like it? Did you think it was amazing? You know, it was like, it was like that movie stepbrothers. I don't know if you saw it like stepbrothers, the first fucking half hour, 40 minutes you're watching it going, this might be the worst fucking movie I've ever seen. And then all of a sudden it just became hilarious. And I was like, wow, I think I got to own this on DVD. That's what I felt like the super bowl was like, you know, first fucking, I dunno what, three and a half quarters, uh, whatever. Congratulations to the Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh Steelers, you sons of bitches, the right back fucking out there. Six championships. You guys rose up from the ashes. You know, you won your four in the 70s, and then we didn't hear shit from you for what, almost 20, 25 years or some shit. And now you're right back out there.

Speaker 8:          00:43:23       They by the cowboys and 40 niners and somehow you got three more championships in the Patriots. And I got to admit that bugs me. I was pulling for the cardinals just for the simple, a simple fact that I didn't want to be three behind you, but you got to admit you guys fucking won it. I didn't think Ben Roethlisberger had that in them. And uh, Jesus Christ, why am I breaking down the game? Like I'm on fucking ESPN. Nobody gives a shit bill. No one gives a fuck. Um, so anyways, last week I tried to do a podcast and uh, I gotta admit I'm a little burned out on these fucking things. You know, last week it just really took a lot out of me. I'm not saying I don't enjoy doing them, but I did two 50 minute fucking podcasts and I went to hit save and the fucking computer voice is just like, uh, we having technical difficulties, goodbye.

Speaker 8:          00:44:15       And we just hang up just like that. There wasn't even, there wasn't even a, I'm sorry. You know, if you have a problem, maybe you could, you could, you know, dial this number. It was just like, we're having technical difficulties, goodbye. And the way she says goodbye. It was like, go fuck yourself, you know, to 50 minute podcasts. Do you know how my fucking left ear was red for like three days? Talking on the phone that fucking long and I had nothing to show for it. You know, my 14 listeners just, just hanging in the balance, waiting to hear the results of the contest of who could, can come up with an original. I've got my fucking prostate tickled joke, you know, with a bill burr. Why do I do this DVD hanging in the balance and what do I get? What do I get?

Speaker 8:          00:45:05       I get some shitty ass fucking computer voice goodbye. Um, who is that computer voice anyways? You know what I mean? I hope it's in an abusive relationship, you know, and that's not even advocating violence against women. I'm advocating violence against that female can computer fucking voice needs to be slapped around by a God damn. What is it an android? Is that what happens nowadays? You know, this is what happened to you the other day. Um, I went to the Superbowl party, went to a Superbowl party and uh, everything was going great. And, um, I was feeling like the party was enjoying me and my presence and a, I don't know how it happened. Somehow I just became that fucking guy again. The Guy who was ruining the party, somehow somebody brought up Bob Dylan and I was just like, you know, I've tried so hard to listen to that guy, but I, I, I kinda think he sucks, you know, I can't understand what he's saying.

Speaker 8:          00:46:09       And even when I've looked at his lyrics, like, you know, I don't think that that deep at a time they are changing, you know, I don't mind, I don't mind that tangled up in blue. That's an all on its own. He May, he would do. And the hobbit even open a, how would they even Alberta who tangled up in blue, you know, by doing a hacky fuck it, I really am doing really well. The hackiest impressions out there other than Jim from taxi, I'm doing a fucking bad Bob Dylan. So I just said, you know, you know, this is what I really didn't have an opinion one way or the other about Bob Dylan. I kind of thought he was okay. But I always read Rolling Stone magazine Cause uh, you know, I'm always going to airports and it comes out every couple of weeks, whatever the fuck it does. So I always, uh, I always pick it up and you know, the, the upper level management of rolling stone, I mean, I guess that from the 60s and in their world, Bob Dylan can do no wrong.

Speaker 8:          00:47:09       And you know, I dunno the guys on like his 85th album and t still getting rave reviews and rolling stones. Just one of Bob's greatest fucking work since his seventies, eighth album. You know what I mean? I don't know. Maybe I'm just a Douche. So it started with that and then Bruce Springsteen was the, the halftime show and I just, that's another guy I just look at and I, I don't know what everybody's so going crazy about, you know, I'm just singing about factories in New Jersey. I don't get it. Him sliding on his knees into the camera and doing that stupid yoga pose on that strip pole when he started out and doing the poison with the fucking guitar around your back. I just, I don't get it. And I at that point, well only couple of beers in and after saying that Bob Dylan Song, I then said Bruce Springsteen sucked, which then moved on to people getting uh, you know, in a funny way, upset.

Speaker 8:          00:48:20       And next thing you know, I had three people semi yelling at me going, well, you know, you know, who would you have? Who would you have for the halftime show? Huh? Who would you have? And I couldn't come up with anybody. So I just said, you know what I'd have, I'd have a fucking marching band the way they used to, when only sports fans watch the fucking show. And they worked, they just showed you a football game and they weren't trying to sell me the next fucking Brittany Spears album. How about that one? You know, back in the day and those racist white guys would, would, would show up to the games wearing a fucking short sleeve, Michael Douglas falling down white button up shirt with the black tie and those Malcolm x, Vince Lombardi glasses and a crew cut. All right. That's the football I remember. So then they started calling me grant Grand Torino like I was Clint Eastwood.

Speaker 8:          00:49:09       Um, has anybody seen that movie by the way? You know, I don't know. I don't know. I don't know if I want to watch Clint for fucking an hour and a half going, you know, get off my lawn. Hey, you person of another race gate at a here. That's a really weird movie. When you think of the concept, like, you know, what is the Grand Torino represent? Like back when things were better, when people had pride and there was more racism or at least overt racism in this country. Is that what the message was? Well, I dunno, Bill, why don't you go see the fucking movie before you rip it apart? Well, speaking of that, um, we do a lot of, um, Jesus Christ. I hope that this fucking thing is recording right now because I really feel like a, this is going to be a decent podcast here cause I've got a nice segue speaking of a, of movie reviews, you know, a lot of you guys have sent me move your views about stuffs you liked and then you've trashed movies that, um, that you haven't liked.

Speaker 8:          00:50:10       And I got to tell you something. Somebody took the piss out of that. I've never with a fuck is it? Oh, you're such, oh, here we go. I got it right here. Somebody fucking did a review of Slumdog millionaire and you have to like sort of enjoy a movie and then you meet somebody and they so rip it to shreds so convincingly that you start thinking, hey, maybe it did suck. You know, I saw a, I saw Slumdog millionaire. I took my girlfriend there with her mom. She was in town and they loved it. Yeah. You know, it's a chick flick or whatever. But, uh, I walked away from it thinking like a, you know, wow, I should've been more of a romantic, you know, instead of the fucking asshole that I am. That's what I got out of the movie. But I thought, well, you know, I thought it was a decent movie, but here's this.

Speaker 8:          00:51:02       But now that this dude fucking trashed it, I don't know if I could ever watch it again. Here is this guys. Okay. Overrated. Slumdog millionaire. All right, buckle up for this one. All right, here we go. This is his review. Imagine a Sally Struthers sponsor, a child add meets faces of death meets Forrest Gump. Let me read that a little more clearer. I apologize. In the worst, imagine a Sally Struthers sponsors a child add meets faces of death meets Forrest Gump. The first 90 minutes, first 90 minutes of of is a kid. Kit's covered in shit, sleeping on garbage blend in some child prostitution in a guy running around looking like the cover art on rage against the machines. First record, we see the kids mom get beat to death. Not once, but at least three fucking times. The movie is like transformers or any other bombastic chase scene blow up flick.

Speaker 8:          00:51:57       But instead of Bruce Willis fucking up cars, kids get abused, abused to shock and awe. The audience. It also has more cliches and a cop buddy flick, the Indian guy works at a call center in Mumbai, Mumbai for cell phones and says shit like, well, we'll just live on love. Am I butchering this? And to top it off, fate and luck make the Indian guy rich and happy. Is that what they want us to believe in these days? Just let things happen to us and we'll get by really the, that overhype Turd got 10 Oscar nominations that Godfather got 11 because Slumdog millionaire has poor people in India. No one has the balls to stand up and say it's just a glorified B movie. The academy thinks they need to teach the American public a lesson just like they did with crash and Brokeback mountain. This snuff flick is not a meaningful comment on the human condition either.

Speaker 8:          00:52:55       It's just another marketing con job. And as, as much so as Michael Bolton and as much substance as a John Grisham novel, Jesus Christ. I think it's that last paragraph that got me. Um, I got to agree with you on that. The academy thinks they need to teach America lesson. I don't think that they need that. I think the academy doesn't really hang out with anybody other than the academy. So whenever they see a movie about tragedy, about a group of people they don't really know anything about, they automatically say it's brilliant because I'm gonna tell you something right now. I agree with you. Crash sucked and will be fucking sucked. It wasn't groundbreaking. There was nothing going on. It was hacky. It was, it was, the whole thing was fucking stupid. And, uh, when I saw Oprah going on TV going, oh my God, this is such an important movie, it's like, no, it is an Oprah.

Speaker 8:          00:53:51       It's not an important movie. Okay. You don't know what the fuck you talking about and you don't read all those books that you recommend every week. Okay? There's no fucking way. You have time to have your own fucking TV show, your own fucking magazine and a weird relationship with a cocker Spaniel and read a 400 page fucking novel every week. All right, so you've got no credibility with me. Okay. And that movie Brokeback mountain, that was two gay guys fucking in a tent. You know, it's basically a chick flick. It's like, uh, I dunno. Grizzly Adams meets Harvey milk. No, that's not good. We need something gay in there. It's like the ice capades meets, uh, a fistful of dollars that gets shoved up your host. Thank you. Um, no, I gotta you know something I think, yeah. Slum dog millionaire. I, it's actually, I think it's a really good movie.

Speaker 8:          00:54:43       I actually should have done the whole spoiler alert then cause I realized halfway through that review, he wasn't necessarily reviewing it as he was just sort of telling you what happens. Um, I should've just read the last paragraph. So I apologize to any, uh, chicks out there who wanted to go see that movie. It's definitely a good movie. Um, you should go see it. How about that? Does that make you feel better? Um, but anyways, well, I don't know. What do you guys think about this? You know, that's another thing. If you knew my podcast, um, I realized that I'm a fucking moron if you haven't figured that out for yourself yet. So I asked questions like I asked, um, I was kind of curious, being an angry guy. I had a question about Asian culture where, um, you know, I just don't see the anger, you know what I mean? Like, uh, I went, um, they got this fucking skating rink out in Burbank, some of the worst ice I've ever skated on my life. And I was talking a couple of weeks ago how I was skating over there and it was in the middle of the day, cause I hate going to the fucking gym. So I figured I'll just start skating around Lego FHEG in the middle of the day.

Speaker 8:          00:55:54       There was no way for me to say I went ice skating by myself in the middle of the day and just not feel like the biggest pansy ever. But I did it. Okay. Goddammit. And I came home and I jerked off to some heterosexual porn just to make sure I was still okay. But anyways, um, so I'm sitting there and skate and skating around there, skating around and just know that thing, letting the momentum take me where it wants to go. And, uh, there was this group of Asian kids there and the fucking two of them kept falling down on the ice really fucking hard and they never seem to get upset. They always laughed and I was just like, you know, really, I can see the first couple of times you feel silly that some girls there you with Elap, but at some point you gotta be like, you got to start to realize that it's killing your opportunity to get to hook up and then don't you start getting mad.

Speaker 8:          00:56:46       But they never did. So I asked the question where is the anger? So somebody wrote in and said, Bill, I'm Japanese American, but uh, I and I have witnessed my fair share of East Asian enigmas I think I have an explanation for the ice skating ass busting, unyielding Asian persistence for not phenomenon. Yeah. Cause the dude just kept getting up. He'd laugh, he get up, he wouldn't even dust the snow off the back of his head. He just just kept going and he was happy as hell. Was fascinated, fascinated with that level of, I dunno, denial or happiness. But I want to have that look on my face at some point in my life and I'm 40 my life's half over. So anyway, she goes, uh, as you know, Asian people, especially men are robots. I actually, I didn't know that. Um, they aren't programmed to show frustration or anger after many failed attempts. This is in large part why they can defy the laws of physics in the fields of gymnastics and can do martial arts in the air and the lung rooftops.

Speaker 8:          00:57:53       All right, she's breaking my balls here. Let me finish this. Ah, however, even though they generally are void of most emotions, especially in public, Asians are weak to the layer of booze. They get rosy cheek wasted and nothing can sell either. Alcohol induced getting this, not even repeated ice to ask impact. So my suspicion is that you witnessed just that the mechanical persistence of uncoordinated robots, Aka Drunk Asians on ice. You know, that would be a great, you know, there'll be a great shelf drunk Asians on ice that would, that speaking of the Icecapades, whoever thought that that would come back around again. Fucking drunk Asians on ice would put the ice capades out of business, kind of lazy UFC hurting wrestling at this point. You know what I mean? That would be the fucking UFC of ice. Capades drunk Asians on ice. Um, all right, so many ways you guys want to get into the contest here.

Speaker 8:          00:58:52       I want to try to keep this podcast a little bit shorter. I'm already up to 17 minutes here. I'm gonna try to keep it right around the half hour mark because I'm afraid that, you know, I'm using up too much digital time here. So anyways, as a most of you guys know, um, I said I was 40, so I got the physical and then I had to get the old prostate fucking exam. And, uh, I was, uh, I was upset by it, you know, because unlike heath ledger, I wasn't in a tent. I'm somebody who wasn't whispering sweet nothings to me. And it was, it was very, it was very fucking disturbing and a, I wanted to talk about it on stage, but so many comedians, any comic, you know who's had that procedure done to them, fucking has gone on stage and talked about it. So I'm just like, there's no way for me to talk about it.

Speaker 8:          00:59:46       Every joke has hackey so I asked my 14 listener fucking podcast audience if they could come up with an a, if they could come up with an original prostate exam fucking joke, they, um, I would do it on stage and they would, they would win a fucking DVD. So here are the finalists and you guys are going to vote on these so I can keep the whole interaction of this tremendous podcasts going. All right, here is a, here's number one, entry number one, trying to a given a range on an original spin on the prostate exam. Please forgive my reading out loud because I really noticed on this one, I'm just not getting any better at it. And you know what's happens too, is the second I start fucking it up, I start panicking in my head just like when I was in fourth grade and then I try to rush to the end of it.

Speaker 8:          01:00:37       And uh, you know, it just brings back bad memories. I remember one time I read out loud in the fourth grade and I got so fucking nervous and I kept screwing up everything that I just started reading faster and faster. And when it was, you know, cause I basically, I, I figured out that everyone, everyone was reading two paragraphs out loud and I fucked up halfway through the first sentence. So then I just [inaudible] off to the next, the rest of it, you know, thinking I got out of it and at the end of it the teacher said, I didn't understand one word. He said, did anybody else understand them? You know, I know. And then nobody said anything. And then she made me fucking reread it again. And by then my mouth was completely dry, you know, and it was a, I know it still affects me not like a prostate exam, but it still affects me.

Speaker 8:          01:01:28       So let's get on with the content there. All right. Prostate, prostate joke number one. Now I got admit, I thought you guys were just going to write quick little jokes, but people were writing colonists chunks on this shit. So a fucking, I'm going to have to relive my fourth grade nightmare here. Okay, joke number one. All right. Keep score at home so he can, you can, you can vote for which one you like. Here's number one, Bill. You addressing the audience. Okay, well thank you for the direction and didn't think I'd be turned around addressing the curtain or a fucking you in the green room. Just talking to yourself. All right, so everyone, um, I went and got violated by my doctor today. You've heard this story, a horror story before I got a prostate exam. You've probably also heard the joke about who the hell would ever want to grow up and do shit like that on a daily basis?

Speaker 8:          01:02:19       Well, what I want to know is what kind of a person goes to school to learn how to teach other people, more people, how to do that shit on a daily basis. What kind of fucking sadistic teacher? What kind of say it as teachers, other people, the proper way to shove a finger up someone else's ass. They'd have to be a sadist. I could imagine the prep professor in the science practice lab with the, the other dummies going, hey Bobby, you being a little too soft. You really need to shove it up there. Good. And dig around for that prostate. No, no, no, no, no. Step aside, I'll show you the proper technique. Wait til they either screen or whimper like a little kid. Then there's more, I love this. This is more direction for me. Walk to the other area of the stage.

Speaker 8:          01:03:07       The person really went all out. Uh, okay. So evidently I walked to the other side of the stage and evidently there's another patient over there. At which point I say, how are we doing over here, George? You need to remember the lube or you're going to get sued. Uh, oh, I get it. The doctor wasn't using any lube. Okay. Jesus Christ. You're not wearing any gloves either. George, we've got to stop letting these legacy students in fucking morons. Uh, you could get a slip, serious blister or shit on your finger or something. Jesus Christ. Dude, you really getting disgusting though. All right. Here's the final bit. Now class, most importantly, you need to develop your emotionless. You're emotionless. Face skills. I'm serious. You want an a in this class? You better have a stone cold face after you violate all the dummies. No laughing. When they scream for mercy.

Speaker 8:          01:03:55       I'm serious. They have speakers with audios. What? I'm serious. They have speakers with audio screams, custom fitted by me. I'm serious. All right. I don't get what the fuck that last line means, but you know, there you go. That's halfway decent. Do the whole doctor thing, I guess. I Dunno, right? Number. This is number two of the colonists chunks and I apologize. All right, that's joke number one. Now with my skills, I'm obviously only reading these ones, so please keep score at home. All right? You get to do a little American idol thing here. All right. Uh, all right, well the fuck are we. Ah, Bill, I completely agree with you that there's no real ground to break on the prostate exam exam jokes, but want you, but once you say free DVD, my brain's shorts circus. So below is my best attempt. All right.

Speaker 8:          01:04:46       My wife and I had been together for 15 years. In that time, I've gone to the doctor once, she's probably gone 50 times that John Wayne Act comes at a price. There are procedures, there are procedures for every one inch of a woman's body. I lifts breast lifts, Tummy Tucks, someone with eight years of educations that one of the finest schools on earth, Spanish time figuring out how to inject blowfish toxins into women's faces. So they'd look younger and it doesn't stop there. Look at this using classic standup jargon and it doesn't stop there. People, what's the mammographic machine cost? You know what cost a lot. And what does it do? It crushes tits. A cat scan machine cost a lot too, but it can be used for anything. It's a cat scan. Might be a little noisy, a little scary if you have claustrophobia, but it doesn't injure you.

Speaker 8:          01:05:37       A mammogram takes one of the most sensitive parts of the human anatomy, anatomy and it presses it until it hurts. That's it. $1 million please. But guys, gotta be tough. No doctor visits unless something's falling off. So what fantastic piece of Jetson technology that we get, we get some MIT created. Do we get some MIT created imaging machine? No. Uh, doctors index finger, the same finger that he uses to get the intention of a bad waiter. That's the detective equipment plus a rubber glove. I grew up in the seventies and eighties. I don't always remember rubber gloves to you. Back in the 60s when you'd see a doctor smoking on TV shows. Did they have gloves or do they just have a bar of lava soap over on the side? Think like a mechanic. Sorry, I didn't shake your hand, ted. Now doc rarely. That's okay. So those, his prostate exam one, by the way, I don't have anybody, you know, you guys sent me your addresses, but I saved all your emails.

Speaker 8:          01:06:38       So, um, next week when I announced the winner, um, I do have your original email. So any you fucking dirt bags out there who can try to pretend to be these people. I have all the original emails, so if you win, please send me your address. Okay, here's a couple more. Uh, well I see this is number three. That last one was number two and the previous one was number one. Okay. You guys, you guys all caught up. All right, number three. Um, all right bill. I see you got your ass tickled the other day. I don't know if anyone's ever done this angle, but you ever thought about one of those ass tickling doctors being gay? Not saying that he enjoyed tickling your ass, but more like the same way if you're dating agendas, your friends think stuff like, ah man, she must really know how to do some freaky shit cause she's so flexible.

Speaker 8:          01:07:27       A gay guy would be like, hey, I'm dating one of those. Ask tickling doctors. And then as other gay friends would be like, wow, he must really know his way around an asshole. I Dunno, that kind of sucked, but give me a DVD. You know what, dude? I don't think that did kind of suck. I'm going to be a little Simon here and say, ah, that, you know, that wasn't that bad. That was actually, you know what? That was pretty original. Yeah. Why am I met? You guys fucking decide I'm the goddamn comedian here. You know what? Fuck you guys right now. That one's in the lead. So you guys put your pens down. I just really killed a couple of people's dreams there. People sitting in their cubicles, you know, people actually tell me that some, some people out there that actually listened to these podcasts to get through airplane flights because I make them so fucking long, which means now there's possibly somebody sitting on an airplane listening to the podcast, which I think is really cool.

Speaker 8:          01:08:21       And, uh, you know, I feel bad for you that you're on a plane and uh, you know, how ugly is the person sitting next to you? By the way, that's one thing that always annoys me about when I get on a flight is, I don't know if this ever happens you guys, but there's somebody good looking ever sit next to you. You know, when, when to fucking hot chicks fly across the country because it's never on my flight. Or when they in shape guys, you know, how can horrific looking people and I'd say I'm helping anything. But you know, if you're on a plane right now, just pretend like you're turning around to see if the bathroom's available and just look at the people. Do it. I'll wait. Good. Turn around. Look at him. Look at him. Look at the, look at that fat headed Jack.

Speaker 8:          01:09:07       Big Fred Flintstone. Look at fucking idiot sleeping with his mouth open. It's just horrific. You know what it is? It's the private jets. All good looking people flying. Those little fucking private jets just left all the ugly people in coach, you know, which is what I'm flying by the way. I'm not trying to put myself above people. Bill, can you get back to the contest? Fine. I will. All right. Entry number for bill. You know the classic family dinner scene where everyone is asking each other things like how was work today? Well, there's really no fucking way you can ask your dad or husband to give you a legitimate response to that question if they're approch tologist because in reality he's been finger and dudes all day and a, you're trying to finish a potato salad. You know what? That was a funny line and I butchered it.

Speaker 8:          01:09:54       God dammit. There's no way to legitimately ask a proctologist that because he's been figuring dudes all day and you're trying to finish a potato south. That my friend is a funny fucking line. So all his answers have to revolve around parking spots, routes to work or maybe a receptionist birthday cake. Also, how scared of the other dudes faces in the waiting room. And that's to be similar to the look soldiers gave each other before stoning the storming the beaches of Normandy. Dude, you know what? That's actually really true. I couldn't look at anybody when I was in there, and especially when I walked out, when I walked out, I looked at the floor, remember that? Remember that? And the pope of Greenwich Village and then you tell her she can't say goodnight to nobody that way. She got to look at the floor when she walks out, Charlie.

Speaker 8:          01:10:42       That's what I was doing. I looked out, I walked out looking at the fucking floor. You know? They know it's funny, as the guys in the waiting room technically could have given me shit because they still have the option of running out, which is exactly what the fuck they should've done. They should've ran out. Just fucking hazed me all the way back to the fucking elevator, Angie like that, Angie like that. Your little fucking Douche. All right. Um, I think I got one more here. You know what? You guys can decide on these fucking things. I'm not doing that. That was Joe was number four. That was joke number four. Pick up your pen. That was number four. All right, here's number five and this is this one. This guy is actually, you know what? Those are the four you can choose from and this guy here is going to win an honorary DVD cause he didn't email me.

Speaker 8:          01:11:31       I was actually in Houston, Texas and this fucking guy, I was doing radio on location in some bar, one of those fucking sports bars and people are drinking beers and eating chicken wings if fucking 10 in the morning. And I'm, and I'm doing radio in there and as I come walking out, I don't know how this guy knew I was coming out, but he timed it perfectly. First of all, he knew where the fuck I was. I came walking out in this car, just pulls right up like the FBI in good fellas, you know, just pulls right up. He's like, hey bill bar and I've got a little freaked out. I'm like, Hey, what's going on? He goes, hey, I got an I got an entry for the prostate exam joke dude. I'm in a parking lot in the middle of fucking Houston outside some fucking dive bar at 10 in the morning.

Speaker 8:          01:12:22       I'm not thinking about the podcast, I'm thinking about going to Denny's and this fucking guy pulls right up and hands me two fucking complete sheets of paper. Prostate exam material is the heading. I felt like I was cheating on a test. You know this guy came back with all the answers so I can only read half of this cause I'm already at a half hour and I want to make sure this thing gets posted. So is the other one. Here's say this is the honorary one. Uh, Bill, I'm not sure how I'll be able to cope with the day. I have a prostate exam as it draws nearer. Of course I realize that I'm eight years away, but it freaks me out now. Freaks me out now cause I'm going to be a fucking mess when the time comes to can I be a worst fucking out loud reader?

Speaker 8:          01:13:11       Whatever it is, you never have to worry about me being behind a podium. Let me start this over again and fucking relax here. It's all right Phil. There's two pages of stuff. You only have to read a half of it. Half of it. You only have to read half of it. Look at me. I'm flustered. Bernoulli flustered on my own podcast. All right, here we go, Bill. I'm not sure how it be able to cope with the day. I have a prostate exam as it draws near. Of course, I realize that's about eight years away, but if it freaks me out now, I'm going to be a fucking mess when the time comes. This all spawns from my homophobia and lack of confidence in my own manhood. Gotta love honesty in any joke. I mean, what if I liked the ship? I'll have to get divorced again. My kids will have to ask why and I'll have to tell my son, well, I left your mom because I liked the doctors. Giant sausage fingers poking around in my asshole and you know what? It's just not fair to your mother.

Speaker 8:          01:14:16       Then I'll have to go into why it's much worse to have enjoyed it during a medical exam and the ethics involved as opposed to just be an effect. You know who I blame society and my God damn older brother and it's not why you think he made me watch the hand that rocks the cradle when I was 15 before I fully understood how sick that lady's doctor was for slipping is rubber gloves off before her exam and he fingered the shit out of her Jesus Christ. What kind of movie is that? You know what I like about this guy? He's really not soft peddling this joke. He's really using brutal language here. Anyways, getting back to the movie, at first I was like, why the fuck did they arrest that guy? That was really fucking smooth. Keep in mind I was 15 and thought anyway at all to get my hands face or cock in on or near a real pussy was completely acceptable.

Speaker 8:          01:15:09       Think about it. When you're a kid, societal rules and judgments don't apply. If you see a kid shit, you want it. You just beat the shit out of them and you take it, you go to detention and Google and who gives a shit? Right? Of course I came to realize that those types of things are fucked up and you don't do that kind of shit. But to get back to the subject, when it came time to learn about prostate exam, my screwed up fucking head immediately thought of that movie and I thought to myself, fuck, what if I'm the guy who is unlucky enough to get some sick, perverted, twisted doctor that wants to slip off his rubber glove and get as rock off Brock's off with his gay finger in my ass. Not only will I have to process being taken advantage of and violated, I'm gonna have to reframe from beating the shit out of the guy to avoid prosecution.

Speaker 8:          01:15:57       And then I'm going to have to investigate the guy and find out who else he violated, make a case against him and then go to group therapy with a bunch of others. Poor schmucks that got fingered. All right, dude, I can not read the rest of his men. This is like fucking the original count of Monte Cristo. It's like 700 pages long. All right there on the entries. You tell me who had the best one on of those first four, this guy's going to get the honorary mentioned cause he, you know, that was actually really original cause uh, I guess, you know, I don't know. He fucking, they just, all right, you want to hear my 2 cents? I like this guy's angle. The last guy I had just read because, uh, I don't know. He made it really personal and honest and even though, you know, it was kind of homophobic, he called himself out for being homophobic, you know, and, uh, to me, honest with you, I remember being a kid to thinking like, you know, I, I'd love to be a gynecologist.

Speaker 8:          01:16:54       You know, just being a kid, you're a fucking pervert, but you know what it is. You forget that 80 year old women also go to the gynecologist, you know, so it's not a fun job. So even if you were a gay guy, you're just because you're a gay guy doesn't mean you're like all gay guys. You know what I'm saying? What happens today? Lou Grant comes walking in there and you've got to check. Yes. It's just really getting gross giving you or something. You know, I learned, this is why I don't do sexual material on stage. I don't know if you guys have ever noticed that about me, but I stay away from it because I don't find, I don't know if it's the Catholic guilt, I just always feel crude, you know, which is a funny realization that actually make on this podcast after I had been talking about prostate exams for the last fucking two.

Speaker 8:          01:17:36       So anyways, um, I dunno, I think it's a toss up between that last guy. And I also like the guys who said, what if the guy that that angle where you know the gay guys going, Oh yeah, I'm dating a a proctologist and then the other gay guy friends are looking at him like he's lucky. Like wow, he must really know his way around an asshole. That is such a fucking valid point because he does. And I would think that gay guys would think that shit the same way. If someone was dating a gymnast, I'd be like, Jesus Christ, you must be inventing sexual positions, you know, so whatever, whatever you guys send me in the ones that you like, you gotta tell me why. And uh, next week, uh, I'll do the big giveaway. So everybody is that I read, please send me Your fucking address and uh, no one, me being a liberal, fuck, I'll probably send you all DVDs because I don't want anybody to feel left out.

Speaker 8:          01:18:30       Okay. So there you go. So how far are we in here? We're at 37 minutes. Then once again, this is really long. Let me get to, uh, you know what, I'm not going to get to the questions this week just for the simple fact that I'm afraid to step that knock on a law that they're not going to, you know, post this one. So before I get Outta here, I want to thank everybody I didn't get a chance to last week. I really want to thank everybody who came up to see me and, uh, Houston, Texas last week or two weeks ago, uh, I couldn't believe the amount of people that showed out showed up as we sold out a couple of shows and um, they got a new club owner out there who just really knows what the hell he's doing. And I'm definitely going to be back.

Speaker 8:          01:19:13       And uh, I'd like to thank Nicole for showing up. Part of my fan club always coming out to my gigs and a, and that's it. And this week I'm up in Boston. I got a, I got the Wilbur theater on February 6th, and then I got chickopee, Massachusetts. And if you live out in western Massachusetts, if you don't want to drive all the way to Boston, I'm going to be chickopee Massachusetts. One of my favorite gigs. I actually back in the day, I used to open up the David Allen Greer there, Bobby Collins, all these big shots and now I'm there. So I feel like a big shot. And plus it's a Chinese fucking restaurant, you know what I mean? How great is that? I helped them. When you have stage lights, I hope my face is just lit up by the flames of the Pu Pu platter, you know, and I can tell fucking ghost stories.

Speaker 8:          01:20:03       So those are my, that's my gig this weekend. My next gigs I have, I have coming up. I got a wife, guys in Ogden, Utah on February 20th, and then I'm taking a little bit of break is going to be performing mostly out here in the La area until uh, March 26th to the 28th. I will be at, uh, the house of comedy in East St Louis, Missouri. So please come out to see my show. Thanks everybody for listening to the podcast. I really hope you guys get to hear this one because I'm sick of fucking talking and not having anybody here at all, right? That's it. God bless you. Congratulations to the Pittsburgh Steelers. And how about those Bruins, Huh? Beat the Canadians again. Can you believe it? Can you fucking believe that? All right.

Speaker 7:          01:20:52       That's it. Everybody have a good week. I'll talk to you. Yeah. [inaudible].
