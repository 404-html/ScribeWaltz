Speaker 1:          00:00:01       Hey, what's going on? It's bill burr and it's the Monday morning podcast for Monday, April 30th. And I just slammed the fucking mixer now. Everything's too quiet. Hello? Hello? Hello my baby. Hello my honey. Where the fuck have you Ben? You fucking whole. Ah, it's fucking 2:00 AM. Um, what's up? How are Ya? I'm back from, um, I'm back from the east coast back from east coast. I did a wonderful Gig at the University of conquered in Concord, New Hampshire. I had an awesome time Warner. Thank everybody who came out. I had a great time. And um, um, I don't know what to tell you. It's been a while since I did a college gig. It was actually cool because it was, it was open to the public. Usually when they have college gigs, they, they're not open to the public in case you were wondering case you didn't understand when I said usually they're not open to the public the first time or whatever the fuck I said, I don't know what I just said. But usually it's just, it's just all going to be students, students, and then a couple of crabby teachers hanging in the background or maybe some rat have a student who's going to sit there and wait for you to say something, you know, and then write about it and blog about it. And the next thing you know you're on good Mary. Good Morning America, Good Morning America, right? Who pitched that fucking show? I mean God knows it's a hit, but Jesus Christ.

Speaker 1:          00:01:30       How do you, how did you pitch that name of for a show without either, without like either snickering as you said, the name of the show or having your balls pull up inside of you. I want to do is show nationally syndicated edits. It starts at six in the morning and it's called Good Morning America Gun Marnie in America. Why would you do that? And we, I just want to sit there and be pleasant for three hours. Do you know who took them meeting with somebody the other day? Yes. I just said that. That's how Hollywood I am. I took a meeting and by taking a meeting, I mean I went out and I got a fucking Omelet, sat across from somebody, see it like fucking toast between the teeth is and um,

Speaker 1:          00:02:22       I dunno. I, I don't, I don't think, I don't think it's ever going to happen for me. People. I think I'm going to be like Willie Nelson. I think I'm going to be on the road my whole life, man. I gotta tell you got tell you what I got that freedom in my bones, man. I fucked up. You know what I mean? I fucked up in my career. How did you fuck up bill? I stayed out there too long. You know, like that 43 year old guy still in the clubs, shocking in his gut with the button down shiny shirt, still hitting on the lady, right. Teeth are already starting to discolor, you know, cause you so old,

Speaker 2:          00:02:59       no matter how much you brush him, they still just, after a while you just can't keep up with the, the red wine tied. It just keeps turning your teeth just a little grayer.

Speaker 1:          00:03:11       And, uh, I stayed out on the road too long. I did. I was a standup comic for too long. I fucked up. I fucked up. And now I don't know how to work with other people because for 20 years it's been, hey, here's an idea. And then I go, yeah, I agree with that. You know why? Because it's my idea. I totally agree with that shit. And now,

Speaker 2:          00:03:32       now all of a sudden I'm coming in from, from the fucking Bush, right after 20 goddamn tours and now I got to sit here and try and work with other people. I don't know how to do it. I really shouldn't be saying this on my podcast. I don't know how to fucking do it.

Speaker 1:          00:03:44       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:03:45       You know, we saw your tape. We really liked it. We thought that you were, you have really mainstream sort of comedy. Uh, yeah. I really don't think it's mainstream. I say con to every other word. Yeah, I know, but, but there's a main stream sensibility to it. And I'm literally sitting there going, all right, this is an argument and fucking six weeks.

Speaker 1:          00:04:05       Right. Got It. I'm in what I'm talking about. What the fuck was I going with that?

Speaker 2:          00:04:13       Oh, let, let, let's, let's, let's rewind. We weren't, we weren't New Hampshire. Beautiful Goddamn state by the way. And the people aren't as simple as they try to make them every year, every four years. You know, when there's a presidential election and he do that little quaint piece above the primary, Zoe started rolling.

Speaker 3:          00:04:30       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:04:30       Stay called New Hampshire and then down to earth, kind of flat to people. Whenever they say salt of the earth down to earth, that's there. That's there a euphemism for calling you retarded. You know what I mean? There really is sort of a media bias where if you don't live in New York or La, you're just considered a fucking moron.

Speaker 3:          00:04:51       You know what I mean?

Speaker 2:          00:04:53       All those God damn shows you just, you just a fucking moron. All the God damn TV shows, you know, there's always the smart person who moved from New York or some major city back to their hometown and everybody there is a fucking retard. Right?

Speaker 1:          00:05:11       But, um, I don't know. Maybe there's some fucking truth to it. Who the hell knows. So anyways, I'm up in Concord, New Hampshire, beautiful state, lush state, plenty of trees, plenty of water, plenty of game and fish, you know, plenty of fatties, right? Their food source, they're already Mabo Day.

Speaker 2:          00:05:33       If you think about that, when you look, when you think about yourself as like what kind of shape you're in, like if someone was to throw you on a grill, like what kind of steak would you be? You know, would you be a lean cut of meat? You know, make a Philemon, Yana would you be a fucking New York strip? A goddamn

Speaker 1:          00:05:51       buy, one of those John Candy steaks. I gotta tell you I've been on the fucking road a little bit. Uh, and you know what it is? I take my special and then I was just like, well fuck it. I can get fat again cause I don't got to worry about being on TV for another two years. So I started eating Sundays. What else did he, I just started having lunches like you did when you were in the seventh grade. You know, there's like a bag of Fritos and a soda and some sort of a, some sort of protein with somehow in there. Right. So Braid, um, and he was, I'm, I'm trying to dance around this fucking subject, but, uh, the Bruins lost Bruins lost. There's nothing like, there's nothing like, I don't know, losing an overtime sucks, but, uh, I don't know what it is about hockey.

Speaker 1:          00:06:39       Hockey's just so fucking, it just, it killed you, right? So we lose, but I gotta be honest with the capital's would definitely be a better team. I felt that there was a better team, pretty much every game. This Guy Kevin Dupont for the Boston Globe wrote a great article or he just basically summed up the series where they just were always a little better, a little quicker. It had a little better defense, a little bit of fore checking, just a little better everything. So they deserve it. Fucking pricks. Um, so then what happens, right? The overtime golf people aren't, hockey fans were scored by a guy who was not white. He was not Asian. I was a black guy, scored the goal. Right. So then like, you know, it's game seven, it's in Boston. Boston loses. So right. Then you know what's going to happen? All the fucking racist coming out of the woodwork, they texts like Goddamn a hundred of those things.

Speaker 1:          00:07:38       Just calling the guy the n word, like you're talking like, like shit that they would cut out of the script and like Mississippi burning going like, all right, you know what? That's too fucking harsh. So I started getting all these emails going through what's up with all the racist Boston fans and Blahblahblah trashing me and I'm like, oh, isn't this hilarious? You know, this is hilarious. You have, so basically you're not supposed to judge all by a few, but it's okay to do it in this direction. So I'm on my fucking high horse, right? So I go back to Boston, just so happens this weekend and I'm hanging out. One night I'd have off in Boston, and I hate to admit it, I heard the n word twice. I heard it alluded to another time. And I just finally had the, I had to fucking go home. You know, I'm not saying it's worse than Alabama, but I don't think it's any better. Just fucking brutal. Granted, I did go to a moron bar. It was the gene pool I was in, but I, I, you know, I can't defend it. I can't defend it anymore. It's fucking embarrassing. Um, I dunno. Just fucking embarrassing. Good Morning America. How are you? All right, let's get on with the fucking, uh,

Speaker 2:          00:08:57       and unbelievably ignorant too. You know, I just fucking, I, I just, I, for the life of me, uh, I don't get it. One of the guys had a lazy eye too. That's what killed me.

Speaker 3:          00:09:12       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:09:12       You know, it's like, dude, have you looked in a two mirrors simultaneously and seeing what you're looking at? How the fuck are you looking down on anybody? No, no, no. What, so now I've got to trash people, Lazy eyes to get my point across that I don't appreciate racist people. I'm a fucking idiot myself. But you know what? I'm going to, I'm doing something about it. Unlike those morons, I ran two back in my fucking embarrassing city over the weekend. Um, I'm sick of not having a good science background. So I actually went to a bookstore and one of the few remaining bookstores out there and, uh, I bought a book on how to rebuild a carburetor and I also bought a book on the elements. It's hilarious. It's this big giant book. Um, I'm, I'm, my mind is already blown cause this shit is like magic to me.

Speaker 2:          00:10:00       Telling me that my foot, that'd be things made out of matter. What the fuck did it say? The Earth, this book, your foot, everything is tangible. Everything tangible is made of elements. Your foot is made mostly of oxygen with quite a bit of carbon. Joining it, giving it structure to the organic molecules that define you as an example of carbon based life. I was like, that just fucking blew my mind. I didn't know it was carbon and me. Carbon fiber. I don't know what carbon fiber, what do they do? Isn't it like even in bulletproof vests, this a dumb idea. I have no idea. So then I'm sitting there going, so does that mean you can kind of shoot me in the foot? You know, with some sort of low caliber gun and it's going to ricochet off or if it goes through, does all the air come out?

Speaker 1:          00:10:52       I just don't get it. I don't fucking get it. All right. I've gone on these fucking websites. I try and read about how a plane flies. I swear to God, Wikipedia. It's hilarious. Like you know when you, when you're reading about trying to figure out how to God damn plane flies,

Speaker 2:          00:11:09       they have a,

Speaker 1:          00:11:11       you know, they'll have whatever. They'll have like, you know, two pages on the shit basically explained and how's it goes down in like every paragraph has like two words highlighted in case you don't know what that means. And I would have to click on every word. So I'll click on a word and then they start to define that. And then it's the same thing. It's another page of shit. Wherever you paragraph does three more things highlighted. And then I've got to click on that thing and I had just keep getting further and further away from how the fucking plane flies.

Speaker 2:          00:11:38       And I get all the way down to like page one of Wikipedia. God Damn like you. No scratch and sniff picture with some lady with like a sock puppet. Tronics let's just, let's just start really, really slow, Bill.

Speaker 1:          00:11:55       I'm sick of it. All right. Um, I think there's something, I don't know what's going on with my truck. It hesitates in first gear, first gear. So I thought it was a clutch. Someone else's, it could be the clutch will or we could be in yet cabaret rater. So I start reading up on carburetors, right? And the whole fucking, the whole philosophy create a vacuum and in, in whatever that word is, when you turn a liquid into a Goddamn mist. And at the end of it, I'm just looking at this angle and this is just a bunch of fucking screws and springs, you know, why don't we just go to the junk yard, get one, take it apart and put it back together and just keep reading these fucking books and eventually at some point it has to click right. So that's what I'm doing.

Speaker 1:          00:12:42       I went on Ebay because I'm too fucking lazy because I'm a fucking Hollywood phony. Rather than go down to a salvage Yad, you know I'm going to fucking just go on Ebay and bid on some old carburetor that's going to be a fight. When that thing shows up, it's going to be a little box and he is going to see it and think I bought her something nice. Oh, it has a lot of way to it. It's going to be expensive. I would. Or if it's shiny and it's just going to open it up, there's going to be some old fucking old ass carburetor, you know? I Dunno. You guys at least give me points for trying. Does that work? How about Paul Versey last week, everybody who became a father again today, congratulation to New Jersey's own, Paul Versey and a beautiful baby girl today. Uh, how about how much did he kill it last week?

Speaker 1:          00:13:35       You know, people eat be the most people, 90% of people love them. And then there was people who weren't into sports and they thought it was like the worst podcast ever. I had some fucking Douche bag from across the way. Uh, I dunno where it was over in Europe or something. And he goes, why don't you just call your podcast a sports podcast? Just see, no, you're losing all of your foreign listeners, right? Like he speaks for all a fucking Swahili. I hate when people do that shit. And it was one fucking God damn podcast. And I talked about sports every fucking podcast. Alright, you selfish cunt. I'll fucking unfunny. Are the people in your country that you have to go all the way across the Atlantic Ocean to find a podcast to listen to you jackass. Let me tell you something. A person from another country don't fucking threaten me. The right you can't. I don't give a fuck if you listen to this and not. I really don't. So send me fucking Twitter messages like, like I'm sitting here shaking. All right, I don't need you to continue to make no money. You ever thought about that fucking Sydney of buying used carburetors can sit there and threaten me like you're taking something away from me. Go fuck yourself with your wooden shoes. Huh?

Speaker 1:          00:15:00       What do you live in Greece or something? You're mad at me cause you fucking economy. What the hell is going on over there? I don't understand how that whole thing collapsed. Everybody rioted and a, but still the, everybody is still fine. You know people are eating and they're not happy, but you know they're out there. That you Kevin a, a Greek salad. Did they call it a Greek salad over there? Did he just say, let me get a salad. You know? Oh like a, like, let's like in a, in Philly, they're going, let me get a cheese steak. They don't go, let me get a Philly. Let me get a Philadelphia cheese steak. Let me get a steak. Um, I want to still been with fucking cheese was Jesus Christ, nor do people so fat and ugly and that Goddamn city. Huh? Um, they one the other day, right? Philadelphia is a big wind. Danny Briere. It's the only time I've ever seen a guy scored two goals in one overtime.

Speaker 4:          00:15:51       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:15:52       You did the impossible. First time he did it, he was a cheetah. You know, there was a kicking motion. I was in a bar actually drinking when that happened. Listening to people say racist things to me, dawn is bad enough that they lost. But then the guy who scored it was like fucking insult to injury. You know what I'm saying? Kid? And I was like, what are you one of those fucking racist on Twitter? Oh, no, no, don't, don't. I'm just, you know, I'm just saying, I like when people do that. They fucking backtrack the ignorance of what people were saying to me. Yeah, dude, you hear about showing show? Yeah. I got two fucking kids and then his wife went gay. Swear to God, direct quote, his wife went gay. She fucking abroad now fucking shocks kid went gay. Um, you know, like, like you, I went to the star, then I went to the post office and then I went gay. That's, that's what happens. There's a little, there's a store down there, a little homosexuality store that you can go to. Um, fuck jaw droppingly stupid. Not saying everybody. The irony is that Harvard is there. That's the funny thing at MIT and all that. You know, Boston has this weird fucking sort of like, you know,

Speaker 1:          00:17:16       couple people who are really smart and then the rest of us are a,

Speaker 4:          00:17:23       okay,

Speaker 1:          00:17:23       it's, it is goodwill hunting, except we're not good at it.

Speaker 3:          00:17:26       Math.

Speaker 1:          00:17:31       Oh, that's stupid fucking movie. Jesus Christ. He is a genius at math. And he goes around beating the shit out of people. When was the last time a mathlete went around bullying people, you know?

Speaker 4:          00:17:44       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:17:45       And then what an accountant who can do 30 pull ups? What, what else? What I mean, how much of a fucking leap am I supposed to make? And these God damn movies, you know what line I hate the most in goodwill hunting. I know I brought this up before is when fucking, uh, they're in the therapy session and uh, you know, he's got the hammer, the ranch and I said I took the fucking wrench cause you know, fuck him, right. Um, or whatever the fucking line is. And then they ask,

Speaker 4:          00:18:13       okay,

Speaker 1:          00:18:13       he asked Robin Williams what he's benching and he says to 60,

Speaker 3:          00:18:22       yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:18:22       there's no way that was written in the script. How much power does Robin Williams have that the director won't be like, Hey Robin, can you drop that number down? A little bits of this movie can stay remotely believable to 60. What? After you add up benching 70 pounds, 10 times. Wait, 70 pounds. 10. That's 700. Uh, let's, let's go back to the book elements here. Um, anyways, plowing ahead. Um, this is the Monday morning podcast by the way. And a lot of you have a lot of you have been given me shit by the way, cause lately they haven't been coming out. I have a phenomenal fucking excuse that you're going to understand in about 10 months as to why I was late. All right. You can't, why do you call it the Monday morning podcast? Because I record them on Monday mornings except when I'm busy and I love for the most part, I get the fucking thing out, you know? Right. Right now it's 10 30 Monday morning, my time when I'm doing this fucking thing. So it is the Monday morning podcast and my fucking world. Can you stop making it about yourself?

Speaker 4:          00:19:21       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:19:22       Then every once in a while, once in a fucking Blue Moon, I'm so busy I can't get it done until the Tuesday and all these fucking cons come out of the woodwork.

Speaker 3:          00:19:31       Yeah. Why aren't you glad you're working with,

Speaker 1:          00:19:33       yeah. Why don't you go fucking slap your mom? Why don't you do that a couple of times? Forehand, backhand, forehand, and then just fucking give it one of those little nose twisties for being dumb enough to not be on birth control. All right. Advertising advice. Uh, hey bill. Instead of telling people to go to your podcast page and click on the Amazon link, tell them to go to your podcast page, clear the cookies on their browser, then click the amazon.com link. As soon as they get there, add the page to their bookmarks. Then every time they visit amazon.com from the bookmarks, their bookmarks, it's the same as clicking the link on your page without actually having to go there. It's the fucking future, man. That's what he wrote. Um, yeah. If my listeners are smart enough to do that, I don't know how, how do you clear the cookies? How do you do that? I don't know how to do it. I bought a new laptop, by the way. Everybody, and it's the most annoying thing ever is now. I don't know how to do anything. You know, I, I can't fucking do anything anymore. I want to, I can't even figure out how to fucking,

Speaker 4:          00:20:39       yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:20:40       put a photo up to make it my screen saver. I don't know how to do it now because now it's completely fucking different on the new Mac book pro, you know, I don't understand these fucking computers. It's like, you know, I go out and I buy a car. Yeah, it's a little faster. Technology's a little, but I still know how to drive it. Gas Brake, put it in drive. You know this. Not these fucking cunts. Not all fucking Nah, no belt Magoo there. Whatever the fuck his name is. The guy with the new balance who finally died. Thank God that douchebag. Oh, we switched and everything up. Never having the chargers fit the old phone. All his shit going into the ocean. You know, I love that guy. Like used to compare themselves to Gandhi. Did Gandhi, did he have like a sweatshop of people jumping to their deaths because they would make an Gandy fucking iPads.

Speaker 1:          00:21:27       Like I had a lot of balls, man. You know, he really did with this turtleneck and his salt and pepper. Pubes I really didn't like, uh, been a pothead for 10 years and we go, here we go. 20 minutes in Ben, a pothead for 10 years. Uh, hey bill, I'm a comedy junkie among other things and I really appreciate your show. Well, thank you very much. Um, it helps me get through my commute, but up to pathy, uh, and the awkwardness of working in a law firm and I just want to say I appreciate you to show it's really a release for me. Um, why is it awkward working in a law firm has that word awkward. Just kind of lost all meeting. Is that like the default adjective everybody goes, everybody goes to now, Hey, I ran into your girlfriend the other night in the bar.

Speaker 1:          00:22:15       Awkward. Why was it awkward? It's a bar was what, what happened in there? That was awkward. You work in a law firm. Why is that awkward? That sounds like a very good job. Why am I speaking like a robot? Um, anyways, but anyway, I've smoked weed on and off taking year breaks here and there since about 2001 when I was in high school. However, when I did smoke, I smoked every day, multiple times a day. It really didn't affect me much until recently. About eight years of this. After about eight years of this, when I turned 25 I started to notice some slowness, physically, mentally, and just in everything I did. I hated it, but I didn't want to stop smoking. I could very well stopped easily, but I'd always feel like I'd be happier high. I remember you talking about some guy who knew who freaked out when he found out he couldn't smoke when you took them on a road trip.

Speaker 1:          00:23:13       That is a little extreme to me and I am nowhere near that type of personality. I'm now 26 and I'm slowly slowing down quite a bit to just once a night if at all. We can also get expensive the more you smoke. I think smoking is okay, but if you haven't then I wouldn't because it's sort of like beer where it starts off as nothing and ends up as a crutch anyways. I just feel like if you smoke, that's fine, but be organized about it and make sure it's not affecting your personality or other types of interaction or whatever. Honestly, I wish I never smoked in my life because it's so hard to look at someone's smoking it and not want to ask for a Toke. If anyone who smokes weed wants some advice, mine would be moved to California. Get a card, smoke your heart, heart out, and find out how positive slash. Negative. It really is. At least this way you're doing it legally. I know, because I, I know this because I did it not for the weed, more for girlfriend, but I digress. And if anyone cares, girl scout cookies. Cookies are the shit. By the way, if you thought I was white, I'm not, I'm Chinese.

Speaker 1:          00:24:22       All right. I think it was a little high when he wrote to us that last paragraph use by the end of it. He's just fucking, he's eaten cookies getting paranoid. They think I'm white man. Um,

Speaker 4:          00:24:34       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:24:34       Yeah, I think, well, I think we this, it's just like, I think a lot of ways it's like booze in that, uh, you know, you have a beer here, you have a beer. That's not a big deal. But yeah, it starts consuming your life. I mean that's a major statement. Like, you know, I could not smoke weed, but I just feel I would be happier if I did. Um, for some reason with weed, people don't really see that as, that's like a major red flag. It's just not considered. That's actually considered funny and like logical. But like if I said, you know, I don't have to drink, but I just feel like my life is happier when I do or I'd be happier if I was drunk. You know what I mean? Or people will get like high before they go in and go to work and they're kinda like high for the first couple hours. Like that would be like me shotgunning a couple of beers in the parking lot. I mean, just picture that, you know, walking by and you see your boss, you catch a mid, like, you know, he's looking out of his peripheral. Is he sucking on the side of a bud tall? You know, I dunno. I think it's definitely like anything, it can't be good to sit there and putting all that fucking smoke in your lungs the same way. Uh,

Speaker 4:          00:25:40       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:25:40       I Dunno, I think he's a danger about alcohol is when you fucking up your liver. I don't think you really notice until it's fucked up. Whereas like I think if you smoke a lot you kind of, Oh my God, I'm really winded. This is really affected me. I think like your liver is uh, you only recently I started learning about how bad,

Speaker 4:          00:25:58       okay,

Speaker 1:          00:25:58       booze man, you always hear that cirrhosis of the liver. But I, I mean I thought you literally had to be walking around with a glass in your hand all the time. And I know a number of guys who are, uh, you know, dealing with that shit now and uh, lemon put lemon in your water clears out you fucking live. Uh, um, so what was, what was actually your point here then? A pothead for 10 years. You just sharing your experience as you rolled up another one and got super paranoid.

Speaker 4:          00:26:26       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:26:27       All right. Cheating whore is a great story. Bill, I want to thank you for helping me out with a really hard time of my life.

Speaker 4:          00:26:35       MMM. Um,

Speaker 1:          00:26:36       I'm 24 years old, a student at a university and I had a girlfriend. Could this font be any fucking,

Speaker 2:          00:26:44       uh, and I had a girlfriend two years younger than me. We were going out for seven months. She's working at a local cafe and about three weeks ago, out of the fucking blue comes to me and tells me that a regular at the cafe was hitting on her.

Speaker 5:          00:27:01       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:27:01       She told me that she had a boy. She told him that she had a boyfriend and was reassuring to me that nothing was going on, but we had some problems in our relationship that we needed to fix because she felt good with all the flirting and she didn't want to cheat on me. Wait a minute. But we had some problems in our relationship that we needed to fix because she felt good with all the flirting and she didn't want to cheat on me. I'll say she liked this guy hitting on him. Oh, Jesus. Anyways, he says, I took that shit hard and I told her I would do anything, do anything to make her happy, even though she knew I loved her. So I did. I gave her all my time and energy to make her happy. Oh, there you go. There's a fucking recipe for misery.

Speaker 2:          00:27:40       Fuck all my dreams. Let me sit here and cater to your emotions. You can't. Um, that was the cliff notes. Anyways, then one week ago, she calls me and breaks up with me, tells me that she fucked with that guy because she was developing strong feelings for me and was scared that I would hurt her. Ah, you got to give it up to them. You gotta give it up. Women are like, they're a guy has to learn how to be a pimp. Women just naturally know how to do it. And I swear to God, it all comes down to the fact that they can't beat the shit out of us. The fact that we could beat the living shit out of a woman is what kills us in an argument. Because you're taking solace in something that you're never going to do. You know, it's this card you never gonna play, hopefully, unless you're a fucking animal. Um,

Speaker 2:          00:28:36       meanwhile they are developing themselves mentally and figuring out how you work psychologically. And they're just like, I really think once you're in or where I'm sharing a real like relationship. Um, just to make it fair to help the guy, I think like three days a week, or at least during the arguments, like the second the argument starts, the woman should always have on like tearaway clothes and she pulls him off and then she's immediately dressed like Hannibal Lecter. You know, that ice cream man outfit that he had, you know, has her hair slicked back seat. Just really know what you're fucking with. That is brilliant. Can you imagine trying to say that to your girl? Listen, I fucked this hottie at work, but it's only because I care about you so much and I was worried that you were going to hurt me because my love for you is so deep. Jesus. You know what? I think I would high fiber. I'd high five on knock a couple of her fucking press on nails off. That was a good one. So anyways, he goes, I know it's fucking retarded. I lost my mind. I went to the cafe and I beat the shit out of that guy. Wow. Mainly because if I didn't, I was going to beat her and she didn't deserve

Speaker 2:          00:29:44       to find any excuse

Speaker 4:          00:29:47       what?

Speaker 2:          00:29:49       Mainly because if I didn't that was going to beat her and she didn't deserve to find any excuse. And because he was wasn't a hole for hitting on a girl who was in a relationship. Um, yeah dude, I don't know about that. I don't know about that. He's doing what a guy does. A guy goes around and tries to fuck women. Okay. He's not in a relationship with her and he's certainly not in a relationship with you. The person who was wrong in that is the woman you know. Now fat guy knows you or you came down to, he gave him a warning, you know, came down with you, Clint Eastwood Eyes All squinting up. Stay away from her. You know you did one of those and then he didn't, then that's on him, but you just come out of nowhere. Can you please elaborate on that? Like what was he doing?

Speaker 4:          00:30:32       Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:30:33       Was he down at the restaurant? Like, you know, making a fucking egg over easy and all of a sudden you came back and did you beat him down the street? Like fucking a sunny and the Godfather? Did he need you to throw in into some like trashed bill trashcan lid or something like that? Like one of those fucking, the whole, Oh God damn fucking neighborhood season. Um, I actually respected in a way, but you shouldn't do it because then you get sued and then she actually feels like she's right. See, I knew he was crazy. Um, now the bitch is blaming me for making a scene. Oh, there it is. And because her boss, her boss is look at her and think she is a whore. If she, if she didn't,

Speaker 2:          00:31:18       if she didn't thought about that, if she didn't think about the consequences, why should I was, was I in the wrong? I don't want to regret what I did because she deserved it. All I did was lover and she slept with another guy at fucking hurts, man. It really does. I can't move on. Thank you for hearing me out. All right. You know what, um, when I said you shouldn't have beat the beat the guy up that that was for you, that had nothing to do with her. I just don't want you to get sued or go to jail or uh, you know, you know, you get a fucking record. I mean, dude, you're, you're, you're, you're, you made a move there that could alter your future and believe me, dude, this is a great thing about horse is when you really did this, I mean, this is going to hurt like hell, but there's going to be a moment where you're going to find this fucking hilarious. You really got to believe me on this one. At some point you're going to be talking about it out loud to your friends and you're just going to say the situation out loud that you were in

Speaker 4:          00:32:22       and

Speaker 2:          00:32:23       there'll be enough time has gone by that your feelings for this girl have faded and it's almost like it's somebody else and you're going to laugh at yourself and then you're going to laugh at the whole fucking thing

Speaker 4:          00:32:35       and

Speaker 2:          00:32:37       it's probably going to hit that. It was that, why did I risk going to jail? Maybe you know, I don't have, I have like a felony or something like that on your record. Like this isn't the mother your kids. All right, you can't trust this girl as far as you can fucking throw her. You know, you can't as far as you could fucking pick her up by the back of her fucking g string and the scruff of that awful tattoo on the back of her neck that she, if she doesn't have it, she's going to get at some point and you can't trust her.

Speaker 2:          00:33:08       You can't trust her. So you just got to get to the bullshit and you're going to be fine. But in the future, dude, I would not go. I mean you just basically, uh, you like the transporter for real. You just, you did, you did like the movie version of what everybody wants to do in that situation, but you did it for real and you somehow got away with it. Uh, did you split your fucking slacks when you threw that high kick to his fucking cheap bone? I just read that recently. I read an article about that guy is Jason stayed them. How uh, he has to have special pants on because he can kick his leg so fucking high. You can't do that in a suit without ripping. Now, if I was directing the movie, I would be like, dude, that's going to make this fucking movie so much better that if you're standing there and some Anderson little suit and you're kicking so much ass, your slacks a literally disintegrating off your fucking legs. How funny would that be? Then? He's standing there in the end, his fucking, his slacks are looking like, you know, the hulks pants, right. Bill Bixby his pants after he turns into the hulk.

Speaker 5:          00:34:16       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:34:16       There are, that's that, that would be the funniest fucking thing ever. I don't know, but it will be all like the INSEAM and the crotch. But like down by the bottom off, I would totally have it. I'd be like, dude, we got to do this with real slacks and you have to wear knee high black socks with fucking sock. Garters just like, we'll just do one like this. Jason, can we just do one like this? Um, yeah, dude, you, you did that. You went the real deal on this. So, uh, luckily you got away with it. Um, and I think it's great that everybody knows that she's a fucking whore and do it just affected, look it, she fucked around and immediately tried to put the guilt on you. Then you went down there and beat the shit out of that guy because she's a whore and now she's coming back at you once again, blaming you. So this, this was would have been the, the, uh, the cycle that you would, you would've had if you, if you decided to, uh,

Speaker 2:          00:35:14       share your life with this person, they would constantly be hurting you. And then blaming you saying that you were the reason and I swear to God and you want to fucking awful says guys out there and relationships like that. Just allowing these women to do shit like this. You know, but it's never talked about on TV because it's considered misogynistic because it's not every woman doing it. It's not every woman. That's just the select few. Yeah know. So we're the guys who beat the shit out of women. Those are a select few. Doesn't stop you from talking about it, nor should it.

Mr. Brewer, I love the podcast and would really appreciate some advice regarding my best friend in me. Uh, okay, let's try and guess what this is going. Either your best friend is dating a whore or your best friend is a whore. If your best friend is a whore, why wouldn't you want to fuck her? Why don't I just read it? All right. Let me start with some background information. My best friend and I have known each other since I can remember, but recently I'm almost at the point of losing contact with him because he acts like a fucking idiot over some douchebag. Girl. He's never been a ladies man. So He's been on and off with this one, this one client for quite a while. Oh yeah. He's hanging onto it and he's hanging onto it. That's what he's doing. Yup. He's afraid of, no one's not going to come along and he's clinging to that. That one piece like dead, uh, like Leonardo at the end of a titanic. Um, and he's going to have the same fate. And this girl always used to have a boyfriend, always has to have a boyfriend, cheats on them all the time, not exaggerating, high school dropout. And she loves any drama she can get.

Speaker 2:          00:40:56       Jesus Christ, she loves any drama she can get her grimy, come covered. Hands on. I hate this whore very much. Yeah. In case we didn't understand that with Hulu. First six sentences, uh, there are not enough adjectives in the dictionary or synonyms in the fucking thesaurus to describe this piece of shit. So now to the story, a couple of months ago, she dumped her boyfriend and a day later started dating my best friend. Nobody in our group of friends liked her and she always acted like she was miserable while dating my friend, weeks after them dating, uh, the old cum dumpster is pregnant. Oh, get a paternity test immediately get one of them little Swaby swabs. Uh, he came anyways, he came inside. All right, dude. Jesus, we get it. All right. He based, let me, let me try and clean this up. Uh, he had unprotected sex with there are to completion because she told him it's almost impossible for her to get pregnant. My friend is an idiot for falling for that. So instantly he jumped into marrying this girl it at the age of 19 and dating only three or four weeks. What the fuck? She went to the doctor and they told her she had been pregnant almost two weeks prior to him busting insider and how she

Speaker 2:          00:42:21       and how she acted. She knew this. I don't know how she was acting. She knew this the whole time. Also, the boyfriend before my friend posted inside our many times don't if it obviously, so lo and behold, this slot runs to her ex because he's the dad. So she got the drama. She want it now. Well that's good then. So this kid is not getting stuck with the kid. Now, several months later, my friend is back to talking to this girl and this is where I'm pissed off beyond belief. He still somehow likes this girl that played him, acted like a complete bitch while dating him and cheated on him while dating. He thinks the kid might be his and also said if it is his, he would get back together with her. So the advice I'm asking is,

Speaker 2:          00:43:06       so the advice to you guys, come on man, do a little a proofread here. So the, the advice I'm asking for is how do I tell my friend to quit talking to this pathetic human being and quit being and Douche about thinking about that baby might be his one. Obviously it's not, and move on with his life because that girl will never be happy and never stopped being a cunt. I've tried to tell him to not talk to her and if she wants a paternity test, uh, when it's born to take care of the whole thing. But Bob, I don't even need to read the rest of this. Thanks. Just to bar. I really appreciate your vice and how to get him to stop being a Douche. You can't help him. You can't help this kid. I mean, these aren't little drama moments. This is the biggest drama you could possibly have at 19 when it comes to dating.

Speaker 2:          00:43:50       All right? And um, you would think that after he went through the, Oh my God, she's pregnant and then found out it was somebody else's, that he wouldn't keep coming back. This dude has major fucking problems. He needs to go see a therapist. It's not on you. All right, it's not on you. What are you going to do? You're going to jump in the car with them and try and grab the wheel from him as he pulls back and takes you over the cliff with him. Fuck it. It's not your problem. It's the good fellas moment. He's content to be a jerk. Let them be a jerk. It's out of your hands.

Speaker 2:          00:44:22       You know? And if you don't want to look at it, I would just stop hanging out with them. What do you, what are you supposed to do? What are you spot everybody, you know something, I hate to say this for the most part, everybody has one guy like that and their crew, there's always one guy who going to marry the whore and find out 15 years later that it's not his kid. And you know, and there's going to be one person in your crew that's going to try and tell them that and the kid's going to flip out and not talk to him at all. And that 15 years later they'll run into each other in a bar and be like, hey, you will kinda, you kinda right. So

Speaker 5:          00:44:57       what do you got dope.

Speaker 1:          00:45:00       I mean, what the fuck more does this kid need? He's an idiot. That kid is an idiot, you know, so he might as well Marian idiot. Cause that cancels both of them out and it saves a decent human being on both sides, you know?

Speaker 5:          00:45:16       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:45:17       I, I don't know what to tell you. He's just psyched if anybody will fuck him regardless of the situation. And she's a horse so she knows she, you know, she's fucking his brains out. So

Speaker 5:          00:45:29       yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:45:30       I really don't have anything funny to say about that. That's just, that's fucking awful.

Speaker 2:          00:45:34       It's got to suck for you because that's your friend. But a, you know, you're going to lose some friends in life. I got to tell you, there's, there's, there's a number of different ways you lose friends in life. Uh, you know, the awful ways they die or a, you fuck around with their women or they fuck around with your women. Uh, there's the, you're dating someone who's doing shit like this person. And then there's the other ones where you know, you start doing well in life and they're not, and then they resent you or the other way around. Maybe you're the resentful concept,

Speaker 1:          00:46:12       but you're gonna lose some friends. So you lost one cause you're not going to be able to hang out with this kid anymore. Um, I dunno. Just, I don't know what to tell you, dude. You fuck where the fuck is his dad? Where's his mom? Where are the people like advising this kid? Jesus Christ. I would fucking lock that kid up in the, in the room room above the garage, like a heroin addict and I just keep giving them chicken noodle soup until he got over this fucking chick. Um, I dunno. Jesus. I hope this one's fucking upbeat. Shitty uncle.

Speaker 2:          00:46:55       I'm shitty uncle. Hey belt. I'm a lady listener. And before I jump into it here, I just want to say that as a female listener, I don't have a problem with any of your women trashing. Hey, nice to see someone has a sense of humor. Uh, I think the only women that get offended or insulted by what you talk about are the ones who can relate to or feel they reflect in some way what you're talking about. Ah, sometimes. And then sometimes I am a moron, but I appreciate you, uh, actually seeing that. Um, anyways, maybe you're talking about the gold digging whores or just overall annoyance of women. Clearly that's not all women, but ones who send you shitty feel like you're speaking of them because they are like that. Fuck them. Fuck them. I think it's hilarious. Absolutely ridiculous. When one listener out a thousand takes one thing you talk about and tries to make it personal.

Speaker 2:          00:47:39       What a bunch of cons. You know what, this weekend when I did my show and I closed with my gold digging whores bit, uh, I was selling DVDs afterwards, you know, whoring myself out, showing a little bit of leg as I do. And um, this couple came up in, the woman paid in, some other woman yelled, yelled as she walked by. Yeah. You saw who just pay, you saw just paid. And I used to take the bait on that and I just laughed. I just laughed and it warms my heart knowing that I annoyed the shit out of her with my closing. 10 minute gold digging whore bit. Um, so anyways, here we go. So here's the family problem. I appreciate your perspective on, I've got this absolute absolute asshole. Have an uncle, he's a recovered alcoholic who's landed him self, a wife with money. Jesus, the guy's been a con man since I can remember.

Speaker 2:          00:48:33       It's just that now he's a sober con man. Yeah, I really don't like addicts generally speaking, generally speaking, that some of the most selfish motherfuckers on the planet and they do some of the most inconsiderate shit that you could possibly do. And anytime you call them on it, they always say science. She's got a lot of shit coming out now and they just, a lot of stuff is coming up. Uh, I dunno, I probably get some fucking letters on that. Emails. No one writes letters anymore. So anyways, uh, he's always been a fucking annoying, fucking annoying, an arrogant. But recently he fucked my parents for money. My parents felt heartbroken and betrayed over this. I've always hated him and hate him even more now that he made my mother cry. It made my father angry in order to stay in my father's good graces. He threw my mother and I under the bus in an email to my dad one day saying everything was our fault.

Speaker 2:          00:49:25       I was glad when my father finally told them off and it said not to contact me or my mother again. Well, here's my question. How the fuck did you know that he was a piece of shit con man, before they did a few weeks ago, I had to go to my grandfather's birthday. My mom and dad couldn't make it, so my boyfriend and I went alone. I didn't acknowledge my uncle when I said hi to everyone and kept my distance throughout the day. He kept interrupting any conversation I was having with other relatives to make an obnoxious joke about me or Philly. I live in Philly and love it. My uncle is from Philly, but lives in New York and now is all about it. Yankees, cheesecake and all, uh, he trashes Philly all the time, which pisses me off because he knows I like it there. He even went up to my boyfriend who was wearing an eagle's hat and started talking shit to him. Um, she goes, yeah, I know that might be justified there. Um, everything he did was rude and disrespectful. He never said hello or asked about my mom and dad when I left. I was angry for days and he didn't say anything to him or call him out. So my question to you, bill it, should

Speaker 1:          00:50:28       I say something to my shitty uncle next time he's always been a loud mouth son of a bitch, but, uh, now it's a personal, but now it's personal and fucking rude that he continues to do it. When he knows I know all this shit, sometimes they think he still looks at me as this little girl, Nice Blah, blah. I don't need to read any more of this. What do you think any words of wisdom would help love the podcast? Thanks in advance? Well, what you should have said was you should have announced to the entire Party. My uncle is being rude to me because he fucked my parents out of money. Just something, just throw his fucking throw his dirty laundry right out there.

Speaker 1:          00:51:10       Just say, why are you being rude to me? Why you deliberately being rude to me right now? I don't know. Just weird. You can't like call him like a piece of shit. Um, I don't know. But he won because he made you angry and he ruined your day. Why don't you just be condescending to them where every time he talks to me like, aw, you're adorable. Hey, who'd you fuck over today? You know, I heard they have an old folks home down the street. They like playing checkers. Maybe you can play some checkers, a tinny little tiddlywinks with them and steal their money. You know, just do shit like that. A good joke from the alcoholic over here. Everybody. I would just do stuff like that. Just throw his shit right in his face. No, you know what you do is you say all his shippy just be really nice. Oh my God, my uncle, my favorite relative who's an alcoholic. I got to tell you people, out of all the people who have stolen money from my parents, this guy here is my favorite. Just do shit like that. You just keep complimenting and as you're calling them an absolute piece of shit

Speaker 1:          00:52:19       who can't handle their booze. I still love you. Anyways, I just started drinking a beer right in front of them. Ah, God damn it. Is that delicious? Hey, you want one? C'Mon. You know you do. Oh, that's right. You can't handle it. Who's little baby? Then you just pinch his fat. Fucking booze cheeks. Just I, I would do too. Shit like that. Just annoy him back. But don't sit there in silence and let this guy fucking do that to you. You know, fucking these levels too. God Damn Low. Too Low. Hello? Hello. You know I, I rented that movie to kill a mockingbird. I finally watched that movie and I gotta be honest with you. I don't get it. I don't get that movie.

Speaker 1:          00:53:06       Who's supposed to be the mockingbird in that? Cause the way I look at it, they killed the mockingbird, you know, but then in the end they act like a Robert Duvall character is the mockingbird. He might be another one, but wasn't the guy who was on trial a mockingbird. How come they didn't give a fuck about and I don't buy that. He just ran away and then they shot him. I think that that was that racist shit where they just decided that they were going to kill him. So then they just made up that he ran away. So this is what I like to do, people to close out the podcast. I like to bring up a movie that came out, oh 60 70 fucking years ago. And uh, talk about it like it came out like fucking six months ago. Oh Jesus. I'm sorry. Let's, let's, let's, let's finish up here with, with a one last little advertisement.

Hey, can anybody tell me why dog sleeps so fucking much? They'll put it, they won't, they'll put in eight hours and then you take them around the block and then they sleep for like another four hours and they get all antsy around noontime. You take them out again and then they just plopped down and then they have one more burst of energy and then they're ready to sleep for another eight hours. Isn't that what, like all wild animals do like don't like lines for the most part. Just laying around all day,

Speaker 5:          00:56:57       you know,

Speaker 2:          00:56:58       and I guess he got to go kill something and they go and they kill something. They fucking gorge themselves and they just lay around in the sun for like the next three Aa sleeping. Isn't that what they do? You know somebody down the street. I have to whisper because somebody down the street, they, uh, they bought two giant lions, um, to have outside the house. You know, like the fake lions. It basically, it just screams new money. You know what I mean? That's like one of the, one of the first things you do,

Speaker 2:          00:57:29       like the avid shithead who hits the lottery, you know what they're gonna do, right? They're going to get a limo, go boobs, and they're going to buy a car, maybe pay off one bill. Right? And then the very next thing they're gonna do is they're going to buy two giant fucking lions to stand guard at the end of the driveway of their fucking apartment building. I don't know why people do that, but these ones were actually decent. They were actually decent looking. Um, all right, here's the upcoming events. I have a, my next row gig isn't until June 15th. He fucking serious. Juge Oh, I guess I'll be in La, building up my act, uh, the San Jose Improv on June 15th and June 16th. And on the 17th, it says San Jose Improv, but we got to fix that. I'm actually going to be at the, uh, Chicago theater with Steve Byrne, Vince Vaughn and all these other guys.

Speaker 2:          00:58:21       I don't know who else is going to be there, but that's enough of a show right there, isn't it? June 17th the Chicago theater. Um, oh and June 15th and 16th, I'll also be performing with a Chelsea Peretti Sacramento zone. Chelsea Peretti. So, you know, she's psyched to get up there. That's why she's doing the Gig. You know, she wants to drive and go see family up in northern California. Um, Ontario Improv. I played June 29th, 30th and July 1st Hampton beach ballroom casino going white trash here, people July 14th. Then I go to the new Newport yachting center July 15th and I know what you're thinking there. Oh, is that the Illuminati comedy club? No, it is not. It's a parking lot with a tent over it. And I'll be performing. There was some sort of makeshift air conditioner, pathetically trying to blow cold air on my giant forehead. And then my triumphant retort returned to New York City, July 26th, 27th, 28th and 29th at on Broadway

Speaker 1:          00:59:22       in New York, New York. Then we're into September and football season and I'm going to be doing cities that I have never done before. Like Orlando Eight, ninth, seventh, eighth and ninth. Look at that. Orlando, Florida. Um, that's it. That's the podcast for this week. Go fuck yourselves. Um, thank you to everybody who's been listening. The podcast has been growing. Thanks everybody has been going on to amazon.com game, fly.com and stamps, stamps.com uh, appreciate it. I don't know when I'll ever see any money from any of these things. It's amazing how this advertising works. You know the advertise and then like nine months later they, they finally send you a check, you know. Thank you for your wonderful work hyping the new palm pilot back in 2001. Um, all right. That's it. Is there anything that they, any shit I wanted to talk about any sports? Um, hey bill, who do you like for the fucking Nba Championship?

Speaker 1:          01:00:19       Anybody but the Lakers? Anybody but the Lakers, uh, who do I like for the Stanley Cup? Um, I like a lot of the teams. I like a lot of teams that are playing each other. Like I like, uh, I sort of like the capital's, I liked the rangers. I like the flyers. I don't like the devils. I'll never get over that boring style of play that got them three Stanley cups that left wing Loc trap defense during the clutch and grab error made me almost abandoned the game. And for some reason I blame them when I know people played that for years. Um, so I can't get into them. Um, although I do think it's funny that they went, oh, Stanley cups right across the river from fucking New York. That does make me laugh. So in a pinch, if I had to vote, vote, vote, vote for either, uh, that was vote or in route at the same time, if I had to vote for a Jersey or the rangers, that's a tough one range.

Speaker 1:          01:01:19       Is it just such a legendary club, even though they haven't, they've won won Stanley Cup and 72 fucking years. Uh, I still like him though. I like the fly is I'd like to see the St Louis Blues and I would say I'd like to see the La Kings if they're fucking fans, weren't also Laker fans. You know, I just, I don't know. I'm so fucking sick, you know, you know, depressing. It was to go back to Boston and run into the, the fucking morons that I did for the most part am I met nice people, but just a couple of those. It was just so fucking depressing because I loved going back to Boston because as far as a sports fan, I've been, I've been behind enemy lines since when I left in 1995 I went to New York City and I live in La. So I haven't had to deal with Yankee fans, jets, fans, and now Laker fans.

Speaker 1:          01:02:06       And I just want to go to a place where can I can, I can express affection for my teams and not have to immediately get into some sort of fucking debate. And then I go back there and then it's, it's just that Shit, you know? And I know now that I admitted that those things happened in Boston. Now I'm going to get a bunch of holier than thou fucking emails from people, but you have to understand that I've traveled for 20 years as a comedian, and I've done the third show Saturday night and a, and I've talked to those people. So I bring it, do you want to fucking talk down to me? Why am I defending box? I can't defend it. I can't defend it, but you know, I dunno. I don't know what the fuck I'm saying. All right, that's the podcasts. Go Fuck Yourself. I'll talk to you next week.
