Speaker 1:          00:00:01       Hey, what's going on as bill burn? It's the Monday morning podcast for Monday, December 29th, 2014 this is about as loud as I'm going to get. By the way. I might even bring it down here. You know what I'm saying? Oh, today, last week it was a rough one. It, oh. Um, I actually, uh, have a bunch of relatives over at my house and they're still sleeping because, uh, you know, they went out last night and I'm an old man. I'm an old man. I was in bed my fucking 10 30 fucking Versie called me driving back from the clubs. I think I fell asleep twice during his conversation and it was funny. He was like, I would wake back up to him going like, oh, did I lose you? And I would wake up and I would immediately lie and just be like, no, no, no. I'm listening. I'm listening. And I woke up this morning mad at myself. Like, why did I feel the need to lie there? What am I practicing for when like, I really need to lie.

Speaker 1:          00:01:03       What's wrong with saying, yeah, I fell asleep. Was I concerned about Paul versus failings like Paul, I find you so boring that I was wide awake at the beginning of that sentence and by the end of it I was asleep. That wasn't the case. It was late at night. I was an old man. I had a big steak dinner. Oh my God. Oh, belly fat face is fucking back. All right. I have been eating like a fucking maniac. I've been cooking bacon like a little twinkle toes there and I've just been shoving everything down my pie hole. Oh fat face. Billy is back. Like you remember when they did back to the future of the sequels, they shot part two and part three at the same time. That's how my fat face is coming back. It's like I'm, I'm making part two and part three once you make bill none of your fucking business, but I'll tell you anyways, and I'm actually, I'm actually gonna make a a a Turkey pot pie today.

Speaker 1:          00:02:01       I'm like, you know, it's fucking, you know, it's cold out. I'm a pussy now. At this point, it's like 58 degrees. I'm like, oh my God, this little Cho, I love some Turkey pot pie and I'm going to go out in the kitchen. I'm going to put on it. This is, this is how far I've changed since you guys are listen to this podcast, I'm going to unapologetically walk out into my kitchen, put on a fucking apron. All right, and I'm gonna, I'm gonna try this. I'm trying to make a flaky crust. We think about that. You know what I love how uncomfortable it's making you right now, not you, the other people. You're not uncomfortable. I don't give a fuck. But the rest of you, the rest of you, people are so fucking homophobic. You can't listen to another man say flaky crust. I'm going to say it again. I'm going to go out in the kitchen. I'm going to put on an apron and I'm gonna make a flaky

Speaker 2:          00:02:52       the crust.

Speaker 1:          00:02:58       And I

Speaker 2:          00:03:00       have, I'm actually sort of embarrassed at the level of excitement that I have to fucking try this, this thing out, because I usually just use shortening. I never use bottom. So we'll see how it works out. Other than that, the fucking, the inside is the fucking easiest, right? What do you got to, yeah, you got the trinity of Fucking Shit, right? The evil fucking what do you got? Your carrots, your salary. You fucking Alec Onions, right? You stick them in some butter, right? Make sure they're clear fucking store. I'm a little bit, then you had some other bullshit of the other bullshit, right? And then you throw it in the fucking the crust there. You got many, put it in there and you tell everybody, get out in the kitchen and fucking eat something. All right. And then as they say, oh my God, this is delicious. You feign a humility. Well, you know, just something, I just flipped it up. Yours. Oh, did you like it all? That's great. That's great. Let me leave the room so you can guys can all talk about how awesome I am.

Speaker 1:          00:03:56       All right, I'm being too loud here, being too loud, my own fucking house. Um, but this is what I've actually done a cave. If you're like me right now and you are in the depths of a sugar, salt downward spiral. Okay. And you're waking up in the morning like that classic Stevie Ray Vaughan Story. Ever hear that story when he was so like addicted to alcohol and drugs. It was like four in the morning and he's standing in an alley somewhere in Europe and he's puking up blood. And when he's done, he looks at his buddy and he said, I needed it

Speaker 2:          00:04:32       drink.

Speaker 1:          00:04:35       That's how I feel right now with this fucking the shit that I've been eating, you know? And I've actually traced it back and went back to that pork chop I had. That's what threw me off the rails. I was doing well. And then I had a fucking pork chop with and I gave it a little butter Beth. And that was it. It sounded so fucking gay. I know. I gave a butter Beth to a pork chop and um, put it in a little in his little fucking towels with the Hoodie on it that you do for a baby. I did that to my little pork chop.

Speaker 1:          00:05:12       I don't know why. I'm doing this to you guys. It's like I hate myself. So I want to make you guys uncomfortable with all these horrible fucking images. I'm sorry. All right, Jesus, that's gotta be a record five minutes in. I'm already apologizing to you. So, um, so I've done been doing this weird thing where I've been eating like shit yet forcing myself to go work out and uh, you know, when you're eating like shit and you're trying to work out, your body's just like, dude, I don't want to fucking do this. You know, if you're eating the right, your body's like fucking dragging you down there. So, um, I'm doing that awful middle aged guy thing where I'm eating like, Shit, dude, I did one day, I think it was two nights ago. I'm sitting around, you know, it's the usual thing, right? The trees look, you know, looking sad because everyone stopped watering it, right?

Speaker 1:          00:06:04       The Christmas tree really lives the life of a fucking boy band. You know what I mean? It's discovered and it's a fucking star. And then it's over and it all goes down in like a month. So now my tree sitting and starting to wilt, right. There's a bunch of leftovers in the fridge. Everybody's just fucking passed out in a food coma in every different room. You mean everybody's just so fucking, it's literally like you're in a crack house, but it's food and everybody's just fucking passed out all over. You didn't, you don't even know half the people's names and your house in any sense of a schedule. It's just, it's just, there's no, everybody's sitting down to eat dinner. That was too long, days ago. Now it's just, just eat whenever and I fucking for dinner one night I had, I had two Boddington's to Guinness. Um, and then on an assortment of dumplings from leftover Chinese food, one chicken, one Veggie, one pork. We had three orders and I had to one or two of each of those with those four fucking stout beers.

Speaker 1:          00:07:18       And then with the Chinese food, I was so full of salt. I grabbed a slice of Pecan Pie, put whipped cream on the top of it and shove that down my pie hole. And then for the rest of the night for no reason that I could explain medically my face was hot. I was like, I was walking around, nothing embarrassing was happening, but I felt like I was embarrassed. Maybe it was, I was embarrassed about what the fuck I was eating. And then, then the fucking kicker is I then went out and did stand up and I'm on stage with a hot face feeling doing my standup and basically a walking sugar coma. And um, so yesterday I decided, I'm like, you know, I got to get out in front of this fucking thing. All right, around, I'm going to have to roll myself down the walk to get the mail soon. So I, uh, I forced myself, I forced myself to go, uh, to go to this fucking place that serves salads and that type of shit. And I swear to God, man, that just fucking, it breaks you like cold Turkey. You get that stuff in you and you're just like, oh yeah, that's right. That's right. So this morning I woke up,

Speaker 1:          00:08:36       did a quick walk around the block, banged out a hundred pushups and 60 dips and I'm back in the fucking game back in the fucking game. Am I? No, not really. I just slice a pint of whiskey before you went to bed last night. Fucking late doing anyways, this is the Monday podcast. And um, I find it hilarious how many people get annoyed when I sit here and talk about food and Diet and that type of thing. But I think it's actually funny and it's also, I know a lot of you guys are going through the same shit. And the thing that I've learned is you have to mentally push through the shit. You know, you have to go downstairs and work out, you know, you've got to stop B, you got to listen to your fucking brain, not your body that's doing the John Travolta sweat hogs. Give me drugs, give me drugs.

Speaker 1:          00:09:24       Um, anyways, but now the construction is finally done on my house. And last night, um, uh, not last night. A couple of days ago, I was able to clean out my garage for the first time in fucking forever. So listen to this ship. This is how it cleaned out the garage. I didn't sweep around shit. I took everything out of the fucking garage. Everything all right. And then I went in and I swept that thing up like um, like you know, as much as I could get up. Cause it's, it's just, it's a garage, you know, and I had like fucking three giant piles of like sod does, cause you know, you have construction on your home after like two, three days. The construction workers, they don't even see it as your home anymore. It's just their place now. They've just staked their claim and they'll leave and fucking, you know, coffee cups in the old ratty sweatshirts all over the fucking place.

Speaker 1:          00:10:20       So they started using my garage to cut shit up and I'm just sitting there like, I don't give a fuck where you cut it up. Just get the God damn job done. Right. So I had like six months of saw dust and shit in there. Got All of that out. Then I brought the garden hose and spray down the whole fucking floor. I had gone to home depot and bought one of those fucking squeegees that has a giant mop handle, right? And then after that brought in a bucket with soap and water and fucking mop the whole place up and then host it back down and squeegee it out again. Right. Cleaned it out like a fucking marine could eat. You could eat off the fucking floors. All right. Then I brought everything back. I had one pallet left from my fucking DVDs and I kept that thing in case any water gets in there and I got rid of a bunch of Shit, put the rest of Shit and containers.

Speaker 1:          00:11:14       Got It all neatly over in the corner. Now I got to hope place where I can work out. The whole fucking thing is great and I'm sitting there in the end all excited, right? Like at the end of a fucking beer commercial and I'm looking around, I'm like clean fucking garage and all of a sudden I see all the way over in the other corner. I see all this black shit on the wall. I've got a white wall and I see this fuck. It looks like a streak of Greece in a really weird for him. Like what the fuck is that? How did I miss that? So I walk over there to see what it is and I walk up to the wall and I find out it's like fucking 10,000 little

Speaker 3:          00:11:54       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:11:54       That came up from the foundation when I sprayed the water. These are the ones that survived, you know, the great flood or some shit. You know, there's probably some reporter aunt down there staying in the water with the fucking trenchcoat reporting live, but the rest of 'em all fucking screwed and went up the wall. And I just sat there looking at him, go, what do I do now? Huh?

Speaker 3:          00:12:14       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:12:15       Do I get raid and just complete the fucking holocaust of this ant hill or should I fucking, you know, they just fucking ants, right? I'll just let him go.

Speaker 1:          00:12:30       Oh, you know what? I just got a fucking text message. I could have fucking predicted this. I could have fucking predicted this. I just let me get this, this guy to be sorry, we beat your patriots. I swear to God. I, if this comes from shred and Reagan who lives out in buffalo shred and Reagan, those two fucking pussies, they are the absolute worst and that probably playing this audio right now, giggling like a couple of school girls, they are the absolute worst. You're going to brag about beating the Patriots. Tom Brady didn't even play in the second half. You assholes. We had to put in our fucking second stringer. Who Was it? Jimmy Garafalo. We had Janine Gruffalos, younger brother playing quarterback and you finally beat us. You fucking assholes. Yeah, they're the worst. You know what's funny? I was actually going to compliment the buffalo bills because they were kicking our ass when Tom Brady was in there.

Speaker 1:          00:13:28       So there's a lot of ways, if I was a buffalo bills fan, I could say that, uh, if I was you, I'd be like, no. You guys knew you were going to lose. So then you did like that. That pussy video game thing with a person just quits and says, well, I wasn't even trying, you know, that fucking move. Um, I had no idea that the, uh, the bills had that kind of a defense. So man, they got like two guys of course, I don't know the fucking names. Um, two guys that have like, you know, double digit stack sacks and they had another guy had like five or six, probably had but like nine by the end of the game with the Patriots. But um, you know, if they could just get a Goddamn quarterback out there, who's kidding, who if they, if they weren't the buffalo bills, you know, and I'm not saying that in a disrespectful way, I'm just being honest. Okay. Having been there as a fan, I lived through all the years of, if we weren't the New England patriots, we would have picked the right guy. And uh, thank God Robert Kraft came along, who I would say is going to be, that guy is going to be in the hall of fame as an owner, without a doubt. Do you realize that guys, the guy has been there for 20 fucking years.

Speaker 1:          00:14:36       He's gone to the Super Bowl six times. He's got three victories.

Speaker 3:          00:14:42       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:14:43       He's three coaching hires. Our Bill Parcells Pete Carroll and bill Belicheck. It's getting to the point if Pete Carroll Ha, I mean Pete Carroll, if Robert Kraft hires you as a head coach, that's like a automatically a plus on your resume. So I believe the bills have new ownership and uh, you know, hopefully that'll work out for it. Cause he, I I really don't, I don't wish ill will on any fans unless they're just ridiculous cons. Um, like New York Yankee fans were for all those years where they chanted 19, 18, 1918 and all that, which I get curse of the bay, which I get, but then when we beat him in 2004, they all ran and hid and none of them would answer their fleets, all the Yankee fans, I know none of them would answer their fucking phones.

Speaker 1:          00:15:36       And then they did that. Yeah. Bullshit. What were you go 26? You actually made a t shirt? 26 to six. I mean that was some Colby Bryan Shit check does it to what is wrong with you? Just take the loss, you know. Anyways. Um, so I'm actually, uh, you know, I was actually, that was happy for bills fans. There's certain fans, you know, they, they've suffered enough. Like what did San Diego charger fans due to the football gods. I hated charge your fans after the one game I went to and was basically cause one douche bag behind me and I realized that was wrong because I know some other people gone down there and they said they had a good time. But generally speaking, I got to tell your fans on the west coast and California that fucking animals, fucking animals take it way too seriously.

Speaker 1:          00:16:30       You know what I mean? Look at the shift that's happened that people get stabbed, they get shot. You beat up a fucking dad who's sitting there with his two kids and now he's brain dead. That's the fucking west coast man animals. Um, but I still, I don't wish any, uh, I don't wish ill will on charge of fans. I actually was a huge fan of that. Back when Dan Fouts, Charlie joiner, a west Jan left, Caitlin and Winslow Jesus Christ, racking my brain, chuck Muncie Louis Culture. All right, dude. He's got shy 16 quadrapalegic clique. He's a poor man's John Matousek. Um, oh, by the way, I'm all over the fucking place today. Uh, New Year's Day, New Year's Day, the NFL network is running a series of, uh, what is it? Football life, you know, behind the jock strap, whatever the fuck they call it. I don't know what the fuck it's called, but, uh, they're doing one on [inaudible] and a, and a bunch of other people. Warren Moon's going to be a good one. That's, that'll be a good one. Cause that'll deal with like racism in the NFL and why he wasn't fucking drafted. And he had to go to the CFL and basically break every record 9 million times, and then they finally let him into the NFL and he's got to play with the fucking Houston Oilers. One of my favorite things Warren moon ever said was when they, when, um, when the

Speaker 1:          00:17:50       Houston Oilers defense was calling the astrodome the house of pain and they kept saying that say in the house of Payne and he finally said to the defense because he was older than all of those punk kids at that point, he goes, look, stop fucking saying that. Okay cause I'm the one that has to pay the price for your shit talking. Cause basically the other difference would come in and be like, oh well we'll show you what the house of pain is and then they'd be taken extra fucking shots at Warren Moon. And you know, the defense, they don't have to take any shots. They dish out the punishment. Um, which is why I've told you for a zillion times, I've always hated when a, when a, when a cornerback lights up a fucking receiver and then stands over them like ray rice over his fiance. You know, it's like

Speaker 4:          00:18:35       the,

Speaker 1:          00:18:37       the fucking guy, the wide receiver is running full speed, jumps in the air and is looking back in the other direction, trying to catch a flying object. Gee, did you lay 'em out? You know, I dunno. I mean I like a big hit like anybody else, but uh, that whole standing over him like you guys squared off touch gloves and then you fucking knock them off. You know, I don't know if you want to see a great fucking flight. Oh flight, great fun. I should say. Sorry, I'm all fucking full of sugar, so I'm extra add in whatever the fuck else I got going on here. Um, anybody watched the a Bruins, Columbus blue jackets game and we lost six to two hold. Let me tell it was a Ralph Lauren, you know, um,

Speaker 1:          00:19:21       fucking Lucita fought this Guy Dalton proud. I guess it was his third bout. I don't know how I missed the first two, but if you just want to see two fucking guys, just two warriors going at it. I mean, it is, it's just a fucking great fight. And I'm not one of these guys in the end. Cause Lou Cheech got in the last punch in, landed on top of them. I hate when hockey fans think that that means it's a victory. When Lou Cheech took a bunch of big shots too. It was just a fucking heavyweight bout.

Speaker 4:          00:19:50       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:19:50       They fought during the right time of the game. They didn't hurt either team. It was just a fucking old school. Two heavyweights just beaten the shit. I mean it was, it was fucking amazing. I felt like less of a man watching it, you know, it's curl on my knees up into my chest, Jesus of hitting each other so hard. Um, that was fucking awesome. So I'm going to uh, definitely post the link to the one from that I just watched last night. Um, I tape all the Bruins games and sometimes, uh, there's something else on it. I can only take so much shit cause I have the old school. You can only take two things at once. So it was a little bit behind, but I'll, I'll have all three of those back to the future. One, two and three with the [inaudible]. Man, it's, I'm not album.

Speaker 1:          00:20:39       I'm saying that guy's name, right? I'll say Dalton because I don't want to disrespect the man. Uh, water. Fuck it. I'm just a fucking great fight. Awesome. Um, why wasn't I watching the Bruins verse the Blue Jackets? Because I started watching Boston college versus Penn state in the, uh, looking up your skirt bowl, whatever the fuck they were playing in. It was something really weird. The pen and pencil set bull. I mean, it's one of the fucking, you know, one of those fucking bowls. So we're in this guy damn thing. We got these fuckers beat. They can't move the ball. 21 seven. We're up. It's fucking over their quarterback. You know, he rolls it back. You know, looking like a fuck it, it's got that good looking Gerber baby face going on, right. He throws the ball right at our defensive back. The guy goes to slap it down.

Speaker 1:          00:21:33       He tips it up in the fucking Penn state guy catches a 2114. Oh, this was the night I had the four beers. That fucking dumplings in the piece of Pie. So I kind of blacked out. I want the fuck happened. The sugar, salt coma. Next thing I know it's 2121 goes into overtime and my good friend Paul Versey hates the extra point. He wants to get rid of the extra point or cause he think he's like, dude, it's so fucking stupid. They make it 99.9% of the time. And I'm sitting there going, yeah, but it's the times that they miss it. That makes it worth it because it's so fucking dramatic. And uh, that's what happened in fucking bit me in the ass this time as a fan. Fucking BC goes down over time, gets the ball in, poses their wealth. Let's their presence be known or whatever fucking sports cliche you want to fucking hear about. They go down, score a touchdown and their kicker goes out and basically he fucking hook this thing so bad. I can't believe he didn't hit himself in the face with the ball. Was he a lefty? Maybe. I don't know what the fuck if he shanked it or whatever the fuck you want to call it. He misses the thing. So we only get six points.

Speaker 3:          00:22:43       All right.

Speaker 1:          00:22:45       The fucking Penn state gets the ball and then they just drive right down the field. They score a touchdown and then kick the fucking next to point and then they're fucking kicker starts running down the field. Like he just kicked a 70 yard, which made it even more painful to watch. Here's my question. I just realized as I was telling that story, I thought it, if you scored a touchdown and overtime it was over, but if you kicked a field goal, the other team got to have like equal amount of possessions. Wasn't that how it was or is it always you, you know you get equal possessions or is it you at least get one possession each? I can't fucking remember cause I was just trying to think. There was a, because we missed the extra point that they got the blood pressure, you get equal possessions. I don't fucking know. So whatever. So I made fun of that Penn state guy running, or they're just, you know, just, I didn't make fun of the guy. And somebody writes, writes to me on Twitter, I'm man wrote this to me. He wrote, um, dot. Dot. He's only like

Speaker 5:          00:23:46       the best field goal kicker in college football. Dude, a grown man wrote, um, dot. Dot. Dot. I can't stand these fucking guys on Twitter that tweet like fucking preteen girls. Jesus fucking Christ I and, and what, what's wrong with me that, that fucking annoys me that much and I have to make that point to him. I, you know what? I'm the asshole. Fuck that guy. If you want to go on like maybe next time. Wait, what? If you want to do that? Go ahead and fucking, I'm, you know, I'm gonna try to be less of a cut in 2015. All right, but it's only December 29th. So I got another two days of this shit, so fucking get used to it. All right, let's do a little, uh, a little advertise in here. Uh, live reads old Geez issue. Um, oh look who's back here.

Speaker 1:          00:29:42       I cleaned out the garage. Oh, here's, here's a weird thing I had this morning, right? I fucking um,

Speaker 4:          00:29:50       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:29:51       I uh, somebody delivered, they, somebody delivered a package, ever get a package and it's not for you, it's for somebody else, but they live on the same number. Like you live on one, two, three Smith Street and they live on one, two, three Allen Street. And it's like fucking, uh, you know, it's like a mile away or something. And I'm thinking I could, you know what, what am I going to do here? I could fucking,

Speaker 1:          00:30:17       you know, I could fucking just give this to the post office person, right. And be like, this doesn't belong to us. You take it, but then what? It's December 29th when you think this person's going to get it. Once it goes back into the systems system, all those fucking maniacs down there, this guy's going to get this thing or this lady is going to get this thing after New Year's Day. Alright, I Google search the person's house. I've done this like three fucking times. Um, I've actually gotten in my car and just driven it over to the person's house. And then there's always that weird point is you're walking up there, walk thinking like, am I going to get shot? And they're always psyched. You know, the first time I did it, I walked up and the lady came walking out of the house and I got freaked out. I was just like, Hey, they accidentally delivered this to my house. She was like, oh right. That's what she did. Then she just froze just like that.

Speaker 1:          00:31:10       And I kinda like moved my hand in front of him and she just was like catatonic. She was so fucking happy. Then I skipped back to my Prius and I drove away. And that's the end of that story. So anyways, I, uh, so I'm like, all right, I'm going on a fucking walk this morning. Good to try to walk off some of the whiskey and pie I ate right before I went to sleep. Fucking pig and a, I'll bring it over to this person's house. I see. It's like two fucking miles away. Am I going two miles over, two miles back? There's a four or five mile walk, if you know, whatever, that's good thing. Burn off some calories. So I fucking walk over to this place

Speaker 6:          00:31:44       and uh,

Speaker 1:          00:31:47       it's a little ways up into the hills and shit. And I get there and it turns out it's like a gated community and I got this stupid fucking box and I'm like, what am I going to do in the fucking house? Was like one house into the gated community. So I'm like, well, what do I do? I can't leave it at the gate. I don't want, I'll fucking walk this thing all the way back. Do I throw it over the fence and try to get it to the driveway? What if this is broken it? Then I just looked and they had like they had the defense went like across the street and then there was a brick wall with a ledge on it and the fence went up on that and I was just like, you know what? I could be up and over this thing, drop off the package and backup and over before even has a chance to call anybody. I don't want to lug this fucking thing back. So then by myself, I start laughing like a schoolgirl. I'm looking for cameras. I don't see any, and I'm like, this is fucking so fucking climbed up over it and my heart's racing. I'm already rehearsing. What I'm going to say to the cop?

Speaker 7:          00:33:01       Well what two three [inaudible] street? This was for a kid

Speaker 1:          00:33:06       like, you know, am I going to get arrested for this shit? I got this fucking like ridiculous stupid Bruins sweatshirt on. That's like black. It's not even gold. Like I think it's like a knock off. It's like yellow almost. You could spot me a million miles away and I'm on foot if anybody calls the cops. But I did it, dropped it off right back up and over. The whole thing took like maybe fucking 20 seconds and I walked away laughing and rehearsing what I was going to say to the cop and nothing happens. And so they go and you know what, that's my good deed for the day. My good deed for the day. So they got, don't ever let gay communities a fucking hilarious and the most

Speaker 4:          00:33:49       okay,

Speaker 1:          00:33:50       they look, there's nobody guarding it. That's what I realized is just a fence. And then you got these people who are too dumb to become a police officer, you know, you know, too lazy to walk around a mall. They just want to sit in a truck. What are they doing? They were rubbing their balls and they're on Twitter. They're not paying attention. I literally could have taken that fence down, you know, and just dragged it over to home depot and sold it from metal scrap. I think it would still take two hours before anybody even showed up. I lost all respect for gated communities, gated community. The fuck are you doing in there? How you're sacrificing virgins. You know how fucking crook I could see like look,

Speaker 4:          00:34:41       okay,

Speaker 1:          00:34:42       I shouldn't say this, but I think only women should live in gated communities. Like if you're like a pop star and you have like a fucking stalker and shit, you know, you should be behind them. But I think if you're a man, you should fight your stalker right in your front yard. Kick his ass, running your front lawn. You know, fun kid. That's actually a dangerous subject to talk about. I'm fucking with you. Um, AH, Jesus. Blame it on the pie bill. Oh, I want to thank all the cons. Who sent me shit because another, a Singapore airline a is now missing. You know, putting that in my fucking head. Like, are you, aren't you afraid to go over there? Now? Actually know what the odds, the odds are pretty fucking good. You know, odds are pretty good that they just lost one. I don't even hit me with that fucking, uh, rules of three's a. So my fucking buddy to a Michigan Fan texting me here. I think the news is milking it while Michigan and harbor is being considered to the niners players. I'll lean into, okay, Jim Harbaugh,

Speaker 2:          00:35:47       ball ball, ball, ball, ball, ball ball.

Speaker 1:          00:35:51       Oh is the only way to play drums to that shit.

Speaker 2:          00:35:55       Door. Door. Door. The door.

Speaker 1:          00:35:58       All right. Classic White fucking beat. You fucking clap on all four beats.

Speaker 5:          00:36:03       Clap, clap, clap, clap, clap, clap, clap, clap, clap, clap, clap, clap, clap, clap.

Speaker 1:          00:36:09       Where? Fuck and white. And we bought some to buzz today. Um, you might be going to the University of Michigan, which should be great for the big 10, whatever. And they know they got like 15 fucking teeth now. That would be great for the big 10. It is not good for the big 10. When Michigan's not good. You Need Ohio state and Michigan to be good. You need them to beat the fuck out of each other. And then you know, everybody else falls in the line. I'm sorry, Michigan State. I'm sorry. Wisconsin. Alright. Wisconsin. You had your day, you went to three fucking rose bowls in a row and you did a great impression of the early nineties buffalo bills. Okay. I want it to you guys to win. I was rooting for you. When you play tacy you come on frogs and you know what you did? You fucked me. You fucked me three years in a row.

Speaker 3:          00:36:59       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:37:00       All right, so it's going to be a long while before I, I root for that fucker. Giant red w again.

Speaker 3:          00:37:05       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:37:07       Even though we've got a good now the badgers, that's a great fucking name. I don't hate Wisconsin. I was just fucking sick of watching them coming in. They're all fucking cheesy and pasty and all that cheesy pasty fucking fans and they just walking out with their heads hanging down low, you know.

Speaker 3:          00:37:21       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:37:22       Sitting there with a handful of fucking blue cheese in one hand and some fucking Cheddar and the other, you know, dabbin their cheers with some tears with some Kraft slices. Oh Geez. Um, all right. So, you know what a lot of people told me that, uh, they'd rather listen to me talk about music then sports. So I figured I'd talk about sports for 35 fucking minutes. I also talked about food. I go, fuck yourself. Start Your own podcast. Um, I finally had some downtime and old law.

Speaker 3:          00:37:54       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:37:55       Oh, Billy boy here is uh, got back into playing drums. I want to do another one of those goddamn comedy jams coming up. So I'm working on a song, can't say which song it is, but it has double bass in it. And old Billy is not a double bass player. So, um, I've actually been, uh, I've been woodshedding as they say, I'm playing drums trying to get it down. And I mean, I don't know. I was one of those fucking assholes. I just totally got way into John Bonham when I was playing and my brothers both played guitar and they weren't into Metallica and that type of shit. And they were like, get a double pedal, get a double bass, get another bass drum. Let's fucking do that. And I, I kind of look back, wished I did, but, um, I didn't play it because, uh, I dunno, I had this competitive fucking thing and Bonham's bass drum foot was faster than mine and I was like, I'm not getting a double bass pedal until I can play good times, bad times with a single base drum pedal and

Speaker 3:          00:38:51       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:38:52       And this is like back, you know, this is the 80s, so I have no help. I have to just basically listened to the record of the tape and try to figure out what he's doing as opposed to all the kids today. You can just fucking go on youtube and there'll be some 20 year pro show you that slide step fucking thing. I had no idea, man. I was fucking my foot up trying to figure out how the hell he was doing it. Right. So anyways, I started, I know I didn't play drums for like 10 years when I started doing comedy and I moved to New York City's, you know, drums that you can't like strum a fucking set of drums in your apartment in New York. Trust me. So, um, I didn't play until, uh, I got more established as a comedian. I was able to afford one of those electronic drum kits, the, uh, the Roland ones, which were fucking amazing then forget about now. And I'm thinking about getting another one just for in the house, so I won't drive me nuts. But, uh,

Speaker 1:          00:39:46       was I gonna say, so I remembered how I just got so obsessed with John Bonham that it really affected my plank. Cause I just sounded like another guy who just listened to bond them. And then all the players that were into were derivative of John Bonham. So then I would have just go back to his playing again. I just couldn't get out of this fucking vortex. It just listening to the same fucking guy. So I went out and I bought a double pedal like 10, 12 years ago, that DW 5,000, you know what the red plate on the bottom. And, um, I go, you know, I was listening to the Primus and I got, you know, listen to old Metallica and I tried to get into it and I gave it a shot and I went right back to the bottom thing. And um, but made sure that I expanded what I listened to, uh, since then.

Speaker 1:          00:40:32       But uh, so I've dusted this fucking thing off. I mean, I still have it in the case. I got all this, all the attachments, all of that Shit I've made sure like, like hate when people sell stuff, all musical equipment and they fucking, they don't have all the original shit to it. You know, like even my truck, I got this old truck and you know, they, the radiators back then ran a little hot. So, uh, then aluminum runs run better. So put a new aluminum one in and I kept the old one. And when we switched out the front brakes, I went from drum to disc. I still kept the drum brakes, actually learned how to put those fucking things together. I bought all the tools in that shit and I kept all of it. You know, had somebody put a new rear end in it and uh, I fucking, I have all of the, I have all those parts. I kept all of that shit. I have the old masters cylinder. So anyways, I've been, um, I've been playing a lot of double bass right now

Speaker 1:          00:41:29       and this song is actually, if you're double bass player is actually a simple song to play, but if he'd never played it, it's just so fucking weird. So I've been literally just sitting there, uh, you know, 60 bpms ticket ticket ticket, ticket back and ticket ticket, ticket ticket to get the good, take a packet, they get thicker, thicker, 70 digging, digging, digging, digging, development. I can't play it that fast, but whatever, just trying to work my way up. So the songs at about 115 bpms and I'm about up to like 95 and I got two weeks to go. So, uh, I went to a Mike's lessons.com. Um, he doesn't play double based too much shit on that, but you know, he's got, it's just the best site. It's just as far as his practice, like that technique where it's a, see, this is why I don't talk fucking drums in that type of shit cause I know it right now.

Speaker 1:          00:42:18       Everybody's just fucking so I feel like I'm teaching like geography right now. I don't know where. Um, but if you're a drummer out there, Mike's lessons.com, I cannot recommend it highly enough. Um, and you want to talk about God with a sick fucking bass drum foot. He's fucking unbelievable. Um, so anyways, and you know what? This actually gets me, somebody asked me about what I, what I thought about, um, what I thought about whatever that fucking movie was, where the uh, whiplash, here we go. Let's do some questions here. Uh, dear bill, hope he had a great holiday and I loved the show. Thank you. My question is, have you seen the film whiplash? It's about a student and a music conservatory trying to become the next great jazz drummer. A Jk Simmons plays his music teacher slash. Mentor, but the movie flips around all the usual music, movie tropes.

Speaker 1:          00:43:14       Simmons acts more like a drill sergeant and screams and intimidates the students to push them further. I don't want to say much more because the movie speaks for itself, but I know you'll love it. Especially given your affinity for drums. The movie also raises a more general question. Are the all time greats in any field born or can they be made thoughts? Um, Eh, great fucking question. Um, I thought what's his face? Jk Simmons was unbelievable in that movie. Uh, but I love drums. So watching him scream and yell at somebody who also loved drums was like, I kinda had a hard time watching it. It'd be like if I was watching a movie about standup and there was somebody screaming at some open Miker, I'd be like, he didn't do it, you know, fucking do that. You encourage, you know? Um, but I mean, I still think, I still thought it was, it was a really good movie, but I would actually say the best drums, uh, the best drums in any movie this year is not in whiplash.

Speaker 1:          00:44:20       The best rooms in any movie by far that I, I, that I saw was in a birdman. Birdman has sick drums in it and it then, they're not even as difficult technically as the drawing that was in whiplash, but it's dynamics. Dynamics will take your playing over the fucking top if you know how to utilize them, which I do not put whoever the fuck played the drums on the, uh, Birdman soundtrack was fucking unbelievable, was that he's just one of those guys sits down at a four piece kit and just gets more music out of that than I could have fucking Terry Bozzio that's inspiring and frustrating and it's just like, Eh, that's why I became a comedian because I can't fucking do that. All right, so you asked me, um, are the all time greats in any field born or can they be made thoughts? I think both. Um, I think everybody is born with a talent and then it's up to you to try to see how far it's all up to you, how far you want to take it. And I think that a lot of,

Speaker 3:          00:45:27       yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:45:28       a lot of the greats, a lot of the times are not necessarily the best, uh, weren't blessed with the most talent. It's just that they had

Speaker 1:          00:45:42       that brutal combination of blessed with enough of the gift and they had drive to try to get themselves as great as they could get in. A lot of times when people are born with a fucking ridiculous gift, it comes easy to them and they'll, they'll coast. Um, and that's what made Jordan so great because Jordan was like born with like the greatest talent of all, but worked like he was born with my gift for playing basketball and that's why he became the greatest who ever fucking plate or like a Jerry Rice or something like that. And um, so I would say it's a combination of both. So, you know, I dunno, whatever your fucking talent is, you should be always trying to just compete against yourself and then then you won't become like this bitter asshole. Cause you don't wanna compete against somebody else cause they were born with a different gift than you.

Speaker 1:          00:46:39       You know what I mean? And then you'll, you'll try to like, uh, you know, that happens in my fucking business where like you get an acting gig and you'll do a scene and somebody is trying to out like act you. I was just talking about somebody talking to somebody about this like last night, the train like out at you being like, it's like, no, dude, we're in this together. You don't, let's fucking do this thing together. So, um, yeah. Does that make any sense? I feel like just went from a fucking funny podcast to a Goddamn lecture for the last 10 minutes. Let's talk about talents every bloody.

Speaker 8:          00:47:10       Are you born with it or is it, is it made from your hard work? Today we're going to talk to two people. Both who chronically jerk off one person since the day he was born, the crib, the other person who did not discover masturbating until he was 23. Mark and Chris, welcome to the program.

Speaker 1:          00:47:32       Um, all right, let's get on to the next one here. Uh, oh, Rex Ryan. Happy trails to you. Bunch of people got fired today. Uh, wait a minute. That's PTI. I just ripped off to PTI show. Sorry man. See that's why I don't watch other comedians cause it fucking just sticks in your head. And next thing you know, you say some shit that they were saying. All right. Uh, Rex Ryan, he got fired. Uh, I don't know how I feel about that. I guess they just, they just been together long enough so they had to make the move. I mean, I think that guy is, he's a bit of a knucklehead.

Speaker 4:          00:48:12       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:48:12       You know, very crass.

Speaker 1:          00:48:17       He's not a dumb guy, but he just, he's got that low self esteem thing that he just walks around and just has to act like a dope. I don't know why he does that because I think he's a great coach. And um, I think he was a victim of a bad GM that John, what was it? His Dick [inaudible] fuck you goddamn name. I mean that guy just, he made some moves and they didn't fucking pan out. Right. You got rid of fucking Reavis, although you've got a number one draft pick in that panned out. But then like, I dunno, they had all these draft picks and they used all of them. I was, I mean, I'm just fucking regurgitate and what I read, I mean it seemed to be when rex had the players, he got him to the fucking AFC championship game. Then all of a sudden all the players were taken away. What the fuck are you going to do? Right? Every fucking great coach. He got to have the players. So I think that that guy would be a great pickup and now I'm actually hoping that he goes to the NFC.

Speaker 1:          00:49:20       I don't because I have, I'm just like, I'm sick of it. I just don't, I don't, I don't know. There's something about that guy.

Speaker 1:          00:49:27       I Dunno. She's been wanting, I watched that jets, one of the fucking inside the locker room whenever the fuck it was and he's like, hey, we can beat any fucking team in this league. It was just like this. That's how you talk to your team. Look far be it from me to talk about the f bomb. But there's a time and a place for it, right. You just going to casually use that word and then what, what are you going to do when you blow a gasket? What the fuck was that? It's just you. You've already done that. But a fuck. It was like Mike Smith. Mike Smith never looked like a head coach to me. He always looked like somebody who like infiltrated the mob. How's he know what I mean? He sort of looks like he's in the mob and he also kind of looks like a cop. He just be the perfect guy for the cops to try to get in the infiltrate and try to break it up. Hey, break it up. Okay. Um,

Speaker 4:          00:50:20       yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:50:21       Who else? That guy, Marc Trestman, Jim Harbaugh, a bunch of guys lost their fucking jobs. Um, so anyways, whatever, who gives a fuck my bill? ESPN here, by the way, people, it is three days away from the granddaddy of them all in this year. It's a fucking playoff game. FSU versus fucking Oregon. And this year, last year, if you guys, if you've been listening for the, for a while last year, uh, old freckles here passed out at the tailgate. That's how hard I went. So this year I'm actually, I'm going to try to enjoy it. I'm going to try to live in the moment, but I, I say that every fucking year.

Speaker 3:          00:51:00       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:51:00       Oh man, I can't fucking wait. We're doing ribs this year. We got some burgers. We're actually bringing a power strip with a generator because the second that game's over, we're coming back out. We're firing back up the grill and we're going to sit there freezing our asses off watching the fucking Alabama game, uh, bleary eyed. Um, I can't fucking wait and I'm going to try to go easier. Yeah. Last year I got a little drunk and belligerent. Remember yelling at some fucking idiot. That was a fucking idiot last year. So I really got to, I got to tone it down. Oh, I never finished talking about it. Some of you talked about me going to Singapore and all that, like, can you give me a favorite, a fucking send me tweets about me dying in a plane crash. Yukons and how do I fucking do that to you? Do I fucking write to you and ask you if you fucking dreams died? I don't do that to you. Um, and fuck all you douchebags and think you're now clever that you're going to do it. It's like, that's some amazing, God damn joke it out. I don't know. I fucking, who did I see doing something like that.

Speaker 3:          00:52:09       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:52:10       Oh, did you guys see that Twitter fight with a dude? Actually, those guys, they, they could greed to fight. They were arguing over Koby Bryant and they agreed to fight. So one of the guys shows up to the fight and the other guy wasn't even in the state. And then he does like this interview about it. Like what he did was amazing that he agreed to fight this guy. And then he didn't show up like this was some massive fucking,

Speaker 3:          00:52:38       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:52:38       You know, he's like this genius burglar that figured out how to break into the fucking Federal Reserve. It's like, dude, all you did was lie. You're a pussy. I, that's one thing about fucking the Internet that drives me up the wall is how trolls feel like they're fucking like these. Uh,

Speaker 3:          00:52:57       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:52:58       I Dunno like the, these geniuses and it's just like, dude, you're doing the lowest common denominator of a,

Speaker 3:          00:53:07       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:53:08       I Dunno. I don't know what the fuck to call the art. I don't know. It's like a shit joke. Not that I'm against shit jokes, but I just didn't know. Why is this guy like you, this guy challenge you to fight. You said you're going to go there and you didn't go and then you talking about yourself like you some sort of bad ass. Like, yeah, I pissed off a of people. This is the first

Speaker 9:          00:53:26       time ever got anybody show up to five.

Speaker 5:          00:53:30       All right. Well he showed up and he was ready to fight. I think I'd rather hang out with that other guy. Then you, you fucking passive aggressive little pansy. All right. Anyways, response to your advice last week about guy into girl with the laugh. Like his friend. All right, so those of you didn't listen last week there was this dude who met this uh, woman. She's beautiful. She had a great rack, great rack as he said, and uh, they hit it off. She was awesome. And everything was great. She was great in the rain, the bed, everything was fucking awesome. Everything is coming up roses and then the only thing was that she laughed exactly like his friend and that was weird and I'm out, so here we go. Okay. In response to a, my advice to that person, he said last week you talked,

Speaker 5:          00:54:15       you talked, read an email. Can you guys please fucking, you know I suck at reading. Can you just please proof read what you wrote. All right. Last week you read an email about a guy who was worried about dating a girl with a laugh like her brother. You acknowledged that the advice you were giving was probably not the greatest when you said that it would be brutal to have to live with that. I'm writing to tell you that you are correct. Correct in saying you're wrong. In my opinion, in my opinion, that is no matter what girl you meet and date, she'll have characteristics of a male family member he described. Yeah, but dude, this is the thing. It was his friend and he knew his friend for whatever years and years and years hanging out with them as this Sharon laughs.

Speaker 5:          00:55:05       You know what I mean? I'm not saying like, you know, oh, you meet a girl and she has her dad's eyes or something. Yeah, they're a family. They can, she's also going to look like our mom. This is all getting weird Friday in here anyways. No matter what a girl, what girl you meet and date, she'll have the characteristics of male family members. He described the girl to be hot, quirky and fun and she was into him. She didn't make it awkward when hooking up. She sounded awesome. If anything he should bring it out in the open and teller. How weird it is. Oh, toad. I don't know about that one. Then when they laugh about it and she does the laugh, they're laughing about the laughter. Laughing about that laugh even more.

Speaker 9:          00:55:48       Huh?

Speaker 5:          00:55:49       Takes his dick out. I don't see how that works. I'm really trying to see your point here, sir. Hey, I could be wrong. Um, anyways. Then when they laugh about it. Oh yeah. I already said that. Uh, it'll go beyond the awkward situation, become its own inside joke. Plus if she likes him, that's a terrible way for her to be rejected just for laughing naturally. I know you weren't being a Dick and have to make America laugh, have a week, but I just want this guy, I just don't want this guy to blow it. All right. See you coming from a good place. Um,

Speaker 3:          00:56:21       okay.

Speaker 5:          00:56:22       Don't you think what you're going

Speaker 4:          00:56:24       to say? Okay.

Speaker 5:          00:56:25       Is going to make her self conscious. Like I, I want you write me back again and you tell me how you're going to tell her. Hey, by the way, when you laugh you laugh just like your brother and that weirds me out in the Dick area. Like that's kind of what you saying even though you're not going to be that blunt about it. Um,

Speaker 4:          00:56:51       yeah.

Speaker 5:          00:56:52       I don't know how the eff or somebody else, somebody else right in and tell me exactly how you pull that off because everything else you said about the woman. I agree with that shit. That's just a rough one.

Speaker 5:          00:57:02       That one. I, you just could picture myself just out in the kitchen, cutting up some shit for a sandwich or something. And then she laughs in the other room and then you just sort of fucking wince. You know, she's in there talking to a friends, laughing it up and you just sat in the kitchen. You talk and he saw how I got it. It sounds, it sounds just like Scott. It's fucking, I believe a block it up, blah blah. Hey ladies, would you like some cheese nips, cheese nips. Greetings from Mexico. Um, I discovered you the other night while browsing Netflix all by myself and I just thought my two team and husband boys 15 and 16 have got to watch this. So we did. I totally fell in love with you. Smart comedy, great points of view and I really find you totally educational for teens. Um, did you watch my special or did you watch a Ted talk anyways? So if you did decide to either adopt or have your kids of your own, you're going to do great. Ps. I've already started to hug my kids less. Let's hope it's not too late. No Homo, no homophobia here. Lol. All right, look at that. I got a fan down in Mexico.

Speaker 4:          00:58:12       MMM.

Speaker 5:          00:58:14       Yeah. A lot of people telling me I should adopt. You should do it. You should go out there and fucking do it. Uh, we'll see. We'll see what I do. I have to say, as I often feel, I'm too, too out of my mind too fucking scatter brain in two fucking selfish to do something like that. To have kids.

Speaker 4:          00:58:30       Okay.

Speaker 5:          00:58:30       Yeah. There's fucking 7 billion people on the planet, you know, running out of deer and fresh water. What the fuck are we doing?

Speaker 4:          00:58:37       You know,

Speaker 5:          00:58:39       I don't know. Anyways, uh, from Russia with go fuck yourself. I ah, Shit. I almost didn't get that from Russia with love. No. From Russia with go fuck yourself. All right, here we go. Hello Bill.

Speaker 4:          00:58:58       Okay.

Speaker 5:          00:58:58       It will be a strange message. First of all, I want to thank you. It will be a strange message. I love Russian. So just fucking, I must break you. It will be a message that is strange. First of all, I want to thank you for your incredible craft. Can I call comedy a craft and for your podcast? Dude, I want to compliment you on your incredible English. Are you a spy? This is unbelievable. Anyway, I am from Russia. Then I have to say that we love you here. Get the fuck Outta here. I'll do a show in Moscow. I'm going to show up with no money in my fucking passport. Laugh locked in a fucking safe back in the hotel room.

Speaker 3:          00:59:36       Okay?

Speaker 5:          00:59:37       I'm not going to get rolled in. Moscow. Moscow was a shady fucking place. That's the word. It's beautiful. It's gorgeous, but you will get knocked the fuck out in Russia. Wake up in a vodka plant. Your job's to put the cork in them for the rest of your fucking life and they don't give you, they don't give you any mittens anyways, even with the crazy things. Maybe a, wait a minute. Wait. Where the fuck at me second. I'm from Russia and we have to say, we love you here. Really? It's even, it even freaks me out when I realized that I agree on 100% with what you're saying. Even with the crazy things. Maybe not with all of them, but it's amazing because even we have different cultures as some may say, I can relate myself to all your topics, women, marriage, dogs, politics, idiots, et cetera. Yeah. You know, why do cause work gear, human being, all that other stuff is just a,

Speaker 3:          01:00:28       okay,

Speaker 5:          01:00:28       that's just all of the bullshit. So every country is full of shit except maybe New Zealand, our country like that. That doesn't really fuck with anybody. He just kind of stay down there and live their life,

Speaker 3:          01:00:43       you know?

Speaker 5:          01:00:44       But other than that, everybody else did just spin it.

Speaker 3:          01:00:48       And there

Speaker 5:          01:00:49       the leaders just say that everything that your country is doing is fucking heroic and you're in the right. But at the end of the day, both countries got a bunch of broads and the drive and the guys up the fucking wall there. Um, and whatever the guys who are driving the women, that's, that's what I learned. Traveling the world.

Speaker 3:          01:01:09       All right.

Speaker 5:          01:01:10       There's a through line with human beings and it's basically watching your friend fall down a flight of stairs is the funniest fucking thing you're ever going to see. I don't give a fuck what country you're from. I don't give a fuck if you're in such a poor country that they don't even have stairs. If he just ran out of his hut, stop quickly and it rained and he slipped and banged the back of his head and then he curls up in the fetal position with both hands. Clasping the back of his head. You're going to fucking laugh for the whole morning.

Speaker 3:          01:01:38       Okay.

Speaker 5:          01:01:39       Anyways, he says, uh, I hope politicians were turned off the heat between our countries. It will be great for everyone. Yeah. Except for big business. Um, don't believe in all this bullshit about hatred. Personally, I don't have nothing against the United States. It's a great country. What a country quoting Yakov, Smirnoff, uh, beautiful nature and kindhearted people, fast cars and blues music. Lots of problems of course, but we have them to, uh, everyone has nice to see this fucking guy's enlightened. Exactly. Hope you'll come to Russia someday. You know what's funny is this. If he actually fucking hates me and now just buttering me up

Speaker 1:          01:02:20       and I go over there and he puts a fucking potato sack over my head and beats me with a mic stand, I'd actually find the humor in that beat down. Good day to you and best wishes. Ps. Sorry, I've made some mistakes and text in the text. I'm still in the process of learning. I'll fuck you. Fuck you. You asshole. I know what you're doing. You know what's your, your, your English is great and you know we can't speak any other languages over here that was passive aggressive. You know what, sir, I fucking loved you to that last sentence. You know what? Now I think you aren't going to jump me when I go over there, but really, you know what? Let me hear it from more, more people in Russia. If I can get, what do I need? What do I need to go over there? Just get me like 400 fucking people. If you can, you can. If you can guarantee me 400 fucking people, 400 people will fucking show up to my show in Moscow. All right. And I won't get a pinky sliced off or any sort of fucking black mart market. Mafioso shit going on down there. I will come over there.

Speaker 1:          01:03:22       All right. And like I said, I am showing up there with the shirt on my back, nothing else. This is all based on a cab ride I took when I was in Helsinki, Finland and I was asking him about Lithuania and Estonia and all these other things and I was like, yeah man, it's crazy fucking Russia's like right there, you know, talking about growing up with the, you know, all that Cold War shit. And, and he was saying, you know, he was saying Moscow is a beautiful place, but it's fucking shady. He said, after 5:00 PM it goes, it gets fucking shady. He goes, I'm not saying it's a bad place, but you really have to watch yourself after five o'clock. And it's just like, oh, all right. So it's a, it's like Detroit. Um, but there's something about getting your ass kicked in another country. It's way scarier because you have no fucking idea. I would think as you're fighting going, like what if I end up in a Goddamn jail, you know?

Speaker 4:          01:04:17       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:04:18       And everybody is speaking a different fucking language. I mean, that's just, that's just spells ass rate to me. Um, all right. Cubans in America, this is the last thing and then I got to get rolling here. Uh, Cubans in America. Bill, what are your thoughts on normalizing relations with Cuba in the United States? Um, well I think honestly, I think, uh, we've been bullying him for fucking 50 years. They have a right to fucking run their country they way they want to. I'm not saying Castro is a great fucking guy, but, uh, I don't think what we did to them.

Speaker 1:          01:04:58       Look, obviously they couldn't have those fucking missiles there. We had to get rid of that shit that I agreed with. But other than that, you know, if they want to be communists than you. Now, if you want to fucking do that, go ahead and do it. I mean, what's funny, you can go ahead. We have nuclear weapons. What are you going to do to us? Shoot one at us. We'll shoot of you when it's over. It's done. What are you a fucking idiot? Go ahead. Be a Russian, not Russia. Sorry to be a communist. I don't give a shit, but I mean, you know, to be honest, we were trying to turn that fucking country into a, a place for us to go there and relax and go vacation and casinos and take all their natural resources doing what the fuck we always do. And then we deal with the whole, uh, the, they, they don't want their people to be free, you know, and I'm not saying Cuba's fucking it, uh, innocent, but come on anyways.

Speaker 1:          01:05:49       He says cigars could be in the future, in the future, could become legal in the u s as of right now, $100 worth of tobacco. You can bring in Cuban cigars, which is hilarious. It's like fucking three cigars for cigars or whatever. He said, ah, what would you, what would this do to the size of your human door? Um, I've actually shut down my humidor because I was smoking too many of them. Um, and he said, I know you enjoy Cubans, but do you smoke cigars from other regions as well? Next time you're in Calgary, come in the summer and rent a motorcycle and ride through the mountains. If you have time and find a nice place to pull over for a [inaudible], you won't regret it. Oh Jesus. That sounds great. Thanks for the laughs and go fuck yourself. Um, I've actually heard that, uh, once they make Cuban cigars legal in America, like I think initially the quality of them will go down because the demand will be through the fucking roof.

Speaker 1:          01:06:42       And, um, you know, it's a little ass country over here and we are a big country that devours shit. So, um, I was actually talking to a cigar head the other day and he was saying, if you going to buy Cuban stock up on them now, because his fear, and granted this was just based, this was just fear talk from some guy in a fucking cigar bar, but he was saying that the quality might drop down. Um, I liked the fact that we're going to take our foot off the back of their fucking neck. I still think we're going to do the wrong thing down there and try to get our cheesecake factories and all that type of shit and just sort of appropriate them for our own fucking needs. Um, but, uh, I dunno, there's something fun about the fact that Cuban cigars are illegal and to actually have them and no way to get him and shit.

Speaker 1:          01:07:35       It's not that fucking hard to get them, but it's still fun. And, um, you know, I was at a party the other day and this guy showed up and with a box of Cuban cigars and it was, you know, we was standing outside and we smoked in a second. I took a fucking pull off of it. I was like, Eh, this is not a Cohiba. And then he'd given me a, a party gets however the fuck you say it. Everybody says it different partake as part of this is what he gives me. That series two, which was one of my favorites. And when I got home, I looked at it and it was fucking hell. The band was the same color, but the font was completely off. It was a really bad, bad, bad fake. And through that right in the fucking trash. So, um, that's also the fun of it.

Speaker 1:          01:08:18       The Fun. Did I get a real one? Did I get a fake one? You know, there's a lot of cigar people that go [inaudible] the Cubans goes virtually full, can fake well I don't give a fuck because they taste better than 90% of the other shit. Um, as far as other, um, other cigars, yeah, there's a couple of others that I smoke. Um, couple of Nicaraguan ones that are right. Um, but I'm sick of people always going through these are better than the Cubans and then not, they never are. They, they just don't taste as good as them. And, um, it's Kinda like, you know, when you look at cars and they're always trying to like compare the car to like a, like a whatever, a BMW or a, this is like a Porsche. This is like at this, it's like, yeah, but it isn't, but at the end of the day, it isn't.

Speaker 1:          01:09:06       Even though I heard BMW's quality's been going down through the fucking, I dunno, whatever at what happened. Let me just shut the fuck up. I gotta get Outta here. I got shit to do. All right. A happy new year to everybody. Uh, thanks to everybody who came out to my shows this year. Uh, thanks to everybody who's been not only watching my standup special, but spreading the word about it. It's been, um, it's gotten the best response of any special I've ever done. And, uh, getting back to that talent you were born with and then pushing yourself to get better. I've been trying to do that with every special, um, work on a new skill. Just I can drumming a new drum, lick a new comedy technique or whatever, um, to enhance my fucking bullshit ideas. So, uh, you know, um, I'm really, yeah, I couldn't be any happier, so thank you.

Speaker 1:          01:09:51       And thank you for everybody letting everybody know about it and, um, that's it. Happy new year to everybody. And, uh, thanks to everybody, anybody who comes out to my shows in 2015. All right, that's the podcast. Go fuck yourselves. I'm sticking with the Seattle Seahawks is my pick for the, um, for winning the super bowl. And um, I'm rooting for Tony Romo. I want to see him do well and I want to see him shut all those Dallas Cowboy fans the fuck up. That's what I would like the Patriots. I don't know. I don't know man. I think the afcs is once again not as strong as the NFC. And uh, last week, this week against the bills, we had two starting offensive lineman out and Gronk I think they would just rest and Gronk. Um, I dunno, we got to play the Broncos again. I might have to play the colts again. We already played them and we won. Those are always tough. I don't know. I don't have any foregone conclusions about what the Patriots are going to do. Of course, I'm going to be rooting for them. Uh, that is it. That is all. Go fuck yourselves. We'll talk to you next week.
