Speaker 1:          00:00:00       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:00:02       Hey, what's going on? It's bill birds. The Monday morning podcasts from Monday, May 14th, 2012, um, re I am sole role re I got the house all to myself. Nia is out of town, comes back tomorrow and uh, my dogs out getting a tune up. So I'm sitting in my house all by myself, all by my lonesome. I'd like to sit here and tell you that the reason why I'm sitting here by myself cause I told the bitches in my life to get the fuck out. Right? Like some pimp shit. And now I'm just sitting here in some giant leather chair, the head of an animal above me in my study with a bunch of books around me that I never read some creepy toy from my childhood. Um, no, I don't know what the fuck's going on. There's nobody here and I'm slowly losing my mind.

Speaker 2:          00:00:50       I'm eating like shit. Um, had waffles like three days in a row, you know, cause I don't know how to make them just for one. I don't have the recipe. Usually make them for two people. And then there's a couple of extra. So you know, I just made the fucking batch because the recipe I have says one egg, so you know, if I cut it in half when we put half a fucking egg in there, okay. I don't know how to do that. So I'm making all the waffles and I'm using all this and uh, I'm fucking, I'm out of whack. I'm full of sugar and doe. I went to the grocery store, I'm like a single man. I went to grocery store and they, you know, rather than buy something to cook, I go and I buy like, you know, parts of a chicken that we're already cooked.

Speaker 2:          00:01:36       God knows when, you know, somebody hit it with a truck and then they throw it on a fucking grill. So for the first time in my life, second time actually I actually had, for lunch I had chicken and Waffles, a staple in the African American community and I have never understood that dish. I love waffles. I love chicken, but not together. To me that was toothpaste and orange juice. Both great ideas. Just not together. Right. And I had it and I got to tell you, I still don't get it. I don't get it. It's, it's like a,

Speaker 2:          00:02:13       it's like the sun and the moon at the same time. It's just, it just freaks me out, you know, is it breakfast or are or have we gotten on with their day? Should I be in my fucking pajamas or should I be telling you about my dad? Just, you know, I dunno. I'm losing my fucking mind. I'm losing my mind. And then tomorrow I leave, I leave to go do, I'm doing an episode of um, Oh, what the fuck is this show called? That's embarrassing. I don't even know what the show's called. What's that one with that? Did the check from a party of five is on and she gives the hand jobs, but she's, she's a good person. What's it called? Uh, the fucking the,

Speaker 1:          00:02:55       yeah,

Speaker 2:          00:02:55       the hand job whisperer. What the fuck's her name? I'm doing that show during that show this week I'm on the hand job whisperer and I play one of the clients and uh, she's going to rub one out. So, you know, it was a long talk I had to have with Nia in order to be duty to do this episode. But she understands that it's just art. Jennifer Love Hewitt's she plays the, uh, the hand hand job just with the heart of gold. You know, it's a wonderful show. She gives people hand jobs at the end of, of Masu sing them and then gives advice to their upset. Um,

Speaker 3:          00:03:35       yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:03:36       What would you call the person they're dating wives and girlfriends come in like, how could you jerk off my husband? And then she goes like, she doesn't love you. He doesn't love you anymore. That's why he's coming to me. And then some how they pour their heart out to her because she's such a good, she's such a good fucking person that she can jerk off their boyfriends and husbands and these people on the show don't have a problem with it. And from the second I saw that show, I was just like, you know what, I have to be a part of it. And, um, so this week, Oh yeah, I'm going to be taping an episode of, uh, the hand job whisper. I think Jennifer Love Hewitson and I might have the wrong fucking show. You know, it's funny on my cable box, not the cable box, whatever the fuck you call it, the to the screen when you go through the guide, um, right above the versus network, you know, scrolling up trying to find a game and you go three channels up and then it goes to the porno channel and a, you know.

Speaker 3:          00:04:36       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:04:37       It's the weirdest thing ever. You just see a soccer game, a baseball game, a basketball game, and then it'll be like fist fuck part's fun.

Speaker 2:          00:04:50       And I don't think that was by accident because if you watch enough sports, they got the basically for guys, they got two things. They don't want to go bald and they want to fuck something. And uh, I can remember, I guess it's true on both those both counts. Wouldn't you say there? Huh? Speaking of lonely, I was just watching television by myself, speaking to it as if it was another live human being. And I saw this commercial for this, this, this new website called farmers only. Dot Com. This is not a commercial people. This is actually an observation. Um, it was basically showing, uh, you know, some, a couple of ranchers, a couple of farm girls and they just walk in the fields by themselves, you know, playing with their face finger, playing with each other. You know, you do that when you were a little kid, you'd do that little thing where you put your thumb and index finger together and both hands.

Speaker 2:          00:05:44       He didn't kind of do the little, almost like there's an invisible tiny screw, you know, there's some poor woman walking through like these, uh, a bunch of corn, you know, and the cows are all concerned to the point they're actually English to one one another. You know, about each of them going, how the hell are they going to meet each other? And then all of a sudden this Waylon horror comes over the top and just start singing, yell, never be lonely. Add Pharma zone, led.com. So it's basically their Facebook and you should go and look at it on Youtube. That's what you should do. You shouldn't work, you know, where do you work? What are you doing? Is it your dream or somebody else's? You just a cog in the wheel, you know, are they really gonna notice if you stop working, everybody else is working. Why don't you just fucking, you know, Tour de France just sort of draft behind a couple people's today. You know, they could fucking Monday off. So anyways, check out this video and you know, what's the funniest thing about it is the comments underneath it as the amount of people who shit on, you know, just immediately thinking how dumb people are. It's like these people grow our fucking food. Do you understand that? I'm sure they don't know where the rave is. You know? Well, who the most popular bands are or how to get from fucking Brooklyn over to Staten Island, right? They don't know how to do that shit.

Speaker 2:          00:07:10       They don't know how to put on a fucking shiny shirt, right? And go jump on the subway and go down to Wall Street and make sure old people eat dog food for the rest of their fucking lives. Yet. They don't know how to do that, you know, they know how to do, they had to make, then I'll make corn, right. Or planets or it grows. They don't make it. God makes it, and he makes that fertile fucking country. You know, it's gotta be really hard to catch herpes out there. You know what I mean? I mean, in much spread, really fucking slowly.

Speaker 2:          00:07:42       Jesus Christ. I mean you, you must fucking rub them at least two loads out. By the time we get to our house, just sitting there driving and driving fucking Tornado, man. You pull over rob another one out and by then you'll add it. You know what the fuck I'm going over there. Foreign Waste Shit. I got more teeth in her. That's a deal breaker. Look, now I'm making fun of him. I like, or that they're called the flyover states and no reason to go there. Yeah, no reason to check it on the food supply. Uh, like you're gonna. That'd be good shit in the fucking, freak him out with, just show up with like a clipboard. Fuck. Are you doing sit at boy or they actually, you know, something, they make themselves kind of separatist cause at the end of, is that even a word? Um, they actually say this city folks don't understand. What don't we understand? Loneliness. Is that what it is? Come to New York and be alone with everybody. You never heard that. You fucking, you know what? Fuck them. God Damn farmers. Jesus Christ. What? You don't have your cousin's phone number. Is that what? You're sick of? Fucking your sisters. So now you gotta get your own Facebook and see the jokes that just too easy here. People, you know,

Speaker 2:          00:08:53       sick of fucking a pig. I want some farm animals. That'd be great if I just had space.

Speaker 1:          00:09:02       Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:09:03       How many goats would you need to fucking drink enough? You know, make your own milk. A couple of chickens. You got your own eggs, right? So you've got dead bullshitting. And I'm Malcolm, which I know I'm not going to do. I couldn't do it without laughing. And then I'd fucking creep out the goat. Oh Jesus. I need some people in my life and I know what the fuck I'm talking about. And you know, last week I made an ass of myself as always as always. And I was talking about the, uh, the sewage and the drain

Speaker 2:          00:09:33       and Oh, by the way, you know something, I'm, I'm sitting here watching the fucking La kings and the Phoenix coyotes playing each other. All right? It's in Phoenix and they're having a white out. Everybody's wearing the same t shirt. But you don't, you just realize that the second you do that, you're just showing the fact that you have a shitty fucking franchise. Oh my account this week. Um, I hate that this all go whoa. Where are the same shirt? It'll be a white out that'll intimidate them. They're going to be afraid of the crowd. I will tell you this, what was amazing, cause I'm watching this fucking game and the crowd in Phoenix is Channing bete, la La beat La, the iconic chair from the Boston Garden. It's actually spread all the way west and jumps sports, you know, so I had to immediately text Paul Versey and let them know that because you know, he's so fucking a namerd with the food court known as Madison Square Garden Talk. I was talking to somebody the other day, we were trying to think of like, when we think of Madison Square Garden, what did we think of,

Speaker 1:          00:10:42       you know,

Speaker 2:          00:10:44       boxing?

Speaker 1:          00:10:46       Okay,

Speaker 2:          00:10:47       Leonard Scanner. Do you just stick a rock shows?

Speaker 2:          00:10:51       Nobody thinks about the Knicks or the fucking rangers other than Nixon Rangers fans. It's just another fucking, that's another one to add to that list of overrated nicknames. The world's most famous arena. You can throw that right in with Lynn. Sanity Sanchez. Wait, got it. Bill. You hate New York. All right. I've made my fucking point. Um, anyways, so, which last week this guy tried to tell me that I should just piss in the shower because hey, it all goes down. Save fucking brain anyway. Fuck. Do you care? What do I care? I don't want it urine in my toes. I also fucking, I'm concerned with the fact that someone else has to use the shower. How bout that? You know? So, um, but I was also thinking that they went down to different drains. I would think that they would try and keep that separately separate. And everybody was like, everybody writes me, you know, whenever I say something wrong, everybody do, you know, it's always like, hey shit. Right. So everybody told me that it actually goes down the same drain and that the reason why you can't smell the shit is because they have vents, you know, which I still no fucking understand, you know?

Speaker 3:          00:11:59       Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:12:00       Then why don't ice smell shit outside my house? Where does the, where does the, the air that was surrounding the Shit, where does that go?

Speaker 2:          00:12:09       You know? And please by all means talk to me like I'm the biggest fucking moron ever. Cause I gotta tell you, I only got like 20 emails about it and I know how many listeners I have. So there's a lot of people right now gone. Really? I didn't realize that. Um, but still, let me read this bill. He says, Bill, about your questioning on a sewage handling from your May 7th podcast on whether toilet water is handled in the same system as your shower water. The answer is it depends. Oh, wait a minute. I think this guy knows what he's talking about because he didn't start it off with, hey shit. Fuck I'm, he says sewage water that has no human waste in it. Uh, this would be considered shower water, water for dishwater and sinks, et Cetera. Thank you for explaining where I don't shit and Piss, um, is called gray water. What? Uh, what that does contain human waste is called Blackwater. All right? Uh, in most modern urban sewage system, gray water and black water are treated and moved within the same system. Rouse say yet another reason to live on a farm at Pharma Zone, it.com

Speaker 2:          00:13:24       that's going to be embarrassing. You and your fucking neighbor are going to join. You'll be the only ones on the site. I thought you wanted to fuck me. I just was too long of a walk. You know what I'm saying? Just bless this tornado season. You never know what's going to happen. Um, and sue, it's just anyways, in sewage systems that aren't as complex or our more remote gray water is treated in one system, blackwater is put into another and usually come composited oh, wait a minute, let me, okay, so it's not as complex. Meaning what? You can't move those all down the same pipe and somehow separate them again. You know, sometimes you said stick with simplicity. I think on this one. I don't think that motherhood stuff that goes into my hair and on my body should ever have touched somebody else's shit personally. I don't care how much you treat it. It's fucking gross. I got to run for office and if elected by what? Keep the gray water away from the blackwater.

Speaker 3:          00:14:25       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:14:25       Bring it back to the old system where you sit in an outhouse and you never wash your hair with shit. Um, ask not why there's Piss in my hand, but why this shit and the dre. Um, the reason why you do not get sewer smells in your house is through the use of an s curve in the toilet

Speaker 2:          00:14:47       sink and shower drain pipe. If you take the letter s and turn it on its side, that's what shaped the drain pipe makes you, you know, I deserve, I deserve to be talked to like a child. Is that what it looks like on its side? Alright, take the letter o and turn it on its side. You still with me? Uh, when you drain water through this shape, some water is always left behind inside the ass. Wonderful. This forms a seal or blocked through which sewage gases can't get through. Oh, that's brilliant. They should have those on like subways, you know what I mean? Just to have it. Just have it missing in between people.

Speaker 1:          00:15:32       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:15:34       Early sewage systems didn't employ this shape and it was indeed the case that sewer gases could enter the home as far as recycling. Isn't it amazing how simple that was to fix though? As far as recycled water, sewage that is taken from your home and sent to treatment plans is usually released back into nature after it is cleaned. Mother Nature does the last of the cleaning process with microbes, et cetera.

Speaker 1:          00:15:59       Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:16:00       Uh, you know what, that's one of those things that's like a hot dog. You know what I mean? You just don't know. You don't want to know what's in it. That's fucking gross yet. Brilliant. I find that, I find I'm finding all of this shit. What did I just say that three times it might, I find I'm finding all of this shit. You guys think I'm a fucking moron. You don't what it is. I have the balls to bring up the shit that I don't understand. Yeah. Bill every week and it spans the entire spectrum of humanity. Go fuck yourselves. Um, I actually began disassembling that carburetor I took apart the primary fuel ball, took out the floater and all that. It doesn't have fucking hard. I knew it wasn't, I know it wasn't. And venting and venting, the carborated, the carburetor that that is the genius.

Speaker 2:          00:16:49       Okay. Take a one apart. I mean that's not, that's no big fucking deal. And I imagine once you take it apart, oh you can put it back together again. Right. And after a while, I imagine you can figure out out, fuck it works. It doesn't seem that complex to make, um, I'm fucking idiot. No, I'm doing the whole thing. I got the, I got the whole chemical right. I bought myself little. Uh, no I didn't. I'm lying. I'm gonna, I'm gonna buy this a Turkey thing that you know to put it in little, uh, you know what your roasted Turkey and you put that on the side with the solution to clean off all the parts. And I'm going to build that mother. Fuck. I should take a before and after picture with a look and then I'll give you guys a nice go. Fuck yourself underneath it for all you people who trashed me cause I didn't realize that, you know, it's the same pipe that the shit and piss goes down. Why would I know that I'm not a plumber? You know, why can't you guys show the kind of empathy for others that I do on this podcast every week? Um, would you guys like to learn about an element? That's my nighttime reading. I'm really freaking me out. She, she can't tell if I'm going crazy or if I'm starting. I'm trying to build a bomb. Hold on one sec.

Speaker 2:          00:18:06       All right. We hear it. The bill burr podcast, the Monday morning podcast. I'm going to try and make you guys either smarter or bring it down to my level of stupidity. So considering I can like, I know like everybody's name and number from every football team in the 70s for the most part. Wilbert Montgomery 31 Fred Biletnikoff. What the fuck number was he? That was before my time. Doug Flutie was 22 Roger Starbuck was 12 Frank Tarkenton was 10

Speaker 3:          00:18:42       yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:18:42       Craig Morton was seventh Dan Pastor Rainey was seven. Burt Jones was seven. I'll do all the quarterbacks. Terry Bradshaw was 12 Brian Sipe the fuck was he was he 17

Speaker 3:          00:18:58       okay.

Speaker 2:          00:18:58       All right. All I'm saying is if I can, if I can fucking memorize that shit, I can't memorize the periodic chart. This is yet another thing that [inaudible] pseudo intelligent thing. You know, if you can just memorize this shit and then you go to a cocktail party like we all do, right? It doesn't everybody on one of those Roger Moore Tuxedos like me. And every once in a while you just go out to a, uh, you ought to a cocktail party with other social lights. Um, you know this, this is a good thing to know. If you memorize the periodic chart, just out of nowhere this, it's like anytime you say something dumb, you can just go. Hydrogen is the first, uh, is element number one on the periodic chart.

Speaker 2:          00:19:45       I'm going to memorize this shit and I'm going to fucking try and understand it. It's a, and then I can't even say what I'm going to do with this knowledge. What'd you guys do if you gradually, we're listening to me learning all this shit and then I accidentally blew myself up my garage. How compelling would this podcast be? You'd listen to the first four and a half years, uh, who's kept no, the first four and three quarter years listening to how dumb I was. And then you just, you're going to hear that crucial podcasts where I said that I'm going to buy a book on this shit. You know, by the way, has anybody seen the on spike that fucking thousand ways to die?

Speaker 3:          00:20:21       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:20:21       You guys seen that shorter fucking creepy ass show that is despite the awful jokes that they have on top of it, they just show all these different ways that people have figured out how to die. And uh, they just sort of trash people and say how stupid they are. And they, um,

Speaker 2:          00:20:39       they fucking just, these, they don't try to like tone down that somebody was dead. It's weird cause they're making these really bad jokes. And by bad I don't mean insensitive. By bad, I mean not funny over the top of it. And, but then when they show the person dead, it's really fucking creepy. They showed these two girls who kept filming each other on Youtube, doing practical jokes, wearing silly mass and scaring each other. So, uh, one of the girls brothers, uh, was a mechanic or something. So they got that air bag thing and they stuck it underneath this cushion. I sound like an old lady right now. Tell him to death story and they didn't know it was there, so she sticks it there. She tries to get a roommate to sit on and she's tugging on her roommate pulls away the girl who put it there, lands on it, it shoots are up in the air over the banister and she fucking breaks her neck and dies and they go through the whole thing, the graphics of her breaking your neck and then they just show are there with their head all twisted up.

Speaker 2:          00:21:39       It's creepy. A really creepy fucking show. Um, and then they have bad jokes over the top of it. Maybe the bad, maybe the bad jokes or on purpose. Why don't I shit on another show and just burn every fucking bridge I can out here. Um, hey. You know what? It's time for a God damn. Uh, it's time for some advertising. Here we go. Let's do it.

I thought with the amount of money that I spent on it, they would've given me some sort of program that I could have written it, but I can't. I gotta go download that. You know, there's another 20 bucks. Let's siphon that out of his fucking wallet.

Speaker 1:          00:23:41       You know,

Speaker 2:          00:23:44       I, I'm going to say I even say it, I'm just going

Speaker 1:          00:23:46       to see, you know, come see my act. I have a nice day. Have a nice all new chunk. Come see my act. Don't see me. Just come by and go see my act. A car repair bill. You're right. Fixing your car is a good feeling. I had trouble with the passenger side window for months. If finally went out on me a couple of Fridays ago and it was stuck all the way down in the door with the forecast showing three days of rain. Anyway, I ordered the part, took my door apart. Tools everywhere, dirty hands, had some music going, feeling like a man baby. I had just found out a couple hours before my wife and I are having a boy. Congratulations though. That's awesome. Uh, he goes, I didn't really know what I was doing, but I did a youtube search replacing Nissan power window motor. Boom. It was there and it, and it took me through it.

Speaker 1:          00:24:34       Yeah. That's all I've been doing. That's how I fixed my blender. Youtube is the shit. The fucking Internet is to shit. People spend so much time writing racial stuff and jerking off to porn. You could just, you could go on youtube and you could teach yourself anything. You can learn how to play guitar. You can learn to play drums, you can learn how to fix a fucking carburetor. Anything you want to do. Um, all I can tell you is stay away from expert village. I'm, their videos are short. They're not informative, they suck and they are like this fucking plague because once you get into their expert village, ah, fucking vortex, you can't get out of it. You've got to like literally shut your whole fucking computer down and start over again. Um, okay.

Speaker 2:          00:25:21       I don't know. I'm 100% for that. I fucked up the Mirror on the side of my car and

Speaker 1:          00:25:28       mmm. MMM.

Speaker 2:          00:25:31       I just have to have enough time in my schedule to just pop that thing off. I've watched a guy do it. It's simple. There's two screws, then you pop the thing off. Then there's two more. The unplugged the fucking thing. Pull it out. You stick the next one plugged the thing that Jesus was, I can't even fucking explain it. Whatever. I don't fucking, oh, hang on a second.

Speaker 2:          00:25:57       Sorry. I had to adjust my fucking white there. Um, yeah, I've actually a citizen, he has been out of town. She doesn't even know I've gone out and I've, I've fucking blown like, I think 300 bucks on tools, you know, all over the map. Some shit for cars, some shit for fixing stuff around the house. And um, you know, it's funny, she just looks at me and smiles at me like she thinks it's cute and it's really fucking annoying me. It's just motivating me to want to fix something. Like, you know, I fixed the fucking blender and I didn't get any credit. She just like, yeah, you know? Yeah, it's cool.

Speaker 2:          00:26:34       Well, I, I said what I said, I said, I said I was happy for you. I was, you know, like, no, it doesn't remember. It's like you, you wanted to throw the fucking thing out there was to cost me a couple hundred bucks to fix it for seven bucks. Right. Anything, you know, you know what it's like to go on stage and have a great set and then you come home and your bomb in your own house. That's my life people. That is my fucking life. Um, somebody sent me a douchey thing on Twitter, giving me shit about something that I said, you know, and I, I really got to learn to stop taking the bait. I didn't write the person back. I don't even know if I can even fucking talk about this. They would, they were calling me out on something, which technically they were right.

Speaker 2:          00:27:16       Hey, you said this year, act and now you're a promoting that. You know, it's a typical fucking thing where it's like, this person isn't offended by anything I fucking say, but then all of a sudden it comes around them. They're fucking world. And now they're offended and sitting there giving me shit saying I'm a piece of shit when I know God damn well you're on fucking youtube watching all my fucking videos for free watching all these other comedians videos for free, putting other people out of work. So go fuck yourself. All right. See that that was all in code. That's for the person who wrote me. Go Fuck Yourself. You fucking cunt. Why don't you pay for music? Why don't you pay for something? All right? You'd like uni. You're not putting people out of work. Go fuck yourself podcasts for free. It's still for free. Okay, so why don't you go skip down the street and fucking tweet to somebody who gives a fuck. There we go. Whew. Got that out of my fucking system. Do you know, understand? You know what's the worst thing about me? Aside from my general contempt for humanity, is I have a complete fucking inability

Speaker 2:          00:28:24       to not insult and curse people when I feel that I've been wronged. You know? So then I've, I've said this in my act, even when I'm right, I become wrong. You know, buddy of mine piss me off and fucking talk to him for three weeks. Finally calls me up. He's like, hey bro, have talked to you. Was everything cool? He knows everything's not cool. He knows he was a cunt all right now. And I said, no, everything's cool though. I've just been busy, but by blah blah, blah, blah. Right. Because I don't have the fucking ability at this point. I don't have the ability to, to, to be like, you know, listen, I just want to say that the other day I felt that there was a few things that were said they had, I, I, I didn't appreciate and um, I'm not sure if you meant him in that way, but I just, I just can't do that.

Speaker 2:          00:29:16       Jim called me a couple of weeks. Yes. Cause you're a cunt because of the fucking shit you said the other day and you know what you were doing it don't even fucking go fuck yourself. That's how it goes down, you know? Ah, yeah. Oh. Gives a shit. You know? You know where I really fucking can't stand is that fucking guy. He does those Ford commercials, that creepy fucking guy with that. You know what? You know what makes him so creepy? Fucking pleasant. He's got this pleasant tone. I think he used to do the dirty jobs thing. I don't know if he still does it. He wears that fucking hat with no logo on it. So you can't describe what he really looked like. You know, after he gets done feeling up your fucking daughter, he's always hanging out with people younger than him. You know, he's a guy walking down the street and uh, yeah they make, my girlfriend says it, look, it makes my butt look better. And then this fucking girl is like, Hey, nice ass. And he's like, that's not my girlfriend. That fucking guy. I don't trust people like that. That guy with his pleasant, that whole pleasant, just even Keel, just sitting there with his hands in his pockets. Just fucking 100% flat line nonthreatening. That guy, I swear to God will pour nuclear waste into the water supply for a corner office. I'm not saying him literally, but that just people like whatever, whatever that fucking images. I don't trust pleasant people. Is that my, is that my issue?

Speaker 2:          00:30:48       I ain't know, I just don't, I don't trust people like all this Tibetan monks, you know was the last time you saw in them losing their shit cause they got a parking ticket standing there and they're orange robe yelling at some overweight woman before she gets back on her fucking goddamn moped. You know, I don't trust them. You don't what it is. I like people to pray in public. I don't like, they sit around a lot or you know, or are doing that shit right. It's funny. I bet they fucking steel flat screens, all those Tibetan monks. It's why the way those long, it's where they were drapes. Just stealing all this swag out of your fucking house is one of them. Sits there just calmly smiling at you. You don't swell. They all dress the same. Just like the drug dealers on the wire, those Tibetan monks at the same fucking thing. You can't describe them. They all just start running. It's like a school of fish. You can't figure out what the fuck's going on. You know, cause I fuck that ended up trash and monks, oh whatever. If this is all just self hatred. I got it. W when is this anchor? We're going to go away. I'm a, I'm already past the halfway point. I've already played at least 10 holes in my life. I had to, if I'm going to be 44 years old, times two is 88

Speaker 2:          00:32:04       88 Eric Lindros. Hey, wait a minute. Let's see what element that is. Let's see. What all 88 is you guys interested? Is there an (888) 018-0980 eight radium, radium. Evidently it's a, it's what makes your watches glow. Radium was the titanium of the early 19 hundreds it was the brilliant, shiny, powerful element everyone wanted to associate their products with and sell it to whites only. They never have that part in, you know, they always keep that racist part like separate. Do you have any of you guys ever noticed that shit and like whenever they talk about the good old days about baseball, you know, boy, Oh boy, go see Mickey Mann all yet that Bennett in an order that take me out to the ball game. Well, whenever they show the Jackie Robinson storage, just the Jackie Robinson story and it's just about race, they never do. They never tell both those stories at the same time. Boy, Oh boy, when I saw Duke Snider by meets up peanuts and cracker jacks and they keep all of that ugliness out away from the game, then they tell the racist part separately. You know, when these fucking people with the Goddamn periodical book it, there's, there's no difference. Um, radium was the titanium of the early 19 hundreds. Uh, the Klan used to shoe their horses with it. I'm just going to fill in the shift of these. They leave out of it. Uh, just as many titanium products today contained no actual titanium. Um, many radium products of a century goes such as radium, furniture, Polish and radium. Toothpaste contained no radium.

Speaker 2:          00:33:44       Interesting. I wonder if the knobs of, of Jp Morgan, that piece of shits, fucking walking sticks had any radium and them, you know, as he pushed Woodrow Wilson into office. Why isn't that in here? You know, fuck this book. I am going to memorize it though. All right. You know what, like I said, I'm doing the hand job whisper this week and the next week I'm going to be at fly out in Burbank, California, the 25th and 26th. Okay. And if for some reason you ever wanted to see Ralph malf put together an hour of comedy, but he never did stand up. I am a wonderful substitute. I will be out there. I'm going to be at the mall people on May 25th and 26th, uh, doing my jokes or some semblance of them. I'm actually having a really good time putting together this hour because, uh, I don't know. I don't know where it's going to come from because usually I just talk about my life. And as you can tell, talking about fixing carburetors is not exactly a mainstream topic. You know, can't put together an extra five minutes for late night television talking about carburetors. Can I, how the fuck do you make that mainstream?

Speaker 2:          00:42:12       Well wouldn't it? I don't know what to tell you. You know what I, every time I do this podcast, I sit over here and I look at my guitar and my Wah Wah pedal. I'm trying to get the balls to fucking play something for you guys. But the thing is is I need to get warmed up just to suck. Forget about just being straight up awful. Um, but I'm telling you I'm growing by leaps and bounds in that thing. There's somebody having a Wah Wah pedal that's like a makes you actually sound like, you know what the fuck you doing. You know, I was going to watch one of those uh, Hall of fame rock and Roll Hall of fame thing cause they had like guns and roses and a couple of the bands that I liked in it and it was like fucking three hours long. And at that point it's just like, dude, go fuck yourself.

Speaker 1:          00:42:53       You know,

Speaker 2:          00:42:55       I don't want to watch it for fucking nine hours actually put it on. And I think it was that Guy Donovan who sang that song. Yeah. Blow the way Dan below the ocean there. Well to be z Libby when fucking uh, Joe Peci fucking killed Billy batts that song that they play. So they liked the inducted this guide Donovan and he was talking about this poetic bullshit, but I couldn't understand what the fuck you, we, I just turned it on. I hope he doesn't have something wrong with them mentally cause then I'll look like a Douche. I thought it was Brian May um, have any of my thoughts over the last 20 minutes even been like even remotely connected. Um, all right, advice. You know what it is, is I also have the stress if I have to learn my lines, so the hand job whisperer and uh, I got to get on that shit too. Um, all right, advice. Conscious three of her best friend. Hey Bill, big fan of yours from Canada and listened to the podcast every week. That's awesome. All right. I bought with my girlfriend for over four years now. Dumper, uh, we own a house together, Jesus and have the usual relationship ups and downs. I'd like your advice and how she talks about me to this lady. She calls her best friend. The friend talks relentless shit about how terrible I am and how would she be so much happier with one of her guy friends.

Speaker 2:          00:44:24       What I just got lost. The friend talks relentless shit. What your girlfriend about how terrible you are and how she'd be much happier with one of her guy friends. Oh, she's trying to fix her up with one of her friends. Even going so far as to invite them both to the same party, knowing full well, I won't be there. I've approached my lady about it and she says, I'm being paranoid. I've seen messages exchanged between the two ladies, so I know I'm not crazy. My question is how do I tell her that are best that our friend is a miserable, lonely cunt and to get her to stay out of our relationship, love the podcast, keep up the great work and go fuck yourself. Um, dude, I dunno about that whole thing. Like why do you want it? Why do you want to at this point get this girl out of your, like the, the, the, the other girl trying to like hook your girl up with guys you know, to meet instead of use is your secondary problem at this point. Your first problem is that you saw evidence of that and the, the woman you're with lied and said it isn't happening and tried to say that you're being paranoid.

Speaker 2:          00:45:41       MMM. I Dunno. I, I don't, I don't, I don't know what to tell Ya. If I was in that situation and I saw those, I, I would've, I don't know. I would've taken the phone and be like, well yeah, what the fuck is this? Once again, of course cursing, stop yelling at me. Stop acting like you're not, you're being a fucking cunt. All right. Do you not want to be in this? Let's sell this fucking house. We'll end it. I don't understand why every time we try and talk about south fuck you. That's how I'd handle it. Right? Why is she doing that Shit behind your back? Do you? This is what she's doing, dude. I think she might be out there trying to fucking, you know, treat it like monkey bars. What she's going to swing right out of your relationship into another one. Why else would she be doing that? You've seen the messages exchanged between the two ladies, so you know you're not quite, did you say that to her? I'm not being paranoid. I read your phone, right? And then you come off like you're a, that's a weird thing when you start doing some Jed Ger Hoover Shit on the person you're with and you feel like a piece of Shit snooper then when you actually find the evidence, there's no way to bring up the evidence without, without them being like, why is snooping,

Speaker 3:          00:47:02       okay.

Speaker 2:          00:47:03       You know, women can be like, I just had a feeling.

Speaker 3:          00:47:07       Yeah,

Speaker 2:          00:47:08       maybe guys can say that too. I had a feeling I had a feeling that something weird was going on. You were acting weird and my gut told me to check your phone. And I did. And I found exactly what I was failing. All right. Why are you mad at me for snooping? I was right. You know what? I'd have to get a fucking search warrant. This isn't a show. Go Fuck Yourself. I was right. See, that's what I do. And then it's, it's just, you know, becomes about me cursing. Um, all right, well let's say for whatever reason you want to stay with this girl. So your question is, how do I tell her that a friend is a miserable, lonely cunt and to get her to stay out of the relationship?

Speaker 1:          00:47:47       MMM,

Speaker 2:          00:47:51       that's a tough one because it's her friend. You know what? You have to do

Speaker 2:          00:47:59       everything l all the way that I talk don't talk that way. But you got to do is you have to go out and you have to buy a sweater. Just ride with me on this one. All right. You got to buy a sweater and maybe like some penny loafers and some dockers. You put the whole thing together, part your hair on this side, like Mr. Rogers and then you just sit down at the kitchen table with your hands folded in front of you. Like somebody trying to be the teacher's pet and you just wait for her to come home.

Speaker 1:          00:48:35       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:48:35       It's going to totally catch her off guard, but you're going to be dressed so I'm pleasantly like that. Duchenne, all those commercials that she's not going to feel threatened. She's just going to be a little creeped out and just be like, how do you, what? What? Why you sitting here by yourself dress like Mr. Rogers. Just be like, ah, I just did something we need to talk about. And you just sit her down, ed. You just tell her that, you know. See, I don't know how to do it without getting mad and cursing.

Speaker 1:          00:49:04       MMM.

Speaker 2:          00:49:08       I just don't understand why you're hanging out with this person. She keeps trying to get it in the middle of our relationship. I don't have any friends who are doing that and I feel like you're choosing your friendship. I feel like your friendship with her was more important than your relationship with me.

Speaker 3:          00:49:23       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:49:24       All right, and if that's the case, then we need to sell the house at night. I'll say that next. I don't know what the fuck to tell you, dude. I don't want to tell you dude, because I wouldn't do this. I mean you, you said, how do I tell her? Tell her that a friend is a miserable, lonely cutting to get stay out of the relationship. That's what I would say.

Speaker 1:          00:49:42       You know?

Speaker 2:          00:49:44       Listen, your friend is a miserable, lonely, can't all right. I'm sick of her button into our relationship. Then every night she'd go out and be like, oh, you're hanging out with them. Miserable lonely content. I want to say, can you hang out with that and miserable chick? Tell her I said, what's up? How many bad things is she going to say about me tonight? I don't know, Dude. I Dunno. That's fucked. That whole thing is fucked up. I don't know if you can't do that. You know what I would do if I was you, I'd start finding some good looking women to hang out with.

Speaker 1:          00:50:17       You know,

You know, I could get out there in 45 minutes with traffic. You know, it's going to be like three hours at a, I'm actually getting a hotel sitting in a hotel for 45 minute drive from my house. Um, but whatever shows are going to be great. Uh, July 14th to be at the Hampton Beach Casino Ballroom, Newport Yachting Center. July 15th, Carolines on Broadway. 26th to the 29th of July.

I'm not going to all the football teams. I haven't seen, um, this year while whilst building my new hour and right about then my new hour will become announced. They go, I've got a couple of a down home once, Orlando, Jacksonville and uh, Charlotte, North Carolina nine Oh people Orlando with you think you hit because Shaq lives there as does tiger woods, you know, I dunno. I, you know what, I don't know what I think about. I don't know anything about Orlando, Florida. What do you guys do there? You got that, the fucking old ass a Disney world. Is that what it is? The Epcot Center there was actually built when Rubik's cube was still fascinating. Is that still good down there? Disneyworld? I haven't been there since. I was like, well last time I was there, um, last time I was there, the fucking Epcot center look like the death star in one of those when they were just building it and one of those star wars movies that those nerds like to watch. You know, I really can tell you guys how much I fucking hate star wars.

Speaker 2:          00:55:51       Hate Star was so much that I only like empire strikes back because he almost kills Han Solo and he chops his hand off. Right. Um, no, wait, that was Luke Skywalker, right? All the nerds just freaked out. How could you confuse them? Um, yeah, it just wasn't into it. And I also thought Chewbacca was fucking useless. Meet Shabaka was basically big foot. They just gave it a different name. Typical Hollywood movie, you know, steal an idea, give it a different name, and then stand there being like, what, what? I don't owe you any money. You know that Chewbacca like fought the $6 billion man like six years earlier on television. Booty. People saw him with his bionic eye. Right. And they find each other and then a few years later he's at ease and space. No, wait, that would, the big foot was Andre the giant. Yeah. And all they did was fill in his face and then he had Chewbacca. I just didn't fucking get, I don't understand Chewbacca, the fucking, uh, it's like an orangutan or something rang a Tan, I would say. Rang a Tang, like the drink rang a Tan. That's what it was. Right. Why are you shooting a gun?

Speaker 2:          00:57:16       Did Hand Solo go run up to Darth Vader and try to bite his neck like a fucking tiger? I didn't get it. I didn't like, I didn't like Chewbacca. I didn't like how he sat up. Right. You know what I mean? I didn't like that whole, I didn't, I just didn't like it and I hated the fucking robots, you know? I thought c three Po was just a rip off of that dude from lost in space. The Gay guy running around. Um, how the fuck did that guy ever end up on a space trip? I mean, he just didn't have the, he just didn't have the, she didn't have the, the, uh,

Speaker 3:          00:57:59       I dunno,

Speaker 2:          00:58:01       what's the word I'm looking for? He just didn't have the chemical makeup to do with like, the guy was like absolutely scared of his own fucking shadow. Why in God's name would he get on a space ship and travel through space when he has stayed home, you know? Well, Shit, Bill, you don't understand how planes fly. Get you get you get on every fucking week, don't you? Um, the hell was I talking about? Let's try to work our way back here. $6 million man fucking bigfoot Sasquatch. Oh, Epcot sell the fucking Disneyland. I mean, it's got to look like the God damn projects at this point, doesn't it? Did they keep it up? Did they work on it? Um, I mean, what can they really offer you at this point? Did they make the rides bigger for all the fatties people weren't nearly as fat the last time I went there when I went down there, the big thing to do is when you went to Florida was you got one of those Mesh shirts that had the number on it and it said Florida 78, 79 or [inaudible] 80. That was like a big deal. And um, he pulled you tube socks up to your knees. You had little Larry Bird shorts on and you will probably wearing Adidas dragons or a either Nike Cortez or the, the, the, the nylon ones. The blue ones with the yellow stripe

Speaker 2:          00:59:20       or swoosh. I think that was about it. And then the broke kids weren't Tom mccants, you know, and socks said the of the elastic thing was fucked up, up top. And that was it. That's the last time I went.

Speaker 2:          00:59:34       Oh No, wait. I, I went there about a year ago, two years ago. I don't fucking know. Florida's a weird state, you know, they got all that, all that money down there in Miami. And other than that, you got a bunch of people live in with mosquitoes trying to act like they got money. You know, even the mansions down there in Florida, they all look like the fucking cheesecake factory, don't they? He likes some like Americanized version of like a Mexican restaurant. And they have like those manmade, like fake lagoons. They put people out there and like every other day, like somebody gets murdered or a hurricane hits the house. It's just a horrible fucking state. And I'm going to be performing there on, uh, September.

Speaker 2:          01:00:16       Oh Shit. You know what I got into, I got into the fucking NBA playoffs. I finally got into it and um, I'm loving it. I'll back into basketball. I got no choice to Bruins were knocked out, but I got to tell you, I fucking hate to, I hate the officiating. Okay. The officiating is the fucking worst. She can't even like bump into anybody. You can't go near anybody if there's any sort of touching of human beings, those fucking jerk offs blow the whistle and they just stick, kill the drama. Just let them play the fucking game. You know, it's the worst. Yesterday was I was watching the Lakers playing Denver and uh, Pau Gasol, the worst thing that ever happened was Paul was, Saul got called out for being soft. They called them the tin man after the will, they lost to the Celtics in the finals.

Speaker 2:          01:01:04       So now he's like trying to be this hard ass guy. So anytime, like he'll, like he's trying to tip the ball, he tips it up again, tips it up again. Then it finally goes in. Then he tries to do the Kevin Garnett, you know, primal scream. He's like, ah, right. And he tries to act like he's just fucking bad ass, but anytime he gets called for a foul, you see the real him. He'll tip it in, it'll dunk, go do all this stuff and standing there going around, punching this chest, and then like the second they call a file on me, he's just like,

Speaker 2:          01:01:44       just say what his fucking mouth hanging open and just shaking his head head. You know, he just seems like you'd have a really like soft handshake, you know? It's probably good at playing the piano. I'm just not buying it. Um, what do you guys stick to next round? We'll at me talking basketball. I don't know shit about it. I still only know four Celtics. I know the big four. That's it. I don't know anybody else I ever watched. I haven't watched one fucking game this year. Um, I went to one basketball game, went to the Lakers, Oklahoma game. When Metta world peace, um, throw an elbow and I love how everybody judged him about deck. Oh well he's name is metta world peace, but he fucking elbow Sabine the head. Dad's dot. Two peaceful as it, right. Well, what about God? You know he's supposed to be, you know, the, the, the king of peace and all I hear is how he's mad at me and his son's going to come down here and murder a bunch of people throwing lightening bolts on the back of some fucking seven edit horse. You know, what would you do if, if Metta world peace was the second coming of Christ? Wouldn't that be fucking awesome? I would love to go to some area and meeting after that if they just proved it without a fucking doubt that that was the son of God.

Speaker 5:          01:03:06       Yeah.

Speaker 2:          01:03:07       Do you know how much I pray for shit like that or like for the toughest guy in the NFL did just come out of the closet and say he's gay and then continuing to kick the shit out of people. Those are the kinds of things that I want to see, you know, at this point. I mean, what the fuck else you gotta do it right? They got cars that are going to start parking themselves. Do you see that? The ditsy broad they had in the car, that Ford focus commercial with that dose, with the hat, with no label on it, you know,

Speaker 2:          01:03:35       um, she's just saying like, oh my God, that car's like parking itself. What was that movie with that stupid little robot? The cartoon and it had people in the future and there was so fat that they couldn't fucking move. They just sort of sloshed around, didn't they like remote control wheel barrels? You remember that there was a little robot that looked like a blender and of course it had some sort of relationship with like a fucking, I dunno, nail gun. I don't, I don't remember movies. There's gotta be a love story that's gotta be hard. I don't know what the fucking movie was. You know what it was? It was called iPod Wally. Wasn't there some Wally in there?

Speaker 3:          01:04:18       Yeah,

Speaker 2:          01:04:19       I dunno. Whatever. But they said everyone was gonna be so fat and the fucking future that they, that we stopped, we didn't have legs anymore and all these people got fucking offended and here they are. They're making all this shit. You don't even have to think anymore. Does that even make sense? Do you do have to thank, don't Ya.

Speaker 3:          01:04:39       Yeah.

Speaker 2:          01:04:39       You know, I, this is one of these podcasts I should have ended 10 minutes ago because every, you know what I sound right now, I sound like somebody who says they didn't commit the murder and I'd keep hanging around talking just further con convicting myself. I keep saying I'm not dumb

Speaker 2:          01:04:54       and I just keep doing things just to say otherwise. Um, all right. Here's the deal. I'm doing the, uh, the hand job whisper this week and then I'm, I'm performing it. Flappers that's my, may I get jealous, um, in June. Then I'm doing some other stuff and just come on out and see me and a w eight. Let me send me some, uh, some movies that I should go see that I'll then and spliced together with other movies. You guys can laugh at me. Uh, that's it. Uh, hey, keep going to, why amazon.com through my website. Go to [inaudible] dot com click on the podcast page and click on the banner for Amazon. If you want to go buy something, if you do buy something, they'll kick me back a percentage. It doesn't cost you any more money. In 10% of that goes to the wounded warrior project.

Speaker 3:          01:05:47       Okay.

Speaker 2:          01:05:49       Oh, that's how businesses, um, anyways, that's a podcast for this week. Go fuck yourselves. Um, my predictions, um, I want to say the kings are going to beat Phoenix this point. That games should be over. I want to say it, but there's just something about a,

Speaker 3:          01:06:08       okay.

Speaker 2:          01:06:09       You know, I don't want to jinx him. Ellie's never won a Stanley Cup, right? Neither is Phoenix, but they haven't been waiting that long. So I got a roof la and then you got the, uh, New York rangers versus the, uh, the country, New Jersey, Denver, Denver, New Jersey devils and um, I dunno, I think the devils are going to win just because they just play, play that fucking goddamn defense and you can't get around it. Then he got a dumping in and chasing. I'll up fucking bullshit. Who knows? That's the podcast for this week. Go fuck yourselves. I will see you next week. God bless, Eh, uh, that's it. All right.
