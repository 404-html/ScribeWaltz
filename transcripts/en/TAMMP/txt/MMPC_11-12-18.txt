Speaker 1:          00:00:01       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:00:01       Hey, what's going on? It's bill burr and it's time for the Monday morning podcast for Monday, November 12th, 2000 and fucking 18. I still haven't fixed this stupid microphone. Um, how are you? How's it going? How's it going in your world? I know everybody who hates the Patriots is, is, is happy today. Jesus Christ. What? A bunch of babies, man. I've never seen a fucking team while maybe not to dupe, I guess we used to fucking hate the Yankees like that, but it's just like every time we lose a fucking game, it's like eight days. Yeah. Other wheels coming. Oh, I mean, how many fucking times? One of these times it's going to be the end. Cherub. Brady's fucking 41 years old. All these fucking jerk offs talking shit. And by the way, Dion Louis out were really disappointed with that.

Speaker 1:          00:00:52       Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:00:52       They asked them, was it personally? He said, is it personal? He said, hell yeah. It's personal. That's what happens when you go cheap. You get your ass kicked. It's like, dude, this isn't something new. This, this was going on way before when you would like fucking eight years old. This is the way they ran the team and you went in there and you got yourself a ringer to, what's the problem? Jesus Christ. Yeah, it is what happens. Would you go cheap? You'll lose a game in November. These guys just acted like they just knocked this out of the fucking playoffs. Um, however,

Speaker 2:          00:01:25       I couldn't help but think when I did not watch one second and that game yesterday, sorry, I was flying back from Chicago. I watched some highlights of it and uh, I hadn't seen my Kiddo in like a week. So, you know, obviously I'm not going to come home and sit down and watch a fucking football game. I do have it on tape. I am going to fucking watch it or whatever. What have you, what? Whatever you kids call it. I have to, I have it on the cloud. Um, yeah, it just sounded like, you know, they, they were the better team. They fucking came in. They were ready to go. We weren't, and we got behind early in and, and we didn't win the game, you know, I don't know. I want to be seven and three. I don't know what the fuck everybody's is. You know, this guy just goes, it's just, just a blip on the radar as it were, played 700 ball. That's how high the fuck standards. So anyways, um, have a, I think the titans just won a fucking championship according to Dion Lewis. You know, I don't get it. I love that guy. But like I was, you know?

Speaker 1:          00:02:23       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:02:23       You know what I mean? I like it. I don't understand why people say shit like that. In November, if you learned anything in New England, you know that November you didn't win anything. You won a game. That's it. Congratulations. I got to tell you though, I couldn't help but think about that lunatic that I saw in that sports bar in New York City a few weeks ago when the Patriots were playing the chiefs and now that guy was just yelling, go and fucking, you know, this is it. This is how it is. Now you guys are over looking around the bar. It's over. Right? I can't imagine. I was psyched. He was yesterday when the Patriots loss and the chiefs one cause now I believe the chiefs have a two game lead despite head to head. You know, we won the game, but like that's a really good look for them. If we got to try to beat them again. Uh, in Kansas City, well the cheeks finally pushed their way through. I gotta be honest, if the chiefs still get through, if they do get past us, if we can actually make it there, if I can fucking hear myself and this fucking piece of shit. Microphone.

Speaker 3:          00:03:33       MMM.

Speaker 2:          00:03:36       If they do beat us or whatever that, that, that will be the team that I root for in the Superbowl because Jesus Christ, they m and a one and since like fucking Bart Starr was in the league, I think he might have just retired. By the way, the last great number 15 at quarterback brightstar no offense to Neil Lomax.

Speaker 3:          00:03:55       MMM.

Speaker 2:          00:03:56       Anyways, what else? I am done for the year. People with road dates other than this little trip I have to take to New York to promote F is for family season three, which comes out in November 30th on Netflix.

Speaker 3:          00:04:08       Um, I mean Tom

Speaker 2:          00:04:12       and I ain't doing fucking shit except hanging out with my daughter. You know what I, I

Speaker 3:          00:04:18       okay.

Speaker 2:          00:04:19       We are relative. Ours got out, got her out one of those electric fucking cars, you know, that they can sit in. I came home and I put that thing together. It was fucking hilarious. She got on the thing, she didn't get it and took a couple of times just pushing the button and then she just, she actually took a finger off the button, laughed and clapped her hands. Like this is the shit. So

Speaker 3:          00:04:42       okay.

Speaker 2:          00:04:42       You know, cause one of my big days is a dad

Speaker 2:          00:04:46       coming up. I Dunno. Maybe depending on how tall she is, sometime when she's around 11 or 12. So I'm going to teach her how to drive my truck, which shifts a three on the column, you know, which no fucking kid in l for the most part knows how to drive a stick anymore. Forget about one in the column. So I think it'd be pretty bad ass if I teach her how to do that. And that's something when I was a kid, my dad used to do that. He used to take us down to the South Shore Plaza when I was like 12 years old, 11 and 12. And I go down there.

Speaker 3:          00:05:18       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:05:18       Yeah. 1978, uh, Chevy Chevette four speed transmission. And that was back when, um,

Speaker 3:          00:05:29       okay.

Speaker 2:          00:05:29       The uh, the mall was closed on Sunday cause everybody, you know, allegedly was going to church and on the seventh day God rested and, and you know, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, all that shit. So, you know, you couldn't sell any liquor, you couldn't sell any booze. Um, you couldn't be open like grocery stores would be open. But that was basically it. And, uh, they had like Sunday hours, you know. So we used to go down there in the empty a parking lot and he would, she taught all his kids out of drive down there. We learned on a stick shift. And I remember when I went to go get my driver's license, I took it on a stick. I think it was that car. Now we would've got rid of it by that. No, no, no, that's right. That'll, we still had it. We still had it. 1984 would only be six years old, even though a fucking tree fell on it. We got it fixed. Yeah. I went down and took in. I don't remember the guy made me park on a hill, you know, doing that shit. And I was like, ah, fuck. All right, here we go. Just don't stall out here and then you're going to be fine. You've got to be fine. It's one of the few tests that I passed.

Speaker 1:          00:06:40       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:06:40       During those years, everything else, everything else that I guess really fucking matter that would have led to a nicer car. I failed.

Speaker 3:          00:06:50       But then I,

Speaker 2:          00:06:52       I started doing comedy at all. Boy, everything happened for me. I got to play at the Chicago theater. Everybody

Speaker 2:          00:07:02       for foreign, credible shows. I want to thank everybody that came out. We had such a great time. Um, when we were there, we didn't make it to the Liar's club. I, as you can tell, I've been fighting off a cold and it just, the last time we went to the Liar's club and man, I was there till like four in the fucking morning and didn't wake up till five in the afternoon and then did a show at the Chicago theater. I felt like it was breakfast time. I had literally just had eggs and walked on stage. And these poor people who have been working all fucking day, Anna came out, they're like this fucking bum silicon shelda cause I'm a pro. I'm fucking with you. Anyways. Um, we ate it, this place, a new place we went to in Chicago. Splays Gibsons and we got a stake creamed spinach was fucking unbelievable. And then in the end I got to get the name of this fucking thing that these guys said. They go, do you want dessert? And you know, when you go out and get a steak, you know, if you get like the filet minion and it's the smart way to go, but there's no flavor in it. It's really bland. They was going to have a lead dipping sauces with it. So I got some bone in Ribeye.

Speaker 2:          00:08:09       I hate that thing like fucking Fred Flintstone. So now I'm sitting there, even though we didn't get potatoes or anything, I'm still, I'm fucking leaning.

Speaker 2:          00:08:18       I eat the whole thing. I should have cut it in half. I didn't fucking leading. And then these guys come over and they were like, hey you do you want dessert? And we'll like, Nah, Nah, Nah, we're good, we're good. And they were like, no, no. So some of the wages went to the show last night. They want to bring you over a, they want to bring you over a fucking desert. Right? Trying to find this Gibson's menu. Chicago. Hang on a second. I got to, I have to upload a fucking picture of this thing. They brought this God damn piece of cake. It's fucking piece of cake. All that. I swear to God. It was like, it was like a whole cake. Something like Banana Dream Boat. When I saw the menu, I was saying to my, Oh somebody, I forget who I said and he's like, go, I'll give you 20 bucks if you just fucking order this. Just cause I want to hear you say it out loud. Gibson's menu. All right. What is it called? Hair. Hang on. Hang on. All right, here's the menu. What do we got here? The meaning of life cake. That wasn't it. Pumpkin Pie, but any cream pie. Ah, yeah. Then fuck it. Habit.

Speaker 1:          00:09:20       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:09:21       With something like Banana Dream Boat. I already know what it was, but it was also, it was these birthday and we took him out to breakfast. Right. And we ended up getting them. They know we go, it's his birthday. So it was breakfast and they brought over like some fucking one of those chocolate whipped cream. Uh

Speaker 1:          00:09:45       Yeah,

Speaker 2:          00:09:45       fucking waffles or whatever.

Speaker 1:          00:09:48       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:09:48       Can we sang happy birthday to him is loud as humanly possible in the thing. Just getting right in his face. And I was actually joking with furs. He has go, you know what I got? That's why guys are funny because if we were women that actually would have been sincere. He was just sitting there fucking embarrassed to shit. It was such a great time. So, um, anyways,

Speaker 2:          00:10:16       I'll be honest with you, I really don't have a lot to fucking talk about. I've been just fighting off this God damn cold. Oh I know. And I can talk about, so when I was in, yeah, when I was in Chicago, you know, I told my travel agent, I go book me, book me in a Nice Hotel, close to the fucking um, the venue. Now I'm a fancy man at this point, so I don't even handle any of that shit. I finally learned how to delegate stuff cause I was doing my whole career. I was like fucking Chuck Berry. The way he drive up to the venue in his own car with his fucking guitar in the backseat. That's what I was doing,

Speaker 2:          00:10:51       you know, which adds a ton of fucking responsibility and shit. Cause then you got to tell your openers were all where the hotel is. You got to go in and you got to check out. I never had a fucking tour manager. Never did that shit. Cause uh, you know, I'm an antisocial son of a bitch and all I'm thinking is this is just going to be another fucking guy I have to talk to and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. And I'm just going to be that down to Earth fucking guy who just fucking blah blah blah. You know, just comes walking in. Well that's what I did. And guess what? Now I'm getting text messages from people who work at fucking Avis, where I rented a car, you know, fucking eight years old, you remember me, you rented a Ford Focus. You could to get stupid stupid fucking move. That's what being down to earth gets you, gets a bunch of people fucking calling you up. You know the did, she had a two second interaction with her, right? So if you learn anything on this podcast, all right? As you move up the ladder, it's very important to forget where you came from. All right? And what you want to do is treat people who you feel your ego tells you are not a year level. You want to treat them less than. Okay. But there is, there is a certain level, you know.

Speaker 1:          00:12:16       Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:12:16       Well you have to kind of dial it back. Like I went out and I did a fucking meet and greet, you know one time when I was in Reno this guy goes take a picture of my wife and I got find any reaches in his jacket to fucking take out a camera and a nine millimeter fell on the fucking ground

Speaker 2:          00:12:33       and I pointed at the gun and went oh shit. And watched him pick it back up again. Like a fucking, I should have kicked it. I should have done some sorta Steven Seagal move. But you know that's, I mean I didn't grow up around guns. I was just like, Oh I think you dropped something. Serve. Fortunately it was an off duty cop, although he ran out of there cause it was a native American reservation. They weren't, we were on their land in union, not allowed to bring a, a, a weapon in there. Probably your specialty as a white man considering what happened the first time around, they probably don't want fucking white people coming in with guns anymore. Right. So, um, there was that, there was another time I had a group of people followed me home from the venue and I got out of the car and there was the, hey, bill is, I got out. I was just like, oh fuck, what's going to happen? You know, that little mini heart attack. Are you going to kill me? Oh, you just want a picture, right? So anyways,

Speaker 1:          00:13:24       okay.

Speaker 2:          00:13:25       Um, I'm one of those people, I know what airline of flying as I drive to the airport, I do that Shit, right? So we're on our way to Chicago, uh, like the night before. So I asked my travel agent, you know, where would stay? And he said the Trump hotel and I was like, Oh shit. All right, Trump hotel. Donnay okay, so we fucking stay there man. And I didn't understand. I know that people don't like Donald Trump, but I don't want, I didn't understand that they also don't like his buildings because the fucking jerk off his, put his name on every building. So now when people hate him, they, they, you know, his name is there. So they stand in front and they do all of this fucking Shit, right? Like, you know, fuck you done outside of the thing. So anyway, so we go in there, of course, it's fucking incredible. It's fucking beautiful. The service was amazing. The food was incredible. Everything. And there was great, like, this is what he's good at. This is what he should have stayed doing. This is his wheelhouse. You know what I mean? This is like Elvis, keep singing. The songs do, don't make the fucking movies. So anyways,

Speaker 1:          00:14:34       okay.

Speaker 2:          00:14:34       We were saying in there all weekend, we had a great fucking time, you know, quick walk down to the, uh, the, uh, the venue, right? So I say to Nia, I go near, you know, I go, you're not believe what? I'm Sam standing in a Trump hotel. She goes, no, not, I'm like, yeah, yeah, I had him fucking, I didn't book it. You know, I just, I show, I worry about the shows now. This is great. I don't have to fucking think about anything. So she's breaking my balls, right. Going like, is it the greatest hotel ever? You don't do on that show? I go, you know, it's kind of fucking nice. I'm not gonna lie to you. So I actually took a video,

Speaker 1:          00:15:12       okay.

Speaker 2:          00:15:13       Um, of the, of the Roman, all that and the view I had and everything, and she wrote back to me, she goes, I got to admit that best it makes it nice hotel. So anyways, I, uh,

Speaker 1:          00:15:27       okay.

Speaker 2:          00:15:27       I ran into somebody that I knew at the, at the airport, he's like, oh, you know, where were you working with talking blah, blah, blah, blah. And he's, you know, somehow where I stayed came up and I mentioned it to him, so he starts breaking my balls. He's like going, you know, that guy's not a good person. It's like, yeah, I agree with that. And he goes, you should spend your money elsewhere. And like, well look, he's still fucking president. So like me not staying there. Is that somehow not going to make him president? And he's like, no. He's like, Oh, you know a horrible fucking person and Yada Yada Yada. And I go, so where should I stay there?

Speaker 2:          00:16:02       The Hiltons, the Sheridans like they're all good people, aren't they all billionaires? Like who the fuck do you think they voted for? Like, yeah, you know, I don't know. I've kind of bugged me a little bit with everybody having to give everybody a fucking lecture. It's like you're really going to sit here and as you hold the fucking apple laptop computer, have you ever read about them? I'll tell you the ones that had people leaping to their deaths at their fucking sweat shop, cause they, they, they, they had to work so much. It didn't, you made so little, their lives was so helpful. Helpless. They were jumping out of the factory. So they had to fucking putting nets up around the fucking thing, you know? And then they played soothing music and then they considered possibly giving them more money, which was really the solution. So, I mean,

Speaker 1:          00:16:47       okay,

Speaker 2:          00:16:47       all the clothes I'm wearing, what? I really want to see the people's lives who have to fucking put it together. We wake up, we're going to stop this. You know, you gotta give me a lecture as we're getting on a fucking plane that uses fuel. Where do we get the fuel to get it from the Middle East? What the fuck's going on over there? How many innocent people have died over the bullshit that we're putting in this fucking plane? Okay. While we're trying to liberate them, you know, so I dunno. It's just, it's a, it's a, I understand. You know,

Speaker 1:          00:17:14       I dunno.

Speaker 2:          00:17:16       I don't like Donald Trump. Okay. Mostly just his racial views is what really, you know, that's, that's what I really don't like that guy. Okay. I didn't fucking vote for the guy. All right. Why don't we tell you this? The guy makes a hell of a fucking hotel.

Speaker 1:          00:17:30       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:17:30       I wish that's what he was still doing exclusively. And I'm sure you guys are gonna give me shit and some out, you know, take out your frustration on him, on me. The fact that I fucking, you know, stayed there, but I'm telling you, you know,

Speaker 1:          00:17:47       okay,

Speaker 2:          00:17:48       if you kind of play that fucking game, you

Speaker 1:          00:17:50       got to, you got to do with straight across the board, where are you going to go pick and choose. Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:17:56       Because you know that's another, that's like another, like I feel like it's, it's, it's almost the way, like when you go to a, when somebody goes to a comedy show and they laugh at all the fucking jokes until I drive across their front yard, then all of a sudden I didn't do a joke now and making statements and their feelings are fucking hurt. It's like if you really care to that level going, this guy's a bad fucking person, then I would say that you would really be limiting that you should be staying at some sort of mom and pop fucking hotel. If you can find it as you then go down and try to find some organic fucking guy that's not a corporate farmer, you know, cause they've poisoned the food. I mean you start going down that road or maybe, I guess you could just pick your battle.

Speaker 1:          00:18:42       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:18:43       I have no idea. But I will tell you this, that hotel was so fucking nice. I actually weighed my wife getting mad at me. I just call I Sydney, are you gonna get mad if I stay at another one of these? And she laughed. She goes, yes, you fucking assholes. I said, all right, fair enough. So whenever I'm wanting done what had done like the titans beat the Patriots, congratulations on your huge victory in November.

Speaker 1:          00:19:06       You know,

Speaker 2:          00:19:08       they should have a trophy for fucking teams like that. And I can't say I'm not picking them. I may pick on the titans. I just didn't like what Deon Louis said, you know, you didn't talk any shit before the fucking game and then you fucking win and now you're going to run your fucking Yap. The Fuck Outta here. You hate this organism. You, you just, you know what it is. You know what it is. He said, fucking, you know, he's fucking mad that he wants to please. All I hear is I still want to play for the Patriots. Well, use it to page agenda. They got a woody way here. They got the flu, whatever the door is working with blah, blah, blah, blah. And all of a sudden when you get caught up in the Washer, that all of a sudden the patriots are fucking assholes. Patriot's day at a Trump hotel. Some of them do. Anyways. Um, anyways, is there a Clinton hotel I could stay at? Maybe get back in your people's good graces.

Speaker 1:          00:19:59       Jesus Christ.

Speaker 2:          00:20:01       We got to meet to Robin. That one. Oh, Bill, come on. You know, I just feel like you're better than that. Hey, let's bring people back together here. Um, where was the, what the fuck is this story? I was Google news. Hey, about those Bros, man, they're starting to play out, right? Oh, the side of the fucking put it together. I watched them play, uh, the Toronto game when I was there in Chicago and I had a flashback when I played the Chicago theater with Jamie, nor a Jim Brewer in David tell on the antisocial tour. I can't believe it was seven fucking years ago. And I remember I was in uh,

Speaker 1:          00:20:43       the green room.

Speaker 2:          00:20:46       Yeah. At the end of the, and I was late

Speaker 1:          00:20:48       to the meet and greet cause I was watching the fucking Bruins win the Stanley Cup. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:20:52       Former Clinton advisor, Hillary will run in 2020. If she ever becomes president, that's going to be a great 30 for 30.

Speaker 1:          00:21:04       MMM.

Speaker 2:          00:21:05       Cause she's going to run again. She feels she's thinks it's her job. Please Democrats don't fuck it. Oh my God. How many fucking times? How many times? How many times are you gonna play Marty Ball? Can you get somebody in there?

Speaker 1:          00:21:23       All right.

Speaker 2:          00:21:25       There's gotta be somebody else. They can't tell me. The Democrats are going to be dumb enough to hit shift fucker wagon again. How many times? How many times do you put that person under center and you come away with a loss before you don't go to your second string quarterback. That's all I'm asking. This has gotta be the most politically charged podcast I've ever done. Where do I get off? Not Paying attention for getting to submit an absentee ballot, telling people who should run for president. Where the fuck was that story I was looking for? Oh Wow. The guy was in the voice of the computer in 2001 die.

Speaker 1:          00:22:08       Yeah.

I'm 26 years old and I had been feeling very confident about myself and my body. Good for you. I'm sick. I wish I felt that they way above my head. How can I, when everybody makes fun of it. I like my head and I don't care what I believe.

Speaker 1:          00:45:03       Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:45:04       Christina Aguilera said it best when she said, I am beautiful no matter what they say. Right.

Speaker 1:          00:45:12       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:45:13       And I believe her pussy was as bald as the top of my head, judging by some of her outfits. You know what I mean? I mean, the skirts was so slow. The hair would be hanging out underneath. Right. Oh, pill. Why? Why? Why do you have to be so crass? Cause I'm not funny. You know, when you're not funny, you go right to the genitals. I mean, it's, it's one of the oldest, oldest is one of the oldest things in comedy. I'm 26 years old and been feeling good about my body. I'm single with no boyfriend or even dating. Can I get down? I have a good time. Go by a fucking suitcase full of condoms and a jump on it. Oh, sorry. Anyways, my friend.

Speaker 1:          00:45:50       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:45:51       Okay. Anyways, my friends since I was 16 has told me that his wife has been uncomfortable with us talking because she's seen my pictures. Well, yeah, you sound like you're in the prime of your life. You're obviously crushing it. Uh, she told them she feels insecure and sees my pictures even before he does. He's expressed that he may not be my friend anymore because of this. While he's doing the right thing, you know, happy wife, happy life. Hey, she ain't happy. Nobody's going to be happy.

Speaker 1:          00:46:26       Uh,

Speaker 2:          00:46:28       why does he just unfollow, unfollow. You can you just do that and you guys could be friends

Speaker 2:          00:46:34       in a different way. I don't know. It's weird. That's all weird. I get where his wife's coming from. Uh, she's, you know, if my wife was Sunday, somebody, you know, and he's keys, fucking posting banana hammock pop pictures, I don't feel like that would be too comfortable with that. Right. Swing low, sweet chariot. Sorry. Um, she told me she feels insecure and sees my pictures even before he does. He has expressed that he may not be friends anymore because of this. Sorry, I had to reread that again. But I know a lot of you guys watch reality shows and they always come back and show you what you just saw. And this is not the first time I've been blocked by male friends because now this is where we need Nia because their female counterparts, our social media stalking me and claiming I'm trying to get there, man, I, I've told to tone

Speaker 4:          00:47:30       down my posts are not right how I feel because the girls take it personally and take it out on my friends. Now on some level, you know, you, you to know what you're doing, all right,

Speaker 2:          00:47:42       here's the, here's the deal, okay? Because men are weak, women are fucking gorgeous. There are certain rules that you do have to follow, all right? And for you to be as beautiful as you are and feeling as confident as you are about your body, it posted those pictures. Nothing wrong with that, but when you're, we start being friends with all these guys that are in relationships like you're single. Go be friends with guys that aren't in relationships,

Speaker 1:          00:48:11       okay?

Speaker 2:          00:48:11       It's, it's a, it's a tough thing. It's a tough thing. It's not your fault. You're pretty and you feel like fucking shown and off a little bit. Not Too slutty. Not To fucking dad will appreciate this. Uh, anyways, I've been told to tone it down or, or not to write. I feel blah, blah, blah. Uh, are these my real friends or do girls have legit reasons to be upset? Yours truly a huge fan and love to Nia and the baby. Uh,

Speaker 1:          00:48:39       okay.

Speaker 2:          00:48:39       Fuck. I might have to do an epilogue on this and getting the, uh, you know what I'm going to happen. I'm going to answer this and on Thursday, Neil, we'll give her answer. Look at that teasing the next episode like a pro. Um, listen, if you're, if you're not passively, aggressively, you know,

Speaker 1:          00:49:00       okay.

Speaker 2:          00:49:00       Being a Dick Tease, just cause you liked that attention and you're just legitimately just

Speaker 1:          00:49:06       okay.

Speaker 2:          00:49:06       You know, like how you look and saying how you feel that then I don't think you're wrong, but I don't think they're wrong either. You know what I mean?

Speaker 1:          00:49:17       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:49:18       I don't know how it works with women, but when a woman is more attractive or it makes another woman feel less attractive and it's talking to the dead guy. Yeah. That's going to be guys get like that. Right? Some guy comes up, you know, he's all fucking jacked. He's got pigment, he's got hair. I mean, how am I going to feel, you know, you don't think I'm going to truck and puff up my little freckled fucking chest, you know, try to recite some line from a fucking Sylvester Stallone movie. Huh? A, are you like Deb apple? So whatever the fuck it is, just combined movies. Um, yeah. Like this is what I would do. I would just say I would respect the women in these relationships. And what you need to do is, uh, you need to find some guys that are single to follow you.

Speaker 4:          00:50:11       All right?

Speaker 2:          00:50:14       Knowing what comes with that, like, oh my God, you look so a lot like this once you're going to be getting, uh, you know, but I wouldn't worry about it. I mean, these are great problems to have. I mean, you can be fucking ugly living under a bridge crying every Friday and Saturday night because they'll wants to go near you. So, you know, it's nice to have a lot of suitors. Uh,

Speaker 1:          00:50:37       okay.

Speaker 2:          00:50:38       I, I, if I was you, I would just, I would, I would expand.

Speaker 1:          00:50:43       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:50:44       Uh, my friend circle.

Speaker 4:          00:50:47       All right.

Speaker 2:          00:50:48       And also, you know, what can you say that you weren't posting like that? And then recently I've been posting pictures of videos. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. See? So everything was cool until you started doing that. So that's what changed seeds. Sometimes when you change as a person, you, you lose a few friends. So that's, that's what I would say. You're not historically been doing this.

Speaker 1:          00:51:10       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:51:10       You know, I don't know what your head like. You're fucking, I sell real estate head shot on there.

Speaker 1:          00:51:16       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:51:16       The family values one, and now you're out there like, what the fuck? I'm only going to be young ones.

Speaker 1:          00:51:21       Okay,

Speaker 2:          00:51:22       we're going to go out and have a good time. Then all of a sudden these people locked out of relationships. Yeah, yeah. You're gonna have a problem. You're gonna have a problem. So I don't necessarily think you're doing anything wrong. I just think that, uh, if that's the way you're going to be, you can't be around guys that are in relationships. And in fairness to them, you're going to be causing them to get into a lot of God damn arguments. All right?

Speaker 1:          00:51:42       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:51:43       And I guarantee you at least one of them is thinking about one of your pictures when he bends his fucking girl over. I mean, I'm just telling you, okay. As a guy that that's what's happening. And the woman knows it, especially when they mutter your name, bumble it. What did you say? I said, uh, we should be shared more stuff. What is sharing my life with you? A husband having an emotional affair while we are living in Tokyo.

Speaker 4:          00:52:13       Uh,

Speaker 2:          00:52:16       Hey, Billy boat act. How do you know boat act? India? That's a fucking inside joke there. You fucking boat act. That's an insult to a comedian. Uh, things have been difficult with my husband and I since we moved to Tokyo from the u s uh, went through his phone to find him messaging his new teammate all day. Not just about work stuff either. I don't know if it would be flirting, but it made me uncomfortable. There are things, he's messaging her before he even tells me. Yeah. None of that is cool. I confronted him, but he swears to me he would never do something like that to me. What should I do next? It's hard to not want to go through his phone or wonder what they're up to at work. Thank you so much and go fuck yourself. I would just tell him that because of his fucking behavior, you now have urges to go through his phone.

Speaker 4:          00:53:05       All right?

Speaker 2:          00:53:07       Would you be comfortable if I was texting a guy that I work with that much? If I was telling him personal stuff about myself before I told you it's not fucking cool. That's not cool on any fucking level. And you're 100% right. Uh, what you do about it? I don't know. I Dunno. I Dunno what the move is there.

Speaker 1:          00:53:34       I Dunno.

Speaker 2:          00:53:36       You gotta. Yeah, you gotta fucking head. Jesus Christ. Ah, relationships. Aren't they fun? All this technology, all the new fucking ways. So this is all, there's so many fucking people out there, men and women who we not doing the shit that they would be doing, posting fucking sexy pictures of yourself at the whole fucking world. Could see, do you really sell fucking nuts set is that you can do that now. Then there's somebody can actually in their house look at these sexy photos of you in a robe jerk and their deck to it and then their wife walks in. What are you doing? Oh, I was just pointing down low shit.

Speaker 1:          00:54:17       Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:54:20       Uh, I think the way that you would be are interacting right now. We were never meant to interact this way. Uh, it is like the level of voyeurism that is just fucking mainstream. It's not healthy. All right. And I'm not, I'm not wagging my finger at anybody here. I mean, I stayed at a Trump hotel. Who am I to tell anybody anything? Uh, anyways, tog cruise is added again.

Speaker 1:          00:54:44       Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:54:45       All right. Y'All bill, read this on Twitter. Read this on Twitter. Wanted to hear your reaction. You think Tommy boy can pull it off? It's Tom Cruise. Whatever you're gonna say yes, he can get you fucker. Pull it off. I know you're not a fighter pilot, but I figured you're in the aviation world and understand this stuff. Okay. That's a major, I have a private pilot's license and I have under 200 hours. Uh, but I'll tell you I'm a hell of a pilot for a lot of time. I have, okay. That bar, that boy Tommy Cruz is added again, the actor who insists on doing his own stunts might be taking things even further on for Topcon to Aka top gun maverick. This is a, this is a rubric for now because it comes from an anonymous source over at the Daily Mail. In other words, it never happened, but I'll continue reading. But Cruz apparently was to re re really fly a fighter jet in the movie, not just pretend if this is true, we'll know about it soon because Cruz is never shy about publicly about publicity regarding his craziest studs. I certainly wouldn't be surprised that this turned out to be the real deal though. Um,

Speaker 1:          00:55:56       yeah,

Speaker 2:          00:55:57       no, it's not publicity. He's selling the movie and if he fucking flew a helicopter nose down and do a goddamn ravine, yeah, they're going to talk about it. Um, yeah. That's not true. There's no way. That's fucking true.

Speaker 1:          00:56:09       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:56:12       I actually did a little research on this question in f 35 costs just south of $100 million. You're not going to stick a fucking actor in there. Uh, now they might, if he could fly two people in it, which I don't know, they might put him up there with the fucking instructor. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:56:30       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:56:30       Okay. And let him fly the fucking thing around and uh, they could do it that way and then just digitally remove that guy from the fucking phone. The, uh, the, the, the shot or whatever. I Dunno, just Tom Cruise. If anybody's going to do it, I would imagine it would be him, but there's no fucking way they're going to let them fly one solo.

Speaker 1:          00:56:54       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:56:55       I mean, that's probably the entire budget of the fucking movie. If he crashes that thing.

Speaker 1:          00:57:00       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:57:00       He's going to parachute out. I Dunno. Uh, yeah, I would, I would say, yeah, there's no way he's going to fly it alone, but I think there's a good chance that he could, you know, flying around.

Speaker 1:          00:57:13       Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:57:13       If, uh, if there was somebody else up there with them, which I would think just be just taking the stick, you know?

Speaker 1:          00:57:20       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:57:21       Right. I can't imagine how small the movements are in that thing. Before you were inverted, you know, terrified. It would be like, okay bill, you have controls, I have controls, you have controls. Right. And then yeah, you fucking, I, I would move that thing a fucking cunt hair just to see because I worried that I would be like, totally did you want to stay in like also like if you look at the trading of that,

Speaker 1:          00:57:52       okay.

Speaker 2:          00:57:53       But God knows he's going to do it. Like when you've

Speaker 1:          00:57:56       yeah,

Speaker 2:          00:57:56       just, I don't even know what speed. Anytime you, you do those maneuvers, like they have to like tighten up their entire fucking insides. Are they a whole body to keep the blood from going down to their feet and they then passing out while they're flying? There's this, they have a suit at like compresses it and like, I mean I don't know anything about it but like what, what they're doing is, is just completely at like, you know, you just look at f one racing, the amount of, Geez, where they're calming down the straightaway when just sims hitting the brakes and then making that turn. Like their neck muscles

Speaker 2:          00:58:34       are literally off the fucking chains from just being able to hold it up. Right. And I know they have that device in now so they can kind of lead against it. But back in the day, like back in the day, those old schools, stock car drivers like Dale Earnhardt, if you ever went to fucking try to choke that guy to death, he could just sit there staring at you. What he drank a beer is you squeezed with all your might be like trying to choke out a fucking Louisville slugger and those guys who just go on, you know, 200 miles an hour, I can't imagine, you know.

Speaker 1:          00:59:06       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:59:06       Is every mach speed of sound, is that what it is? Mach one is the speed of sound. Is that or is it a thousand miles an hour? I can't even fucking remember. But those plays could basically do shit that the human body can't even fucking handle it this point. Um,

Speaker 3:          00:59:21       okay.

Speaker 2:          00:59:21       If it

Speaker 3:          00:59:22       wasn't Tom Cruise, if it wasn't Tom Cruise, I would be confident to say that they won't let them do it. But it is Tom Cruise. It is part of his brand and that's how it works out here. Your brand, uh,

Speaker 2:          00:59:38       I'm going to say he's going to go up with an instructor or they're going to be flying.

Speaker 3:          00:59:43       Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:59:44       Slow and he's gonna do some shit. That's what I want. That's what I'm going to guess. He's going to learn how to invert it and stuff like that. And this guy's going to be, he's going to be on with him. In other words, he's also on the fucking controls and uh, I dunno. I mean, Jesus quite, you're talking about a guy that hung onto the side of a fucking plane while it took off, flew the pattern in Quebec around and landed. I mean, I wouldn't put anything past that guy.

Speaker 3:          01:00:13       You know,

Speaker 2:          01:00:15       and I get all the respect to the world for him because all I do was memorize, memorize my lines. It'd be like I stop on that piece of tape and then I say it. Okay. That's the level of work that I put into it. I'm kidding. I actually think of a decent actor. All right. Then you can see it, you know, right now in New York and La with the limited release of the front runner starring Hugh Jackman.

Speaker 3:          01:00:39       MMM.

Speaker 2:          01:00:40       Who may or may not be a guest on this podcast. Later on this week, we shall see. We shall see all Billy a list. Huh? That'd be the biggest fucking guest. Have a got, I think, uh, be right up there with all of them. The biggest people I've gotten to this part. Okay. I have so few guests that can't fucking remember.

Speaker 3:          01:01:01       Yeah.

Speaker 2:          01:01:02       Chris Leighton was a huge one drama for Stevie Rayvon telling all those Stevie fucking stories. That was a big one. Uh, but anyways, the front runner will, will be, uh, have a nationwide release, I believe later on this week. And why don't you swing by and check it out. It's a great movie to Gary Hart's Story. All right. You Grant Vera Farmiga directed by Jason Reitman. Uh, an old freckles. Don't blink. You'll miss me. All right. Have a great couple of days. Go fuck yourselves and I'll check it on Thursday.
