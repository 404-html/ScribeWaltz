Always remember that if all of a sudden you know somebody's got something like a receipt or something and there was a couple the same numbers. That's what I'm gonna play. I'm gonna go down there and played on the megabucks. That's what they had Massachusetts megabucks.

Speaker 2:          00:00:34       My favorite one best name ever for any lottery I thought was set for life. That was just the perfect phrase every blue collar working stiff. That's what they want do just fucking set for life just sitting there having a fucking beer checks rolling in don't gotta worry about nothing set for life.

Speaker 3:          00:01:02       All right kids if you're working class you will you work paycheck to paycheck and it becomes a fuckin grind set for life. Dude I could fucking sit right here right. I COULD FUCKING SIT RIGHT HERE DO JUST FUCKING stare into my fucking toes and I still got that shit coming in every month for the rest of my life. You know why kid because I'm set for life.

Speaker 1:          00:01:29       You hear about Mikey Doty hit the fuckin set for life. He's fuckin set for life. Kid doesn't have to do shit. Fuckin cock sucker. God bless him.

Speaker 4:          00:01:44       Anyways I'm in a great goddamn mood. Why.

Speaker 5:          00:01:47       Because I get eight hours sleep last night despite the fact my daughter is just waking up and she's trying out her voice now where she sits.

Speaker 6:          00:01:58       Remember when Mariah Carey used to hit those really high notes.

Speaker 7:          00:02:01       SHE'S DOING THAT AND EVERY TIME I LOOK OVER LIKE OH MY GOD SHE'S JUST LOOKING AT ME AND SHE HAS LIKE HER LEGS ARE everything's like up in the air and she's smiling at you. It's like impossible to get upset. You just start laughing.

Speaker 8:          00:02:14       It's actually riffing about that this weekend in Grand Rapids. At one if that works as an adult. You cut somebody off in traffic and they look over you if you somehow flexible enough we could just put both arms and both legs in the air just give him that fucking baby grin.

Speaker 1:          00:02:28       That might have been the creepiest image I've ever seen. I've ever thought of. There you go. It would just creep them out. Be like oh my god that guy would be driving. I think there's something wrong with them in the mental department there. So anyways I want to thank everybody that came out to the shows at the Fountain Street Church in Grand Rapids Michigan. It is and it is continuing to be one of my favorite gigs I've ever done.

Speaker 6:          00:02:55       I know I always say I'm going to put up pictures like I didn't put up a picture my drum kit. Like I said I was going to and I'll tell you why because you know I got these cymbal stands and the ones that I want I just wanted the single bracket ones I don't like those double bracket like I'm going to go play in a fucking hurricane.

Speaker 9:          00:03:12       They weigh nine thousand goddamn pounds.

Speaker 10:         00:03:16       I accidentally ordered those instead of the ones I wanted. So I had to return those and now today I'm going to pick up the right ones I just want to have it all set up when you see it. I want you to see it right.

Speaker 11:         00:03:26       I want to have the fucking right look. I'm not going to have it like you know here's the car I bought and I don't have this fucking. The tie is on it so.

Speaker 2:          00:03:35       But speaking of drums my booking agent my Reuben Kincaid is you know.

Speaker 6:          00:03:43       Tell them how much fun I have when I go on the road. If I find a place where I can go play drums he goes you know we could put it in your rider that you know any time you do a couple nights at a theater they can set up a drum kit there and go get the fuck out of here.

Speaker 10:         00:03:56       That sounds like some diva shit he goes in he goes. Do they. They have music acts there all the time. It's no big deal.

Speaker 1:          00:04:03       So I was like All right.

Speaker 10:         00:04:05       So I show up at the Fountain Street Church and they had a fucking bear and this Yamaha kit with this fucking horrific white trash like leopard skin rap I don't know what.

Speaker 12:         00:04:21       I don't know what to call it.

Speaker 13:         00:04:22       It was like somewhere between the Stray Cats way back in the day and poison maybe you know it actually looked like the fuckin stretchy pants that the slutty girls would wear at the heavy metal concerts. It was the same kind of print. And I'm looking at those things going like What the fuck are these. And she goes Don't worry. Everybody always says that sit down and play him and the kick sounded amazing and I was able to thanks to my drum teacher.

Speaker 14:         00:04:48       You know I have a game plan when I try to tune something up and I got this snare to sound great and I went in on those fucking hilarious. I go in there on Saturday to play and I'm like about an hour before the doors open. So I went in there and I was fucking wailing on him and when I got off the kid I know what I was little.

Speaker 8:          00:05:06       I can like the place where the priest dresses and shit you know puts on all the fucking flowing ponchos and shit. And I walked out and there was no one in the church and I walked in the parking lot there was like fucking six of the security guys just standing out there.

Speaker 15:         00:05:19       It's like sorry sorry.

Speaker 16:         00:05:23       It was still it would've been great if they actually had him out on the stage.

Speaker 10:         00:05:28       I would've left him there for the show wouldn't a bug me but it would have sounded fucking unbelievable.

Speaker 6:          00:05:34       This giant church and I didn't realize because you know last time I played there only played one night it kind of came in town. I did it I was like What the hell was that. That was fucking incredible and then I left.

Speaker 13:         00:05:44       But this time I was there for like two days three nights and I was able to read up on the history of it. Listen to this shit. This is all the people that perform there because there was no bigger venue. That was the biggest venue in the I guess Western Michigan or whatever.

Speaker 6:          00:06:03       Or at least in Grand Rapids. So if anybody big came there they went there everyone. Winston Churchill spoke there.

Speaker 2:          00:06:09       Helen Keller spoke there blind and deaf learned how to fucking read and write and speak. Somehow figure that one out. Who else. Amelia Earhart. Malcolm X. They say Winston Churchill. Duke Ellington. Ella Fitzgerald. Dave Brubeck. Led Zeppelin Pink Floyd. You two in like 1984 played there.

Speaker 6:          00:06:38       I think Zeppelin and Pink Floyd was obviously on their first tours and that's just that's just what I can remember trying to picture when I was looking at the wall. Who else I saw there. I mean it was fucking incredible.

Speaker 5:          00:06:49       Eleanor Roosevelt and they have like pictures of him and their little thank you notes and shit was fucking ridiculous. B.B. King and then make that.

Speaker 1:          00:07:02       I think I said that the video that I took which I will actually post and I promise you I'll give you a picture my my drum kit this week.

Speaker 16:         00:07:11       So anyways we are on to episode two of efforts for family we're recording the first one.

Speaker 9:          00:07:18       Just remember this just remember me telling this recording the first one on July 18th 2017. You wait to see how long it takes before you fuckin see it. Fuckin animation it takes forever. But anyway let's let me talk about a which I talk about here. How about this. How about how great fucking Grand Rapids is and it's one of my favorite cities. I was there with Dean Del Rey and he was fucking murdering all week and yet he had a bunch of fans came out to people flying in to see him and then he went on to Detroit to go play some rock club like after after our show Saturday night. But there was this place a course post forget the fucking name of it but they had all these old video games in there. The fuck was it called. And why is my stomach still growling.

Speaker 11:         00:08:07       I had a bowl of cereal trying to starve myself before the fucking acting gig. Oh by the way thank you for all your guys suggestions sack slash criticism of my my dating or whatever guy goes Dude you can't say you're crushing it.

Speaker 12:         00:08:23       You know you crushed it. If at night you still haven't a drink or two.

Speaker 5:          00:08:26       It's like you fucking think I don't realize that Mom. Yes I realize that but anyways what was it called Stella's is some shit I can't fucking remember but we went down there and they evidently they had a great burger which I didn't have. Went to this healthy place and got this fuckin rap. Right in a water water and then we went over there because they had all these pinball machines and shit.

Speaker 6:          00:08:56       Me and Deena fuckin all shit and we walked in there.

Speaker 17:         00:08:58       They only had one pinball machine but they had all these great old video games and we showed up right and we sounded like two fucking kids.

Speaker 12:         00:09:09       D just goes. They got asteroids.

Speaker 15:         00:09:12       That we blew out and bugs play in that I've never been one of those guys.

Speaker 12:         00:09:19       Never been a video game guy. Just haven't been because they're so fucking awesome. They were like addicting but that is something. Remember back in the day when you would watch MTV Cribs and then like these fucking people would have these video games in their in their houses. And I saw a sink like I always feel like you buy those and then you never fucking use them like you use it for like the first day and then it's just like oh wait I gotta go to work you know I have to work so I can pay for this big giant stupid machine that I could've just pumped a couple of quarters into and let somebody else own and deal with the fucking maintenance. How if I was ever gonna buy one it would be asteroids and my number two is a game that not a lot of people know about.

Speaker 12:         00:10:00       And I think for the most part they've all disappeared. It was a fucking great game at least. I loved that it was called elevators and it was basically. I vaguely remember it. It was like Spy Versus Spy kind of thing you were dressed in white and all the bad guys were dressed in black almost kind of looking dark dressed like despite a spy from Mad magazine and you had to so you get in an elevator and on each floor there were these bad guys and as you passed the floor they'd be shooting at you from the right or towards from the left and you had to get all the way up to the top of the building and get something and then come back down again. And the worst was when you were going back down again and you'd be shooting at the guy and the guy would duck and lay down on the floor and as you went by when you couldn't raise your gun up and it was just your head at floor level he blow your fuckin brains out.

Speaker 13:         00:10:53       I used to play that one I buy either one of those I guess. No I wouldn't I wouldn't fucking waste of money but I'll go out we had a great time and I got a killer picture of Dean and his total fucking rock star pose playing the game and I think he already tweeted it out.

Speaker 18:         00:11:09       So if you look at Dean Del Ray's Twitter thing you can find that shit. So we did that and I want to thank people that Dr. grins comedy club I went down there and did a quick spot you know went up did some jokes or whatever.

Speaker 19:         00:11:27       And it was funny when Dean was up there he fuckin started trashing this woman who's sitting in the front row because she wouldn't shut up and I said to the other comics got they're gone. I like one of those deals as a comedian you'll be onstage and someone's talking and commenting on your jokes and then you don't realize most the crowd can't hear it. So if kind of supposed to ignore it I guess even though it's driving you nuts so he just fucking snaps and trashes her. And I would sit in the back of the club I said to the other comedians it's like you know it's funny we could even hear what she said. You probably should've just kept going I go I've made that mistake twenty thousand fucking times.

Speaker 13:         00:12:02       Then I went up next and I did the exact same thing exact same thing and I fucking trashed her and then she got mad you know said she was offended by for some fucking joke I did about the troops or some shit like that said no it isn't. No it isn't I know when you got offended you fucking ego maniac but I looked and I said something to the effect of Why would you think that you have anything interesting to say. Was one of those lines which was just really. You know now that I've said it out loud and I've kind of gotten out of the emotion it was I was really mean I went mean that's what I did.

Speaker 1:          00:12:32       I went fuck in me so many ways. Oh by the way somebody tried to scam me.

Speaker 20:         00:12:41       They tried to scam all Frankel who you think are dealing with here are some fucking rap bald Ralph Mal fucking motherfucker what you are. That doesn't mean you can scam me though they almost did.

Speaker 6:          00:12:55       If I wasn't so fuckin paranoid I'm hanging in the hotel and I get this phone call and I pick it up and it's just this computer going out that saying that they were calling from Apple and that there was a problem with my cloud and somebody might be breaking into it.

Speaker 1:          00:13:09       They go you know call this number blah blah blah blah blah and I'm like Oh you gotta be fucking kidding me so I stole it and they say that number twice I can't remember it. So I just start taking a guess and I punched in like out of the you know 10 numbers you know 1 8 8 8 whatever I got about 6 in and immediately starts dialing and I somehow get connected now right there. That should have tipped me off that these people are just fish and looking for somebody to react to it. So I dialed like six other fucking 10 digits I needed.

Speaker 21:         00:13:41       And then this guy's I low but the Bubba and I was like Yeah.

Speaker 5:          00:13:45       You guys just call it what is this referring to is like you fucking called me spy my soundcloud or whatever and they go oh yes yes you have a security problem. But I go well whose fucking fault is that. I go Why did you guys set up the cloud if it wasn't going to be like safe. Now you've exposed me all this shit because what I fuckin. Because I downloaded the Royal Blood fucking album now all of a sudden some is gonna drain my bank account you computer cunts I wasn't cursed but I was flipping out. And then he goes so sir we can help you we can help you over the phone we just need to access your computer. I go You mean access my computer and the guy just started talking to. I go I go I don't do that over the phone he goes Sir this is a very.

Speaker 5:          00:14:32       So this is a secure fucker blah blah blah. I go well how to. How do I know I could because you say so. Basically I wouldn't fucking do it. Just because I was looking at I was looking at them like they were legit but I was just like well you already got hacked why the fuck would I go with you again. Why don't I just go to the store. So little he got to the point he goes Sir this is this is a secure but bubba bubba bar. I just kept going like Well I don't even know who you are. You just for I know you're one of the guys fucking trying to hack into my computer dude.

Speaker 1:          00:15:05       I literally felt like I was in the Bourne Identity. You know when you don't know who to trust you don't you just fucking yelling at the other guy go you put your gun down.

Speaker 22:         00:15:13       You put your gun down first right.

Speaker 1:          00:15:17       So finally he gives up on me and he goes So here's your case number and you know I'll fucking you know. He said some dumb shit you've been to Turkey or Jordan recently it's like No no I saw the 30 for 30 UNled bias when he fucking went one on one against Michael Jordan.

Speaker 18:         00:15:33       Do you call in Michigan you fucking asshole.

Speaker 13:         00:15:37       So anyways he ends up transferring me and it just fucking hangs up and then I'm like flipping the fuck out. So I called the guy produces my fucking show and he just goes why he goes yeah. Apple doesn't call anybody. He goes now man that's just bullshit. So thank God I'm a paranoid Jackass or I might let something happen there so I'm just putting that out there like you know I'm sure all you young guys know what it is and you feel so smart and you're gonna shake your head and laugh your ass off at me on Twitter.

Speaker 23:         00:16:05       Going like you fucking know do you know like it's 2017. I learned that back in 2010 did you.

Speaker 1:          00:16:15       What else did you learn how not to play a guitar and then still call yourself a musician. Oh Bill Bill. Come along let's not be the old guy here huh.

Speaker 13:         00:16:24       I gotta be honest with you Del Ray played me some of that Skrillex guy stuff and I fuckin really liked it. I thought it was way different than anybody else and that's what I'm learning. Whenever something new comes out as much as your old ears listen to it and say what the fuck is that.

Speaker 1:          00:16:39       You just have to know that there's going to be the fucking Jimi Hendrix The Richard Pryor the Tom Brady the James Brown the fucking would is gonna be you gotta find out who that person is of the thing that you're listening to and then you can judge it OK it goes but I swear to God it goes right back to New York pizza all these fucking dopes get off the fuckin plane. The first place that's his famous New York pizza they eat it and then they go. This pizza sucks here.

Speaker 17:         00:17:08       It's like now you did you didn't go to the right place OK.

Speaker 1:          00:17:12       He didn't go the right place and deejays are like New York's pizza in that fucking everybody thinks they can do it you know and everybody's claiming that they're the real fucking deal and everybody's saying they're famous everybody's famous Ray the fucking deejay and I actually I really liked to shit.

Speaker 24:         00:17:31       I was like you know and I could actually fucking get the car and drive. Listen to this shit especially at night like this great like drive and songs like the whoo eminence front. Do you ever wanna when a bunch of fuckin money playing poker. That's it. Just get your money leave. Get

Speaker 19:         00:17:49       in your car buy yourself the fuckin window down and you listen to that song as you drive out to the desert and tell scream what the top five moments of your life.

Speaker 18:         00:18:03       Oh fuck you I'm old anyways what else.

Speaker 9:          00:18:10       When I saw I want to.

Speaker 7:          00:18:11       Oh did you guys watch all the Mayweather McGregor pressers as they call them overseas the press conferences. It's kind of the same thing over and over again with Conor McGregor he just kept going like What the fuck what the fuck is wrong with you. He's got on a contract suit.

Speaker 11:         00:18:34       That form VOLTRON thing was dumb and I loved when he trashed him on that but I will tell you this. Watching all of those people showing up for a fucking press conference they sold out the Barclays Center they sold out were like the Maple Leafs play I believe in Toronto. The Staples Center people showing up to watch a fucking press conference. I can tell you this cynical Bill's going to ruin the pay per view for you.

Speaker 1:          00:18:57       Those press conferences are gonna be better than the fight. You know and the fucking people that are gonna order that goddamn fight are the same fucking people that slow down on the highway to watch somebody change of fuckin tire day.

Speaker 2:          00:19:12       It's like it's just beyond it's beyond a spectacle.

Speaker 25:         00:19:16       I mean people go like you know I know it's a spectacle but you know it didn't just a word to fucking work. Yeah I know getting fucked in the ass but I want to see what it feels like.

Speaker 2:          00:19:28       Though that pay per view can go fuck itself. Do they ride in on the same plane over the fucking London.

Speaker 11:         00:19:38       Get the fuck out of here and all this shit McGregor gives Mayweather. There's one topic he completely avoids because it would fuck with ticket sales which kind of makes him part of the fucking bullshit of that whole thing.

Speaker 7:          00:19:51       You know what I mean it's just get the fuck out. I dunno I forget that I've given that guy enough fucking goddamn money given him enough fucking money. I've gotten fucked enough I've got fucked enough by that guy way like it's professional boxers can't lay a fucking hand on him and I'm fucking not enough. By the eighth round as he'd poo poo poo poo point him to fucking death now he's going to fight a guy who's not even a bot who used to box.

Speaker 1:          00:20:15       I love they used to box. Yeah there's a lot of people used to do stand up. You want to see them do an HBO special. Here's the bottom line if they ever met each other in a bar and started swinging McGregor would fucking kill him he'd take him to the ground and then the Mayweather would know what to do.

Speaker 10:         00:20:32       So they've eliminated all of that we know Bill you've said that so I don't know. Anyways. Maybe McGregor's I mean Mayweather is ego maybe tries to knock him out. I'm just not I'm not going to fucking watch it. I'm really not. I think what I'm gonna do is I'm going to get out on the highway when the fuckin fight is on and just cruise down the highway doing 90 miles an hour just looking around going like this is what it should be like. Like if I was running shit this would be the level of people that were in the world. I was joking on my own this weekend in Grand Rapids saying you know what I would do if I was running shit on the night of the Mayweather McGregor fight I would turn all the buffalo wild wings into gas chambers.

Speaker 8:          00:21:15       All those fuckin mouth breathing morons that were jerseys you know with other men's names on the back all day all day.

Speaker 26:         00:21:24       So I call it.

Speaker 1:          00:21:25       All of those guys just just gone all of them gone and you'd watch I bet I bet the mean the level of meanness on on on the Internet would go down.

Speaker 11:         00:21:38       You know these five by the way these fucking people now who just sit there and they watch CNN or Fox all day long and then they show up to you and they just start vomiting out all this fucking fearful shit that they just watched.

Speaker 2:          00:21:52       And then after they do that and get you all stirred up they don't even have the decency to offer a fucking solution.

Speaker 10:         00:22:01       All these fucking morons it's just like why would you sit there and watch Fox News all day. That's all you're gonna do. Watch a little CNN balance out you fucking lies keep yourself level fucking what's his face.

Speaker 4:          00:22:14       My buddy was telling me this weekend you know it's going global warming is going to get so hot you know they're saying they're not gonna be able to fly planes onto LaGuardia and I'm not I mean I'm thinking like how the fuck am I going to be a comedian anyway. And then that was it. He didn't offer any fuckin solutions. He just let me know. Like in the future you know we will do your job. Then I'm starting to fucking think about you know me my family living out in the street all I want to do is just say he's going to play the last rites.

Speaker 7:          00:22:42       You know if you don't have a fuckin solution don't bring up the goddamn problem okay. Like I brought the economy Gregor Mayweather. All right. I said it's a fuckin problem. I gave you your solution. You drive on a highway 90 miles an hour and you turn the Buffalo Wild Wings into a gas chamber. See that.

Speaker 10:         00:23:31       It takes up to being it being a dad is this shit. It really is. I fucking love it. You know it's the best thing about it is watching kids shows. I don't know that I'm a fucking moron or whatever but I am legitimately entertained. We started watching cars this morning. It's tremendous. I mean you know it is I watch cartoons it's so fucking long. It's like the level of animation on those things is crazy. Like I think I saw one of those toy stories one or two of them. But you know when you when you don't have a kid it's like you know why would you go see one of those lets you smoke weed like hey man let's get high and go see fucking toys.

Speaker 16:         00:24:11       All right.

Speaker 11:         00:24:13       Or you know you're dating a woman they always like seeing those they're cute. I like to make foods and you end up go in there and you just sit in there. I just fucking I remember I saw one of those toy stories like they were going down something and they were all this conveyor belt they went into a pit of flames and the level of fucking anxiety that it brought me I got like angry at the movie like this is a fucking kid's movie I shouldn't be feeling this way why do I care so much about these goddamn toys. Which is one of the reasons why I don't watch movies because I I take the fucking ride.

Speaker 6:          00:24:46       When people watch scary movies they go to that movie and scare me. They all scare the fuck out of me because I just I I take the fucking ride.

Lewis Hamilton closing the gap only down by one point.

Speaker 5:          00:34:40       Catching up on Sebastian Vettel. What happened to the Ferrari's out there in fucking great Britain.

Speaker 20:         00:34:49       What was it Kimi raking in whatever his fucking name is. He's driving.

Speaker 11:         00:34:53       He's in third place He's loving life for second place whatever he was in his front tire fuckin blows out with like fucking four or five laps to go and then he fucking gets on the radio the Townsville like over the baby when he goes for the fucking front tire.

Speaker 1:          00:35:08       All right so he's got to go in Vettel moves up he's going to be on the podium as much as fuckin Lewis Hamilton is going to pick up twenty five points he's gonna pick up at least fuckin 15 if not 18. All right. Who knows. You know and all of a sudden fucking two laps to go his fucking tire goes up front left one right and then all the towns you like me all right fuckin vandals all got damn pissed.

Speaker 13:         00:35:33       I think I have a I think I know who my favorite fuckin driver is though I like that. How have you seen its first name Black Belt. Val Terry Botha's that guy that guy can fucking drive he went from ninth place all the way to second place. I know I've talked about Lewis Hamilton and these guys going from fucking you know night to like what's his face yesterday the Australian fucker do they're the happiest guy in fucking Formula One. Jesus Christ babe I swear to God if another fucking names in front of me know what is that reckoning.

Speaker 30:         00:36:05       There's too many hours there's too many fucking like crazy fuckin. The nerve of these people to be put from other cultures. It was a day is it Dave. Dave. Fucking Jesus.

Speaker 1:          00:36:18       I only met the fucking guy. I've only been rooting for him. Daniel Ricardo. There we go. The fuck would pop back into my head as much as those guys have gone from like 19th to fucking you know 7th grade the 15th to whatever it is. I think it's harder to go from 9th all the way up to 2nd because you get into like the best of the best drivers to fucking go past driver number five four three to get all the way up to that start where as far back as he did with the Mercedes.

Speaker 11:         00:36:46       Once again having a gearbox issue that's what happens with Mercedes stay forever gearbox issue and they get a five spot fucking penalty and evidently I don't know who the fuck it is that's supposed to be working on that fucking shock absorber on the front left hand side of the car or the fin or the fucking tire whatever the fuck it is one of those guys wearing the underarms with the helmet on in the pit. Somebody back there is getting a fucking is get no pastor this week on the Ferrari team.

Speaker 17:         00:37:14       So what's his face. Vettel was up by like I don't know how many fuckin points I forget what place he came in I think he got like six or eight points and he was up by like he was up by 20 points before the race started.

Speaker 18:         00:37:30       I can do the math here and by the end of the race he was only up by 1 so like a fucking math test. So Lewis Hamilton got twenty five points so he outscored in by fucking twenty four.

Speaker 13:         00:37:43       So he come in tenth place he got one point now they'll be twenty four he got four points all right so he came in he came in like eighth right and he came in eighth All right whatever but why the fuck would you care so they got one more race before they take the break in the summertime like they would like their lives aren't fucking great enough they're part of like like literally 20 people who could do this in the fucking universe all right they get to take the fucking summer off. I'm like these poor bastards I played fuckin baseball who's going to pay like fuckin six to seven games a goddamn week. You know.

Speaker 18:         00:38:20       These guys get to take the summer off. Granted they have to still diet you know.

Speaker 13:         00:38:26       But you know if they have like a shake then they can they can fucking get rid of it bang bangin a supermodel you know fuck sweat it out of them. I mean their lives are unbelievable.

Speaker 18:         00:38:35       Lewis Hamilton and fucking what's his face. Both

Speaker 1:          00:38:38       times they both live in Monaco. It's like it's not enough to get you know he's got a private jet like these fucking guys lives are unbelievable. It's fucking tremendous. God bless him.

Speaker 11:         00:38:49       Hey what's going on with the fucking the other Red Bull team that's not Red Bull the blue ones the fuckin with the hell and what the weather is that the Totoro Rosa fucking team whatever the fuck they're called. Jesus Christ. They were doing their impression of the Force India team fucking slamming into each other. I love when that happens. I love that.

Speaker 31:         00:39:10       Reminds me that fuckin movie stepbrothers they do doing like the Formula One version of putting their balls on Will Ferrell's drum kit. No he put it on the other guy's drum kit. That's right. I don't know. Anyways let's get to the fucking question this week. Oh by the way all things comedy's own Irish affairs new double Netflix special airs Tuesday July 18th.

Speaker 18:         00:39:38       Both double negative.

Speaker 1:          00:39:40       Both are both double negative children and double negative. Adulthood will be available in 190 countries.

Speaker 13:         00:39:49       It's incredible how the reach the sheer reach of Netflix. All right feminism everybody. Let's do some fucking reads here for the goddamn week shall we. I got 20 minutes left here in this fucking podcast.

Speaker 17:         00:40:03       All right feminism Bill.

Speaker 1:          00:40:05       On a recent podcast when discussing stewardesses and air travel you mentioned that you sometimes thing the image they think feminism is a way for ugly women to get jobs that attractive women used to have. I said that. Why do you guys take anything I say seriously. You understand. I'm just riffing for a fucking hour and I'm trying to make you laugh by saying ridiculously over-the-top things. So he's gonna write me in a few weeks. Hey Bill a few weeks ago on your podcast you suggested turning Buffalo Wild Wings into gas chambers on the night of the Mayweather McGregor fight just to let you know I am a parent. I am not a fight fan but I do enjoy the fucking Halo Pino balls whatever the fuck they're called at Buffalo Wild Wings and what if I was there anyways.

Speaker 1:          00:40:57       I wonder if you knew Ivan Emily I said that feminism is a way for ugly women to get jobs that attractive women used to have. That's fucking hilarious. I don't necessarily believe that but there is an element of truth to that. Like you know when they are always bitching like you know Hollywood creates this impossible image of beauty. It's like no you can't you can't. Your fear of fucking ego maniac. I don't think when I look at a Brad Pitt whoever the fucking guy is now Brad Pitt's like in his 50s now. So we have the fucking shredded. Who's the guy from Saved By The Bell. Mario Lopez. You know when I don't when I look at him with his pigment and his fucking abs and all that. I don't fucking go like this is an impossible fucking town. Jesus. This is an impossible standard for me to talk standard for me to hold up to and therefore Mario Lopez should be on fucking TV anymore.

Speaker 2:          00:41:51       I just understand that. Yeah. You know what on a good day maybe I'm a 6. Okay. That's what I am. Not everybody can bat cleanup in the order. Okay if you're fucking bad Nate quit your crying and get on base. That's it.

Speaker 16:         00:42:07       Maybe I do believe that on some level. Anyways I wonder if you know that this is actually Rush Limbaugh's undeniable truth of life. Number 24 specifically that feminism was established so as to allow unattractive women to access access to the mainstream of society.

Speaker 15:         00:42:28       Here's the thing I'd say in this shit I'm like 90 percent joking.

Speaker 1:          00:42:33       There's always like an element of truth that guy as far as I can tell because I don't know what his act is. It might all just be an act you know so he can eat because he is in show business. So I have no idea it could just be an act but if you actually truly believe that I don't listen I don't believe that.

Speaker 17:         00:42:49       OK. Feminism came about because men were not allowing women to pursue their dreams.

Speaker 2:          00:42:57       OK but like any cause any cause for whatever reason along the way a lot of the times you end up becoming what the fuck you were fighting. OK. And that's not this unique thought. I realize that's a hacky thought but it's fucking true. The level of bullying that goes on on the internet and trying to get people to get fired and trying to create firestorms and trying to trying to show the power of women by a lot of times attacking people who you're deliberately and knowingly taking what they said out of context and causing them to not have a fucking job is fucking reprehensible. All right. And they in a lot of ways do the same reptilian. If the ends justify the means corporate fucking mentality just some of this shit that that is set out there. Yeah. Look I don't think that it's actually that but sometimes I think it's that you know there are jobs that you should only get if you're good looking. You know I really believe that like like when you get you know the first person that they're going to fucking walk in the top of your order you got to go with Ricky Henderson. You know you gotta get somebody who's gonna get on base.

Speaker 32:         00:44:16       You gotta put the fucking picture up.

Speaker 4:          00:44:20       You know and I feel like I can say this because of how I look like if I ran a company. I'm not putting me on the front desk like I'm the first person you're gonna say. Why would you do that. We're trying to make money here. You know I know that high schools over look in the mirror. Love yourself but have a sense of humor about yourself. Know that you're not perfect and just know that it's OK. And you know what a lot of times if you stare into that shit and you have a sense of humor about yourself you're fun to be around.

Speaker 30:         00:44:54       How many times I call myself a pasty bald freckled fucking jackass telling me you fucking stare into it and you fucking age gracefully. All right you start to lose your fucking here. You just shave your fucking head. Just be that guy and everybody's like what the fuck and then. But you know what. You deal with it.

Speaker 4:          00:45:12       Then people thought they respect you. This guy came down the pike he didn't even try to shake it off he took the pitch right to the side and had everybody stand it on first base. Good for you you ugly bald son of a bitch right. This is the thing.

Speaker 11:         00:45:25       So I know that they need ugly bald son of a bitch as in movies and I'll just audition for that at the end of the fucking day I'm in a movie. Am I really gonna complain. You know I feel fucking.

Speaker 1:          00:45:39       Fucking bald freckled redhead should be starring in more movies it's like oh yeah you want to put your money put your money where your mouth is. You go finance that fuckin movie yeah. And a lot of ways. That's one of those things which everybody should get like a ribbon.

Speaker 16:         00:45:56       I mean I don't know what the solution is but you like competition is a good thing.

Speaker 32:         00:46:02       Okay. And the best you know the best should should win right.

Speaker 5:          00:46:11       Mike I'm I'm all with it as far as everybody should have the same opportunity. But after that go fuck yourself. Whoever's the best gets it.

Speaker 1:          00:46:20       You know. Now like well we have enough of these people are enough of those now who are the fucking best. Okay. When we have to keep doing that because at some point if the aliens aren't already here they're coming here and we need to have an all star fucking team not a team that makes everybody feel represented. All right. There we go. I hope I explained myself or you know I'll I'll know if I'm right if I don't get a call from the Rush Limbaugh Show asking me if I want to be a guest.

Speaker 2:          00:46:47       All right brother X feminine.

He doesn't have many guy friends and he hangs out with a lot of ladies second. I do. I try to do masculine things with them I play baseball so I always ask him to play catch with me and I even offered to teach him how to place the sport. He usually says no when I try to do any sort of physical activity with him. He rejects my requests and just does his own thing. Third his body language is quite feminine. He sits like a girl talks like a girl and moves his hands like a girl. You know what I'm saying.

Speaker 2:          00:47:54       And the thing that ladies and gay guys do with their hands.

Speaker 16:         00:47:59       You know I'm saying the thing that ladies and gay guys do with their hands when they talk. My gut tells me to sit down and have a talk with him but I don't want to come off too blunt and hurt his feelings. Then again that could be what he needs. I think if I tell him what I'm thinking he'll just blow it off just like me. He's very hotheaded. Sorry about the hyphen. I personally blame his behavior on the pacification of society over the past few years and the very progressive environment of modern day schooling. He's a good kid and he's got a good head on his shoulders so I'm not worried about anything else. I'm just looking out for him. I don't want to dickheads messing with him. I used to get bullied so I know how it feels. What do you think's. Thanks for your help. Go fuck yourself. All right. I think you're 17 and I think you love your brother and you're trying to protect him.

Speaker 33:         00:48:52       Here's the deal dude.

Speaker 17:         00:48:56       I mean your brother is who your brother is. You got to accept that. And I don't know how you handle the bullying thing which is what I really think is what you see when you look at your brothers like this kid's gonna get the shit kicked out of them. Which is you know sad to say. You know hopefully not as much as when I was coming up. But yeah that is it. That is it's a legit concern.

Speaker 34:         00:49:29       But I don't think you listen people are born how they're born.

Speaker 17:         00:49:36       OK. I don't know if this kid's gay or not. I don't know what. But if he does want to play catch he doesn't want to play catch. And if he's hardheaded you know e sound.

Speaker 35:         00:49:44       He said he's a smart kid he's hot headed he knows what he wants. So just let him be himself. And you support him and there's no reason why this kid he doesn't like to do physical shit. I wouldn't say take him down to a dojo. Teach him how to fuck somebody up. And the fact that he is effeminate. If he goes and fucks somebody up that's going to be humiliating for the other person and then nobody else is going to want to fuck with them because they want to get beat up by Bruce Lee used to do that Bruce Lee used. I read this book used to walk around he would act all effeminate and then these guys would come up and fuck with him and then he would kick the shit out of him. People ask him well why would you do that he said well if I just walked up. Like a regular dude you know they got their ass kicked they could get over it but if they thought they got their ass kicked by a sissy you know it stays with them.

Speaker 11:         00:50:29       And unfortunately that is something with guys if you know if people were more progressive or whatever the fucking word is they wouldn't think that and they'd just be like well it doesn't make a difference if you're effeminate or masculine if he can fucking throw hands over there with a couple of feces.

Speaker 18:         00:50:46       I can I can accept the loss.

Speaker 35:         00:50:51       I listen I would just if anything I would try to have a closer relationship with my younger brother and and I would ask him how his days are going and I would just really ask him Is anybody at school fucking with you or whatever. And if they are I don't know. I would go down and have a fucking talk I don't know if he could do that. I don't know what to do. I don't know what to do but that would do it.

Speaker 17:         00:51:13       As an older brother that would kill me knowing that somebody could be fucking with my younger brother. So I think you come from a good place. Your ideas of you know how to cure him of that are understandable because you're 17. I don't think it's society's fault. I just think that's just how he's born. And I think if you accept it he will accept it and he'll keep a good feeling about himself. But unfortunately the bullying is going to come and he's gonna have to learn how to stick up for himself. I mean that's just the truth of it.

Speaker 31:         00:51:46       And there's all kinds of things that you could do that I'm not allowed to say on the podcast. As far as what he could do in those moments because somehow I become this fucking bad person.

Speaker 34:         00:52:00       But I'm just going to tell a random story here.

Speaker 31:         00:52:05       I remember the late Charlie Murphy rest his soul. He told me to do what to do if you ever go to jail. And I just.

Speaker 18:         00:52:13       It was like you know not that I could still survive. He was like Yo this is what you do.

Speaker 13:         00:52:21       He goes the first motherfucker that steps to you. He goes you just turn into a wild animal frothing at the mouth and you just fucking swing for the fences and everybody you know what I'm oversimplifying what the fuck he said.

Speaker 17:         00:52:35       And you know that's just a story he told me. That has nothing to do with what I just fuckin read. Okay I want to do that so I stay free and clear. I don't know what to tell you buddy. All right. Let him be who he is. And you know I would watch some MDMA events with them and maybe he'll want to learn how to fucking do it. I don't know. I don't know because I've watched some some cool videos of some kids that were way out of their own weight class. It's one fucking kid fucked his kid up jumped up put him in a fucking arm by this kid.

Speaker 36:         00:53:07       And what the fuck they do.

Speaker 35:         00:53:10       Maybe you can help him out with that but yeah I would let go of all that other shit that you're going to fucking do I mean if like you are being who you are. I mean if somebody when you go out in the driveway and it's to learn how to talk a little bit time you just would still be you but you'd know how to toilet baton. I don't think it would change how you walked or behaved or who you hung out with. You're wired how you wired. All right. Girlfriend wants to move back to her home. That's like those fucking people that you know that would try to cure gay people you know.

Speaker 11:         00:53:42       They think that they like it's like they have the mumps or something. Girlfriend wants to move back to her home country.

Speaker 37:         00:53:52       All right.

Speaker 1:          00:53:54       Hey Bill Hill. If the guy took the woman's last name in marriage. That's funny. All right. Longtime listener first time advice seeker I live in London. I met my girlfriend online a year and a half ago.

Speaker 16:         00:54:05       She's 25 and I'm 24. She's from Switzerland. See this what happens now to all these fucking dating apps. Fun fact about Switzerland. They have enough nuclear bunkers to accommodate their entire population. Yeah that's because they're so close to fucking Germany. They moved here a few years ago to get a music. She moved here a few years ago to get a music degree and graduated graduate. Last year she was going to move in with a friend a few months ago but her best friend did a 180 at the last second. So we decided to move in together as we enjoy each other's company. Here's the shit part. She always said that she misses her family and her friends a lot which is of course understandable but recently she's been mentioning that she wants to move back to Switzerland once our lease is up next year. I completely get why she would want to do this. She doesn't have many friends here. As many of her college friends have moved back home. The thing is I have established an established career here and I don't want to leave my friends a job behind to go move to a country where I don't speak the language.

Speaker 1:          00:55:09       I've tried but there are hardly any courses for Swiss slash German and the market for my skills is much smaller I'm a magician an academic tutor.

Speaker 24:         00:55:23       Jesus is a fucking combo.

Speaker 16:         00:55:25       Whenever she brings it up I answer with very variations of well we'll cross that bridge when we come to it but I'm pretty sure I'm never going to come around to the idea. She has made the point a couple of times that this would be me choosing my career and friends over her which makes it sound worse than it is. What should I tell her. Thanks and go fuck yourself while she's choosing her country and her family over you.

Speaker 24:         00:55:50       So I would say nicely listen. You keep saying that this is me choosing my career and you know what just when she's saying my friends over her.

Speaker 38:         00:56:04       Do you know that feeling you have when you live here in London. That's what I'm going to feel like when I'm in Switzerland. Do you want me to feel that. No. Well good. I don't want to feel that either. So one of us has to make a sacrifice here. Are you willing to live here.

Speaker 7:          00:56:22       And if she says no. Then you have to be willing to live there. And if you're not willing to do that then you guys need to break up.

Speaker 37:         00:56:28       It's simple as that simple as that.

Speaker 13:         00:56:36       I would I would fucking say Do you know you got a fucking goddamn kids today and fucking swipe and left the next scene.

Speaker 1:          00:56:46       Oh yeah. My girlfriend lives in fucking Bangladesh and she's really missing some of the food over there and I you know I fucking you know whatever the fuck I do over here.

Speaker 35:         00:56:55       I mean these are these are like modern day relationship fuckin problems. Yeah that's it. One of you guys has to move but don't let her guilt you. She's not choosing her friends you're doing what she's doing. You're living where you want to live next to the people you love and you can't get mad at her for wanting to do the exact same thing all right but you know she's trying to mind fuck you know for me I feel like you're choosing this go fuck yourself. All right well go back home and send me some chocolates will bang every once in a while we'll meet in Paris summit that. It that I want to tell you.

Speaker 1:          00:57:29       My girlfriend. You came to my place not the other way around. Girlfriends belly hangs past her tits. Jesus Hey there Bill. Hey there billy will you freckled cheeks.

Speaker 6:          00:57:42       Love the podcast especially when you and Nia do the podcast so that I know and I gotta get her on here more but it's just like when I do what she has to watch secured and the other way around. All right. I've got a problem then I'm hoping you and Neha may be able to help me with. I love my wife of seven years dearly. We have fun together. Make each other laugh etc.. She's my best friend.

Speaker 1:          00:58:00       We're in an early thirties have no children in our very affluent crushing it except for the sex. The sex is bad because we have become fatty fat Fats. We've been together for a decade and this has only become a problem over the past six months. I'm 5 11 and to 40 with a lot of muscle and a lot of fat. She's five four and two hundred and has no muscle mass. I'm ashamed to say that even though I love her fiercely she's no longer physically attractive to me. Why me. What the fuck.

Speaker 16:         00:58:30       I'm just being honest. I'm sure you're not as attracted to her although you did give yourself some props for having a little bit of muscle you didn't quite say you was as big a mess. I'm ashamed to say that. Okay. She probably feels the same. He said that she feels the same. She used to be 140 tops and was curvy in all the right places. I used to be cut like a Greek god our sex life was amazing.

Speaker 39:         00:58:52       She'd have one to three orgasms. Jesus Christ every time we had sex one two three times four weeks and now maybe we have sex once a month. She can't climax anymore because she gets too tired. Jesus over the past six weeks I've cut 10 pounds and exercise six times a week. I'm trying but I have a long way to go. She isn't trying to eat right and is not interested in exercising with me.

Speaker 16:         00:59:13       I know sex tends to dwindle over time but I'd like for us to be in good enough shape that we don't need a nitroglycerin pill every time we try to do the dirt. Any advice would be much appreciated. Thanks and go fuck yourself. You have to sit down and have an honest conversation with her.

Speaker 39:         00:59:29       OK I would leave the sex life out of it. It's just like she's not going to live long.

Speaker 1:          00:59:35       All right it five for two hundred pounds maybe you can start by going for quote romantic walks and you hold her hand and need you try to pick up the pace and drag along.

Speaker 18:         00:59:49       I would just yeah I would talk to her about it. And if she chooses not to get in shape then I I would not alter what you're doing.

Speaker 35:         01:00:01       I would go back to being the Greek god that you were and if she doesn't want to get in shape then you know what are you supposed to do.

Speaker 16:         01:00:11       Watch her eat herself into an early fuckin grave. You supposed to be with somebody that you're not sexually attracted to anymore. I mean that that's fair man. If somebody puts on almost like.

Speaker 18:         01:00:22       She put on almost half her body weight I mean that's not that's not fair.

Speaker 1:          01:00:27       It's not fair to yourself and it's not fair to the person you're in. You've got to be making an effort to to still look good. You know and people have a tendency men and women to do that to become you know you know just walking around fucking shitty looking clothes just being a tub of shit and it's just like that whole you should accept me for whatever I am that means I'm going to be the least of who I could be. Nobody ever says that when they're the best. Yeah. I'd like to accept you. Fucking going to the goddamn gym the same way you'd like me to not fucking have my belly hanging down past my junk.

Speaker 17:         01:01:00       Yeah I'd have a conversation with her. Just sit down.

Speaker 9:          01:01:04       You know what maybe. My beautiful daughter is asleep. Maybe you could come in and help. Hang on a second me a pause here. She can't do it. She can't do it. Sorry.

Speaker 24:         01:01:15       Sorry to get your goddamn hopes up so just know that that you just got advice from a guy.

Speaker 18:         01:01:22       So what I would do is I would ask a woman in your life not her advice on how to how to drop in okay.

Speaker 1:          01:01:30       Cause this is one of these relationship conversations. It's like when a spaceship is re-entering the atmosphere the space shuttle that if it wasn't at the right fuckin angle you know where you lost a couple of those fucking shingles on the bottom you could fucking burn up on reentry. All right that I really have to bring up that tragedy to make my point. I don't know. Maybe I didn't. All right. Girlfriend has severe halitosis. Jesus Christ the women are getting destroyed. Ladies ladies you gotta write in next week okay. You got to write it next week. OK stop being sweethearts and tell me what the problem is with the guys this is this is not fair and balanced like Fox News.

Speaker 15:         01:02:09       Or CNN.

Speaker 11:         01:02:13       I love that chick that cried on CNN the one with the Mary Lou Retton haircut when Trump got elected it's just like there was one of those unprofessional journalistic moments I've ever seen in my fucking life. How did we go from Walter Cronkite to that. I literally know who you voted for. You're not a journalist all right. Hey there op ed piece. All right. Girlfriend has severe halitosis. Dear Billy Batts I saw you perform and hilarity is in the land.

Speaker 5:          01:02:36       The worst fucking nickname the land the land of what Jesus Christ that's so fucking bad and you had me in stitches.

Speaker 1:          01:02:46       Please come back the land their T-shirts back there defend the land do you know for half a second in Boston they split they lose. People call it the bean. Don't do that Beantown was bad enough. We don't make beans there anymore anymore than Port Chester still makes fucking lifesavers. Although Grand Rapids still makes furniture anyways. I'm 23 year old man and recently began dating a girl I met on a dating app. We've been on two dates and she has bad breath dumper. Jesus Christ over.

Speaker 5:          01:03:24       The fuck do you care. It's not your problem. Anyways you've been on two dates so far and they both went great. We went. To a couple of museums for how far away we are standard from were you standing there going in.

Speaker 11:         01:03:36       Is that her breadth of the artifacts. Is that her breath of that fucking woolly mammoth statue that they dug out of the fucking ice two thousand years ago and it was actually woolly mammoth from fucking 4 billion B.C. go fuck yourself. Right. We have a good conversation in this great chemistry overall but when she smiles the sight and smell indicates years of not brushing or flossing.

Speaker 5:          01:04:02       Dude I don't see any you know the fact that you need advice on this.

Speaker 1:          01:04:06       There is thick dark yellow build up along our gum line. Oh my God I'm gonna puke. And she talks loud so her breath travels a long way. Kissing is difficult to enjoy.

Speaker 40:         01:04:20       Oh my God this is gross.

Speaker 41:         01:04:25       I almost just gag order.

Speaker 20:         01:04:29       I always just gag there. What kind of fucking low self-esteem do you have. What is my advice. Either break up with her or take her to one of those self power washes car wash things and tell her to smile and fucking blaster right in the fucking grill. Jesus fucking Christ. That's the most disgusting visual.

Speaker 18:         01:04:51       Oh my God.

Speaker 42:         01:04:55       What the fuck.
