Speaker 1:          00:00:01       Hey, what's going on is bill burr and it is the Monday morning podcast. Uh, I dunno when I think this is going to be a special episode or maybe it's for Monday. What would that be? The 19th, I don't know what, I'm a little out of sorts because I've got to do a bunch of traveling this week. A flat in New York. Come back and then I'll let you bullshit. So, uh, anyways, we have a special guest every once in a while. I take a break from rambling to myself in my underwear there. I'm at my house and um, you know, drive my wife nuts. So a this week we actually have legendary drummer, musician, human being from a Stevie Ray Vaughan and double trouble. Please welcome Mr Chris Latent. What's going on, man? Hey Bill, just hanging out in la. I'm out here doing a project and um, uh, again, awesome, right?

Speaker 1:          00:00:52       But I don't know if you're going to be able to chew gum right up on the mic. That curse. It'll drive people, drive them nuts. Safe right there. I'm already making you uncomfortable. No, no, I'm good. I'm good. Up until that more than several times now. All right, well first of all, what brings you out right now? We are in our Los Angeles. What brings you out here? What are you working on? I'm doing a project called the rides and that's a band that we put together and we did a project to the same project about a year and a half ago. The rides is myself, Bass player, Kevin McCormick, Lisbeth CSN and Jackson Brown. And I'm very Goldberg, plays keys, keyboards. He was in the original electric flag. I don't even know that. Mike Bloomfield white back in the 60s. Um, and then there's Kenny Wayne Shepherd plays guitar and sings. I saw you guys at the Greek you did this summer.

Speaker 1:          00:01:38       Yeah. That's absolutely ripped. Yeah, he's ripping. Awesome. What's it like to, uh, Olin Stephens stills? He's in there too. It was the other, yeah, he's the last but not least. And that's the band and we're making a record and it, this is your second one or you're the first one? This is the second one. Yeah. Second one that you got done is called the rights. All right. D s right. Okay. Now what, what type of music are we looking at here? It's guitar driven. It's blues. It's, you know, it's original songs for the most part. How do you, how do you know why Steven Stills? Uh, well, I know him through Kenny because I worked with Kenny a lot and we go back many, many years. Um, personally, I know Steven is because of this. I was asked, they talked about it and asked me to join the whole idea.

Speaker 1:          00:02:25       What's that like? Just as, I don't know if I, I, if, you know, I played drums as a hobby and I'm horrific. So I always wondered like, I've always had unbelievable admiration for a true musicians. What is it that you do you get that failing? Like when you're sitting in the studio, you're counting off a song and you look on, over at the side of Stephen Stills head. Do you ever just think, how the hell did I get here? Well, yeah, I think that way about a lot of things. Um, because, you know, growing up I was a huge Stephen stills fan, Crosby, stills, Nash, and young and right. You know, Dallas Taylor, who was the drummer in the band way back when. I mean, these are the things we're replacing our, I've got my licks and I'll listen to guitar sounds and songs and song writing.

Speaker 1:          00:03:01       I was like, awesome. It's like legendary. Talk about legendary, you know, and then you're, and then I'm sitting there and I'm looking over there and he's counting off a song or having meat count off the som going, wait a minute, how did I get here? How do you stay calm in that moment? Because I would sit there and I would have like a resting face that you would know that I was freaking out. But inside of you, like, Oh, I can breathe deeply and slowly she wouldn't be here. Now it's all good. You know? I've had a long career, so I've worked long and hard to get your southern girl, you know, I deserve this, I deserve it as well. As much as I wouldn't deserve it, but I'm grateful that I've got it. That's awesome. You can feel that because I've never felt I deserve this.

Speaker 1:          00:03:43       I, unless it's something bad, like something comes back to bite me in the ass. I'm like, you know, I'm an asshole. But like, I don't think I've, I've, uh, I had a buddy of mine recently wanted to go out and go buy himself a nice car and I gave him a halftime speech to go out and do it because a, I'm trying to get my, I got that, that Catholic guilt thing where I can buy my wife anything. But uh, but uh, you know, if I was going to go by myself, by the way, you pulled up in there? Yeah. A Hemi, a Chrysler Hemi station wagon. Yeah. Which I, I've been trying to defend the station wagon to my listeners. Most of them, 90% of them are not having it. This is sports car bill. It's a sports car. It is. No, but I like, it's a sleeper.

Speaker 1:          00:04:25       No, it is my mom, my wife calls it to the thug car. She goes, he's going out in your thug car to dance. Like, you know, um, did you get the station wagon so you can throw your drums in the back and all that stuff? Yeah. You know what? Every car that I get somehow is motivated by that idea because you know, you know, I do all kinds of work, you know, but it all comes down to the very first work. I do this, can I get my drums in the car? Right. And you'd get them easily at a station wagon. Which shift? What's your, your first, uh, your first vehicle? You have a head. The first one that I bought, cause I know you're a big car guy, you got to look a Shelby Mustang and, and stuff like that coming to blow your mind.

Speaker 1:          00:05:01       It was a Datsun five 10 station wagon. Oh Jesus. It's before they were called Nissan over here. I remember that. Dotson Dotson five 10, you know, it was a guy who does drag races with one of those and he hits all electric of seeing that then. And he was saying like, it's a five, 10. I have seen that. Yeah, that's that one where they started to slope the back end and it's like they just said, fuck it. We don't have enough time. And they just sliced off the back is not how it looks. Well, it was a, it was a coupe or a a four door sedan is what it was. Oh No, no, five 10 what am I talking about? I love that the five 10 we can build this in the station wagon was in Tom p two 10 [inaudible]. Yeah, no, no, no, no, no. Sorry. My mistake. I'm still an acid. Going to be times I said that I loved that car and I can't and I'm so psyched that I'm actually sitting here talking to you like I'm freaking out a little bit. You had to five tenants. Such a bad ass car. Did you have the two door? The four door? Well, I had the station wagons. It was a four door. You had a four a station. Yeah. All I ever did was put the key in it and put gas in. I had the car for

Speaker 2:          00:05:57       like four years and it was, you know, it was when I moved to Austin from Corpus Christi, Texas. I just said, I'm out of here. And I went to Austin, I'll put all my stuff in that car and I took off. And um, how Lo, how old were you? I was, uh, just turned 19. So 19 years old. You gotta you gotta Datsun Five, 10, four door station where you live in Corpus Christi and you've been playing drums, parent's house and that type of stuff, listening to all these guys that you eventually would play with. Yes. And what happens you basically as a musician, because it fascinates me as a comedian. Like when I started out, um, you know, it was all about getting on at Nick's comedy stop and the Comedy Connection and Dick is comedy club and getting established there. And then that becomes that moment where you've done that and you dislike I now what?

Speaker 2:          00:06:41       Yeah. Now where do I go that that must happen? Music musically too. Yeah. You know, it was, I was in corpus and my father had died and I looked around and I've been to Austin to visit my sister who was a university of Texas three or four years earlier. And I woke up one day, I was in music school in Corpus and um, it's funny, I just saw whiplash and I had this drum instructor who I went in to take with him cause he's one of the best guys and rudimental middle playing. They said, you're holding you sticks wrong. I said, he said, I want you to hold them traditional, you know, military style setting. I don't do that anymore. He said, yeah, you're holding them wrong. It was a French match grew up. I said, well Billy Cobham holds his sticks like this. And I had been doing that right since I was a kid.

Speaker 2:          00:07:22       And just to let our listeners know, if he ever watch like a drummer play, he, does he pick them up the way you naturally would? Would she grab them both the same way and then as that other way where the left hand, if you're right handed drummer, it's sort of lane sideways across your hand. That's considered traditional. The other's called match, it's called mass group and there's very styles. But the thing was because of marching drums, you know, like in military operations, the other drum hung to hang hung to the side. So the stick hit perfect when you held to the left hand. Right. Cause the drum would hang to one side. So you hold that hand held the stick that way in the hand. That's, you know, on the side of the groom, I mean the other side. Okay. Anyway, so, and he says, I see.

Speaker 2:          00:07:59       So I don't care how Billy Cobham holds his drum sticks. He goes, you're not going to hold them that way. I said, hey, you know what, I'm done. And I got up and I walked out and I woke up. No, I'm, I'm, you know, I'm just sliding like whiplash. I'm just sitting there watching the goods. Like, Dude, you've got the talent. You don't need to sit here and get yelled at. I'm not saying it wasn't tremendous performance by the guy from the insurance commercials. What are they? I don't know what his name is, but he's awesome. He's awesome. Bump bump. But it also goes to show you, that's like that thing with acting that you what? Just UA handcuffed by the material. Like if this guy doesn't get that script, he just has to keep going. Like, uh, whatever the hell he says in those commercials.

Speaker 2:          00:08:34       No, no. So I get in my mock up the next day and I go, you know what, I'm Outta here. I'm going to Austin. And that place was awesome. One of those, did you, now did you say that to the teacher? Not as he's screaming at you, Michael Douglas and uh, no. Went back the next day and I went to all my teachers. I said, hey, I don't care what you're going to do with my grades. I'm Outta here. And they go, when you leave, and I go right now, leave the building. I got the car packed and I'm on my way. Do

Speaker 1:          00:08:56       whatever you want to have my grades or any of that stuff. I got to go now. What now will you always like that sort of strong person? Because I think if I was 19 years old and if some guy like the dude and whiplash said, you know, the holding your sticks wrong, I would be like, oh, okay. And then when as he yelled at me, I'd be like, you're right. I know I am. Well Shit, you said, we touched on this a minute ago when you said that, because when I said I deserve this, like, oh, did I say that? Because I've been trying to work over my Catholic guilt too, you know. Um, so I, you know, sometimes I go, I deserve way more than I got and I don't really deserve with anything that I even have that pendulum swings done. Swing is wide these days. So that's the good news.

Speaker 1:          00:09:36       But not always kind of been defiant in a contrarion and a bunch of other stuff with some good stuff. But um, no, that was easy because something told me you need to get outta here. There's something for you there that you're not gonna find. A lot of people feel that, but they don't act on it. Like I, I do both. Like I have times where I have this feeling, I'm just like, what, dude? Fuck you. I'm out of here. And then I have other times where that voice is screaming at me, waking me up at night. I'm grinding my teeth and I still like ignore it. Like I, I could not, I'm not, this year's the first year, um, this year we're three weeks into it. I mean, in the last year I've really started to listen to my gut and if I meet somebody and my, despite what they're doing and all their accolades and everything, if my gut has that feeling of like, do this, this isn't right, I, I've, I've walked away from it.

Speaker 1:          00:10:25       And two of the things that it really came back like, wow, man, I was, I was right on that one. So it took me almost 50 years to figure that out. But, uh, so I'm always like, uh, drawn to stories like that. So then you, you, you leave, you say fuck that these two, the whiplash guy. Yeah. So I got, you know, it's funny you said that because I mean kind of aren't we like that? I'll go the, the, the, the best thing that I can do is when I had that intuition that's attached to some kind of passion to actually listen to that as opposed to, God, I fucked that up. I better do something different. That's a big turning point. Right? And that's what happened. Right? Then I went, I don't know why I'm going there. All I know is that something tells me that I need to go there.

Speaker 1:          00:11:03       So it took the 200 bucks. I had my pocket for peace drum kit in about six changes of clothes and I just took off and drove there. So you drive and then you show up. I always try to encourage people who listened to this podcast to, you know, if it's not the wrong with being in a cubicle and doing that, but if you don't want to do it, you have this thing telling you to throw six shirts into a car and drive somewhere that you should do it. Um, so you, when you show up, you have no way to, and this is the big questions people always have when it comes to following a dream is like, then they're always like, and then what? And it's kind of like, what would you say? He just figure it out as you get there. Yeah. You know the thing that you have to keep working and you don't give up and you follow that intuition, you pass some common sense and pay attention to the things right in front of you. I go, you mostly think some work out? I mean, they work out one way or the other. So how long did you sleep in your car for? Well, I didn't this, see there were some guys

Speaker 2:          00:11:54       that had, that had a band up in Austin. They live in this little shack outside, a little town called Maine or Texas. It was fifth 14 miles outside Austin. They said they'd just come back a few weeks earlier. They get, yeah, we abandoned the place and they go, it's got the rest of the rent paid. I went, can I get the key to that joint? Okay. That's some of those deals where you go, Huh, I can maybe use that if you want to give it to me if it's rent's paid. So I went there and it was outside and I had nothing. I was sitting there going, get now what? You know firstly what the rent was paid for, how long? 14 days. That was paid for like another couple of weeks. And I had some guys who said, hey, why don't we go up there? Let's go up there. So the idea was that we were going to, we were going to have a balanced as it come on up there.

Speaker 2:          00:12:28       I'm going, let's go. We can have their old house and Blah. So we did that. Nobody had anything. And we kind of sat around and p jammed in the, in the, in the house, you know, we didn't really ever do anything except that. Meanwhile, when the guy went and got a job and another guy went and got a job and you know, I had the only car, I drove a guy to his job and he picked, he covered my rent the next month because we were out there for a couple of months. Right. Um, you know, the story could get really long. No, no, no. This is all fascinating. What, what kind of kid were you playing at that time? I had a Gretsch Kit. You did an a four piece Gretsch kit. What do you play now? You lead with gay? Well, I play Ludwig on a play fives.

Speaker 2:          00:13:03       I played both. I played both of them. Oh, okay. I was a Ludwig Guy. My very first kid I played was Ludwig, Ludwig and Zildjian, which was basically, that was the Cadillac of back then before all these, uh, for the Japanese companies. And uh, yeah. You know, I mean, Mitch Mitchell, I heard that and well, what's he doing? I, and I saw a picture, I'm like, yeah man, you know that's right. Because we was the top and over there. What was it? Premiered drums over in England. Premiere England. Yeah, he played those two books. Premiere. Right. You know, and then there was Yamaha and parole, all the work. And you know, we're around for a while, but when the like everything else they finally got here. Right. You know? So how long before you got into an actual situation after you moved to Austin that you were in a band, you guys were playing in the clubs, you could eat and a, you could make your rent.

Speaker 2:          00:13:49       That was two years later. Two years later now will you one of those guys we did you just like as far as like other musicians seeing you and being like, I want to play with this guy or that's the kind of guy because the drums or the foundation, did you have a style that that, did you have to go out and shake a bunch of hands? Are you one of those guys that sat down and play it and people just like that guy can play. Well, here's what happened. One of the guys that came back, it came up later, it can be in that band. And then immediately, you know, we know it didn't have a band, was a sax player. He lives here. Joe Sublett looser in La and he got a Gig with a, with a, with a band called Paul Ryan, the cobras. And there was another band called grease the wheels who were looking for a drummer and I didn't really have a Gig.

Speaker 2:          00:14:31       And he said, you ought to check out my roommate. He's really good. So I went and auditioned a much with a bunch of other guys and they said, you got the Gig. That's where I started making a steady paycheck paper on Friday. You know, right now because you needed that gig where you extra nervous. It's one of your first gigs. So, you know, I mean more, more nervous than I was just to begin with about live. But you know, I'm, the only thing was that one of those things, because you were always playing with other people that you, you didn't feel the nerves. You know what? Well not, I mean, I, I mean I'd still do now you're talking about looking over at Stephen stills aren't going like shit, you know, let me get the right field. This like, no, it's this way. It's every day.

Speaker 2:          00:15:07       And I was like a, you know, that's a daily thing. Like, you know, I look for something that helps call me, you know, it keeps me in the moment, you know? But you have those moments where you stepping out on stage Guy Shit, I hope I do good. You know, and I will do. I know I got it. I don't know. Maybe I can yeah. About whatever. We haven't gotten lost in a song. Hopefully like, no, I don't mean in a good way. Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. I do this show, I do this show. It's called the goddamn comedy jam. It's a really cool thing. It's funny you went romantic. Yes. All the time. No, it's true. I've met like, like, so what happens? Basically it, he knows a lot of comedians like myself that play instruments and you know, wish that they had your abilities on whatever instruments.

Speaker 2:          00:15:48       And uh, we ended up becoming comedians. So Scott [inaudible] and Myers, he has this comedy show where you go up, you do 10, 15 minutes and tell stories about going to conscious and then you go back, you jam with the band, either play guitar, you sing, he played drums. So I, uh, I've done it like three times, did it last night. And sometimes I find myself so listening to the bass player, so I stay on time. I forget, I'm not listening to the lyrics. And like this song we played last night, the chorus went around twice the first time and only went around once before. I went to the bridge a second time. And I'm literally in the middle of it going, is this the first time or the second time we played this? Has that happened to you? Well, yeah, but you know what, you're, you know that here's the thing is after enough experience, and Stevie's to say that she said, if we just make our ears real big and pay attention, we have the tools and we'll be all right.

Speaker 2:          00:16:38       And while he bought her find about that, not what I find that about that as a ratio. The other thing is I can really be front running the deal. Right. You know, it's no different than, you know, quarterback who's he's taking the snap and the, and the receivers already down the, down the field and he's throwing the ball or you go, the guy's not down there yet. Right. You know, so when the guy gets down there and I'll see what's going on, then you act in the moment. And that's, I mean, that's really what, what I do, everything's about living in them in the, in the incident. And if you're listening to everybody, unless nobody knows what's going on, you'll all do it together or whatever it is, we'll be fine. And if it's not, you go back and retool and figure out what you did wrong together.

Speaker 2:          00:17:10       What's the worst example you have of like being up on a bandstand and nobody knew what was going on and they're all looking back at you like what he had, did it all just fall down the stairs there? Do you want me to hold the fake it, we started this Hendricks story. I do these tours. I wish, man, I wish this could I just seeing the look on your face. You like this 600 yards staring Islam. Uh Ah. Okay. Yeah, we had thinking about, I was thinking the first thing that came to my mind, I do, I'm the drummer for the experience Hendrix tours, which I played with everybody, right? That's like three hours long. And we did this one tour that started in DC and the idea was, you know, everybody knows Jimmy Hendrix songs and we'll just all show up and you know, and we go, we got this, we got this in her employment, these guys and what, how does he do it and does he do it the same way, you know, whatever.

Speaker 2:          00:17:56       And so we go out there, they're sold out houses. Like, as this, I'm counting off the song, guys are going to buy keys sitting on, you know, like you gotta be kidding me. Oh No. It's like train wreck after train wreck. And they're not only looking at me, but you know, I'm going, I thought this is where it goes to the, the chorus. But how come you're, what do you do? You know, they're looking at me and I'm looking at them and you know, this whole thing, it's like everybody's up there with their pants down, you know, and everybody in the audience, how many people are watching 4,000. Oh, Jayson. And they're like, with their mouths open going, I pay $250 for the seat. What are y'all doing up there? You know, and it's just like mayhem. I'm going to, uh, you know, I know how many gigs, I mean, I imagine after that you guys just said immediately went to the practice room.

Speaker 2:          00:18:37       We work that out. Well, yeah, but yeah, but then, but then you're on the tour, so it's like your gig and every day. And so you used the catch as catch can sound check. Hey, let's get together in this room. Let me show you what I was thinking about that on that song. And you know, for me, I'm listening to everybody cause there was, hey, let's do this. Hey, let's don't do that. I'm going, okay, let me keep it straight because then a few hours we're going to go hit. And how long did it take for you guys to, to whip that into shape? I don't know, eight or nine years. That's a work in progress. But I mean, to the point that people in the crowd, novices weren't noticing the look of panic or be it in the wrong key and oh, it took us a few shows.

Speaker 2:          00:19:13       But you know, that's the thing. It becomes personal. You know, you do your work and you do something. I don't know if that, you know, sometimes that's funny. And you got, it could have been funnier. I, and you know, it could be better, but the thing about me is I'm up to it by myself. So, even if I'm falling off the rails, whatever direction I decided to go into to, uh, to try and right the ship, it's 100% of the performance up there are going in that direction. So at least it looks good cause it's just me. So whatever decision I make, it's not like I'm looking at the bass player and he, he goes left and I go right. And the whole thing falls down. Like I've, I've always been amazed at, but let me get back to, cause you already brought up Stevie, I know there's listeners going like they want to hear those stories.

Speaker 2:          00:19:48       So anyways, so two years in you get, um, you get a, you getting a pay check and all that. You, you, you're working in 21, 22 at that point, 20 years old. So here's what, you know, 2020 almost 21 my roommate says he got to come out, see our band, you know, I said, yeah, yeah, but I've been working all the time. So it was a Tuesday night and I went out to go see him. And this is interesting because when I walked up to a place called Soak Creek saloon and it was a big old frame house then got, and it was just a club out in the country and I walk up, I hear the Mamet man's house, grandma and I heard this guitar town that wasn't any louder than the rest of the band through the wall, but I could hear it like it was like right there in my ear.

Speaker 2:          00:20:27       I'm a tough one. Is that? Yeah. And I walked through the door and I turn and my guy go, right. My eyes went right to Stevie on with that guy is fascinating and I was seeing a lot of people, but I'm went, there's something about this guy. I go out the next lap, I go out the next week and to go see him again because I'm really digging the band and their late and my roommate turns to the guys and when to get my mom to get my, why don't we get my roommate up here? He goes, really good drum the gang and then I'll sweat for Rodney. So some more, a little more time goes mom, places packing the God, God get him up here. So I get up there and I play like four songs with them and I'll look over and Steve, he's kind of looking over shoulder, kind of giving me the wink, you know, and the very next day, nice.

Speaker 2:          00:21:09       He comes over to the apartment, he walks in on me and I'm playing along to this Donny Hathaway live record. Everything is everything. Willie Weeks and Freddie Wyatt and I'm like, it all settled, look up, but he's like standing like four inches from me and it startled me. Went, no man, go ahead. Oh Man. He goes, what? Donny Hathaway. Huh? I go, yeah, he goes, ask one of my favorite records. So we started chatting and I tell him, I said, man, I love to work with you. So I think that we could do some great stuff. What was it like that, that first time when you played those four songs? I know you've taken in the whole band. I know. It's just like, all right, the next drama is going to show up. I don't know how that works, if he's going to be upset that you weren't as drums or whatever, but where you still had that feeling as Stevie's playing?

Speaker 2:          00:21:48       I mean, I didn't know what was the context of the band? Was there a singer? Was Stevie singing and was, was he just a considered like a side man? Guitar player? He was a side of me and kind of featured Solos and he's saying like he's saying a song. There was two guitar players, there was a bass player, a drummer, singer, solo singer, um, and a sax player. Then my friend, my roommate, Joe sublet. Okay. And where, where was Stevie's playing at that point was very r and B, like, you know, he'd, he'd come from Dallas and his brother Jimmy had really, when he heard Jimmy played guitar, thought maybe ought to do right. So he was thinking, I was like, you know, it was like Freddie King and uh, you know, Eddie Taylor, Jimmy Reed and slim Harpo and a bunch of BB king. Freddy was, was his playing at the level at that point already.

Speaker 2:          00:22:32       We like this guy is going to be one of the greats of all time. Well you know what, he was just fabulous anyway. You know what I mean? But he wasn't as out front and, and grandiose is the really the wrong word. I know you can do anything he wanted to do, but he what he did, he could play one note and he went, that's the coolest note I've ever heard. He's just going back home, you know, and just had it or recordings of him when he was like 12 years old. And he was like, when he was, he sounded like Eric Clapton cause he was like, you know, because yeah, he was playing Eric Clapton looks like a, that sounds like Eric Club goes ceviche 12, you know, so it's like, so he could just say, you know what, I hated that. It's like, just pick anything up and sound fabulous.

Speaker 2:          00:23:09       Know I know that God so did, um, so then he's standing there and like, so at that point, I mean it's weird because he's just a guy named Stevie, Stevie Vaughn, Stevie Vaughn at that point. Okay. And this is probably like, what are we talking at this point? Mid Seventies, late seventies is 19. This is like late, early 1977, 77. So he's still wearing like that sort of that big skully cap. He didn't have in bowling shirts and you know, Brogan shoes and you know, pleated pants and stuff. So at, so at that point when he, uh, he says, um, you know, that that's one of his favorite records. So where did it go from there? Well, he left. Um, the two, fast forward some, a woman living on Barton is a singer in Texas, pulled him out of the cobras to start a band called triple threat review.

Speaker 2:          00:23:58       That lasted like five or six months and then it blew apart and it turned into double trouble. And that's when I came in. He asked me to say we want to play in our band. So in, in a, in a fast evolution, you know, eventually ended up, it was Stevie and myself and Tommy Shannon. I mean, there's stories of all this, but you know, but that became the trio that, you know, that speaks in that light. The front. I know you've probably answered this a zillion times, but what was that like the first time you guys all got together in a room when it was just the three of you and there was all that space now Stevie to play? Well, that's when his guitar plan started changing because he was, you know, he's mean to me is a musical genius. And then he followed that intuition perfectly.

Speaker 2:          00:24:37       The thing we were just talking about and that he went, he knew that he couldn't be in a trio format, he couldn't be just a rhythm and rhythm and Blues Guitar Player. So he immediately, he started incorporating solos and rhythm all into one kind of thing, which sounded like two or three guitar players, like a four or five piece band and three with three guys. And he was, now he was singing because he was singing all the songs and he develops quickly. You know, his thing developed very, very quickly. So now we kind of start stepping out. But the, the part of the reason that we went from a five piece band with three piece band is that some have said Manyatta do like a Jimmy Hendrix tune. So we did I that guys sounds like Hendrix and then everyone. So the first one you guys did, we did, well we did voted child and we did it forever.

Speaker 2:          00:25:17       We did at our whole life. But we did, you know, we'd, we'd do a gig every once in a while where we do all Hendricks Stub, manic depression and hey Joe and, and uh, you know, it has been, everybody else in the band was like, don't play that shit. You know, we're a blues band, you know, and it just kind of, the rub came to, became a, a wedge has really kind of what happened on the musical side of all that was, oh, was that like a Texas Blues purists saying, yeah, yeah, yeah. We don't do that shit around here. You know, we played blues, played appropriately and there's a lot of great traditional, a great upholding of tradition in Texas till lots of different things. But you know, we were the ones that were like, we were in the white kind of a little bit outcast cause like if we're doing this wild shit, we're playing too loud playing Jimi Hendrix songs.

Speaker 2:          00:25:59       We started doing superstition by Stevie wonder cause we discovered we were big fans of all these people and people like yeah, no it's blues and, and and I'm thinking I must have been exciting for you because just sitting in with a blues band after a while is a drummer. I mean that can get monotonous is trying to play it like a how many, how many different ways can you play a shuffle? And I'm sure you could say a thousand but I'm just saying just sitting in with the like I never, I've ever, I mean it's ridiculous that I'm even trying to relate to you on this level, but anytime I've sat in and when people start playing blues at Bomp Bomp bomp dump on and you just sit in back then it's like I want to kill myself after one and a half songs. You might need to examine that more deeply. You know what? It's funny because I tell people, they go, hey, you know this and that about your Microsoft

Speaker 1:          00:26:44       only know like four beats. But I know a lot of different ways to play the same four beats. I mean, and shuffles or like endless. And that's what's actually beautiful about them to me. And I didn't know this until I started doing that and somebody said, hey man, check this out. I mean, out on the spot. Right. You know, metaphorically, you know? And they went, no, no, no, no, no, no, you're going cooking. Good con cocoon. But it's really Putin, Pataki, Pataki platoon. I was like, Gah Gah, Gah, Gah, Gah, Gah. Oh Wow. It's like endless varieties. Like it's like, how do you make a stew? It's like, Nah, it's meat and potatoes and care. So yeah. What about all the other shit in between that makes it something really great or something like just fucking meat and potatoes and carrots, you know? And that's kind of that simple really, or that complex or the only way I can compare that to what I do is, uh, I guess if you take a joke and you can just do the joke, you can just stand there and say it.

Speaker 1:          00:27:36       You can act it out. You can have two characters in it talking and you can end up basically taking something that was essentially a shit joke. Oh, Riddick joke or whatever. And you can, you can actually flesh it out into a piece, which I guess I don't know what, there's really no definitions and comedies like when it makes a bit what makes a piece, but you can, you can have a little performance piece, um, out of that. And uh, I've always, I've just had such an admiration for them for like musicians, your guys' ability to, uh, like I don't feel like, like what I do as far as this like talking and that type does everybody talks. So it's kind of like your jam and all day with people. So you can immediately think something and then say it. The fact that you guys can do that musically, like sonically.

Speaker 1:          00:28:20       Think of think of Phil or think a lick and then just as you're thinking it, play it the way. If I thought it, whatever words I'm saying right now, I mean to me like that is, is is when you like really master like a, an instrument or something like that. You know what's funny? When I saw your show in Austin, you came out talking about the, about dogs balls, you know? Yeah. He's cutting up balls off and I thought that's funny as shit. And I go, that's true. You know, we got a dog and my wife, so we got to get him fixed. I went, can we let him have him tear off one piece before it? She's like, no, no, no, no, but I'm thinking about it. You said it and I actually related to that skit to somebody else and they're like, so what's the deal? I was like, it was funny as shit when he said it. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:29:03       That's like when I tried to play is now Chris plays it. It sounds awesome. Now it's like fuck. Gives you the chills when I play, it makes people go shadow off. Oh God. How much longer you have playing like all, all of that stuff. So, uh, so you Tommy and Stevie play and then eventually, uh Huh. So how long did you do jam for? Like I know like, um, I know I'm going through all this shit. I'm, I'm getting self conscious here that I'm dragging you through the same. Nah, that's okay. I haven't, you know, I'm going to try to ask different questions and everybody knows the story that David Bowie stuff and all of that, you know, David Bowie's, you actually, would you mind telling the getting booed and France thing just because people know me for getting booed and Philly? No. Ugh. Yeah. Got to tell you this. This was

Speaker 2:          00:29:42       Larry's cause the woman Lou Ann Barton, I have to say it, we fired her for the band for misconduct, if you will. And she gets a big record deal from Jerry Wexler. Wait, wait, where was she in the band? She was, yeah, she was originally in double trouble for just a little bit and she was the lead singer. She's saying most all of the material. Okay. So she's out of the band. She gets a deal with Jerry Wexler, discovers her in New York, gets her deal on Electra. She does this records, get the muscle shoals rhythm section. Uh, Don Frye sings all these, all of these people come in. So went to a record release comes to be, she goes, she goes, you guys want to play my record release party? I was like, yeah, you let her go. Yeah, no, not right. She didn't, did she do it out of spite you think, you know?

Speaker 2:          00:30:29       Hell, I don't know. You know, maybe I could call her and ask her, but um, but were there playing and Jerry Wexler's there and he's like out there dancing and he says, great band. Um, you know what? You guys need to go to Montreux Switzerland. He goes, I'm going to call my friend Claude nobs. I'm going to talk to him about all this. Well, he does it short over a couple of days later, we get an invitation to go. I got a spot. We never been signed. That kid was in Switzerland. It wasn't in France now. Yeah, it was Montreux Switzerland. Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. All these years I thought it was friends and, well, here we go. Okay. So we go and we're the only electric band on this night because he just slotted us in because there was a time slot and it's a jazz festival. Well, you know [inaudible], he's speaking Montreaux jazz.

Speaker 2:          00:31:07       And if they come, they'll call it international music festivals. It's kind of a mix of a lot of stuff. But that night was all like Acoustic Blues, upright and piano and guitar sitting on stools and that kind of thing. Traditional, traditional, there's that word again. We get up coming back to haunt you guys to haunt us against. So we get up there, we got all these electric instruments and stuff and we start playing. And people were like, you think like, they're like, they're sitting in a hurricane or something. And they're like, I think a pool, you know, was like, and we're like, shit, we plan. I've seen that you can actually get this on DVD. And, yeah, no it's, and it's a bummer because, see where, but birdwalk in Texas making like three, four or $500 a gig and our man, the owners of our management group loaned us 15 grand to do this whole trip.

Speaker 2:          00:31:52       We mean we took everything over there cause we can't be without our gear, you know. Wow. Um, and we're, we're sitting backstage and Stevie looks at me, he goes, well, I didn't think we sounded that bad. I don't want, I didn't hate her. And though it sounds like, yeah. And they go, Eh, David Bell, he would like to meet with you. Ahmet which David Bowie. And they went the Mr. David Bowie, the accountant, the rockstars. David Bowie. The wrestler. Yeah. And so that's kind of how that started. We were there another night. We played downstairs, we didn't have a Gig, we were just lolly gagging on this loan. And so we, we play down in the musicians. Bart's with Jackson Brown and his guys came through and he say, you're ever in La, you can have my studio, which we did. We just recorded some tapes and you know, all this, there was a whole bunch to the story, but they just kind of sat there until we, back to John Hammond said, hey, Stevie's looking to do this thing, but we got these tapes that we recorded a legitimate types and he's in, John Hammond was our, he was our, our white knight.

Speaker 2:          00:32:48       He was our champion. He loved all of us. He loved the band. He thought Steve was one of the greatest guitar players you've heard since Robert Johnson. Wow. And he went to, he went to epic, Sony, epic, cvs. He is me. And there was a guy there, Greg Geller, he said, Greg, you need to sign these guys up. And they said, yeah, I'll do it. He goes, I'm getting ready to get fired anyway because I'm going to reissue the whole okay label cause it's been out of circulation. They're gonna fire me for that. So I'll let them also far me for this. And he did that and that's what happened. And the record came out. And, um, you know, Stevie didn't go work with Bowie after the record, didn't do the tour and off we were, you know, now you, what I loved about that whole, that whole watching

Speaker 1:          00:33:25       the concert footage of you guys when you get booed there in Switzerland for all these years, I thought it was France, is the fact that you could see it affecting you guys. Cause you guys would play the song and then an end, the bu or whatever they, they boo. And then, but then when you guys, you guys come one time he saw Stevie shoulders kind of slump a little bit, but the second he goes to do a song, you count off the song you guys played. You didn't hold back at all and he just went just as hard. All you guys, uh, if you didn't hear this, that does the sound of the crowd, you would think that the way you guys were playing, that you would, doing what you always did, which was, was kill it. And I got a lot of inspiration out of, out of watching that I'm just doing what I do or are auditioning herself. You know the, sometimes I get these acting gigs, I got to do some crazy stuff that I'm sitting there and you had going like, oh my God, this is outside my comfort zone. And like seeing stuff like that, it's just like, just plow through this.

Speaker 2:          00:34:23       Um, fuck them. You know what, that was inspirational to me because I learned something there and I saw it in action. It wasn't told to me is that he had this passion and commitment. He was sitting over there on the couch playing the guitar or he'd have, he put, he put the same thing into it as he is. He would if we were playing for over 100,000 people because that's just how he lived. And I'm like, man, that's a great example. You know, cause like, yeah, I kind of do this. I'm going to see when the stakes get higher. I'll kind of put a little bit more juice into that kind of wishy washy and as he was like full on 110% all the time. So when you guys are riding on a tour bus, when he's noodling around, it sounds like he's already playing the show.

Speaker 2:          00:35:01       Yeah, because he's got the same passion and the focus and the commitment to what he's doing as he's not performing. You know? I mean, he's not jumping to been incredible to be as awesome as, I mean, you know, like I was spoiled right off the bat. You know, it's like I go, you know, this is early in my career and I was 20 I talked to Mitch Mitchell about this, about the, you know, the death of Jimmy Hendrickson is like, it's a hard deal when you lose somebody like that and you, you were, you come to, in my case, I came to go, you know, I was grateful that I had the whole experience. I think it was a hard thing to lose, but there were so many things that I got from that. Just simple lessons and you know, I think they were in me, they'd been, they'd been demonstrated but they hadn't really taken root.

Speaker 2:          00:35:37       But when you live them and you got, man, this is a great way to be and you see that you get the result on every level. We're talking about money, success. Our success was that our music was successful to us. It meant everything to us. We had a great time doing it together and that you just go, this is it's self evident right now and you know, and somebody leads that typically somebody is there to show you something. You Go, wow, you know what, I dig that, that touch me. That meant something and I'm going to grab onto that and that's, these are the great things in life. And then unfortunately you don't really fully know

Speaker 1:          00:36:09       realize it after they just, this the profoundness of losing somebody. I lost a great friend of Patrice O'Neal a few years ago and he was the guy like I would compare like he was like Stevie Ray Vaughan level guy accepted when like stand up and um, you know, you just don't expect him. He was like 41 years old. You're not thinking that this is going to be the last time I get to see him perform and, and that type of thing. So it ends up having a, when you really go back and examine the whole x basically experienced, because I don't know if Stevie was the same thing, like being friends with Patrice was beyond being friends with them. It was like it you, you walked out in public with him and him just messing with people. Was this experience that like I, I, I've tried to tell the stories on the podcast and try to explain what it was like. You just can't, when you're around that level of, uh, artists or just, just greatness.

Speaker 2:          00:37:01       I know their words where there on for Zena. But that's that thing that you don't know what you got until it's gone. You know? It's Cliche as hell, but it's true. You know? That's why it sticks. It's like, man, that was fabulous.

Speaker 1:          00:37:13       Yeah. I learned that awful lesson that like, you're like your friends, that's like, I can't explain that the friendship is not yours. It's like, it's like this thing that's given to you and you just have to enjoy it and then you got to be enjoying it because it's just taken away or it goes in a different direction, whatever you want to say. And then you just kind of left there like, you know,

Speaker 2:          00:37:34       well, you know, living in the moment, being able to actually live in the moment, I don't know, to be grateful for your surroundings cause we can get you don't get on my pity party and all this shit and go back to my Catholic guilt and shame and all like, ah, you know, you know, and I mean it's true. I mean Stevie, I was like, when after he died I was like, God, that guy really meant a lot in my life. And I go half the time I wanted to strangle him and I go, we were like brothers, like the Bro, you know, he was like a brother. I never had, he had a brother, you know, a real brother and, but I go, you know, it was, it's everything. It's always everything. There's the, our, our, our perception of the good and the bad or whatever it is. But essentially it's like I go, everything was wonderful. It was life and it was really wonderful. I always wondered like, that's the time, like, you know, the loneliness of being a comedian on the road. But whenever I hear stories of yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:38:20       hands, you know, being in a van together, just traveling and, and you know, just all the shit that you guys go through. Like I've traveled with other comedians and stuff and there's like, there's that thing where you just have to, after a while it'd be like, okay, this is going to be, the guy is going to be the addict. There's going to be, the Pussy Hound is going to be the ego maniac. The dude who's got to sleep til four, like there's just going to be the end. You got to understand that you're that guy somehow, but you can't see it because you're in yourself. So you're slowly something you are doing that is annoying the shit out of somebody else. And you have to somehow, uh, like I gotta be honest with you, like after a year, so of touring with other comics and everything. This past year I did a tour with this comic Paul Versey and, um, he's a New York guy.

Speaker 1:          00:39:06       I'm a Boston guy. What else? You always argue sports. And we went up to, uh, toward all of Canada and we basically spent every waking moment essentially with each other for about 10 days. And we never argued once and all I, it was just through years of being, he's also a really easy guy to get along with, but we just, we had it, we ended up having a couple of inside jokes that we had, which always seems bands always have like inside jokes and you're on catch phrases and we just kind of tore through Canada making each other laugh, uh, throughout the whole thing. And, uh, and it wasn't until the end, he actually first he actually mentioned, he's like, dude, do you realize we've, we've been, we've done like 20 shows together, taught all over this God Damn Tundra. We haven't argued once. And I was, ah, you know, I didn't even notice that we're doing this stupid fake crying thing that was just making each other laugh.

Speaker 1:          00:39:56       Just saying over the top sensitive stuff. Like I just really liked he was a friend. Oh, it's that dumb shit. Oh, we had all that stuff. Just kept you going. Then you have the wheel. We had like these alternate personalities when we, when we realized that we were like really going insane on each other. You know, mom was Harold as, oh, he called me and I would watch hell would do. And I go, I don't know what you do and Brady in the Brady Boyd, you should trying to have a good Tom, you know, and we get, and we would actually stay in these characters for like an hour. I'm going, God, how sick Arlene. And then we come out of them. We could actually live with our circumstances because you know, it gets tight. You know, you're there. You realize like not only is that genius comedically, that's also if I had some sodas, you know, psychology background, that's also probably red flags of slowly going insane.

Speaker 1:          00:40:43       No, I am insane. I'm, I'm, I think I've been actually somewhat restored to sanity, but you know, I'm still working on it. Right. That all goes to the seven deadly sins, you know, and tried to sort it out over your bill. Oh, I know. Jesus. Don't even talk to me about those. What, what is, what's the longest time you ever spent out on tour? Oh, shout because you guys like people always to say to Comedians, hey, you're doing a tour a year on tour. And it's like, you know, the most I'll ever be gone as a week and a half, maybe two weeks. But you guys lets it. Yeah. Gotcha. And all I gotta do, all they gotta do is, yeah, let's deal with the insanity, my own mind. I don't have to deal with other people's, like once you kind of figure yourself out, you know, when you can kind of see what demons you give into. And of course you got to ride that for a while and keep fucking up and running to the brick wall. But then hopefully you grow from it. You can kind of manage your own a little bit, but you

Speaker 2:          00:41:34       guys like, I mean how many fucking bands out there I did, they broke up and then they needed to get back together for money and they get back together from money and within six months they go right back to where they were emotionally 30 years earlier. And I got a whole thing on that but I won't get into that. But to answer your question, um, we never came off the road and using double trouble isn't the answer to the question. You know, when Texas flood came out and we started touring, we were like for nine years we virtually never came home. I mean I'd go out for it, we'd go out for like two months. I come home for like four days and go to Europe for like five weeks and kill like a week. How do you pay your bills? How do you pay your taxes?

Speaker 2:          00:42:12       You know, while I had a business manager and account and I've got a great wife at home, I've been married for 29 years and she kept the whole household together and she was all right with you being on guns. I think she's know she'd be like, uh, great, your home. And then like a few days and she goes, when are you leaving again? You know, I'm like, no, it was good. That was awesome. My wife, she'll be like, can you be doing stand up tonight? Yeah. Usually when there's a TV show on that she wants to watch and I sit down and I can't keep my mouth shut. I'm literally like a five year old and I sit down. I, I'm either going to be making noise, doing something or I'm going to be talking to the TV, like it's a person and uh, like, I don't know.

Speaker 2:          00:42:50       Do you find like, do you get like scatterbrained if you go on the road too long and you finally get, can't like shut it off? Oh, well yeah. I mean, it happens both ways for me because when I come home, you know, like she said, I was just talking to her, my wife Betty, she said she's, you know, it's apparently been nice since you've been gone, you know, and you know what she says that with all the love and are hard because I get home and I'm like bouncing all over the place and she's, you know, everybody gets their own life. Everybody has their own. I see. Like you run back into the house and they're like, Hey, I'm home. And they go, oh hang on a minute. Yeah. Then a different vibe going on here. Since you've been gone let you try to like assimilate back into the general culture, you know, other than it's my kingdom and I'm busting it, you know, so no, I get it.

Speaker 2:          00:43:31       You know, since I mean it works, you know, you don't, you know what I've always, I think instinctively know that I've needed to have with my house is I need a room over the garage. And I feel like when I come home and it's almost like, you know, if you have like the Benz except you're coming off the rose and they just send you into that room and you got a TV, you've got something to work out, like an elliptical machine, just something and you gotta like just slowly ease your way back into civilization. Bill, I'm not one, I highly recommend that. That very thing you just described. It works pretty well. Well let's hear about it. What isn't it? Well I've got another house in Austin and I've got my studio there, so I go over there and do my thing when I'm referring to at least have a place in the country outside of Austin had a guest house studio that was about 150 feet from the main house. So when I come back I'd go over there. That's where did all my workout at a pool outside now go swim and you know, do my thing. So that kind of like go there, go to the house, stay there or go to the, you know,

Speaker 1:          00:44:32       it was right to not just kind of like, just be like a truck busting through the wall coming home. I know strangers, that's your own damn house. I know that's my take on it. You know, you could hear the other side to see if it go he's full of Shit. That's not how it worked. But if that's how I saw it and that's what I, that's how I used it. Well let me, I'm going to ask you a couple of questions here. See what we get. We got left here, cruising along here. Um, so maybe a couple break it up for you. Some non musical questions. Cause I'm sure obviously people have actually the same damn questions I've asked you. Uh, I saw this thing in the news. My listeners were asking me about it. There's this billionaire is getting a divorce, right? He married, he married this woman.

Speaker 1:          00:45:09       He had a company, it was worth like 50 million bucks in a oil company. They've been together for 20 something years. They get a divorce. He writes her a check for just under a billion dollars. Who was 990 something million or 980 something million, something, something in like 31 cents, something crazy. They had worked out. He writes her the check, the check for almost a billion dollars and she turned it down. Who says, I don't, I don't know from Texas. They might be, they might be. Her thing is that he's, his company's worth 20 million bucks now and she's only getting $1 billion. She's entitled to more because she helped support him through all of those years. What, what, what, what is your, uh, he got rubbing your head. What is your take on that? Oh, I had a friend who got divorced when Tom and he said, God dangit. He goes, my wife, he goes, you know what?

Speaker 1:          00:45:55       Here's, here's the deal. He goes, she goes, she told me, she goes, what's, what's your hours is mine and what's mine is mine and what's yours is mine and maybe more so like, oh, I don't know. I mean, what, why did they think I wish I should have had a female on this? Like, why do they like, you know what I feel when I look at that thing that is not even about money. No, it's not. It's, it's like Kevin Spacey's thing on House of cards when he turns towards the camera and he says sex is about everything other than sex. You know, y'all are going, it's not really a dye can't put dollars and cents on a really. But when all that deep, they want you to feel pain. And the thing about it, you know what I think this guide that I think the reason why she didn't take big take that money is because that guy fucked up.

Speaker 1:          00:46:41       First of all, they showed the check on TV cause eventually she cashed it because she had, she needs money to live, which is hilarious. Um, it's like you've got enough money to live 10 20 lifestyles the way Mc hammer lived. Yeah. He could actually, she could actually save Oakland, um, with that kind of money. But he, uh, she, this dude just, he wrote it on like a personal, it wasn't even like on like a being like a business checks, a little bit longer, bigger sums. This guy took it out on just like some regular like eat the same checkbook if you live in let's two week, that's insulting a little. And that's what he did. And he wrote her name and just went scribble, scribble, scribble a tear. Here you go. And I imagined she walked out and was just like, wait a minute. So that's it. So I get it. I mean, I know I've got $1 billion. This motherfucker has billion dollars. He's

Speaker 2:          00:47:30       all this shit. He's ugly. But with that money he's going to be able to get himself a hot piece that will at least pretend to like him. He's got enough money for every Ferrari on the planet. I was like another billion coming down the road to me. Yeah. Like this guy is not going to feel any sort of pain whatsoever. I'm not okay with that. So everybody is watching this going, this woman is a gold digging whores and I, I think it has to do, not a whore gold digger, but like I think it has to do more with a emotion. Yeah, we lost everything. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, I, that's, I mean, I don't know anything other than if my wife divorced me, I guess she's been by me for a years ago and I mean, if it was something like, you know, Hell hath no fury like a woman scorned.

Speaker 2:          00:48:10       I don't know what the guy did. I don't know anything about any of that. But I go, if she felt really like, like I had done something to go, she like, Hey, I've been here for years, you know, supporting this thing. Right. You know, that's my time. I can only speak to my own personal experience. I had never, and I'm not in divorce, I'm happily married and thank God for that. I'm grateful that I am. But you know, I don't know. I mean, you know, I don't, I don't know what all that means other than, than feelings have no real pressure on them. Or they do. Maybe they do and it's not enough. You know, he should have let her down easy or God, he should've just fake cried as he was riding it. Be just, he should have shown some sort of pain and he didn't, uh, he probably sat with his eyebrows up and you know, looking through.

Speaker 2:          00:48:56       It was dumb. Reading glasses. How much you watch. I'll throw in another million. There you go. All right sweetheart. See you. That's what I don't know. Yeah, it's great that you've been married for how long? 29 years. 29 years. That's amazing. Can you pay you just to keep it going? Yeah. Yeah. So far so good. I did bring you something cause I thought bill is going to want to talk about football. So I got you a little cookie today. I know. We are actually a, I gotta check to study. Got me Cook because he knows that I bake. I know. Yeah. No, that's that thing too. Yeah. Oh it's the shape of a little football. But Mike, we got to get a picture of this. I got to tell you, this is the most adorable thing another man has ever gone.

Speaker 2:          00:49:37       Larry, are you a big football fan? No. You brought, no, that's why I brought you the cookie because they'll thought, and I actually broached the subject. I go, you know I'm, I've been, I'm a Green Bay fan. She says, people in Texas here, there, I liked green bay because they're owned by the people in Green Bay. I love that idea. That's a great answer. I love that answer. I love that. It's not the billionaire that cause I'm going to buy me my, my own team or whatever. That's fine too. But I love that. I breakfast her one morning and the fry cooks like, yeah, I own like a share. I was like, right on man. He goes, I'm a route and forum going. I love that. But how does that work? He owns a share, but it's not like a, they call them up and be like, how much money should we give Aaron Rodgers? I only know says this. I Dunno. I Dunno, but saw, yeah, he might want to talk about football and you know, I love a good football game as much as anybody because I was at Starbucks and I'll look down, I saw the football cooking ware. That's for Bill Burr. I'm going to get him a cookie.

Speaker 2:          00:50:33       You're always going with your gut. This is ridiculous, man. I can't believe that you're doing my podcast. And he goes, you brought me a cookie and then you brought me, uh, you know, I, last time I saw you when you were playing the Greek Kenny Wayne Shepherd a, I brought you my uh, my Carnegie Hall Album, which you guys played, right? Hey, you guys bought the Mariachi suits. That's the, I know a little bit about your band, but I think I'm going to give him that suit to the rock and roll hall of fame because we just got inducted. We're going Stevie Ray Vaughan and double trouble or being stuck right this year. And they called about some stuff. I thought I was thinking about the, you get that suit that I played it. I had made Jesus that took them long enough on it. It's beyond me. I don't know. You know what we did?

Speaker 2:          00:51:12       We stopped doing that. We see what we were doing 25 years ago and somebody said, hey, guess what? I'll go, the people did it. The people who vote in the, in the, in the, in the, the general public gave us 18 and a half million votes. If you talked to Tommy, do you guys think, yeah, you guys going to play when you, and yet we're going to play. Who, uh, who are you going to get to sit in? That's secret. Now we don't know where it's, we're still kind of sorting all that out. We don't know. Exactly, seriously. You know, you guys had the respect of everybody. So I would think that all the usual suspects that you guys played for and then some, there's some suspicious people out there. Hey, I got that GME. Yes, Eric. Well, there's all, you know, we know we, we know all these people.

Speaker 2:          00:51:51       And so, you know, when I would think there's all these younger players, yeah, I would want to John Mayer and those guys would want to come. Uh, I bet you would think just a test testament to the music that you guys put out. Um, they would all want to play with you. So what do I got here? So I was just mentioning that I gave you my, uh, on vinyl, my album from a Carnegie hall. Now you brought me Stevie Ray Vaughan and double trouble trouble, uh, Texas hurricane. This looks like there's like 10 records and you know, well, let me tell you why. Look set me. Tell you why that's so big. Um, it's funny because I had, I saw that sit in my studio and you gave me that vinyl. I'm uh, yeah, I'm just, I'm going to take that to him because of what we've talked about.

Speaker 2:          00:52:31       And that right there is a 200 gram vinyl of are the definitive box set that's, those are 45 rpm disk. So it doesn't get any better than that unless she were in the studio, which they're all 45. No, no. It's a no, it's a regular 12 inch like an album, but it spins it 45 rpm. That's why there's so much so many disks in there. Oh my God. Now, so what does that do? Does that make the sound quality? Yeah, it's better than 33 and a third. I love this as this is shit cause I don't know any of that. No. You know what? You put that on your stereo in, in, in whatever you liked about our music. It, there's no way that it can sound any better than what's in that box. And that's for sale. I mean that's that. We just came out with that. You can get those wherever, wherever they, where you can buy vinyl or acoustic sounds and Salina, Kansas, you can get the suboxone and 33 and a third or 45 rpm. The 45 rpm is like the cream of the crop. All right, so I gotta I

Speaker 1:          00:53:26       got, I'm going to go out on a limb here and say that this is going to be a collector's item at some point. I can't believe that you gave this to me minutes. All I gave you was I didn't pay much for it. Only blood, sweat do I gave you, I gave you a bunch of Shit and Dick Jokes on a record. High Man. Exquisite sound by the way. I want it to be a comedian. When I was a kid I wanted to be a comedian. Is that right? Yeah. People said, well, you're already a smart ass. Maybe you can actually say something intelligent and turn that into, you know, real comedy that you go, Oh, did you like when you were growing up? Oh, well you know, let's talk comedy here, Chris. Well, you know, I like Richard Pryor. Love Jonathan Winters. Did you ever get to see prior in concert?

Speaker 1:          00:54:00       No, I didn't. Did you see Jonathan Winters? No. I saw him on TV and you know, the tapes and whatnot. George Carlin. George Carlin was like heavy. Yeah. Um, yeah, he was probably the most, uh, and I don't know, I'm trying to think of anybody that was more prolific as far as it did. It did stand up like all these guys now who are just putting out special, special, special man. I'm trying to do it too was a, that's all he was the one that showed that that was possible. That every two, three years, you know, you could, I mean, you can't come up with an hour like his button. I mean, it was possible to have a, a at least an hour that was special worthy, that was worthy of being, uh, recorded. Um, I dunno man, like, uh, that guy for me was, you know, for me it was always, it was prior Carlin Cosby Kinison.

Speaker 1:          00:54:50       Uh, then all those older guys that I watched with my dad foster Brooks, Martin and Lewis Shecky Greene election fuck up. You know who I loved that I stumbled upon. Um, over the Christmas break. You, have you ever seen a, it's a mad, mad, mad, mad world. Yes. Long time ago. Yeah. I, that's one of my favorite movies and every once in a while I got to own that thing for some reason I don't own it. And I saw a, I watched it and there's a guy in there, this comedian, Dick Shawn addiction on nine. Dick Shawn plays the guy that he thinks somebody is doing something bad to his mother and he's driving, he's trying to, he's trying to catch Milton Berle and there's a clip of him that just when he's dancing with this woman and just the over the top emotion of him. And uh, I watched some of his standup and he was really kind of ahead of his time with like the physicality, the repeating and like the cadence, the way he performed his stuff.

Speaker 1:          00:55:43       And it kind of from when I was able to read up on the guy, he was like a comic's comic, never quite hit the, uh, the mainstream. And uh, had a really crazy, uh, when he died, he actually died on stage doing a gig down, uh, one of the colleges down in San Diego and he's literally on stage and you know, he was doing a bunch of physical stuff, making people laugh. And then he had a, he had a heart attack, did like a face plant and he's just lying there and people feel like three minutes. That was part of the act. It sounds like a drummer death certain oh yeah, yeah. I'm under a number of drivers of diet on stage. You thought there's a reason for that? Oh, I don't know, man. Got Shot, you know, I know there's a good shot on stage. I'll he got shot up. No, no, no, no, no. Um, I thought he got shit done. No, no, no, no. Sorry.

Speaker 3:          00:56:30       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:56:31       Oh, now I'm confused on, into the memory banks. No, there was nothing there. Um, he sounded like me right now. No, I'm so serious. Like, Oh, who got shot and who just died of a heart attack? Um,

Speaker 1:          00:56:43       a guy in Canada play with a friend of mine. He did die in the middle of the show. He turned around, he said, he said, hey, come on man. Pick up the beat. And the guy kept slowing down. All of a sudden everything came crashing down. The guy like just died. Oh God. Was he a big guy? He was a big guy, but he fell into the drum kit and it, he hit the guy in the back of the legs. All of a sudden there was no music come who got shot on stage was the comedian and the lugs that death go out. I'll laugh. Something, you know, that's an age falling into a drum. Kits are always fun I guess, unless you don't get back up. But uh, I don't know why I spun it in that direction, but basically the guy was laying there and people yell, no, you know, take his wallet thinking he was just joking with the guy was yeah, it was literally dying right in front of them.

Speaker 1:          00:57:24       So, all right, so I slogged you through all your old stuff. You were a sport about it. What's, uh, what do you got? You got the Stevens still thing coming up, but we, where can we see, where can people see you live? The man that, uh, hadn't knows an endless way to play a shuffle. You know what I should tell it should have had that ready. I didn't know you'd ask that. I'm going to be done. So it's funny, all great artists never know where the, where they're going to be. The worst promoters ever. So good. If you're a hack coming in here and I swear to God you would have, you'd have it all. You would, you would have handed me a one sheet of all the bullet points that you wanted to hit a, I'm telling you, well, lump bullet it out. Do you have, do you have an idea of when you're touring again?

Speaker 1:          00:58:06       Yeah. Well, there's something to do. A few shows in, in early February out here with Kenny Wayne Shepherd over going to be in the southern, the La area. I think we're doing a Gora. Okay. Uh, the Canyon Club are doing, who's that? Who's that? That keyboard player young. But he looked like Burton young. That was hilarious. One with somebody called me up in the, and I listened to that and I was like, his name is Riley Osborne. Riley Osborne, greatest keyboard player I ever saw him. He's awesome. I call him the Humphrey Bogart of piano. I mean, he's like, yeah. Yeah. Who said that about me? I said, Bill Barry goes, it was a Fox that I go, he's a comedian. He goes Murray Young. He was, I guess I kind of do look like him. Oh God, I already pissed the guy. I just waste, he's pissed off anyway, so it's okay. When I love was when he was his time to take a solo.

Speaker 1:          00:58:53       Just how he just went in so many different just effortlessly. It just I, I don't know, just watching you. One of my favorite thing, not only to watch a great musician is the, that extra added that he makes it look like he's not even, they're not even trying and I was watching you the way you will play in the shuffle and just the whole thing that you were doing like just always been a trans fixed. Some of the stuff that I loved, wish I could hear you play more as like the some of the jazz drum he did on stank swaying and that type of thing. It's like you really had and what was great. That was all the licks that you had, knowing that you had those in the bag, but you played for the song on a lot of those other ones. We just played straight and sit back and let Stevie, you know, run with it.

Speaker 1:          00:59:30       It was, I don't know, I've just tremendous amount of respect for you, uh, as a musician. And now as I'm starting to get to know you obviously as a person and I hope that I'm going to be able to get out to Austin this year. I might be going out there and March for south by southwest to promote the all things comedy network here and a, if you're around, if you'd like to come out to the show, uh, you know, come on down. The only stipulation is you got to bring your Shelby. I want to see it. Okay. That can be arranged because I'd be done. All right. All right. But everybody, Monday morning podcast, uh, with special guests, legendary drummer, Chris late and thank you for listening. Go fuck yourselves. I will talk to you next time.
