Speaker 1:          00:00:02       Hey, what's going on as bill burn? It's the Monday morning podcast for Monday, March 10th, 2014 how you're doing? How I um, I am in a country mood this week and I have deaf desperately trying to bring something positive. All right. I've been on the road here for 10 fucking days. I was going to do this thing with Versie again, but he's still sleeping and I got to get this thing up and get on with my day cause I got a two hour ride out to London, Ontario tonight and I got a fucking job to do. I'm in the middle of a fucking eight day run kit, you know, seven days. Then I got Montreal tomorrow and then I got a day off. I got a fucking day off and I'm going to go to the Bruins Canadians game. And um, you know, I have a great fucking time cause you can hear my voice is a, it's actually better.

Speaker 1:          00:00:58       It doesn't sound better, but it's actually better. It's holding up. Well, today is the halfway point of the epic 20 Day Canadian. Tor. Tor. Tor, yeah. Yeah, yeah. Um, we're having a great time up here. Um, probably too much fun. Uh, um, off the wagon as of last Monday. Um, but you know, I only got fucked up twice this week. You know, I got really fucked up about two nights ago, but other than that, and uh, I, I didn't miss being hung over. So for the most part, like last night I had a beer two nights before that I had one glass of wine. I mean, if you want to call that, if you want to call that ticky tack shit drinking. All right? You want to sit there with your fucking toes pointed at each other and your knees together. Right? Like some fucking jerk off waiting for a bus in a Norman Rockwell painting then, then you, you do that. All right. I don't count those. Okay. For what I heard a glass of wine every day is actually good for you. Fucking arteries. Race.

Speaker 2:          00:02:06       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:02:06       Oh, you hear that somebody finally committed a crime up here in Canada. What did he do? Did he put on somebody else's skates? Oh, sorry about that. Sorry. I like these people up here. Everybody says, sorry, I say sorry all the time. You know, hey, there's this pancake you made. Tastes like a fucking, somebody wiped her ass with it. Sorry. I'm sorry you didn't, you suck it. Make it a pancake. Right. Um, I actually had an apple for breakfast. If you're wandering trying to stay in shape when I'm up here now, it was kitten who, I'm not going to lie to you guys. I am fucking shot. I, I've been just traveling and doing my God damn act every fucking night. I am so sick of my God damn voice, which is great because it's making me say new stuff on stage and I've been writing a lot.

Speaker 1:          00:02:57       Now I'm not saying that I actually sit down and write. What I'm really saying is I'm just saying different shit on stage and um, you know, it was a lot of shit. Jokes, flooded Dick Jokes. But you know, I'm getting through it. It's been a, it's been amazing. Absolutely amazing. We're on a four day run here in a, in Toronto and the Greater Toronto area. Uh, we started off down in, uh, I don't even know what the Fuck Hammer Ville Hammerstein I don't know what it is, but the nickname is fucking ham. Hamilton. The nickname is hammertime stop. Hammertime Doo Doo doot doot boop boop. Um, was unbelievable. Great fucking show down there. And then I also found out for a buddy of mine that around the corner was a, with at that unreal team. Canada game was in 1987 when they, uh, when they beat the Russians Gretzky Lemieux right? You guys, were you guys member D of fucking member? Um, I died, let's see, I played a pickup game, a hockey and Ottawa. That was great. Me and verse, he skated on the frozen canal. We held hands and split a beaver tail and whispered sweet nothings into one another's ears.

Speaker 1:          00:04:14       We didn't get a beaver tail, but the rest of it happens. All right, then I stand by it. No, we, uh, we did skate on the canal, man. It's fucking unbelievable. Ottawa. Underrated. Brutally, brutally, brutally fucking underrated. You want to surprise your girlfriend or soon to be wife with a honeymoon. She'll never forget or possibly forgive you for, take her to Ottaway everybody. It's a government town. Did you guys know that Ottawa is the capital of Canada? I didn't know that. It's one of those towns. Everybody's got the big government job and right around five everybody takes off and even the Starbucks closes. But if you go across the fucking river is a bunch of places to get yourself a beer. It was a little a rink out here. I Dunno, it's guys I got, I have absolutely nothing. Um, I'm too old to be on tour this long.

Speaker 1:          00:05:10       And uh, today's the halfway point. So I got another 10 days and I'm out of the 10 days to go on this. Last night I was at our Massey Hall. For those of you who, um, never heard of it. Um, if you favorite band has ever played a show there, it's worth taking a trip. Unbelievable. Second I walked out there, I was saying diversity like Jesus Christ. I'd love to take a special here. But then I heard, um, I heard their fees as through the fucking roof. Of course. You know, like I'm the only asshole that walked in there and said, you know what, I said, this will look visually look really good on Cuba. Um, but uh, yeah, it was definitely a very humbling to be on that thing because I kind of looked up some of the history before I got out there and evidently one night, miles Davis, Charlie Parker, Charles Mingus and fucking Max Roach put on arguably one of the greatest concerts of all time.

Speaker 1:          00:06:06       Louie Armstrong played there. I'm not a big rush fan, but I guess that uh, all the world's a stage they filmed there are recorded there. Neil young recorded some stuff there and then old Billy red face came in and did he shit and Dick Jokes. I had some guy after the show told me that he saw George Carlin performed there in the 80s. So it was definitely, uh, it was pretty awesome to become a, I don't know, part of that history there. Uh, I'm definitely fucking coming back. So here's the deal. So at the end of the show, you know, versus he wants to go see that fucking movie where somebody is getting murdered on a plane every 10 minutes. And for some reason they can't figure out who the fuck's doing it. Okay. And I'm sitting here having this argument with first he's going to, I'm not going to go see that shit.

Speaker 1:          00:06:52       And he's like, he's like, dude, it's fucking Liam Neeson, Liam Neeson Nizam, whatever the fuck you say his name. And I'm like, I liked that guy. Okay. But snakes on a plane is snakes on a plane, even if there's no snakes on the plane. You know what I mean? It is what it is. It's fucking still good. And I know somebody going to shoot a gun on the plane, you know? And somehow, even if he misses it, I dunno, just, it's fucking dumb. It's just dumb. As back in the day when they had a smoking section on an airplane, you remember dice Clay's bed, you're in a fucking tube. It's the same thing. If you're talking about smoking or you're talking about a fucking murder mystery. How many God damn people could you fucking kill on a plane. And you know, somehow the fucking guys going to be able to climb down into the luggage area.

Speaker 1:          00:07:51       It's gonna pull up some carpet and there'll be a trap door there. I must have flown on 9,000 fucking planes in my life. Can somebody please tell me where that fucking trap door is? It doesn't exist. It's a separate fucking compartment. It has to be. And even if it isn't after nine 11 I'm sure they fucking welded it shut, right? They always show that movie. Somebody goes down to visit their fucking dog, right? And then there's some sweaty Middle Eastern look and guy down there. That's what they have now. Back in the day, it was some sweaty Russian looking guy. It's whoever the fuck were at odds with any, they're always sweaty and they need a shave and that down there. And they have absolutely, you know, and they have absolutely no fucking morals whatsoever. And they're always down there in the fucking luggage. Right? And then he got the John McClane guy. How many fucking guys have been on the fucking plane? John McClain did one. Then he, Bruce Willis has been on the plane. Wesley snipes has been on the always bet on black mother fucker, right? You thought that one was the last one. He comes, oh, Liam Neeson.

Speaker 3:          00:09:02       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:09:03       You know something? Fuck air fucked movies on airplanes.

Speaker 3:          00:09:08       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:09:09       Fuck all of them. They all, you name me one movie that took place on a fucking airplane. That was good. All right. And I will immediately block you on fucking Twitter for actually saying it's a good fucking movie.

Speaker 3:          00:09:23       Okay?

Speaker 1:          00:09:26       You can fucking kill somebody on the plane. But you know what? Pretty much everybody's going to say it. Are you going to do it? Let's just say you had some little fucking heart attack missed like the ice man. Remember the ice man, they made a movie about him. That guy where he would just, he was sitting there talking about all the murders he committed, you know, talking through his clenched jaw. Looks like an old sea captain, but he was a fucking hit man for the mob. He had dismissed. He said he'd go into studio 54 and he'd act those swishy and he'd walk up to a guy, hit on him, and then he'd spray him with this miss. And like three seconds later the guy would have a heart attack. Let's just say you had the fucking iceman cometh fucking heart attack missed.

Speaker 3:          00:10:13       All right, now

Speaker 1:          00:10:18       you're in a row of three people. Where do you think the best places to sit? If you want to murder one of the other two people in your row? I'm guessing the middle seat. Okay. If I have to put this air quote caper together and you'd take the fucking missed and I'm going to fucking, I want to give the guy on the window a heart attack. I'm going to spray it in him and that fucking guy is going to go into cardiac arrest. All right, and do you think the guy sitting to the right of me or the fucking lady to the right of me in the aisle seat is not going to notice this person convulsing? All right, well let's just say they fucking drop dead. It's so powerful. They just dropped dead. And just happen to slump to the fucking side. Now I might be able to get away with that.

Speaker 3:          00:11:11       All right?

Speaker 1:          00:11:12       But only if that person had already had an already recline this seat.

Speaker 3:          00:11:17       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:11:19       Hadn't already reclined their fucking seat because when we go, you know, we begin our initial descent, the fucking stewardist or the male stewardess is going to fucking come over and be like, excuse me sir, sir. Excuse me. Could you wake him now I can't wake him cause I fucking sprayed him with a heart attack. Missed. What I can do is press the button forum and put his fucking deadhead between his fucking rigor mortis legs. If you'd like Peter. Otherwise name is Peter. All right, now you killed one person. What the fuck you, you're going to just start going around killing people. One person is going to die every 10 minutes unless I get a sack of cash in Rhinelander Wisconsin to buy fucking two 30 you think the airline would give a fuck?

Speaker 3:          00:12:07       All right.

Speaker 1:          00:12:09       $250 million ransom. Is that what the fuck you want? I mean, how much is it going to cost them to settle out of court? It's going to cost less than that because they have all the money, right? I don't like fucking movies on airplanes and I don't like movies where people have pointed ears and nobody fucking addresses it. The other day I'm sitting there with Verdesian, we're flipping through the fucking stations and one of those hobbit movies comes on and this fucking asshole, he's got one of those, let it be seventies haircuts, whereas hair is plenty long enough to not show his fucking pointed ears, but for some reason he's got it scooped around the back of his ear like he's gonna fucking blow somebody. And I just look at, I go, look at that dude's fucking ear. How does the guy with the white beard not address that? Like what the fuck happened here? What are you?

Speaker 3:          00:12:59       Huh?

Speaker 1:          00:13:00       You're fucking Elf. What does that mean? What do you, what do you, what does your diet consist of? Salary and Guinea pigs. You fucking Weirdo. Get the fuck Outta here.

Speaker 3:          00:13:12       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:13:12       Is that, is that racist? Am I going to have to apologize? The elves,

Speaker 1:          00:13:18       Jesus Christ. Fucking God damn moves with airplanes. You know what I mean? Please, right? Oh please, I don't have time for that sweetheart.

Speaker 1:          00:17:12       You know, and this, and they, yeah, we flew all the way in, but blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. And you know, we're going to hang out here in Toronto, Yada, Yada, Yada. And I said, wait a minute, I go, could I do a show in Kuwait? And they're like, absolutely. And I said, I can say

Speaker 1:          00:17:29       what I said here tonight and Kuwait and the guy goes, yeah. And then the woman goes, well, but I'm just meeting those two. I want to go there. You know, they were some cosmopolitan motherfuckers. I really would like to, to the Middle East and not get kidnapped. If you're in the Middle East and you know, wear a fucking freckled white boy from the u s can go, you know, I would like to, I want that middle ground. I want to go to a place where I'm not going to get abducted by people who fucking hate my government. And I also want to, I don't want to go to a place that's subsists because there's a tent city right outside the city limits and people are living a, you know, on dog food, you got a middle ground that I can go to, you know, or I can do some fucking shows out there.

Speaker 1:          00:18:22       I can tell my jokes and I don't have to worry about the Shah or the fucking prime minister. Oh, the fucking son of the king of the Rab are going to come in and take me away. I don't want that to happen. I'd like to go over there. Right. I want to go on where, on one of those coolest fucking things on my head with the little, uh, oh Robic Bandana. I do that. I do that in a fucking second. Looking like a cornerback at the end of the game with my fucking Doo rag on. Let me know. I'll go over there. I'll fucking doe it. Um, oh hey, there's a rumor. I heard a rumor. Jesus Christ. Who was that? Who Sang that fucking shock wasn't Spandau Ballet. I heard a rumor. There was a z in it. I'm calling that there was a z in their name. For some reason it was like three fucking chicks and they will all almost good looking. You know what I'm talking about? Um, I heard a rumor. Lyrics.

Speaker 2:          00:19:31       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:19:32       Banana Rama. You motherfucker. Why didn't I think there was a z in it?

Speaker 2:          00:19:38       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:19:38       Well, you know what? The fact that there wasn't a it and the fact that I look the way I do and I actually said that they were only kind of good looking as punishment. I now have to go to lyrics dot come and sing as much as this is, I can remember. I don't remember him. Who needs a friend who never shows? I'll tell you what you want to know. I could have saved a broken heart.

Speaker 2:          00:20:07       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:20:08       If I found out long ago, I don't remember. I was, I heard a rumor who, Ooh, I've heard of roof that's actually written on it. Paper. I heard a rumor. Oh h. O. O. H. Ooh, I heard a rumor. They say you got it broken. Then they know what now you guys are getting punished. This isn't, this isn't a punishment. You guys know I like this thing even though I can't do, you know some current wrote me one time I was telling me how much I suck at singing. Like I don't realize that like that isn't the joke, but you know something. For those of you people who are about to them on any sort of, uh, uh, a, uh, a dream and it involves you having a website or a Twitter account, Facebook or anything, uh, anywhere where people can give you feedback. Just know that people will find fucking something to bitch about. Do you know what somebody said? Somebody sent me a fucking email or a Twitter thing. I can't remember what it might have been the most nit picky thing anybody's ever said.

Speaker 3:          00:21:12       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:21:12       When I was down in, uh, Hammer Ville there Hammerstein why can't I remember the fucking name Hamilton when I was down there?

Speaker 1:          00:21:25       You know, at wire to wire had a fucking great show. Go Fuck Yourself. I killed it. Thank you for coming out. I went out, I fucking took pictures with people. I'm selling what's left of my DVDs the last time I'm selling a DVD because it's one step ahead of the fucking laser disk. I got to get him out of my garage. Thank you to everybody who bought one. Um, somebody actually said, great show, but Jesus Christ, your wallet is way too big. Can you fucking believe that out of fuck did you even see it? I maybe have my back to the crowd for fucking two minutes in an hour and 15 minutes set. And it bothered you out big. My fucking wallet was, it's not my fault. It's stuffed with fucking business cats. People give them to me when I'm on tour. Hey, if you're ever a hair fucking, this is this thing. If you'd ever like some of this, here's this thing. I just stuffed them in my wallet and then when I come home I stick them with all the other business cards that I'm never going to look at. Okay. And when you're in the middle of a 20 day toy, yeah. Can get a little bit big. All right. Why don't you stop staring at my fucking ass? You weirdo. The middle of my show.

Speaker 1:          00:22:43       You ever think maybe that it's, it's, it's so fat because it's stuffed with the plastic money that I've made up here. Do you know Canadian currency? Is, is uh, the greenbacks that dollars are they made out of plastic now? Very smooth plastic and I fucking love it. Their money is the shit. I've always loved American money the best because that's the money that I grew up with and I just think it looks cool. And I like all the weird shit that don't with it, with the extra big fucking heads. They got a little off to the side, little nod to hip hop, you know, don't wear your hat like Donnie baseball anymore. You got to do fucking the Jay z thing or it's off to the side just a little bit, you know?

Speaker 3:          00:23:28       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:23:30       What am I going to say? What the fuck am I talking about yet? But the only thing that stinks about their money as I guess you can't stack it, there's something about it because it's plastic. It just sort of slides down to the side. But uh, but anyways, that was the nitpick bitch or the week. Evidently my wallet was too big, you know, I really liked that standup comedians act a was really funny, but I got to tell you the size of his bill fold just really ruined it for me. You know what sir or ma'am, whoever the fuck wrote me that I got to tell you, you have, you have a future as a critic. You really do. Because even when critics like something, they find something to fucking complain about. You know, even if they like your show, like my show, even a good review, if you read it, it would be like the big headed freckled fuck took command of the stage for an amazing performance of stand up as I watched his distractingly alabaster hands motion through brilliant bit after that. That's what they do. They're complimenting you while on salting the shit out of how the fuck you look. You know, I don't like when they do that, it'll kill you don't want to criticize critics is another thing I don't like. I don't like when fucking critics do that or they writing an article on a celebrity and they do that thing where they fucking, uh,

Speaker 1:          00:24:57       they, they always get to talk about what the fuck they're reading. Cause I guess they always an interview these movie stars and uh, in restaurants and they always get as shit, say as he fucking bites into a pan seared salmon and crusted pork chop and older and wiser little fella from the fucking angry king show there on HBO with this tailored fucking suit. Okay. I Dunno. He has a sadness in his eyes as he bites into a cherry tomato. I've really fucking hate that. I just feel like they just did just build it up. They're just like, how many fucking words? So I got to write about this little fella here. Ah, would that dumb fucking look on his face. I'm really sick of that fucking,

Speaker 1:          00:25:54       I'm just sick of the look on that guy's fucking face. It's, it's, I don't know what it is. It's bad enough when a regular size guy has that look on his face, like he's going to come over there and slap the taste. Study your mouth. Okay. I don't need some little fella sitting there with his little suit staring at me. Like I said something about him. I didn't say anything about you. Okay. So, you know, why don't you get your fucking for Bra and pointing in another direction and fuck you and your cherry tomatoes. What do you think about that? Huh?

Speaker 3:          00:26:25       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:26:26       Again, out of my face before I tip you over.

Speaker 3:          00:26:35       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:26:36       I'm sorry. I really am in a country moote and this APP has nothing to do with the little fellow on the angry king show on Hbo. It really has to do with the fact that, uh, I missed my wife and my dog. I missed my truck, a mess, all of that shit while simultaneously having one of the greatest fucking tours I've ever had been. Versie I haven't so much fucking fun up here verse. He started doing this fucking Rodney Dangerfield impression. So that's all we've been doing up here. All we've been doing up here is it will just be sitting there.

Speaker 3:          00:27:11       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:27:11       You know, drinking a beer and you just go, you know, hey, this is a good beer. No, I'll tell you, last week I had a rough one and I don't know why. It's always, it's just been funny the whole fucking week to us. I've skated almost every God damn day. These fucking, you know what's great about Canada because this so far north, they have to embrace the winter and there's just shit to do. They got like, I like looked up free public skating here in Toronto and you would've thought I looked up a Starbucks, the amount of fucking hits I got on my phone, it's just fucking tremendous. So you know, there's only so long then I can go on a God damn treadmill.

Speaker 3:          00:27:55       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:27:56       You know, and with it just because you have the option of just stepping off the fucking thing. That's why I love my dog. I love taking her on a hike, going on a fucking hike, you know, listen to some songs and I, and I'm good boy, you're out here and you fucking go out and you just go skating. It's fun. So fucking good time. Oh, you know what I did? I got a friend of mine that lives up here and he's an assistant coach on a, on a hockey team. He's got a son in the 10 to 11 year old group. And I went to this rink, they had four ranks. They're all these different games and I have to fucking tell you something. I've never seen kids of that age play the game the way these kids were playing. They were fucking, it was an unbelievably entertaining game. Was One. Nothing. One, one, two, one, two, two and then three, two and then they pulled the, they got the dagger, got the fourth goal and these fucking kids up here.

Speaker 3:          00:28:51       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:28:52       At Age 10 to 11 the level with which they would play in this game. It wasn't even the, the kid with the Puck, it was what the kids were doing away from the park. How they knew where to be.

Speaker 1:          00:29:04       There was a fucking kid on the other team. Last name, kid number four or something. I was like jealous how well he could skate backwards. This kid was like 10 or 11 years old and the way you play defense, I was actually watching him learning. It was like, I dunno, it was like an NHL gay, but everybody was 10 or 11 like the way it was played. Obviously, it wasn't as fast, but you know, when I was watching it live, I mean I couldn't really tell. I was fucking blown away by the talent up here. Um, and it was a great game and when it was three to two because the other team kept tying it up, I was actually on the of my seat

Speaker 4:          00:29:42       watching a game between 10 and 11 year olds. I mean, it's fucking amazing up here. So, um, anyways, I did that. How far into the fucking podcast, Dan? My Art, Jesus, I'm limping along this week. 29 minutes in.

Speaker 3:          00:29:59       Yeah.

Speaker 4:          00:29:59       You don't have been doing with Versie this week. This is fucking, I've, I've toured with Versie for so fucking long. We're like an old married couple. I've never seen anybody who hates the morning as much as he does. So this whole fucking tour, I've never woken him up with a text cause I always do that shit. I'll text them, hey, you want to get breakfast? And he's never quite awake. So I just, I just wait till he fucking wakes up and that, that fucking guy, if you don't text him, he will, he'll sleep til like one in the afternoon and he has still has the nerve to come downstairs, look at a little groggy. He always comes down like, God, how great. How great was that mattress man? Fucking epic at mattress was epic. Everything's epic to him. Um, I dunno. So, uh, that's why I'm doing the podcast with dot. I'm next week we'll, we'll wrap up the tour. We will wrap up the tour. Uh, me and him will do the, uh, the podcast together. Um, but um, oh, I got to do another word. I heard a rumor allegedly.

Speaker 3:          00:31:01       Okay.

Speaker 4:          00:31:01       They are, our dates in the works with three of my best friends in comedy. Quite possibly. I've heard rumors that they might be doing a tour, a club tour.

Speaker 3:          00:31:14       Okay.

Speaker 4:          00:31:15       That now maybe starting out on the west coast, possibly. Maybe starting in La, possibly with yours truly hosting the show. I've heard this fucking Romer that possibly Rosebowl tailgate legends. Jason Lawhead. Joe Barton. Nick.

Speaker 3:          00:31:36       Okay.

Speaker 4:          00:31:36       All right. And Dude, I called it Paul Versey quite possibly could be doing a three man tour of clubs, limited engagements

Speaker 4:          00:31:47       over the next couple of months, sponsored by the Monday morning podcast, the first tour. I hope the first of many tours to be sponsored by this podcast. Um, there are rumors that there are agents right now working on over the weekend suit on, tie off, wiping their brow, trying to put together some dates on this tour. Uh, quite possibly next week there might even be an announcement, but right now that is just a rumor, but I'll tell you what isn't a rumor. A, I'm doing a date in Nashville on May 16th and it's part of a Vince Vaughn's wild west tour comedy tour. And uh, let's see here. I just fucking tweeted about it. Jesus. Bill, what the fuck is wrong with you? Hang on, hang on, hang on you to home. No, I got to me right? Yeah, the wild west comedy festival, Wild West Comedy festival.com is the website tickets are on sale now. Um, if you follow me on Twitter, I have there, I have their Twitter handle. Is that what you say at wild west C F as in comedy festival and on Facebook it's facebook.com backslash WWC f Nashville as in wild west comedy festival.

Speaker 3:          00:33:14       Uh, Nashville. Um,

Speaker 4:          00:33:18       anyhow. All right. So that's enough for the goddamn promotions for the week.

Speaker 3:          00:33:22       Yeah.

Speaker 4:          00:33:22       Um, all right. Just when you think my singing

Speaker 1:          00:33:25       can't get any worse, how about I try to top that with sound? You do you think I can sound more dumb than, than the level of my awful singing while I think I can, uh, I've been sort of keeping up on this, this, the events that are going on over in the Ukraine and, uh, with my limited knowledge of what's going on there now and my limited knowledge of what's happened there in the past. Um,

Speaker 3:          00:33:52       okay.

Speaker 4:          00:33:52       That ousted fucking president or prime minister or whatever they call them.

Speaker 3:          00:33:57       Okay.

Speaker 4:          00:33:58       Yannick Covich, that guy's a sellout cunt. All right. And I'm not trying to stir up some shit over there. Okay. But after what style and did there and World War II, they should want nothing to do with Russia. Okay.

Speaker 3:          00:34:15       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:34:16       The fact that there's Russian sympathizers in the Ukraine. I don't fucking get it.

Speaker 3:          00:34:22       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:34:22       Why does o Vladimir give a fuck about this? Yana Covich so much. I actually looked up, Yana Covich Russian puppet and I got a bunch of hits, so,

Speaker 3:          00:34:34       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:34:35       What gets you let the Ukrainians have their own goddamn country? They didn't like you so much that they actually overthrew you. There's so much dirty shit going on over there. I think Vladimir Putin or whatever the fuck his name is. He said that, uh, that, that that was actually,

Speaker 3:          00:34:53       yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:34:54       by the u s whether it be hilarious if we actually back that if we back that they overthrew their fucking prime minister, whatever the fuck his name is. Yanna Covich Anna Kournikova, whatever his fucking name is. Right. And then we get to go publicly. It'd be like, Hey, what are you guys doing in Russia? Leave him alone. Saad modeling in their affairs.

Speaker 3:          00:35:18       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:35:18       If we actually did do it, I have to respect all Vladi Vladi daddy there that he fucking said. Uh, he called us out on it. I think he called us out on, I remember he called somebody else out on it. I would fuck knows, God knows we, you know, you know we did something over there. Hey, let me tell you, it was a rough week over there and create, um,

Speaker 2:          00:35:39       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:35:40       I Dunno, just fucking leave him alone. Can't countries just leave other countries alone? But you know, I think that'd be great for this country if we just fucking pulled all our people back. We just left everybody alone and you know what all our corporations had to come back to and we started making Levi's 501 blues again. The button flies, some z Cavariccis and we actually made them here. We didn't make children's sewn together. You know, why can't we do that again? And then you just legalize weed everywhere and then you use that as the export. And we got everybody fucking high man and everybody mellows out. Why can't we do that? You know why?

Speaker 1:          00:36:21       Because everybody heard. So the reason why you can't do it is because it's the same reason why the fucking NFL has that stupid ass fucking dumb ass game in England every year. All right? It's because of the ego. You want to put your stamp, you want to put your fucking mark on something. You want to say that it was here and then I took it to here. You know, no one could just be like, hey, we're right here and isn't this a good place to be? He always got, what about me? What about my fucking legacy? And that's what, that's what the fuck. And the guy from the NFL is doing. All right, Pete Roselle is the benchmark. You got to somehow try to outdo him. We went Pete Roselle and then Peter Noone I think was the next fucking commissioner. And then you got this guy, uh, was it Raykovich Roger Goodell. I don't want the fucking guy. He's name is bought out, but he's got a somehow outdo Pete Rozelle. Pete Rozelle brought the AFL and the NFL together Monday night football, the super bowl. So the only way to top that is you somehow after to try and go fucking global. So he has that stupid ass dumb ass fucking game in England. Every God damn year for what? Can't you just be happy being billionaires are multimillion. I would say that about everything. I would say that about the fucking Nhl. Why can't you just be multimillionaires? Isn't that enough?

Speaker 1:          00:37:52       Why do you got to have the Florida Panthers? Okay. And you know what? Fuck you. If you live in Miami, fuck you. Okay? Fuck you. You got all that exotic pussy down there. You also have to have a fucking NHL team. Go Fuck Yourself, okay? You want to go to a hockey game? You get and you goddamn VW bus and you drive to a cold city. All right? I for one, have had enough of these fucking winter teams down in the fucking south. All right? Having a winter classic game when a classic game at Dodger Stadium, people sit there and fucking tank tops watch an ice hockey outside. All right? Now, I don't want get all hippy on you here, but how many porpoises had to fucking die so they can fucking have enough God damn water to make that whole thing happened. You know a lot of people don't realize that ice is actually made out of salt water. Okay. And salt water is the living, breathing oxygen. That poor processive inhales through its fucking gills. Alright, don't porpoise. A porpoise is a mammoth. Are they? And I realized that this oxygen and water before you guys actually take that shit seriously to porpoises breathe through a porthole, an orifice at the top of their head.

Speaker 2:          00:39:12       Okay,

Speaker 1:          00:39:13       I can look this up now. That's how you spell porpoise. Poor poise.

Speaker 2:          00:39:20       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:39:21       Is it a mammal? I spelt mammo with three m's in the middle. Did you mean mammal course? I met Mammal Porpoise, mammal. Any of the seven species of tooth whales distinguishable from dolphins by their row by they're more compact build, generally smaller in size, maximum length about two meters. That's about 6.6 feet they say and curved blunt snouts. What's spatulate rather than conical teeth. It was a great word. Bachelor late. And Conoco, I want you guys to you, next time you get fucking hammered, I want you to slip both of those words in and if you can actually use them,

Speaker 1:          00:40:06       it's a great line to say to a woman, you know, I like you. I saw you from across the bar. You know what really attracted me? And she'd be like, what? And you'd be like, you're blunt. Snap with your spatulate rather than conical teeth. What would you like to drink, sweetheart? Blunt snout. That's a fucking good name for a band. Maybe Jeremy Brown show. Um, all right, let's, let's get to some of the fucking questions this week. I'm sorry, I, I'm just really shitting the bed here. Um, did I talk about everything? I think I did. Oh, people talking about the posters where my posters relaxed. They're all on their way. Uh, we still got another, there's still some more coming up this week. Overwhelming response. And I got, I got one guy in the mail room trying to send all of these fuckers out, so, uh, you'll get them all right. And they are autographed. So relax. Okay. And if you don't get them, I'll give you fucking money back. But I'm saying don't give up hope. All right. Hang in there. Hang in there. Stay gold. Pony boy. Stay gold. All right. Baseball season. Billy Ruth. I grew up loving the game of baseball. My greatest memories. Hang on a second. I got fucking close this window. There's some dose talking

Speaker 1:          00:41:24       fucking muted. All right. Hang on. All right. I grew up loving the game of baseball. My greatest memories as a child included the smell of a Mitt and sensation of throwing a ball hard across an infield. I also grew up in an Orioles fan. I'd fucking, Oreos were great when I grew up and I was growing up. They were the shit. They were already. They won in [inaudible] 66 and they want in 70. Uh, they blew it and 79 and then they won in [inaudible] 83. Look at that right off the top of my fucking head. But I can't read out loud. Do you know I can do that? And almost every sport. I can go back to like the 60s and I could tell you all the fucking champions. 66 the oriel 67 uh, the cardinal speed, the fucking red sox, 68 the tigers want, and then they, then they were having that fucking thing while that, those riots and then the, the, the, the subsequent white flight that happened and that cities never recovered.

Speaker 1:          00:42:20       69 the amazing mets, 73 oral 71 I think was the pirates. And then Clemente died or the die. And (727) 027-0370 four was the A's. 75, 76 was the red. 77, 78 was the Yankees. 79 was we are family. The pirates, 80 Phillies, 81 was the fucking dodges, right. Tommy John, Tommy, John was on the fucking Dodgers that lost to the Yankees. And 77, 78 a one, he turned codes, he goes to the fucking Yankees. And what happens? The Dodgers win. And that's why that surgery's named after him. 82 was the cardinals. A, they'd beat the brewers. 83 was the Orioles. 84 was the tigers. 85 was the royals. It should have been the fucking cardinals of the implode. F that awful call at first base 86 was the mets. Red Sox fans know that 87 was the twins. 88 was fucking Kirk Gibson, the Dodgers. I can just keep going.

Speaker 1:          00:43:29       People. I could fucking go all fucking day long. I know what you thinking. You probably think I have in front of them right in front of me. Well, that's just a compliment. 89 was the aids. The roid brothers want it. Then 90 was the red. 91 of course was you twins. 92 93 that was zero. You're fucking Blue Jays and the 94 that's a great trivia year. That was the strike here and if you listen to fucking Pedro Martinez, he'll sit there and tell you, you know what, the fucking expos we're going to win that year. Why you ask? Because they had a young, him and Randy Johnson, I think Tim Raines was still there and a whole fucking great team there. 95 was the Braves. 96 was the Yankees. 97 was the Marlin's. They'd be j law heads, Indians. 98 99 2000 was the fucking Yankees. This is when he starts getting sketchy for me. 2001 was the Diamondbacks. 2002 I think was the angels. 2003 was the Marlin's. 2004 was a red sox. 2005 was the white sox. 2006 was the fucking cardinals. Was it 2007 was the red sox. 2008 was affiliate cause I was a 988 keys. 2010 was the Jane's then, I don't fucking know.

Speaker 1:          00:44:42       2011 all right. 2013 was us. The giants won another one in there. Didn't they will say 2012 and I'll say 2011 was the cardinals. Oh my God. If you don't like sports, you're in trouble now. Well, let's go do football. I could do it. I can do hockey if you want. I can go all the way back to about 1966 I believe. All right. Canadian Maple leafs, Canadians, Canadians, Bruins, Canadians, Rowan's Canadians, flyers, flyers, Canadians, Canadians, Canadians, Canadians, islanders, islanders, islanders, islanders, fucking Edmonton, Edmonton. Canadians, Edmonton, Edmonton, Calgary, Edmonton

Speaker 1:          00:45:35       91 92 was at Pittsburgh. 93 was fucking Montreal. 94 was the rangers. 95 was a devils. 96 was the avalanche. 97 98 was it fucking [inaudible] 99 was Dallas stars. Why are you guys listening to this? 2000 was the fucking avalanche. No. Was it devils 2001 report. Avalanche thousand two fucking Devil's 2003 if I can read links, maybe lightning strike ducks. Hurricanes. All right, sorry, I'm back. Let's read this thing here. Um, I also grew up in an Orioles fan too. That was fucking add textbook right there. I love the oriels and I love Major League baseball, but why can't I get the baseball, get into the baseball season? It has nothing to do with my team. Oh, I read that wrong. But why can't I get into the baseball season? It has nothing to do with my team. I was happy for the socks, but it's just hard to get excited about the sport and I desperately want to. Is there a greater reason I'm missing?

Speaker 1:          00:46:50       Uh, well, I mean, it kind of sucks that there's no salary cap and that, you know, the red sox can afford to spend a buck 80 a year and the fucking Yankee you spend like two 20 a year. Um, so I mean, essentially between the two of them sang on a second. I mean, one of us is going to win the fucking division probably 80% of the time. I mean, if you go back to 1996 the first time the Yankees won the division. All right. And that wasn't because they spent money. That was because George Steinbrenner gets suspended and he wasn't allowed to fucking metal. And He, I swear to God he wouldn't, he wouldn't trade it away. Jeter.

Speaker 5:          00:47:38       MMM,

Speaker 1:          00:47:40       definitely. What a terrier way. Bernie Williams, probably Jorge Posada and I bet even Marianna Rivera, just because nobody knew he hadn't developed that cut fastball yet. No, he probably, he probably keep like to have them pick two of them. He definitely get rid of Andy Pettitte. He fucking was up that guy's ass even when he was crushing it.

Speaker 5:          00:47:59       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:48:01       But anyways, I dunno, somewhere around 98 99 it's just, it's just become like ridiculously all about money. And I would say from there on, if the red sox didn't win at the Yankees, wanted to maybe Tampa Bay when it one year, I can tell you right now, the Orioles have in fucking one. It's since, I dunno when the 80s maybe early nineties I have no fucking idea. I would say that that's kind of what makes it suck.

Speaker 5:          00:48:31       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:48:33       I don't understand why all leagues aren't run like the bike, NFL football where Green Bay Wisconsin can compete with New York City. It's great. It's a great thing. So I would say that maybe that's why you can't get into the regular seasons because a lot of times by June, what's the fucking point?

Speaker 5:          00:48:54       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:48:56       And the great thing about the Orioles, I mean, you guys had said that, that great tradition there.

Speaker 5:          00:49:02       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:49:03       You know, when in three world series, essentially my lifetime, I was born in 68 so I don't remember 66 or 70, but I remember 83 and I just remember he had all those great pictures when I was growing up. Frank Tenana, Jim Palmer.

Speaker 5:          00:49:17       MMM Nah,

Speaker 1:          00:49:19       fuck. There was another one that you guys always had the, had like three number ones and you're starting rotation. You guys were brutal. Eddie Murray at first base fucking, I don't, can't remember the other names. Who the fuck knows? But it was great. It was great to watch it catch. It was hilarious. Why do I think it's Doug to Sensei wasn't any play third base for the fucking angels. Um, that's probably why he can't get into it. You probably can't get into it because it's not a level playing field. It's a,

Speaker 1:          00:49:50       um, I dunno, I dunno what to tell you. Sorry. Just sort of fucking space to halfway through that. All right. Childhood crush us. Billy Suave. Uh, when you were growing up in the late seventies, what celebrity ass would you have banged if you had the choice? Well, I mean, I was fucking like six years old. So was I, I was, I supposed to take out my little Schmeichel is the Jewish people say, um, I don't know what I would've done with it. I'm a Charlie's angel or perhaps Stevie Nicks. Who are you into? And was there someone that everyone was into that you couldn't, why? Um, Oh man, I fucking, I loved everybody. I loved all three Charlie's angels. I probably liked Farrah Fawcett. She's the one I wanted to bang. Kate Jackson was the one I wanted to marry. And, uh, I liked, I liked Kate Jackson when she was on the rookie sneeze. She's a fucking nurse. She was married to Mike Danco. What a fucking name, Huh? Mike Danco. She had that great voice. Ah, man. She was beautiful. And, uh, you know, Jacqueline Smith, Matt Jaclyn Smith, she had the same haircut is fair fosters, except it was a Brunette. I've always liked brunettes. Um, so I liked all of them.

Speaker 2:          00:51:08       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:51:08       And then I liked Kristy McNichol much to her chagrin. Uh, who else?

Speaker 2:          00:51:17       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:51:17       I fucking like the mall. Trying to think of another show I used to watch.

Speaker 2:          00:51:22       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:51:22       I like Marsha Brady. You know, when she got a little bit older and was wearing those fucking mini skirts, um, even Jan a couple episodes, she hoarded up pretty good for a young May. I liked that. Um,

Speaker 2:          00:51:37       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:51:37       Joanie, from happy days when she got older, you know, was taken a few from Scott bail. I liked her then.

Speaker 2:          00:51:46       Okay,

Speaker 1:          00:51:47       let's see. Welcome back Kotter. And that was a bunch of don'ts except for his wife. I wasn't into her though.

Speaker 2:          00:51:54       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:51:54       Uh, what else? Boat bad. Dope. Do, what else did I used to watch? Welcome Bay. This is when, you know, you watched it a lot when you could actually sing the second verse. Yeah. Always could spot of friend, but Pampa Bull. Welcome back to that southern and dissolve them. Better. Bad at blue. All right. I only could sing the first fucking line. Um,

Speaker 2:          00:52:21       okay.

Speaker 5:          00:52:22       Was that it?

Speaker 1:          00:52:24       I think that was it. I had a very sheltered childhood. There was only like three channels.

Speaker 5:          00:52:30       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:52:32       That wasn't a big radio guy. I was too fucking young. Like I only reason why I knew about kiss was a couple of my friends had older brothers and one of my friends is really good at drawing and he would drum, you know, all the kiss characters and I had no fucking idea. My parents didn't take me to see star wars had no fucking idea, so I had no crush on prince slayer. I remember that Shit. That shit came out over the summer and I didn't even hear about it. I went outside, I played baseball every fucking day. I went down to the pool and I went swimming. No, we weren't even members of the pool at that point. They had like a community pool slash piss tank that we will lose our members of. Yeah. I just went outside and I played every day, go outside and play, went out. We rode bikes and played baseball. We did what kids did back then and that's why we weren't fat kids. We fucking went outside there. You, I would say, yeah, the Charlie's angels. I wasn't into to the bionic woman.

Speaker 2:          00:53:31       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:53:32       I didn't get into her. God Damn it. I thought there was way more than that.

Speaker 2:          00:53:39       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:53:40       I know there was, I just can't remember anymore. Um, but was there anybody who everybody was into and I couldn't understand it? Uh, no. No I couldn't.

Speaker 2:          00:53:50       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:53:51       I thought they were all fucking beautiful. I really did. Fucking women in the late seventies. They will fucking go Cheryl Tiegs

Speaker 1:          00:54:01       I don't fucking remember. They were all gorgeous. I remember every magazine cover. It was a woman on the cover. Even I was a little kid. You had a crush on her. Um, childhood crushes. Right. I just read that one. A instruments bill. I'm 14 years old. I suspect I'm one of your younger listeners. I'm growing to learn how to play a new inch. Oh, I'm going to learn how to play a new instrument this year. I already played piano and love the progressive nature of drums, but I also want to be able to shred a solo. Any suggestions to which would be better to start? Definitely stick with piano.

Speaker 2:          00:54:36       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:54:36       All right. There they have more fucking piano sitting around than anything else. Okay. So your whole life, if you can just sit down and just start playing a piano, women will come over to your piano. All right. Like flies to a few moths to a light. That's a great one to learn how to play. So definitely don't even Tommy Lee said, I wish I stuck with it.

Speaker 5:          00:55:00       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:55:01       You got to stick with the piano. Uh, um, uh, obviously prejudice to drums, drums of this shit. Um, but if you don't shred a Solo,

Speaker 5:          00:55:13       I dunno,

Speaker 1:          00:55:15       you know what, maybe guitar, Guitar and drums are great. Those are both Badass instruments. And Piano I said is this very social thing your whole life, you'll be able to sit down, all right. Attract women. And then when you become married and you become a father, you can sit around playing the piano. Oh, you know, Dad [inaudible] Dad, Sarah pred. Oh my keys playing the piano, gather round children, God and Cupid Donner and bled. Said, you know, you can do your own little jazzy version, but do you Rico? Um, yeah. But either way, I'm good on you for learning an instrument, you know, and not becoming a Dj, even though that's now acknowledged as a a an instrument.

Speaker 2:          00:56:05       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:56:05       You want to be able to actually fucking do it. I don't give a fuck. Those djs are amazing that they can take little sounds and make it into a song, but at the end of the fucking day, you know, they're cutting and splicing.

Speaker 2:          00:56:17       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:56:18       They're more like editing an album while creating, if the same time, which I'm not going to lie you. It's very impressive. All right? But there's nothing cooler than, than actually being able to play the sounds that those miles had. People are fucking sticking together once you agree. Um, yeah. Drums or coolest shit.

Speaker 3:          00:56:37       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:56:38       I don't know what to tell you, but you already play piano, man. So you've got that ear. Yeah. Guitar. I would try. I would try them out, but don't give up playing the piano, man. That's a great one. A great one to play. Unless you're in a heavy metal band and they're all fucking rocking out and you're sitting there with the keyboard. That's a tough one. That was always a tough one. There's always a tough one to try to fucking Headbang when you're behind a behind a fucking keyboard. Oh, we're halfway there, right? Those guys in journey.

Speaker 1:          00:57:08       I'd actually like to learn how to play the piano, you know, but I just have too much sympathy for my wife. I wouldn't do it.

Speaker 1:          00:58:51       Tor. Okay. Boyfriend cheated bill. I'm a 25 year old girl. You are a woman lady. All right. Don't sell yourself short. You're a woman. I found out my boyfriend was cheating on me. The truth is I'm sad, but at the same time I get that we're not meant to be together forever. Um, can you please suggest a fun way for me to break up with him just in a way that makes him feel like he did something wrong, but also feel like less of a man if possible. Love to you and the all right. Um,

Speaker 3:          00:59:26       yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:59:26       All right. Well first of all, you know, you don't seem too broken up about it. It's 25 years old. All right? You're in the prime of your life.

Speaker 3:          00:59:34       MMM,

Speaker 1:          00:59:36       Jen. You're like, wow, we're not going to be together anyway. So this guy broke up. How can you break up with them? Ah, Jesus. You know what? Women are way better at this than I am. Okay. Break up in a way that makes them feel like he did something wrong. Well, I mean, you could just say it. I'm breaking up with you because you cheated on me, you piece of shit, but also make them feel like less of a man. All right, well, you know what? I'm going to put that on you, but don't go the usual hacky ways that women go where they usually say he didn't satisfy me a bed. Do you have a little Dick? You know, I don't go out and go fuck one of his friends because eventually you ready Brett, that that's just another notch on your fucking bed post. Unless you really want to bang one of them.

Speaker 3:          01:00:21       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:00:22       That's a really brutal thing to do. That fucking breaks up their friendship and you don't give a shit. Right.

Speaker 3:          01:00:27       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:00:27       Um, I don't know what to tell you. What could you do? All right, let's see if someone did that to me. Makes you feel like you did something wrong and make what would make me feel like less of a man.

Speaker 3:          01:00:43       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:00:44       Why don't you just break up with them and then I guess you got to go the hacky route and just say, oh, by the way, and then just pointed his dick and just start laughing hysterically. I Dunno. Maybe you'll come off as a psycho that way. Why don't you get him a cake? Oh Jesus. Oh Man. I almost don't want to even tell you to fucking do this. This is brutal. I get it. Is his birthday coming up? If his birthday is coming up, you take them out to a restaurant and yeah. Yeah. Have him bring a cake over or maybe you have your friends to work because I don't think the restaurant, we'll do it and he thinks it's a birthday cake. All right. And it says in frosting.

Speaker 3:          01:01:31       MMM,

Speaker 1:          01:01:32       you cheated on me. You piece of shit. Okay. And then you have your friends if they can sing and they'll just sing the happy birthday song with new lyrics. Why did you cheat on me? You do. Why did you cheat on me? You do. Why did you cheat on me? You do each bag. Why did you cheat on me? And he's got a big fucking candle shape, like a dick. Maybe funny if it's more of a limp Dick. I don't know. Maybe something like that.

Speaker 3:          01:02:12       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:02:13       Hey look, I tried. What do you want from me? Okay. I want to tell you how it was kind of rough. Um, anyway. Ah, fuck. Um, all right. So tonight I am, I want to thank, first of all, I want to thank everybody, uh, who, who's been coming out to my shows, this, this tourism. And I know I sounded kind of crabby and tired today, but, uh, I'm having a great time and as a public rink down the street and I want to go skate around and get the fucking blood going before I drive out to a London, Ontario tonight, I got Montreal next and then I got my day off where we're going to, uh, the Canadians and a Bruins game. And then that's the end of the east coast swing. And then we started our west coast swing, which will be Winnipeg, Edmonton, Calgary, uh, fucking Vancouver. And then that little peninsula out there, whenever the fuck it's called, um, I dunno, whatever. Dude. I'm fucking out of it. I need an, I didn't want to go skating and then I'm gonna take a nap, but I'm going to fucking kill it tonight in London.

Speaker 4:          01:03:24       That is the game plan. I just threw my hat down. Did you hear that? Throw it down. Get myself psyched up for the shoulder night. That's the podcast for this week. Thank you to everybody who's come out to my shows up here. I got to tell you man, don't sleep on Canada and come up here during the winter time. It's fucking great if you'd like to. That's a, that's actually a great way to learn how to enjoy the winter and come to Canada in the winter. You don't actually talk to somebody and they, they, you know, I was saying how, you know, I always wanted

Speaker 1:          01:03:56       the fucking build a rink in my backyard for my kids that I don't have. And um, this guy was like, oh yeah, I did it. You know, they all had these different techniques on how to make the ice perfect and they build these little ass fucking rinks for their kids and then tear him down and reassemble them every fucking year. It's a, they're, they're amazing people, man. Really Fun people up here and great goddamn food. The only thing that I'm going to bitch about is in Toronto was sitting there, we bought these Cuban cigars and there's no fucking place to smoke up standing on a heat lamps like assholes freezing our asses off during to smoke these cigars. Man, there's not one cigar bar and uh,

Speaker 4:          01:04:39       and all of Toronto. And something sad I notice happened up here. I finally went to the El Mocambo last night cause I wanted to have a drink because that's where a Stevie ray Vaughan and double trouble had this great live DVD that they did and I always wanted to go into, it's a great dive. Uh, all these people have played their fucking, you know, the rolling stones did a show there in like 1977. It's a really famous place and I went over there and it's closed. It's actually for sale and people are kind of holding their breath, hoping that someone is going to buy it and refurbish it and keep the legend going. And I took a picture of it, the melancholy look on my face last night and uh, I wish I had a chance to go in there, but I'm hoping that someone's going to buy it and keep it going.

Speaker 4:          01:05:28       Cause I, I, I, that was one that was on my bucket list and I fucking blew it last time I was here. I could have gone in there and I just got too fucking busy. I blew it. Anyways, that's the podcast for this week. Go fuck yourselves. I will talk to you next week. I'll let you know about the rest of the tour and the upcoming possibly Joe Bart, Nick, Jason Law had Paul Versey. It's just a rumor, but what I bring it up, if it wasn't going to be a fact till the next week and find out it was a rough road.
