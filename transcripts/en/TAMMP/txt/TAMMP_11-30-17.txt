Speaker 1:          00:00:44       That's it. All you need to do is get a pair of Jordans, right? Whatever the fuck verse he says in it and that's it. It's over. The greatest fucking feeling ever this holiday is like, you know, when you become an adult, it's dreadful. It's like, Oh fuck man, I gotta you know, I got to bring the kid over here. I gotta fucking get this person something. Oh Jesus, what do I gotta get this guy a calendar or something. I got a show. I got to show him how much I care about is stories that have no fucking point. You know, God at least get him a stocking stuffer for how many minutes of my life did he wastes this year. Just the, the, the, the, the fucking stress of that. Um, I gotta tell you something, buying the things and wrapping him, slapping a name on them and then once you mail that fucking thing, it's like a high, heavy, like runners talk about like runner's high, you know, which is hilarious because if you look at the look on their face when they're running, it does not look like they're enjoying themselves.

Speaker 1:          00:01:41       Every person I've ever seen jogging down the street, like not everyone, but most of them, they look like they should acquit. Like two miles ago they'll lean into one side. They kind of got that fucking stroke mouth going. You're not, they'll fucking one. It's like to have just enough already enough. We get it. We get it. We get it. You're a, you're, you're, you're a fitness fucking group guru. Slowdown. Walk Goldman at a Taco stand. All right. Get yourself a fucking Taco or something. All right. Just relax. Um, who do you hate more joggers of bike riders? Yeah. Who Do you hate more joggers of bike riders? Neither. I like everybody on the poverty of force that balances out your life. Get the hell out of my office.

Speaker 1:          00:02:25       And you crushed on the podcast. Let's see if you've got another one in. You don't hit me. I gotta go. I gotta go to the gym by you're going to the gym. What for all Hollywood? You're trying to get you abs going for 2018 yeah, a beefcake. Alright, bye. Um, oh wait. Oh Jesus. The anticlimactic. Then you've got to come back. Come on. Give me a kiss goodbye. Let me kiss goodbye now. Actually, you know what? Give it to me when a gum, when you come home. All right, I'll see. [inaudible] gross. Oh, I got all the tags. Knee up for the gifts and stuff. Sarah's. Yup. And I try to make your Nia, when I said from uncle bill and Antione, I try to make it look like your handwriting, but it clearly looks like mine. It doesn't need to be. Plus I'm left handed so it's smudge to cross and I forgot to sign your name to the card. The one that said how much we care about them. It's the second time I've done that. You are the worse. There's going to be a lot of Hosta. I didn't do that to you. You No, I'm kidding. Come back please. Um, the fucking shit that women are into. It was just, you know, she got a car. Did sign my name to, what about you? All right.

Speaker 3:          00:03:40       How could you do that? Everybody's getting sick care.

Speaker 1:          00:03:44       No, they're not. They have lives. Um, anyways, I got the shit fucking rap. I got, I got like one more thing to get my laugh and have all of that fucking wrapped. All right. And I just see, hey, you go, alright, here you go. Leave me alone. And then I'm gonna I got, I'm like eloquently come off the wagon. I'm still on the wagon. I got 15 weeks in. All right. I'm already a third of the year in 26 weeks is half a year, but that takes me into February and I'm going to the rose bowl so that, that's the next tough one. That's the next hurdle I have to get past is if I could somehow go to the rose bowl and not get all fucked up, which I've done before. I've done it. I don't think I've done a couple of times. I've done the Rosebowl sober.

Speaker 1:          00:04:31       Um, I don't know what, but, uh, I'm actually, I was thinking the other night, like when I come back to drinking, all right, when we rekindle our relationship, you know, like you have a c, there was a particular person out here in Hollywood, had an abusive relationship. Skye was beating the shit out of her and stuff, and then she went back to him, you know, being like, no, we fixed it this time. And I remember the talk show hosts were like going like, are you sure you know what you're doing? This is me going back to boots. Um, with my little barbed wire tattoo. Um, I think I'm just going to go straight to heroin. Like I for some reason feel like I can handle it at my age, you know, cause I know how stupid it is to do. I would just do it like one time and just be sitting there like right in the living room to just don't, don't have the shame that most junkies have.

Speaker 1:          00:05:22       You just sit down with your family and just say, listen, this is something that I want to try. I'm just going to do it once and I would appreciate it if you guys would hang out during my entire high and make sure that I don't tip over and bust my head open on the coffee table with ava. We have the kid proof things around it. It'd be actually a lot of that kid proof shit becomes junky proof after a while. You know, I'm, I'm kidding. And I'm not making light of the, uh, nationwide heroin epidemic, but we all know that the nationwide heroin epidemic is not the biggest story in the country right now. That's not the biggest story. It's not that they've poisoned our food supply fellow Americans. It's not that. It's not that after all the protests is still going to put that fucking pipeline and it's not that. What is the biggest story? Huh? Matt Lauer buying a fucking Dildo for the stand in weather person. It's not that

Speaker 1:          00:06:21       having a president who's out of his fuck. Nate's not debt. The biggest story in the United States of America right now is Eli Manning is being sat on Sunday and it's 210 game streak is coming to a close and all of New York shut down. They couldn't believe that Alicia Manning, I didn't know his name was Alicia. I have never seen such a fucking ridiculous reaction while ignoring real fucking problems. There's like 30,000 fucking tornadoes or whatever the fuck we had. Hurricanes, Eh, have fuck all that Miami is. Give me on the water, like delay the fucking texts that I got from New York sports fans, my friends, like the level that they were having a fucking meltdown, you know, fuck the roper dope that's going on in the Middle East right now where you got to fucking band a fucking 3,500 nitwits bankrupting a billion dollar company is they got a bag of rocks and we're flying f eighteens, Adam blowing all our cash. Fuck all of that. Eli Manning is being sat on Sunday.

Speaker 1:          00:07:32       I got a buddy money. He flipped out so bad. He's actually betting against the giants. It's like, dude, if Gino sucks, which I don't think he's going to, no one knows how good Geno Smith is. He played on the jets. No one knows how good anybody is when they play for the jets. Did the jets. Sorry everybody out in Queens. But you know there's an element of truth to that. Okay? The patriots used to be like that. All right, so there is hope for you guys. God knows bill Bellacheck is 70 years old and we all saw Tom Brady's try to recover that bad snap the last week. Right. You saw when he was running after that thing, he looked as age. He looked like a guy who forgot to set as parking brake. It was hobbling after his fucking car and then realize like, I'm not going to break my leg. I don't fuck it. I got insurance on this car and it just flopped on the ground. Um, if Geno Smith shits the bed, Eli is going to be back in the second quarter. And by the way, this happens to every quarterback, no matter how good they were, no matter how good of a class act, they weren't. This happens to it. But what the fuck happened to Peyton Manic?

Speaker 2:          00:08:39       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:08:39       After all those years of standing there with at least 19 inches of his 42 inch neck exposed between his helmet and his shoulder pads, it finally fucking gave out. And what did that fucking Guy Jim or say,

Speaker 2:          00:08:54       okay. Ah,

Speaker 1:          00:08:56       the fucking national enquirer of fucking sports owners. He turned his fucking back on him. Okay. It. Peyton Manning, he went to fucking eastern Europe. He went to Transylvania, right? And he got fucking child's blood pumped into his fucking or whatever the hell it virgin blood pumped into his fucking neck. And he comes back to Jim or say it says [inaudible] [inaudible] right. Whatever. That whenever the fuck he talks, why don't you put me in this week? Whatever the fuck he said to them, you know, probably made more money doing that and then it'll put water right. What did Jim or say say he said Peyton, with all due respect, fuck you and your fucking three feet and neck. We'll move on on what tank and the rest of this season so we can get Andrew Luck. That's what the fuck happened. Look what happened to Brett five rhe right. Be fucker. He actually had to go to the jets. Eli Manning, all these guy with his quiver and bottom lip. All he's gotta do is sit on the fucking bench for a couple of place. That's it. It's all you got to do. Everybody losing their fucking minds. How could they go this? How could they do the exact same fucking thing that they'd done to everybody? I don't remember the end of Derek Jeter as career when all those sports writers were fucking bitching about him saying he's a, he's costing the team. He's too fucking old. Should they move him over to first base? This happens to everybody. You know? You don't think that talking about me right now?

Speaker 2:          00:10:27       Yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:10:27       the way I'm fucking look in these days. I have like three friends of mine that are are, I love them. They're the biggest New York fans ever and I got like fucking phonebook level texts about what was going. You think it's going to end pretty with Tom Brady? This guy wants to play the least like 60 it's some point or fucking Bob Kraft is going to have to sit down and be like, Tom, it's you're too old. I mean look at yet you still have a Beatle mania haircut. What fucking year did you come in the league? You got to fucking Moe Howard haircut with the fucking part. I mean, I don't even know what to tell fucking Bill Clinton was still president when you came in. MMM.

Speaker 2:          00:11:20       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:11:21       I Dunno what to tell you. This happens to every, but yeah, it's obviously a shame. Eli's fucking great. Uh, I gotta tell you, it sucks is a patriots fan watching the giants just fucking dismantle and I wanted one more crack at them. We had nothing to lose. You already kicked our ass fucking twice. We'll come back like tex Cobb for a third one. And I was loving and there would always be an asterick even if the giants made the Superbowl. And even if with the Patriots made the Superbowl this year, if they came back without Tom Kauflin and we won that one, that still would be at, at, that still wouldn't be the same. They went. That's the level of respect that I have for fucking the giants organization. Tom Kauflin and Eli, Alicia Manning. I'm just breaking your balls. New York fence. I know. It sucks. You know what? It really is all you guys flipping out and you're acting like you love Eli Manning, but you really are, is you're a bunch of selfish cons because watching eli gets benched is just reminding you of how fucking old you're getting and now we're all going to die.

Speaker 1:          00:12:21       It reminds you of your own mortality. So rather than deal with that, you call it sports shows, losing your fucking voice, you know, and meanwhile we're fucking blown $1 billion a month fighting people who have sling shots in a bag of dynamite. Um, anyway, um, I swear to God, if I was running, this is how I would handle isis. I would just fucking take, I would, I would, whoever those fucking gamers are that at got to play on the giant TV screen in Dallas Cowboys Stadium. If you're good enough to do those guys who had those drone races in, in that stadium, that would be my defense against Isis, some intelligence and that I have those fuckers sitting in cowboys stadium when the cowboys didn't have a game and I just have them flying around, you know, blowing up at jungle Jim's. I mean, that's how I would handle it. Okay. And considering I haven't even physical fiscally researched this on any level. I haven't talked to anybody who's even remotely informed about what's going on over there. The fact that I did this in my own self contained think tank, I cannot even begin to describe to you how much this makes sense to me.

Speaker 1:          00:13:35       You know, come on dude, you got, you don't sit by yourself sometimes and just start solving all the world's problems. You start walking around your house whispering, pretending you're getting interviewed by Oprah. Come on. We all do this though. We Oprah sitting across from you. Do you consider yourself a hero? Um, is you sitting there muttering to yourself and then somehow you come into your fucking present, need you to sit in there scrubbing like a fucking old rice checkoff a bowl.

Speaker 2:          00:14:01       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:14:02       And you have, let's split second of just really stepping outside of yourself and being like, well I'm really, I'm a fucking crazy person.

Speaker 2:          00:14:09       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:14:10       And then all of a sudden the front door opens and you family walks in and you'd go right back into character and they have no idea.

Speaker 2:          00:14:15       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:14:16       Could you stand in there with this phony smile and awareness sweater? I'm sorry. Anyways, a happy trails. Matt Lauer, you know, you did a hell of a job waking everybody up, uh, for the last 20 years. And uh, hey, you got a little sideways. How do you buy a sex toy for somebody you work with and then write a letter? I mean, Jesus for, what? Did she just walk around with a fucking neon sign around your Goddamn neck? I swear to God. These people get to successful and they just like wanting to sabotage their own fucking career. Oh. Although maybe he's just like old school. He came in, he came in the league when that we'll all right. He was, I don't know.

Speaker 2:          00:15:04       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:15:04       When you could do that, cause you gotta think when he first started buying like fucking shit like that. If it was the late nineties, when you think about the cell phone technology, texting didn't even exist. There was none of that shit. There was no Facebook, there was nothing. Um, tell me what could that one poor woman do? Reg Run off a bunch of copies, put them on telephone poles.

Speaker 1:          00:15:29       It just so you know, and then he just had my assistant run out and tear him down. Matt Lauer screaming from the window. I said turn right. Um, I dunno. I Dunno. Anyways, I'm going to be in New Mexico, in Albuquerque, New Mexico, south west part of the state. Um, he's part of the country and I'm going to be an Arizona this weekend. Come on down.

Just throw it in a stocking handed to the person. Get on with your life. Put some bourbon in your eggnog. You had done at 95 bucks at a department store. You're looking at four to 500 bucks. Sorry. Moving watches at just 95 bucks. Edit a department store. You're looking at four to 500 bucks,

Speaker 2:          00:28:02       okay?

Speaker 1:          00:28:02       Uh, for this kind of a watch, because you can get about what you get to watch for like 95 bucks. But it's like a fucking Timex movement figured out that by selling online, they were able to cut out the middleman and retail markup, providing the best possible price. Had such great prices. Movement, watches make wonderful holiday gifts to classic design, quality construction, and styled minimalism. Over 1 million watches sold in over 160 countries. It gets 15% off today with free shipping and free returns by going to movement watches.com. That's mvmt.com this watch has a really clean design that makes it great fashion statement. Now it's time to step up your watch game. Go to MVMT watches slash burr join the movement. All right. Okay. I think, is that it? I think that's like 28 minutes. Um,

Speaker 1:          00:28:56       yeah, I'm going to try, you know something. I'm going to try to get out and do some standup tonight. I think I'm going to do that cause I got some gigs the next couple of nights. Right? Go out there, shake the fucking dust off. I've been in the edit room almost every night of this week. Okay. Only two nights, but it felt like every night with my add. Um, we are currently editing season three of f is for family. Um, I don't know when it's going to be. It's going to be out later on next year. Uh, that's how it works. Animation. It's a very slow process. But, um,

Speaker 1:          00:29:28       I'm really loving how this season is coming together and I'm hoping you guys are too. And if you don't, then I guess we won't get a season four and if we don't get a season four, I will be sad. But I also have a lot of free time, so it's one of those deals. So who knows, who knows what happens there. Maybe I'll just take the show and just start fucking putting it up on my website. Maybe I'll do something like that. That would be stupid building. You have to finance it yourself and you'd go bankrupt. Just fucking watch season three. So I could stay with my cushy deal at Netflix. Can you do that for me? If not, can you go to the Patrice O'Neal comedy benefit? Uh, I'll be announcing more special guests as we go. We might have a surprise guest at night. We're reaching out to some people. We'll see what happens. Um, it's always a great night. We always tell Patrice stories, we'd give each other shit and uh, it's obviously for a great cause. Okay. That's it. Please enjoy the music as we transition into a, an old school Thursday afternoon, just before Friday, Monday morning podcast from a Thursday from, I don't know, years gone by or possibly earlier this year. I have no idea. That's it. Have a wonderful weekend. You can't and I will. I will talk to you on Monday.

Speaker 5:          00:30:34       Okay. Same. We break other,

Speaker 1:          00:31:43       there's this youtube video that we go. Bill Burr was telling us that he found a fine video club called best, uh, best wrestling Promo ever starring. This guy jumped at Jeff Farmer. I'm judging, I'm guessing that it's from like the 80s, and this is before Vince Mcmahon sewed everything up. So it's an independent wrestling thing. I don't know. I don't know where at, but this guy is legit. So basically what it is, is this guy jumping Jeff Farmer. He's got, you know, he's going to promote your show. Then Jeff Farmer jumping, Jeff Farmer, he's going to promote his big wrestling match coming up on the Saturday. He's going to do the ric flair thing. I'll read something. He's supposed to be doing that shit and eat. It. Might have a little, uh, a little bit of a tough, tough time. We've all been spoiled by the, uh, nurse of the wrestlers and, uh, how, how they're able to rock the mic and really get on there and ad Lib and talk. And, uh, this guy apparently doesn't have the skills. He's still in the development phase. I'm not going to judge his entire career. Right. He got salmon here. He's a wrestling expert.

Speaker 6:          00:32:40       Sam as an expert. I mean, yeah, it will really come running down the hall with those floppy feet. We've got to promote that. Kevin Smith's calling the show today too. Oh yeah. Show just keeps getting better and better. Oh my God. He tweeted a while ago that he's, he's sleeping on his phone right now, so, so they wake them up for the, uh, the interview today. So, uh, Kevin Smith in about 15, 20 minutes. All right, let's check this out. Best Wrestling Promo. Ever earlier we talked to jump in Jeff Farmer. No, now do that interview. Both. There's jumping Jeff Farmer hello back.

Motley Crue, you turned the tables on me, you've turned the tables in a wrong way. You've got me mad now. I'm still around. I've listened to everything you had to say. I did everything necessary. But when you turn around and you back there me one way or another and you freak me out of what? Quite filling mine when I get angry. No, I'm the one doing the challenging. I'm issuing a challenge to you motley crew in the ring with me this time. Um,

Like he looks like he's good. That's what I was supposed to, I was supposed to go on with this shit. He looks like he's going to piss himself. What? I guess I'm just saying he played the fake staying in one point. Is that True Sam? How's he look familiar? I don't think so. He never had a career in wrestling really. Someone was trying to say he's in the wrestling hall of fame, the w whatever the whatever that is. Awe. Oh no, he's an IPW. No, I fucking get Sam started health deal school. Yes ma'am.

Speaker 7:          00:35:25       going full force

Speaker 6:          00:35:30       job and Joe Farmer, that guy's plastic too, by the way. All Wrestling Promo bloopers are, she's a genius and great. Kim Proterra it. This is fantastic. Some bloopers out there, dude. Have you ever seen the one where booker t calls Hulk Hogan the n word and then grabbed his head cause he's humiliated holding calls. Tony Atlas, a black boy back when he was a thunder lips. This one's great.

Speaker 8:          00:36:03       Whoa, whoa.

Speaker 6:          00:36:11       I should take the best is when he turns around and he looks at the girl and his crew like Vince is going to kill it, so yeah. Yeah. He should have been able to say what you sound good wrestling promo genius. It's genius. LEX Luger's genius. The Lex Luger blooper right there. Lex Luger one.

Speaker 8:          00:37:04       Yeah.

Speaker 6:          00:37:11       The best part is he goes to cover his face and then he makes it look like he's rubbing his hands. He's thinking maybe this will fly after all, so I got to cover up. That just fucked up the whole time he's got his chest, his pecs doing that, moving up and down. This one, this one's good because it's taken, like when they do smack down, they tape it to rebroadcast and they edited sometimes, but if you have a satellite dish you can pick up the satellite feed and watch it live. So they got the satellite feed of whole Kogan just completely like fucking starting over. Okay.

Speaker 8:          00:37:49       Oh, he messes up in front of him.

Speaker 9:          00:37:53       I have something to do with building. This company just makes you sick.

Speaker 10:         00:38:44       Starting to believe in your own bullshit. Hogan. I could have had anybody play the part of Hulk Hogan. I could have had anybody bring whole in

Speaker 9:          00:38:56       one second McMahon. You actually think anybody cut a with Hulkamania. Look at all the guys. You take the ball to look at all the guys that had the belt. Look at all the guys. The the goal. I know nobody ran as hard and as long as I did make man,

Speaker 8:          00:39:15       it sounds like a real argument.

Speaker 9:          00:39:20       If you actually think I was just the right guy at the right place. If the Ra at the right time really say it one more time so you completely understand. If you actually believe mine, if you actually think that I was just a right gay guy, right place, right time. Well then Europe picker, delusional pastor that I fucked. You are McMann.

Speaker 8:          00:39:52       Yes.

Speaker 6:          00:41:34       rip them apart. I'll piss down. Fuck that up. Oh, I don't think I stunk royally. Even the interview where he has his whole costume on, but his voice is just regular regular voice.

Speaker 7:          00:41:49       Come to the point.

Speaker 6:          00:41:51       What's that? What's that one sound? This was Kim's Tara fucking gene and a lot of metal title for less than 48 hours. It can be quite so coffee

Speaker 7:          00:42:01       come to the point completely. It's really Hurghada hand. He tried the thing ahead, man on me. There's going squad. Dang. Palm Sunday. Anyways, Hercules Hernandez. Mr. Wonderful. Paul Andar you I'd been familiar before. If I'm filling a million right now in the third turn my back. I didn't want that. You what happened with me like the duty yard dog and the goon squad. I didn't pay. I didn't recover. It only covered while you recuperate beyond that. I am full

Speaker 6:          00:42:36       watch gene open. She never goes to the bathroom that are going on in the real genius. I think he was laughing when he said 30 yards.

Speaker 7:          00:42:43       It's just a matter of time. Like I said before, I thought to, you mean can I put it to everybody? It's just a matter of time like yeah, but tower here that runs the world wrestling, her world wrestling federation has done like, Hey, can't go on. Right. You're all going to go down one by one and I'm going to make sure that for the weapon that you gave me, whoever you're like our restaurant is

Speaker 6:          00:43:12       that type of treatment. Did it change?

Speaker 7:          00:43:19       You guys want to do, bring it up, turn around and I say, I'm going to carry the start for a while, but I do and I view all right, what a beat.

Speaker 6:          00:43:30       Yeah. I have a little too visual because this, someone's been a, this is, it sounds really good, but there's a couple of things coming in. A botch mania on youtube and shock master master. You've seen it before. I think shock masters remaining is very visual, but a, okay, here's 10 labs in my life. Shock. Master's up their shop. Masters in might be in the top five. Wow. Shock Master. This is my favorite one. It's psycho said he doesn't realize he's, he's alive. Okay. Y'All fans. But there are a lot of skeptics that think that perhaps you can't take it. How do you address those skeptics? Wallace skeptics and all the people that have a little bill five house tonight. There you hear it. A man of few words sat. Go sit back.

Speaker 6:          00:44:25       You're alive. Pounds. Let me do that again. Yeah, we covered phone though. I made a few words on words. This is a, the shock master. Look man. What's the setup on it? Basically their version of it. They were supposed to, uh, they had a mystery partner and he was supposed to be like the next big good guy and WCW. And A, you're supposed to bust through the wall, but nobody told him there was a support to buy for under like at the base of the wall. Yeah. So he tripped right over the two by four falls flat on his face.

Speaker 6:          00:45:06       The entire thing is the funniest thing you've ever seen. It's staying in the British bulldog. A horrendous, they was supposed to be this big pump up of the shot massacre. But when he fought, when, when ric flair, cause he's one of the greatest of all time of this surrounded by five bumps. Awful. And his reaction to what happened, I watched this 700 times in the, and I cry every time. The shock master, he was just an old wrestler from the date of you eat from, it was tugboat in Dwi. He said they put a storm trooper helmet, literally a storm trooper helmet that they covered in glitter. Oh sparkles. Makes sure you have the, the the the sting lead in. I will. So this was actually so bad that this guy had a whole gimmick. He was going to be the next main event guy. They changed his entire gimmicks. So that he was just a Klutz that always lost. They couldn't do anything with them after that because of his debut. Yeah,

Speaker 11:         00:46:13       Jack. Other than what happened already, helmets and how to go get it and put it back on his face. Glittered puttered his fucking head. Do you think other wrestlers laughed at him? Voice. His voice was done by a guy off the set

Speaker 6:          00:47:11       who had a live mic. Oh, they didn't tape it. He did it live. So when he trips, you can hear them go, Oh God, oh no. That was Rick flair. He goes, let me tell you something.

Speaker 11:         00:47:31       You watched the whole thing would at home. You don't understand. The home vicious was doing a bad promo. Now we just watched too bad for all those British bulldog and sting were awful and ric flair had, this was like the Rick flesh show, so he was trying to put this together at flair. Flash trying to buck, but when, when he fell through the wall, ric Flair, when, Oh God, that fall the greatest thing forever. How bad the Promo we up to that point, he's panicked grabbing for that helmet. And this is in front of an audience, the live audience, and it's live on TV. This is their big thing leading up to a paper view. Live television by the paper view so you could see this guy that was supposed to be debut. This is perfectly clear. They're expecting big things from the shock man. Maybe the next hole, this thing right it completely to yet for the most, the whole thing going to stay on. If you have a wrestler, he wrestled a little low on this. This is the best. Bear with us a little further so he could get something more lead up. All right, good admissions bad.

Speaker 11:         00:49:25       They're all nervous cause flares. They're square. It's just like disgusting yelling. That's the worst outfit I've ever seen. Listen, it looks like he's wearing a pumpkin on his tag. He said, oh my God. Held up shaking his head. He's got to put his helmet on because the other guy's going to do his promo for him so you can't see his mouth shut. It's in the top labs just because it's not even a regular restaurant. The shock must must've breakthrough. I watched. I watched this alive in 1993 it's the greatest moment in pro wrestling history. There's never been a better [inaudible]. It's killing me. Eight different things that you think they watched this and just laugh. They did. It completely destroyed his career. Not only do you have to, you have to be as quiet as you can because you can hear Rick flair say, Oh God, you can hear offset where he's supposed to, where he's getting ready to do his promo for them. You can hear them making fun of him, laughing to yourself if you can this hell.

Speaker 11:         00:51:52       I've been through the mall. I was trying to drill a hole, you know, and we're doing his costume of injustice. He had a, for a giant fur vest that was three quarter lane buttons, a giant sparkly helmet and jeans and boots and no shirt shop master. The shock master wasn't an ass. They literally, after this show, they changed his entire gimmick. He became a construction worker that constantly falls down. That was his career bell's palsy. The stroke master keeps having them. Okay guys, shock Mr rules. I don't think I'm going to be able to license. This is the greatest thing I've ever seen telling you to smoke. Okay. Everybody can change so I will try. It's like big Jack Jack.

Speaker 11:         00:53:24       His voice hasn't started yet. You see him, you see him motioning with his hands and voice didn't start yet, but guys behind stage isn't talking yet so he's just motioning like he's talking like he's a mine. None of them said you fell through the wall. Jack [inaudible] like Yo, I'm actually impressed with this guy to be able to yell without laughing. He's so bad. He probably didn't know it. Still no muscles at all. He's terrible. He's got the shot to producer. He's got to get my stomach stapled. I keep breaking the wall and falling. I wish we could hear the audio better.

Speaker 11:         00:54:13       Try to nail a founds the logo to the these pummel you with how cupcakes are made. Dvt and he fell and this is a thing too, if you shit fell. No hands on his head like sweat on his fucking fucking stupid helmet and his Elma with fallen. He's gut down on the fucking floor like a, what is sand pail on his head? Oh No. Stopping him. So when he puts the helmet back on, I love the fact that that he's standing there, he has to wipe the ground dirt off the dust and look at staying as bad. All I have to say is he's calming everybody down. I hit the moment. All I have to say is I'll part is going to shock my row once off. Timing was, I got to see it again. You get to talk Yo. Yeah. Do you want to hear it really hard to hear the whole outfit. Everything but it does make a mistake. It doesn't have a body. Terrible. Hello. Wait, stop it. Stop it. Stop it. Stop it. Stop it. I'm sorry. You got to understand too. This was sid vicious and the Harlem heat and they were beaten up. A British bulldog is sting for like months and this is the guy who Dan is going to match the intensity. These are the top three guys, the top bad guys in the company, top good guy, and they had no one with them the day that this is, the guy ain't fucking got to stop Doron

Speaker 6:          00:56:24       foot or less. I would love to know what they're like, what is the shock master thinking after his helmet goes on and he's like, I just is this big mom. Oh, I wish I could see that from behind them is the best on someone tweeted that they made fun of this on raw recently? Yeah. Oh good. Yeah. We get it with the club shit where I get you to clap right here. All right, good. Yeah. Supposedly they went real inside and made fun of this one wrong. It's all a year ago. Less than a year ago. All right. Here's one more from the shock master. Yeah.

Speaker 11:         00:57:09       Jack Door, man. He just fell. There's no two by four that he just fell,

Speaker 6:          00:57:37       wait a minute, this is what he's doing and he's waiting for that guy to start telling you want to. He yells, he thinks it's his voice. Pantomiming the guy was yelling at him. He thinks that it's his boy, his backstage voice guy, but it's not if the guy can't even pay to mine is this five seconds, which seems like a million years where every one is collecting themselves. Audience, the front flap, the shot master, everybody went, Holy Shit. His helmet so discombobulated. What he's hearing is what he's supposed to be saying. There is a storm trooper helmet. He got the Holloway. Yes. Yes. It's not an exaggeration. That's the storm troopers. Storm trooper helmet with Glen Brown and he went to the next style. He got the captain caveman and cap his jeans that he drove to the arena and I think I heard a better version from the guy that just tweeted me, hey man, I gotta wake up at nine 45 I got to go to the airport.

Speaker 6:          00:58:50       You got to go bill. Yeah. I came by to say hi and we appreciate it. Yeah, he's going back to, I will. I will be back next week. Yeah, next week. Any time there will be back on the show next week. All right. Thank you Mr Bern. Keep up the podcast. I'm a big fan belt upon. Take it Isabelle and it goes this shot they're all looking at. Then go into shock. Master just fell through. They all see the whole kid going down the toilet. Could you go back? Can you go into shock master on raw? Just see if it's a better clip. Shop master on Ra is the, is the, is the shock master on wrong? Like that's, that's the one they made fun of him. That's not the original shock master. Yeah, they have a a clip of it though in the beginning just to set it up. All right. What'd you go with this? That I just want to stop the [inaudible] want you to hear his promo now let's go.

Speaker 11:         00:59:38       No,

Speaker 8:          00:59:43       they call me the shock master, but you're just felt the world good. Come on in. You want why? Why? Sure. All ready.

Speaker 6:          01:00:04       Hello. Can you pause this glitter? I think he has a glitter stormtrooper helmet on his chest. From what he found fucking storm trooper helmet sparkles. And why is it all scared of him? Cause he looked all scared. Why didn't he turn around Douche bag? He just fell through the fucking wall. Shock master is a dud and the promo is terrible. Be this brutal villain. This guy from another planet. Oh. Oh my gosh. Jeans and boots and and boys. The first thing you see is him fallen. You want a patient? Me, I just fell through the wall. Oh motherfucker. That is so funny. Now what is the setup on this now is this is from 19 or 2009 it was a year ago. They made fun. I'll see much better audio, but he doesn't have his promo on his phone.

Speaker 11:         01:01:06       None other than

Speaker 7:          01:01:15       hello.

Speaker 6:          01:01:21       You heard someone say, what did he fall to? The 40 fall. What did he has his backstage or fall? Oh, I love this guy.

Speaker 11:         01:01:33       None other than I told you.

Speaker 7:          01:01:41       Oh God

Speaker 6:          01:01:49       told you. It's just so bad. It's everything about is poorly done. Everything, man. It's just additive from the original one to shut out some awkwardness. Oh yeah. And then one thing I noticed, yeah, this is when they, uh, and then rod did a spoof on it a year ago. Yeah. Cause they were putting out, when was the original shark master for 1993 I saw the fucking 17 almost 17 years later. Raw fucking goofed off. Let's see how they goofed, right? No, but we just are coming. I think it's coming from that

Speaker 11:         01:02:20       wall. You know, it sounds like it's coming from over here. Yeah. Hm. Lito awesome. Where's the, where's the voice? Sounds like it's coming from right over there. Oh, there it is. A crap. Did they anyone even get it?

Speaker 6:          01:03:04       I love the shock master clip. Yeah. Oh yeah. It's out of a lot of labs I had and that shop master. That's great. And then they would dusty Rhodes, who is one who's probably in the top five, like my guys of all time to like dusty and we're flair. Was The rock the Best Micah? No, not at all.

We don't care if you know every basketball, we don't care because innately we don't like you. So you try to infiltrate your personalities on us and you realize that you're not interested in. Then you try to fuck us when that doesn't work. Your hours that you're interested at first and then look at if I work hard to get what I want, which is pussy. Right. You agree with that?
