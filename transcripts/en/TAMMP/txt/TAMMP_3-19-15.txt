Coming down the fucking hall with these Beer Gut slacks you can make out as giant package, you know? Oh, he's those big fucking book tooth glass. People always had some big fucking unit just swaying back and forth inside this slacks. You tried not to look at it, but every time they sat down you're just like, Jesus Christ, this guy's a fucking animal.

He had glasses and he had this fucking slacks like mc hammer pants and he had to have him because he had this giant fucking unit that everybody knew you had a giant and the guy couldn't hide it. He just had this fucking, you know, I don't know why I'm thinking a Mars moon unit. I Dunno what I'm thinking of. Anyways, this is the Thursday, a Monday morning podcast where you know, I just pop in. She how your weeks go in case you're having a bad one. I give you a couple of chuckles for 30 minutes. And then at the end of this we got uh, some of the, uh, some of the highlights over the year. Some Monday morning podcast selects that we uh, that we pull out.

Speaker 1:          01:53          I don't know. We're going to have this week. I have no idea. Um, but anyways, what's been going on with me the last couple of days, this is getting weird guys. If you can listen to two of these a week, like it's really getting to the point that, uh, you know, you've got to start paying rent here. I'm letting you into my house twice a fucking week. Oh, my wife was fucking pissed at me last night. Oh, Jesus Christ when she met. Um, I've been really tired lately and when I'm really tired or if I'm drunk, I fucking snore. That's the only time I snore. And, um, I had a couple of whiskeys and I was really tired and I told the last time I snore and go, just wake me up up, fucking go upstairs and I'll sleep on the couch asleep in the bedroom upstairs. Right? And she's like a, she's like, okay, so I'm fucking snooze.

Speaker 1:          02:42          And all of a sudden she fucking hits me. She goes, Bill, go upstairs. You snoring. So I'm laying there going like, oh yeah, this is bad. This is not fair to my wife going to get up. I'm getting, getting up like a minute. Let me just lay here. And I'm just laying there and I'm awake, but my eyes are closed. And uh, I don't know what happened. All of a sudden you started boom, boom, boom, boom. And I look up and I saw my wife walking out of the room and she went upstairs. And, um, so you know the deal, you're like, all right, well I guess tomorrow morning is going to suck. Right. You know, here we go. She's fucking Matt. You know, they're always mad. They're always mad about something. Something's going to happen, doesn't make a difference. So she was actually, surprisingly not mad at me, but what I was smart enough to do was I woke up in the morning, paddle by Dow Pope and I walked out the door and I went to the gym and got on the treadmill.

Speaker 1:          03:43          Um, I fucking, uh, yeah, I just left in the morning and, uh, I got a bunch of shit done, you know, picked up dry cleaning and dental is fucking shit. And then I also said I went to the grocery store as to what she wanted and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, and miraculously be kind of smoothed over. And she's still a little pissed at me, but not a, not in a big way, but, uh, but I'm back. Billy freckles is back in the gym. Hey old Billy's back again again, again, again, again. Why Buy Dewalt Bop, Bop, beep beep. Um, old people understood that joke. Oh, people watch that fucking cartoon. Remember that? Oh, Billy is back. Yeah. Yeah. Again, again, again, again. And then the dude would just start with him.

Speaker 2:          04:37          Yeah,

Speaker 1:          04:39          I got no fucking, I've got no water in my mouth, man. And fucking okay. Hydrated for being on the treadmill. Of course, you go to the gym, you walk in the men's locker room. What are you going to see? You're going to see the naked guy. You know? Here's the thing you got to expect. If you go into a men's locker room, somebody's going to be naked. All right? It's not that you're naked. It's the level of comfortable that you're naked. Right. I went to nam changing. I'm going to fucking leave and as I go to leave, I look over at, you know, just walking over to the sink to wash my fucking hands. And there's this guy standing there,

Speaker 2:          05:16          okay.

Speaker 1:          05:16          He's got the towel covering the front of him. He sort of holding it, but he's just standing there with his fucking ass out. Like the level of comfortable that he was.

Speaker 2:          05:25          Okay.

Speaker 1:          05:26          He was like a hey on. Just to remind you, I've got that meeting today. It's six southern. There'd be home a little late, like he was that level comfortable naked. That's what he should have been yelling out. Just fucking stand in there. Why does it bug me? I don't know why it does. You know what I mean? I'm usually fucking cool about stuff like this. Like I'm only as people, I walk into a men's room, you know, and it smells like shit. It's like, yeah, it's supposed to people shit in here better. They did it in here then in the restaurant. I've never understood that. The soundbite walking in a men's locker. It's just like, just can you just make a fucking effort?

Speaker 3:          06:04          Okay.

Speaker 1:          06:04          I Dunno. Is that weird? That guys are so uncomfortable with other naked around other naked guys. Women don't give a shit. Right? You sit around and talking about each other's tits. I mean, maybe we should do that. Hey look, you balls.

Speaker 1:          06:22          Oh, Jay, Jay's these only six minute, and he's talking about balls in a locker, rum balls in a locker room, the new fucking standup DVD by Bill Barr. Um, so I hit the gym all fucking week for the most part. And, uh, I just about perfectly, I did all these hours of cardio, but two fucking days in a row when I went to Atlanta for my last time ever working at the punchline. And, uh, when I went to, um, the next day I did one day at South by southwest to hype the all things comedy network with Al Madrigal did a little panel thing with him and, uh, Doug Benson, which was a fucking great time. Uh, Doug Benson is hilarious. I'm gonna tell you something right now. If you're thinking about not seeing fast and furious parts seven, just listen to Doug loves movies or ask him about it. He had me laughing so hard talking about that movie.

Speaker 1:          07:24          Like, he, he knows what the movie is, what I love about him. He knows what the movie is and it goes in with those expectations. You know what I mean? You know what he said to me? He said like, there's like five times in a move in the movie where somebody looks over at somebody and goes, hang on. And then the car drives off a cliff and nobody dies. And he was just laughing. But he thoroughly enjoyed it and I was just like, you know, what am I going to see that movie? I'm going to get an a stupid mood. Go see that fast and furious parts seven, driving from building to building. Hang on one [inaudible] you know, fast and furious really ought to be able to uh, they should really kick uh, the, the um, the creators of chips some money every time they make one of those movies. Cause whenever I see the fucking pile ups in that movie, I mean I think that goes back to chips. They did that every fucking week. Every fucking week. There was like a 200 car pile up back in the day when you could wreck all those cars and that was your job. What do you do? I'm a stunt man. I go out now, Rick, them I'll work on chips or work on the fall guy and I work on Simon is Simon and every week.

Why is the southern accents synonymous with stupid? Why would you do that a month before you're on the road again, but ab PPD, Papa booboo. Um, I don't know why I would do that. All I know is I got my tickets to the Kentucky Derby coming up all Gj. We're going to have such a fucking great time on that, that tour. And um, I'm actually worried that I'm going to out every fucking, uh, all the good shit I'm doing in the gym right now. I'm going to lose those two weeks on the fucking bus. I got to figure it out. I'm already mentally in my head. [inaudible] I'm starting the day with great nuts and a banana, right? This is one for y'all. You fatties out there. You got to have a fucking game plan.

Speaker 5:          15:14          MMM.

Speaker 1:          15:15          I was starting to be a comedian. Well I started in 92 did he go 88 to 92 or [inaudible] 89 to 93 I don't know what, but I was a failing miserably in college. I just, I completely missed that guy's career and I have to tell you, that guy is one of the greatest villains I've ever seen in my life. The look on his face and the way he would, he would look at opposing fans and how we just completely didn't give a shit what people thought of them. It was like watching a comedian going on stage and the crowd turns on them and they just stay with their fucking material. Um, was one of the most enjoyable 30 for 30 PSI. Uh, I watched and I thought that the people, uh,

Speaker 5:          15:56          okay,

Speaker 1:          15:57          that hated them came off. I mean it might've been the way that they edit it, but they just came off as kind of a,

Speaker 5:          16:03          yeah,

Speaker 1:          16:04          I don't think they came off like they were the jerks. I mean the, the interview two people, right? One Guy wrote a book called Duke Sucks,

Speaker 5:          16:13          you know,

Speaker 1:          16:15          I mean right there it's like, well obviously they don't, if they did suck this, we could just look at the stats. You know, we could look at the standings, but the fact that you gotta write Duke Sucks. That means obviously the mean, you know that right away they're winning. Right? Like how everybody hates man United. I don't know shit about the premier league. I obviously know that they got a lot of money and they've had a lot of success with the level of fucking hatred. The combination of that. And then the combination of someone like myself who knows nothing about,

Speaker 5:          16:43          uh,

Speaker 1:          16:46          soccer, football, whatever the fuck I'm supposed to call it. And I still know who man United is. I know that they play in Liverpool and um, what else do I know about them? Um, they got blue and white uniforms and um, they're fond to having ginger's on their team and uh, just trying to piss off as many English people. If fucking Manchester shut the fuck up. All right, let me know when they pick the ball up. Um, I actually really enjoy it. I like premiere the Premiere League. If you go there, it's fucking great. Most people singing songs. Next thing you know, you're eating fish and chips and fucking slamming beers, right? Z Pack Ian, even tighter, Nexia nail you fucking ear lobe the ear lobe with some fucking Neo Nazi. Right? But isn't that the experience? Somebody starts choking you with your little colorful scarf. I have no fucking idea what I'm talking about. Um, anyways, am I out of Shit to talk

Speaker 2:          17:50          about? How about those fucking Bruins man? Goddamn it, they were playing great and then a game we really needed to win. We needed to beat the fucking capitols. And what happens? We fucking lose two to nothing. But, um, I dunno. I like the way that they're playing. And even though this year, obviously I don't think we're going to win anything, but I do see a solid team being built for the future around some young guys. Um, Boston not can fucking Spooner. And, uh, that other guy that begins with an s and somebody else, I don't know. I've been fucking busy. Um, anyways, so listen, the movie, I have Zam beaver. That's right. A movie about beavers that turn into zombies. Okay. There's hot women in it. People get killed and all freckles makes an appearance in the beginning with, uh, someone who's way more known than I am right there.

Speaker 2:          18:40          You got to go see the fucking movie. You got to support this movie. You have to, you don't have to, but I would appreciate it if he did. It's been out for like two days. It'd be nice to see if it could, uh, compete with transformers. What'd you think? Um, anyways, I got a crazy week coming up. Uh, I'm in town and then I go to New York next week and I'm doing a couple of benefits. One at Madison Square Garden. And then like the other one I'm doing, um, at the theater at Madison Square Garden, not with a Nixon Rangers play. Uh, and then I'm doing, um, another benefit for actually Paul versus unfortunately Paul brother in brother-in-law passed away a while ago, about a year and a half ago. And um, so they have a benefit for him at levity, live levity live.

Speaker 1:          19:32          I never deliberately lever the law lived. Um, that's going down a week from today, Thursday. Um, it's a great cause, you know, I dunno, I dunno what to say. It's a fucking really sad story or whatever. So I'm out there. I'm doing that, doing a couple of benefits, you know, trying to fucking balance out my Karma here by doing some fucking good things with all this selfish shit I've done in my life. Um, did anybody watch the end of the genx? Anybody at all? Jesus Christ. Well that wasn't good. Nah, they got your card now. Just talking to himself in the bathroom, doesn't realize he's miked up. What happened? What do you think happened? I killed him. Jesus fucking Christ. Jesus Christ. That was fucking UN, one of the most amazing documentary series. Even if you know what the fuck happens, you've got to see the fucking thing. Hey, it's Bob calling. Um, I'd like to sit down and talk some more while, you know, California is a big state. I don't know. Those are block letters. I mean,

Speaker 2:          20:56          okay.

Um, there's a new documentary that guitar guitar made, um, on slash dad is a, I don't know, I got through the second hour and a half long. I saw the first half of it and it's just fucking awesome. And um, Alice Cooper says the funniest shit. He was just talking about the changes in music and he was talking about grunge music and he was talking about at the peak of grunge music. He goes, there was a time when I wanted to go to Seattle and roundup, all of the bands put them on a bus and take them to Disneyland. And he wasn't being a dick. He was saying it from like a place of concern because everything was so fucking miserable. All the music, you know, everybody, it just was such a turn in the music. You went from people dressing up like women to like fucking everybody like re I hate my fear of um, whoa

Speaker 6:          22:21          PE.

Speaker 1:          22:23          Wow baby, boom. Um, what the fuck does it take? Who started that style of singing? Was it Lane Stan Stanley there? [inaudible] you know, just, I dunno, it's like she's singing in the back of your throat and on either side of your tongue. Um, I dunno, actually, I shouldn't say that. I think that that, uh, lead singer Alice in chains and when the most original ways of seeing him, Perry Farrell from that era, him, Perry Farrell and axl rose, I thought he had the most unique phrasing when it came to a white guy sing. And there were there any black singers in that era that I can think of or was it, and you know, well, they all wrap it. My world is very different. I was in a suburb back then buried in my whiteness. Let's see what black artists did. I know back then, C and c music factory. Factory, right? Wayne, Wayne, Wayne, Wayne. Well, Wayne, you know I'm thinking of that song cause I'm going to the gym and they just play the worst fucking music at the gym. I don't know what it is. I was fuck yesterday, yesterday, couple days after Sam, hey, I fucking go to the gym and I'm changing right in, in the time I'm checking. Like I took my headphones off. I'd gotten off fucking country

Speaker 4:          23:46          as the lip, elliptical, right? A lip, the elliptical, and that's the new improved one. Um, I got off the elliptical and I took, I took my headphones off when it got into the, uh, the locker room and I heard the, the end of greases, the word. And then the next song they went into was a Banana Rama. I heard a rumor. I Dunno what it is. Like they can't, they always have to be like 25 to 30 years behind and it has to be the most poppy fucking horseshit. I'm trying to think if I've ever been at it,

Speaker 1:          24:19          Jim, that plays good music. The only time I ever heard worst music was a, I did a cruise ship Gig. I did it one time. He had to, we needed the money. Oh. And uh, you know, they have me staying in the bottom of the ship. I was so far down on the ship, like I walked by cargo and the, then the window to my room was round, you know what I mean? And, um, they fucking, uh, that was the only time I just remember really bad music, really fat people and Jello with whip cream and like these nuts on top of it, which was fucking gross. And I just hated the fact.

Speaker 2:          24:59          Okay.

Speaker 1:          24:59          I just hated the fact that I couldn't eat when I want it to, you know what I mean? The one that I was done, I was on some shit fucking cruise. I then I need to think that was called those. I was on shit liner and we went to a

Speaker 2:          25:15          yeah,

Speaker 1:          25:16          Cozumel somewhere in Florida, in New Orleans. And uh, I remember I worked with a juggler.

Speaker 1:          25:25          Juggler opened up for me and um, I remember him complaining that his joints ached from all the years of juggling and he was buying all this real estate in uh, Florida. And I just remember thinking like, I could not be any further away from show business than sitting here talking to this juggler about real estate in Florida on a fucking boat in the middle of the Gulf of Mexico. This is back when you eat no cell phone service. This is like 12 years ago. No cell phone service, no Internet connection, no nothing. I'm just on this fucking thing. And they lied to me. They told me that it was going to be though, this is the cool one. This is one that the young kids going, cause I said, I said, dude, I don't think my ex going to work well on a fucking cruise ship.

Speaker 1:          26:11          And uh, Lo and behold, I show up. I think I told this story before I show it up. And the first thing I see is this Vietnamese woman, I think she was Vietnamese because she had that hat on that whenever you watch a movie about platoon of Vietnam, you know those hats that they wear when they're out there in the fields and shit. She had one of those on and she was, she looked like she was like 110 and she was already asleep. Like the cruise was starting and she's already asleep. Like not excited whatsoever. Like, this woman is clearly dying and she's, her mouth is open and uh, you know, she was missing all the teeth, like from, from six to 11 numbers, the canine, and you're right, number six, that's number six, seven, eight, nine down front, 10 and Lt. Other Kayla Canine, that's 11 if you ever want to know how dentists number their teeth, it starts on your upper right jaw, the wisdom tooth. That's number one as the first round draft pick. All right?

Speaker 2:          27:10          Okay.

Speaker 1:          27:10          And you got two, three. Those are your other molas that you're going to keep unless you're a fucking caveman. You got two sets of fucking wisdom teeth and I don't, I don't know how to number of those. So that's three, four. Then you've got those other two ones. I forget what those are called, right? All right. One, two, three, four, five. And then you have the k nine to six, seven, eight, nine a down front, right?

Speaker 2:          27:38          Vip Seating,

Speaker 1:          27:40          10 and then 11 you can do the rest. And then the weird thing is, is when you go down below, you don't start back on the right side of the Dji. You go straight down. So you count from the upper right wisdom tooth all the way over to the upper left wisdom tooth. And then you drop straight down, lower collective settling with power down to a, what is it? Uh, that would be 33, I guess, right? Not 33. You got 32 fucking teeth. 33 I can't fucking remember. It's a long time ago. Composite and all of that shit. Pouring up models

Speaker 4:          28:16          I've had, I've lived a lot of lives. I could have said I could assist on a fucking dental procedure. I still know how to take x rays. I could pour up a fucking model, you know, sold newspaper subscriptions. I had a paper route and unloaded trucks. I can drive a forklift. Well, I'll tell you, I'm sorry. Anyways. All right, we're winding down here. So there's your little half hour. Isn't this nice? You got a fucking paycheck. What are you gonna do with that money by the way? Oh, you're dumb. Fuck. Are you going to blow it? Are you going to use it to get yourself in even more debt or are you going to use it to free yourself? That's the one thing you got to learn. You have to learn about money.

Speaker 2:          29:01          Okay?

Speaker 1:          29:02          It's a bunch of people bitching about rich people and who's kidding who their cons. All right, they got their foot on your throat, the back of your neck, whatever you want to fucking say. But that doesn't mean it's got to stay there. You can wiggle out, you can wiggle out and they'll let you go because it's like,

Speaker 1:          29:18          I dunno, it's like just imagine grabbing a whole pile of gold in the center of a table and as he polling it towards you, some of them fall off. You don't give a fuck as long as you get the line share. So those are like people that they want to just keep underneath them self, a few fall off, they don't give a fuck. So your goal in life, if you're poor and middle class is to be one of those coins that rolls off the fucking table to freedom. And how you got to do that is got to make your money work for yourself. All right? That's what you have to do. All these fucking jerk offs going out lease and BMWs and buying stupid sunglasses and that type of shit. And they don't get a pot to piss in morons.

Speaker 5:          29:57          Okay.

Speaker 1:          29:58          I guess I understand it on some level you're trying to attack, attract a better look and woman, right? Cause what kind of woman who's room even remotely good looking is going to settle for some broke asshole. Why would you,

Speaker 5:          30:10          you know,

Speaker 1:          30:11          they have dreams, they have dreams of spending your money. Um, but uh,

Speaker 5:          30:19          okay.

Speaker 1:          30:20          Oh look at that car. Jesus Christ. I fucking love cars, man. The old school ones, I'm still searching for the one that I know the model and I'm getting, I'm not going to tell you what year, but you know, I'm a Ford Guy and I also like sedans. I'm going for a mid 60 Ford sedan that's going to look like the year of it on top and underneath is going to be fucking 2015 right down to the chassis.

Speaker 5:          30:45          MMM.

Speaker 1:          30:46          It's going to be a five speed and the biggest fucking engine I can stick under that fucking hood and that's going to be a, that's going to be my car. I'll have my old truck, I'll have my car and, and what the fuck else do you need? Right?

Speaker 1:          31:03          At least fucking morons going out and buying it. And I don't know. What do you, what are you doing? Huh? With your selfie stick? You dumb cunt. Oh God. You know what I'm saying? Fucking kills me that I didn't come up with a selfie stick that was just right there waiting to be invented, waiting to be invented. Right? And then you take it to those shark tank, fucking constant. A gun. It's a great idea. Tell you what, we're going to own it. And I will take the patent and then the money will go to us and I will tell you what we made. That's how business works. It's legalized stealing. It's why you got to get out from underneath that soul if you are

Speaker 5:          31:39          okay,

Speaker 1:          31:39          if you are in debt, you got to get yourself out of it. You know what I mean? Just fucking baby step you fucking way out of it. Um, and then the great thing, then you start saving up money and then you have freedom.

Speaker 5:          31:55          You know,

Speaker 1:          31:56          God forbid if you lose your fucking job, you know, you got some fucking money or whatever. I don't know. I don't even know what I'm saying. Even know how to intelligently say what I'm saying and I'm actually right. How fucking pathetic is that? All right, well there's your little half hour fucking riffing, you know, just to brighten your day. Add a little more sunshine to your payday, right? Do me a favor. Don't blow all of it. Alright. Take some of that money and knocked down the principal on something. Pay a little extra on your car. Do something. All right. Do something to get yourself out of that fucking, that prison, man. You can't fucking do that to you. Suffer, right? You only got one life. He should be living it in a happy way with, it's not some fucking asshole with his foot in the back of your fucking neck, which is how the thing is set up.

Speaker 4:          32:40          All right? So they go, I don't know if that was motivational. I Dunno what? Oh yes. Like party to t two days is fucking week. So I only ended up, I have to all the fucking word

You know what it was? I got a Burrito and I shouldn't have got the case of deer, but I was drunk and I got that too. And I'm just shoveling it in my fucking pie hole.

It's a fucking Burrito and some Miller high life. Um, all right. That's the, um, this is just me checking in. That's all. I'm just checking in on you. I don't know what this is the Thursday, Monday morning podcast d uh oh, Billy's back again again, again, again. Podcasts. I don't know what the fuck to call it. I don't give a shit. All right. Um, what else? That's what this is. And uh, that's what this was and that's it. All right. You enjoy your fucking weekend. Hi.

Speaker 3:          34:14          Okay.

Speaker 4:          34:14          You go out there and you talk to some broads. You get down to buy you a drink. You turn the fucking tables. Uh, all right. That's it. Go fuck yourselves. I'll talk to you on Monday. All right. I don't know why I just fucking ended the podcast. I ended up the live part of it, not the live, then the new part of it. Now we're going to go into some classic clips from a bygone era in podcasting when I was only one of 43,000 comedians that had a podcast, uh, as opposed to now where there's 7 million, 859,000 podcasts. All right. And Joy, these classic clips. And, um, and that is all I'll talk to you on Monday.

Speaker 3:          34:59          Oh,

Speaker 7:          35:04          tell you a fantastic fucking story last night. All right. So I'm working on the road with Joe to Rosa Young Joe de Rosa, the fucking teen idol from the opiate Anthony Show who was actually going to be on the cover of teen beat this, uh, this month. And it's actually, I saw a little bit of the photo shoot. He's doing a tribute to Annette Funicello and, uh, that other fucking guy was it Tony Curtis who the fuck she used to make those beach movies with or whatever. Joe's going to be there shirtless, holding a surfboard, and now I tell you he needs, he's never looks sexier. Um, so, uh, the fuck am I talking about? I Christ, I don't even know anymore. Um, yeah. So we go out last night, right? We're doing the show is these two big titted horse sitting in the front fucking row. All right? So we're like, Oh wow, look at these girls.

Speaker 7:          35:54          These girls would probably be fun, right? And I'm going to relationship, but you know, I like being the wing man. You know, I love being the wing man. I'd love it. I love talking shit. The girls, I love hitting on girls. I fucking do it all the time and then I try to pawn them off to wherever the fuck I am. And uh, you know, so I don't have any goddamn guilt, you know? So anyways, so long story short, we're talking to these broads and it's clear that there's some sort of strippers. I Dunno what the fucking deal is. Okay. So we meet everybody from whatever, I'm going to stop naming names here. Okay. So a huge group of us from the show, from the crowd and everything. We go and we head out to this bar, right? So one of the strippers is cool, the other one has a voice that could literally crack a flat screen TV.

Speaker 7:          36:44          All right, so the cool one shows up. First she sits down, I'm like, hey, how you doing? You know, I like at the end of the week I hang out, buy a round for some people, you know, I'm in a great mood. I had a good time, I'm on my way home, you know, up by some people, some drinks. So I say to her, hey, what would you like to drink? She's like, I'll have a fact and gag at Google, one of those fucking chick drinks. So you know, so I get her a drink, I buy young Joe to Rosa fucking drink, right? Everybody's having a good time. And then this other person shows up who I knew and she was a real nice person. I said, hey, what do you want for a drink? And she was like, I'll get a vodka red bull, right? I got my $20 bill out and then this trip is like, yeah, make it too right. And I was like, wait, what? What do you mean make it to you haven't even finished your first make. Don't be ordering off my money. You've finished your first one there, young lady. All right. Stand the fuck down. You're not working right now. Not some dip shit. Getting a fucking lap dance. All right. Finish your fucking milk and cookies first. So needless to say, the conversation cooled between the two of us.

Speaker 7:          37:53          But I didn't give a fuck man. I was having a good time, but whatever. It was still kind of, you know, whatever, just talking shit. We were talking sports. The bartender was cool, you know, we, everything, everything was going great. So which Shell and out and all of a sudden this fucking, uh, the other fucking stripper girl shows up out and was so fucking, it was just such classic female shit. She's got a tits hanging out. She's got the fuck me pumps on and she comes up, she goes, hey. And she sees a friend with the drink and she knows God damn well she didn't pay for it. So she looks over at me as less. It's like, well, that must've been the SAP. Who fucking bought it. Right? So she looks at me, she goes, hey, Belle. And she's like, she's like, what are you drinking? Right? And I know what she's doing. I'm like, I'm drinking one of those Sam Adams October fest

Speaker 7:          38:45          that is, leave it like that. Nice and awkward. Right? Cause I know what she's trying to get a drink out of me. Right? So she doesn't know what to do. She's like, ah, is it good? I'm like, why? Yes. Yes it is. At this point, Derosa knows what's going on. I don't know that he knows what's going on. So she looks at me like, okay, well evidently he's not buying any more drinks. And then she looks at Jo, she's like, uh, hey Joe, what are you tracking? And Joe gets his shitty and grin on his face. He goes, why? I'm drinking a bud light. Why would you like to buy me one? And she didn't know what the fuck to do. She's like, ah, I, yeah, I guess. He goes, you know what? I think you should buy me a bud light and then you should by my good friend bill burr here, another October 1st.

Speaker 7:          39:33          What do you think about that? And at that point I'm fucking dying laughing. The other stripper girl next to me, she's laughing her ass off cause she knows what happened. And then the fucking girl with this screechy voice is sitting there. She doesn't know what the fuck to do. We fucking nailed it. And then wait and then like she's going, she didn't know what to do. And Joe's just going, yes, why don't you pay it forward for all the drinks that guys have boughten you and that you've drank. And then immediately turned around and fucking walked away. Why don't you for once by a Goddamn by a couple of drinks for a couple of guys and she's, I said, you put it that way. Fine, I will. I will. I'll buy you a fucking drink. And Joe's like, how bout some shots too? And she just was, I don't know what her fucking ego was that she goes fine, I'll fucking do that too.

Speaker 7:          40:19          So we actually got to strip it up by his two beers and two shots. So we're filling like the kings of the world and then all of a sudden we found out from this waitress that on the slide she tried to put it on a boyfriends fucking credit card. What a scumbag. Right? So we bust her and we all week and when there's big commotion breaks out right before the fucking bar, chances are about ready to swipe the boyfriend's credit card. We were like, Joe, chill, Joe Ed. I just like an officer and a gentleman. I got nowhere else to go. Right? We get them to stop and they take out her ATM and she had the fucking pay for it and it was a done deal. We had two drinks, two shots from that fucking person who you know has never paid for a drink since she got her fucking tits. Right. And this was the best part. The second we got our drinks, we set thanks a lot. And we both got up and we walked away.

Speaker 7:          41:13          Oh, it's tremendous. Tremendous. It was the best night ever. And I'm just standing there drinking my drink like 20 minutes later I'm milking it for all it's worth. This free fucking beer that has stripper bought me was awesome. Brian and Joe was talking to some girl across the way. He looked at it. All of a sudden I just yelled over. I go, Joe, and he looks over at me and I did. I did the Robert De Niro line from when he was eating the Joe Pesci, his mom right before they hacked up. Billy Batts, right. He looks up and he's like, what's up? And I just pointed at the beer the stripper had bought and I just went delicious. Delicious. And that was my evening.

Speaker 7:          41:53          Yeah, it was fucking raining out. This one, one thing I've learned that when you go to a football game and you're dealing with the elements, this is the more of a douchebag you look like the warmer you're going to be. All right. I saw the rain and I said, fuck this, and we went right to Dick's sporting goods and I'm like, I'm buying that fucking, I'm going to buy a raincoat with the matching rank. Coach slacks, I don't give a fuck. I bought a pair of a wool socks and I was good to go. So I'm with Versie and you know they only had like two rank coats left and they were the exact same color. This fucking great slush puppy purple. So we both have matching extra large fucking, we got the jacket and the pants like we're working at a fucking airport and what Quinn we're bringing in the fucking soul plane, right?

Speaker 7:          42:52          That was a purple airplane, right. That's what we look like. So we show up to the game, right? Neither one of us has comfortable because neither one of us is a jets or a bills fan. So we're in enemy territory and a, it's fucking drizzling and out. It's fucking cold. So I proceed to put on this Barney the dinosaur outfit, right? And right off the bat, Versie starts Punkin out gone, man. I'm just going to, I'm just going to wear that. I'm just going to wear the top. I'm just going to weigh the top. Trying to act like it's not raining out that bad. The reality is, is he didn't want to go through the hazing that he would have to if the two of us walked in with our purple on Purple Fucking Rain Coats Times too. We would have got a ton of shit and I was prepared to take it.

Speaker 7:          43:34          I had an, I had a whole fucking silly walk I was going to be doing. I had, I don't give a fuck. So he punked out. So, uh, we ended up walking in and put my head's cold, right? All I have is a baseball cap on. So I'm like, fuck, I got to buy a hat. Can I buy a bills? Who gives a fuck? They were in last place, mangled by a bill's hat, and then I saw this, this one with a Patriot logo on it. I said, fuck it. I'll get that. Once I put that one on, I'm nice and warm. We go to, we'll call, we pick up our tickets. We go into that high school football stadium that they have out there that I actually love, looks like an old school football stadium. You know what I like about that football stadium?

Speaker 7:          44:10          That's about the size of a football stadium that holds real fans. You know what I mean? All these, these new ones that hold like a 100,000 fucking pants, all the bandwagon shitheads. You know when you're all in for the real fucking fans show up or oh in three right? So he walked into the Goddamn stadium. We love in life, right? I'm already laughing at Versie cause I know damn well what's going happen. He's going to walk out there. There's going to be some shitty little plastic seat that's going to be covered in fucking water and the only way he's going to be able to absorb it is through his God damn jeans and his fucking bbds and he's going to be sitting there with a wrinkled up nuts sack that's going to be getting a hyperthermia by second quarter. Why do I know this? Because I've been there.

Speaker 7:          44:54          So we'd get a couple of bears. We get this fucking beef on a stick or whatever the fuck they call it. We're good to go. We go in there, sit down. He sits basically down in a fucking puddle. He tried to stick a newspaper down, which is very absorbent. And uh, I dunno, we sat there and I had hoped for about eight seconds in that game and the jets came down and just fucking Jew. They just kicked the shit out of him. Christ. They kicked ass shit out of 'em and uh, and it was just over them. So we'd, so immediately, our solution is just to start drinking the way we drank at the masters. We're like, fuck it, let's, let's, let's get going here. Right? So we'll make a trip after trip and all of a sudden I gotta take a Piss, right? So I go and I'm standing in line and all of a sudden this, this fucking six foot five goofy looking jackass, one of those guys who's like six foot five, but you still think he can take him, cause he's just covered in baby fat.

Speaker 7:          45:55          You know, he's got a couple of whiskers on his chin and his cheeks a rosier than saint nick. Right? And he's got this Jersey on and this big stupid, I'm a buffalo bills fan with the horns on it and stuff. You know, he's the wacky guy so I'm not even thinking shit. Right. This is bill's jets. I don't have a dog in this fight. I'm not talking any shit. I'm fine. I forgot I was wearing my patriots hat and all of a sudden this big goofy jackass starts going [inaudible] patriots fan. He liked the rats. We got to ran away the rats. He likes to fucking read this shit, right? And I'm like, yeah, yeah, no, whatever. He starts giving me Shit, I start giving him shit back then the weirdest fucking thing happened. I, by the time I get in to the actual men's room, I've talked, I've given these people so much fucking shit that actually there's bills and jets fans at a bills and jets game.

Speaker 7:          46:55          They're playing each other. They stopped giving each other shit and they teamed up together and started giving me shit. Right. And then I just said, I don't know what I was thinking. I felt like I was on stage cause it was like a crowd. I wasn't thinking like, Hey, you know what, Bill, you really haven't had a fight outside of your family since maybe playing fucking street hockey in the sixth grade. I didn't give a fuck. I'm in a goddamn bathroom waiting to take a piss in a goddamn trough, by the way. And uh, and then they just started giving a fuck. And this one dude on top where he sucks Dick, he shucks dig and he's like, miming it like ridiculously wealth. So I'm like, yeah, you're nobody. You do that real wealth. Because I learned it by watching Tom Brady. I'm like, oh yeah, do you rent that porno?

Speaker 7:          47:41          You fucking fag gets a little uglier, gets a little uglier than this other dude. What the fuck did I came up with the hell he was saying to me and I just said, look, I'm sorry you guys have never won a super bowl. You know? Then the jets fan pipes in. I go, do you realize the last time you guys won a Superbowl, Charlie Chaplin was still alive? Do you understand that? Do you know what cars look like the last time you won? You fucking morons. And then, uh, then this other guy got up until we've won three super bowls. I'm sorry. Right. And then the guy goes, well, you didn't play in the games. I go, neither did you. Then he's just standing there with this dumb look on his face. Like, oh, that's where I keep staring forward. You got nothing for getting that.

Speaker 7:          48:23          I don't know how to fight. So all of a sudden it's my turn to pes. I take my dick out, I'm ready to Piss. And one of these fucking pussies pushed me in the back hoping that I was pissing at the time. Fortunately I wasn't. So I turn around, I put my dick away cause I'm a gentleman. I said, I go, is that how you guys do it out here? Really? I go, which one you guys push me like I'm gonna fuck, I'm fucking Jackie Chan. And for some reason none of them said anything. I don't know if it was my purple on purple rain coat or the look of fire in my eye, but I'm a fucking 42 year old, balding redhead talking shit in there. And none of them said anything. So now it's kind of funny to me. I felt like I was in like the world series of poker and I went all in and I, and I didn't have a hand whatsoever, so I don't know who the fuck pushed me, but that's what I mean.

Speaker 7:          49:13          Come on. Bitchy is moving the fucking week. How do you do that? How do you do that? How do you, how do you push another man when he's got his Goddamn Dick out trying to piss it to a fucking trough? How do you get lower than that? Do you guys have any ideas? How do you get lower than that? So then after none of them sending anything, I go back and I started taking a piss and then that other dude who was miming somebody's sucking a dick unbelievably well right next to me were one of those stupid hats that has the toggles on this side and he's still trying to give me shit and I'm going to haggle, go fuck yourself. And then he just starts screaming over and over again. Are you looking at my deck? Are you looking at my dick like maniacally, like five times.

Speaker 7:          49:58          I just sort of stared at him like why do you keep going this, this gay angle? Like why is there always a, I dunno. I think he was one of those guys. He was kind of in the closet and then uh, so he just goes to football games and he gets really drunk trying to just kill it. The families, I think he liked me. It's what I'm saying. So if he's listening to this, I'm sorry. Uh, I'm, I'm spoken for you fucking pants and you fucking believe that first of all, what's wrong with me? I really replay it, all of that in my head. Cause once I got out of there I was like, I really started thinking like, what, what did you think you were going to do in there? They're not Clint Eastwood yet saying things. Clint Eastwood would say, what? What the fuck is wrong with you dude? Like I don't know if I've said this before in a podcast, a public bathroom is the worst fucking place to ever get into a fight. There is nothing soft. This, everything is porcelain pipes, that concrete floor and then it has a mist of piss and shit. It's just the fucking, it's the worst. It's the worst place ever, you know, not to mention it usually starts evidently when one person as begun, the pissing process.

Speaker 5:          51:14          Okay.

Speaker 7:          51:16          So, uh, you know, older, little bit wiser. So then I'm standing in line to go get some more alcohol cause God knows that's what you need after an incident like that. And I was just kind of just sitting there thinking like, all right, now how should I have played that? It w it should have ended when the dude with the water buffalo hat started giving me shit. What I should've done was rolled with it. I should, you liked the patriots. I shouldn't be like, hey, you know, you guys scored 30 on his last week, man. You guys look great man. I, I bet the jets, I mean, I bet against the jets. I hope you guys should have just ended it with that and did it. I, I should, uh, I should have extended an olive branch. That's what I should've done in the future. That's what the fuck I'm going to do because, uh, that was a, a, that was a potentially ugly situation. But fortunately, um, I think the people who are doing it, you know, had jobs and no one wanted to get sued and no one was willing to take it to that level. Uh, and when I say fortunately, I mean for me and my face,

Speaker 5:          52:30          okay,

Speaker 7:          52:30          oh, do you know how bad that would have been to get stomped in that fucking purple on purple rain coat laying there with my dirty fucking patriots hat and my team wasn't even playing. I would have lost the lawsuit. They would have been like, let me get this straight. You're a patriots fan. You are a patriots hat to a bill's jets game and you somehow managed to get the shit kicked out of you. What the fuck did you say? You know, that's one of the great things about being a guy is you actually have to take responsibility for your, for your actions. See, a woman would be like, there's no excuse. There's no reason. I don't care what happened. You don't hit a girl, which is true. You don't hit a fucking girl, but there's no learning in that. There's no lesson. You know? Even my best friends would have been like, yeah, those guys are fucking assholes. And the button, you know, that would've been an awkward pause and it to be like, dude, what the fuck he talking shit by

Speaker 1:          53:26          yourself at a gay when your team isn't even fucking play. What's wrong with you? You're 42 years old, get your shit to you.

Speaker 3:          53:33          And they would have been right.
