Speaker 1:          00:00:02       Hey, what's going on? It's bill burn his time for the Thursday afternoon, just before Friday, Monday morning podcast. And I am just checking in on you. Okay. This is a very somber podcast. I'm fucking you. It's not somber. I just have to go do a show and I don't wanna fuck up my voice before I even go out there screaming like an idiot. Um, I am in clear Lake Iowa right now. I'm about to do the surf ball room, the site of the, the final buddy Holly big Bopper, uh, Richie valance shell. I just landed in the airport that they took off from there. Uh, subsequently died. I don't know if you heard about that. They died along with some music I believe. And um, yeah, I told a lot of people that was flying into there. It was like, dude, what are you Outta your mind? Well, good luck dude. Good luck. You know what I mean?

Speaker 1:          00:00:55       You, they don't say that when you fly out of lax. Right. Some fucking more on, flew his plane into a commercial airliner at Elliot, you know, when the guy was on finals. So, I mean, I don't understand what the deal is. The reason why they are plane crashes because they didn't have the technology back then. There was a, they had ice on the wing. Okay. Not only adding weight to the aircraft, it changes the shape of the fucking wing so it doesn't produce the lift you need. And then you got the big bopper in there. But he's a big guy, a Da. You got yourself a problem. All right? No, we all know that. I've been off the booze, I've been losing weight. So I'm flying in, I'm not flying in, I'm riding in and I'm in a prop plane coming down from Minneapolis. And of course, you know, when you're flying commercial, you look at a prop plane like, dude, what the fuck? You know? But uh, if you just knew how much the plane probably costs, I don't know. Probably too, it's probably a $2 million plane.

Speaker 2:          00:01:50       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:01:51       All right. They can seat 10 people. Now if you just look at that, like what if I owned that? What if I own one of those? I have, if you had a 10 passenger fucking plane, you are the shit. Everybody's like this guy, he's dude, he's to fucking play. He's got a plane. What does it hold? 10 people get the fuck out of you. That guy's crushing it. But the second you fly commercial and it's a 10 seater, everybody gets all fucking freaked out. Like I'm not getting in that piece of shit. The exact same plane that if your buddy down the street went and bought it, you, you, you would think that he hit the lottery.

Speaker 2:          00:02:27       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:02:28       All right. A lot less mute moving fucking parts.

Speaker 1:          00:02:32       So I get on the thing and I immediately texted a buddy of mine who's fucking terrified of flying just to watch. You know, I was, I really wished that he was there, a buddy of mine outside of comedy. So I'm taking the picture as the lady who's going to fly it is doing the, uh, the announcements, telling us basically what not to do. And uh, he goes, dude, there's no fucking way I would be on that plane. And then he saw the woman's face. He goes, is that the pilot? And I go, yeah. And he goes, no, no way.

Speaker 1:          00:03:02       He said, not for females. Fucking unbelievable. What do you mean not for females? And she doesn't have to bench press it. It's a fucking machine. Jesus Christ. And because of guys like you, she probably went to extra bullshit to become a pilot. I think she's going to be fun. She crushed it. Of course. Not for females. Um, I dunno. I'm sure some women will be offended by that, but it really just had to do with this person's fear of flying. You know what I mean? He wants, you know, he basically wants to pilot that. I don't know what to look like to look like fucking Lee majors of some shit. Um, and to be honest with you, most of them don't because they set up in an uncomfortable chair their whole life and they got a quick turn around. So they run in the eat airport food and a lot of them, the lot of them look like, you know, if they didn't have like that, uh, it actually, you know what, if you went to a buffalo wild wings and you took the average football fan, you know, draft kings, fucking Jalapeno poppers, fucking loud moron and you took that fat fucks Jersey off and you put on a pilot, you put them in a pilot uniform and he told you flew for America and you'd believe it.

Speaker 1:          00:04:15       You know, not saying that the average pilot is as dumb as the average dope that goes to a fucking sports bar, myself included. I'm saying that they have the same body type. That's all I'm saying. All right. So anyways, you know, one thing that was fucked up is that, um, I guess it's probably a numbers thing. There was only 10 of us, including the pilot and it was one of those flights where, you know, they got to like weigh your bags, all of that shit. They tell you where to sit, you know, the whole weight and balance thing. And then one of the passengers gets to sit up in the copilot seat. And I was just thinking like, that's the only part about this that I don't like that there's only one pilot here. Uh, you know, flying commercial and it should be two people in case somebody has some sort of cardiac episode or a or whatever.

Speaker 1:          00:05:02       Right. That was the only thing I was concerned about, but it was a course. It was a cloudy day and all that shit. Um, but, uh, it was incredible. So anyways, um, I think I might do this podcast in two parts because I'm so excited to be playing this venue here tonight. I'm here with Dean del Ray were freaking out. They were going to get to play this place and it's still the original stage. Uh, most of these places, they don't have the original stage because whoever was legendary who played there didn't immediately go out, get on a plane, and then died. So immediately that place became like this shrine. So they, they've added to the stage, but the wood flooring is the same. And like, we're going to stand on the same fucking word. I don't know if you're into that type of stuff.

Speaker 1:          00:05:48       Um, I am. So I'm very excited. I guess everybody's ever played there, assigned the wall. I'm going to try and take pictures that they let us know. So, um, but either way I'm to come back and, um, finish out this podcast after I do the show. Um, by the way, um, I hope you guys enjoyed that live podcast as much as I did. Uh, I got a bunch of compliments. People really liked it. I definitely want to do another one. Um, it was weird. I felt like I was doing standup, but I was just sort of sitting down on the couch and, um, and I was also like amazed at what people laugh at. You know, I had, you know, I just spent doing it, talking to myself like I am right now forever. I have an idea what you laughing at, but I had no idea how much you guys laughed when people wrote in and shit all over me.

Speaker 1:          00:06:41       Um, when they, when they ask advice and um, and then the level of crazy shit that I say on here, just being a fucking moron. I had no idea that people laughed at that. I just pictured, I always pictured, I always picture guys snickering and then their wives shaking their heads walking out of the room. That's what I picture when people listen to my podcast. I didn't realize, you know, we had, we had a nice mix of people there, although they, oh my God, if I have to tell you this, there was this one group of ladies who went to the show that were just hell bent on, let me know that their friend didn't laughed once. Right? Oh, how did I, is a great story. So I'm standing there and taking pictures, right? Fucking, uh, you know, signing in the posters and all that shit for everybody who came out to the podcast.

Speaker 1:          00:07:28       I'll be in a great guy. I'm a made guy and being a great guy, I could have just done the fucking show and I could have hidden the green room afterwards being like, I'm too tired. I don't want to meet people, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. I don't want to do it because I was in Reno and that guy reached in for is a camera that time and the loaded glock fell on the floor that he said, oh shit. Quickly picked up and ran out of the fucking place. I did. I walked out there and I was being a good guy. Right. So these, uh, these older ladies, right. Um, all their meeting, they're probably about a year younger than me, a year or two younger than me. You never know. It's very hard to guess a woman's age or white woman's age, you know, you can't tell.

Speaker 1:          00:08:11       You know what I mean? Because they're not big on using lotion and FTF a kid like that does something to you, you know, see, you know, as a guy it's hard because as long as we take care of ourselves, we don't have to go through giving birth. You know what I mean? Although we do have to live with women, I made me, maybe it just all kind of washes out. I Dunno. Anyways, I think they will roughly my age. Um, and also I wasn't in like a, I was in Phoenix. Uh, Phoenix is a, yeah, there's enough plastic surgery there that people give a shit what they look like. Some of these cities should go to like they, you know, like do you ever like watch old movies or old TV shows in the 70s and you'll see somebody or you look at a picture, what are your favorite actors when they're 25 it's like, dude, that guy looks like a 40 year old. Like what 25 used to look like compared to the way it does now? Well, when you go to smaller towns, those people age, the way people use to age, like Lucille Ball going from I love Lucy to the Lucy show. She looked like she did it 40 years later. She went from having this really nice voice and be like, Ah, myth demoed a, I like fucking smoking camel on filters. Whatever the hell she did. Um,

Speaker 3:          00:09:29       I dunno,

Speaker 1:          00:09:30       but anyways, what the fuck is my point is that these ladies come walking up. All right. I could have just said they were about my age. Right. Which means to fucking old. So they would just say, hey, you know, you said in that question you, you, you know you wanted, I was saying guys, you need to be honest. And they was, I think they, I think what happened was I think that they didn't like what I said about the woman that found out she was banging this guy who had a wife and family. I don't think that they, I don't think they'd like the response to that. So they came up cause they seem like they wanted to make me upset

Speaker 1:          00:10:04       cause they came up and they will go like, yeah, just to let you know, just to let you know, she, she didn't laugh once. She didn't laugh once and I laughed because that's funny, right. I was just like, ah, I'm sorry. Right. And she goes, yeah, I liked you to stand up but that podcast, live podcast, I don't know about that. And I went like, oh all right. And she goes, yeah, cause like I didn't laugh once and I was like, all right. And then they were going like, yeah, and you said to be honest. And she didn't laugh once. I was just like, all right, cool. So I mean, what do you want me to do? I mean, I had an hour and 20 minutes to make you laugh. I didn't make you laugh. I mean, I'm sure as hell not going to do it standing there. So I don't know what they were looking for. And they just kept hammering that fucking point going, you said, he said, you want an honest, we're just being honest. I said, I appreciate it. It's fine. You know? And then I finally just said, look ladies, like everyone else was laughing and then I kind of made a motion around the woman who wasn't laughing. I was like, I can survive this. And they all went ooh. And I was like, I wasn't shitting on her.

Speaker 1:          00:11:13       I just always look at it like the president of the United States. Okay. Like I went in there, there was like four or 500 people there. One person came up and said that they didn't like it. So just to make round numbers, we'll say 399 out of 400 people enjoyed it. Okay. If a president or a senator had that level of approval rating, I mean it would be unheard of on fucking heard of. So I'm going to walk away thinking that was a win. And um, you know, I dunno, they just, oh, they just kept coming over and be, she didn't like it. She did not like it. And that's the greatest thing you can ever do when anybody criticized you, just be like, hi.

Speaker 3:          00:12:01       Okay,

Speaker 1:          00:12:01       no wait. I want you to feel the weight of me not liking it. Um, I should have asked, just giving her a refund. Why would you pay for the ticket sweetheart? All right. Tell you what, I'll make a deal. I will give you that money back and whatever else it takes to get these fucking hands away from me. Good Lord. I'll, I was trying to think, what did I say that made them take it to that level? Because there's no way if they were with some guys, I would think, all right. They got dragged to the show and they were like, who is this fucking animal now? That's happened to me a million times. And then I sheepishly apologizing. It's like, sorry, I'm a moron. Um, but they came there by themselves, which means they liked me before they went there. So either she truly,

Speaker 4:          00:12:51       yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:12:51       didn't laugh once, truly did not like it because she just didn't think I was funny or somewhere in there. I pissed her off. I think it might've been that, you know, I'm going to say, uh, it was either the married woman thing, the ovarian cancer, the dead first wives in the snow and Aspen, I'm going to say somewhere in there, she decided that she needed to tell me that she didn't last once. Didn't laugh once. I have to do tell you, it kind of made my fucking night though. Um, every once, and I can't say every once in a while. Well, it is every once in a while now because I don't go out there, but man, I, oh, oh,

Speaker 4:          00:13:39       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:13:39       Oh God. I had some fucking, I can't, I'm so old. I can't even remember the amount of fucking times. Especially a lot of women too cause I went to a bad period but a good, I dunno, I'd say like 12 year period out of my 25 just really trash and women and that just really was just my fucking issues. Um, I'm trying to think what the fuck. I didn't vaguely remember being in North Carolina and this woman was walking up to the table and it was fucking hilarious or boyfriend or husband was like holding her back. He lived, he was water skiing behind her. She was drunk or whatever. I can't remember what the fuck she was saying cause it was such a spectacle watching that guy trying to hold her back and she was like climbing forward.

Speaker 4:          00:14:28       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:14:28       It, you know what it looked like. It looked like, you know, like wartime footage when they like split up families. It looked like she was trying to get back to her child. Like, that's, that was the level of effort that she was making just to come up to me to tell me how much of a fucking moron moron she thought I was. And, uh, that was a good night's comedy club. I do remember that. I just don't remember what I said or what she said.

Speaker 1:          00:14:57       I had that one, this is weird. They're all coming to their like, faceless, like they're like, you know, like when you watch like psycho, when he comes in with the knife and you can't see his face, spoiler alert, he can't see his face. Um, that's what they kind of looked like to me anyways. I don't want to dwell on this shit any longer, but, uh, anyways, if for whatever reason, if that woman who didn't laugh once is still listening to this, uh, I dunno. I Dunno what you want from me. I would, you know something, I would go to the all things comedy network. We have plenty of podcast. I'm sure there's something else that you could find there. By the way, the podcast network, uh, the all things comedy podcast network, uh, the first annual, um, podcast festival was a smashing success. We got rave reviews from everybody came out.

Speaker 1:          00:15:44       I really want to thank everybody. And then also Ari Shaffir who was just sort of the mayor of the podcast festival where he got in Thursday, he jumped on everybody's podcast. He just, was he just the fucking greatest guy ever. Um, so anyways, with that, how can I go this far into my podcast and not mention the first world championship ever by the Houston Astros? How great is that? That was such a great thing. That was as great to see as it was sad for la. Yeah. I'm telling you, you got to hate that somebody has to lose a game seven. It's just brutal. I was actually sitting there thinking how cool it would be to actually see magic Johnson. He's got an NBA NBA ring and a world series ring. This eight. Does anybody a sports nerds? Anybody know anybody out there on both of those rinks? I'm thinking back in the day, maybe somebody won the football and the baseball, that was like a big thing for you or two sport guy in those sports didn't really overlap that you could possibly win two titles. Um,

Speaker 1:          00:16:50       but uh, I don't know about a fucking stomach is growling, trying to stay in shape, but like a three more days in this fucking movie. So you want to fucking days. I actually, I if she brought in a Caesar Salad, I'm going to say that one more time. A Caesar's salad. Okay. And I always want to do that because I love when people start yelling at you about the amount of calories and the dressing and the crew tones and Yada Yada and all of that fucking Shit and how you might as well have had a steak. Um, I think all of that is bullshit cause you still have the lettuce with all the fucking, you know, pesticides on it, you know, I mean that's a decision you have to make right now. Do I want to eat a cow that ate another cow, was with hormones in it or do I want to eat this thing that was sprayed by DDT or whatever the fuck is in this shit. Um, the end of the day, if you're gonna eat bad, if there's a fucking salad,

Speaker 1:          00:17:53       I mean I'll go with the, the cancer has pesticides as probably worse to eat one of those things. But I don't want to hear this shit about the fucking dressing. I didn't want, I didn't want to fuck, I don't hear a word about that. Okay. Cause I know I feel after I eat as fucking Caesar Salad versus how I feel if I eat a steak, you know, with a couple of sides, the fuck Outta here. That's it. That is it. I'm fucking grabbing at my pants. Like Matt Foley and I, I'm, I have a gut for like three days after that. Um, I know it's all fucking bad for you. It gives a shit. I just need to hit the elliptical. Um, I started my physical therapy for my rotator cuff, a injury finally. I don't know why it took so long. Like how long have I do that?

Speaker 1:          00:18:40       Goes through these exercise three times a day. I go, when should, when, how long should it say skies? When I was six weeks typical German, Irish, stupid freckled cont I've been dealing with this for a year and a half. Like an asshole. I could've just gone to somebody, a goddamn physical therapist. This says, yes, we deal with this all the time. This is what works. Do this see in a week. So I'm very excited. My shoulder actually feels a little bit better. Um, although being out in this Iowa, whether, fortunately I checked, um, I check the weather before it came out here, cause I wouldn't, you know, live in La. You don't think it's just endless summer out. They sometimes you forget what time of year it is. I actually brought a peacoat out here and I gotta tell you it's fucking killing my shoulder to put it on and off. Um, had to have dean helped me put my coat back on after we ate the worst fucking, the worst fucking meal I've had since I was with Dean del Rey again when I was in Wyoming and we ate and this little diner and I think though the short order cook wasn't there that day and I ordered two eggs over easy. They can't, they were like clear.

Speaker 1:          00:19:44       It looked like fucking breast implants with Yolk in the middle of it. What? This fucking Guy Brian. I still ate him cause I was hungry. I remember the waitress came by, she was just like, was, was that all right? But I was just like, yeah, it's fine. And um, this time we were walking a, I can't even tell you the name of the airline that we fucking took in here. I don't even know the name of it. It was, it was a play on like Air Force One, like the president. Hang on one second. Let me see if I can find this shit. Ah, fuck you. Pod. All right. Hey, we go, here we go. And if the, what the fuck is it? What the fuck is my, you don't want, I didn't want us on the plane. I deleted like a hundred fucking text messages, you know he had that thing like, oh my God, I can't delete it. If I delete it then I don't have the thread like you're trying some case. I just started deleting a of them, you know, it felt good. All right, here we go. What is the name of this fucking thing? Air Choice One.

Speaker 1:          00:20:55       You know, we couldn't even pre check in for this thing. He had to walk to the gate. We were in Minneapolis and it was just like, we just kept walking. And why don't know why we didn't take the little monorail thing. We just kept walking and walking it in like concourse B, which was like you went down some stairs and walked underneath the fucking tarmac or some shit.

Speaker 5:          00:21:15       Yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:21:17       take it over to this other side. And uh, but it was still cool as shit. And then when we landed in like the mid city airport, I think that's what it's called. I don't know what the fuck it's called, but it was a coolest Shit airport. You just walk right in to gate agents. This like 12 chairs down near the baggage claims. I love little airports. Um, anyway, so we were, we were on our way over there and I had the worst fucking

Speaker 1:          00:21:50       food that I've had since when I was in Cheyenne, Wyoming. And I know that place is better than what it was. I just went there on a bad day. I'm not shitting on Wyoming. I'm not shitting on Cheyenne. Alright. Um, I got the meatloaf with the mashed potatoes. All right. And Spinach and a, and I went here, we talk about red meat and starch. Everybody knows it. Shut the fuck up. All right. I like potatoes with the meat. I don't give a shit. So they put this mushroom gravy on top of it. I swear to God it tastes, I don't know, it tastes like somebody just took an aerosol can in sprayed it. It had like a chemical taste to it. It was so fucking bad. I was like, Dean tastes tastes. It seems just, you know, just like, what the fuck? I was like, I know.

Speaker 1:          00:22:38       Then you know what fixes everything. What is the duct tape of food? Huh? They give you are in construction, right? If you have a problem Ducky, right? You take out the duct tape, you fucking, you know, wrap it around a few times and you're fine. What is the duck tape of food? Everybody, we all know it. We all love it. Salt, salted the shit out of it. Salt couldn't even help it. I had to go for ketchup. I had to put salt and up on this fuck, I just finally had a tap out. Um, and I always, whenever the waitress comes over says, how was the food? Even if it sucks, I say, how are you going? He was, see, she, I always at, I always say it was good. It was good. Thank you. Um, I even said it was good when I had the breast implant fucking eggs over easy. Right? And this was the time I was going to be like, if she asked me how this is, I'm going to say this is, I'm just going to say this tastes like this is like, I dunno what, like like homeless, like some homeless guy soaked his feet in it.

Speaker 1:          00:23:41       Like I was actually, she's sitting there waiting for the waitress to come thinking, how can I accurately describe how fucking horrific this. And if you're in Minneapolis in Minneapolis and you're going to take air choice one airlines, there's a fucking restaurant right to the left, right before you go down the escalators of don't get the meatloaf with the gravy. All right, spoiler alert.

Speaker 5:          00:24:09       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:24:11       Oh my God. What was it? Chemical is the only way to describe it. It wasn't like, what is that ingredient? You're like truffle oil. Truffle oil is fucking obnoxious. It just, it just overwhelms anything that it's on. It's never always there. Truffle oil in here. It's how much truffle oil is in this fucking thing. It's undeniable. This taste. I, I, you know, I wish I could've brought it to one of those cooking shows. You know, all those fucking guys would like a, and when and women, they got like those pallets go. Okay. Okay. Um, I'm tasting a little Oregano. Um, uh, there's chocolates or like those obnoxious cigar videos with those Douche bags, those fucking Douche bags

Speaker 1:          00:24:53       sit there smoking a cigar. That is one of the most like, ah, the morning most ignatia stinks you will ever see put on a youtube video and watch a guy do a review of a fucking cigar. I fucking hate. I hate when they see there's Cha, I'm tasting chocolate. It tastes like chocolate in the smoky fat. Fuck. What did you just go to friendlies? You need a Jim Dandy. Who the fuck tastes chocolate? What do you, you fucking smoking one of those cigars that they have dipped in like that sugary shit you've ever had. Some fucking guy with his sweet tooth gives you a goddamn cigar.

Speaker 5:          00:25:29       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:25:30       You gotta go like the dentist the next day. All right. I gotta I gotta pick this up. I gotta go. I'm actually a couple of minutes later, I gotta go. Um, when I, when I returned, I will tell you what it was like to perform at the legendary surf ballroom for me. It's going to be an hour and a half for you. It's going to be a mere second and a bag just like dead, just like that. Two seconds. So your life a good fucking uh, I don't know what that was. Three, four hours of my life. I just performed at the serve ballroom, clear lake, Iowa. Um, unbelievable. One of the coolest and and also like a spooky spookiest places I've ever performed at a,

Speaker 5:          00:26:16       okay,

Speaker 1:          00:26:16       so here's the deal. You draft your pull up, it looks like,

Speaker 1:          00:26:22       it looks like it's front of the 1950s you walk in the exact same door. They all walked in and there was this little green room area. It looks like they used to be a bathroom back there too. They kind of just got rid of that and they had a couple of sinks, I guess that they use to some shit. And everybody's autograph these walls. And I'm sure that that's, this is like the fifth time they probably painted over and probably paying over like once every decade. And they just keep like these big people, like a Willie Nelson, Merle haggard, Waylon Jennings of course. And then all these other people I saw, you know, all the guys from like skid row, bunch of bands that I knew from the eighties and nineties, early nineties, that I used to listen to faster pussycat, all of them. Uh, who else? Just a whole bunch of people. So anyways, you go out there and I'm telling you, man, it's like this giant, it looks like it's not a happy days. And what they did is they had the original stage and then, uh, they built out from the original stage. But some woman a number of years ago actually had photos from that night and she found them all these years later. So you can actually tell where the stage was. So I made sure when I was up there and I walked all the way back to what they have, like the phone where Richie Valens and buddy Holly made their last phone calls. It's really, I mean it's, it's, it's, it's this weird thing of like, like, uh,

Speaker 6:          00:27:52       an incredible part of history and like really morbid.

Speaker 3:          00:27:56       MMM.

Speaker 6:          00:27:58       I Dunno. And I'm always interested in that type of shit. And then it's also weird, like I went to Elvis's house and I remember going in there, I was a young comic and I wanted to go in and laugh like, yeah, look at his shag carpet. What the fuck's up with Elvis? And it went in there and I actually felt bad after awhile. I was like, I mean, I mean this guy's house, this is what this guy used to chill out and shit. I feel like,

Speaker 1:          00:28:17       you know, this is a,

Speaker 3:          00:28:21       yeah.

Speaker 6:          00:28:21       You know, and then the end, you're walking by his grave and shit. It's like, can we just leave this guy alone already? Cause they haven't, they made enough fucking money. And then you go across the street, there's a gift shop. They literally made a cuckoo clock, you know, said it looked like his, his hips will move it and shit. Um, but the way they did it here, it was very like respectful, but um,

Speaker 1:          00:28:39       it's Kinda hard to not feel like a little bit of a ghoul when you go there. I'm a little bit of a go. I don't, but death is, is interesting. You know,

Speaker 6:          00:28:48       dead rockstars are interesting. They're all right. And I was interested in, I went and I got to perform there and stand on the stage. It was fucking amazing. And uh, everybody coming out in the show was fucking crowd was awesome. I'm telling you all you fucking elitist liberal cons, who live near an ocean, you'd think you're fucking, I dunno what you really missing out. All right. And all you redneck fucking, uh, my pig one first fucking blue ribbon and the fucking who gives a shit contest. You're missing out by not going out into the coasts. The rights everybody fucking grow up cause there's fun to be had out there. You know what I mean?

Speaker 1:          00:29:24       MMM.

Speaker 6:          00:29:26       You know, it was funny when I was on the plane ride over, this woman's going, I was like, she's like, it's one of the most friendliest places. Everybody waves alone and everybody's just really friendly out here, you know, of course my head, I'm thinking, yeah, if you're white,

Speaker 3:          00:29:41       I'm not seeing

Speaker 1:          00:29:42       a black guy can't come out here. But if a certain amount came out here, you know, and they weren't going to fucking play for Iowa or Iowa state, that'd be some issues. Um, you know, it's, I don't know why, but that's the way the world is. All right, let's, uh, let's do a little, uh, oh yeah. And then we came back to the hotel and ran into this fucking guy and he came up to me, he's going to let people keep saying that. You know, I look at, look like it, I above me and he's fucking shit faced. And I was just like, I would take that as an insult. I go, you're a better looking version of make it just, you know, big, tall drunk guy. He just compliment just fucking whatever he wants to hear. Get him the fuck away from me. Right. But he's still a funny guy and he just, he was very like a talk with his hands and shit. He was just this giant 20 years younger me with hair.

What you think it would, they would have been like, like wouldn't have gone down in history as, yeah, they would have sounded like the Hanson brothers had started smoking time to be wasted and put here that those satin major Rhett fucking outfits on. So they sang a song called the yellow submarine.

Speaker 7:          00:56:14       Pre drugs though, isn't it? No, no, no. There is a definite line when they discovered drugs and it is so apparent and now someone is telling Paul Mccartney to lay off the pot. Yeah, I'd still have a a, some of this and I'm still one little puff and all of a sudden a brain cell gets hit and it's a brilliant song coming out. Remember me? Yeah. Smoke your pot. If you're hot. She's pitching at him. Find another beetle. Go ahead. Go ahead. That's amazing. I wonder why he, he is he too pussy to go? Um, let's, let's, let's, let's be honest. He has see this house you're living in and that was because I was smoking pot with my pals, smoking pot and doing a lot more. I would just leave me, I came down, I would just be, I'll be in the house and go off and answer.

Nobody, no one's hot enough to be missing a limb when I'm, I'm, I can get, I can he, I bet you Paul Mccartney could get a 21 year old dude that you buy South beach. This isn't even an issue that you have to say. I bet you he can. This Paul Mccartney, the Beatles, this, these, there's only two left. They just sit there right when she's, when she's talking shit to you, you just, you just shake your head back and forth like, hmm. And you just look, keep looking at her until she said so. And she and you just keep doing this. You'd shake her head and look at it. I didn't look at a foot once again for Theresa. Just something. She can't sit up. He's looking to go and which one is it again in a second. Then knowing it and then knocking on the fake one. I'm, hello. I'm a Beatle. Bitch. Who fills your closet with left shoes? Paul?

Hind hindsight looking at where they went. They came up with that as like they came out, they were like in sync, but they rise. They were the boy band of Liverpool. Bigger than one hit wonders when that fucking came out though. They were super famous. They would done. Yeah. That stuff was, if they didn't, if they didn't listen to Peter Noone listened to Peter Noone stuff who didn't progress on Tuesday. Um, Henry the eighth and the eighth. He was. He just dumb.

Speaker 6:          01:03:32       Hey, what's going on? It's Belper and it's the Monday morning podcast for Monday, November 2nd, 2009 can you believe that? It's November. Oh my God. Where's this year? God, Jesus. Every year it goes by faster. I know. I always do that joke, but that's what everybody says. Can you believe it's November? Yes, I can. You know what gave it away? October. That was the big hint that fucking November was coming up. You know Halloween. I remember that. I know that's on the 31st so yes, I can believe and yes, yes, it does go by quicker. Obviously it goes by quick. I think about it when you were a child, you know if you were four years old, if a year went by, that was 25% of your life. Yes. So it definitely dragged on. Plus you had two giants telling you what the fuck to do all day and what to eat right?

Speaker 6:          01:04:33       Well, when you're 41 years old, a year goes by. That's like a, it's kind of math. I can't do, I don't know what that is. What does that one, one 80th of my life. You know, it's funny, it's actually Sunday night right now and I just settled down to do the podcast. I had the apartment to myself and I'm thinking, all right can bang out a nice hour and all of a sudden the windows open and I hear somebody driving by listening to this song. This is how we do it. It's Friday night, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. I'm like, who the fuck would still be listening to that music? And Lo and behold, it's the woman I share my life with polling in, listen to a song that sucked when it came up. Bullshit you to that station all the time. All I want to do with chromosomes.

Speaker 6:          01:05:24       Yeah. See he listened. He listened to all of that shit. Listen, I'm going to punt. I'm going to get satellite radio so I can listen to really bad hair metal and you can know what the fuck I was listening to. You know what you smell like right now? You smell like that overpowering air freshener that you put in the fucking car. I smile. It's something different. What do you smell like? Huh? It's, it's, I dunno what it smell it get away from me. I've got to do a podcast. I can't be smelling smells. What is it? What's the name of it? What? Exotic fragrance and get away from me. I said, okay, well then I'm going to stick with that. Then gather your belongings and get out of the room. So you guys, this is how you handle a little more and they deliberately act moody.

Speaker 6:          01:06:06       You just said get away from me and I'm really, really wet. No, I didn't. I sit in a comical way. If I see if I'm holding a microphone with an orange fucking wind screen, you can't take it seriously. You can not take it seriously. It was being an asshole. Yeah, I do. I get away with it. What I would want to, because I'm running shit. Get out woman. Go make me. You see here, which will make me see which, oh, beat it. Come on. I want to talk about Halloween and how I thought we had the fucking the best shit on the block. But yeah, he's fucking assholes up the street. All right, let me back up near. You need to walk so I can tell this story. All right. You and your fragrance need to get out of the room here for a second. Okay. She just smelled her rest. And guys, I like it. I had Jaya as in,

Speaker 6:          01:06:59       oh, that's how you keep it fresh people. It's the fights and then the, the making up and whatnot. Um, why did I just do that to, cause I was annoyed. I thought he had the apartment to myself, so I just decided to be a Douche. So there you go. I'm Douche bag of the week. Um, I pulled it out the last seconds. Um, anyways, so for Halloween, and those of you who are longtime listeners of the podcast know that I, I'm, I'm kind of into Halloween. I like it. I decided to embrace the holidays a couple of years ago, rather than just being like, dude, this is fucking bullshit. It's just to know the core be fucking strategy. Gimmes Buma fuck Molly. Um, I find just said, you know what? Fuck it. So, um, you know, last year, if you guys are on my myspace page, so I'm sticking it out there. I have pictures of the Pumpkin I carve last year at carved an ACDC pumpkin. That was this shit. Okay. It was the shit and this year as like, how do I top this? And, um, I was trying to think of the scariest thing I could think of to carve into a pumpkin. And I ended up carving the, uh, the Federal Reserve Bank.

Speaker 6:          01:08:11       I know I'm going crazy. I can still smell that fucking fragrance. It's overpowering, whatever it is. Oh God. It's awful. Jesus smells like flowers and soap all at the same time. You know, one of those things individually, they're good, you know, like brushing your teeth and orange juice, but if you put them together, um, so anyways, yeah, carved the Federal Reserve Bank. It's the fucking shit. All right. Uh, go on to my myspace page. I've got a whole picture of it, you know, and then I fucking made pumpkin bread afterwards and I fucking toasted the seeds. I was like a native American, you know, after I killed the Pumpkin, I used all the parts. I took out the Pumpkin's Achilles tendons. I made a fucking jump rope out of it, you know, and I looked out the window, I saw some trash and I got a little teary eyed.

Speaker 6:          01:09:05       And that's what I did that I just used the crying Indian hacky reference. That was funny. Way Back on VH one. Standup spotlight. Do you guys ever used to watch that? And the old people out there, the standup spotlights when they were just scraping the bottom of the barrel of anybody remotely left. Funny from the 1980s half the people on there were like substitute teachers. They had chalk on the back of their pants come in a little so deal. Ooh, fucking a racers and they'd some hour making money. You know, what am I talking about? So anyway, so not only do I have the Federal Reserve pumpkin cause I figured, you know what? Anybody can try and scare the kids. You know who, who, whoever tries to scare the parents. That's what I, that's why I decided to carve the Federal Reserve Bank and did it fucking three d style. It's the Shit I had flames behind it actually tried to carve.

Speaker 6:          01:09:56       We own you in reverse writing. So it would come up against the wall. But I failed just because I don't have, I don't have the tools. All right? All these assholes who are making these fucking insane pumpkin's. Half of these comments, they just go, you go on a website and you just buy something. You just trace it and it tells you what to do. You don't have fucking third grader could do it, you know? And then you get all these, all these little double edged knives and all his shit. I had a, I had a fucking paring knife, the same knife. I used to cut up an apple. I carved in the Federal Reserve Bank. Okay. And I was going to have, we own you, but that part fail. But whatever. So I had that. And then I also had, I had full size candy bars. You had your choice.

Speaker 6:          01:10:39       If you came to my house on Halloween, you had your fucking choice of a Hershey bar without nuts. Cause God knows all these fucking pussy kids are allergic to everything he can't have all month. He has almonds. It countered back balances his Prozac and then it's just crazy until Wednesday really, lady, did you ever think you should have died and not had a kid? Wow. Wow. That was mean. It's not what I was trying to say, but I was, I was trying to, Sam's talking about natural selection there that uh, whatever's in you was so fucking weak that your kid can't even have nuts. You know what I mean? I mean, every, everybody's allergic to getting fucking stabbed. But when you're like allergic, I can't have food. You shouldn't be alive. All these fucking people, all these lactose intolerant fucking people clogging up the highways. All of you.

Speaker 6:          01:11:33       You should not be alive. You're only alive because, uh, Jesus Christ, I already talked myself into a corner. Why Bill? Why are they alive? Because of modern medicine. They're just using you as a fucking revenue stream. All right. Who's kidding? Who? I would've been dead a hundred years ago. I would've been, I had a ruptured appendix in sixth grade. That would have been if I would've been on like a little house in the prairie, just laying there sweating under fucking 58 blankets in an outhouse is not what they did with their sick. You should just stick them under blankets. Start dabbing at their forehead. Does this make it better? No, it doesn't. No, it does. It's something inside of me exploded and now the poison is a having a party and he should take me out back and shoot me like old yeller. So anyways, I got this fucking insane fucking pumpkin.

Speaker 6:          01:12:23       All right. Okay. Anybody can, can, can, can carve in some shit that doesn't exist. That'll scare the fuck out of you. This actually exists and is actually was actually fucking everyone who's walking up the stairs, all of them. All of them should have been like, Holy Shit. That's it right there. That is the devil. That is the fucking devil. I love that Pumpkin. It looks great. It's saying something and it's scaring the shit out of me. It's working on all three levels. It is a fucking triple threat. Like, like the way people used to be in show business back in the day where they could sing and they could dance and they could tell jokes. That's what that Pumpkin Pumpkin is, you know, that's the, I, you know, whether all that was, is what I was hoping they would think. But they didn't, I didn't get one comment.

Speaker 6:          01:13:05       Why did he carve a building into a pumpkin? I don't understand. Is that a Walmart? Oh, make good. Walmart's fucking scary. You know, if somebody came with the stairs, who fucking actually tried to start a hardware store anyways, so I had fired this fucking insane pumpkin. All right. Um, had my fucking door all lit up and all that type of shit and I got full size fucking candy bars. Okay. For all these cute little kids coming up. All right. But uh, something, and this is going to be at, word's going to get out. This dude's got a fucking, you know, he, he carved a library into a pumpkin and he's got, who gives a fuck? The guy's a Weirdo, but he's got full sized fucker candy bars and the candy bars that we recognize. Kit Kat, who? Reese's peanut butter cups or fucking or Hershey, what is it?

Speaker 6:          01:13:48       Not Hershey but Hershey milk chocolate. Okay. Those were all fucking, we know what those are. So even though he's a Weirdo, it's wrapped. We understand that there's no poison it. So I'm thinking I'm going to be the shit. These kids are going to be clamoring around me like I'm fucking Dick Clark in 1965. Right. But no, I got fucked because the people up the street, they were, they went all out. This dude up the street, his son and daughter, his son, fuck head that he is now his son and his daughter put on a show like, uh, like Michael Jackson. They were doing a tribute to Michael Jackson and it was fucking insane. They had a stage, they had like monitors. It looked like a fucking rock show was going to happen and they had a show like every 20 minutes or every half hour and a whole crowd would gather.

Speaker 6:          01:14:36       I didn't even get to see it. I was down the street with my full size candy bar. Am I fucking new world order pumpkin going? Where is everybody? You know, I've got a fucking seven 11 here, sort of. This is my fucking kitchen. Looked like literally like I robbed the seven 11 and rather than taking the money I took all the candy out of it. That's what the fuck it looked like. I and I can't get a God damn fuck. I can't get anybody to come because everybody's running up the street cause these kids were killing it. You know, Neil went up there with their mom and they came back.

Speaker 10:         01:15:05       Oh my God. It was awesome. They even had the car from the fucking whatever video and he literally got in it, Blah Blah Blah. Right.

Speaker 6:          01:15:13       Just wanted to fucking slap both of them. Um, no I didn't. I want to, I was fucking pissed. I was literally reduced to yelling off of my balcony going as people were walking, did go up to go see the Michael Jackson thing. I was going, Hey, we got candy up here. We got candy up here. Right? Think about the 41 year old white male yelling down to children that he's got candy. It was really, it was really bad. But, uh, eventually I get got rid of all of it. And uh, I discovered a new pet peeve that I have. Um, I don't like trick or treaters who look like they're fucking 26. All right. You know who you are. You're too fucking old. It's not cute anymore. You know, you're a Douche. And um, the last group of people came up as was fucking unreal. His kid had a better mustache then I could grow.

Speaker 6:          01:16:05       You know, he didn't have a mustache. We know what I'm saying. If you're too fucking old. And he was actually saying she fucking hates them too when she wanted to do was have a bag of apples. And when people came up and they would do it too old, she wanted to give them apples instead of candy. I'm like, yeah, that's great. And then they get down to the front yard and they'd throw it through your fucking window. Why don't we just hand out baseballs? But I understood what she was talking about. You know, the fuck is wrong with you. How old are you? Okay. You should be going to a Halloween party trying to fuck somebody dressed like a tube of toothpaste or whatever it is. That's what you supposed to be doing. You're not supposed to be coming to my door. Fucking Yo. It was annoying.

Speaker 6:          01:16:42       I should have had a little bite size ones. Anyways, so I actually was walking my dog this morning and I was seeing all like the candy wrappers on the ground and all the fat kids that couldn't wait til they got home. And um, and um, I dunno, they will all bite size. None of them were full size. I had the best candy on the fucking block and I got trumped by this Vegas show up the fucking street. Really? I don't know, just annoying noise the shit out of me. And I also to walk my dog, I actually, I, I pick up litter because a, I think I live in a nice neighborhood and I don't like when fucking people throw shit on the ground. So I'm sitting there picking up these little candy wrappers with my God damn dog and uh, came across a milky way that that bugged me.

Speaker 6:          01:17:33       You know, we do, you know why even give out candy if he'd given out a milky way, that's such a fucking cop out. It's like, uh, I can't, I can't even fucking give a fuck about hauling. You don't Milky Way. The Milky Way is like, it's like if John Oates was a candy bar, he be, he'd be a fucking Milky Way. That's what I'm trying to say. All right. If you don't listen to fucking hall and I'll cheat and you don't get the joker, right. He, it's, it's something, it nugget new is John Oates. Okay. New get need some sort of, it needs something with it. You know what I mean? It's like a Andrew Ridgeley who some of the other famous duos that broke off and one guy just totally fucking made it and the other guy was the human fucking version of, of new get with nothing in it. Can you think of anybody else? I know fucking insync Justin Timberlake was the almonds.

Speaker 6:          01:18:36       Those other four mother fuckers. That's what they were. When Justin was in there, it was a snickers bar. You took them out. It was a Milky Way and nobody fucking gave a shit. And that was the end of them. That was the fucking end of him. Who gives out Milky Way. You know, fucking, you're not even trying. Not even fuck. I had full sized fucking candy bar and I was, I was hanging out screaming at people trying to get them to come up to my fucking place. It was pathetic. But I'll tell you right now, the pumpkin bread was to shit. All right, let's move on here. Um, let's talk about my life. What I have going on. Um, I'm trying to hype shit that I have going on, um, earlier in the podcast. So here goes this week. I'm going to be a town hall in New York City.

Speaker 6:          01:19:22       I'm not the town hall, the town hall theater. And uh, I don't even know if there's any tickets left, but I just like saying I'm going to be doing a theater in New York City. Do you realize that? You realize how huge that is for me. You know, way back in the day when I was a youngster with a big Red Afro, wondering if I'd ever get on stage in New York City just to do five fucking minutes at one o'clock in the morning, you know, and here it is, 38 years later, I'm finally getting to do a theater. Now I'm actually really excited and um, I'm doing my special next month and um, you know, this is going to be, you know, weren't basically if you go to that show or you're going to see basically my special essentially. So I got that going on and a, that's November 6th, November 7th, I'm going to be doing comics, come home with Denis leary, the 15th anniversary.

Speaker 6:          01:20:17       It's for the Cam Neely, um, the Cam Nealy House that helps families, um, of people stricken with cancer gives them a place to stay rather than sitting in some awful hospital. They actually get a nice home to stay in. So that's a wonderful cause that will be at a guidance arena with the BU terriers play. And, uh, I believe there's only a few tickets left for that one. So that's what I got going on. And later on the month I'll be in Tempe, Arizona. Really looking forward to that Gig and uh, and the rest you can go to [inaudible] dot com borr for uh, for date. See, and that's why I don't hype shit in the middle because it's not funny. It's not fucking interesting. And uh, then what happens? You're like, what? This guy's going to riff about fucking candy bars and musicians I don't give a fuck about and then tell me where he's going to be at.

Speaker 6:          01:21:04       Let me tell you guys a story. The other day I decided, you know, I really need to get my ass in shape so I don't look like a fat fuck on TV during my special. So I'm, I have problems with joining gyms because I'm always on the road. I have to freeze my membership and all that type of shit and he's, I just throw the money away. So I had been working out outside basically in my apartment. And then I do cardio outside just like that fucking guy with all the Matthew mcconaughey. There you go. You know, I do keep my shirt on and I don't run down the street with fucking palm tree leaves. Like I'm trying to fly and it's 1898. I don't do that shit. All right. But I've definitely been going on hikes. So I found this hill out here and uh, being a big football fan, I remember how Jerry Rice used to run up this fucking hill, you know, to get in training for the, uh, the NFL season.

Speaker 6:          01:21:56       And I found a hill and I've been running up this fucking thing and uh, I've been loving every minute of it. And, um, I went up to go do it and I came home and my fucking, I couldn't find my keys like an asshole. I left the, uh, my pocket open on my sweatpants and because I'm old and when I run down the hill, I can't run down the hill. I have to sort of, Gallup, that's fucking pathetic. And a, I was going really fast and I guess it kind of flew out a fucking rattlesnake took it. I don't know what happened, but I went back up to it or try and find them and I don't have them. And you're like, wow, what's the big fucking deal? You know? Why don't you, Oh shit. Did I just fucking knock something out here? What the hell just happened? Hello. Test one, two. I know you can hear this, but I can't hear myself. What the fuck is going on? Hold on. Hello. I know it's recording. What the fuck is the problem line in? That's good. Your phones. That's fine. Hello? Test. There we go. I got it back. Sorry. Jesus Christ. You know what is my fucking rooms getting so God damn hot, I have to turn on the fucking ceiling fan. Hang on a second. I can't do this all once.

Speaker 6:          01:23:19       You know, if at any sort of class, I'd edit that part out, but I'm not going to. So anyways, yeah. So I lost my fucking keys. And like anyone, any normal person, if I had a normal fucking car, oh, that's what I did. I turned this thing down. That's what happened. Ah, there we go. Hello. Test one, two. Wow. Just when you thought it couldn't get any worse. This is why it's free folks. This is why it is fucking free. Like a one man band here. I shouldn't have like symbols between my legs. How fucking easy was it to be a goddamn entertainer back in the day that, that, that that's what you could have you ever seen one of those one man band guys. It's never good. It's never fucking good when somebody does like a throwback to that shit and they get symbols between their legs and a base drum behind their back.

Speaker 6:          01:24:07       Great. And it turned the fan on too high and I'm blowing shit off my fucking desk. Um, anyways. Yeah. So I can't find my keys. And um, you know, the house keys, no big deal. But the problem was was it was also the key to my car and I drive a hybrid and it's this special fucking key. It's a special key people. They couldn't just give me a regular key where you stick it in the door and shove it in the ignition. This is like one of these keys where you can have it in your pocket and you don't need to take it out and then you just fucking reach and touch the door and it magically unlocks because some sort of wave is coming out of the pocket, going to the door lock, bouncing back off and putting cancer into your testicles. You know?

Speaker 6:          01:24:51       That's what I'm basically doing what I'm risking ball cancer, so I don't have to fucking unlock my door the conventional way. But the bottom line is you want to be, you're probably wondering, well bill, how much does this pocket ball cancer fucking Karachi cost? Evidently it's between two and 300 bucks. I remember when I bought the car, make sure you don't lose this merch. Shoot all losers cruise, of course, the to $224 to poker and blah, blah, blah. I was thinking in my head, wow, that sounds like a fucking rip off to me. Really, that little plastic thing. So, I don't know. I went back up the hill and I tried to find the fucking thing and I couldn't, once again, you know, I went up there and it's actually really these, these unbelievable houses like um, like rich people, but like classy rich, not like, uh, not Jerry Jones rich, you know what I mean?

Speaker 6:          01:25:42       Classy, tasteful, rich, you know, and I was walking down the hill and I was looking for the keys and I came down and this is fucking old guy is walking up the street and right as I was about ready to say hello to him, you know, rich people are so, like they, some of them just have, they, they have an inability to like just have a conversation. It's like I'm walking down the street, he's coming up the hill, he sees me and I'm just be like, hey, how are you? That's all I'm going to say. He just, this is what, this is how he greets me. He just goes, beautiful fall after noon.

Speaker 6:          01:26:23       I didn't know what the fuck to say to that. And he said it that loud and it took him that like he drew out the words beautiful fall after noon. You don't, what should have happened right after he said that, you know, and those, the original monster movies of Hollywood, you know, that church organ that they, you know, and then the lightening strikes, that's what the fuck should happen. After that guy talked, it's like, Whoa, what are you just naming shit that you like? Like I didn't know socially what I was supposed to say after beautiful fall after noon, um, half off Budweiser's at a teddy bar. What do you say to that? I don't know how the fuck to say to the guy and I, I just sort of went, yeah, yeah, it is. It's a nice one. Just kept fucking walk.

Speaker 2:          01:27:21       Ah,

Speaker 6:          01:27:23       with the fire, it was like, I was trying to think like, what question I could have. I don't think it was playing a board game in his head

Speaker 6:          01:27:32       or he played the first five notes, so to a song and I said, ah, what is the name of that song? Uh, tell me what is it? It's called beautiful fall afternoon. That's what it's called. Um, anyway, so I walked back up there and I just kept saying to people, edge a JD as you've, as you having to she a shed a quiche. And they'd be like, no, no, I didn't. Um, but if I find them I will, ah, and I had no information to give them and I was just like, yeah, just sort of stick them on a rock stick on a rock. And maybe I'll come walking by and I'll fucking, you know, but I held out hope. I was like, you know what, it's a park. There's a lost and found. I'll go there tomorrow in the lost and found is open. And I went there hoping against hope that for once in my life I lost something in public and somebody actually returned it, you know? Do you remember that from back in the day when I lost my cell phone, my girlfriend since I been with her has probably lost three cell phones and anytime she loses his cell phone, all she does is call it. She calls it. And not only does somebody pick it up, it is the greatest

Speaker 6:          01:28:36       person on the planet. You know, I should just call up and I'm thinking my head. Then I was going to answer this shit. It's gone. Just like mine is always gone. And then she calls, you know, one and a half ring. Somebody just picks it up. Hello. Well, yes I do. Absolutely. Come on over. I'll give it to you. I actually just bake some cookies. Come on over. I'll give you a fresh cookies and your fucking cell phone back because that's how your life works, right? I lose my mind in the back of a fucking car is fucking douchebag is driving me to the airport. I realize it like a half hour later. I know we still working and the phone is on and it's ringing in his fucking back seat and the cont doesn't answer it.

Speaker 6:          01:29:16       So that has been my experience. So I go over to the little ranger Rick thing going, oh please. Then maybe this is the one time, keep a positive attitude, put it out to the universe. I'm going to get my $200 set of keys back and of course I show up and they're like, uh, no. Nobody has returned any keys. You, if you want to check back later and get giggly, it really, really, am I really going to come back later? You know, I'm not going to come back later, so just spare me this speech or right. Just go fucking change the chances of fire sign out there. Why don't you just go fucking do that? You're like, oh man. At the Park Ranger, because I've ran with my AMF fucking sweatpants with the sides. Unzipped like an asshole, like a fucking asshole. All right. Last week I talked about this guy who I wanted to uh, flatten his nose while I, I sent my fist all the way to the back of his fucking cranium stopping just short of the hypothalamus and I was talking about fights and I'm just how when you get older you have to walk away from fights because there's no winning them.

Speaker 6:          01:30:18       There really isn't. When you get old, it's just like, okay, either a, I get out of the car and I get the living shit kicked out of me. Right. Or B I win and then I get sued. Right. And the older you get the, the the greater chance of the first one, which is w I dunno. What do you think's worse getting the shit kicked out of you? I think getting sued is worse, but as long as it depends on the level of ass kicking. I don't want to lose a tooth, but you know, if you want to beat me down, I have a headache for three days. I'd rather have that than deal with you fucking taking my money. So anyways. Um, so a lot of people sent me in some unbelievable stories about fights that either they walked away from or that they got into.

Speaker 6:          01:31:03       One of them is actually a case pending, so I'm not allowed to talk about it. So I'll basically, I'll skim over it is basically a kid is walking down the street and three drunk guys start giving him shit. He gives him shit back. They give him some more shit. And he says, Oh yeah, the guys are real tough with three. None of you would fight me one on one and this one kid goes, all right, I'll fight you. So they square off, they'd throw a few. And the though the kid who was just part, you know, the, the innocent kid connected hit the kid. The kid falls down and hits the back of his head on the pavement. He, you know, and he's not fucking moving. And the kid's like, holy fuck, what did I do? So he's kind of walking away, but he's also concerned, his big fucking mistake was he actually gave a shit.

Speaker 6:          01:31:50       And uh, then the cops showed up. He was still in sight and he got fucking, uh, uh, did they arrest him? I can't remember. All I know was in the end of it, this, there's three of them and only one of him. And he ended up getting sued and lost something about a preemptive strike. Can you fucking believe that? I was like, Oh, I'm sorry. Was I supposed to let, uh, the one guy with the two other friends, he hit me a couple times and then I was supposed to punch back is fucking unbelievable. It's unbelievable. Just A, I dunno. So there was a lot of people going like, I want to kick the shit out of this guy. What should I do? You know what he should do? He should just fucking walk away. Just walk away and just forget about the whole fucking thing. And don't even tell yourself that lie that he'll get his, he'll get his, cause you know what, they don't, they don't get there. So you know what they do is they get punched in the face. Maybe in the worst case scenario is they win 10 grant. Um, they don't, they don't. I, I've lived long enough to realize that, you know, when the bad guy gets his in the movies, that's when it happens. Okay. The rest of them go on to live very successful lives.

Speaker 6:          01:33:01       They have great looking girlfriends. They a porous raw sewage into drinking water and they find some other Dick to take the fall for it. And then they buy land in South America and they leave the country and they're fine. They're fucking fides. So, uh, you're better to just just walk away. Somebody gave me some great advice saying that, uh, the, he used to get into fights all the time. This is so simple. I never even thought of it. He just bought a heavy bag and he would come home and he would just beat the shit out of the bag and he felt way better and there was no lawsuits. And then certain days when he wanted to murder somebody, he would take a baseball bat and just slam it into the heavy bag. And he would feel phenomenal afterwards. And, uh, I, I liked, I want to, I want to believe that that works.

Speaker 6:          01:33:54       I don't know. I have an insane temper. I take it to the point of, I want to feel that other guy quit. That's how mad I am. I want to beat the fuck out of you. I want you to fight back, but I want to feel the moment where you fucking quit. You know how sick is that? That's how mad, I just can't see that getting that out with the fucking heavy bag. All right, so let's read a couple of stories here. These were very long. This was a very passionate subject. Um, so forgive me with my awful reading. Here it goes. I'm gonna read a couple of these. Um, all right. Uh, here's, here's the classic like this. This is like anger that will come out of you 20 years from now. Here's a great story here. A bill, I sympathize about the whole fight thing.

Speaker 6:          01:34:39       Um, it seems like anytime some asshole decides to start shit with me, it will happen in a war in a way that I can't retaliate without either getting arrested or sued. Literally what I was just talking about. He goes, so anyways, I was at a packed bar with some friends the other night and uh, we had gotten there about a half prior and I had about a one beer in me, so I wasn't even remotely drunk. Um, I guess the place was packed. So anyways, he's a I, she says, I'm, I was making my way through the crowd with a pint glass in my hand trying to navigate to the bathroom along the way, some scrawny little cunt who apparently has had way too much to drink, backs into me and spills half my beer and make a habit out of quickly saying, excuse me, and thank you whenever I walk through a crowd, because I figure people are more apt to let you through if you're polite about things.

Speaker 6:          01:35:31       This prick turns around and says, this is the guy who, who bumps into him and spills half his, his beer. He said, this prick turns around and says, what the fuck is your problem? And knocks my drink out of my hand. Jesus Christ. You gotta be able to take a fucking wrench to that guy's head. Um, he said at this point, one of his friends jumps on him trying to break it up while the little bitch keeps talking shit. So I tell him to go fuck himself. It was going to talk shit till the prick would, uh, would throw a punch. But just at that moment, a guy standing next to us wearing a blazer but with some kind of shirt sweater that was, that wasn't buttoned down, tells me forcefully keep walking. At that moment I figured it was one of the bouncers pissed off over having lost the drink and being insulted.

Speaker 6:          01:36:23       Uh, I head to the bathroom, my window to fight. That shit had open and close so quickly that I didn't get a chance at any vindication. When it got to the bathroom, I noticed that the guy who I thought was a bouncer wasn't, maybe he was, maybe he was this little clowns, a bodyguard, but I couldn't tell. He didn't seem like one, it didn't seem like one of his friends because the little con in his friends were all dressed the same way with designer ripped jeans and open button down shirts with necklaces and shit. Basically they all look like they were members of some eighties rock band that was still touring but couldn't get but could only get gigs in a dive bar. Um, now my chant, my choices are either, okay, now he's in the bathroom. Uh, he says, now my choices are either walk back to my group without a beer or a the bitch move of telling one of the bouncers and seeing if I can get that prick tossed out.

Speaker 6:          01:37:16       Um, I could also go and confront them, but even if I could take the bodyguard, um, what kind of person goes to a bar dressed with that ed hardy clothing with a Bodeger. What did I just miss here? Sorry. This is really fucking long and I'm seeing double here. Uh, fuck you just killed the whole story bell. What is wrong with you? Confront him. Uh, which from his size, I think I stood a good chance as long he was an MMA fighter. Uh, this was in New Jersey. Mind you. So I thought, uh, I thought considering he was Italian looking and had a girl that was way out of his league, maybe he was connected to some bullshit like that. Maybe a, the little pricky even had a gun or a knife on him because stupid shit like that is happening thing. I didn't want to take any shit from him, but I'm not about to get shot over a beer.

Speaker 6:          01:38:02       Um, anyways, it's, so that's what he ends up doing. He goes, I ended up walking back to my group without a beer and hiding my bad mood for the rest of the night. One on one with either one of those cons, I would have been fine. I'm five, 1,195 pounds and mostly muscle and I've never lost a fight. Then again, I've only been in a few. I'll spare the rest of this shit. Um, I don't know if he's asking me what I can't even remember. I just, I get a headache when I have to read that much. So you know what I mean? It's like, and do you think that little, maybe that little fuck we'll get his because he's so like I could see knocking it over and be like, dude, what the fuck's your problem? That's sort of your average asshole and a Barbara to then slap it out of your hand.

Speaker 6:          01:38:41       He's got that Napoleon thing where he's got something to prove, I guess. Um, I dunno, my question is, what do you do with that anger? What do you do with that fucking anger? Anyways, his and Alon, Bill, uh, you were talking about this week about nearly getting into a fight with dead Dick and the green sedan. Well, I admit that this wasn't anywhere close to me fighting. It was still a fucking horror story while it happened. All right, here's one here that will leave you with a lot of anger. Uh, I was about six months into my standup career and a friend of mine asked me to do a show with him at this bar that paid him a, that pay would pay $20. I was psyched because it would be my first page show. I did the show and got a decent amount of laughs.

Speaker 6:          01:39:23       I thought I did fucking horribly, but uh, if they left then I'm not going to complain. So he gets paid his money. The next day I'm walking, I'm walking home from school and I'm cutting through the basketball courts where a drug dealer, I know we'll call him drug dealer number one is sitting there with one of his friends, the friends he was sitting with kind of look like ghost face killer, but he had a stare of a potential rapist. Next thing I know, I'm passing this guy and he stops me. He tells me that if I don't give him my wallet, which is visible, which was visibly in my front pocket, he was going to just stop me and take it. He takes it and empties my lunch money. Luckily, or I thought, luckily I kept a special 20 and a different compartment. Now, this is a lot of things a lot of comedians do, or people who when they, they set off on a dream, the first amount of money they get, it's usually not a lot of money.

Speaker 6:          01:40:13       So they either frame the check or they save the dollar, the five bucks of the 20. So I'm imagining that this is what this young comic was trying to do. So he kept a $20 in the, in a different compartment. I said, well, he rummaged through the entire wallet, put back my large library card, the illiterate cunt, and eventually found the $20 bill. He threw the wallet my chest and asked me why I lied to him when he asked me if I had any other money than any other money than the lunch money. I actually told the, the guy mugging me the history of this hidden $20 bill as he goes. As I just typed that last sentence, I just imagined my head slamming into the keyboard. Um, he says, what a, what a fag. I was, um, so anyways, this motherfucker told me that if I told him a good joke, maybe I'd get the $20 back.

Speaker 6:          01:41:05       This is really your inexperience as a comedian because there's no joke you're going to be able to tell. So anyways, here we go. He said, well, I used to tell these off of one liners when I first started because my self confidence would dwindle left at 10 to 15 seconds. So I stammered out, stammered out. I knew this girl is so stupid. The only reason why she knew her ABC's was because of hepatitis. So then the drug dealer, he faked laughed like a fucking maniac, straightened up into a serious face and was just like, get the fuck Outta here.

Speaker 6:          01:41:39       Wow. Ah, Jesus. That'll age you about fucking eight years. Anyways, the rest of it, needless to say, I took it like a bitch, but if this story didn't have a punchline in and of itself, here's the kicker. Literally less than a week later after this incident, this drug dealer from, from my school, big black kid with a voice like Mickey Mouse, it's a fucking spectacle. Tells me that drug dealer number one stop hanging out with the ghost face killer guy because he's an undercover fucking cop. So this dude got mugged by an undercover fucking cop. So for all you, for all your talk about getting screwed by corporations, that's the worst case of being deep dick by the man that's ever happened to me. And then I realized in retrospect that even though I lost the first remanence of what I'd hope B would be a successful career, the losing of my first $20 was well worth the story.

Speaker 6:          01:42:34       I still hope that cop is shot in the line of duty, in skull fucked by a gang of junkies. See that? That's the fucking anger. That is the anger. Um, I dunno, I dunno how many listeners I have at this point cause I don't really hype this fucking thing and I never bring it up at shows. Are there any, uh, psychologists out there? You know, psychologists, like they know what to do with anger. It's fucking sweater wearing douche bags just sitting there. They're loafers. He ever go to therapy. He's to fucking tell him shit. And then just like, Whoa, what do you think? You think that, what would happen if you would do something like that? It's just like, it really is. That's all you got. You know, they just basically get you to pour out all your shit and then you've got to sort of figure it out.

Speaker 6:          01:43:23       I don't even what the f you know, it's fucking hilarious. Had been in therapy for a while now obviously it's not fucking working. I'm anyways, this plow ahead here. Um, did I talk about this last week? Somebody sent me a, uh, somebody sent, oh, somebody sent me a, an email and was talking about my, um, why are they like now? I hope it's, this podcast has been loud enough. I think it is. Um, somebody sent me an email talking about some new movie coming out and in this subject, the thing, the, the line in the movie, the lion on the subject line said another save the black kid movie and it said bill from various clips on Youtube. I know you have some disdain for racist movies. I was just wondering, what's your feeling on the new one coming out with Sandra Bullock called the blind side?

Speaker 5:          01:44:15       Yeah,

Speaker 6:          01:44:16       I guess it's about her helping some, a black kid. All right. First of all, this is what I love about this email is, um, and this was something that I've learned in standup comedy is you ha you can't control how people process what you say. Um, I've never done a bit about another about save a black kid movies. The name of the bit was, uh, white people are evil movies. That's what it is. And I don't have, obviously I have disdained for racist movies, but like what the fuck movie was I talking about in my last special, that one about the black swim team. Uh, what the fuck was it called? Poolside. I can't ever remember. What was it called against the tide? The fuck was that movie called whatever. Whatever that fucking movie was called chlorine. What was it called? I did that job for like fucking a year on stage. If you guys seen that new movie came out, labile blots. I can't, yeah. Trying to jog if my, I have no memory. But anyways, that movie is not an example of a racist movie that's a movie about race.

Speaker 5:          01:45:24       Okay.

Speaker 6:          01:45:24       And, uh, you know, this is just a podcast listener. So what the food, you know, I'm not really going to give this guy shit about that, but I've actually had people write reviews about my act and says, and was describing some of the stuff I talked to be talks about the difference between men and women. Uh, he does racist jokes. He does. Bababa it's like, I don't do I do racial jokes about race are racial jokes.

Speaker 5:          01:45:53       Okay.

Speaker 6:          01:45:53       A movie about race is a, is a, you could say it's a, I guess a racial movie or, yeah. You'd say that it's not racist. A racist movie would be, um, I dunno, that's a fucking good example of it. What does it good? I mean, Mississippi burning is not a racist movie. It's a movie about racist, but the movie itself is not racist.

Speaker 5:          01:46:17       Okay.

Speaker 6:          01:46:18       It's about race relations. Right. My out of my fucking mind here. That. What's that fucking one of the original Hollywood movies where they have white dudes dressed up in black face and then make it black people look stupid and that is the message of the movie. They're not, they're not doing a movie. They're making fun of white people who do that or talking about white people who do that. They are. That is the message of the movie.

Speaker 5:          01:46:43       Yeah,

Speaker 6:          01:46:44       that black people are stupid. That is a fucking racist movie. See the difference? What the fuck is the name of that movie? What the fuck is the name of that movie? Did you begin with an h? I have no fucking stop talking on my cell phone. I'm getting, you know what I'm not doing. I'm fuck my cell phone. That's it. It's over. All right. The fuck is the name of that movie. All right. Forget it. Forget it. I fucking give up. I have to fucking, I got to look it up now guys, this is something, if you can hear it, my voice, this is actually something that's fucking scare in me is that I'm starting to lose my God damn memory. Somebody actually made a the fuck is it? Okay now you know what, with a fuck is it?

Speaker 5:          01:47:41       Yeah,

Speaker 6:          01:47:42       I really should edit all this out, but I'm not going to do it. I'm not going to do it.

Speaker 5:          01:47:47       Okay.

Speaker 6:          01:47:47       Why am I saying everything twice? You know why? Because I'm trying to find something that somebody sent me. Okay.

Speaker 5:          01:47:54       Okay.

Speaker 6:          01:47:54       They sent me a nice little MP3 remix of the thing and I had it all queued up and I can't fucking find it. You fucking asshole bill. You really are an asshole. You fucking worthless. And this is why you have to fly out to fucking Omaha at some point and tell some jokes. You know what I had last week, I made fun of Omaha saying how I wasn't going to do a show in Omaha. And people were like,

Speaker 6:          01:48:19       you know, I said eventually I would do one, but I was making fun of how many fucking airplanes I would have to take to get there. And I got like five emails from people. Actually, there's a direct flight from fucking Gig or Duke or do you? You're gonna land in a fucking cornfield and you can just say it up fucking stage right? But in their bill, people in Omaha don't talk like that. I don't give a shit. I know they don't. Johnny Carson was from Nebraska, wasn't he? All I even remember about Nebraska was doing college gigs out there and you drive halfway across the state in, in, in you driving across 80, which goes the length of this, uh, east west. Here's something that truckers know. Do you guys know this shit? You know, if you're on an, an even numbered highway, that means it goes east, west.

Speaker 6:          01:49:00       And if you're on a odd one, that means it's north. South. Did you know that? Huh? I'm talking about highways. So don't even hit me with though. We'll route one goes away. Shut up. Not talking about roots. I'm talking about highways isn't another thing. If you're on, if you're on a highway, right? Let's just say it's 95 and you don't have a map all right in your, and you see all of a sudden there's a four 95 or eight to 95. What that means is you are coming towards a congested area and if it's during rush hour, you can jump on the two 95 of the four 95 and it will basically eventually re hookup with the highway. You're on 95 when you can avoid the traffic and not add to it. They did that one truckers. Um, it's like an la the four or five you got the five goes right through the heart of La, the four oh five when it goes out around Santa Monica.

Speaker 6:          01:49:55       But there's so many fucking people, it doesn't make a difference out here cause they're all jammed. All right? That's how much I know this fuck. That's how much road work I've done. So you get on the fucking 80 and you get about halfway across Nebraska. And if you're like me, you're doing a college gig in the middle of the winter time. So all the crops are cut down. All right? And you can't tell where the fucking dirt ends in the sky begins. It's just all fucking gray. And all of a sudden out of nowhere there's like this wooden bridge footbridge or some native American Indian shit.

Speaker 6:          01:50:31       You know, I just, you know, many times I drove underneath that, I don't know what the fuck it is racing back to either flying out of Lincoln or Omaha trying to get back to catch my early flight and I would literally be driving like a maniac and I be looking out to the right and there would literally be like a flock of geese in that V, that v formation. You know the one that daffy duck was like, fuck this. I'm not going snow flies. Don't bother me. You remember that one? I'd be seeing that shit. I drove 80 I believe I drove 80 in Wyoming and I saw a kind of antelope, I don't even know what the fuck it was. I had no idea what the fuck it was. Just saw like species of animals that I didn't even know fucking existed in this country. 70 I remember 70 I've drove. I've driven that one all the way from la all the way right into New York City. You get it all the way to about Jersey and then you've got to fucking switch it up. It's fucking brutal. Ben, on all of them, 90 95

Speaker 6:          01:51:37       I think. What is 35 go from Houston right up to Dallas in the fucking insane. Then all of a sudden, the years later I'd be up in IB in, in like Iowa gone out. It's just the same fucking highway and you take from fucking Houston to Dallas and it goes right up the heart of this fucking country. Isn't that fucking interesting? Um, yeah. A lot of fucking roadwork. I was supposed to be searching for the email and actually just lean back thinking about those fucking days being out, you know, many times I did Coosbay Oregon I think like three or four fucking times. Every time I went down there that God damn seals whenever out they had this thing where you could actually see the seals sunning themselves, which was fucking amazing to me at that point because I lived on the, I lived on the east coast, you know, when the fuck do you get a chance to see that? You know, I just cannot, I cannot find this fucking thing. I have to find you. This, this clip, this person send this MP three he did a remix to a song. I'm trying to kill time because I can't fucking find it. Hey Bill. Hey Bill. Go Fuck Yourself. Read this. She can't. This is what, these are the emails I get from you guys. That's not it.

Speaker 6:          01:52:51       File recommendation, Shithead Bar, fight story.

Speaker 6:          01:52:58       Uh, it's a, it's a mission. Now give me something else to talk about. You got anything? Any questions? This is when I, it, it kills me that I, that I don't, I don't have any callers because this is what the fuck happened. I'm quitting after two more emails I have, you know, it's not, I'm going to be worth it by the time I find it isn't the payoff. It's not going to be worth it. Hey, did the Phillies win tonight? Please tell me they won. I've never given a fuck about the Phillies until now. I just can't stomach the fucking Lakers and the Yankees are going to win it this year. You know what I mean?

Speaker 2:          01:53:32       Yeah.

Speaker 6:          01:53:32       Jesus Christ. To fucking Yankees. What a team, Huh? What a fucking team.

Speaker 6:          01:53:39       What a fucking team. A Rod, Rodney third [inaudible]. Jesus Christ. Jesus Christ coming up to the plate and the Yankee sign him for one year. They actually, uh, they actually is suspended there. No facial hair rule with him. Johnny Damon's a little upset, but you know he is the son of God fucking cunt. You fucking rich. Cons. He called that an accomplishment. You win a world series. What? Cause you got the most fucking money. There's no, there's no skill in that. There's no fucking skill in that. You fucking pieces of shit and they actually have, you know what? I can't stand about Yankee fans. They actually had the nerve to be nervous during the playoffs when they cut to the crowd and like, oh Geez, I hope this hundred million guy can do it. If he doesn't do it, maybe to share her, we'll deal with you fucking cunt. You know, I hit about the fucking Yankees.

Speaker 6:          01:54:35       Whoever beats them the year before, whoever their best guy is within two years, he's on the team to share a beat them last year with the fucking angels. Now he's on playing first base. I've already bitched about this shit. Who gives a fuck? Right? It's just fucking baseball. You know what I've been actually doing, I've been watching the NHL network. I actually just watched something about the 1979 Montreal Canadians winning the Stanley Cup. You know what the worst thing about watching the kid and he's winning the Stanley Cup back then, is you knew that there was going to be some sort of heartbreaking Boston Bruins loss and 79 I was too young to remember it, but I just remember people bitching about it. We basically beat the Canadians for games to three. And then with like a minute left, they called too many men on the ice, which is basically, uh, I'm trying to think of the fucking, it's, it's, you know, like in football when somebody a kicks, because somebody calls for a fair catch and you've got to give like five yards, you gotta give the guy five yards. So he can catch it and I, you know, people break it all the time. They never call it if the other defensive player gets in face that that's like calling, making that call with one minute left to decide who goes to the Stanley Cup finals. And then the fucking flying French Fox ended up scoring a goal and then they got the overtime goal. It was just fucking annoying. It was annoying to watch, but they did beat the rangers. So that made me feel good. Um, I think that's it guys. I can't find this fucking thing.

Speaker 6:          01:56:07       This guy did a remix of that song, uh, that, that, that data bup, bup, bup, bup, Berlin heart, heart hat. He did a remix of that. Me saying [inaudible] can't, can't and I thought it was cute and I just, I, for me, I can't find it. What was better? The fact I just sang it for you was that decent.

Speaker 6:          01:56:26       All right. I give up. That's it. Jesus Christ. What a fucking horrific podcasts. But you know what? I did get it out Monday morning. You know what? I want to thank everybody. I am. We've been getting a ton of emails about people got a letter from a postman who just walks around listening to my podcast as he delivers the mail laughing like a maniac. That's what everybody keeps telling me. They keep listening to them when they're supposed to be doing their job and they're just sitting there laughing like a fucking maniac. So why? I know this one was a little fucked up. The volume was messed up, but that's what you get. That's what she get. Somebody sent me an email going like, you know what? I'm so pissed. I've been listening to Opie and Anthony for awhile and I had no idea that you a podcast. What the fuck?

Speaker 6:          01:57:06       This is what he said. He said, I've been a fan for several years. Uh, duty. Your appearances on the OPN, Anthony show a being the lazy shitbag than I am. I've never checked out your website until a week ago. How has the podcast not mentioned on Opie and Anthony? They actually, they have mentioned it, but he said, do they forbid that or something? No, they do not. But he said, I guess it's none of my business anyway, but I'm pisses me off. You've been doing it this long, two plus years, and now I'm just finding out about it. I've already listened to the last three months of podcast and we'll continue back until I've heard them all. Um, you're, you're a really funny guy and it's a shame this podcast is flying under the radar. Well, I say this to you. It is not a shame that it's flying under the radar.

Speaker 6:          01:57:47       I liked that. It is, I don't hype it. You find it, you find it. If you don't, it's like fight club. Right. Except you don't have to be a bad ass. First rule about the podcast is not that you don't talk about it. All right. You know what the first rule is? Is that you don't take the podcast seriously. That's what it is. Like this fucking guy tore me a new asshole about rugby because I was shitting on rugby. This fucking guy sends me this whole, we are a few weeks ago, he made some disparaging remarks about rugby is compared to American football. Every stop to think about how look illogical and ludicrous it is to call it football when you don't use your food. He's giving me like Jerry Seinfeld Shit. If memory serves, you said something to the effect that those rugby pussies would be getting, wouldn't be getting up if ray Lewis put a hit on him.

Speaker 6:          01:58:37       You know what dude, I stand by that statement, but uh, I know I already you email, but for all you fucking limey cuts over there and fucking England. The reason why shit on rugby was because the English cont who wrote me was shitting all over a fucking American sports. So obviously you're not gonna treat me with respect. I'm going to make fun of fucking rugby and your little booty short, Larry Bird short shorts from the 19 fucking eighties, and how every fucking 10 minutes. You have to basically stick your head up some, uh, uh, somebody else's ass as you guys tried to do that elephant trick of kicking the ball out the back. Totally respect rugby. I think it's a fucking awesome game. I've seen it on TV. It is the shit and they have literally bone jarring. Lose your filling fucking hits all the time.

Speaker 6:          01:59:23       I do think it's a great sport. I do think people are tough, but you know, if you're going to shit on American football, I'm going to shit all over your sports. That's how it works. Please do not take the podcast seriously. I don't fucking read. I do it by myself. As you can tell what the different levels of volume this week, I'm not organized. All right? So that's the one and only rule. All right. Don't take it seriously. And if you can remember, tell somebody in if not, don't, because I think the smaller this thing stays the cooler, it's going to be named one fucking thing that has blown up and, and stayed at the same level of quality. It doesn't, it doesn't, you know, you want, I want it to be like this. I want to fucking, I'm gonna be down in the Fox hole.

Speaker 6:          02:00:07       You know, if I, if I had this thing actually ever fucking blew up and I'm, and I'm, and I'm doing rants about saying unacceptable, then these fucking other cons. We'll figure out that. That's what we're saying. We're saying unacceptable. Then the whole game plan is over and then what I'm doing here is fucking useless. Right. Wow. Did I just go off in a fantasy there where this thing became the biggest fucking radio show ever? I think I just did. You know, that's what happens when you sit here by yourself. You'll let your dreams leak out and then people make funny and then you feel silly. Um, all right. That's the podcast for this week. That was a fucking mess. All right. It was a fucking mess. I'm going to, you know, I think it kinda got back on the rails afterwards, but it was a mess.

Speaker 6:          02:00:53       You guys, if we were on ESPN first came out and they should sell those fucking rednecks, they'd race in the mood. Remember that they turned their tractors into these, uh, I dunno what the fuck they were, but they would, they would race through the mugged. You'd get bogged down. That's what the fuck it was. I was at redneck sitting in that tractor in the mud. I like how I had to explain that. It sucked. Like he didn't fucking notice. That's it. All you guys have a great fucking week. And um, that's it. That's the podcast for this week. And I've, uh, talked myself into a corner once again because I usually end with have a great week. That's what I usually say. And then I continue talking and now here I am down in the fucking murder again. Um, hey, has anybody seen that come? I'm sorry to keep talking. If you guys seen that commercial where they got the fucking, uh, they're trying to help you out of that financial, you know, all these people in financial difficulties. Um, AH, fuck. That's what I was going to talk about. God dammit. No one's listening at this point. I'm going to, I'm going to waste this story. I went to the supermarket. Okay. And I don't wanna I don't use those little savy save cards that they have. Do you ever a little savvy saved card? And I always say no. Would you like one? No, I wouldn't.

Speaker 2:          02:02:05       Okay.

Speaker 6:          02:02:05       You know, because basically what you're doing as a free fucking survey, remember that shit so they can figure it out. What you can't live without. So they can jack up the price of that food and then give you like nickel off of like their version of corn flakes. So I went in there, okay. And they asked me if I had to sit in their little safe card and I said no. And he said, do you want one? I said, no. And The lady goes, it's okay, I'll just punch in a code anyways. So she punches in a code and I get money off anyways. So it's like they even figured out a way to figure out what I'm fucking buying even when I'm saying go fuck yourself to the safe thing. So I think the only way to get around it at this point, I'm going to try it next time is I'm going to walk in with cash and just have cash and see what the fuck they do. You know, they did it to me today, it may see. So I went out there and I bought some towels and I bought some beer glasses. That's what I bought Macy's. And they say, do you ever, do you have a Macy's card? I said, no, I don't. We'll give you 25% off every douchey thing you bought. I said, that's okay. And she goes, it's all right. I'll give you the discount anyways. And she types in this fucking code.

Speaker 2:          02:03:08       Yeah,

Speaker 6:          02:03:09       I dunno what they're up to. I really don't know what they're up to, but I know they don't sit around trying to make less money. Does anybody know what the fuck that's about? That is your homework for this week. If you still listened, if you listened this far, you fucking hate your job and you need to get a new one. All right? Don't hurt anybody at work. All right, that's it. Now I'm done. Everyone. You have a good week. I'll talk to you next week.

Speaker 4:          02:03:33       Ooh. Oh. [inaudible].
