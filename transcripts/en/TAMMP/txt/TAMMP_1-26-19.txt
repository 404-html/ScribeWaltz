Speaker 1:          00:00:00       Hey, what's going on? It's bill burn his time for the Thursday afternoon. Just before Friday, Monday morning podcast. And Ah, just checking in on you. Hey Bill, what the fuck? Why are you checking in on us? So fucking late this week, dude. Ah, what'd you have a fucking hernia? Is that what happened? What did you, did you get hit by a car? Uh, no. I, I, it's been the most difficult podcasts I've ever had to record you guys. I need a startup for my emotions. Um, honestly,

Speaker 1:          00:00:36       honestly, uh, uh, I don't know what happened. I fucking, I got real busy and then I recorded the podcast and for some reason there was no audio. I can't figure out what the fuck I did to my Miksa. Oh, I did something. All freckles did something. So this is my second attempt. The last attempt was, believe it or not, I believe it was on Thursday hours on Wednesday. I swear to God the dog ate my homework. That's literally what I'm telling you in a podcasting way. Um, so I'm back to a, one of my original mixers here. Thank God I didn't throw it out. Thank God I'm a bit of a pack rat you guys. No, actually I didn't want to throw it out because I was going to give it away to somebody. What I wanted to do. That was the thing I was going to be like. Do you mind? You realize the amount of times a semi known comics said the word cunt into this mixer, mixer, mixer. And I thought it'd be worth something to somebody that they would take it. Um, but I never got around to doing that. And thank God I had a backup mixer. Ah, that's the level that I'm bawling at right now.

Speaker 1:          00:01:41       You got to mix it, buddy. I got a mixer and a backup mixer. What the fuck do you got? You know, if they still had MTV cribs right now, I would be on it would lifestyles of the rich and famous. They have one and a half mixes. Um, all right, it's Saturday, Saturday. All right. And Moe freckles has been, uh, alcohol free for nine miserable fucking weeks. It's actually, you know, something, I'm at the point now, I don't even give a shit. I don't think I think about it occasionally, but now when I think about it, I think, but why would I go back to that? Huh? Oh, Billy booze face sitting back enjoying himself after a long day of hard work of performing words that other people wrote. Do you guys realize, realize how hard it is to be an actor sometimes to just show up and say things that people already said for you on a piece of paper.

Speaker 1:          00:02:38       Um, that's one of the reasons why this week's a little crazy. So I got a little acting gig over the next, uh, week or so, and a mon general hospital. Um, no, and I'm not allowed to say everything. You're not allowed to say now because you've got all these fucking cops. Everybody tries to figure out what you're on and then they start, I don't know what they do. And then somehow they know what you're doing before you even shoot it. That's like the level of technology. Okay. If you actually say what you're acting on and somebody's listening to you on a podcast has a drone with one of those Gopros, somehow they will know what senior doing, but the next day before you are, before you do

Speaker 2:          00:03:18       okay,

Speaker 3:          00:03:20       speak in a drones. Do you know that the next level of Uber, the next level of lift, the next level of fucking is early to fucking, there's only two of them either take Lyft or waste. It's like back in the day when there was VHS or Beta and everybody chose VHS. So think about that. The next time you're going to get in a car with a stranger.

Speaker 2:          00:03:44       Huh?

Speaker 3:          00:03:46       Um, there's a bunch of weird movies coming out now that I don't understand. You know, this is a fucking documentary right now in, in, in, uh, in Sundance.

Speaker 2:          00:03:57       It's,

Speaker 3:          00:03:58       I can't, but I glanced at it quickly. I think it said it was four hours long. It can't be four hours long. It's a documentary about two now adults who said when they were kids, they allegedly got molested by Michael Jackson. Now I gotta ask you this, why the fuck would I want to sit down and watch that? I'm going to sit there with a bucket of popcorn and some fucking junior mints. Alright, let me hear the worst story that can happen to a kid. You know, you know, some people say, oh, they just do it for my, I don't know what the fuck happened. I wasn't there, but let's, you know, true or untrue. I don't want to listen to those stories. What kind of a fucking person wants to fucking sit down? You go to the movies, you know you're going to get something to eat and you're sitting there at the cow. Oh, what do you feel like indulging in? Before we listened to this horror?

Speaker 2:          00:04:58       MMM.

Speaker 3:          00:05:00       I don't know. But when I go back to, I think when I saw Schindler's list, I believe I was eating popcorn. I mean that this certain movies, they should not, you should not be sitting there stuffing your face with food, right? We now have a documentary about the genocide in Rwanda and out of respect for the victims than you fat Americans will be allowed to eat over the next two hours. Aw, everybody fucking groans. Hashtag hypoglycemic. Um, anyways, so they, they uh, getting back to the drones, the next level of Uber is that they're actually going to have, I swear to God, like unmanned

Speaker 1:          00:05:44       drones, I guess none of them really mad right now that you can get into like a life size one, like a human size one.

Speaker 2:          00:05:51       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:05:51       And you get in this fucking thing and you fly over the traffic

Speaker 2:          00:05:57       like

Speaker 3:          00:05:58       a, like I do when I fly one of the Helio type copters and I have to tell you this, you are out of your fucking mind. If you remember with Lasik eye surgery when that first came out, do you remember that? And that'd be a couple of fucking people go, oh my God, I can see it to the future. But like one out of every 15, we'd be like, Mike, what did you, I'll never see again. Yeah. There's going to be the first week of Lasik eye surgery version of that.

Speaker 2:          00:06:31       Okay?

Speaker 3:          00:06:32       I want to know how in the fuck the FAA is going to fucking sign off on that one. You know, God damn well there's, it was a glitch that hatch just blue. You're going to have the Gus Grissom fucking, something's going to happen. You know it's bad enough that you're going to have the person up there careening down or falling down to their death. You're going to be sitting there fucking watching NFL Bup, bup, bup, but a bad app in a fucking hipster. It's going to fall through your goddamned ceiling. Tight jeans and all.

Speaker 2:          00:07:10       Okay?

Speaker 3:          00:07:10       You know, Hitler youth fucking fade with the A, I know how to make shoes by by hand. Beard that he thought he's going to have is going to come fallen right through your fucking ceiling. I don't know. You know, you know, you'd think if fucking people like Elon Musk or trying to figure out a way to drill through the God damn earth and now they're going to have unmanned, unmanned people, unmanned people, unmanned devices, flying people around up there. You take it. Some people at some point, Jesus Christ, the kid speak, somebody would addressed the fucking population problem.

Speaker 2:          00:07:53       Okay.

Speaker 3:          00:07:54       Signs. You have too many people. Uh, we're going to have unmanned drones flying people over densely populated areas. Hey everybody, you have cell phones, you have laptops. How many times? What? What's the longest they've consistently worked before you had to refresh it or shut it down or restart it or take it over to the apple store. So one of the geniuses get, be like, oh, oh, I find the, I found the problem.

Speaker 2:          00:08:29       Yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:08:30       People in aviation, you can't hit a refresh button. Okay. Yeah. They refresh. They refreshed by hosing off wherever the fuck you crash landed. Let's refresh this scorched earth. Um, and then it will be like, well shit, they installed like horror struck today when to hipsters from several lake. We're trying to get from silver lake out to Santa Monica to go to a craft beer tasting fucking festival, whatever the, whatever the fuck it is they do to go to a pocket watch convention yet. And then love followed through some fucking, you know,

Speaker 2:          00:09:12       yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:09:13       Not paid in a month. Air traffic controllers. Fucking a irony struck today. Um, I dunno audio, you're out of your fucking mind and I also got to think it's going to be at least 300 bucks per trip. That'll become some elite thing. And then there'll be like, you know, we have to have affordable on man. Droned why you saying unmanned bill? You know why? Because man learned how to fly not women. And I'm sure when Hollywood does the fucking next bio pic of Orville and Wilbur, it will be like, well, why can't it be Orval in Wilma? And they'll make one of them a woman and they'll make some sort of backstory that one of them actually identified as female just so they don't get yelled at on Twitter.

Speaker 2:          00:09:58       Okay.

Speaker 3:          00:09:58       Or Villain Wilma. We're very proud of this, that the real story of fucking Devil's island, whatever the fuck they call, wherever they, they actually, where they learned how to fly is like some devil's something or other.

Speaker 2:          00:10:12       Okay.

Speaker 3:          00:10:12       No, I'm sure there's some Jesus fucking group out there. Jesus Freak Group. We'll just talk. Okay. That's why you pay you right now. Let's swap. Flight is evil. Ain't you ever read the story of Icarus flew too close to the sun and his and his winged is wing base caught on fire and he went all the way back down to earth and he continued to fall to earth through the earth into the pits and the flames of hail.

Speaker 2:          00:10:41       Yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:10:41       Um, I dunno what I'm talking about and I don't give a shit. I'm just contractually obligated here to give you guys some sort of an effort for 30 minutes. Okay. That's what you get. Not to me. Oh, by the way, speaking of efforts Sunday, tomorrow, Sunday,

Speaker 2:          00:10:55       okay.

Speaker 3:          00:10:55       Whatever. Fucked. January 27 2019 this is the, this is the soft open of a sports world without football for the next six months. This is the one,

Speaker 2:          00:11:09       okay.

Speaker 3:          00:11:09       Yeah. Gift. Giphy can, you know, God bless ESPN. God Bless Fox sports the way, the way they're going to be. Keep yammering on on Sunday as if something sports wise is actually happening in football. What? Down here at the trade and Kevin Rob Grad Caskey is, is touching his left hand to his right fucking clique. Rob, you find it harder to reach to the right one with your left hand or the left one with your right hand? I'm sorry rob. Gronkowski he's not answering questions right now. I mean, who the fuck is going to sit around and watch that? All right. They used to at least have the goddamn pro bowl.

Speaker 2:          00:11:48       Okay.

Speaker 3:          00:11:49       They had something going on. Um, but that's it. People. There's only one more week of NFL football and there's only two teams left. All right, one left. So you have to ask yourself, who are you inviting to your Superbowl party?

Speaker 2:          00:12:07       Huh?

Speaker 3:          00:12:09       Are you going to have the balls to fucking only invite sports fans? I guess if your team isn't in it, why do you give a shit? Why not be social? You know what I mean? Why not have a bunch of people come over who don't give a fuck? They're just there for the Burgers, the Doritos, the fucking hot dogs, the stupid dips, that fucking thing that somebody made that nobody really likes. But they bring it every year and everybody's got to take at least one fucking bite out of the thing and be like, ah, it's even fucking better than last year.

Speaker 3:          00:12:48       I think. I'm thinking, I'm toying with the idea of having people over. It's going to be a select few. All right. And they will come in in unmanned drones and hopefully not fall through the fucking roof of my house. That's what I'm hoping. That's what I'm hoping happens. Now, why the fuck is this? This seems like the sound is down low on this one. At she says, Christ, who knows who the fuck knows? I just want to thank all the brave men and women who make the mixers out there who are fighting for my freedom and defending this country against terrorism. How's that dude? How much longer is this government shutdown? Gonna lie. This is like the most fucking petty God damn like.

Speaker 3:          00:13:33       And I don't understand too why if the government shuts down, okay. Uh, air traffic controllers and people like that. They don't get paid, but politicians continue to get fucking paid. I bet. I'll tell. I'll go out on a limb here. I'll bet. Because there was some sort of legislation that a fucking politician paid somebody to come up with and they all fucking agreed and they all agreed to be, I guess we will continue to get paid those fucking filthy counts. I still don't understand how somebody could actually be a Democrat or Republican when you watch behavior like this feed actually just fucking sit there, you know? I mean I don't know when I'm going to sit here and I'm going to, but I'm going to do now is do what every fucking cunt does, which is I'm going to state the obvious without a solution, you know, and act like I am above you. All right. That's what I mean. I do that in general.

Speaker 3:          00:14:31       Just part of being a former part of getting on stage, part of being back and waiting for your name to be called and feeling that rush of excitement that can only be describe to someone else who was taking the stage. Um, you know, when you speak into a microphone, there's this, you just feel like you know things. All right? And I apologize to all of you poor people out there who never in your life where you know the thrill of not reading and simply turning on a device, speaking into a microphone, recording yourself. You know, I felt bad for you. You know, I respect all of you. You know, you put your pants on one leg at a time. You know Joe Sixpack Shuggie you get through at least four beers before you physically abused the woman in your life. You know the regular joes out their lunch pail, Larry, right? Ham Hock Harry, you know, fucking Capri Sun, Sandra Capri Sun. Where the fuck that I pulled that out of that. I don't know. I never, I never got into those fucking juice is back in the day. I'll add fucking weird shit. People used to eight. What were those things during lunchtime 30 fucking years ago in the cafeteria I'd go to, it would literally be what they call it, fruit rollups. Okay. You said this shit, fruit roll ups and I swear to God it looked like wax.

Speaker 3:          00:15:56       These people would just fucking just be, I don't know what it was. It was, it was some sort of fruit and fused flavor with like a pound of sugar. And then, uh, I dunno, earwax from fucking workers in a third world plant or some shit. I don't know what it wasn't. Kids would sit there and eat. I mean, you know what? Nobody died. Nobody died. And, and, and the world was actually was in a lot of ways, was a better place. I'm not saying we were as progressive as we are today. Some would argue overly progressive. And when I say some, I would say a lot of the voices in my head would say, I think we're going a little too far with this shit. You know?

Speaker 4:          00:16:39       Okay,

Speaker 3:          00:16:40       well you start giving actors shit for acting.

Speaker 4:          00:16:44       Okay.

Speaker 3:          00:16:44       Why are you pretending to be something that you're not a, because it's acting that that is what acting is. Okay. If you, if you take an acting job and you just act what you already are, that's not really acting, which is why so many people have done a decent job be and what they are on sprayed and then everybody thinks they can act. Oh, I can act.

Speaker 4:          00:17:08       Okay.

Speaker 3:          00:17:08       Acted z Z. Remember when that chick from hall, that crazy drug addicted chick from whole played the crazy drug addicted chicken, that fucking bitch, she was unbelievable as it crate that crazy drug addicted chick. I couldn't leave out. Well, she played a crazy drug addicted check, let's say in every crazy drug addicted woman can then go on screen and there is a certain level of fucking towel, but k, but don't put yourself on the same level that my left foot guy,

Speaker 4:          00:17:34       okay.

Speaker 3:          00:17:35       Guy Walks around acting like Abe Lincoln for a fucking year before he's actually a Blinken. Okay. Then you're going to just come in and play heightened version of yourself.

Speaker 3:          00:17:43       What am I doing right now? I am describing my acting career. Um, anyways, how much time is that? Oh Jesus Christ. It's like fucking, you know what's hilarious? It's like five 50 in the morning and I got up to go to the gym, I got to, I got the acting Gig also happens today. I just have a later call time. So I was like, I'm going to get up and go to the gym. All right. Cause I'm uh, trying to get myself back in shape here. Right? So I remember the old gym song, I go to the gym every day. It's just become pop me life. And if you don't want to be a fatty, you go to the gym every day. You can't have big body. I called them every day. So I don't go every day. I take one day off. Right. I figure even if the Lord needed to take one day off when he was creating the universe as I'm sculpting

Speaker 4:          00:18:36       this

Speaker 3:          00:18:38       flower covered colored body.

Speaker 4:          00:18:42       Okay.

Speaker 3:          00:18:44       Do you know how you know something? All of these minorities out there with their pigment bitch moaning and complaining. I asked you this as a privileged white male, do you understand how difficult it is to get shredded when you were as transparent is me. Okay. I could be in just as good as shape as some Hawaiian. Okay. But because I am so pasty, the world is never going to know it. And do you understand how difficult it is for me when I walk out into the world it's like, Hey, I have a couple of abs too. You just can't see them.

Speaker 4:          00:19:23       [inaudible]

Speaker 3:          00:19:25       I want to get that Janet Jackson stomach makeup where you just said, you know, get one of those people that you know when you almost have abs and they just spray paint them in. I want to do that.

Speaker 4:          00:19:34       Right.

Speaker 3:          00:19:35       And then I'm going to do, put on a half shirt and do my dance cover of miss you much. I miss you man. Oh miss you much. I really miss you much. Um, I remember I had a crush on her when she was on different strokes. I didn't like her when she was on uh, good times. You know what I mean? And not because she was younger with baby fat and you know, cause we're basically the same age. Uh, it was because she was broke. Okay. And I'm not, I'm not trying to get with some, yeah, she was living in the projects then I liked her better when she was, you know, on different strokes, you know, interacting with super rich white people then then me as a little white kid could relate like, all right, oh now the world dove move to the beat of just one drum. What might you may not be right for some. Um, all right. That was inadvertently

Speaker 3:          00:20:48       one of the funnier things that I've said on this podcast, but I'm sure someone will take it in the wrong way. What are you saying? You can't fall in love with someone because they live in the projects, projects, projects. That's exactly what I'm saying. That is how privileged I am. You know, if women can go into these fucking single buys, these meat markets, and one of their first questions they ask you when you run into them is what do you do for a living? You know, how much fucking cake are you putting on the table? They're swinging Dick. Why? Why can't I choose? Why can't I choose my TV crushes?

Speaker 4:          00:21:28       Huh?

Speaker 3:          00:21:30       That's how I was. I was an elitist with my TV crutches. Crushes, you know, fuck all those bitches on the Waltons. But I would fuck anybody on Falcon crest and cloning though, man. Now they'll world doe boom to the beat. Just one drove a bunch of rich white people throwing each other in the pool in evening gowns. I've never seen that one. Is that when Joan Crawford in Morgan Fairchild had their infamous cat fight, you know?

Speaker 4:          00:21:59       Yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:22:00       That I think gets reenacted on floats during the gay pride parade in every city. Isn't that what they, isn't that required that you have to have one stereotypical thing. All right. Gay People, gay men, let's, let's do what straight people think we're into, which let's appease them so we can try to be a little more mainstream this year. Oh Man. That different strokes on when, when it gets in your fucking head, you just can't get it out, you know? But it's enjoyable. Everybody's dead. Except the due to played Willis. That's kind of sad. A guess. I died next. I think I'm the same age as Willis Willis. Drummer booboo boo. What is covered? He's on the only one left alive. Yes, he is. Yeah, that's a, you know something. That's what I do when I watch me TV. I try to see like, who's the only guy left? Oh, that's a great fucking trivia thing.

Speaker 4:          00:22:58       Okay.

Speaker 3:          00:22:59       Name TV shows where there's only one series regular is still alive. Different strokes. The Beverly hillbillies. Wait, [inaudible] the fucking, uh, the dude, you know, that's how you, right now, that's how that shows you right now. How hard show businesses. You know what I mean? Because in the real world, women outlive the men. All right? But this business is so fucking difficult

Speaker 4:          00:23:27       that

Speaker 3:          00:23:28       I would say that doesn't make any sense. Does it? Well, let's see. Well, the one chick overdosed and then the housekeeper, she was like 93 when they started shooting that she fucking crushed it. She had a great act in career. You don't, she had two shows that made syndication. She was on a, she was on, uh, the facts of life. You take the good, you take the bad, you take them both in there. You have the facts of life, you know. Do you know why that song was at that tempo? Because when you really just slow that down, that doesn't make any sense. You take the good, you take the bed, you take a both and there you have the facts of life.

Speaker 3:          00:24:11       It's like, wait, what? That doesn't mean anything. Okay, but you speed it up, take the goods to take the bed. You take a boat and there you had the facts of life. Oh, that's catchy. I don't feel like thinking the facts of life. Um, I know what you thinking. Hey Bill, you're wife is black. We ended today on that show. No, I was not. I like Joe. Joe The mechanic. I liked her riding the dirt bike, the fucking tomboy. I like Blair at first. You know, at first I like Blair, but there was just something so fucking wholesome about her. After awhile I was just like, yeah, Jesus Christ. Can you imagine the fucking look? She be given me a weekend to this. You like how I'm entertaining the fact that a young freckled me could actually dated Blair from um

Speaker 3:          00:24:59       Oh is that fucking show. I just said it. The facts of life. All right. I don't have anything to talk about. Something to tell you about my TV crushes. All right. Back in the day. MMM. I would occasionally watch Charlie's angels because even back then I was so sexist that I couldn't get over the fact that I was watching these, these women all made up running down the alleys, tackling these fucking guys into trash cans. You know, having said that, I obviously liked Farrah Fawcett, right? But I was a Kate Jackson Fan. Okay. She was sort of the first Demi Moore, I feel, you know, the fucking Brunette with the smokey fucking voice. And then the best was when she was on the rookies.

Speaker 3:          00:29:36       Do you know what I did this morning? I woke up this morning. I had a dream that one of my

Speaker 4:          00:29:42       relatives was on a boat that sank

Speaker 3:          00:29:45       with like 200 fucking people and they were all missing. And somehow I was in the ocean but still in my house. And I found my loved one and they picked her up and she was face down. And when I turned her over, she started crying and was coughing and she was still alive. And I came in,

Speaker 4:          00:30:06       okay.

Speaker 3:          00:30:07       And I think I talked shit, I talked to the other rescuers, I said, beat that. And then I realized she was still alive and I started crying. And then I really just started wailing, crying.

Speaker 4:          00:30:19       Okay.

Speaker 3:          00:30:20       And I walked by my mother and she just went, Jay says, Bill, like I was crying too much.

Speaker 3:          00:30:31       I don't even get supported by drapes.

Speaker 3:          00:32:07       it doesn't feel right and we all went out bag in my broad, it just doesn't feel right in my cock, you know. Well what kind of balls do you have? I got those medium size ones, but for some reason they weigh down my ball sack is if it's not a quality ball sack, you know, like I feel like if I had a quality ball sack, the weight of my balls, they wouldn't be mid thigh. It actually makes me know, do they end plastic surgery? Am I going to see one of the male Kardashians down there and

Speaker 1:          00:32:40       get a ball talk, a ball sack Tuck,

Speaker 2:          00:32:43       you know,

Speaker 1:          00:32:45       do you have a wrinkly ball sack? That is so 2018, come on down and get botox, Gabby a balls, botox. Just listen to what these women have to say. I never used to lick my husband's balls, but now that it's so smooth and not Harry, I'm down there every night taint. Um, all right. That was my nod to David Cross and Bob Odenkirk. One of the hardest I've ever laughed in a sketch show

Speaker 3:          00:33:10       is when they did that fucking sketchy about the guy with the giant Tate in the porn industry and how they were, it was, it was not that sketch. I didn't even hear that sketch. It's the way they went into that sketch where they had like a Batman style fight. I can't really remember what happened, but like, you know, they were doing the freeze frame on the, on the, on the punches, they go pow bef, you know, slam. And then the last one, this dude looked like he kicked the guy in the balls and it just said taint. And I was fucking screaming, laughing because Tate was in the white world, a very not known reference at that point, if I remember correctly, that came out of the African American community,

Speaker 2:          00:33:56       you know,

Speaker 3:          00:33:58       taint pussy tape balls. It's the taint. Right. And that was new to white people and I was not ready for, I think Patrice told me that one and I wasn't ready, uh, for that to be coming out of that show. And I was screaming, laughing, and my lady at the time who was Caucasian, she didn't know what I was laughing at, but I was left. You know when somebody laughs so hard, even if you don't get it, you start laughing. That's basically what happened. And you know what

Speaker 1:          00:34:26       just happened there? You just listened to 34 minutes of my bullshit. I gotcha. Again, motherfuckers. All right. That's the podcast. Have a great weekend. You can't, there's got to be a little music

Speaker 8:          00:34:36       Telenor, Lou here, and then you're going to listen to another 30 minutes of a greatest hits Thursday afternoon. Just before Friday, Monday morning podcast possibly released on Saturday. They made a [inaudible] came out 10 years ago, eight years ago, or fucking eight minutes ago. I don't know. I don't pick them. All right, I'll see you on [inaudible]

Speaker 4:          00:34:52       Monday

Speaker 1:          00:35:35       morning. What's going on? It's built birth. It's the Monday morning podcast for Monday, January 24th, 2011 how the hell are you? How are you doing? Did you have a good week? Was the world nice to, yeah. Uh, this is a big day for me. Everybody. This is my 100th day. And when I said I was knocking off the booze because I was starting to have a big bloated face, I was like, fuck this. I gotta I gotta you know, gotta get on the treadmill. I got a knock off the booze and I was trying to beat my previous record of going 75 days and this time I said, fuck it. I'm going for an even hundred. And uh, the goal has been a chief JF JF Javed. Um, I'm site, I did it and a, tonight I'm going to the Bruins la kings game down at this stable feda the most unfriendly fan fucking play she'll ever go to. The haves, the really haves and the have nots. I broken it down for you before you got all the corporate seats down low sit next, Diane Cannon, Jack Nicholson and fucking sissy space sick. Whoever the fuck else is down there, all those Douche bags sitting there with their fucking faces yanked back. You know, by the way, how long has Jack Nicholson had going bald for? It's just fucking unbelievable how long it took for that guy to go bald. He lost one hair a day since 1972

Speaker 1:          00:37:07       so do you have any notice that there's certain people, it just takes for fucking ever, unless they seamlessly went into a toupee pay, but he's bald. No, but you know, being someone who's balding myself, you know, I pay attention to that type of shit and I pay pet tension. All these motherfuckers, I see the receding hairline and all of a sudden it's not there. The next movie, and I was like, day you go look at that guy. He went out and he got himself sort of a scalped in a user friendly way and then they reseeded the front. I going out like that. My goal in life, I want to look like Clint Howard.

Speaker 9:          00:37:45       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:37:46       Woo. It's not going to end good for me. Uh, yes. I went a hundred days. 100 days. 100 days and yes, and I don't know, I'm afraid I'm scared every one. I'm afraid to start drinking again because I noticed that I, I just pick up where I left off. Like I really learned about addiction during these last hundred days. I realized how much shit I was, uh, you know, not addicted to, to a level that it was like, you know, I was coming home and slap it. My girl around, you know, getting on all fours growling at my dog is I peed on the Stereo and then the next morning, like I didn't do what he did. I don't remember that. Oh, well maybe I wouldn't drink if you weren't such a coat. You, I wasn't doing stuff like that. I was just out having a good fucking time. I like beer the way I like cake and cookies. There's really no reason. There's no reason to have cake or cookies. It says no nourishment that your body needs. You don't need that much fucking sugar. But a, I like it. I like the fucking rush, you know,

Speaker 1:          00:38:58       is sitting there feeling gloomy, Eh, I hate myself. What am I doing? Remember when I was young and I'd just go out and play Frisbee and it was fun, man. It was simple, right? You get older, you got all this debt, he got all his bullshit. Everybody's fucking nagging you. You get the blues, see, go out, you get a slice of cake, right? Feeling like shit. Six bites of cake lady. You're like, dude, I am fucking awesome. Right? You got that sugar rush going. So that's what I realized. I am a, I have a number of addictions. I am addicted to sugar. Not In like a, you know, I need an intervention, but like I fucking crave it. But if I lay off it for four days, when if I don't eat any sweets for four fucking days, when I look at a doughnut or a piece of cake, it's like laughable. Like why the fuck would you eat that? Look at it yet, that, that at, at, at, at that data, it doesn't even look like real food. You know when you're off, when you're fucking, when you've kicked sugar, when you look at a glazed doughnut, just sitting there all fucking sweaty. It just let, it looks horrible. It's like, why would you do that to you? So you know, you look at all the frosting on a cake, you make that face like he just sucked on a lemon like Jesus Christ.

Speaker 1:          00:40:19       Enough already and a fucking cunt downstairs just slammed the door cause I'm being too loud. I don't care.

Speaker 1:          00:40:26       Douchebag. I fucking love old people, but I hate that motherfucker downstairs. I fucking hate that guy. Hate that. He's got that classic old person's smell. He does it. He has a unique smell. You know what he saw? He smells like a, like a fucking, if you lit a wet dog on fire, okay, if you did that, that's what he smells like. Fucking miserable motherfucker. This goddamn Docker's the original Docker's fucking army navy store shop and douchebag. Fucking miserable. Cont giving me the stink eye. Every time I walk up the fucking walk can't stand the guy fucking hate them there. I hate him. I don't give a shit right. I die. I'll fucking, you know, I'll argue that one in the afterlife. I'll sit right there. You know you drank it drove. Yes, I did. Guilty as charged. He treated a lot of women like shit.

Speaker 1:          00:41:22       You're absolutely right. Guilty as charged. And you had, you had a poor opinion about the old man downstairs. Well, let me tell you something. Jesus, you try living above that cunt. Go Talk to your dad. He made them, oh my God. Shut up. You fucking hippie. Oh Gee. Um, so anyways, so tonight I am going to, um, I'm going to go watch the best of the, of the, of, of the four sports, the four major sports hockey is the best goddamn sport out there. All right? And uh, I know a lot of you won't realize that because you never played it. You never went to a game, hence you don't know what you're talking about. You know, it'd be like me making fun of line dancing. I've never done it. You know, I've never gone out and bought a pair of wrangler jeans that were fucking $8 and nine sizes too small for me.

Speaker 1:          00:42:15       So they cupped my fucking bowls and got out there and stuck my hands in my pockets and did this little fucking, that little, oh my God, that fucking line dancing. Can there be a mass suicide amongst line dancers? Could that just fucking happen in the middle of one of your fucking corn ball. Stupid ass fucking sell country music. It's country music is, I don't even know what it's for. It's for like pod people. There's absolutely no soul in it. What's so it there? Is it all right? They're angry. Redneck listening to this, punching the dashboard or your Chevy s 10 all right. There isn't. It fucking sucks. And that line dancing. We sit there with your fucking thumbs in your book and pockets and you do that little fuck I'm doing, I'm, I'm actually, I'm in Dallas, Texas this week, so let's, let's go for big air in this one.

Speaker 1:          00:43:09       We do that then you're fucking, I wish, I wish this was a vodcast, which I'm not doing by the way. So stop fucking asking me. The great thing about this thing is you can listen to it while you're doing other shit. Right? Are you or are you not doing other shit right now? Well, all right then. Are you or are you not pretending to be working right now? Looking at spreadsheets, right? You want to fucking plane? Huh? What are your choices for food? Aren't you doing that as you listen to this when they quit your fucking pitching? All right. So anyways, they do that stupid thing where they banned, they're fucking nice and the, and I can't even think of the fucking music by Ana [inaudible] the Gig, the Gig. You right. There's none of the music goes. And um, and they do that little thing where they just one of their, one of their feet, right?

Speaker 1:          00:43:59       The right foot, we'll say the right foot. It's just pivoting on the heel and the toes of face forward and then to the side and then back to the front. Ah. Then they do that little thing where they bring their fucking foot up and they spanked the bottom of their foot. All of them. You know what kills me about those people is they actually think that Jesus loves them. I got news for you. Rednecks. Jesus is looking the other way. He's embarrassed. He's combing his fucking hair into his face. When he watches you people line dance. He is looking that chicken the ring. Um, yeah. So speaking of which I'm going to be, I completely forgot what the fuck I was talking about. I know. Yeah. I'm going to go into the hockey game tonight. La Kings verse the Boston Bruins, the La Kings, which who actually have a really good team. I liked that. I liked that Dude Simmons. He's fucking fast as health and a cold baton, um, border. It's the greatest fucking game. And I've actually been playing a hockey recently. Ice Hockey, the real fucking deal. And I'm excited. Guess what? I learned how to do this week, 42 years of age, not married, no kids. I learned, finally learned how to stop on both sides.

Speaker 9:          00:45:12       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:45:12       But you know what's funny? I have, I have to go buy some more hockey stuff. You know, it's funny, out here in La, I have to drive all the way down to like Orange County just to find someplace, stuff that we'll sell hockey stuff. Uh, but I have to, even though I suck at this sport, I just, I'm just an old man and like it takes about four days. That's how deep the bruises are. After I'm done falling on the ice and like four days after I play, I look like I've been beaten with a fucking bamboo cane. I had a brutal one when I was in fucking Atlantic city last weekend doing the Miami Heat tour of comedy. Um, by the way, um, the Atlantic city was so successful. I just got an email today for an offer up in a fox woods for April 30th. So I will let you know as soon as I find out.

Speaker 1:          00:46:03       I might actually have an update right now. Wouldn't that be amazing right here on the fly as you listened to the Monday morning po? Fuck, let's just keep the flow of this podcast going. I think this was good. I think it's what it's going to. It's going to be a good one. We're almost 11 minutes in. Things are going well. For some reason. The voice seems way too loud on this thing. What's going on with this anyways, uh, yeah, so I fell on my fucking right ass, cheek and hip last time he played before Atlantic city. And, uh, it's one of those deals I kept pushing on it going, I can't believe that didn't bruise. It's, it hurts when I touch it. When I push my thumb into my little fucking right. Buttcheek it hurts. Right. And then like four days later, I'm in Atlantic city and I'm showering and I looked out and it looked like somebody threw a can of grape soda.

Speaker 9:          00:46:56       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:46:57       Uh, so I will be getting all, all of the hockey stuff, which I really didn't want to do because, um, I don't want to put it out there that I think I know how to play hockey because I don't, I just enjoy it. It's fucking fun. It's a fast game. The only equipment I wear is I wear a helmet for my big fucking head and I wear the full cage in the front because, uh, I don't need any hockey scars, you know, with the sticks and all that shit. Why would I do that to myself? You know, like I'm going to win a cup. I need to sacrifice. Oh, speaking of which, I should probably wear a cup too, right? No lifting. Um, hang on a second. We're going to the inbox. Did I get anything? Did I get anything? Nothing. You motherfucker. So anyways, yeah, so this, so tonight actually tech, technically I can start boozing.

Speaker 1:          00:47:49       This is the 100th day, but I gotta be honest with you, I'm not going to do it. I think I'm going to try to see how long I can go with this. I'm going to wait until there is, there is a specific event where boozing makes sense and uh, then I'm going to knock it off. Then I'm going to boost, make people, what am I, what am I going to do? Honestly, I might never going to have a beer for the rest of my life. I don't know how those people in Aa do it. That's like, I have a weird sort of like respect for people in Aa. And I also have a, uh, a disdain for them because, uh, I went to a couple of Aa meetings, uh, not by choice. Um, the judge told me I had to go, that's part of your sentence.

Speaker 1:          00:48:36       Um, and I went there and uh, I didn't like it. I kind of liked it. I liked sort of the room, but kind of like, uh, the only aspect of church that I like, I like going to church because it reminds me not to be a complete piece of shit. But other than that, all that stuff about hippies walking on water, talking to bushes, it just sounds like an acid trip. And uh, it just, it's just stupid and there's always a fucking leper. How many fucking lepers were there back then Jesus Christ get tell me you wouldn't have a fucking giant stick back in the day. Just for the lepers, you know,

Speaker 1:          00:49:15       ugh. Jesus Christ had fucking smash them. Right? And if you get the fuck away from me, he fucking leper. What would Jesus do? He has the ability to cure himself. I don't. All right. Don't you think that that maybe that's why he was such a good shit because he's the son of God. He knows he's going to heaven course he's doing the right thing. It's so fucking easy to be a good shit when you can walk on water and touch something and it gets cured. Of course he's going up and shaking your head, your fucking freak. Get away from me. I can't do that. You're a leper. Fuck off Dow. Go cry to the son of God. Um, so anyways, yeah. So I would go to these, these, these meetings, these meetings and uh, you know,

Speaker 6:          00:50:07       yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:50:07       I dunno. I, I believe in addiction. And then other times I just think, I don't think all of those people addicts, I think some of them, they're just weak. I can't stop myself. It's like you don't have like your brain tells you arm to move and pick up something and put it to your lips. Right. Did you guys like alcoholics? You guys become like such an alcoholic, like the bottles actually talking to you. I had a fucking buy into that shit. You know, God damn fucking pussy alcoholics. All right, go drink a case of beer. I understand it. Puke it up. All right. And then take, you know, a week or two off. You don't do it every night. You know, actually, I'm full of Shit. I, I 100% believe in that addiction thing and I actually believe a, I actually now, I now understand after watching the biggest loser every season, I now realize yeah it is. It is an addiction. Because every one of those people has some sort of psychological reason as to why they do it. But wait a minute, I'm not fat, but I'm out of my fucking mind.

Speaker 4:          00:51:27       Yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:51:29       yeah. So fuck him. Yeah. Right. All right. Sorry. I had to work that out. Fuck those fat fucks. Hey fuck them. I get sad and then I eat 24 cakes.

Speaker 1:          00:51:40       Well, how come nobody gets sad and they do sit ups. What's the deal? Actually some people do that and that's one of the last shows they'll do a Jim addictions. You know, they'll do something like that cause I think they're out of boring jobs to try and make exciting. Have you seen that? They actually have a show out there right now about people mining for gold, you know, I mean mining for gold, obviously they still do it, but it's like big business now. They have these sophisticated machines that cut the tops off of mountains and then they grind them down like you did with your number two pencil and second grade trying to get down to the array, right.

Speaker 1:          00:52:23       Okay. But nobody with a big bushy beard is squatting down like a Chinese gambler next to a fucking river with the God damn dinner plate trying to find gold. But Lo and behold, they found 10 douchebags who are doing it. And they decided to make it a show and they decided to fucking have what film these guys arguing each other and play this something dangerous is happening. Music underneath it. And I'm sick of it. All right? Fuck minors. Fuck people who, uh, make cakes for a living did fuck those God damn crab fishermen. You know, nobody is making you go on that Goddamn boat. Fucking idiots going out. They have risking your lives. Have a flounder. You know, just say what you do out loud for a living. Just say it out loud a couple of times to yourself. I go on a fucking tugboat. Okay. And I, I, I risked my life to get a, to get king crabs. So rich people have something crunchy to eat. Go Fuck Yourself, JP Morgan, you want crab? Go get it yourself.

Speaker 1:          00:53:39       What are your fucking options? Actually, you know some, I'll make it fun. I actually respect those guys cause I have a tremendous, tremendous fear of the ocean. A huge fear of people who go out and swim in the ocean. You're out of your fucking minds. You're out of your fucking minds. I know I've said this before in the podcast, but you know what? I'm going to say it again. I don't give a shit. I'm edgy. I'm crazy. They should make a show about me and my podcast and the dangers of it, you know, then me and Neil will have fake arguments. Um, you know, we'll have shit like plugs or something will go wrong. You know, I don't know. I don't have what we're with my Olympic SLS, ted. Oh, I thought you were going to have it. Then they'll cut to me. You know? So I went to go do the podcast and I couldn't find the Olympics. Ellos 10

Speaker 2:          00:54:33       ditto.

Speaker 1:          00:54:35       I mean, I, I gotta get this podcast done by Monday, or I don't know what the fuck's going to happen. If you notice that, like I think the, at Orange County choppers, they basically created the template for all those reality shows. And now everybody does that shit. The exact same thing that would happen on that fucking motorcycle show, uh, with where the sun would be like, eh. And then we had a problem. The, uh, the carburetor didn't fit for the carburetor, wasn't here. And then the bar, like, then the dad comes, shit,

Speaker 10:         00:55:05       Yo, what's going on? The carburetor isn't here. Then he gets on their show. Mike, he's fucking scary. Well, no, could,

Speaker 1:          00:55:21       how fucking jacked is the dad on that show? He could please my entire family to death if he got excited enough. Um, so now they do that shit. Like it makes sense on the chocolate for Shell, right? Bunch of mechanics. They're, yeah, they're wearing their greasy Dickies. They got butt cracks hanging out death. They're going to yell and scream at each other. Right. But the fucking idiots making cakes. So we get a job. Uh, we have to make a cake for the firehouse. And I decided to do a cake that was shaped like a fire hydrant. I wanted to do a fire hydrant motif with the little a Dalmatian know peeing on the fire hydrant. But Michael was like, I don't think that we should bring urine into something that's going to be in your mouth. They was typical Michael just shitting on my creative process.

Speaker 1:          00:56:10       Oh, kill yourself. Nobody cares. Nobody cares about you and your fucking cakes. And I like cakes. Yeah. Do you guys didn't know that about me? Did you? Let's see. How will you at 20 minutes in here, 20 minutes into the podcast. Um, should I do it? Should I do it? I'm going to be a class act here. My condolences to the Chicago bears fans and the fans in New York jets. Uh, the true fans, the true sports fans, the ones that don't talk shit. The ones who are cool. The ones who, you know, you can actually have a conversation about football with my condolences. Go out to you. Uh, believe me as a fan of Boston teams for my entire life. I know what it feels like to be that fucking clothes and they get kicked in the seeds against some my condolences. Congratulations to the Steelers and the Green Bay packers.

Speaker 1:          00:57:04       And uh, I would like to open this dialogue. This is something that bugs me about a NFL football is, is this, I don't get why in every other fucking major sport. They count championships from 100 years ago. Like, well, let's look at the red sox. They won the championship and like 1908 or something. When they had crazy legs, Magee was playing fucking third base with his giant Ebeneezer fucking mustache. They count those, the red socks count five world series titles that we went from 1918 and before fucking Montreal Canadians. They Count Stanley cups that they won during that time too. All right. The Yankees, they count all their pre depression era during the depression or whatever. That's right when they started, when they count all of those, the fucking Celtics count this from the 60s. The fucking Lakers count their championships, their first two or three, it wasn't even the NBA.

Speaker 1:          00:58:10       Those are BB eight championships. Their first four out of five championships. We're one before the 24 second shot clock even existed when you could win a basketball game like 17 to 12 they count those. So my question for spots for sports fans is this, why don't they count Nfl Championships? Why do they only count Superbowls? Because when you just count Superbowls, the Pittsburgh Steelers are the Yankees that Canadians are the Celtics of football. But as bullshit, it's fucking bullshit because the Greenbay packers have won like 12 or 13 NFL titles and Superbowls. They won three super bowls in like another eight or nine NFL titles that for some reason they don't count. The Pittsburgh Steelers were in the NFL when Green Bay was winning all those titles. So they had a shot at winning them. You know, it's as much as I give the Canadian shit going, I you dominated a 16 league, which isn't really true. They were going tit for tat with the maple leafs until 60 but the Bruins were in that original six. So we should have dominated and we didn't. So that's why I shut the fuck up when it comes to that conversation. So can anybody out there tell me why don't they count NFL titles

Speaker 1:          00:59:36       like I, I don't, I don't get that. I don't get it. That would be, if you didn't count that in baseball, you would have missed out on Babe Ruth, Mickey Mantle, Joe Dimaggio, none of that. None of that would count. Bill Russell wouldn't count. It's fucked up. I think it's bullshit. And I think it's, I think the, I like, I want to go to what? Like I love sports history. I want to go to an eagles game and I want to see 1960 NFL champions and I'm not giving an eagles fan shit. I'm just, they should have that up there. The Cleveland browns won it and like, uh, I don't like 63 or 64 with Jim Brown. The bears won one with Mike. Uh, Mike Ditka and uh, what's his face? They're a Dick Butkus right. They want it. Uh, the Green Bay packers won a few. Then the cults with Johnny Unitas, you know the ones that they won the greatest game ever fucking plague. Yankee stadium giants first, the colts, 1958 the overtime fucking victory, right? They don't count any of that shit.

Speaker 1:          01:00:40       It's, it's disrespectful to the athletes that played. Those were the best of the best, at least white guys for, for most of those years. But seriously, there was only one professional league. So the talent pool was even greater than, and they don't, they don't count it. And I think it's fucking bullshit. And I'm hoping that somebody talks about that considering you have the most successful teams since the Super Bowl era and then you have playing the most successful team in NFL history. They have one in every era except for the seventies and eighties I guess they didn't want a championship and the 2008 but they, but they've been competitive or whatever, you know, I dunno. Speaking of which, you know, do you guys realize that right now Brett Farve is getting sued some of this shit. This is how fucked up the world is right now. Brett Farve is getting sued by the, uh, by two [inaudible] because he tried to get, uh, some sort of sexual favors afterwards and they're, they're, they're suing for that.

Speaker 6:          01:01:54       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:01:55       Do you understand that? Well, let me say that just one more time. Brett Farve is getting sued by a [inaudible] tumor. Susis does that how you said my sue says, um, mousses um, tomosynthesis for, for asking basically to, to, uh, you know, to bang them at the end of it, they're suing him.

Speaker 6:          01:02:19       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:02:19       Could

Speaker 6:          01:02:19       you fuck a believer? I just, it's just fucking bus that will, you know what that's like? That's like me showing a comedy club because I got heckled.

Speaker 1:          01:02:29       It comes with the job. There is not any machine, any female Masoud out there that listens to this podcast. Are you honestly going to tell me that, that you've been rubbing guys bags and their legs and the chest and all that and you've, no one has ever asked you for a fucking hand job at the end of it. It fucking comes with the territory. That's like being a cop and suing the city cause you got shot at all. Right.

Speaker 1:          01:03:01       You fucking put hot oil all over a guy's body and you rub everything but their dick. I mean, give me a fucking break. You goddamn cock tease is, yeah. People are going to ask you to rub one out. Okay. And if you had a shred, a fucking decency, you'd do it. You'd complete the Goddamn job. All right? Because you're sign says full body massage. All right, last I saw my dick is still part of my body. All right. You know what, they'll, you know what Miss Susan is a like, they like the fucking quarterback who can't get it done, you know, just always comes up a little bit short. They should fucking interview them afterwards. So, you know, like what happened in there? Uh, you know, and I just didn't, just didn't get it done. You know, it's like right there. All I do is just reach out and grab it. And I just, uh, you know, we didn't want it. We didn't want it as much as they wanted it. Um, that's just like, just, that's such a classic, uh, piggyback lawsuit. It's like once that first stupid whore, um, you know, gave Brett Farve Shit,

Speaker 1:          01:04:07       this is very interesting that I've noticed about horse. Once one comes out of the woodwork, then all of a sudden 20 come out of the woodwork, you know, and then they always try to paint it as well. We were too scared. We were scared. Fuck you. You were you trying to make money and you're trying to build on the momentum of the other case. That's the female version of pulling a train on somebody. You know, the guy version is, you know, you and 80 of friends, bang the same girl. The female version is, you know, you're a fucking whore and you're just waiting for a whore to sue a guy that you fucking banked and then you fucking, you, you draft in right behind their lawsuit. Okay? Like one of those fucking fairies that rides in that bike race out there. And uh, in uh, in France that just piss some people off actions.

Speaker 1:          01:04:55       You realize that the level of cardio that you need to compete in that sport is 10 times that of a professional hockey player. That's when you know you're watching a sport that no one gives a shit about. When you have to really start bringing up like science, they did a study, the heart rate of the highlight player of go fuck yourself. Why don't you take that highlight thing? It just fucking cup. You're nuts. You're taint and your asshole and carry yourself outta here. Why don't you do that? Did that make sense? Is that what they do with the highlight sticks?

Speaker 4:          01:05:32       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:05:32       Or is it shaped that way? It's sort of a, a, you know, a user friendly bike seats that you can rock up and down on.

Speaker 1:          01:05:44       You know what? I think it's time to read some questions for this week. I'm going to say I've, I've exhausted all improv skills at this point. Oh, first thing I want to tell you guys, can you guys do me a huge favor if you're on Facebook? Um, there's some douchebag pretending to be me on Facebook. It just don't add the guy. He has a Celtics logo. I don't know what he's doing. He's not doing anything malicious. He's just pretending to be me and it's really weirding me out. Um, I mean, I don't know what he thinks he's good. I mean, I can't get laid off of Facebook so I don't know what this, well maybe he's got better at typing game than I do, you know, but I just don't want that shit to be added to my file down there in Houston, you know? All right. There's a lot of question out there about, you know, things that happen within society specially, you know, this, this is something that I think a lot of white people need because not because we're more racist than anybody else, we just get just the, the consequences of us fucking up is so much harsher than other people because, uh, you know, we, we are the gold standard when it comes to racism.

Speaker 9:          01:06:52       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:06:53       We are in the driver's seat right now. We have been in the driver's seat for awhile. Basically. Meaning that if we are ignorant assholes, it, it has way more effect than when other people are, you know, back in the day when other people will run shit, that's the thing. Whoever's on top, if you're thinking ignorant, uh, that's what, that's why, you know, if you're on top and you're thinking ignorant shit, you have to be called on it because, uh, just cause he cause the effect that you can have. You know what I mean?

Speaker 4:          01:07:22       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:07:23       Like if somebody from Bangladesh fucking hates me, that's such a stupid example. Okay.

Speaker 4:          01:07:28       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:07:28       That, that's not a race of people. I don't even know where Bangladesh's and I gotta be honest with you. I don't even know if that's a city or a country. Bangladesh have ever seen that on the prices, right?

Speaker 1:          01:07:42       Yeah. I want to showcase showdown where selling yet a Bangladesh and some white trash person like myself. So sit with a confused look on their face. Like I don't know where that is. Is that where the terrorists are? I don't want to go there, whatever, like a Filipino people fucking hate me. That doesn't affect my life. It doesn't, I'm not going to go and do a job interview at, at, you know, Walmart is not run by Filipinos. You know what I mean? You know, not saying there's anything wrong with Filipinos. Alright. See, we'll see what I have to do with those white person. Let's say I'm saying I do bad Filipino cause we clear here later on, I, I've never had issues. I go have a lab of Catherine. Well, fucking all that shit. You got to go to the Jerry Lewis voice there lady. Um, so yeah, people have questions.

Speaker 1:          01:08:26       So here we go. And I think all races to chime in the questions that you have, if you have feelings about a different race of people and you just think about your thinking, something funny, there's nothing malicious, but is this offensive? Is it racist? This is, this is the new topic. Okay. And if you feel that I answered these questions like the ignorant white man that I am, uh, call me out on it. I'm here. So here we go. This first one, uh, Bill, is it racist to call Indians? Dibble dabbles. And I'm talking about the Asian ones, not native Americans. Um, I'm guessing by Dib and DAB was, you mean Duba Dabu though. But the movement, the bud, you're saying like that debit Dabu um, is it racist? Probably, but it's fucking funny. So that knocks it down a little bit. This is what I feel that makes something like racist. It's like, like the reason why, uh, that one isn't as offensive is because we haven't, we never enslaved them. That's the reason why white and black shit is so sensitive is because of the shit that we did to him. But we haven't really fuck with those people, you know? So

Speaker 1:          01:09:43       if the black version of that was, is it, is it offensive to black people? Hey man, mother fucker or whatever. Yes. That would be offensive if you did some sort of mocking of the way they spoke. Yes. That would be, that would be offensive if some CEO was giving a speech and I was driving a, actually I was having someone else drive my town car and we drove by a group of a young mother fuckers and uh, they proceeded to walk forwards again, you'd have to apologize. So I guess, yeah, I guess technically Duma Dapa like that would be, that would be offensive. Is it racist? Um, this is what I, I really, I really, it's hard for me to say because it had, it's what's in your heart, you know, cause I make fuck I really, I make fun of, of everybody, you know, I mean I play a game out here.

Speaker 1:          01:10:37       Uh, when someone is make, let me ask you, I've got a question for you. Is this racist? I have a game out here when I ride around with Nia and she does not approve of this to keep her in the clear. She does not approve this. When somebody makes a more ronic move in front of me, you know, driving, you know, just makes a fucking horrific move. I play a game called old or Asian and you have to guess when, cause I'm going to pass the person cause I got to see what they look like. You know, whenever somebody does something fucked up, some comedians do a great joke about, you just want to see what the fuck they look like. Right. Uh, that's the game. Older Asian. So as I speed up my little hybrid to try to pull parallel to them, I always say, what he's saying to you, what are you going with all the ration?

Speaker 1:          01:11:25       What'd he got? Older Asian. She goes, I'm not playing this game. That's mean, and then I was gone, I'm going to go with old and then I pull up, oh, it's fucking Asian, you know, or Oh, I nailed it. It was an old guy. So, um, is that racist? I'm sure it's offensive, but within the context of my own car, you know, I'm not yelling at anybody and I got to admit, you know, there's a lot of truth in the fucking game. Yeah. Jesus, I'm gonna have to apologize next week on the podcast. So I would say that, uh, uh, Indian people, why don't you chime in? I would say that, yeah. That they would find that they would find that offensive. Um, is it racist?

Speaker 4:          01:12:06       Okay,

Speaker 1:          01:12:06       let me see if I can use it in a sentence here. Hey, uh, you know, I called up customer service and, uh, you know, one of those Buba dog was answered and tried to tell me that his name was Steve and act like he was in Kentucky. But I, I know that he was actually an India, cause what he talked to, he was going [inaudible] woods, how can I help you? Um, is it racist? Probably. You know what, something bad has to happen between white culture and, uh, or, or western culture in Indians. So, you know what I mean? It's like a, it's like you're playing a team and there's no rivalry.

Speaker 1:          01:12:52       Like patriots verse jets this year was like a whites and blacks. It was bad. It was a lot of hate, you know, but like patriots verse, like the Fucking Lions, you know? Yeah. There's to be some shit targets. It's knocked out, but it still hurts if somebody says something mean. I don't, I really don't. What the fuck I'm talking about? All right, let's move to the next one. The next one on the new controversial topic on the Monday morning podcast. Is it racist? All right, here we go. Um, Bill, I had an interesting experience today apparently involving me as a racist. I was walking with two of my coworkers who are both black Oji. Here we go. Um, we were going to go get some lunch. One of my coworkers who are most of friends with, uh, did a little high five fist bump shuffle with one of the female sex security guards at the front desk.

Speaker 1:          01:13:55       Knowing both of them and how they interact with one another. I kind of made a in passing comment to the tune of man, you guys in your handshakes while obviously laughing, laughing while obviously laughing at just choreographed. It was in more or less picturing them in a studio or something. Working out the logistics to get the fucking handshake. Perfect. Anyways, we all laughed and moved on and we got our lunch. All right, so nothing wrong yet. So you're cool with these people. You made a joke and everybody laughed. No problems, no problems so far. Um, however, after coming back through secure, uh, back through security, I noticed the security guard stopped me and Kinda had a scowl on her face. I thought she was mad at me for something, but it turned out she was mad at this other lady who was black because she overheard my comment and was telling, uh, that security guard that she couldn't believe I had the nerve to say something like that and I should be ashamed all to the point where she could, um, almost to the point where she could actually go complain to the human resource people because she was offended, um, et Cetera, without even considering that.

Speaker 1:          01:15:15       Maybe just maybe I was talking about the security guard and my coworker and not all black people now. It being corporate America in all I'm sure rather than even face the pos possibility of any bad press, they'd rather just sweep me out the door and completely ruined my re any reputation I may or may not hold at the company just to save their own asses. I feel I did nothing wrong and they had no intentions of ever doing anything wrong. Anything wrong. I'm not going to go on and on about how I kiss black babies and trying to rehabilitate inner city schools because I don't, but I'm certainly not some corn fed rebel flag waving ignorant product of what might be incest. I guess my question is do we really have to walk on eggshells when we are just making casual conversation that just any that just any cunt can pick apart, select the context that they might think it is in and then start crying foul.

Speaker 1:          01:16:12       Basically. I would have liked to call that woman a cunt and told her to go fuck herself, but let's just say I was already kind of worried about my job. All right. See, um, yeah, I think this is, this is the classic one where you were fucking around the other two people knew you were fucking round, but then one person decides to get offended and then you have to go on TV and apologize. Which personally I think is the wrong move because when you apologize now it's like you're, you're admitting that you meant it in a bad way. I mean, the apology, I would do that say, look, you know, I'm sorry that you didn't understand that I was joking, but I'm not going to sit here and apologize like I have any, any sort of ill will come in your way, you know, but I, but just to avoid the problem in the future, uh, white people do not use the expression you guys or you people when talking about black people, that's just it. It's just not going to, you're, you're setting yourself up for someone to get offended. And, um, there's a weird sort of a push pull going on with that whole, uh, you guys and you people think where, um,

Speaker 1:          01:17:31       with somebody white says that there becomes this concern of, um, that you're separating. You're separating like, yeah, you know, you people over there with how you live your lives and where over here, black people have that weird relationship with white people where they're like, you know, can you stop stealing our fucking music and our culture? Uh, but then like, if something, you know, hey, let's pay the streets, you know, well, make sure you do it in our neighborhood. We're all in this together, right. All of us together. You know what I mean? So it's that weird sort of fucking push pull thing going on. So yeah, just avoid, uh, avoid the whole fucking, um, yeah, you fucked up. You didn't fuck up, but you, you left yourself open for a sucker punch by saying you guys,

Speaker 1:          01:18:24       you know, uh, that's, I guess that, that's what it is. I don't know. That's, that's, that's my, I basically a white guy telling a white guy how he fucked up. So black people feel listening to this. Think, uh, please, please help me out here. Did I basically get it right? Is that essentially at, and I know most people wouldn't get offended. Uh, but that, that's one of those things like that girl getting offended and then you got to worry that you're going to lose your job. It's like those fucking piggy back horse who massage guys for a living.

Speaker 6:          01:18:53       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:18:54       You know, some of those myths, sutures date, they'll actually come to your house and give you a full body rubbed down with oil. Okay. And then have the fucking nerve to get upset that you tried to get a hand job at the end of it. You know, give me a fucking break. Why don't you fucking pursues broads man the fuck up and start rubbing one out? Is it that God damn hard, no pun intended. Is it that fucking difficult to just fucking, you know, it's like your revenue motorcycle. That's it. That's all you gotta do. Up and down, up and down with that dead fucking oil. You in and out. You want that house on the hill, sweetheart? There's a price to pay. All right? And when a quarterback who owns every fucking record, good and bad, and the Goddamn universe asked you to rub one out, God damn it. You fucking rub one out.

Speaker 6:          01:19:51       Okay,

Speaker 1:          01:19:51       well maybe you don't blog in this business sister. That's right. Stare at your fucking manicured toes. Pedicured whatever the fuck you supposed to say. Um, Jesus Christ mean spirited. All right, so there you go. That's the new, that's the new topic. Is it racist? And I would to hear, um, some honest comments from a non white people about their thoughts. You know the fucked up ones too. Okay. Cause I've watched enough spike Lee movies to think that evidently it's just us. But I've hung around enough people from different races to realize, oh yeah, everybody's like this. Everybody has their little fucked up thoughts. You guys ever see that Broadway play, they got that song. Everybody, everyone's a little bit racist. What does that the alphabet city one, whenever the fuck it's called actually enjoyed that actually went to a Broadway musical and there was puppets in it and I had a great time.

Speaker 1:          01:20:45       How about that? What does that say about me? Um, all right, let's get on with advice. Advice for this week. All right, advice. Spill. Let me set this one up for you cause it gets a little complicated over there. Um, I went to a New Year's Eve party with my best friend of 13 years. Oh Jesus. Oh by the way, this guy uses so many fucking names. I'm just going to use the names. All right. I know I don't name names, but fuck this guy. There's like 15 fucking names and then he goes back to the first name, back to the seventh name. So fuck it. I'm naming names. All right, so here we go. I'm suspending that role much like they suspended the salary cap and NFL football this year. Same Way. All right. All right, Bill. I went to a New Year's Eve party with my best friend of 13 years mark.

Speaker 1:          01:21:30       I got really drunk and hooked up with my friend John's ex girlfriend, Anna. John and Anna had dated for two years. John broke up with Anna back in September rather harshly and immediately started banging other girls. Anna and I also work together. Oh Gee. And we've become good friends. Here we go. So hooking up seemed inevitable. Our friends have even joked about it. Hey, if you guys like fucked each other yet, you guys want to get wings. Um, anyway, I had been dating this girl Sarah since October. We never got too serious and we kind of agreed to take a break when she left to go to London for spring semester. Mark's girlfriend who happened to be a cunt is best friends with Sarah. All right. Are you like me? Are you already lost? Are there too many fucking names here? Let's go back to the beginning. Mark and I got really drunk.

Speaker 1:          01:22:33       I went to a newsy part of my best friend mark. I got really drunk and hooked up with okay. Marks. His friend John has the ex girlfriend. All right. It was like a fucking mini series they had to show you clips from last week. Um, so anyways, he's taking some cut named Sarah. They agreed to take a break and the girl you taking a break with his best friends with your friend's girlfriend mark. Okay, I got it. All right. I'm up to speed here. So at this party and an eye, this is John's ex and, and I get pretty drunk and start making up. None of our friends were there except for mark. Mark saw it and got upset you fucking pussy and just had to leave. Oh my God. Really? Like some 15 year old girl. Exactly. Anna and I went to her place and proceeded to do some stuff. We didn't bang that night, but oral sex and whatnot was traded and we passed out. We both agreed that nobody needed to know what happened. I went to Mark's house later, New Year's day and said nothing happened with Anna and I, [inaudible] and I, and by the way, we just made out. I figured that was enough for him to know, not to tell anyone, especially his fucking girlfriend. Neither of US brought it up for the next four days and it seemed like everything was fine. A couple of days passed out of nowhere. Mk asked me if I was going to tell John that Anna and I made out. I was sort of taken aback as you should have been

Speaker 1:          01:24:12       sorta taken aback by the question, but I told him I hadn't planned on it.

Speaker 1:          01:24:17       He said he wouldn't tell John if I didn't because he didn't want to be a bad friend. All right, good man. I told him that it wasn't a big deal that we just made out and he was being a huge bitch. That was a bad move on your part. Even though he was being a huge bitch. He shouldn't have said that. All right. Because he's acting like a fucking chick right here and hell has no fury like a woman scorned and you just scored that fucking bitch man right there. All right, so you can guess what the fuck this is going. Okay. And then asked him if he told his girlfriend about it and of course he said yes. When I asked him why the fuck he did that, he said, because I needed to know if I should tell John Jesus Christ. I proceeded to column a bitch.

Speaker 1:          01:25:03       Good man and let them know how much of a bitch move it was to tell his girlfriend. Especially since he acted like everything was fine for four days. Yeah, this guy is beyond a pussy. This is the kind of guy who like, you know, does he like Bake Brownies? See One of those guys who like doesn't mind going shopping with his fucking girlfriend. Yeah. That's funny that I just said that. I actually, I'll bake brownies in a fucking second. I'm such a fucking hypocrite. All right, let's, let's finish this. All right. Nobody needed to know about what happened and now he told his girlfriend, Sarah, uh Oh, this isn't my fault. Once again, he fucked up to sentence. Nobody needs to know about what happened and now he told his girlfriend Sara would definitely find out. I knew Sarah wouldn't care about me. Drunkenly hooking up with Anna, but it's still something she didn't need to know.

Speaker 1:          01:25:51       Oh, Sarah is the fucking Twat and went to Europe. Somehow I was able to leave mocks house without beating the shit out of him. I called John who was spending winter break in El Paso and told them what's, what happened. He said he didn't really give a shit and agreed it was fucked up for mark to say anyone, anything to anyone, especially as girlfriend. When I told mark he could have asked anyone else about whether or not his bitch ass should tell John what happened. He said he asked his girlfriend so he could get a serious opinion as if being told to keep your fucking mouth shut. You little girl from either one of you, either one of our tenants. So close guy friends wouldn't have been a serious enough opinion anyways, I just needed your validation of how much of a bitch mark was about the whole thing.

Speaker 1:          01:26:36       Also, Anna and I decided to start sneaking around and are banging each other. No harm, no foul. Feel free to add on to the story of, I mean you read any podcast. Yeah, Dude. Yeah, that's, yeah, that guy right there at that guy. You need to cut out of the loop. Okay. That is, um, that's it. You, you forfeited your fucking guy card. It's over. You can't be trusted. You think like a woman, which is fine. There's nothing wrong with thinking like a woman, but just go hang out with a bunch of women now what a fucking do the amount of shit that has gone down that I have fucking, I am so buried in me that I don't even remember it. The amount of fucking shit is ridiculous and I don't even bring it up when it's me and just the other dude who did the, the dirty shit.

Speaker 1:          01:27:36       I'll fucking bury it in a second. I know exactly how to do it. When I meet your fucking wife or your girlfriend. I'll fuck yeah, fucking look you right in the eye. Hey Sweetie, how are you? You look great. You've been going to the gym. That's fantastic. I'll tell you your guy. He's such a sweetheart. God Damn it. The other day there was a cat stuck in a tree. He's the first guy up. He didn't even wait for a letter. A just started climbing up there when a swell guy, even if it's a dick, even if it's a fucking Dick, what I'll then do is I'll just avoid his girlfriend, but I'm not fucking bringing up dude. That guy really needs to go get his fucking tubes tied. What a fag. All right. Youtube, youtube videos of the week. You tobe. Um, all right. This one is fucking absolutely insane. And if this was made by white people, this would actually be considered racist on some level, but it was actually made, I don't know if it's Japanese, Chinese people, whatever the name of the video is, how to poop.

Speaker 1:          01:28:41       And it is an animated cartoon teaching children how to uh, go poopy in the toilet. And it is fucking insane. It's fucking insane. It's great. If you really have a problem in your life that is just weighing on you and it's sucking the out of you and you just need to clear every thought from your brain, please watch how to poop. Just go to the [inaudible] podcast.com we've got all these videos, this, that's the official fence side of the Monday morning podcast. Uh, just please go and watch this thing. It's fucking awesome. We got really good, I got three really good youtube videos this week. The next one is, uh, this guy made a federal reserve music video that you have to see. It's a, he's doing basically a song parody of the police's, a song. Every breath you take, it's fucking great. The guy actually has a really good voice.

Speaker 1:          01:29:37       This is fucking funny as hell. Now the great one. And then the last one is, uh, it's just a highlight video of Jim Brown and there's so many fans that say Jim Brown is overrated and he couldn't play in today's NFL. You just look at this highlight reel, the balance and the power that this guy has is, it's unfucking. He, he's like running sideways half the time or running backwards, just plowing over people. The combination of balance of power is like, it's, it's foreshadowing to Earl Campbell, Earl Campbell's the only guy I've seen with like runs like this. And for everyone who thinks Jim Brown couldn't play, now you're, you're 100% wrong and I know what you're going to do. Are you going to look at how tall he was and how much he weighed and say he would get crushed in today's NFL? That's the wrong way to look at it.

Speaker 1:          01:30:33       If you took Jim Brown and you put him in the modern era, which you have to do is also give them all the modern trade, uh, nutrition, all the modern sports science and all of that. So he would look like today's NFL football with his, with his skills, his God given strength and balance. And he would fucking tear up the goddamn league. Go Fuck Yourself. I don't want to hear another argument. I'm sick of people bringing up fucking guys from, from nowadays where they're taking fucking horse, tranquil tranquilizers. You could tell he would have dominated in 1950 I would have dominated in 1950 somebody 50 years from now could dominate the NFL. Right fucking now beget it's called advancement. Jesus fucking Christ. Morons. Alright. Overrated. Underrated for this week. Overrated. Every minority and woman in commercials playing the straight man to the dumb white guy. I'm not racist or misogynistic in the least bit, but enough is enough.

Speaker 1:          01:31:37       Uh, dude, that's fucking hilarious. And that's another thing that uh, that's not minorities a women's fault. That's because of all the fucked up shit white people have done and we don't want to get sued. That's why they're doing it. Not because they're trying to be sensitive to other sexes or other races. They just make the white guy be the stooge it all these fucking commercials cause they don't want to get sued. But yeah, it's starting to get annoying. There's always like the black guy shaking his head as the fucking white guy slamming himself in the face with like a fucking rake. That's not the way you do it. Um, that was actually a, a man woman one, remember that one with a woman's sit there at the computer and that their husband is outside fucking, he's got to go. There's a beehive, any stake taking like a broom handle and he's shoving it up the fucking beehive.

Speaker 1:          01:32:27       And then he gets stung and she's sitting there rolling her eyes like, ah, my husband, he's a fucking retard. Uh, and they do that between men and women and race and the fucking, uh, the white dude always has to be the moron. But I mean, you know, it is what it is, but you know, you should be happy white person who wrote that, that they had that. That's the way they balance it out. You know, you're still winning, so quit your fucking crying. All right. Also overrated in real life and not what I see on TV is the female carpenter or construction worker I get, I get that you've got to make up and try harder for all the bullshit you deal with. For Fuck's sake. Crack a smile for once in your life. I really don't know what he's bitching about. Their female construction workers don't smile enough.

Speaker 1:          01:33:19       Um, alright. Underrated the PJ's Eddie Murphy was brilliant and the claymation was the shit back in the day. Why the fuck don't, why the fuck that show isn't on DVD is a crime to all comedy. One of the few shows that is actually better with closed caption on a number two real musicians. Anybody remember these people that naturally play actually play their instruments and none of that fucking auto tuners, sampling machine and turntables, all of those are not fucking instruments. Um, well I mean, you know, I've actually come to a place where I can, I can understand the brilliance of being able to take pieces of, so I think the way that the Beastie boys did it on Paul's Boutique where you took like 10 or 12 different samples, looped them together and created a new song. I mean, there is there that is a talent, you know, turntables, that's just, I don't get that shit.

Speaker 1:          01:34:19       That's just, I don't, I don't understand that. Um, I'm too fucking old to get that and I don't get, I don't get mashups. I bitched about that before. Mashups are the emperor's new clothes of music. Okay. All you have to do is pick two songs that are the same temple. Okay. Same beats per minute. Then the lyrics will fit on that other one. Then all you have to do is just one that where the lyrics fit the mood of the, the new music you're putting it over. That's not that fucking difficult. If he got sad sorta music, pick another sad fucking song and just stick that music under those sad lyrics. As long as the tempo was the same. Yeah, it's going to work out. Dude. He took jingle bells and blended it with Santa Claus is coming to town.

Speaker 2:          01:35:13       MMM.

Speaker 1:          01:35:15       What else do we got? A road trip. Road trips with your fucking bug buddies never gets old. That's, that's absolutely true. That's why the hangover was such a great fucking movie. A real lemonade. Not that coke and Pepsi package garbage but real shit with fucking pulp and flavor. I like this guy. This guy's into old shit. You know. A pen and paper, not this fucking laptop horse shit. I don't remember my laptop ever crash and I've actually said that. Um, all right, that's it. That's the podcast for this week. Everybody. I hope you had a great week. Um, and once again, good forward to the uh, the Steelers Greenbay championships and do me a favor, bring up all Green Bay's NFL titles. I would really like to try to start an underground debate about that because I want them to start counting NFL titles and I want to see NFL franchises fly those NFL championship flags. You want it, you know, I didn't think the AFL one should fly those flags. It's part of the history. If you're a fucking nerd like me, I like that type of shit. I'm actually reading a book right now called the greatest game by Richard Bailey. Uh, somebody gave me this book and uh, it's actually about the Bucky Dent Red Sox, that one one day play off game. And you know, that's a great thing about the red sox finally winning a world series and they're wedding. Another one. I can actually sit back and read this book and it is a,

Speaker 2:          01:36:43       okay.

Speaker 1:          01:36:44       It's a fucking great read to great read. I recommend it. All right. That's it. That's a podcast for this week. Everybody have a great week. I'm at the Improv and Addison, Addison, Texas this week. And, um,

Speaker 2:          01:36:58       okay.

Speaker 1:          01:36:58       What else do I got coming up? Let's go on my website. Uh, hang on one second. Come on guys. Hagen that don't shut it off just yet. Don't shut it off just yet. All right. Um, then I'm going to be at the count Basie theater in Red Bank, New Jersey on February 18th, and I'm going to be at the new

Speaker 2:          01:37:19       okay.

Speaker 1:          01:37:19       Of Jesus Christ to Tarrytown musical on the 17th of February, Miami beach. We have a new theater. Um, they had me booked in another one, but they had already booked another act there, so they had to switch it up. I'm actually going to be at the new World Symphony Theater, uh, on 17th Street, Miami Beach, Florida, or the, the 4th of March, the tower theater in Philadelphia. Look, I got a bunch of new dates on the website, tower theater in Philadelphia on April 9th. And, um,

Speaker 1:          01:37:53       this is the last one here. I'm going to be at the paps. Fuck Jesus Christ, the linkedin work. I would be at the, you know, I was having such a great podcast too. On April 22nd, I'm going to be at the PAPP's theater in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Um, and right off the bat, I just want to tell you, I'm blown away about how many tickets sold the first day. Uh, Milwaukee was one of those cities where I was like, you know, I dunno. I Dunno. I Dunno if I'm gonna sell tickets there. You know, it's not like New York. It's not Chicago, it's not La, you know, so it's not one of those kinds of cities, but I don't, it doesn't strike me as a gator dad kind of city either. It's one of those middle ground once. So I don't know where the fuck I'm going to fit in it. So I want to thank everybody in Wisconsin who went out and bought tickets.

Speaker 6:          01:38:40       MMM.

Speaker 1:          01:38:42       Especially, Oh, you know what? Somebody sent me a fucking email if I can just from Escanaba Michigan saying they were coming all the way down because they remembered back in the day. I played a college up there and the upper peninsula of Michigan and they said, um, I went up in front of 17 people in a cafeteria and evidently I killed. So the fact that actually put on a show in front of 17 people, see how it see all that new comedians. If you're listening to this podcast, those fucking shows matter. Years later, they'll actually show up if you give him hell in front of 11 people doing a nooner or the upper peninsula, Michigan. I actually fucking remember that Gig. I did a couple of gigs up there though. That's an amazing group of people who live up there. I like how they embrace winter. They really have no choice, but they actually get real fucking a snow storms. You know where you come out, you open your door, you know, and you get buried by like nine feet of fucking snow. You walking down the street on your snow shoes and you're stepping over like frozen elk, right? You know, and they just stay. Just stay. Embrace it

Speaker 1:          01:39:53       as opposed to all the pussies down here. Every time there's four inch is a fucking snore. Every god damn fatty is running down to the fucking supermarket like they're going to starve to death. I just want one news guy. During all that insanity, we're going to get six to eight inches. It's like, do you realize six to eight inches of snow it that would barely reach the average person's up to their cath and considering you can last about 35 days without food as long he had, as long as you have water. Okay? And Snow is water. Stick it in your mouth. See what happens. All right, you've gotta be fucking fine. All right, so sit tight.

Speaker 6:          01:40:33       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:40:35       All right. Their sport. That's what I wanted to say. I want to, I want them to just fucking sit there and watch the weatherman losing his fucking mind. All excited that he's the focus this week on the God damn fucking newscast, right? Well that night of the newscast and then when they go back to the anchor, who's fucking the co-anchor cause he's the god Damn Alpha male. I want them to dress down that fucking that goddamn a weatherman. Four inches of snow. Jesus Christ. I could stick my dick in that. You could still see the shaft. The fuck are you talking about? Go Fuck Yourself. All right, that's it. That's a park

Speaker 11:         01:41:12       cast for this week. You guys have a great weekend. Yeah, go fuck yourselves. Don't take any shit.
