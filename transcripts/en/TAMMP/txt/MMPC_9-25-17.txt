We have the great Philippe aspires are on here who has a welcome, first of all, welcome. [inaudible] was so full. They go fully based bars if fun of what's selling podcast. And uh, let's get all the hype out of the way. At first we got a, you have a new HBO special?

Speaker 2:          00:00:44       Yes. A new HBO special on so 30th 10

Speaker 1:          00:00:48       September 30th at 10 on Hbo. That's where the HBO specials are. Culled. Translate this. So, uh, let's get into it. Tell me about that. What's it like to shoot a hour long special for HBO?

Speaker 2:          00:01:00       Um, it was, it was good. Um, I showed him myself. Um, I, I, um, I got the money together. I stayed up the money and my wife and I are, we, um, we chose that Jose Improv and we got cloud shires and, um, it was all DIY, you know,

Speaker 1:          00:01:18       so you did it yourself and HBO liked it so much. They bought it. Oh, so when you were doing it, you weren't thinking like, Oh shit, I'm doing an HBS,

Speaker 2:          00:01:25       Mashallah, no. To Go, they open, go to Netflix or even Amazon.

Speaker 3:          00:01:30       No, but that's, I think that's a, uh, that's a great way to do, I had a fuck is nobody giving you a shot? I don't know. You know why you're not white like me. Um, I gotta be honest, before where I did this, you know, I was looking up like videos and all that type of stuff to make sure I got something to talk about. So it doesn't become this, like, my biggest fear with these interviews is it's just gonna become this horrific staring contest because I'm such a huge fan of what you do. And I had never seen the, uh, the Irish when Ari Shaffir was hosting the show. Uh, this isn't happening. When you told that whole story about, uh, being in the gang and fight and the guy biting his air off and shit, it's just like, like I was listening to that, that story. It was like, this is like at least three different Tarantino movies and then you ended it and just such a nice place. I don't want to force you to tell the story again, but if you could just recap mine.

Speaker 2:          00:02:22       Um, I like to start by where did you grow? I grew up in Boyle Heights, California, Los Angeles, but east la, but he called Boyle Heights. East la is like further east, east. I love that. Engineers, you know, is by almost close to Monterey Park, but Boyle heights in the neighborhood. Right, right. How far away is that? To put it in white perspective. How far away is that from the staples center? Ooh. If I were to walk it'll take me like an hour. And so if you were to drive probably 50 minutes with him. He's minutes. Okay, cool. A 30 minute bus ride. Okay. 30 minute bus ride.

Speaker 3:          00:02:59       So you grew up, uh, what, what, what decade? You were a child of what? You're the 80s

Speaker 2:          00:03:04       and we're been 80. So that was the real deal. Yeah. I grew up in, my neighborhood was in the housing projects, Pico Gardens and the one like three separate out in projects. Those Aliso village peak or at least so and then Pico Gardens from first street to like sixth street. Okay. And there was like say man, it was like a shit load of gangs. Like maybe 11.

Speaker 3:          00:03:26       How did you, now, when you're not in a gang and you're a young kid, how do you negotiate? Like I got to get from my house. I gotta go pick up my, my fuck, I got to go do my laundry. I got to go to school. How do you negotiate? Uh, is it, uh, now our gangs 24, seven. Oh Yeah, man, the 2,400 neighborhood, there were 24, seven I, how we start that came out around five, like anybody with like just live in a regular lifestyle, goes to bed and then they just kind of give up this, the area. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:03:56       Then those gangs, they come on at five. They're let the gangs that there are still living in a gentrified neighborhood. Okay. They don't come on a data, they might call the cops on them. Oh yeah. Remember most guys, you know from Echo Park, they come on at night, man. Robbing people. Really? Yeah. They come on at night. Those guys were, were those jetro vacation? Those gangs are still around but they come on at night and the gang bangers, different areas, you know. But there's still gang banging. They don't have yet. How old were you the first time you got mugged? I got mugged the first time when I was like 18 years old. My friend, I'm coco. That's pretty good math. Yeah, I got all the 18 downtown crossing when I was like in eighth grade that I was like, I was selling crack on my first day like that where they one hour I got robbed.

Speaker 2:          00:04:45       Somebody put a knife behind my back under the knife in my like in front of me and they took all my crack away. Tacony crack away. So then what do you have to do? Oh, I have to go back to the guy who gave it to me or a friend of mine who I grew up with and you know he passed away already because they used to call them cocoa and we grew up together. Him and I were, I'm from second grade to adults. I needed money at the time I got somebody pregnant and I didn't know how to make money. So I asked him for a job in the criminal business, can I, you know, hey man, I had no money. How does that go down? You'd probably avoid it. It's like I don't want to sell drugs, but I, I kind of have to now I got a kid comment, so help me.

Speaker 2:          00:05:26       So he gave me like $100 of crack, you know, a hundred to bring me back a hundred they didn't give you more to sell. So as soon as I got out, they didn't know who I was in that neighborhood. They just came around me and he took all my stuff. They didn't hurt me or anything. I was begging for my just can I keep my id and the Game Id Alec did. How scared I was scared. I thought they were going to kill me right there. I was, I felt like oh young. I was really scared but I'll calm, you know, I wouldn't like, uh, all right, just take your man, just take your, leave me alone, you know, just walked out of I take it, I didn't fight him or nothing cause I knew they would have killed me or stab me or worse. So went back to my friend Coco and I told him what happened and I thought, you know, he was going to be okay man.

Speaker 2:          00:06:13       You know it's all right. You know it's your fault. It happens. It happens. No Man man, that night escalate it like it took it, he gave you the crack and I go on midnight, I go rather than one 30 at two 30 in the morning and back at his house. What? Who robbed you? Cause so what happened? He gave me a gun, he gave me a pistol, he got himself a pistol and he, and he put a, a blue handkerchief on his head and he put a black beanie on and we both were looking for those guys. And you must have been praying to God like I didn't want to murder somebody the first, Oh hell yeah. Mel Praying, please don't find it guys. Wow. Cause I, there I was like, I would've probably with done anything, he would have told me all the vulnerable. I was weak, you know I have no, I didn't know what to do.

Speaker 2:          00:06:58       So we went together and we saw one guy that saw what happened but he didn't do anything and, and then like he kinda like hit him real hard. And who did it? Man where the ad then I say manual is in here, man. It wasn't him. So it wasn't him. Wait, how did Danny, so you go, oh there's, I remember that guy standing there watching me get broad. Now this poor pastor to gets dragged into, which he gets dragged into anything. He got like, he got a gun slap, you know by my friend. He's my friend name and no question, he just hit him in the face hard man. And like he started to believe, I mean the year and I just say, wow man. He was looking at me like, come on man, please tell them what they mean to you. Wait until after the pistol slap.

Speaker 2:          00:07:39       I meant meant to tell you this. It wasn't him. So we got nothing happened to him and we went back and later on those guys who actually did it, walked back and gave it back or everything. Get back to crack to that guy and everything was cool because of what he has to have. Sorry, we didn't know that they were afraid of that guy. Yeah. So we didn't know Batman. We're with you. We should street nickname. Yeah. So then after that then they knew that you were with him. So then people stop fucking with you. People Start Messing with me. Yeah. Jesus Christ. This is what kills me about you is you have like a thousand of those stories and you're the most relaxed, laid back guy ever. Like where did it all go? Because due to I look at me, I sound like I lived your life and you sound like you lived my life.

Speaker 2:          00:08:25       Like you sound like you grew up in a nice little cul de sac area and played street hockey and I'm all fucking wound up. How did you do that? Well, I have a mom. I have parents, I have my mom and dad and most of my crazy friends in the projects, you know, the crazier ones, they didn't have a mom and dad. Right. They had nobody telling him you better come home early or there was nobody telling those kids to come home and the lights go on in the streets. So they had no really nobody telling them what to do, how to live. Right. No discipline. I have my mom and dad mom and worked and my mom stood up on my work that a elementary school and then be home from selling crack when the streetlights came on. Right? Yeah, yeah, you had that.

Speaker 2:          00:09:05       And I've always that family foundation, but I've always out. But I don't get that. I just now you're talking, you got a home life, but you're telling you you're doing all this other shit will know the kid. You know when I was like 13, 12, 14 years old, I wasn't crazy. Oh, I see. Crazy. After high school, that's the one pregnant. I didn't know what to do, but it was always like a little hustler man. My mom will saw a bond and I will collect the money for her. He knows who I learned how to collect money for people, at least from my mom was always telling, um, herbal life, a bond. She was always studying something. Can we live by the warehouses in downtown la where the factories are Rad, where other trucks will come in and pick up stuff on the trains and take them to like stores. So when Mama knew where like we used to go to this one factory and we used to, um, put a bunch of that synthetic cotton, the plastic one, they will throw it away. And my mom and I will put it in bags, like hefty bags. And then we go to another place where they will throw these raggedy old sheets. And then my mind was so those raggedy old sheets with the cotton and then we'll, we'll, we'll, we'll door to Dell door to door in the housing projects, selling pillows.

Speaker 2:          00:10:20       So you guys were real green family man. You were there, you were there. Recycling. That's wonderful thing. We've sold, we've borrowed the trash and we sold it like we've so pillows. I used to when I was like 14, I used to walk to Delta to do with pallets. Would you build a little house and then sell that? No, that's too much work. I want to, we want fast money. Oh, okay. Cash. Although there's a bunch of batteries where I live, you know, I felt like I felt like Henry Hill from Goodfellas, right. Because they were always stealing stuff from the airport and we always taking stuff from these factories. I wasn't stealing from these batteries. My friends where I was taking stuff in the trash like, um, though there was a watermelon factory and they will throw away run water matters and I will get the watermelons and clinicians, watermelon, they make waterman grew them.

Speaker 2:          00:11:09       Know that they were getting from the farmer I guess. And they right. They would hold them there. They have pallets full of watermelon from, cause there's like a grocery area of downtown la where every grocer oh gets all this other stuff. Flowers, stereos, you know, you name it bananas. I know where everything is that suits you. Cheap suits. I know everything's at. So we'll get the wanting to hang out with and just go to the dumpsters and whenever they threw out you would then go sell. Yeah, I will cut that water money to have and then go sell it to the Mexicans. They laborers, everybody working in the factories. Much a bunch of immigrants. Right. And always thought though the half a watermelon for a dollar, $2 five I'll just cut the running piece off. You know what I mean? Oh it once in a while.

Speaker 2:          00:11:57       Nobody is looking. I will stay in my little home girl. This girl, the little less well should a lesbian now, but we didn't know she was a lesbian now. She was like a tomboy. I was sending her in there with my brother and then went. There was like when they were, everybody was looking, they would throw good watermen in the trashcan too, so we had to make sure of good and bad water, mountains. How long did you stay in that whole world is selling crack and all of that and and all those fights and bite and the guy's ear off and all that shit. Before you became a comedian, like how long, how long was that period of your life? That was my period of from 18 years old to like 21 and a half, 21 and a half because at 21 is when I was like messing up already man.

Speaker 2:          00:12:34       I was like, I'm smoking a lot of PCP. That was like my drug of choice for the time being and man, I used to get all crazy, see PCP and like I think it's an elephant tranquilizer. That's what the people tell me. I saw he's here that grown a PCP, angel dust and all that and angel angel does is like coming crystallized PCP. You could put it in a cigarette but PCP in my neighborhood, we were at the PCP capitol, the of Los Angeles, like in my neighborhood they sold gallons of it. People had to, they would have, I'm sparkers water full of PCP so everybody had PCP. Wait a minute. And you how did, how did you ingest it? You smoked it. No you did like a, I'm giving away secrets here. I'll tell you why I'm asking. Cause everybody tries to act like, oh you understand all no man, I don't know any of that stuff.

Speaker 2:          00:13:27       You will get a Newport cigarette. Oh for real menthol cigarette, a new port and then you put you or you and you dip it instead like a little jar. Like I'm just the tip and that's a $5 tip as a $5 dip. He did put again at 10 you dip a whole one is 20 you know, you, you soak it is $30 and it's by Deb. You know. Now I get it. That's like when I drank booze, there's like the 10 year old shit that you're only up to 25. Then you get into the cognacs and that can be like, I dunno, like a fun, I don't know. Wines and shit could be like a century or older some. So there's one night I was smoking PC just cause I'm stupid as hell when it comes to it. So what is it? What's that highlight is mad.

Speaker 2:          00:14:07       It's like you're the incredible hoke. Oh, if somebody attacks you, oh, this is a shit when like five cops up and they got to see that I've marked, did you see that Charles Bronson movie? There's worse three. One white boy, like a surf fourth. He's been, he's fighting other police officers. He's on PCP. Oh, okay. I got to rewatch that. Yeah, about PCB. You take, you have, um, like incredible host strength, but you just have like, you don't feel pain, but while people are hitting you, man, you could just keep attacking forever. You know what I mean? Right. And then the next morning you wake up and you feel like you played 12 years in the NFL. Yeah, man. Alright, so the first time you smoked PCP and that shit hits you, it's like literally like you're turning into like a superhero. Yeah, man. Well, the one time, when did you do, did you try to bend something?

Speaker 2:          00:14:54       Nah, that's what I was taught. Cops. No, no, that's what I would've done it. I want to try to pull something off the fucking wall a bit ago. The Rona, well when I, when they work in a row, I'll be coming to be known as Batman. You know, he's crazy. We'll chop. We're here. Why did they call you? Why did they call you Batman? Cause um, I love Batman and I used to wear my, my, those um, superhero on the rules and 18. Yeah, man. Well the Batman shirts still fit, so I wore it and I don't know where to go to a Batman shirt anywhere else. It was the underoos factory right down the street. It took it out of the dumps to the bad projects. Yeah. That's amazing. All right, so you don't want all that. I'm watching, I'm driving the theater with my friends smoking PCP watching terminator two asking what I was saying.

Speaker 2:          00:15:45       I'd fight that guy. Yeah man. And I'm thinking about the guy that bullied me for the last two weeks. So I go wait, if you smoke that she say say a guy views I fuck I shouldn't do this cause I'm like doing a commercial here for the drug sane is somebody bullying you. You can't beat that guy. Right. If you were to smoke some PCP it definitely would give you the belief. But can it overcome how slow you are and your inability to slip a punch in or you just walked through his shit? Yeah man, you're throwing punches. Cause um, when I, when I got into a fight with his guys, I will, they told me I was doing things though I remember doing that. They told me that took my belt off in a whipping them all over the, we keep alluding to the story.

Speaker 2:          00:16:25       You got to tell the story, right? So you're Batman, you got on your under roofs, you smoked PCP at the driving. He saw the terminator two when I left the Terminator two movie, I come back into a project and I see this guy that he looked like an old dude, man. He's like 30 years old. He just came out of prison. He don't know who I am. He's like calling me bad names and um, pushing me and pushing me and I, I want to fight him pushing me. They finally, I socked him in the face but I kind of missed that. He hit me right in the eye and he hit me hard and my, I got black right away. He punched me in the pace. I started bleeding. Then he started choking me. So when he started choking me, that's when I like, I went crazy.

Speaker 2:          00:17:07       I went crazy man. I lifted him up, dropped him, period. I bet his dear our first of our period, the era of malware at the whole Kogan retire brother, let me ask you this, when you build a zero, if we were underneath, are you on top of him? I was like underneath him, he was choking me and you just, all of a sudden that PCP, I paid it off, man. I never thought mass gain his solos. Easy to bite off and spin. Crochet. No, not even man. I spit it out and I started punching him and then my friends told me that um, wait, what did he do? Or May took the hits like a soldier. So when you bend his ear off, this guy [inaudible] he's, he's screaming like a little girl. Okay. Do you think pain? So actually he's kind of screaming like a guy who got his ear bit off point.

Speaker 2:          00:17:53       I think you're still a man if you, if you go up a few octaves when you're missing a fucking year. But I don't know why. I believe the Arab, I mean I had no, I get the handle of choice, you know, he was choking me. Sounded like that was the move. No one helping me. He wasn't, didn't seem like he was going to be stopping. All right. See you beat, then you took your belt off and you were, my friends told me that I took him my belt off and I thought it were whipping him. Like he will like chasing them with a bout whipping them like, like he was like, oh, runaway property or something. And how many people are witnessing this? I think it's wild. 15 people, but they're all like cheering me on, cheering here, Mar. Nobody's helping Denomie hits that would get like nowadays if they were to, that would be, that wouldn't be like, it would be epic PCP guy, epic belt guy. They'd be something like that or been a rap song. Autotune

Speaker 1:          00:18:44       man, we're, yeah, so wait a minute. So when you, so you don't remember doing that. So there was like, oh fuck, this guy's going to kill me. Then you start to bite his ear off. You're like, wow, here's come off really easily. Then you sort of blackout and then like when you just sorta came to with like blood all over, you going like, uh, the nicest seat, a hot dog or something together. Next day I wake up,

Speaker 2:          00:19:05       the next day I'm walking around, it's like a seven in the morning, eight in the morning. I don't know, man. I'm looking at, my body is full of blood, my pants, my face. You know my, I have a black guy, my shirt, it's full of blood. I have no idea what happened. I have no idea what happened. You probably thought it was your blood. I didn't know that. Whoa man. I was like checking steel. I got shot or stabbed by somebody they didn't know. Then my friends told me what happened and the guy was in the house, he went to the hospital for like a broken ribs missing, missing an ear, you know, where he's just putting neosporin on that has it. And they went to, he was laying in bed and they asked him if you want to press charges, you know, cause everybody know there was witnesses. Everybody knew who did it. And um, he said, no, we're going to handle the right way. And I was like, oh, I didn't even know. No, there's a little later on, like a week later you go, yeah man, I think there's like a green light on you right now. And the mean like green light. What do you mean green light? Yeah man. Shoot to kill and they see you.

Speaker 1:          00:20:13       What the fuck. So that's the first time you ever heard that. So now what? Now what do you do besides not go outside? Do they know where you live?

Speaker 2:          00:20:19       They know where I live, but I don't know. He's still in the hospital though, but everything's calm, you know. But he's doing a hospital. But I can feel tension from people who are who I thought were my friend one time who had, who I grew up with, you know, you know they were turning on me like, cause I would never in their gang, I was in another gang.

Speaker 1:          00:20:38       When you watch the wire, do you like fall asleep as it like boring to you? Because you don't need to. You lift it. So I'm like, it sounds like an

Speaker 2:          00:20:47       award winning series to me. I'm more like blood in blood out. So wait a minute. So now, now there's a green light on you. Yeah. And think at some point you got to go outside to get food because you're hungry. Yeah. So I'm going to take, when you have a green light on you in, in East La, what's a good time to go out to? If you've got to go hit, hit the Mayfair market or whatever. What's it called? Man Do. And you know, when you have a green light and in from anybody, you know, whether it comes from prison or ever come from just the neighborhood, it's just relieve man, move somewhere safe. Like Modesto.

Speaker 2:          00:21:24       What's a more serious greenlight? If it came from prison or from the neighborhood? And if it come from prison, you're a dead man man. I mean there's nowhere to go. They're nowhere to go, man. And um, I read about these things, you know, on kind of it on books. There's no way coming back from that. But then it was like only like a green light from his neighborhood. You know, let's go to the mall, like the Grove, pick a really white mall. And you know what? All those thoughts came to my mind at that time. Like, man, I wish I would like the fresh prince of Bel Air. I wish that a rich white guy didn't take a rich white guy or a wish. Fuck, you're Mexican guy. Oh No, wait. They weren't wearing that show. That was different strokes, those different struggles. But to drumming, they switched it up.

Speaker 2:          00:22:04       They're like, it's different strokes. Except the marathon allowed into right now. Yeah. That's what they over there. They always do that shit. So my mom called out farther. Greg Boyle. He's like this priest that I grew up with in the neighborhood. He's from the homeboy industries hearing our name. That's a thing. Yeah, he helps. He helps them. Gang members. That's a cool name. All right. Father Greg Boyle, he'd like a priest from my neighborhood and um, he's always helped the neighborhood. Like he will go on his way to help people. He was like, if he like if he's driving and then you like, he will pick up kids that were drunk off the streets and take him home. He did that a couple of times for me. In a good way. In a good way. Yeah. Like if you're a gay member in the wrong neighborhood and then you know you're pretty much, someone's going to kill you in that neighborhood for the great boy would tell you, get in a van.

Speaker 2:          00:22:56       I think you're back home as a, as, as a gang member, how do you end up in the wrong neighborhood other than a woman, a man on PCP, the Goddamn PCP. There's no, there's no heroin in your neighborhood. So nothing there. Go buy heroin or somewhere else, you know, there's no crack in the neighborhood. You know, there's, it's a dry spell somewhere and you've got to get high, so you got to go to another neighborhood and buy it. Oh God. Oh, you have a, and so how did they know you were in a different gang? You don't go over there wearing your whole, your colors. Right. Most of the, the hardcore gang members, they were the colors, man. They, they're not going to stop wearing their colors. Yeah. Boy, they're now on the cover there 24 seven. But I was one, I wasn't even one of those guys. I was nothing like that. It was just a guy who will just hanging around with these kids. And the one thing I get jumped into a gang and I'm getting

Speaker 3:          00:23:45       into so much trouble, but I don't no idea to get beaten into a gang just in case I ever fucked my life up and I go to prison, you know when I go to prison, my only hope is I got to join the area and Nazi guys, I can listen to their bullshit and pretend I believe it just to save myself. How long is that beat though?

Speaker 2:          00:24:06       Um, well in, in, in the streets it will be like, I guess whatever number the gang is. So with 18th street you going to get beat up for 18 seconds. That's it. Yeah. Or, but I mean, how many guys are all of them? Oh Jesus. Okay. Fuck. Can I strike thing? That's it from the record there. Because when I got jumped in, I was just hanging out man. Like I was just hanging out and then somebody said, I'm a man, you want to get jumped in. And I wasn't going to say no. If I say no, I'm a punk, I'm gonna get jumped in. I'm going to get Joe for being a punk. So I said, fuck it, let's do it. And then I punched the guy next to me for no reason. Well, because I want to prove that I'm, I'm, I'm tough. So the guy next to him, I just knocked him out with one punch man. And then I hit like, he wasn't even looking. I said, let's do this. And then like I hit him. Right. You know, you gotta be really big dog to look

Speaker 3:          00:25:00       God homie. They said Warren Sapp moment. Keep your head on a swivel. Look good. I bet he get the other guy shit later. Like, Hey, next time you're going to jump somebody. Yeah. Can you not say what I'm sitting right next to you knew he was a lefty. What the fuck you get beat up and I got a job by everybody that one in and they're, did you get more than one ended? You get one. I've got two in one,

Speaker 2:          00:25:20       him and another guy. But then after that I felt like Nike cortex all over my face.

Speaker 3:          00:25:29       So you just laying on the ground and you just go at one Mississippi two. We're just waiting for this reign of, of footlocker to stop coming down on you.

Speaker 2:          00:25:37       Yeah, man. I was like, I tried to never going to stop, man. So what do you do? I would just, Oh, they're funny. They still all right. Hit enough, hit enough. Then everybody's hugging me. The same people that were beating my brains up. We're hugging me and kissing me. You'll, I love you. You're my boy. You're my family now. And they're like, wow.

Speaker 3:          00:25:57       So then you come home. Okay. And then you just sit in there, all right with Huc and sneaker mocks all over you and you're going like, okay, now I guess I'm in a gang. Jesus Christ. Okay. So then what happens? Um, I thought what happened was I started hanging around with white people. Talk about white privilege going to, what the fuck is that? This is what it is. Totally. Yes. It can sit there selling lemonade at the end of your driveway and accidentally, did I just join a gang? There was, there's a green light on you. You were selling lemonade at the end of the wrong driveway

Speaker 2:          00:26:34       neighborhood. Okay. Was dumb. But you know like there was two white boys in my neighborhood that were gangs

Speaker 3:          00:26:40       was one the red headed kid from children of the,

Speaker 2:          00:26:43       exactly. He was. He was. He said, well the one guy, he was a blood actually guy. He was from east La. Slow man. Econom okay. Those are, those are actually two white boys had offensive by the way, but continued. There was two white boys in the hood man. And they were both gangbangers and one thing about bought white boy Cholos like when you see a white boy join a gang and when you see a white guy that someone like you and you're hanging around with them, nothing but Mexicans, white white guys are the most craziest gangsters. When they were in a Mexican gang and they do stuff that a Mexican man would never think of. Like I remember this one white guy, slow man. He was a blood. He said, man, let's go do a home invasion. And I, and everybody was asking him where he goes, my mom house.

Speaker 3:          00:27:29       Oh, he wanted a home game. All right, that's not right.

Speaker 2:          00:27:32       And he wanted them, he wanted the Ibrance, the other homeys to rob his house because he wanted his mom and dad to get robbed. Why? Cause I don't know

Speaker 3:          00:27:41       man. They're probably saying stop hanging out with all those Mexicans, his idea. And I was like, Damn. So they probably behave that way. Cause they, they felt no matter what, they had to constantly proof, constantly men, because technically they could just get a haircut or whatever, put away the flannel and just slip, slip away, man. Slip away down at the Grove, slip away, become a social worker and that'll be it. So how long were you when this gang for, and did you ever get beaten out?

Speaker 2:          00:28:09       No, I was in his gang, um, when I'm father Greg Boyle and a, but they go to the year off. I went to Rehab. My Father Greg Boyle, took me to rehab and I'm, I, I disappeared for, I'm still gone. I never went back. Oh, he never went back or when you get beaten out of a gang, how uh, how long has that beat though? As long as they want to. Um, I knew what we had. I had a guy in the podcast named Fabian who was in a, in a gang and he talks about he got beat up, beat out. He got jumped out and he said that when he got jumped, they just last longer. But I'm, his uncle is doing the gang simple expression is doing the gang. So his uncle over saw him getting jumped out so he didn't get hurt that bad. Uh, I don't have a no go. I probably would have got killed if I got jumped out with him when I was 20

Speaker 3:          00:29:04       white version of that is our dad's the judge, so we don't go to jail or whatever the fuck we just did. Your version is that you got an uncle that overseas being jumped out? Yeah, I got tagged to it. I'm, I'm learning all kinds of stuff. Like I wonder, I don't know my case, somebody just walking by somebody recorder. So he's feels weird to have to like re hype something. So your special on HBO that you shot yourself learning all of your do it yourself stuff from fucking going around in those warehouses, making pillows out of nothing. You ended up shooting and said, uh, the, uh, the Improv in San Jose, which is one of my favorite color and then a great club. Cause you feel like you're doing a theater even though even it's a club, it's tremendous.

Speaker 1:          00:29:42       And a, you shot it there. It's going to be on Hbo September 30th at 10 o'clock called translate this. Now are you, I know you're a great joke writer, but you, uh, I saw an Irish affairs, you told that and he told the amazing story that you, you touched on today. Um, is your standup style on this more joke telling, more storytelling or both?

Speaker 2:          00:30:01       You know what my common special is? It's more about, um, it's more about how I got to this country with my parents and I'm being as a single father and being a cheater. But yeah, I cheat a lot. I get caught, cheat, cheating all the time. I'm bad. I can't help it. I love women. I tell her about getting caught cheating because I will cut cheating. You Know Bert? Both girls showed up to my house. Oh God. You know what I mean? Aliyah in a man. It was crazy and he asked me, are going to save for yourself? How long have you made? How long was that beat down? Was that long in 18 seconds. It was crazy. They showed up in the same car. Oh they, they talked to each other. Yeah, man. On how they film it and Shit. And then you go in there and then you're going to do like an apology and all that shit though. First 48 yeah. Wow. Okay, so you got to do it. I can't wait to see this photo, Michelle. I see. I really honestly do. All right,

Speaker 1:          00:31:07       stand up comedian. I cannot wait to see this. Thank you. One of the most interesting dudes. How are you so fucking happy?

Speaker 2:          00:31:12       Go lucky. I don't get it. I don't know much. I love life. You know, I'm never, I'm never going to go back to that type of life though, that I had in my twenties. And I'm just love living life man. And I'm not going to say that I'm perfect because I'm, I did fall off two hours where after I went to Rehab, I was sober for 11 years. I didn't touch no drugs. I didn't trust no alcohol, no beer or nothing. But, um, along the way you know that the more that the standup comedy, the more you know, I did it. I'm not going nowhere. I went back to smoking crack. She went right back to crack. She never really wear a booze guy, huh? No, it's probably an on booze. And he said, dude, it's like Ralphie may retweeted my tweet the other night and I'm, I don't understand what he meant at first because I was in Houston and he retweeted, um, what cha full of spoons, bro.

Speaker 2:          00:32:07       And then I, what the hell is Rafi? We're talking about them spools. Then I say, Oh shit, I got so coked out in Houston, Texas. I, I, they known for that day. I couldn't do no more coke and my nose was bleeding, so I wanted to rocket up and smoking crack instead. You know, cause I want to, Oh see you just like, I'm just going to snort a couple of lines. Yeah, but did you, did you anticipate like, we were like, fuck this, when I go to Houston I'm going to party or was was it just a spontaneous thing and all of a sudden you just said, fuck it. Oh Man, I was over there. I'll working the last stop in Houston. Shut out to Pete [inaudible] book in me, Pete, and often the laptop. Um, I've got, I've got, I started party man. I uh, I started partying and I couldn't find no powder, no coke. So I'm, I hope you don't mind me Italian dude. But I call it with Joel Diaz. I say, Hey, your deal, you know anybody over here, you caught me at six in the morning. What the fuck is wrong with you? You'll probably metrics in the morning. You fucking cock saga.

Speaker 2:          00:33:21       So I knew he knew somebody. I know he, he, uh, we go talk to this comedian. So I spoke to this comedian and then I'm this little Mexican food showed up all week taking care of me. I give them free tickets every day. I think you and um, I, I don't know what happened man, but I, I did too much coke. I felt like I can't do no more code through my nose, so I'm going to go bad. I want to smoke crack now. You know what I mean? I don't want to stay. I want burgers now. Dude. A reoccurring story with you is, I don't know what happened last time. He didn't know what happened. You were whipping somebody with the belt. Now you don't know what happened is like a fucking hole in your nose. Jesus do. Well, how long ago was this? This was them 2006.

Speaker 2:          00:34:08       All right, so you, okay, so you broke your record. You've gone, you've gone, it's 11. Yeah. Yeah. I called up, um, room service. The one is more cracked and I call it a committee of a color room. Service Room Service. I'm going to need, I'm a big spoon and a baking soda brought over right now. And they did not bring that to the room. Oh, they brought it man, they did two guys that brought here the governor front dead. He knew me cause I'm, I made friends with him, I already know from previous times and he brought it and it was like a big spoon and he brought the arm and hammer baking soda. And the guy with him, he just went with him to laugh at me, I guess. He goes, Hey, I guess he couldn't believe it. You know this guy just order baking soda and spoon.

Speaker 2:          00:34:53       No Way. Let's go see. So the bolt open a door. I they, they give it to me. They both laugh. But yeah, man, I wanted to smoke crack. Okay, so, and then, and then how long were you off the wagon for? From when? Okay, so you're sober for 11 years. You go to Houston, you order a spoon and some baking soda and now you snort coke, now you're smoking. I got you partied that weekend. Did you just come back and go, what the fuck was that? And were you able to or did you have to go to rehab and no man, I continue party man from that moment on and the grow with, with man, she ended up being a hermaphrodite but that was another story for another time, you know? But yeah, sure. The hermaphrodite she had, you were born with a peanut, then a vagina. Right?

Speaker 3:          00:35:41       So like how long was she your girlfriend before you figured that out?

Speaker 2:          00:35:43       Well, we were part of that three months. You must be a gentleman. Yes. That's what it was. I was a gentleman. I didn't want to touch her. Nothing because she broke freak, cold man. I can be that guy. So I just kissed her a couple of times, but then by the third night, you know, we're, we're, oh for three nice to rate her an I. But when I finally found out, I was like, whoa man. Yeah, that's a big skin tag you got there. So it was that. So was that enough to get your sober again? No, man. I think he's sober again to a 2009 that stop sign. All right, so now we're still going. I didn't get sober till 2009. Oh fuck.

Um, anyways, let's talk some NFL football. Went back, got bad. Boonoo Beatty. Did you guys enjoy it? Did your team. When

Speaker 3:          00:44:32       my team won the New England patriots, who everybody said was going to go undefeated and then we lost to the Kansas city chiefs and then everybody said, oh, wait a minute. Wait a minute. I think Tom Brady is old now. I think he's washed up. I think the Kansas City chiefs are going to win their first Superbowl since 1970 that's what everybody said, because the Kansas City chiefs beat the New England patriots in September. Now all of a sudden they can see January. How fucking crazy is that? Um, how many fucking times? How many times are you going to watch the giants go into when Owen three and just start writing them off. You saw all the points they scored. Huh? You think they're not going to come back and beat Philly? They're not going to come back and be Dallas later on this fucking year. When they all get on the same page.

Speaker 3:          00:45:17       They were protecting Eli much better according to the 30 seconds of highlights that I saw. I'm sticking by my prediction. New England patriots, New York giants, Superbowl rematch. All right. Until the Kansas City chiefs who I actually like until Andy Reid, who, I'm not saying he's fat until those fuckers do something in January. All right. I think all you need to sit down a little bit. If fucking relax with all your shit talk and how many fucking guys have you seen throw for 500 yards in the regular season and get bounced out and the first round of the playoffs, how many times did you see a fucking guy zigzagging all over the field? You can't tackle them and come playoff time. He sitting on a fucking exercise bike wearing a tinted windshield. Crossed his eyes. Huh? The incredible lack of fucking respect that you gave our little quarterback that could Tom Brady.

Speaker 3:          00:46:13       How dare you? How dare you? Right off the New England patriots after one fucking week. Huh? It's all wishful thinking. What common again, and we're going to take your hearts out and we're going to pull them out of your chest. We're going to show him to you and then we're going to under inflate them honor away to another fucking, actually, we never got caught doing that. They just suggested that we did it and they got laughed out of court. Um, and then do what I really need to address. Um, these stupid controversy of the fucking people taking a knee during the national anthem. You know, watching all these white people getting fucking upset by that. Like it really does. It really affect your fucking life and all these fucking idiots trying to make the point of what they're doing. It's not about your point. The people who started this thing, it's about my point.

Speaker 3:          00:46:59       It's about the way that I see it. You know, I had a buddy of mine go, yeah, these fucking guys are making $1 million. You know, he'd take his bad here. Why don't you go fucking move to Syria? It's like, why do they have to move? Why can't they just live here the way you do? I don't understand that dumb, but Donald Trump is a fucking genius. Daddy has everybody talking about this issue because he is trying to get everybody to stop focusing on the pool party he had with fucking Vladimir. What's his face over there in Russia? He doesn't want you watching that. He goes, oh, look at this over here. Right? He goes down to Alabama and he gets all them fuck and paypal all riled up, and he keeps talking about this fatty over and fucking North Korea. That's what he's still one. It reminds me of when, oh, fucking slick Willie, you know, bombed that country because he stuck his cigar and that woman's Nether region, this is the type of sick people that become president.

Speaker 3:          00:47:54       This is what they do. All right? They get caught doing some fucked up shit. And then I will say this about Trump least they didn't go bomb. Some people, unlike what's his face with his bitch hands, who now gets treated like a fucking hero. I don't understand that guy at all. You know what I mean? Ah Ha. Oh, that's great. Oh, I got caught. Get my Dick sucked on the overall office. So I bombed a country. I'm out of killed the baby, but I sleep lock one every night. Um, I know I'm a conspiracy theorist. I fucking hate them all. You just see that thing. Uh, what's his face and fucking, uh, Korea considered that we declared war on them, right? So, uh, uh, Maggie Magen Hall, whatever fucking name is, uh, Maggie Gyllenhaal, what is it? What is the fucking, the poor woman who has to go out and fucking give the press conferences now because that dude with no neck, you know, who kind of looks like the political version of Roger Goodell went out there and fucked it all up.

Speaker 3:          00:48:51       The hell's her name? She's got a classic political name. I don't know what the hell it is. She said the fact that North Korea thinks that we're at war with them is absolutely preposterous or something like that. And then like a week before, what's his face? Trump basically tweeted like that, that fatty over there wasn't long for this earth. And it's like you kinda just said he's not gonna last, he's not going to be around long. That's what he said. Yeah. I mean, I would take that as a threat. We'll have a dash for his habit. Daesh, um, you know what they really need to do? They both need to just go to a whorehouse together and fucking grow up, you know, Bang, a couple of whores they need to do a threesome, right? One of them is getting blown the others hitting it doggy style and just their eyes meet and they just start laughing being like, this is a great life.

Speaker 3:          00:49:34       Right? You've got a personal chef to yeah, it's fucking amazing. You live in a castle, live in a White House. I mean, it's fun. It's cool. They should just talk about, you know, trade stories, the way comedians trade stories about bombing. They could just talk about fucking bomb and other countries and I dunno what fishing, whatever, whatever people at that level talk about. All right, let's get to the questions for this week. So I don't have any fucking problem. Uh, with these, these guys taking a knee, I try to listen to what it's about rather than getting wrapped up in what, uh, what, what it means to me. Um, uh, pharmacists writing in dear Billy bag chaser. I don't know what that means. Um, by the way, people 39 days sober, 39 fucking days. And this is, this is how well I'm doing with my sobriety. I, when I flew to Canada, I went by this duty free and there's this, uh, Macallan rare cask.

Speaker 3:          00:50:29       They got this new one black oak or some shit like that. And I was like, I'm going to buy that. Okay, I'm not going to take it to fucking Canada then suck it down like a fucking jackass. I'm just going to have this thing waiting for me. You know what I mean? For whenever I fall off the wagon. So this is like what I was thinking the whole ride in and like, you know, I'm getting off the plane, I'm trying to beat the crowd to get over to the taxi line cause I don't fucking Uber, I never remember to set up a car. So I always go to the fucking taxi line. And what's great at lax is, is never anybody there because nobody fucking takes a taxi. Everybody's got a friend to pick him up. Um, I don't know what the fuck they do. There's always plenty of cabs, so I don't even try to be first in line at the cap stand. I go out of my way over to this duty free place and I grabbed this fucking thing,

Speaker 6:          00:51:15       you know, and I like

Speaker 3:          00:51:18       bring it up to the counter and the lady goes, Oh my God. She goes, fucking, uh, what a wonderful choice and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. You have great tastes like I am. I go, I'm on the wagon when I come off, this is the bottle I'm opening up. She goes, are you going to Canada? I said, Nope, I'm going home. And she goes, yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:51:33       Oh, I'm sorry I can't sell you this. And I'm like, why not? She goes, you have to be going to Kansas, some of the about the duty free. And I'm like, it's, it's legal though. Do they sell this anywhere else in the airport? If you just going back right

Speaker 3:          00:51:46       to your home? They're like, no, no, we don't.

Speaker 6:          00:51:50       So I dunno.

Speaker 3:          00:51:52       So I had a fucking hissy fit. I had a fucking hissy fit

Speaker 1:          00:51:56       hi to hissy fits. One of the way they're going through Canadian customs. When they made me take the delined green plastic cover off of my fucking laptop, like I somehow had a bomb in there or some sort of bomb residue and I'm literally taking it off going, I'm going to crack this thing. And they go, well just try to take it off easily.

Speaker 6:          00:52:12       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:52:14       It's just like when you look, I love it. Like fucking howdy duty. What? What? I'm in this matrix. I like what's going on? Tell me what you want me to do the fuck. So they make me take that fucking thing off. Ended up cracking the cover. Some are in a bad mood. So rather than, you know, growing up and realizing that these fucking people at that, what is it that to Tca TCP, whatever, fuck it took a tea, what is it called? Tsa. Tsa. The fucking Tsa. Rather than just realizing these people are trying to protect me, which I don't think that trying to do. I think they're trying to make it as inconvenient as fucking possible. So I'll agree to have my fucking retina scan so they can share that fucking information and gradually build a fucking robot.

Speaker 6:          00:52:59       Sorry, put this fucking headphones back. Um,

Speaker 1:          00:53:04       yeah, so all I wanted was a bottle of booze. That's all I wanted and they wouldn't sell it to me. They wouldn't sell it to me. So I went online and off. I'll figure out a fucking place to get it. All right, let's, let's do the little right in here. Um, pharmacist writing in a dear Billy bag chaser. Your rant on pharmacists last week was hilarious. We have to be able, able to laugh at ourselves. Right. I just wanted to weigh in on a couple of things. First off, the medication you were prescribed, the antiinflammatory drug you received was in the nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug class. How to fuck. Do you know you didn't even look at it? Maybe you've just be, Ya know, I can tell just by the way he's talking about it, I understand. Basically these drugs decrease the formation of prostaglandins and thromboxane named those chemicals are involved in the inflammation process, which itself causes pain. So these drugs cannot just decrease inflammation without also decreasing pain. That's being labeled a painkiller. Oh, okay.

Speaker 5:          00:54:09       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:54:10       End Saids are not in the opioid family. Okay. Are Not happy habit forming. I don't know what this guy's talking about, but it sounds like he's blowing my argument out of the water. However, they can be very dangerous in susceptible.

Speaker 5:          00:54:23       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:54:24       Populations. Why can't you say with addicts, society, the bull populations, you guys are such fucking creeps in that world. And Sade's n s a I. D. S.

Speaker 5:          00:54:36       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:54:36       And ceds increased the risk of cardiac events, kidney damage and stomach ulcers. I'm sorry, recovered addicts. Uh, usually in the elderly or those with preexisting conditions. I'm not sure what the other drug you receive was. If it was a narcotic opioid painkiller and the doctrine pharmacist did not discuss it with you, they would be now negligible on their parts since when? Since when? I want to know now that the, uh, the fucking heroin epidemic is completely out of control in the state of Ohio is suing pharmaceutical companies. I guarantee I graduated four years ago and the dangers of narcotics was extremely stressed. Now all the medical bodies are communicating the dangers of narcotics to practitioners and overseeing that prescribing is done appropriately. And maybe this is just the fucking,

Speaker 5:          00:55:25       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:55:25       It's just how we are. You know, like when we first, they first had that DDT and they sprayed it all over the place and this is like great. We just end it all these plagues and then we did all this damage to the environment. We created this fucking window that is starting to close I feel where it was this golden age of not having to walk around with a fucking boil on your face and dying of the black plague. And um,

Speaker 5:          00:55:47       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:55:48       We just got a little out of control with it, which would have been great is if as we eradicated all of these different diseases, if we somehow didn't grow the population, I feel like that's the sweet spot. I feel like that's what the fuck [inaudible] Illuminati should be discussing is like what is the optimal number of people, including ourselves of course, who should be allowed to survive while we keep all the modern day technologies. So we can still live this awesome flat screen life with no plagues.

Speaker 5:          00:56:18       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:56:18       But like we also can still sustain like living on this fucking planet. What is thing? What is, what does that number and they're not taking college cause they're a fucking close to entity. All right, let me read a few more of these. How much time are we up to at this point? We're at 18 minutes. 18 minutes plus 37 is 55. Okay. All right, so here we go. Gold money.com day or Billy copper nuts. Uh, I heard you talk about gold money.com on your pot Monday morning podcast, wherever emailed you about it. Didn't explain it very well. I feel like all these are just like free commercials. Um, I haven't put any money into it yet, but now I'm going to speak about it as an authority. Uh, but I am considering it as it seems pretty legit. If you listened to Rogan's podcast with Peter Schiff, he explains it pretty well and makes a good pitch. Yeah. But that guide stands to profit off it granted shift admits that he invested money in the company. Yeah. So he's out. He's out. I want an independent fucking data. I can even find that anymore. Evidently they sell you the gold at a low market price, half of 1%, I think.

Speaker 1:          00:57:29       What do you mean ha? Half of 1% of what? That's just sort of a number floating out there, right. Uh, stored for you in a vault of your choosing with your name on it. And if you want it, they will actually mail your goal to you for free. Minimum of them have like five grams or something. You also get a mastercard debit card that you can use to spend your gold slash money. Evidently you can use, you can even get a debit card that is made of real gold, which sounds fucking baller. The Federal Reserve and powers that may be, may never let it work, but it seems like a great idea. At least. Thanks. And Go fuck yourself. Yeah, there's a bunch of great ideas. Yeah, I'm all set on that.

Speaker 1:          00:58:09       Hey, you give me your cash and uh, we'll put it in gold in a vault that you choose. That's not where you can say it. Um, all right. Dating and Saudi Arabia. Now mate, maybe. I Dunno, I, it sounds like a, even if their, their mind is in the right place, it's going to go belly up and then they're all gonna write themselves bonus checks off your gold. That's what I would guess what happened. Or the Federal Reserve will come in and say this is all illegal and take all the gold and then act like it's in Fort Knox when it's really fucking, uh, I dunno. I Dunno what the fuck it is. Somewhere in the Hamptons. All right. Dating and Saudi Arabia. Hey there, Billy pie. Billy the pie maker. Hope you're having a great day. Anyways, I wanted your advice on this problematic shit that I'm stuck in. I met this

Speaker 7:          00:58:51       lady

Speaker 1:          00:58:53       through a common friend of ours. Oh God. We talk, this is nuts. It's going to get messy when you break up with her and you're going to lose her Anna Front. Uh, we talked, she's really cool person and we've got a lot of things in common. Then we met again twice as a friend and now I want to ask her out. But here's the thing, she is a Gypson and I'm Indian and we live in Saudi Arabia. Rabia and dating is illegal here. Well then what the fuck did you go out with their four? Now your heart's going to get cause you to get your fucking, what did they do? Have their beat your feet in the square. You're going to fucking slap your dick around in public or something. Whatever the punishment is over there. I made the authority could deport you immediately or worse, send you to jail for years. Now, I really liked this girl more than your freedom.

Speaker 1:          00:59:43       All right? Now I really liked this girl and like, you're not even love this girl. And I've already thought of of names for our kids before she even said yes to me. But I'm really stuck on thinking through my brain. Okay, this is second language here. I'm gonna try to help this out here from really stuck here, which she should I think through my brain and through my Dick. Uh, should, I will do none of that is your heart. So you should just leave. Should I ask her out and open for a whole nother level of problems or so they just shut the fuck up. Any advice from, he was highly appreciated. Love the podcast and love you as a brother. Go Fuck Yourself. There's not a woman or a man out there worth going to fucking prison in Saudi Arabia. I know a bad the prisons are of here.

Speaker 1:          01:00:28       I don't know what they like over there. You guys got a lot of oil money. Although I did run into this guy from Saudi Arabian who is laughing his ass off and he goes, dude, we don't, we don't all have oil money. Now's a sec. All right, fair enough. There's oil men over here. I don't have any of that money. Yeah, do it. I would walk away from the shit. It's fucking illegal. You could go to jail. You get deported. You know what I mean? And even if you love somebody, they're going to annoy the shit out of yourself. I mean, is that worth going to jail for? You know, I mean, is it illegal to just banger, but then if you love her, I dunno. I Dunno. I, I would, I would get out of that.

Speaker 6:          01:01:01       Uh, I get out of it. All right.

Speaker 1:          01:01:04       All right. Great movie scene, unknown actor. All right. Oh yeah. I was talking about, uh, this is the, uh, this is a new topic here where I was talking about actors that you saw just to like five lines in a fucking movie and they absolutely destroyed it and you and your friends still quote them. You don't even know their fucking names. I brought it that guy last week, the guy from pulp, a reservoir dogs, the guy in, you know when Tim Roth's character is a, what is he? He's in the fucking bathroom and that cop's telling that story. I said, buddy, I am going to shoot you in the face. You don't put your fucking hands. And that dashboard, love that guy. So he, he goes, one of my favorite scenes with an unknown actor was kill bill to bill's brother Bud. I wish I need to see these movies to do this justice.

Speaker 1:          01:01:51       I mean, I saw this but I don't remember it. Um, she, she wore the same outfit, that fucking yellow outfit, both movies than she bill's brother Bud is working as a bouncer at a rundown strip club. He shows up late for work, gets called into his boss's office. His boss, Larry Gomez is played by actor Larry Bishop and he looks like half a wolf man after doing a line of blow with the haggard looking stripper. I vaguely remember this. He levels his gaze at buzz and bud and says, uh, I don't know what car wash you worked before you came here that let you stroll in 20 minutes late. But it wasn't owned by view of what, it wasn't owned by me and I own a fucking car wash. I just butchered that line. People I can't really, I realized that I needed glasses and I have slight dyslexia.

Speaker 1:          01:02:39       Um, like I was trying to write squawk today and I knew all the letters. I just could not remember cause I was trying to remember what squawking 7,700 versus 7,500. I always get those two mixed up. If that's an emergency landing or a fucking hijacking, I was cause one stay alive and the other is fucking go to heaven. Um, all right. Sorry. That's how you remember it. 75 stay alive. 77 go to heaven. All right. 75 is hijacking. 77 is emergency and 76 Nita fixed meets you fucking radios out. This doesn't mean anything to you guys. Um, I don't know what car wash you worked before you came here that let you stroll in 20 minutes late, but it wasn't owned by me and I own a fucking car wash day. You Go. That was a good fucking read. That makes me want to go see that movie.

Speaker 1:          01:03:26       He said he then proceeded to give this worldclass assassin a humiliating dress down, telling him he's as useless as an asshole on his elbow and crossing off all his scheduled work days on the calendar. He finishes by telling him never to wear his cowboy, had to work and has cleaned a clog toilet on his way out. All Bud can do is stand there and take it. I hope you've seen this great movie. If not, it's worth the watch. Thanks. And Go fuck yourself. I'm going to go watch it again. All right. I think I'm a think this bit is going to make people go see these cool movies again and it's also going to make everybody laugh at how bad I can't fucking read out loud. All right bill. My favorite line in a comedy ever might be from, from

Speaker 3:          01:04:07       blazing saddles delivered by slim pickins. He rides into the scene where his workers are singing, uh, camp. Is it Camptown races? I was, I was camp Camptown races and says what in the wide wide world of sport is going on here. I hired two people to try to get, I had you people to try to get a little track late, not to jump around like a bunch of Kansas City faggots. I remember that line. Whatever the hell that means. And I'm quoting a movie by the way, before everybody gets all fucking uptight about the, uh, you know, Richard Pryor road on that. And he was actually supposed to be the leading it and then they went with the, the other actor and I don't know any of the actress names. Okay. Three number three, Bill, you asked for movie lines said by a non movie star actress that your listeners friends talked about from my group of friends. It's aligned from Ghostbusters. When Peter Venkman, uh, Bill Murray shows up to Dana's w weaver apartment right after the dog monster runs loose from Louis. Tell you I've never seen that movie. I've never seen Ghostbusters. Just not a Scifi guy. Vanke is that considered vanquish shows up to this scene and asks a cop what happened. And the cop nonchalantly replies, uh, some more on brought a cougar to a party and it went buzzer.

Speaker 6:          01:05:32       Yeah.

Speaker 3:          01:05:33       My friends and I have been quoting that cop for years. Check it out at two 30 of the following. Oh, I can, I can look at these. Fuck, I can click on the links. This is even better. Why have me read it when I can click on the links. All right. We'll compare my read.

Speaker 6:          01:05:50       I get around. It was 120 to three k is the mold off the board when you were a slave, you sang live, Bert. Come on. How bad our good old nigger work song.

Speaker 3:          01:06:08       Jesus Christ. What the fuck? Kind of lucky is sending me here. I thought that was going to go to your fucking oh boy. Oh boy. Am I going to have to have an apology video here? What the fuck just happened? Oh it, let's do I do this other one. This one.

Speaker 8:          01:06:25       How are you doing? Why didn't you have some of the free, it's at room temperature if you think it's too warm in here. All right.

Speaker 3:          01:06:33       Fuck. All these things he thinks are going to be too long and evidently they, they have the n word in them. Yeah. Boy, do I need to take a knee after this one? All right. Number four. I have two unknown and unheralded actors with memorable movie lines. Both are the Great Mel Brooks movies. Uh, the first one is the Roman soldier in the history of the world, part one, the emphasis is approaching, but the, there's a horse and a carriage. And the way the Roman soldier looks directly at the camera and says, move that miserable piece of shit. Uh, the over the top way delivers the line, comes out of nowhere. I say it all the time and the, uh, and the best impression I could, do you know what I gotta do? I have to get the actual clips for this to work because what I'm now doing is ruining.

Speaker 3:          01:07:16       I'm ruining great movies. All right. Girlfriend believes in ghosts. Uh, all right. Girlfriend believes in ghosts dear grandmaster be, I met this lady a few weeks ago. Things went really good. She's very cool. I found her good looking and we have a lot of stuff to talk about. I didn't have a great a lot of, I didn't have a lot of relationships in the past. I'm 32 and I picked up my game about four years ago. Everything was great until we went to a restaurant one day and she told me she believes in ghosts, not just that she said she actually sees them and even God patients who come to her for treatment about it. I tried to be open minded about it. Oh my God, I can just hear the silverware hitting the plates at this point, trying to compare it to people who believe in God, but her believing in this keeps bugging me.

Speaker 3:          01:08:04       I'm not saying she's crazy or wrong. Who am I to know? But she doesn't sit right the way I see the world. Well then fucking dropper. This is the thing. Now this is whole fucking straight across the board. You have to look at everything like all the leaves are brown and the sky is gray. Like if you're dating and somebody does something and it makes you buddy, you just body literally go like, what the fuck? And then you're literally, you're going to fight that feeling and go, well, maybe I need to stop being so ghost of phobic. It's like, no, it's fucking ghost. It's weird. You know you, you're going to fucking live with Whoopi Goldberg's character from ghosts. That's what you're gonna do. People trying to sit on her and shit trying to sit on your [inaudible]. That's what you're going to sign up for me if that's what you're into.

Speaker 3:          01:08:50       By all means do it, but if you're on a date and that there's like, that's a major fucking thing because it's not like she just believes in and every once in a while she's going to hear a thump in the house and start telling you it's a ghost. When you're like, honey, it's fucking air in the pipes. All right, we just have to fucking turn on the faucet. You know? Remember if the plumber did work today and they shut it off for a second, that that's what that is. You know, that's not that she actually, she's going to become like a ghost hunter and all of that stuff and uh, gradually she's going to get, start dressing more and more like she can predict the future and you don't want to fuck that. You know what I mean? When they start wearing those long flowing things, you know, just, you just so many layers of clothes to try to pick up to just get it going.

Speaker 3:          01:09:31       You know, you start wearing like curtains and shit. You don't need that anyways. All right. I'm sorry. That whole fucking movie thing, just, I dunno. Can you guys just send me the Goddamn clip or I guess you sent me the clip. What I should've done was cue it up. I tried to do too many things. I tried to promote shit. I tried to do all that and then do the whole thing and the whole fucking thing just fell apart. All right. Let me just finish with this last thing. Uh, a buddy of mine is opening a fucking, uh, a new comedy club on the upper west side in Manhattan. Okay. Friday, October six and October 7th. It's like a little 100 seat fucking club. I'm going to be coming to the town in November and I'm going to pop in and do a spot. I love little clubs like that.

Speaker 3:          01:10:17       Uh, let's see here. Uh, Russman. Money's going to be there. Greer Barnes, Mark Norman, John Fisch, rod small, Brian Scott McFadden. Uh, and many more. It's going to be a great show. Uh, if you're on the upper east side, upper west side, sorry, it's on a two oh one west 75th streets right next to the beacon theater, which is also cool. You know what I mean? You go in there and you fucking do your spots and you come out and you go, wow. Someday I'll be across the street. It's tremendous. Give it a shot. If you're in town, uh, Friday, October six and October 7th, I got the hiccups. That's the podcast. Please check out. Philippe espouses a standup special. Um, what's it called? Translate this September 30th on Hbo. 10:00 PM it feels more like indigestion. I have any meeting today. All right. Go fuck yourselves. I'll check in on you on Thursday.
