Finally the fucking, uh, we're finally putting out F is for family. I know I've been talking about this shit, but I got to do it tomorrow. I got to do, I'm doing, I'm fucking media boy, monkey boy. Going to be fucking going all over town and all over that on the fucking phone and all that shit. Talking about this wonderful new show that we have a coming out. So if you guys can do something for me, I would really appreciate it by watching it. December eight teeth on Netflix there. I got it out of the way.

Speaker 1:          00:00:54       All right. Um, and any ways, and also thank you for everybody who watched the, uh, the pie crust video, Huh? Oh, Billy Baker got over 600,000 hits, you know, and I learned some shit. Some people like don't use CRESCO, you should use fucking Lod. And you know, it's funny, it was somebody bought me, got me a thing of lard and I keep forgetting to use it, so I'm going to try that next time. And then also people set a better way to pick up the pie crust is your fucking slowly roll it over with the uh, the rolling pin. I didn't know either one of those, but the guy who told me, I read it on some fucking website, he just goes, oh bill, Bill, Bill, Bill, Bill. Like 20 bills. You were doing so well. The, the, the just say to you, fuck. You know, so you know how to pick up a fucking pie crust better than I do. Why don't you just fucking tell me how to do it? Why do you gotta to act like the fucking sky just fell. It didn't, my pie cross came out fine. Everybody is such a fucking cunt. You know, what amazes me about adult is that whole fucking thing that he just did. Oh, Bill. Bill, Bill. You know what that really is? That is literally his fucking inner child. Literally going, mommy, mommy, mommy, mommy. Look at me. I know how to do it better. It's like, just fucking grow up.

Speaker 1:          00:02:10       Am I being a Katrina? I don't think I am. Oh, Jesus is showing the fucking highlights of the Patriots. Special teams. So fumbled another fucking punt. Gave these jerk off Texans and other, no, that chance here. I'll tell you right now, I don't buy JJ watts intensity. I just don't buy it. I think he's just hammered it up for the fucking cameras. He's got a fucking scowl on his face before the game even starts. You know what I made? What are you mad at? Jumping Jacks. Touching your toes. That's stupid. Fucking commercial with a blue grass band. Starts spraying water on his face and then he yells at his locker and then there's nobody there. I get it. He gets up for games. You know? Gimme Ray Lewis. Anytime. I would rather have ray Lewis screaming and yelling. You know what I mean? Did that fucking supersized astronaut at.

Speaker 2:          00:03:01       Gotcha.

Speaker 1:          00:03:04       I've just fucking with you. He's a great player and I'm so psyched. Half his hand, his fucking one of his hands is wrapped up. Thank God we would have been in fucking trouble this game. Hopefully you're not sitting there with some fucking caddy to canary smile on your face knowing that I'm going to do the rest of this podcast watching the Patriots somehow blow a 14 point lead. I know that's not going to happen, right? Get Out. Ah, you fucking cunts over the middle. Um, so anyways, I uh, I got here on Thursday. I've been doing some stand up, um, getting ready for these talk shows and Shit I got to do, I'm doing a tonight show, Jimmy Fallon on a Tuesday and then Wednesday I'm in La Doing Conan and then I'm on fucking, I'm officially on God damn vacation. But um, I had a great week, dude.

Speaker 1:          00:03:53       Had a great time being back here in New York. It is unsettlingly warm. The only thing more scary about how fucking warm it is back here is people's reaction to it. They fucking love it. These east coast people have to take it it in the face old man winter every fucking year day. You know, the overwhelming response to global warming up to this point is like, yeah, bring it on. I'm loving this. I literally, I saw a woman and a fucking half shirt, not a half shirt. She had a belly show and like she was going to be a dancer, bind a one of them fucking chicks. It can't really sing, you know, and they use the auto tone since they got to show their tits a little bit, you know, showed the little naughty little bits a little better than naughty bits. Right? She's walking down the street and I'm like, I was like, oh my God.

Speaker 1:          00:04:42       When I saw she was gorgeous, then I was just thinking like, dude, it's four and have the fucking half. I was like, this is December 10th. She's walking down the street like it's uh, April applause of leave in May. And um, I was, I, you know, so then I went on stage. I was joking about it at the stand in this fucking lady in the front row. Just all she could talk about, she was just nodding and nodding and nodding. I was just going, you know, you realize just how fucking cities going to look like Venice, it's going to be underwater. Right. And she was just going like, yeah, I know what I love. So whether it's just it's over, it's fucking, I, I have, I am convinced of it. It's fucking over. People will choose that convenience right in front of their face and they won't see the volcano fuck interrupted. You know, in the distance. They don't give a fuck if in that moment they hand in the face is going to fucking be more soothing. That's what the fuck they gonna look at and who's getting no, I don't have any solutions and a part of the problem, but at least, at least this is the only thing I could say. At least I have the decency to be afraid

Speaker 2:          00:05:47       I'm not, I'm not

Speaker 1:          00:05:48       doing anything about it. I'm trying to eat less fish. I feel bad for the base board. Am I going to do? Just me walking around being alive. I'm contributing to this shit. Not a mention of flying halfway across the fucking slowly across the country to promote a fucking cartoon. Get on the ball. That's a live ball. Fuck you. That's not an incomplete pass. Fuck you. Oh, you fucking bastards.

Speaker 2:          00:06:13       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:06:14       Anyways, um, now they're saying now that having a discussion, now they have a discussion. What happened? He went back out. It's clearly an incomplete. Ah, I duNno. This is going to be one of the ones that it, he stopped his hand motion going forward. He stopped the throwing motion and grip the fucking ball.

Speaker 2:          00:06:33       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:06:35       These stupid fucking replace in the NFL. You know, going to the, uh, the video booth. This is like,

Speaker 2:          00:06:41       yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:06:41       it turned all of these moments like this. This is why I hate NBA basketball.

Speaker 2:          00:06:47       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:06:48       Is the timeout, the timeout, the timeout. How fucking long it takes. By the way, congratulations to the Golden State Warriors winning 28 fucking games in a row. I don't think that, that, I'm trying to think of what that could ever be broken. I mean that's, that is insane. And as much as they didn't break the Lakers, um,

Speaker 1:          00:07:08       the, their record, that was still amazing and I wish I could actually have watched the fucking double overtime game against the Celtics and it looked like an instant classic. Of course I was out, uh, you know, telling jokes and that type of shit. Um, I'm sorry. I guess I need you guys, somebody, people always ask me how to talk about hoop. I just can't fucking watch it. I try, I like college hoops. You know, I actually was going to watch North Carolina cause once again they got a great team. They're fucking ranked second the fuck it tie heels right in. I came in there but we, you know, my wife always sits down and she wants, she wants to watch a dumb TV. She goes, can you just sit down and watch dumb TV? Is that fucking Kardashians Shit? Which has been on a God damn loop that shit the other day.

Speaker 1:          00:07:51       Okay. And um, it was on, you know, they got an f episodes now. It's like the fucking Simpson's whether you can just do a whole weekend of nothing but the Simpsons, you can do that with the Kardashians. Not so she just kept watching them and watching them and I literally, I had to get up and walk into the bedroom and closed the door. It that the show, it literally puts me in a fucking bad mood. Um, I know that there's a, there's a clip I just saw on Facebook. Of course, I'm on Facebook. I'm a white gay in my forties. I love Facebook as much as the youngsters hate it. Everything they hate about it. I fucking love about it. But anyways, this some local news show or whatever, and this guy just, he just fucking sums up. He snaps. He completely loses his composure and just says like, nobody gives a fuck about this stupid fucking family. And the, these two chicks laughing, one of them agrees and then the other like, just breathe. Just breathe. Like that makes it better. It's like just enough already.

Speaker 1:          00:08:50       I, my, my wife has it on so much. I'm actually starting to understand like the dude, you know who looks like a fucking mannequin, he's got perfect hair, perfect white teeth. He's always walking around in a suit, but he's never at work. And I finally just sit there. I go, what the fuck does that guy do for a living? And they're like, eh. You know, nobody really knows. Nobody knows what he does. You know? He's always walking around like a dress like Bud Fox, and then I'm like, oh my God, I'm getting sucked into this thing. So I just, I just went into the other room. It's just an endless fucking pursuit. They just constantly traveling. I love like when they go to the Dominican Republican, did they interact with the people? They go right to the fucking resort and there's sitting next to a fucking infinity Paul. You know what I mean? It's just, it's like, why did you, why did you just stay home? You already live in that climate. You're dumb fucks. Let me tell you about the time I went to the Dominican Republic. I went there and they took us nice, oh fuck, fuck. Get that mother. Fuck you fat. Fuck, it's not yours. Goddamn that fat fuck. He landed right on it.

Speaker 3:          00:09:57       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:09:58       Probably thought it was a pork shoulder. Oh Great. When we get hurt. Wonderful.

Speaker 1:          00:10:04       Ah, for fuck sakes. Anyways, so I got to Dominican Republic, um, with the wonderful lady I was dating at the time. Fuck that relationship up as I did everyone and until I met my lovely wife, um, and we stayed at a resort, right? We show up and I got there. And what then? Too far like east, you see what, how people are living as you drive in there and you're like, holy fuck. It was my first time and I a so called Third World country. I didn't know what the fuck that means. It just always means it's a bunch of broke people. I don't, I don't know. Fucking like

Speaker 1:          00:10:40       staggering. You know, I saw a couple of nice houses and everything else. It was like a fucking tin shack and we're fucking blowing by all this poverty and you're taking it all in. It's an absolute shock when you're spoiled ass fucking American. All right, now I'll give a fuck what your situation is in this country for the most part, you'll live in like a fucking king compared to this stuff, right? So we end up getting to the resort and then all of a sudden everybody has only these fucking Hawaiian shirts saying hello, asking to take your bags. And it's like, well, am I supposed to forget what the fuck I just saw still the entire time I'm on this a vacation. What's funny about the resort is this, like literally like a prison wall all the way around the whole fucking thing. And he just feel it.

Speaker 1:          00:11:25       You just felt it like late at night. If I get too close to that wall, somebody is going to reach over. It yanked be over it and no one's ever going to see me again because that's the level of desperation down here. And um, my favorite part slash the scariest part of the trip was a, we actually went horseback riding and we went to a, a cave where there was water. You went to the water and he had to go underwater and then come up to the other side of the different cave. I know this sounds like a fucking hardy episode, but we actually did it and I remember, uh, the tour guide, the tour guide that took us, I had to stop at his fucking house. So I am sitting there and the front passenger seat of his car as everybody is looking at me, basically the widest motherfucker on the planet.

Speaker 1:          00:12:17       And, uh, and I had to sit there like, are they looking at me like Jesus Christ? How often do you see a redheaded white dude down here where they looking at me like a white elephant? Oh, are they looking at me like a, you know, God knows what our foreign policy did then. Now they're in that situation. I had no fucking idea, but it's definitely a, I dunno, I, but I was glad, still glad I did it. I still went out to interact that it actually gave the horseback thing and the Cave Shit, I actually was given money to people outside of that fucking resort. It just, it didn't feel right. Does that make any sense? I don't fucking know watching the fucking game here. But anyways, um, nay, I'm talking about the Kardashians. I late, they go to all these impoverished places and they just still end up next to an infinity pool, which to me is like, why the fuck would you leave? You're not interested cause she'd starving and he got food. Right. Okay. She just went like 20 fucking times. Um, she asked me a win. This game was going to be over because she wanted to watch dumb TV. And I was like, I wanted to be like, we know what this is my dump TV. This is my keeping up with the Kardashians. I watched the Patriots.

Speaker 1:          00:13:31       Come on Neil, look at Tom Brady. Isn't he dreamy? He looks like that guy with no job on the, uh, the Kardashians, doesn't he? Except he's a man. Um, anyways, so, uh, today in New York, I actually went to the premiere of a movie called Daddy's home starring Mark Wahlberg and uh, will Ferrell it a, that comes out and then go on Christmas Day. And if you blink, you'll miss me. I have a small part in and I got to go there, EH, fuck. Alegria Yard my way through this whole fucking thing. I imagine I am. Um, oh first he's on his way verse. He's on his way. I think I'm in. This is going to be a two parter. There's going to be the first part I do today. You know what? Who's kidding who? This point, you know what? This podcast just became late. I was hoping I could finish this thing before verse he got here. I got media all day tomorrow and I told Paul is going to go out and go get a beer with them. I'm going to do that so nia can watch dumb TV and we'll go out to a bar. I'm going to watch the rest of the game there. I confess, but you know what? I did make the pie crust video. I hope it helped you guys out. And uh, it's got over 600,000 hits that fucking pikers videos got more hits than most of my specials.

Speaker 1:          00:14:45       And this week I actually finally was able, those ribs that I was smoking I was telling you about, they came out fucking, and what I learned was it doesn't matter at least on the green egg, the big green egg, like, uh, as long as you got smoked that first hour and a half, something like, um, ribs. Not, I'm a total fucking novice. This is a second time ever tried it. It's the first time I ever did it successfully. Uh, the other time I had to finish him off in the oven, which isn't necessarily bad. Um, oh good. Nia just got fucking two ply toilet paper. Three ply. You got the most ply toilet paper, right? Oh my God. I can't tell you who stayed here. I'm not going to tell you stayed here, but he stayed here and he fucking loaded this place up. It's not even, it's not even one ply toilet paper. It's like literally almost see through, um, I don't know what he was trying to do, but all I know is I would rather wipe my ass with sandpaper there. I said it. All right. Look, I understand if you're in a financially rough place, but you know, can you put a price, you know what I mean? I might as well take a belt sander the car.

Speaker 4:          00:16:00       Yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:16:00       there's a crack of my ass. It's like, what are we doing here? You know, it's very easy to go steal some Kleenex out of these fucking stores, give you ass a fighting chance. Anyways. Um, so I found what the big green egg, what I did was, uh, I followed all the, the videos basically of how to start the fire. One of these guys, they always make these fucking videos on how to smoke something and all they talk about is there rubs and how long they leave it in there. And the most important fucking thing on the big green egg is do what is your fire look like? What's the percentage, you know, those burned up fucking coals versus your year, your wood. So I did, uh, I did like half of that or not the shit that's got the chemical on it before. Everybody gives me a rough time.

Speaker 1:          00:16:48       It's the shit that looks like how a tree looks when it's in the middle, after a forest fire and it's put out. I use that natural shit. And then I had these big blocks of Hickory that I'm told, it doesn't make a difference if you soak them or not. Um, so I didn't soak those, but then I had a bunch of those, just the chips that you soak overnight. I soak those things overnight and I had an insane amount of smoke for the first about hour and a half of the cook. And um, I kept it roughly at about two 50 the entire time. And uh, some people might think that's a little high. I don't know what they came up. So rather than doing it for four hours, I took it out about three 43 45 they came out great. A Post, a couple of pictures of it, but, uh, one of the most exciting parts of my week was Nia tried them and came out to the kitchen and fucking high five me and did a little dance. It's the fuck was, you know what the, that was the highlight, you know, cause I know we don't, I made the ribs and he actually enjoyed them.

Speaker 1:          00:17:54       No, no, but I was trying something new. All right, thank you. Do you know what, there's one of the little, sometimes you just know when you're not supposed to talk to you. I fry now she's focused on something else. So maybe I know it the shit out of her earlier. I have no fucking idea. But let's get all of the budget's been like fucking running my yap here. Let's, uh, what do we got now? I've got to type in the fucking password. Go.

Speaker 1:          00:18:16       Uh, Jesus Christ. What? You know what I love? How fucking difficult you have to make these fucking pot, these a passwords. You know what I mean? Like, do you have like governmental secrets in here? Um, oh, Friday night or Saturday nights, you guys watch the fucking UFC. How insane with those fights? I don't know anybody's fucking name. How do they go on? I'm at Greg. Um, did you see that one fight? That dude was, he was like this. I didn't know what the fuck to call the guy. He's got to have some sort of nickname. He just got on this guy's back and he wouldn't get off of him. Every time he did like go to shake them off, he'd keep getting back on. I mean it's like, you know you ever have like a fucking, I don't know. Your fingers are wet and you pick up a hair and you're trying to get it off.

Speaker 1:          00:18:59       You've got to wipe it on something else and then somehow it just comes back to you. You know what I was like, can you take out cellophane but whatever. The dead Saran wrap shit, it just starts sticking to itself and he tried to fucking, I get and do what I can save it. I can save in the, I have to fuck this piece. Right. That's what he was, he was like the human version. That's not a good nickname for fucking a fighter. Is it human cellophane? I don't think that's too intimidating. He was just on this fucking guy and that dude could not get them off and he was named after it was Gunnar Nelson for half a second. I thought he was the son of the Nelsons who are the son of Ricky Nelson who went to that garden party, right. To reminisce with his old friends. Remember that I went to a garden party, reminisce with mild France. Do you like Ricky Nelson? Nia.

Speaker 5:          00:19:54       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:19:55       You like the simplicity of those old songs. The sound, the sound of thunder in the background. That's one of my gloves. Come over here and talk to me for two seconds. Let me sing you some Ricky Nelson. Maybe. Maybe this, this'll, this'll ring a bell. Hang on one second. Hold on. Hey Forsee. Where are you at?

Rain telling me what a fool I've been. Yeah. And then as something got away again, it's up to an assumpted something. Okay, Ray, please tell me. Does she love me? So why are you talking to me?

This is what's going to happen. They're going to come back. They're going to make it, what's it 20 to 60? That's going to be 20 to 20 and we're going to have to drive down the fucking field and hopefully a kick another long field golf. Jesus Christ, they all spin. Move. Good Lord. He didn't even touch him. All right, I'll talk to you guys in a minute. Well, you know, it'd be two seconds. All right? Okay.

Speaker 5:          00:23:19       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:23:20       All right. Anyway, so as I was saying, as I was saying, um, it's still Sunday night, the Patriots fucking win and it'd been 27 to six. Okay. So I overreacted. You know, what do you want from me? So what did I leave off? I left off with the human cellophane, right? I was talking about those fights. I saw, um, the fucking guy, let me, let me back pedal the hell was a gunner. Nelson couldn't get the human cellophane off of. And then there was the guy who fought the guy who comes in like a spider and he stuck his face out and got knocked out and then he kicked him in the leg and broke his leg. That fucking guy fought Jesus Christ. I don't think I've ever seen a guy get hit that many times in the head. I thought the fight, I thought the fight was over. I didn't know. I didn't realize that the referee jumped in because the round ended, but he took the, there was like a fucking watching like a rocky fight. You know when you watch a rocky fight going to do, there's no way anybody could take that many shots to the head. You'd be dead. You'd be on your ass to the fight would be over. This fucking guy took it. Um,

Speaker 1:          00:24:27       I don't know what I'm saying. I didn't ever know the names. And then the bird can guide their fucking a Conor McGregor who's fighting as Brazilian dude. He's got this crazy scar and the, he's already Brazilian Sarah. I already know. He sees a fucking nightmare. He's going to take it to the ground. You're fucked. Right. Was he not kicking people in the phase to this guy? He would. He could kick your ass. No. Oh yeah. Why don't give a shit. You're sitting in a chair or fucking running down the sidewalk. He's one of those guys. The guy can, he can't kick the shit out of it. So I've taken, wow man, this is going to be a fucking unbelievable test form. Hey Fuck. Any just ran right at him. The ball wrenched up.

Speaker 2:          00:25:05       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:25:05       And I kinda did the old right there. Fred Bam guides is a face plant he took to a judge's decisions to the face after their, whatever, their hammer fist. So what is that, what they call it? Took the old gavel to hits the gavel and that was it. It was fucking over. And um, I, like other guys said afterwards, he goes, you know, we've got to fight again. That wasn't really a fight. It's like, no. Well, it was a fight. You got knocked out, dude. You know, that usually indicates that was some sort of a fight. It's like, you, you fucking slipped. And fell and he had on a desk. There was no desk in that octagon. That was a, uh, that was his left hand. Um, but Jesus Christ, man, that was fucking amazing. I was actually talking to some of the guys I was watching the fight with. I go, how much tension is going to be in Dana White's house over Christmas? If Conor McGregor loses too after fucking what's her face? Lost female, female Tyson, right? Then you're going to have Irish Tyson. If they both go down, then who you're going to, who's going to fucking sell a fight? You need them the way they talk. Shit.

Speaker 1:          00:26:12       The how much fucking money is sitting in fucking Dana of mine that's sitting in data white sock drawer right now because you got to fucking amazing athletes like that who also not a sell a fight. You know what I mean? There's deaf other guy won 90 to get. Now you get a guy who needs a fucking interpreter for me to understand it, to sell the goddamn fight. It's over. I don't even like fucking watching movies with subtitles. I gotta I gotta fucking,

Speaker 1:          00:26:40       I got to deal with the guy that he's got to have a, you know, he's typing a fight. I look like I'm watching a senator testifying is fucking lawyer keeps coming over whisper in his ear. I don't want to see that. Right. I don't even know what I'm saying here. Um, anyway, so I forgot to tell you guys this shit. I almost forgot this fucking story. So I've been trying to work out when, uh, when I've been here, two or three days I've worked out, right? So we go to the gym the first day, it's right down the street from my apartment. There's no fucking problems. I walk in, the guy behind the counter is cool. There's nobody else there, no manager. Just some cool guy goes, hey, by the way, it's 15 bucks. But if you go on the Internet and you look this shit up, it only costs you five bucks.

Speaker 1:          00:27:18       I said, dude, I'm old. I suck at the Internet. Okay. Just generally speaking, I'm not good in that. He goes, I'm just saying, you know, it's money. And I was like, Hi man, I'll, I'll try to find the fucking page and I'll come back the next day. I'll only pay five bucks. So he goes, cool, no problems, no fucking problems. I have a great workout. I fucking troll the weights around. Classic Shit Comedian. I go to the gym in the middle of the day. It's great. There's nobody fucking there. Okay. A couple of trophy wives on treadmills, you know, fucking looking at their Instagram as they walk fucking half a mile an hour and then you come walking in and I don't give a fuck what time of day you walk into a gym. If you have to do chest that date this to all the benches are going to be taken up. You know what I mean?

Speaker 1:          00:28:00       Nobody's ever doing squats. You can walk into a gym Saturday, fucking Saturday. Like what's, what's a busy like early in the morning when people come in, wherever, 19 when it would have fucking the busiest time right after work. Six o'clock at night. Okay. You can go walk into a gym and you can just immediately just start doing squats. Nobody's ever done. Nobody does fucking legs. Everybody does the bench. So I walk into this five people, they have three benches, there's like five people working out. Three of them are guys fucking bench pressing God damn consul. I get to sit there and pretend like I'm fucking really stretching. I'm not really stretching. I'm waiting for you to finish, right? So anyways, that was the first day. So the second day I go to go back and Oh my God, here we go. You know I'm going to run into this guy again.

Speaker 1:          00:28:51       He's going to say, how can we didn't get the fucking thing that only makes you pay five bucks and be like, because I suck at the Internet. Remember I'll pay 15 I don't give a fuck. Right? And I come showing up, he's not there. There's some lady there and then this fucking manager buzzing around, hey, how long you in town for Josie? Good membership level. I said, no, do I just want to work out today? He goes, all right, fill out this form. So it's name, address, phone number, email, all of this shit. So I write down a fake name and I say I'm from Alaska and that's it, right? So he goes, no, I'm sorry, so you've got to fill out the rest of this where all the addresses now all I had to do, which just fell out of fucking fake address, but you know it's not how I'm wired.

Speaker 1:          00:29:29       I got to make a point. I go, dude, I have to give you my home address. He goes, yes, I go to a, I'm not trying to be a jerk, but I'm not going to give you my home address. Am I going to tell you where I live so I can work out one day at a gym? And he goes, well, you know you have to fill it out a little. And I go, why? Why do you need to know where I live? And he hems and haws and I just keep going. Why do you need to know where I live? Okay, it's $15 to work out. I have the $15 I'm going to give it to you and I'm going to work out at the gym. Why do you need to know where I live? So finally goes, well, sure, you know, God forbid if you have some sort of incident happens and we need to get in contact with somebody. I said, so you're telling me that God forbid to use your expression, God forbid I Keel over on the elliptical, you're going to, you're not going to dial nine one one you're going to go drive to my house and knock on the door and hope somebody there. That's what you're gonna do.

Speaker 1:          00:30:35       You're not going to do that. He's going to call nine one one like everybody else. He just keeps going, well, well, you know, what are we going to contact? It's like, what the fuck do you care who to contact? You know, eight I just said, look, if you could tell me why I need to put down my home address,

Speaker 5:          00:30:58       okay,

Speaker 1:          00:30:59       I'll write it down by the, now I'll give you a phone number of somebody to call if something happens to me, but don't call them. They're not a doctor. Call nine one one tell you what. Yeah, that's the deal. Call nine one one and here's a number. You know, if you want to let my wife know where the hell I'm going, that's it. You don't need to know where I live to. The guy finally goes, what? You have to fill it out. And I go, why? And he goes, it's protocol. And I go, exactly. You cannot logically defend why you want my home address.

Speaker 1:          00:31:31       You get in my home address. So the people in corporate will have that information. They can sell it to other people, right? So I go, I'm not working out here, right? So I would go to walk away and then the lady behind the desk, she goes, have a nice day, sir. And I'll say anything, keep walking to the bus. She goes, have a nice day, sir. And I turn around and go, I understand sarcasm. Get not telling me to have a nice day. You're telling me to go f myself. I got in the elephant. I know a lot of you guys like to, why don't you just fucking do you write a fake address? That's what I fuck. You know why? Cause at some point there's gotta be some sort of pushback. Somebody has to fucking complain about this shit. When you walk into those places and they go, do you have an id? Don't ever hand them your Id. You're holding and just say, here you go. I'll hold a wrap your fucking face. You want to read it? Go ahead and read it. She not type it and shit from my id onto my Auntie, your fucking computer. Every time you put down my name and my address yet sets, you've added another layer where I am vulnerable, Thai identity theft. And I'm not going to do that just to go work out at a fucking gym. I'm not having a kidney transplant. You con I'm going to go do some fucking pull ups.

Speaker 2:          00:32:43       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:32:43       Give you all my fucking information. I know you guys probably think I'm a psycho, right? I'm not. I'm right. I'm right on this one. I'm wrong about a lot of other shit.

Speaker 2:          00:32:51       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:32:52       Whatever. This is stupid me. Just sit here and tell you that I'm writing. I'll really build. Do you agree with yourself? That's amazing. Um, anyway, so we don't just want to say I have fucking worst goddamn stupid cab driver today. Fucking jump in this fucking thing, right? We're coming from the, uh, the premiere, right? So you don't need, it's gonna fucking high heels on it. She's not a quitter. So she's keeping those on and I'm not going to make her walk with heels on. What am I a fucking animal, right? So we get in this cab when we fucking drive down, and this son of a bitch drives right down fifth avenue, fifth avenue during Christmas where every mouse breathe and fucking moron wants to stand there and look at the Christmas tree that people skating. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:33:33       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:33:33       Okay. And he drives down. Then all of a sudden you can't make a right. This guy's acting like he's dumbfounded. He can't fucking believe it. And then he ends up cutting over through fucking times square. He did everything but try to go through the Lincoln tunnel to drive like fucking 10 blocks over. Um, and I was sitting there. Um,

Speaker 1:          00:33:52       I get aggressively exhaling the way that, the only way I could put it and my wife, she's just fell asleep. She just, that's something I could do about it. And she just took a nice nap, you know? I wish I could be more like that. Um, all right. Anyways, let me, yeah, let's start reading. Oh, you know what? I haven't done any advertising for this week.

Speaker 1:          00:38:49       Um, by the way that I mentioned how much frigging money we raise for all those people we raised like over 10 grand. All right. And I'm going to throw a nice fucking chunk of change in on top of that. You guys did a wonderful thing and uh, it amazes me, man, that I, I did this podcast this long and I didn't realize that a, you could make an impact like that. So, uh, you guys were all part of a great thing and I really appreciate how much you guys all stepped up. You were very, very generous, extremely generous. Um, you know, it's not even Christmas yet. You already did your good deeds. So now you know you didn't get spike the Eggnog, you can get hammered, you know, and treat the people and it family like shit. Right? Take them for granted. Fuck them. Right?

Speaker 1:          00:39:31       That's what they get for showing up. They knew what they were in for, how many Christmases that they got to spend with you before they realize what you're going to be doing. Um, alright, let's read some letters. Hey, this one might be a little short because it's already one in the morning and I got to be on the fucking radio at 7:00 AM oh Jesus. Oh Jesus. All Right, tool for the egg. Hey Bill, I've been running, running an egg for several years now. Your podcasts about no smoke on ribs had me captivated. I would suggest my tool to stir up the coals and bring, bring into context slash smoking hardwood chips slash chunks kind of fucking sentences that I would suggest my tool to stir up the coals and bring into contact slash smoke and hardwood chips. Slash chunks. That's a fucking cent. You know something I would suggest getting off a sentence tool.

Speaker 1:          00:40:28       How about that? They still make that hooked on phonics and way back in the day, there was a classic stand up, a reference us simply purchase a piece of three by 16 by 36 pieces steal from home depot, Home Depot place, and Ben 90 degrees, two inches from the end. Use this to unplug slash stir the coals from the inward vent on the bottom of the egg. Ah, okay. I will utilize this tool during long smoking to invigorate the smoke. This also works to bring air oxygen to the fire to increase the temperature. Simply Polk, who several of the fire, great holes at the bottom of the egg to increase the air flow. Ah, okay. Do you have any issues or just need a pick? Just ask the least I can do for your podcast. So why didn't you fucking send a picture? Now you've got to sift through a thousand fucking emails. Now, you know what I did was I layered in some charcoal, then they had the chips with the chunks of Hickory, and then I did another layer on top of that, and then I just put in one little firestarters square and I did it from the side. So it just slowly burned across and down. It was plenty for ribs,

Speaker 1:          00:41:42       but like if I was ever going to do a pork shoulder, we, you know, you talking, I don't know how long, it depends on how big it is, but it seems on average people that that's like six to 10 hours to God knows what. So that, I don't know how I would continue to do that, but I think I would just take it off and I'd lift the grate, the plates center, and I would just throw the shit in there and then put it back on. I think it would be fine. Um, that's what I would do. You know what the reality is when I just buy a fucking smoker and be done with it. All right. Traveling with girlfriend, slash. Fiance. Hey Billy board. Dane. I have to disagree with your advice from last week for the guy with the sound engineering job. He said he was a sound engineer in the letter you read out loud. Then later in your response you mentioned something about building bridges and then again on Twitter. Just a heads up dude, this guy is fucking relentless. Some of you guys, you fucking relentless like reprimanding me. All right, so I fucked this fucking thing up, so let me guess. Okay, well I think if he's planning on Spi, I like how you think that being a sound engineer, even though I fucked it up, like that's not a, that's not a quality job.

Speaker 1:          00:42:52       You know what I mean? What do you know what to, you would be working in films, right? Isn't that what that job is? Recording bands. That's a fucking great job and it's a hard, you know what? I'm going to look it up right now before I get another fucking 20 God damn tweets and emails from you. Sound engineer.

Speaker 5:          00:43:11       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:43:13       And audio engineer working with tentacle aspects of sound during the process of recording, mixing and reproduction audio engineers often with sisters, record producers and musicians to help give their work to sound they are hoping to achieve. Yeah, that's a fucking bad ass job that people want to do. All right,

Speaker 1:          00:43:30       let me get back here. So here we go. I think if he's planning on spending his life with this girl traveling and having a great time would be a make or break deal for marriage. She said she wanted to travel a year, suppose it's only seven months and they go to seven continents even go to us and we'd go to the fucking Antarctica. Okay. Over the course of a year, they get to bang in seven continents in a year, eat amazing food, see amazing things and pretty much lived their lives like it's a movie. You looked at the negative side, which is fair, but also how often did these things happen? I hate to be the guy that didn't take that chance. If it were presented, God knows I would. Of course. It all depends on their attitudes and if they're fun people with positive outlooks and good communication, food for thought, hey dude, just because I don't agree with you doesn't mean I want the negative route. I was giving him advice from my hat, which is fucking positive. I'm saying he's got a great job that he was nervous about fucking leaving. Those are his words, not mine

Speaker 1:          00:44:36       to then to end. This is another thing too, dude. You're a fucking man. Okay? If you're not making money, it's now that he can make a baby other than dump your Jizan somebody you need up. Like women can literally create life. Okay? You liked the butter and the fucking pants. I Dunno. Maybe I'm old school. I feel like the man should make a fucking living. You've got to come home and you got to make enough money that you're a woman in your family is fucking comfortable and if you're doing that, you're a fucking man. All right? If you want to go travel around the world on some woman's fucking dime and leave your career behind for a fucking year, a critical God damn year and have to start all over again. I think that's nuts.

Speaker 2:          00:45:30       Yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:45:31       I think that's fucking nuts. All right. Agree to disagree. I can tell you this dude, when I started out doing stand up, I was doing this shit every single fucking night. Every night I had a singular focus. What I was trying to do was a job that a lot of people would like to do. So it took a ridiculous level of commitment and I watched people who didn't fucking traveled the world, didn't even have that fucking option, but I watched people not work at it as hard as they could have in 20 years later. I see the results of that. So that's all I'm saying with this guy to, uh, you know, to put play before work is just not how I'm wired. You know what I mean? Um, you making it seem like this guy, if he takes the sound engineering job, will never have the money or never have the option to do, to go around and travel the world.

Speaker 1:          00:46:29       I Dunno. I just feel like as as me personally, if I was going to travel the world, it's got to be on my fucking dime, okay. In my eye and my life has to be in a place where I can leave it for a fucking year. If I'm just getting started in a career and I'm just starting to push that fucking rock up the hill and I'm going to go fucking leave and play footsie with some chick even she's going to be the chicken I'm going to fucking marry for an entire Goddamn year, then I'm going to come back and start all over again. Um, I would be going out of my fucking mind.

Speaker 1:          00:47:04       I had to be honest with the two. Uh, as much as I've traveled, there's always a point and it's usually anywhere between seven to 10 days ended the trip where I just want to go home. I want to sleep my own bed. I want to be fucking, you know, hanging out with my dog and not to mention that I love being a comedian. I want to do some shows. It's fun. So agree to disagree. Agree to disagree. All right, food for thought. Did you typed out wearing a sweater with candles on in the background? Candles on candles lit. Okay. He said and go to Cape Carp Yourself. Car Pay I don't want to do is go sees yourself like car paid diem. Okay, go carpet K. I just can't bear to have you not get the reference and hope someone writes in about it next week. Sorry. Thanks. Oh go car.

Speaker 1:          00:47:59       Pay Yourself. Oh, I thought it said go to carpet. Go carper yourself. Carpe Diem. Yeah. See I love how seize the day is. Just fuck off to your life and go travel around the world and like seize the day isn't like, you know what, I've made inroads in this really difficult line of work and I'm going to stick with this dude. I fucking, you know something. I started out with comics who did that and stayed home with their family and watch the fucking patriots game instead of going out and going and doing a hell Gig. I'm telling you, it all fucking matters. It all matters. Wait, why would I know? What the fuck do I know? You know, I did it the way I did it. I'm not, I'm I, yeah, but fucking traveling the world on somebody else's inheritance. Kind of a fucking Bama. My, I'm not fucking doing that of one of my, you know what, I'll do that if you get me a pair of fucking gold digger and pumps and I'll fucking walk that walk around in those all God damn year.

Speaker 1:          00:48:56       Well, I want to travel the world. I'm fucking pay for it. Um, I think that says something about you too. If you feel like you, you know, you don't have any problem going around the fucking world on somebody else's dime, I want to earn it. All right. Face of sponsorship. Uh, Billy Butterworth. Uh, would you ever do a major sponsorship for a big brand? What are your thoughts in the following coke, Pepsi chilies. Sizzler Wilson tennis rackets or I guess I'm doing it right now. Um, what I, I mean though, it's more with they. Um, and how long would it last? I mean, I can't even get these fucking jerk off podcast advertisers to stick with me. They're so fucking dumb. They don't realize that if I fuck around and I curse and I be a fucking idiot, you guys actually will listen to it. My philosophy is just cause I'm reading advertising doesn't mean the show stops if to show stops and he just pat you just fast forward through it. It's so fucking simple. The such idiots that don't see that about our product people and start believing it like, like you guys actually take anything that I say seriously. Um, anyways, plowing ahead here girl. Quit Job Lady. This lady quit her job and traveled the world. Um, all right, here we go. My girl quit.

Speaker 1:          00:50:17       My girl comes home.

Speaker 1:          00:50:22       Why don't you feel like there was something else in there? Did I miss one of these things? Maybe not. Right. My girl comes home early the other day and tells me she quit her job. I worked full time in a metal shop. Jesus Christ would be a blacksmith. And I go to school full time for engineering. Uh, we also have two beautiful kids. We cannot afford our houses, our houses, cars, et Cetera, without her working. And she acts like I'm a bad guy. When I say when I get on or about it. Oh Jesus. I don't know what I should do. I'm thinking of leaving her because this is not the first time she's done this. And then the total seven years we've been together, she's worked about two and a half feet, two and a half years of around 10 jobs. Wait, she has worked about two and a half years of around 10 jobs. You mean? And I'm guessing you're saying she said 10 jobs and collectively work two and a half years. Can't take the financial stress anymore. What's your advice? Um, uh, first thing I would do, I have downsize your life.

Speaker 5:          00:51:27       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:51:28       Just be like, all right, well look, if you're not going to work, then we got, we got to do something here. Um, that's incredibly selfish. And, um, look, she obviously doesn't want to work. She wants to be at home. She wants to be with the kids. So you need to make enough money to basically, you know, treat her like a third kid. Um, so your lifestyle is going to have to go down then if that's what she, I would just sit down and be like, can I shoot question? Do you want to just stay home and be with the kids, you know, and let her fucking flip out and scream and yell and all that and just don't lose your cool. Just say to her, is that what you want? Okay. Because I need to know that. Okay. So I don't keep thinking that, that we're going to be dual income and making financial decisions that way. I can already tell you right now, dude, that the fact that you're working full time and she's working full time and if the second she fucking quit, you're fucked. Do you guys are living beyond your lifestyle? Beyond your means? You shouldn't be living like that. You. So you're basically the two of you guys are spending all the money that you're making. That's, that's no way to live. All right. You need to be,

Speaker 1:          00:52:51       you need, you need to downsize your life is basically, yet I would drive a Toyota or a Honda. Those fucking things never die. I'd get one of those. I downsize. And then, you know, I mean, I don't think he just quit on our relationship and walk out on to kids, but the stress has to be fucking brutal. And if she's being a fucking baby about it, um, you know, that's, uh, you know, this is one of these fucking things, say, you know, be a nice change and one of those chicks shows, you know, a four broad sit around and fucking talking about women's stuff. They never talk about this type shit. Cause this, this would probably be considered sexist if you brought it up. That's a hell of a fucking thing for her to be doing to you.

Speaker 5:          00:53:31       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:53:33       I would just, you just gotta lay it on the line. Just sit her down and just say, listen, is this what you want to do?

Speaker 5:          00:53:40       MMM,

Speaker 1:          00:53:42       I need to know that because I'm not going through this again.

Speaker 5:          00:53:47       All right.

Speaker 1:          00:53:48       And I would just say you've had 10 jobs in the last seven years and you've worked collectively, collectively about two and a half of those seven years. Okay. When you quit a job like that, just quit a job and have no other job. It puts unbelievable stress on me and it's not fair to me.

Speaker 5:          00:54:10       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:54:11       So I need to know, do you not want to work? Do you just want to stay home with the kids? Because if you do, we're going to have to downsize our lives dramatically.

Speaker 5:          00:54:20       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:54:20       If you want to keep living like this, you need to get a job.

Speaker 5:          00:54:24       All right. And

Speaker 1:          00:54:26       if she flips out about that type of thing.

Speaker 5:          00:54:30       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:54:32       I mean that's a tough one. I guess I would be like

Speaker 5:          00:54:36       yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:54:37       once she flipped out and be like, all right, you know, something screaming, yell and get it out of your system. But you have 48 hours to sit down with me and discuss this like an adult and cut a plant.

Speaker 5:          00:54:49       Okay. Or

Speaker 1:          00:54:52       I need to make a decision.

Speaker 5:          00:54:55       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:54:55       Cause I'm not gonna, I'm not gonna live my life with this level of financial stress.

Speaker 5:          00:55:00       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:55:03       Something along those lines. Cause that's how you do what she's doing to you is unbelievably immature and fucking selfish. When you need dual income and you've got two kids at home, you just don't quit a fucking job. All right? Jesus fucking Christ. What if you did that? You know what I mean? See I'm telling you this right here. What'd that fucking guy was sitting there talking that guy saying like, oh, you should fucking leave your job and go travel around the fucking planet. This is why you don't do that. What's your doing? Serb busting your ass trying to get ahead. That's what you do when you fucking young. Okay. It makes your life a hell of a lot fucking easier and you get older. Okay. Cause the older you fucking get, you gotta be somewhere. You know what I mean?

Speaker 1:          00:55:51       Like the alley. They want to hire young people generally fucking speaking, you have to be at, at a certain place by a certain fucking age, generally speaking, or they're not going to give you a shot. Okay. It's like that old fucking thing about the fucking, what was it? What was it? Those two animals, one of them was stored away food. The other one was running around like a fucking jerk off. And then the storm finally hits in, the ants fucking eaten. And then though the turtles, uh, beat the Hare, however the fucking story goes. Um,

Speaker 5:          00:56:20       yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:56:21       I gotta tell you this, you know, I sacrificed lot to get where I'm at and I missed out on a lot of shit, but the shit that I on the back end, then I ended up getting to do okay. You know, there was a whole bunch of stuff that I missed socially, just fun stuff. So called regular shit that I missed because, and I slept on a Futon, like I've told you a zillion times till I was about 36, 37 years old.

Speaker 5:          00:56:48       All right? But

Speaker 1:          00:56:51       the outside of that was, I got to perform at Madison Square Garden. I got to fucking play drums was slash and duff and guns and roses. You know what I mean? It's fucking insane.

Speaker 5:          00:57:04       But

Speaker 1:          00:57:05       you gotta be willing to stay on the fucking Futon till you, you're pushing 40 and laying there in the loneliness of that with the fucking voices creeping in your head of doubt. And you have to beat those things down and said, telling you, did I did I make a horrible fucking mistake.

Speaker 5:          00:57:23       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:57:27       So what you're doing sir, you're working full time and you're going to school full time for engineering. Okay? If you fucking wife, no offense could just fucking ride it out for a couple of fucking years. All right? Until you get your engineering degree, you get on your fucking feet. This is what old school couples used to do.

Speaker 1:          00:57:53       Okay. They worked more as a fucking team because generally speaking, divorce was looked down upon and they always try to make it look like, and there was all these women getting beaten and they just stayed in there like every fucking woman was getting the shit slapped out of her. All right. I'm not saying there wasn't women getting fucking, you know, the shit kicked out of them. All right. But there's a lot of fucking people too, just to throw in the fucking towel because it's hard. And then you're going to get with somebody else and what? It's going to be fucking easy. It, it is hard. But this is, this is like some shit. You need the iron this out and she needs to get her fucking head screwed on straight and realize that she's got his fucking support you by keeping up her end of the bullshit while you become an engineer. And then you move up the fucking ladder. And at some point she's going to get what I think she wants, which is what? She's going to get to stay home alone.

Speaker 5:          00:58:43       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:58:45       Niggas kick. Can you come over? It just helped me finish off this podcast. I know you don't want to your shoulders blue. He just slumped.

Speaker 1:          00:58:51       I read this really quickly. I know you're tired, Nia. We're all tired. Are you going to sit there like, I'm going to scold you like a little kid now. I'm just tired. I know. It's one 15 in the morning. All right. This guy, uh, his girl comes home. He's in this, not even your wife? No. We got two kids. The girl comes home early the other day and she tells me she quit a job. I work full time in a metal shop and I'm going to engineering school, uh, going to school time for an engineering. We also have two beautiful kids. We cannot afford our houses and our cars, et Cetera, without her working. And she acts like I'm a bad guy. When I say when I get on her about it, I don't know why I should do, I'm thinking of leaving her because this is not the first time she's done this.

Speaker 1:          00:59:34       And the total seven years we've been together, she's worked about two and a half of those years and had about 10 different jobs. I can't take the financial stress anymore. What's your advice? Renee Hill? Yeah, I mean I think you should definitely talk to her about it and if you feel like she's not pulling her weight in your situation, then that's a problem. So yeah, it's stressful. If he's carrying the burden, they have like two kids and whatever. I mean, is she just lying around the house all day? I mean, is she at least, you know, taking care of the kids and make sure they have lunches and all that stuff? Or is it just all falling on him? You know? That's really, yeah, well they need the money. Yeah. All right, so I'm all right. So, okay. So if that's what their financial situation is where they both need to be working and then they both need to be working, but I don't know how leaving her is going to alleviate the financial strain, but now he's got kids, he's fucked and then she's going to bleed them dry because she'd be pissed, I think. Yeah. I don't know. But yeah, she needs to get it together. I'm sorry. Yeah. All right.

Speaker 1:          01:00:46       All right. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Jesus Christ. All right. Sorry. Why I should have known better when I asked her since shows loose slumps, you just literally who came out of the bedroom to grab something and just going back to going to sleep in like, Oh, you want to answer a fucking podcast question?
