Do you know how fucking rained out here yesterday in July? It's unbelievable. It never rains out here. It never rains in California. But boy don't they warn you it pours man. It pulls. It just, it just was this thunder and, and there was rain and it just poured down and I was like, Gee, willikers you know, I had a couple of shirts drying out on the fucking porch there because, uh, you know, you can do that out here because it never rains in February and that is it. There's a little bit of June gloom and you're like, Ooh, Ooh. Is it no precipitation, blue balls? That's all it is. And yesterday it just was an absolute downpour. And uh, like 20 minutes later it was over and everything was dried up and you would never know what happened. You know, like a perfect robbery, like a robbery gone. Right. Nobody gets it. They get in, we get up, we get the jewels. Okay. Blonde. Um,

Speaker 3:          00:01:34       yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:01:35       Franco goes in with the others have been, sorry, I just combined three different movies, two different movies, some like that. I have no fucking idea. All I know is a, this is one of these days. I forgot it was Thursday and I forgot I had to do a podcast and I have some shit.

Speaker 3:          00:01:53       Ted Do

Speaker 1:          00:01:54       some shit to do. All right. I am going down to comic con today. Can you believe that Belper hater of all marvel and DC fucking movies. I don't hate him. I just, I they do absolutely nothing for me.

Speaker 3:          00:02:16       You know,

Speaker 1:          00:02:19       I like the hulk. I'm an angry fucker. I can relate to him. Right? I've inhaled a cigar. I've turned green before. You know, I can't jump like that. A kid. I can't crush cars the way he does, but I get it. I like the hulk. I liked the way he talks to,

Speaker 3:          00:02:38       okay,

Speaker 1:          00:02:38       you know how, how fucking stupid. He basically talks like Tarzan, which really made no sense if he was raised by wolves or whatever the fuck was going on there. How the fuck he learned to how to speak English.

Speaker 3:          00:02:51       You know what I mean?

Speaker 1:          00:02:53       I can't tell if he was unbelievably compromised in that relationship with Jane or if it was a brilliant fucking thing, cause he could just pretend he didn't understand what she was saying. You know? How long into that relationship do you think before we looked at that little chimpanzee just fucking rolled his eyes like, you fucking believe this shit. Okay, this, this, this woman would be dead out here without me at an edge and all she's doing is bitch moaning and complaining. All right, we'll live in a nature. We're perfectly safe. Okay, I'm providing, we don't have to pay any taxes. There's like, no, we're in fucking eating right now. And they go, Jay, get, go, go, go. Take a bite on the apple.

Speaker 3:          00:03:37       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:03:37       You know that is one thing that I've learned as a 50 year old man. I'll tell you right now guys, if you're out with the ladies, okay. Save Your fucking money. Okay. Do not spend money on women. Okay? Do it cause you want to, but don't do it because you think it's going to make them happy.

Speaker 1:          00:04:04       It will in the moment. But I swear to God, I don't give a fuck. You could literally buy a woman to fucking space shuttle. All right? And put our initials on the side of it. Okay. And take her, I dunno where the fuck you do with the space shuttle. All right. Whatever the take her to and from work. I don't like thinning like this. My hair is like hanging down. Well, we can't take off horizontally, honey. What am I just getting to work? I swear to God you don't. You'd literally be in the Doghouse within fucking 24 hours of doing that one stupid comment.

Speaker 3:          00:04:39       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:04:40       It was actually joking with a buddy of mine the other day. I was saying like, you know, sentiment, if patching shit up with your wife was deductible, I wouldn't pay taxes for the past three years. That's all I'm ever doing. You know? I feel like the boss's son who just keeps fucking up, but for some reason he doesn't get fired. You know what I mean? It's, I have to like the 50th time you've done something wrong that we could just like, I, I really don't understand how, how did I, how did I end up in this position? Um, but that's neither here nor there.

Speaker 3:          00:05:13       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:05:14       If you want to make up with your wife, take her out for ice cream. Okay. I'm telling you it's, it's romantic. It, it gives him a sugar rush. All right. They feel like they're in some Tom Hanks movie and it really doesn't cost that much money. You know, if you can just keep your cool while you fucking stand in line at the artisan ice cream place that they want to go to before you go up there and you order a mint chocolate chip and they tell you it's not in season with that happening in San Francisco, remember that story? It's not in season. Then I'm going to cross the street to the drug store and it came back with a pint of it. You know, I should've walked into their fucking ice cream place. Hey, hey, hey, here's the deal view. If you want to get adventurous with ice cream, follow people under 40. All right, can you just want the old school simple shit. You follow old people because eventually they're going to the pharmacy, right? And that's where they have chocolate, vanilla, strawberry patch work, chocolate chip. How many flavors were there? There was mint chocolate chip, there was peppermint that was like, that was fancy back then. Not now. It's like, I don't even know what the fuck it is. They got candy bars in there. They got like a, they have sugar and salt with a shot of espresso and some sort of social justice warrior thing written in fucking a whip cream. You know, I followed Joe Rogan is most of the free world does, um, on Instagram.

Speaker 1:          00:06:54       And I saw this whole thing about the okay sign. How funny is that? According to Joe Rogan, the okay side. These people is a joke. Tried to say that you can, you can find white power in there like this, which I don't know. I see three fingers in it in a zero. I see zero to three. I see 30.

Speaker 1:          00:07:15       I see, uh, uh, I dunno know if making shadow puppets, maybe a rooster. I don't see where the white power is in it, but they tried to say that. You could see in there, I guess the p would be your forearm up into the circle and then the three fingers would be the w, Oh fuck, I'm smart. Or does that mean I'm racist, racist, racist. So when he was, they started it as a joke and then dopes believed it and then actual, even bigger dopes, white supremacists started using it and now it's actually going to get bad, you know, which is so fucking stupid. Like why would you ban that? You know what I mean? That's like banning, you know, let's say it was actually race. Would you ban somebody going Sieg Heil? Why would you ban that? Let people do it then. Then you know who the Nazis are, right? If you don't let people do it, then you're like, all right, is this guy a Nazi or does he know Jujitsu or was he just a fan of telephone? Telly Savalas oh no, wait a minute. That's all freckles. He showed up to tell some shit jokes, right? And then all of a sudden, all the lines get blurred.

Speaker 3:          00:08:30       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:08:31       Okay. You got to let corny people have this signs. You know how you doing Seth? I'm okay. You gotta let them do that and then you got to let morons, you know, fucking do this. SIEG Heil on. I hit Lou's birthday on April 20th. All right, well the hippies of behind him smoking marijuana. Hey Man, like Nazis, the mellow man, right? You got to have all those people, I think. I mean, you'd like to have not have others, but I, I really don't think I'll like banning sides. I've always thought that was, that was, uh, like I guess wishful thinking in my world. If you ban racial gestures than people aren't racist anymore.

Speaker 1:          00:09:20       You don't need to fix what's between their ears. You just need to fix just stipulations. When we come back, Dr Phil will cure a heroin addict within two commercial breaks. Uh, you ne to stop doing heroin and you need to put on some weight. You're right, Dr Phil, let me shake your hand and subtly steal your wash so I can cop right behind your fucking soundstage. Did I say cop? Yes, I did. That's how old I am. Uh, you know what's great about being a parent besides everything is all the fun fucking size. He gets stuck in your head. You know, it's, I'm talking to you guys about Neo Nazis in my head. I'm singing pop, pop, pop puppy dog past a house. But no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no bro Bro. Bro, bro, bro, bro, Bro. Up pop up pop. You know it was awesome. Is My daughter sings along to it now?

Speaker 3:          00:10:19       Yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:10:19       she just goes pop, pop, pop, pop. And then anytime they, they, she just goes dog. It's funny to parents. Um, yeah, she's amazing. Um, I, I get now why people have like eight kids. I get it. It's fucking amazing. I mean if he can just get past being tired and them eventually hating you between the ages of about 11 and a, I don't know, depending on how much you actually did do wrong, it might be the rest of your life, but usually it, I think it lasts to somewhere. A mid college

Speaker 1:          00:10:59       I would think. I don't know. I've already thought about how I'm going to handle their teenage years. I'm just going to listen. I know, I know. I'm cramping your style man, but can you just go to lunch with your old man? I swear to God. Here's the deal. I like, I'll let you walk in first. You know, just in case some of your friends are in there. All right. And then if none of your friends are in there, then I'll come in like the fucking elephant man. And he will sit down just to have lunch with me. And if any of friends show up, you know?

Speaker 3:          00:11:32       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:11:34       I mean, I don't know what to do at that point. I guess I would walk out, you know, how amazing is that? Like, as this little perfect big that needs you on such a ridiculous level, it almost makes you cry within like 10 years. He like treats you like the fucking plague, you know? I'm kind of excited for it, for the whole fucking journey because at the end of the day, I am a loner, so I think I'll be able to sub. No, I won't.

Speaker 3:          00:12:02       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:12:02       What'd your own flesh and blood stone say? Black on you. Um, all right. I think we need to do some advertising here. Don't I? At some point, not all of them. Only 12 minutes in nearly 12 minutes. And you know what I did? I tell you guys that I watched the a moto GP from Germany. I uh, I'm from Germany and I saw a fucking Mark Marquez fucking run down Jorge low Lorenzo. The, I just don't understand the whole fucking tire thing. These fucking guys, whenever they use the soft tire, they're always leading in the beginning and then eventually the soft tires to fucking soft, it starts to wear down and then they're fucked. You know? I mean at this point, the way Mark Marquez is winning, why don't you just go, well, what is mark going to use today? The give ourselves a fighting chance because as far as I know, Jorge, Luis, Lorenzo, he fucking uh, he won a championship three years ago. Right? Mark has his one for the last five. Let me look this up. Moto g p Jambi almost. Am I on the right Internet? Okay, here we go.

Speaker 3:          00:13:17       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:13:17       Oh God. They just let me know who. Okay. How about Valentino Rossi? Huh? Always making the podium. That's a weird thing in racing that I don't get how you get too old to do it. I mean, as long as you are fucking, especially race car driver, as long as you have foot works, can you press down on the gas? I mean the engine has to go 200 miles an hour. You don't, right. I mean it just kind of ride along. All right. But I guess your reflexes, your reflexes get, uh, aren't as good. And then, um, I dunno. You just stop winning. It's crazy. All right. So basically,

Speaker 3:          00:13:55       okay,

Speaker 1:          00:13:56       first of all, shout out to Spain because since 2010 a Spaniard as one at every year except 2011 when arguably the greatest motorcycle name of all time. Casey stoner. One more time. Casey stoner, one in 2011. All right, Mark Marquez won it in 2017 2016 Jorge Lorenzo won it in 2015 and then 2014 2013 was Mark Marquez, Jorge Lorenzo was 2012 Casey stoner, please report to the principal's office. 2011 and 2010 was Jorge Lorenzo. And then the previous decade was the Valentino Rossi show where that genius won it seven times in nine years. Honorable Mention to Casey and 2007 and also the last American, the last Yank to win at 2006. Nikki. Hey, what's going on? Do you still riding the fucking motorcycles kit Doty was crazy. He was doing fucking wheelies in the seventh grade. And we also want in 2000 with Kenny Roberts Jr um, Valentino Rossi won in 2001, 2002, 2003 2004 2005, 2008 and 2009 and he was riding Hondas in the beginning, 2001, two and three. And then the unthinkable, he switched to Yamaha and everybody thought it was an inferior product. And not only did he fucking went with them, he won four times with Yamaha. Yamaha. There you go. There's some quick motorcycle history. I don't know shit about it, but somebody who watches this shit, please explain to me why you would ever run a race. Right? Or race on the fucking soft tire. The super soft. So whatever. They always seem to blister or just they shit the bed,

Speaker 1:          00:15:54       right when it counts. It's like you lead the whole fucking race,

Speaker 3:          00:15:57       you know,

Speaker 1:          00:15:58       and then all of a sudden with like 15 to 12 laps left, all of a sudden somebody with a medium tire or something like that just runs you down.

Speaker 3:          00:16:06       You know,

Speaker 1:          00:16:10       the soft tire is sort of the, uh, the heartthrob of the tire industry. You know what I mean? Well, if you're basing your whole life on your looks, I mean you're, you're, you know, you're going to have, your career's going to be pro probably shorter than a professional athletes cause you're going to get old and somebody else younger, it's going to come along. But the medium,

Speaker 1:          00:16:32       I think the medium tires, the way to go, it seems to be the wake up way to go. I have no fucking idea, but all I know is a, I have to figure out a way next year in April to get to that Goddamn Moto GP race. But anyways, I didn't mention why are you going to comic con bill? Why are you going to Indianapolis Bill? I'm going down the first time I'm flying a helicopter down. Uh, it's the first time I've flown since May tope I remember how to do this shit. I'm flying with an instructor. Everybody relax. So I'm flying down there and I am, uh, is it moderating hosting? Um, I'm sitting down for an hour in front of a crowd of 6,000 people.

Speaker 3:          00:17:13       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:17:14       And I am hosting, uh, what do you call it? The, uh, the cast of better call Saul. I'm getting to interview all of those people and I'm going to see Vince Gilligan for the first time in a long time, which can be great. I'm going to thank him for giving me an acting career and, uh, and then afterwards, uh, some of the cast of breaking bad's going to come out and then we're going to do an hour with them. And um,

Speaker 3:          00:17:43       yeah, I dunno.

Speaker 1:          00:17:46       I don't know why I, this is one of these gigs where I was like, yeah, I'd to do that. And then the second I, you know, the day comes and I'm like, wait, what am I on my fucking, what the fuck am I going to say? But I know that everybody's got great stories, so all I gotta do is just, I just got to set people up. I did this recently on another show that escapes me. I have no fucking idea what I am. I short term memories for Shit. I have no idea. But anyways, it's going to fly down to San Diego. I'm going to a host, both those things and I get to watch the premiere of better call Saul. You know what's better than that? Then I come back, you know better call Saul, one of my favorite actors on television right now. Joe To Rosa Smoking Joe to Rosa. Oh by the way, by the way, you know.

Speaker 3:          00:18:38       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:18:39       Very strong rumors, very strong rumors that Belper and Joe Rosa a back together in talks about getting uninformed going again, very strong rumors. Remember when guns and roses was getting back together and everybody isn't going to happen. Is it going to happen? You know what? Guess what?

Speaker 3:          00:19:02       Yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:19:03       I'm sitting down with old fucking Joe to Rosa next week to see if I can figure out a way to get to, to fit myself into is incredible busy schedule as an actor yet to be nominated for an Emmy. But we all know it's inevitable. I sound like a break in his balls, but I think he's fucking great on that show. And uh, I can't wait for this season. And, um, it is a beyond an honor that Vince asked me to do this. So I just hope I don't fuck it up to be honest with you. You don't. Um,

Speaker 4:          00:19:42       and I also don't know how, how do I get into this? I mean, can I, can I talk about like how last season ended without getting stampeded by 6,000 nerds? Go and see. Spoiler alert man. All right, everybody. Okay, here we go. I got a little bit of a,

Speaker 4:          00:26:44       Well, is this copy here? I never had. I've never had glasses. Must say brutal and bill burr voice at least twice per spot can be out of context. Must not get mad at Hubble for trying to be cute. Uh, okay. With Hubble, you'll get a fresh pair of lenses for every single day for s for less. What? Fresh pair of lenses. 60 contexts for $33. Do the math. That's barely a dollar a day. How often do you throw out contact lenses?

Speaker 1:          00:27:15       I've never been in this world.

Speaker 4:          00:27:18       Uh, this is more affordable than other brands. Go to Hubba contacts.com and get your first two weeks for free. They can send you to an optometrist if you don't have a prescription featured in vogue, Gq, tech crunch, Mashable, and the billboard podcasts. So do what I bill burr, definitely 100% did. And go to a Hubble context.com to get your first two pairs. First two weeks of lenses for free. Uh, that's 15 pairs of lenses for free. I've never done this. Uh, to summarize context. Cheaper's good, easy, humble Internet C, uh, make sure to select my show. Underscore Bill Burr, underscore at checkout. That's Hubble Hubb, Ellie contacts.com. All right, so I guess they have cheek contexts.

Speaker 1:          00:28:07       All right. Yet you can put it in your eyes. Uh, I actually, I need glasses, man. I do. And uh, I'm just afraid that if I wear glasses, it's going to make my eyes weaker. It's kind of like, you know, given into using a cane, except it's for your eyes. I'm trying to tough it out. I'm 50 years old and I still don't have glasses. You know, I'll tell you

Speaker 4:          00:28:29       I can't see shit, but I'm a good listener. I'm all man. I'm a really good listener. All right. I gotta get in there and I got to go eat lunch.

Speaker 1:          00:28:36       Oh, sorry. Breakfast with the, with the family. Um, I almost just said I love you guys. I don't even know why. Why would I say that? This being a dad thing is really making me soft. It's really, it's kind of scaring me here. All right, let's get back on track. Have a great weekend. You con and uh, I'll check in on you on, uh, on Monday. I think. Is there an f one race this weekend? There wasn't one this past weekend. I think that coming back. Ah, I can't wait. That last race was my favorite fucking race. That I'd last two have been my favorite race. And, um, I'm going to go out on a limb and I'm going to say a, a ridiculously focused, slightly angry Lewis Hamilton. He's going to put on a fucking display. That's what I'm, that's, that's my guests. Alright, you wanna see something cool? Checkout Lewis Hamilton's private jet. Ahh, Ahh, I can't imagine that. You know what I mean? Just flying to every gig in that fucking thing. Do you now not funny. Would be.

Speaker 3:          00:29:42       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:29:42       How would you show up with that grin on your face that you know, like when those, when when the the dive and rescue teams find the fucking guy who drowned in the, in the fucking those cave divers, they would have that goofy smile on their face because the last thing that happens is your body releases all that dopamine. That's the look I would have on my face if I had a private jet. You know, by the way, there is no way to fly private and make money. There's just no way to fucking do it unless you flew there and then did it 10,000 gigs in a row before you flew back. I don't get how people fucking do it and people go, Oh, you build it into the contract. It's like fuck it. It's going to come out of your end. It's going to come out of your rent. I mean, I think if I was to fly from here to Utah, it costs like 50 grant. It's fucking ridiculous. That 50 it's fucking nuts. All right. That's the podcast. Enjoy the music and listen to and enjoy another half hour of a Thursday afternoon podcast for my Thursday afternoon. God, by all look good. Just came walking in all shirtless with their beer belly. How you doing buddy? Is it me or does she just keep getting better looking?

Speaker 3:          00:30:51       She does get better looking. Can you say hi?

Speaker 1:          00:30:55       Can you say Mama, can you say okay? Can you say baby?

Speaker 3:          00:31:02       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:31:03       Can you say dog? You say Kat. Can you say car? Can you say, wow? He's saying, Whoa, whoa. She slipped in both around.

Speaker 3:          00:31:17       Can you say keys? Key shoes. He

Speaker 1:          00:31:21       now she can almost say to civil war. Can you say wallet? The water. The water. That's like the same thing. Yeah. You got to pick like words that begin with the letter that she knows. I'm not trying to turn him into a gold digger.

Speaker 3:          00:31:39       Okay. Say Baby

Speaker 1:          00:31:47       baby laughing.

Speaker 5:          00:31:52       Crying, crying. Are you doing that? Huh?

Speaker 1:          00:31:57       Angry sleeping. All right. That's the podcast. God bless Ya. Uh, I'll talk to you on my, yeah, that's right. Check it out. I'll see you on Monday.

Speaker 6:          00:32:19       From the first book, we get bashed into the holder, not the half of the book. Captain Aftermath of the project. That's the way I have a NASA, but the one at the top came after this shot. I'm like, God, Brooklyn. See that all Kimberly, that they send the true gas where the police would tell them what at New York City when they paint murals and the and cash we trust because it's getting a fabulous life. Look Pretty. What a pity blunts is. Still 50 cents. 3 cents is Tom and nick can't be covered within says my presence felt. My name is Callie from the eternal refreshing. We'll take shorthand from this conception. Let me meditate. Satish tray came to that conclusion that most of these chapters let me demonstrate. Walk in the streets. It's like battling be with your body. You must know karate it back to me like a bitch or ready to be efficient. Every year may be, you can see your name in the column where we certainly teach a reading and talking about a new either mountain tonight and neighbors like he went to cry. It's like, who'd a thought, David? Hey, what's going on? Go for Monday morning,

Speaker 4:          00:33:32       the July fucking 19th 2000 fucking 10 all right, I'm going to pissed off fucking mood because I'm not funny this week. This is the third fucking time I've started this Goddamn podcast. They had a race. Two of them got 12 minutes into the first one and I just said, fuck it. And I erased it and this one, I got 24 fucking minutes in and I, I just, I, I just erased it. And rather than walking away and walking down the Goddamn street and cleared my fucking head, I just hit stop and I hit a race and then I just start the fucking thing again thinking like, oh, maybe, maybe this will work. Let me do a do over, you know?

Speaker 3:          00:34:15       Okay.

Speaker 4:          00:34:15       Oh, actually, you know what it is. I'm on the fucking road. I went to Montreal and now I'm in New York and I just, I want to go home. I've had it. I don't want to sleep in anymore of these fucking hotel rooms. I don't want to order any more fucking room service. I'm in New York. Are you ordered a God damn fucking protein salad with a fucking Capri Tse Salad? Cause I thought they were Mozzarella, Mozzarella sticks. However the fuck you got. Goddamn sons of bitches from Italy say it fucking shows up. So I ordered a salad and a fucking sal. Do you know what it cost me? It cost me fucking almost 50 bucks with the tip because I'm staying in midtown midtown. Therefore we can, we can rape you. You want some fucking advice. If you ever come to New York, do not stay mid tab too. God goddamn fucking. They deliver the fucking food. The guy's wearing a goddamn ski mask. Fucking pantyhose over his fucking face. Sound believe. And then we send up there the only set up some fucking, you know guy who can't even speak fucking English, right? So you know, it's not his fault. You know, he didn't come up with the Goddamn menu. Poor bastard. He's still has scurvy from floating over on his goddamn luggage coming up here at fucking dazed given me the God damn s I can't fucking believe it.

Speaker 3:          00:35:35       Yeah.

Speaker 4:          00:35:35       You know, and if you've never stayed in a fucking New York hotel room either, this is how it works. It costs $400 for the night and you're like, wow, this is going to be amazing though. Right? And you open the fucking door and what happens? You take a step and a half, you trip over the fucking bed, you'll roll over the bed like that. Dushant Starsky and Hutch Hutch going right over the hood of his fucking Grand Torino. And rather than coming up in a cool way with your Adidas dragons on, you do a face plant right into the fucking wall. And if I have the second, you're like, oh, wait a minute, wait a minute. There's a ray of light. I actually have two side by side windows. Let's check out the view. And all you see is a fucking the brick building next to you. Do you know? I can't even commit suicide out of this fucking window. That's how close the building is next to me. Hang on a second. Yes.

Speaker 5:          00:36:25       Okay.

Speaker 4:          00:36:25       It's okay. Uh, come back later. I'm doing the podcast. All right. Thank you. And I call, I assumed that she's a fan, actually got a laugh out of her. Um, but she had an accident. I just said I'm doing the podcast. She probably thinks that's some sort of new dance or that I'm fucking my wife and it's some sort of new weird position. I'd love to open the door, but we're doing the podcast. Um, anyways, let's get back to killing myself. Um, if I were to jump out this building and trying to kill him, I wouldn't kill myself. What, what actually happened was I would slide down between both buildings excrutiatingly slow scraping the, the fucking skin off of both ass cheeks, the back of my head, my nose, and the helmet of my Dick and the top of my feet. I would have my feet pointed down like Greg Louganis, you know, coming out of a fucking triple Lindy gone right into the Olympic Pool.

Speaker 4:          00:37:22       How does he do it? How does he not fucking create a God damn splash? You're like, that doesn't get enough credit. That fucking Greg Louganis, you know all he talk about his, how he whacked his head and he had his fucking, you know, he was HIV positive and it got on the diving board for the next Ukrainian dude who came up there. You know what about the fact that he could basically jump off the Eiffel Tower and somehow against the laws of physics not have not have a splash. I would put that guy up there with the fucking Wayne Gretzky's, the Michael Jordans. Okay. You know what? I don't know enough about diving. So I got a strike that, but I, I did see some shit this weeks with someone was saying Koby Bryant had five fucking rings. So if he gets one next year, he gets number six, then you have to say that he's on par with Jordan as far as championships.

Speaker 4:          00:38:17       Yes, we can all do math. But as far as him ever eclipsing Michael Jordan, he never will. And I'm gonna, I'm gonna tell you this right now. Not only will he never eclipse Michael Jordan, he's not even fucking close and know what all you Laker fans are thinking, but wait a minute, fucker. He's doing the same fucking moves. Yes he is. Yes he is. Physically, he can do what Michael Jordan can do. Yes, he can. All right, but this is the difference. Michael Jordan created those fucking moves. All right? You can find a guitarist in your fucking neighborhood who can play Voodoo child. Does that mean they're as good as Jimi Hendrix who wrote the fucking Song, who is 20 years ahead of his fucking any other guitarist on the planet? Look, as great as Stevie Ray Vaughan is, I love that guy to death. He can't touch, he can't fucking touch Jimi Hendrix. He can't. Hendrix came up with that Shit and then fucking Stevie ray modernized it, but it was Jimmy Shit. You know what I mean?

Speaker 4:          00:39:32       It's like a pilot take you learns how to fly and then tries to compare himself to Orville and Wilbur Wright. Oh, they, they've, they fucking flew only across the field and flying across the whole country. I'm 3000 miles better than the people who invented flying. All right. Now Colby, Bryan has the, the I think has the athletic gifts of Michael Jordan. And if you had the two of them play each other one on one at the height of their powers, it would be the greatest one on one game ever. All right. But as far as the forward thinking, the, the, the athletic genius. Coby Brian has not an inventor. He isn't, he does have the drive. He's got all that other shit, but he doesn't have the ability to take the game 20 years into the future where he has no fucking pier. There was no arguments when Jordan played, there was no arguments about who the best guy in the league was for the last 10 years of his career.

Speaker 4:          00:40:37       There was a, you know, early on before he established himself, you know, people, you know, we're throwing other names in there. But after you know, fucking 89 there was no question who the best player was. And by fucking 92 93 he was without a doubt the greatest basketball player of all time. And he still is Koby Bryant on the other hand, his entire career, there's always been, well what about this guy? What about that guy you know right now is Colby, Lebron James? You know, I still give it to Colby. Colby is still uh, beyond Lebron James, but Lebron James is very close. There was no one near Jordan. I can't even explain it to you. It's like when you talk to those fucking Douche bags from the baby boom generation, those selfish Kuntz who hang their hat on, they stopped the Vietnam War and then became corporate douche bags.

Speaker 4:          00:41:35       Um, that's a big generalization for you. Like they always say like, no matter how much you get into the Beatles, you just can't wrap your head around what it was like when they put out an album, how far ahead they were from everybody else. It's the same thing with Richard Pryor because what happens is as the years go by, everybody rips those, those geniuses off and everybody gets caught up to where the fuck they were. And what usually happens is if you're young, you're watching the contemporary people and then as you go back in time you go back 30 years, you go all the way back to prior and you see him do the black guy, white guy thing and so many people have ripped him off that that the genius of what he does is, is a little tainted. You know what I mean? So that's like when people look at Colby and that and they go back and they look at Jordan, they take for granted what Kobe's doing now because it just seems it just like that's what basketball is now because Jordan showed, showed them what was possible.

Speaker 4:          00:42:42       You understand what the fuck I'm saying here. I'm sure Laker fans won't fucking, they, they'll, they'll argue it but they're fucking morons anyways. They're going to be like Jordan is just as good as Jordan. You know the same way. They try to claim that they have fucking 16 championships or this other do. She wrote me this week who tried to say they have 18 this such, there's just no way to respect a Laker fan. I just cause some, they're just transplanted. Fucking does. There's so few people from Los Angeles. And what happens is people move out there, you know, Hollywood fucking phoneys and then the Lakers, you know, they always have some fucking amazing team. There are a hell of, they're an awesome franchise. I think they've uh, wait how many championships they got since 1980 he won five. Eight. They won nine. They're better than the Yankees since 1980. Better than the Canadians. They had the franchise. All right. This will all these fucking assholes go out there and they see Jack Nicholas at a fucking true fan. Jack Nicholson. What the fuck is wrong with me every time I want to say Jack Nicholas, I say Nicholson and vice a versa there.

Speaker 4:          00:44:00       God help me if they're ever in the same fucking room, really built when the fuck would that happen. Huh? When you do some corporate gig for some people who actually did something with their life and you go in there like a dancing monkey and then afterwards try to talk to them in the green room. Is there clearly blowing you off? Um, anyways, the fuck am I talking about here? Yeah. All those Douche bag Laker fans. You know, I talked to one the other day like, well dude, I'm die hard. I'm die hard. And I found out he was from New York. How the fuck do you go from being a Knicks fan to being a Lakers fan? I'll tell you why. You become a fucking phony. How do you leave New York and moved to la? How do you do that? You know, unless you're in show business.

Speaker 4:          00:44:43       Which was he? I think he was, I can't remember. I drank so much just fucking week. I'll of everybody's just amalgam. Everybody's just a big, just amalgamating, if that's even a word, into just one big face running their goddamn miles. My own fucking lawyer is a Laker Fan. Okay. And we had that argument about the 16 championships and he just would not answer my questions. I got a real thrill out of it of being a lawyer in a fucking argument because I just kept hitting him with that argument. You know? I go, you go to the staples center. All right. Now, you know, first of all, if you, if you got to make a 16 championship tee shirt, because the law, the Laker, the Laker franchise has 16 championships. That is undebatable. Okay? But the Los Angeles Lakers have 11 the Minneapolis Lakers have five. So when you make those 16 championship fucking tee shirts, you got to say Minneapolis slash Los Angeles.

Speaker 4:          00:45:49       Okay? Take the hint from the Laker franchise. When you go to the staples center and they don't have the Minneapolis banners up there because those banners belonged to the franchise slash the fans of fucking Minnesota in Minneapolis the same way. And I've made this fucking goddamn example a zillion times and I'm going to keep making it because every fucking week, some Goddamn Laker Fan, this is the last week I'm going to do it because now people have sent me those emails on purpose. But like if the Lakers now moved from Los Angeles to Las Vegas, they win it next year for the franchise is 17th Championship people in Los Angeles. What would you do with somebody from Vegas came walking up to you when? What that 17 bitch, we have 17 fucking NBA championships. We are the New York Yankees of fucking basketball. Would that, would that make sense to you if you saw Las Vegas Lakers? 17 championships and they will walk it around, thrust in their chests out the Boston Celtics have won 17 championships all in Boston.

Speaker 4:          00:46:56       Okay, that's it. And a few people in La, you're still confused. Like I've said before, just think how count, how many times you've thrown a rock through the wind storefront window of an athlete's foot foot. I can't even fucking talk this week. How many times do you burned down your city? How many times you've burned down the La area? That's how many championships you have. All right? So stop padding you fucking resume. Like all you can do out there. You're a god Damn Pa and by the time you type up your resume, you fucking directed the movie fucking phoneys who can't even show up to the game on time. Um, all right, well we go on. Hey, where the fuck did we go from here? All right, so how much time did that take up? How much momentum. All right. That was a good 14 fucking minutes.

Speaker 4:          00:47:46       Let me shut off this overhead light made out of fucking piece of shit. Plastic, 400 bucks a night, fucking pricks. Um, anyways, I am here in New York and, uh, I did the Montreal comedy festival this week. Uh, that was a big thrill, you know, that's why I drank so fucking much this week and I just ran into a bunch of comedians I haven't seen in a long, long fucking time. Um, you know, because everybody I know fucking headlines now, so we never get to work together anymore. So just we're drinking and telling stories and just laughing our fucking asses off and I'll tell you, it's a goddamn shame nobody filmed it. Cause there's like nine zillion documentaries out there trying to capture the backstage stand up fucking thing. And uh, I don't think they've ever done it. And the only way you could ever do it is if you'd have to do it like a reality show.

Speaker 4:          00:48:46       Will You keep the cameras rolling 24, seven. And that way people gradually forget about them because that's what they have to do. They have to forget that they're on camera. So you actually hear the fucking stories and the, uh, I don't know if the level you have to go to, to make another comedian laugh. Um, this put it this way, this podcast is PG 13 compared to the shit that we talk about. So anyways, that's what I was doing. I was drinking booze. I was having a great time up there. Um, and I'm fucking wiped out. But um, I'm actually taping this right now on the 18th, Sunday the 18th, and I'm doing the David Letterman program, the late show tomorrow night. I got my suit, I got to get my shoes polished. I got my fucking cufflinks, you know, nice fucking shirt. And as always, I know people are going to send me emails.

Speaker 4:          00:49:42       Dude, why did you wear is? Why did you dress up for the greatest fucking, you know, talk show out there, Bill, I don't understand it. Everybody else on the show is dress really nicely. Why did you go on the show and dress really nicely? Why didn't you go out there and dress like you were headlining the funny bone in fucking Dayton, Ohio? Why did you dress like you were in the Ed Sullivan Theater? Do you guys realize you young punks that that's the fucking same stage where the Beatles came out and broke in the United States. And if you'll watch him, they were wearing suits. Your dumb fucks really don't understand that you show up to a Toga party. If you wear a suit, you can give somebody then when in Rome cunts, when in Rome. Um, so anyways, this is going to be my fifth appearance and uh, I'm really excited.

Speaker 4:          00:50:36       I got a nice tight set. Um, I am kind of making fun of mothers right out of the gates. So, uh, as always, you know, there's always a bit of awkwardness before people realize that I look like a puppet and then I'm harmless and then I just write it, write it right through. And uh, and then what's going to happen is after the show, I'm going to have the fucking euphoria that I did it and I survived it. And, uh, then I'm going to go out and I'm gonna stay out too late and then my alarm clock's going to go off 20 minutes later and I'm going to be in the worst fucking move ever. I better have a window seat. That's all I can tell you because if I get woken up, if I get the aisle seat, you know, I hate how people wake you up on a plane.

Speaker 4:          00:51:25       When a stranger wakes you up. Is there anything more creepier than the touch of a stranger trying to not disturb you from your sleep? That little two fingered, not quite a poke, not quite a caress that they do into your shoulder and then they speak in half sentences. They don't just, they don't just, you know, you know, you know, it'd be acceptable like a man demand, like a, a back of the hand fucking on, on the side of your leg as intimate as that sound. I'll give you the sound just like this. Hey Man, I gotta get up. Use the bathroom. I, so just like that, but for some reason, because she just, I don't know if it's because of nine 11. I don't know what, but people just, they the two finger and then they, and then they sort of whisper a half a sentence.

Speaker 4:          00:52:14       They fuck you just feel this creepy fucking pedophile touch. It startles you. The exact thing they don't want to do. It's such a creepy touch. It does startle you. You fucking whip your head around over to them and then it's some, another man whispering I half a sentence. Yeah. I just had to, yeah, I, I just wanted to get, can I just, can you just what you fucking asshole finished the God damn sentence and stop fucking finger raping me. Whatever the hell you just did there. That's the old shoulder finger rape at 30,000 feet. Um, which is actually a new phrase, acceptable in the Webster's dictionary. Can you believe that? How many times I'm so sick of them fucking bringing that up on talk shows. Do you know that chillin is now an acceptable word in the dictionary? Well, do you know that everybody's using it?

Speaker 4:          00:53:08       You fucking idiot. That's how they become words. You can have words that everybody is using and you're not going to put them in the dictionary. Why are people so fucking stuck up about that? Ooh, good Chilean Knute mood and be like, does any class left you fucking doing Vegas? People showing up and Hawaiian shorts with flip flops and you can't put shelling in the God damn dictionary. You know, keep stopping these fucking plagues people. And that's what you're going to have. You're going to have a weaker species of fucking human beings. All right? And they're going to use fucking slang words and eventually you're going to have to stick them in the dictionary because you're gonna want to commute. Be able to communicate to the people. You always have to be able to communicate to the people. Because if you can't communicate to them, then you can't give them the fucking lie. You can't spend your own fucking story of why we're all scampering around down here as you sit in your fucking manner.

Speaker 4:          00:54:11       You know, I've been dying to do a bit about the kind of people I think should have get the death penalty and one of them is these fucking bankers. I really believe, man, if you shake up the economy like a goddamn ant farm and you make fucking old people have to eat al Po for the last 18 years of their fucking life, and I might just talking about five or six of them. I'm talking about an, you know, a large percentage of an entire generation. These fucking banker cunts fucked over people. Basically the generation that won World War II, it's unbelievable that even go to jail. They don't even fucking go to jail.

Speaker 4:          00:54:54       I Dunno. I think they should give all old people fucking, they should just give them those paintball guns and then they should just tell him where the, where the fucking rich people live, the bankers and they should just go on and just see every once in a while drive by and shoot them and they never get arrested. That's what I think that they should do. All right. Once again, just like the last two podcasts. This thing's starting to Peter out right around 21 minutes. 52 seconds. Can I be funny up until 22 seconds, I got another four seconds to do it. Three seconds. That's not going to happen. Jesus. This is the longest 15 minutes ever. Fucking God damn judges popped out too. I tell you guys that they said that I grinded my teeth at night. Like I didn't know that. I didn't know that I was an absolute psycho and had angry dreams about murdering people.

Speaker 4:          00:55:43       So they give me this fucking mouth guard and I put the mouth guard on and now my jaw just dislocates every once in a while and I so don't like paperwork and shit that I would never even consider sowing them. Oh my God, this sucks and I've just figured out how to pop it back in again. All right, now it's out of alignment. Let me see if, let me try to bite down. Yeah. What the fuck? I feel like I had a ball side of my fucking jaw. Any dentists out there can tell me why that happened? I can't even, you know, you know why the first time it happened, I can't leave. I'm going to tell you this. I can't tell you how the time I dislocated my jaw was, uh,

Speaker 3:          00:56:31       okay.

Speaker 4:          00:56:34       How do I tell it in a clean way? I don't do sex jokes, but, uh, I was going down on a girl then I was trying to fucking jam my tongue in there and I think it, it pushed my lower back. She was getting really into it, you know, and I was younger, so I didn't know how to make them come. And she was getting close and I was so fucking exhausted. I just went forward. I was in the red zone and I was like, we got a score here. This fucking game is over. And then when, uh, you know, I came up out of the fucking, what the fuck do you call it? I don't know. The concubines. I know some word with a see that began there and I wasn't going to say can't I came up out of there, uh, you know what that laminated face and a, yeah, I noticed it was difficult to bite down and ever since then I had a problem. I think it just ruined my lawsuit cause if they'll listen to the podcast and actually he admits on the podcast on July 18th, 2010. Yeah. Then it was actually jamming his tongue until Vagina in Laughlin, Nevada.

Speaker 4:          00:57:45       There's no way to make that up. It's fucking true. Ah, Jesus Christ isn't aging. Isn't it just funny how things like that happen. Anyways, Jesus Christ. What a fucker thing to admit. You can tell him flailing when I started the fucking admit and that shit. 24 minutes. Here we go. Okay, let's plow ahead. I was watching ESPN today and um, and of course, you know, as always, you had four really intelligent people on a panel who are all involved in a debate that none of them knew was even remotely true, but they engaged in it anyways because it would piss off a guy like me and make me continue to watch so that I then see the commercials so they can justify their advertising so that those four cock suckers can get paid. I refuse to believe that Bob Ryan, John Saunders, though they're not dumb guys. They're not.

Speaker 4:          00:58:42       But if you listen to what they're arguing, it's the stupidest shit ever. Basically because a tiger woods hasn't won a major this year. They're questioning whether he's ever basically going to be able to put it back together again. Completely ignoring the fact that he got busted for cheating almost 30 times on his wife in front of the entire country, and that he's going through a divorce right now that you know, she wants $700 million and he's wants to give her 300 million. They're in the process of negotiating that. And also he's got, he's going through a period in his life where he realized that he fucked up his whole marriage. You know, if you guys, you know, not forget, if you haven't fucked up relationship, you haven't gone through relationship that ends and you got to go through your fucking town and everywhere you go you got a memory of that person.

Speaker 4:          00:59:38       You sit in there welling up in a Johnny rockets. Would you like to get some French fries? See a thing. She loved French fries. We used to share him, um, all that shit. So he, you don't think he's going through that on a worldwide basis, traveled the world with that woman and just be, you know, when you fuck up to that level, you always want to go back. You know, you have to go through the regret before you can move on. So I'm sure he's sitting there at the British open. As much as he's trying to block it out as much as he's a competitor, there's no way as a human being few not to be sitting here going, man, this time last year my life was so different. Even though I didn't win it last year when I came up on 18, but she didn't play last year because his knee was hurt for whatever the last time he played it, you know, um, or maybe did, I don't fucking know. He was coming up 18 and his wife was sitting there with their kid and he got the hug and on the kiss and all that type of shit and it's not there. And he has to deal with that. And this is a fucking guy that, you know, he's a human being is such idiots. The guy won a fucking tournament when his knee was blown out and he was screaming in pain after every God damn shot. And he's still fucking one. And they're going to question this guy with a reconstructed knee.

Speaker 4:          01:00:58       You know, the guys in his early thirties, they've already written them off. Jack Nicholas won his final fucking, uh, master's at like 45, 46 years of age. It's this, it's, the whole debate was so fucking beneath guys like Bob Ryan, John Saunders, who was that? Who the guy was. It was if you just sit there going, you guys don't even believe this shit. You just trying to cause controversy because you have to fill up 24 fucking hours. And that right there is why I don't watch those shows, you know, but you know, unless I'm on the fucking road and I've got nothing else to do and then it completely fucking pisses me off.

Speaker 4:          01:01:38       Anyways, let's plow ahead here. Um, here's a question I got this week, um, from a listener. Um, Bill, I have a question. I had been dating a Filipina girl who is too short to be seen with in public. Geez. I mean, what, what a, what a way to start the story. I'm seeing a girl who I can't be seen with in public. Okay. This relationship has legs. Um, and the fact that I'm six foot three doesn't help at all. I mean, she is really small for foot five. This is one of the great sentences I've ever read. Listen to this. Technically she's a midget. So you would think people would kind of leave us alone out of respect for her shortness.

Speaker 4:          01:02:32       Sir. Do you realize that really short people or little people want to be called little people? They midget is offensive. I learned that. I didn't think it was, I actually have that on my CD going. It was never a racial slur. You know, midgets weren't dragged here from another country and forced to do labor. You're a midget. What's wrong with that? And evidently a PT Barnum came up with it or something just to let you know, cause I didn't know midget was offensive either. Right. I knew it was offensive, but I didn't understand why a midge is like the name for a really tiny bug I guess. So that's what they were saying. They say when you like, you were like as small as a little boy. They were comparing it to a little fucking insect, you know? And that goes, the elephant man think I am not an insect.

Speaker 4:          01:03:19       I am a human being. Well, it's the do with Mooc. It's um, so technically she's a midget. So you would think people would kind of leave us alone out of respect for her shortness. But people's people stare me down everywhere we go. She's cute, nice and sweet, but I feel uncomfortable being part of a side show all the time. Do you think it's acceptable for a tall man to date a tiny, a tiny women, tiny woman is what you mean? Do I think it's acceptable? Yeah, it's totally acceptable. Date with who you want to a date. What's not? What's not acceptable is dating someone you're not comfortable being seen within public? Um, I would work on not giving a fuck or I would get out of the relationship because, uh, I don't know how she hasn't picked up on it already. But, uh, if you're not comfortable with the person you're dating, I mean, I mean, I don't know if someone can walk down the street with me and be comfortable walking down the street with a fucking redheaded freak. Um, I think that, ah, you know, you could get comfortable with her and when you, when you walked down the street with the, you don't have her like fucking, you know, what are those?

Speaker 4:          01:04:38       You don't have them. One of those kiddie things, you know, where she's sitting on you that your chest like a fucking primate. I guess we're all primates, aren't we? You know, in monkeys when the fucking monkey just hangs on the other, you know, wraps her arms around your back. Yeah, I'm being a Dick Right now. You ever in a fanny pack? See this? I'm doing the exact fucking thing. Well, you got to understand that's what people are going to do. You got to understand. If you're a different looking, couple people are going to give you shit and you just got to get beyond it. You know, that's all I can say. I shouldn't have made those jokes. Cause now you're probably thinking like see you being a cunt to, I'm not being a condom. Being a guy who is not even remotely funny this fucking week trying to trudge through 15 fucking minutes, 50 minutes of a podcast. All right? So I have to make fun of everything. So, uh, I dunno. She's adorable. She's nice. If you think she's the one I would, I would stay with her. Um, if you don't think she's the one, get out of it immediately because even if she's not the one, eventually you'll have feelings for. And then when you break up with her, you know, when you sat her on the coffee table and say, look, we have to have a talk.

Speaker 4:          01:05:52       I'm sorry dude, I'm on any joke, any, any port in a storm, I gotta fucking do it. And she starts crying. You know, it's the worst. That's why you know something. I'll tell you right now. This is why like, I love how it's unacceptable to break up with somebody over the phone. You know who came up with that is women because they know how guilty they can make us fucking feel when they start crying. They want to make us feel is, it's a total vindictive fucking mood. There's nothing wrong with breaking up with somebody on the phone. There's nothing wrong with like that dude on sex in the city who wrote it on a post it and stuck it to the TV. I have a girlfriend. I have seen some episodes of that show. Um, although I never get through the whole one because I would always piss my girl off cause anytime the hoary girl would make us anything she said in the show was always sexually related.

Speaker 4:          01:06:50       And I told you guys this before, need any lines? She said after she said it, I would just go cause she's a whore and it would just piss my girl off to no one until by the end of the show she was doing it too. But anyways, I digressed. Let's fucking, let's fucking just plow ahead. There's nothing wrong no matter what. It's going to make him cry. There's nothing wrong with breaking up with someone through email. There's nothing wrong with doing it with the post it, there's nothing wrong with doing it over the phone in a way. There's actually, it's a caring thing that they're doing. It's like I care about you so much and it would hurt me so much to see how much I'm hurting you that I can't even deal with watching how much I'm going to hurt you. You know, and you're out.

Speaker 4:          01:07:35       It's a vindictive thing that women want you eyeball to eyeball. Watch you stand there and watch you crush them by saying, I don't want to be in a fucking relationship with you anymore. You know, it's fucking awful. What I always do, and you know back in the day when I used to have to break up with somebody, I used to just think this, all right, dude, it's, it's two hours of your life. The first leg of it, it's like the Tour de France, okay? We're just trying to get to the mountains. All right? The first two hour fucking leg, all right? She's going to cry. It's going to suck. We have to stick to you fucking guns. All right? Sit down. Just say, and there's probably people out there right now who need to get out of a relationship and you just don't know how to do it cause you're young.

Speaker 4:          01:08:21       All right? It's not going to get better. You can't make yourself love the person. You just have to fucking get out of it. And this goes for the broads out there too. He just have to go, look, we need to talk. All right. I don't know what's going on, but I'm just not happy anymore, you know? And you can use all the hacky stuff. You're a great person, but I'm just not, I'm not feeling it. I'm just not. And you know, that's, that's a hold of her is to it. Look at Murray, get nervous, just picture of the girl crying, crying. It's all there. You know, you're, it's not fair to you. It's not fair to you. It's so, what do you say? We care can't work. And this is the thing, they try to fucking, they try to save it and you just have to be like that dude in the first star wars. Stay on target, stay on target. Right.

Speaker 4:          01:09:24       Well, you know, I've, I've been thinking things like that too. I just think we don't see each other enough big, you know? And maybe that's what I've been avoiding. You, you can't say that can't be mean and just be like, look, no. Um, um, it's truly how I feel and yeah, that's, it's just, it's just how I feel. And then just let them a moat and let them go. You know, it's like deep sea fishing when you get that line in, the fucking thing takes off. We got a bike, you gotta let it go. You can't fucking clamp the thing down and then snap the line. You know, zen, she's free. She's going to come back around and attack the fucking boat, like in jaws.

Speaker 4:          01:10:14       You gotta let her go jump up out of the water, flop around and get fucking tired, you know, and, and uh, yeah, and you just, you just, it's a two hour fucking thing. Okay. And all you have to do is just say how you're feeling and then just let her fucking run and start fucking crying and go through all the emotions she needs to, to, to get through. And you just have to sit there and stick to your guns. All right? And then comes, the hardest part is, uh, if you're in her apartment, that's a great thing. So you can fucking leave. It's worse if they do it in your apartment because then you have to kick them out. So yeah, that's how I feel. And, uh, I need you to vacate the premises and right as you say that you got to have your friends step out, dress like a bouncer with one of those fucking cell ear ear piece. Thanks.

Speaker 3:          01:11:16       Okay.

Speaker 4:          01:11:17       Standing there like a bouncing, you know when they stand with their hands folded in front of him one hand holding the wrist of the other arm, you know, no, you got to do it over to her place and just say, you know,

Speaker 3:          01:11:31       okay,

Speaker 4:          01:11:32       I'm not going to date anybody for a while or whatever the fuck you guys say. And I, I just, and if she says, can I call you? You just, yeah, you just say yes, yes you can. And then decide whether you really meant that or not later. But, uh, and I dunno. And then you got, I don't know, then you get, you got to get it and then he got to get away from him. You got to get away from him. Um, because if you keep coming back, it just starts the pain over again. And then also on your level is you're going to have to try to get over them even though you're are over him, but still now you're going to be alone. You can have that panic attack. Well, who am I going to be with? What did I used to do when I was single? How did I fill up all this fucking time? Just ride it out. Just know it's going to suck for six weeks. All right? Six weeks later you're out. Football season starts, you know the smell of fall comes through the fucking windows.

Speaker 3:          01:12:38       Okay?

Speaker 4:          01:12:38       You know? Yeah, buddy fucking brings over maybe a couple of girls that were into sports. You find another one. God Damn. I look at her and then you're a, you're on your fucking way. It's spring again in the fall. See, it has a happy ending. That's how you fucking do it. Jesus Christ. There was some advice for you. How to fucking break up with somebody. Do you guys have any stories about like the worst way you were ever broken up with or the best, best way somebody ever broke up with you? You know, I broke up with someone one time and then I bought her a hot dog and it was weird. It was when I was a little bit older and I just had a really, it was just totally fucking honest. I just had an honest talk and I said, look, we're both, we're both couple psychos. I mean, haven't you noticed? I had you ever have that fucking relationship where everything, it just doesn't feel right and then you freak out, you have an argument and then you've just fuck, and then it feels right again. And then it slowly starts going off course again and then you have a big argument and then you fuck again right after it.

Speaker 4:          01:13:57       And I know I just finally hit me. It was just like, yeah, well this is just, this relationship isn't working, really isn't working. And then what happens is, is then we fuck. And it's a lot of fun. It's just, it's just based on sex. We're having a really good time fucking before indicating if I could try to be a gentleman here. That's basically what we're doing. But other than that, we don't really enjoy each other's company. You want a hot dog?

Speaker 4:          01:14:33       You know what it was, was I did it early enough in the relationship where the woman's still actually respected me and she actually complimented me. I mean it was a little more involved than that. MMM. But she actually called me. She goes, you know what that was. Yeah, that was a pretty good breakup. I got to give it to you. Then you walk me down to the train. We waved goodbye as the train slowly went away. It was like the end of like a fucking a film noir movie. What else? Classic films. He played it for her. You can play it for me. Play it for me. They're fucking black guy who doesn't get any lines cause it's 1940. [inaudible] math. I um, I was actually a, the TV here in my walk in closet. $400 a night fucking hotel. Um, okay. I was actually watching that Turner movie classics, man.

Speaker 4:          01:15:24       Jesus Christ. When I get on that thing, forget about it. I was actually, I watched you don't like the road movie. The Buddy road movie. I didn't realize this, the first ones, the guys who invented that genre of movie, um, was um, was it bing Crosby and fucking Bob hope I had no idea. And they will write as I had to go out last night to watch, um, to go run my set. They had the third in their trilogy and I forget of the buddy movies. I think they did more after that, but I guess this was the best one. And I, I can't even remember the name of the movie, but it, the, basically the premise of the movie was that they went to some fucking Arabian, you know, back then there was no Middle East. Everything was just Arabian, whatever the fuck that meant. Or does that mean like Arabic country?

Speaker 4:          01:16:18       I don't fucking know. But the whole thing was they had to get out of something. So Bing Crosby cells, uh, Bob Hope into slavery. Like slavery was still funny back then. I don't know what the fuck I'm saying. All I know is I watched the thing and bright, the movie that I watched right before that was a movie called zero hour and it absolutely blew me away. I'm sitting there watching this movie. I came in in the middle of this, this flick and there's a guy talking about this guy who's got to try to land this plane. And the guy's name is Ted striker. I'm going Ted striker. That was the name of the guy in airplane and it's literally the same movie. And I finally fucking realize that that was the movie that airplane was Perry making a parody of, um, was a movie called zero hour that came out in like the mid fifties for the life of me.

Speaker 4:          01:17:16       I thought that they will make it fun. You know those movie airport airports, 76 airports, 77, those ones with like George Kennedy, I thought that they were making fun of those movies and they weren't, they basically almost did a frame for frame remake of zero hour. And, um, if you don't want to watch the movie, go on Youtube and watch airplane versus zero hour, you can't fucking believe how similar. I mean, all these subtle things. They brings the kid up to the cockpit. A Billy ever been up in a cockpit before and he's like, no, this is my first time except in the real one. The first one it drops off there, but an airplane. Then the guy says, Billy, you ever seen a grown man naked? They added all that shit. So zero hour, check out that movie. I'll give you the youtube videos for the week.

Speaker 4:          01:18:08       Am I at least at 30 minutes? 44 minutes. I somehow fucking did it again this week. All right. Youtube videos of the week. Go check out a best have balls of steel to jackass show from, I dunno, over in England. And uh, these guys are fucking great. They're fucking, they're just hilarious. And they keep going to this Mcdonald's gimme fall big macs gimme seven double cheeseburgers and some fucking daddy down. It's, and I know a ditty donuts are, but they just keep going and some fucking Dedi down. It's, and it makes me laugh every time. And I just butchered it. I'm telling you, it's funny. And also for you animal fans out there, watch eagle verse goat, I guess in the wild. This is how strong these eagles are. They find little goats and they fly down to them that goes fucking runaway. The Eagles grab them, pick them up, just we'll grab one of their legs and they drag him off the cliff and just drop them.

Speaker 4:          01:19:07       That's how they kill him. But they actually have the ability to fly a little bit with them. That's how strong they are. And they wait til they are high enough and then they just drop them and they bounced down off the cliff like some sort of x Gamer who lost his footing and uh, the goat dies and then they fly down and they fucking eat it. And then you go. And I think that that's going to be the podcast for this week. Cause I, uh, I actually have to go a New York, I got to go do some shit. You know, people don't go to New York, just stay in the hotel rooms. That's how we justify making him so fucking small God damn. Cons. Hey, let me, uh, let me hype some of the Shit that I actually have coming up. Um, here's something that actually fell out of the sky.

Speaker 4:          01:19:52       I have a gig coming up in Chicago. All right, and why isn't my fucking webpage loading official site of Bill Burr, Bill, burr.com, everybody, it'll make you a better person.

So just want to thank all you guys ahead of time.

Speaker 4:          01:21:11       After that, on July 31st I'll be at the shoreline amphitheater in mountain view, California with like 10 other fucking comedians doing something up there for a radio program.

So all you guys down to San Diego who have always asked me when the fuck you coming. I'm coming on August 6th and August 7th. All right. And the last thing will be, I'm going to hype, I'm Newport Yachting Center in Newport, Rhode Island, August 12th and the Hampton Beach Casino and Hampton, New Hampshire, Hampton Beach, New Hampshire on August 13th. And I'm, by the way, last week I did a little rant, you know about the Lebron James, you know, being afraid of the big um, big stage in New York and actually went down to the comedy store and a fuck you, I always forget the pipe that the damn page, the [inaudible] podcast.com.

Speaker 4:          01:22:15       All right, the m M podcast.com. Go to that. That's the official, there's no other fan page for the Monday morning podcast, the m m podcast.com. All the references I've made. I know I made a reference to something fucking old a number of times in this podcast. He puts up all the references, all the youtube videos will be there so you can just click on them as I'm talking about him. And um, anyways, we actually filmed, I did a different rant along the same lines and they put it up on Barstool sports. It got a ton of fucking hits and uh, touch her and, and Dave, is that the name of the show? I'm such a Douche. How did I, how did I fuck that up? I just pan. You don't want it is cause I don't know how to read that. Actually thought toucher was too sure as I was like, is it, is it too sure the guys on BCN touch or enrich?

Speaker 4:          01:23:10       There we go. My brain isn't fucking awake. I ain't have to look it up just for the fucking record. What an, you know what? I just tried to thank those guys and I fucked up the name of this show. Touch your enrich, played it and then actually it let me call in and Ha and hype my show. So I'm feeling like I'm really becoming Internet savvy because back in the day I'd have to get on a plane for six fucking hours, land, get up two hours later, go into their studio, half asleep and half is funny as I usually am and try to hype my gigs. I actually got a plug out a month beforehand or three weeks before, two weeks. I don't know what the date is. Touch her and rich. Sorry about that. Guys want an asshole. Um, anyways, that's the podcast for this week.

Speaker 4:          01:23:52       I hope you guys enjoyed it. And, um, I wanted to know was it easier to download last week when I put it through garage band because I was actually able to make it a smaller audio file. Did it download quicker? Cause I think I'm going to try to do it again this week because I know it uploaded a lot quicker. Was that interesting? You know what? I think that's very fitting that I said something that wasn't funny to end this podcast because that's how it's felt. I know I came out with a head of steam, you know what I mean? I came out guns a blazing, kind of like a Peyton manning football season. Just lighten everybody up and then right in the end when it really counts, I shit the bed. Wow.
