Speaker 1:          00:00:01       Hey, what's going on? It's bill burn. It's time for the Monday morning podcast for April 2nd, 2018 what's going on? How welcome to April everybody. Oh, you didn't think you'd make it, did you? Oh the God damn snow just kept falling out of the fucking sky and all these fucking liberal concept talking about global warming. Oh yeah, I'll fucking cool you off when my fucking toes. You can't. Um, global warming. I love on people who fucking, when it snows in the winter, people just go to global warming. Um, I dunno bill, don't try to be a scientist. Okay. You've tried to be a lot of things on this podcast and failed miserably. Why would you pick such as smart vocation to start off with? Well, you know, cause I'm an arrogant ass. Oh, did I sleep well last night? You know, I uh,

Speaker 1:          00:01:06       um, you know, I got my big, big birthday coming up my 50th birthday. So my deal was there's a certain weight I wanted to get down to and a one of those gene companies, you know that advertise on my podcast, I can't remember the fucking name of them. It's one of those people, you know, we were two broke college kids, so we started a fucking Jean factory kits. Like, well how the fuck did you do that? Thought you were broke. You know, if you're trying to be all down to earth and next thing you know, you gotta you gotta fucking company. What are you telling me? You just sold them yourself. Yeah, we'll make you a pair of pants set will be about a, I don't know what we got to learn how to sell first. Uh, well cause we're Bronx sir. We can't afford any sewing machines and people that know how to operate them. Okay. Paulagy accepted and I'm sorry too for yelling, but you know, if you want jeans from us, it's just going to take a moment.

Speaker 2:          00:02:02       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:02:03       So staying up on this thing so I can measure your, do your inseam. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:02:08       So anyways, they sent me a pair of jeans that were a 30 to 32 would I, you know, I was 34, 32. Uh, and now I'm 33, 32. So my, my goal is to get back to that. I think that's the size that I had in high school slash when I started, um, started doing comedy. So I'll see if I can, I don't know. I don't know if I want to do that. Cause you know, this is one of those things where like if your, uh, if your, your high school weight when you're my age, but you never really went up, I don't think you look that bad. But like if you get down to your high school weight and you were actually like an adult males weight, uh, you kind of look like you're dying.

Speaker 2:          00:02:55       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:02:55       Um, but we'll see. Uh, I am back on my little health kick here. Um, I told you last Monday, you know, I did the goddamn comedy jam and, um, I had a shot at Jamison before the show, you know, sort of a tradition, you know, drink a little shot of fucking courage. And then after the show I went out, I was just going to have one beer and it was going to go home, but I showed up and somebody already bought me another Jameson. So I had that. And then I had a beer, but you know, the, the shot and the beer was stretched way out between the first, like the whole show went by like three hours. Um, and I had a couple of waters after the first shot, so it was really just the shot of Jameson in the beer. And the next day I woke up.

Speaker 1:          00:03:40       And, um, aside from the fact that I stayed out till one in the morning, my lovely daughter gets up at like, oh, six, six 30, I just woke up and I just, I wasn't worth a shit until like fucking two in the afternoon. And, um, I was just like, I can't, I, I can't do this. I just can't fucking do this. So I didn't drink Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, and then Friday I performed at arguably my favorite theater in the country. Um, the Brady theater and Tulsa, Oklahoma. And it's, I cannot expect fucking place and the people that show up there and the way the laugh sound in that room and the sound and the look of that fucking place, it's, it's unreal. The amount of people too who've never been there. When I told them I was going to Tulsa, Oklahoma, they were like Tulsa, Jesus, you know, thinking that it was going to be like tumbleweeds and stuff.

Speaker 1:          00:04:41       It's a really fucking hipster replace. Like the food scene alone is crazy and you know when the food is really good, then you're going to have the record store, which I liked the record store. I don't necessarily like, you know, the Douche is that go in there, you know, I, you know, I'm a Douche to, but like I was actually riffing about that on stage where people like, dude, it's sounds so much better. It's like I can't hear the difference. I can't hear that Daniel knew the CD was, it was a lie man. Everything got compressed and two, they just get into a whole fucking sound thing. And I'm just, I just like records because they reminded me when I was a kid, you know, and you feel like you kind of got more for your money. Well, you know, you open it up and there was all these pictures on the inside sleeve and all of that shit.

Speaker 1:          00:05:26       Um, I dunno. As opposed to now you just download it off off like iTunes and it's just floating in the air man. Um, so anyways, I uh, so gifts getting offstage that night, it was like, I'm not going to drink. And I just felt like, uh, you know the habit of me doing that being like, come on man, just have fucking one. Cause I was flying after the show. It was like that show in Tulsa. Every fucking reason why I ever wanted to be a comedian. It was so much fucking fun. I was barely doing my act. I forget what I did. Oh, I know why I, I connected. I flew to Dallas, connected there and then went up to Tulsa. And um, the second I got on the plane in Tulsa, like there was just like three or four really big people, you know, not just fat but just big ass fucking people. So I was just riffing on that. One of them. Two people was so big and fat they had to use wheelchair. So I was just riffing on the fact, you know? Yeah. Are you really helping them out if you're wheeling them around like a fucking toddler and you know, it's like, I'm not trying to like bring back segregation here, but I really think wheelchairs to just be for people who can't fucking, whose legs don't work. It's like your legs work, you asshole lay off the cookies.

Speaker 2:          00:06:55       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:06:57       I actually said you guys so fat that even if he has a full head of hair, you can still see most of his scalp. You know, cause even that, it's just get, even his head is getting like fat. It's like stretching out. It was unbelievable. This guy sat in the chair in front of me and the fucking chair. It was like coming down and it was one of those things like an action movie, like it's just going to fucking stop or am I going to get crushed to death? And it stopped about two inches from the bridge of my nose. I think I audibly exhaled like, you know, cause it's like, I mean, watching that guy tried to get up, it'd be like my daughter, she's still can't do like a sit up. You know what I mean? She just doesn't have the strength. It's hilarious. She gets like three inches up and she's making this face and she's staring at yeah. And then I just start laughing and then she laughs, which, you know, makes her fall back down again.

Speaker 2:          00:07:48       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:07:50       So anyways, she said Dad die now all the time, but she was in the crib this morning and I'm always the one that goes out and I get her and then, uh, you know, pick her up and I figured out, because she gives the best hugs, but she's also, you know, a toddler now, so she just wants to look at everything. So when she says she only does it for half a second. So the way to trick her into giving you a nice minute long hug it, she got to sing to her and she loves sea itsy bitsy spider right now like that. That's your fucking jam, right? So I just come out there and she's like, hi, hi. Hi. Hi. You know, showing off the word that she knows how to say. And then I just pick her up and she gives me the quick hug and then immediately is pointing over to the changing table cause you know, she wants to get that over with so she could then go in and watch a little cartoons, you know, and drink a bottle of milk. Right. That I got it down now I just pick her up and I just go, oh the itsy bitsy spider went up. The water spout. Dow came though Ray, they're wise to spider out and by, she's already later head. I sing. It's sweeter than that. I kind of pushed through with you guys, didn't want to creep you out, but she fucking uh, puts their head down on my shoulder.

Speaker 1:          00:09:06       It just sits, there is content. I could sing the song like six times in a row and she'll just lay there. And then when I get sick of that song, I just sing the abcs and uh, and did she does this thing, if you squeeze her and you go give me a hug, her too little fat hands. She grabs two handfuls of your shirt. That's fucking adorable. Um, I'm starting to realize why dad's cry at their daughter's wedding. You know, I used to do, I think it was some weird shit though. They would just like thinking like, oh, this guy is good. Even if even if they haven't already bagged, he's got a banger now tonight. Yeah. Oh God, you pluck an ass hole. And I got to pretend like I like, um, you know, thinking like that shit. It isn't, they're thinking about the Etsy be like, I used to sing this kid, the itsy bitsy spider, you know, where did the fucking decades go? So anyways, going back to my, uh, you know, the booze and, and shit like, um, I dunno. So then,

Speaker 1:          00:10:10       uh, you know, that man, it's like that's already going to be the greatest moments in my life are going to be those and I just don't want to be all banged up and extra tired and God forbid grumpy. So, um, I dunno. So then San Antonio, I did two shows, fucking amazing crowds down there. Um, and once again I just carried over whatever happened in Tulsa. Uh, I've learned how to do that though, as far as like what happens as you know, when you go out on one night, you just in the zone and you're not even doing your act the next night you come on stage, you're like hoping that you're going to be in the zone again the night before. You weren't hoping that you were going to be in the zone. It just happened. So then you going out there and now you're hoping it's going to be like last night.

Speaker 1:          00:11:00       So now you're walking on stage and you're thinking about last night. So you're not, you're not like mentally, they're not to get all trippy. So what I do is I try to let go of the last night, but do the same fucking thing that I did in that. I'll just talk about something that I just fucking saw except this time it's in San Antonio. And I just came out and I was bitching about the fact that I didn't realize that the final fucking for Pfoa was in San Antonio. I kind of figured it out when it was 500 bucks a night at a Goddamn red roof inn bought up by the fucking airport. Um,

Speaker 1:          00:11:43       and then it was just like this going to be a real problem with transportation. I had to hire this company, you know, to make sure they get picked me up the airport. Get Dean, you, it was out there with del Rio del rape. Fucking murdered so hard in Tulsa. He had a sustained round of applause. Like he had to wait before he introduced me. That's how fucking hard this guy's killing. So you got to go see dean when he's out in the road. Actually watch them do like a full set. I know he has an album coming out to uh, on vinyl, I believe, speaking of records. So, um, anyways, I went out and just did the same thing and on both shows I just, you know, fucked around and rift about some shit and it just got me into this place. And then it was fun cause I was, you know, both nights I was teasing people about having an ar fifteens and telling them how they should go about talking to people on the left about why you have an ar 15.

Speaker 1:          00:12:43       And um, it just, it just was a fucking great night both nights. So what does my point? So my point is, I just, you know, through, I was watching the Zen diaries of Garry Shandling, this fucking incredible documentary that Judd Apatow did. Um, and it is such the standup comedian he experience, I literally had to take breaks from it. I had to shut it off or hit pause. I'd be watching the thing right. And I would just, something he would write down because Gary I guess kept all these diaries and stuff and judge just, we'll just like film like just a line or two that he wrote. And uh, it would either be something that I thought or something that I never realized and it's just like, yeah, that's it. Or just an experience that I had and obviously all my experiences are in a way less like whatever experience he had at the tonight show or hosting the Emmy's.

Speaker 1:          00:13:43       I had plane, you know, uncle fuckees and you know that Swampscott Massachusetts. Um, but I just kept fighting. I would be watching this. She was hilarious. It'd be watching the show and he would be like in the other room and then she just hit me in the other room just going like, ah, and um, just watching how the way this thing is put together, I'm not going to ruin it for you. But just seeing how, like one like major event, when you're a kid with your developing mind, be it positive or negative, how it just shapes and informs the rest of your life and the way that it is done is so fucking masterful in this documentary. And um, I don't know, I just can't say enough things about it. So I was sitting there after having watched it, or actually I'd watched up to the, like the first half hour of part two.

Speaker 1:          00:14:46       I mean, it's like four and a half hours long and it's fucking amazing. And I was actually out on the road going, fuck, I wish I could watch the rest of that right now. You know, it's just, you know, I, it's hard to find four and a half hours when you got, you know, you've got a 14 month old to just sit down in a row. So I was out there and I was just thinking about, you know, I was mad at myself that and went out after Tulsa and I had a drink. I had one drink and then somebody sent one over to me. And of course I'm going to drink that cause they didn't want to be rude and you know, I'm a bit of a Booze Hound and um, I kinda just was sticking to myself. Like, uh, I told myself I wasn't going to drink until fucking June and I already fucked up on the road.

Speaker 1:          00:15:27       Not even cause I wanted to just started like, you know, I'm flying high and fucking wide awake. I don't want the night to end, you know, um, to awake to fucking go is still to sleep. I got an 8:00 AM flight, let me just fucking have one. And then next thing you know, I'm fucking staying out till like one in the goddamn morning. I gotta get up at six for the flight is what am I doing? I should be out here getting sleep for when I come back. So I going to be a better dad. This is stupid. So, because I watched, you know, at that point, the first half of the zen diary thing, I actually had a notebook because I was writing out some of the drum parts for these songs. I got to sing with Dell Rake, not saying sorry, play on Tuesday night out here at the Avalon.

Speaker 1:          00:16:09       And uh, I was just like, why don't you just write down, you know, these goals? Cause sometime if he, sometimes if you just fucking think them, they're not real and then I feel Sam or write them down anyways, how my brain works, it becomes real. So I just kind of wrote it down the shit that I wanted to do, you know, the shape I wanted to be in and yeah, I just wrote down that I was just for the month of April. I'm just like, I'm not smoking any fucking cigars. I'm not drinking any booze. Um, you know, not watching any fucking porn, you know, fucking stupid online porn, lonely shit you do on the road and that porno, I swear to God it's going to come out like how bad that is for you, your brain, you know what I mean? Cause I find myself now when I watch porno laughing, like I'm watching a sitcom, it's always something that just strikes me is fucking funny.

Speaker 1:          00:17:09       Um, yeah. And it's just like, I shouldn't be laughing while was this, this weird. Right. And then you also think like, you know, you go back, I don't know how many fucking years, like if you went back like a hundred years and you showed somebody like a laptop and be like, yeah, you realize you can watch this and you just put it on the, I swear to God, they would burn you at the stake. Lik you were a fucking, which like how fucked up it would be that a human being could sit down anytime they wanted and just watch endless hours of that shit. Um, I bet I did some brain damage. Something. It's like you fucking, it's like you, I, I really feel like, um, um, destroying my soul by watching that shit on some level. So I was like, good to not do that. I'm going to fucking continue to work out all of these, just sort of these, these, these, I dunno, health goals and then I got to work on my, my, uh, my anger issues because my daughter doesn't realize I have them yet and it's just inevitable.

Speaker 1:          00:18:14       She's going to, I've been doing this joke on my act, how it likes a couple of times she seen me start to slice. She, she honestly hasn't even met me yet as far as like who I really am. She's met the side of me that I'm proud of, but all this shit that I'm ashamed of, she hasn't really met yet. She's seen a couple of glimpses, but I'm always able to joke my way out of it. Like, Oh Daddy, always through the laptop through the Weirdo. She's laughing because she doesn't know what those words mean or that, that behavior is fucked up. Right. So I dunno, that's just shit I have to work on. So, uh, I don't know. I don't think I would have written that down and it would have become real had I not watched that. Uh, Zen diaries, a Gary Shayla, I'm telling man, you gotta you gotta fucking see that thing and speaking the way HP, I was killing it this month because they have like a, they got one on a documentary on like Andre the giant, Martin Luther King.

Speaker 1:          00:19:12       Um, Elvis. I mean they just, I mean, and I think it comes out every Wednesday. So if you're not watching the NHL rivalry fucking Wednesday, uh, or even if you are just tape some of these things, because you know, HBO, they always do everything fucking top shelf. It's going to be amazing. So anyways, I have some things to, uh, have I made you guys laugh once yet? I've just been fucking being an idiot here talking about this shit, but it's also, I just feel like I'm doing is very me. Um, all right. I've got a couple of announcements here. One, I'm transitioning. Okay. Uh, October six, 2018 I'm going to be in Bridgeport, Connecticut. All right. At Webster Bank arena. Uh, general public on sale will be Friday, April 6th at noon. April six one I'm gonna be in Pittsburgh for two shows. Um, what an idiot. Then people are not going to be there. I'm really hyping other shows. I'm trying to hype this new one. October 6th, 2018 Bridgeport, Connecticut, Webster Bank arena. General public on sale will be Friday, April 6th at noon. The presale starts today. Today. All right, the code is Billy Baldwin. You get it Billy bald when all capital letters, no spaces. B I l L Y B a l d for The win win. Um, anyways, you know, it was fucking hilarious. I, I did the Brady theater in Tulsa. I pull up and uh, this is one dude standing outside,

Speaker 1:          00:20:51       you know, the fucking, the stage door. All right. And uh, I got to sing. I hate meeting people before the show, after the show, I don't give a fuck, but before the show, I, I can't, it's just, it's weird to me. It's like I haven't done my fucking thing that I do. So, um, I'm thinking about doing that. You know, I don't, I, I I no problem after, before it just weirds me out. So I go to it and this guy goes, he's like, yeah, hey bill, a big fan of getting mega good gum. I, I go to sign his fucking shit and all of a sudden I feel like this sticky thing, like I had like syrup in my hand or something. I handed back to Penn and I looked down at my fucking hand is just co cop might get the ink, the pen exploded.

Speaker 3:          00:21:37       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:21:38       Oh fuck. I look like I don't know what I look like. So I walk in and it's really like thick.

Speaker 3:          00:21:45       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:21:46       Like black or blue ink. I went in the bathroom and I'm like trying to scrub the skin off my fucking hand.

Speaker 3:          00:21:52       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:21:53       And um, you know, del Ray's laughing at me and shit, look at literally shit. You know, my hands are so pasty, so I got this, it's like my cancer in black face, right. So I'm fucking scrubbing the shit off and I was able to get most of it off, but there's still like, you know, you can see the stain of it. MMM. I wish I talked about that when I went out on stage. Um, but I did. So I went out and I did the show. And as I go to walk off the stage, who comes walking down to the front of the stage, hey bill, but blah, blah, blah, blah. I already met here. I already signed you shit. And I already got the egg all over my hair, but he's getting married. So going over Shay, man, thank you. I go, you know, good luck with your marriage and everything.

Speaker 3:          00:22:39       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:22:39       So that I fucking walk out. Right.

Speaker 3:          00:22:42       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:22:42       Just talking to Dana. I'm like, Dude, how fucking unbelievable is that theater? You'd say, Oh, you know, the sound is unbelievable crab about blah. You know, Dean, that show was fire, right? So we go outside and uh, we go to leave the places like 10 or 15 people there, right? So I'm fucking day guys, thanks for coming out, talk to people, you know, signing shit or whatever and this fucking guy comes up again and he wants me to sign more shit. And I'm thinking in my head, it's just like this flickers guy coming back from fucking second. So mean, why did you, you know, there's other people here. We already did this and I shook your hand. So I got to sign something fucking else. Study has and I feel this sticky thing. He gave me the same fucking 10 again and I was so stupid that I went and I grabbed the thing and I just like that. Yeah, you fucking asshole. You Go, you've got an exploded pen here. And then he just starts laughing.

Speaker 3:          00:23:31       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:23:32       And now I got to shit on my fucking hand, my hands, all the exact same, almost exact same fingers and all that. Obviously I'm not ambidextrous switching my hands and I'm just like in Dean's fucking ned deed signed something, forms we bowls, walked back into the fucking car, we got ink all over our hands and the drivers laughing his ass off at us because he saw me when I went in and go that fucking asshole. It exploded pen. So as this is the thing, as I go to get in the car, this same dude who I already signed, his shit, got ink on my hand, shook his head after the fucking show. You know, as a walking offstage, shook his hand, sign more, shit, got more fucking exploded in my hand. Even when goes, he goes, hey bill, did you go to a Po address that I could send these six to these pictures I took on his cell phone. I just go, now you fucking asshole. I got a call over my hand again. And he just starts laughing. Then they felt bad and go, good luck with your marriage.

Speaker 2:          00:24:29       Yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:24:29       we get in, the cars would drive it away and I just was just riffed about the poor woman that is going to marry that fucking guy, you know? Cause it was something about them. You couldn't get mad at him. But I really think that that exploding pen was a fucking omen, you know, that he was just going to be like, I dunno. Jesus Christ. So anyways, I um, let me read a little bit of advertising and then I'll tell you about San Antonio going down there with the final four experience going on. Um, where the hell is it? What do we got here? What do we got this week? Oh, it don't cheat. Oh, talk about how a made to measure suit fits compared to a generic off the rack suit. Well, unless you're like a generic off the rack size, I imagine your ankles are going to be showing and your balls are going to be snugged or uh, you know, you're going to be looking like you have your big brother's pants on if you're a little shorty.

Speaker 2:          00:25:29       Yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:25:30       I mean obviously do I really need to explain to people that if they actually take your fucking measurements, I mean, if they take your measurements, it's going to fit

Speaker 2:          00:25:38       okay

Speaker 1:          00:25:38       the way it's supposed to fit it on. All of a sudden women are going to be looking at you like, Oh, who's that guy look at all fucking sharp in his suit as opposed to trying to hit the lottery

Speaker 1:          00:25:50       and being like, you know, did the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the fucking person in El Salvador that sell this together. You know, it was he the same size as me. Guys love the wide selection of high quality fabrics and the option to personalize all the details, including your lapel lining and monogram as kind of cool that you can pick out your own, the pel and aligning. All right, so later on that night, you know, and you're on your date and you'd take your jacket off and you fucking put it around the back of the chair. You get a little flash, their monogram, you taking yourself seriously. All of a sudden the woman thinks you're fucking, you're running something. Um, back when guys used to go buy a, you know, by the initial, this is an h g wells. Say, here's how it works. Visit a show room or shop online@indochino.com pick your fabric, Tujia customizations, submit your measurements, weight for your custom suit to arrive. And just a few weeks after, fuck,

If you buy a fucking cheap pair, they don't do anything. You still squinting behind them. Now your face is all mushed up wearing sunglasses. You look like a fucking asshole and they're digging into the right above your ear on your scalp. But then if you buy a nice expensive pair, then you got to sit there going like, oh my God. Oh my God, what if I, what if I lose it? What if I sit on, I'm in. And inevitably that fucking habits. Okay, movement. That's what I feel about fucking sunglasses. How dare you put words in my mouth.

Speaker 2:          00:29:35       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:29:36       And I don't feel like I got ripped off. If I pay $200 I feel like a fucking asshole when I lose them. All right, well our friends at movement. Yeah, the watch guys, they kind of felt the same way. Oh, I didn't know if they agreed with me. So they, they thought screw it. I think they thought fuck it.

Go to stamps.com click on the microphone at the top of the homepage and type in bird. That's stamps.com enter [inaudible]. Um, all right, what else did I want to talk about? Oh, another thing with that Gary Shandling think that that documentary really affected me was, you know, one of the things that happens to a lot of comedians is, uh, whatever the fuck happened to us that made us become comedians. Uh, you just start chasing, you know,

Speaker 1:          00:40:23       selling out clubs and get known and becoming famous and all that, and thinking that that's going to fucking, you know, get rid of your demons and, uh, it doesn't. And then you put off the major party of life, which is finding love and starting a family and all of that shit. And, um, you know, the other day I was talking to somebody and they were in their early thirties, and I brought up the Garry Shandling documentary and the person said, who's that? Right? And then I also mentioned like, uh, somehow I brought up Robin Williams and I mentioned that he had, you know,

Speaker 1:          00:41:07       committed suicide a few years in and she didn't even realize he was dead. And she was just like, Mrs Doubtfire. And I was like, in my head, I'm just going to, these people are fucking legends. And it's just like, you know, every generation has their people, you know what I mean? So it's like, it was like so fucking profound. What's like, you chasing all of that fucking shit. And you know, once you, once you're past a certain nick, no one's going to give a shit anymore anyways. So it's like you're trying to, I dunno, it's not like a tangible thing that you can depend on. And I had this big fear when I was going through comedy that I was like, uh, I was like, Oh man, am I gonna be the guy that doesn't get married and never has kids? Because I've seen the other side of that as like, I don't want to fucking, yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:41:58       I don't want to end up being that cliche. And then just being in that fucking, that older fucking comic, you know, and then you got you sport coat on to hide your middle and you're talking to, if you're talking at this point, you're hitting on women that don't know who your bands are and don't know all, all, all your cultural references. They don't even know who these fucking people are and the level of fucking sadness that the, how lonely that feeling would be at. I used to fucking wake up, I didn't literally wake up, but I would be laying in bed on the road thinking about shit like that. And when I was watching this documentary, I remember, you know,

Speaker 1:          00:42:37       thinking, uh, as I was watching Gary wrestling with his demons, I literally said to Nia one point, I was like, marrying you and having a kid. He's the smartest fucking thing I ever did. Thank God. I know I did it late, but thank God I fucking did that because if I didn't, you know, I'd be 70 years old in some fucking God damn hotel on the other side of this shit when nobody gave a fuck. And I would just be laying there drinking myself to death going Acetate, acetate. That literally makes me scared just saying that acetate. Um, anyways, so, uh, I think what I'm gonna do, cause I don't think I'm a diary person, but I think, but I'm going to do is I'm just going to kind of write down in the beginning of the day, just

Speaker 1:          00:43:25       I find it just one day of doing that. It's really vivid and lives now rather than just being this fucking random thought. Like, you know, I need to work on this. Maybe just have a fucking goal each day. So my kid, uh, I can kind of kill off this fucking anger demon that exists in my family tree. I would love to see my family tree. It's got to look like a, that'd be this weird combination of like, oh, that's really nice, but a little upsetting. You know, like a tree in the beginning of winter, um, at a certain time of day, you know, you know, that certain time of day would trees are beautiful, but they start to look a little ominous. That's probably what it would look like. Uh, a tree that's trying. All right. Let's, uh, oh, I didn't tell you guys about my fucking journey back from San Antonio.

Speaker 1:          00:44:22       So, uh, I had a 6:00 AM flight to Tulsa, Oklahoma. You know, I normally I would have flown in the night before, but I got the kid, you know, I can't, can't miss those hours. So I flew in, no problem. Everything was great. The next day I had an 8:00 AM flight to San Antonio for whatever fucking reason. I mean, it's not that long a flight. We're in the same time zone. Wow. How come I couldn't get like the 10 o'clock flight? Right? So we check into the hotel, we do the show, everything's great. And then the next morning I had a 6:00 AM flight and I got off stage of 12 and couldn't get to sleep till like one 32 in the morning. So, uh, it was just like, all right, I'll just sleep on the plane. So we get up at like four 30 in the fucking morning, quarter to five go down there. And my big thing is when I only get like two hours sleep, all I'm trying to do is get on the plane and once I get on the fucking plane it's like I'm just going to go to sleep.

Speaker 1:          00:45:15       You know, I forgot my eye mask and one can't always has to have their fucking shade up, you know, cause they're a morning person and fuck everybody else. You know no consideration for somebody who just fucking stop working at, you know, 12 1230 right. So we get there and I'm laughing at dean cause we are like so fucking tired. It's like you literally like you're hung over or like food. All I gotta do is get on that plane and he's like, I know I'm going to go right to sleep and then I'm going to land at seven 30 la time. Right. By the time I get to my fucking house, it's going to be eight 30. My daughter just got up a half hour early. I'm going to get that whole time with her before she does her first nap. Fucking perfect. Um, and all of a sudden they're like, uh, the flights now going to fucking leave at six 15.

Speaker 1:          00:46:03       You know, cause they said they had to reset the airplane, which I don't know what the fuck that means. Is that some computer shit? I have no idea. And then six 15 became six 45 and I was like, Oh God, don't do this. Please don't do this. And then it became seven 45 and then it got fucking canceled. And then because it was the final four, all the fucking planes was sold out. And the next one they could get us on was 7:00 PM and I was like trying to keep my cool, which of course I didn't. And they said, sir, it's okay. We're going to send everybody on the seven o'clock flight. We're going to send on an excursion today, paid by Delta. I'm like, I don't want to go on an excursion. I want to go to Los Angeles. And she goes, they're going to take you to world.

Speaker 1:          00:46:49       It's like, Oh yeah, I think in it. Buy me a giant fucking lollipop. I don't want to fucking, I don't want to watch an incarcerated killer whale doing fucking jumping through a hula hoop. Okay. I don't want to see that. What I would like, can I go there? And once you set that fucking thing free again, I would see that that would be worth it. You know, watch a jump over a little boy is it goes out out of the bay into a fucking the ocean like free willy. Um, so anyways, so we say Fuck Delta, not fucked delta. Literally fucked Delta, but fuck this situation delta put us in. Cause I know all the airlines this, it's just a, hey, it happens. Okay. The fucking planes not working right. I it, but I'm also frustrated. So I go down to southwest, all of this shit is filled up.

Speaker 1:          00:47:35       Um, so we're like, what about Dallas? Can you fly us to Dallas love field and we'll just fly back. Can't do that. Um, and then we just say, what about Austin? And they go, okay, well Austin, we have a 10:00 AM flight at this point. It's like, you know, getting close to nine. We have an 11 and we have a two 15. So I'm like, all right, put us on the fucking two 15 and you know, it's an hour and a half drive. So Dean goes to get a fucking rental car. And I said, fuck this, let's just Uber then we don't have to deal with picking up the rental car, the shuttle and all that. So we did fucking ubered. I passed out in the fucking car, I got out of the car, I left my fucking headphones in that, this is my third time. Second Time I've lost those Bose headphones.

Speaker 1:          00:48:18       Um, I always keep the charge of the, if anybody has a set of those silver fucking bows or the black ones and you need that little charger cord, uh, send me your address and I'll mail it to you. Um, cause I'm going to have three of them is I just ordered another fucking pair. So anyways, uh, we get out and we got there so fucking fast cause there was no traffic. We actually got on the 1115 had to connect through fucking Phoenix. It wasn't that bad and uh, it all worked out. And uh, and because I had written down that Shit, you know, that I want it to like maybe talk to somebody about my temper or something like that. Um, I was actually completely aware that I was fucking snapping when I snapped like that. That's as far as I've ever been able to get to with my temper. You know, the old new, I would just snap and not think about it. Now I'm actually thinking about it as I do it and have no control over it.

Speaker 1:          00:49:17       So it's even more like torturous now because now like watching myself, ah, you go bill yelling at people that like build, they're trying to save your life. Do you think they're not flying because they want to go through this giant fucking headache? On some level, they're probably losing money because one of their planes cannot fly. Would you like to get up to a cruising altitude and then plunge back to the fucking earth and never see your family again? Oh, Boohoo you have to wait 12 hours to continue living. He was selfish, stupid cunt. Um, but I can't hear anything at that point. I'm in the fucking acetate mode. Um, are, I'm killing that joke. Uh, by the way, um, I am so back into def Leppard now. It's ridiculous. I downloaded pyromania and uh, what was it? High and dry, the one before that. And uh, I'm so into them.

Speaker 1:          00:50:12       I'm actually looking at lefthanded flying V's, you know, like maybe this is the guitar. I'll know how to fucking, I'll actually stick with, um, cause I was just watching their lineup. But what's that guy's name? Pete Willis is the guy that the head on the, on the high and dry. And then they had, um, what's his face filled in for him? Uh, I always forget his fucking name and it's literally the same name as somebody else. Famous. It's Phil Collins, not Phil Collins. He came in and filled in form. Um, but like that, that album, uh, pyromania when that came out, that's just one of those albums that came out during this awesome time and your life. Um, first time he had crushes on fucking chickson you're graded shit. And that fucking album came out, you know, and I did the, and this is what I would do rather than thinking, what can I say to this chicken, my fucking class that I like this lady, I would actually just, I would just go home instead and I would listen to Pyromania fantasizing that I was in the band playing the guitar and singing in front of the school.

Speaker 1:          00:51:20       And even in the fantasies, she would just see me do it and I would still never talk to her.

Speaker 1:          00:51:27       I'm a fucking mess. Um, and that's what leads you. Then they'd just say, well, I can't sing and I can't play guitar. I guess I'll go up there and tell shit jokes. I guess. Thank day time I became a comedian. All right. Rough and rowdy. Charlotte April 13th. Billy's going to wear a fucking silly suit and he's going to fucking make some jokes. You got to watch it. Pay per view. Uh, all right. F One dear. Silly Billy. Greetings from Monaco. Oh, the sovereign state on the French Riviera originally from Portugal. I'm a very big f one fan since I was four years old. Well, it seems like you saw the hay day of it, the second golden age of it with Michael Schumacher. Uh, my grandfather says I wouldn't take my eyes off the cars even if a storm took the roof off the house. It's a beautiful and graceful sport despite how loud it can be. I first saw you from Chappelle and then saw you on an interview on the Internet from Montreal. Let my brother showed me because he's a huge fan of yours. I now am two. Oh, that's great. Thank you. I think this is a very important time in F1. This sport is going to continue to move into the mainstream because the stars in the sports and the storylines of competition are starting to match the popular culture of today. Oh, that's very, uh, uh, what's the word?

Speaker 1:          00:52:43       All I can think of is acetate. That's a very astute analization. Is that the word? I know it can be very Shakespearian. I appreciate you talking about the drivers with respect. Even if you're not a fan of everything they do is incredible. How talented these men are in. Some women are able to navigate it. Some women are able to navigate with precision. That's hilarious. Um, little chauvinism there. I would like very much to see you at more racist and perhaps talking to drivers and Cruz. Thank you.

Oh, and this is, listen to what he says about female drivers near let's say this. He says it's incredible how talent these, these men are and some women are able to navigate with position. Oh, thanks. Thanks for that. Some women are, what, what, where's he going with us? He was just saying that he would love to see me talking to more drivers and being at more, more racist. Oh, well I know you would like that. I would love that. And I think if I could navigate with precision down to the pit area and if you don't trip and fall because you're a woman, right? Yeah. Yes. I'm a chauvinist pig and I attract these people. They need a pot chauvinists needs podcast too. All right, let's, let's talk about 45 she liked records, right? Huh? Yes I do. Hey Sweetie, you want to talk about 40 fives huh?

Speaker 5:          00:55:43       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:55:45       You're gonna tell us the story. What's so crazy right now? She totally has obviously has all these thoughts and she knows what she's saying, but she doesn't understand that we don't talk her jibberish so she'll just be sitting there making all these hand movements, like she's making these profound points and she's going, I shake shack and she's still making, was she still into that noise that she can check crap that she was doing? She's really trying to say words now. Okay. Can you say baby babies? A baby?

Speaker 1:          00:56:22       Oh, there you go. She said so you liked that frog and it break. But they do number Michigan. All right. 40 fives. A Billy burr hole. A long time fan of the podcast. Well thank you. I traveled a lot in your Massachusetts vibes. Always remind me of home. Uh, recently. Don't touch that. Don't touch that. Don't touch that. Um, recently. Um, it's so funny. They always go for like, the thing that's going to hurt them the most is all this stuff here. Shoes, chairs and all that. Goes right for the hot tea. Uh, recently my fiance and I surrendered our weekend nights to playing card games alongside tasty beers at home. I should just playing 45. That sounds like fun. Yeah, we were just saying how we hate those. Like you go to those parties with other adults and they have game night, so he's fucking cards against humanity and all of that stuff. I don't want to do that. Um, but we've got to get to bring back cards. Right. But isn't that a game? That's a game night. If you play cards you, but cards are cool. It's not like playing mad libs. I like cards against humanity though. I feel like if you get kind of high or a little bit drunk, Adolf Hitler's Tate

Speaker 1:          00:57:38       good jokes and cards against humanity are as bad is when you fly southwest. I hate to make fun of them cause I loved that airline. But listening to those people do comedy, I just can't, I get angry at the people encouraging them through. This guy was Sydney, we were going down the uh, you know, we're going down the runway like what? Go on the tarmac or whatever and he's doing the Darth Vader voice. Everybody put on your feet belt.

Speaker 1:          00:58:09       No, it just annoys me that that person doesn't get heckled cause it's just like if I, if I did a joke like that, people would be throwing their chair at me and this guy's getting laughs because I feel like maybe people feel obligated because it's the, the flight crew and you want to be on their good side. It's exactly what it is. It's the awkward silence and people are just in, in the silence of the joke bombing people then laugh because they feel uncomfortable because this is overall nervousness that what we're about to do could kill us. Right. So then the level of comedy that they have to do, you know what I mean? When you're scared, you'll laugh at anything. You just walk in like the rain's really coming down, isn't it? It's like you didn't say anything funny there.

Speaker 1:          00:58:58       Wow. That was close. Nervous laughter. There we go. Uh, I suggest playing 45, which I know Nia. Are you kidding me? No, that'd be cool. We got it. We got, we got to get a cool stereo man. Well, yeah. You know what? We should have our own kind of like night, you know, and music and you and me. Why don't we do, yeah, let's sing some songs. Hug and kiss a little bit where the little ones down. Why don't we do that instead of sitting there going, yeah, I liked it. Yes. Could have said that. Cars again. Hairy asshole. Ooh. Ooh. I think southwest writes those punch lines on those stupid cards.

Speaker 1:          00:59:46       I just don't like that. You don't write the punchline and then you get credit for it. I'm sorry, I'm too, until when did they jump too far deep into the joke? Gay Man. Yeah, right. I don't know. Anyways, we could hardly find any rule. Okay. I suggest playing 40 fives which I can, which I had always played growing up on the north shore, uh, in trying to find the rules online. I was surprised to learn that it's pretty endemic to Massachusetts. What rules? What are we talking about? Oh, we thought he met at 45 as an records. What is fives? It's obviously some kind of game that we don't know about. We thought you were talking about right? They don't know about 45 it's like you don't know what acetate means. I guess so. Yeah. We can hardly friend. Can you do me a favor? Can you say acetate three times in a row with a pause and just no life in your voice between each one?

Speaker 1:          01:00:38       Just pause. Just say acetate three times in a row. Okay. Acetate. Acetate. Slower acetate. No, I meant longer. Pause. That was pretty good. Okay. We'll definitely call you back for the audition. So what was his thing? We can hardly find the rules anywhere. In any case, just curious whether you ever played this game growing up or had any other traditions you found to be a Massachusetts thing once she left. Thanks and hope you can come to Vermont or Montreal sometime soon. Okay. Yes and yes. Oh, I'm so old. I thought you said buy records. That's what I thought it was. Because somebody gave me some records in Tulsa and then they aren't. One of them was a 45. Um, so many I have to get the adapter. Yeah, I don't know it. Watch it. Watch it. Watch it. No, you just, when you're just, you just want to spill that, don't you? All right. 40 45 game.

Speaker 3:          01:01:31       Yeah. Senior game. Hold on a second. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:01:36       40 fives game 45 it's a card game. Yeah,

Speaker 3:          01:01:39       that's what I figured. All right.

Speaker 1:          01:01:47       Why is my Internet's so slow? All right. The Ace of heart is always the best third box. I was playing with a regular deck of cards. This isn't like old maid. You guys remember old maid, you know, and then the classic that I never played granny fucking water. There's another Cape, there's another card game. Nia did. Everybody in the Midwest knows about, uh, euchre and that game would Joe Barton, Nick and j law had talked about card. They were like freaking out. They were just going like entire families had stopped talking to each other on Christmas because of that game. That game is evil. That's like a Pittsburgh, Cleveland, Detroit, that type of area. I think people play euchre. The ace of hearts is always the third best. Trump. Yeah. Week. This is good. This is good. Clean Fun here. The deal, robbing the Trump object of the game.

Speaker 1:          01:02:36       The goal is to accumulate the most chips by winning tricks. How to keep score irregularities to do this. This is, this is a game night bill, so I don't know why you're talking about you're so against the game night. This is what, because I don't like, you know what? I don't like the modern games. I'll play cards. My grandmother was a Bozo and amazing and my aunt against humanity. Do you ever play flinch? No flinches another one. Uh, I, maybe we can. What? You're going to get all these card games. Have you ever played spades as a black people play? Uh, oh, look at me. Do you have a play hearts? That's what white people play.

Speaker 2:          01:03:12       No.

Speaker 1:          01:03:19       Oh, we got, we got to get some cards now. We got to get some cars. We explore each other's like heritage through card games. Yeah. You teach me spades. I got to remember how to play hard. I don't know how to play spades. I've maybe played it. I knew black people's like Domino's. Well, no, we're not talking about Domino's. We're talking about a card game. I know we're not talking about Domino's. Why could you just give me that? That I actually knew something that was like the Chappelle show sketch. I know black people. Dominoes is, come on. I just said, okay. Jesus. Fuck. Okay. Sorry. She's so protective. She's so protective of her culture. You know that Nia market this little, oh, you kissing the baby. Oh yeah. Why are you so protective? We just want to start an argument. You know, why are you so protective of your culture? Well, you let me in. You've never taught me how to taught me how to do let you in. As good as say, you never taught me how to do the, uh, do you know Nia could do the whole Janet Jackson Rhythm Nation Dance? No. Miss you much. Yeah. Yeah. That's the thing. She'll just bust that out out of fuck. Sorry. Out of nowhere. And she could really do it. You know what I mean? It's not like me. I could do like the peewee Herman dead, dead dead. A dead end. I think I'm all impressed.

Speaker 2:          01:04:38       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:04:38       Oh Damn. All impressive. Right. China's surveillance. Oh, Neil, you know, people are going to ask you to fucking Instagram that. I know it's not going to happen. No. Okay, I'm back. Sorry. The, uh, the batteries just died on this thing. Um, all right. We are, I think I'm well over an hour here at this point. I have to be, I don't really know where I'm at at this point. All right. Shyness. Surveillance, man. All right. If, if, uh, you want me to just do the rest of this because it seems like she's getting ready to, uh, run around here, so I don't, I just don't know if that's going to be annoying to people to hear go home. I but I. Dot. I love is I'm sitting talking about all this stuff, the doorbell to them as it is. Yeah. That's the one thing you got to remember. Your kid is adorable to you. Everybody. Everybody thinks the kids are adorable. Then after awhile it's just like, okay. Oh, okay. Okay. Um, China's surveillance, dear bill, Bunker Hill. I love it. I'm a software engineer. Makes sure she doesn't shut her hands in the door there. Um, oh, down like a ton of bricks. It is amazing that they always fall in there, but yeah. All right buddy.

Speaker 3:          01:05:52       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:05:53       All right, Cutie Pie. I'll see you in a few minutes. Bye Bye. Oh, all right. I'll see you lovely ladies out there. All right. I'm a software engineer and system integration specialists at a prominent firm in a major city. I won't stay my political affiliation because I know you hate that move as much as I do. Good. Let's get into it. I'm terrified that my children will have little to no privacy in their adult lives. Being in tech, I'm becoming aware of the capabilities and advances in surveillance systems and as an ordinary human being with the Internet, I've maintained an understanding that our government under both parties have been constantly expanding their surveillance reach and continue to lie to us about what information is being stored. Yeah, it's ridiculous. And all the major fucking news organizations don't say anything about it. They don't do anything to protect us. They just sit there fucking making money.

Speaker 1:          01:06:53       Uh, China isn't very different. Uh, it's definitely more aggressive and more intrusive. The biggest is what Snowden was trying to warn us about. We all left that guy twisted on the vine and everybody was afraid because they wrapped what this guy was doing and to trying to beat Isis. So then it was like, well, I can't say anything because then I don't support the troops and then I'm going to get the Dixie chicks fucking treatment. Um, that's, that's all that's all they're fucking doing right now. That just destroying people individually. Um, just snowed is a fucking hero as far as I'm concerned. God Damn fucking lunatics. It's like how much more do they need to know about? You just sat down at the airport, you go through fucking security. Then it's like you don't understand in that now go now, go through Tsa gotta answer all this shit and get fucking fingerprinted and now, now that line's clogged up. So now the next one, people will fucking stick in that goddamn retinas in there.

Speaker 3:          01:07:46       It's unbelievable.

Speaker 1:          01:07:48       All right. Drop your pants and spread your butt. Cheeks is going to be the next one. Don't get through the line fucking quicker. And people would do it because there'll be more convenient. All right. The biggest differences that they have the decency to not try and hide it or maybe you think it's better to be lied to? I don't know. Well, I think it's because China could just fucking, you know, I don't, as far as I know in mainland China, you're the level of rights that you have versus what you have over here. I think over here you have to lie because they don't have the right to do what they're doing. Probably, I dunno, this article lays out the way in which our government surveillance is going to be able to access everything in a Chinese citizens life, both at work and at home, um, in which government and our government, one of the most important advancements being made is not just the collection of data, but the sorting or of data and the ability to sift through billions of communications for specific content.

Speaker 1:          01:08:45       This is why the FBI and CIA have had information on terrorist activity, but had no way to access it if through all the bullshit. Yeah. So the thing is, so what people will say, well, as well as least as Lou, as long as I'm not out there trashing a, you know, saying I'm a Muslim, I won't have a problem, uh, back to my kids more. I, because this is the thing, they're going to use that to then access all this other shit as they always still as they always do. Um, back to my kids. Most government technology eventually makes it, makes its ways to the public. When my children are in their adult life, all of their previous years will be stored somewhere to create a case against them based on the person that they were and not who they've become. Jesus Christ. That last statement, there might be most intelligent thing anybody's ever sent in.

Speaker 1:          01:09:37       Um, I will send you guys, um, this, this link to this story and read it and it just be informed and know that you're going to be all right. All right. Cause I don't want to send all this doomsday shit that's gonna make you go into a depression, but you also do need to know. It would be nice if people knew what was going on and uh, I think like, uh, this is a time where people, I just feel like everybody wants to start speaking up like what are we doing? And not in an anti USA fucking way, but you know, at some point somebody has to kind of step up here. You know, I think we kind of need to look at the finances of how much is fucking non-ending war is costing us. And uh, at some point we're going to have to pay all of that back.

Speaker 1:          01:10:20       $700 billion a fucking year. I mean, I, I, we're really, we would really be a sad thing if 3,500 fucking jerk offs that train on a jungle gym were to bankrupt this great nation. They made some point. We do have to, there has to be a way to discuss that without somebody yelling at you saying you don't support the troops just to, you know, cause maybe they haven't worked out. Maybe there was a solution. It would be nice as a citizen who's paying ungodly taxes, who would like to see them go to some shit over here, like pup making public schools good again. You know, maybe get some people off the streets that need some help. You know, baldies shutter island, people fucking walking around. They used to have facilities that they could go to. You combine that with the fact that they can now go in and buy a bazooka and not have to wait longer than three fucking minutes and all of a sudden he started to have some problems.

Speaker 1:          01:11:15       You fucking call me mother fucker. Don't bring that up. Uh, why did I blame myself for that? You know, that's not true. I should sound like I've got to get a good, good, good corporation impression. You're clearly against the United States of America. Um, wife believes in ghosts. Oh Jesus, Dear Billy Burger basket. Uh, I love my wife dearly in on most topics we are in agreement, but recently something has come between us. She believes in ghosts and I do not. Oh Dude, fucking let it go. Who gives a shit? Okay. As long as she's not trying to talk to them and acting like Whoopi Goldberg and saying that they're entering her body. But even then if she does that, to just dedicate one of your rooms to that and just have her fucking make money off of other dopes that believe what she's doing is real anyways. I'm not so bothered by her belief. Sure. It's a bit Kooky, but she's free to do it and so it's not hurting anyone. All right. There you go. The problem is, is that she's offended that I don't believe in ghosts as well. Oh Gee, look at that. I gave you a lecture and you were already fucking, you were already where I was telling you to go. It's like, okay, you believe in ghosts. Good for you. But I don't fine.

Speaker 1:          01:12:26       Well, cross. Is there anything worse than cold tea? Sorry. Just started confident how to take a little swig there. Um, I stopped believing in ghosts around the same time. I stopped believing in Santa Claus and the Easter Bunny back when I was a kid. So when a full grown adult tells me they see spirits, I can't help but wonder if there's something wrong with them. Mentally. She is afraid to go to the restroom at a certain restaurant in our town because it's a story about it being haunted. She says the last time she went in there, she felt an Erie chill, but it's a draftee bathroom in a 90 year old bill building for Christ's sake. She also has this old photograph she took through a window at an abandoned mental hospital that she claimed shows a ghost face. When I look at it, I only saw blurry bullshit. I tried to be nice about it, but I think she felt like I was calling her stupid or crazy when I didn't see it, when I didn't see it too. I didn't want to lie about it besides, she would know if I was lying. Anyways, I don't know how to approach this topic without upsetting her. Do you have any advice for me? Yours truly, um, this guy left his fucking name. I don't know if this is a reference to somebody, uh, at a movie. Let me see.

Speaker 1:          01:13:41       Yes, this has gotta be somebody's, uh, this has to be a movie joke.

Speaker 2:          01:13:48       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:13:49       Oh, doctor Peter Venkman. Oh, okay. This was bill Murray's character and Ghostbusters. Okay. Hilarious. All right. Um, I don't know how to approach this topic without upsetting her. Do you have any advice for me? Yours truly Dr Peter Venkman? Uh, yeah, don't bring up these topics. Don't bring up the topic and uh, you know, I, I would just,

Speaker 1:          01:14:17       I would just be like, look, I get it. You believe in ghosts and I don't, uh, don't say it like that. Just feel like I respect the fact that you believe in ghosts and um, I don't, and if the tables were turned and there was something that I believed in and you didn't, I would respect the fact that you didn't, and a rather than do, you know, getting upset with you. Okay. You see ghosts. Evidently you are born with the power that I was not giving. So you should feel thankful for that, that you're able to see these things. I am a mere mortal. I'll don't say that cause then that's passive aggressive. I'm the worst. Something along those lines. It just say, listen, I love everything about you and we get along great. But I just feel like there's this tension about this that Eh, that you're trying to force me to feel something that I don't feel and I don't think that that's what you do to somebody you love. And I wouldn't do that to you. Okay. So come on over here and if there's not a ghost between us, could you give me a hug?

Speaker 1:          01:15:21       Some along those lines? All right, last one here. My sister's friend. Oh boy. Hi Bill. Hi Bill. You can't, I'm an 18 year olds from England and I need some advice. All right. You're pasty, crooked teeth dose around two months ago, one of my sister's childhood friends came to visit her for a weekend. They'd been friends since they were three and she moved five hours away when she was 12 so they barely see each other anymore. They were playing to go out on Saturday with a group of friends say, and I was planning on staying home alone. Well, my sister went to pick up a few of her friends to meet at our house. Me and her friends flirted a bit, but nothing major. We exchanged snapchats, et cetera. I love how that's flirting now, long, long story short, my sister's friend pretended to be ill and came home early so we could hook up. Dude, you are fucking crushing it. Your sister's bringing them home to, you know you have to go out. Good for you. The only thing was my sister was genuinely ill and also came home early around 30 minutes after her friend and she caught us in bed together. Well, what the fuck is she doing walking into your bedroom.

Speaker 2:          01:16:38       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:16:38       My sister got insanely angry and stormed out by you should said, hey, don't hate the player. Hate the game. And it just lit a cigarette. Oh my God. I think this is fucking funny. This is fucking hilarious, dude. Do you realize how hard you're crushing it? You're fucking at home. You're not even trying to get late. She just says her friends come over for the bullshit. Okay ladies, you ready to go out and in that moment, whatever the fuck you did made one of them, pretend be sick and come back and hook up with you. Dude, you're a fucking hero.

Speaker 5:          01:17:15       Okay?

Speaker 1:          01:17:16       There's no reason to get, oh, I don't care how mad you assistant gets. Just, I would just keep smiling and just be like, hey, I can't help it man. You know the ladies love me

Speaker 1:          01:17:27       sweetheart, sweetheart. I wasn't trying to hook up. I was at home. I was innocent. I can't help it. If women are attracted to me, I would just go totally fucking arrogant at the matter she get. I would just keep laughing and I would never take it seriously. Uh, my sister has suffered with depression and anxiety. I forget what, I just, I didn't see that part. My sister has suffered with depression and I'm so excited for you that I didn't even read this next book. She suffered with depression and anxiety for years. So whenever something like this happens, my family almost always sides with her. Oh, that's easy. Then you just divide and conquer with you, with your dad. Just be like, Dad, I can't help but I, I inherited your charisma. What do you, what do you want from me? She, I didn't go out with, she came home to me if it fell right in my lap. What was I supposed to do? What was I supposed to do?

Speaker 5:          01:18:26       Yeah,

Speaker 1:          01:18:27       they don't and he'll, I don't, I, there's no fucking way I get mad at my kid in the morning. I mean, he's mad because you're making her upset, but he's not mad at what you did. I'm guaranteed your dad's telling his friends at work.

Speaker 1:          01:18:39       It's fucking son of a bitch and you have to leave the fucking house to come to. They come in to him. Uh, in the morning she threatened to never talk to me again for what I did, but I said something along the lines of I feel a connection with her or some bullshit like that to calm my sister down. The thing was I didn't, but her friend did. Oh No. We started dating and after round two weeks I re I realized that I fucking hated this girl. She is generally stupid as shit. Yeah, dude, this is all good. This is all good stuff because you're learning lessons, which is supposed to in life, especially at 18. Okay. This whole thing started with a lie. Okay. And that you did to protect your sister's feeling. So you just got to come clean. You've got to dump the dummy and just tell her like, listen, I love you so much that I actually started dating somebody that is fucking stupid.

Speaker 1:          01:19:37       All right, I'm sorry you have the, then she'll get mad that you'll be like calling her friends stupid. Are you saying my friends is stupid? No, I'm saying that friend that is a friend of you is stupid. The other ones seem really smart and you know, tell all of them. I wouldn't mind if they fake six and came home and hooked up with them. All right. I said I fucking hate you. This girl, she's generally stupid as shit. My original plan was to pretend I was into her for a few months and then when I go to university,

Speaker 3:          01:20:09       uh,

Speaker 1:          01:20:11       in a few months I break up with her because of the long distance. Do it. Don't do that because you might break her heart. All right? But that's some dumb shit you do when you're 18. Uh, that way I'd say my relationship with my sister and, and mother and get rid of this stupid bitch. Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. Don't talk about women. You don't need to talk about him like that. Okay. Feel lucky that you, you know, you got a better brain than cheated. Yeah. Don't, don't play with people's feelings like that. All right? Cause I'm telling you right now that you, that if you're any sort of an actual human being, uh, breaking someone's heart, the guilt of that never fucking goes away. Um, however, I recently received news that my first choice university turned me down and my second choice was the only one that accepted me.

Speaker 1:          01:20:57       The problem is she lives 15 minutes away from my second choice university and now I don't know what to do. You got to come clean. I can't go through university hitched to a girl I fucking hate, but I can't afford to risk my relationship with my family for obvious reasons. Also, another girl who I think I generally may have a connection with recently broke up with a boyfriend of two years and I'm pretty sure that if I could, if I could, we would be dating right now. Uh, it also doesn't help that this girl is a nine out of 10 looking model and I'm probably a six and a half out of 10 at best. Thanks for you. Help you freckled Twat all right. Through this is what you got to learn. You're going to learn, uh, honesty here. All right? I'm fucking break up with that woman today. All right? And you have to come clean,

Speaker 3:          01:21:51       okay?

Speaker 1:          01:21:51       With everybody in your house and you have to say, you know, you have to put your foot down that your parents cannot be choosing. I would maybe I would have this conversation with your parents. They can't be choosing your sister over you straight across the board because of your sister's depression and anxiety issues. Okay. I don't know how severe they are. All right. If they're chemical, then yeah, that's a major problem. But you know, if she just needs to fucking, you know, get out of a funk, then I dunno. I Dunno where she is on the whole depression spectrum if that's the proper thing. But like you shouldn't have to be suffering like this, dude, you got to live your own fucking life, all right? Just live your life. Live your life, and when you live your life, sometimes people are going to get hard.

Speaker 3:          01:22:39       Okay,

Speaker 1:          01:22:40       all right, fuck that. Break up with this woman and go ask the other woman out. That's it. That's what the fuck you do and if anybody in your family has a problem with it, let them vent to you and all that stuff and just say, I'm sorry that I am doing what my heart is telling me to do. All right. I am not trying to hurt anybody in this family. Had I known that hooking up with that girl was going to cause this level of of drama, I wouldn't have done it. I regret that I did it. I actually felt so bad that actually fucking dated or for two weeks the whole time and it was like talking to a fucking chair. Say all this stuff nicely.

Speaker 2:          01:23:23       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:23:23       All right. There's a woman that I like, then I want to pursue and I'm going to do that, and if that's wrong, that God damn it, I don't want to be right and walk out,

Speaker 1:          01:23:35       okay, and don't let them hold your sister's fucking problems over your goddamn head because that's good. Look, we'll do what it's already doing. It's causing you to fucking date people you don't want to date. So then she's going to be depressed and you're going to be living this life of fucking misery because you didn't do what you wanted. Okay? Now, having said that, don't call women bitches, all right? Don't do that. I'm not saying don't call them out on this shit and stand your ground, but the don't don't have a do the name calling thing, all right? Because it's, it doesn't die. It gets you not only does it and it makes the other person not hear what your point is, then they can bring that up for the rest of your fucking relationship and God knows they're going to do it. All right? That's the fucking podcast. Oh, fuck yourself. I'll check in on you on Thursday. Bye Bye.
