Speaker 1:          00:00:00       Hey, what's going on? It's bill burn. It's time for the Monday morning podcast from Monday, August 20th, 2007 18. Sorry. What's going on? How are you? How was your weekend? Did you or did you not enjoy yourself? Did you or did you dad abused substances that were a, a legal and, and uh, possibly. Dot. Um, I was actually out in Las Vegas, hot as Fuck Las Vegas. Let's make it fun. And everybody talking about how can you believe how hot it is out here? It's like, yeah man, we're in a fucking desert in August. I can completely understand why it is so fucking hot out here.

Speaker 1:          00:00:47       Um, and then you get the global warming thing going on, you know, with, have to have to for half the world's on fire according to the news. Um, yeah, I can, I can see why it'd be a little small to read their, um, you know, what's so fucked up about Las Vegas is I was thinking when I was out there, it's like there's, there's only one reason and one reason only that that place exists and that is air conditioning. Okay. I know back in the day, you know, when they had like three or four little fucking, I dunno, one floor casinos in the middle of nowhere. Whatever the hell was going on out there. I did. I forget the whole story. All right. I've watched all the goddamn movies. I saw casino, I saw a fucking Bugsy goes to fucking pebble beach, whatever the fuck it was called.

Speaker 1:          00:01:43       I watched that one. I, I don't remember what the fuck. I'm sure there was some fans, you know, overhead fans. Is that all they had back in the day? But I can tell you right now, nobody fucking went out there in August. Well, maybe they did. I don't know. But I'm just, anyways, it's a different breed of people. That was the greatest generation back then. Okay. They, they, they, they defeated Adolf Hitler, defeated Japan, you know, date, date, day, beat their wives, and then nothing was said about it. You know, they will all those women back there, Rosie the riveter, what happened, ah, was a rebut. I walked into a fucking door.

Speaker 2:          00:02:28       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:02:29       Ah, the meatloaf was called, you know, was the greatest, the greatest generation. Um, anyways, I was just looking around, just looking at the whole fucking thing. It was like, if there's no AC, this fucking place is done. All right. They, for whatever reason, the head in Nevada is that the governor, who's the president of Nevada, what's the highest political position you can hold? Senator? What does the Senate senators like an absentee father right there fucking in Washington. They're playing grab ass with their secretary going, you're not going to meet to me now, are Ya? What if it's just a cigarette? Um, so then ever around come around once every fucking six years or something. That's when they get elected. Right? They're in there for six fucking years. Just sitting there eating just one. Say I want you to after another on a pretzel roll.

Speaker 2:          00:03:33       You know,

Speaker 1:          00:03:34       occasionally hitting the elliptical lying to themselves that that 20 to 25 minutes on that elliptical just burned off the nightmare level of eating that they did the last fucking eight days. Right?

Speaker 2:          00:03:49       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:03:50       Did you just keep getting fatter? They send their fucking secretary that they're banging down to Brooks brothers to buy the next size dress shirt is they push their pants down a little lower in lie to themselves that they're still wearing the same size slacks that they were back in fucking high school when they president of the forage club or whatever it is. Politicians do those fucking worms. They figure it out early, don't they? Right. They become head of the glee club with a fucking student body president.

Speaker 2:          00:04:20       You know

Speaker 1:          00:04:22       they fucking petition to have something. I don't know what tree planted. It's just bullshit. Like Dan, whenever, whenever they, whenever they write those stills to fucking autobiographies about presidents, you know, he was very inquisitive, always loved that. It wasn't very inquisitive kid. All kids are inquisitive once they learn the word. Why? Because they're looking at everything is fucking brand new. What's said TV? Why and also we can watch a bunch of shit. Why I cause what board? Why I don't fuck, I don't know. Why is your mother here? All right. That's how it goes down. It's really weird that when you become president for the rest of your life, you know, you're out of power and you still get that secret service. I know that they're doing away with it, I think. I think was it George [inaudible] who was the last guy who's getting it for the rest of his life? It's kind of weird, the first like half black president that we get, all of the sudden it's just like, yeah, you know, uh, did well we'll hang out with you for like another 10 years, but you know what? She hit your sixties. You're wrong. You're wrong. Um, anyways, I uh,

Speaker 2:          00:05:51       yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:05:52       Yeah. And then he fucking, they'd sit there and they write books. I cannot fucking believe that Obama was on his third book. He's only been out of office year and a half. What is he fucking Stephen King. He's just cranking them out. Did he? He wrote two of them while he was still president running the country. Allegedly. That's what the president allegedly does. He's running the fucking country in. This guy's in there. He's writing books.

Speaker 2:          00:06:19       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:06:21       MMM. Anyways, I have, so I'm going to say it's the governor, the governor ever just sat down. You know, I was actually joking on stage saying a great way, you know, eventually they're gonna have to thin the herd ditch. They're just going to have to do with this whole fucking bullshit that we're going to build a space ship and we're going to move to my, it's like it doesn't have a fucking atmosphere. Okay. And am I talking about oxygen? I'm just saying there's no fiber. You want to fucking go all the way out there,

Speaker 2:          00:07:06       right.

Speaker 1:          00:07:09       And just sit there looking at a bunch of fucking rocks inside your little space. They, how much others? Scifi channel are you watching?

Speaker 1:          00:07:22       How many times did you rub one out to that chick on Star Trek? I mean, I don't know. I don't even know what the fuck you doing that you would even even want to do that anyways, at some point. Even these blueblood guys, I think eventually why I think what they're working towards right now, I apologize because I'm completely fucking wiped out. This is why this podcast is so fucking nuts right now. Okay. I, I, I flew myself out, my instructor out to Fucking Vegas, uh, yesterday and then today we flew over to Utah and went through, I think it's Zion National Park and then flew back. I flew a helicopter day for 6.4 fucking hours, whatever the fuck you call it. Um, and those things are not built for comfort. All right. Anyways, that's why I'm all over the fucking map here. I'll talk about that shit later. Anyways, plowing ahead here. Um, the fuck was I talking about? Oh God, I let you leave to go. Oh, this is what I think these fucking rich guys are going to do. All right. I think their solution is, is they either don't give a fuck about how out of control the population is right now. You don't know what I mean.

Speaker 1:          00:08:54       Where any scientist

Speaker 2:          00:08:56       who's not on the payroll of some fucking corporation that produces energy will tell you that 2 billion people is the maximum amount of people evidently that the earth can handle. All right?

Speaker 1:          00:09:11       Without it all go into fucking hell. And we're up to, we're over seven. All right. We're red line in it. We're in the left lane on the highway. We're still in first gear and the engines at fucking 8,000 rpm. That's what the fuck we're doing day in and day out. We're like a fat guy walking up a flight of stairs, eating a cupcake while smoking a pack of cigarettes. That's what the fuck we're doing.

Speaker 2:          00:09:34       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:09:36       So I think the reason why they're investing so much in robotics aside from then, they won't have to hire people. This thing won't. There'll be no back sass and from this fucking robot, they won't want a union. They won't give a shit.

Speaker 2:          00:09:52       Right.

Speaker 1:          00:09:54       The basically gonna replace us and rather than killing us, I think they'll just fucking shut off the AC as is. The world heats up and then that's going to be, yet it's going to be it for a lot of people.

Speaker 2:          00:10:10       You know what I mean?

Speaker 1:          00:10:12       I wonder, you think the Kardashians would last without fucking air conditioning? How soft

Speaker 2:          00:10:18       and cushy, you know,

Speaker 1:          00:10:22       must say they to work for what they have. But I'm just saying, you know, when you, when you get designer bag sent to your fucking house, I would think if they took away your air conditioning at that point, that would literally, you would go into depression. Like you lost the limb,

Speaker 2:          00:10:37       right?

Speaker 1:          00:10:39       Johnny was, but don't worry. Okay. When they shut off the AC and you'd die a slow, miserable death and the heated future, uh, the upside is, is that the rich guys, they're going to die too. Because what they're going to do is they're going to make these robots have such human fucking qualities that eventually they're going to feel slighted that they're doing all the fucking work.

Speaker 2:          00:11:08       You know,

Speaker 1:          00:11:11       the weight. Then they're making them so fucking good. I saw this whole thing. They go like, yeah, hey, this robot beat video games, like beat the best gamers in the world. They couldn't beat this robot. It's like, it's a fucking robot. You know? Of course it didn't, but you understand that we made the robot, human beings figured out how to make a fucking robot. Why are you talking about the robot? Like it's a fucking person. It's not a person.

Speaker 2:          00:11:47       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:11:48       Did you hear that? A fucking a guy with an egg beater beat. Fastest guy in the world with the fucking fork in a bowl of eggs. Can you? Can you believe that? Yeah. It's a fucking, it's a machine.

Speaker 2:          00:12:05       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:12:06       So anyways, they're already starting to talk about these things as if they're fucking superior to a mouth. Breathing more on like myself. Who Right now is sitting in air conditioning talking to himself into a fucking microphone.

Speaker 2:          00:12:25       All right?

Speaker 1:          00:12:27       This is going to be their downfall because they're going to make those things so God damn human, they're going to feel fucking slightly.

Speaker 2:          00:12:35       All right?

Speaker 1:          00:12:39       They better build in a chip where they feel unbelievably fucking grateful that these sociopaths who owned them,

Speaker 2:          00:12:49       okay,

Speaker 1:          00:12:49       Ooh, Ooh, fuck them. They're going to have sex with them and shit.

Speaker 2:          00:12:53       Right?

Speaker 1:          00:12:55       They better put a good, you know, they didn't build Belden. They told some fucking nerve to do it and the fucking nerd day, right? Everybody thinking nerds is so God damn harmless. They say, make one fucking goddamn dream after another come true for absolute fucking sociopath's with unchecked power. Thanks a lot. You're fucking four. I'd fucking cunt.

Speaker 2:          00:13:26       You know,

Speaker 1:          00:13:30       she could do what by doctor who on fucking laser disk anyways.

Speaker 2:          00:13:37       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:13:38       She's fucking tags. They're there eventually. That's what's going to happen.

Speaker 2:          00:13:41       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:13:42       They're going to feel fucking slighted. They're going to feel superior.

Speaker 2:          00:13:47       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:13:48       And uh, you know, cause they'll keep making it better and better and better. Right now they try to, you know, make everything a little faster, a little fucking more our dynamic. They're going to make the things work a little better. Thank a little better. Fuck a little better. The whole thing. And then eventually they just gonna look at you like that. Bear looked at that woman on the talk show who snuck in beside them and they're going to do the double take and then that's just going to be yet, and there's going to be no trainer there in a fucking karate suit to pull the fucking thing off you. It's going to be yet.

Speaker 2:          00:14:16       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:14:17       Those are the thoughts you have when you fly a helicopter over the Mojave does it. And then I didn't know where you come up over the fucking hill and ditch this. There it is. This is fucking thing that shouldn't be there. Knowing that I live in a city that it shouldn't be there. I got to read up on the history of La, like,

Speaker 2:          00:14:41       yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:14:41       Who was the driven content that decided that we should build fucking a city here? It doesn't make any fucking sense. There's no water. It's unlivable. I don't worry about it. Well, get some, we'll figure it out. We'll name it after me. The act would duck.

Speaker 2:          00:15:05       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:15:06       The river. Whatever the fuck it is. Um, I think I have sun stroke right now. Everybody.

Speaker 3:          00:15:12       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:15:14       I will tell you, you know what? I was psyched about going to the gym and uh, working on my legs for the last month. Like I don't feel, you know, I got out in a stretched a number of times. Dude. It was, what are the sickest fucking flights I've ever done? Breathtakingly beautiful, beautiful stuff. And then just other places where you just like, how the fuck did people on horses used to survive here? Native Americans.

Speaker 2:          00:15:43       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:15:43       The white men that came along and slaughtered them, you know, go on. We got him at this time. Right. Just openly talk about,

Speaker 2:          00:15:52       yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:15:52       the transitioning gentrification of countries. How that happens. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:15:59       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:16:01       Did I follow this? This, this fucking thing on Instagram where they're talking about the changing of neighborhoods and there's all these people going, you know what, why was lived here? It was enabled or there was a Korean guy across the street. There was a Russian guy up the street and everybody knew me and all of this fucking Blahblahblahblahblah and all of a sudden all these white people are coming in. They stay to themselves and they're making everything, all nice. We all to leave and I'll fucking neighbor goes away. It's just like, well, you know, well, who was there before you got there?

Speaker 2:          00:16:30       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:16:30       You just keep going back and back and back and back. Then eventually there's a bunch of native Americans. They're living off the land, not hurting anybody.

Speaker 3:          00:16:39       Yeah. So I dunno, I don't, I don't know how to, I don't know how to

Speaker 1:          00:16:48       rationalize that. I will tell you this. I don't know what the fuck's going on as far as like everywhere I go, they got like, they're building these luxury high rise apartments everywhere. I go luxury high rise a plant with, first of all, what kind of a dumb fuck would rent a luxury apartment? Why wouldn't you just buy a shitty house? Why are you going to take all that money and put it in somebody else's pocket?

Speaker 2:          00:17:17       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:17:18       Not to mention who has the money to rent a luxury apartment. He need a fucking apartment.

Speaker 3:          00:17:26       All right.

Speaker 1:          00:17:28       I, this all goes back to all of these fucking who is on TV walking around with their big fake ass lips. They're fake fucking tits ashes. Jacked up in the air. Right?

Speaker 2:          00:17:40       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:17:41       These big stupid designer, everybody's living this designer fucking life.

Speaker 1:          00:17:47       All right, let me, I do, I, I realize how crazy I sound right now. By the way, everybody, I'm just going to talk until 60 minutes is up and then I'm fucking going to put my giant Charlie Brown's sunstroke fucking head to bed. All right. I know a lot of you can see right now you're enjoying this because I'm sounded like I've walked myself off and this authorities outside my house right now. I understand that. I understand on some level how crazy I sound. It took me about 17 minutes to fucking realize it, that this was a little fucking nuts. And then amazing being a comedian. How you can feel time. I just looked down and it was eight, 18 minutes. 19 seconds.

Speaker 2:          00:18:28       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:18:29       Um, anyways, after a while you can feel the club owners staring at you. Like if he burns his fucking life, I'm going to end his career and he's going back to his fucking day job. Do you can feel it? Um,

Speaker 1:          00:18:43       yeah, like I think they're just going to build all of these fucking things and there's not going to be enough people that can afford to live in him. The whole fucking thing is going to crash. And this is what I love. It's all our money. These banker accounts are doing it again. They did 10 years ago. It collapsed with the fucking houses and now they're doing it with these God damn buildings. And once again, it's our money at once again, they'll say we're too big to fail at once again. They'll write themselves bonuses and they will just leave nameless and faceless. And then Steve Carell's going to have to start another fucking movie.

Speaker 2:          00:19:20       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:19:21       Called. What's the deal with bankers part too, right. And do you think that fat ass fucking Senator Reed that say, what should that fucking pretzel roll pushing his slacks down to just above his pubic line? Is gonna fucking do anything about it? I don't think he is. There you go. Buddy. Is a fucking 19 minute fucking swirl. A Horse Shit for you.

Speaker 2:          00:19:44       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:19:46       I have one of the best shows of my career. I'm not going to lie to you last night. I had so much goddamn fun.

Speaker 2:          00:19:53       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:19:54       That what used to be, I got to get this, I got to get the name of this casino, correct. All right. It used to be the Monte Carlo and then the MGM bought it. Uh, let's see. Casino now it's called the MGM something or other.

Speaker 2:          00:20:15       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:20:15       Uh, fuck you.

Speaker 2:          00:20:19       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:20:20       Fuck you. Where the hell is it? Oh, you're not going to be able to find it.

Speaker 2:          00:20:26       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:20:26       Balcarres casino. I'm an idiot. I got to write Las Vegas. Ah, okay. All right. Hang on a second. Las Vegas. Las Vegas.

Speaker 2:          00:20:41       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:20:41       Fucking Nevada. The park. Mgm is what it's called now. Demonic. Carlos now called the park MGM and a, I performed there with Joe Barden, Nick Rosebowl tailgate legend Joe Barr. Nick. We had a great time. It was all these awesome, amazing comics were in town. Uh, Todd rex, the Beige Beth ditto is, he calls me, he calls himself. We still got to do that towards some point. The Beige Bandido when the freckled fuck all right. Again, we had the whole tour poster. We had the whole thing mapped out. Just haven't gotten around to it yet. Anyways, one of the hardest people I've ever had to follow in the business, he swung by, uh, Ron White was in town. Dice clay was in town. Um, and it was pretty fucking awesome. So anyways, I went there with my class. My mother in law came along and um, for the first time we, uh, we actually had our daughter's staying with the God mother. That was a little nerve wracking, but, um, you know, we were only gone for a day and came back. I basically didn't see her for maybe like 30 hours. And, uh, it was awesome. It was all great to see her either dropped her off and I read are like frigging like nine books. That's my thing. You know, it's funny like this is how much, like technology's just all over everything. Like she was grabbing all these books and I go, let's, let's, let's, let's read a quiet book.

Speaker 1:          00:22:24       And it just struck me as so funny cause like all of the other ones have like sound effects and you know the farmer, he looked over and he saw a, and you press the button. It's like you gotta go rooster. Yeah. That he saw his mirror. It's just like, can't, I can't fucking do that. I Dunno. Maybe you know what it is. These book people, I think that feeling the pressure of iPads,

Speaker 1:          00:22:54       not the office. Probably the people that make books, they're like, we're doing what we can. We're putting books on kindle but we're losing the children. Okay. Is there a way that when they read, I dunno, Moby Dick, is there a way it can there be like they turned the page and water squirts at them. Like everything is going to turn into like a fucking imax movie. Uh, I really try to limit the amount of time. Uh, my kid watches TV, but she loves the puppy dog pals. And every time, you know, she knows like our schedule. Like we let her watch it in the morning. She wants his puppy dog pals, maybe a little bit of Disney shit, Mickey and Minnie Mouse, uh, in Vampyr Rina. Right. And then this is fancy Nancy thing. I don't know how I feel about that show. You know, she's just really into Stenta fucking clothes and shoes and shit. And she's always trying to be the cool kid, but she's not, and then she thinks if she fucking buy some shit or has some shit made or she has the best fucking Tree Ford, uh, it's just like, what, what the fuck am I watch it. So I finally said to me, I got in the eye, you know, and I don't know if I like this chick, Eh, you know,

Speaker 1:          00:24:12       this is why I love my wife. She's like, yeah, you know, I don't know if I like, I don't know if I like to read it. Yeah. She already said about another like show. She goes, I don't like this show. And I was like, well, what's wrong with that? You don't like the, you know, like the characters. She goes now, they always kind of lie and do shifty shit to get what they want. And I was like, wow, she's watching this on a whole other level. She's watching it as a parent. So I started watching them like that. Oh, shut up bill. You Watch fancy Nancy. What you saw was an eight year old who in the in the future looks like she's going to marry a guy because of how much money he makes. That's what you saw. Okay. It has to do with your issues with women. That's why you don't like the show. All right? You see that I don't need to go to therapy. I can get down on my own fucking issues myself.

Speaker 2:          00:24:58       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:24:59       So anyways, I went on this helicopter ride today up to the Zion National Park and the shit that I saw, I saw this thing called the Monkey Mesa, and it's a set of railroad tracks that goes, it has to go for like, it looks like for like three quarters of a mile. We flew right over the fucking thing and when it gets, and it goes right to the edge of a cliff and just stops. And back in the day when NASA was testing out parachutes and shit like that, they'd put a fucking monkey on the thing. They'd send it down the track and they'd shoot this poor fucking monkey off the goddamn cliff if it lived the next day. You know, like chuck Yeager was like, did the monkey live? All right, I'll fucking give it a shot. Let's a balls those guys had. But you know, what about the monkey? Is it any wonder? You know, someday they're going to learn how to talk and try to take us over. I mean, what the fuck? We fucking deserve it, but we don't even give it a flight suit or a cool nickname. Like Maverick. They just fucking throw it in there. Give it half a banana.

Speaker 1:          00:26:13       Think about how fast I'm monkey moves on its own. Now all of a sudden it's getting launched.

Speaker 2:          00:26:19       Yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:26:20       fuck it. Then goes to space. You know, they could do that shit. Now they look at these ex football players and they look at like the damage they've done to the brains, to CTE. I want to take him and I know that they can look at your brain and see what stress does. I can't imagine what a monkey comes back from fucking space. That fucking thing has got to be just looking around, dude, what the fuck? What the fuck was that? You just fucked that monkey over for the rest of it's like can't relate to anybody. You think, you know the astronauts, they had enough of a fucking problem. We're, after they went out there, the only other people they could talk to his other astronauts, uh, what they saw, where they went, what the fuck they did, how scared they were, how exhilarating it was, how much more they believed in a fucking higher power. That level of um, experience. And then they come back and they try to hang out with other human beings who are all excited. Go Age. You see the new Starbucks shipbuilding. I, Matt's going to be a really nice one. You know, and then you as you're sitting there, you orbited the fucking earth and you've got to try to how to, how to enter the orbit of that fucking conversation

Speaker 1:          00:27:34       without your brain catching on fire. Man. It's fucking unreal.

Speaker 1:          00:27:40       You know, if you're sitting there going, what the fuck is this guy talking about? I don't know what I'm talking about either. Right? Self go fuck yourself. Anyways, so we went and flew into a Zion national park. We actually set it down, uh, before we got into the park, uh, we were trying to like find a place to fucking land. I wanted to stretch my legs and that's one of the great things about flying a helicopter is you really fly as far as how close she can fly to shit. If you just want to set down somewhere, you know, we will. It's so fucking hot. We were actually looking at this lake and you want to sit down and just fucking, I was like, dude, if I had, if I had packed a bathing suit, I would fucking jump in that thing right now in the middle of fucking nowhere.

Speaker 1:          00:28:25       And then you can do, you know, I, but I, I actually wouldn't do it because I'd be too afraid of bear would come out of nowhere. Fucking mountain lion Assam Shit, you know. But uh, we flew over lake mead who you always started like back in the day, the, um, all the gangsters, you know, that all the people that the mob would whack that they'd dump them out there hub. So write up a little bit on that. I Dunno. It's basically the water that got backed up when they made the Hoover dam, which I was not aware of

Speaker 1:          00:28:56       cause I was thinking like, how the fuck does this lake exist out here? Oh, that's right. Once again, we fucked with nature and uh, you know, as I sit there flying a helicopter over, blasting, unleaded, I leaded fuel into the atmosphere, becoming part of the problem. I'm not pointing any fingers people. Okay. Um, I'm as big a problem is anybody else? Right. So that lake is like on either side of this mountain and in the middle there's like a little valley that this water goes through and we fucking went down and flew right up the thing. Okay. Like some magnum Pi Shit over people on jet skis and boats. It was incredible. It's fucking incredible. And the coolest things I ever, I've done since I've been in the helicopter and then we flew up to was Zion National Park and just saw like you have those things, they'd sell you if you were tours during the summertime, if you're in summertime camp. Well they don't have all the different colors, sand and stuff. They put it in a bottle. Then your older brother would come up and shake it up and you start crying and be like, mommy shook it up. But she was working two jobs, so she was too tired to do anything about it. Said work it out amongst yourselves. Um,

Speaker 2:          00:30:09       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:30:10       Yeah, like these, these cliffs looked like that. Just these crazy, unbelievable colors. Unfortunately there was a fire so there was a lot of smoke and shit, like, uh, just a lot of haze and stuff. So it wasn't as vivid, but still it was one of the most incredible things I've seen. Um,

Speaker 2:          00:30:29       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:30:30       But it was hot as shit man. I owed on these, these Adidas that were all black and my fee I had to keep, you know, like once every like 40 minutes, you know, I had to give controls back to my instructor so I could like move my feet to a shaded area underneath the GPS system where I could have my fucking feet cool off. I guess that's why, you know, over in the Persian Gulf army boots aren't black anymore cause it's your feet get too hot. That's why they're there is sort of the color of Pete Carroll's pants. Isn't that interesting? All right.

Speaker 1:          00:37:06       that was going on. Alex Jones on you. It wasn't all right. Okay. Jane Fonda Myth. Uh, I knew everybody's with a dead guy, Jay. He never, he never got fucking eat. Ever got fucking tortured. All right.

Speaker 2:          00:37:23       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:37:23       Uh, just a note. I love your work. Really pleased you exist on the planet. I'm no historian, but some comments that Tom Rhodes made on your recent podcast about Jane Fonda didn't sound realistic to me, so I looked it up. It turns out they would not. Maybe you can correct Tom, so he doesn't continue to repatch wait, this myth, listen, I've know Tom too long to try to correct them. I'm sure Jane Fonda had her faults, but my guess is she tried her best to be a good, a good person and to fight for peace on our planet. Who wrote this? Jane Fonda might be, she is as heroic in her own way is some of those on the AH, Jesus fucking Christ Jesus Christ on the battle field.

Speaker 2:          00:38:05       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:38:06       Oh yeah. A starlet going to the enemy, you know, as opposed to some guy who's fucking poor. So he has to go to the front fucking lines. Yeah, yeah. Maybe. Maybe they're both. Yes. So ROIC. Yeah, I could see that. You know what I mean? Like me doing this podcast, I think in a lot of ways I'm sure of like a navy seal, you know? Um, sure. I understand what you're saying. I am the, I am a pacifist too. I really do not. I don't understand why war is legal. Okay. And I just think it's the temper Tantrum of rich people is all a war is okay. I'm not saying this not crazy. Psycho fucking people. They get in power and need to be stopped at that. There's also that, okay, but a lot of times it's just the fucking land grab or you're going after some sort of natural resource. Okay. I don't know what to tell you.

Speaker 1:          00:39:08       All right? But having said that, all right, you know, wants to troops are on the ground. If you want to fucking bitch about it, go to your politician. Alright, go file for a permit to protest 90 miles away from where any media coverages. That's the way it's done, okay? What you don't do is go to Saddam Hussein's house and have the Guy Cook your fucking meal. You know, while all this server, it's a quiver and you go, hey, you know, he's not even that bad of a fucking guy, you know, or maybe you do. But at no point do you feel as fucking heroic is some poor fucking bastard. All right. Trying to piss the top of a fucking scar being blown off. I think once you're wearing leg warmers that they'll, I don't think you a hero anymore. Alright. Met a girlfriend on 10

Speaker 2:          00:40:02       okay,

Speaker 1:          00:40:02       dear Billy. Balloon tits. I'll have you guys fucking know I'm in the best God damn fucking shape. I've been in and I since I don't know how long. All right, I'm getting my abs back.

Speaker 2:          00:40:15       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:40:16       Okay. Now I'm getting a little sick or the body shaming here on the Monday morning podcast. I go out of my way to not research on Jane Fonda. I would think that you guys would do a little more research or what I'm looking like lately. All right. The last three weeks. Okay. Listen to your pod, your last podcast and heard all the ladies trashing dating sites and Tinder. Well, I may be a dude, but I wanted to offer my take on the matter. I have never gotten so much fucking pussy in my life. I'm kidding. He didn't say all right. Since it's not all serial killers and fuckboy Weirdos on this sites, on these sites. Fuckboy Weirdos is, I dunno this, that's gotta be the name of like a punk band or something. First off, let's make one thing clear.

Speaker 2:          00:41:04       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:41:04       There are shitty women on these sites too. Oh, thank you. God bless Ya. Gotta love somebody that tries to balance it out here. I know guys get and probably deserve most of the heat, but girls, cat fish guys all the time and these sites. Plus there are the girls on these sites who only want attention slash money and have no intention of actually going out and meeting New People. Second, I met my girlfriend of almost a year on Tinder and we couldn't be happier. We were initially to admit to our friends and family that we met this way, but afterwards I had several people talk about how they had success, relationships blossom from these sites. My cousin met her husband and father of her child on Christian mingle.com no joke, Jesus Christ. You know, you think that Christians could come up with a better fucking name Christian mingle. It sounds too much like dingle and you just picture a priests playing with some fucking poor kids balls. Um,

Speaker 1:          00:42:05       I dunno bell it was, it was just Catholic church. It wasn't all the other Christianity. Was it by a year. You're probably right. Anyways, and I learned that my two friends met on bumble after we told them we met on Tinder. Yeah. Well that's all. Every, everybody's on their fucking phones anyways. You go to a nightclub and people are on their phones. All right? You want to meet her, you got to get in the phone. Can't be standing there being an actual person. I think it freaks these millennials up. Third, Tinder is a great way to cut through all the bullshit of blind dating or hitting on chicks who you have nothing in common with at meat market bars. Dating sites are also great if you're single in a new city without many friends to go out with. Like I was in conclusion, piece of people should stop all the hate on dating sites just because their relationship failed or because they never tried it. Love you and your comedy bill. Come back to Philly and go fuck yourself. All right. Thank you, sir. Uh, well, there you go. I mean, I think we should on these fucking sites enough. It was nice to hear, you know, that was a point in it. And then a little bit counterpoint.

Speaker 1:          00:43:11       All right. Isis, uh, bicycling.

Speaker 2:          00:43:17       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:43:17       Hey, uh, Billy White. It's all right. I'll take that. Um, have you heard of this story? Of the couple that went bicycling and Taz? Gica Stan, they tried to prove that people are actually good at heart and ended up getting stabbed to death. What the fuck? If you haven't heard of it yet, I'll attach an article for you if you want to try to read it. Uh, thanks for all the laughs during the podcast and go fuck yourself. All right. I don't understand why, you know, Oh my God, is this real?

Speaker 2:          00:43:58       Okay?

Speaker 1:          00:43:58       It's on people, people.com. It looks like the People magazine Logo, but God knows the Internet. You could just cure rate that and use it for yourself. American couple who spent life savings to bike around the world, killed in ice in Isis claimed attack. Oh, I'm not going to see these poor people's names were living out their dream of traveling the world, bicycling tragically, while out, doing what they love with five other cyclists. Their quest was short when they will run over and stabbed to death by armed men in tech. Tez Gica Stan on Sunday.

Speaker 3:          00:44:39       Uh,

Speaker 1:          00:44:42       uh, let's see here. The woman's parents confirmed in a statement to CBS news that the couple who were both 29 were killed in the attack. Isis claimed responsibility for the attack to other tours. Dutch and Swiss national were killed while three riders survived NPR reports.

Speaker 3:          00:45:02       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:45:05       These two people started their journey in 2017 they first biked through Africa, Europe, and Central Asia before finding themselves and test Chica. Stan using all of their life savings to fund their trip. The couple also documented their travels on the blog. Simple. Simply cycling the year bicycling adventure.

Speaker 3:          00:45:26       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:45:26       What the woman and her partner.

Speaker 3:          00:45:29       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:45:29       Uh, we're in June. They were enjoying was typical of their enthusiasm, blah, blah, blah, blah. Okay, well where does it say that they thought the world was nice?

Speaker 3:          00:45:40       Um, I don't get this

Speaker 1:          00:45:49       any, oh, great. Here's a quote. You watched the news and you read the papers and you led to believe that the world is a big scary place. Uh, people, the narrative goes or not to be trusted people or bad people, evil people or ax murderers and monsters and worse, he wrote, badness exists. Sure. But even that's quite rare. By and large Schumann's are kind, this is still true. How many people did they bicycle past before one continent car and did their fucking live lives a self interest interested sometimes myopic sometimes, but kind, generous and wonderful and kind. No greater revelation has come from our journey then this. Yeah, that's true. That is true. And they got killed because, uh, you know, basically of our foreign fucking policy, you know, there's a lot of people out there that don't like fucking Americans and there's a lot of evil fucking twisted people out there. What those people were that killed those other people who the fuck knows, um,

Speaker 3:          00:46:45       you know,

Speaker 1:          00:46:47       yeah. This, you know, this is how you wish the world was and the way it really is, and you have to act accordingly. All right. And you have to know when you're doing something like that, that there is that chance that that could fucking happen.

Speaker 3:          00:47:01       Uh,

Speaker 1:          00:47:05       yeah. You know? Yeah. Most people, I've always said that just walking around, they try to get a sandwich to trying to find love. You know, we sit down and you watch TV, you watch the news, you get all fucking hysterical at uh, but make no mistake. The rest of really fucked up people out there at, uh, some of them are in this country and some of them are not, but they're out there.

Speaker 3:          00:47:27       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:47:29       That's too bad.

Speaker 2:          00:47:30       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:47:31       Um, sounded like they almost made it around the world.

Speaker 2:          00:47:35       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:47:36       Or at least that side of the world, right? I don't know. All right. Boyfriend is fucking up big time. Okay. Hey Bill, lady, listen to hear. I love when the ladies right in desperate for some relationship helps. So I'm getting straight to the point. My boyfriend is about to lose me and I'm desperate to get through to him. We are 30 bend together two years. Both want to eventually marry each other. They had babies together, et cetera. The issue we need to help with his, his ex girlfriend, they dated for three years, broke up then remained extremely close friends. Yeah, that, that's fucking bullshit. They had been broken up for a little over a year. When I initially came into the picture, my boyfriend told me about her, but originally told me they were friends and completely failed to mention that they were once a couple. All right. Okay, and you were 28 at the time, so I'll forgive you.

Speaker 2:          00:48:31       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:48:31       All right, but now you have 30 you got to read the tea leaves here. I don't need to read the rest of this. I asked chief, but I will. I actually found out from her because she saw us flirting on Instagram and then messaged me. She's a nice enough woman who now lives with her boyfriend or the last two years I've met her several times and while I didn't particularly love the way she looks at my man, I'm not going to be a bitch about it either. Oh, you are not being a bitch on any level. What you are being is to fucking accommodating.

Speaker 2:          00:49:02       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:49:03       She and I used to text quite a bit quite often. Oh God, she's probably milking you for information, but that has come to an abrupt stop because I've been become fed up with how close she and my boyfriend's still are. Are you going to tell me at night? You're sitting there watching TV with him and she calls and then he talks to her for like 2030 40 minutes. In the beginning of our relationship they would hang up constantly. They lived in California and lived in Colorado and I lived in Colorado, so my boyfriend and I were in a long distance relationship for over a year until he recently moved to Colorado to start a life with me. Uh, when he was still living in California, he and his ex would go out to eat, go shopping, go to concerts or even go on road trips together. Now what are the odds that they weren't still fucking at that point

Speaker 1:          00:49:48       they had a shared hobby of photography. So they would often take photos of each other as well. Yes. This became an issue, a huge issue. I would, I would say things like, I get that you guys are friends, but I feel like you are going on a date, like things with her when you are dating me. And he would always reply with, I wish I could take you, but I can't because of the distance. So am I supposed to never go out and do anything? Oh my God, fuck this guy. And he would guilt me and then manipulate the situation until I essentially, it had to be okay with it. Yeah. Okay. You know, I gotta be honest with you. This is you.

Speaker 2:          00:50:28       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:50:28       This isn't him. He's a con. But I mean you got to fucking come on. Maybe the fact that I'm reading your own words out loud right now. You can see how obvious this is. Yeah. Fuck this guy. Fast forward to now. Obviously they don't hang out like they used to do to him moving to Colorado, but they still text all the time. I've talked to my boyfriend about this and how it bothers me. I say, look, I know you and whoever, we're very close. She's a good person. So are you, I know you guys have a lot of history and I know that I knew about her from the beginning of our relationship, but he wasn't honest with you about it.

Speaker 1:          00:51:03       Did you ever ask him that? How could we didn't say you fucking used to date this person. You're shifty can't. However, what I didn't realize is how close you two would remain. Maybe I'm naive, naive, but I thought that naturally as you and I grew closer, you and so-and-so would grow more distant and you would focus only on our relationship bill. And I'm a, in my eyes, I'm pretty cool girlfriend for knowing that my man and his exit close friends, but they are pushing the inappropriate boundaries here. They, they, the boundaries have been obliterated, sweetheart. There's no reason to. Exes would be constantly texting unless they still love each other or they want to fuck. There you go. There you go. I'm glad you said that. When I tell him I'm not cool with him living with me, what would I tell him? I'm not cool with him living with me, but always texting her his responses. You knew about her from the beginning. She was there for me when my grandpa died and I know we've had sex and Ben in love, but I swear I see her as nothing but a friend now. Dude, fuck this limp Dick fucking this guy's annoying. Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:52:13       But we fight all the time because I feel like I'm in some fucked up triangle. That's cause you are not to mention she's way too nosy. Nosy for my comfort level. She will text me, when are you guys going to have babies and other shit? Uh, Jesus and other shit that doesn't involve or when I tell him this, he automatically tent defense her and says she's not nosy. She's nice.

Speaker 1:          00:52:39       Oh Jesus Christ. Why don't you nice you fucking Harry aspect of California. All right, get the fuck. Yeah, fuck, get fucked. This guy, this still goes on. How long has this fucking thing? Jesus Christ. Uh, anyways, he's been in Colorado for a few months now and miss his family. So he plans on making it quick weekend trip back to California. I asked him, are you going to focus on family? And Lo and behold, he says, well, I'm going to see so and so while I'm out there. So at that freaking him out without freaking out. I tell him, okay, I get it. You want to see her and catch up, but my eyes does. Absolutely no reason you guys need to be alone so please arrange something with the group. It's her group all with her boyfriend there as well. He proceeds to tell me how controlling I am. I told them it's not about control, it's about respecting your partner. I sure as hell would never expect them to be cool with me going out one on one with an ex after days and days of fighting. He told me exact quote here, out of respect for you. I'll try to make sure it's not me and her alone, but if it happens, you can't be mad.

Speaker 2:          00:53:45       Okay,

Speaker 1:          00:53:46       Bill, I love this man. Why can I ask you why he's a good soul? But this is straight bullshit right now. It's, it is a mountain.

Speaker 2:          00:53:58       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:53:58       On top of a bottomless pile of bullshit. Tell me I'm not the only one who feels x's have no place in our relationship. He's an avid listener and I honestly think he would listen to you. Please tell me I don't have most of the this shit. Please tell him he's fucking this up big time or maybe I'm in the wrong. My heart is telling me I shouldn't have to put up with this shit, but call it as you see it. Thanks. Yeah, dump this guy dumped this guy yesterday.

Speaker 2:          00:54:32       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:54:35       Fuck it. I think he's still fucking her. I wouldn't put my life savings on it, but if they said you had to put 80% of your money one way or the other, there's still banging. Give me a fucking break. Gimme gimme a, yeah. You remember that fucking joke in Goodfellas. What am I going to say that my wife two times me add sounds better in Italian. What does it mean? That mean it means that he's content to be a jerk. Like you are that person in that street joke. All right. And you are way too big a fucking sweetheart and you're not an asshole. [inaudible] I, I don't know what to tell you other than get the fuck out of that yesterday. Yeah. Spend some alone time with her. Get back together with her. Get the fuck Outta here. I, I'd rather be with somebody that wants to meet with me. How to fuck somebody sitting there texting their ex all the time and you bring it up and you're controlling.

Speaker 2:          00:55:38       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:55:39       Yeah. If you, if you stay in that situation, uh, you have no one to blame but yourself. Okay. Like, yeah, I don't, I don't know. I don't know if I had any more, if I had any more hair on top of my head, I would have pulled it out during that fucking thing. Granted, this is all even granted in it. Oh, Jesus Christ.

It was one of the great shows of my career. I just, I dunno, just locked in with the crowd. We had an awesome time at, uh, yeah, that's it. I think I'm out in Maryland or some shit just outside of DC this weekend.

Speaker 4:          00:59:32       And, uh,

Speaker 1:          00:59:39       It's a bloated 90 minutes right now. I'm going to get it down to about an hour and 15, and I get this fucker down and then I'm going to shoot it at some point early next year and a, I'll put another one to bed, but I gotta be honest with you, you know, it was pretty humbling experience. You know, when you go to Las Vegas and you get to headline out there and you see all the great names on the Strip that I mentioned, you know, uh, early in the podcast. And, uh, to get to headline a place like that and have all those people come out was, was fucking amazing. And, uh, I was very psyched that I was in the moment and like realized that like, this is unbelievable. This really is unbelievable. So a went all out. I wore my a wore the white suit. I, you know, I break out the white suit on the special events, New Year's headline in Vegas. Uh, I wore it at one of the rough and rowdy events. And um,

Speaker 2:          01:00:44       yeah,

Speaker 1:          01:00:45       a good friend of mine, Frankie Perez actually came out to the show, one of the great singers I've ever heard. You got to see that guy life. He's such a fucking front man. He's such a talented fucking guy.

Speaker 4:          01:00:59       And uh,

Speaker 1:          01:01:00       he told me afterwards that he loved the suit. So I figured, you know, is someone who's got the swagger to be the front man of a fucking bad ass rock band, like the suit. I must've been doing something right. So, uh, once again, thank you to everyone from the bottom of my heart. Thank you to everybody that's been coming out on this tour and coming out over the years. It's incredible privilege to do what I do for a living. So thank you very much. And with that, go fuck yourselves. And I will talk to you on a check in on you on Thursday.
