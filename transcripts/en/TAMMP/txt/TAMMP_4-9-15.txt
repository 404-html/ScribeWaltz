The other day I was talking to I was talking to somebody about finance and he had heard that, you know, I don't let anybody fucking handle my money. You know, cause I watched behind the music and that's the first thing. The first thing you'd do if you want people to fucking steal from you is let them handle your money. The second thing you do is you give them power of attorney, which means they can sign your name, which means they're essentially you. They can legally sign your name. Hi, my name is Frank Gifford. I'm also Frank Gifford. I don't remember you being on the giants. Well fuck you. I got a piece of paper says I did. Well, at least on the check. Why did I pick Frank Gifford? I Dunno.

Speaker 1:          03:21          You know what I mean? When was the last time we met a schizophrenia? Eight year old. It never happens. Okay. Somewhere around 30, all of a sudden, you know, the person is over in the corner talking to other people. It happens later in life. Okay. And you, and you can take that to the bank because, uh, I am not in the medical field. I'm just repeating shit that I heard. You don't know what's going to happen. They go to a door, so they start smoking crack. They go to a fucking rave. You know, they do ecstasy. They banked some chick way out of their fucking league. Next thing you know, they're doing that, right.

Speaker 2:          03:49          Okay.

Speaker 1:          03:49          This is fucked up. I don't trust anybody who drives a white car, not like a fucking Camry. Anybody who drives a white Mercedes Benz or white BMW. It's a nice car. And the car is white scumbag, straight across the fucking board. Scumbag. All right. When was the last time you saw a class act getting out of a white Mercedes? A White Ferrari? You know what I mean? Well, for Aria gets you a little fuck what have, I mean, you know what I'm saying?

Speaker 2:          04:23          Okay.

Speaker 1:          04:24          Fucking tacky. All right. People have, oh, anybody has a white leather couch? You know, just fucking, just bill, you know, I forgot something in my car and just leave scumbag. All right?

Speaker 2:          04:38          Okay.

Speaker 1:          04:38          Um, you know, I'm actually creating new stereotypes on this one. I kind of like it. Um, well built in. What color car do you trust? Uh, somebody as a brown car. They never gonna steal from you, but they're not going to make you any money either. You know, that's a lunch pail Louie, right? It's got an a brown sack, fucking Greece armpit stain of the fucking greasy sandwich coming through the side of it. That guy's just accepted his lot in life. He's gonna put his head down on, one day's going to look up and he's 60. Right. It's got to hit them with the fuck did I do with my life and right there you drop dead usually with hedge clippers or something, you know, cause he didn't make enough money to fucking, you know, by the electric pair or maybe even get a gardener. Right. All right. So what has happened over the last couple of days since I last talked to you? Well, I lost, I lost money by betting on Wisconsin.

Speaker 2:          05:31          Okay.

Speaker 1:          05:31          I bet. I bet a steak dinner with Keith Robinson. But either way I get to have dinner with Keith Robinson. So it was really, it was really a win win, you know what I mean? He's such a sharp dresser, you know, man of the world renaissance man. He could discuss everything from Earth, wind and fire to the gap band. Now we would talk shit the entire, and uh, I dunno, I don't know shit about basketball, but I'm going to tell you, I'm going to tell you why I would not draft oca for in the first round. I think that guy is a classic waste of a first round draft pick. I think he's a freshman. He's probably a sophomore, but I'm telling you he should have been destroy a net fucking jam band guy on fucking Wisconsin number 44, you know with his Kevin Mchale 2.0 fucking moves. I don't know why everybody just, if you're a big man.

Speaker 2:          06:29          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          06:29          All right. If you're a man who's big and you play the game of basketball's Michael Jordan used to say, he never used to say basketball was always the game of basketball. Kind of like that. Mike and Mike, I always goes a year, he'll flip wall leak

Speaker 3:          06:41          a day. Right now you're going to have a lot of problems covering. She'll be

Speaker 1:          06:47          um, the fuck was I saying? Yeah. I don't know why every big man just doesn't go out. Like if Dwight Howard just went out and stole five fucking moves from Kevin Mchale and five fucking moves from, uh, uh, uh, Keem Olajuwon fucking guy, it'd be unstoppable. He just did that right? And he stole a heart and stuck it in his chest. I think that guy, that guy could be dominant. Fucking guy's a superhero. The guy's got damn bicep is bigger than his head. It's fucking unbelievable. You couldn't draw a guy in better shape than him. Um, what is he doing? He goes on Ellen and he dances around right then as a Celtics fan. I'm like, the lake is not winning a championship. Kobe's is not going to pass the ball to this guy.

Speaker 2:          07:40          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          07:40          Um, you would have had to come on screaming, like fucking powder salt, punching his chest, freaking out. Ellen. Um, I didn't know what I'm talking about. Yeah. Oh, cool. For, I'll tell you why I wouldn't draft if I were, if I had to go back and if I was working for like the w the bobcat's or wherever the, whoever the fuck is going to draft them, cause you know, he's going to go early. All right. This is what I would say. I would just say, yeah, listen, uh, I, I don't think, uh, I don't think we should draft this guy in the first round. I think it's a waste of money. And they would say, why you uncoordinated unathletic balding fuck. And I'd be like, you know, that's a little harsh. Okay. You know, you fucking ask me to do the Goddamn job. Excuse my French.

Speaker 1:          08:17          Okay. And, and I'm doing the job. And you come in and you, what, what's, what's the deal? If I don't agree with you, you're gonna insult me. I'd never say that because I'd be fucking, I'd be, I'd be working for this guy. So it'd be like, yeah, you know, I am, I am a balding fucking loser. Right? Take the paycheck, get in my car and scream at the windshield the whole way home, saint, all the shit I really wished I had the balls to say. Then I'd walk in the door and my wife would see that beaten man, you know, next thing you know, she's looking at the fucking neighbors getting bent over a hedge there. Um, this is what I would say, I would say don't draft. And they would say, why? Look at his, look what he did. Look at all this stuff, all the spreadsheets across the table. Why wouldn't you draft this guy in the first round? I'd say it's simple. The man breathes through his mouth over. Guy Breathes through his mouth. I don't give a fuck what he does on the court. All right. It'll jam. Band Dad was fucking going up and under all the time. Even before he got into foul trouble. He sat on the Goddamn bench breathing through his mouth by two freshmen. One Who looked like he was in Lord of the rings.

Speaker 2:          09:27          Okay.

Speaker 1:          09:28          Little Elfin looking dude, Eddy Munster looking guy. Right? Just fucking drain and them. Then that number three, whatever he was, that guy, I swear to God, he hits like a fucking 3.0 and I think he screamed for like a minute gov down. It's a 3.0

Speaker 2:          09:44          ah. What is wrong with you?

Speaker 1:          09:53          You would've thought he wanted a Kia or something with that shot. I don't fucking get it. Did he bet the game? I mean, I know it was for a championship, but even that reaction, it's like the middle of the fucking game. He's screaming like he just wanted a that said new shit. That's the shit that makes me feel old. I literally watched the game going like, what are these guys screaming above? You just hit a bucket to go up 58, 54 stop yelling and get back on d or when they dunked the ball and then they stare at the crown like, oh my God, can you believe what I just did? Yes, you did it another games. That's why I bought a fucking ticket. I came in and watch you do that. By the way, you see that guy will get just scored. That was your fucking guy.

Speaker 2:          10:40          Okay.

Speaker 1:          10:40          Just negating what the fuck you did because no matter how hard you throw it down and you still just getting two points to get the fuck Vercon do friendship can't, uh, who's tough on his podcast. I am tough. I'm tough on my podcast. Bill birth tough on the podcast.

Speaker 2:          10:55          Okay.

Speaker 1:          10:56          Fucking sweetheart and public. How are you everybody? Um, give them a microphone. Instant cunt.

Speaker 2:          11:04          Okay.

Speaker 1:          11:05          I was singing, I'm singing Beatles songs today with domestic violence lyrics and a, that'll put you in a great mood.

Speaker 2:          11:14          You know I punched you in the face, bitch, and you know, withdrew. Just makes you laugh as you drive down the street. Does that mean you advocate that behavior? What do we return controversially on the Thursday afternoon podcast.

Speaker 1:          11:31          My name is Tripp tripper. And you're watching the Thursday edition. I'm sorry. The fuck am I talking about? Yeah. So congratulations to the Duke Blue Devils. First of all, congratulations with being in the south and being able to keep the name blue devil. I'm surprised considering the devil rays had to change that. I mean, how many pussies live in Tampa or how strong are the fucking pussies that live in fucking tamp, I should say? How big is that group? How many people do you need a group to really affect change like that? How many fucking whining constant you need to change the name of a baseball team. You know what I mean? Or how bad actually we know what the reality is. How bad is your attendance that you're trying to get those 40 cops that you know, I dunno, what, what are they doing? You know what I mean?

Speaker 2:          12:27          Okay.

Speaker 1:          12:27          I think if, if you can't handle devil in a name, I don't think you're going to go to a baseball game because you're not going to want to sit there amongst all those sinners, right? Abusing the Dayville alcohol.

Speaker 2:          12:40          Okay.

Speaker 1:          12:40          Using the Lord's name in vain, cussing and swearing and other words that mean the same thing, right? You're not going to the game. I don't fucking understand it. So congratulations to them. Duke on tobacco. Rude. But game of basketball. We take it seriously down there. We take it serious. We take basketball seriously down here, North Carolina, north cack a lackey. We take it so seriously. We didn't even know we won a Stanley Cup. What is that thing? Why would you have a spittoon so fucking high?

Speaker 1:          13:15          Am I supposed to stand on the table and spitting that fucking thing? Get it out of here. I'm speaking of the south. I got my southern tour coming up, southern tor coming up the Billy Bible belt tour. Coming to a city near you. And um, ticket sales have been good as the first time I've been to a lot of these places. So a couple of them been a little rough, you know, so I'm trying to been hyping the shit out of it, you know, hoping that it's going to fill up. But I've been told in Savannah there's a lot of walk up traffic. That's what they always say is to the performer doesn't kill himself. But actually we've been doing good there. Um, if anybody can get the word out, anybody remotely in New Orleans, if you can try to fucking rally some troops to come see me in uh, the fuck am I going to be dumb?

Speaker 1:          14:02          Am I, once I say Savannah was going to say Savannah fucking New Orleans. I know it's not that. Well, gee bill, maybe that's why they're not coming out, cause you don't know where the fuck are you going to be. Hey, hey, it's fucking side. Are you on here? You know the hell am I going to be here? Well, this weekend I'm going to be in Miami at the Fillmore, Jackie Gleason, and then I'm going to be up in Tampa. If I just called 40 field people up their pussies. I'm at the Ruth Eckerd Hall. Devil Hall in Tampa. You speed the devil halts. Not Savannah, Knoxville, Chattanooga, Memphis is Shreveport, Shreveport, Louisiana. I need some help there. All right. If anybody, anybody at all knows anybody who knows anybody at all that can come out to that show, I'd really appreciate it. I'm playing this legendary theater that's a big fucking theater, but it's the only game town. Um, and it's this theater that like, uh, an unknown. Elvis performed at an unknown. Jerry Lee Lewis has fucking coolest shit they got there. And you know, I'm of course a bunch of black performers that fucking, and they stole from. So whose statue is out in front of the thing? Elvis, Jerry Lee Lewis. Of course, white people.

Speaker 1:          15:14          Um, the other ones are going pretty good. I cannot fucking wait to get on that bus and, uh, go to all these towns that I haven't been to. Man, it's going to be sick. And I am so upset that it's not football season because we're going to a bunch of sec, you know, we're going to miss chipper going to Knoxville, Tennessee. I mean, we just go and buy all these fucking schools. It's going to be killing me, but I'm hoping I sell tickets here so the next time I come back I do even better. And then the next time I do the tour, I can do it during football season. Really Bill is at your plan? Yes it is. Um, all right. What else do I need to talk about? All right. I talked a bunch of shit a couple of days ago. I shit on the Ottawa senator fans the fucking, and I was saying, you're not making the fucking playoffs.

Speaker 1:          16:00          All right. Cause I'm like, dude, we want six in a row. And it wasn't even looking at the stats. I had no idea. I thought, I thought Ottawa was fading. So I said all this horrible shit about them, you know? And uh, now here it is, four days later we lose to the capitals, you know, which isn't good. It's not good when you can't even, you know, score a fucking goal. You know what I mean? And it's driving me nuts. Anyways, so a lot of you probably think it's so, Bill, you're gonna apologize. Are you going to back down from what you say? No.

Speaker 4:          16:30          All right.

Speaker 1:          16:32          What's my name? Fuck. Yo. Yeah, I'm staying with it. I'm going Alec Baldwin in Glengarry Glen Ross. Fuck you. All right. Fuck you. The Bruins are making the playoffs and like I said, we're going to play the Montreal Canadians and not only are we going to set them in the first round, we're going to sweep up. Okay. Which will be fine. Montreal Canadien fans will be able to, there'll be able to survive because they have that little pocket square right in the front pocket of that Blue Blazer, which is great for wiping away tears and snot when you fucking lose. Um, now who's kidding who? I'm just hoping we're going to make the uh,

Speaker 4:          17:07          okay.

Speaker 1:          17:07          I hope to make the playoffs. I mean, shit, that's our fucking Stanley Cup. It seems to shift. But you know what's funny? I watched like the first period of half before I had to go to work, um, if you want to call it telling jokes work, which it isn't. Um, and I thought we would, we were playing great. You know what I mean? We will, we will, it looked like we were competing with them. We just couldn't score a fucking goal. I don't know what we need to do. Who the hell knows? I mean, what do they, they don't, I saw the first two goals. The first one was, was a great goal. The second one, I mean, no deflection, what are you going to do? But, um, I've actually become sort of a capitals fan because, you know, just Ovechkin scoring

Speaker 5:          17:50          all of those goals. It takes me back to the 80s, man. Like that shit used to happen all the time. You know, like goaltenders were like my size in the 80s and they wore pads, you know, that weren't like gigantic. Did you see, you know, I saw a thing the other day that saying how the fucking, the, uh, the goalie's glove now doesn't even close, which is weird to me, I think closes a little bit, but they figured out that, you know, what, why have it closed? Because the goaltender, we'll just have a closed and if he can't open an in time, it might just slip by. So just have this giant fucking fishnet thing, you know, like you're scooping up large mouth bass out of the fucking a lake or something and just have it open like that. It's like really, do we need to take away more than that?

Speaker 5:          18:36          You know? I Dunno, but I actually learned some shit about hockey. You know, they always say five hole is between the legs. And then there's one, two, three, four, which is the fucking corner starting down in the lower left, I believe it goes like this lower left corner is one lower right corner is two and then you go straight up. That's three. And then back over to the left is four I believe I might might have fucked that up. And then five hole was between the legs. That's all there was. So the other day somebody goes, he went seven hall and then I heard there's a six hole. I had no idea. And that's six holds seven hole, his fucking his glove side between the arm and the body and then blocker's side between the arm and the body. One six one seven I don't even know.

Speaker 5:          19:19          I never even fucking heard of that shit. And it just struck me as funny that they're now talking about two more holes in the goaltender when they're fucking gigantic people, you know, they look like refrigerators. Like the padding that they have is unreal. I saw to grasp on time, I did comics come home and some of the Bruins were down there actually a bunch of them down. It's fucking awesome. But um, you know, I thought that guy was like, I don't know why I thought he weighed like two 40 or something like that. And he's very like, he's tall, but he's like lanky. But you look them with the pads on guy looks like a monster. So there you go. If you get mugged in the subway, just get yourself some goalie pads, right? If you get mugged every day, you know, go to big and tall, get yourself a suit, you put it over there.

Speaker 5:          20:01          Obviously adult wear the mask or the gloves. All right. Then you do that weird little run that you do when you're wearing goalie pads. You sit down with the train. Nobody fucks with you. If they do, you got on all the paddock, they'll just think you're fat. You know he's a hitting you and that's a stupid plan. What do you want from me? Go Fuck Yourself. Okay. I'm trying to help you out, you know. All right. This is another being married story. All right? Just the shit that will fucking, that will really drive you up the fucking wall. Unless you could figure out a cute way to bring it up. All right. I'm coming home from the gym. All right. We don't have any food in the house. I don't know why. Probably because we ate it all and didn't go to the supermarket. That's how you run out of food.

Speaker 1:          20:48          But who knows? You know, might have a fucking mouse. I Dunno. No Jesus fucking plot. Guess it's going off the rails here. Let's get to the thing here. So I fucking, I'm going to come home and make some toast, right? We don't even need lunch meat. We got nothing. So I'm like, all right, fuck this shit. I'm just going to make a fucking piece of toast, right? Peanut butter and Jelly on top of it. That'll fill me up. Bowl of cereal. Who gives a fuck? Okay, great. After work out great. After a workout fucking meal. So I show up, I put the piece of bread to crust all the way down to the end. It sounds like a fucking like one of those fairy tales. Like I should be scrubbing the floor with a toothbrush to the, the, the level of lack of food here. So it's the cross. The last piece, they put it in the toaster. I get the peanut butter, the peanut and I get the Jelly and now I'm looking for the fucking table butter. Where is it? Where the fuck is it? And I immediately start muttering to myself, did she put it in the fucking bridge? Why didn't she always put it in the fucking fridge?

Speaker 1:          21:46          You know this fucking hard butter in the fridge. You know you get, I don't know about you guys, but I like soft spreadable butter for my toast. I don't want to fucking hard as a rock. And then I'm going through the bread. Some, the old me,

Speaker 1:          22:03          the old me would have flipped out. Like, why the Fuck d? Like, you know? Yeah, why the fuck do you keep putting the fucking man? You know, it would've been an idiot about it, but I didn't. I wrote her a note instead, I wrote Nia, I think it's time. We talked about soft spreadable butter. I like soft spreadable butter. It's great for toast waffles. And I imagined pancakes too. There's already hard butter in the fridge, so there's no reason to add to it and eliminate all options for soft spreadable butter. It's not. The summer said, don't be a parlor. Say Yes. This soft spreadable butter bill came in laughing her ass off. She still didn't understand my point. I explained it to her. She laughed and she said okay. And she left. So they had golf. And that's one to grow on.

Speaker 1:          22:54          Always use sense of humor when you can. If you get the fucking broads laugh and once they titty started jiggling and your fucking homefree, how would it do she know? There was such a cute little story there and I had to ruin it with my fucking, my, my, my piggish behavior. Um, look, and by the way, for all you butter cones out there, I realized in the summertime, if it gets really hot, it can totally melt. Okay? That's why I threw in the summer thing cause I was trying to think, well how is she gonna fucking argue this? So I think she understands it now. All right. I am a waffle making motherfucker. I don't know if you guys know that, man. I fucking got that shit down. I make them all the time. I enjoy them. Um, all right, Dave Grohl gets spooked when he looks at Francis being Cobain.

Rolling Stone published excerpts from his forthcoming interview with Francis Being Cobain, uh, the daughter of Kurt and executive proof producer on the new documentary of his life, a montage of heck. And unlike some sections of the Nirvana diehard fanbase, Frances isn't so quick to lionize her father speaking about the potential awkwardness of preferring oasis to Nirvana. Francis said, I would've felt more awkward if I'd been a fan. I was around 15 when I realized he was in escapable. Even if I was in a car and had the radio one, there's my dad. He's larger than life and our culture is obsessed with dead musicians. Yeah, that's true. We love to put them on pedestals. If Kurt had just been another guy who abandoned his family in the most awful way possible.

Speaker 2:          27:58          Hm.

We're so sick of these fucking people who get TV shows about a job and they think that that that's your fucking job now is still the job that the show and know you're a TV star. It's not a fucking court of law. Even though it has the authority of a court of law. How many courts do you know out there? Okay, that ceased to exist if they get bad ratings, you know what I mean? Actually left that comment on one of those fucking youtube video things, man. He's fucking girl show boat. They always show boat and slam it down the hammer screaming and yelling and then you know, they go to the commercial and then the producer comes up and whispers in their ear like, yeah, that was great television. That was great. Tells me, Hey, do more yelling, yell more. ESPN is making a killing with the yelling. I fuck ain't oh maybe it's my hatred of women. I don't know what it is. But those fucking women judges, that's my nightmare of what being married is. You know, cause you're legally bound to them and they can take half your shit. So now they can fucking yell at you like that. Banging a hammer hammer on some fucking coffee table.

Speaker 5:          37:34          Oh, I'll tell you right now. You can take half my shit. I'll fucking walk just to get away from you and your fucking goddamn menopause. Chicken neck fucking screaming at me. Go fuck yourself, Judge Judy. There's no fucking way I would stand there. Okay. And get yelled at like that because a third of my swing set is on my neighbor's property. You're gonna fucking yell at me like that.

Speaker 5:          37:59          Cause cause why? Why are you yelling at me like that? You don't even feel it. Judge Judy, all you, all you want to do is get good ratings. Fucking grand standing. Go Fuck Yourself. Please tell me not naked under that rope. You emaciated older fork.

Speaker 2:          38:24          Oh. Oh

Speaker 5:          38:34          I got, I got an overrated overrated. Picking up a fucking magazine that lists 10 great places to go to breakfast and then believing that no one else read the magazine and there's not going to be aligned three miles long the next fucking morning when you show up to get your pancakes. That's exactly what happened. We pull up and I see this fucking looks like a God damn breadline during the depression and then with Nia and a mom and I immediately just go, hey, you guys want to go somewhere else? And then somebody in the car goes, well, there's probably going to be a line everywhere, right? So we fucking stand in line for 40 minutes. Got to the point. I'm crouching down like, uh, my back is killing my lower back. Like I'm so old, I can't stand for longer than like 20 minutes without my lower back killing me some standing there, 40 minutes in, I'm crouching down like a, you ever see Asians when they have a conversation in China, how they just fucking nigger.

Speaker 5:          39:28          They can crouch down like that and are people in India, you know, they crouched down like that. They'd been doing it their whole lives. So their hamstrings are all stretched out. I was down like that. My big head turn it all red. I'm trying to stand in a little bit of the shade and uh, I don't know. Finally I was like, let's, let's get the fuck outta here. Right? So everybody agreed, we leave and we ended up going, I mean, we stood in line for breakfast so long, it's not time to get lunch. So we ended up going down. We were on Santa Monica and we go down into West Hollywood and there's a place down there, hamburger Harry's. They have great fucking, uh, they've got great burgers and it's one, but it's also one of the gayest places you'll have a goatee in your life. I didn't realize how gay it was. And I went there and the waiter was like really gay or whatever, but I didn't really think about it. Right? So I drop off the ladies and I go over and I parked the car, I get out of the car and I come walking in and I'm starving. And as I'm walking in, all of a sudden this guy pushes me in the back, like gave me a nice little shove and I turned around and he goes to need a table.

Speaker 5:          40:44          Fuck it. It's fucking gay. Dude pushed me in the bed. He pushed me like fuck. Then like not hard enough to make me stumble, but hard enough to fuck up the gate of my walk. And immediately, you know, felt the feelings you feel when somebody fucking pushes you. When I turn around like, what the fuck? And the guys just standing there [inaudible] the table and I went, no, I'm just meeting them over there. And then he kinda had a weird look on his face and he walked away and I sit down and he's like, hey, how's it going? I'm like, wait, but how's it going? I go there. Fucking gay guy. Just push me. So I tell her the story and I'm off. I've got with like, what the fuck is it? Some gay thing. You just fucking go around pushing people and then Nia goes, he was probably hitting on you, right? So now my ego kicks in. I'm like, fuck, I still am in shape sell for any of my fucking twinkle toed listeners out there. Is that how you guys hit on each other? Was that just like, Hey Kelly, do you want to table? Is that what he was doing?

Speaker 5:          41:45          Fucking annoying. Whatever it was. And I felt embarrassed and I felt bad, like, like a that look on his face when I went, now I'm sitting over here like, then he thought that I, I don't know what

Speaker 2:          41:56          okay.

Speaker 5:          41:56          That I was saying, get out of here. You're queer. You know, cause that's a whole big fucking thing now you gotta be nice to those guys. What the fuck I'm saying? So anyways, so we sit down, all right. And immediately the dude comes over, how I'm, can I take your order? We fucking order and we're getting our food immediately the way you should when you go out to eat. So now, despite the fact that fucking the, the waiter pushed me like that dude who push Zidane Oh, Chara after he scored the goal, that's basically how he pushed me. And then I turned around and looked at it. I'm like, I was going to run him into the boards basically, right? So they fucking bring the food over. It's delicious, everything's going great. And then all of a sudden this fucking dude gets on the Mike and he can't see him. He's like, okay, everybody shows 10 minutes, right? And I'd say, Nigga, what's going on? She goes, evidently, they're going to have a show.

Speaker 5:          42:54          It's fucking broad daylight out. I guess they're going to come out and drag and they're going to do a show like this. This is how gave this place is that they're going to have a brunch slash transvestite Lipsync fucking show. And I got to tell you, it was absolutely fucking hilarious. We was sitting there and the guy on the mic, it's like 1130 in the morning and he said, cunt on the mic. He goes, come on, bitches, drink up. We're having a show. Don't be a bunch of something. And he goes, sorry, I'm sorry, I'm just feeling a little cunty there with Nias mom. And this guy starts saying cunt, like every other fucking word in broad daylight. And as a comedian, I had to respect the guy. All right. I've never said cunt on stage when the sun's out, I'm not going to lie to you. I barely say it on stage. I say at a ton of times here cause it's ridiculous. But I really don't say it that much on a comedy club stage. And this dude slash half a lane is say it con every other word at Brunch. And uh, so anyways, so they come down like three of them. The host sucked, right? He had this giant head with this huge fucking, uh, I dunno what blonde wig on

Speaker 5:          44:19          and he, he was like doing jokes that should have been funny but weren't at some point he said something about a bloody pussy and we're sitting here eating brunch and he makes a bloody pussy joke. So as a comedian, this, this should have been hilarious, was timing was awful. He'd say the setup and then he mumbled a punchline and he was annoying me. The next one came out was, all right, the dude looked like Nancy grace. So that was cracking me up. And then, uh, the next one looked like a soccer mom.

Speaker 6:          44:49          Yeah.

Speaker 5:          44:50          If, if she was in Battlestar Galactica, you know, you know, when they have those, uh, you know, they get that Woodstock, Ellen degenerate haircut kind of had that, but spiked up and that was hilarious. And then the last one freaked me out. There's always one that's going to freak you out because it's going to almost look like a fucking chick. So it had like acid plants and it's like, I'm trying to eat and I got, I gotta get Outta here. So I go up, I walk out of the restaurant because, you know, it's one of those deals. It's like when in Rome you went into their place, so you got to tolerate, then becomes, does that point we just like, all right, this is, this is too fucking creepy. I gotta get Outta here. You know. So I walk out and I'm standing on the corner out in front of this place that turned into the gayest place I've ever been in.

Speaker 5:          45:39          And I got to tell you, I walked down the street all the time in la. Nobody ever tells me that they saw me, nobody's ever seen me, nothing. I come walking out of this place right. And this behind me is this something the transvestite that almost looks like it, chick with acid plants and his dancing to salt and pepper push it. I swear to God. So I'm standing out in front of that place and it's that part of the song was going Bullshit Dona Ana and this guy pulls up from the comedy store stopping at the Red Light. He's like, hey bill, how you doing? And I'm just like, hey, how's it gone? Done and the fucking background and my face literally turned red with embarrassment.

Speaker 5:          46:27          But fortunately, fortunately the guy owned a restaurant across the way. So then he ended up coming out, coming over to me coming out. How fucking funny is that? He comes over to me and he goes, uh, you know, to shoot the shit. Cause I've been telling him I was going to go to his restaurant and that just, then fortunately Nia and her mom walked out and I've never been so relieved to be like, this is my girlfriend. And this is your mom. I didn't know that there was gonna be a fucking, it was like, uh, when I got a, I had a mid eighties, I don't know what a mid eighties, a sitcom, you know, with this, this situation

Speaker 6:          47:08          [inaudible] [inaudible].
