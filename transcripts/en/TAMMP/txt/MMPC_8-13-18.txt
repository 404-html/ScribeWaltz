Speaker 1:          00:00:01       Hey, what's going on is Bill Byrd is time for the Monday morning podcast from Monday, August 13th, 2017 what's going on? How I, yeah. Um, I figured out what the problem was with the volume last time. You know, all my podcasts, I think I can't figure this out. I had some guy how to a volume II. I remember. I'm like, I gotta go. Everything all turned up. I actually had two microphones plugged in and I was on the one that was turned all the way down. So you were hearing it. I was speaking into a dead mic next to him, Mike, that was live. Oh, bill is so unprofessional. Hey Man. Um, I had a major breakthrough, major breakthrough in my life. I don't know if you've read about it in the New York Times, The Washington Post, the fucking de Moines. Uh, what would they say that the morning Herald, I dunno. Um,

Speaker 2:          00:00:57       yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:00:58       I moved in my house fucking seven years ago and one of the house warming gifts that I got was a food processor or should've said process. Right? I got a food processor and this fucking thing. Never worked.

Speaker 1:          00:01:15       I plugged it in. I did there, but that, but dad just would not fucking work. So years later I bought a smaller one for when I was on the road, when I was going to make myself some smoothies. Hi Fellow. It's going to make myself some smoothies so I could get my abs, you know, so I could show up at the clam bake and everybody can be like, oh, what happened to bill? He's still blinding white, but good God. Is He chiseled? Is He chiseled? Can't you can't tell. That's one of the sad things. No matter how good a shape I get it, you won't notice because I'm so blindly a white chalk white. It just, you just can't see it. You know what I mean?

Speaker 2:          00:01:52       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:01:52       You don't put, you know, where's my Hashtag? What about me? What about my pain? I'm having to wear sweat pants all the way through summer just to avoid the bullying. Uh, anyways, he's fucking food processor wasn't working, wouldn't work. So I got the little one, the little one worked a couple of times, then it wouldn't work. Then sometimes it work and that wouldn't work.

Speaker 1:          00:02:15       Am like, boy, what the fuck are these things short out? What's going on with them? So you know what, I fucked, you know. So anyways, I'm on this diet right now. I got a nutritionist. Every fucking thing is, you know, uh, you know, take some almonds in, fucking dice them up with, I don't know if you've ever tried to do that on a cutting board with the knife. They go flying all over the place. But if you have a word or a food processor, I always want to call it a word process of food processor. Why? Why? It's a Jiffy, you know, he just put it in and it's easy. You feel like fucking Rachael Ray, you spinning around and you're like, how come I'm not hosting a cooking show? All that's right. Because the last red head was out there grabbing. So there's another black hole and this,

Speaker 2:          00:03:01       okay.

Speaker 3:          00:03:01       Foot judges.

Speaker 2:          00:03:06       Yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:03:08       First, the guy from Nyp de Bleu takes off from his fucking series, like after one season to have a movie career in jade and all those movies, which were good, they didn't do well at the box office and then they would like, that's it. Fuck redheads, fuck redhead males in the lead. We know it. We knew it from day one, even when we were making black hat black and white fucking movies, fuck red heads, you know, and Eric Stoltz immediately felt the effects of that.

Speaker 3:          00:03:36       Um, so I'll take one red head to go out there and fuck it up and then they just stick it on the bench for a while. I'm just fucking with you guys anyways. Um, I'm on my own journey. What I do and what I asked the universe for. It's what I'm going to get. You have to have blinders on yet. Pay, be empathetic and be aware of others. Um, so anyways, I went to this kid's birthday party on Saturday and uh, it was just Christmas themed party, which seem nuts to me. And then I showed up, but it was fucking awesome. They're the AC crank. And they had the Christmas sogs going. It was a kid's birthday. It was incredible. It was actually, it was a great time. They had a basketball hoop. All the little kids were out there trying to dunk. That was funny. Every kid was Dunkin cause that's all they show. That's all they show. Um, on the highlights, you know, you only way you can take, the only way a jump shot makes a highlight now is if you cross the other guy over and he fell down and 30 people have to run by the screen going,

Speaker 2:          00:04:50       ah,

Speaker 3:          00:04:52       after you did it. You know, like if Larry Bird played right now, he would never make an under sports center. Um, I don't understand the running around all day. Like somebody could literally take a full water bottle flipping upside down and if it lands on top, hey buddy, acting like the dude just levitated Oh, I'm an old man. Whatever. I'm slowly feeling it's slipping away and I'm watching young people enjoy themselves the new way that human beings enjoy themselves and never deli. I don't approve. How were the millennial generation survived? Do you have any idea what the fuck my dad does? So anyways, I, uh, I come home all right. Everything they had at the birthday party, I couldn't eat. I was being that La Douche that was on a diet. These wonderful people made all this amazing guy. It was fucking unbelievable. They had gingerbread men in August. Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:05:58       Gingerbread men that could fuck with anybody's December level gingerbread men as a ginger. I wasn't even offended. Okay. That's how good these cookies, Alia cupcakes, they're rice krispie treats. Then they had this, this breaded chicken that just, it just look bites. I just looked fucking

Speaker 1:          00:06:24       incredible. Right? And it was also at the thing and, and uh, one of the, the husband was a, uh, was, was, uh, uh, uh, a bourbon whiskey scotch guy. And he's the only guy I've ever seen that had a bottle of monkey. And that's when I found when I was over in France, but that I finished in three nights, by the way, which is why all freckles are still on the wagon. Okay. My fucking, my liver is still, you know, talking to me about that one. Now they're going to let it go. You know, just like you check, you know, you did that one fucking thing. Oh, they're going to bring it up for years, right. So anyway, so I come home and you know, I'm fucking starving. All I drank there was waters and um, I had a Santa hat on. It was fucking awesome.

Speaker 1:          00:07:12       Anyways, so, uh, come back to the house and now I'm trying to chop up these God damn fucking almonds. I'm like, fuck this, let me get that little food processor right. And it fucking put it together. And Lo and behold, the fucking thing works. I'm like, fine, great. So an pill, I take the top off, whatever, and I go to put my shit in, I put the top back on and that doesn't fucking work again and I'm losing my shit. So my wife keeps coming in and out. So now we have an outlet for my anger, my poor wife. Right. You know, it's one of these deals, like I'm frustrated over here and then just becomes like, how many times you going to come in here on a door, you know, you do one of those and then look, what is your problem? I can't fuck Jesus Christ. That's going to be a fucking 40 minute conversation there. It goes my evening. And that's exactly what happened. Well, long story short, I was trying to make some almond crusted baked chicken breasts, eight ounces to be exact, saving the rest for my lunch tomorrow with a Greek Yogurt, yogurt and in fucking dill dip or whatever the fuck I had, you know? And um,

Speaker 4:          00:08:18       yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:08:19       you know, the whole, I just said, fuck it. I'm just going to make this chicken plane and I'll, I'll just eat it with the dip. And that's what I did. And I've stuck to the Diet, right. So, you know,

Speaker 1:          00:08:29       my wife read me the riot act, what an asshole I am. And you know, I couldn't argue because she was right at that point, my stomach was full and I was able to look back on what I had just done pretty clearly at that point. I was just like, yeah, I don't think I would be liking me right now either. Um, so I sat down and he nodded and I agreed. And then I tried to make some points, which is always bad when you're that much in the wrong, but you know, it's just how I'm wired. You know, as I said, you know, I'm down 40 to nothing, I'm still gonna try to kick a field goal. Okay. Um, so that took a day and a half, still apologize completely for, and I had to make her laugh a lot and she already doesn't like me. You know, we're having like a, a rough time right now because I'm on this diet and I keep making extra shit and, but it's so my next, you know, meal and she just, she just, you know, she's coming by like it's a buffet. She'd be like,

Speaker 2:          00:09:24       I like Veggie Tacos.

Speaker 1:          00:09:26       I'm like, yeah, but there's only like this is all measured and they wait to after you fucking make it.

Speaker 2:          00:09:33       Okay. Oh good.

Speaker 1:          00:09:37       And then you gotta be like, no, you can't. Well, you have to eat all of it yet, but I might have it tomorrow. This is how this works. Okay. Turn your key does. It does. There's a launch sequence to this. It already started.

Speaker 1:          00:09:56       Um, so that just keeps being a problem because she feels like I'm not sharing. And so when I keep doing is I keep giving her a bite of this bland sugar-free salt free shit than I'm eating. I'm like, you sure you want some of this? You know, she had some of my oatmeal and Allman fucking pancakes yesterday. Peaches in a peaches in it. The chopped peaches in it. That was the tree. That was the oasis. She had to keep running to as you worked your way through all of that stuff. All right. But I will tell you, you know, I feel fucking tremendous. My energy is through the God damn roof. Um, so anyways, the next morning I wake up to make my fucking Allmond Goddamn motherfucking oatmeal pancakes. Now I'm calm. You know, I had my hot water with lemon sitting there. I'm by myself, you know, am I?

Speaker 1:          00:10:46       No, no, no. I'm never by myself. That's right. I had already brought my daughter up and I've fed her and she was watching puppy dog pals and I had her in the highchair. She was locked in, you know, she had a little sippy cup and she was fucking, you know, love and life. So I went out there and I was just like, I'm going to figure out how to use these fucking work with these food processors, not word processed food processor. And I got this giant bin where I keep all the instruction manuals throughout the years, every fucking thing I've ever owned. Okay. Instruction manuals for my refrigerator. Like what do you need to know how to open and close the fucking door? Right. I Dunno, I wanted it to be colder temperature down Arrow, Arrow, arrow. Right. Um,

Speaker 1:          00:11:33       anyways, I ended up finding the fucking, um, instructional manual for both of them. And this fucking food processors that I got seven years ago, I realized always worked. It's just with the food processor, there's only way that it goes together. And I know this is basics for a lot of you fucking do you know people, you know who don't think outside the box the way I do, who don't have faith in your own abilities to just put something together. You have to cheat and look at the instructions. So what I'm doing here, I'm making myself a hero anyways. Yes, Bill, we do see what you're doing here. Um, so I, uh, I got it out and it's like there's only one way that it can go together where it's still going to work because there's no way they're going to let you put it together wrong or have the top off and have that blade spinning because you know, somebody somehow fucking stuck their hand or their face in it. Yeah. And died. Right. You know, or had the top off and then realize they had some ingredient and on the top shelf and the cover right above it and they got up above it. You know when they was squatting and say we're going to stand up, you know, and old Matt and Ben Hung Down there, right? They've got all shredded.

Speaker 2:          00:12:55       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:12:56       So what kills me, what I've learned about food processors is all of them will go together about three to four different ways, but only one way. You can put it together and it will work. And that's what the problem was. The problem is really that I didn't, um, I didn't read the manual, but now it's kind of fascinating. It's sort of like this, it's like this electric current fucking thing. It's just like, it will go to here. Now we will go pass through the handle and then pass through the top and now you can fucking dice your goddamn almonds. Get it fucking text message here. What is the problem?

Speaker 2:          00:13:32       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:13:33       Oh, Jesus quitters. Anyways, Shell, I now have a word processor in my life. A food processor. Fuck.

Speaker 2:          00:13:40       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:13:41       Processes the food. And I gotta tell you it's been fucking awesome. And I got that little one. I know how that works. So now I can bring that on the road. It makes some smell.

Speaker 2:          00:13:52       You know,

Speaker 1:          00:13:55       there's nothing worse than eating right while you're eating right. But there's nothing better after. And when you eat bad, it's the opposite. There's nothing better than eating like shit. And there's nothing worse than right after, you know, for the next morning, it's usually two days later. So you look down and it's just like, oh my God, am I preggers? Um, all right. So anyways, that's, that's, that's my food processor story. So if you're like me, if you ever got a gift, a food processor gift,

Speaker 2:          00:14:24       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:14:25       And, uh, it never quite worked for you and you have like massive add or are you just a fucking scatter brained moron? Which I sometimes think add is a euphemism for, uh, just go back and look at the manual. All right? Usually the handle has to face you and then the top goes on just so, uh, then you have your, just, your life will be so much fucking easier. So anyways, the first week was detox. I already did that. And now this second week is healthy gut. So it's a bunch of Greek yogurt that, you know, it has probiotics in it, which is great because you know, when you drink booze, I guess booze kills the good bacteria. See there's good bacteria and there's bad bacteria in your gut. The bad bacteria is therefore who else all day when you die, when you die, the, that's the bacteria that then begins to feed a jeweler as you decompose.

Speaker 1:          00:15:21       That's actually true man. And a lot it turns into like gas and shit like that, which is why they always find like a headless torso floating in the bay. It's the shit in your gut that turns to gas and it's like a fucking water balloon. And you'd go up not to mention, you know what I mean? If you've already got some blubber on you, if that's probably another reason. But I remember reading that book, uh, the West East, that that movie state of grace was loosely, loosely based on, and um, they used to do, they used to, you know, they kill somebody and they used to call it that the Houdini because the guy would disappear and what they would do, they always made sure that they, they would, they chop them all up, but they make sure that they got them too. So then he would never come back because if he, if he didn't take the time, but you know, get the guts out of them, then, then they, they would, they, you'd have a floater. Goddammit. I'm, there you go. Now you know how to murder somebody, but not an emergency, but you know how to get rid of them.

Speaker 2:          00:16:16       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:16:17       Um, anyways, uh, what did I do this weekend? Red Sox, keep winning. You spend enough money, you can sweep the oriels. That's what we paid for. We've won nine of our last 10. We won nine out of 10 games in August. We lost one game to go. Blue Jays swept the Yankees, uh, went to, and one against Toronto. Is that right? One for against the Yankees.

Speaker 2:          00:16:42       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:16:42       21. That's three. Yes. Right. And then what's swept three with a, the oriels now we've got the fillies coming up who always play as tough. Got to games with them in leg excitement. Then we got Tampa Bay and then we got our uh, another big test. We got the Cleveland Indians, uh, scary. Terry Francona I still think is the best manager in baseball. He's got them playing great with what he has and um,

Speaker 1:          00:17:10       yeah, we'll see how we do against them. We've got two series with them and then the Houston before we play too with the Yankees and then we're done. Then we go into the playoffs. God willing, God willing, but evidently it's the whole fucking thing is over because we swept the Yankees in the beginning of August, despite the fact that Yankees have come back down 18 games against us, we blown in eight, we blew that fucking lead and 2012, I'm never comfortable until you won the division. But then at the Yankees get the fucking wildcard. It's like you did not dispose of them. It's just like, well here we go now with zero, zero. So all that we didn't really didn't mean shit cause the greedy cuts, what fucking rounds of playoffs.

Speaker 3:          00:17:51       Playoffs. Everybody makes it. Everybody makes it. Everybody makes it. Hey, if you want to hear something hilarious, listen to Paul versus these Diversey effect this week because he watched the giants first preseason game and that absolute beast that they drafted, his name escapes me. I saw him play in the rose bowl, the running back from Penn state. He said, he goes, dude, you got to see his first run. You said he fucking, he went one way and then he had it all sealed off. He ran the other way for like 40 yards and I guess uh, the giant faithful, we're going fucking crazy or you will not find a more loyal spill sports fan that Paul Versey and I know it's been easy to be a giant fair during the fucking Eli days, but he has been our hardcore New York Knicks fan since I met him. I can only feel so bad for him because he is a giant set, a Yankees Fan.

Speaker 3:          00:18:37       He said plenty of success right in his lifetime that he's remembered. They have won five world series and two Superbowls is pretty God damn good. Right? He doesn't give a fuck about hockey. They brain just won a Stanley Cup. He's not a mets fan. They want an 86 a, here we go. Belt. Now you got to work it all out, don't ya? Then who's left? Oh, the jets. Jesus Christ and I think it just goes downhill. Um, anyways, he was all excited about that. I did not see all my patriots were doing. Um, this might be Tom Brady's last year, maybe next year. It's all winding down and I'm waiting to see who in the AFC is going to step up.

Speaker 3:          00:19:17       I mean from the rumblings I heard that it seems like the jets seem like the, the, the odds on favorite to be the next one, to have a run as long as bill Bellacheck sticks around after Brady leaves, at least within the next three years. We'll see how that goes. But what a, what to run til they got another one in them. I don't know. We won five out of eight, I couldn't be fucking happier. Um, speaking of not being, could not be happier. Did anybody watch any motorcycle racing yesterday or these past two weeks? Believe the one last, uh, two weeks ago was in, uh, Berlin. I think it was somewhere in Germany. These last two fucking races had been so god damn exciting. Let's just talk about yesterdays Austrian Grand Prix.

Speaker 2:          00:20:06       Okay.

Speaker 3:          00:20:06       Austrian. I believe birthplace of Adolf Hitler, I believe. Okay. Um,

Speaker 2:          00:20:15       okay.

Speaker 3:          00:20:15       You know, it's so fucking, well, I think it's just because I live over here. Whenever I go over there, that's all I ever think. All right. Whenever I'm in Paris or Mikey and I walk up the shops, Elisa, I'm like, Hitler drove down this fucking street in a Mercedes Benz standing up fucking waving to the crowd. Like he just won a super bowl, you know? And I think if you just grow up over there, it just seems like olden day shit because you know when I sit out here in Los Angeles, I don't think like a, there was some native Americans here, you know, living off the land dead, not, not stealing any water. Um, anyways, you got to watch that fuck you get if you're going to get into racing, if you're like, eh, it just seemed like they ran, you ran the fucking circle. You need excitement. Motorcycle racing is where it's at. Moto GP is the best racing out there. Okay. And the show the past two weeks that Jorge Lorenzo, mark, Mark Marquez and Andre De vi Andres Divisio. So I hope that's how you say his first name, um, have put on, it's been, it's been, I, they had me off the couch miming rolling on the throttle.

Speaker 4:          00:21:27       Yeah,

Speaker 3:          00:21:28       I was screaming at the fucking TV the last couple of laps. They basically doing, I don't know, 160, 170, 180 miles an hour, almost bumping into each other like they're racing on horses, which is dangerous enough. And what did they, what I'm finding is, is these Ducati's have an incredible amount of torque that the Honda can't fuck with Jorge Lorenzo and the visio. So both are on the, uh, on the um,

Speaker 4:          00:21:59       okay.

Speaker 3:          00:21:59       Ducati team, Jesus Christ spaced took on the Ducati team. A Mac Mac has is on the Honda and I heard Latin that I heard yesterday that Jorge Lorenzo's is going to go to the right a Honda next year. I don't know why the fuck he would do that with his skills. Why would you want to be on like a slower bike? But Mark Marquez I think,

Speaker 4:          00:22:19       yeah,

Speaker 3:          00:22:19       I dunno. I, I think he, he just, he just rides perfectly so he gets them in the corners and he just takes the perfect line around the track beef, literally the fastest way around the track. And then in the beginning of this race, cars, uh, last week's right Keith, he came in third, which is a massive failure in his world. And uh, Dubitsky Ozone, Jorge, Lorenzo's just, they passed each other like three times on the final lap. And this week Mark Marquez and Jorge Will Lorenzo. There was three passes on the final lap. It was fucking unbelievable.

Speaker 4:          00:22:55       Okay.

Speaker 3:          00:22:55       And, um,

Speaker 4:          00:22:57       okay.

Speaker 3:          00:22:57       In the beginning of the race, mark, mark has, I think it was just, he kind of knew the power that the Ducati's had. So he was just trying to fucking put as much space between himself and other Ducati's as he could. It's so fascinating that the tire that they're on, and then Jorge was kind of like laying back or Davinci also was, I think was laying back, couldn't get around Lorenzo. But then you don't know if that's a strategy, like, ah, you're on soft to tires. Go ahead and let you run a little bit, let you chew up your fucking tires. I'm on a heart attire and then I'm going to fucking, you know, after the races, like halfway over. Um, but they do this subtle thing where they, they hang back but they still press the person. Um, so hopefully the tires are all fucking chewed up and they don't have as good a grip and then they can, they can run them down in the end.

Speaker 3:          00:23:41       Uh, I barely know what I'm talking about, but I have to tell you, it is fucking incredible. Uh, you have to get into it. And here's another great thing. Most racist, it's like 25, 26, 27 laps. There's no pit stops. It's a perfect thing for an American to get into. It's fast, it's exciting, and there's no breaks. Okay. Even though we have a bunch of timeouts and shit, it's like, it's like you fast forwarding through the commercials. It's like no fucking commercials. Um, cannot say enough about it. Um, and for those who actually pay attention, mark has, it looks like he's going to win the championship. He's way out in front. I don't know what happened to Rossi this week. He, uh, must, they had some sort of grid penalty. Yuri crashed. I don't know what, but he started in like 14th place. But that fucking guy is, he's second in points.

Speaker 3:          00:24:29       But as far as wins, Golf Marquez says one five this year, Lorenzo's one three. [inaudible] has one too. And a Marquez has been on nine different podiums.

Speaker 2:          00:31:07       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:31:08       And then that's the question that gets the guy's fucking brow sweating.

Speaker 2:          00:31:13       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:31:14       Unbelievable fucking show. One of my favorite memories of my adult life was, uh, I was in Rome, Italy.

Speaker 2:          00:31:22       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:31:22       As opposed to roam North Carolina. Bill. I was in Rome. I was getting ready to do a run of dates, so I had to get acclimated to the time. So I went over there five days early because my lovely wife and my mother in law and, uh, we were all jet lagged and at three in the morning we will watch and fucking Colombo. Somehow it was in English, I believe add open because we were watching it. And uh, we just, it was a fucking greatest night ever. It's just one of those fucking nights. She didn't go on vacation, didn't have anything to do. And then Colombo comes on at three in the morning.

Speaker 2:          00:31:58       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:31:59       And, uh, we just had the best time ever watched it. Oh, it's such a great show. Um, but is there anything else that I wanted to talk about before I get into your questions? For the week. I'm a little pressed for time here. Um, oh. So, oh God. You know, I, I been going to the gym now.

Speaker 1:          00:32:16       Everything's going great. I'm turning my, uh, my ass cheeks. I don't know if I, I mentioned to this, I did mention since you, but people who might've missed last week's podcast. I figured out the reason why I kept having this sciatic nerve problem was because of 20 years of being on the road, sitting in writer's rooms, just sitting down in general and not doing legs the way I have. Um, my fucking glutes turned into fucking two pieces of veal cutlet and I'm just sitting on skin and bones back there. So, uh, after a while, the, the Sadek nerve gets Impinj death. So, um, anyways, I, uh, I been doing my legs religiously and, uh, I dunno, I'm starting to have a little bit cube steak back there.

Speaker 1:          00:33:10       Still a poor cut of meat. But I am a, I am dedicated to doing this as somebody told me a long time ago that, um, one of the great things to do is to constantly to never stop doing squats because uh, you know, as you become like an older person and everything, you want to be able to get up and out of bed, get up and out of a chair and that type of stuff. And then also your quads are the biggest muscle in your body. So it's going to burn the most fat and all of this shit. So anyways, I'm not gonna lie to you guys. I, I've been, I've been really, uh, talking to some people for the first time in my life and I realized how many exercises I did it, the gym with terrible form. So now I have my form down pat. Like I have my shoulders down and back and speaking to my back.

Speaker 1:          00:34:02       Like I've really been working all my back muscles and everything because you know, being a child of the 80s, it was all do it working your badge, what can your bench, right. And it was all bench in. And currently you do tries or whatever, but you wouldn't do it and you would, you would you do that shit, you know, like I was talking about where it'd be like, you know, uh, if you're picking up somebody luggage, you know, straight up to do your trapezius there, but you wouldn't do the middle of your back, your lower back or anything. Your shoulders would get pulled forward and up and then you'd be benching like that and then eventually you'd blow out your fucking rotator cuff. So I now know not to do that. I'm still not benching. I'd bench now I do like, uh, eventually I'm just going to do like dumbbells cause it allows your shoulders to move independently, you know?

Speaker 1:          00:34:44       Uh, so you're not married to one shoulder or the other, you know, it's almost like, you know, the different holiday differential works and your car right. It allows both wheels in the back to turn independently. So one doesn't get fucking around the turns fast than the other for your mechanics out there. Um, so I was watching this guy at the gym today and, uh, like the lat pull down is the big fucking exercise that I need to do. If I'm eventually going to get back to doing, be able to handle my body weight to do a polyp again so I can, when my bet of being able to do 10 of those when I'm 70, um, I have less than 20 years before him 70. If you could fucking believe it. That's how fast life goes by. Started this podcast, it was only 30 days.

Speaker 1:          00:35:31       Um, so this guy comes in, he's probably my age, but in my vein, Venus, I probably thinks he's like five years older than me, but I do that a lot where I think people are 10 years older than me. They'd like three years younger than me and it's obviously not because the way I look, it's my fucking vanity. So, uh, this guy, he, I think he's in a hurry or whatever, but he was doing these lat fucking pull downs and it was like, rather than sitting up, you know, sitting up straight, shoulders down and back and then not letting your shoulders coming up, standing up, grabbing the bar and then coming down. And I do, you know, explode down one, two and then one, two, three, four going up, right with weight that you can handle, keeping your shoulders down and back. This fucking guy was doing almost the whole stack.

Speaker 1:          00:36:18       And what, how he would get it down was as he brought it down, he would like lean back and then he would, he would use the momentum of leaning back and then pull it down. And I took video. Really, I would never show this guy in the internet, but just to show my trainer and I was just like, just out of curiosity, what muscles is this person actually working instead of their lats? Cause it's the lat pull down and the person looked at it and said he's working his triceps, his groin, and he's on his way to having a herniated disc. And I got to tell you the amount of fucking people that I've, I've seen in, and I'm not trying to be, you know, I know a couple, I know my form now, so I'm trying to be like to Snob at the gym.

Speaker 1:          00:37:01       I'm just letting you guys know, having worked through this fucking injury for the last two years, because I was that guy, I was never quite that bad, but my shoulders were up and all that and I had this big fucking problem. Um, that ended up being a blessing because I found out how fucked up my body was and I needed to get it all twisted and I'll, you know, fucking yoked and all these different places and now I'm trying to build it back up again. But, uh, I was always one of those people like, why am I going to get a personal trainer? Like, I would always just look at somebody doing an exercise and be like, oh, what's that for? Okay, I'll try those. And I, I, it's fucking pointless unless you get the form down. So you really should get a trainer. And then I imagined trainers are just like comedians where you know, you have your top 10%, the David tells the Dave Chappelle's those level and then you got a bunch of fucking Dick joke hacks out there that you've got to make sure that you have like the right fucking person.

Speaker 1:          00:37:58       Um, and I guess the red flag would be if they just said, hey, do this exercise. And they didn't work too much on your form. Um, make sure you get somebody that, that teaches you the form and all of that. And uh, so you don't hurt yourself in an end up in the situation that I'm in. And that poor bastard at the gym, I wanted to say something to him, but he had like this fucking crazy type A, I'm in a fucking rush. Fibe I think I have a, I'm not gonna say, it's almost like telling somebody that they're working out wrong is almost like going up to somebody you don't know and giving them advice on how to raise their kid. I feel like this, what do you guys think? And it's just something you don't do. I think if you will like a personal trainer, you almost have to come in like an apology. Amen. Not trying to get in your kitchen here, buddy, but, uh, you're gonna, you're gonna get a herniated disc doing that.

Speaker 2:          00:38:57       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:38:57       But then [inaudible] going to have to like go into his ego and be it, hey, take half of what you're lifting and then do it the right way. And I just don't think he's, you know, you know what back doctors need business to, why the fuck am I going to get involved? You know, what am I good am I go there and start mansplaining and then all of a sudden the lesbians at the gym and the feminist start yelling. I actually should say lesbian, I should say feminists. Right?

Speaker 2:          00:39:23       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:39:24       I'm sure there's some openminded lesbians out there that wouldn't mind a little lat pulldown fucking a

Speaker 5:          00:39:32       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:39:33       Explanation.

Speaker 2:          00:39:36       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:39:37       All right. If you were confused by that, don't worry. I was to, okay, let's get into the questions for the week here.

Speaker 5:          00:39:43       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:39:46       All right. Fresh box. Okay, wait, wait. Let me see here. Okay, bill, great emails for the week. A fresh box 23. Got a lot of responses. Your request for advice for the 23 year old virgin in London with strict parents.

Speaker 5:          00:40:00       Uh,

Speaker 1:          00:40:02       I only included responses from chicks because

Speaker 1:          00:40:06       that's who you asked, uh, to get emails in from a, but it should be noted about 50 guys wrote in with their advice. Responses are from around the world with different advice. Yeah, I figured, you know, women would know better. So anyways, there's this woman, she's 23. She's working on her goddamn doctorate or something crazy like that and she wants to know she's a virgin. She wants to know how to get out there and meet a nice fella instead of, uh, some guy on Tinder I believe is, is the bad dating site. If that's a reference. I hear younger comics using all right. Fresh buckets. Here we go. Here's some women helping out fresh box 23, uh okay. Cause cause her vagina's fresh as in any dirty dicks in there. And she's 23 years old. That's right. Fresh box. 23 was in the subject. Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:40:52       All right. Clam podcast listener. All right. Uh, hey there, Bilbo Baggins. I'm a fellow clam podcast listener of responding to the 23 year old lady who wrote on your Monday morning podcasts. Uh, don't go on them. Don't go on them dating apps. Most of them just want to bang or they are closet gay men or they are serial killers who still live with their moms. I also did not date until my mid twenties for the same reason and I found that the most effective way to meet guys was to get a bunch of single girlfriends and go speed dating. You get to meet these

Speaker 3:          00:41:34       men in the flesh and see them sweating in their shirts awkwardly. Palming they're sweaty drinks. Where do you go? Speed dating? Uh, it's funny and endearing and you'll have a better chance getting matched to a human being. The fact that they were nervous. I would think that there, there's something about, and that they're a better guy, you know, I can't say it better guy, but then you don't want to be all nervous when they're going out in the job world. It's a difficult, difficult thing trying to pick the right person anyways. Other options are to join a church group that does charity work or meet affairs at good day. You meet somebody or as a fellow studious working professional, it's school but don't bang anyone at work. That's how I am now. That's how I met my now soon to be ex husband. Oh my God, she just gave all of this great advice and then you have a failed relationship at the end.

Speaker 3:          00:42:28       What is she supposed to do? I think there was some good things there. Do you want a church group that does charity work? Maybe not to the church if you're not into that shit, do some charity work. But then, uh, just make sure you, you have your vet, cause that's also where I would think a psycho Miko to try to get some, you know, some open minded slash a little naive when it comes to street smarts. Always have your guard up. Uh, oh, did I mention I saw that movie eighth grade? Did I tell you that? And I, I need, I went to go see it. I didn't even know Bo Burnham directed it. I just heard it was good and God damn it, I wanted to see a movie and I went to go see it. And it's, it's fucking great. It's great. There's one scene in there that is excruciating to watch. But I think it's important that, uh,

Speaker 2:          00:43:18       you know,

Speaker 3:          00:43:20       like preteen, teen girls see it. Uh, cause there's, it's really a, I dunno, it's fucking brutal slot creatures out there. All right. But it, it doesn't get, you know, it gets creepy enough, but not to the point where you're like, I wish I never saw this fucking movie. Um,

Speaker 2:          00:43:38       okay.

Speaker 3:          00:43:38       But it's a, you know, the way it was handled, I thought was, was, was

Speaker 3:          00:43:43       perfect. And, uh, it's quite to see a fucking comedian out there directing a movie that good. Huh? Everybody thinks all we could do is jump around talking about our dicks. Look at that. Look at Boalt burner. Crushing it. Um, so go check that out. Support a fellow comedian and support cinema. Live cinema. Uh, all right. Fresh box 23. Hey, Billy bobbled Dick. That's a great one. I frigging love your podcast. You're truly the inner monologue in my head for almost every scenario in my life. I find myself in, I'm a 29 year old front door, right?

Speaker 2:          00:44:17       Sure.

Speaker 3:          00:44:20       Jada have dude, Dorchester, mass at m, a biology student in a committed relationship. My advice to this broad from England looking for love dating apps or what I would describe as a last resort, and I believe that's something that I suggested to her. Maybe I'm just old school. But the reality is most people are dating apps are most people in real life these days. Uh, what you see on bumble is what you see in real life. There's not really one app that's better than the other. They all house most of the Douche baggery in the world. So what's the difference? Meet people platonically is what I would suggest. Who wants a baby daddy from Tinder? All right, well how did she do this? But Hey, who am I to judge? Get some girlfriends. Then they introduce you to single friends at a fucking barbecue or some shit like that.

Speaker 3:          00:45:14       I do know some girlfriends who have met their husbands off dating sites, but hey, come to think of it. Their husbands seriously suck. Seriously suck. Just so many dicks on so many levels. All right. So I think dating apps is out. That's what I've learned so far. Keep on keeping on. I can't wait to see it. The garden. Oh wait, wait. That's it. So what was your advice? Okay. Basically stay away from the dating apps. It seems like he get with a group of girlfriends, you go out in a herd, there's the guys are in the tall grass peaking up, waiting to find a weak one. And I guess somehow your, I dunno. Anyways. Um,

Speaker 3:          00:45:57       right. Let me just read the rest of this. Keep on keeping on. I can't wait to see it. The guide in October, Bill, you red headed stepchild and Hey England broad, it's, it'll get easier. Just stick your tits out there and it, it's like flies to honey. You'll quickly realize how easy it is. Uh, all right. There's a lot of advice and a lot of different directions in there, but you know she's studying biology. She's from Dorchester, so she's getting a lot of mixed signals, sir. All right, fresh. Brock's 23 from our lady. The ability, big tense. I just finished listening to your podcast of August 6th and I have a few suggestions for the girl who's late to the dating game. I'm only 21 but I'm certainly not fresh out of the box that I know a few things. Number one, use bumble, not Tinder. Okay. Now she's saying she's saying a dating app on bumble. The girls have to message first so you could do some flirting.

Speaker 4:          00:46:49       Okay.

Speaker 3:          00:46:50       Oh, so you can do all the for flirting. You could do some filtering out of due to seem creepy without feeling pressured to respond to a message. Tinder is good. If you want to get laid, if you're trying to weed out the guys who just want to get their dicks wet, tell them you're saving yourself until marriage. You can always change your mind later. Uh, quote. Oh, so you just tell him you saving yourself till marriage and that just makes a bunch of good. Most of the guys will just, who are just looking to get laid. I guess we'll leave you alone anyways. Number two, my friends love to pimp me out. I'm sure if you asked yours, they would, two, three, like bill said, find an activity. Lots of cities have sports leagues that could, that could be a good place to spark to start.

Speaker 3:          00:47:33       Thanks and go fuck yourself. I really think out of all the advice that I just read there, I would say stay away from all dating apps and I, you need to get a hobby. You need to carve out some time, some social time and like, you know, some sort of sport, charity work, um, a cooking class. Just get yourself out there where it's like, those are really good. I feel like there's a lot of a decent people in those things. Sports, you know, he could find the controlling type a dick, but you know that guy. Who else is going to crush it a lot of times in the real world. So depends on if you want an in ground pool or not. I don't know what you're looking for. Um, but they go, there is some advice for you. Good luck and don't settle. All right.

Speaker 3:          00:48:23       Don't settle for guys. Be a dick. Fuck him. There's this, you know, the, the, there's going to be a good guy out there for you. You don't ever have to fucking sell. Send it back. It's votes too cold. All right. Black Guy's perspective on stand your ground. I dear bill, I hope you the lovely Nia and the tet talented toddler are doing well. All right. First off, there's a lot of white guys saying they're black guys on the Internet, so we'll see how this goes. Uh, or there's a lot of, uh, Republicans saying they're Democrats and vice versa. You know, I'm a Republican and I got to say no, I hate Donald Trump. And I'm a Republican. They always do that shit. So who knows if this guy is black or not. But anyways, here we go. I wanted to share my opinion on the growing frustrations with situations like this and how they are handled, viewed and discuss.

Speaker 3:          00:49:10       No resist respect to you or your platform. I respect where you're coming from on this topic. I am a 28 year old, born and raised in Brooklyn. That may not mean what it used to. Uh, but I know you're familiar with what this detail implies. Imagine Boyz in the hood, but dial down to about four out of 10 that's roughly what I grew up in. I had to learn how to avoid and resolve conflicts like the one that led to that disgusting and pointless loss of life. I want to begin by disagreeing with the shooter deciding to pull the trigger. Yeah, it was ridiculous. He got pushed down on the ground. Okay. And the guy started to walk away. I personally could not pull the trigger on a person like that though I can imagine being in a position leading up to that moment. I don't want to live in a world where this behavior is condoned.

Speaker 3:          00:49:57       I'd also like to point out that people where I'm from pulled the trigger for less. Yeah. I'm not advocating that one group of people shouldn't shoot people and other people should. I'm just saying, okay. That if you yell at somebody's girlfriend or wife and the guy comes out and pushes you down to the ground, that's not a reason to use deadly force. I mean that's like, that's like wild west Shit. Um, anyways. I think all of the adults made bad choices that escalated to the situation. 100% agree with that first using the differently labeled parking when there are other available spots is a dick move? Absolutely arguing in defense of a move like that. This is even worse. This is speculation, but knowing what I know about my own people in a certain type of black woman, if I as a black man even politely said something to that woman, there is a very little chance she respond politely. And this is where, I don't know if this is a fucking white dude or a black guy, insert me in that situation on our demand would have knocked me down just like he did the white to the white guy and fuck me up. Uh, no news coverage. My own people would have said, I should have shut the fuck up. Yeah. But he didn't fuck him up. He just pushed him down and started to walk away. If he pushed him down and started swinging on him.

Speaker 3:          00:51:16       Um, I gotta be honest even then.

Speaker 2:          00:51:19       Okay.

Speaker 3:          00:51:19       Even then I feel like to then pull a gun, this guy's throwing hands, don't you throw hands back is just like the untouchables. So brings a knife and you bring a gun. I mean, this is literally a fucking gas station anyways. This is why I wouldn't have said Shit. I would have minded my own business. That's the school I'm front, but that is the pro and con of where I come from. And the world in general. I suppose you mind your own business, but then you add to a culture where people disobey laws bigger, small, and no one is supposed to stand up for decency. Though it is not hurting anyone in that usual scent. It's not cool to park in those spots and it shouldn't be tolerated. Yes. But shouldn't that guy of step to the guy, you know, rather than waiting to the guy leaves in the yells at the woman, then he put, he kind of put them in that fucking macho position to stick up for his lady. Yeah. Everybody was wrong in that, you know, but I mean to then turn around and fucking shoot that guy, I mean it's just, it's as he's, you know, starts to walk away. It's just fucking insane. And he was the black, I should not have initiated the physical contact. Uh, never wound what? You can't kill.

Speaker 3:          00:52:34       Uh, or the black version. Don't start shit. You can't finish. Um, it didn't even look like he tried to dissolve the conflict in another way. Also, you never know what a stranger is carrying legal weaponry or otherwise. Yeah, that's true. In New York everything is illegal, but that doesn't stop anyone. The black guy was about to stop that white man out. Do you think that, cause I thought he pushed him down and then walked away. I recognize that body language anywhere. He only backed up after seeing the gun. At which point the entire situation should have been over. That's another thing. He could have waved the gun at him. I'm not saying that the lady driving the car or that guy did everything right, but to just fucking shoot the guy. Um,

Speaker 2:          00:53:21       okay.

Speaker 3:          00:53:22       It's not somebody who, who, who continues to charge when they a gun. I'm a detailed, I'd like to point out is that the black guy did not put his hands up when the white man pulled on him. This is because we, black men have to look bad ass to matter this or I don't fucking know about this shit.

Speaker 2:          00:53:40       Yeah,

Speaker 3:          00:53:41       I dunno, but I dunno who fucking wrote this.

Speaker 3:          00:53:46       You said, this is because we, black men have to look bad ass. No matter the circumstances. Whoever my hands would bent so high in the air, I could have tickled God's feet. The white guys supposedly known for fucking with people over disabled parking spots. He also supposedly mentally unstable. If those are facts, he shouldn't have been on the street or allowed to carry a fucking gun. Yeah, well that's another thing too. They, I actually do a bit about this, how they shut down and not houses. When I was a kid, you will fucking crazy. They put you in the nut house and you combine the fact that not houses, they just have those people walking down the street now and people who are into guns don't want to wait more than 15 minutes to get one. You're going to have a fucking problem anyways. None of this shit should have happened.

Speaker 3:          00:54:30       I'm tired of seeing my people, especially men die over dumb shit and it only becomes news if there is a white person involved. Also, men have to rise above getting into goofy arguments on behalf of women, especially when they're wrong. She's likely not going to get hurt, but you, you are as a dude. Yeah, that is true. Not sure if you can feel where I'm coming from, but I want to make my fellow black men to be smarter and safer. Kids need their father's best of fan for Brooklyn. Ps met you once at the beacon theater show. We'll see you at MSG. You are awesome. Well, thank you very much. I agree with everything that you said there. Uh, although I don't think it, it looked like he was gonna stop him out, as you said. I also think that all you need, you just take out a gun. If you take out a gun, everybody fucking runs. I don't know why that guy didn't fucking broad. That'd be it. Just stunned. Although I remember being at a meet and greet one of the last ones I did and this guy fucking went to take a picture of his girlfriend or wife wanted a picture with me and he went to reach into, pull out his camera in a fucking loaded nine millimeter fell on the floor.

Speaker 2:          00:55:40       Yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:55:40       And this is how I reacted. I went whoa. And pointed at it. Then he picked it up.

Speaker 2:          00:55:48       Yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:55:48       And ran out of there because we were in a casino and it was on native American land and you're not allowed. It turned out he was an off duty cop. You know, they kind of fucking handled it. But I remember saying to the security guys at Jesus Christ, I go, you fucking see that. He goes, what happened? I go up, fucking guy, just, I had a loaded nine millimeter, just fell on the ground and the security guy goes, oh, he's lucky I didn't see that. And I was like an almost 10 in the, but, um, that's where my, my culdesac suburban upbringing came into effect where that was my first with that. So I was stunned. But now I've played that over my head a zillion times over.

Speaker 5:          00:56:28       Okay.

Speaker 3:          00:56:28       That ever happens again? Kick the fucking gut wall. If it's a glock, you know, she can kick it. Anything else that might go off? I, I tackle the guy. Run anything other than be like, oh, your gun's right there, sir. Um, all right.

Speaker 2:          00:56:43       Okay.

Speaker 3:          00:56:43       Uh, out of everything you said, I really, truly believe that whole, the reason why I don't fuck with people, aside from the fact that I'm, I'm half a century old and you know, never really took any martial arts. I, you don't know what the fuck you're running into.

Speaker 2:          00:57:00       Okay.

Speaker 3:          00:57:01       You have no fucking idea that training, the weaponry, the level of psycho, the kind of day they're having.

Speaker 5:          00:57:08       MMM.

Speaker 3:          00:57:09       If a loved one just passed away, you have no idea what's going on to somebody fucking life and you are rolling the fucking dice with your life when you make a move like that.

Speaker 5:          00:57:19       And um,

Speaker 3:          00:57:21       which I owned it, I understand, but I think it is fucking insane that there's a state out there that allows citizens like the fucking wild west to solve their problems like that. You know?

Speaker 2:          00:57:36       Okay.

Speaker 3:          00:57:36       That you could just shoot an unarmed guy that pushed you down on the ground. It's just fucking, it's just, it's, that's such some shit out of like Wyatt Earp, you know, and I, I, you know, all your gun guys are going to flip out. Okay. Just just picture how the, imagine the, like the average fucking person drives.

Speaker 2:          00:57:55       Okay.

Speaker 3:          00:57:56       Just watch the average person go through a fucking security line at the airport.

Speaker 2:          00:58:02       Okay.

Speaker 3:          00:58:02       The amount of awareness, the amount of empathy, the mouth, a mouth breather and fucking morons. And the fact that any of them can go out and get a fucking gun and then stand their ground using debt. Fucking 20 year old laptop between their ears. That is their fucking brain. I mean, that is some crazy, crazy level of fucking second degree. I mean, second Second Amendment fucking freedom. That usually leads to fucking second degree murder as far as [inaudible]. And I am, I am not an anti gun guy, but I am also like, you know, I just don't want people, you know, walking around like they're in fucking Westworld.

Speaker 5:          00:58:49       MMM.

Speaker 3:          00:58:51       All right. Girlfriend's parents know in defense of Florida, you don't see that every day though. You know, you do not see that everyday. So I don't know if they'd be, there's already, there's always arguments on both sides. Girlfriend's parents know, hey bill, I'm 17 going into my senior year of high school and I'm dating this amazing girl who's about to be a Jew. Yeah. Uh, she's half black, half Filipino, Filipina IA is that he said Filipino. Um, I'm a few days darker. I'm a few shades days, few shades darker than a piece of printer paper. Anyways, uh, Hey, welcome to the club buddy. Anyways, we'd been dating for about a month now and obviously we've hooked up a couple of times and neither one of our parents even knew,

Speaker 5:          00:59:44       uh,

Speaker 3:          00:59:45       a couple of days ago her parents asked her if I was a virgin and for some God unknown reason, she told them that I had been with a couple of other girls during high school. That wasn't a big deal until today when they started asking if her and I had ever had sex.

Speaker 3:          01:00:11       Apparently she didn't get the female line gene and told them everything. Well, I mean, sounds like she has a really open relationship with their parents. I don't know what to do. I'm sure as a dad you can imagine what you would do to a guy. In my position and her dad is six foot four 260 pound black dude, I'm about six foot two one 60 on a good day. So I'm not stacking up well against that. I'm not looking forward to going back over to our house and talking to her parents or meeting her older brother that's coming to town on Monday. Any advice from you and Nia and how to not get killed would be great. Yeah.

Speaker 5:          01:00:52       MMM

Speaker 3:          01:00:54       yeah, dude. I would be a fucking man about it and I would go over there and just be honest. Just say what you'd done and how you feel about her daughter and then what? What are they gonna give me? What are you going to do?

Speaker 3:          01:01:12       I, I don't, I dunno. I Dunno. How old are you? Is is how old? You're 17 okay. See, I don't know what the fucking hell. How old is your girlfriend? Do? Don't listen to me. I Dunno what the fuck to do. I don't know what to do now. You got me all fucking nervous. I would have to think that if she fucking, if he asked her, they asked her what she's doing and she was just honest about it. They seem a little fucking open minded. Like if, if, if, I dunno, this is crazy thing to say, but if, if she knew that he was going to flip out and try to fucking kill you, why would she say something? Uh, she could be scared of him. I Dunno dude, you got yourself into a little bit of a quagmire. I have no idea. I have no idea, dude.

Speaker 2:          01:02:03       Okay.

Speaker 3:          01:02:03       I would go over there and when he says,

Speaker 2:          01:02:06       hmm,

Speaker 3:          01:02:07       what's up little man, I'd be like, Hey, um, you know, I guess that's when, as a man, you get into your hypocritical years

Speaker 1:          01:02:21       when you meet another guy who is doing or trying to do exactly what the fuck you were doing when you were 17. It doesn't sound like you'll be a running around trying to dog at the checks and do all of this type of shit. I don't fucking know. You know what? I don't know. I don't fucking know. And now I'm thinking of what's going to happen when my daughter gets that fucking age. I have no idea.

Speaker 4:          01:02:44       I have no idea. Um,

Speaker 1:          01:02:48       all I know is that I'm hoping she's at least going to be a brown belt in Jiu Jitsu, you know, which I actually, I, I, you know, I think every woman should learn that shit.

Speaker 4:          01:02:58       You know,

Speaker 1:          01:03:00       it's perfect. It's in close. And if a guy's, you know, doing something you don't want them to do, it's so fucking easy.

Speaker 4:          01:03:07       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:03:08       Armbar get them in a triangle because there, you know what the fuck, you know, choke 'em out and then just call the cops. There he is. It's perfect.

Speaker 4:          01:03:17       You know,

Speaker 1:          01:03:20       I don't fucking know. I, anyways, Jesus' question. I get me thinking all this crazy shit. I, all I can say is good luck to you sir. And, uh, you've got some decisions to make. I mean, what, don't you want to keep seeing this woman? I mean, what are you going to do? I feel like you kinda gotta go over there, so the guy respects you. Then what's he gonna do? Six foot four. He's gonna beat the shit out of a 17 year old. Wait a minute. You're not Florida, are you? If you're in Florida, don't go over there cause he might stand his ground. All right. I gotta go you guys. Uh, thank you so much. You're awesome for writing in all you women who wrote in. All you ladies are rolled in. I really appreciate that because I wanted to give that woman some good advice and we needed to hear it from the ladies. Um, I'm going to be in Las Vegas this weekend with Joe. Nick, I'm flying out in the fucking helicopter and then the day after I'm getting up, before I go home, I'm flying over to Utah to fly through some like fucking canyons and all this shit that I'm coming back. It's going to be fucking incredible. And I'm picking up eight hours on the stick, creeping towards 200. That'll get me up to about a buck 85. Okay.

Speaker 4:          01:04:21       MMM.

Speaker 1:          01:04:24       And, uh, I'm very, very excited and I've decided that I want to get my instrument rating as a pilot. Cause every pilot I talked to is like, that is a fucking game changer. I just have to carve out some time where I can do it. And I figure if Tom Cruise could figure out how to point it at the ground and do fucking three sixties as he stored it, goddammit, I could get my instrument rating. All right. That's it. Go Fuck Yourself. I'll check in on you on Thursday.
