Speaker 1:          00:00:01       Hey, what's going on? It's bill bar and a, it's time for the, uh, Thursday afternoon, Monday morning podcast just before Friday. And I am just checking in on you. How are you guys doing? I you having a good day. All right. Day vindication baby. Ah, fuck. Finally. Finally shut. Nall you sports. Sportsbar conch, right the fuck up in the back of your dumb fucking heads. You knew this was the, you knew, you knew he was innocent. You can't, not even innocent. I'm just saying he gives the whole fucking thing was so fun. It was so fucking stupid. You are pisses me off. Obviously. I'm talking about the Tom Brady decision here. Um, which doesn't even say that he's innocent of all the fucking deflate gate shit, which pisses me off. It's just says that the commissioner didn't execute article 46 on a proper ran or let the court date.

Speaker 1:          00:01:03       But I need a scalable whenever, I guess article 46 has to do with what the, the, the steps to commissioner is supposed to take when he fucking goes to suspend a player. Evidently, I guess I don't fucking know. So basically they didn't have a fucking case and he tried to fucking rubber stamp his way through it. I still, I can't believe it man. I thought the court was going to go inside with the fucking, I really did, but fortunately they didn't end. Um, I dunno. I mean is happy as I am that it's, it's over. What was, it was a huge distraction to the team and it was a big fucking waste of time. And uh, I actually saw on Twitter another Boston guy, uh, Donny Walberg goes, okay, now what about all those draft picks we lost? Which is a great fucking point that I didn't see anybody else bring up.

Speaker 1:          00:01:56       Everybody's sitting at skipping down the street cause Brady's going to be playing, but we still got fucked out of all those draft picks. Dude. How successful are the Patriots that they are getting fucked with to this goddamn level? How much of a bunch of fucking babies is everybody in the, not everybody, but I'll the higher ups in the cults organization grow a fucking Dick. You lost a game to fucking drag it through. This whole thing make literally turned it into fucking an episode of Falcon Crest or dynasty. I'll go with dynasty. I never watched either one of those shows, but it always seemed like somebody was getting thrown in a pool right there, dress and makeup on whatever. I've gotta be honest with you. I don't even have any fucking, I don't even give a shit if you're honest with you. I don't even give a fuck. Once I saw that he got four games and then the fifth game, when he was coming back, they were going to be playing against the colts. It was just like, is this like a fucking soap opera? I don't know. I got that same queasy feeling when I used to watch the NF one. I was watching the NBA in the two thousands and I sit there telling

Speaker 2:          00:03:00       my friends, go on this game. This game is fucking fixed. And then that got to the point of saying the NBA is fixed. And of course it was, ah, you got your tin hat on. You're fucking, you're a conspiracy theorist. And what do they do? They find a fucking mobbed up ref. Who's throwing fucking games

Speaker 1:          00:03:15       and then I go, well, there you go. I'm vindicated. Right? And everybody's like, well, it's just one guy. Oh yeah. It's just one guy. It's always just one guy. That fucking Guy Oswald. Right. It's always just one fucking guy, Oliver north. It's just why Ollie north, he put the whole fucking thing to get. It's always, it's always just one guy.

Speaker 2:          00:03:37       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:03:38       Let me tell you something. If a, if you're involved in something and you don't feel like you're getting all the information from your other fucking criminals, just know that you're, you're going to be the guy. If Shit goes down, you're the guy going to be left holding the fucking bag. They always had that. Any smart criminal fucking organization always has the guy who's going to be left holding the bag just in case. Just in case the shit hits the fan. Who's a bad guy? All the north fuck. And we said Oliver Stone, they're fucking, what's his face there? Old Shot in the gut. Lee Harvey Oswald.

Speaker 3:          00:04:17       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:04:19       And a whatever. I ain't want to, I can't remember what my fucking point was. Why would you listen to this shit? I don't give a fuck. I gotta be honest with you. I thought that, uh, I gave, I stopped giving a shit I think like three months ago when they, when I found out he was appealing it and then he had to appeal it to the guy who fucking suspended them. I'm like, Gee, do you think he's gonna win this one? And, uh, once they gave him a four game suspension, I was just like, I, you know, whatever. I was actually, I was the guy going, hey, he shouldn't suspend. He shouldn't appeal it. Just take the suspension, become a fucking martyr, rest up, you're 38 year old bones and come back and, and uh,

Speaker 2:          00:04:55       game five. And I also thought there was no fucking way that he was going to win it because I read something where they said that they usually side with the decision made by the arbitrators. So, uh, I'm whatever, I'm happy that it happened, but I also don't really give a shit who gives a fuck. You know what I mean? It's, it's a whole leaks become a fucking joke. We've got a female ref that got a female coach. Why? Because they give a fuck about women. No, cause they're doing damage control because of the ray rice thing. They don't give a shit about women. I give a fuck about anything. Right. They give a shit about money. So they're wearing pink for an entire fucking month. I don't even know what it is anymore. Right. And Dude, I called it as far as he would say.

Speaker 1:          00:05:40       So with all these concussions and all of that type of shit and now they got all the women coming into the NFL. I'm calling it right now, within 10 to 15 years, the combination of the damage that this game does does, and the female

Speaker 3:          00:05:54       mmm

Speaker 1:          00:05:56       intellect being brought into the game,

Speaker 4:          00:05:59       this dumb game. That's awesome. Where guys bash each other's brains in will become a much more intelligent game of flag football. I think that that's what's going to happen. They're gradually, they're just getting rid of all the dumb shit that makes men great, which is hurting one another in a competitive way. They're going to get rid of all of it. They fucking with hockey. They got to get fighting at a hockey. They're going to get a bunch of women in the fucking, the NFL. They'll start wearing pink all four fucking months. They'll have flags, you know, maybe play a little two hand touch. They'll start with offensive and defensive lineman starting in the standup position so they don't smash into each other. And um,

Speaker 1:          00:06:50       and I dunno, then they'll have some new, hey, hey, hey, take it easy fucking rules. They'll just keep whittling away at it. And in the end, by the time I'm in my eighties, the NFL and the NHL that I watched will be like, I used to go to the Roman Colosseum and watch Christians getting thrown to the fucking lions. But you know what? I got to tell you this. It was a hell of a run.

Speaker 2:          00:07:14       Was there a hell of a run?

Speaker 1:          00:07:16       You know, they got all women, uh, sports talk shows now.

Speaker 2:          00:07:21       Okay,

Speaker 1:          00:07:22       they're going to fucking just through pressure alone, whether they're good or not, everyone's going to be so afraid of being called sexist. They're going to those, they're going to take over the Terry Bradshaw, Howie long shows. It'll be all women, all women coaches. It'll be all women all the time wearing pink and it'll be, it'll be a completely different

Speaker 2:          00:07:45       thank it's over. It was a hell of a fucking run. You know, a lot of guys got hurt, but a god damn it, it was entertaining and now it's over. So what are you going to do? It's a new era. Just sit back and find that view.

Speaker 1:          00:08:09       Ah, fuck me. Good Lord. How do you fuck up a good thing?

Speaker 2:          00:08:15       How do you fuck up a great thing like that? Um, anyways, I'm just giving the lady shit. We all know the biggest lady out. There's Jim or say Jesus Christ. You know, he's fucking fucking hide his face right now behind a a little parasol. Xe fucking runs into his office. Twirling the thing crying. Yeah.

Speaker 5:          00:08:44       Fuck you

Speaker 2:          00:08:48       fucking baby fucking unbelief. I have been holding my so bad. Let's not talk about Jim or say, let's just talk about, let's just go fucking random here.

Speaker 1:          00:09:01       All right, for all you patriot haters out there, let's just say your next door neighbor was a drug addict. Okay? Who had a dead mistress and for some reason he thought your fence was too much on, on his side of the property, even though you had a fucking God damn, whatever. Yeah, that's what happened. It's like you put a coat of paint on it and that extra coat of paint because you didn't strip it down to the, would you put that extra coat of paint on it? And that just started to creep in end to the other guy's property. Let's just say that. Does your next door neighbor who's a drug addict and as a dead mistress hires a guy who isn't a doctor but says he is one to build a case against you and let's just say for some fucking reason it's upheld and you stand to lose $2 million with any of that make any fucking sense to you.

Speaker 1:          00:09:56       And furthermore, when you appealed it and then the entire thing got reversed, wouldn't you just be like, well yeah, that's kind of what it took the NFL seven months to do. I feel um, unfucking believable. Unfucking believable. Now, having said that, I think it's going to be a hell of a a year in the AFC east. I think. Uh, I'm loving rex Ryan coming back with the bills and he has a defense. I think, uh, all the people that think that he's learned something from talking shit are, are, are dopes. Uh, Rex Ryan has not learned anything. Rex Ryan is Rex Ryan. All right. And he's always going to be rex Ryan and less he loses his defense. Then he slumped his shoulders and tries to act like he's a class act. He isn't, I'm not saying he doesn't have class, but he's not a quiet guy. He said guy fucking talking with his mouth full with spaghetti sauce on the front of his shirt.

Speaker 1:          00:10:54       That's just two years. And you know what? You need that fucking guy. You don't want to look at him when he's eating. But other than that, he's a fun guy to have around. So I'm, I'm predicting right now without even looking at the schedule, without even knowing a fucking thing, I'm going to say that we split with the bills and when the bills, when probably when the first one or whatever I am go, I predict that a rex Ryan is going to talk, not all kinds of shit. He will make some sort of comment and you will see that manic look on his face. Um, it'll probably, I don't know, I'll probably say something dumb

Speaker 2:          00:11:31       about one and this one of the Superbowl or some stupid shit like that. And uh, and as always, Bill Belicheck will be looked at as a dud as a guy who's a, you know, socially inept and all that type of shit. I love when people buy into the fucking press wine in about that, you know, fucking Bella check is a hot shit. He's just smart enough not to talk to those fucking cons in the press. He knows that. He says they're

Speaker 1:          00:11:54       going to twist around and it's just going to be used as, as a, you know, what do they call it? Fucking bullet of board material. Bill Bellacheck said this about you guys, who does, who respect you. That's why every fucking week I don't give a shit. If he was going to play a bunch of standup Comedians, full pads, he still be like, well, you know, any given Sunday anybody can win. And uh, you know, you know, the second day leave you fucking breaks out a Stogie and a scotch, right? Start just telling stories. Um, I'm just saying, all right, just because somebody wrote it a set, it doesn't mean it's true. Do you know some asshole in Twitter? I don't know if he's being an asshole. He sent me a thing saying, hey bill, you should go back to drinking because according to this study,

Speaker 3:          00:12:41       uh,

Speaker 1:          00:12:43       you know, taking time off from drinking does not cleanse your liver and actually might be detrimental to your health. So I click on it, Click Bait. Fuck it. I can't resist. I'm weak mentally. I click on the shit, right? We, uh, I go to it and I read and it's just some woman talking to one doctor who just says a bunch of vague shit

Speaker 1:          00:13:06       about like, if, you know, if you normally drink or whatever, if you would just to stop cold Turkey that yet, blah, blah, blah, blah, Blah blue. It was, so I just wrote back yet one dope talks to one doctor, get the facts, the whole article, just, it just reeked of being a study funded by somebody who sells alcohol. And he could see how when they use the quotes from the doctor, it was always like dot, dot, dot. Something that guy said. Dot, dot, dot. So they just take a little fucking clip of it. He was probably doing that thing, you know, where they say like, one glass of wine every day is actually healthy. And, uh, then they just, you know, a cross examine, well, let's say somebody was to stop drinking that glass of wine and was to eat McDonald's every day. Then would that be a good, healthy thing?

Speaker 1:          00:13:55       And then the doctor's like, yeah, well, you get all of that instance. I imagine that, uh, you know, if you were eating a hive transfats food add, uh, you did not have that glass of wine that will, I mean you would probably be better off with the, uh, your arteries being clogged up by the Trans fats. You probably want a little bit alcohol and come in there, right. Uh, clean it out. So at that point, yeah. Yes. I would venture a guess that that would be detrimental. And then they take all of that shit and then they just say, taking one glance, you know, knocking off booze could be detrimental. Give me a fucking break. I know I don't need a goddamn study to tell me that. Taking a fucking 70 days off from drinking is, is is good or bad for my liver. I see the results.

Speaker 1:          00:14:40       I did a Gig with Versie like in the beginning of May and he came walking in his skin look amazing space. It came at oh first he was glowing. He goes, do it. Been crushing it. I haven't been, I haven't drank in five days. I'm like, dude, I can see it in your face. Your face is already thinner and it look, your skin looks clear. I've got to look at some fucking study. Now look, I'm not saying that you can drink like a fucking animal like I did and then take 75 days off or whatever, and then you have a brand new liver. I'm not a fucking dope. I know that. It's like I'd beat the shit out of a car. All right? But you know what? I didn't beat the shit out of it and 75 days. So rather than the fucking car being 75 more days beat on it, stopped at whatever fucking number I beat on it. You know I get it. Look, oh, you guys are, do you know some of you guys? What you're doing to me is the same thing that they do to the Patriots. You see me get into towards the fucking brass ring of 162 pounds. So now you starting to hate on me. I get it. You see me becoming a champion right before your very ears on this

Speaker 2:          00:15:48       podcast. Actually, I got to tell you this, I'm taking a loss this week. I'm already calling it on Thursday. There's no way I'm getting down to one 62. Um, I got busy this week and then also I was just feeling it. My bones, like I took a day off, then I go take another day off, give you body arrest. Uh, just try to eat as well as you can, which I did. And then today I went to the gym.

Speaker 3:          00:16:11       Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:16:12       Went down there and I trued to fucking weights around, did 45 minutes of cardio and I'm right back on it, right back on it again. Um, so

Speaker 3:          00:16:22       okay.

Speaker 2:          00:16:22       Weighed my cell was like a buck 66 and change after the fucking workout. So I think by Sunday I may be, I can be like one 65, one 64, so whatever, it's, what am I do quick? Am I going to start crying, like fucking gym or say and have rules change. That one 64 now means one 62. Now. I'm not, I'm a, I'm just now, my goal is to get down to one 64 and then the week after

Speaker 1:          00:16:45       down to one 62 and then I did it, you know, and then that's it. I'll buy myself a little fucking a championship ring instead of a, a fucking smoking a cigar. I'm going to have one of those cakes,

Speaker 2:          00:16:57       those lollipop cakes. I didn't know what those things are called, but those things are the funniest God damn thing ever to me. Cake on a stick. You know what I mean? Like that's one of those things where you're just a fat fuck. If you eat cake on a stick, you're a fat. Fuck it. I don't want to hear like, Oh,

Speaker 1:          00:17:14       a lot smaller than it out that will fucking slice of cake. Who the fuck has a slice of cake other than on their birthday? You know what I mean? Now you just add in fucking cake on a stick cause you'd think it's smaller. There's certain things that uh, you know, I just don't have any, I have zero tolerance for cake on a stick donuts.

Speaker 3:          00:17:35       MMM.

I don't know who the fuck he those things. But anyhow, when you're just sitting there with a sugary lump a shit, like I don't have any, I don't have any sympathy for you. What are you doing?

Speaker 3:          00:17:55       Um, so anyways, uh, oh, what the fuck was I going to talk about

Speaker 1:          00:23:40       As I told you guys before, the property line down my driveway, like angles in at like a 30 degree angle. My garage was built by two different fucking people, at least one person who added to the front of it and built out the right side. And on the left side when they went to line up the right side with the left side, whether we're going to put the garage doors, looked straight at Clorox and realized that there was a tree there. So rather than removing the tree or backing up their fucking wall, they just fucking said fuck it and put the wall behind the tree. So my garage doors are at like a 15 degree angle, which is an optical illusion as I'm trying to back this trucking, the doors have faced this way, the garage, his face the other way. And I got a wall that's closing in 30 degrees on the right.

Speaker 4:          00:24:28       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:24:29       Which is now my left as I fucking look over. It's a fucking disaster is what I'm trying to say. So anyways, I'm sitting there and I'm trying to, uh, you know, I'm into this grip strength workout. So I have, I have a pull up,

Speaker 4:          00:24:46       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:24:46       A pull up bar, Chin up bar, dip station, and it takes up a lot of space. So I'm going to put that on craigslist. I'm going to sell that thing and I'm gonna get this pull up bar. And just mounted to the wall.

Speaker 4:          00:24:57       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:24:58       All right. Then my wife wanted a speed bag, so I knew where I was going to put that. I had two cabinets that were on the floor. Those were going up on the walls. And then I have two bikes, one for me and the one that I bought my wife that she never uses. And I'm putting those on the wall. All right. And then I, I wanted to get a peg board.

Speaker 4:          00:25:14       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:25:14       All right. So I get the peg board. The only place I can mount it is at the front of the garage where that guy put that fucking Janky extension onto it because there's enough head room for my giant head if and when I'm ever strong enough to get up to the top of it. So the fucking pegboard is 36 by 36 I go down there to measure it. Right. And wouldn't, you know, 35 fucking motherfucking cunt inches in. Is this galvanize fucking useless as pipe. So I'm like, you fucking motherfucker. So I call up to come over.

Speaker 4:          00:25:51       Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:25:52       [inaudible] fucking just hack it up to shut off the water, hack it off, and then cap it right inside the wall. And he comes in and immediately he's like, oh, that's galvanized pipe. That's original to the house. And back in the day, they used to just thread those things right on the spot. So the only way for me to take that thing out was I'd have to go all the way into the walls in your house, in the ceiling all the way downstairs that you just re did. I'm like, you gotta be fucking kidding me. You just can't cut it off there. He's like, no, I can't. I can't do that. I should ask him if he could rethread it. They're the old school way, but I know they probably don't make one of those anymore. So he caps the fucking thing off with this nipple sticking out, which would then make the peg board have to be off the wall just far enough where if I went to open the garage door, that swings in, it would hit the fucking thing and then I couldn't get my truck in.

Speaker 6:          00:26:45       So

Speaker 1:          00:26:47       I'm done fighting the garage. I'm now going to try to find a peg board that isn't 36 by 36 maybe they make one that's just 24 did they make one that's just 24 and I don't want those long skinny ones because those things don't fucking work because you need like a 200 foot fucking roof, whatever. I'll look it up later. So anyways, um, I have decided that I'm going to stop fighting my garage. I'm going to get a peg board that fits there and even if I have to cut it in half and fucking customized the thing, it's what I'm going to do because I really am fascinated with that grip strength workouts. And I like,

Speaker 6:          00:27:24       yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:27:25       I just like building up muscle like that. It seems way more, I dunno appliable to my life,

Speaker 6:          00:27:33       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:27:33       That I can fucking lift my, my own body up to me is better than trying to bench 200 pounds. Like I like to try to do back in the day, which I guess is great. If a fucking rock fell on me, I could get the goddamn thing off me or I guess, but I think mostly, you know, like what, say I ever got kidnapped by that guy in silence of the lamb, then he threw me down that fucking hole. You know what I mean?

Speaker 1:          00:27:59       I would have enough fucking strength that I could go horizontal, right. And just walk my way right out of that fucking thing. Or at least to the top of the whole thing. I mean, he's got all the weapons and shit, but uh, you know, that'd be funny. You get up to top of the hole and you're fucking gassed and he's just standing there like, why is he such running at you with a fucking ex? Um, so anyway, so that got me, you know, I was, I was looking at pegboards on Youtube, which then got me into, uh, you know, those rock climbing gym. So with all those, you know, those cool holds in that type of stuff. And I watched this one woman in this German stunt, a stunt man class, just like, she literally had like chimpanzee strength. She was just flying, which one of most amazing fucking things I've ever seen. So anyways, I ended up going to this, uh, this website called atomic holds a t o m I k atomic holds. And uh,

Speaker 1:          00:29:01       I'd love to reach out to these guys to see if they'd advertise slash send me some free fucking shit is I redo my garage. Um, and all I want to do is why don't I saw this guy had, was he just had a couple of two by fours in the top of is a ceiling and then he just had like some chains and then like one of those c clamps that you could just put all these different holds on. They have like small bombs, atomic bomb missile pipe bombs, um, and you just do like pull ups on these things. And then if you get a number of them and he got a long board, you can just put a run of them together and, and, and just sort of climb from one to the other. It just seems fucking cool as shit. It's a way better way to work your core without having to get on the ground and do those old school fucking ups. So I think I'm going to do a,

Speaker 4:          00:29:49       okay,

Speaker 1:          00:29:49       I'm going to turn my garage. I'm done fighting the fucking thing. I'm done fighting it. I'm just going to, I'm going to work with the measurements that I have and I'm going to put some, uh, some of those climate holds up there and some of those, uh, missiles, pipe bombs of what they called it, just different grips. I'm going to have those hanging from the fucking ceiling and a, I'll have my pull up bar, my wife will have the speed bag and uh, that's good. And I'm going to get, uh, I flat, uh, found this great flooring from rubber flooring inc I made like a grocery list. I haven't ordered any of this shit yet, but rubber flooring inc seem to have like the best gym flooring that I could find. And uh, and once again, I don't know how I'm gonna I'm gonna have to

Speaker 4:          00:30:29       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:30:30       Cut that shit special when it goes through Sunday. I really should just take a picture of my garage. I'd just get weirded out showing people the inside of my house, even if he is the garage, if he just fucking see the, uh, uh, it's actually embarrassing. I mean, part of me just wants to have it torn down and rebuilt, but I know some, it'd be like, yeah, I can do that for about 160 grand. Can you meet me in the middle? Um, but even then, even if they were to rebuild it, oh, I'm, I'm still dealing with the property line. I'm still really limited with space. So, uh, I think I'm just gonna I'm just gonna fucking

Speaker 4:          00:31:07       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:31:07       I'm just going to work with what the fuck I have. I've done fight in the house the same way we would done fight in the house when it came to our stairs. Uh, let go from the upstairs to the downstairs at my house was originally a ranch and then they built the downstairs and they blew out a closet and that's what they sent this to the staircase through. So the, the opening is just a closet door opening. So you can't get a couch down there. You've got to bring it to the outside of the fucking house. It's just a big fucking pain in the God damn ass is all I can tell you. I've got to bring it through my fucked up garage. I got to literally care the couch down the driveway, through the garage into the backyard and then up the stairs and just, it's a fucking, it's ridiculous. So anyways, um, but I'm slowly but surely fixing all of this shit, but we just gave up on the stairs one day. We just, we just like, you know what, let's just stop fighting the stairs. The stairs are the stairs. Fuck it. So I think I might do that with the, uh, the garage, you know what I mean?

Speaker 1:          00:32:03       The garage is the garage. Fuck it. And if I can hang a bunch of shit up there and then not have to go to the gym cause I got my own fucking gym and um,

Speaker 1:          00:32:13       you know, and maybe just get one of those flat benches and I think that's all I need. Rubber flooring and then all the, all the shit that I'm going to work out with is going to be up off of the floor. So in one corner I can have all the original parts to my truck that I had taken off and then I'm just going to have the gym. Uh, that's, that is my game plan. That is my dream fucking home gym there. So, uh, but if you're thinking of doing some shit like that, and you know, if you're into American Ninja Warrior, I am not like you're going to compete in it, but you just fascinated with how fucking strong the men and women are on that thing. Uh, atomic holds is a great website, um, to go check out. And the guys, you know, go on Youtube too, if you just atomic holds and just look at videos and this guys reviewing all the different holds and that type of shit. And they also kind of tell you which ones are easy, which ones are more difficult. You get to see what they look like, you learn the names of them, and then just make a little grocery list, add a, that's what I'm going to do. I'm going to try and put this fucking thing together, you know,

Speaker 2:          00:33:16       I dunno what the fuck I'm talking about. And then he come absolutely shred. Um, for one last time as I'm sliding into 50, I'm gonna be one of those guys. Like I'm going to start dressing like Jack Lalaine if I actually get in shape, you know that onesy Fonzie fucking mechanic zip up. Um, so anyways, if anybody's done anything like that, uh, got any of those atomic holds, those things and can recommend stuff for a beginner. Uh, I just think that the, I think they're fucking awesome and I've always, I don't know why, but that level of strength I've always respected the most people can climb up a fucking rope, the fucking pegboard and all that shit. I think it's awesome. So anyways, I hope that wasn't too fucking boring for you. I'll let you guys know how the Sunday gravy goes on Monday and uh, whatever. I think it's going to be a great football season. I'm happy

Speaker 1:          00:34:04       ladies back. I know that the lawsuit's going to continue and all that type of shit and Goodell's gonna, you know, appeal. It is a lot of fucking big ego's going on here. Who? Who's kidding who, but, um, I'm glad it's over and colts fans. I want you to know I'm not shitting on you. Okay? I'm not shitting on you guys and I'm not shitting on your players. I'm just shitting on Jim or say, okay. And, uh, I don't think that we're any better than that guy is. I'm just sick of the fucking accusations. Only going one way. You know what I mean? We've only came at you one time for pumping crowd noise in. That was it. We didn't say shit about all the other stuff that I've said 9,000 times on it. So having said all that, um, I don't think the AFC east is going to be a cake walk.

Speaker 1:          00:34:50       I think the bills are going to be really fucking good. Um, I think rex Ryan is great when he's got a great defense and he has a fucking, uh, you know, somebody quarterback, they can just manage the game he's shown before. You know, he did that with the jets and they beat us in the playoffs at home. Kicked our fucking asses. So I'm going to pull a Bella check here, you know, hello. That's take anybody lightly. He'll the yes, but, um, and finally, oh, I gotta I gotta give it a little law shadow to the Toronto Blue Jays. I'm sorry, I wouldn't bring in new guys up. You guys are fucking, uh, you know, I can't say you're walking away with the Goddamn, uh, a l lease, but I, yeah, good on you guys. You know, you have a one in a while. 93, God knows the fuck and you can't depend on your maple leafs.

Speaker 7:          00:35:38       Maybe you get a world series out of it. Um, but I'm looking forward to that type of shit. All went today. Hail to the victors. Value in Hail to the victors. Fuck, get jam. Haba is taken over. Go Fuck Yourself. Big 10. Um, having said that, I think it's going to take them at least two years to turn the thing around, um, substantially. But uh, you know, you know, they get nervous. You know, they get nervous in Ohio state down there in Columbus, you know, they get nervous. They are, who gives a fuck? You won it last year. Have you guys end up going to the fucking NFL? And even if they don't that second half wield this year, it's the hardest fucking thing in the world is to continue trying to be successful I think at the college level coaching because especially college, who? Jesus Christ, you get a guy for one year now if he's any good. Um,

Speaker 1:          00:36:26       but whatever, as always, I don't know shit about what I'm talking.

Speaker 5:          00:36:28       [inaudible] Bob, thank you for listening. And uh, I'm going to go smoke a fucking scoby and watched this game. Can't fucking wait. That's it. Have a great weekend.

Speaker 1:          00:37:04       Oh my God. That fucking line dancing. Can there be a mass suicide amongst the line dancers? Could that just fucking happen in the middle of one of your fucking corn ball? Stupid ass fucking sell country music is country music is, I don't even know what it's for. It's for like pod people. There's absolutely no soul in it. What's so it there? Is it all right? They're angry. Redneck listening to this punching the dashboard or your Chevy s 10 all right. There isn't it fucking sucks. And that line dancing, we sit there with your fucking thumbs in your book and pockets and you do that little I'm doing, I'm, I'm actually, I'm in Dallas, Texas this week. So let's just go for big error in this one. We do that then you're fucking, I wish, I wish this was a vodcast, which I'm not doing by the way.

Speaker 1:          00:37:55       So stop fucking asking me. The great thing about this thing is you can listen to it while you're doing other shit. Right? All right. So anyways, they do that stupid thing where they banned their fucking knees and the, and I can't even think of the fucking music [inaudible] is none. Other music goes and, and then they do that little thing where they just one of their, one of their feet, right? The right foot. We'll say the right foot. It's just pivoting on the heel and the toes face forward and then to the side and then back to the front. Ah. Then they do that little thing where they bring their fucking foot up and they spanked the bottom of their foot. All of them, you don't kills me about those people

Speaker 7:          00:38:36       is they actually think that Jesus loves them. I got news for you. Rednecks. Jesus is looking the other way. He's embarrassed. He's combing his fucking hair to his face when he watches you. People lie. Debts. He has

Speaker 5:          00:38:50       looking like that chicken, the rent money. He's got a little gold watch.

Speaker 7:          00:39:08       Oh, I don't want, I'm going to talk about fuck his bike newspaper here. This is at the risk of burning some potential material. This is stuff that you could look forward to watching me go off on in the future. On stage. All right. Hang on a second. I got blow my God damn nose again. Hold on. Hold on.

Speaker 6:          00:39:29       Okay,

Speaker 7:          00:39:29       let's go eat a pastry.

Speaker 6:          00:39:33       Ah, fuck.

Speaker 7:          00:39:38       Wow. Yeah, we go. You had to get it out of the mustache. Anyways, so everybody saw what happened. On a swatch Nigga this week, right? So Time magazine has a uh,

Speaker 6:          00:39:57       yeah.

Speaker 7:          00:39:58       Has An article out there says sex lies arrogance. What makes powerful men act like pigs?

Speaker 6:          00:40:06       Okay, so

Speaker 7:          00:40:10       I look at who wrote it. It's written by Old Lady. How fucking funny is that?

Speaker 6:          00:40:19       Okay.

Speaker 7:          00:40:19       Sex lies. Arrogance. What Po? What makes powerful men act like pigs? A woman is going to tell the world why guys act the way they act. Do you realize how fucked up?

Speaker 6:          00:40:33       Yeah.

Speaker 7:          00:40:34       At what point are men get to make a fucking stand here with this. Okay. I don't want to come off like a chauvinist pig here and you just giving away. Every a guy should have wrote this article. He could've had so much more fucking insight. What the fuck does a woman know? She doesn't know. And the whole thing, it's just a thick, the whole thing is written. But in the, in the, the female's point of view, which is the only thing you understand is being that woman who got cheated on.

Speaker 6:          00:41:07       Yeah.

Speaker 7:          00:41:07       So there's this woman's scorn vibe under the whole article, but there's no information in here. I learned nothing. I was really good. I learned nothing as a guy and she's fucking wrong on most of her points. One of the great things they like to say is that a men of power, the reason why they cheat is because they feel entitled. They feel they're entitled. I'm not going to burn the bit, but that is so that's so not even true and what kills me is some fucking broad like this. Nancy Gibbs would sit there and argue with me being a lady, a lady. Do you understand what you're doing there? You're basically telling me that you know how my brain works better than I do. I was watching her with the reason why I bought this fucking article cause I was sitting, I was watching it on television. I saw the art and the obviously like a fucking magnet. I'm drawn to this. I'm like, Oh, I like this topic. I want to hear about this. And then Nancy Gibbs comes on and she's talking to a guy hit. He's going really? Oh is as long as I was. Okay. Like

Speaker 7:          00:42:19       it's at Chateau. It's just, it's fucking terrific. That would be like me. Like here's something for you. His is like, like women. You never get to know what it's like to have a dick. All right, so stop it. Stop trying to write articles. Try, stop trying to act like you're in our heads and you know what we're thinking. You don't. You're always going to be observed. You're going to be an observer. You sitting on the grassy knoll what to do? Where did the shots come from? You have no fucking idea. You just coming up with your theories, the nerve of you to get to cover. If fucking Time magazine with this horse shit. Just a bunch of horse shit. They got one over there. Listen to this shit. Uh, the turning points, this is from another lay. They had two people write about this shit. Elaine, I can't even read a fucking last name as CEO, Lino, whatever Frances having, it's Anita Hill moment. When the law professor testified before the Senate committee in 1991 that a former boss, Clarence Thomas, had sexually harassed her. He denied everything and was elevated to the Supreme Court. Notice how the fucking angry cunt leaves out the fact that he was acquitted, the guy was acquitted.

Speaker 7:          00:43:26       She makes it seem like he was accused of that stuff and because of that he would because of that attention, he, he was elevated to the Supreme Court. But anyways, hearings were attorney, but hearings were terming point. Women suddenly said that the mad men style of behavior they had been putting up with at work for so long, the leering, the inappropriate touching, the sexual banter was not acceptable. Do you understand that? She's not talking about the 1960s there. She's talking about 1991 I'm not saying that that shit wasn't happening, but you know, I was in the workforce. They're all right. People weren't walking around going, hey, touch grabbing people's asses at work in 98919901991 they weren't, I mean, generally speaking weren't, but this lady just fucking goes the mad men style, which is from the 1960s Madison Avenue. Hey Sweetie, go make me a fucking sandwich. That error completely ignoring all the bullshit that happened in the late sixties seventies right through the fucking eighties and the 80s they were talking about women wearing their fucking little power suits and power ties and all that fucking horse shit.

Speaker 7:          00:44:39       This is all just one of these classic things where you just, you just, you have your angle and then you just, you just write the whole fucking article. It's complete horse shit. Um, what the hell is the quote in here? I wanted to read. I don't even know. All right, let me tell you something Nancy, let me tell you something, Elaine. Those guys don't do that shit cause they feel entitled. They don't. All right, they don't. And if you want to know why come out to a comedy club cause I'm not burden the fucking material. I'll talk about it a little bit. I'll talk about real quick. Alright. What it is is women don't understand what it's like to have a dick. They just don't get it. Okay. The fucking thing tells us what to do. You know now, right now they're rolling their eyes because they don't understand the sex drive that we have. How could they? They got a badge. All right,

Speaker 7:          00:45:40       and the thing is, there's no information out there to help people to help guys out. Nothing. All guys get, there's no information about being a guy in general. Hey, keep it in your pants. That's the sexual advice we get. That's what we get. Fucking you got Kosmal. There's reams of shit talking about all the folds in your vagina. Every goddamn month we get, Hey, keep it in your pants. That's the kind of advice guys get. You go to jail. Hey, don't drop the soap. That's it. That's all you get. We get little fucking four sentences and that's how we're supposed to fucking navigate through life. So you're pulling with a deck, you've got this ridiculous fucking sex drive. The only thing that fucking keeps it in check is the fact that women won't fuck you. You got to figure out, you got to talk them into it. You go through dry spells. That's the only thing that prevents a guy from fucking 24 hours a day is other women making it difficult for us to get laid.

Speaker 7:          00:46:38       But then what happens is when you become an a position of power, these cunts flip the fucking table and will suck your Dick under your fucking God damn desk while your wife's sits across from you. So now the governor has taken off. You've never had to control your sexual urges because it was always done for you. You like a spoiled kid. Now you're fucking famous. You got all these broads coming at you. You don't know what to do because you never really noticed how much you've been been led around by your Dick. Now, I'm not saying every powerful guy out there is an angel. There's not this definitely some pigs out that there's definitely some guys out there who do feel entitled. But to just paint it with that broad fucking stroke of a brush and have a fucking woman sitting there telling me it's you. You don't know what you talking about, lady. All right, you have to just fucking blows my mind blows my fucking that they put two people on this assignment and they were both women. Was that some political correct fucking thing? Cause they were worried that guys we're going to say what the fuck I'm saying that basically their husbands would be out fucking everything that moved if women wanted to fuck the way we want it to.

Speaker 7:          00:47:49       I don't know. And not to mention most people can handle power and that includes broads. Okay, so you get some guy in a powerful position is ego's already going to go through the fucking roof and then you combine that with the fact that basically half of the free world will now fuck him. Any supposed to somehow rein that in and is only piece of advice is keep it in your pants, you know? I mean I dunno did I, that gets really embarrassing the Time magazine. What? This fucking superficial that they just basically they too. I mean, it was like psych 101

Speaker 7:          00:48:32       how they broke it down, even though shit on, on a Arnold Schwarzenegger about how he, he likes fucking around with girls that aren't beautiful. You know, they said it was because he was intimidated by beautiful women and Blahblahblahblahblah see, they're women. They don't, they don't get the difference between hooking up with the hottie and hooking up with the plain Jane girl who's going to try harder, okay. As opposed to the fucking chick who's, who's got 0% body fat and just thinks she's God's God damn gift. You've seen that, right? You go to a titty bar, the hottest one there does, she tries hard is that fucking one in the middle? She doesn't. And after a while, you know what? You start looking at those hotties going, you know what? They're fucking more trouble than they're worth. All right, I'll wipe my dick sucked to completion. Who am I going with? The supermodel looking chick? Oh, that chick who's just happy to be there.

Speaker 5:          00:49:47       Anyway, so I got it. I got sick.

Speaker 7:          00:49:49       Yeah. I, it's like, all right, so I'm thinking, all right, that means I got to get up at fucking five 30 return the rental car and all that horse shit. Why don't I stay at a hotel right next to the airport? So my travel agent gives me the whole list of, uh, of options of where I can stay. So I'm like, yeah, fine. Fuck it. All right. I check them out. And one of them is the Sheridan Sheridan, respected name, a very quality hotel. I say, I'm going to stay there. And the price reflected that it was a quality hotel. It costs me like, oh, you know, 180 bucks or something like that was a lot of fucking money. So, uh, [inaudible] 99, something like that, you know, for Philly, that's a lot of fucking money considering I was right outside upper Darby.

Speaker 7:          00:50:37       So anyways, here's my travel tip for you. Do not ever stay at the fucking Sheridan at the Philadelphia International Airport. It is a beyond ghetto, Sheridan and I, and it's so fucking ghetto that I, I knew it was a fucked up Sheridan before I even went into it. I pulled up and it looked fine. I got out of my car, it looked fine, and as I walked into the place, as I was walking in, these four chicks were coming out and they just look like horse from a reality show, awful tattoos on their feet. Tidies up and pushed together these cheap ass looking stripper shoes. And I went, oh no. Oh No, not, not, not, not a bad hotel. Please God, please. I start praying to the travel gods, please, please don't let this be a bad hotel. You know, I'm like way, but you know, at first I was like, all right, what, what are these like call girls? Did you just get done servicing some fucking married business guy on the road? Show what they did, but it was like 12 noon. It's like, no, no, no. Call Girls are up at 12 noon. All right. They already wiped fucking washed off. The vaginas hosed him down at like eight in the morning. And now they just fell asleep face down in a fucking pile of glitter and they're not going to wake up against it like five in the afternoon. That's how it works. And they wake up, they fucking, you know,

Speaker 7:          00:51:56       I dunno what they do. You know, they put some fucking vitamin E on the, on the ligature marks around the neck from the night before.

Speaker 7:          00:52:09       Do you know, you know what's fucked up about ligature? Nobody ever uses that statement unless somebody's got choked to death, you know, ligature, my, no, it does never any ligature marks because you know why? Because these girls who are into that type of shit, if they survive the encounter, they fucking, they were that little, uh, that little ass got the next day around that neck. You know, the hoary one, a choker. That's what they were to cover it up. You have to have a girl wants you to do that once you a choker. I remember one time I was with this girl, right? And she, uh, she will all this type of shit. She wanted me to slap her in the face and all this, all this crazy shit that, uh, that all these fucking women shows they never address. They never addressed the amount of fucking women that liked that. They like it rough. It's fucking insane. Unless I just keep picking the same kinds of fucking women, but it's ridiculous. The amount of fucking Bra that I've gone out with, you know, fucking women's Lib, fucking Blah, blah, blah. My career comes first. If we get married, I'm not taking your last name, Yadda Yadda, fucking Yada,

Speaker 4:          00:53:19       right?

Speaker 7:          00:53:21       Then you get them in, you know, the fucking all pro women. There's pro women that, and I'm making my own money and fucking, you know, in a couple of other fucking lyrics from some stupid Beyonce song, right? All that fucking horse shit. You're going to respect me eyeball to eyeball the images of women on TV, all that fucking horse shit. And then you get them back to your place and lo and behold, they have a rape fantasy. You know, am I the only guy by the only fucking guy. So anyways, so I see these fucking deceased, these hordes. Father didn't stick around, you know, George Foreman Grill. Eaton fucking just, just never had a chance for girls just coming out. Just never had a fucking chance. And you know, just dressed like fucking truck stock, fucking whores. And the sad thing is, is they think they look good and they don't even realize the vibe that they're putting out.

Speaker 7:          00:54:17       They don't know any better. They don't fucking know any better. All right? There was a rusted out car in their front yard that day. They were born and they never had a fucking chance. You know, the only fucking male voice that was in their household when they was growing up was the Billy Best that the deaf, they're fucking dead left behind. You know what I mean? Just, they just never had a fucking chance. So that was my first red flag and I was gone off. God, maybe. Maybe they use some sky miles. Is that how they got in here? And I just walked into the second I walked in. I just, I just tell the caliber of human being that was in there straight across the board here. Alright. The caliber or white person, the caliber of black person, the caliber of fucking male female, you just can tell.

Speaker 7:          00:55:07       You know what I mean? Saw some black dude, you know when they get their hair braided but they don't have enough money to fucking get it braided enough so they got all those little hairs sticking out of it, you know, cause he can't see the scalp in between the braids. You know, it's not looking fucking right. It's just not looking right. The fucking white dude with the chief Anderson little suit, the fucking creased up Brown loafers with this gold lamay horse shit on the front of it. You know, shoes look like they cost 11 bucks and I'm just going out and now God least let the fucking room be clean, you know? So I check and the lady behind the counter, she was nice enough, you know, I don't know how she ended up at this fucking Sheridan. Maybe she has stepped out of line at the big a stockholders meeting.

Speaker 7:          00:55:51       This is, this is, they're stitched Sheridan Siberia. So then I go up to my room and uh, it's weird. It had like one of the, it's almost looked like a little house. You come walking in, there's a door and right next to it there's this big window for some stupid fucking reason. If I want to overlook half the elevators in the fucking poor excuse for a pool that they had, so the blinds would were down. All right. So I open it up and it's a sweet, I'm like Nice. It was a nice room. It wasn't bad at all. So I'm in there for like five fucking minutes and I hear this knock on the door, right? Guy fucking knocks on the door. It was covered in foam. So that's what it sounded like. And I opened the door, there's a guy standing there with this giant coffee table and he goes and he's trying to walk in with this giant cocktail.

Speaker 7:          00:56:38       I'm like, Whoa, whoa. I go, you got the wrong room. I didn't order a table. He goes, not all this, this tables is your, your, your room's missing a table. Like it is. They go, yeah. Yeah. The last people who are here broke the other table. I was like, Jesus Christ, what? They have like a party or something. Anyway, yeah, I thought he was going to say no. He went like, yeah and I go, well did they fucking feel they get the place now? I think everything's been just dawn. I mean, you know I'm laying in fucking angel dust and cocaine and shit. You know, he keeps getting worse that I'm sitting there for another couple of minutes and then I just hear this lady telling this story. Right. Mother fucker tell me that mother fucker can't come up with a motherfucker. And I'm like, is that it leaves it at least a guest is that at least the guests and I fucking opened the blinds to my window and she's one of the people cleaning the rooms. Just cursing up a fucking store loud as fucking hell.

Speaker 4:          00:57:43       Okay.

Speaker 7:          00:57:44       Like all broke. He broke people are the loudest fucking people because they live near the freeways. They lived near the subway. They used to shouting over shit. So she's out there. This mother fucker trying to tell me what time it is paid. Right. And just screaming and you know how much I curse.

Speaker 4:          00:58:02       Okay.

Speaker 7:          00:58:03       Okay. I was offended and you know how much I curse. I was just like, Jesus Christ, can you please, I might have kids someday. Can you please stop Carsten like that. But I didn't say shit cause I, I mean at that point I knew it. What was going to happen? I would have been like, oh, it just would've been like, excuse me, could you do me a favor? Could you use now? Ain't nobody talking to you baby. Right. I didn't want to go through that whole fucking thing at her screaming at me. Plus she was so fucking big. She probably could've just choke, slammed me. And we would have had to have a new fucking table in my room, third fucking table that week. And I'm a conservationalist. Is that the right word? So, oh my God, fuck it. Whatever. So I don't say shit. So anyway, so I dropped you off at Darwin. It was just unbelievably depressing that people have to live that way. Fellow Americans have to live that way and that we're always sitting here fucking acting like we give a shit about other countries and we need to help out. We don't,

Speaker 7:          00:59:00       all right, well we, I mean you give a shit or I give a shit, but our government doesn't, we're working our way in there to help them out. Air quotes so we can take their natural resources. All right. That's how it is. That's what the fuck is really going on. If you ever wondered why, all right, they don't give a fuck about upper Darby, new New Orleans or whatever. Fuck it. All those blue collar towns that are failing out there in Ohio, they don't give a shit about them cause they already own them. So if there's any oil to be had, they can just go in and suck it out of the ground that it didn't make any fucking sense. So anyway, so I go back to my ghetto ass fucking Sheridan. Alright. I come walking in there and uh, if this point, it's one in the morning. Now, if it was one in the morning and I was at a nice hotel, there'd be the usual thing. There would be some people hanging down at the bar, you know, drinking, getting ready to cheat on their spouses.

Speaker 7:          00:59:59       Dress nicely though. All right. But because it was a ghetto fucking Sheridan, I went down there and most of the people in the lobby where children running around screaming like one in the morning, kids just running around. I felt like I was in fucking Atlantic city. You know those gamblers degenerate gamblers, they don't fucking handle their kids. Right, right. So just as see a fucking children. I mean, I was waiting for fucking, you know, Yohei was missing with somebody there, you know, gathering them like you could, you could've had a children's choir. That's how many fucking kids were there. So I could go up the elevator and I, and I get out, get out of the elevator and I walked back up to my little, you know, I told you the front of the room looked like a house and there was a door. And then there's the window.

Speaker 7:          01:00:45       And as I'm looking, I'm at the door as I'm looking down to take out my hotel key. I looked down and on the window sill is a three quarter eaten chicken wing sitting on the fucking window sill. I got pictures to prove it. They're all going to be up on the [inaudible] pot. Mm. podcast.com. Whatever the fuck it is. Is that the name of the website? You know the name of the fucking website? The Hell's wrong with me? Yeah, the MM. The MM podcast.com. Uh, if you go up there, I'll have all these pictures, the pictures of, uh, the tower theater and all that. I didn't take any pictures when I was driving through upper Darby could for obvious fucking reasons. I didn't want to be, you know, I just, I would not want to be taking pictures down there cause people either think you're a cop or you're just at a documentary.

Speaker 7:          01:01:32       They're level of poverty, which would be fucking in knowing to me if I was in that situation. So anyways, with that, that was my, Oh, and then the next morning I woke up and uh, I, I dropped my car off it budget. It was fucking hilarious when these hilarious racial moments here is I go to get on the bus, the bus drivers, black five white guys get on it. He asked us where we're going, I got US air. This guy says this and blah, blah blah. So we're driving in that and he's listening to this preacher because it's Sunday morning and the guy, you know, he's talking about, you know, people need to be in to Jesus and blah, blah, blah, all this, you know, regular Jesus Shit, right? But then all of a sudden he starts talking about Obama and around he's just starts kind of trashing white people just go. And we should be giving thanks to Jesus that a strong black man is president. It's not afraid to stand up to the white supremacy that we run in this country and he's got it cracked.

Speaker 7:          01:02:32       And I'm sitting there fucking and all. I did just cause I wanted to have the laugh. I just turned around and looked at all the other four white guys and then everybody is just sort of sitting down looking at that wing tips like rarely. What exactly is the call here? Or can we say something? You know, excuse me, we're not all white supremacy. You know, like what exactly is the proper response to that? Because I thought it was, I don't know. I actually thought it was fucking hilarious. I wish I could remember what the guy's saying. Ah, Jesus. Now I'm fucking bomb. And again on this fucking podcast

Speaker 5:          01:03:07       dress.

Speaker 7:          01:03:19       Okay.

Speaker 5:          01:03:30       Somebody who wants to fill my girlfriend.

Speaker 7:          01:03:33       It's like a centerfold. Good for you. She's blonde. She has a beautiful face, a tiny waist and giant cans. I have outdone myself. What? What the fuck man, don't you sell yourself short? Maybe you, maybe you're a, you're a stud. So he says, however, having a girlfriend of such caliber as you might imagine, comes with its share of problems. Genes is, here we go. Like, uh, like your good self. I battle my battle, keeping my temper under control at times and particularly struggle when my girlfriend and I go out in public together. In short, the amount of male attention she gets is ridiculous. And if times it's infuriating. Have you ever found you found yourself out with a girl and notice that every man within a three mile radius from the sweaty 22 year old walking boner to the porky, sexually frustrated father of three is blatantly staring at her tits in her ass?

Speaker 7:          01:04:31       Um, I've always been of the opinion that if a girl is obviously with a guy, whether you know him or not, it's a gentleman's code not to have a staring contest with there with her, with her a ring piece. I don't know what that means. What's that looking at her pussy. I have no idea. This guys from Australia, um, if a girl there's a loan or with girlfriends, sure objectify the shit out of her. But I think if a girl is holding hands with your boyfriend and you make it obvious that your helmet is pressing against the inside of your front Zipper, then you're a cunt. Um, nothing serious has happened yet, but the weather is getting warmer. The outfits are getting smaller and I'm concerned I'm going to wind up with, I'm going to wind up with perverts blood and quite possibly come on my hands all for now. Um, all right.

Speaker 4:          01:05:24       Okay.

Speaker 7:          01:05:25       All right. This is a tricky situation. She's are, you know, is a very tricky situation. You know, there's a price you pay for everything. All right? You're the one who has a centerfold fucking girlfriend with a great ass and Nice set of fucking tits and a, you just, you just have to,

Speaker 4:          01:05:46       okay,

Speaker 7:          01:05:47       this, this, this is, this is how I look at this shit.

Speaker 7:          01:05:52       As long as you're a woman isn't going around trying to get attention if she's just fucking standing there and she's so goddamn stunning that men are looking at her, but you know, she's not, Ooh, I dropped my lipstick and then slowly bending over at the waist while looking over her shoulder. Um, if she's doing that, I can tell you right now a bang or another couple of times and then fucking dumper because she's going to be an absolute fucking nightmare. And a, you don't need that in your life, okay. But if she's just a stunningly gorgeous woman, um, you, that kind of comes with it. And, uh, if you lose your fucking temper and you start acting like a maniac, that's a great way to eventually annoy the shit out of her. And because she can't help it. Like I said, if she's not trying to get attention, she can't help it, that she's gorgeous. And uh, if you then, it's in this weird way, you're giving her shit for being herself, which is not fun for anybody and then you're going to have a problem. So,

Speaker 4:          01:07:00       okay.

Speaker 7:          01:07:01       Um, I don't know how to, if you know what it's like, it's like a, it's like when I whore myself out at the end of my shows and I sell DVDs. All right. I don't have to do that, but I choose to do it and I'm standing as a choice. I fucking made. And then I stand there and what's going to happen? I answered this. Yeah. This is one of these podcast questions. Alright? Eventually somebody is going to come up and they're going to fucking insult me. He's tell me they didn't like my act. Tell me. Uh, they didn't think I was as funny as when he saw me on TV and I can't get mad because it's my fucking fault for standing there like an asshole. Just, you know, I, I put myself on the Dunkin store and I got to admit, sir, if, if you're, if this, if your girl is the way that you've described her, you just have to accept that it's, it's par for the course and, uh, just give yourself a little halftime speech before you go out. You know, I'm not going to lose my shit. Um, but

Speaker 7:          01:07:57       if it is overt, uh, there has to be a way that you can fucking address it without pissing her off, without, you know, you also don't want to get into a fucking fight. Um, I dunno. Just say, hey buddy can, can you limit it to like know five second shifts of staring at her tea? I can't say tits. Uh, I don't know what you do. Do that. That's a rough one. That's a rough run. They, man, that takes me back to being a,

Speaker 6:          01:08:29       okay

Speaker 7:          01:08:29       Jesus Christ. I was like 21 years old. I went on this, I went out on a date with this girl who was well out of my fucking league just because I didn't have the confidence to fucking be with her, you know what I mean? Um, beautiful girl. And I went out with her and I noticed he just kept looking around the restaurant to see who was looking at her and I remembered it annoyed the shit out of me, but I, I, I didn't have any experience with beautiful women, so I just sort of accepted it. And um, but I never went out with her again. It just, it drove it. I stopped, I tapped out somewhere through the fucking dinner. Even back then, I was an angry son of a bitch. I was like, let me get this straight. I'm buying you fucking dinner and you're looking around to see who's Elsa staring at your tits. Um, yeah, you're a cunt. Good looking cunt. But uh, nonetheless, someday those looks are going to be gone. And I'm just going to be left with the cunt. You know who's going to be a psycho cunt because you're an attention whore and when the attention goes away, you're going to be like some celebrity who fell off the fucking man. Fuck this bitch. Fuck this. Know.

Speaker 5:          01:09:35       And that was the other big shows she does. She gets what she wants. She puts the rest on a tray and the zip blah

Speaker 7:          01:09:51       in the freezer. He doesn't care.

Speaker 5:          01:10:13       Does make money. He's gone a little gold watch. She's dressed mouse on his.
