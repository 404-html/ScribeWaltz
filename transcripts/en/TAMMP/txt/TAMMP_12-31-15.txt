And I said, yeah, the big ten's a little rough, you know? And he goes, yeah, we make, we make Lyman and full backs and then it goes boarding. Now thank Christ. I mean, I've never, I've never seen it in like it. Jay's is like, if the other shoe could drop, nope. He's almost willing it to drop. I swear to God to play crashes. I'm blaming him. It's not going to be pilot error. It's him in the back. Just gone like, God, God, turbulence. Here we go. It's the end of the world. Yeah, I, we got it. We got to fucking tease amount of it. He's never going to, that's who he is, dude. He's got to see this. We all got our things.

Speaker 1:          00:03:20       That's his. I know. I get all worked up about fucking star wars do. We were drinking. We're drinking cognac last night and I was flipping out about star wars once again. Oh Dude. You Changed Moods. It was, I'd never, you went from, you would've thought somebody told you, you know horrible. Oh yeah. You just, you were like, compared to what I would try, it drives me fucking nuts. You just nine is better than any of those fucking things. No, I know a dude. But then after that you just looked at your drink for a second and we're shaking your head. And I was like, I think he's, he really mad. I don't know. I just know exists. This fucking drives me nuts. Like just say you enjoy the movie. Don't be like, oh wait, it's fucking bullshit. It isn't. It isn't that. I don't know why it bugs me.

Speaker 1:          00:04:03       It just bothers me. What? I just have to be like, what? Jesus Christ. If you think that's the greatest movie ever, what do you do when you see raging bull? I honestly questioned if you got into it with somebody in the past about it and it's still with like in you, like to, something happened like the way you got mad. I was like the business, it's like, is there something I'm missing? You know, you know what it was? Cause I had tequila before the Cognac. It was just all that hard stuff was that Tequila was unreal. Yeah. Oh I thought that was a good one. Oh, that was unbelievable. But would be an angel's today cause we've got two shows tonight at the Orpheum and your eggs. Oh my God. And your eggs. Oh yeah. You know what, Paula? Like medium. Paulie likes the eggs over medium, numb over medium.

Speaker 1:          00:04:43       That's the, you have to care. It's an art. You got it. You got to care. They make over medium over easy. It just fucking flippity ago over over hard. You just burn it up all the medium. You can't and you gotta pay attention. You nailed it over medium as you cut the middle of the yoke and it doesn't even go all over the place. It just slowly oozes out. It's still soft. You nailed it. You know the and, and the waffles. Dude, I gotta tell you I haven't had a bad meal out here. Oh yeah. Been cooking up a storm for first. He and his lovely wife here every morning having a great time. Scrambled eggs. Fucking ah, walk. I'm on the flight and fluffy with the cheese in there. He can't. Yeah, no, it's great. As a cook I am Blah. Hits 10 times better, you know? Yeah. I'm mad out of the special. It's probably got a break. I've, I had, I don't know what's going to happen.

Speaker 1:          00:05:32       We got to get him on here at tease him about that. We Love Jay. We just fucking around. But until you, these text messages, I swear to God to pray for me would think is pray for me is so ridiculously over the top. I looked the guy in the movie, the sniper didn't have dialogue like this. He's just trying to make a connecting flight and you know what? I want to look up Dallas right now and I'm going to see what the fucking way, if had to guess, what is the weather judging by those texts, you know, they had to have been like a tornado warning, right? I bet you the weather there is like 48 degrees of 55 degrees. Okay. Clear skies. I mean, I don't know if I'll ever take off. You know, it's 51 degrees. I almost nailed it. Precipitation, 0% humidity. Humidity's 0% winds, 10 miles an hour. Nothing.

Speaker 1:          00:06:24       Dude, you could barely fly a kite and I'll get a weather drone. Wouldn't have turbulent Jesus Christ. Check. Uh, uh, sorry if I got a little heated last night. I don't know. When I, when I get, when I drink the fucking hard stuff sometimes it brings out, it brings out the uglier side of me. It was so funny man. Like Stacy and I were just like, I did he get like, it was really funny cause you got, you went from like, we've just, by the way, that Cognac, Oh yeah, Paul, Yours also got, and I'm a lunatic. You know, you realize I'm a lunatic. Yeah, but no, but no, but I don't think you're a lunatic. I just know I am. Look at Jay flips out over fucking nothing. I flip out over like Jay slips out. I basically, but everything I've slipped out over like dumb shit dude. You Act like your high school rival loves star Wars.

Speaker 1:          00:07:14       No, I lost it. My high school, I had this thing and he was a star wars guy and you weren't dude. That's how I just want someone to agree with me. It's like, what am I not seeing that reminded me, you Chappelle, please believe me. Nobody just be like, this is the greatest thing ever. And like, like, Oh, some Rockwell and moon was fucking up like that blue, that move. We blew my fucking mind. You know, I didn't see that. Ah, yeah, I didn't want you to do that. And they go watch one scene with he walks and I want you to justify that fucking 50 mile lied. I though I understand is for kids. I get that. If you're, whatever I do, I can I let you go. I lost my mind is the adults that are still getting like, I mean this movies that I loved when I was a kid and I watched them now and I'm just like, oh Jesus.

Speaker 1:          00:08:00       You know, dude, I actually see what you're saying. I like star wars because I was a kid and I saw, I see. It's ridiculous. The big monkey to Chewbacca Tourette's, just funding, you know, but, but, but then there's a cool side to it too, like evil and good and the same. I like the light saber fights, dude. I just, you know, but as a kid, I was extensive thing. I was a kid. Okay, you like light saber fight. Once you watch enter the dragon with Bruce Lee, I mean you want to see some good fighting. Even remember talking to people with a flashlight and I'll remember talking to yesterday and they're like, all go into the hall while, wow, that's a fucking no, remember we were on the charity must sit. Yeah, I tell me the fucking same voiceover guy or did Jabba the hut in fucking Yoda is not the same guy.

Speaker 1:          00:08:57       The guy with the hands and say, I did the cookie monster job, or no bother. I think it's the guy from Amistad. It's all the same thing. But here's the thing, dude. You know when you go into a sneaker store and you're like, oh my God, those Jordans bring me back. It's the same thing. And you're like, oh, Jj Abrams. Well, yeah, he's a good director. Let's see what he does with it. You got to check it out, dude. It's two hours of your life. That's how I look at it. It's two hours of your life. Now, to your point, being dressed online as Chewbacca, that's crazy. You know, be having gowns and like, you know, women dressed in the princess lay of bikini with the hair done. That's, so, that's a little much, I would never do that. I just say a man, like give it a chance as it was.

Speaker 1:          00:09:38       He did a really good job. That's all. I'm not, I'm not saying it's not a good movie, but I'm just saying, it just blows my mind that this is not, you can have a two mile long line for that fucking movie. Well, how many long a mile should it be? Full, full moon district nine. It wasn't taught Moonraker or just actually good of science fiction. Yeah. I just think I love that too. I don't mind. I come to the future when, you know, there's no water and all that type of shit and we fucking destroyed ourselves. And you know, I'm not in design B's. I don't like that to meet. This was good. Brings was, that was the shit for me. If this was good, that was the shit. I love that movie. I liked that movie. Uh, uh, I'm gonna said Riddick Bowe thing. Rhames ving Rhames did, uh, you know, the one with the monster couldn't see me.

Speaker 1:          00:10:24       He had to move the same way he did. Do you remember that? No. Fucking rent those. He had the diesel vin diesel. Sorry, I didn't see [inaudible]. That's why I thought the guy they act of thing was rig bull. Redick Redick and then I went to Bang Bang. Yes. See how my brain works? Riddick boats. But your name's in the words while Paul do what you gotta do. Jewish sourced up Annapolis to do, I looked at with chef Gordon was going number 24, number 24, the light. No, we were all, we were all over each other also to heavy heavy vodkas in, you know, we were hammered in the first period. Am I don't know, it's kind of a reoccurring, a story of a, speaking of which Paul you're saying in the, uh, the beginning of 2016. Yeah. Up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up. You're going to put it over.

Speaker 1:          00:11:11       Yeah. And my wife and I talked about it. I called you up. I said it. I'm doing it 100%. Starting after this trip. This is my last hurrah. I got three days people and then I'm going to go, I want to go six months, but I'm definitely going 90 days clean, dry, no booze. I'm cutting out the carbs, going, going to the track and a run and I'm going to drop. Uh, you know, the funny thing about me is my doctor always said, he goes, dude, you're the same way. It always, he goes, you just got to lose a little bit of his stomach. And he goes, I do do exercise. I'm like, I've been 15 pounds overweight for fucking 10 years and I'm getting a 15 pounds done. Done. What about sticks? So Gosh, it's going to be a, it's going to have to be, uh, it's going to have to be a serious occasion is going to have to be a serious occasion.

Speaker 1:          00:11:55       Okay. It's going to have to be a holiday. I'm dropping back. I mean, maybe one a month. That's what I'm going to do. It's going to be a special occasion. Well, actually, when they say when you, you want to really make a change, you should just try to do one thing at a time. So I think just not boozing alone, you'll probably take off half the fucking weight. Right. Not boozing alone and, and just not smoking a stick. You, Joe Zimmerman, you don't always a funny comic dude. Funny comment from I think that DC area is that they're really funny. And we were doing the road together and they'd go, hey Joe, did you smoke cigars? And he just looked at me and he just goes, only when I celebrate and the way he said it though, do it. It was just like, it made me realize, what am I doing?

Speaker 1:          00:12:32       Oh No, it's stupid. It's, yeah, it's ridiculous to knock it off. You know, way better than me though. Yeah. I'm kind of overwhelmed to be honest with you. It's like I can't, I just can't do it anymore. I just can't, like I can't fucking just wake up with that taste in my mouth again. I can't do like, I got rid of my human doors and all that. I don't even have cigars in the house anymore. And it's just like, if somebody calls me up, I got a buddy of mine that, you know, like once every six weeks, like, you know, hey man, yeah, you want to go ahead? And I said, all right, I'll go, I'll go do that. But like, uh, you know, I know you dropped off with them when you used to call me and we'd talk about certain brands and sticks and you stopped.

Speaker 1:          00:13:10       Like you used to be like, oh dude, I went to the thing, I got this, you know, I'll, I'll send you a picture of the label and you stopped that. I noticed that you stopped. I had to knock it off, but like I still, I still like, I like the cigar, but, um, I don't, um, yeah, it just, it just kind of Chi just, I had too many and I just, somewhere on that last bus trip we did right before the New York shows, um, I just had it, I think when we were in that great one in Milwaukee, but we were just like, just the doors were all closed. There was 20 people smoke now that that was brutal. Yeah. The next day I was just like, oh my God dude. Like I, I feel like that when like that smoke one of them, the marrow in my bones here that I, and I could tell when Steven [inaudible] was with us, he wanted to be with us and hang out, but he couldn't, he when he was sitting there, I knew he was just like, it was way too much people in there smoking.

Speaker 1:          00:14:03       Oh yeah. And it made it brutal. There was like 10 guys and then like for women showed up and they were smoking. It was smoking. We were one little room. It was awesome. But I would say it was too, it was too much. Yeah. Yeah, I do. But I gotta tell you to do California will be a problem for me cause you could just go out here and just in the sunshine and just smoke a stick and ball every day. Yesterday I go, I'm gonna smoke half of this with a coffee. I don't need a clip at the end of it. Once I start going but not do it, I'm, yeah, I'm going, I'm going clean. I said to my wife too, I go, you don't think you're going to do it? And she goes, no, I actually know you're going to this time. I'm definitely doing it.

Speaker 1:          00:14:36       I'm definitely doing it too. I don't think you're gonna make it. I of course you don't know. I'm just using reverse psychology. I'm going to make, I'm going to do, I feel one of those guys, you know one of those guys. You need to be like, dude. People said people said I couldn't do it. Yeah. Wait, you don't understand. When I put my mind, just stuff that we do, the funniest shit talker ever. I'm a time when we were on the fucking road, you know [inaudible] he's on the fucking elliptical. Does like 40 minutes now and I did over an hour and I crushed it. That one. I don't want your to do over an hour bill. I did an hour. I had a time, then I did an hour. Now the next time I ask you why I did it, 15 minutes. That was what it was on, whatever, whatever.

Speaker 1:          00:15:14       I did an hour because I made sure I did six. What Paul goes, he goes, looks at me and he goes, no one goes harder than me at the gym and I'm dying laughing like you didn't lift one. Wait, you didn't. When he pulled up, he got on that like some chick who just had a baby and you try to lose your baby bump that you are on a fucking elliptical for an hour. I was on the elliptical for an hour. I went hard for now, but yeah, I did nothing else. Like no pull ups. No, no. Yeah, no. Doing the butterfly through the fucking pool, like some of these maniacs to duty. The thing is you see who the fuck are you? So people who go hard at the gym, you'll look at it and they look like statues. They go hard. Yeah. We just show up and try to, we try to maintain, yeah, would.

Speaker 1:          00:15:57       I've been going to my gym recently to do an hour done. It's hilarious. Getting back to uh, you know, going to the gym and stuff like this month, I want to make sure I went on a lot just cause I knew it was going to eat like a fucking animal. And uh, there was like, you know the, you know the workout couple, you know? Oh yeah. So like the fucking dude is just jacked and she is fucking, she's like, like she's probably lifting 60% of what the fuck he's lifting and that she had these giant fake tits and she had this look on her face. Like she didn't want to be there. She was one of the scariest people have ever seen in my life. Shit. Hair. I'll pull back Chin like this scowl on her face. And she had like these fucking world war two like pinup girl, like the member was bullet tits. They used to have back then because of the way they used to shape the bras. She's walking around in this sports bra. Like I swear to God, if this woman wanted to, uh, just pick me up and body slammed me, she could dress in Latino. And they also do that. They like that couple that like, you know, uh, and she probably had an ass like me. They got their notice noticing.

Speaker 1:          00:16:55       No, but they were like, they were all that workout, do that workout shit. I don't, I don't get it like these fucking, these fucking uh, uh, Mr Mom sweatpants that I have, which are fucking, I can't throw them off because they just won't wear out.

They're like, Jim is part of the gym and they go their dress nice. Yeah, it was a part of, it's just, you know, it's like the same way I show up on the golf course, right.

Speaker 1:          00:18:21       It's just like, dude, you know you're going to slice it and then they'd stand out. That I wanted to do a bit about that. Just imitating somebody fucking standing over the ball when he went all of that shit and doing the thing with the head and fucking relax. Now who does it? Why does a thing with his head, my brother's got this other thing that he does. I was going to combine everybody's little tick and then they lend, they fucking hit it and it goes into the woods and then they had the nerve to stand there.

Like it was like a system overload my head. Like what you were, you were with the dog next door. And I walked in and I saw Jordan, threes, Jordan, fours, fives. The Senate threes is what you want. And I couldn't, I couldn't tell. How about my wife? How about my wife? Dude, this is my wife.

Speaker 1:          00:21:32       Stacy's out here with me and she's having an absolute great too. The funny thing about her is she never turns it off. So we're walking on Melrose in the sunshine, getting ready to eat lunch, going into stores, everything she loves and her brain couldn't handle it. She's like, I don't have anything to do. What the fuck she has kids and Becky's. Yeah, yeah. You know, she's got that like you ain't shit. You know, she can't relax. I can relax, Bill. You know that I can relax. You know what I mean?

But then I saw the fourth, the fours and the fives do it. I would before you walked in there, my eyes, if you just saw my, I can't believe you know all of Stacy just send, my jaw dropped and I was just like looking at all of these things the same way.

Speaker 1:          00:22:43       I can list all like the super bowl champions, the way that you know all the Jordan's sneakers. Like I Yab I'm not as good as certain people, but I'm, I'm getting, do you know what's weird is I'm turning into a sneaker head more and more cause you got to wear it. Listen, when you get older, I told you got to be a man. Needs to things. I was always taught this. You know what they are? A man needs a nice watch on his wrist and an alibi and a nice and a nice pair of shoes. Whether it's kicks or shoes, they got up. I don't know about the kicks things. I don't remember the kicks. If I'm just saying the foot game needs to be on par, you know. That's what I'm saying. Whatever you look when somebody looks at your feet, it's like, oh my God, those are crazy.

Speaker 1:          00:23:18       You. Whatever sneakers you get. I either love him or I just, you either go, those are classics and I love them while you're like, I hate them. Yeah. Because there's a generation gap between you and me with sneakers where I came up with as Starsky and Hutch Adidas dragons, Adidas country, Nike Cortez, which I picked up and I loved yesterday and I was called at these man with the red one, you know the white with Forrest Gump and that's what kills me. You go Forrest Gump. Well that's what he ran in. I know, I didn't know that. So he ruined those sneakers. Yeah, because he got a pair of them and that's when he put them on and he just left the house to started running and then you see them get older. But he kept those on the whole time. Beard when you really love those sneakers students.

Speaker 1:          00:23:57       So, so clean. And then what has somewhere around would Shaq came into the league? Like the sneakers just got so bizarre. Like I remember one time he had, it looked like a bullseye and the circles just kept getting bigger and bigger and bigger. The ones who, when he had, when he was on in Orlando and I was looking at those things and I remember those younger kids can all look at the shacks and got the shacks and I was looking at going at that. It looks lazy. Ugliest. Now the shafts were fucking those Red Adidas Yoga. I remember one time. Yeah, but those Adidas I have are just classic. They'll raise red or red with white stripes and they're clean dude. But I remember one time we were on the road somewhere. I haven't watched blog gray ones. You've just bought gray ones. Yeah, they're right there.

Speaker 1:          00:24:34       They're all fucked up. No. Yeah, dude, you are. We were on the road and I was standing to the right of the stage and I was just going out there, watch some of your set and everything like that, and I just, for 45 minutes we're staring at your Adidas and even list I was even listed. I was just like, those are clean. All right. But those red ones are one of my favorites. You can see the ones hanging in there. Yeah. On the on the bottom right. That's Adidas country. The white with the green. Those are those for me. Those are, that's, yeah, that reminds me of like 1976 Olympic Games. Yeah, like like you know, led you to, that was about 1978 yeah. Due date is country flat and I can't, that's, that's too, that's too old, dude. I had to stand, but then you and then the ones that, hey, six are cool.

Speaker 1:          00:25:16       Those are basics of cool, but then the, then the other one's red. Those are Adidas dragons. Smith's. You've got black Stan Smiths. You got Dick. I am the old clay got the old school and they got Nike Cortez. That's where I can't get, that's where you lose me. Like if I look at all your things, you've got to, you got to Stan Smith's on top with your crazy. You got to read the a six I could go with, you got the Cortez I could go with and then all of a sudden it gets down to the, to the Bruce Jenner. It's like you've said all the shadows. I looked like a punter in 1974 yeah. Those look like to punt. Still a puzzle that doesn't like old school soccer shoes. I love wine. But yeah, that's like you. You got the leg. Would you have, or like those Jordan's you have right now that's like say should have the blinking light in the back for a little kid because it's got the infrared color.

Speaker 1:          00:26:00       That's what you don't like about, yeah, somewhere around there. They made the oh no's. Yeah, that shit. And when, when the sunglasses starting to having the neon green or the neon pink, the all along the side, that's when the outfielders we're in the Oakleys that the shiny, they were big and shiny. No, just like every due to put Mousse in his hair and had a chain around gold chain around his United in the late eighties had the fucking, those, those, they would like the Tom cruise shaped sunglasses from risky business and on the side it was either lime. Oh aw, that's terrible. Yeah. That's when I, when those colors were in, I never looked more pasty cause I just could not, I could not pull them off. So I had to just stick with my whole life. I've dressed like Malcolm young to be honest with you.

Speaker 1:          00:26:42       Did you ever wear Cavariccis ze couch? I got with one of my first ever war I had, I had z cavalry with the Cosby sweater, driving gloves for whatever reason, rough on yesterday. Okay. And uh, and a, a waist linked like leather zip up. Ah. And I think I had a hat on too was bad dude, you and Z calves, because I grew up in an Italian neighborhood assumption and the kids, they all warm. But like I remember they were the four g Owen's, there was a, and they just all had them. I never wore them. I never wore as coverage and it just didn't, it wouldn't have looked comfy pants. He had no puffy up top and then tapered taper down. But it was the MC hammer pants. It was basically the dressy and they were pleated. Oh. Oh, that was so bad. They were awful.

Speaker 1:          00:27:30       And they crushed, it was like one detail that would make any pair of pants bad. They took like all five and they just throw it in one, you know, it's like that a were the mystery meat, you know what I mean? We just throw it in upon, give it to the soldiers. Ah, I remember one time I put on pants and Stacy goals. Those have pleats in it and I've, yeah, no they're not. And she goes, no, you can't do it unless you go into an eighties party. You cannot, you can't have that on any fucking level. But, um, uh, I wasn't gonna say, yeah, so dude, you, you know, you have no idea what you're in for tomorrow. They'll go into the desert. Got me excited. Like, Oh yeah, I never seen like, you're going out, you're going to butcher shops. You can be, I made the big square ice.

Speaker 1:          00:28:11       He'll make you get nuts with the ice. I was like, this is going to be nuts. I it in a book. You know what really got me? I saw a football and a pump. Oh yeah. Oh yeah, dude, we can be out on the golf course. Ah, fucking lie had, makes the sickest fucking breakfast sandwiches DOJ going, you know, what's the greatest thing is when we pull up at this point, we're becoming that tailgate that people look over going, ah, they make an x, why we should run eggs. You guys are the guys at the Rose Bowl. Like you'd becoming all that good. But there's always the, I don't think you get your official, like you're, you're the bad ass tailgates until you're literally dragging a smoker in and there's a bus. No, when you have like the satellite dish and you got like a TV, like those girls guys, we hung within, uh, for the ut game.

Speaker 1:          00:28:56       Yeah. Now giants where the giants play as a guy. He basically painted a school bus giants and then he's got the tarp over and like that, like the TV's on, like those guys are staples there. You guys aren't that yet. Are you on? Okay. Okay. No. But they, they, uh, those guys, I went with some guys, uh, and Cleveland long time ago I went to a browns game and there was some guys out there that bought a short bus and they painted it, this, this and this shit. They painted it Cleveland Brown colors. And then they had this dad, this crank on the back and on top of the bus. Like these goalposts would come up and you'd be in the parking lot and you'd kick field goals. Oh my God. Anyway, damn it. Oh, I think I saw that on TV. Oh, is all they might've made it did up.

Speaker 1:          00:29:37       Fox did a thing on that guy and they were like, and people could line up to kick field goals. They were doing it at the Cleveland. I don't know if it's the same one because sometimes people see ideas and they take, so, okay, but this was a Cleveland Guy, isn't that awesome? And then they really played like full contact beer pong. They went nuts. And I remember I tackled the guy from John Lawrence from hilarity. I tackled him and somebody had just dumped the hot coals on the knee, went right down on it and he got like almost borderline second degree burn on right under his kneecap and he's putting snow on it. I felt horrible and he was laughing. He didn't care. Maybe I'll do that. What's one of the sickest games ever? As far as like the weather we showed up and it was just that fucking Lake Erie snow, but it was just like, it was just fucking cold enough for it to be snow.

Speaker 1:          00:30:26       So it was wet snow and there was some guys standing there, this fucking guy, he had like a high school Letterman jacket on. He was this skinny dirt bag, look and fucking, you know the, the Dale Earnhardt and mustache. Why are we guy, no hat. And he had like that fucking straw hair, full head of hair but straw here do it. And it was just, he had like an inch of snow on his fucking head and somebody finally just pulled out an awful old Cleveland hat and put it on his head and he just goes, yeah, thanks. He just sort of shook his head, do it and I swear to God it was like, like the amount of snow that came off of his fucking head. Like if that guy didn't give him that hat, I was looking at that, looking at the guy going, that guy, if this guy stays out in the elements for an entire football game where he's at now, he, this guy is going to die.

Speaker 1:          00:31:16       It's fucking insane. So this won't be, it'll be a little cold tomorrow, but we bring like a, we bring like three cords of woods, so you know, if it gets a little cold with the whiskey and the system and I don't get cold and I haven't got it doesn't get cold. And with the Whiskey, I'm going to be drunk kid, dude. It is not, there's California. How calls are going to beat them off? Forties fifties it's gonna be a, it's going to be like 39 degrees, 40 degrees. If it stays not in the twenties 39 40 duties. That's like 47 40 Shelly. Yeah, yeah, yeah. You're going to be getting up and someone's at first thing going to get as an ice cold beer, which is not what you need to warm up. I'm telling you man, pardon? No, but as soon as I'm going to be warm as soon as the goes birthing heater heater, if you want to hit it.

Speaker 1:          00:31:54       Yeah, it's great. It's one of my favorite things is after a shell, after shell, what would it was me, you and Barton. The best thing about touring with bill is we all have a schedule. We all have a system and we're like the little brothers, right? So then bill goes up and we always go our, after our sets he bring bill up after our sets we're going to go and do it. So I go into the green room and Barton extent it goes like he makes it, he makes us thing with his face where he gets real happy. He clearly, he clenches his teeth and he makes a fist and he smiles with his teeth clinch and the fist shakes and he goes and then, and then comics when pop you want to pop. Like he just makes you feel like anytime you have a drink it's like he's, he's unbelief he could make, he could make like doing feel okay him.

Speaker 1:          00:32:44       Do you want to borrow for your lateral and it's great the way presented it. I'll take a pump but um, no dude. You know what made me laugh? I thought about this and I hope you remember this because you made me think about it cause you know I'd be talking Shit right at a game with you going to do dude. If they got that field go, think back at the truck. I'm going to kick. I guarantee you I kicked her in a role. Like I would be talking shit. Oh he would go beyond that. I could, I could hit, I could hit 48 yard at. You'd be like, as you're doing it, you don't keep just making up shit as you call it. The funny thing, he says, me and you were at Monday night football in New Orleans, remember against the eagles. Oh God. We saw Vic, we saw Vic and uh, and that was when Andrew [inaudible] stadium.

Speaker 1:          00:33:24       And that was when Andy Reed was on his way out. And I knew when they, they just couldn't win, even know Vic was doing okay man, you leave hammered. And we're like, dude, we got along, walked in him and we got a, we got along, walk back. So some guy standing next to us and he hears us and he offered us a ride. He was a complete stranger. You don't remember this. And he goes, Oh yeah, that's right. And he goes, he goes, dude, I'll give you, he goes, you guys want, if you guys want a ride, I mean you just looked at each other. Didn't know this guy from Sam, didn't know. And we were just like, yeah, all right. And all of a sudden we got into a yelling match cause I said I could throw a college football 50 or so and I said I could throw a pro football 45 you go, you know you're not throwing a provisional.

Speaker 1:          00:34:04       How fuck. And we start getting, and the guy left like right. And so it was the way he was just left. That's right. He walked away, said yes to a stranger and he listened to this nonsense and just walked away. He was like, I want no part of these two and I guarantee you it was more me. No, I'd probably get real angry over nothing. I get angry over nothing and do two. I sort of got one major shit happens. I don't flip out. Not all your fucking huge app. Ah, fuck you gonna do all right. How do we get out of this? But little shit makes me calm and cool with anything. Like he could be like, dude, did you hear about songs? We'll do. He's gonna, he's gonna fuck it and it'll be an awful tragedy and you'll be like, can't do it.

Speaker 1:          00:34:45       That's bad. But you know, he could do this and heal better it, you're like, well, Bill's real positive. And then somebody, it'd be like, dude, just last star wars movie and you just like, come on. Why fucking hilarious dude. Eh, it isn't. It's one of my weaknesses all that. When we got water damage in the house, I flipped out about that. But uh, by the way, dude, challenge was awesome. Generally speaking, I'll clean, clean house, clean up the wife because of the wife. So, um, so anyways, we get on to sit here and we got to wrap this thing up here cause uh, I got the fuck and I gotta make some pies. Fee Jackass is tomorrow. That's the fact that you do that dude is little individual pies. You can be thrown down with the fucking ice cream. You're going to be so fucking hammered at that point.

Speaker 1:          00:35:27       Then he get a smoke with fucking cigar. Yeah. Then you got it. Then you've got to go watch the game. That's the funny thing about it. It's the funniest thing is everybody's like, Ahhh, but Bart, nick, he goes, hey dude, I gotta be honest man. The worst part of that. The, the day has gone into the game and I'm like, people do lie ahead. Ly heads saved bargainings ass last year they were going to throw him out cause he just sat down somehow. I don't know how, what did he do? Well, I don't know how you get separate, how you get separated from Joe Barden. Nikki, such a big guy. We somehow lost him. Like he was a toddler. He's as big as the Lyman. Right. And he just went over and he just sat down and he was drunk and he couldn't produce his ticket or while I don't know what was going to just sort of, and they were all nervous.

Speaker 1:          00:36:06       Thanks you too. It was like six of them standing around going like, how are we going to get this mallet? And he was hammered in public. He was sitting down. He, we, like a lot of people are hammered in public when they're there, but they're walking to the bathroom, but they're walking, you see? But the second you sit down and you look like you're gonna pass out and it looked like a homeless guy. Oh, he was in really rough shape. They thought he was okay. They don't understand Joe. Yeah. What are you going, I'm arrested. I'm arrested. Arrested. I've seen a display of Joe Barr. Nicole, I'll know it'll never be down. Well, he'd fuck it. We all that. So they were about ready to kick them out and that's when law had gave the famous now famous the teddy bear speech. Uh, he's a teddy bear.

Speaker 1:          00:36:49       He's like, Hey, you're the guy. You guys want to take it. Right. It just kept calling him a teddy bear and they fucking bought it. And he was able to bring them back into the, like to the seated area and sat him down. And uh, and I actually, I remember telling people that story last year and then other people used it later on in the week and with text me going, yeah, my buddy, they were going to throw them out. I just can't wait. He's a teddy bear teddy, but adds great teddy bear diffuses the situation. Dad's gray. Oh No, Jace, Jace saved. But the thing that people don't know, and if those security people knew, Bart, nick Barnack was like member inch scar face when he was just getting shot and he was just gone and his arm was going back, but he just kept shooting.

Speaker 1:          00:37:28       Dude, I saw we were in, we were in Portland and a guy goes, dude, this is the strongest suite in the country. Like snoop dog gets his weed. This is the weed, right? And we're like, hi dude. I took one. I took one hit of this thing and you know I'm not a big weed smoke bill. I was borderline not okay for like 50 minutes. Like I took one hit and I was like, I can't touch that again. Law had took three. He just had this look, pray for me. He should have been praying for two Barton smoke, half of it with the other people. He just get kept going around and he smoked and drank. I think he's just walking, just walking sway, dude. And he held it together. Dude, animal animal. He doesn't go down too. He won't go down. Never went down.

Speaker 1:          00:38:11       He won't go to Joel Amata. Ah, that's great. Well I got to speak in a, I'd check lamata Rappaport did a whole a podcast on a raging bull. Oh, did he do, and he showed me the names of, I don't know if it came out yet, so I'm not going to know. Spoiler alert here. He showed me the names of the people that are going to be on just talking about why they love that movie. Um, if it's not out yet, look forward. If it is out, listen to, it's what I'm going to do to do, you know what I listened to on, I was driving out to go visit some family out here and uh, Nia put on this podcast of, um, they interviewed that guy that just walked off, walked off the base there or the little area in, in um, Afghanistan, the American troop that just, just walked off and then got captured by the Taliban and was there for five years.

Speaker 1:          00:39:06       They interviewed the Guy, dude, it was, I listened to like three of them. Why even know about that? Yeah. Cause it's a big thing now. Should they court martial Omer said they just let them go cause he did it on purpose. He said that because the leadership was so fucked up over there, he was trying to create a situation where people above would listen because his plan was to walk out and then come back and I don't know what was going up but like as American guy? Yeah, he just left the US base and started walking towards them. Yeah. And they captured him yet? Well he didn't, he didn't think he was going to get caught. I I I'm such an idiot. I'm already forgetting so much of it but all I just remember was at the end of it they're like this guy had like some sort of fucking, he didn't like where he was in life and he had like a hero complex.

Speaker 1:          00:39:53       Okay. And he was trying to, like, he was trying to have like a Hollywood movie moment and he got his dumb ass caught and then all these troops had to fucking go look for him and put themselves in danger is they were trying to get the, the American guy to Pakistan because they get them into Pakistan because we're not at war with them. We can't just roam all over the place and look for him. And, uh, these fucking guys for like three weeks straight, which is like to do, could not rest. They have fun and have dealt exactly and the fucking close. We're almost fallen off just from March and just trying to find this guy. So some of them were saying like, dude, I swear to God, if I found the guy would've shot him. And then the NPR lady's like, well, I don't understand that.

Speaker 1:          00:40:32       It's like, how do you not understand that? Oh fuck that guy. I wouldn't even left the base. I'd be like, fuck out of and scream animal. He left. Yeah. I'm not calming. Yeah, it. Fuck you. Yeah. You better find him before I do. Yeah, Dude. Fuck that guy because he doesn't like where he's in life. He puts some fucking risk of every one of the guys said when I finally made the trade off because we had to trade like guys who Guantanamo Bay to get the fucking guy back. And uh, they was saying when the Apaches landed, this one guy was saying he wanted to be on the helicopter and they will like, why? He goes, because I wanted to stay. We're going to beat his ass. Fuck it. I don't understand. Like I don't think they literally would have shot him, but somebody saying that like, you had a fuck cause I'm going to fucking shoot who somebody would have punched him in the face and knocked him out and be like, dude, you're putting your fucking absolutely soldiers resolute.

Speaker 1:          00:41:20       Fucking perhaps a fucking loser. What, what was his end game? What did he want to happen? He wants, it was like, it wasn't just his guys by the, it was like an entire fucking platoon of people just walking around. That's her day and af fucking Dan is Stan for a month trying to find this fucking guy. And they're all sitting there going like, like one of the guys who saves trying to keep the morale up, make a jokes and shit, and he goes into the, in the end he goes to the back of your head, you know, it's all bullshit. And the employee are ladies like, why should I always make fun of the impure people even though I love the station? Um, that's ridiculous. He goes, cause I knew it, you know, after a certain amount of days of guys in Pakistan, we just have to, we got to at least look for the, we have to do this level of force to the Taliban.

Speaker 1:          00:42:04       Fuck him up. Well, what, because you know what was funny was because of the amount of people that were looking for him, they thought he was a really important guy. Uh, so I think that they went more towards trading the guy. I mean, I only listened to like two and a half of them, but it's real. I couldn't listen to the whole fucking thing because once it was like, once I found out the reason why he did it, um, I was just like, dude, you, you get, you're, you're off. You're just fucking fuck. Yeah. And he's trying to come off, like he says, Guy who was really trying to do something noble. It's like, no dude, you have like some sort of hero fantasy. It's a selfish move dude. Yeah. And you were going to get in front of like the brigadier fucking general or whatever and they were going to listen to you and be like, wow, this guy's making sense.

Speaker 1:          00:42:51       You know, we're going to change all of this. Yeah. I don't, I don't, I, I, I was listening to it and I just like, the sickest thing was when he was talking about like, he could do it, he gets like 20 minutes away from the base and realizes he makes this huge fucking mistake and yeah. And he wants to fucking go back. But he got lost and then because he's so fucking terrified, his fucking ego kicks in again and he decides to go even further into the shit. Oh Man, do something. Like I was just sitting there going like, yeah, I do like your middle. Literally keep palms are sweating but sort of, but you know he's getting caught and you know that he made it. So that took a little of the edge off. But it's just like, dude, like they literally skin people alive out there that fuck you're doin.

Speaker 1:          00:43:33       Do their cut and fix the fucking heads off dude. Well that's what they would when they would do, what's funny is the Afghany people are on the podcast talking of some of the guys that found them, not the Taliban guys, but they're funny going like, uh, they're like, what did he seem like they will laugh and I go, yeah, he seemed pretty scared. That was the funny thing. Listen to the Afghan, they just sound regular. You know what I mean? Cause there was makeup everybody out to be a fucking monster and it was ray. Yay. Seems scared. So at one point they wanted, because they couldn't speak English and speak that they were trying to make them feel like, don't worry, we're not going to kill you at this, you know, so there was some sort of dance that they did and the, and he goes, freak me.

Speaker 1:          00:44:12       Exactly again, we're going to kill this guy. So they though they said that that calm him down and the Afghany guy laughed. He goes, Nah man, it made them more nervous. Go Dude. I would have done some sacrificial like that's like the ready to kill, Ya know? It was fucking funny. But with the thing about it is, so what I liked, the thing that I enjoyed most about the podcast, I was listening to somebody on the other, or just a towns person over there just sounded regular and cool because the way they make it, see this is the stories you hear over there. When I picture Afghanistan, I just picture a barren wasteland and if you walk anywhere there, somebody is going to jump out from behind a rock and saw your head off as you're alive. Yeah. I think of, I think of it, uh, while lighting the other part of the bond fair foot turban going, we will, yeah, they touch you think.

Speaker 1:          00:45:02       Yeah. And then he listen to this guy going. Yeah, we did the common values. Like, Nah, Beta one, nervous listening. I'd fucking hang out with this guy. So anyways, all right. That's the Thursday afternoon podcasts. Do it. I'm psyched. You're out here on another great year. A bunch of great shows. So we're going to do tonight, uh, downtown La fucking Rogan's at the uh, uh, the Wiltern. Yeah. Lot of comedy here tonight. I can't believe, uh, enough people showed up for ours to make it good shows here. Um, you know, with rogue and a robe with a fucking monster. You ever seen him live long time ago? Ah, unbelievable. So it's huge. Huge, uh, like, uh, influenced when I, when I first saw him as far as like, like, uh, there was such like a glass ceiling to headlining and Boston. Yeah. It was just like, he just didn't have, they had the legends and they weren't leaving and they were fucking hilarious.

Speaker 1:          00:45:54       So there was only, so you had a, he was the guy that like, like I learned like you got to leave to come back and headline because if you stay here it's literally you got to wait for people to die. It's like getting fucking season tickets to the packers. It's like it's not happening man. I got to go move to where in Jacksonville I'll get 50 yard line seats. That's kind of actually cool that Boston like doesn't let those guys die out. A lot of places. Let those guys die out and they turn into dinosaurs and it's almost like a sad thing where the thing is they didn't stop writing. So they just kept going and going and going and going.

Speaker 1:          00:47:29       first. He's got me addicted to Florentines podcast and now verse, he does like, he does a pretty good Florentine Florentine is the funniest motherfucker Florentine complaining about anything. Oh my God, that role buys camera robot. You're fucking kidding me. Garbage fucking Geo. Like a Fox News robot. Fucking you got that height robot the way it goes up. All right. Like drags the word out at half time. So again, that's really good man. He's fucking funny man. Let's get it to that guy complained. Really, really like we never seen a beautiful woman before bud light commercials. I can ridiculous. Um, alright. Uh, we got here, this is a okay. Sunglasses. There's some really some weird ones this week. People like this guy says, hey bill, I need, I need to uh, make my listeners sent in like questions and shit. And I read it just to let you know.

Speaker 1:          00:48:23       Billion. I need to ask you a very important question. My wife makes fun of my choice of sunglasses. She's thinks they're not hip enough. Um, I told her I was wearing brown tinted sunburst aviators since college, before the whole aviator hype is there. Aviator, I don't even remember top. Yes, we say it back then. Those people who in 1980, right? Yeah. Who wanted to be like Tom Cruise. You know, my neighbor, when I was growing up, any movie that Tom Cruise was in, he got into that, like whatever. It was like a top gun. He joined like the fucking, uh, no, he, no, he joined like the, the, the, the, the air force reserves, the alligator on it. He joined that and then, um, days of thunder, he started racing cars. No cocktail. He became like a bartender. His Rich Dad got him out of the fucking reserves.

Speaker 1:          00:49:12       Yeah. He started getting into that. And what else did he do? There was like three things. So it kind of became this running joke, like whatever, fuck a Tom cruise movie was coming out. And then eventually he moved out to la finally. Just, well, why don't we just be a fucking actor, you know, so not to actually join the fucking air force. That's a don't know what ever happened to him. So anyway, aviator glasses, which were, yeah, the Tom Cruise fan slash date rapist. Remember that fucking kid I was talking about him. Do you remember that kid who he had the rough sex with a girl on them in central park and she died? No, you're too young for that. Yeah. This guy. Yeah. Fucking psycho. No, he killed her. He tried to, he tried to, he tried to say that they, that she wanted rough sex, it was consensual and I don't know what it is.

Speaker 1:          00:49:54       He accidentally killed her, whatever. I mean the whole of the meetings who are killing it. Yes. Price kill it. Crushed it. Fucking crushed it. Um, so anyways, do, that's fucking brutal. So anyway, put this guy, you know what actually made me mad when he got out of prison? Not only that, that, that he got out of on two loves and maybe mad, first of all, the guy got out of prison, but uh, the idiots on the news going off on the guy was saying, because when he got out, he wasn't on parole because he did all his time because he didn't get time off for good behavior because they were just like, you know, he had fights in prison, he was selling drugs and blah, blah, blah. It's like, yeah, the, all the, all that that says in there is he didn't get raped. He did what he had to do in there to survive.

Speaker 1:          00:50:43       So on some level yet you have to respect that because that's, that's the big fear is a guy. Did he raped a girl or it was just rough sex? I don't know what he did. I don't know. What has such a big difference though? Well, I don't know if he went like Ron our tests, like it was going good and he was excited and then he fucking elbow. Why are we joking about this? Fucking started pounding his chest and then they didn't show the replay because it was a home game. Um, no, he, he fucking a, I dunno how long did it, do they let them out of jail? Yeah, he did like all 15 or 16 years because they couldn't get him on murder because he said it was like, I know like on, on rape trials like that, what they always do, like the, the hardest thing to get them on is when they say it was consensual, so then all DNA is out the fucking window.

Speaker 1:          00:51:34       Then you have to like, it's, it's, it's, it's the worst fucking thing. If, if somebody does that to a woman that they should be. Honestly they should. They should just, they should have like a flame thrower and they should just have it pointed at the defendant and Jerry, would you like to read on the count of a rape leave? Find him guilty in the first degree it says just light them on fire right in front of the family. Yeah, right in front of it. Right in front of the family. That's how I would run it. Just same, same thing with a child molester star. That's the word I'm lessons. That's it. Sean molested. I would actually have them get chased by rabid dogs first and then to descend. He got fucking, the Sandusky guy should get fucking drawn and quartered in the courtroom. I always put his fucking body parts in her.

Speaker 1:          00:52:14       He should be underneath an oil tanker and then they should drive it to fucking or is that all you've got to drive a boat, drive it to like, fuck man, that's walking this earth these. If that's what I would do with that guy, what I would do with that guy. Well, I would go into shark infested waters and I would give him a bunch of paper cuts and at time to the front of, Oh my God, I never heard of that one. That's, that's a good one, man. Well, Paul, you've got understand, wait, when you do something like that to somebody, you didn't just, you, you ended that kid's life and then you affect the generations of people because who they're going to marry, how they're going to treat the person they married, how they're going to treat their kids, and then the treatment of the kids, how they're going to act in society, society.

Speaker 1:          00:52:55       It just, it creates, it's like that little Confucius thing when you drop the pebble in the still pond and the ripples just go like that. He got a little poetic on you. It's like that. No, see, that's what I say. Time to the front of a boat. Paper cuts, shark infested waters. And that's it. And you know what's fun and this is the thing about it. That's fine. That'd be awesome. Um, and it's still wants stop him. It's the one stop it from happening, but you should just start weeding them out. Like that's a sickness man from young. That's fucking crazy, man. Yeah. That's just uh, uh, and it ruins the lives of everybody but put the kid forever. Yeah. So why you saying what I just said Paul. Oh, did you set it up so you won't even listen to the typical comedian you're thinking about what you were going to say?

Speaker 1:          00:53:37       Literally exactly what I just said. No, I was thinking about the singing. I was thinking about him actually like hitting the thing like a boat. Oh, that's right. You got, you got that. You got that weird fucking shit where you, you every once in a while you think about doing crazy stuff, right? I was getting nervous about admitting this type of stuff. Like someday if you're like on trial, like, you know, I'm going to get put in contempt of court because that's still never rat you out. But it'd be like, we were talking about, you guys talked about this on the podcast, but it killed me. It was a joke.

Speaker 1:          00:54:08       Oh, we didn't ask the fucking guys question here. We were talking about avs. He said, what's the breakdown of Douchey sunglasses verse acceptable versus acceptable ones? What kind of sunglasses do you wear? And does Nia have any say in the matter? I imagine you were very nonthreatening, low profile shades. I can't tell if that's an insult or if he's calm. Sounds like an insult, right? Um, no, I don't think it's an insult. I think this guys genuinely wants to know what you could wear to make his girl stop trashing them. Well, this is what you have to do. First of all, depending on where you are and your relationship is, is if you feel secure in your relationship, maybe she's just doing you a solid and telling you that you look like a Douche. But if she's always telling you everything what to do, that you have to continue wearing those glasses and you have to wear them over to her mother's house.

Speaker 1:          00:54:55       Defiance, yes. And, and wear them into the house and don't take them off when a mom's talking to you. That's like a buddy, a buddy of mine. Right. Do Women know? Women just, I just want me to say something real quick. Oh God. More women trashing her slip. You're going to be nice to them. Like, could you like a guy's really thinking about it and this happens all the time. This guy's got a genuine concern here. But like for like, I've heard of guys going, yeah, my girl just looked over at me and looked at that shirt and goes, oh, it's such a turn off. Take it off and I want to be, it's in my mind, I'm just like, I want to be like, dude, shut up. Are you at? Yeah. But those guys, those guys deserve it. They fucking deserve it. Paul, if you, if you let the woman in your life talk to you like that, they fucking deserve it the same way a woman deserves it.

Speaker 1:          00:55:33       If, if that guy is a fucking as a minus, then beating the shit out of you. But I got it. Yeah. Mine isn't beating the shit out of you, but like if they beat you up and that's just complete bullshit, quit. If they're walking around being a fucking asshole, disrespecting you, that that's on you. Okay. You guys break up with them. But what if the guy says to him, you shut up and I'm wearing the shirt. Shut up. Yeah. Is he a dick now? Right. But then it's like, oh, I'm like, I don't, that's a total turnoff that discussed. We take that off. Just flip it around. What if you ever said that to you girl? Exactly. Disgusting. It makes you look fat. You come on, you'd never do that. Even if you said that disgusts me, that would be it. Listen, here's my aunt threw the fucking dessert that night at the meal.

Speaker 1:          00:56:11       Well, here's my answer to your, to your, uh, your listener's question here. If you like 'em dude, and you look in the mirror and you go, you know something, I liked it. I liked the glare. I like, if it's orange tint or whatever, you'd like it fucking where Paul, you know some, that's why you and your was so comfortable to hang around because how many times you guys tell each other go, fuck you. See you say go fuck yourself. Right. You do that right now we'll just be like, ah, you know, something shut like, yeah, shut up. Not Enough. But Lloyd in a loving way, like, uh, yeah, but you have to, you have to keep them. You got to keep off the same way. She has to keep you off or you know, she didn't keep you in check. You'd golf fucking nine times a week, right?

Speaker 1:          00:56:43       Yeah, no, no, absolutely. There's a fine line. And what's like, you know, yes, exactly. Dude. I had a buddy of mine, he fucking, we went fishing right when we were done fishing. Uh, you know, we drank a bunch of booze or whatever. We were smoking cigars and his wife pulls up and you know, they told their kid about the dangers of smoking, right? So the kid starts fucking crying and blah. There's all this big fucking thing. And the kid, the guy was literally in the dog house and I guess maybe because the kid was crying, I kind of saw her point, but he's one of those fucking guys. I, I wanted to save him. Like, dude, you know what really helped your relationship next time you drop your kid off in the car, take out a big fat fucking Cuban and just light it up.

Speaker 1:          00:57:21       Yeah. And again, what are you doing? I'm smoking a cigar because I enjoy it when I come home I'm going to watch a game and I'm smoking this fucking cigar. And when she says why you say, because you can go fuck yourself and that and I'm telling you it's a little blunt. You can, you can round off the edges. I want to say you could go fuck yourself. I'm just saying that would help you a relationship. It's like that movie. Remember that movie there with the Kevin Spacey when she comes home? What does that in the driveway? He's like, that is a 1969 Firebird and he just, I went out, bought it cause I wanted it go fuck you. Like, and you saw the look on her face. There was a shift for the better in that relationship. But doesn't he die in the end? I he get killed. I don't know. It was that was that, that was a weird one. He wanted to fuck that 12 year old. Fuck that movie. Sitting with rose petals falling all over him. Um, so we're saying, you know what, you, whether you were the God damn sunglasses you want to surface, right.

Speaker 3:          00:58:19       Rather was done with it. Rather rather the and a dog base man, rather wake up, shower. No. [inaudible].
