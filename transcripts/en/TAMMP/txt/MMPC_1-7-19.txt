Speaker 1:          00:00          Hey, what's going on? It's, hey, what's going on? Sorry. Didn't know if this thing was on or not. It's bill burn his time for the Monday morning podcast for Monday, January seven, 2018 what's going on? How, wow. Yeah. Um, it's fucking three 32 in the morning and uh, I slept a little bit, but just been having a motherfucker of a time with this jet lagged over here and you know why it is. It's cause I'm not booze. Okay. This one's for all you alcoholics out there. I'm fucking with you. People keep telling me to go get Melatonin and send natural way to get tired. Um, all I know is the unnatural way to get tired, tired, which was, uh, what I always did was just the first night I tried to stay up and then I'd go out and I would just go get, I'd go booze and I'd have four fucking stiff drinks and just come home and pass out.

Speaker 1:          01:02          And then I'd start to get acclimated to their time. I'd have to do that about three nights in a row and that I was fine. Um, so whatever. I just been, so I got to do this fucking podcast because today I'm getting on a plane and I'm flying to a stonier to do one show tonight. I'm very excited about it. I googled some pictures, first of all, Astonia Jesus Christ. What a bad ass flag. That's one of those things that I collect. I don't buy a lot of touristy shit, so I just get those little flags. So I gotta make sure I get the time to go down and pick one of those up. Then I got love for you the next day. This is the part of the tour where I start going to all these places I've never been to as far as countries goes. But, um, the last two nights I started in Cologne.

Speaker 1:          01:50          I had been there before. Um, we did Munich on Saturday and yesterday we did often back often buck. And um, it's just been a fucking great time being over here with the burrows. Sorry, my voice is going through, you know, I'm trying to make sure I have good shows and I don't know. I don't know what the fuck I did to it, but, uh, yesterday I should say Saturday and Sunday we had two shows Munich to and often buck. And the first fucking show was like at 3:30 PM. This is what kills me. I've never in my career that I can really remember ever gone on stage like that. I mean at that time, I think maybe one time I was doing hilarious and Cleveland and I did an afternoon show, but I think that was at like four or five, I don't know, just three 30.

Speaker 1:          02:45          It was fucking weird, but I got to tell you, the crowd was unbelievable. Munich crowds were fucking ridiculous. I mean, they've all been great, but they were just like, we were in like this, I swear to God that fall it goes on like a little barn and um, it was like snowing out and I had to walk from the green room back outside into the snow and then back into the venue and I was just like, these motherfuckers are trying to get me sick. So my coat on their big stupid palm palm hat that I got in Finland, where back in the day, which has been saving my ass, that the vitamin C pack, it's in a bowl shows. The crowds were just crazy good. And uh, in between shows I ran around trying to find my daughter's, some sneakers, some cool sneakers. I have found this store called early, somebody told me about.

Speaker 1:          03:37          And uh, we drove over there and I bought a couple pairs of sneakers. I go to the forest Gump once, you know, the classic Nike Cortez. And I made sure that I got the, uh, the Velcro straps so she can get a little fat fucking Tyler feet and they're, you know, um, but it was pretty fucking cool because in the middle of the city they had this giant, giant wall going on, you know, and it couldn't see how it could, we just literally drove by and it was the original wall of the city, um, for like back in the day when there was just like, you know, it was a free for all. He just sat in your village and all of a sudden some fucking assholes would just show up and just start murdering the man and rape and the women in and shit on fire.

Speaker 1:          04:21          And it was just like, like that's what people did back then. Like that was like a fucking like something that someone has spired too. They aspired to rape and pillage and he just fucking lunatic shit. So these people you know, wanted to survive. So they would build these giant walls, I guess around their fucking villages. Then someone's trying to tell me a teller. The Hud used to save the bodies from the previous village and then he'd sneak up on a village, he'd late, the body's on fire and then with like a catapult would start shooting them into the fucking village he wanted to attack. Like you just sitting there chilling out, enjoying yourself and like all the sudden, you know, I dunno what was the job back then? Some fucking copper Smith comes through the top of your fucking little hut. They're on fire and lands on your God damn dinner table.

Speaker 1:          05:22          And that that was, that was the first sign that your life was going to fucking change. I mean, Jesus fucking Christ. It's crazy. And I, I don't know what it is about Europe maybe cause I watched all this shit about World War II and it, you know, and a lot of, you know, American history, they don't give a fuck about, um, you know, the whole curriculum was designed by white descendants from Europe. So that's all we fucking talked about. So you just know certain shit and of course they, you, they dance around a lot of shit. Um, but as I've been over here, like we, when we took the train from fucking Munich up to often Bach, uh, they will like next stop like Nuremberg. And I'm like Norenberg like Nuremberg trials. For some reason I thought that that was, those trials were in France. And now that I'm getting exposed a little more of the German language, I'm like, well, obviously that's not a fucking French city. Um,

Speaker 2:          06:24          okay.

Speaker 1:          06:24          So I'm on the train and I'm texting version to be like, dude, this is where they fucking try it. All the Nazis, the SS and the Gestapo and shit. After World War II when they like, they'd like fucking put him to death and shit, hanging them and everything. And uh, I'm texting him and he can't fucking, yeah, he's not getting service. So Mike Versie Versie he looks up, you know, he's a couple seats away, you know, but out of the respect for German people, I don't want to be like, hey, this is where they fucking killed all the Nazis have to function. World War Two. I walked over to him and I started to say it, but because I'm speaking English, people just look at you like, oh, these are fucking American. What's judge him? Is he fat? Is he breathing through his mouth? You know, is he loud? So I just literally had to show him the text. Um,

Speaker 1:          07:12          and I'm sitting there, you know, like when you go to fucking Berlin, that's where Hitler killed himself in part of his bunker. Still exist. I know they, they fucking destroyed most of it. The Soviet state. And then they build just like an apartment building around it. You know, it's like Los Angeles. How they do that shit. They just knocked shit down and they don't give a fuck what happened. And I get it. Cause the guy was so fucking evil. But like, I'm just like, wow, it's so fucking crazy that peep the German people just walk amongst all of this shit. And then I was like, wait a minute. I live in the United States of America. I go down south all the time. I can't imagine what the fuck happened. Right where I'm sitting when I'm sitting in a fucking waffle house. Like if that used to be like a plantation or some slave was running away and they got caught and God knows what the fuck happened. Forget about the native Americans. So I was like, well, why the fuck

Speaker 2:          08:07          okay.

Speaker 1:          08:08          Do I only think about that shit you don't like every time I go to Paris, like when I look at this, Sean's Elisa, that fucking street, I just pictured when the Nazis fucking paraded up the damn thing. Uh, when the occupied their country and when the allied forces, when they took it back. Um, I mean all the French ladies banged a bunch of Americans of identity. Um, how come I don't think of that shit, my own country. It's just cause cause I grew up there, it's fucked. I almost thought that would be like a weird,

Speaker 2:          08:39          yeah.

Speaker 1:          08:39          When those Saifai fucking movie slash horror movies that um, I don't know if you just, if you, I get them because they kind of do it. They do it on like light shit. Like if you move into a house and someone got murdered there in the 20s, right? Like let me tell something. She, I'm going to just let you from fucking history here. Right. Then all of a sudden that place is haunted, but they don't like maybe American horror story did it. I don't fucking know. I watch sports, but um, anyway, um,

Speaker 2:          09:11          okay.

Speaker 1:          09:12          And then, then I'm reading all of this shit and it's like about the Nuremberg trial when I'm on the fucking train and making sure nobody's looking over my shoulder and I'm seeing how like they had to decide how they were going to go sort of the first time I think of World War One, they tried to do it, but this is the first time they were trying to make people pay for their fucking war crimes. So you know, FDR and fucking Churchill and all these guys are trying to figure out how they're going to go about doing it. And FDR balked at something and then he died and then Truman came in and was just like, well wait a minute.

Speaker 2:          09:45          Okay,

Speaker 1:          09:46          yeah. Truman came in and was like, no, we're going to do that shit. So he must have still been at war with Japan. And then he goes and he drops to fucking nuclear weapons on fucking Japan. Like it was, it's like they were all fucking world war criminals. We sitting there firebombing Dresden and shit. It's like women and children down there. It's, it's cell. I don't know. That's why I always say like, to this day, I can't believe that like war is still a legal, you know, slash like glorified. And uh, I mean, I understand defending your country and shit like that. If there's a fucking lunatic out there, but like, you know who's kidding, who you know a lot. You know, there's been a lot of iffy decisions made out there for, you know, it's just, it's a fucking land grab you going after oil, you know, you, you want, you know what that land, because it's, it's got some water around it. I mean, that's why people go to fucking war most of the time it seems nowadays. Anyways. Um,

Speaker 1:          10:49          but anyways, I dunno, some of that leads to me to talking about fucking thin privilege. I follow this guy, Yannis Pappas on the Instagram. He's like, fucking genius does all these characters and stuff. So I'm always watching him. Kyle done again. Jeff Richards, they're like my favorite, like the fucking characters. They do the fucking geniuses, right? So I was watching his and he posted something about it. So I'm going, what the fuck is thin privilege? I already know. I have white privilege, evidently I have been privileged to like if it was like monopoly and there was a stretch, a little properties that were the privileged properties. Like I feel like I got some of those little green houses on a lot of them. So evidently it's a privilege.

Speaker 2:          11:36          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          11:36          To be thin rather than a reward for having the discipline.

Speaker 2:          11:42          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          11:43          To push yourself away from the fucking table. You know? And I'm not, I'm not talking about when you were a kid and you just, some people have baby felt like I had baby fat. I was a fat fucking kid. I was like 10 pounds. You know, when I was born, I was a big fucking read Charlie Brown. Look at fucking baby. There's not one to picture of me till I'm like three in my head was literally almost the size it is right now when I was at adult. Like I literally from day one look like I could fuck up a Lego city. Right. And um,

Speaker 2:          12:16          okay.

Speaker 1:          12:17          You know, if I just use that to my advantage, that'd be on the playground and people be fucking with me cause my orange hair and I just lean on him, you know, like a, like a boxer that just wearing them out in the early rounds. And then I just fucking, you know, bunch of body shots and it would be over me with my big flabby freckled arms. And then somewhere in like junior high, I just sort of leaned out like all of a sudden I grew a little bit and uh, and then I stopped growing and then I was just a small skinny kid. I kind of had it all, you know, when it comes to the bullying, I was a fat kid when I was really young that I was, uh, but I was big and then I became small and I was skinny and you throw it all in there.

Speaker 1:          13:02          I had orange hair, so it was kind of inevitable that I was going to end up being some sort of a fucking comedian or something. I Dunno what, but um, anyways, this then privileged shit. It's like, they're like people who are thin need to fucking acknowledge. You know, it's up to you to realize how privileged you are that, you know, people don't judge you when you eat a cookie in public and above about and all this shit. This ain't well golf. Do they fucking judge me when I put on a pair of shorts, I look at how fucking white my legs are. You know, these fucking people. You know what kills me about Shit like that? All right, I get it. Where you shouldn't tease fad people and make them feel bad and all that, you know, it's fucking immature and it's me, I get it. Right? But on the other side, it's like there's no, there is no burden of responsibility. It's something that's totally fucking curable. And I know some people literally have like food addictions and like it's a psychological thing or whatever. But you know, for most people who are fat, it's just, you've just eaten too much fucking food.

Speaker 1:          14:08          You know? And considering most of the goddamn world is starving,

Speaker 1:          14:14          you know, it's just like, can you understood leave with this train of thought. Fat White people in a first world nation can literally walk around and call themselves victims. Well, you know, I don't know all of these fucking fatties I swear to God, that's why I did that bid on it at my last special. You need to go to some countries where the people are really have some problems. I mean, you can even go to score on the fucking Internet and read about it. He could fill a hell of a lot fucking better about yourself. You know, I was sitting there, uh, you know, I was getting frustrated with being fucking, uh, jet lagged and ship and these three 30 in the afternoon show is, I was like, fuck man, now I can't fucking sleep. And I was like feeling like I was a Zombie and I was getting all grumpy and shit and then I could go on the Internet and I'm like, wait a minute.

Speaker 1:          15:08          Okay. So if Nuremberg is here, where was Auswitch us? I can only say it right? The concentration camp police, right. And it turns out it's in Poland and I was like, well I don't have the time, it's going to be too far away. So I kind of googled some fucking pictures of it and shit. And I looked at it and I was like, oh my God, I could never fucking go there. I mean literally like you're fucking blood runs cold, like looking at the shit. And then they had like, you know, pictures of like piles of like kids shoes and shit. And I'm literally buying shoes for my kid and I'm just like going, am I really bitching that I have a three 30 fucking show? Kind of a fucking asshole. Am I right? I think people eating fucking hot fudge Sundaes. I'd do that every once in a while.

Speaker 1:          15:48          You know what I mean? They got to look up a bunch of starve and fucking kids in the middle of nowhere. Not even in the middle of nowhere, in the middle of where the world for whatever reason considers nowhere before you sit there and try to like figure out a new way to try and fuck up. Some of these career cause that's going to be another thing. This is such a weird fucking time of so many God damn people like they just keep trying to like, I keep looking at it like a bike race. Like they try to get behind somebody who has like a legitimate complaint. Like I gotta be honest with you, the fact that white women can fucking use the term white male privilege and they're like a white woman, the United States of America. The fact that they can somehow hop on the other side of the fence as some sort of like, you know, um, underprivileged group.

Speaker 1:          16:41          And I'm not saying that, you know, they don't get less than white males, but it's just like, should I really be listening to your complaints next? Are you really going to be first in line? You actually have white privilege when it comes to complaining because people are going to pay attention to your shit first even though you're suffering the least. Right. As far as my complete lack of research goes, as far as me babbling here, fucking foreign the goddamn morning in our real, I hope I'm that weekend, somebody up mumbling here. Um, anyways, so I guess that's the latest thing that can get you to not fucking, I dunno, sell some tickets on the road or a fucking, you know, host an awards show, like whatever the fuck we're going to do. You know, you know, it blows my mind about that whole ward show scandal is, I just love how whatever was said was said around 2011 and all these adults who were well old enough, well old enough, we're plenty old enough to have gotten offended back then and made a big stink.

Speaker 1:          17:46          And for some reason it doesn't fucking come out. It's almost like they get you on something that like, all right, hold onto that card. You know what I mean? Like they playing grantee fucking water and then they wait till you get something big enough that's going to shine a light in their cars and then they come back and they fucking train, slam it down on the fucking table. Um, I was out of the country, but as far as what I read, Ellen degenerates as cool in my book for the rest of the fucking time, you know, and I thought whatever she was trying to do as a pho is the way to go about stuff like that where you just don't try to fucking destroy somebody. You try to get them, see your point, try to get people on your side to be, hey, give this person another chance.

Speaker 1:          18:35          You have it. Be Open like that. You open it up to a discussion and then people just watch it and learn some shit rather than just being like, this person said this, now they can't have that now let's watch them fucking, you know, lose something. You know who she's just sitting there watching for the fucking entertainment value. Um, this is one of my favorite things to do by the way, is to get out of my fucking high horse here and preach at a quarter to four in the fucking morning, whatever fucking time it is here. Um, all right, let's talk a NFL playoffs. I missed most of them. I was able to watch a little bit of that eagles bears game, um, in German, which was pretty cool. Um, cause he kept enough of the English words that I was able to, you know, kind of know what the fuck they were talking about.

Speaker 1:          19:25          And uh, I know everybody's going to get on the bears kicker, but can somebody please explain to me why the fuck you go for a two point conversion. When the bears did that, why not just fucking kicked the goddamn thing and then you end up losing by one? John Madden my entire fucking life said he'd take the points. You'd take the points, you'd take the points, those extra points come back to hot yet I know this guy, I missed that. I guess he hit a number of fucking gold posting. He hit the CROC goalposts and the crossbar. And the last one I watched the highlights, but why the fuck are you going for two points there? Makes it just, you know, well choose you only up by two. You're acting like it's the end of the game with the fucking two minutes to go. There's a whole bunch of time left and I forget when it happened, the end of the third quarter, beginning of fourth quarter, but there was plenty of fucking time. We're just a complete non factor.

Speaker 1:          20:17          Just take that extra fucking point. Just take the fucking thing and then see where the fuck you are with the last five minutes. Then you start playing that game. You know everybody's going like Patrick, one l like pulling the fucking goalie with like 10 minutes left in the game, which for some reason actually worked for him. So congratulations to uh, to the eagles, to Nick's falls, man. But by the way though, that matched her bisky man had a brisk is acs. Then we had a fucking break game two for over hundred yards. Um, I thought he was like really accurate and he was dealing with like the defending Superbowl champions. I thought it was great to next falls is that gate, you know, like I just fucking delivers. Um,

Speaker 2:          21:03          okay.

Speaker 1:          21:03          Oh my God. Pete Carroll, Jesus Christ, the poor fucking bastard. The poor fucking bastard man. He's getting a ton of shit in Seattle. I guess they thought he ran the ball too much and uh, I don't know what happened. That field goal kicker get fucking hurts and then they add their punch puncher there and he has to do an onside kick. Like why didn't he just do what they all do? Just stick it on the tee and then you kick the ball in a downward motion on the upper third of the fucking ball. So it pops up in the air. The guy just, he fucking just fucking basically lobbed it down the field that you know something.

Speaker 2:          21:42          Okay.

Speaker 1:          21:42          If Pete Carroll never won a Superbowl and they were going to make a statue of him, it would be him with his hands on his fucking knees just looking down at the ground in pain. He sorta the urban Meyer of a NFL coaches, you know, and that they both won, but they just have that fucking, they just said that, that's soul crushing. Whenever I see him do that. You don't, it reminds me of, it reminds me of Carl Yastrzemski when he back, who's backing up to the wall? When Bucky dent hit that three run homer and you just saw his legs buckle. Okay. It just reminds me of that every time I see that shit. So, um, I dunno, my condolences. I don't usually have condolences to Seattle fans, but I dunno if the rivalries kind of died down. You football fans, I feel for you. I've been there and all that shit. Um, congratulates the San Diego chargers and I forget who played the last game. All the colts, I guess the colts look good and Andrew luck is back, which is great. Um, other than that, I haven't been fucking doing anything here. I should probably do some of these reeds here. It's a podcast might be a little short because I have to get up, go to the airport. I'm already up. All right. Oh, look who's here. I can't do this. Read justice everybody. I apologize.

Honey even makes Amazon better with Millie and dude. Fuck Amazon. Who's fucking cons? Those assholes. They throw it over the fence. They consider it delivered. There is no return address. You never can figure out who the fuck sent it to you. It's a fucking nightmare with millions of sellers on Amazon offering the same products. How do you know if you're really getting the best price? How the fuck do you know if it was delivered? There's no fucking phone call. You got to bring it back down to a shop and they're just little little flows. We can tell it was delivered. We could formed it. Uh, that's where honey comes in. What? Cause the fucking driver said it was confirmed.

Speaker 1:          28:04          Honey automatically goes to wear to work. Whenever I shop on Amazon, I ordered this other shit on Amazon. It's fucking, and I never got it. I didn't know what the fuck is. It compares the PR. This is like the worst advertising read ever. It compares the prices of every seller that carries the item. I want honey, even factors in shipping, sales tax and Amazon prime status to make sure I'm getting the lowest price. It shows me the best delivery time, even if Amazon doesn't. Um, it's like having my very own personal shopping assistant. Of course, Amazon does it. He can't fucking get anybody on the phone. More than 10 million people are using honey to save money. Honey is so has over a hundred thousand five star reviews on Google. Maybe I need honey, so Amazon will work better for me. Um, the five star reviews on the Google Chrome store at Time magazine says it's basically free money.

Speaker 1:          28:56          So the next time you're in the world's biggest marketplace, looking for the best deals, treat yourself to the free upgrade that makes Amazon better. Add honey for free@jointhoney.com slash. Bird that's joint honey.com/. Bar. That's hilarious. I'm making fun of Amazon and everything that they don't do well, honey actually fixes it.

You know, can we grab one of these goddamn packets and I'll drink one now. Dude, this fucking hotel, I can't figure out. I can't figure out how to turn on the fucking heat, you know, but I, one of the things, the only thing I hate more than not being able to turn it on on the fucking heat is having to call down to the front desk and then they got to send somebody up. I just, I, I, I'd rather sit here and get sick.

Speaker 1:          32:12          Um, all right. So anyways, yes, we ordered room service as far as I can tell. The top three things on room service in Germany are, uh, I hamburger diener Schnitzel or spaghetti. And I actually, when I was in Munich I got some dean or Schnitzel, which I always thought was like a fucking hot dog, but I saw pork cutlet that's breaded. It was fucking delicious. Um, that's what's killing me about being here in Germany as I haven't had time to get like a proper German meal. Uh, just been traveling so much and uh, you know, I, I'm never going to do ancestry.com, but as far as the names of my family tree, I know I am mostly German.

Speaker 2:          32:58          MMM.

Speaker 1:          33:00          I love this shit. I was fucking sausages and fucking beer and all that. It kills me. I'll tell you the next time I come here to Germany, which I'm definitely going to do because it's been so much fun. I am going to be beyond off the wagon and I'm trying all these fucking be, I'm going to book myself out here in October fest. I wouldn't buy a little beyond October fest outfit outfit and I'm going to fucking drink my ass off, but not on this tour. Oh, Billy. No Fun. It's coming up on 50 days. It just being a fucking douchebag. Um, anyways, so let's plow ahead here. Let's read some of these fucking thanks for the week. Uh, just another one about Poland. All right. Very excited to go to Poland to very excited. They've got a bottle, Berlin. All it like all the rest of this tour is just going to be just a bunch of bar.

Speaker 2:          33:53          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          33:53          It's just a bunch of Shit I've never seen. I would speaking to that guest who came out to the show last night, guess who the fuck showed up? One of my favorite drummers, one of the greatest drummers in the world, Benny grab showed up with his lovely girlfriend. I hate naming names and everything, but everybody knows who the fuck he has, right? Yeah.

Speaker 2:          34:12          MMM.

Speaker 1:          34:14          He fuck, I couldn't vote. You know, I, it's just, it's unbelievable. Um, if you're a drummer out there and you want to see somebody who possesses one of the rare things in drumming, which is incredible feel passion, playing from the heart combined with ridiculous chops. And the thing that I've found with, with drumming is when you get those chops guys, a lot of times when they play there between their ears, like they're in their head and they have all this really intricate shit but it disconnected to who they are as a person. And then if you have like a group player, you know, if they go to take a solo, if they even do, it's uh,

Speaker 1:          35:00          you know, it's still good because it's still grows, but it's not like the crazy, uh, I dunno, I'm just saying those guys that have those fucking insane shops, we would think even buddy rich will be going like, dude, what the fuck are you doing there nowadays? How far drumming has come because everybody, the Internet's, but basically everybody's watching everybody. Everybody's jamming and learning from each other. Uh, it's just so rare to meet a guide that has his chops and plays the way he does. So he does clinics all around the world and uh, he's got some DVDs out there at all and there's no fucking way that you won't be tremendously changed for the better if, if you start watching his videos. So it's Benny, Benny, Greg, B. E n n y, g. R, e B I believe. I'm not sure if this too, I can't fucking spell anything. Just check them out if you can. All right. Anyways, just another one about Poland. Uh, Dear Mc run from the sun.

Speaker 1:          35:58          I like that one. Uh, I am honestly thrilled then in a few days you're going to show up in my not so beautiful city of Warsaw. Don't tell me that. Well, I live in a not so beautiful city of La and I love it. I like how it's gritty and grimy and all that Shit, you know? Sorry, drinking, modified. Ever see here? Uh, mainly because um, okay. I'm honestly thrilled that you are going to be in a few days and you're going to show up. It might not so beautiful city of Warsaw, mainly because I'm selling my house and you are so white that you're rising the property value whenever you arrive. Sky's hilarious. Or Lady, let's be fair. Um, I don't want to fin shame anybody or whatever the fuck you were talking about it. Um, but since you're kind enough to do one of those pussy ass shows of yours, I will definitely come. I like this guy breaking fucking balls. Uh, you, you are going to love Poland

Speaker 1:          36:58          as Yossef. Polenski used to say it's a great nation. Only people are constantly, Whoa, wait a minute, dude. Is everybody is funny as you wouldn't, Poland is just going to be another fucking country I go to where I'm just like, oh my God, these guys remind me that people I grew up with, I felt that an Ireland, I felt it in Scotland. I felt that in India. Just that, that busted shops ball break and fucking thing is Mike. It's my favorite thing in the world. Um, anyways, as for the city of Warsaw, well she's not the prettiest of Gals, but let's be fair. That bitch, that bitch went through some shit. Uh, we are watching American show, so don't worry about making your pop culture references. We're currently watching Alf, and once we figure out why those jokes are funny, uh, we're gonna move on to Frazier. Dude, can you please start doing standup or something? This is just all of this has just written really fucking funny. Uh, you could also consider renting a helicopter here since it's much cheaper than the u s although Polish helicopter, it's just a horse wearing a windmill hat. Ah, right. You had one fucking Polish joke day. Best wishes to your family and break your pasty leg on this tour. Ps, if you're interested in Soviet bloc history, God knows I didn't learn about that when I was growing up. Then you should check.

Speaker 2:          38:25          Okay.

Speaker 1:          38:26          A comedian freeze love. F R e Z. L U v talking about his military service in Berlin during the cold. Um, I will definitely check that out and I'll send out a link to this, uh, podcast episode here. Um, Oh, speaking of which, I've been having the best time with mercy, right? At first. He, the one thing I love about Versie is [inaudible] is [inaudible] okay? The way man was going to be Maddie pullovers these rosy, he's over here wearing his Jordans. You know, he's got his fucking Nike track suit on and we were in Cologne, Germany. Uh, did I tell you this yet? I've told them on stage so many times we were walking over this fucking bridge, right?

Speaker 2:          39:10          Okay.

Speaker 1:          39:11          Any Cologne, Germany, as I mentioned, was one of the most bomb cities in World War II. So there's not a lot of old stuff there because it just got destroyed. But they have this one beautiful church, right? So we're walking over the bridge. At first he is going like to look at that building, man. God, it's a beautiful building. It's that building. Beautiful. And I'm looking at is these cluster of whatever buildings and in the middle of it is this amazing church. So I'm looking at the build is going, what in the fuck is this guy saying? Like, well, what building? Because that building right there, look, it's fucking the architecture. It's beauty. It finally figured out, I was like, dude, are you talking about the fucking church?

Speaker 2:          39:46          Okay.

Speaker 1:          39:47          And he's like, yeah, that data. Oh No, I already told this story, told this story on Thursday. I'm still giving him shit about that. It's a great building. Um, all right. Oh, by the way, Versie Versie two Sicilian in Greek. He loved the vendors that sell too. And he's actually really enjoying, uh, Germany too, which made me happy. Cause sometimes there's Mediterranean guys, you know, they get all fucking upset about the food and this is no sunshine and Shit, you know? But he's been having a great time. All right. Gypsies. Hey there, Billy bloated brotts uh, I go to Romania. Oh, this is what I was talking about. We're learning that Gypsy is considered a racial slur.

Speaker 2:          40:29          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          40:29          All right. Listen to this first sentence. He goes, I go to Romania frequently for work and I'm quite versed in Gypsies and why it is a racial slur.

Speaker 2:          40:38          Okay.

Speaker 1:          40:39          Uh, in order to live about that was he still used the word gypsy. That's like if I was in America being like a, hey everybody, uh, for when you traveled to America, I've been to east St Louis and I'm quite versed and Edwards and why it's a racial slur. Like I wouldn't do that. That's kind of what he just did there. Uh, first Rome, Romanians are Gypsies. Roman people. Romanian people are descendants of Romans. I didn't know that. Gypsies are people that came from Egypt. Uh, if you want to insult a Romanian person called them a gypsy,

Speaker 2:          41:16          okay.

Speaker 1:          41:17          Gypsy stick to themselves and rob. Slash steal from outsiders. They will fight at the drop of a hat. I saw two old lady, Gypsies fighting over which corner they were selling flowers on in the old city in Bucharest. I hope this clears it up a little. Now it that didn't clear anything up.

Speaker 1:          41:37          Um, now I know that Romanians are Roman and Gypsies are people are from Egypt. I do know that. And then you went on to fucking trash him in a way that I'm sure they were upset about. I Dunno. Jesus Christ. Did I just get in trouble just by fucking reading it. So they got a lot of fight them. All right. What are you gonna do? I mean, we've, I've seen these videos of two San people dressed up like Santa Claus beating the fuck out of each other in my country. Uh, all right. But I didn't realize that Romanians, but almost it says Roman in there.

Speaker 2:          42:12          Okay.

Speaker 1:          42:13          Did Not know that. All right. I'll have to look a lot of that up. Double check, which means I'm not going to do it. I'll forget about it. And then the information you just told me, we'll be in my head and one day I'm going to spew it out, but I'm probably gonna get in trouble. All right. Recent breakup. Am I the asshole? Well, firstly, first of all, first dilly. What two words did I just, first of all,

Speaker 1:          42:41          it's certainly, I don't know what the fuck up though. Anyways, my girlfriend of three years broke up with me over something. Me and my family thinks is stupid. All right, so right now I'm a little nervous here. You know if families back in you, you know, or you're not one of those fucking young kids that can do no wrong you anyways. We are both 20 and since last February we've been so what generation are you, is that generation z? We are about 20 and since last February we've been arguing since we invited her to my birthday dinner and she got upset because she was expected to pay for her own meal. All right. Who? Who am I? Who's, who's her? Is that your girlfriend? Okay. I didn't tell my parents until months later because they didn't want to start anything. Anyway, around early December, my family asked me to invite her to come up with us too. My Dad's parents home or the 29th because that's when we could celebrate Christmas with them. When I texted her, she said, am I going to have to pay for my own gas? I have a s d I don't know what that means, so I assumed I was missing something.

Speaker 1:          43:57          So I do. Do you have like a d to the point that you have? Don't have the fucking time to write, add Reynaga to look up fucking eight ASD, all saints disease, a s d

Speaker 1:          44:13          you are not connected to them. You are not a winner. All right? I don't know what the fuck that is. I don't give a shit. I'll learn about it later. Um, I have ASD, so I assumed I was missing something. So I asked my dad and he said, of course she flipped out about it. I was that Berger's disease. Would that be a B, d or is that antilock brakes? I don't fucking know. Uh, that's ABS. She flipped out about it became, and it became the new thing we could argue about her mom and her sister agree with her that it's Shitty to not pay for someone's gas when you invite them someplace. But my dad's parents didn't pay for our guests.

Speaker 2:          44:55          Okay.

Speaker 1:          44:55          But no one we know asked for that. And all of our family members, we invite to be day dinners. Never complained about paying their own bill. Should I put pun not intended? I'd appreciate your advice, sir. And I'm a big fan. You seem pretty good with your response in most cases. I should note that after breaking up with me on New Year's despite, all right. That's how we ended it. I don't understand what's going on. And you guys sound like a bunch of cheap fucking assholes, green, honest with you. If you take somebody out for their fucking birthday, you make them pay for their birthday dinner. That's fucking terrible. It's so terrible. It's like, it's hilarious. And I'm sorry she didn't give a fuck about paying for gas. She's probably alluding to the fact. Did you, did you wait or pay for her own fucking birthday? That's fucking hilarious.

Speaker 2:          45:52          Okay.

Speaker 1:          45:53          Dan, in a lot of ways is Sanger did going out to dinner by yourself for your birthday, cause at least nobody there. It's a restaurant knows that your birthday now, you sitting there with a table full of people that know it's your birthday and now you got to kick in. Wow, man. Yeah. I should probably stop short of calling you and your whole family a bunch of cheap fucks. But let's just say you're a little rough around the edges. Uh,

Speaker 2:          46:17          okay.

Speaker 1:          46:17          But whatever. That's water under the bridge. I guess you need to find your soul mate. The kind of woman that doesn't mind paying for own birthday dinner. We don't, maybe you're a feminist, you know, cause most guys who we pay for our own shit on our birthdays, we have to go out and go buy the big fucking fancy gift on Valentine's Day. I Dunno, I can't figure that one out. And the fact that you stopped mid sentence, like she fucking showed up your place and club you to death and then hit send. So the forensics couldn't figure out what time you died. Well, he did send it email. Alright. Lesbian dating with no spark.

Speaker 1:          46:56          All right, well whatever the fuck you're dating, if there's no spark and out of it, uh, he built, I was wondering if you wouldn't, dia could give me some dating advice to a lady listener. Well, unfortunately he is not here, so you're going to have to deal with my dumb fucking ideas. Uh, I've been, I've got out odd seven really good dates with a wonderful woman who was essentially everything I've ever looked for in a partner. She's Hilarious, witty, playful, beautiful, smart and motivated and good, kindhearted person. Um, are you fucking my wife? Sorry. Uh, the way we have ridiculous, Witty Banter reminds me of how you are near or on the podcast. Well, that's what reminded me when you said it. Uh, it turns out we even want all the same things in life in terms of a long term relationship for how does this go left? Did you finally get her naked and she had a dick? I mean, what is, what is going on here? Uh, wanting a family, living close to parents and siblings in the same area we grew up. However, the past few days she's grown a little distant. Uh, Jesus.

Speaker 2:          48:02          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          48:02          When I asked her why, she explained that although she really enjoys spending time with me and that I've done nothing wrong, she's never felt strong, passionate feelings toward me. Uh, okay. This is how you got to walk somebody through their feelings. I'll go ahead. This is never fun. I responded honestly that I have not necessarily felt that huge passenger spark. Oh, wait a minute. I read it right.

Speaker 2:          48:29          Oh,

Speaker 1:          48:30          she said she never felt strong, passionate feelings toward me. Oh, I thought you meant she's never felt that before. And she was scared that she loves you. So she's saying like, you're cool but I'm not failing. I responded honestly that I have not necessarily Sara's Sara Lee felt that huge pastoring spark with her eating well congratulations. What you guys have on your hands is, is your your fuck buddies? Okay. And now when you're in an area of limbo and we don't really know where to go from here, I think it's clear that we are attracted to each other and very compatible, but there is a lack of clear chemistry between us. Uh, she has an a celebrated online class for the next two weeks. So we decided to cool things down and meet again after that is finished. I think that's very wise. My question is, if you consider an emotional, passionate drive necessarily necessary for two people to beat together successfully long term and how it was with you when Nia, I am personally a believer in longterm love growing over time and that put passionate love and my experience generally follows the Newtonian rule of what comes up must always come down.

Speaker 1:          49:50          Lovely wishes to you, Nia and the your little one and go fuck yourself. Um, I think that the fact that you guys both had that really mature conversation, neither one of you is feeling a spark. It's just like, you know, in the beginning, if there's the spark, there's that, that's that euphoria that you kind of chase for the rest of your relationship because you know, you just get used to each other. And then when the love comes out, it's usually if vacation holiday or if you've been through something together and you survived it, it brings you closer together. And then you have like these memories.

Speaker 2:          50:32          MMM.

Speaker 1:          50:35          You know, like I've gone through rough periods, you know, with my wife and like having a kid just upsets the whole apple cart. And, uh, you're focusing so much on the kid that you can kind of like forget to check in with each other and um,

Speaker 2:          50:52          okay.

Speaker 1:          50:53          You know, so what I've learned with her as we have to take like these little weekend vacations, you know, in town, just go to a hotel and it's hilarious. And then we are instantly fall back in love again. And then spent the rest of the time looking at pictures of our daughter, seeing how we miss her and stuff. So um, I dunno, I think because you guys have, you guys seem like you should be really good friends, but the weirdest thing is you already bagged or whatever. So I don't know how that works in the lesbian world, but I know in the a Hetero world that can get weird and it's kind of 50, 50, sometimes the guy gets weird, sometimes the woman gets weird. It's just kind of weird. So I dunno. I think it's probably a good thing that you guys aren't going to see each other for a couple of weeks and he can kind of be like, you know, cause it's early on. Just see where the fuck you are after two weeks. But, um, I dunno, I think you're doing it right. Like I don't want to think about that shit, you know,

Speaker 1:          51:58          which is why he probably asked me to chime in too. To be honest with you. The only way that it's going to fuck at work is a

Speaker 2:          52:10          yeah.

Speaker 1:          52:12          Is it, you do have that spark in the beginning because that sparks is what's gonna make you stay. Cause if you don't have that spark and he'd get married for the fucking reasons or whatever, that it's just like, you know, you see it, people marry for money and they're sitting on a fucking yacht and they're miserable. Uh, all right. Grown man's sitting while piercing. Oh Jesus Christ. It's one of the worst images I've ever heard. Dear old Billy blue hills. Um, I'm a 40 year old man with three young children. I realized the other day that over the past couple of years I've been sitting down when I piss more off the they're not all right now this is funny cause if you're doing it because you're tired, it's just fucking hilarious. I was worried that you were going to, this is going to be some other progressive thing that, you know, standing, Piss, privileged, whatever the fuck they going to come up with next.

Speaker 1:          53:04          Um, it all started when the kids were babies. My wife would wake up to feed and I would head down to the kid like a Zombie to piss and I was too damn tired. Just standard AME. Now the kids are a little older and I'm still fucking exhausted most of the time at home that I find myself sitting down to piss all the time. I think I'm just tired as fuck. Am I crazy to assume this is common among thing among men my age with young children now that you are 50, do you do the same? I can't be the only one. Right. Thanks. Love the podcast and go fuck yourself. No, I don't do that. The only time I ever do that is if,

Speaker 2:          53:40          okay.

Speaker 1:          53:41          My wife's sleeping and when we lived in smaller apartments, I didn't want to wake her up. When I was taking a piss out of consideration, I would sit down and that would always make me laugh. And I would always picture all of my friends making fun of me that I was sitting down. Well, well, uh, I think the fact that you still say pissing rather than paying, which is one of my major pet peeves, uh, I can meet with a guy says I have to go pee. It's just, I can't even tell you my body like microscopic leap, like could torts.

Speaker 2:          54:17          MMM.

Speaker 1:          54:19          Oh by the way, somebody told me it's anyway and not anyways. And I have to tell you, I don't give a shit. I like say it anyways. I say it in a plural sense.

Speaker 2:          54:30          MMM.

Speaker 1:          54:32          No, you probably not the only one who does it.

Speaker 2:          54:35          Uh,

Speaker 1:          54:37          but I will tell you that.

Speaker 2:          54:39          Okay.

Speaker 1:          54:40          What I have learned just having one kid is how important it is to get eight hours of really good sleep. And you should watch TV and be on your fucking phone. I've actually gone back to reading. If you consider reading sports books, reading, I try to read, but my wife, she always watches the fucking real housewives or that tattoo parlor show it, you know, any show that involves people. She doesn't care about screaming at each other for some reason. She loves to watch that before she goes to bed. Um, so I just put on these, the fucking same headphones I wear when I fly in a plane, so I can't hear people and I just read the fucking book.

Speaker 2:          55:21          Uh,

Speaker 1:          55:22          but anyways, I think maybe if you get eight hours sleep, you know, you hit the gym a little bit if you have time. But I, I know how tired I am with one kid. I can't imagine with like three at a good friend of my life told me one time when he was talking about being a parent. His kids are older, he's got like two or three kids and three kids and he said, uh, he goes, dude, he goes, I've been tired since the 90s. So I think that's just what it is.

Speaker 2:          55:55          Uh,

Speaker 1:          55:58          that's just what it is. And you know what it is. Cause once you kids get older and they can kind of take care of themselves, meaning they can wake up, brush their teeth, get ready for school at all, that you feel like you're not going to be tired. But I think the thing that makes you tired is the worry because you constantly fucking worried that something's going to happen to him. But whatever. Um, all right, that's the podcast. Apologize for the low volume of talking here. I really want to thank everybody that's come out to my shows here in Germany. I could not have had a better time. Uh, it was fucking awesome. And uh, I will definitely be back the next time. Hopefully when I get a new hour, you guys still want to come to see me? I will definitely be back. I think I'll come during the summer months, next time or October fest. One or the other. All right. Go fuck yourselves and I'll check in on you on Thursday.
