Speaker 1:          00:00:01       Hey, what's going on? Is Bill burn his time for the Thursday afternoon? Just before Friday. Monday morning podcast. Dan.

Speaker 2:          00:00:07       Ah,

Speaker 1:          00:00:11       just checking in on you. Ah, March 29th. Oh my God, this Bob this almost. Oh

Speaker 3:          00:00:20       Ma.

Speaker 1:          00:00:22       Did you have a good month? Well that's good. Um, I just have so much stuff to talk about. I don't even know where to begin. First of all, last night I watched the first hour and a half of that, the zen of Garry Shandling, the Judd Apatow documentary on the great genius Gary Shandling. And I'm, I got to tell you a jug. Did that Guy Proud? It's unbelievable. You have to see it. A comedian buddy of mine told me, he goes through it. Have you seen this thing yet? You got to see it. Thank God he told me about it and I went and I recorded this God damn thing, you know, and I'm telling you right now, you got to see him. All right. I told you last week you have to watch Barry. If you sat down and you watch berry storing Bill Hader, uh, Henry Winkler and all those guys, uh, you know, I was right. Okay. When are you going to learn to trust? When I tell you something on HBO is going to be good. Um, anyways, I was watching that documentary and [inaudible] I guess Gary Shandling just kept diaries his whole life. It was basically his entire life and he was writing all this stuff and overcoming fear and trying to get better as a comedian and a, it was like Erie watching, like how much I related to it because I never kept a diary. I tried one time, I was just too walled off emotionally. I remember I wrote like one line, my name's bill, I'm 28. I'm a standup comedian and that's as far as I can.

Speaker 3:          00:01:53       Got It.

Speaker 1:          00:01:58       And then I think I threw that book out so it's biodegrading somewhere because it's made out of paper. Um, but anyways, I used to always, why would write down on cocktail napkins.

Speaker 3:          00:02:11       Okay,

Speaker 1:          00:02:11       dad. Right. Commit to everything. Be Positive. I actually used that thing, you know, in the Catholic Church, I can't remember the part of the mass, what you do, the sign of the cross on your forehead, your mouth and then over your heart, which means you know God in your mind and your mouth and in your heart or something. So, but I used it as like a positive side rather than, you know, God's only son died on this thing that I'm now fucking drawing on my face. I actually, I use it as like a positive side, like no negative thoughts. Um, I don't know why I thought I'd put a positive side of what my mouth, so much of the Shit I say is fucking curmudgeony at best. But it was just more just committing to everything. And um, cause when we first moved down to New York, it was intimidating thing.

Speaker 1:          00:02:55       And uh, I get on my heels and then I wouldn't have a set, then I'd have to wait like another five, six days before I get stage time again. Just fucking hating myself for going up there and acted like a little. Um, although you're not supposed to say that now, right. That's not progressive, you know, why are you saying that you're acting like a little girl. Okay. Okay. I was acting like a, somebody who's gender neutral. Why can't you just say that she was scared without insulting the opposite sex? Well, I don't know. I guess, you know, I guess I think I said something I need to work on there. Are you happy? Yeah. Okay. Kay, can you shave your legs?

Speaker 1:          00:03:41       Um, AH, fuck. I had fun last night on stage, man. I went up when I was just, I'm sick a bunch of shit in my act and I was just like, I'm not talking about any of that shit. And I just meandered, meandered is the key word there. But I had a good time. I apologize to the crowd, but I, you know what units? It was a fucking Wednesday. All right. Is a workday. Um, but anyways, it's a wonderful week. It's a wonderful week in Los Angeles. Nothing's on fire. No one got me too, dude. Evidently they got all the crepes. Um, all right. Oh, I got to promote here. Par still rough and rowdy. If you've missed the last few podcasts, first of all, it's one of the great paper views you're ever going to watch. It's just regular people that enjoy fighting. They want to get on TV and they are willing to fight each other.

Speaker 1:          00:04:40       Okay. It's like, I don't know, I don't even know how to describe it. It's a, it's a juggernaut and it's like 15, 16 bucks and a, I'm going to be at the next one and I will be ringside announcing even though I, I bet I know what jab is. I know to hook his overhand right. I know what a straight right is to cause I watched the documentary, uh, leap Ba Yay. I watched that a long time ago. But other than than that, I'm just going to be making fun of Shit like I always do and hopefully one of those regular people won't try to beat the crap out of me afterwards. Um, I dunno. I'm so fucking excited for it. And uh, that's going to be on April 13th. Okay. You guys, I'm telling you, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm telling you. Got To fucking see you gotta see the Sh, you know, you don't have to, you know, if you want to miss out and then not know what anybody's talking about.

Speaker 1:          00:05:33       Come Monday when you standing around the fucking water cooler. Um, and uh, this is the last promo thing I have to do. Um, we've added some shows. If you want an updated list of the shows to see possibly come and see my ignorance live, uh, go to [inaudible] dot com. Dot Events for an updated list of shows. I hate to end promos in the beginning of the podcast because it just kills my fucking flow, you know, now I just feel like, and m, you know, like I'm sitting in a fucking waiting room. I don't feel funny anymore. I don't know who I am. Um, oh, here's one for you. The theme of this podcast, this half hour is late to the party. All right? And, um, which is really a theme to my life. Okay. I was late for everything. You know, I stayed back in first grade. Boom. Right there. I was just a year behind my whole fucking life. All right. I wasn't late getting my driver's license. I got that thing immediately. The day I was eligible. I did the old right there. Fred took it on a stick shift too. It's one of the main, that's probably the only manly thing I've ever done in my life.

Speaker 1:          00:06:52       I had no choice. That's all we had in our, in our family. We always had stick shifts. Um, cause they were fucking cheap. Um, so it was more fun. You felt you would drive in the fucking car instead of just getting it some go cart down though. I hate automatic transmission. You know, there's only a few left out there. I think the, uh, the Volkswagen Gti, there's one or two BMWs is probably a Porsche. That's something interesting. There is something that I could look up. How many standards? Standard dreads, mission cars left in pro duction. All right. The disappearing stick shift. Less than 3% of cars sold in the u s still have a stick shift. All right. 2017 cars that still offer a manual transmission. Let's see what we got here. Well, we have is slow Internet by the way. My buddy called me up and you know, I have a deli, miss this amazing Celtics road trip where they went for now coming in there, the walking wounded, everybody's out in, all the young kids is stepping up.

Speaker 1:          00:08:08       And last night they played the Utah Jazz and I guess, uh, was it Jaylen Brown? I'm a said Jalen rose hit a three pointed a when I heard Jason Tatum stepped up, uh, I'm just, I'm missing it. I'm missing, but I have to miss it. I got the kid, I got the kids. So I, uh, if you guys want to know what's going on with the new episodes of muppet babies, I'm on. I'm on that. All right. Gonzo Baby Gonzo had some little chicks and in the beginning of the episode, Foz Little Fozzie bear is, is doing is bad jokes. And he went to open his mouth and it sounded like a fart noise. And somebody goes, hey, you should say, excuse me. And I was like, Holy Shit. Is this going to be about passing gas and how you handle that in a public forum like this really progressive compared to the shit that I saw as a kid.

Speaker 1:          00:08:58       You know, it was just the alphabet. They didn't deal with bodily functions, but that wasn't the point. Fonzie goes, I didn't make that noise and they looked up when they saw that there was all these geese were flying south for the fucking winner. So then God's, Oh, got all fucking afraid. There's chickens. We're going to fly south in. Selfishly, even though chickens don't fly south south for the winter, they're doing it for survival. But selfishly Gonzo is so fucking needy. He tries to, you know, keep hiding the chicken so that the mother, it's weird. It's like they're all little fucking puppet animals and then there's like a real person that kind of takes care of them and bring some lunch and shit. It's like this sort of like, I don't know what's going on there. Some sort of muppet beastiality that this woman had. All of these kids, I have no idea of, you know, when evidently fucked a frog and a bear and all kinds of ship it, I don't know.

Speaker 1:          00:09:50       One of them is hers a pig. So anyways, I'll fucking episode this. God Damn, I don't know what he is. He's like a a vulture. Maybe I'm a two can, I don't know what he is. He's trying to hide these fucking chickens. And then the end, uh, the mom, you know, the, uh, the puppet groupie there, she comes out and she says like, listen, you'd get dumb little fuck chickens do not fly south for the winter. They're going to be in the coop. They going to be fine. And then Gonzo is all happy. And what upset me was that the chickens didn't get mad at him. In the end, they should have been like, wait a minute. So like for your own selfish needs, we would have fucking starved to death just because you're, you're, you're so fucking codependent. And then of course he would try to talk his way out of it being like, well I mean it doesn't really make a difference cause you don't fly south anyways.

Speaker 1:          00:10:48       If he says, yeah, yeah, but you didn't know that digit Gonzo, you didn't know that and you will fucking content. What the fuck are we going to stay outside in the fucking snow? You can't, you crooked beaked comment and then God's Ob like I always knew you thought I was less than other people. Right. And then he would make it about his fucking nose. See that's why he can't, you got to stay on topic because I just fucked up the argument for the chickens. Don't make fun of his beak. You keep it on, on, on topic. I should say. He keeps it on fucking topic about the fact that you're a codependent cycle and you had information that you knew that as far as you knew it was pertinent to my own fucking survival. And you kept that to yourself. Didn't you get a little cunt sell? That's the shit that I've been watching. Um, I know the [inaudible] they were doing well and what are, let's see, what have they been doing? They lost in a shootout to Columbus five, four. They lost it over time to one to St Louis to there's two points. We go, we beat Dallas is four points for that week. Four of a possible six. I'd say that's a good week. And then this week we beat Minnesota. And over time that's two points. Now we lost in a shootout to win a pig. Uh, so we've got three out of four points cruising along.

Speaker 3:          00:12:10       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:12:11       Now we've got a couple of home games against the Florida teach the Tampa Bay lightning and the new fucking, uh, broad street, the Southbridge speech bullies and the Florida panthers with the most fighting fucking major in the league. I mean, I think they, I think they're almost going to have 30 fights this year. I mean, those people are out of control.

Speaker 3:          00:12:34       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:12:35       That was fucking assholes. They all wrote it. They all ruined the Goddamn game. Those fucking constant watch. Olympic hockey, not even them. I can't even blame them. It's just people that aren't content with being millionaires. They want to be billionaires and now they have to fucking, let's just level it out. Let's mainstream it up. Let's alienate our core fucking fan base

Speaker 1:          00:12:58       and try to get all these fucking douchebags that watched the Kardashians to fucking watch rivalry, rivalry Wednesdays, which they're not going to do. All right. And the theme, this is good. Everyone. Did you guys write in and tell me how, uh, you know, let me, you're late to the party stories. I got married late. I had a kid late. I started standup late. I stayed back in school. I got laid lake. Yeah, I fucking, I'd go to summer school. I was just always, everybody everyday everybody was always like turning the corner. I was always like,

Speaker 4:          00:13:29       where'd for B?

Speaker 3:          00:13:32       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:13:34       I become progressive late.

Speaker 3:          00:13:37       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:13:37       My ideas of, of, of, of of everything else is like from fucking 20 years ago. So here's another thing that I am, I am 30 fucking years late. I am so late to the party on this band that they're actually doing their farewell tour and half the people aren't even in the band anymore. Two out of the fears, two original members. So yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:14:02       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:14:04       Doing the goddamn comedy jam and all of that and like trying to do, you know, pat terror and learn these, these double bass drum songs. Uh, now I, and then, uh, my Trump teacher, Dave took me to go see miss sugar. All of a sudden that whole world opened up to me. So now I'm backtracking to all of this shit that I vaguely remember my younger brothers, they were into it go and you got to hear this shit. And I was listening to a ribose has it stone

Speaker 4:          00:14:36       just like a,

Speaker 1:          00:14:39       Oh,

Speaker 3:          00:14:42       okay.

Speaker 4:          00:14:43       Just a cow. Oh,

Speaker 1:          00:14:46       you know, you're singing along. Six is say, say that's a good fucking song. I was listening to that shit. And uh, when Metallica and all these other bands came out, it was so fucking fast. I, I just, my ear couldn't catch up with it. And uh, now I'm going back 30 years fucking late. I, so guess what album I fight downloaded yesterday? Slayer south of heaven. I was watching, I don't know how, I just was watching blink trying to learn, you know, all this double bass shit and I was just on this youtube thing. And then eventually if you're going to do that shit eventually you're gonna to run into Dave Lombardo and slayer. So it was like, I got to fucking see that. I got why I watched this mini documentary. I guess it's a new documentary coming out on 'em. So I watched this older one from like 2004 and um, I've always tried to get into the band and it was just always, it was just, was beyond what my year is.

Speaker 1:          00:15:43       Understood. So I heard that song south, they haven't, and that's it. I'm done. So I love that album. And I guess that was an album they play, made a conscious effort to play little slower than they did on the previous album. That's the one that has like angel of death. And I listened to that one a little bit and I was like, the south, they haven't, I'm going to fucking, I got to, I can't go from like, you know, listening to poison and Bon Jovi and all the shit that I listened to two immediately going to that level of speed, you know, that's like, that's like when his sober person after 20 years decides to start partying again and they pick up where they left off, you're going to have a fucking heart attack. So I have to kind of ease my way into it and this fucking album, which I guess you know more on fans of musical, not fresh, it's not fast enough. Like saying like that doesn't even make sense. It's like, is it a good fucking song? So I have just been listening to south of Heaven and whatever the song is after it because they do that thing where it just sort of blends into it and a, it's fucking hilarious. I'm going to be 50 in June and I'm finally listening to slayer and up driving down the street, pulling up to red lights.

Speaker 1:          00:17:01       I got it. I fucking love it. So, uh, late to the party on that went 30 years late and I know I'm going to listen to this fucking album a million times and then I'm going to get a angel of death. And I remember a long time ago I had that, uh, I had the, the, the Iowa album. Uh, what's the name of the band there? Jesus Christ with Joey Jordan said, and all those guys. A seven Jake Day. Thanks five ball. The fuck is in now. Jesus Christ. Don't say that. I almost said no. They way they way the mass. They were the eyes. Watch. Ah, fuck it. What am asshole. You know what I mean? Listen, I know who the big four hours anthrax, anthrax, slayer, Megadeath. Metallica. I at least know that. Okay. I'm an I'm new to this. Please. Please be gentle when you trash me on social media for not knowing, uh, shit. Thrash. I wear masks. Let's see what this comes up with. Why can't I know the name of the drummer but not the name of the band? What the fuck does that say about me? Huh? Oh, speaking of which, I did the, I did the goddamn comedy jam. Um,

Speaker 1:          00:18:16       okay. So now they're showing me slipknot. Fuck. That's right. That's right. Okay. It's funny, the first thing he came up, why these 11 bands wear masks? I Dunno. Cause this smart, they want to have a life after the show's over.

Speaker 1:          00:18:37       Well that's the best thing ever. Like that bucket had it's fucking genius. He gets to fucking go around the world and guns and roses and all these awesome beds. And then the second he doesn't feel like being that guy anymore. He just takes the bucket off his head and the mass goes away. You know, probably puts it up in a man bun or something. Looks is [inaudible] God is possible. It just fucking walks away. Like what's his face at the end of the usual suspects, you know, straightens out his foot and just walks right through the crowd. No one has any fucking idea. Um, anyway, so I did the goddamn comedy jam. Uh, thanks to everybody. You know, I played the, uh, I played, uh, was it Pantera cowboys from Hell

Speaker 1:          00:19:27       and uh, I thought I had it down. I thought I knew what I was doing. I got out there, my Vinnie Paul Costume, I actually, I almost said Postmates did it. I fucking, uh, Instagram did, I grabbed it, Yolo, my young again, um, the costume that I wore and uh, that was probably the best part of the performance was the costumes. Look an asshole, you know Vince, you know he's a Husky fellow, right? So I had like a pillow or a throw pillow underneath this does fucking shirt and like a fucking asshole. When I sat down behind the drums, like I didn't take it off. I sat there, so it was like a had a kid or something sitting on my lap and this snare was a little lower than I was used to. So I fucking got through the song. I think I fucked up every single Phil and I got that in my already suck at drums.

Speaker 1:          00:20:23       Why would you add to difficulty with a pillow and your fucking chest and this thing up? You know why? Because it's the comedy camp, there has to be some sort of comedy. So I just love my double bass playing. It's the whole fucking thing sucks. So then the closer was, um, was a def Leppard pour some sugar on me, which was a song that I absolutely fucking, and not necessarily because it was a bad, it's a pop song for what it is. It's a great fucking song. But he is a reason why I hated it was because in 1988 my buddy got that fucking tape. Okay. And all he did was listen to that fucking song. Like why don't, can we listen to animal? Can listen to hysteria at no, no. He just kept fucking, I remember a time he didn't really know the lyrics, but anytime I would get to pour some sugar on me, he'd be like pumping his fist.

Speaker 1:          00:21:17       So was doing the song right and thank Christ we got out of the middle part where there's all that busy bass drum shit then, ah ha or that, oh shit. Right. We got to all of that, that whole breakdown thing. And then we're right in the end. And I go to hit the bass drum and no sound comes out of the bass drum. And I'm like, what the fuck? And I looked down and my bass drum Beta had fallen off right in the middle of the folk and song. So fortunately had the double pedal. So I just, I just played the, the left one for the rest of the song. Nobody really noticed, um, until they got to the end of the song. And I had to do all my, my songs, fillers and I had nothing. Oh, it's Paul Forsee. Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the podcast. Mr. Paul Versey.

Speaker 1:          00:22:07       Paul, can you hear me? Hey Dude, I'm doing, I'm doing my podcasts. Let me call you back. I'll be done in about 15. I see. Um, you know, so that, that all of that shit happened. So I had such fucking high hopes. I'm like, I'm going to fucking murder this song. And I did in a, in a bad way. I butchered it. Um, but my standup set, the thing that actually do for a living was actually really fun and it was fun to go out there. I wasn't really being Vinnie Paul, I was just acting, I was just speaking in a southern accent and I was talking positively about Ar fifteens which is such a fun thing to do, um, in Hollywood is to dress like a cowboy and then say why you love Ar 15. So I mean, why, why wouldn't a, why wouldn't you do that?

Speaker 1:          00:23:01       All right. So anyways, late to the party, got into parent terror, could have seen them live. My younger brothers were going to go see them. I was like, yeah, you know, and yeah, I think I'm okay. I think Mr Right. And I, I didn't go see them. Uh, you know, just, I don't know when the, when the fuck did the 1990 they came out, we're talking, okay, I'm literally 30. I'm 30 years behind. The fucking 30 is late. Wherever the party was. Like the fucking building doesn't even exist anymore. That's how fucking late am all right. Continuing continuing with the late to the party fucking theme here. All right. I finally watched the first moto GP race and Qatar. Is that how you say it? And I got to tell you something. Okay? For those of you not into with debt is a professional, uh, motorcycle racing at its highest level. It's the formula one of motorcycle racing. And I have to tell you something right now. I don't know why I have to tell you that. I'm going to tell you something. I should just fucking, you know, cause I watched friends, Mcdermott. Dharmic, right? I'm going to say something, right? I'm going to say something that fucking sport.

Speaker 5:          00:24:12       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:24:13       Completely fucking sold on it. I am a big fan of Andre de Vizios. So who drives to Ducati and Italian? Right? I just fucking, I like loved the way rides. I know Mark Marquez is like the fucking Derek Jeter or this sports. So whenever I get into a new sport, you know, it's like Lewis Hamilton. I'm not going to come. And do you know, Oh, this is my first year of watching Formula One, my favorite drivers, Lewis Hamilton. The guy will fuck it always wins. Um, so I can't be a mark. I like Mark Marcus. I'm going to say I'm not a fan, but it's just, I can't be like some bandwagon guys. So de Vizios so it was a guy watched last year. I was just like, I like this guy. He's always, you know, he's always up there and you know, on the podium or whatever, he's calming. I liked him and I liked a Yo hand Zarko I just liked his bike and he was always up there and he seemed like he didn't have as good a bike is other people and he was somehow fucking with those guys. So I watched the first.

Speaker 5:          00:25:09       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:25:11       I watched the first race and uh, I had missed all the qualifying and I see yo head Zarko has pole position. I was like, Holy Shit. Last year his whole story was like, this guy is like right there, but shit just kept happening. Um, and he didn't quite get over the hump and here is the first race of the year. That guy's got the pole position. So I watched the race. And by the way, if you think this is a big time commitment, it's like 22, 23 fucking lap. She can watch the whole race in 40 minutes. There's no pit stops. And by the way, it's people racing on motorcycles going over 200 miles an hour. Now they're going to say kilometers. So it's simple math. Every 80 kilometers is 50 miles an hour. Okay? So a lot of times they go and like, you know, 240 kilometers, that means they're going to about 150 miles an hour. And then on the straightaways, when they go by, all the fans to start finish line, they will get up over 300 320 when they get the 320 they go, they're going 200 fucking miles an hour

Speaker 1:          00:26:12       on a motorcycle and there's someone right on their ass and they have a big fucking turn that they have to slow down for. And the big fucking movies who has the balls to break last usually comes out of the turn the fastest. However, if you go wait, if you brake too fucking late, you might go to widen, the guy will cut under neath IA or you could go flying off your bike and die. All right. Now, if that's not enough excitement for you, that I don't know. I don't know what to tell you. So anyway, so I'm watching this race and your Zarko in the lead for the whole fucking race and, and they keep talking about his front tire because he's averaging like, I don't, I don't know what they're, his average was like one 50, 150 kilometers, uh, which would be what? Oh, Jesus.

Speaker 1:          00:26:57       Bill, that's like a little over a hundred miles an hour is what he was average. And that's, you know, with all the turns slowing down and all of that Shit, right? Um, I'm sitting there watching this fucking guy and I'm like, Holy Shit. Is this guy going to go wire to wire? And when, and they keep talking. This was something I need people who are into this, this, uh, into racing to explain to me, they just kept talking about your hands Arccos front tire and saying it's eventually it's going to wear down and he's going to have a fucking problem. And before it happened to him and happened to Valentino Rossi and all of a sudden, like he was in second place and all of a sudden on one lap he got, um, he got passed by like two people. But then it's like he made this adjustment, which is why he's evidently the one of the greats of all time. And he was able to come back and still make the podium and come in third place. But when it happened at Zarko, he just, he got passed by two people at the same fucking time. You went from first place the whole race down to not even being on the fucking podium. And then he ended up finishing eighth. And why doesn't he have the same fucking tires as the other guys?

Speaker 1:          00:28:03       How come? How come his tires are wearing down faster than other people? What the fuck does this Zarko guy have to do to get the best shit?

Speaker 6:          00:28:13       Yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:28:14       I know. I'm probably fucking this up. So anyways, a Da Vinci also, right? He was like in ninth place starting the race. So I was kind of keeping an eye on him, you know, like what's his face when I was watching the Formula One when uh, Valtteri Botox started way in the back because of the gear shift penalty, uh, changing out the gearbox fucking a penalty gear shift penalty, the gearbox penalty and um, I just watched him slowly moving his way up through the field and then the last two laps of the race. Okay. He's in first place. Mark Mark has is in second place and last year. This is like the Brady fucking Peyton manning. This is star back for stabler Elway verse Montana. This is just like, okay, this is Jordan verse Dominic Week Wilkins Dunkin Content, one of the great chaebol in First Russell, whatever the fuck you want to call it.

Speaker 1:          00:29:08       And these guys were fucking riding like maniacs for the last two laps. Marquez is right on Davinci. Oh, so his ass and he just knew it wasn't easy going to pass him. It's when is he going to pass him? Because he did this all fucking last year and it drove me nuts, which is why I became a de bitsy also fan. You gotta gotta root for the underdog, right? So there's like fucking two or three corners left and they're like, I don't think mark has his close enough. And all of a sudden he braked later than Divisio so, and he was right on his ass and the next fucking corner he fucking goes underneath divisio. So in past them, and I didn't even realize I was that into it, I was in the living room and I would just went like, Nah, my wife comes running it.

Speaker 1:          00:29:57       What's the matter? She thought there was something wrong with that kid. So he does, he goes dives underneath the vizios. So at this point, you know they're going like 90 fucking miles an hour in a turn with their knee, like a, like an eighth of an inch off the fucking ground. And he ducks underneath them. But he was going so fast, he went a little wide and then divisio so went underneath him and then it was just a fucking flat out race on a straightaway. Just pinning it all the way to the fucking finish line into vizios. So wins it. It was just an, it's everything that's missing in Formula One as far as like, I love Formula One, I'm going to continue to watch it, but I just fucking hate water. It's, it's just a race to the first corner and whoever's in the first corner is going to be driving and clean air and everything.

Speaker 1:          00:30:46       Everybody is so equally matched. No one's going to be able to pass him and then you just have to wait for someone to fuck up in the pits. Like that's the exciting passing. It's just like in this guy, get out of the pits before that second place guy comes around again. Um, I dunno, but if you're, if you're missing passing and Formula One, uh, I would suggest jumping sports. You can watch him both. I mean it's, they, it's not that much that you're committing to 40 races a year. On a 365 days. I mean, he can take them, you can watch them whenever you want to. So, uh, I am 100% sold on this fucking sport and I've actually going to be taking a vacation coming up when I'm celebrating my 50th birthday and I just realized I'm going to be in the vicinity of that race and Spain and I'm trying to talk my wife into going with me.

Speaker 1:          00:31:41       That's my, uh, and I'll just be like, come on honey. It's my 50th birthday and she's such a sweetheart. I think she's going to do it. By the way, a honorary mentioned to a cow crutch low, uh, coming in fourth place and riding a great race and having one of the great fucking names of all time, cal crutch Lowe is such a fucking cool name. It doesn't even sound like, it sounds like an alias. Like if I was a cop, I wouldn't believe him if I cut some underage drinking. All right, give me an age. Which name? Uh, count crutch low. All right. Get up against the wall. He'd go downtown. I swear to God it's my real name. Um, anyways, all I got to go a little read here. I got to do little re, I get the little read here. Uh, and then get off my fucking day cause I got another show.

Speaker 1:          00:32:29       I'm coming up where I'm going to be playing drums. I've got to make sure I tighten down the fucking bass drum beater before I play. I'm doin a Dean del Rey's. It's is uh, what was it, 52nd birthday. And uh, I played drums on his 50th birthday is great. He has a whole standup show and then after that he came out for his 50th birthday with a live band. He sang the entire AC DC highway to hell album. So for his 52nd, he's going to be singing the, uh, the entire, uh, power age album. So I'm playing a couple of songs off of that, so I got to make sure I have that shit down. And I'm also gonna make sure that the bass drum beater is fucking tightened out. Um, but whatever. And once again, trying to learn those songs that I've been learning I and really be able to play him a whole new, already had a love, uh, Phil Rudd.

Speaker 1:          00:40:50       I am so sick of being, I feel like I'm that podcast that like advertisers go to right before they meet their soul mate podcast. You know what I mean? You know that chick who's always the fucking bridesmaid, never a bride. That's what I'm starting to feel. I just don't feel that people understand what the fuck it is. A just cause I joked doesn't mean people take it seriously in the God damn copy. It makes them listen to it rather than fast forward to it. It's so fucking simple. Why can't you Madison Avenue conch figured that out.

Speaker 11:         00:41:19       Maybe they're going to be advertising my podcast next week. I probably should check with my producer before I say that. But you know what even did all right. That's it. Okay. Here's a little bit of music and then um, I don't know. I guess the fucking we'll play in some half hour greatest hits. You know what? I'm actually, I'm going to tell my guy to fucking put a slayer south. They haven't. Alright, go fuck yourselves

Speaker 5:          00:41:50       Monday.

Speaker 1:          00:42:40       Have you guys seen this youtube video? My name is John Dacre. You got to watch this thing. I apologize cause it's going to be in your fucking head for the rest of the time he's singing. He's singing a moray and he can't remember how to

Speaker 6:          00:43:02       more rare.

Speaker 1:          00:43:11       They can't stop watching this guy, this guy, I swear to God, I think it's his first TV Gig. Somebody was sick, I think they said at the beginning. So this guy fills in and if you look at him, he's literally having an out of body experience. So it's so funny to me because I can relate to this person because the first time I did stand up I felt like I was watching myself. I've fucked everything up and this guy, just the way he says his name, it's almost the just, he says like, my name is John [inaudible].

Speaker 9:          00:43:44       Okay.

Speaker 3:          00:43:45       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:43:47       It's like, it's like he was outside, so I think that might be my favorite part of the video is the one this fucking guy. Just the way he says his own name. He didn't say, my name is John [inaudible]. He goes, my name is John Dacre. I did it right the first time I, and I just fucked it up. Hey, you got to hear this. You got this fucking guy. He says he's singing all these Jesus songs. Hang on. Hang on.

Speaker 3:          00:44:18       My name is John Dick, or

Speaker 1:          00:44:27       my name's John Take. It's like he's watching life, like he already died and then he came back and he just got to,

Speaker 9:          00:44:38       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:44:38       Like he, first time we ever realize my name. My name is John Taker. That's my fucking name. And this is my life and I'm on TV and I'm going to sing this song.

Speaker 9:          00:44:48       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:44:48       This is what I did with my life. And as you look at the guy fucking poor bastard, oh my God, listen to them sing. Hallelujah. Oh Damn. But for the grace of God, this fucking guy would be the most interesting interview ever. Just like,

Speaker 9:          00:45:26       yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:45:26       he's one of the most fascinating people I've ever seen. Like what the, what is going on in between those fucking ears right now? I think if they could, if you could make a show about his fucking thoughts, you know all these fucking movies. Oh, it's, yeah. You know, they show the movie, but it's done in reverse. And then they tried to fucking flip you out. Nothing. Not that pink Floyd could ever fucking right can match what's going on in this guy's head. Highly recommended. All right. Yeah.

Speaker 5:          00:46:29       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:46:33       What's going on? It's built and is this the Monday morning podcast from Monday, March 29th, 2010 72 degrees out. Her little sort of jealous.

Speaker 10:         00:46:43       How the hell are you? How's it going? I know I've been getting a ton of emails do it. It's still not up on iTunes. I don't know what's going on. All right. All I know is I just keep recording these fucking things. Having faith that we'll finally get these fucking things up there. I know we're going to, and I'm going to go out on a limb and say this is definitely the week everything's going to be up there, but until then I'm going to whore myself out and tell you that the Monday morning podcast starring me, myself and I is only a exclusively on billboard.com that's the only place she can get it. See what I did. I'm like a drug dealer. I gave you a couple of free samples. Actually I didn't. I gave it two and a half fucking years of free samples and then I fucking pulled it.

Speaker 10:         00:47:26       Oh, you guys are all feed in for it and I'm going to get you to my fucking website, right. I'll get a bunch of hits on my website, then I'll start selling advertising for like tampons or something and I'll make a fortune. Get a midget in a hawker. Hang on. I have to sneeze. Where's The sun? Where's this something? Come on, give me some sun. There it is. There it is. Nothing. I hate that. When you feel it, it's like fucking blue balls for, you know, so I thought it was gonna fucking sneezer nothing. All right. Anyways, it's Monday, March 29th. I have not watched one 2nd of March madness and is always, it's the best fucking sporting event of the year. And I don't know what happened. I was over in a fro and uh, I was over in Europe, so, uh, you know, I wasn't there at the beginning, so I missed the whole thing. I watched Kentucky lose yesterday and I can admit I can't really look at John Calipari the way I used to have to, what's his face verbally bitch slapped him. Um, that angry white haired guy from Indiana who then went to Texas and now he just talks about games. The fuck's his name. I actually went to a game when I was out there when he was still locked down. What the fuck is his name? I keep thinking white to his hair.

Speaker 10:         00:48:35       Jesus Christ. He's one of the great coaches of all time. Come on bill. You've been going to lumosity.com.

Speaker 3:          00:48:41       Okay.

Speaker 10:         00:48:42       Focus. Let it go. Just don't care about it. I don't give a fuck now I care. My brain can tell. I care. So it's just hiding it. Just mocking me. Come on work.

Speaker 10:         00:48:52       Bobby Knight. There we go. I to think of him throwing the chair. Uh, yeah, he called you give key, actually called John Calipari out on some kind of decent, he said, you know, every fucking program that this guy has been a part of, has had some sort of problem with the NCAA and then he jets out of town, you know, continuing to build his resume. And he really trashed him. Now I'm not saying what he said was right, but Calipari all he came back with was a respect glovie night. I think he's a great coach. And he didn't that you didn't address anything. You know, somebody told me I killed a hooker and they were a friend of mine and I respected them. I would address the killing of the hooker at some point. Uh, in my innocence of it

Speaker 10:         00:49:37       before I, you know, after, you know, after I said how much I respected the guy. Right. You know, I went to a game one time out there in Indiana with Bobby Knight was still there and he was, you know, Indiana started to lose. It was a year. Michigan State won the championship. I think it was the year 2000 already 10 years ago. And I went to this fucking game and I remember I bought a student ticket and, uh, you know, showed up at that point I was well into my thirties. And the guy's looking at me like, really? You know, what do you want the fucking 12 year plan? That's when he got to come with the fucking Luther vibe from a 48 hour. I've been busy, none of that shit. When he pulls up to the toll booth of the parking garage thing, and the guy's like this tickets like four years old.

Speaker 10:         00:50:22       Yeah, I big busy. That was the vibe. Me, I just gave the guy that's like, come on man. Come on. Really? It's me. So he let me in and I went in there and I remember, uh, watching Bobby Knight and it was a fucking great arena. And there he was, the legend, right? I was up in the nosebleeds, but, uh, Indiana started losing and he started, he walked out on the court and was yelling at the, the point guard, bringing it up to court. Like his, his whole fucking head was just, you know, with just with every fucking mother fucking like is like a, like a rooster with Tourette's. Right. Just, just fucking unbelievable. And I remember I got so Goddamn mad watching him do that. I was just, I was, I wanted that kid just to take the ball and just fire it right into his fucking screaming face. Five, I have a son and he allows himself to get fucking yelled at like that. You know what I mean? You fucking retard control. You've got damn emotions. All right. You want to fucking blow up a little bit. Blow up. But this guy had completely lost his shit.

Speaker 10:         00:51:33       Yeah. Do you ever see Marvin Hagler when he fought Tommy Hearns, remember when he was punching him in the head and Tommy's fucking head would go back and his Jheri curl all the shit from it would fly out. Instead, he was doing that with his head to himself, except instead of going back, he was going forward every time he was making a point to this kid. It was like Ben Kingsley and sexy beast make me look like a right cunt. You're fucker Darren to fucking, ah, he's leading with this head fucking right cross white to is fucking, I fucking hate people like that. Remind me of one of my relatives. Um, well I just really revisited that anger, didn't I? Um, so anyways, I was actually going to do this podcast last night at, uh, at, at 12 midnight now that I've been over to Europe and I found out how many people listen to my podcast over there.

Speaker 10:         00:52:25       And you know what? I'm starting to have a little, uh, you know, responsibility for those people. Like, you know, I now know that England and Ireland are seven hours ahead of me. So if I did it at midnight Monday nights, if I posted it then, I mean, Sunday nights, you know, they're rolling into work a couple hours later, you know, and I know what you're thinking down there in Australia. Ooh, what about us? We're fucking 14 hours ahead. Go fuck yourselves. All right, the fuck. Do you want me to do it on Thursdays every week? You know, why don't you be happy? Why don't you guys just focus on the fact that you guys don't get respect for living on the largest island in the fucking world. You know, Disney's should've made a cartoon about you guys, Not Madagascar, Huh? What was that about? So sick of those fucking cartoons about animals that know about global warming and then they teach human beings a lesson. You know, do you realize that like 98% and I just grabbed that stat right out of my reach right in and pulled it out. 98% of fucking animals, including the goddamn insects. There's an insect, an animal. I know what ain't human. Um, 98% of those mother fuckers are murderers

Speaker 10:         00:53:38       every day, every fucking day. When they want to go out and get something to eat, they have to commit a murder. You know, they got to set a trap. They got to ambush. They never do with fucking face to face. You ever seen a fucking animal,

Speaker 10:         00:53:55       you know, be a gentlemen, come up and slap another fucking beast with his glove and say, I challenge you. I challenge you. To a meal off. I want to eat, you know, these pieces. Shit. Fucking animals. What about me? I don't kill anybody. I go and eat an animal that's already been murdered. I am accomplice to murder. That's what the fuck I am. Um, I did I get on that subject. What was I talking about? It's talking about Bobby Knight. Oh, some of those stupid fucking animal movies at Disney's always making, trying to make me cry. You know, as they have some polar bears slide known as belly into a coke can, the same fucking thing that would just be eating me alive. Um, if you had to get mauled by an animal, if you had to get eaten by an animal, which one would you pick? I picked the biggest fucker ever. I want that shit to be over. Cause I remember when that gay dude with the Evil Knievel onesy the Joan Jett fucking leotard. Remember those two guys out there? Six Free Android. Roid, Siegfried and Roy.

Speaker 10:         00:55:05       Siegfried and Roy. Remember those two twinkle toes out there, dance around with all those fucking, you know, whatever they had. They, they're cats. They were doing cats the musical for real. What if we, you thrill cats? I think he's spectacular. We just skip around and I'll bleach my hair. And then you put shoe fallacy in yours. Yeah. Will Rub it's pools. Um, actually that's bullshit because the musical cats came out after fucking, uh, the, the, the fucking, those two guys. Gay, evil Knievel and uh, and gay. Uh, what was the other one? What did he look like? A, who's the other guy at night at the Roxbury? Not will Pharrel. Oh, Jesus. My memory is just shot Catan. That's what it looks like. If they ever, if they ever make the movie of that, I would cast a Catan Kriska Tan as the one who gets his neck chopped and then I would have to go with the guy who played Bo Duke and the rob. Uh, Nah, he's too fucking all at this point. Who's got hair like that? God knows I don't, even if you're fucking bleached it, I don't get enough left. Hang on a second. Who the fuck would I pick?

Speaker 9:          00:56:26       Okay,

Speaker 10:         00:56:26       well, whatever there, there's your project for the week. But anyways, my point is when he grabbed the, the, the gay Chris Catan, dude, it was just over. It wasn't like, Oh my God, I'm getting new. Buy An island, an island, a fucking lion. Jesus. It wasn't that. It was just crapped his fucking throat. And that was, if he went to chomp and that was it. That was it. It was fucking off. I know, Bill, we saw it. We saw it on fucking Hollywood. Aina aided a bitch or whatever the fuck that, that's stupid. He Hollywood bowl shows he Hollywood fucking stories about celebrities and addition all this dirt about them. Did you ever notice that none of their close friends are on it? It's because it's all bullshit. You know, they do like the willy aims story and they have like his fucking made talking all sorts of shit about him. There's grant. Good Eve say anything? No. Does the kid who played Nicholas Bradford, does he say some shit? No. None of them say anything. It's always like, you know, some fucking PA.

Speaker 10:         00:57:34       I don't know what the fuck I'm talking. I was talking about animals. Let's rewind this for a second. Yeah, those stupid fucking, Oh, if you've got to get killed by an animal. That's what I'm saying. I want, I want to get fucking killed by something like that. A big cat or a bear. You know there's something about an alligator though. I just, I don't like it. I don't like that they have fucking them. They're mean about it. You know, they just did, they grab your leg and then they do that fucking barrel roll. You know, it's like, can't you just fucking shot my leg off? Can't you just, just nice clean Ginsu it and you know, it was a major writer. We there, I'll fucking bleed out in like five seconds. Do you really got out Joe Theismann me to the 10th power. You guys ever seen that clip?

Speaker 10:         00:58:16       Non Sports fans. If you want to see something that'll just make you lose your lunch for all you broads out there trying to lose some weight. If you just had a piece of cake right now, go on youtube and look up Joe Theismann breaks leg or Joe Theismann, uh, who landed on him. Lawrence Taylor. Remember that Shit. It's, it's a, it's a two for one break. Compound fracture I believe is what is what is called the Tibia and the fibula. Uh, yeah, I think that's what it is. Look at me full of fucking pulling another thing. I'd have my age. Um, all right, so this is the deal. It's Monday morning out here in Los Angeles. She probably wondering, hey bill, you know what, what does that, what does a struggling actor, moderately successful comedian do on a Monday morning? Well, I'll tell you right now. I had a fucking audition and I, I prepared my little actor hard out for it and uh, it was one of the roles I've always wanted to play.

Speaker 10:         00:59:16       All right. Um, there's a few scenes that I want that I want to do as an actor. A lot of actors want to win an Oscar. Of course I do. But who's kidding? No. You know, one of my Jane Staple Horn said somebody's name. I don't know. Fuck, that is a triple horn. I don't know what the fuck I'm trying to say here. Look who's getting to, it would be 42 years old in June. Okay. If I can just stand near somebody who won a fucking Oscar, I'm going to be happy. All right? So anyways, um, um, and you know what I'm doing? I'm, I'm adjusting my dream. Okay? Rather than going on Oprah now and having her ask me how I became so fucking brilliant. Now all I want to do, I want to have that scene. I want to play a snitch. That's what I want to do.

Speaker 10:         00:59:58       And I want to have somebody chase me down a fucking alley. I don't give a fuck if it's the cops are the guys I snitched on and I want to come to the end of the alley. I want that chain link fence. You know, you grab it, you're trying to climb up it and you think you're gonna to make it and then they grab you by your cheap leather coat. They pull you off it and kicked the shit out of you. I want that. I want to do the interrogation scene. You know, when I'm sitting there, then they're doing the good cop, bad cop. I've already been the cop. I did that on Chappelle show. I want to be the guy getting interrogated. And then the last thing is I want to get my fucking head blown off in a movie. So today and I have the perfect head, my big fucking kitchen TV set head, my Sean Penn forehead.

Speaker 10:         01:00:43       I mean this, it's just begging to be fucking blown off in a movie. I'm dying for that scene, right? And I had an audition today to, uh, to play a guy who gets fucking shot in the head. In the end. I was psyched. I was feeling good. I worked a whole fucking thing out, right? So I go down to the audition and I show up, I'm at the address and I'm looking at somebody's house. I'm like, what the fuck? This is somebody God damn house. This doesn't seem right. So I rechecked the address and then I saw a couple of people walking in holding this sides. Um, so I was like, all right, fuck it. Not Sides. For those of you not in the business, they didn't walk in with like mashed potatoes and stuffing. It's fucking sides of basically the part of the script.

Speaker 10:         01:01:25       The couple of scenes that they give you. Um, so I go walking in there and I walk in and all I see is two Asian guys in suits. And I'm like, all right, this is weird because basically what happens when you, when you audition for a role, they kind of know what they want. Every once in a while they do that all ethnicities. But basically I walk in there and there's a bunch of howdy duty looking guys. You know, Donny, most is in there. Fucking resent me, you know, cause my red hair hasn't turned yellow yet.

Speaker 10:         01:01:59       Now it's not all redheads, which, you know, it's a bunch of fucking white dudes about my age, you know. And um, this time I'll walk in, it's two Asian dudes, one with the shaved head and one with fucking Chow, young fat hair. And they're both sitting there. I'm like, what the fuck? I must be coming in at the tail end of, we're trying to find the Asian dude. And I walk in and I sign in and as right as I sign in to say I'm there, the casting person came. I was like, Oh my God, I tried to call and I was like, oh fuck. I tried to cut shiny email. Basically they, they, I dunno, I dunno if they'd cast it. They gave it to somebody famous or what? But they basically tried to call me to say that, uh, they were rewriting the role.

Speaker 10:         01:02:45       I love when somebody says that I tried to call really what happened. I, I dunno, I, I dialed it, but I couldn't pick up the, I tried, I couldn't just be honest. It was a late night fucking decision, you know, and I had, I was one of the first guys coming out of the shoots. No big deal. Whatever. I'm already showered, looking good today. It was still would been sleeping like a bump. So, uh, yeah, my day started a little fucked up. When are you going to do whatever, whatever. I'm 16, 17 minutes into this podcast, I got a little bowl of grapes here. Um, and people, let me tell you something. I am severely, severely off the wagon. All right. I stumbled in last night and, uh, all I had was two beers. I don't know what the fuck happened. I was like stumbling and I, you know, got out of my car, which I probably shouldn't have been driving.

Speaker 10:         01:03:40       I two beers in an hour and a half. So I mean I think I'm not drunk. Right? Your body gets rid of a one drink an hour. Isn't that what it is? All I know is I have this fucking little zip up, right? My little fucking, uh, you know, I don't know what it is. It's like a fun, I think it has the English flag on it and it's white. It's weird. It looks like really American because it's red, white and blue. It's a fucking cool look and zip up. It makes me look maybe two and a half years younger than I am and I'm vain. So I wear it. So I stumble out of my car and I brush up against the hinge of the garage and I have, and then I was like, fuck. And I looked down and I have this Greece, at least it was brand new, so it was kind of green looking and I ruined it.

Speaker 10:         01:04:21       And I just sat there and I remembered what this recovered alcoholic told me when I wasn't drinking. I was like, Yeah Dude, I'm done with drinking. And he looked at me and he said, yeah man. He goes, nothing good comes from it. And I was like, once again, this guy's right when you're younger, good stuff comes from it. You get laid, you get charged with date rape later, but you know in the moment it's good. Um, no. You know what I mean? Loosens people up. You don't know how to talk to a luck. Be a lady two nights. Let me get you drunk and less uptight. Gonna stick my finger in your fucking who? Hoss, Sweetie. What are you want it or not? Not doing it. I don't, I'm not advocating rape here. I just felt like singing. So let me have a grape. Maybe that'll take me down here.

Speaker 10:         01:05:07       Oh God, isn't that delicious? It was the last time you bought some grapes and actually finished them. You know, I'm actually trying to, cause I, when I came back from Europe, I throw out a hellacious amount of food. How much do you think? A starving kid ways, because when I walked out, I felt like I had like six of them in my garbage bag. That's how much food I threw out. Some of them would jars, you know, wasn't all food. Some of it was the containers. But you know, a lot of it's made out of cardboard at this point. I throw out a lot of food. That's what I'm trying to tell you. So I'm really, I'm try, I bought some food this week and I'm trying to eat all of it up. I'm trying to be a less wasteful American. I was speaking to that Shit fucked.

Speaker 10:         01:05:54       And I look up, I was on youtube the other day and they had these German motherfuckers and they would, they would, they were trying out the new um, um, dodge challenger, the fucking XJS that's a Jaguar, whatever the fuck you call it. The, the Hemi one versus the Shelby Mustang versus Dodge Viper. And their whole thing was they just kept relating the cars to eating fast food in a big cheeseburger. They will basically saying, these are American cars, Americans are fat fucks. And, uh, I got to admit, man, we earned it. We did earn it. But you know, we don't do, we don't test out a Porsche and Audi and a BMW with some sort of Nazi theme underneath it. You know, I'm fucking really getting tired of this man. Everybody's taken shots at the good old USA. So you know, you got to do, I've got a new segment called let's get smart America.

Speaker 10:         01:06:55       I wish it had some sort of production on this where I could just have a fucking silly ass song. What are you going to do this week as it a fucking American to make yourself a little less fat, a little less dumb, a little less something else. Cause the magic number is three. Say I'm too fucking stupid to come up with three examples. What are you going to do? I got to tell you, these motherfuckers over in England, man, are not in good shape and they weren't in good shape and fucking in, uh, Scotland either. Ireland, they were all right. You know, it's like they're not fat, but they just like, they look like out of shape. Seventh graders, like there's not a lot of weightlifting over there. Like I just saw arms. You don't like straight arms like Dilbert. I'm not saying they're all like that. So fucking old gets your blood up over there. Right. You know what I'm saying? Put it this way. My girlfriend saw somebody over and um, in, uh, we were the fuck where I think we were in Scotland and she saw somebody and this kid looked like he was in his early twenties, his face. But his body was just, she just looked at me and she just goes, his body is unacceptable.

Speaker 10:         01:08:08       And it wasn't even that he was fucking ridiculously honest shape. It's just that not only those fucking guys over mushy, they were the tightest fucking shirts ever. I'm not saying I'm in shape. I got a nice little fucking pooch going right now that I need to try to work down. But I have the decency, the common fucking decency for my fellow man to wear a button down. You know, give yourself a little space, let it hang off your man tits a little bit so we don't have to see, you know, these fucking guys over in Europe, it's like they want you to know exactly how many pounds overweight they were. It was disgusting. You know, and appreciate it. A little courtesy out of my fellow man. That's all I'm saying. Okay, you got you gotta be honest with yourself. All right.

Speaker 10:         01:08:53       What kind of shape? My mind wife beater shape am I and t shirt shape? Am I in fucking buttoned down shape? Do I need to put on a Hoodie? You know, sport coach shape. Remember that Shit. I used to have a regular job. Why am I walking around? I think I'm excited. This is one of the exciting moments of the podcast for me. Look at me pacing back and forth as if I'm fucking coming up with some brilliant shit here. I remember when I had a regular job, he used to work in a warehouse unloading trucks. You know, it's not curing cancer, but it served a purpose and a, I remember once a year they would have, they'd have the company cookout and all these fucking suits that you thought were in shape, dude, they would show up with their fucking tee shirts on. Wow.

Speaker 3:          01:09:40       Wow. You know,

Speaker 10:         01:09:43       I'm talking like a fucking big slice of cake just hanging off each side of him. I remember it made me feel good too because they will make him more money than me.

Speaker 3:          01:09:51       You know?

Speaker 10:         01:09:53       And when you do that, you just fucking good your wedding in that category. So I'm glad that you're losing in this one. Did that go anywhere? However another grape. God Damn it. These things are tart. So here we go. I'm trying to become a better speller, everybody, and I'm sick of being a fucking moron in that category. So I figured I'd give you a spelling tests this week. All right? You don't have to play along. You know, what am I going to tell him? He can keep fucking rambling for another 40 minutes. You can tell at this point, I don't have shit to talk about this week. I just emptied my brain on Thursday. It takes a week for it to fill up. It's like a just jerked off and you want another load. I don't have one inmate got a fucking empty chamber this week. All right, you guys sitting at your desk, this would be even better.

Speaker 10:         01:10:43       This, you know what's great about this, if I actually add this to the podcast, right? Teach it fucking 10 words every week, okay? We all learn together. This is the great thing, cause if you're listening to it at work, you shouldn't be doing that. You know it and I know it looked down at in shame right now at your desk. Now don't fuck that. He shouldn't have any shame. Did you dream about your job then? There's no fucking shamed fucking off. Um, the great part about this part of the podcast is you're actually going to start writing and people going to be thinking, Oh wow, okay. Sandy's over there taking notes on something important. You know, who fucks off and writes at the same time. Um, all right, so here we go. Here's 10 words that I think, uh, I don't think anything about them. These are just words I fucking found that I could, I couldn't spell.

Speaker 10:         01:11:32       Catalysts is the first word. What it is. Yelled at into the Mike Catalyst is your first word. All right, let's see how fucking dumb you are. We need, we need to gauge how fucking stupid you are to have a jumping off point. All right. Catalyst is your first word. Can you use it in a sentence? Uh, I don't think I can. Um, this spelling test was the catalyst to expose how fucking stupid I am. Catalyst is a fucked up one. We all eat them. Cantaloupe. A, what'd you look at that fucking cantaloupe? I, you know, I just realized I could never do this. I could never be a teacher. Chloroform,

Speaker 9:          01:12:23       okay.

Speaker 10:         01:12:23       Hey, you know what? If you don't shut the fuck up, I'm going to take a chloroform reg and uh, put it over your face there. Chloroform. God, this is like designed to make you smarter and it's really exposing how dumb I am is a tough one. A penitentiary.

Speaker 10:         01:12:40       Don't go to the penitentiary. You might get fucked in the ass penitentiary. Uh, you know I love about this podcast is, even though I have no idea whether this is the, you know, I, there's no way to hear feedback or anything. I know this is bombing and I don't give a shit. I don't know. You know what? I don't even know how many I've done. I'm going to fucking do all ten one, two, three. I did three, three c words and I'm not, I would say cunt, but it's too easy. Uh, let's go with another one was another one. Aesthetics. There's a great one. Here's a great one. Aesthetics. Using a sentence. Bill, come on. You dummy. Jesus Christ. Look at these aesthetics. And you know, it's funny, I know how to spell all these words now, but I, I can't use them in a sentence. It's just really a fucking moron. All right, let's go. Infrastructure.

Speaker 9:          01:13:40       Okay.

Speaker 10:         01:13:40       You know, I'm sick of this infrastructure. It's really, uh, it's really unnecessary infrastructure. Now I can use that in a sentence. The infrastructure of the company was a exquisite, Oh, Jesus Christ. Geez. Oh Gee, what else we got? How many, how many words is that? One, two, three. That's four.

Speaker 9:          01:14:07       Okay.

Speaker 10:         01:14:07       There is a tough one. Succinct. Think I did that last succinct. What? Somebody who stutters brushes his teeth in a succinct, can I just do five? Can I bail on this? Are you guys enjoying how fucking horrific, this is a pertinent, what does that six, I want to say that six part in it. Um, you know what, if this is pertinent information, that's the only time anybody ever uses that word is when they're describing information.

Speaker 9:          01:14:47       Okay?

Speaker 10:         01:14:48       If I had access to the pertinent, pertinent information, I wouldn't have to deal with this infrastructure at this cantaloupe colored company.

Speaker 9:          01:15:00       Okay?

Speaker 10:         01:15:04       Pardon it. Fuck you. You don't even know how to spell it. You can't smell it. Spell it. You can't fucking be laughing at me right now.

Speaker 9:          01:15:11       Okay.

Speaker 10:         01:15:11       All right. Here's a fun. The, Oh, these ones are all the ones that have psycho at the beginning of him. Uh, here's one. Uh, negotiate. You know, you guys want more money in your cubicles. You're going to have to negotiate. Oh, negotiate was that age. I'm even getting bored with this. Uh, this is a hell of a dilemma. Huh? Go ahead. Spell that one dilemma.

Speaker 9:          01:15:40       Okay.

Speaker 10:         01:15:41       I didn't realize this was going to bomb bomb and now I'm in a fucking dilemma.

Speaker 9:          01:15:46       Okay.

Speaker 10:         01:15:46       Dilemma. And what's the last one here? A silhouette.

Speaker 9:          01:15:53       Yeah.

Speaker 10:         01:15:53       Hey, when I see you silhouette up against the mood, it makes me want to fucking baggy silhouette. Ah, all right. There you go. Let's just spelling tests for the week. Do you have any desire to get better at to shit. Am I super imposing? That's what I do. I can spell all those fucking words. Huh? Are you impressed? You shouldn't be. Um, here's another new segment bills, embarrassing moments from the previous week's podcast. This is actually from two weeks ago. I actually re listened to these when I, uh, when I upload them, it takes a moment for me to upload all of these fucking things that no one can hear unless you go to bill bird.com. Um, [inaudible] um, and I listened to them and I listen, I hear all the dumb shit that I say and the stuff that I, I mispronounce like I was trying to say exclamation point a couple of weeks ago, exclamation point as an exclaim. And I actually said explanation point. Like it was explaining it to me in a very excited way.

Speaker 10:         01:16:58       Jesus Christ, this is fucking awful. You know what this is? You know what this is like, this is like your second day back at the gym. That's what this podcast feels like. You know, the first day he like, fuck this. You know, when you go nuts and then the next day you wake up and you're all sore and then he just fucking dragon asked. That's what this podcast is just dragon fucking dragging my freckle das. I don't have a freckle das, by the way. That would mean that I stunned bades in the nude. Um, all right, last week I was talking about how our Avocados, that whole bullshit where they're, uh, they're too, oh wait, that's for the wrong part of the podcast with a fuck. Is that information?

Speaker 10:         01:17:38       Jesus Christ. Bill. You know what, why, why do you even try? Oh, I fucked up. I will be, I can just tell you the gist of it. The reason why Avocados costs more when you go to get a Burrito was a, evidently there was some damage done to the crop a couple of years ago or some bullshit. So there was a shortage of them. Thus they were more expensive. And as always, the corporate cons pass the expense on to the regular people. And this is what happens. Then they had more fucking avocado, so it wasn't a fucking problem anymore. But they will like, well, wait a minute, people are already paying more for Avocados. Ain't never fucking complained. So they just kept them at the same price. So now you pay extra, which means means when it's time to change, what it means is that they're going to fucking, they're going to do that with every kind of food now, cause we're not bitching about, uh, our bacon.

Speaker 10:         01:18:35       I've got a breakfast sandwich and they said Bacon was extra. So you know what, that's my little rebellion. Fuck you all right. I'm not paying extra for my Avocados from my guacamole. You fucking cunt. You fucking corporate cons. How big is your God damn. Y'All gotta be all right. Let me, let me, I'm, you know, I'm going to wrap this up. You guys are getting a mini podcast this week. I'm not going to sit here and be treated this way on my podcast. When I sit here fucking bomb and like this, I got a reputation. Um, last week I have saying I didn't understand the difference between Great Britain. The United Kingdom is England, the country is England and Scotland. Two separate countries are, they're the same fucking thing. It was all confusing. So a, this guy says, hey bill, I'm from England. So answer your question might uh, England is a country.

Speaker 10:         01:19:20       Cause you said on your podcast, England wasn't a country, but is it you meant to write, but it is. What do you, if you're questioning yourself, sir, what the fuck am I supposed to do? Scotland is a country, Wales is a country. I didn't know that. I thought maybe Scotland was a country, but I didn't think Wales was a country. Ireland is a bit different because it's split into two countries to spelled t oh there's one of your smart fucking Europeans there. Everybody see that if we learn how to spell America, we can start making fun of them again. We at least we can have a a basis to make fun of them. Um, anyways, uh, continuing Ireland is a bit different because it's split into two countries. Northern Ireland, the Capitol is Belfast and the Republic of Ireland capital is Dublin. Both completely separate countries. Countries spelled country apostrophe s

Speaker 3:          01:20:20       okay.

Speaker 10:         01:20:20       Yeah. See this let's all they do over there. They watch fucking soccer and eat fish and chips. They don't want to fucking spell either. United Kingdom and this is what the United Kingdom is. It's a England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. Great Britain. Great Britain is England, Scotland and Wales. Reason being is Ireland is an island. Hence why Northern Ireland and the Republican Ireland are just known as Ireland. That doesn't make any sense. England is in Ireland or whatever. Fucking do the United Kingdom is an island island. I don't understand that. How come fucking, uh, Australia is not an eye is not considered an island surrounded on all sides by water.

Speaker 3:          01:21:02       Okay?

Speaker 10:         01:21:03       You know what the fuck. South America is an island at this point with the Panama Canal, isn't it? And why does it, it floated away. Um, anyways. Anyways, this podcast sucks. I'm sorry. What did, what the fuck do you want from me? All right. I'm fucking Neil O'Donnell this week. I've got nothing for you. I started doing this spelling tests and all these fucking nerds came out of the goddamn woodwork. This guy goes, Bill, here's an interesting piece of trivia. Facetious is the only word in the English language that has every vowel in order. A E. I. O. U. Isn't that interesting? Is that what I did with the spelling tests? Maybe this is why I never learned out of fucking spell, because that's the kind of people that you attract. Here's an interesting tidbit of information.

Speaker 3:          01:21:51       Okay?

Speaker 10:         01:21:52       Do you know that on the the fucking, they started talking about some moon off of Saturn that instead of fucking air, it's the, their atmosphere as methane gas. And I got to sit and I sit there and nod like, wow, you know, and I'm like, and he's sitting there thinking, I'm nodding because I'm so fucking interested and I'm really trying to do the math in my head. Trying to figure out when was the last fucking time this guy got laid? There's another great stereotype. If you're some fucking smart nerd, that means you don't get late in life. That's bullshit. It's only in fucking high school, you know? I Dunno, is it, I don't even know if it's fucking true. I just figure, you know, when you get smart, if you're really smart and you're good at business and that type of shit, you go out and make money and the second you make money, what's going to happen? A bunch of fucking cancer going to come out of the woodwork. Who wouldn't have fucked you back in a day because she couldn't throw a ball through a fucking hoop. You know? That's what that twats wanted to vacuum up when they were in high school.

Speaker 3:          01:22:52       Okay,

Speaker 10:         01:22:52       the, now all of a sudden look at you, you invented a fucking Hula hoop or whatever. The hell you did and now they want to bang. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          01:22:59       Okay.

Speaker 10:         01:22:59       Right. Isn't that how it works? Anything? I am flailing.

Speaker 9:          01:23:04       Okay.

Speaker 10:         01:23:05       I'm walking around.

Speaker 9:          01:23:06       Why do I feel like I have to make it 50 minutes bill, if you don't have anything to say, fucking bail. Ah, let me hike this. Um, the m m p m m podcast.com is the fan page, the official fan page, the only one that I sponsor, www, the [inaudible] podcast.com. So the only one that I, that I did well, who's kidding who? It's the only fucking one there is, but it's the only one that I sponsor. I'm trying to make it sound more official. Um, but anyway, so I think there's at the podcast for this week, I'm literally laying on my back right now just staring at the ceiling wondering where it all went wrong. Do I have anything left to talk about? Oh, I got something to foist. Somebody sent me an email. Let me, let me just reach for this fucking Straw. At this point, somebody sent me an email and it said overrated in the subject line.

Speaker 9:          01:23:56       And then I opened it and it said the Beatles and then underneath that he wrote, yeah, I said it. Let me tell you something right now. What? Like how much I fucking hate people who go, yeah, I said it. You know like this shocking you. Like they're going after some sort of fucking, you know, taboo. If you're ever in a comedy club. All right. And there's a comedian on, on stage and they, they're allowed one. Yeah, I said it. If they do any more than that. Yeah. You have my blessing to start throwing shit at them. I hate that. That fucking false

Speaker 10:         01:24:40       dangerous fucking horse shit. Fucking bitches d to get a job. What am I said Shit. You guys can't handle the truth.

Speaker 9:          01:24:51       Yeah,

Speaker 10:         01:24:52       we keep fucking going. Yeah, I said it. What? I said it, but it's like, dude, nobody in the crowd is going. Who said that? Did you say that? Yeah, I said it. You know what I mean? Like, like they're being led out and fucking let out and fucking handcuffs. What will people realize that nothing is shocking. You know? Look at the fucking Catholic Church. Look what the fuck they're doing. You know what is more shocking than the fact that they fucking look the other way? Cause I understand why they look the other way. Cause it's so much fun. Good money involved. And you know, to get to the top of any sort of pyramid, you have to be an ass kissing cunt. That's basically what it is. Unless you created it, unless you created whatever pyramid there is. And at that point you want your ass kissed.

Speaker 10:         01:25:42       So whenever there's money involved, they don't give a shit. I you, what is the most shocking thing about all of that is that people continue to go to the the Catholic church. Get anybody out there explained to me how they separate that. How do you separate that? How do you still go to the Catholic Church knowing that they had 16,000 cases? Those are just the ones that came forward. 16 fucking thousand. That's the population of a small town. 16,000 fucking rape of children. And you still go and you give them fucking money. What do you think they're going to use that money for? Lawyers to get these fucking guys off. You know, I dunno.

Speaker 10:         01:26:24       Why don't Ya Jesus Christ. Why, why, why, why do you go down that fucking road? All right. You know what? I'm really off my fucking game. Okay. Peyton manning threw an interception, the final fucking drive of the Superbowl. This is my, this is my fucking Peyton manning Superbowl game right here. Cause this, this podcast was it disjointed cluster fuck. And I really have nothing that I really think I was going to come here and I was, I had a little information about Avocados and uh, what is the United Kingdom? And I was somehow going to be able to fucking talk for 50 minutes. Do you realize like when you guys,

Speaker 10:         01:27:02       you, all you have to understand is the level of fucking ego that it takes. That I can look at three different things and think that I could run my fucking mouth for 50 minutes. It's not, this is even the podcast anymore. This is my confession scene that I didn't get to do because they're retooling it. All right? You broke me down. It's fucking over. You got me. I have nothing left. I bought the box set of the wire just looking at mom around my room, trying to come up with something. My voice gets weaker and I watched the first fucking season and that's a fucking great TV show, but I'm not going to be one of those guys who goes, this is the greatest TV show ever. It's fucking good. It's a really good show. I like it. I like it a lot. Did I gave a spelling test that I really do that I give a spelling test on the fucking podcast.

Speaker 10:         01:27:54       All right. You know what? I'm going to, I'm going to bow out gracefully right now. Okay. If you want, I add, I added a date. Here we go. Let me, let me actually use this podcast. What I really want to use it for, my ulterior motive here is the height. My God damn dates. I got some new dates out there. Everybody. Let's go to the official website of Bill Burr. He's doing officially one of the worst podcasts ever. Um, this week in Los Angeles, April 3rd at the Gibson MP theater. Um, I'm doing the, uh, Kevin and being a cancer show show for cancer. Hey, let's get rid of the cancer. Everybody. I believe that's the name of it. It's a fucking benefit for cancer. Uh, I'm going to get the punchline in Atlanta, April 8th, ninth and 10th, and I'm hanging around the 11th. I have tickets for the finals, not the finals to final day of the masters. Me and another buddy of mine. I'm going down there cause we knew tiger woods would cause what's going to play? We fucking knew it. Okay. Who's kidding? Who? You know, he's sick of bang in that broad. That's why he fucked around on her. It was her fault. She stopped him. You know, she wasn't washing the dishes. She didn't make sandwiches for him anymore. She started taking tiger for granted and tiger was sitting there and his billion dollar lazy boy. And he's like, is this bitch taken tiger woods? The greatest fucking Golfer of all time?

Speaker 9:          01:29:18       Okay,

Speaker 10:         01:29:19       actually, is it Jack Nicklaus? Jack Nicklaus is, but she's taken me for granted. Fuck this. I'm going to go fuck a whore. That's the one thing that I hated about that story is how they just never blamed her for his fucking around because it was clearly her fault.

Speaker 9:          01:29:38       Okay.

Speaker 10:         01:29:38       And if you're wondering why I'm coming up with that, I'm just using the, you know, it's speak eight. I'm saying it because of my respect for females, you know, because I respect you guys so much that I'm actually using your train of thought. When you look at, when you see a woman get caught cheating and you always view, always blame the guy.

Speaker 12:         01:30:02       What is funny because he wasn't paying attention to her. It's probably because he was doing this is probably because he was doing that whether shoe's on the other one,

Speaker 10:         01:30:11       but you know, they never say it's cause she wanted to go out and get some Dick. No, never. Because of that's cause it's something the guy was doing. He left his shoes in the fucking kitchen after she'd fucking mop the floor. So therefore she had to go to the fucking Luxor and collapse on somebody else's cock. Right. It's her fault.

Speaker 9:          01:30:32       Okay.

Speaker 10:         01:30:33       You know where the fuck does she get off getting mad at fucking tiger woods. Do you even have a fucking job woman? What is your job to go around gold dog fucking Tannin. What do you got to dope? I love these fucking twats who are married to some unbelievably rich person. Okay? They have kids with them and they don't have a fucking job and they still get help. Still got to have some fucking, you know nanny. It's like, do you want to fucking do anything? I Tony, that's, that's the guy's fault. If you marry a fucking woman who you're making so much goddamn money, all right that they don't even have a fucking job and they still need help. You need help with doing nothing.

Speaker 9:          01:31:21       Okay,

Speaker 12:         01:31:21       I'm raising kids.

Speaker 10:         01:31:23       What the fuck my mother did that and had a job. You Lazy Twat get off the Goddamn Sofa. That's what I would do. I take a right across my knee and pull off her fucking Gucci flip flop and I fucking paddle or right butt cheek until she admitted how fucking wrong she was. What do think about that? Maybe that's why I'm not a billionaire, you know, cause that's how I do it. John. I'm Razzi would take a picture of it. I do that at paddle. A little fucking right. Fannie is, I had grapes or, and then when they question me, I just, we fucked you. The God Damn Golfer in the world.

Speaker 3:          01:32:02       Okay,

Speaker 10:         01:32:02       thanks to me. Yes. Sunday's aren't boring. Come here. Come over here. I'll fucking sign you camera for you. All right. Take the film out. Yeah. There's no film anymore. It's fucking digital. Right?

Speaker 3:          01:32:15       Okay.

Speaker 10:         01:32:16       I Dunno. I want somebody who embrace being a piece of shit. That's what I want. That's what I got to say there. Tiger Woods wife is a lazy fucking Twat. All right. And that's why he cheated on her. And I'm going to tell you this right now. The reason why he's playing the masters is because they need the money.

Speaker 3:          01:32:33       Yeah.

Speaker 10:         01:32:33       All right. This guy is at work since November and I know what you're thinking. Oh God. Well he's a fucking billionaire. Yeah. And he's living the lifestyle of a billionaire. Do you think he wants to? Of course he does. And he's got to keep that fucking whore happy,

Speaker 3:          01:32:46       you know?

Speaker 10:         01:32:47       Do you think she cool? Do you think paid for all the fucking window? She smashed with that golf club, right? I like how he denied that shit in that attack way. Uh, with a golf club. Rarely your windows exploded and then you drove into a tree where you fucking on mushrooms. Did you think you could drive into that little? Not In the center of the trunk. Tiger me a fucking break. What are you sticking up for? You know why? Because he married her the fucking idiot. No, he's got this contract. You can't get out. He's, he's looking to lose all the a fucking idiot.

Speaker 3:          01:33:20       Okay.

Speaker 10:         01:33:21       I hope. I hope she listens to this. I don't even know our God damn name. You know? I don't know your name sweetheart, because you never did anything with your life. You know, it was the last time you even fucking, you ever, even when it's swim meet.

Speaker 10:         01:33:35       What about the preschool level? When kids are just happy, they can even fucking stand up. Did you even win a ribbon? What have you ever done besides suck the Dick suck the Dick. It was the greatest golfer of the last 50 fucking years other than Jack Nicklaus. You know that's your big accomplishment in life. Oh your heart. Let me ask the fellows that question. Let me ask you this. What have you or shacking up with fucking Oprah like Stedman. Do you think he gives a fuck if she fucks around on him? Going to chase him down or down the street with a ladle? Some other fucking utensil. Cause you know Oprah be eaten, right? You think he flipped it? I wouldn't give a shit gun. Fuck whoever you want. Oprah. I don't give a shit.

Speaker 3:          01:34:30       Okay.

Speaker 3:          01:35:14       Okay.

Speaker 10:         01:35:15       Anytime you see a guy fucking around on his woman, I'm telling you, part of it is because he's a dog. The other part is because these women are so fucking, well, they'll just lazy to, it's like they're not even human. They're just slothful.

Speaker 3:          01:35:33       Okay.
