Speaker 1:          00:00:01       Hey, what's going on? It's bill burn. It's the Monday morning podcast from Monday, September 16th, 2013. I hope this doesn't sound weird. I don't know what happened. I think my dog laid down on my mix. It sounded weird. Sounded weird to me, man. It's freaking me out. Me. And, um, how was your weekend? Why do I ask questions that you can't answer? Like I'm talking to a listener on the phone. I'm not, I'm not doing that. I'm laying here by myself as always excited to be back home. Um, for those of you who have lives, for those of you who just happened to, I dunno, end up on this podcast. Welcome. I do one of these every single week and a, I have a website, they bill bird.com and a, if you like what you hear here and you want to hear my fucking a standup specials, they have a hard copy version and a $5 downloadable version. Whatever the hell you want to do, it's right there for your taking. All right there. Whored myself out early. People showing a lot of leg early in the podcast. Um, I don't know where to begin with this weekend.

Speaker 2:          00:01:17       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:01:17       [inaudible] let's start at the beginning. First of all, just when I think Paul Versey is a smart man. Just when I think like, no, no. You know what? This guy isn't like, I don't little, I don't know what the word is. Do you know? I bet you guys have a lot of people like this. I, I know a number of guys in this business who have these unbelievable like perceptive powers. Like they see somebody, they can read them and, and they, they can figure out situations, but you know, you give them a simple math problem and you just see the look on their face and you the whole time you're friends with them, you wrestle. You'll, is this guy a smart guy?

Speaker 2:          00:02:04       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:02:05       Or is he a moron who just guesses really well? Now fucking with you, I obviously think Paul's a smart guy, but you know, we all have our moments. Paul Versey had a moment, uh, but right before we went to Texas, and this is the deal, we're doing El Paso on a Thursday night. We're doing San Antonio Friday night and then Saturday we'll go into the, uh, the Alabama and Texas a and m game and then we're going to get back and we're going to watch the Mayweather fight. That was basically the weekend. That was the plan. That's what was on the books. Okay. El Paso is a makeup date on the Billy red state tour and we added San Antonio. Okay. So one step back, two steps forward. That was the game plan. So me and Virginia ridiculously excited cause we're going to this fucking game and we're going to drive from El Paso to, to San Antonio. And in Texas is like, you're driving that all my God, good luck. That's, you're not gonna see anything. There's nothing. It's going to be like driving on the surface of the moon and all this shit. This is what they tell us. So I don't know what somebody told Versie, but evidently he's watched a couple, two or three things on these Mexican drug cartels and he was freaking the fuck out.

Speaker 1:          00:03:22       Like he's going. Yeah, dude, I don't know about this. Uh, this El Paso, you know, they got like these drug lords down there and blah, blah, blah, blah. And I don't know if, wait, are we talking about Paul? He goes, yeah man, I, I just wish we had a gun or something. He kept saying how he wanted to bring a gun and I was like, Paul, we're not going across the border. I'm not saying it's not a dangerous city. I'm not saying that it's not right next to a really dangerous city. And I'm not saying that something fucked up might not happen, but you, you're freaking out

Speaker 1:          00:03:52       and I need you to relax. And he just kept going. I'll do, we should take the tire iron and have that under the car. I mean under the front seat of the car. Like before when we liked, this is a guy who lives and works in New York City at night. All right? This is a classic, classic fucking New Yorkers. I'm telling you, they are no different than somebody who grew up in the middle of nowhere and lives on a farm. They're the exact same way. All they know is their world. He's so used to the danger that's familiar in New York City that he doesn't even see it anymore and he watches one on one or two of these fucking hardcopies 60 minute things on, uh, you know, people get in their faces, peeled back and getting tortured and kidnapped and all that shit down there in Mexico and all of a sudden he's freaking out, freaking out about Mexicans as he's driving by the Puerto Rican day parade. You see what I'm saying? Worried that he's going to get robbed when Wall Street is right down the fucking, I dunno, right around the corner from where he lives.

Speaker 1:          00:04:56       Those people have their fingers in your fucking account already. You're worried about some hypothetical shit. All right.

Speaker 1:          00:05:05       Where you live as third and short El Paso, that's a fucking Hail Mary when it comes to something actually happening. So I'm kept going, Paul, will you fucking relax? It's going to be fine. It's going to be great. It's going to be a part of the country you haven't gone to and we just kept bad. No, dude, I'm just saying I'm not an idiot. I know I'm from nude. It just kept escalating and at one park point I'm yelling at him on the phone and I went and I screamed the words drug cartel, trying to reason with them and then I just stopped and you can ask him this. I just said, listen, I just said drug cartel. I'm done with this conversation. I'll see you in El Paso so I fucking hang up. So I get to the fucking airport. I fly out and I'm ridiculously excited to go to El Paso, Texas and then fucking do this drive down to San Antonio, Texas.

Speaker 1:          00:05:55       All right. That was the game. And to let you know a left turns coming. How about a little foreshadowing? Here's a fucking letter in email I got from some somebody, I don't know where they live either in New Mexico. I don't know what Orin, Texas, this is what it says that my heart is like, I can't wait to go here. Can't wait to make up this date. I'll probably do an hour and a half on stage. This is going to be fucking awesome. That was my intention. This is the email I get Monday morning. Thanks for nothing, Bill. I'm done with you. I twice you've ditched El Paso and yesterday he means like, uh, the day of the Gig, he goes, I wasn't notified until 4:12 PM the show was at eight o'clock after a five hour drive to El Paso, basically that the show was canceled. He goes, apparently you think nothing of El Paso.

Speaker 1:          00:06:45       So right now you got to be sitting at your desk. You gotta be sitting in your shop. You got to be sitting at your cubicle, maybe sitting, sending a bus stop. Maybe you're waiting for that fucking plane to take off. And there's some [inaudible] telling you you have to power down your device and you don't feel like doing it because you want to know what happens in El Paso. All right? So this is what happens. I fucking, uh, I landed in El Paso and overseas already there and he's meeting me at the term and El Paso's a great fucking airport. It's one of those ones where there's no, am I in terminal a terminal B? The whole fucking thing is in one area. It's like a mom and pop airport. Get in, get out the securities grades. Fucking awesome. I love it. All right, so I land there and I get off the plane and there's Versie alright.

Speaker 1:          00:07:29       Dressed like he's going to go clean somebody's fucking pool. Yeah, he's got these fucking basketball shorts that are hanging down below his knee. Right. He didn't have on flip flop. He had on black socks, black sneakers and I think white shorts, Mesh shorts that hung down below. He was a fucking, and he said he was already, it was already a shit show and he's got his tee shirt on and he's sitting there with a backpack, like a book bag, like he's going to class or something and then like some assorted duffle bag, like he's going to go to the gym in 1977 this is how the man travels. Okay. And he's standing there with like this excited, relieved and nervous look on his face. He's at the airport and he's fucking nervous about being in El Paso because he's convinced that he's going to get kidnapped by some drug cartel.

Speaker 1:          00:08:25       Dragged back to Mexico and held for ransom. And evidently Obama's going to get on TV and be like, you know, we got to get this, this citizen back. He's done so much for this country. You know, this, this is what he's fucking concerned about. And immediately he starts going like, yeah, dude, dude, you know, I, I was just over there. You see that they are selling a bunch of skulls. They sounded like all these skeletons and all these skulls in the, uh, the gift shop and it sent Mexican holiday. You know that the day of the dead, I don't know when it is, but they celebrate the dead.

Speaker 3:          00:08:56       It's a little weird, but whatever Santa Claus isn't, you know, some fat fuck coming down you goddamn chimney to give you toys. And if you're a cunt, he puts some sort of fossil fuel.

Speaker 4:          00:09:08       Okay?

Speaker 3:          00:09:08       I love that. If you're bad, you get coal. Well, you still giving me a way to heat the house. You dumb cunt.

Speaker 3:          00:09:15       Why don't you just hit leave? Nothing. Just why don't you just leave a terse letter in my stock and you have a think about that. Um, it's not Santa Claus. It's Billy Gibbons. Grandfather. A lot of people don't know that, but let's continue. Speaking of Texas. So I'm already laughing and I'm just like, Paul, come on man. It's the day of the dead. And I actually went up and I bought the magnet knee is actually into that shit. So I was like, all right, let me, uh, let me grab one of these fucking magnet things here. And um, so I'm just laughing at them. So now we drive over and it's, it's like already starting to rain.

Speaker 4:          00:09:50       Okay.

Speaker 3:          00:09:50       Which in my, in our worlds is no big deal. It wasn't even that bad or rain. It was kind of bad, but not that bad. Right. So we're driving around, I'm fucking all excited just checking out the landscape, the different buildings. And it's a really cool city where, you know, they have some corporate shit, but for the most part the Starbucks is and those kinds of things. I don't know, the skyscrapers aren't really fucking with El Paso. Like everything's kind of like get, you know, like, uh, no more than like a five story building. There's a few, but generally speaking, you drive down the street. It looks like one giant main street is all these places, right? The lady at the Hertz Rental car tells us where to get, uh, some good Mexican food. We go there, I forget the name of this shit that we had, but it was on fucking believable. It was great. And of course we walk into the place and it's some mom and pop kind of place that the locals go to. We walk in, everybody turns to look first. He immediately thinks he's going to get kidnapped. He goes, dude, you just see that everybody's, everybody's looking at us.

Speaker 3:          00:10:48       It's like Paul that happens in a dive bar where you're from, where you fucking relax, you're going to get us fucking punched in the face with that fucking look on your face. Alright, Jesus Christ. So we sit down, we have an amazing fucking meal first starting to relax a little bit, right? And I'm sitting there and I haven't this, this might, this little FedEx envelope. I have the four tickets to l pass up to El Paso to the, uh, the Aggie game. And I got the four cigars were going to smoke. All right. And, uh, you know, for, for the, for people going into the game and I just keep holding onto that thing, like, yeah, might as well had it handcuffed to my wrist. I was so paranoid that I was going to lose the tickets, crushed the cigars and just fuck up the whole weekend. So, um, we eat, it's awesome. And we drive down the main street and versus you just going, yeah, I do that. I don't, I don't like this, I don't like this. Right. And he said she's all fucking nervous and we get to the hotel, it's a fucking hotel. They check us in, everything's all good. We get up to the rums and, uh, I called the venue by tee shirts for the red state towards

Speaker 1:          00:11:54       shown up. Everything's looking like it's going to go good. Then it starts raining a little bit more. But once again, you know, actually when we would go in there too, there was some streets that were blocked off because of flooding. And I'm like, ah, you know, it's kind of a desert out here, so I guess they don't handle the rain too well, but I wasn't thinking anything. And then all of a sudden my agent called up along with the promoter and they said, listen, the first thing they sent me was that it had the venue, it got switched, which should've been the first red flag. They said the venue I supposed to perform it lost power and they were having a little bit of flooding or something like that. And I was like, you know, I'm looking at my hotel window like really? I had no idea I that doesn't seem right.

Speaker 1:          00:12:37       So then they fucking, they said, change of venue. It said, please wait, let me confirm that. And I said, all right. So I sat there and all I'm thinking is people are driving into the fucking show. I don't want to start the show and have half of them go to the wrong theater. The other half girl, the right to you. So I say fuck it. And I tweeted out and I say, a, the venue has been changed. It's now over here, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. Um, about a half hour after that, my agent and the fucking promoter call up and they say, listen, um, you know, we're now having problems at the other theater. Like there might be a power outage and because of the flooding and roads and all this type of shit, people like maybe half the crowd is going to show up. So I was like, all right, wait a minute now if only half the crowd shows up, does that other half get refunds? And they said, no.

Speaker 1:          00:13:37       So what do you want to do? Do you want to do the show or do you want to reschedule it? So at that point I'm going to fuck over half the people. So I said, no, let's reschedule it. I'll fly back out here. It's only, you know, a couple, two, three hour flight. I'll do it again. And uh, you know, I'll figure something out. You know, let's rescheduled as soon as we can. So I went on Twitter, I deleted that one, and then I sent the thing and I knew that there was going to be people like this guy who's fucking pissed. Um,

Speaker 1:          00:14:06       all of that shit happened between two and four o'clock. So my apologies to the person who's done with me, but, uh, you know, and I said on Twitter to quote breaking bad and uh, Hule slash Lavelle Crawford who's a fucking, a phenomenal comedian and actor, uh, was an act of God. There was nothing I could do was I supposed to do, you know. Um, so I, uh, I apologize that it didn't happen and then, you know, me and [inaudible] went out and got absolutely fucking hammered and spend as much money as we could in El Paso killing our livers and brain cells. I actually, we went to a bar and we uh, I ran to a couple people that was supposed to come out to the show and they kind of explained to me that because it doesn't rain out there a lot, that the grounds really dry and it can absorb it and then you just kind of flows down right over the top of it.

Speaker 1:          00:15:03       I have no idea because that looked like a above average rain storm to me and um, so whatever. So I am going to reschedule it. Surf you are done with me. Uh, I understand, but I was not my fault and the first time I guess it was my fault cause I chose an acting gig in a movie. But um, what the, what am I supposed to do? I have to do that. That'd be like, sir, you are going to go to my, my fucking show. And all of a sudden the chick you always wanted to bang says, Hey, you know what? You can hit it but only tonight. What are you going to say? You're going to come and see my dump. Freckled redhead, you're not. So there you go. All right. So that's just the beginning. People of my Texas trip, my tech, my trip to the great state of fucking Texas.

Speaker 1:          00:15:46       Um, all right, let me, uh, it's not one of these things out here. People will advertise and for the weak dollar shave club, everybody, there's so many things in the world that irritate me. Um, reigning in hell in El Paso, Texas that causes the shows to get canceled. This guy walking around telling everybody wherever the hell he lives, then I'm a piece of shit and that I don't care about El Paso. I care about a party. Um, when you fly out of a smaller city, so they stick you on a smaller plane. So instead of taking 50 minutes and now it takes the same fucking three hours, so you might as well just flown out of Dallas. That also irritates me. Um, when so many things can irritate you, why add razors to the list? It's time to stop milking your razor blades. Everybody. I know with brand name razors, you're used to paying outrageous prices and exhausting those razors until they start to look like rusty soda cans.

And so that, so they know that we sent you. All right. That's it. Hulu plus.com/bill. Okay. All right, let's continue on. So unfortunately for the second time the El Paso Gig did not happen. Um, I don't know why. I have no idea why it didn't seem like it was raining that bad. I definitely saw a lot of emergency vehicles. There was definitely a lot of, uh, you know, flashing official lights. I know I had to make like three d toward turns because the road's kept getting blocked off. But, uh, I don't know. I'm determined to make this show happen. Maybe the third time will be a fucking chair.

Speaker 1:          00:19:28       Um, all right. So anyways, so me and [inaudible] go out and we watched the, uh, the Patriots jets game and he's cracking up because I have the entire patriots' offense and defense and jets offense and defense written down on two cheat sheets, flipping them over and that type of stuff. So I know what the hell is going on because I'm obsessed with watching the offensive line this year, you know, and I'm also enjoying watching Brady playing with the level of talent that he has at the wide receiver position and watching him, uh, getting frustrated and trying to get those guys on the same page. And I already saw a huge improvement between, uh, the first week and the second week, especially from a, that Tompkins kid. The first week he had a brutal week, I think maybe you have one cat, she bumped into another receiver on like a pig play down by the end zone.

Speaker 1:          00:20:24       And uh, I know I thought he was a 100% better and I know it was a sloppy, ugly game, but I liked to, shit, I like watching a team rebuilt. Like I said, it's a very, it's very healthy for the fan base. It's kind of like a forest fire where it's necessary. It's kind of a horror show. You don't want to see it, but it's necessary, you know, and uh, when a team has to rebuild, what it does is, uh, it Kinda, it burns off a lot of the bandwagon. Um, I actually got into with a buddy of mine, he was sitting at saying that Bellacheck is overrated. And, uh, what has he done since 2004 when last time we won? It's like, I dunno, went to two more Superbowls.

Speaker 2:          00:21:05       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:21:05       Four grand total of seven Superbowls that he's, he's been to,

Speaker 1:          00:21:10       is that right? Three. Five, seven. Yeah. And he's won five out of seven. You know what I mean? Hey, find out what the fuck you problem is. And we went through a soup bowl two years ago. That's like some New York, Philly, Boston shit where it's like, they get this so fucking, I don't know what, so quick to pull the trigger and be like, fuck this. I'm Outta here. You know? I mean, a lot of shit happened. We lost Welker to free agency. We didn't want to pay him, but we've always done that. That's been our model. We let ty Lago, lawyer Malloy all the way back. We let all those guys go when we felt they wanted too much money and that it was going to affect, uh, the overall level of what we wanted to do. Bella check is always, you know, traded his way out of the first round. He's running to get a second round guy. We could have had Dez Bryant. He goes, I don't want to get that fucking guy. You know, he doesn't like that flash type shit. He just doesn't, and it's when you want too much money, let you go. He's been doing that forever and it's worked. So I'm not questioning the guy and uh,

Speaker 1:          00:22:16       I'm going to enjoy watching them try and, uh, you know, win some games this year and the very what looks to be very weak, AFC east. Um, I'm going to say some really obvious shit this week about football. Uh, I watched the Broncos giants yesterday tape that game. And a Broncos are obviously the team to beat. Um, I didn't know they had holiday to being an Lsu fan. I was trying to keep an eye on him when he went to the Texans. He just was so exciting to watch when he played for Lsu. I didn't get to see him too much. Um, I know he took back a word kickoff and upon a playoff game last year, but now the Broncos have, and we took one back. So now that special teams are a threat, they got a great defense or offensive line is ridiculous. They got that dude, uh, the hell's his name there. Uh, no, Sean Moreno and Peyton looks better than he ever did. So obviously that's the team to beat. Uh,

Speaker 2:          00:23:15       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:23:15       You know, the usual powerhouse teams, the Patriot Steelers in them, they're not looking too good. Somebody for the love of God. Figure out the fucking San Diego chargers for me, Jesus Christ, those fucking guys, what they're doing to their fan base. If I hadn't been down to a game and had such an awful time, I would actually feel bad. I actually still do. I feel bad for most of the people because I'm sure most of the people were cool. It's just a cut sitting behind me. Um,

Speaker 2:          00:23:41       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:23:42       But anyways, but I gotta tell you, even after the Broncos

Speaker 3:          00:23:47       handle their business with the, uh, the giants, I have to tell you, watch and Seattle on the 40 niners was, it was what, it was a whole other level of a professional football. And, um, and even though Seattle really manhandled, not manhandled, but really handled the 40 niners, um, I've just watched enough football to realize it's only September. And that doesn't mean shit. It's definitely a good thing you won the game. But that by no means basically says, well, you'll definitely beat them again, and then you'll beat them again if you have to win. If you've got to play in January, it's probably going to go back and forth. But, uh, I guess, Hey, that dude, Richard Sherman, not only is a fucking phenomenal player, but he, that guy's fucking hilarious. Um, somehow I missed last year when he would yelled at Brady. I miss that. You know what it is?

Speaker 3:          00:24:37       I don't watch pregame and postgame analysis. I just can't sit there and watch about people talking about people getting it done and not getting it done and what people have to do that day. It's like, I dunno, I, that shit drives me well, you know, you know what I really like. I like when they cut to that guy who knows the rules and can break down what the fuck just happened. I liked that stuff. And I like listening to the former players tell stories, but like analysis of what just happened or what's going on. So I usually just shut the thing off.

Speaker 5:          00:25:09       MMM.

Speaker 3:          00:25:11       And so what our eyes, I saw the Brady thing and then I watched that thing where he came at skip Bayless. We see set, I'm better at you in life. It said I'm the top whatever in my field and I would not put you in that level and broadcasting. And I just thought it was hilarious

Speaker 5:          00:25:34       and um,

Speaker 3:          00:25:36       I dunno, I thought he could have hit him even harder. You know what he should have said if some point Richard Sherman should've said to skip Bayless when skip was disagreeing with the, with, with, you know, Sherman, that he was one of the, I guess top guys in the League, whatever the hell the argument was, what he should've said to him was he should have said, yeah, what do I know? What do I know? I just play for a real professional football team. I don't play in a fantasy football team. I just do this for a living. I play football for a living. You Watch it? Yeah. Why? Why would I know? Why would I know better than you please you, you sit there with the, a brand new knees and shoulders that have never been fucked up in your brain that's never been concussed cause you never played a context sport you bad bit and play in Jackass with your fucking game show host hair. Why don't you tell me? Why don't you tell me who the best fucking quarterbacks are in the league? I if he, if he went that way. Oh, I already loved what he did. So,

Speaker 5:          00:26:35       mmm.

Speaker 3:          00:26:37       I'm looking forward to that. A, he was funny, he went up be pat his old coach on the ass after he beat him. I think that's, I think that's really, especially

Speaker 1:          00:26:44       if it gets the job done, but if you are gonna run your mouth, you better hang out on the field if they loose. Which, but like I said, I don't know much about him, but a Seattle looks fucking, they look amazing and uh, I, I was laughing my ass off when I saw Pete Carroll doin though. Woo. He's got more of an edge to him now. He used to just look like he was Robert Young on father knows best to bring out a fucking reference from 60 years ago. He used to look wholesome. I don't know what happened to him at USC. I know some dirt went down, you know. And uh, do you guys see the cover of this? Why don't Fall Pete Carroll? Did you guys see the cover of our sports illustrated this week? Talking about all this stuff that happened at Osu and all the filth and the sex and the scandals and the boosters and all that type of shit. Um, I think at this point sports illustrated has done a cover story about probably half the football programs. They write that article every fucking year and a half, two years about some sort of scandal about either football, basketball, whatever sport that's going on. And they act like it's shocking. Um,

Speaker 1:          00:27:58       here's the deal. Okay. If it wasn't for these football and basketball programs and the money that they generate, most people's fucking campuses would look like El Paso, Texas, a fucker with the El Paso. But you know what I mean? They'd look like there would be nothing there. The sports programs build all the dormitories, the eye and that article, I read the pack 12 sine of $3 billion TV contract and these kids are going out there, you know,

Speaker 1:          00:28:36       doing lifetime damage to their bodies for no fucking money for no money. Um, I know a lot of people go, well you mean no money. You give free education to joke the foot. Say they had time to fucking go to school. Okay, let's just say they had time to do, let's just say that the schools also only drafted people who could actually, you know, uh, only sign people could actually handle the school work load. You know what I mean? They didn't get somebody who flunked everything in fucking high school and found a fucking loophole and then stuck them in the basket weaving class. Let's say they actually fucking tried to educate them. You don't have time with that. I Dunno. I don't think you do. Anyways, I'm going to skip Bayless. He, I never fucking play. And then secondly, if you get hurt, they'd take away your fucking scholarships and then not trying to educate you. And even if they do fucking educate you, the amount of fucking money generated versus what it costs to stick you in a fucking dorm is a joke. It's a fucking joke. So I don't

Speaker 3:          00:29:42       know what the solution is. I Dunno if you pay him, but I understand why those boosters come around and give the money. I get it. It's fucking ridiculous. Look, if I go to some fucking strip mall and I give a great show and I sell a bunch of tickets, like I get compensated,

Speaker 4:          00:30:01       you know what I mean?

Speaker 3:          00:30:04       I, I don't, and these guys play in front of an entire stadium,

Speaker 3:          00:30:10       entire fucking stadium sold out nationally televised fucking games and they don't get any, they get like a $15 like stipend, $15. I mean, I guess you could feed you and two other teammates if you went to Mcdonald's. I don't know what, but anyways, I'm just saying it's a filthy fucking business. So, uh, I don't need sports illustrated to expose what you already know what's going on. I mean, Jesus Christ, it's the same story they've been doing forever. And then they get some hot girls there and they fucking bang the recruits so they feel like, wow, I'm going to be a rock star here. Yeah, exactly. Exactly. They're doing what they're supposed to be doing, that trying to make money and that's how the game's played. All right. So anyways, uh, so the El Paso Gig gets rained out and uh, I was anticipating way more emails like that. So, uh, people of El Paso, you're very understanding and the person who's pissed at me, I get why you mad at me. Uh, but I, I can't handle it at the, the weather or the typography is not, is beyond my control. All right? So I'm going to reschedule it and uh, you know, if you don't show up, I understand why.

Speaker 4:          00:31:26       Okay.

Speaker 3:          00:31:27       I, you know, go fuck yourself at fucking rain and they cancel it. I did, you know, Geez, I'm done apologizing. All right. Um, so next day we wake up in the morning and a, we're going to go drive to, uh, from El Paso, San Antonio, Texas. And everybody is telling us that, you know, like they said that there's, you know, there's nothing out there. It's going to be like driving and they'd like laughing at me. Then I'm going to do it cause it's like a seven hour drive, eight hour drive or whatever. And I got to tell you was one of most beautiful drives I've ever gone on in my life verse. He's freaking out. Like he was worried that between El Paso and San Antonio Somehow we were going to get abducted driving the speed limit 80 miles an hour. So I'm doing like 87 88 and got the cruise control set. We're fucking flying. I don't know what he thinks somebody is going to jump off, you know, down a highway. I don't know what he thought was going to happen and if you saw what was on either side of us, anybody who comes at us is going to be like hallucinating from lack of of water. It looked like a spaghetti western out there. It was absolutely fucking gorgeous. You ride a motorcycle, that would be a great one to go. I would definitely wait till it wasn't so fucking hot out. Um,

Speaker 3:          00:32:45       I'm telling you Plat, we saw a fucking, everything we saw, we saw vultures on the side of the road. The real ones. The ones, what the hell boy heads that fucking all red head and, and the fucking those black feathers just picking apart this carcass was fucking, I was unbelievable. Absolutely gorgeous. It made you want to ride a horse. It was one of the great drives I've ever had. Um, so underrated El Paso, Texas and then driving to San Antonio, Texas. It was a fucking great time. Um, and people saying that there's, I guess nothing out there to see basically means you can't go to a subway sandwich. There's no mall, there's no outlet. There's no movie theater. That classic shit. Well, when I go out there, I can't see what I can already see here. Therefore they got nothing out there for me to say. I shouldn't have done that in a southern accent because they appreciate the outdoors. Those southerners, hell half of them live in the outdoors, don't they? It is a stereotype. Sorry. Um,

Speaker 6:          00:33:54       okay.

Speaker 3:          00:33:55       Silversea it now [inaudible] is enjoying ease and joy and Nah, he's starting to enjoy Texas about, look at this Paul. Every fucking twist and turn every going up and down the hill. Look at this valley. Look at that. Look at that plateau, look at that. I don't look at those rocks. Legit shit. We're not going to see. Um,

Speaker 6:          00:34:15       yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:34:15       And meanwhile our buddy who's going to the game, he'd already arrived in San Antonio and he thought we were driving. So he's like, dude, I'm already at the hotel bar. Where are you guys? So rather than text and back, we made them this fucking, uh,

Speaker 3:          00:34:29       this video that we actually, we did with two. We did it with two i-phones. We use the music on my iPhone. I ran it through the radio and then verse, he filmed it and we did it. And uh, I think it was two texts. The first take, the music was too loud. And then the second take is the one that we actually used. And uh, he fucking laughed his balls off. It's basic. It's a video from us to our buddy who's sitting in San Antonio letting them know that we're driving and we're on our way. So definitely check that out. That'll be up on the, um, the podcast page. Bill [inaudible] dot com check it out. Now. What am I saying? It's going to be up. It'll be up by the time are listening to this, hopefully. Um, so anyways, we're driving and as far as finding places to stop, it's definitely slim pickings.

Speaker 3:          00:35:14       So we ended up, uh, we stopped at this Mcdonald's. We had to get gas and we just stopped at a fucking Mcdonald's. There was nothing else out to any port in a storm. So we go in there, we walk in and Mcdonald's is something you do, I love about Mcdonald's. You know, you shouldn't be nay. So you always avoid it. But when you finally give in that you're going to eat it, this is certain level of excitement or you just like, fuck it. If I'm going to eat it, I'm strong with down. So I went in there, I had been in there and I can't remember the last time, and they got something, they got a triple cheeseburger and it's like, absolutely, I'll take one of those fuckers as perfect. I'll take one of those, give me a large fry and a, then I got a water.

Speaker 3:          00:35:53       That was my way of trying to be halfway healthy. Forsee orders like a fucking smoothie. I love it. It Mcdonald's go to is a fucking smoothie, right? It's probably ground up like squirrel tail with some, I don't even know. I don't know what, um, so he orders that. So we're standing in line and we're waiting to get our food and all of a sudden Versie just creeps up on me, gets right in my ear, and he just goes, dude, don't turn around. I don't look. But there is a guy right behind me sitting down in a red shirt with the mustache who is trying to fucking stare me down. He just, no joke, dude. He just gave me one of the most hardcore fucking stare down it looks I've ever seen in my life. All right, so now he's got me fucking nervous. I'm like, what the fuck's he talking about? So I kind of do the pretending to stretch and I glance over and I look over at the guy and he has like some sort of brain damage. Okay. He's sitting there, you know that full metal jacket. Look you, your head's kind of down. So you're looking through the horizon of your eyebrows with your mouth hanging open. That's what he's doing. There's barely any brain activity. I don't know if he had some sort of, uh,

Speaker 3:          00:37:09       a head trauma or whatever, and then I kind of scan around them and there's like seven other adults with the same look on their face. And then I look in this two reasonable, not reasonable to regular looking at adults. Whatever adjective I use is going to be offensive. Um, two adults with all their faculties, obviously they brought these people here in a van to fucking Mcdonald's. And I look at Paul, Mike Duke, the guy's fucking idiot. It's got special needs.

Speaker 3:          00:37:38       You should've seen the guy though. He looked like fucking a, you know, Jack Nicholson in one flew over the cuckoo's nest. When he fakes it, he got the lobotomy. That's what the fuck this guy look like. And so finally verse, he just starts laughing and he realizes that he's being an idiot. And now he's so into Texas. We're driving for the rest of said to San Antonio, he's looking for a place to buy a cowboy hat. And a couple of cap guns cause he wants to make another fucking youtube video of him standing on the side of the road of this, of this highway on a rock, you know, doing some shit about how he loves Texas. And this is the same fucking guy who like two hours earlier wanted to have a tire under one under the seat and some sort of fucking pistol to shoot whoever the fuck was going to kidnap us.

Speaker 3:          00:38:23       So I don't know, long story short then we've got, we have got to San Antonio, we did the, we did that Gig. Had a great time. And uh, I think I'm going to run out of time here because I've got to read your letters. We ended up going to the, uh, the next day we, we go to the ag you game and we were coming up from Houston. We drove over to Houston. So we basically drove across the state of Texas, uh, on the 10 from El Paso all the way to Houston and then a Houston. We fucking drove to a Walmart to meet this booze bus to drive us up. Now they had to booze buses and eight in the morning and one at 1130. Everybody jumped on the eight in the morning cause they wanted to get fucked up. We showed at the 1131, it was like us, this older couple and then a group of four people in the back, the whole bus to ourselves.

Speaker 3:          00:39:06       And they are Alabama fans and they were all cool as hell. And it was awesome man. They had all these beers and then they had like this, uh, you know, some brisket, beans and all this shit that they made for you. It was fucking great with Chow and the food was slamming beers. Um, we've got the cigars, we got the tickets were ready to go drive up there. There's no fucking traffic because everybody's already there partying and we pull into college station, we see the stadium, we see everybody up there with the fucking, uh, Aggie colors on. I never noticed how much, how much rent, a brighter red Alabama's colors are then the ag is. And until you saw the two fans, you know, Stan it together and was just, it was fucking awesome. We had a great time going into the game, right as we got, and we got an adjust right up to the flyover and Manzell was starting to drive down the field and do it. I gotta tell you when they scored those first two touchdowns, the stadium was going fucking crazy. Aggies go up 14 to nothing.

Speaker 2:          00:40:09       Okay.

Speaker 3:          00:40:09       And uh, you know, cause we were thinking Alabama was going to win. I didn't think they were going to cover it, but I was like, I think they're going to win. And uh, he goes up 14 and nothing and they was shutting them down on defense and then I don't, it was one of the loudest stadiums. I fucking bed and,

Speaker 3:          00:40:25       and then all of a sudden, oh by the way, that whole fucking thing with the Seahawks fans trying to set the record to be the loudest crowd is one of the gay is things I think I've ever seen in my fucking life. You know, what are you guys doing? You know, you know what that shit, somebody tweeted me that and I said, well you know when you've never won a championship you got to hang your hat on something. What is the purpose of that Seattle fans and you might win one this year, but as of right now, what, what are you guys doing? What is, what is the, the the, do you guys have a team song? If it is, I, I, if I, if it is, I have to guess it's going to, it's basically this, we are the loudest by friends, eh?

Speaker 7:          00:41:12       Okay.

Speaker 3:          00:41:14       Till we lose Doo Doo, Doo Doo.

Speaker 8:          00:41:18       Who we are the loud it is.

Speaker 7:          00:41:30       Oh louder. Loud.

Speaker 3:          00:41:36       Cause the architect designed the building to make a sound louder. You're a bunch of cheaters up there. You're not louder than anybody else, you know louder than those Aggie Fan. They had some rooftop orchestra fucking pit to keep it all contained. Bade sound loud to this is the thing people, I went to a game there, I heard I'll fucking unbelievably loud it was, but I looked at the fans and you weren't yelling any louder. There was no guy like, like fucking punching himself. Like how you could yell louder

Speaker 3:          00:42:13       than any other human beings. You're, you're, we're basically created, we call came out of the same fucking mud puddle. You can't yell louder, you know, more passionate or nothing. You just got that little rooftop thing there. Hold it in. You know why? Because for all these years you've needed that extra help. All right? But enough, just when a fucking championship, when a Goddamn Chan, which might happen this year, I hope it does because when it does, you won't waste your time on stupid pointless things like trying to be the loudest, you think you're louder than Kansas City chief fence. Those fans allowed. Okay. And they've had nothing to chairs about. Tear of off for fucking years. So anyways, so we go in there, the fucking Aggie game. It was ridiculously loud. All natural to no ped snow architect trying to help him out. Just fucking completely natural Christ.

Speaker 3:          00:43:02       They didn't even have half a fucking third. A third of the stadium was missing, you know, one of the end zones, they just had these little bleachers. You could see the dorm rooms, the traffic going by, you look far enough, he could probably see a cow taken a shit out in the field. Um, so anyways, they go up 14 to nothing. And then here comes fucking Bama. 14, seven, 14, 1421, 14, Alabama, 28, 14 Alabama than halftime. And I gotta tell you they took the fucking air out of that stadium. All right. Fucking Aggies. Did they get the ball back? I think Alabama had at first, I don't remember. I was pretty hammered. Uh, but all I know is that they stopped them or whatever, but then the Aggie start fucking drive and then they throw a fucking pick and the guy takes it back.

Speaker 3:          00:43:55       35, 14, five unanswered touchdowns. And, uh, one of my buddies that I'm, I'm with WHO's in the pro semipro football hall of fame. All right. Which is a fucking accomplishment, more than skip Bayless of it. Did. Why am I attacking skip? I just think it's funny to make fun of that guy. I don't give a shit about him either way. Um, he was just talking about, uh, Alabama's offensive line that just saying like the blown them off the ball. I don't give a fuck who you, what weapons you have. If you went in that war, you're going to win the fucking game. And he was saying how uh, what's his face was going to run the score because they uh, they uh, they lost last year or they beat, they got beat last year. And uh, so I'm sitting there, I, I can't believe once again, I get unbelievably depressed.

Speaker 3:          00:44:43       I just want to see Alabama fucking loses is the second year in the role. But then all of a sudden here come the Aggies, 35, 21. Okay. The kind of back in it and then it was dead. Fucking Alabama scores. 42, 21, people start thinking it's over. But then the Aggie score again, 42, 28. Then they finally got that number four in Alabama to fucking do something wrong all day. He fumbles the ball, they get the ball, they throw it to that number 13 kid. Fuck, I should know his name. The guy had like 290 something yards receiving at Goddammit, I'm the worst. I really should know his name and I should say at the name of every fucking offensive lineman on Alabama, they were fucking unreal. Anyways, they're on like their own six or five yard line. He, Johnny football throws the thing like 50 yards, 13 catches it's stiff arms to dude covering them and runs the rest of the way of fucking like 96 yard touchdown. And now all of a sudden it's 42 35. It's like, what the fuck?

Speaker 3:          00:45:44       Here come the Goddamn Aggies. And then right when you think they're going to tie it up, just Mike going overtime. Fucking Alabama scores 49 49 35 and then fucking Aggies come back 49 42 and then that was it. And it was fucking over that. Why me? Tell me, what is that seven 76 13 touchdowns, 13 touchdowns. The Aggies had over 600 yards in offense and still lost the game. Um, I dunno, it was an, it was an unbelievable, unbelievable game. Um, [inaudible] self at some point you got to go to college station, go take taken an Aggie game. We didn't have time to hang out the Dixie chicken and all those places that look cool as hell. Um, cause we had to catch the fucking bus going back. And uh, all right, as great as the bus was going back, it was an absolute shit show.

Speaker 3:          00:46:36       I mean, coming up, it was great going back, it was an absolute fucking shit show. First of all, we get back to the thing, you know where we're supposed to meet and everybody's breaking open brews. And at this point I'm done with drinking, you know, cause I'm gonna fucking fall asleep and I want to watch this fight and I'm sitting there and then this, this, this lady comes up to me and she starts talking to my buddy and he said something really nice about is she asked him a question and he said something really nice about his wife like ours or she just said, hey, what do you think about all these ag girls out here? And he goes, ah, you know, I'm married, I love my wife, I don't really look above blah, blah, blah. And then she goes, good answer. Like all of a sudden, like he has to fucking get her fucking approval and immediately I'm just like, can't

Speaker 2:          00:47:23       cunt.

Speaker 3:          00:47:25       You know when you're going to whisper it. Right? What a Dick. Good answer.

Speaker 4:          00:47:31       Okay,

Speaker 3:          00:47:31       so you give me another thing too was nobody's talking to you. Just come fucking walking up, right? So she says to me, what are you doing here? I said, Oh, you know, I've just hanging out with my friends who had came out. She goes, I was, is she? She goes, is this your little, is this your little guy's weekend out? Right? And I'm just like looking at, and I just looked, I was like, no, no, no, it isn't.

Speaker 4:          00:47:52       Okay,

Speaker 3:          00:47:53       Doug, who are you? Get the fuck Outta here. You know? Then she went over and she started throwing a football and she could throw a football. So that I think that I shouldn't have whispered, can just cut. She's not a right. She could throw a football. This, there's gotta be something that's all right with her. Right. So anyways, so this guy on the way up on the bus, like 30 year old guy from Alabama was a cool guy, funny guy and all that. Now he's completely loaded and is one of the biggest jerk offs you're ever gonna meet and your fucking life in Amelie's like

Speaker 7:          00:48:27       you hang here college day, should you, hey here you go. Hey come on you are. Hey

Speaker 3:          00:48:33       cause it was two buses, the early one in the next one left for another four us

Speaker 7:          00:48:37       the chain here called station. We you are hanging here in college station

Speaker 3:          00:48:42       and I'm like no I'm on the early bus and all I'm thinking is thank God this fucking jackass is not on the early bus cause I don't know what happened to him cause he was a great guy and the way up shut the shit with them almost for like the whole fucking write up. We were all taught his group and our group was totally cool but I don't know this fucking guy, one of those guys add alcohol. He becomes a completely different person. So now we got to go meet this booze bus back. There's a bunch of people I know it's going to be packed. And who comes walking up this fucking Shit Bird, right?

Speaker 7:          00:49:12       Well, you know, no one else is. Dang it has the word taking the bus.

Speaker 3:          00:49:18       We get on the bus, I sit down verse, he sits next to me in this fucking jerk off and his buddy, his buddy was cool. They sit right across from us cause sort of diagonal. So immediately what I do, because it's pitch black out, it's Sun's gone down. I just closed my eyes and I act like I'm sleeping. Cause I'm like, I'm not making contact with that fucking shit show. Right? And are the buddy sitting right in front of us and uh, this fucking guy, I'm telling you, the whole ride back would not shut up. And he's just yelling,

Speaker 7:          00:49:50       hey, hey, 12th man, I ain't he shear. You guys were quiet as hell. I, no couple of touchdowns. Then he just starts saying I'd suck a Dick.

Speaker 4:          00:50:01       Okay.

Speaker 3:          00:50:01       I Dunno why. I Dunno what spawned it. He just kept going, right?

Speaker 7:          00:50:05       Say I suck a Dick. I would suck a Dick Right now if I could fuck. And he would name somebody famous. Who's playing that king? Would you fuck Kathy Bates if you could fuck. I tell you I would suck a dick now I'm not talking about a hermaphrodite ain't doing no licky licky sticky, sticky. Just wouldn't,

Speaker 3:          00:50:28       I know this sounds funny, but it wasn't. It was like old people. A couple rows up and at one point this girl got up, this lady gets up to go to the bathroom and he does this. Whoa, Whoa, hey, you know, like this. And all of a sudden I felt like I was like in the accused, like he was making her uncomfortable in like a fucking sexual way. It was really fucking bad. So,

Speaker 4:          00:50:53       okay.

Speaker 3:          00:50:54       I Dunno, I don't, I don't even fucking remember. Then file infers. He keeps going like I'm going to say something and we keep saying, I just keep going. Forsee the guy is a jerk off. Okay, you got a wife, you've got kids, you got a house. Okay. When a lose the fight, you're going to lose. All right? Just this in our life for another fucking half hour, just ignore him and [inaudible]. I Dunno why, I dunno. Started gate verse. He finally just said to the guy, cause he kept butting into our conversations and I would just go, hey listen, I'm talking to my friend, you know, I don't want to talk to you or whatever. And then he just goes, hey, you know, Bass Bass versus bursary basic just told them to shut up. Said you being a drunk asshole. Nobody wants to talk to you. All right, just shut the fuck up. And all I'm thinking is I have my sneakers off and I five to fucking pull these guys apart. I got to run in my socks on a bus

Speaker 3:          00:51:48       that, that verse, he couldn't have handled. This guy's guy was just a drunk idiot. But anyways, uh, and then the guy turns around and faces front, like he's been scolded and he shut up and I'm like, thank God. And we found out afterwards, people around us were like, thank God you said that Shit. But then I don't know what happened. Then he just started back up again. And one of my other friends started talking to the guy and then he started going again, you know, I'd suck a dick. Hey, would you fuck blah, blah, blah, blah. He was a fucking moron. Tell you what I need. I need a loose horn, some Mexican food. These are direct quotes and I'm telling you there's these two, all this cute old couple, like two seats in front of them. It was, it was an absolute fucking shit show, and by the time we get off the bus, it's like, I don't even want to, I don't even want to go to the fight.

Speaker 3:          00:52:48       I'm so over people at this point. But in, and of course we get back late. We can't find where we, where we were staying at the Sheraton or whatever. We finally get back to the Sheridan. We go up, don't even shower, just put on some remotely respectable fucking clothes. And we run downstairs to catch the shuttle where we're going to go see the fight is like 11 miles away in the shuttle will only go in a five mile radius. So He'd go, fuck our, I call a cab, call a cab. The guy calls a cab, never calls comes, he calls another cab. It never fucking comes. And at that point, I'm looking over at the bar, the hotel bar, and they're serving food. And I just say, it's four of us. I say one of the guys that go, look, I go, I'm done man.

Speaker 3:          00:53:32       I'm just going to get a case of d and go to bed. Just fuck it. So version and the other dude, uh, looking at like, what the fuck? Come on. We gotta make this happen. And then the other guy, I just don't name names in the podcast, the hall of famous friends. It's like, yeah, dude, that's what I'm doing. So we go saddle up to the bar and it was fucking hilarious. We're sitting at the bar now we're done. Our Day's done, which is going to get something to eat, maybe get a drink and we're going to go upstairs and go to fucking sleep. But if we, if we look to the right, we see the TV with the highlights and the score is, but if you look to the left, we can see into the lobby and I see [inaudible] and my other buddy, and they are still in the anxiety of trying to get to the fight.

Speaker 3:          00:54:15       So I say to the dude, I'm sitting at the bar with, I go, you know what's funny that over there, and I was pointing Diversey in the lobby is going to become way more entertaining than this shit on the TV. And about five minutes and sure enough, four as he starts flipping out, I swear to God, he must've said Sheridan like 58 fucking times. He just kept calling like, well, we're at a Sheridan. How can you not get a cap? And it, and it shed is a Sheridan. This is, this is a shower. I don't understand this. How do you not get a Cabinet Sheridan? Right. And then he walks over to the bar and he's leaning in between me and the other dude just go and ask. I just don't understand where we're at. A Sheraton right? He's drunk. So that's sitting there and they walked back and forth like 58 times trying to get the guy at the front desk to get a cab. That'll show up, but for some reason they're not showing up. It's a fine. And then I'm like, Paul, just just fuck it to wrap. Sit down and get some food. He goes, no, fuck that. Fuck that. This is one of the best fights of the year and I'm going to miss it. I want to see it live. I want to see like I just never been at a shower where you couldn't get a cab.

Speaker 3:          00:55:27       So now the cab doesn't show up. 20 fucking minutes later, whatever. We got a couple of drinks in front of us and my fucking burger shows up with the French fries. I got a coke. The other guy's got an, I don't know whether he had a salad with some chicken Assam Shit and fuzzy at this point. He's like, invading my space. He's literally becoming like that jerk off on the bus. I'd suck a dick. Except he's going where to Sharon? How do you not get a cabinet at Sheridan? And he's fucking leaning on the bar and all that. My food finally comes in before the plate even hits the fucking bar. He goes, Hey, can I get one of those French fries? And I looked at him and I was so fed up with people. I looked at him, I said, you know what? No, no you can't.

Speaker 3:          00:56:11       And then the lady goes, the kitchen closes in five minutes. I go, Paul, just order a cheeseburger. He goes, no, I'm going to this fight. And then he sits down on the other side of the guy who just looks at me. He goes, you know what? That was fucked up. That was fucked. What you just did there, right? Because if I buy it some French fries, you want to have to ask me. I in mind grabbing like two huge handfuls. I go here, I'd go here, take this, take this, and I'm like, fuzzy. You would lean an I for, I don't lean over people's food. How to fucking, you're not getting a cabinet at Sheridan.

Speaker 3:          00:56:47       So finally I look at them and I just go, you guys realize you have a rental car sitting out there in the parking lot. I don't know if you're too drunk to drive, but if you're not drunk enough to drive the fight as it start enough, just go jump in the car and drive down the fucking street. So they go fine. That's the plan. So the other guy goes up to look for the keys. He's up there for like 20 minutes and I'm polishing off the Burger in Versie is telling me that he, you know what a piece of shit friend I am. And at one point I go, Paul, I didn't look you like an athlete who doesn't know when to end his career. It's over. We're not going to see the fight. It's fucking over. You know? So then he tries to order a fucking cheeseburger and by then the kitchen's closed.

Speaker 3:          00:57:32       Then they find another place that's within five miles that they can see the fight. So they run up to the front desk and they go, Oh, the guy drives a shuttle. Just went home and fuzzy is fucking losing his mind. And uh, that guy upstairs could not find his keys to the rental car though it was a shit show. It was one of the most, it was almost as entertaining as the game watching those two guys trying to get to the fight. And uh, they finally find that, oh, the guy I was sitting with had to go up and find the fucking keys. He finds the keys

Speaker 3:          00:58:06       and then they decide they're going to jump in the rental car to go watch the last half of the fight. And they like you share you to want to go. And I'm like, dude, I am paying for this and I'm going to go upstairs and I'm fucking going to sleep. And uh, and that's exactly what I do. I go upstairs, me and the other dude, we go upstairs and we're just laughing our asses off and those two fucking guys jumping a car to go find this fight in like a Dave and busters or whatever. So whatever, they went to some ESPN zone place and they go there and they don't have the fight. So the whole thing was a fucking wash. I'm laying in bed, right just about ready to fall asleep. Just laughing my ass off and just think what a great game it was. What a wonderful drive. It wasn't all that stuff. Right. What a great weekend. And all of a sudden my phone buzzes and I get this picture and the underneath it, it says pussies and I fucking look at the picture and it's a picture of Paul Versey with a Mug of beer. You can't even see his face. He's sucking it down.

Speaker 3:          00:59:12       And I laughed and I just texted him back, don't get arrested cause I'm gonna have to get out, basically fucking bail you out. And then he fell asleep. I fall and like three hours later.

Speaker 4:          00:59:25       Okay.

Speaker 3:          00:59:25       I think I started dreaming about chainsaws out of nowhere. And then I fucking wake up and vs in the bed next to me, he's in the other twin there and he is fucking snoring at an Olympic level. So I'm waiting on forsee frozen anything.

Speaker 4:          00:59:46       Okay.

Speaker 3:          00:59:47       Yeah.

Speaker 4:          00:59:49       Okay.

Speaker 3:          00:59:49       Like, like that. And I'm just like, firstly, I'm fucking kicking the bed and he's with ha ha ha. And I'm like, dude, don't just snoring. Oh, sorry. Sorry. All right. And then two seconds later, like immediately would fall back to sleep and sound like, I dunno, like someone was choking a fucking wart hog. So,

Speaker 4:          01:00:13       okay,

Speaker 3:          01:00:13       I'm sitting over there, I'm making like a pillow sandwich with my fucking head trying to block them out. And uh, he swears that he heard me yell, motherfucker. I don't remember saying that, but I kept falling asleep and then waking back up to this fucking jackass. I Emilia, have sympathy for every housewife out there if your husband snores like that. Right? So I fucking, I went into my bag and I got earplugs out that I wear on the plane or whatever. Jan, those things in there. And then, you know, there's like four pillars to a bed, had two on one side, two on the other. And I, you know, it's, in fact, it was possible to put myself in a headlock. I would have to try and block my ears and uh, I was hilarious. Woke up the next day when I woke up in the morning, he was already gone and get an early flight. And at that point, of course we were laughing about the French fry. He's still pissed. He's still pissed on some level is questioning my level of loyalty to him. Um, and I don't give a shit. All right? That's the deal. I would never, if you're listening to this, Paul, I would never hover over your fucking food and I would never ask you for any of your fucking food before you've had a chance to get byte number one. Okay? There's this, there's etiquette.

Speaker 3:          01:01:23       There's etiquette. You don't show up to picture, all right? You don't sit on somebody else's motorcycle. Y'all play somebody else's drums without asking them. There's all kinds of stuff. All right? You don't tell some you don't. You don't criticize about waste. So many parents that are on kid. You don't do that. And for the, and you don't fucking take somebody French fry. You fucking do that before the plate even hits. How dare you? How dare you Paul Versey you weren't raised right. All right. I fucking stand by that in any way with a piece of shit out there that defends him. You know what? Go eat with versa. You're not welcomed at my table. All right, here we go.

I got to do a few episodes of that and, but they also shot one of my favorite movies of all time, no country for old men. And I want to drive around and look at some of those shooting locations like the motel with a shoot brought or they killed Josh Brolin and all of that type of stuff. Um, I am converted. I the southwest, all of that stuff is some of the most beautiful scenery you can ever see right up through Colorado, Wyoming, Montana, all those places they fucking make fun of man. I'm telling you, they unbelievable. Um, and my apologies to that guy.

Speaker 1:          01:05:29       I'm going to try and get his email from my, uh, the guy who helps me with my podcast. I get to try to smooth shit over with him cause I feel bad about that. Um, all right, here we go. Let's read some stuff. All right. Character assassination. Hello billion. I'm a freshman in the university over in England and everything is good in the world apart from one small annoyance. I have just gotten in from a night out on the time I had just got in from a night on the town and it's 7:00 AM I experienced something that I feel I need to ask you about and I had loved the advice you give and I love the advice you give, so feel and so feel you're the best person to ask. All right, granted you're hammered. You're writing this at seven in the morning. Okay. Um, I've been at the university for five days and everyone is getting on really well.

Speaker 1:          01:06:12       I have been the guy that cracks the jokes and make sure everyone is included and make sure everyone comes out to drink every night. This evening I'm a new guy, moved into my flat and immediately the group dynamic changed. He seemed to be very sure of himself and it felt as though he believed he was better than us. He constantly made remarks about the lack of girls in the group and at a general air of complacency. Uh, to put a long story short, he tried to humiliate me in front of everyone. He made me feel little by making a big deal out of a remark. I made sarcastically. I said that I had a cousin who is quite attractive. I was clearly joking, but he made it his mission to say it was incest you with. And because I'm from Wales, he suggested that I have sexual intercourse with sheep. Oh, you guys are the ones who get that out there. I'm a well known Welsh stereotype, but is potentially true. He wrote with a Little Smiley wink face. Um, I sensed that the entire room knew I was joking and found it strange that he made such a big deal out of it. But due to is highly confident, almost cocky personality. They were scared to argue with with, well, you got to nip that in the butt.

Speaker 1:          01:07:21       Yeah, you got it. You got to step to that guy immediately be like, dude, it's just a joke. Why do you keep talking about it? Do you secretly want to fuck his sheep? So you're trying to put it on me cause you dick gets a little hard as you talking about it. You fucking Weirdo. Just so you've got it. You got to come at that guy. You know, you don't have to do like dough. You shade it again. I'll fucking Yaki teeth down your fucking throat. You don't have to go there yet. You don't have to. All right. Anyways, let's, let's, let's, let's move on here. Uh, they sense the entire room, but Blahblahblahblahblah I explained myself for several minutes and he continued to make a big deal out of nothing and I feel most of the room agreed with me. Yeah. You, you were giving them

Speaker 1:          01:08:04       like to a guy like that, that's a sign of weakness. A few to keep explaining where he goes. Nah, I take you want to fuck a sheet? No, no. It was a Joe. No, I was just, I thought I died it at, I said, you are right. Spider. He become a spider here. You can't do that. Um, I felt like the best course of action was to punch him as hard as I could in the face. Ah, all right. I like that. Good move. I resisted the urge to punch him and have removed myself from the situation and as I have a feeling that the best way to deal with shitty peoples to avoid them while depends on wolf. Avoiding him means not hanging out with the friends that you're making. You have to address it now. You don't need to punch him in the face.

Speaker 1:          01:08:41       So I'm just joking. Uh, the problem was that most of the room came with me as they felt I was in the right, thus isolating him on his first night. This is not what I wanted to happen, dude. You got to stop being a people pleaser. He's been a continent. Needs to sit there and think about it. Um, he said this is not what I want it to happen as the first night in universities, the hardest. And I didn't want to be the cause of his lonesomeness even though it was somewhat self inflicted, somewhat in self-inflating was totally self inflicted. Sir He go, this made him dislike me more and as we left to go out drinking in the nightclubs, he came up to me and locked me in the eyes and said, I hate you. Yeah, this guy is just an insecure can't he goes, I did not handle it as I was not set out to make enemies and he seemed to want to hate me.

Speaker 2:          01:09:30       Yup.

Speaker 1:          01:09:31       I just say, all right, well cool. All right, well we got, we got that over quick. Enjoy your time at the university. We don't have to be friends. Have a nice evening.

Speaker 1:          01:09:40       Yeah. He goes, I feel like I've tried to be nice, but he has beef with me. Don't be nice to this guy. Fuck this guy. He goes, my question for you is, would you have left the room when the guy tried to humiliate you or would punching him be the best option? All right. At this age I wouldn't have left the room and I would have given him shit and I wouldn't have punched him in the face. At your age. I probably would have let them roll all over me, bully me, and then would have for some reason become friends with them and let them treat me like shit for the next five years in my fucking life. That's what I would've done at your edge. So, um,

Speaker 1:          01:10:14       pet space at work, you shouldn't avoid this guy. He shouldn't take any shift from this guy. This guy has got a lot of issues. He probably has a bad father or home situation and he's basically in the beginnings of going out into the world and taking out his childhood and other people. So the only way he can do that to you is if you allow him to, uh, you don't need to be friends with someone like that. But what you do need to do is you need to draw a line in. That guy has to respect the fact that he can't get out of line with you. All right? So if it comes up and says, I hate you, just be like, hey, you know, well, you know, it's not going to do about that. Have a nice evening. And he said, yeah, I really fucking hate you. And just be like, listen, dude, do you have a problem? Is there something, you know, if you're going to do something, do what the fuck you feel you need to do or get the fuck out of my face and just leave it at that because he's not going to throw a punch and it comes up and says, I hate you. It sounds like a fucking seventh grader. And it sounds like you have it in you to punch somebody in the face. Uh, so you know, and if, and if you already know that about yourself, you don't

Speaker 3:          01:11:13       have to prove it again. So don't, don't go with violence, man. That's just, that's stupid advice just when it comes up and says, hey, you just be like, yeah, all right. It's not an I could do about it. It's unfortunate. I wish it wouldn't happen, you know? I mean, I don't, I don't know what he wants out of you, but, uh,

Speaker 1:          01:11:35       the biggest thing that I've gotten from this, cause I can't tell you what to do because I'd have to know a lot more about the situation as to how to handle that guy. But the biggest thing I got out of this is your need to try and make things better and be a people pleaser with someone who doesn't deserve that. You sound like a really nice guy.

Speaker 3:          01:11:51       All right? And you know what happens to nice guys? They attract assholes because people who don't tolerate assholes, they can't get in there. So some of the biggest countries in the world hang out with some of the nicest fucking people in the world who don't know how to stick up for themselves in certain situations. So this is what I've told a couple people in my life may make somebody earned. How nice a person you are. Don't just be giving it away and just being nice to everybody. Uh, this guy hasn't earned it, so fuck him. All right. Fuck that guy. Don't take any shit from him. And, uh, but don't, don't let them, don't allow that guy to make you mad. Yeah. And then you throw a punch and then you've got issues at school. Cause this guy's a cunt. He had a bad dad. Fuck that. Fuck that. If it comes up and says he hates you again, just be like, dude, I got it. You already said that. I understand you don't like me. So get out of my face and get on with not liking me. All right. If you really didn't like me, you wouldn't be coming up to me. So why don't you prove to me how much you don't like to me. Don't listen. When I say everything I say will, it always escalates into a fucking rolling around on the floor kind of thing. I hope something in there helped you. Um, all right, Hiroshima and documentary to checkout. Dear Billy von Reddington bill, I ain't, I'm American

Speaker 1:          01:13:07       good living in Hiroshima teaching English. It's a great gig where I get to meet a lot of the locals and teach them how to pronounce things the way we do. My Dad was in the army, so I grew up learning a lot about American history, especially military history since it was such a big part of our lives. Being in a military family and all, I'm a huge fan, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. He writes and I am happy to hear that you are getting into world war history in a big way. Uh, the last few weeks in the man podcasts have almost been weird as you are discovering a lot of the same things I did about our past and about how the modern world came to be when I was a kid. World War II aviation, especially in this Pacific had a profound effect on me and the book fly boys was the first time I ever read about, uh, about shit going down in the Philippines and how we got all these oversee territories in Puerto Rico and Guam and all of that.

Speaker 1:          01:13:54       Before that I was just bought into believing that we were the good guys and everyone else was to blame for everything wrong in the world. Also, I have to agree with the last person who wrote in that the Dan Carlin podcast, ghost of the oss front. I got to listen to that. Asked front, O, s, t, F, R, O, n, t, everybody, Carlin spelt the same as George Carlin, c a. R. L. I, N, ghosts of the OSS to front O. S. T. F. R. O. N. T. All one word from the hardcore history was life changing. The fucking Russians lost between 20 and 40 million people and many of those were civilians. We lost a half million in the whole war. Uh, there is a saying that World War II was one with Berlin, British intelligence, American steel and Russian blood. Wow, man. Jesus Christ. That's a sacrifice and a half, huh? Understatement of the year. I got to listen to that. This could not be more true, you saying about that expression after the war when we went to rebuilding western Europe and the Russians basically occupied everything to make sure this shit never happened again.

Speaker 2:          01:14:58       MMM.

Speaker 1:          01:15:00       Oh, me read that sentence in a better way. After the war, we went to rebuilding western Europe and the Russians basically occupied everything to make sure that this should never happen again. All right, now the cold, now the Cold War from the Russian side makes total sense to me and I think it will to UFT listened to the podcast and also, I know you mentioned that you hate ancient shit before cowboys and Indians, but you have to check out the podcast also from Dan Carlin called death throes of the Roman republic. I'll do it. I'll listen. If someone's going to tell me about it, I can listen to anything but to sit down and read it. My brain doesn't work like that. It just goes, why don't we go get a beer man? Why are we reading all this heavy stuff? Man. Ancient Rome, you see used to be a democracy before the Roman empire and it faced a lot of the same problems.

Speaker 1:          01:15:45       Jesus Christ rail. We actually learning things here. My God. All right, stay with me people. I got a little more to read here. Um, ancient Rome used to be a democracy before it became a Roman empire, and it faces a lot of the same problems we face today before it ultimately became an empire rather than a democracy. Oh Jesus, that sounds familiar. You see, there were two groups in ancient Rome that basically ran shit. The public caneys. I hope I said that right. Who were rich and conservative. And the popularity is the populist who sought power through gaining the support of the poor. Oh my God. So basically this is their Fox News and CNN, and ultimately it was this struggle that led to the imperial Rome. Check it out. Uh, last one here. You need to check out fog of war. It's a documentary free on youtube that won the Oscar back in 2004.

Speaker 1:          01:16:35       I think it's about Robert S. Dot. Mcnamara, who was most famous for being secretary of defense during the Cuban missile crisis in Vietnam. Before all that, he was a statistician and World War II. He was one of the guys who crunched the numbers to see how much destruction could be caused by daylight bombing in Germany. And later in Japan and this documentary, he points out that by fire pump firebombing Japan, we killed more civilians in Tokyo in one night than we did in the bombing of Hiroshima. And that's also amazing when you read the that fly boys book is you just realized that

Speaker 2:          01:17:06       okay.

Speaker 1:          01:17:07       You know, cause I always learned that we were trying to our dominance, that's why we ended up dropping the bombs that we didn't need to. But like when you see how their people were taught that we were devils had tails, had green blood and we were going to eat them if we won. And when we approached the civilians they would throw their babies off cliffs and jump off to that. I mean we were going to have to lose way more people. I don't know. There's an argument for both sides. It's, it's nuts. It's crazy and it's nuts that there's actually rules and war and that it's somehow legal. Um, anyways, the bomb looms still to this day and the town of Hiroshima and there is an overwhelming belief that it should not have been used no matter what. Yeah, of course. Absolutely. You think that they would think that, you know, and over here we were like, well, you know, you're going to lose a lot of guys.

Speaker 1:          01:17:53       Um, but here they seem to to miss a few things. First of all, a land invasion would have resulted in a million more Japanese dead since they would not surrender and were told that the Americans would eat them and their families. Yeah, we read the same book. Second, if we had blockaded the island rather than invade or drop the, the a bond, millions would have starved to death. Last of all, and most often overlooked is if the allies had invaded Japan, then Russia would have invaded too. And just like in Europe, we would've given a large part of Japan to Russia to rule over. So northern Japan could have been like North Korea if we had dropped the bombs. I'm not a hippie and I'm not writing from some idea that America is evil and our enemies did nothing wrong. But it is amazing to see how much was going on from all sides, good in bed.

Speaker 1:          01:18:37       And it gives a richer, fuller version of what actually was going on all of the world at the time. Exactly. That's why I loved reading that book. I like, you know, that's why got, I like listening to people trash the Patriots. How, what is your viewpoint of this? How do you look at it? You know, you got to listen to some of that. Right. Anyways, love the podcast. Come to Hiroshima to the bomb museums sometimes for a pretty sobering history. Keep Up. Oh, I'll definitely do that someday. Keep it up. And most of all go fuck yourself. All right. It's probably the most intelligent thing has ever been uttered. Of course, it was written by somebody else. All right. I'm plowing through all of this people. We got a couple more to go. Um, Henry Kissinger, dear Billy Westwinds, uh, oh, Billy West, the great a voiceover guy.

Speaker 1:          01:19:20       One of the voices of Ren and Stimpy. I mean, he might have done both, right. Steepy ETF. You don't deserve to live. I'm sorry. Terrible impression. Um, do you know how Evil Kissinger is? The man is a war criminal. Uh, he carpet bombed Cambodia, oversaw the coup in Chile that practically destroyed, destroyed their great nation, jacked off to the dropping of agent orange all over Vietnam. Okay. This is very slanderous, sir. He's pure evil. He's a Zionist who believes in ethnic cleansing, cleansing and has gone on record promoting policy that promote d population, not the, hey everyone. Hey, everyone's cool. What not the hey everyone cool it on the fucking deep population. More like, let's get guys to fight those guys. Both sides will have civilians die and go hungry. I think you've left out some words in that. Um, he goes, I'm Jewish. I love juice. The good ones.

Speaker 1:          01:20:19       I love all people no matter their religion. I've been to Israel and believe it is a beautiful and moving place, but the state of Israel is pure evil, not the people, the government. My father worked for a company that did business with the Israeli government. That's all I can say about his business, but I can say that he was privy to some insane things. The types of things that make you lose sleep. The main objective in almost all policy he saw was to create money and wealth for a few families, for the few families that run Israel. True Judaism and love for the religion is almost obsolete when you get high enough in power. Yeah, that's kind of true everywhere kind of all goes out the window. Um, when she gets to that eyes wide shut level, uh, they heads of the state used Judaism as a way of silencing anyone who questions their actions where we use support the troops, call someone to antisemites and see how quickly they shut up a college.

Speaker 1:          01:21:14       You and anti Zionist and it's the same thing. They shut up. US Jews have suffered, but so have lots of people who can't be quantified into that group. Anyways. Fuck Kissinger. All right, well I guess I have some reading up on to do on that. Uh, that's one man's opinion, but I mean it just, it doesn't, it all just what you start reading about it all just seems to be the same story over and over again because we really are all the same. And I think that like, you know, once you go beyond a certain level power, I think there's maybe a handful of people in the world that can handle it and the rest of us start to feel like we're godlike. And uh, we start summoning people to come in and give us blow jobs and drinking wine out of some JAKKS bladder, whatever the file over the fuck they did that.

Speaker 1:          01:22:02       That's disgusting. Um, all right, last but not least, I probably shouldn't fucker. Uh, hey there could QB, the freckle faced kid. Hey, how cool was it last week where they gave my character a first name? I don't want to ruin anything, but I was sitting there on pins and needles watching that stuff. And by the way, if you're up to date, I'm not going to ruin anything on breaking bad, but, uh, I'm asking this people outside the United States because I don't know of any United States show that has ever been better than breaking bad. Um, my stomach has been an absolute Nazi watching the show and each week it just keeps getting ratcheted higher and higher. Like last night's episode was like one of the most disturbing things I've ever seen. And if you live in another country, okay. And you know, have a show. If you've watched all of breaking bad and you know, have a show that you think is on par or dare I say better, I want to know what it is and I don't care if there's no subtitles, I will sit down and just

Speaker 3:          01:23:05       view it because what they've done with the second half of this fifth season, I've, I've never seen anything like it in my 40 years of sitting in front of the idiot box. I could actually say it's not an idiot box anymore. When this something like that on TV, it's just unbelievable. And if you're late to the party, by all means, when all five seasons come out, you, you owe it to yourself to download them by him and don't blow through them. Okay. It's a fine wine. Open a bottle at night, sit there with your friends and discuss it. Um, it's incredible. I mean, a lot of the stuff that we're talking about as far as people handling power, you know, it's, it's unreal. It's unfucking believable. Anyways, last one. Here we go. I want a lot of people have asked me about the Saul, uh, you know, Saul Goodman spinoff. Um, I know as much as you guys know, I just heard it. I heard it. It's not, it's going to be a prequel. So if it's a Prequel, I would feel that that's years before, I dunno if he gets to Albuquerque and people have been asking if I'm going to be on it. I have no idea. I hope so. I have no idea. But whether I am or whether I'm not, I'm watching every episode.

Speaker 3:          01:24:27       Um, anyway, it was a prequel. Shouldn't I come in at like the very last one? And then we all moved to Albuquerque. See that right there. That's why I don't write ups. Terrible idea. Sorry. Anyways, I probably shouldn't. Fucker is the last one here. Hey, there could be the freckle face. I need some help. So there's this crazy broad, it might job who's I'm, who I'm 99% sure I could fuck if I asked directly. Uh, now I feel free to, now I feel free to think this because she isn't exactly top shelf trim, but she certainly worth trying a shot if it's free. Um, I got to tell you, do this. That's one of the biggest lies in the universe. It's never free. There's never been a free, there's never been a free piece ever did the history. It all comes with a price all and all does.

Speaker 3:          01:25:23       Especially when you're trying to bank somebody you're working with right there. You're shitting where you're eating and you take that could go very bad very quickly. Uh, he goes, I've worked with her for about two years and for awhile she was putting on what seemed to be a pretty strong press, excessive hanging out at my desk, finding random ways to mess with me, laughing at anything I do, you know, office flirty, bullshit. Well, maybe she likes you. She might actually like you see, this is the way guy looks at. She was the suck my Dick, right? So she's going to be sitting there thinking you're making love and you're like, ah, good cum in your mouth. Right. And then you treat her like I'm telling you, that's how shit starts. So anyways, then I launched a passive attempt to smash, told her we should get drinks. Oh no dude. Just the way you talk about women in the, which is hilarious coming from me, but the way and totally hypocritical, the way you talk about women like this, this is not going to end well. I told her we should get drinks. We went out to catch a movie after work but didn't make a major move because of fear of her having a story to tell the office about rejecting me. Very smart. Nothing happened and things cooled way off.

Speaker 3:          01:26:42       Uh, long story short, since then she's exhibited advanced signs of female dementia. Well, before I go any further, I'm going to guess that because you, you didn't make a move. She thought that, oh, he went out to see what kind of a person I am and was expecting maybe a follow up date and when it didn't happen, that's sending her the signal that you didn't, you didn't like something about her. So maybe now that's why she's distant. I don't know. He said the worst one being an incident where she invited me to hang out with her and I taught her how to rip a bond.

Speaker 2:          01:27:17       Yeah,

Speaker 3:          01:27:17       it's all right. This one is a wholly different direction. Totally different direction. She got unreasonably high and wound up locking herself in the bathroom, calling her mom. Just say how she invited me over God high and was worried I was going to take advantage of her. Her mom was about to call the cops, but she did stop her. For what it's worth, I'm six five 200 pound black guy and she's a small Asian girl. So I really saw Ben into that storyline. Oh Jesus Christ. Absolutely. So we are now back to normal with her being a 200 proof bottle of crazy and me wondering if the crazy too good pussy positive correlation holds true. That's fucking hilarious. If I figure she can't get any crazier in, if I just ask directly, we can eliminate the chance of confusion and calls to the police. Am I totally insane for still wanting to fuck this girl? Thanks and go fuck yourself bitch. Um, all right. I hope there's women listening to this cause right now because you don't have a dick. You probably, and this is why you think guys are so dumb and I want you the same way this guy was talking about World War II from the other perspective. You got to look at having a Dick from the other perspective with, I swear to God, empathy and I'm going to pause while you roll your eyes ladies. But this is how powerful

Speaker 3:          01:28:48       having a Dick is. This is how much it runs your life. Like the amount of shit.

Speaker 2:          01:28:54       Yeah,

Speaker 3:          01:28:55       that just got shot across the bow of this guy's Dick. Okay. And he's still thinking like, I think I can make it.

Speaker 1:          01:29:02       What if I just said, hey, you want to fuck and we just fucked. I could somehow get this urge out of me and then I could then go back to work. You know what's funny, sir, is the fact that if you fuck this girl and if it is as good as you think it's going to be like you're going to be able to go back, you know to work and where you're never going to bang again. You already know that this girl is fucking nuts. All right? I'm removed from the situation. I haven't seen her so I don't have any desire for you. I could tell you 100 fucking percent do not repeat. Do not. Fuck this girl. Stand down, sir. Abort. What other of the other military rub one out before you go to work.

Speaker 4:          01:29:48       Okay,

Speaker 1:          01:29:50       go out. You know what? Go out and find some other crazy fucking woman that you don't have to see at work.

Speaker 4:          01:29:58       Okay, that's it.

Speaker 1:          01:30:02       That's it. All right. Do not do it. Yay. You're not totally insane for fucking this woman. If he didn't have a Dick, you would be, but you do have a dick. So I understand cause God knows I've made neverending mistakes with my Dick. Trust me. All right. And by the time you figure out your Dick, women don't want to fuck anymore anyways, so it's pointless. So I'm trying to fucking fast 40th to where the hell I'm at. Hour and 30 minute podcasts.
