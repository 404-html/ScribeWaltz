Speaker 1:          00:00          All right. Hey, what's going on? It's bill burr and this is once again time for a very special Monday morning podcast. A, you got an extra one this week. And as always, whenever I do that, you know, it's not just going to be me running my mouth. I always have a great guest and this time is no exception. Uh, please welcome for the multitalented, the multi a business owning a from a entourage. Jerry Ferrara, man, I don't think there's any way I could live up to that incident. He talks about the game. You'll one of the guys that like, uh, when I found out you won't you at will co owner of that fat Soule yeah. Uh, which is as great a sandwich place out here. Um, one I found out that you were one of the co owners. I was telling my wife, I'm like, see, that's what most artists don't do.

Speaker 1:          00:44          They have all their eggs in one basket. I love the fact that you're making money outside of this fucked up business. So I joke with my brother all the time and it's like I hope one day when I'm in my sixties you look back like you know acting was great, we did great, but you know what, we really killed us sandwiches. That's how I, you know I ate there, I ate there. Cause the your slogan is that as soon as sounds in and underneath that it says we'll making sandwiches. Oh my God, the guy's of date when they hear it as the guys at fat Sal's are going to die. They had, they're proud of that slogan. No, I laugh when we, me and my wife saw, we laughed. We were like, we got to try that place. So of course I tried it out and it's awesome.

Speaker 1:          01:19          But I'm 46 so I can only eat there so often. The, I close my eyes when I drive past some filing, want to look at, cause it's on the way to the gym. So it's like I drive home, I got a pass and everyday I'm like you just worked out. Don't blow it. Yeah, it's on Fountain on Fountain. Then you've got the big flat screen TVs or he's got the game on. It's, it's unreal. It's like a, for someone like me that's literally a moth going to the light. But the reason your here is um, you actually, you have a new podcast coming out called a bad for bad for business. Yeah. It's a, it's three weeks old and hit as bad for business because I really don't know what the hell I'm doing. I've, I've, I didn't know, I didn't know what the Hell I've been listening to to you.

Speaker 1:          02:00          Obviously for awhile now and I've, I grew up listening to sports talk radio. I didn't have a TV in my room, so like a radio was all, I had stern, all those things. So I just have had an affinity for radio my whole life. Where did you grow up? Bensonhurst. Brooklyn. So, uh, all right. Oh God. What sport affiliations are you [inaudible] here we you want to know? Well, you know Nick's obviously no problem with that. We saw that the next Guy Yankees. Hey you, why you made the right choice. Could you say now though? You can't even really say anything anymore. What could you say you w what do you mean by that, Jerry? You're golden. You're good. Oh, I thought you were going to say that. We're doing exactly what the fuck you guys were doing with buying up everybody. I don't think so. I don't think so. Ah, Yankee we did. We didn't, uh Oh seven and look, the minute seven was a disgrace. The minute we gave Jacoby Ellsbury money, the it to me, it's over the rivalry's over the minute. It started with Damien a little bit like that was the Yankee sign. Damon. It kinda ruined the whole the whole day. Always go your way though. They never come our way there. We sell throughout my life. I'll be

Speaker 2:          03:00          back to guys like Bob Watson. There was always this guys, we let go and you guys always sign it, but I don't ever remember anybody. You know, even like an old Lou Pinella, we never got anybody but got the old Lou Panella or even like Mike Pack your rule. Rick Sarone. It was really an Indian like coming our way. We, it always seems like they always end up. Yeah. You might've got one guy, Andy Hawkins, who I remember the only Yankee, and I remember he used to buy the helmets. Carvel used to give an ice cream scoop and the little mini batting hell, I remember that. Yeah. And I used to watch the Yankee Games and I'd write on the sticker and I put the stats of the game on the back of a sticker. I still have this one helmet. Andy Hawkins threw a no hitter and lost to the Chicago White Sox. Five errors for walks.

Speaker 2:          03:42          They lost three nothing. He threw a no hitter. You were at that game? No, that wasn't that. I was watching with my law of Karma. I think it was on the road against the white sox. And I think Hawkins ended up being a red sock for like a half a season out of the bullpen. If that sounds like the kind of guy that we'd signed, he throws a no hitter and he's seen Lucille beliefs beliefs back then. At least back then we did. But um, I dunno, we're, we're, we're playing off. I've got to tell you that Johnny Damon went, that was, that was brutal. And even though I know he was the one in Kansas City and then he was in Oakland, Oakland, then we got them. So I understood there was just something about like, we finally beat you guys and that he was such like the poster child of our team.

Speaker 2:          04:20          And then just to watch him go get a shave and a haircut like the ring, like he was going over his parent's house. He went corporate almost. It's like was wild shy. He who had the, one of the better beards in hair on the red sox, like he had his beard was phenomenal and he had like seven rbis in that game. Seven you hit the Grand Slam. Yeah, yeah, like seventh grade. So yeah, that ruined it for me. Like that really hurt the red sock. Yankee rivalry. Like I, to me it I, my fondest memory, the ending would be like Pedro Martinez throwing Don Zimmer on the ground. That was the word that it was that for me growing up, that was the height. That was the height. Did that piss you off when that happened or did you want to, it made me so angry and then let me ask you this Jerry.

Speaker 2:          05:01          What? What the fuck was he supposed to do? He's got this old guy running at him. Alright, he's got, these are his options. Know when either he runs away from an old guy. Okay, that's one. Two, he punches him in the face. Can't do that. Can Not 10 not through that or you gently take them by the side of his head. I feel bad now because he just passed away. I know I didn't. He just sort of guide them to the ground. That's what he did. I paid on Monday. He was in a no win situation. There's no way on earth. He comes out of that where it's like page or you did the right thing. He had no shot. He was the minute Zimmer planted his feet and charged Pedro Martinez was in trouble. Still was not a a what's in it was not a good mom. So then football where you're going to football giants, giants, congratulate giants. I remember the greatest day of my life was when the giants beat the nine, as in the NFC championship game, the Leonard Marshall sack knocked Montana out giants when and how much and in his career. And then my uncle took me to see home alone in the movie theater. Greatest Day of my childhood.

Speaker 1:          06:04          Do you know Paul Versey? You got to meet him. You guys. He opens for me. A lot of guys. I definitely see. I definitely know I'd, I'd definitely know him. You like Paul Versey with hair? I just did that for him. If he's listening. Um, uh, you know what's funny, like back in the day, uh, when entourage was first coming off of people who don't know, uh, Jerry by, by name, uh, he played turtle on entourage. Do you know I actually auditioned for that? Did you rip that turtle? That's, yeah, that's how wide the casting net was before they were throwing darts. Yeah. No, and they got you a totally made sense. But, um, yeah, I was, you know, not like I'm good now, but I was really bad at auditioning back then. And that was, that was, it was a memorable, awful one. I can't remember cause it was so bad or because the show went on to be a hit. So there was like the first season and a half, I'm watching it going like God every time they'd say your character's name and be like, I would just sort of think about that bad audition going out. I haven't been back. I have not been back since. But uh, what's the deal with that man? I got inflammation here that maybe there's going to be a movie.

Speaker 2:          07:07          No, no, we just, we just wrapped a movie a month ago. We actually had to postpone shooting Kevin Connolly, one of the guys who plays Eric on the shell, broke his leg while we were shooting, doing what? I was kind of applied of it. Uh, I've actually now told the story a few times, but it was a party scene at the beach. And, uh, we had a cameo from Russell Wilson, so, and I knew, I knew this was going to happen. They wanted to do a little montage of us, you know, playing a little tackle football on the beach. And I begged, they said, let's figure out what we're going to do. Let's block it out a little bit worse thing to do to, to competitive below average athletically. Guys see competitive day. Oh yeah. Him and I is to say, Hey, let's just turn the camera on and see what happens.

Speaker 2:          07:47          And sure enough, you know, I go out, he drills me, he goes out and attack on them. Like the third play. It was actually the most harmless. One of it all. I wrapped him up, he like tried to dive and extend the ball over the goal line and just his leg. But we broke a broken two places. Did you hear it? You heard it? Snap? I heard something weird. It wasn't like the Paul George awfulness. It was not that, thank God. But uh, I heard a little something. Did he, did he, he didn't know. He popped up and he thought he sprained his ankle. Russell Wilson came over and said like, you got the tie those laces tight. And uh, he worked for like two days. We're not knowing, just in, finally he tapped as a guys, I gotta go, I gotta go to a doctor and they x ray. Like you have a broken fricking late. He's in surgery the next day. What did he, which, which bone, fibula, fibula, surgeries, screws and everything. So we got to shut down from it, but the movie's done. And I actually just saw an early cut of it yesterday and it's, it's actually good. Oh, I'm really happy. I'm, I hate everything.

Speaker 1:          08:45          How do you deal with that man? Like, uh, like I said, the little stuff that I've done, I immediately realized how little, uh, just a little pow power you have if you're just a performer. Like I

Speaker 2:          08:55          always hear a lot on set. Like, yeah, it feels like it's going good. And then, then there's always that. Yeah, man, I hope to send comes together because you have no idea. Um, when you're doing it. And I think more like the director and the people who edit it, they have an idea of the direction it's going in. But like I feel like if you're just acting on it, you kind of in this vacuum where you're performing with the other people and just hoping you're giving them what they need. I got a few things to say about that one. I think it's like a game of opposites. Anytime I've been on a set or we have, whether it was like an episode of entourage or even a movie set of whatever it is, when everyone's like, God, this is great, this feels great, right? Everyone's killing it.

Speaker 2:          09:33          This is what bill is killing it. Jerry's kill. And then you watch it and it's Kinda eh. And then I've been on set where there's been times like, I don't want to have any idea of this shit's work is the weirdest shit we've ever done. I, I'm like cross your fingers and you watch it and it's the best. It's great. So you're not supposed to know. That's the thing that's kind of like in stand up the amount of time. A lot of times you feel like you're bombing, then you get off stage like God that sucks. And then your buddies out in the crowd going to people they would die laughing because some nights you just can't, you can't hear it. But I had an acting, I have like a, like I have total respect for uh, any working actor cause that just seems like the hardest, I don't know how you guys get to a point like how you get, you get altitude in that career because it's so fucking competitive.

Speaker 2:          10:17          Whereas like a comedian is difficult is starting out is once you like build a following, like say what have I went to an Improv and I sold some tickets. Like I don't have to re audition now that's it. At the next club it's like okay this guy sells tickets. So then you move up to this next level and just, you know, provided you keep getting better, you know, you, you, you, you have this thing and now you have this thing like say, you know, I go through you know, periods without getting any acting work, but I don't have to go back to waiting tables and, and, and all that type of stuff. Did you go through a, uh, did you have any like get something really big early and then that just that awful flatline for awhile. My story is interesting and I'll give you the quickest version possible, but you know, I saw how sick are you telling them?

Speaker 2:          10:59          No, no. Everyone know, a lot of people think like that. I, I kind of just showed up out here like some meathead from Brooklyn and like got cast Nataraj right away. It was, you know, four or five years. Now look, that's a short amount of time. It's very quick scheme. But Tourney, young and competitive, it felt like an eternity. And I, I lived in this and you know, in Burbank for 10 years I worked at every restaurant. How old high when you came out in 19 and I came out here, I did like three episodes of King of Queens. I'm like, I'm staying as I never left. So you were smart enough not to go to college? I did. I did my six months at a, at a college of Staten Island, a very nice community college back on the CSI. He saying that big student allow colleges, stupid Italians.

Speaker 2:          11:40          We used to say, oh, every kid who couldn't get into college, they are now the schools. It's actually a great community college. I shouldn't really talk shit. But um, I didn't have any great success. I would always, I would get an acting job that would maybe last a month. I'd make like seven, $8,000, which to me was a million. Oh yeah. And I quit whatever restaurant I where I'd live off that for as long as I can. And I just would go months without an acting job and they'd go beg for my waitering job back. And that was my cycle for quite a while. But even then, even though five years is quick too, it's pretty quick. But to go through that for five years. I mean this, this time, like you know what they talk about New York. If I could make it there, I can make it anywhere personally.

Speaker 2:          12:19          This town for me is just way, way more like it's brutal week. Yeah. And brutal. I always feel like New York, there's always like, there's an excitement to that city where out here, I don't know if it's just the topography, but this is like desolate out here and uh, that sun beating down on you. There's no change of season. It just feels like groundhog day. Just every hog day. Sunshine phone's not ringing. You know, I, and I can't get anywhere in my car when it's the, when it's great. It's the best town to ever live in. When it's bad. It's probably the worst ever, ever live in. And I always tell people I was not offended, but like I've got a couple of people in the last whatever year to be like, what's like the easiest? Well, how you get into acting, like what's the easiest way? I'm like the easiest way.

Speaker 2:          13:10          That's how you're going to add. You're going to pose the co there is no easy way and it's designed to make you quit. The whole system is designed to make you say, I can't do this anymore. I'm going home. It's made to make you say that. Well, let me ask you this, being also an, uh, a transplant from the east coast to you. Uh, do you miss these coast? Do you see yourself ever going back? Are you kind of settling in out here? I've had, I've had a couple of different trajectories with this. In the beginning I hated La, you know, meathead from Brooklyn. My accent was 10 times worse than it is now. Uh, then I guess as I got a little successful too, I got the hot, the whole good side of the town. The weather's great. I grew to love odes. Unbelievable.

Speaker 2:          13:54          It's, it's, it's great. You and I sitting here and you're getting an iced coffee with Ted's Cory. It's great. It's great. Recently though, and within the last year I've kind of gotten to the place where I'm 30, I'll be 35 soon. You know, my family's all still back there. My nieces and nephews are growing up now. They're like, you know, six years old. They're starting to get that age where I could do stuff with them. Like I say, maybe I don't need to be here 11 months, a year. Maybe it's, maybe it's nine and maybe I'd go to New York for two months. I'm starting to get to that point. Maybe I go spend some, some more quality time elsewhere. Maybe I don't need to, I'm built up enough where, look, if I really blow it at this point I'm going to have to have a serious, serious problem. Must to happen. Right. So maybe I go spend some time somewhere else. I'm at that point now it's research. I'm always jealous. Weird jealousy in New York guys. Cause you can go back to your hometown and the, and it's still a big industry town. You can't come on, give me a little, I go, I would go back to the suburbs of Boston now. I know that

Speaker 1:          14:52          they shoot some stuff up there, but it's just like if I went back there like, uh, like, you know, what I really miss most about living in Massachusetts is just going to a sporting event where I'm not in enemy territory. It's like I left in [inaudible] 95 I was in New York through the height of the curse of the paid. All of that has a bad run for you. Yeah, yeah. It was all of that. And, and, and Aaron Boone and Aaron Boone never took hold because the very next year like Aaron Boone probably, it definitely would have been worse than Bucky Dent had the next year not happen. Right. But what happened was they just sort of toward the bandaid off like, oh my God, that sucked down. We want it, thank God. But where the, the Bucky dent the bill Buckner thing. It just, it just, it just kept like, I'm a, I remember we were like, I was, I had a warehouse job and it was like two and a half years after the game and just one day in the middle of the summer, I was just sake shaking my head and my, my boss was, well, what's the matter? Like he thought the count was off when I had a little of this truck. I was just like, dude, I still can't believe we fucking lost that series.

Speaker 2:          15:50          And he laughed. The ultimate delayed, don't know. I mean I,

Speaker 1:          15:54          the reaction and all that, but just like years later you were just thinking about it. So it was so, uh, like, I mean, I imagined it as, as much as oh four would suck for a Yankee fan because of all that other success you've had and then you won one afterwards. It's bad, but it's not, it's not as like a like take like, you know, I guess, uh, I don't know. Cleveland fans or something like that where it's just like there's just no light has been no light.

Speaker 2:          16:21          That's blip. But now, now there's, there's not light, but at least there's a little hole, a glimmer of light as poke through it. Lebron and maybe Johnny Manzel. But yeah, it's been, I'm open. I hope he's going to be good. I wanted all, I'm, I'm a board. I think it's great. It's the new era and there's some dinosaurs that are going to hate on him for awhile. I think there's nothing.

Speaker 1:          16:42          No. What about his size and those guys? All those guys who run around, first of all, nobody's going to be faster and more elusive at the quarterback position then Mike Vick. So if, if, if he can get caught, he can get hurt. That's the only thing that I would worry about. But a, I'm actually a browns fan. Uh, I, I, my parents and some other relatives who lived in Ohio.

Speaker 2:          17:00          Oh. So you legitimately roof for the per my girlfriend's from Ohio and I just went there for the first time recently. And they are the most passionate fans, obviously Boston and New York too. I'm all Boston teams by the of the crowd. Couldn't believe

Speaker 1:          17:14          I liked the bronze cause my dad liked the browns. He grew up in Ohio and in Michigan, so every year is going to be there a year. So he went, he went to like all municipal stadium, saw Jim Brown play. That type of thing is amazing. So he uh, he's got this weird, I have this weird thing with him where he was a tigers in a Cleveland browns fan. So I have like, uh, an affinity for both of them and a little bit with the Redwings if they're fans weren't such dicks all the time talking all this shit. Granted they have all those cups, but um, so I'm actually, uh, I'm hoping that that he's going to, he's going to, he's going to do well.

Speaker 2:          17:46          One of my prize followers. Twitter. I'm not good on Twitter, but Johnny Manzel follows me and that was one of my prize follower. I'm, I'm most proud of of that follow, um, where we actually, me and my buddies when we went to go see him last year to amazing rise to Alabama when I was a fucking, it was a, it was just a to go to a browns game. I think I'm going to try to go October 12th. I think the plane is steel is, I just want to go Whitney. I just want to go see what that's all about. Those fans. I just can't believe how hard they show up in route and they haven't won more than five games and yeah, that they're maniacs out there that you would not want to walk out there with the other person's no jerseys. I'm going to go. Speaking of that, how do you feel about like, uh, attending sporting events out here in la?

Speaker 2:          18:34          I mean, I have, I personally, I've not had the best experience unless you show up wearing this shit, which I'm never going to do. I know I dress like a plain clothes cop when I go to the game. Same here. But like, they just take it way too fucking serious out here with is there's always a little bit of that. Uh, you might get stabbed the dodger games particularly, or chargers. Oh, and they just, shit I hear about like, do some guy got shot at a fucking 40 niners Raiders preseason. I've never gone to seasoned, get up to any north kitten nor cal supports. Like, I've never been to San Fran yet since I've lived here. Oh, okay. I've never been to oca. I need to go. I want to go experience it. The storied franchises they have. Great. Yeah, but you're not going into the black hole.

Speaker 2:          19:20          Lots of the Raider game wearing the charger. Jai wouldn't, I wouldn't do that. I wouldn't do that. Although like I, I think the, the rate of fence took a turn for the worst when they started dressing up like characters back in the day. The crowding characters. Yeah. The crowd. They all look like they were in a biker gang and they would like, legitimately scary. But now it's like, uh, I'm not saying like there's a lot of people in that stadium could fuck you up, but you got that around the leak. But, uh, until stupid characters man with the spikes coming out, they look like they should be going to comic con. They don't like the olive with the movie weird science when like the motorcycle gang comes in at the end, the CRAs department, they look like those. The guy that always struck me, I saw a one shot of a guy who looked just like one of the weird science biker guys at the end.

Speaker 2:          20:02          Jesus Christ. Or do you just took my, now I went back outside. I do. I've been watching a lot of the old movies. Um, well speaking of speaking of movies, um, dude, you're like insane shape right now and a, and I'm obviously, I asked you when you came in the second you walked in, I had down written down here that um, you just signed on to play two time world champ, Arturo Gotti in an untitled biopic, which I'm so site that they're making this a executive produced by Mark Walberg. And the second you came in, I was like, Eh, you already shooting the movie. You just see this training at this point I'm, I'm trained now and I'm kind of getting ready. I'm, I'm not in the full swing yet. Like we're actually going to go have a training camp. I'm going to go up to big bear and do that whole like 24 seven thing. No women. And they'll read it. I'm going to do my best. I personally don't, there's only a level of shred I can get. Like there's a on the mid drift re region, I'm Italian and from Ben also, I was born hundred five pounds. I, we may have to Cgi some shit with that. I Dunno. But uh, how tall are you? Five seven. If I have on good shoes.

Speaker 1:          21:02          And you were two oh five two oh four. And what, what is, what is the weight when you went to the doctor, why when you went to the document, you have to have fire and he says, listen, Jerry, I love the show. I'm not trying to be a dick, but you need to get down to what we were supposed to be.

Speaker 2:          21:15          I'm not like the normal for my height. Yeah. One the normal from my height's one 50 I thought that would be a win. What the 1950s one four five six and a half. He was like one 51 55 you'll be normal. And that's actually exactly how it happened. I went to take a physical to go do a movie where it's like the Hollywood physical and make sure you're not dying. They literally make sure your heart is beating and that you don't have any weird outward things. I do the blood pressures and they look in your ear like my mom could do that physical for me if she had to and the guy thought he was being real thorough and like this guy is looking for something to like fail me. And he put me on the scale and I just turned 30 it's like a week after my 30th birthday and you know the doctor wasn't trying to scam me.

Speaker 2:          21:56          He's just like, look, you're, you're not in any physical threatening life all during that. You're like, you're, you're young still, but you know what, as you get closer to 40, if you go on this path, you're going to be faced with some problems. So start now. It's way easier now than when you're going, when you're gonna be 39 frosting. And I just started and, uh, it's been four. I'm 30, I'm going to be 35 now and I'm, I'm at one 51. I'm in that range of, I guess, the proper way for my short ass. All right,

Speaker 1:          22:24          Galatians do. And how long did it take you to drop all that? Just, it's just nonsense. Still going on. It's been years and you're doing it the right way. You're gradually, uh, did you do it more diet or, or working out?

Speaker 2:          22:36          Both. Both. But I mean to, I, at the time I was still smoking cigarettes. Still a smoking pot still. I quit all that.

Speaker 1:          22:43          Yeah. And that shit, by the way, I'm 46, right around 40. Man. I'm telling you, like there's this weird thing where at 40, if you figured you started being a knucklehead around 18, 19, it does that tipping point where for more your life you will be in a moron. Then running around and riding your bicycle as a kid out and all of that shit that I'm telling you, it starts like the sh the weight just fucking shut down. And like, uh, all of a sudden, just some of the conversations I'm having with some of my friends, it's just a, it's, it's what, what I mean, unfortunately I never let it get too out of control. I'm about a buck 70 now. The worst I ever did. I went about 20 pounds and dude, it was all road. Fucking what? You were up to one 91 I was almost closed.

Speaker 1:          23:25          I was closing on one 90. And uh, this comic Keith Robinson, I'm not going to say the comics name that he called me, but he was a redhead who was fat and he called me him that day. And I, and it just, it, it, it was funny as hell, but it really stung me. And I was like, all right, I gotta go. Cause they're one of the running jokes on this podcast that I think fat shaming works. If you're in a, like I'm, I'm not trying to get in trouble and we can comment already bullshit. But it's just like I do that to myself. Like I'll be looking in the mirror when I'm just want to go look what you did, you piece of shit. And I just said nobody should love you. You know, just fucking, it gets me like I just, I just have an unacceptable wait. Like I'm not fucking going past this

Speaker 2:          24:08          buddy. I have a, I have a photo album in my phone that's like my, my workout photo album. It's all old photos. Right? That really a, I look at it and it's not even cause I want to look a certain way cause I look, it's only, it's going to be what it is. But I'm not a pretty boy. I, I'm not, I'm not a hand, particularly handsome guys. What it is it here? Go Fuck Yourself. You look great. I look at those two Oh five things and that's where I'm like, that shit ain't, it did like I don't want to go to the gym that now. Now we will you will, you ought to shape as a kid or the no, I mean that just happened in your adult life. I always like genetically we always had like meat on our bones, you know, we're short guys, even my brother too. But like I plead every single sport. I re, I mean I, there was not a day that went by in my youth up until I moved out here that I didn't do something that day. Sports wise.

Speaker 1:          24:57          You know what's hilarious? You probably the only guy who have a moving out to la in show business and put on weight. That's fun. Unless you did it for,

Speaker 2:          25:03          I mean, God, I'm craft service got me. I just went, I went probably from 21 to almost 30 where I did not do shit except fuck. I mean I work when I smoked and I AA. That's all I did. So when you, uh, how old were you when you booked entourage? 23 going on close to 24 and that ran for what, seven, eight seasons. Eight seasons spanned across the IHB. L does it with a year and a half break, so spanned across a decade, you know, basically, yeah, almost a decade. 10 Years of craft service. I mean, that's understandable. You kidding? And then you start making a little bit of money. You could actually afford to take a lady out for a meal. It's, yeah, you went off the rails.

Speaker 1:          25:48          What you used to think was a good restaurant and then all of it, you know, I used to be like, you know, guy go into the ground round was like a big group and then I made a little bit of money then what I thought was a good restaurant. And then the second, you know, I met my wife. Then it's just like, yeah, like Jesus Christ, so fucking kill me. She, she goes on the Internet and she knows where all the places are and all that. She's a foodie how she likes tonight. Yeah. Yeah. He's an idiot. Yeah. Until the bill comes and it's just like Jesus just didn't break a window if not fucking worth runoff. We, yeah, we went out the other and every once, like once a month I go out and I and I, uh, will go out and it'll be just like some, yeah, it's fucking brutal. They gave, you can tell every stutter and we just went out to a steak place the other night. It was fucking delicious, but the bill was

Speaker 2:          26:31          really annoying. Really to add to people is like two 80 something.

Speaker 1:          26:36          There was, it was brutal. It was brutal. And I then I bring it up to her. I think I brought it up to her. She got mad, said it was tacky

Speaker 2:          26:45          when I was in Ohio, when I was just in Ohio. We went to a really nice restaurant and uh, we went to the bar first and the, or the round the drinks. So like four of us and you know, I get the credit card. I only had like 20 byline, like 20 bucks on me, my credit card. It's like go and I'm waiting. I'm like, God is going to be a credit card situation came $16 for like five drinks. I'm like, oh my, Geez, what it should be la women's 6,000 a $60 drink water at the minimum. And I'm not a cheap guy, but it, that was [inaudible] that used to be dive bars out here, but all the fucking hipsters, they take over every one of them. Now the dive bars are more expensive, upscale bars. Brutal. It's brutal. So I'm, I want to make sure that I don't, uh, I don't forget to promote everything.

Speaker 2:          27:27          So, uh, let me this, this is, this is actually just for me because, uh, like I was saying earlier, just as far as how you make money outside of this business, I just think that gives you such an unbelievable amount of power where if you have this income coming in, if the acting work slows down just for a little bit, like when they come at you and you know, with the movie where you got to be in drag, you only have to do it if you want to. Yeah. We're like, you see a lot of these guys now because uh, I guess it's more before we talk about the fat cells thing, like, um, in your time in the movies, like the last 10 years in the mood, like the whole movie industry now with the, uh, I'm not even gonna say the name of the websites.

Speaker 2:          28:04          We can watch it for free. It's like it's doing to the movie business. What happened to the music business? 100%. Yeah. So now like for you know, people outside the business listening right now, basically how it works now is who is that have the best chance, correct me if I'm wrong or like low budget independent things or those hundred million dollar robot superhero movies. The in between, which is all the movies that we probably grew up loving, you know, the standby me's, those coming of age kind of move. Those in betweens are almost not obsolete. Like we don't enjoy them, but studios aren't making them right cause they're businesses like two, $3 million or less or a hundred million or more. And that in between gap is actually proving not to be the least profitable business. And I think those are the better movies personally. But uh, you're, you're absolutely hit the nail on the head.

Speaker 2:          28:55          Yeah. Cause I was sitting there one night and I saw like the probably like the 15th a list movie star signed on to do a TV series. That's probably why all these TV series is so unbelievable now. It's like, it's like, it really is like the second golden age of television. Like some of the stuff that's out there and I'm really far behind. People keep telling me I got to see Fargo and there's a, I'm where I'm reformed. I'm on like season three of breaking bad or you what's how far behind I am or yeah. And like season one, a house of cards. I'm real behind. Yeah. I started watching the killing. I like that. What's the first two seasons of that? A house of cards. I watched the first episode, I was like, I love this. And then you know, my life got busy and I haven't got back to that.

Speaker 2:          29:32          So pay attention for that one. You can't, I'm like, yeah, the popcorn and you got to let you got to lock in on that one. You can't really casually watch house of cards. Absolutely. So all these guys now you see like, I mean you see half the cast of like a boogie nights and all these movies I love, they're all um, on, on TV now. So, um, with it change in like that, that's why I'm, I love this, this move. I mean, and, and you did the most riskiest thing is essentially opening a restaurant, right. And, uh, how did the, how did that all come about? It came about because the, uh, the Sao of facts, owls is a real guy. He's one of my best friends I know from New York. Uh, we always talked when we were young, young, I'm talking 20 years old out here.

Speaker 2:          30:13          Like we need like an east coast kind of place out here. We didn't know what it was. And then obviously, you know, he, and he's not, he wasn't in the entertainment business. So He's a mechanical engineer, like builds buildings. And uh, he kind of ended that part of his career. And Him and another friend of mine came to me with this whole plan. And look, I don't know, I'm like Paulie in Goodfellas. Like I don't know anything about the restaurant business. Right, right. I really genuinely, no, I don't cook. I don't want to sit down and I eat. It's exactly how that conversation went. And you know, I, they, they played another one it down someday and sound's going to be a fucking jail. Could show fuck you pay me. No. So I just, I invested in the two of them. I said, guys, I don't know about food.

Speaker 2:          30:54          I know all restaurant, most restaurants fail. But um, not that I feel like I owed, but like if I can empower one of my best friends, cause I'm a lucky motherfucker right now, if I can't give her a shot, why not? I went into it saying I'm going to lose every dollar. I, so I wrote a check that I was comfortable losing every cent of right. And sure enough, the kid came through and I look, I don't run the business right. I'm not going there and making sandwiches. I, I'm in on everything. I know what's going on. But they run that show and they were, we just opened our fourth one in Austin, Texas through, you've got to update your bio. You're killing it so much. They told me you had a, you had two locations, now you've got four. Well you got to, you had to be comfortable with if your buddy knew how to build and design a building that he could make a sandwich.

Speaker 2:          31:40          You mean, that's gotta be a joke. Yeah. But he also built out the places because of his background and the other guy, Josh of fat Sal's who he's the one that they came up with the were making sandwiches over here. Right. You know, he's been in the food industry his whole life. So they were the team and I said, I'm, I'm betting on you guys because the first one was at Ucla Westwood function and I said, they have a great way of making everyone feel like it's your spot. Like you're a VIP. I'm like, these kids are gonna are gonna come to hang out with you too. And sure enough, I hate to say I told you is I was right about that. And then they took it from there. And if just did you guys with that, uh, that flooded, did anything come down your way? Not Luckily, not ours, but I mean, we certainly felt some of the effects of it, but it didn't, it didn't hit, uh, our spot. But, um, for people listening, uh, all over, there was a water main break. Crazy, crazy. Like one of those 10 foot pipes you could drive a truck through. Yeah. Uh, broke in, you know, it's not no big deal. We just steal the water here things and you know, we have so much water in anyway.

Speaker 1:          32:40          So tell, tell me about this. I'm, I'm jumping all around. I'm scatterbrained here, but um, so this Arturo Gotti movie, uh, now is, is this is going to be, uh, it's going to go all the way. Obviously you're going to go to the, I don't want to ruin the end of the movie, but I know how his life and, and, and, and that should stay sorta like open ended as to whether was it was, it officially ruled like a suicide.

Speaker 2:          33:05          It was officially real a suicide. Arturo Gatti, uh, at the, after he retired, you know, he went to Brazil and with his wife at the time, they would go and sit and the kid and, uh, he was found dead and the government, their view ruled it, it was ruled a suicide. She was, his wife was actually in jail on trial for the murder and she was not guilty acquitted. And now she's back here. Um, you know, while we will not be able to literally make the movie and say she killed him, the goal of the movie without giving away all, all too much is if we tell this guy's story correctly, you as an audience member will be able to walk out saying, does no, no fucking way. He hung himself with a pocketbook strap from the, the staircase and ended up under the island of the kitchen.

Speaker 2:          33:54          Like I have the reports, it is mind blowing the, the way they say it went down. Um, so this movies being made because his longtime manager to Pat Lynch, great guy, he's actually in the documentary a lot. Uh, the w Gaddy Ward Tail, the Hbo Documentary, that Walberg Voiceover. And um, the last man was that last century was already the 90s, like [inaudible] 98. No, I think it was there. It was early 2006, 2002 was the first fight. And I remember I watched that fight live was at Mohegan Sun, 2000 people there. And Jim Lamp, we actually says in the fight, man, he's like, man, I bet you these 2000 people did not realize they were walking into and maybe the best fight they'll ever see when you were like, no, no he can't. He was commentating the fight and he was just saying he's looking around the small little arena. 2000 peoples. I bet the 2000 pumps.

Speaker 2:          34:44          Are you watching it and I'm on a big screen or you're at the front cause Washington at home. Oh, okay. Here probably on break from working in Boston market stone, probably watching the fight with some Mac and cheese and um, you know, some mark played Micky ward in the fighter and it's a great, great movie. And I love Mickey Ward as well. And you know, they weren't at a place really to get into the gas rewards stuff. So I think this is kind of, that's why I think that's why mark wanted to be involved is that's the next step is showing that bromance, the ultimate bromance of a Touro and Micky ward.

Speaker 1:          35:15          Right. And there's all those movies, uh, boxing movies is, it's just, I mean I'm a sucker for those. That to me that's like the modern day western. Like when I was a kid I Stories Watch westerns with my dad cause he loved those. And then I look at the rocky movies, they started off good, they got a little stick out, a little crazy. But, but you know what's, what was cool about the rocky, all of them was the premise of each. Like I, I love, I can't even remember which one. There was so many. I'm an expert. Will talk to me. I got the Rusch one was on that was a little ridiculous, but the one where he's coming back like he's lost all his money, uh,

Speaker 2:          35:49          that it's rocky five, five Tommy Morrison.

Speaker 1:          35:55          Yeah. And that what I loved about that, I'm not saying you know when it goes back to Philly. Yeah. And what, and what I love about is just the premise of it that they, they age the character with Stallone. Like I thought they did a really good job and they kind of did like a good trajectory of it. I'm not saying the executed, this is what you gotta do nowadays because there's so many fucking people out there that are going to take, well you actually think that's a good fucking morning. I'm just saying like what the jump off point for where they were going with that too. That's hilarious. You watched all of those.

Speaker 2:          36:25          Let's also take a moment and realize one thing about how crazy, how far we've come. If we tried to make rocky one now at the love story part where rocky and rocky essentially rapes Adrian when he has her at the house. She tries to get out. He slams the door and I need the famous shit. Like he puts his arms up on the pipe and the wife via, you won't let her leave. She's trying to leave. She's like, let me go. And he's like, no, you will. You Go, no, you got us. He basically date rapes 80 doesn't let her leave. There's a lot of that. It's like, dude, let her go

Speaker 1:          36:59          that, uh, back in the day, I guess I shouldn't be laughing at this. It's just fucking, uh, just the fact that that one, what it wants, we want you won the Oscar did it also when I think it won best picture, best screenplay at, yeah. It was almost a sweep. Jesus Christ. I forgot. Oh, I thought that all that shit was in the [inaudible]. Are you a set that little sports holy itself where they'd slap the shit out of him? Like I thought that that was just in the 50s. You a sports movie guy or now some of them I like an I is, if they're done in a way, uh, if they're not too cliched at this, it's very hard at this point now it's like, it's almost impossible. I didn't, uh, I'll have issues like say that movie Rudy loved the story, loved and all of that, but when you saw the actor they picked and then the end they showed the real guy, you saw the real guy. And even though he's small, you look at him like, dude, that guy's a fucking animal man. I would not want that guy running at me. Like I can see how that guy had a heart of a lion, but just,

Speaker 2:          37:53          you know, hard. I would have fought if they were making that movie right now to play Rudy. I, we, I live in meeting Sean Aston head to head battle. I would have, oh my lord, I would just say your rights for that movie. Absolutely. Nowadays nowadays they're not. That would be your one cycle I go is Rudy every Halloween? That's my house. When I get to put on Notre Dame Jack and I hold a Bible. No you don't. Yes I do. Ah Ha's my goto that and Schneider from one day at a time.

Speaker 1:          38:19          Dude, see you. So you basically you love acting the way I love stand up

Speaker 2:          38:23          100%. Like I don't know about you, but acting was just my way into movies and TV. I didn't know I could have easily been an editor and I would have been almost equally as happy. Yeah. I wouldn't have had a of cool stories that I have now would acting, but it was something in, in TV or movies, whatever it was. I just enacting was what that landed on. Oh, speaking of that type of stuff, uh, meeting all these people, uh, all those years on all those seasons on entourage. Who was your favorite guest star? Cause you guys had some monsters on that show. God, it's real. And I know people always try to take a high road. I didn't want to single out one person. I'm not doing that handful, whatever. Give me, I mean, I love, I love James Cameron only because I think he like legitimize the fake world that we created.

Speaker 2:          39:11          Like James Cameron on the show was directing Aquaman. And so he, like when he came on, he legitimize our fake world are fake universe. But, uh, I mean, I loved like Bob Saget. We had the whole cast full house at one point a dice. We had dice on their dice was race was phenomenal. And, uh, I never viewed, told me when I was a little kid sneaking the dice tapes, when my brother listening to him that'd be acting when Andrew dice clay, I would've punched him in the nuts. Now people don't understand like the impact that guy, how I learn. I saw dice clay at the Worcester Centrum. This is like where like the Celtics could have done a home game too. I was like second to last row in the upper deck and he came out and destroyed. And in the end he did his impressions and then I swear to God, he played a drum solo.

Speaker 2:          40:01          I'm not even lying like this. It was like he could do no uh, no wrong. And it's so hard now with all the internet and all the fucking podcasts and all of this shit for somebody to have an impact and get that big and uh, that's one of the, his son is one of the best drummers I've ever seen. Son Max you talked about you guys, he told me his son is on real on the drums. Like well knock your head off with the drums fit. There you go. So we had an appointment. You had so many cool. I mean the, I always describe it like this. Like we had one day on entourage where I don't think any other show would ever do this on the call sheet. You 6:00 AM call at 6:00 AM we were working with Sydney Pollack, great actor, director, and then after lunch or doing a scene with Kanye west, it's like wherever are you going to do in one day?

Speaker 2:          40:50          Are you going to do scenes with Sydney Pollack in the morning and Kanye West in the afternoon. It was, that was the one of the coolest parts of that. So awesome. How crazy is that Bob Saget. I love him. I'm obsessed with him. And he did something really cool. My nephew, who's now watching full house, my mom bought them all the DVDs. It's his favorite show is five years old. He, he, he wants to call me uncle Jesse. He asked me, he's like, I call you uncle Jesse instead of uncle Jerry. Yeah, sure. So I tweeted that. And Bob who, uh, Bob's facade, he must follow me and the row like DM me. Like, look, if the kids ever in town bring him the fat Sal's, I'll come me. And like Bob, if you, if my nephew sees the real you, he might, you might see a first five year old heart attack.

Speaker 2:          41:31          I might just fall on the floor. So I did a benefit was Saget la last week and that guy, he's out of his fucking mind. He goes on stage and he starts wishing the disease we're trying to stop. He's wishing the disease on the club owner and it's the funniest like five minutes I've seen in a while. And the crowds all like uncomfortable in scorm is of course a couple of people that get it, that he's just joking around, but he goes up and he, it's fucking, he just goes up and rifts. So he'll talk himself into a hole and he just, no, he just keeps digging it. He doesn't try to get out. He tries to, EIT goes out, he tries to dig all the way through and come out the other side down in China. And that's what he did. He felt them going and he just kept, he's, he's out of his mind.

Speaker 2:          42:17          This was one of my favorite, um, comics to watch because of that style. And then also because of all the people that watched full house and they still think there's going to be this America's funniest home. Yeah. But this guy, this, that, yeah. This family sort of like entertainment kind of thing. Quick Bob thing. And Doug Allen actually said the creator of honor. I said this on my podcast when, when you went to Bob Saget to do the shell, Doug wanted to play Bob as like broke, like broke, like live in somewhere and blah. And Bob's like, Look Doug, I'll do any one thing I won't do. I won't play broke. Right. Because I d I won't play. So Doug was like, all right, well what about, what would you like to have sex with prostitutes? It's like, yes, he died easily, but I won't play Bro. He would not play down on his luck.

Speaker 2:          43:03          Broke Bob. But he's like, I love, yeah, why not? I'll have sex with prostitutes. Yeah, of course. Because he just, he just thought it was a, they want to do it. That was like his one. I'm not playing bro. Cause that like, um, it just doesn't fit with what I do. That's also, that's probably a smart move too because it's so many people would think that he actually did that where if you just do the prostitute thing, like as soon as comedy a little bit. I guess like in if you, if you know him, you know, you don't really take that seriously, but you may be kind of wonder in the back of your mind like, wait, maybe now he's great, you know? Oh Jesus, all these memories are coming back. I, I was, uh, I was walking my dog and there's a house that I walked by that you guys, I didn't even realize I was watching a rerun and you guys shot without Ralph Macho there.

Speaker 2:          43:41          Oh God. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yes, yes. I'm Dylan too. Yeah, that goes. Um, and of course, you know, Ralph was hilarious and uh, every time I swear to God, like I, I've walked by that thing like 15 times. Every time I go by it. Like nine times out of the 15, I'll be like, we asked them to do the [inaudible] stood right in the best way to do the crease. Shut us down on the crane kick. What does that, oh, the famous Daniel Larusso crane chick at the end that he hits January. We said, well, you do the cranky. He's like, no, I won't do it. And you only asked once, right? Oh yeah, yeah. Out The respect. Of course he asked me once, he says no, we, we really tried to never make anyone uncomfortable view if a cameo came on, like they really had control of what, how far they want it.

Speaker 2:          44:23          Yeah. It was never done with like, you're in on the joke. We're not trying to make you look like a dick if, if you're uncomfortable either don't do it or we'll change it. Doug, Doug was always great about that. That's awesome. Well, I, I had an awesome time. A finally getting me, I know I met you briefly, but uh, I'm really happy for all your success here, but we didn't really get to talk too much about your podcast. What's, is it just you? Is it going to be like another, uh, it's, it's just me, but I do, I do have guests, uh, a lot of the heavy sports gunky guesses. You know, I'm trying right now not to, because it is the dog days of summer and you know, there's no football, there's no hoops. So I'm real. I'm every time I every show at some point I say I'm not going to talk about supports because the minute, you know October comes around, it's probably going to transition into that a lot.

Speaker 2:          45:09          Oh absolutely. So, but we're doing some fun sports things. Uh, we got like the Sports Academy Awards. I'm doing this one thing where we're going to like do the best sports movies never made so, and I want my audience cast. Listen to that. Well I would love for you, I'd love to get your take on this too. Don't we're going to cast the 86 mets that move. Oh Geez. Let's cast. But I'm dumb. Say I'm doing that one on the, on the shell next week. I think when we cast the 86 mets, little teaser, you know Darryl pardon himself, he was a little younger, would have been a great Darryl strawberry. I got the best dow strawberry who is a little teaser with this way. To me it's a genius call. I don't know how you're going to react and only because of what he looks like now. Okay.

Speaker 2:          45:55          Dave Chappelle is dow strawberry cause he's chat right now has a knee. The pictures I've seen of Chappelle, he's like, yeah, yeah, huge. I saw Seattle. He is, he's like a big boy. I can see him cross the room at this point. I would cast him as Dao. Oh. But we get, have fun with it. We could have, I mean, Lenny Dykstra who's going to play Lenny Dykstra Mooky Wilson, Dwight Gooden, Sherry Carter on the Hernandez. He's bringing up some bad memories. You know, I wish we wish we didn't play them in 86 his, I really would have enjoyed that team more because I saw so many things on that. Just the unbelievable like this, the level of talent that was on that team was, was, was insane. And uh, you know, obviously what happened when we ran, until we had those fuckers beat, uh, that book too, if you ever want to read it.

Speaker 2:          46:42          I watched that so little, I don't even remember the names. Like, I can't even remember who was the guy who ran across the home plate and he put his hands on his helmet like Lima Zilly. Why did I think it was night? I'm thinking maybe it was, maybe it was night. My initials. Mine is telling me Mozilla, but that's not a fact. So the hind, the bag Wagner had everything fucking show that forever. It may be nice, still love Vin Scully, but every once in a while when I'm watching the Dodgers game listening to him, he was, his voice will get up into that register and that's all I'm sure you imagine if that APP and now with social media, what the hell that would that would set social media break Twitter if that happened right now Twitter would have to shut down there, whatever. I don't know anything about technology, but whenever they use that shit would break. If bill Buckner happened right

Speaker 1:          47:33          now. Oh, and he like bill Buckner and actually back then before social media, he had to leave. Yeah. Boston. And He, you know, he was upset and he talked about it too. And I was kind of like a, I felt bad for him on one level, but on another level it's like, dude, you know what? What do you eat? We haven't won it. And this long. What'd you think was going to happen? It, it hit a pebble or something. I don't know. It's like, but you know when it's a little slow roller, what do you, what do you think? Did he expect compassion? I don't know. Did He really expect compassionate? I know you, she gets compassion for his fucking Bob Stanley. That's who should give him, he said, son, I'm a fucking card every week that he took that off of him or whoever was, I see.

Speaker 1:          48:13          I haven't literally have never, I never watched the game again. Go. There was no reason to go there. One time I watched some highlights and we had that Calvin Sheraldi in there and it was just single single, single, don't go through it. It was, it was the sickest day to start getting cold sign on and no, but it's fine because we won all these championships, but it's, there's just something about that one. That one hurt. That was, cause I was 18 when that happened. That's when bill Buckner happened. I was 10, so I didn't even, I mean, I didn't even know that we had one at that long and I didn't even, I knew the Yankees had won some championships, but I was too young to get it. But by [inaudible] 86, I got it. And uh, you know, you'd think the Celtics won it that year. Patriots went to the Superbowl, we got the shit kicked out of us, but it was looking good for we've, that was foreshadowing are this, this past tenure.

Speaker 1:          49:01          We kind of got it all at once, but um, but anyways, hey, I'm, I'm really happy for you man. To all the success in like in the highest compliment mount of, you know, back in the day, you know, it was, it was really hard to, to go from a television show where he was so known as a character, especially if they had like a nickname or something like that to then to be going on to doing the stuff to get to when you're playing this Arturo Gotti, I think it's going to lead to great things. You've got all these sandwiches, places you could kill an end. You've got a podcast and I'm helping you promote it on my own podcast. She wants about bad for fucking business. That right there. I cannot

Speaker 2:          49:32          thank you enough though for having me. I've been a, I've been a fan for quiet. I actually, when I, when I met you that night, the nic screening, we saw a screening for the Knicks. Val Is, Oh, I, uh, uh, Michael Michael Rag Rappaport still need directed and which is great by the way. It's, it's awesome. What's it called again? Uh, when the garden was Eden. Yeah. Which is based on a book, right? It's based on a book. When the Knicks were actually good, which I don't know. See, it's similar to you. Like you're, I'm like that with the Knicks. Even like, I just have no idea that they're just losers to me. But you weren't sure. We'll know for Pat Riley those, the early enough, but yeah. Well, you know, losing game game six and sevens and the rock is, John's stock's going to for 17. The joke was John Stocks start to shoot himself after the game, but he missed, oh, you know, it was a, that was my gen Patrick Ewing missing the finger or Reggie Miller scored eight points and 20 sound. I feel your pain. Oh, sorry. But I'm glad I want to be your fan long enough. You got those fucking scam. So yeah. But anyways, I hope,

Speaker 1:          50:28          uh, what little I could do on this podcast, I hope makes bad for business. Uh, a big hit out there and uh, congratulations on this. A Turo gaudy thing, man.
