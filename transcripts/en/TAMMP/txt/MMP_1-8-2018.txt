I mean, you know, not saying that I, it doesn't concern me, but uh, I just kind of take it day to day. I look out the window, right? There's no zombies I can turn on. The Faucet is still water k right. You know, he's got to look for the zombies first. I like the old zombies, you know what I mean?

Speaker 1:          00:01:15       The ones that walked real slow, he had a fucking chance as opposed to now they're like running around. I'll roid it up. Um, roid it up. It's right there on the fucking juice. All these zombies need to be tested. They got to get it out of the fucking league. All right? All those kills that all those other zombies have. That's why like zombies are killing so many people now. You know what I mean? Of course you don't. You don't know what the fuck I'm talking about and neither do I. All right. If you new to my podcast, how are you? Get ready to listen to some of the dumbest shit you're going to hear for, you know, for like another 58 minutes, I think. Yeah. Good call. I mean, 52 52 into the podcast. Um, I'm going to fucking pat myself on the back. That's the back of my head. That's why he was fucking sounded like, you know, I'm fucking wedding reno sucks all winter wedding ring. You've got this little piece of metal on your hand. You hit yourself, you know, it's like a constant fucking why can't, it's like a painful reminder. Oh, that's right. I'm married. You know, fly goes onto your face, you're whack yourself right in the face. You already slept yourself in the face and then your wedding ring like catches like your brow, you know, like half fuck. And right after that happens. Yeah,

Speaker 2:          00:02:34       it goes high. I was just asking if you could do me a favor. When did that come from?

Speaker 1:          00:02:44       I did the Smad is thing tonight. Right? Me and my wife, right. And my wife, we had this, you know, every once in a while you've got to clean house, right? It'd be like, all right, let's go with a kid. Can Harris, let's just down and we're going to talk about what we've been doing over the last whatever month, six months, decade, depending on how long it's been since you've had those talks, right. Having a talk in, in, in a relationship is like fucking the nd a year when you have to do your taxes and you didn't organize anything and you've got a year's worth of fucking receipts all sticking out all over the place and you just keep putting it off and putting it off, you know what I mean? The next thing you know, the box is fucking another box down the street, right? Um, so we, we try to air it out.

Speaker 1:          00:03:34       So we went out, all right, got some chicken wings and we just fuck it. I think we were just going to go out to hand. We knew that we needed to hang out. Like we got to hang out, right? The kids taking a lot of our us time, you need to go fucking hang us. We'd go hang out and then just all this, the shit came out. All right. And one of the things that I was doing is I was ruining television for her. Cause I, I, I uh, I don't shut up. When I watch TV imitate people, I make fun of them. And, uh, when the other person is in the room and they want to watch the show, evidently it's really annoying. Of course it's annoying. So, um, and if she's watching reality TV, like I never shut up cause it's just, I mean, I dunno.

Speaker 1:          00:04:21       So I've been trying not, you know, if she's watching something and that we both enjoy like, Oh Zach, you know, or uh, the Black Mirror. Oh they all got Boston. They got the RS in there. Uh, all the shows that we like, twilight zone, all of that shit. If we're watching shit like that, I shut up. All right. But if it's anything else, I don't shut the fuck up. So she's watching like reality shows. So tonight she was watching the Golden Globes. All right. And I know right there, I can't watch that show with her cause she's gonna get mad at me. So I just wanted to watch sets monologue. I always watched the comic cause it's such a, it's such a fucking crazy Gig, right to come out there. You do an all brand new shit in like sitting right in the front row, like two feet away is fucking Oprah Winfrey and you know, Samuel Jackson and willing to fall.

Speaker 1:          00:05:19       These fucking people are there. They just, it's like the whole move to Holt. Everything you watch in Oman TV, the television shows, movies, all of a sudden it turns around and looks at you while you go out there with the new fucking 10 minutes. So whatever the hell it is they do. So I'm watching that Seth is fucking killing. And I, and I, the first time I talked was at some point when I saw Oprah was sitting there and I leaned up and go, can you mentioned doing your jokes? And Oprah is like right there. She was like, and, and I was like, oh fuck. All right. It's like, I'm going to shut up. MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:05:59       And then the award show started and the smartest thing I did is I just, I, I pretended I had to go do something and I just sort of got up and I walked out. So I wouldn't, I wouldn't do the rest of it. I wouldn't do the rest. I wouldn't ruin the fucking show for. And you guess what? We're not in a fight right now. It's unbelievable. You know? And she would just, I just stayed in the kitchen. I made some waffles. I'm one of those breakfast for dinner kind of guys. You know? That's how I do it. That's my swagger.

Speaker 3:          00:06:29       Yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:06:29       that's it. That's, that's the marble man that I have in me.

Speaker 4:          00:06:35       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:06:36       I just realized the second I said that, that's like some shit you say when you're trying to be interesting on a date or if you're too dumb to know you're not interesting. You would say something. I, first of all, I want to thank everyone who's still listening to this. The fact that I said I'm a breakfast for dinner

Speaker 4:          00:06:52       kind of guy. All right.

Speaker 1:          00:06:56       What I should've said was I like having breakfast for dinner sometimes, but I sent him a breakfast for dinner kind of guy. Why you say kind of guy? You should be legally required to do the double fucking pistol shot with you.

Speaker 4:          00:07:09       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:07:10       With your fingers and that kind of guy, Bang, Bang side of fucking sausage. Um, so that was out there and making waffles and, uh, she yelled out, she goes, Sammy wants, Sammy wants Sam Rockwell one. So I, you know, obviously love Sam and, uh, he did something that's really hard to do. We had a great speech and, um,

Speaker 3:          00:07:34       yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:07:35       And then, you know, I was watching a little bit more and I felt all these things that I was going to say. So I just walked up. I walked up before I said something stupid. You know, if she talks, it's all black, you're not a rapist. Welcome to the Golden Globes. Like I would've been doing shit like that.

Speaker 4:          00:07:56       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:07:57       Do you realize you could be an absolute fucking monster? Okay. But if you wore an all black Tuxedo, like no, everyone would be looking at you like you were progressive. That's why, you know, I understand why it's done because it's a show of strength and everybody's like, yes, this is obviously something that, you know, it needs to stop, Yada, Yada, Yada, and a bunch of other obvious shit. But, um, it also creates a sing would, you could just walk in and no one's going to fuck with you because you're wearing the right uniform. That's why I don't like all of that political correctness stuff is because you create a roadmap

Speaker 3:          00:08:32       yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:08:32       For, for people to just get across the river because they know what to say, what not to say when they're in public and everything. Oh, he said native American Gaddy said Mum, Mum, Mum, Mama obviously and he has an all black Tuxedo. Hey, must be a good person. All right. Now all of this is just shit that no one wants to fucking here when they're trying to watch. So I ran in, I saw Rockwell when I heard Carol Burnett was there. I ran and I saw that and when I heard Roseanne Barr and John Goodman we're on, I ran in and I watched that and I went out and always have something else. I saw Jennifer Anniston. Oh No, she was there with, uh, uh, Carol Burnett. How fucking great does she look, Tony? Man, she does not age at all her and fucking how he lawn. I said the exact same. That's kind of weird, right? I say the exact same thing when I saw how he launched today, when I was watching the playoffs was like give, he fucking looks unbelievable guide. Just as he has not lost one hair on top of his head. I'm an Ilab, that hair cuts and so I was like 15.

Speaker 1:          00:09:41       Um, anyways, uh, I fucking watched so much God damn sports this weekend. Right. I did do a little duo lingo trying to get back into the hole, trying to, I have to become bilingual and I have to learn how to speak French because that's such a snooty fucking language and I'm such a dope. How hilarious would it be? That's what keeps me going. All right. Not Respect for the culture, not trying to improve myself. Just how fucking funny it would be if I was completely fluent in French and like really good at it. I could speak the slang. Yeah. But the, I wouldn't have an accent, you know? Let me just take a how much dumb shit I've said right now and you're all of a sudden out of no way. I could just start speaking perfect. I could go to Paris and no one would turn their fucking nose up at me.

Speaker 3:          00:10:33       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:10:33       Oh, the opportunity, I'm telling you I want to do that cause I want to go there and I want to act like a fucking moron. I mean, not even have to act. I'm just, I'd ramp it up, you know, and then just listen to hear what they would say. And I would just, I would say 10 days of just laughing my fucking balls off and then ruining it for all you guys who go over there, if you're from here. Um, anyways, so I, uh, I had the peach bowl taped, recorded, saved in fucking digital space, whatever the fuck you kids say. And I was meaning to watch it because I came home from the Rose Bowl and I saw, I was like, Holy Shit. Central Florida one. So, uh, I actually put it on in, my wife was six this weekend, you know, everybody got the bug, everybody got the stomach flu.

Speaker 1:          00:11:19       I haven't got it yet. Okay. I take these little chewables. Alright. And I, I take a men's, uh, what the fuck do you call it? Men's, uh, vitamin. What do they call those things? Men's daily or some shit. I never take them. I take them when I start to feel sick and I knew everybody was getting sick around me, so I just started fucking just chow when those things down. Right. And I've been able to hold it off and last night I actually slept in a different room. You know what I mean? I love my wife, but you know, I'm not going to start puking and shitting, you know what I mean? Unnecessarily. I wouldn't put her through that. Right. And he, Jesus Christ for better, for worse. And then there's, there's like common sense, um, and my wife's cool as hell. So she was just like, yeah, get Outta here. Get outta here. So, uh, I left. You know what's weird is if, when you have a chance, like when I sleep in a different room, I sleep on the opposite side of the bed. So when I wake up and I get a sense that the edge of the bed is on the wrong side and I'm not on the road,

Speaker 1:          00:12:33       you know, it freaks me out. Like, where the fuck am I? Did I get arrested for a murder I didn't commit? And then I opened my eyes. I'm like, Oh fuck no, I'm just sleeping in a different room in my own house. That's cool. Um, so anyways, I watched the fucking peach bowl and I watch to central Florida, man, what a fucking game. What a gay men, central Florida hub. I, I, this is long overdue. Congrats in that. I hope it say his name is Sheena Queen. Uh, Griffin, the linebacker on the team. The guys got one hand, he's got one hand and he was dominating, dominating Auburn, who I swear to God, half of their guys looked like they had like 40 pounds on whoever they were lining up against. And I love Auburn.

Speaker 1:          00:13:16       I Love Auburn. I love watching a beat, Alabama. You know, I love seeing that shit. It's just fun. It's fun to see, you know, cause Alabama supposed to win. So Auburn was supposed to win that one. So I mean, how do you not root for Central Florida? Central Florida? It, I went to their campus, right? Did I go to the central Florida? I don't think I did. I went to the other one. I the, where are the game was at the war and the, for the one that's in Orlando, I went to that one and I just went in and I looked at the campus and I was like, yeah, I could've got accepted here. I could've gone to this fucking school. Like their campus is in the middle of like a rotary, like there's a big roundabout and they just put, it's like they had a big roundabout and then they stuck a school right in the middle of it.

Speaker 1:          00:14:02       Um, so I had to root for him because I love that game so much. And I'll see you gotta love an underdog. So congratulations to them. And, uh, what else did I watched all of the playoff games playoffs except, uh, yet, uh, no, I can't even say that. I watched two of the Games today and I missed you don't put the Kansas City game on right at the end. And cause my brother texted me, he said it was talking about, uh, Sean Mcdonough's voice when it cracked. I can't believe the level of shit the guy got for that. That was a great call. It just was, it just wasn't a touchdown. Then everybody who sues fucking miserable. It's got to trash the guy. I wish something as exciting is that happened to every game just to hear him lose his shit. All I heard was a guy that loves the game and loves his job.

Speaker 1:          00:14:52       Everybody's like, yeah. Did you hear his voice? Crack is, I've entered all my voice cracks when I get excited, you know. Um, anyways, so everybody's jumping all over. Uh, Andy Reid, you know, giving him shit for fucking, I don't know. I don't even know what the hell happened. I have no idea. I know that they're big fucking tight end. The potato sack race guy. I know we took a shot to the head so he wasn't in the game. Obviously that will change the bill. You were literally going to break down a game he didn't watch. Yeah, probably. Probably. Um, you know, you know, loves to say, you know what, the guy can't get it done, guy can't get it done. Any radio at guy can't get done. You know, people love to say that kind of Shit. People can't get it done in their own lives. You know what I mean? Can I can't get it done? Nobody can get it done in Kansas City. Okay. Nobody's got it done in Kansas City since fucking hang strap.

Speaker 4:          00:15:48       All right.

Speaker 1:          00:15:51       He's gone to a fucking franchise that is a perennial fucking loser and he came from another one, Philadelphia. That's a perennial fucking loser. All right. Kansas City won a Superbowl in 1970. The fucking eagles won in 1960. Hm. Anybody could do the Phil Jackson thing and fucking go jump on the Goddamn Lakers when they got already got Colby Bryan Shack. Eddie raid likes a challenge. I've go to the most miserable fucking sports city in the world. Philadelphia, the, yeah, he went there before the fit. The Phillies won. All right. When it was a fucking drug where they'd won 1980. But you know what I mean? So in defense of that guy is everybody shitting all over them? Like they would have known how to run the clock or whatever the fuck they giving him shit about that guy. He's taken out two huge fucking challenges. The Philadelphia Eagles and the Kansas City chiefs.

Speaker 4:          00:16:50       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:16:53       All right. So there's my take on it. Having not watched the game, you see that? You see what happens when you just give find an angle. Did you just go off on it? It actually sounded for half a second. Like I knew what I was talking about. Right. Actually, you know why he didn't see the game? The real reason I didn't see the game but wasn't because my wife was sick. The real reason why is because I was busy looking at Game Phil Film. I was busy looking at game field, getting ready to, uh, you know, I had to coach some kids out in the buffalo against this team. The jag was, if one more person sends me a God damn photo going, is it me or you've looked just like this guy. It's like, dude, that choke was made like a year ago.

Speaker 4:          00:17:37       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:17:38       Like if you guys really want to just fucking annoying me, just keep sending me that like, and g got gotta deliver it. Like it's the first time, you know, I should've done, I should've started re tweeting all of them. And maybe that's why I need to do it. I thought I already retweeted them to be like, it's this joke has been made. Let's can we build on it. I'm not saying don't make the joke, but you got to knock knock. Who's there? Banana. Banana. Who knock knock. Who's there? Banana. Banana. Who I get.

Speaker 4:          00:18:07       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:18:11       Where the hell am I? All right, Jack. Speak the fucking bills. Oh, that's right. I watched that. That's the first game I watched. I missed the Atlanta Falcons playing the rams.

Speaker 4:          00:18:20       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:18:22       And I think like a lot of people, I forgot that Atlanta one, the first 58 minutes of last year's Superbowl and then what was great was they completely fucked up their regular season to the point nobody was talking about them, but they made the playoffs. So now it playoffs until, and I, everybody's zero and zero to start. And they got all that experience in the last year. Last year, right? I Dunno. Put the fuck do they play next week? They go to Philly, they go to Philly and Philly was all lined up to go. And what happens? Huh? Carson Wentz gets his fucking need fucked up for the rest of the season because it's Philly.

Speaker 1:          00:19:05       Okay. And I'm not shitting on Phil Yeti. Eagle Fan will tell you this the second you put that fucking helmet on. Somebody who's got to break that curse man. Do you think it's going to be Nick foals? Ah, this is his last name. Sound too much like follies, the nic, foals follies. If he fucking blows this game, I'm telling you right now he's going to be started in one of those ice capades. He'll be like the guy with the top hat bringing out a bunch of old eagles on ice skates that never won super bowls. I'm trying to figure out who I'm going to root for this year. Obviously I'm rooting for the Patriots, but who else do I like? You know, I actually like the saints. Uh, what a great game that was. Now that game I saw against the fucking path is a lot of drops, some critical drops by the panthers or the first time felt that about, you know, what I think's going to happen. I think drew Brees, drew Brees, the underrated drew Brees, he's like third all time passing. Nobody talks about them. You know what I mean? You know why he's just a regular looking guy. You know, he's a little taller than Doug Flutie. Okay. He's a little shyer than fucking, uh, Brett Farve and he's not as good looking as Tom Brady.

Speaker 4:          00:20:18       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:20:18       You know, and he's down there in New Orleans and nobody's paying attention. Nobody is fucking paying attention. And meanwhile, the guys out there killing it, he's got a Superbowl ring.

Speaker 4:          00:20:30       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:20:30       So now he's going to Minnesota.

Speaker 4:          00:20:33       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:20:34       To face some guy named case Keenan who people will say it, he's in the running, they'll be the athlete play in the league. He is, you think drew Brees is afraid of that? I don't think he is. Um, it is my prediction for next week knowing nothing about the Minnesota Vikings. Okay. I say drew Brees goes into Minnesota. Okay. And when he leaves is going to be a bunch of people crying at the mall of America. I think the sates go in and they fucking beat Minnesota. You know, buddy of mine was going, uh, I can't believe Minnesota built another dome there, like a cold city team. That's like a great advantage. And now drew breeze is going to go in and play in a dome. He's going to be at home. And I was just like, why did they make a dominant? I was like, that's what I was thinking.

Speaker 1:          00:21:22       But we're old guys and I think that, uh, you know, the NFL has done with us, you know, they're now trying to move on to the millennials and you've got to build a dome because millennials don't like to go outside. Right? So if he can just get them to an Uber, they'll get to the game and they look, you look you back inside again, you back inside this big TV screens. You can stare at those instead of watch the game. But he can sit here and say, you, you, you are at what you watched on a TV. Um, all right. And the Patriots are playing the titans. Uh, we'll see. We'll see how that one goes. You never know. And, uh, who did the steel has got the Steelers get the fuck in a, they got the jags right? The Steelers got the jags kind of happy.

Speaker 1:          00:22:13       Both those teams, one of them is going to knock the other guy off. Although I am not excited, you know, if we get past the titans, I am not excited to play the Steelers again cause they already beat us once this year. Um, but unfortunately, uh, we were given the victory over that whole bullshit. Maybe it's a good thing cause he ended up getting home field, but, um, I always think the team that loses has the advantage the second time around. However, however, I just think bill Belichick has such a superior coach, by the way. You know, I'm like, do I really have to address this stupid shit about bill Belicheck that he's going to leave the patriots over a fucking personal trainer? I, I sometimes I just think that the fucking media just has it out for the fucking patriots. I just don't understand. I've never seen such a big punch of shit made out of nothing.

Speaker 1:          00:23:05       And here's the thing, if he's fucking going bad, it Bella check ever went back to the giant who gives a fuck? He's not ours. He started with the giants. Okay. We didn't, he started with like the fucking lions or southern, but he started with the giants. Okay. That's where he got his first ring. Then he went over to the Goddamn jets. Right. A man goes over to the fucking jets and um, no. He went to Cleveland before that and they fired him. Typical Cleveland move. He goes over to the jetty, was going to be the jets coach. It was right there. And then he just wanted to get off Monday, bill Parcells and he left. So I, it wouldn't be a defection out of Boston. It would be a return home. We fucking stole that guy in 1999 we've gone to seven Superbowls. One five maybe. That's why we never beat the giants. That was the football gods. God Bill, you never shut a left actually showed a left. You know what I mean? That was like when he stepped out from bill Parcell shadow, it became the fucking legend that he is now. But anyway, so the end of the fucking day, I don't give a fuck about Tom Brady's personal trainer. I don't give a shit. Who the fuck would break up the Goddamn band over that is beyond me. Am I really supposed to think that that's a real fucking thing that would shock me? Not if he left. It would just shock me. If it was over that.

Speaker 5:          00:24:32       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:24:32       But you know, Bill Parcells leftover Terry Glen, rest in peace.

Speaker 4:          00:24:38       You know,

Speaker 1:          00:24:41       I'll never quite forgive that guy for telling the fucking team that he wasn't coming back the next year before we played the packers and the Superbowl.

Speaker 4:          00:24:48       And uh,

Speaker 1:          00:24:51       actually has that ever even been confirmed? Somebody just told me he did that. All right, I'd like to apologize to bill Parcells with the fuck am I talking about here?

Speaker 1:          00:25:01       She listening to as a man who did nothing but this weekend. That's what you're doing. Okay. That's why you probably listening cause you probably did it too. All right, here's one of the Douchey is things. I haven't done it yet, but I'm going to do it and I feel like I have to admit to it before I do it. Okay. Anybody in in Ireland, we're not going to make sure that's the right country. Who Makes Shepherd's Pie? You know what I mean? There's, there's like all these, those fucking Pi's over there and I love all of them cause I got all that blood in me. English, Irish, Scottish, so at any sort of Elena knows fucking meat pies. I liked that shit. All right. Shepherd's Pie or Ridge in shepherd's pie was invented by shame is so shepherd shepherds pie or cottage pie. He's a meat pie. Bababababa [inaudible] place of origin. The United Kingdom. Oh, all right. Cause there's no sheep in Ireland. Is that what it is? I always forget that then. Then Ireland, they make it. They'd make a different one. Right. Shepherd's Pie, cottage pie, blah blah, blah, blah. That just you get could get care history. It's going to be boring as shit. In early cookbooks, the dish was a means of using leftover roasted meat of any kind in the pie dish was lined with mashed potatoes as well as having a mashed potato crust on top. Oh, say build a wall around it back then.

Speaker 1:          00:26:28       Where did it come from?

Speaker 5:          00:26:31       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:26:31       I like that. I can't find it so I can't, so I just yelled at my computer. I don't give a fuck. You know, that's it right there. That's why I didn't do well in school. I look it up and I have again, I got, I got that clock in my head like a quarterback. You know, we've got the clock before I just throw it out of bounce. I don't care. No, no. I'm not going to learn it. I'll, I'll fucking make it up on the next question. And that's why I got like a three 90 combined on my sats. I did. And I took a prep course and I actually, I actually, I studied, did I break it? I don't think I break broke 400. I know. Whatever you do is you look, do they give you like three 50? I know,

Speaker 4:          00:27:10       I know. Um,

Speaker 1:          00:27:13       anyways, I'm going to make a shepherd's pie with cauliflower mashed potatoes. I just have to pause here as everybody's gone. Um, yeah. Cause this gluten free diet that I'm doing that I'm kind of half ass doing it, but just half ass doing it. I don't have to work out. It's fucking great telling you, man. If you lay off the gluten, I remember thinking, what the fuck is glued? And then they told me what it's everything that it's in. And I'm like, oh, so like all the good foods, all the foods I love.

Speaker 4:          00:27:50       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:27:51       I've just been laying off the old glute there. Uh, gluten free. If you ever saw my flat ass, she be surprised on us. Sorry. Bad joke.

Speaker 1:          00:28:02       Yeah. So I'm going to make it with a cauliflower because I'm not allowed to eat potatoes. I'm sorry people, I've been out here too long. You know, I've been 10 years out here, out here in Hollywood, and I become a gluten free Douche. I'm not really, because I got these Brioche buns that I bought for the hot dogs at the Rose Bowl and it was the only thing I fucked up. I forgot to not only bring hot dogs, I forgot to buy them. So I have all of these brioche bonds and it's like I'm not going to throw them out. So when I brought some hot dogs, so I'm kind of full of sodium and gluten at this point. Um, anyways, so I'm going to make shepherd's pie with, um, mashed potato and I'm not putting, well, it's one recipe I saw they had corn in it and I was like, oh, I want to fucking, why would you do that? It's all about the piece. You had the lamb in there, right? You get a little bit of onion and minced that up,

Speaker 1:          00:28:59       couple of other fucking salt and pepper, whatever else you put in there. And then, then, then you get the piece fucking corn. It's an imposter, doesn't have the guts of a p. That's what yellow. It's a little yellow. Fucking cowardly fucking sort of vegetable. Then a fruit. Is it not at all. So that's why I'm, I do, I'll make a shepherd's pie with fucking mashed potatoes. Got Cauliflower mashed potatoes. I actually really like cauliflower mashed potatoes. I don't like cauliflower. But if you're gonna throw a bunch of butter on it, I mean, how is it not going to taste good? You know, the only thing I really don't like is that fucking, uh, what is that shit? They were putting in everything for awhile. Oh, what the fuck it was it being with at teed in it? Truffle oil.

Speaker 5:          00:29:50       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:29:50       I mean, one time we went out and there was mashed potatoes and they had truffle oil in it. No, no, I'm sorry. Head at a macaroni and cheese and they put truffle oil. Why would you do that? You don't need to, it's pasta with cheese. Fuck off. You know, truffle oil for a while it was like the fucking Hari Krishna of herbal ingredients, you know? Yeah. Tell him he don't want any fuck out of you. We need low. Um,

Speaker 5:          00:30:24       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:30:24       And I, and the waiter or the waitress or is, is there an, is there, I can't believe no one's been offended by that yet. Wait around and wait. She said, and we're all waiters is, is there a fucking, uh, gender, gender neutral fucking term we can come up with that, uh, wait, attended, who that's going to give someone a body image. Um, the fucking person who gives you your food, who would rather be doing a different job for better money there. Is that a good description? Was that genderless? Um, told me that there was only a little bit of trust. It's just a hint of it. That's just a hint. That's just a dash. And I was like, all right, and I ordered it and it just, it just sucked. Truffle oil overpowers every fucking thing. It's like a comic that's on offstage, like a fucking lamp shade over. It's God damn head. I hate truffle oil. I don't even know what it is. Should I look that up and fucking, is it from like a mushroom or something? Truffle.

Speaker 5:          00:31:32       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:31:32       Oil. This is why the Internet mets makes people less funny because back in the day you just had no idea and he just guessed and then there was always somebody in the room with a big enough fucking ego to just definitively give you an answer even though they didn't know. Truffle oil is a modern culinary ingredient. Used to impart the flavor and aroma of truffles to a dish. All right, now we're looking up truffles. Truffle is a fruiting body of subterranean has come set fungus. Oh fuck. Is that all right? Now I'm looking up a scum set. A scum set is a division or a phylum of the Kingdom of Fuji. Fuji. All right. What's a phylum in biology? A phylum is a level of classification. Alright. Taxonomic rank. Biological classification. A taxonomical rank. See what I'm saying? It, this is why I don't look up.

Speaker 6:          00:32:40       I'm too dumb to understand the fucking definition. It just, it just keeps going. It's like a humble.

Speaker 5:          00:32:47       Okay.

You know what I mean? Some of these fleet streaming sites, right. And you're fucking, oh, I want to watch that. Oh, wait a watch that now watch. It was another thing I was going to watch.

We're done the reeds for the week. Um, if you might notice you, you have noticed that, uh, I am in a little more of a perkier mood. I am in a great move. Cause guess what? Guess what? Guess what? Guess what? Guess what? Um, I finally made a breakthrough in my rehab of this fucking lingering a rotator cuff injury. You're not sorry. I don't even know if it's cup or cuff links. Cuff. I always forget. I think I said Cup for most of my life. Let's go back to row a Wikipedia rotate Brodie Tor. Oh, it's cuff. It's not cup in anatomy. The rotator cuff is a group of muscles

Speaker 1:          00:42:18       and their attendance, that act to stabilize the shoulder. Yeah, that's the problem because when they fucking don't, you show the kind of comes out of the socket maybe, I don't know.

Speaker 4:          00:42:27       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:42:28       Uh, the four muscles of the rotator cuff are, are over half of the seven scapular meal muscles. Scampi it for you. And marbles are a group of seven muscles that connect to the humorous, humorous to the Scapula. They are amongst the muscles that act on the

Speaker 1:          00:42:49       Glio rule. Well Joe, what the fuck is that? The shoulder joint. Oh, that's his shoulder. Joined the Glencoe Humber all join up. It gives a fuck many ways. My shoulder's been bugging me so I didn't understand. Um, I don't understand how to Rehab. I like when I felt pain, I stopped. I didn't understand that you had to kind of go into it a little bit like you skimming the frost enough, right? We should making steel cut oats, you know that awful Gluey Shit on top. You just skim that off. He kind of got to do that with the pain. So, um,

Speaker 4:          00:43:23       yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:43:24       it's person told me this great exercise we were, I just, I laid down on my back and then put my arm, like if I was standing up, I would be pointing straight ahead. But when you lay down your back, you're not pointing at the ceiling. Okay? I'm not saying put your arm up over your fucking head. Just pointing straight up and just start making little circles, you know, a bunch clockwise, a bunch counterclockwise. And then you just gradually increase slowly as shit the circumference of them. And when you start to feel the top layer of pain, you know, that's where you stopped. But you, but when you, when I was going, wow, I've been doing it when I go around into this circle is I kinda stay at an acceptable level of confronting the pain. And I swear to God, I've been doing that for like the legislature since a Thursday and I've gotten like 30% increase, I would say in my range of motion. And I feel like I can get this thing, you know, I'm not saying restrengthen it, but I think I can get it all back by the end of the fucking month. Oh, I, I can't say that because I don't want to fucking rush it because I don't mess it up again. Um,

Speaker 5:          00:44:31       yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:44:31       they're very excited about, that's putting me in a better mood. You know what they say? You know,

Speaker 6:          00:44:35       hey, at least she got you health because it puts you in a bad guy. Damn mood. Um, all right. So somebody was asking me, Dean del Ray's diet. Hi Bill. Can you please talk about Dean del Ray's diet details on, on his next podcast? I'd like to lose a little weight myself, so I have to go into Dean del Ray's podcasts. Let there be talk from the all things comedy network, network network. Um, Dean can explain it. I don't remember all of it. I just kind of like, I eat like for breakfast I have two eggs, always g and then I have a one serving of steel cut oats to take for fucking ever to cook. Um, it's another way to lose weight, waiting for your food to be ready. Um,

Speaker 1:          00:45:21       and then for like a snack, I'll have a z bread, which tastes like shit unless you put butter. And I have almond, peanut butter, almond butter is what it is. And uh, I have that and that's actually fucking delicious. And it's filling. And then for lunch I have a

Speaker 6:          00:45:38       keen awash with uh,

Speaker 5:          00:45:42       okay

Speaker 1:          00:45:42       with black beans. And then I throw salsa on top to give it some sort of fucking flavor. Cause other than that, you know, I've never eaten a shoe with, you know, with a newspaper on top because that's what it tastes like. And I try to avoid throwing salt and any of that shit in there. Um, and then in the afternoon, I dunno, what the fuck do I have? There's always that one meal before you have the real meal. Right around four o'clock. I have like a fucking a

Speaker 5:          00:46:08       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:46:09       I Dunno what. Sometimes I'll have a whatever the fuck I want. And other times it's like this pasta that's made out of chickpeas, it tastes a little weird, but it's not that bad, you know? And then for dinner I just have a protein with like a salad and I'm done and I just drink waters and I stay away from the booze and all of that bullshit. And um, it's just weird thing when you eat like that where I think what you mean when you say God like, God, this food is so boring and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. It's cause you're used to the sugar assault. It gets your system going like sugars or salt does whatever the fuck salt does. Like it's like you get your fix so when you eat that, what do eat stuff that doesn't have any of that in it. Um,

Speaker 5:          00:47:00       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:47:01       You're just not hungry afterwards and it's weird and then, but you feel energized. But it's a, it's a different kind of, you got to adjust your brain to the fueling your body rush as opposed to the, the rollercoaster of sugar and salt. Um,

Speaker 6:          00:47:20       so I that, that's as much as I know about the Diet and I've been doing that. And then, you know, I like that most of the time, probably 80% of the time I eat that way.

Speaker 1:          00:47:30       And then occasionally if I just want to have a fucking pizza eat it. But Dean does it, dangerous fucking stays with it. And that fucking guy, he'll every once in a while he just sends me a picture of him when I first met him. It doesn't, he doesn't all get the same person.

Speaker 3:          00:47:45       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:47:45       Cause not only did he lose all this weight, like he like his skin fucking cleared up. You know, they used to look like a fucking cop with 20 years in is what it used to look like. You know, now he looks like a fucking rock star. Um, so I would listen to him out his podcasts, let there be talking. I'm sure he's, he said a dietician or something. He gets great guests over there. Um, all right bill, you're not an addict. Hey old ginger balls. Uh, I'm a big fan of the podcast and looking forward to your next special and the new season of F is for family. Keep up the great work. Thank you. I been listening to the podcast for the last couple of weeks and I've heard you going back and forth about abstaining, but from booze and most recently about a, yeah, I'm sorry. They fuck, I said a lot of bad things about Aa.

Speaker 1:          00:48:35       If it fucking works for he works for you. It's just, it's just fun to make fun of that Shit. You know, it's funny, I saw the other day in a strip mall. It was, you know, all these different stores that one of the, one of the stores there and said alcoholics anonymous, you know what I mean? It's uh, it's kind of putting it out there, isn't it? You know, it's bad enough. These poor people had to sneak into porno stores and that type of shit back when they would drink at night. You know, you're going to do that to him. Just,

Speaker 3:          00:49:01       yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:49:02       Shouldn't it say bill W's? Well, I guess how that signed up, a bunch of cats like me might be walking in like, what are you guys selling? And you guys would be like, hope smoke filled room with donuts. Um, I've been working in addiction and back to the letter here, I had been working in addiction and the addiction field for over a decade, teach and addiction course at a college and work at one of the most highly respected addiction programs up here in Canada. Ah, dude. You know, you had it all. You had me until you said Canada. Canada doesn't count.

Speaker 3:          00:49:40       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:49:41       Dude, you, you live in Canada. For me to be considered an alcoholic and Canada. I have to drink like fucking two cases a Molson.

Speaker 3:          00:49:48       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:49:49       You guys, animals up there have you guys don't know you're alcoholic. She just think you keeping warm. All right, well let me, let me not judge this guy. Now that I've mentioned my credentials, while at the same time sounding like a pompous content are, I love this guy called himself out on, I can tell you that you are not an addict, but it's like you are not the father, you are not an addict, but everything you have mentioned on the podcast that I am a longtime listener. Um, oh, so when you said we listened to the last couple of weeks, I guess you'd dip in and dip up, right? All right. The word addiction is thrown around a lot, so as the word hero is thrown around a lot and typically to

Speaker 6:          00:50:27       any behavior that is out of our control a to put it as simply as possible. People will often say things like they're addicted to things like TV, shopping, sex, et cetera. People will also use the word to explain what draws system symptoms of a substance or behavior. I, I must be addicted to coffee because I get headaches in the morning if I don't get a cup. However, experiencing enjoyment or withdrawal symptoms does not mean that someone has an addiction. Can we just kind of stop here and say this is one of the best written fucking letters in a while. I apologize that my level of intellect is reading it, but I think you guys can hear that this person seems to know what he's talking about or she or it or her who used to be him. Did I cover everything? However, in the edition, in the addiction field, there is a way to tell if someone has an addiction. We call them the four C's of addiction, cash, cons, cauliflower and I dunno, I, I bring up in the chargers la charges. Okay. If you've persisted, if you can, if you have persistent cravings for drugs, alcohol, slash, alcohol, if you have lost control over how much and how frequently you use, if you continue to use despite consequences. I he legal issues, job loss, children taken away. And if you feel a compulsion to use I, he always feeling like you need,

Speaker 3:          00:52:04       okay,

Speaker 6:          00:52:04       uh, a drug or alcohol is a bunch of weed smokers going, um, and alcohol is a drug. Uh, then you can begin to think you have an addiction. Knowing what I know about from you, uh, on the podcast, I'm not going to pretend to know you personally. I have never heard you mentioned any significant consequences around booze other than your Dui when you were young and you have control of booze. Since you can have a full bar in the house and not drink it and abstain for long periods at a time from booze, the bar in the home also means you don't have a compulsion to drink. People that struggle with significant alcoholism cannot have booze just sitting around their place drinking it. It's fucking funny to me. I don't know why. Like they're just sitting there seeing it at the corner of the ride and they're like sweating. It's fucking looking at me, man.

Speaker 6:          00:52:57       He liked that black dude and predators shaving your head. I see you over there, that bar. Um, I don't believe you have an addiction and you don't need to go to Aa for me. He wrote it all in capitals. Uh, you're just some content likes to boos whose job in lifestyle allows for it. Dude, you're going to talk me to drink it tonight. Um, if you ever feel like you d do need some serious help, go see a professional instead of some, sorry, sat bleeding his heart in a church basement in front of a group of strangers. Having said that, I know Aa does work for some people and if you're into that, knock yourself out, you just like me, you had to shit on it a little bit. I hope this helps and can silence the bill w listeners of the Monday morning podcast. Best of luck in the new year and all the best in the air and your lovely daughter and go fuck yourself. Wow. I might have to fucking download, download that, whatever printed out and frame it, uh, at framers.net or whatever the fuck those people are. Frame Bridge. I got to use those guys for that. Wow. That was awesome. That made me feel better about myself. Um, am I going to drink now? No, I got to go do a set tonight. Uh, all right, chef. Not Making enough money. That was really informative by the way.

Speaker 4:          00:54:17       MMM.

Speaker 6:          00:54:18       I definitely went through periods where I was craving it,

Speaker 6:          00:54:22       you know, and didn't want to drink and I was just like, this is what I did. And, and he and I would just go over it and I just, you know, but I felt more like a diet thing, like late at night, just fucking eat. Well, don't go out and go make a fucking grilled cheese sandwich your friend, and then you just go out and do it. But what that first fucking night when you don't do it, then I could stop. So yeah, I don't think I am. Bill. Stop giving you examples. The guy left you off the hook. All right, chef. Not Making enough money. All right, dear Billy Betty Crocker, I liked that one a way to go champ. On your pie making skills. I'm the chef of a new restaurant this year. The restaurant has made a hundred grand more than a year before. The restaurant is doing great, but I'm making sad money.

Speaker 6:          00:55:08       I have a wife and a daughter. My wife has always supported my cooking, but I don't make the money. I should. Recently, my wife told me I could work with her brother as an electrician for the water district. I could be making three times more than what I could as a chef. I love cooking. It's the one thing that makes me happy too. I hang tight with the cooking and do what I love or skip out and go with the easy money. I have investors ready to support my cooking, but I need money. Now. Love to hear what your thoughts are. Your thoughts. Oh Jesus, do. This is a huge fucking decision. How much do you love cooking? Is this your dream? Is this what you want to do?

Speaker 4:          00:55:53       MMM,

Speaker 6:          00:55:55       I, I can only equate to standup comedy. There is not a job out there that would have paid three times more than what I could make as a comedian that I would have ever, ever even for a second, considered

Speaker 4:          00:56:07       ever, ever.

Speaker 6:          00:56:11       Not even for a fucking second. Okay. If you feel that way about cooking that I would stay with the chef jump. However, if you know, if you don't feel that way, I would talk to somebody else. This is a major decision, dude. I'm not making this decision for you, but I can tell you, uh,

Speaker 4:          00:56:31       you know,

Speaker 6:          00:56:33       one of the great things about my dream of being a comedian was I really had no other options because I kind of sucked at everything else and I was miserable doing anything else. And that was the only thing I ever did where the second I did it, I was just like, oh, I'm doing this for fucking ever said I don't give a shit. So, uh, but I also didn't have a wife and a daughter at the time. There's a lot of variables here.

Speaker 4:          00:56:57       MMM.

Speaker 6:          00:57:00       You have investors ready to support your cooking, but any money right now?

Speaker 4:          00:57:07       Uh,

Speaker 6:          00:57:08       I would say this, if, if you, this is your decision buddy. If you decide to keep cooking, you gotta, you gotta get your wife on the right page. You guys got to give him extra to say on the same page.

Speaker 6:          00:57:19       You know, if you really believe in yourself and then you can run a restaurant, you can be one of those guys, right? Walking around with the orange clogs, fucking riding a vesper and all that shit. You know, like Mario Batali, that was another guy, foggy grabbed a couple people's asses. Now I never get to see him again. You know what I mean? Kenny just fucking from his self imposed exile. He can't just make a fucking use the well method and show me how to make something, you know, you just put them on a leash, right? You put them on a fucking leash and he can't go anywhere away from the island in his kitchen. Uh, anyways. All right. That's what I would do. Okay, so I would ask, how much do you want to be a fucking chef? All right. And if you want to be a chef, you gotta get your wife on the same page. Other than that, uh, you know, if it's not your fucking dream, then you could just fucking become an electrician who has the best fucking cookouts ever. All right. Ex-Girlfriend hooks up with stranger at party. We both attended.

Speaker 6:          00:58:24       Okay.

Speaker 4:          00:58:25       Okay.

Speaker 6:          00:58:26       Hey Billy, on the back. Nine of life. That's true. My girlfriend and I broke up about four months ago after an 11 year relationship. Wow. Sorry to hear that. We share a lot of the same friends and I knew we would see each other at a friend's New Year's party. Two days before the party, my ex hit me up and asked to get a drink and clear the air before seeing each other for the first time since the breakup. We had an awesome time and we ended up going out again the next night and add an even better time. She then asked if I wanted to share a cab to and from the New Year's party. I agreed while at the party she met a guy and they were all over each other the entire night. Oh God.

Speaker 6:          00:59:15       She ended up ditching me and going home with him at the end of the night. I have hooked up with a few people to break up but never in front of my ex. And after the previous two nights I was absolutely devastated by what she did. I would love any advice or insight. Thanks and go fuck yourself. Well that it really seemed like, unless she was completely shit faced, that really seem a little calculated. And that right there sir. Your story right there is why I avoided staying in contact with ex-girlfriends. I'm not saying they were all bad, but I had a girlfriend like that, an x and uh, they have like this sixth sense is right is you're starting to get past and over them. They just feel it. They call you up and they just fuck you. Life your head up all over again. Um, here's one for you dude. What kind of a person would do that? Huh? The kind of person that you don't want to put your seed in. Just know that that could have been the mother of your fucking children. You dodged a bullet. Congratulations sir. Congratulations. Okay. And I'm willing to bet that unless she completely fucks up her life, you will not hear from her again or you will hear from her because she is a sadistic person and wants to hear your reaction. She wants to hear the pain

Speaker 6:          01:00:51       and get off on it while she goes like, well, I didn't think there'd be a problem because we were broken up. So I don't know why you're putting this on me. Okay. I thought we both had, we have nice time. We were adults and the whole time she's just getting off on the fact that you still give a fuck. So Ah, dude, you dodged a major fucking bull. I mean I, I would never do that to somebody. I would never, I wouldn't do that. Like if a, you know, I, I wouldn't do that now. I've been with Nia forever. If I saw an x grove, I would never fucking,

Speaker 6:          01:01:29       I would just western hail, let's get out of here. It's gonna, you know, let's go someplace a little more quieter. I would never do that to somebody that's just a fucking asshole, male of female to do that to somebody who's a really fucking asshole thing. I'm sorry that happened to you, but you know what? You know what's great too. She's out of your life. She's Outta your life. And you know, you know what those people are, but they like those. What about Bob people you know, remember the beginning of, what about Bob? The therapist gets Bill Murray's character away from it. Dumps him in fucking Dreyfus. His lap. That's what she's, she's the fucking, the female version. Those what about Bob People? If you can ever dump them off on other people's fucking tremendous. And she did it to herself and this is what you do. Anytime you ever see her after that, just big smile on your face. Big Smile on your face. Hey, how are you doing? Why are you mad? No, no, we broken up.

Speaker 1:          01:02:21       Good for you. You know, have the time of your life, my senior leave.

Speaker 6:          01:02:30       All right. And now's a great time dude to fucking expand your horizon. Find new friends and dull a fucking hobby. Travel Gig itself in great shape. Go to the gym. It's time to you fucking work on you. And that person is, is in the rear view fucking mirror. You know what all she did was give you a great fucking story to tell the love of your life. Cause that, that chicane it. All right. Enjoy your 2018 you're a free man. All right. This girl is killing me man. All right, dear Billy, big head. Ah Shit. You guys are really accurate this week. Uh, back nine, big head. I mean, what are what? I'm fucking on the ropes here so we throw in the towel a, I am a sophomore in high school,

Speaker 4:          01:03:19       okay,

Speaker 6:          01:03:20       but I've been listening to your podcast podcast for a year now. I need some advice out. Jesus Christ. This is fucking scary. I hope you need some fucking regular advice. All right, I need some advice on how to handle this. Girl. Hey Nia, you out there.

Speaker 4:          01:03:36       They are.

Speaker 6:          01:03:38       You want to, you want to give this kid some advice?

Speaker 4:          01:03:44       Oh, that's right. You're sick. Okay. Sorry.

Speaker 1:          01:03:51       Hang on. Let me hit pause here. Hang on. Hang on. All right. I'm back. I'm back. Jesus Christ. She's still sick. She's still sick. Sleeping upstairs again tonight. Um, all right.

Speaker 6:          01:04:05       A sophomore in high school and I need some advice and he knows how to handle this girl. I dated her for about nine months last year. A lot of heartache this, this week and learned a lot. The problem is that this girl is really immature and I cannot have a conversation with her without her arguing.

Speaker 4:          01:04:21       Yeah.

Speaker 6:          01:04:21       Sorry. Pick this up without arguing with me or something over something not important. Oh, tell you're a son who gives a shit. Fucking move on to the next one. For example, towards the end of my relationship with her and she gave me the silent treatment for multiple days because I told her I didn't like Australia. She constantly insulted me, called me dumb, and told me I was a terrible brother.

Speaker 1:          01:04:45       The date and your sister when she just observed your family. What state

Speaker 6:          01:04:51       did this come from and did crazy things like this throughout our relationship. She's one of those girls who thinks that she, she's always, she thought that she always gets to be right and I am not and I am not about that life. He says when she broke up with me,

Speaker 1:          01:05:08       it was this whole scene, Walter, that sounds like you dodged a bullet here.

Speaker 6:          01:05:15       What dating is all about is what you don't want and then you figured that out and then you finally fucking meet the right person. You totally, yeah, you're fucking youngest shit. What's the problem here? I got very close with their family and while, so you're a good guy and when we broke up her seven year old sister's sobbed, Jesus Christ, her mom even went to the extent to call me on the phone to tell me I was a great boyfriend and wished me wish that me and her could possibly work things out in the future. Her family adores me to this day due to the fact that I really played up the whole nice guy thing or what are you really an asshole. This is where things get even worse. She constantly leads, leads me on and I fall for it. Yeah. That's what being young is all about. And at a town fair we have, we have, she hung out with me all weekend. We were very flirty and she heavily led me on, but when I asked her out, she said she wasn't ready. All right dude. This once again, if you listen to the last, so this is why you do not stay in contact with ex girlfriends.

Speaker 6:          01:06:20       Okay. She just doesn't, she doesn't want you to meet someone else until she's met somebody or, I don't. I don't. I don't know what the fuck they think. I just know. I just know you just, you gotta, you gotta you gotta you gotta walk, you gotta walk. All right. The same thing happened a few months later. I have left her alone for the past few months, only talking to her once every three weeks and every time she ends up being mad at me for some dumb reason an hour ago she was mad at me for not roasting her and called me pathetic roasting her.

Speaker 5:          01:06:55       Hm.

Speaker 6:          01:06:56       I'm trying to figure out what the fuck you live. You've got a little fair, the town fair. And then you guys also have roast. I don't really, this is all right. She apologize all the time for her action, but continues to do the same thing. Should I not even talk to her or should I forgive her because she's just immature and can handle our feelings? Any advice would be appreciated. Especially you get the, uh, the lovely Nia to answer as well. Hope the family's doing great and go drink a beer. It's hilarious. Um,

Speaker 6:          01:07:27       yeah, I would just have a conversation. I would just say, listen, uh, I don't enjoy talking to you because you always get mad at, you yell at me. We are broken up and I don't think it's healthy for us to continue talking to one another. However, when I see you, I don't want it to be weird. So is there a way that you, you want a nice way could just fuck off and let me get on with my life. But if I see you, you know, we could just walk by, you know, we could raise eyebrows, you know, and acknowledging that we saw each other. Maybe we get a high five and not saying anything, you know? And then if she flips out, it gives a fuck. Think gives a fuck. I mean, it's just doesn't, you know, it doesn't sound like, here's a question for you since you broke up it, has it ever ended? Well, any interaction, any interaction you've had with them? Okay. If the answer is no, then she got to stop interacted with there. But it seems like it's such a small town. I'm judging you because you went to a fair. Okay. So my world, you brought your prize pig down there or not. I don't know what the fuck happened after that.

Speaker 4:          01:08:32       All right. Um,

Speaker 6:          01:08:35       I would say, yeah, I would just, you know, this, I imagine plenty of other women,

Speaker 4:          01:08:44       you know,

Speaker 6:          01:08:45       uh, what's the proper word at that age? Chicks you fuck go to school with.

Speaker 4:          01:08:49       Okay.

Speaker 6:          01:08:49       It's really no middle world, right? Girls, you know, girls that point, you're a fucking teenager. I don't, I'm not, I'm not going on Wikipedia again. I don't know what the fuck word is. Okay? There's plenty of the fucking chicks you could be hanging out with.

Speaker 4:          01:09:02       All right?

Speaker 6:          01:09:03       That's it. And here's the thing. Here's a tip for you. When you fucking hang out with them, don't talk about your old relationship.

Speaker 4:          01:09:10       Okay?

Speaker 6:          01:09:11       What about some mother fucking woman? They don't want they, they, well, yeah, I don't want to hear it.

Speaker 4:          01:09:17       Okay.

Speaker 6:          01:09:17       She have a beer with one of your buddies out in the woods. How are the fuck you do it? And just be like, yeah, you know, I, I don't encourage underage drinking. Whatever the fuck you did she give you guys do, that's when you vent.

Speaker 6:          01:09:28       Uh, what do you are you will, you have to do is every time it starts to scab over, she calls up or you call her and then you got an open wound again, but you gotta do what you got it. You got to heal like a fucking ex mat and then the next time you see her and a guarantee, if you don't give a fuck, she's going to fucking be all over you and want to hook up and this is what she have to do. You got to not do it. And then watch how quickly or that all that flirty turns into fucking anger. And then she's going to yell at you and then just be, keep it cool and be like, this is why I don't hang out with you cause y'all fucking crazy a ballet. Do something like that. And I would also ask some more adults who actually actually know the people involved in this story, including yourself. Okay. All right. Good luck to you. All right. Sister is obese.

Speaker 4:          01:10:14       All right.

Speaker 6:          01:10:15       Sister is obese. Dear freckles. Hoping you can offer some advice. My sister is and has always been on the heavy side. Oh that's sucks. But Shit has gotten out of hand. If I had to guess or body fat is easily 40 to 50%. I love her and I'm struggling to get through to her.

Speaker 4:          01:10:34       Okay.

Speaker 6:          01:10:35       Uh, you seem like you'd never hold back or sugar coat reality. Um, should I do the same in this situation? I don't want to send the poor girl into a whirlwind of emotions and maybe that's what,

Speaker 4:          01:10:49       okay.

Speaker 6:          01:10:49       But maybe that's what she needs. Thanks for the help. Oh, that's a big one, dude.

Speaker 4:          01:10:53       Okay.

Speaker 6:          01:10:54       Um, I don't know how old she is. I don't know. I don't know her. Um, yeah. How do you get somebody's daddy? Tell somebody, hey, tell your sister she's fat. Uh, let me see. Let's me just Improv a couple of scenarios here.

Speaker 1:          01:11:15       Acs I doing, did I mention you're overweight? That's too blunt. What has four limbs and needs to lose

Speaker 6:          01:11:24       85?

Speaker 1:          01:11:30       Uh, it's not good to joke about. Um, I don't know how you'd do it cause I don't know how fragile she is and I wouldn't want her to go more in that direction cause nobody wants to. Um, is there a way that you could just start cooking a little more healthy around the house and your producers or some stuff or maybe, uh, get her to start working out with you and maybe just go for a walk or something like that.

Speaker 4:          01:12:00       MMM.

Speaker 6:          01:12:01       Maybe just sit down. He had a great talk with her and find out what's going on with her and you don't bring up our weight.

Speaker 1:          01:12:08       Maybe you work on your relationship with her and then she opens up and maybe there's some sort of pain that's causing her to eat like that. I mean, that's like a psychological thing sometimes. Uh, from what I've heard on shows that I've seen where people actually know what they're talking about. So maybe you need to get like, uh, I don't know what your relationship is, but maybe if she feels comfortable opening up to you.

Speaker 4:          01:12:33       MMM.

Speaker 1:          01:12:35       Just ask her what's going on with her, how's she doing, how's she feeling? Blahblahblahblahblah and if she, you know, there's something going on with her. Maybe she lets that out and then baby, she brings it up and I hate how I look. And then you can be like, well, let's do something about it. You know, maybe try. I try that way, but I don't think I would bring up that she's fat. I wouldn't do that as much as I made those jokes. But this podcast is supposed to be funny and it's supposed to be fucking ridiculous. So I had, I had to do a cup. All right, what do you want from me?
