I got the one main gift. Then you have enough other shit to fill up the fucking area under the tree. It's so stupid. Um, I got to get her like one more thing and um, and then that's it. But other than that, I'm getting ready to go back east. Uh, I got to do some press here to hype. F is for family. What is that? You might ask if you've been under a fucking rock, not listening to my podcast for the last, I don't know how year it's coming out.

Speaker 2:          00:04:34       December 18th six motherfucking episodes on Netflix. You can watch all six. It took me four years to go through this whole journey and you can devour all of it and to two hours and 40, 45 minutes maybe. And then you could send me a tweet. What's an extra six coming out? Hopefully within a year or maybe a little more. Who knows who the fuck knows? Who knows if enough people watch it and get a second season. I don't know what that means. 10 12 I have no idea. Which is why if you go to my website, I only have one date for next year because I have to see if this thing, you know, tanks, if it makes it a what, you know, what are you, what are you gonna do, you know, this guy's looking this way, that guys are going that way and this gaze, they, what do you want from me?

Speaker 2:          00:05:19       So anyways, I'm sitting here in the end, the DFT finally finished basement of my fucking house and I am on my second attempt at smoking ribs and the big green egg is going down right now. And uh, so I am almost an hour and 55 minutes into a four hour smoke on these things. My temperature is still right at two 50. It got a little high in the, in the first hour. I get impatient before I lock it in and it went up as high as three, three, 10 and uh, it stayed there for a good 10, 15 minutes and I was able to bring it down to two 74. While now I'm at two 50. So I don't know what they're going to taste like, but I'm already doing better than I did the last, uh, the last time I tried this, my fire went out in an hour and a half, so an hour and a 55 minutes in. I'm still at two 50, so I went a little too high. But you know what's killing me is I, it's not smoking anymore. And the way the big green egg is, is set up. I can't like open it up and do all of that shit. It's not as, I should just get a fucking smoker, but it was smoking like a motherfucker.

Speaker 4:          00:06:23       Yeah,

Speaker 2:          00:06:23       no, it's fucked. Okay. You're old freckles up. Just [inaudible] a boy. Yeah. He came down every gay one thing or smoke rib thought he could do and she, you gotta be, you gotta be born down here. You gotta be born in the swamp, right? Your mother put on her back, maybe face down in that fucking swamp. Impregnating and you come out the same stank hole and, uh, that, you know, I smoke yourself some ribs. Um, yes, I am a novice and, um, I was disgusting and everything I Just said was absolutely disgusting considering I'm talking about food, you know, and the fact that it's so close to mother's Day, you know what I mean?

Um, so I dunno what happens this time I had, I had the blocks of Victor Hickory and that I also soaked a bunch of chips and I thought I put a zillion of them in there and uh, it will, they'll look at fucking house fire for the first 40 minutes and then, and now just nothing. So, um, I don't know what to do. I'm thinking to open it up and throw in some more chips in there. Uh, I don't know how I'm going to do it cause I got the plates center. I don't fucking know. But they,

I thought for some reason it was Thursday and the Bruins and playing the Canadians and uh, I went on the center ice thing and there was nothing on there. And then I checked ESPN and Lo and behold, the Boston Celtics have played the Chicago Bulls and I got to tell you something. I don't know the name of one player on the Boston Celtics. Ah, right. The Guy, he's got the ball, he's going in towards the painted area. The shot guy, a white guy and he kicked it back out to the black guy. Fucking mess. Blow the whistle.

I just said fucking pause right now. Should I just hit pause and just fucking tank this entire podcast? I can't, I have to keep fucking going. What the Hell is my laptop?

Sorry about that. I apologize for the first 10 and a half minutes to this fucking thing. White Guy with the fucking left hand floater does not go in.

Speaker 4:          00:14:17       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:14:18       Is a white dude over the white guy off the glass and then it's fucking unbelievable. And he's wearing one of those fucking windshield masks, you know what I mean? Like he wanted to be an ax murderer, but he couldn't commit to it. You know, he wants to get caught. I forgot that. I actually, I saw a movie. I saw a fucking face.

Speaker 4:          00:14:41       Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:14:42       Starring Brad Pitt, uh, Steve Carell, the guy from drive. What is his fucking name? He's in everything. Jake. Jaylen. Oh, is it Jake Gyllenhaal Miley Cyrus. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. I just saw the fucking movie. You know what it was? I didn't know it was him. He dyed his hair and, and a Christian Bale. I saw that movie, the big short. And, uh,

Speaker 4:          00:15:11       okay.

Speaker 2:          00:15:12       A buddy of mine got a screener of it and, um, I was watching it with my wife and, uh, she kept voice spring over to me. Go and try to explain this. You're going to explain this. I don't know what it was basically about the, uh, all the shit that led up to the, uh,

Speaker 4:          00:15:29       okay.

Speaker 2:          00:15:29       The big fucking what I would've fucked, whatever the fuck happened in 2007 it was called the big short, who is basically these guys bet against the banks. They basically bet that what was going to happen in 2007 was going to happen. They did it in like 2005 and all the bankers would just like, what are you out of your fucking mind? That could never happen. You know, that's basically what it is. And um, I actually, by watching it, I ended up having a great conversation with my wife, um,

Speaker 2:          00:15:58       about that. Cause I remember when that whole housing markets scandals and all that fucking subprime shit happened. Um, there was like two schools, there was either people that 100% blame. The bankers are people 100% blaming the fucking jerk off set. Got Houses, you know, like I remember this, the guy live like below me, right? This old fucking crazy guy, he blamed people, didn't have any money that got houses. Like he was flipping, I called those people, had no business tech knows houses there, had no business getting those loans. And I was just like, well yeah, that's, that's, that's kind of what you have a loan officer for, isn't it? I mean anybody could walk into a bank and be like, could I have $1 million? Right. You're, you're totally within your right to fucking do it. He just, you don't give it to them.

Speaker 4:          00:16:50       Yeah,

Speaker 2:          00:16:51       you're fucking do a little bit of research. But I, I'm one of those, I don't have any sympathy for the bankers or for the fucking jerk offs to fucking bought like a, a four bedroom house in their mortgage was like 80 bucks and they didn't read the fine print that like, you know, within whatever, seven months it was that good one crease up to like fucking eight grand a month or something. Nuts. And they look, well what happened? I'm shit out of luck. Yeah, you're a fucking dope. You know why I say that? Because I flunked everything in fucking pretty much everything in high school. I sucked it fucking math. I had to go to summer school. Like I should've gone every single year. I went after my freshman year and I went after my junior year, my sophomore year, my teacher hooked me up and gave me the d minus in my senior year.

Speaker 2:          00:17:40       I didn't give a fuck cause I already screwed up for three years. Was I going to go to summer school and get into Brown? It wasn't happening at that point. I was actually getting into construction, you know, I don't even know why. Cause I knew I was going to have to get a fucking job and I didn't want to really have a boss. Like I never wanted to have a job with like the boss was like fucking right there. Or I had a place to be like, sit right here at your desk. You, you, you come in here by eight 30 and you stay put until lunchtime. Right. And then you'd come back, you'd better be there by fucking whatever. What time is lunch? One to two, two a one. The guy's fucking coming around. I didn't like that. So I always try. I worked in a little bit in construction. I worked in warehousing. You know, he just had to be a general giant fucking area. You now there's places to hide.

Speaker 2:          00:18:31       Not like I didn't do the job, I just didn't like people fucking, you know, I, I don't, I don't like people telling me what the fuck do you know? So, um, anyways, yeah. So by my senior year I was like, I, you know, I don't give a fuck, but I sucked at math and I was able to figure out, um, mortgages enough to at least figure out how I was getting fucked and to reduce the fuck over as much as I could. And, um, the first time I, I went and I bought, I bought a, I bought a, that was it, a fucking 83 Ford ranger for like three grand. I had like 500 bucks to my name or something. So I take all 500 bucks. I put it down in the fucking car or something like that. I can't remember the numbers. And I took out a three year loan and I, it took me all three years, you know, I had like 36 payments and it took me 36 payments.

Speaker 2:          00:19:25       I made all of them on time and the bank got 100% of the amount of interest that they wanted to get off a dope like me, the entire three years that I had the car loan, it never dawned on me to maybe not go out drink and fucking a bunch of beers at night and actually take it some of that money and throwing it at the principal of the loan. I didn't know that you could fucking do that. I had no idea. And I ended up paying a ton of fucking money in interest. So fortunately somebody talked to me about it. You know, when I went to going to get a mortgage and I still fucked up when I first got a mortgage, I bought an apartment in New York and uh, I bought something that I could afford and I could, if I could afford the mortgage payment plus a little bit more.

Speaker 2:          00:20:08       So what? So the very first payment, I made the mortgage payment plus a little bit more. But the thing was I didn't put it in on the, I didn't fill in the right area on the mortgage statement where it says, uh, uh, basically mortgage and then it says principal. I didn't know that the principal was the actual like whatever, say I want a hundred grant, you know, I didn't know that that was called the principal. I had no fucking idea. So I kept putting everything into the mortgage. So within like four months, you know, all of a sudden I didn't get, I didn't get a statement for the fifth month. So I was like, what the fuck? What the fuck? I'm calling the bank. Oh, I knew I didn't get a statement. Oh, it's good on what's the color? And they were like, oh, you're, you're a month ahead on your payments.

Speaker 5:          00:20:55       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:20:56       And I go, what do you mean I'm a month ahead. I still get like a hundred grand. It's like, no, blah, blah, blah. And by them talking to me, I realized, I went back, look at the statements. I'm like, wait a minute, I've been paying like an extra 400 bucks.

Speaker 5:          00:21:05       Okay

Speaker 2:          00:21:06       a month here. And none of it has come off the principals cause I do. I wasn't putting that towards the principal and that's when I figured out, oh Ah, this is what I want to fucking do. I want to pay the mortgage and then take the other money. You put it at the fucking principle. Now a lot of you are rolling your fucking eyes, but the amount of people that go in and get a fucking house, it never realize that, okay,

Speaker 5:          00:21:28       okay.

Speaker 2:          00:21:28       Oh realize that they did they front end load the fucking interests. Like even I think, I think, isn't it like if you, if you, uh, even if you're 10 years into your mortgage, at that point, you've already given the bag 80% interest, 80% of the interests that they're going to earn on the money that they loaned you. Because basically when you buy a house, if you take 30 years to pay it off, whenever you took out, you're going to give the bank two and a half times that. So just to make it easy be took out to a hundred grand. You're going to pay back $250,000 all right. Now for as much as the banks are not fucking regulated for as much as they got the fucking houses back and they're going to do it all over again, you know, make complete fucking shitheads qualified for mortgages, right? As long as you, if everybody, if they could just educate everybody to that stuff, that whole fucking game, then people wouldn't get suckered into those things and then banks could try to do whatever the fuck they want it to do. Listen, if you're a dope like me, if you get a fucking mortgage like it, but isn't there a lawyer there to walk you through it?

Speaker 2:          00:22:38       I remember when I closed, I had a lawyer, right? He said I did in New York.

Speaker 5:          00:22:43       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:22:44       I don't fucking look. All I'm saying is watch that movie and then don't get all freaked while you should get freaked out because there's a bunch of mouse. Breathe in fucking morons out there.

Speaker 5:          00:22:54       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:22:54       Ah, Christ. Why did I watch that movie? It's so fucking depressing. Like, but what am I gonna do? Am My tells 50 people are going to do what I'm going to say right now.

Speaker 5:          00:23:02       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:23:03       Nobody gives a fuck. Right? He'll go on, you know, I'd go out and put $50 down on $1 million house and enjoy it and do some cannon balls into the fucking tool before they throw you out in eight months. That's what everybody's going to be doing again. Do I ever had anything optimistic to say about the future? It's really ridiculous. You would, you would, you would think during this time a year, the holiday season that I would think some shit like that. But um, for whatever reason I don't. Um, that was one thing that it got out of that and that movie, by the way, is fucking phenomenal. Steve Corral is, is amazing. Uh, the dude from drive, why can't I remember his fucking name? I think he's obviously phenomenal. Act. What the is wrong with me. All right. Brad Pitt. I'll get three and a four year and a Christian Bale. All amazing. The whole thing is great. And, uh,

Speaker 2:          00:23:58       I guess I'm depressed after watching it because in the, you know, you know the deal, you know, whenever you fucking watch something like that, I don't want to ruin the end of the blue. But she, you know how those fucking movies in those kinds of movies, movies that are deemed a powerful, you know, what do they predict? They always, you know, if they did and made a movie about fucking those dolphins, getting to fucking shit kicked out of him over in Japan. I never watched that. I didn't watch that fucking thing cause I didn't want to watch a bunch of dolphins getting beaten to death. It's just like, can you just tell me the address I need to send the money to so the opportunists can keep most of it in and get in fucking buy a yacht that he calls the dolphin or some shit.

Speaker 2:          00:24:36       And then maybe a couple of it goes to a porpoise. A couple of bucks goes over there. Can you just tell me what the fuck that is? Do I really have to watch the footage? You know, the horror of that. Can you just fucking tell me that's what they do and I'll, I'll, I'll be fine. Do you ever see like the trailer for that fucking Oh yeah. You know, all these fucking people that love watching gory movies, you know, saw it's fucking Frankenstein and Friday the third Tate's and fuck it, Jason goes to Freddy's camp versus the Predator or whatever the fuck it's called. You know, all you gotta do if you really want to see, fuck. You know, if that's not enough for you. Cause I would think if you're watching a horror films, it's gotta be like porn off, right? Where at first, the first time you watch a porn for the first time you see a, you see it, you're like, oh my God. And then that's it. It's over. It's over like 30 seconds. You might as well just spending like in a peep show or just hand crank and a fucking of view master. Yeah, you'd be fine. Be Somehow take it to your head so you can hand crank it while fucking Yank and you're fucking the ball joint down there. Right. Um,

Speaker 4:          00:25:39       okay.

Speaker 2:          00:25:39       Did after a while, you know, it's, you build up a little stamina like cardio because at the jerk it off, you know what I mean? So I would think, I would think that watching a horror movies would be the same thing. Like when you were a kid, you'd watch, uh, I don't know what the fuck you'd watch. You'd watch big bird fucking, uh, try to walk out. He hit himself on that Chin up bar and that, that made you feel bad for birds. I don't fight. I'm trying to think of I'll lame horror movie. What's a bad one?

Speaker 2:          00:26:11       I don't fucking know. Whatever where they would like the fifth installment of the killer bees number that, and they went all over that guy's Vw bug and he drove into the super dome and they turned on the air conditioner and then they all died. It's kind of ironic that they're all dying now because it's getting too hot. Right. Um, once again, bill, going back to fucking dude's Day gold back to doomsday, just shut the fuck up. Just enjoy, enjoy the holidays. Um, oh, by the way, that the pipe Piper's video should be out any day. Uh, I'm going to talk to Andrew tonight and I figured out exactly when that's coming out. I know he put out the fucking tray. Um, can you guys will get to see my ugly ass kitchen? Uh, if you wondering what those cupboards are, it's called knotty pine. Not Naughty, not like it's bad, bad pine.

Speaker 2:          00:27:02       It doesn't mean that it's naughty, like it has knots in it. And evidently that was all the rage at some point in the late eighties and early nineties. But uh, it has since fallen out of favor, much like a z cavalry cheese and fingerless gloves. But my kitchen is a, my kitchen is an old modge. Aw, Jesus Christ. That guy fell on his fucking ass and he shook it off. Good man. Black Guy, black guy with the ball. Good deal. Good deal. He's just Celtic. He's black. He's got the ball. I liked this. Don't pass the white guy. Tall. Pass it off. Eddie messed it. They must of course he fucking missed it. Of course he did.

Speaker 5:          00:27:43       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:27:44       The Fun. I mean, you know what I mean?

Speaker 5:          00:27:47       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:27:48       Jesus fucking credit. Yeah. Right there. Right there. Right down the other end. The court? Yes. Chicago just scored Chicago. Just go there to have their, a prob known who to pass too. I'm like literally reverse racist when I watched shoot now the white guy give it to the white guy again. Do you know one? Oh, well, so my were up by eight though.

Speaker 5:          00:28:06       Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:28:07       I'm going to shut the fuck up then. Maybe. And maybe my white guys are doing all right.

Speaker 5:          00:28:12       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:28:12       This has to be our second team in there.

Speaker 5:          00:28:15       Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:28:15       All right. A white guy just faked out another white guy and then took a shot at the top of the kid. Didn't go with it.

Speaker 5:          00:28:21       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:28:22       Is this like a charity game? I've never seen so many white guys out on a fucking court and basketball is, this should be like black and white.

Speaker 5:          00:28:28       Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:28:29       You know what the dribbling with the hand on top of the ball. Ooh. Um, was it talking about, oh, it's talking about the end of the world jerking off and fucking horror movies. Um, okay. Yeah, I was going to say, if you really want to see, uh,

Speaker 5:          00:28:45       okay.

Speaker 2:          00:28:46       Yeah. If you want to see something terrifying. Yeah, I would just watch,

Speaker 2:          00:28:51       just turn on the nature channel. What else? Fucking channel it is. Do you remember, remember these discoveries to fucking sit there talking about, you know, they always talking about the, uh, the animals, right? And all of a sudden they're not talking about animals anymore. Isn't that weird? That was their whole bread and butter. That's all they talked about was animals. Hey, today we're doing the cheetahs. It's fucking big cat week. They got that coming up, but it was dead. It was all it was, was about pretty much nature, nature. Right? That's all it was about. But you know, it was, I mean, I'm gonna base it on, on a guy, somebody like me. I stopped watching that fucking channel because I love animals. Right? And the first fucking three quarters of every one of those episodes was tremendous. And then the last third would be like, you know, this is what they would all be adorable. Look what they do. Look at them, their natural habitat. They do the damn dishes. Things I'll look at just killed another animal. That's how they survive. That's fucking amazing. And then in the end it was just like an a and then man came and fucking completely screwed up their entire environment. And then you'd sadly watched them dying next to an empty fucking plastic milk carton. You know what I mean?

Speaker 5:          00:30:04       Container

Speaker 2:          00:30:07       does carton say that it's cardboard, one of the giant gallon. Thanks. You know what I mean?

Speaker 2:          00:30:13       That's plastic fucker. Thanks. Right. Well you never had milk before. Fucking look at me like that. They'll look at your car radio like that. You asshole. Um, so I kinda stopped watching it but if people stop watching it because we came to fucking depressing because at this point they used to just do shit about bees. You know, in the human interaction be some guy would put bees on his face, right and have a beard. He have a bee beard right now they're going to talk about how they're dying off in an a photosynthesis. Does it happen? I was like, no more potatoes. I Dunno. Wants to watch that.

Speaker 5:          00:30:45       Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:30:45       My favorite thing now is that people still go in the fucking ocean and there's no fish left in. There's more and more shark attacks, and I think it's going to continue. When you watch how they vilified the sharks, you know, those somehow connect them to isis. You know what I mean? It's just going to be going to become all of that. Hey, when the sharks die off, are we going to make manmade once? I think that's what's going to happen in the future because if we're going to start making salmon, you know, if you could make one in one of those in a little mixer, you know what I mean? Take out your kitchen aid. Just get that DNA swirling around in there.

Speaker 5:          00:31:16       You know?

Speaker 2:          00:31:17       That's what we should be doing. We should be taking the DNA of all of them just like a, just like a in Jurassic Park where they were running out of beat. So I will fucking make some relax, you know, custom order, how many you need.

Speaker 5:          00:31:31       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:31:32       Oh, you let them loose. Just keep making the bees so it, you know, and then maybe they, they die a little quicker. We just keep making, but then, you know, whatever made the piece, whatever that fucking machine was, would cause even more global warming. I think we're fucked. You know what I mean? You know, the more I think about that, that's fucking lunatic that got everybody to drink the fucking grape juice, you know, down there in South America. I think he was onto something that maybe he wasn't a nut. Maybe he was just an environmentalist and he was walking around a mall one day and he was just like, you know what you're saying? Right. You know, and he went to a ball game. He's like, yeah, you know, I'm still not feeling it. You want the white neighborhoods, black neighbor, Asian needs you, you know, if you saw the people that you've constraints to kill themselves.

Speaker 5:          00:32:15       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:32:16       All colors, all creeds, all ages. This guy, Dee Dee, did a nice cleansing.

Speaker 5:          00:32:24       You know,

Speaker 2:          00:32:26       I'll tell you right now, you know, next time, one of those guys who, one of those Waco Texas guy goes a little fucking sideways or you know, they went live. See what happens. Let's see where it goes with this. All you gotta do is just surround them and then he'll do the dirty work, right? Hi Is, this is what you do. This is how you solve the population problem, okay? Instead of let nuts go on the fucking street, you know, you don't just take them out of the insane asylum because you don't want to pay for them anymore. What you do as you get him a suit, all right? And I don't know, you get them to start a religion or something. I don't know. I don't know what to do. Okay. As far as I can, I can know what this plant is. You'd let people out of insane asylums and he'd give them a brand new suit and like a briefcase, maybe like an iPad or some shit like that. Right. And then they get a fucking job. And uh, well, you know what, let's just start over again. Good. Looking and saint people regular in saint people, you just, you just put them out on the street the way that we do. You know what I mean?

Speaker 2:          00:33:23       And then he'd get mad going, why is this fucking asshole not obeying the, the, the Jay walking in the street, he go, oh my God, they're nuts. They're fucking crazy. You know? You know, look at that fucking, if a person's out of the fucking mine and you're literally in your car talking to yourself too, and he's not thinking it, you know,

Speaker 2:          00:33:40       is that how I'm going to end up? I mean, I might can be that person just talking to myself, doing that violent head shake every fucking 10 feet, walking up the street with a cart full of God knows what deal is. A Guy who sleeps on the sidewalk, um, it's fucking like, I was going to say, it's fucking, it's fucking hilarious that his face is so wind burned. Every time I look at them, it's like, wow, the giants finally fired Tom Claflin. And evidently he was not smart with his money. Sorry. Whatever. The Guy, he fucking leap booze. Is it up? You know, so it's a way to sync because you go down there and my dog always looks at it, the dude with like this, but then there's concerned, I get Doug knows when somebody is not a threat and is actually in trouble. So I, I've tried to talk to the person, but it never seems to work out.

Speaker 2:          00:34:26       They just sort of looks at me like I always feel like I'm freaking him out because he's sleeping on the street. Like I went, he thinks I'm gonna rob them, uh, do something bad. But what kills me about the Guy, he always sleeps on the same side. He sleeps on his left side right on his fucking shoulder. Okay. And what kills me is his head never touches the ground. He doesn't have a pillow. His head just goes straight out. You know what I mean? Like he got knocked out, you know, like we see a wide receiver getting knocked down. His fucking arms are sticking up. That's what he looks like, but with his head, and, uh,

Speaker 2:          00:35:02       I always take how sore his fucking neck is. So I'm thinking about getting him a pillow, but I never know when he's going to be there. And I'm not going to walk my dog carrying a fucking pill every day waiting to see this guy. And you know, for all I know I'm going to come walking up with a pillow. He's going to think that I'm going to try to smother them. Well, maybe he's too crazy to accept the pill. He starts eating it. Chokes on the fucking feathers. I don't know. But that's good for the bees. So that's good for the bees. All right. And I don't mean the Bruins,

Speaker 5:          00:35:27       right?

Speaker 2:          00:35:30       Maybe it's still positive way to look at the future as more and more people get fucking, you know, you just started looking at it. It's a good thing, you know, didn't Carl and talk about shit like that? That guy was so fucking far ahead of his time. I think he talked about that. And like the nineties like a joint disasters rooting for him to happen. You know, it's weird enough that I think that way when you actually have a kid that's, that's, you know, that's a whole other level of fucked up that I, that I actually have to respect on some level. Is that a half hour, 32 minutes? I right. I did it.

Speaker 5:          00:36:02       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:36:02       Jesus Christ. And now, right now it's 91 88 Boston, there's only two minutes. 32 seconds left. So an NBA time, it's at least 45 minutes over to the white guy from at first light up.

Speaker 2:          00:36:13       There you go. Black. I points that I'm like finally should have like 20 more assist you. Bearded fuck. 'Em All right. That's the Thursday afternoon.

Speaker 6:          00:42:47       gets me Jesus Christ with it. Okay. I want to ask you some questions. Ask it. I'm 25 years old and had been married for two years to a great woman. No kids yet. Uh, we live very close to all of her family, parents, grandparents, cousins, all of them. Oh Jesus. Yeah, absolutely. That can be a fucking nightmare. All right. You better. You better have the ground rules down. All right. It'd be like, listen, I know your family fucking lives right around the corner, but this is my fucking house. All right? It's my fucking house. They only come around on the holidays for not just show up like Kramer on Seinfeld. It's nothing to be be none of that 20th. Anyways, her is planning this big three day long family reunion this summer. And as much as I love my wife, I would rather take a shit on a hooker's toilet then go to this thing.

Speaker 6:          00:43:39       Yeah, absolutely. Dude, you surrounded by them. I spend far too much time with their family as it is. And worst of all, I think it might conflict with when you come to do a show in my hometown, I told her today that have for you reunion is the same weekend that you come to town. That I will just have to skip the reunion. Good man. Uh, she let me have it for about how important it is to her. This is what they do. This is what they do. Um, how her family comes first. And if I was a good person, I would go to the reunion and then she started to cry. Oh Dude, she hit you with both barrels, both barrels. Dude, this is all fucked up. I'm actually going to whisper in, my lovely woman is fucking four states away. I had this fucking argument. I had this argument fucking a week ago. All right. Uh, oh my God, he got to get to the post. You got to get to the mailbox first and look for those fucking wedding invitations, all right? And you get that and you just rip it up and fire it over the fucking fence. All right. I didn't do that. All right. I saw it. I knew it was an invitation is she gets his fucking invitation to go to a goddamn wedding.

Speaker 3:          00:45:00       Okay?

Speaker 6:          00:45:00       All right. In the middle of fucking nowhere. All right. And I said, I'm not going. I'm not going. And then she starts telling me how important these people are to her. And I said, give me a fucking break. They're important to you. I've never heard you say their names. I don't even recognize these names. How can this be important? How can they, and then she, and then she starts faith. She just did the exact fucking same thing. Short of the crime, you know, I would think that you would want to go with this to me is important and blah, blah, blah. It's like, sweetheart, I spend my life in airports, on airplanes. I don't want to go to one extra fucking thing. Okay. Tell him to put it on Skype and I'll sit there and watch it with you. I don't want to fucking go to it. Right.

Speaker 6:          00:45:51       Let me ask you to do we ask them to go to any shit. Like I would never drag my girl to a football game. She hates it. But I sit there. This is really important to me. Then you are a good person. You go until gang get truck with me. It's fucking ridiculous. I don't want to go. So anyways, and then she started to cry. He said, I have got a lot of a lot of this shit since they got married. Yeah, I could tell you that too. Cause you're 25, you know, you're 25. If you're 25, when you get fucking married, a woman is going to be 10 years beyond you just knowing how to fucking roll over you in a relationship. But not all is not lost. All is not lost. Let me finish this. Um, if anything happens in her family, I have to be there.

Speaker 6:          00:46:37       Even if it's as small as their cousin graduating from the third grade. I'm sick of it. I mean, I really hate doing stuff like this. She knows I don't like it, but if I was just a flat out teller, I hate it. It would break her heart. All right, so you're a decent guy. Okay. I would hate to do that because she's my wife and I love her. All right. See you. Good guy. Thinking about her. Okay. Oh, and I see my family and I see my family about once a year since they live on the other side of the country. She just doesn't understand that I did not grow up in a family where we spend a ton of time together. So Shit, shit, life, family reunions, uh, doesn't mean that much to me. I feel like those ladies should understand that if I miss one weekend with them to see my favorite comedian who I might not get a chance to see again in a very long time, then that's all right. How do I let her know how I feel and get to give me some space and not crush my balls about going to all of her family stuff. Um, all right. Do, this is what you do. Your head, your heart, your heart's in the right place. You don't want to hurt her, okay?

Speaker 3:          00:47:42       Okay.

Speaker 6:          00:47:43       And I'm going to kind of side with your wife on this one in that,

Speaker 6:          00:47:47       not really sagging with her, but you pick the wrong one to put your foot down on. All right? What she had to do is put your foot down on, you know, little Mikey just made his first fucking popsicle stick house. We all have to go over and look at it. That's something that you could blow off, like a major family reunion. You kinda got to go to that. You gotta be by his side. Okay? So that she can prove that. See, I got one. He loves me. Right? So this is what you, what you are right now, you're in a great position to barter, okay? Because you're going to make the sacrifice and not seeing my shell. Okay? So this is what you tell him. Just say, listen, my favorite comedian is coming to town. Just like you said, I might not get another chance to see him, but because this is so important to you, I want to be there for you. So I will go. Okay. And she'll say, great, thank you. And then you say however.

Speaker 3:          00:48:45       Okay.

Speaker 6:          00:48:46       All right. This is when you barter and just say all this. I don't know how to say this eloquently cause I just have to get to the point. All this fucking bullshit. These conti little stupid ass fucking things. I don't give a fuck about you. I don't want to go to him anymore. Okay. I work all day. I come home. I want to chill out. I don't know your family. I don't know. I married you. Okay. You want to go to the, you know the Oscars or your family reunion. I will go to that shit. Okay. You dad gets a new colostomy bag. I'm not showing up to that. I am not going to all of them. I will go to some major ones. I will go to Christmas time. I'll put on the sweater. Alright, but this fucking 24 seven all the fucking time Susie.

Speaker 6:          00:49:34       Fuck face is having a birthday party. I'm not going to it. I'm staying home and I'm watching the game. Okay. Because it's making me miserable and I want to be happy with you. All right? And this is the thing, she might give you shit about that, but no, you got it. You got to put your foot down and let her cry about it. All right. And just say this isn't fair to me. This isn't fair to me, that all of my free time involves being with your family. All right? I don't know how you say it, dude. You got to figure out how to say it's fucking boring. Good Lord going over there. I don't like the smell of their house. I don't like their food. I don't like the color of their plates. I just want to get the fuck out of there. I'm not comfortable.

Speaker 6:          00:50:15       You are go over there. They're prompt. They probably don't even like you go on over there. You know they want their girl over there so fucking go over there. So that's what I would do. Um, just, just play game. All right? My show is important to you, is that fucking thing. So why don't you, why don't you cry? No, I can't do that. But you know what I'm saying? Just flip it around and just be like, all right, well, I want you to know that I'm missing my favorite fucking comedian to go to this thing. Okay? And I will go to this thing, okay? But from here on out, I am only going to the major ones, okay? Because I love you. I support you. But this ticky tack fucking Horse Shit. That's all you. I'm not, I'm not doing that, okay? Because I need a life outside of this, outside of your family. All right? Go for it. Self love you. Love you buttons. I'll see you later. How's that? Does that work?

Speaker 7:          00:51:42       They're built.

Speaker 6:          00:51:49       Well, I met you after show in Pittsburgh, the black guy with the hot. Let Tina, we laughed about my shoes, matching my outfit.

Speaker 6:          00:51:59       Well, my beautiful girlfriend for the past three years as a little bit of insecurity, insecurity issues. Uh, a lot of those are absolutely gorgeous women. Do you know why it is? It's because their level without even reading this shit, the reason why I think a lot of them are fucking insecure is because, because of beautiful and that goes away after a while. So the clock is just fucking ticking. You know, if you would just some regular douche bag like me, there's no pressure going back to your fucking high school reunion. I mean the expectations is so fucking low, you know, it's easy to just surpass him. Like, oh Geez, he didn't get fat. Sky's awesome.

Speaker 6:          00:52:42       But if you're a fucking hot chick, it could just, it could only go downhill. And I also think that they have the same insecurity a rich guy has what a rich guys like. This woman's just with me because of my money, not because of who I am. I think that they have the insecurity. This person is just with me because of my ass today. Hayes. Hi. All right. For summary. Odd Reason. She feels the need for me to prove to her that I love her whenever we're in a public setting. So recently during some Christmas shopping, uh, she got upset that I wouldn't hold her hand as we walked through the mall. She proceeded to catch one of the, one of her spicy Latin attitudes with me. Um, see now if you were white and you said that, and you said that on TV, you would have to apologize for nine weeks when you lose your job, why does it have to be spicy? Are you saying that lat to, you know, people are like their peppers. Um, all right, I'm gonna stop commenting and just plow through this. Okay. So I handle, handle the situation like a g parenthesis gentlemen and completely ignored her ass, um, until we got into the car. And I finally had enough of her telling me how I don't love her and how she wants me to love her. Oh, I don't love her. How she wants me to love her and are unaffected unit of a man. I am.

Speaker 6:          00:54:07       And you know what, dude? That right there is probably how you got this hot girl because you weren't the first guy. He's sitting there with your tongue hanging out of your mouth. You acted like you didn't even give a fuck, which fed into her and security of like, oh my God, is the expiration date hit? Am I not hot anymore? Um, look at me commenting again. All right. I swear these bitches are so unappreciative. Unappreciative as, it's funny. You call them pictures. What? Can't these bitches understand how much I appreciate this. Uh, every weekend bill, we do something, dinner, movies, plays, et Cetera. But because she has a vantage, she has to find something to complain about. I think it's because women have this trait where they feel a strong need to be miserable. No, dude, you know what's going on is you're spoiling her.

Speaker 6:          00:54:53       You're taking her to dinner. Movies plays every fucking weekend. She, now she's come to expect it. You know what I mean? It's just become part of a routine. It's not special anymore. So now you have to do something extra special. Cause special. Is it special? You know, that's what I, I, you know what? I'm gonna have to whisper this shit. We were up in San Francisco, right? I lit up. My credit card says Christmas. All right. My girl had a great fucking Christmas. All right, it's three days later, we're up in fucking San Francisco. She wants to go shopping. I'm like, for what? You didn't get enough, you know, so she knows him. Right? So what does she do? She tells me she wants a goddamned candle. Okay. Because it's not expensive, but she'll still feel like she got something because I don't know what it is.

Speaker 6:          00:55:39       They always get a fee. They always got to get stuff is there. He's got to be some sort of a goody bag. And you know what? I wouldn't get it for, I wouldn't get it for like a, you'd done? No, I'm not. It's over. My credit cards are still glowing. I'm not getting you shit. And you know, she's cool as hell. So she just kept laughing because I was being unbelievably rude and I was being really loud. I was just joking around and uh, but still, that's the thing. And I just kept saying, I spoil you. Um, you know, we're shutting it down for a while. You're not getting anything until Valentine's Day. You know, you want something now I'll get you a little bag of Fritos. What do you think about death? Maybe something to wash it down with.

Speaker 6:          00:56:23       And then what they do is they immediately get mad and then all you do is you don't take the bait. They want you to get mad. So then they can turn it into a fight about something else because they know you're fucking right. All right? So let it be met. All you gotta do what? You just got to stay fucking comp. Well, let's see what this guy does. Uh, so anyways, he goes, so we are driving along the highway, leaving the mall and she's still bitching. And finally I tell, uh, you know what, if you don't like the way I express my love for you, then step off, uh, got to read that quote like a black man. I can't, I'm not even going to try to, uh, so immediately I actually read that. I read that like a Douchey east coast white guy. That fucking step off.

Speaker 6:          00:57:07       Uh, how did you fuck off bitch? I was at, was that good? I know it wasn't well that don't ask me to do it. Alright, plowing ahead. You know what? I might have like a fucking substitute black guy. Four black guys. Write some shit in here so you guys can read it the way you supposed to say it. Other than that, you're getting fucking a crack, harass, read, and you're going to have to live with it. All right? So immediately after that I said, after I said that this bitch starts throwing these accurate and quick ass. Paki Oh, combos. She's punching you. Mind you, I'm doing 65 miles per hour down the highway, trying not to hit the guardrail while at the same time getting this crazy bitch off me. Luckily I didn't crash my year old Mercedes. This guy's hilarious. Come on dude. Do you love this girl? She just another accessory. Um, my year old Mercedes with the Corinthian leather, uh, I get pulled over, I get pulled over or God forbid, seriously injure us. I mushed the hell out of her and held her face against the passenger window. Totally acceptable. Totally. The Mush is the gentleman move. You can't punch her. You just hold their head up against the glass, you know, so the people on the other side gets to see what her face looks at a fun House Mirror

Speaker 6:          00:58:30       in order to decrease her reach while steering the car on the highway and absorbing her manly combos. Got to give it to her. The bitch had a mean. Right. Um, so if you can picture me driving, I can totally picture this dude. I've lived this. Um, so you can picture me driving down the highway in a bright red Mercedes. Okay. Not, I didn't have a, had a Mercedes. It was more than a 83 Ford ranger with black vinyl seats.

Speaker 6:          00:59:01       Swerving like some drunk in and out of lanes, steering with one hand and stiff arming the shit out of my girls if I'm posing for the Heisman trophy. After she stopped beating my face in, she had the nerve to say I hit her. It hurt her worse by pressing her face against the glass. Are you fucking kidding me? This bitch took both of our lives. Long story short. As soon as I was able to come to a safe and complete stop, I kicked a bitch out and haven't heard from her since. This was three weeks ago, and it's all for the best. That type of girl can never be satisfied, which is something I've learned the hard way over the past three years. But this was the straw that did it. So my question for you is, was I wrong in this situation and do I owe her an apology?

Speaker 6:          00:59:46       No and no. All right? All you can do is break down your game plan. All right? This is where you fucked up. You took the bait, all right? She kept pitching and pitching and pitching and pitching, trying to make you mad. She was torn. She got you to do exactly what she wanted you to do. So that gave her an a, an excuse to do what she wanted to do, which was fucking flip out and yell, all right? That's what they do when they know they don't have a fucking leg to stand on and they know they're wrong. What they then try to do, you know, not all of them and not in every situation, but when then they're not going to be an adult and just say, you know what? You're right. I'm being fucking crazy right now. I apologize. Okay. When they're not going to take that adult route, what they then do is they just push your buttons and they just try to make you mad and they just keep pushing you and pushing it and pushing it and pushing it until you then flip out and say something fucking crazy like, well, if you don't like it, then why don't you get the fuck out?

Speaker 6:          01:00:55       And then they flip out. All right? So what you got to do is in the future is you just don't take the bait. You've got to recognize, you know they're doing, they're doing the fucking Dennis Rodman thing to you, the Beighton you into a penalty. That's all they're doing. Okay. And the ref always sees the retaliation. That's basically, it's the same fucking thing. So when the future just don't get mad, it will drive them up the fucking wall and you won't believe the amount of argument she can to start winning because in their effort to piss you off, they're going to cross like 10 of the lights. All right? Now when they cross 10 other lines, if you take the bait and then go even further down the road, that's all that's remembered in the end. As you then try and piece together who said what when, but if they go, if they cross 10 lines and you don't take the bait, they attend lines beyond where the fuck they should be and you got him dead to rights and you just have to maintain your fucking cool.

Speaker 6:          01:01:56       Now getting back to this other shit is you do not own her fucking apology. All right? It's absolutely fucking ridiculous. It's absolutely childish and you can't as an adult expect somebody to not hit you if you're hitting them all right? She's basically asking you to, we can extend a common human to human courtesy that she's not extending to you so she can go fuck herself. You definitely, I don't know if you made the right move. I don't know if you walk around calling her a bitch and that type of thing. This is you just trying to be a tough guy going in. This bitch said this and this, you know, this bitch said that. Uh, that's another thing. Don't go around calling a bitches cause that Dee Dee, that just kills your og. Don't have a call of bad names. All right? Just hold your ground. Don't lose your fucking cool and let them go through their whole little fucking history. Onyx trying to get you to take the fucking bait. All right? And as long as in the relationship, you admit when you're wrong and you sincerely apologize, they don't have a fucking leg to stand on when you're right and you're going to start winning arguments and you're going to be happier. There you go. Alright. And other than that, I dunno. Stopped dating site.

Speaker 4:          01:03:27       Take it easy for the break of day that swim up the window crying. It won't do no good. Oh, come back.

Speaker 7:          01:03:51       Hi Vic. How to help myself. I won't mistreat chew. We have no one now tell me Barry, but once you're trying to do,

Speaker 6:          01:04:12       I didn't have a fucking party for a new place. You don't. You think that was my idea. Do you think it was my idea to have a bunch of strangers come into the fucking house? I'll have people over. That's what I do. Hey, you want to come over and watch the game? Nine people that I know, right? Have all your fucking phone numbers. You don't. Nia is a more open person. So she's like, let's tell him a party. All right, so we still, she goes, invite your friends. So I'm all right. So you know I got, you know, I'm a, I'm a guy, I don't have a bunch of friends. Okay. I got six good friends for that I could really trust, you know, it's about it, at least out here. Then over here in Nia, talking to her mom about all excited about the party and she's like, yeah, I sent it on a Facebook and I was just like, oh my God, did I just invite 110 people?

Speaker 6:          01:05:06       And my heart literally sank going, please tell me you didn't just invite 110 fucking people. She's like, don't worry, they're not all going to show up. It's like, yeah, but like a third wheel. And then they're going to bring people that you don't even fucking know. And that's exactly what happened. It was a fucking great party. I'm not going to lie to you, but I got to admit like I got to learn how to and be. I thought I was going to be a good host. I was and I wasn't. I was all right with the people I knew. But the people I didn't know, uh, they actually, most of them are all right, but there were a couple of them. I just find it just sends you something fucking annoying about somebody you don't know. Sitting on your God damn couch, you know, eating your food, drinking your booze.

Speaker 6:          01:05:48       He like Hula Food of fuck are you, it's somebody else was laying down on the floor. I felt like the kids' Dad, I want to make, get them get a fucking job, right? It's over. You're 26 she fucking pump. So anyways, so the party is going great. And uh, I'm basically the whole time, you know, not drink it too much, but I'm standing by the front door cause that's the only way up. All right? And nobody's walking out with any of my shit, right? I'm acting basically like psycho in fucking stripes. It's how I am. It's how I'm wired. All right? So a fucking three quarters the way through the party, everything's going great. And I'm like, wow, this is I, you know what? I forgot. I forgot. I'm not 21 anymore. I'm fucking 43. All my friends are adults and everybody's drinking responsibly and no one's really hammered.

Speaker 6:          01:06:35       Nothing got broken, everything's cool. So start just as I was starting to relax, some kid comes up to me, he's like, Eh, Eh, you own the house. And I'm like, well, the bank owns it. I'm fucking painted it off. What can I do for you? And he's like, uh, yeah, it's kind of embarrassing. But a, I used the bathroom downstairs and uh, it's clogged now. And I was wondering if he had a plunger. And I was like, yeah, I do have a plunger. I got a plunger right here, the upstairs bathroom. So I give it to the guy and I, and I say, man, I appreciate your honesty. He goes, no problem. He goes downstairs, he takes care of it, comes back, he wants again. He goes, he goes, sorry about that. I said, not at all, not at all. What the fuck to toilet, you know, clogs up every once in a while.

Speaker 6:          01:07:20       But I appreciate it. I appreciate your honesty. You know, cause that would have been nasty. Good for you. Right. So, uh, now the couple of hours goes by, the party ends and there's like one straggler left. And I tell the story to knee. I'm like, yeah, I want to go. What a good guy. What a good shit. No Pun intended. You know, he could have left it in there. And then the other party I come walking in my fucking bathroom looks like a Goddamn Port Authority bus station, toilet, you know, so I was psyched. So, so one of the strategies of the party goes, yeah, he goes, I saw that whole thing go down. That's not exactly how it went down. Like what he talking about. He goes, he goes, it wasn't him that was in the bathroom. And I go, who was it? He goes, it was his girlfriend some way, took a dump of a magnitude that it wouldn't go down the toilet.

Speaker 6:          01:08:15       So now she's in there panicking and this is what today's technology kicks in. She could back in the day, she would have had to crawl out the fucking window and hope nobody saw her and just left the door locked. Everybody would have panicked. Holy Fuck. Who's in there? Did somebody pass out? If somebody, if somebody committed suicide, someone woulda kicked in the door, alright, knocked it off the fucking goddamn hinges and you go in there, that'd be nobody in there. You'd feel the air from outside. And then look down and everyone would see a giant shit and be like, as a party would be over and the owner of the house would be walking around going, okay, you better drive away. Right. That's how it would have ended. But because of today's technology, not saying she didn't panic, you know it's even worse. There's a lady, cause they're not even supposed to do stuff like that. Right. And she was able to text her boyfriend and I would fucking pay at least $400 to read those texts, the panic in those texts. And to his credit, he fucking, he stepped it up. He took the hit, he came up to me, VH ones. I love the eighties own Belper and said, I took a dump when your toilet to a magnitude, it didn't go down. And I need the tools required to alleviate this situation.

Speaker 6:          01:09:45       So Anti Douche bag of the week, that guy right there. So taking a fucking bullet for the team that, that right there is the reverse Peyton manning award. He didn't fucking go, we had protection issue, right? No, he took one. He took one for the fucking tape, went upstairs like a Goddamn gentlemen asked for a plunger, gave it to him, and it was all fine. And I went down there at the end of the party, you never would've known anything, anything happened. You know what I mean? Like, uh, you know, three hours after the Kennedy assassination. I bet it was. It was all, I'm say it, you know, marked it all up and everything was all figured out it, but it was a nice road. Again, mopped up the brain.

Speaker 4:          01:10:31       What am I talking about? [inaudible].
