Speaker 1:          00:00:01       Hey, what's going on is bill burr and it's time for the Thursday afternoon, Monday morning podcast just before Friday. And Ah, just checking it out. Yeah, I can't do it guys. My fucking voice is shot. I've been on the road again for fucking two weeks. Just about two weeks coming up on two weeks where we were in Chicago here. Beautiful Chicago, one of the most underrated cities out there. You know what I mean? Just as far as the sheer size of it. And everybody talks about New York. Everybody talks about La. Everybody's always going on and on about De Moines, you know, but it's really, you know, it's fucking view. What are the fucking city has these kinds of views, you know, right on the water is not a lot of major cities like this. You know, that sit on the wall, sit on a lake. How about that?

Speaker 1:          00:00:53       That'll make it unique. They sit on a lake, it's fucking beautiful. You know what I mean? This is what Detroit will become some day. It's coming back to slowly coming back. Cleveland's crushing it. That's when I found out about this, uh, this part of the country, man, all these, these, uh, I think that whole rust belt things going to go away. You know, they're not going to have that slogan anymore. But anyways, last night, uh, we were in Minneapolis had a great fucking time. Um, first show is a little bit rough. Jesus Christ, you know, I dunno what the fuck it's the first time I've snapped on stage and so fucking long. Um, you know what I mean? Just this fucking lady just talk and talk and talk and talk and talk and, and it's like, I don't give a shit. I'm still going to get paid. But I know people around paid to hear the fucking show.

Speaker 1:          00:01:37       They didn't pay to hear me go on and on it. And she was living at one point, standing up, yelling at me, you know, it's doing some bit trash and fucking women. I mean, it's what I do. You know what I mean? I trash them. I have fun doing it. I'm allowed to do it as a comedian and it doesn't affect anybody's life. Fucking lunatic, you know? And the more you yell at me, then the more I'm going to do it because debts then it becomes funny. If you just shut up, it'd be, it'd be over in like two seconds. So she's standing up screaming and yelling at me. Right? Like I give a fuck and I'm yelling back at her, you know, and the security is so funny that just sorta daintily going, miss, Miss, you have to sit down and miss. You have to sit down.

Speaker 1:          00:02:18       And I was joking. How if that was a guy, he'd be in a choke hold getting dragged out into the fucking alley. You know what I mean? Um, and uh, finally in the end they were finally gonna throw her out. She was living at one point miming rubbing her pussy with a tongue hanging out. Um, like that was going to shock me. It was just like, I've been doing the road for like 20 years. He can have to do a little better than that. Um, I just did not, I don't know if she just was a, uh, maybe she was drunk. I don't know what her deal was. But, um, you know, she decided to take some joke seriously and felt that it was, she needed to stand up and start screaming and yelling. So that happens. Right. And I finally just snap in the end because, um, it was just the first show was just weird. Like they had the front three rows were within the spotlight that you stood on. So they were, is lit up is I was, and then the rest of the theater was completely in the dark and I couldn't see them. I couldn't see any of the fucking theater. So I felt like I was performing to like, you know, 20 people. It was weird. And um, I dunno, it got a little sideways there towards the end.

Speaker 2:          00:03:32       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:03:32       And uh, they will finally going to fucking kick her out. The guy finally is politely going to kick her out cause she, cause she's a lady and uh, I said, no, don't kick her out. Don't kick her out. Just let us sit there and act like a baby was absolutely no ramifications the way she's been allowed to her whole life. I mean, her behavior was so fucking immature. You know, and then what kills me is the end of the fucking shallow, right? I'm going through the tweets. I'm just making sure that people in the dark, he still had a good time. Right. Um, which stays were saying they were and they actually people military Minneapolis who fucking cold is there. They Will Paul, sorry for that lady, Blah Blah was still a good time. So I felt good about that. Right. And then some woman had tweeted at me, um, you know, heckling is never a good idea, but you know, being subjected to 40 minutes of sexist and original material, Yada, Yada, all this fucking bullshit. Right. First of all, I love how she addresses somebody's not shutting the fuck up for an entire show. 70 minutes. She just said, dre, she takes care of that with [inaudible] is never a good idea. Now that I've addressed that, and then she exaggerates, it wasn't 40 minutes. That's sexist material. It was like 12.

Speaker 2:          00:04:54       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:04:54       And I thought it was pretty original.

Speaker 1:          00:04:59       Um, anyways, but we had the fucking best time, um, in me, I still had a good time on that fucking show. And sell right to the end. But then I felt good because this woman backstage, you know, that was running shit back then. I was saying, Hey, look at this tweet and I just gotta go do it. Does it? Am I that fucking bad? And she goes, look, he goes, I live alone. I got daughters. It's all women, the house. I'm pretty independent. I didn't have a problem with anything that you said. I thought it was funny and you're always going to get one of those at the show. And I was like, thank you. Thank you. And then I went out. I had a great fucking time on the second show and it got off stage. I fucking gave her a hug, you know? Thank you. I needed to hear that from a lady. Right? Oh my God. That fucking fucking woman. She was a loan. A tick standing up. Who the fuck is dumb enough to get that mad at a comic that you're standing up yelling? You know, like at some point I'm going to go, oh yeah. You know what? That's a good point. I am. I'm sorry. Let me, uh, let me fucking Redo my whole act now just for you because you don't seem to be enjoying it. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:06:09       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:06:10       Uh, you know, in a perfect world, you know.

Speaker 3:          00:06:13       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:06:13       Ah, no, I'm not even gonna say it was fucking me. Whatever. What happened? Let me just let me get out. So I'll maybe talk about the great time that we had in Minneapolis. So I've gone there last six times. I've gone there. I've wanted to go get the juicy Lucy fucking burger that they have, right. Just basically they put the cheese in the patty and then it melts in his fucking piping hot and all the tourists fucking bite into it and burn their fucking mouth. Right. So we finally, we have barely enough fucking time cause we were driving in from a up from Milwaukee. So it was a long ass fucking drive, like six, seven hours. It was rain and sleet knowledge shit. So we literally just dropped the bags in me, Eh, and Farsi and this other body of eyes. We fucking jump in this car and we fucking drive over to this. Uh, I think it's, is it match? I kept calling it Mike's, I think his match match bar, I believe. Um,

Speaker 3:          00:07:02       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:07:03       Hang on, hang on, let me look it up. Where are we? I write what the text messages. I only have it on fucking soft and it's still fucking

Speaker 3:          00:07:12       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:07:13       Go into settings and find mute your whole view. Go into settings. You can't, um, the hell is it. Come on, you scroll and Scroll and Scroll and Scroll and bup. Bup, Bup Matt Smith's bar. That's what it would fuck. We went right now I'm going to go all these fucking tweets from people going, oh, you shouldn't go to fucking cookies in fucking Saint Paul. I didn't have time. I went to the closest one and it was fucking delicious. Char Broil Burger. And we, we go there and the lady was nice. The lady, she goes, hey guys, she goes, nibble around. She saw it, you know, you know for his, he had a Yankees hat and my other buddy at a mets hat, so you know, I look like a fucking jerk off says, and they knew we weren't from there. Right. So she goes, uh, just make sure you're nimble. That cheese is hot, right? So maybe the other guy, that's what we do first. He fucking thanks. He's nibbling, but he's so fucking hungry bites right into the cheese and he just goes, he's like spitting it out, right? So before I can laugh at them, he fucking takes another book just as deep and he's going like, we fucking crying, laughing boy, for what the fuck is wrong with you? He goes to, what the fuck? She said to take a nibble. I took it and said, no, you tend, you took half a bite.

Speaker 3:          00:08:24       Okay,

Speaker 1:          00:08:24       you just Italian do. You don't know how to nibble. You fucking stuck in your mouth. You fucking jerk off. And he goes, boy did I go this second bite. He bedded so deep, he pulled out half the pickle, burn the shit out of his mouth and we will fucking cry and laugh and tease the shit out of him. He kept trying to blame the waitress.

Speaker 3:          00:08:43       Yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:08:43       each app trying to blame the wedge. It sounds just like, hey, you know, we didn't have a problem. We completely understood it. We didn't burn our mouth. I was joking last night, he sounded like he was hitting a heavy bag like ha, I've been dreaming about getting up to fucking sandwich every time I go there. And that was the big thing. I was thinking, I had like a game plan. I was like, yeah, cut it in half and I'll let it melt. The big thing is, is once you actually bite into it a little bit, it's still gonna be a little hot. But uh, once that air gets on the cheese, it really, it kind of, it's almost like a blows through the whole Burger and then a fucking cools it off and then you're able to completely enjoy it. And I'm totally 100% lived up to the hype.

Speaker 1:          00:09:26       Even Versie after he burned his fucking mouth. Ha Ha. Um, he, he even, he's still fucking a joke. It's just a great burger. So thank you to people there at match bar full, hooking us up, uh, hooking us up by just being open. They didn't give it to us for free, can't just me. You know what I'm saying? So, um, and the day before we were in Milwaukee, now that great fucking city and uh, played the Riverside theater and that might have been a, that was right up there with fucking Indianapolis as far as like the crowd just being right on top of you. And uh, we had one of the, you know what I was steered or does it just has the fucking magic man. It was fucking awesome. And upstairs they had a, this crazy green room and they had a chef up there who made the salads with all this stuff was fucking on it. Got I got treated like rock stars and then as flat screen TV and we watched the, uh, the royals come back and beat the mets for game one. I missed all the game too. But um, I know people are freaking out. And of course I, as a red sox fan, I'm immediately thinking, well, the mets were down o two, an 86. And I remember how that one turned out. That has our little roller it out of Buckner.

Speaker 1:          00:10:42       What does it say? [inaudible] with a bag between the bag. I want to, I can't even remember how it goes anymore. And mads when it, that's what you remember how it ended. You know what's funny about that fucking clip now is now, it's just hilarious to me because thank God we finally won it and then we got two more for good measure. So now when I watch it, I just, I just, it's just funny to me now.

Speaker 3:          00:11:08       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:11:08       The fucking, the disappointment that that was was just funny. How the fuck did you get it? There's a little roller up the field. I'll get to pass Buckner and the match went, ah, that's what it was. Jesus Christ. That still hurts to say that. You know, it's the funniest thing is when nights scores, he's fucking running at one point. He puts both his hands on his head. To me, that sums up the whole game. That was literally like, I can't, I can't fucking believe these guys. Just fuck that game up. Um, you know, forget Buckner fucking Bob Stanley just comes waddling in deck guy. He wasn't a, he wasn't even in beer league softball shape. Fucking horrible comes fucking walking in, you know, besides that, we let them, you know, they came back and be, I can't remember, we were like up by like fucking three runs or something, something crazy. And then in the bottom of the ninth, we will one fucking strike away. And I swear to God, I feel like we let up 17 singles in a row. They just kept getting hits and can't get it. Kept getting heads. And then the past bald tied it up.

Speaker 1:          00:12:22       Oh my God. You're just sitting there like this isn't real. They count a cow. Could you fuck this up? Gets passed back gear and their mats weight. Oh man, that'll toughen you up. As a sports fed. Jesus grow. We went up three nothing. And the next game. I was too, too young as a red sox fan at that point. I still had hope. I was just like, I am a fucking one. That one kind of fuck did I get on that? Oh, that's right. I said we were in Milwaukee. So anyways, um, before we went there, we've actually found a steam room. Right. So me and [inaudible] will walking up the street and the guy fucking at the hotel we were staying at and I was like four blocks up the street. So first it comes out of the hotel, you know, versus he's one of those backpack guys.

Speaker 1:          00:13:07       Like he, he does not bring luggage and he just, I dunno, I dunno how he gets it all in there. So his, his wardrobe options are very limited. So he's walking down the street, right? He's got on dark socks in the flip flops that he's going to wear, the sandals that he's going to wear in the fucking, uh, the sauna. He's got on like basketball shorts down to his fucking knees, passes needs, I should say that Jordan ones. Right. And then he's got one of those fucking, uh, you know, it was army I fly airplane jackets that have the Zipper on the arm and his fucking Yankee Hat, right? Just walking down the street. He looked like he was, I dunno, like, cause his building caught on fire and he just grabbed a jacket and ran out. That's what the fuck he looks at freezing. Uh, Bart Nicks and other coach shorts guy.

Speaker 1:          00:13:52       And then he'd get me walking down the street. Like I say, looking like a sickly Ron Howard and a, it turns out the fucking thing was like, I dunno, like 20 blocks up the street and first he's Pinky toe is killing him and his flip flop, it was fucking cry and laugh. And as we go up there, so the hotel, the hotel we go up to, I swear to God with the steam room is in, is called the Pfister swear to God, p f. I. S. T. E r the Pfister. If you ever go to Milwaukee, you got to stay at the Pfister, all right? Cause they got this sick ass fucking stay bro and uh, spy and all that shit. So we fucking go down there, right? And it's like individual steam room that you get off of the fucking room. We're like freaking out. It's all these beautiful women walking around that work.

Speaker 1:          00:14:42       They're like, oh, this is great. So finally was sitting there drinking spa water, right, dressed the way we look, right. Look and like fucking animals. And, uh, all of a sudden, like three people come out, right? Too cute women in this dude. And I'm just thinking, what the fuck is he doing here? And then he just goes, ah, he's like, ah, Mr. Byrd. I'm like, Hey, you gotta be fucking kidding me, right? So we go over it, right? And he shows me how to use the spa, the steam, because all I'm doing is taking the steam. And he's like, yeah, you do this, then you do that. And I was just like, yeah, yeah, I know how to use. And he goes, hey, I just so fucking disappointed. Right guys should not work at fucking spas. They just shouldn't. It should be all fucking ladies, right?

Speaker 1:          00:15:28       So I'm not a sexist pig. The Lady Shit on the fucking thing too. How about that? Does that make you feel all right? You fucking dumb. Cunt. Minneapolis. Um, so afterwards, right? So the thing is, I did listen to the guy explained the fucking Steve. Thanks. So the fucking steam thing turns on, dude. And it is like angry. It's angry steam. And I'm sitting there like, I got to pull my fucking feet up onto the bench. They don't burn off and I'm huddled in the corner and uh, you know, I'm like, it was so fucking hot. I had to, I had to get out. I just had fucking walk out like twice. I was read as a fucking tomato and I kept going back in or whatever. And um, long story short, he get out of the spa and then Barton, it can forsee they'd come out of theirs and they were going, oh my God, that was fucking amazing.

Speaker 1:          00:16:13       I was like, dude, it wasn't too hot. It wasn't too hard. He goes, no, he, they go, we just stood on the other side of the steam where the shower was. He just like turned the shower on. I was like, ah, I didn't fucking think to do that. And they were like, well, the guy didn't tell you how to do it. And I said, Nah, I shoot him out of there because I was pissed and I didn't get a woman. And then first he starts laughing. He goes, dude, the second that guy came walking out with those two women, he goes, I said a quick prayer that I didn't get the guy. And then I laughed and I said, yeah, I didn't. I thought it was, what the fuck is this guy doing here? Oh, you know what? They should have guys at spas for women.

Speaker 1:          00:16:50       That's what they should have. You know what I mean? It's all part of the fucking sparks spirit. She's supposed to be looking at something beautiful. All right. I don't want to see some stubbled face jackass coming down. You know, if he's listening to this, God bless. Should Dude, you tried to fucking explain the Steve to me. Um, so anyways, what was another great thing too about that, that Gig was a Riverside theater was right down the street and next to it, almost built into, it was a fucking bar and a uh, and a cigar, a tobacco store. And I want to thank everybody there for hooking us up. They stayed, they stayed open late for us. We showed up. They had two large fucking pizzas, right?

Speaker 4:          00:23:12       Jeremy. Hey, he's got a goal.

Speaker 1:          00:23:16       Anytime he fucking scores. I'm pitching this right now at the TD bank, north well's Fargo Center or wherever the fuck they call it. The old, the new Boston Garden. Anytime Jimmy Hayes scores, they should show that clip from Goodfellas with Ray Liotta in the shower going up

Speaker 4:          00:23:33       Chevy. You

Speaker 1:          00:23:34       got to do it. Everybody loves good. And who doesn't love it when a seven foot fucking winger scores when he's got that Bruins logo on? So I was excited that I was excited for Milan. Lou Cheats got his first fucking goal with the Kings. Can't root against him. And, um, I have to tip my fucking cap as much as I don't want it it to the Montreal Canadians went in nine and a fucking row actually wanted to see them break the record just because I don't want to see them win a cup. But I like seeing records get broken, you know, the Vancouver Canucks Canucks contacts or they'd beat them, you know, they'll always be constantly, you know, I just didn't like, I don't have burrows guy biting the guy's fucking figure. You know what I mean? That was the stupidest fucking media realized they were going to like maybe even sweep us and that he bit a guy's finger and acted like it.

Speaker 1:          00:24:27       He poked the bear. Why? Why, why would you do that? And then what happened? Everybody knew you fucked up the series and then your, your fans went out and they burned down all the Starbucks. And to this day when you go to Vancouver, you cannot get a good cup of coffee. It's a true story. That's a hockey story. You know, that you could see that on the NHL network. Um, by the way, if you listen to me and you get frustrated with how little I know about hockey, you should listen to Joe Barton. It's puck off. I'll tell you right now, nobody fucking like, if you just want to listen to an absolutely fucking rabid fans, they come up with nicknames. They got all these cool awards like the Claude Lemieux award is when you come out of the penalty box and you, you immediately score. It's got all that, all that type of shit on that, uh, on his podcast.

Speaker 1:          00:25:15       But whatever. Let's get back to the fucking, uh, what else did I want to talk about? I got to work out guy. So I'm not going to lie to you. I haven't need like a fucking animal. Last night on the bus, we watched Godfather One and godfather two and a, we swung by a swung by this great fucking Italian Deli in, uh, Minneapolis. Um, I thought it was, you know, I thought it was great, but you know, partner can fucking fuzzy. They also enjoyed it. They enjoyed it. But like Italians, the reason why they're so fucking great it food is they, their, their critiques. Most people would be like, good sub dorma goes for good. Unbelievable. Oh that fucking broaden that Denny's or whatever. The fucking olive garden. Oh my God, it's so decadent. Um, they have like, they have like 9,000 levels of bad, decent and unbelievable.

Speaker 1:          00:26:08       So like we got this fucking meat plate right? And I'm sitting like, oh my God, this is fucking delicious. This is delicious. And they're like, well, you know, you know, you know, the Gaba ghoul is good, but we got spoiled with the stuff in Pittsburgh. The Salami is outstanding. The pursuit is, is, is decent. It's not as good as Pittsburgh. I'm just like, how could you guys fucking even tell it's fucking delicious. Whatever it is, it's fucking delicious. But the Cannalis and the bread were fucking unbelievable. It was all fucking good. I probably shouldn't have said that because now people are gonna think that I'm shitting on the fuck. I'm shitting on the, uh, the place and that we went to, uh, oh, I'm going to say this. Broders B, r, O, d, r, S. Broaders Caseen Italiana. Um, the that leads Italian, catch him. I'm fucking can onlys were amazing.

Speaker 1:          00:26:58       Everything was great there. You know what I mean? But I will say the Gaba wool from fucking, uh, I gotta get off towards these guys. They're turning me into a fucking Pi's on here. Um, food was great. So then we put on, uh, and we literally, when we didn't have any wine, so we got out out of the bus, walked over. I'll tell you if this podcast doesn't make you want to be a fucking comedian, by the way, it's like the greatest life ever, right? So we fucking, we walk over to this bar, we went in and we bought like two bottles of Cabernet, right? And then it's the perfect moment to drop a good fellas line. Right? Second, we got the wine, we go, okay, now we can eat.

Speaker 1:          00:27:37       Never gets old. Oh, I actually quoted Frankie Carbo when that lady wouldn't shut up. And I was blaming, I was blaming everybody, every guy in the front row for not keeping their woman shut. I go at some point, I'm not advocate domestic violence, but you got to go a little Frankie Carbone here, you've got a wad up that fucking make coke, shut the fuck up and opened the door. Got a huge laugh. Um, so anyway, so my almost done with this fucking podcast. I really have to go work out. I got to do it, man. They got a scale actually here in this hotel. And I tell you right now, I don't dare get on it because I'm going to hate myself. Um, I'm open. I just put on like five to seven and then I got like two weeks before Madison Square Gardens. So then what I'm gonna do is I'm just going to drop three pounds both weeks.

Speaker 1:          00:28:24       That's it. I'm going right back to eating as perfectly as I know how to eat and do an insane amount of fucking cardio. I'm going to try to do that. But next week, um, play in, uh, in Philadelphia, in somebody's already told me where to go to get a fucking cheese take. Cause I always go down and he did. The people that you go to the genome as you go to fucking blah, blah blah. And the more I go to Philly, I find out that the only people that go to those places that are kind of the younger people, because they don't know any better because they're going to stand in a fucking huge line. So someone was telling me, hey, by the way, fairly people, if you know a spot, cause I, I've eaten it, both of them. All right, I can't remember which one I'd like last time we meet verse, he went there, we got a, we got one at each, cut them in half, you know, and then switched, you know, so we both got, you know, half of each one.

Speaker 1:          00:29:18       And I remember there was one I liked the uh, cheese better on one and I like to something the bread better on the other or something like that. So anyways, if you guys know of a different place to go to, I'm trying to scroll right now and find what this person told me to go to. Um, they said go to Steve's Prince of steaks. If you guys know one of those, cause I don't Rose's the Rose's from Philly and he goes, Nah man. He goes, I never go down there to fucking lines are too long. He had one that's off the beaten path. So it seems like everybody knows though. So, uh, give a couple of tours. So Hook up here, let us know where to go. Um, well if you don't want to blow up your spot. I understand. Um, so I'll be there and then I'm doing a casino, I think in Bethlehem or something like that, Pennsylvania.

Speaker 1:          00:30:01       And then I got a, I dunno what I'm doing, I think some sorta some Gig, I don't even understand. I think it's a casino. I don't know what it is. Someplace down in Daytona, Florida. And then I'm up in New York and I'll be in New York for the whole fucking week, getting ready to do a, the Madison Square Garden Show, which should be a, obviously pretty fucking memorable. So I'm getting pretty excited about that. But I got to go to the gym every day. It's got to become a poppy life. And if you don't want, I'll be fading away. You go to the gym every day, you'd cut I gotta I gotta get back to that. Um, I do find, I gotta get back to that. I'm a fucking idiot.

I'm going to miss most of those. I'll be all caught up on the haves and the fucking islanders. Why are you guys still listen to this? All right. Uh, for the bottom of my heart. Thank you to everybody who's come out and showed up on this tour. Man, it could not have been a more fun toward the whole fucking thing. From top to bottom. The guys that I went on tour with, Jason Lalia, Joe Barr, Nick Paul Versey, and everybody came out to the shows, the venues, all of that shit. Even that fucking crazy broad last night on the first fucking show, I don't get any fucking hate for you.

Speaker 1:          00:33:22       Whatever. You know what? I bet if we went out and had a drink, we would have had a great fucking time. You know, that admitted? Come on. We could have traded notes on the ladies. Um, all right. That's the, uh, I was just checking in on, you. Hope you guys have a wonderful weekend. You can't send now. We got a so cool music. You guys always ask me about the music that's on this thing. Um, I don't pick it out. Uh, Andrew [inaudible] does, so look him up on fucking Twitter, Twitter. Um, he's, he's a young fella. He knows all the cool fucking music. He's the one that tells me what the fuck to listen to and I've been downloaded some of the shit that he puts up there. Um, I really get into the band. Fucking God, Jira. I hope I'm saying it right. It's Godzilla.

Speaker 1:          00:34:13       But that name was taken so they just wrote it how someone would say with an Asian accent. Gojira and they're fucking drummer is insane. Fucking insane. And I've never been into that rope. Barbara. I'd like lamb of God. I like, like for me, there's still has to be like a couple of songs where they slow it down and maybe the guy actually sings regular if he know bands like that where there's still at least a little bit of melody to it as opposed to just like, just blistering, beating the shit out of you. Um, oh, by the way, somebody actually sent me some of this swag too. Um, I've got to thank him for that, man. It's been a fucking amazing tour. So now I've got three nights at the legendary a Chicago theater and for my money, for my money, it's the best in most iconic marquee in the, uh, I've any theater I play, I've, I've, alright. Even just seeing just that, that fucking vertical sign where it just says Chicago, it's just went out. You know, what I love too is whenever the Blackhawks have a big game of back in the day, the bulls that the Jordan Pippin bowls, whenever they were, they had like a big playoff game and they would show, they always showed the fucking river, you know, the seers fucking tower or whatever. They show the fucking, you know, sky long along along the lake. But they always showed the Chicago Theater mannose fucking

Speaker 5:          00:35:38       um, I saw that for years as a sports fan. So to be able to play it is amazing and a little bit of a backstage shit here for you. Um, this is the only theater that I've ever played where, um, you actually see a Frank Sinatra Dean Martin and Sammy Davis Jr have their names on the wall. They actually signed it and they, they have it behind glass cause everybody autographs the wall and then they have, um, when you're backstage, if you're walking from left to right, you go all the way over to the right and way, way, way, way up on the wall. I don't know what sort of fucking ladder they gave the chairman of the board, but it says Frank Sinatra. Oh, it says, I hope, I hope you had a good time. I know I did. Frank Sinatra. It's fucking amazing. So, uh,

Speaker 1:          00:36:33       fucking just awesome wave started off with Notre Dame, USC and we end up at fucking dish Chicago theater. Could not have been more of a perfect tour. Um, and that's it. I'm done gushing here thanking everybody, but we really didn't have a good time. All right, go fuck yourself. So have a wonderful weekend. I see.

Speaker 5:          00:37:25       Hey, what's going on? It's bill burn. It's the Monday morning podcasts from Monday, October 3rd, 2011. Why? How's it going? You hear that echo? Oh Yup. Um, I'm in a new place. I moved no more angry old guy beneath me. I'm in a new place and uh, it's sparsely furnished, some sitting in an old chair. So it's going to be creaking a little bit during the podcast and actually got out of it cause I just realized that sonically, that could be a little annoying. Um, yeah. Move to a new place. Little bigger, little better. Right? The American dream still existing, you know, instead of taking giant leaps, you take little steps. Little baby steps. Ooh, look at that. The kitchens up to about six inches bigger. Um, no, I'm psyched. First Time my fucking life. I don't have some cut live in below me or above me.

Speaker 5:          00:38:27       So you know what that means. All I got to do is piss off my neighbors and I think I'll be all right. No, we got it. We a nice place. So we're site my girls happy, which is a great thing as a guy, you know, that's a great thing. You know, you get something new and shiny and what are the names and then they're happy and then your life is great. That's all you want. You just want them to be happy. Maybe if they're happy they'll stop fucking bitching at me. Stuck. I, you booed me. Maybe that'll stop, you know. But you know how broads are, you know, they are, no matter how cool they are, how fucking hot day. Yeah. Eventually they find something. Eventually they find something, you know, and you sit in there and you'll listen to him talk and you nod and you know it and your head. Ah, yeah. Ah, okay. Yeah, I'll work on that. Yeah, definitely. I'll work on that. And then your head, you just sitting there going like really,

Speaker 5:          00:39:31       really fucking unreal. I swear to God, I swear to fucking God. I was talking to Paul Versey about this the other day. We were on the phone joking about this shit going, I bet Donald fucking Trump gets nagged, you know, sitting there looking out the fucking helicopter window that has his Goddamn name on it. Right. And His fucking wife is probably sitting next to him if he's even married, whatever his fucking girlfriend, he likes those Transylvania hotties that Olga kind of chicks, whatever. He's just staring out the window of his fucking Chapa. Right. Just fucking sitting there shaking his head, you know, whole head moving to pay, sitting still, you know. Right on top of his head on a swivel. Right. She's just fucking sitting there nagging him. You know? I just thought you could have gotten a little more social if like I was having, those are my friends. Okay. Those are my friends. Those people are important to me the same way you are. Okay. You have to accept all of me. Donald's stop looking at your skyscrapers. I'm talking to you here. This is us. Okay. I or just who? You're the dawn. You have a hit show. Okay. This is us. Okay. This is your foundation.

Speaker 5:          00:40:58       Well, I don't feel like you're listening to me because I'm staring at the back of your orange hair. Okay? Okay. I'm sorry. I know hair is sensitive to you. It's just I'm, I'm, I'm emotional right now and I felt okay.

Speaker 6:          00:41:12       They were, I was going to invite my friends over,

Speaker 5:          00:41:16       right? And then they go into that shit right now here's a little quiz for you fellas. Why did that fictitious bitch start crying in that fictitious monologue? Why did she cry? I'll give you a couple of seconds to come up with it. It was because she was really, I feel like I'm giving a lecture right now. It's just really sending my ego through the fucking roof. Why did she cry? Was it because she felt like he didn't love her was because she was truly upset that he wasn't nice to her friends or was it because she took the argument to a place where she knew she was wrong by bringing up his fucked up hair? That's what it was. Since she just, Oh my God, I'm going to start losing this. So then they immediately go to the tears. That's what they do. They're terrible, awful living things with a vagina now.

Speaker 5:          00:42:09       I'm kidding. Um, anyways, but I'm not kidding about why she cried. All right, so there it is. So that's what you have to do as a guy. You have to assess, why is she crying? Am I being a Dick? If you're being a dick and she starts crying, that's when you go in and you hold them. Any telling me you're sorry. All right. And say please don't cry. But if it's got nothing to do with fucking anything, it's just, it's just a manipulative technique to make you feel like, like you're the hulk. You know when you're screaming in their face. All right, so you don't always have to go in for the hug. You don't always have to do it to stand back and assess the situation.

Speaker 7:          00:42:43       One of them fucking coordinators on the sidelines. [inaudible] so listen to this shit. I've come to Copenhagen

Speaker 1:          00:43:12       when I, when I travel to other countries, boys and girls, believe it or not, I am on my best behavior. I always try to be overly polite. I try and learn a couple of words and a, I try to figure out their, their, their money system. So I'm not like going, you know, you know, one of the weirdest things, where are you going to another countries? You immediately feel like a child, especially if you don't know the language and you're just, the funniest thing is money transactions. You just come up and you're like, hey, like hoping they speak English. You almost say like hello with an accent. Like hello.

Speaker 1:          00:43:51       I see. Until you basically speak English in your interpretation of their accent, hoping they're going to understand you and then they're like on 2000 Deutsche marks or something. And then you just a handful of fucking coins and you just guess and your hand until, you know, you just feel like a little kid. Like, is this enough for that Stubbs? And you hand it to them and then you just wait and you're waiting for that. Like, uh, could I have a little more or are you fucking shitting me? Or they just sort of take it and, um, anyways, what's cool over here is a Denmark they got, they have really cool, uh, I liked their money. I like any sort of money that has a little hole drilled in the middle of it, you know, like some little Peush and people use it as wheels and they somehow remove the axle. And then the giant people used it as currency. I liked that type of stuff. So anyway, so I come over here, I'm on my best fucking behavior and when I'm in the states and somebody comes over there and they're from another country, I try to be extra nice store so they have something nice to say. So anyways, so I come here to Copenhagen.

Speaker 7:          00:45:01       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:45:02       Um, which is in Denmark for all you Americans, fellow Americans, I should say. Look, let me try to separate myself as if I could find it on a map before I came here. Um,

Speaker 7:          00:45:13       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:45:13       We jumped in the cab and I'm talking to the promoter who's going to take me all the way through Scandinavia. You know, that has all the ladies that Hitler used to rub one out to, wants to have blonde hair and blue eyes. Yeah. Oh yeah. Right. And, um, this is one of the most fucked up podcasts so far. How many times can you bring up Hitler? Let's go for the record, shall we? It's early on and podcasting history. Um, the first person to set the record, or at least the first time it was tracked, was bill burr back in the early two thousands. He had a podcast called the Monday morning podcast. It was highly successful until one day it was permanently suspended from iTunes. If you turn to page 17 in your Monday morning podcast textbooks. Um, so anyways, I'm in this fucking cab and I have this thing. Um, I can never remember it from west to east. If it goes, if it goes Norway, Sweden, Finland, or if it goes Finland, Sweden, Norway. I always fucking forget.

Speaker 7:          00:46:28       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:46:31       And why wouldn't I forget? Those fuckers are never in the God damn news other than that, that tragedy and Norway. But other than that, they're cool countries. They don't fuck with people.

Speaker 7:          00:46:42       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:46:43       So they don't make the news. The only reason why these fucking cunts over here, nowhere America is, is because we're bombing people. You know, because we have basis in their country because we're annoying the shit out of so much of the world. That's why they know where we're at.

Speaker 7:          00:47:00       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:47:00       So I'm in this cab and I'm having this conversation with the promoter gun. Does it go know what Norway, Sweden, Finland, Finland, Sweden. I can ever remember. And he explains it to me. I go, okay, okay. And then the cab ride ends and then the cab driver turns around and goes on the Americans. And so Stopa was the geography. And then he goes, I'm just kidding John, to be passive aggressive. I said, Oh yeah, you fucking Danish. Where's Tennessee in relation to Missouri? And he goes, don't know. I'm stupid to go fuck yourself with your passive aggressive. This cut said that shit. America is, yeah. So still put was the geography and then he does his little pussy smile and he's just kidding. No, you're not. No, you're not. You're serious. You're miserable cunt. Oh yeah. You're so smart. Did you go to fucking premed to become a taxi cab driver? You fucking Dosha and right there. I swear to God. In my head I was like, fuck Denmark and fuck this show tonight for like the next half hour. That's what I was thinking. And uh, then I was like, no, I can't judge the whole fucking city. I can't judge the whole country because one douche drive and a cap. All right. Put yourself in America. Do you find cab drivers in America to be pleasant? No, I do not. Do you find them to be slightly miserable? Yes, I do.

Speaker 1:          00:48:22       If you drove a cab, would you be a mess? Miserable. Cont yes, I would be. And then I said, fuck it, let's give these Danish cons of fucking show. And um, actually I was still nervous before I went in to do the show and uh, you know, you come all the way over here and as much as they speak English, you're, you're kind of wondering, you know, how much are they going to get? And fortunately, the night before I was in London and I just made this decision probably about 10, the first 10 months of my set in England, I felt like I was a little on my heels going and here's this joke and are you going to get this? Okay, here's another joke. Are you going to get this? And then I find he just said, you know what? Fuck this. I'm just doing my shit. All right. And if they laugh, cool. If they don't have Jesus, is this going to be room service? Hang on one second. Hang on one second. You're going to get to hear me talk to a Danish person here. Hello? Yes, yes, no, no, no. Many wives. Cool. Okay. Okay. All right. Thank you.

Speaker 3:          00:49:50       Oops, I got it. God

Speaker 1:          00:49:54       Damn European doors, I can't even close it. Um, so anyways, yeah, so I kind of, I learned that when I was in doing the show in London, I just said to hell with it, you know, just say, just do this shit. Like you're standing in the middle of Kentucky. Fuck it. Just do your act and off they laughed. They laugh and if they don't, I will address it. I will then make fun of the fact that I was so stupid that you thought I was going to get it or something will come to me. And then I was able to relax and I had this fucking show in London, so I was like, well, it worked in London. Let me, uh, let me do that over here. Okay. So I show up to this place in Denmark and it's probably like a, I dunno, 400 seater and I'm not going to lie to you.

Speaker 1:          00:50:45       Only about 125 people showed up, you know? But why, why would foreign to people show up? I've never been on TV over here, whatever. This is the whole purpose of it. And I got free DVDs for all these people, right? So the, the, the, the basic marketing strategies, I'm going to go on stage, fucking destroyed. And then they're going to take these DVDs and go onto, you must see this America, next time it comes to Tanya. Uh, I apologize to anybody from fucking Denmark who, cause I keep making you guys talk like fucking ss people. I, I don't know. I can't, I can't do your accent. Go fuck yourselves. I'm trying. So, um, they have this dude from Sweden opened the show and he comes up and he's speaking a, I don't know, Swedish Danish, I don't know what the fuck Juan's gals tries in face Andrade.

Speaker 1:          00:51:38       And uh, the crowd is, you know, sort of Giggling, sort of laugh. And it was kind of a weird thing where there was a bunch of comedians in the crowd. So, uh, this guy goes on stage, he's a comedian, he's a newer comedian. I don't know what the deal is. And uh, they're sort of laughing, but not really. And then in my head I'm like, gone off. Fuck is this, what's going to happen to me and uh, but I dunno, I just felt like this great vibe in the room. I went out there and I am the, and I did what I would do in the states cause I was sitting there in my head going that's fucking cunt and the taxi cab but mannequins that so stupid with the geography was bugging the shit out of me. But I didn't want to go up there and shit on one of their country man cause I thought they would all pull back and then they wouldn't like me.

Speaker 1:          00:52:23       Then I was like well what if this was the states? What if you were down south? You're clearly a fucking Yankee. If some guys said, hey buddy, you booked and critique the Saskatoon Razz game. That's what the fuck I would open with soy. I said to hell with it. That's what I'm doing here. And I went out there and I shit all over the guy add a and I basically said something to the effect of Yeah did you go to medical school to become a taxi driver? And they laughed their asses off and I was like, oh look at this. Just like America, except they're bilingual and uh, and everything went great after that. So, and there's my European stories so far.

Speaker 7:          00:53:07       [inaudible] underrated for the week.

Speaker 5:          00:53:38       Direct TV and getting the NFL network people, I don't give a shit what your landlord says. Put a fucking addition on the side, figure out a way to do it. Steal somebody else's direct TV. I got it is fucking phenomenal. It's funny, it's like you're on sports bar. It's the greatest fucking thing ever except you can just sit there and chill. You don't have to fucking sit there and listen to all those idiots who ruined the gang. You know, you know those idiots, those Jersey wearing ball watching jack asses, you know?

Speaker 2:          00:54:15       Okay.

Speaker 5:          00:54:16       Who like something happens and then they yell at your table all day. They do that shit. That's some tough as shit. Who couldn't even catch a basket of potato skins if you under handed it to him. Like he was a fucking three year old, all of that shit. Ah, oh. One of the last times I went to a sports bar. It was when the saints were on their run and all of a sudden for the first time in my life I saw saints fans, you know, and they all got their brand new fucking jerseys on typical sports bar fans. Brand new fucking jerseys on. Go on. Who that? Who Dat, who dat date they're going to beat them. Saints. It's just like where under what fucking rock did you crawl? What? Where the fuck are You Ben? Right ball watching Jack asses. You get the NFL package. You don't have to deal with it anymore. You don't have to fucking deal with it anymore. I got, I got that and I got the NHL package and that's what I'm doing. I'm going to get the MLB package when that comes around, I am going to have a $400 a month cable bill and I'm going to sit there with a, with a fucking Nirvana, like look on my face as I pay the cable bill every year. I am every month I am done with sports bars. I don't know why the fuck you would ever go.

Speaker 2:          00:55:36       Okay,

Speaker 5:          00:55:36       why the fuck you would ever go? What do you want to see? You want to see the sports bar horse. Those are some of my favorite ones. Isn't that great? How women can make anything look sexy. And all those girls that come there and they tie their fucking jerseys off and they put some grease out of their eyes and he just, and the little fucking Pony tail and they act like they're there to watch the game when they're really there, you know, just to test their pussy power just to kind of walk around.

Speaker 2:          00:56:02       Okay.

Speaker 5:          00:56:03       Get everybody all fucking worked up. I went to a place out here a few weeks ago, uh, down on Melrose called parlor live. And I don't know, I don't know if I'm getting old or what, but it was a fucking mob scene. You know something, if I was in my twenties I would go down there cause there was a ton of hot chicks down there, you know, and isn't that what you want? Is a guy, some hot chick with a fucking pony tail who actually watches sports, you know, so I, I get, you know what, I just realized I was too fucking old to go down it cause I literally went down there and I was like, why does, why the TV so loud?

Speaker 5:          00:56:45       I can't hear myself back. Um, whatever. All I'm saying is I'm telling you, if you're younger, you're in your twenties just don't, don't, don't go drink it for a couple of weekends. Pool that money together with your roommates and go out and get a dish. You fucking Douche bags. I'm telling you. All right. And then what you do is you have people bootcamp, you have those fucking sports whores come over to your place. There's your TV three feet over. Oh, there's your desk. There's your bedroom. It's right fucking there. Then they're already used to coming over to your place. If you hang out with them another night and you invite them up, the places already familiar. Oh Shit. I think I'm on to summarize what you do. If you're in your 20s pool your money together with the other fucking slob. Have a roommate or slobs. All right, and this is the big thing.

Speaker 5:          00:57:36       And you invite your friends over and they bring their brides over to, all right, this is to get laid by the way, cause I know a lot of sports fans will be, well you don't want any girls there cause they're just going to talk during the game and shut up during the commercials. I understand that, but if you want to bang a couple of them, this is what I do. You get that shit. And the big thing is make sure your fucking apartment is clean. Make it immaculate. All right? There's nothing that dries up a pussy like a dirty apartment. I'm telling you, if they walk in and they feel that they're gonna fuck inside of a laundry bag that they're out, they're out the door. And if you try and make a move, you have a 30% chance that they're going to scream rape.

Speaker 5:          00:58:11       All right? All that shit that everybody says is for fucking cool centered, can't get something, some sort of fucking decent smell going on in there. Take the shit from your male friends when they come in like, dude, it smells like a fucking candle store. Would you pull that thing out of your ass? Take that shit. All right. All you have to show is this in your 20s all you gotta do is show remotely some level of fucking maturity and I'm telling you, you're in the God damn game. I don't know. There's something about him. He dresses nice. His apartment is clean. I think he's worthy of answering my vagina,

Speaker 7:          00:58:54       right?

Speaker 5:          00:59:24       What the fuck is I, I don't even get me started with that shit. Those people who dress up for games, you know like those stupid fucking raider fans, what are they doing? Do they understand how it went from one of the scariest places you could ever play to now looking, it looks like a musical looks like a Broadway musical. Like I look at that and all, I don't think intimidating. I think Phantom of the opera. I really wish I knew some of that music. I'm sure a lot of the people in the black hole and they stand up for the whole game. Do they?

Speaker 5:          01:00:08       Hey, look, it's Darth Vader. Gee, I don't know if I can catch this football now, raider nation, you guys have the best fucking uniforms and all of football. You have the best logo. You have the baddest fucking tradition, and I don't know what you guys did to it. You need to get those Saifai road warrior want to be out of your stadium and you got to go back to looking like the fucking hell's angels like you used to be. You know, look, I'm not going to stop. I'm not gonna lie to you. I was actually gonna go to the Patriots game up there with a buddy of mine and he's like, dude, we're not wearing any patriots shit. I go, fuck a fuck. No, this is the west coast. The Shit isn't fun out here. People get stabbed, they get shot. You lose an eye. They're out of their fucking minds. All right? But I can tell you right now, Boba Fett is not doing that shit. Okay. Or the guy with his fucking shoulder pads and his fake spikes coming out of it. Oh, with the band bandanas in your face makeup. You know, what I love about those guys is I just want to see them, you know when they're their alter ego, you know like when they're in Burt ward mode and they're just waddling down the street going to work. Yeah.

Speaker 7:          01:01:29       No

Speaker 5:          01:01:34       Jesus Christ. Um, yeah I think you guys need to go back to looking like fucking Ken Stabler and Jack Tatum. You know, you really should go back to that and you know something. I'm actually being, I'm not being fair to open rate of fans right now cause I've been to a game up there and most of them look that way and I actually talked to a couple of them and they fucking can't stand those guys who dress up like they were in the rocky horror picture show and typical TV, typical TV. Who Do they put on, do they put on the real rate of fan was just sitting there maybe with the rate of t shirt or just dressing with the black tee shirt. It looks like he'd slice your throat. You know, like a normal upstanding raider fan looks like. Now who do they put on? They put on the guy dress like the chef, the muppet show, the fake scar pain and on is do it. At one point they had some guy, I was watching the game and this Douche bag is just sitting there, this face painted and he's like, yeah,

Speaker 7:          01:02:33       okay.

Speaker 5:          01:02:36       Like what happened to you? You know what happened? His balls dried up this disappoint. Like they don't really talk about this in health class. In high school you get to a point where you're such a douchebag and it's been so long since you actually laid down with the woman that you're, your balls turned into saw dust and uh, the estrogen levels go up. And the next thing you know, you, you go out and you buy a little vanity and you're like, I just don't want to go to a football game. I want to go there and character five thick Theban eight. Shaneal um, Oh God, help me the next time I go up to the bay area. Um, so anyways, so we were going to go to the game and they, and right off the bat I'm like, Dude, I'm not wearing any patch shit.

Speaker 5:          01:03:21       And the dude's like, yeah, absolutely not. I don't, you know, why would you do that to yourself? You know? Why would you get, especially out on the west coast where you get shot, stabbed the Illusia fucking eye. So we came up with this great plan. I ended up not going up there, but I, I want to pass this on to my listeners here. This is a great thing that you can do, especially when you know your team's going to win. You go there dressed in the other team's colors and then you act upset when your team is kicking the shit out of him. That's what I was going to do. I wasn't going to wear a Raiders thing. I was going to go there and a black, black thermal, and it's Tom Brady was marching up and down the field and everybody around me was going, oh, what the fuck? I be like, yeah, come on, watch. They're probably going to score again. Oh Great. Just what we needed. You know, it's funny, nobody would have noticed. No one would ever stop and go, wait a minute, this guy looks like a fucking Leprechaun. We don't have any red heads and in fucking Oakland, this guy's a double agent. They never would have been able to figure it out. You know why? Cause they

Speaker 7:          01:04:23       too much makeup in their eyes. [inaudible]

Speaker 5:          01:04:50       I've got to say this was I right? Was I right about Mark Sanchez? I'm sure he's a great guy. I'm sure he makes a hell of a Salisbury steak. You know, I'm sitting there watching ESPN. Okay. And I've been saying it for years. Like the way to beat the jets is you have to go up by two scores, touchdown in a field goal. That's all you need. And then all of a sudden mark has to be a quarterback and he has to make something happen. He can't just manage the game and be like, don't throw, pick, don't throw a pick mark and just fucking throw it out bounds. He has to try and do something.

Speaker 2:          01:05:23       Okay.

Speaker 5:          01:05:24       All right. Well this year, you know, they lost a couple of players on d. They got a couple of injuries. Now all mark has to be captain come back. And uh, you know, I was watching TV on ESPN. They said, you know what do you, when you're running games not working it and a, you could only hit intermediate passes and you can't throw the ball deep pla. That's going to be easy to defend against. And I'm sitting there on the couch going say it. Say it, just fucking say it. He's not as good as you tried to tell me that he was okay. And New York is, if you ever wondered why everybody fucking hates you guys. All right. Yes we are jealous of your fucking awesome city. It is awesome. All right, but not cause you're there before you puff up your man tits. All right? This is why I can't stand New York, because if you play sports in New York City, if you just scratch your ass, they call you a fucking star. It's ridiculous. If Mark Sanchez played for the fucking Seahawks, if he played for the chiefs, if he was down there in Texas playing for them, fucking texted down in Houston, you wouldn't hear a fucking word about that guy.

Speaker 2:          01:06:39       All right?

Speaker 5:          01:06:40       But all of a sudden he plays in New York and he's got dreams. Me Ice, man, you stay. Start Ramming them now my throat, like he's this fucking superstar. Very fast guy. Very elusive. Difficult to sac. I'll give him that shit. All right, was the last time you saw him throw a frozen rope. Put that fucker ball. Ace does the back shoulder thing. Oh, he's all right. You know. Well, everybody down there saying he's a fucking stock. Give me a God damn break. All right. Give me a fucking break. That guy is his upper mediocre.

Speaker 2:          01:07:18       Yeah.

Speaker 5:          01:07:18       I would rather have Philip Rivers. Then I wouldn't Mark Sanchez and that's sitting there throwing this guy now my God damn throat. While his defense is winning games, he's like, fucking Jim McMann.

Speaker 7:          01:07:30       Jimmy

Speaker 5:          01:07:30       man walking around with spiked hair and sunglasses on while I was fucking defense. Shuts everybody down. Oh Gee, did you win the gang? Jimmy.
