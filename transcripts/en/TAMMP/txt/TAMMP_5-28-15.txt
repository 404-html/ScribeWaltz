Speaker 1:          00:02          Hey, what's going on? It's Bill Burnham.

Speaker 2:          00:04          Yeah. Yay.

Speaker 1:          00:06          Just checking on you on an ar for a Thursday afternoon. Hope all is well. I'll deal the enjoy your last couple of days. I hope Tuesday and Wednesday was everything that you thought it was going to be. You know what was the last time you look forward to a Tuesday or a Wednesday? You never do. You never do unless you have the day off, which is why you have to go and kill your boss. Okay. And I think there's not a jury in the world that would convict you if you just said, listen, I just wanted for once in my life to be able to look forward to a Tuesday and on Wednesday, you know?

Speaker 2:          00:42          Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:43          And they would all put their heads to the side and they'd smile and be like, you know what, that that person did. That man deserves to die. Okay. Not to be a chauvinist, but I just assumed the boss is a man, you know, with all the squawk and from the feminists, like you know how they're not fucking, I dunno, I dunno what that problem is. You know, if there's not enough gum drops in their fucking ice cream. Evidently I think that's their basis. I'm not gonna start that shit again. By the way, me and me, it had a great time on Monday. Most people thought it was a great time, enjoyed us having a good time, and then other people got a little sensitive. I thought you a little bit too hard on her, did ya? Did you really think I was a little harder? You think she couldn't take it? She was fucking destroying me. You know, there's always one do. She just has to take everything to fucking seriously and for some reason in this day and age, then the whole world, the whole world will listen to one douche bag and think that it's a tsunami of fucking human beings. A tsunami bill. Hey, I'm, I'm fucking refund here. Every once in a while the wrong fucking reference will come out.

Speaker 1:          01:43          10 people fucking complain and they'll act like it's all a China. So dumb as shit. Just like, I really think someone needs to look at these fucking groups and be like, hey,

Speaker 2:          01:52          hey, hey, shut up. Shut the fuck up.

Speaker 1:          01:59          You're fucking bullies.

Speaker 3:          02:02          Okay.

Speaker 1:          02:02          That's all you're doing. The exact fucking thing you don't want done to you. Now you're doing everybody else. There's such cons. Who Bill, which groups? All of them generally speaking about the way they go about with their mission statement. They really are. They don't give a fuck who the fuck they destroy as long as in the the end result is there a, you know, most of the time you know what they want to do I think is a good thing. But the way they go about it, what the fuck is my computer talking about now? A script on this page may be busy or it may have stopped. I don't give a fuck telling me about it for um, all right, my computer's going to be a pain in the ass to me this week. I can already tell cause I'm trying to fucking upload some files to an external hard drive so I can have them on there so I can never look at them again.

Speaker 1:          02:48          How many external hard drives do you fucking have? You know, all these important pictures, all these selfies you took while you were shit faced in a bar, got to keep all of them right. You know, some dumb thing sent you, but you save for some reason to show somebody else and then that's there and then that's in your fucking hard drive. All right. I get it. I get it. I get a computer. Okay. Stop the script. Fuck it. Okay. I'll get off my life. Um, so anyways, uh, yeah, like last year when a couple of weeks ago, and I told you that hilarious story, the white kid fucking than the clean shirt and the beautiful glasses and the, uh, the rope necklace was asking for money and how, uh, you know, I was teasing her about how good he looked. So then he handed the money back, so I took it and gave it back to my friends and then the guy in the wheelchair came and then they gave it to him and the fucking white kid flipped out. And how funny it was. Right. Um, somebody got all pissed at me on Twitter about that and said, you know what? Yeah. That was great. You don't, the only thing it's funny isn't that is me not go to Amazon League when they go to Amazon. It's like, all right.

Speaker 1:          03:54          Yeah, do that. There you go. My entire fucking economy was based on you going to fucking Amazon. I don't give a fuck. I don't pressure anybody to do that. If you want to do it, I appreciate it. If you don't, don't, then you're going to have your fucking reasons. Stop fucking send me tweets. Like that's going to like, I'm gonna like feet brought to my niece. Bill power will not be at the comedy store this weekend because one can't decided not to use is Amazon link. Now what's he going to deal? He can't afford the gas to get over here. Speaking of which, oh, fractals, I am sold on that fucking Tesla. A buddy of mine last night, uh, comic, he got one. He just got the ass model. It was the sickest fucking car. He got an in blue. It was the shit. Um, I woke up this morning thinking about that car smiling and that's usually a good thing when you wake up.

Speaker 1:          04:46          Thinking about something smiling, you know, unless you're murdered somebody the night before and you're smiling about that, then I guess you'd be a psycho. Um, but, uh, I'm Solon the fucking car and I want to get the, I want to get the one that fucks with the core of that. The p, the series one where it's got two motors. I want to get one of those fucking things. And I was talking to another comedy. He goes, well, you know what? If there's a power outage, it's like, okay, you never going to have to buy gas again and you're worried about a power outage. Power outage. Think about your cell phone. Think about your cell phone. When was the law? That thing needs electricity. When was the last time there was a power outage and you couldn't use your cell phone for some ridiculous period of time?

Speaker 1:          05:30          Can you remember? Okay, now, now that you're off the ledge, go out and go buy the fucking car. Fucking dope. Dope. What do I do that anybody doesn't think what I think is then a dope? Yeah, he's just fucking, your word is wrong with me. I Dunno. So anyways, um, had a great time last night. I want to thank everybody that came down to the comedy store for the, uh, the all things comedy, uh, showcase last night. Everybody had a great time and Joe Rogan was nice enough to jump on in the end. Had a great time hanging out with him. Al Madrigal, bird fry. Um, Jill Barton, the Rosebowl legend was there. Um, Neil Brennan, Dean del Ray was just, it was just a fucking awesome time. And you know, what's the greatest thing about it? At no point did anybody periscope backstage that's becoming the new fucking thing, you know, the new desperate thing to try to sell your fucking love songs on, you know, hey, this is fucking Lao. Love it on periscope. This is what my face looks like when I take his shit in my fucking bathroom. And a, by the way, uh, this bathroom was done in a Victorian style. Um, I fucking hate periscope.

Speaker 1:          06:45          I, I don't, you know what, I just, I haven't even seen it. It's just the people who have used it, it's so fucking intrusive. If somebody just comes walking in the wrong, I'm on terrorists scope right now. It's just like, did I ask to be on this fucking thing? Don't have to sign a release or am I just guilty of being out in public then and now it's like everybody's becoming like TMZ. Um, I dunno, I'm not, you know me, I'm not a fucking fan of that. The only thing I don't like about the Tesla is that giant supersized fucking iPad. I hate that thing. Everything else about the car I love, but I'm so I'm already thinking about, uh, I know this guy that does custom car shit and I'll just have a window shade made for that thing and I'll just fucking pull it down.

Speaker 1:          07:25          I don't want that thing, you know, glaring in my face. Like I opened that thing and Raiders of the lost Ark can, every time I'd drive down the fucking street, you know, other than that, I think that car is, uh, I think that car is pretty sick personally, personally is what I'm thinking. So anyways, this is Thursday afternoon and for all you hockey fans out there, all you fans of the game of hockey, you have to be unbelievably excited, Huh? To game seven. It's one tonight though. Rages against the fucking lightening. And then tomorrow night the Black Hawks got to go to Anaheim and play the ducks. Man. Um, I can honestly tell you, I have no idea who's going to win either one, either one of those series. Um, but I do think whoever wins black cops ducks is going to take the a is going to win the cup.

Speaker 1:          08:11          Unfortunately, the West is just been stronger than the east for fucking ever. And I'm honest, that van, the Bruins one in all 2011 and I say oh 11th, then I almost say, oh 11 is that what I fucking did? Um, I was trying to get onto this fucking website here. I got it here. There's a a, some of you, this is something people wanted me to talk about it. If you want me to go off on something, just a tweet at me with Hashtag t a m m p Thursday afternoon, Monday morning podcast just before Friday. Um, this is feminist upset over statue of a man and a woman talking. I'm seeing, okay, here's the scene. All right, this is in Washington DC. You're a woman's sitting on a bench reading a book. Your male friends sees you on the, and it comes

Speaker 4:          08:56          over to say hello and talk. You put down your book, Lean back against the bench and smile. He doesn't sit next to you. Instead he puts his foot on the bench and leads over on his knee. Uh, so sexist, right? Uh, that scene is depicted in a statue at the University of incarnate word in San Antonio, Texas. And despite no sign of distress or physical assertion, some women have decided it is a statue. Oh my God, this is of mansplaining. A term used to describe men condescendingly explaining something to a woman.

Speaker 3:          09:34          Yeah,

Speaker 4:          09:36          Dude, how much do they fucking hate us? Like they never do that. Jesus Christ, every five seconds, they're trying to fixture then change how you are. Why don't they see the balance in that? That's fucking nuts to me anyways. Seriously. Here's the actual statue and the claim of a massage. Massage Uni. Um, okay. It's some, some woman wrote of friends spider this and Texas Hashtag mansplaining

Speaker 4:          10:08          the statue. Oh my God. I have to start explaining shit to women. If this fucking annoys him, all you gotta do is just do it more. Uh, the tweet went viral over Memorial Day weekend. It all started when Ash Hernandez saw the statue on her way to a teacher's certification tests. She was so outraged that she ran back to her car to get her phone to snap a picture. Uh, the sculpture just screamed at mansplaining. Let me just fucking try to be open and honest, which was really difficult for me because I'm such a cunt. But when I look at this thing, um, I don't see her smiling. She actually looks like her lips are purse. Like she's going really? But he, he, he seems like a nice guy. He's got a nice full head of hair. He's wearing a pair of slacks. He's got his shirt tucked in. He does seem like she, she seems annoyed by him. I will say that the way she's looking up at him, I don't fuck do we make this a little bigger? But I mean, if I saw this, I would be like this guy striking out. She's not having it.

Speaker 4:          11:14          I Dunno. I Dunno what the deal is.

Speaker 4:          11:17          He definitely, I got to admit, he definitely does look like he interrupted her. You know, she's got her legs crossed. She's got the book there. She was reading and he came over. I know this is mansplaining. I think the guy's kind of a douche bag and he's taken a fucking, you know, he's second to swing. Um, I think feminists have to understand that, uh, in order for us to get laid, we have to initiate the, uh, the interactions. So, uh, you know, maybe he didn't have to put as low for up on the bench, but I don't think that's a reason to take the whole fucking thing down. Like, I wouldn't walk by that statue was a guy and be like, you know what, I'm gonna

Speaker 1:          11:54          do that next time I see a line reading a book, I'm going to put my fucking foot on there. Mansplaining is hilarious. Just for the record ladies. They do it to us too. There's always that fucking person, you know, that person. It's, it's usually a person who's either they're not educated or they're overly impressed with their education. Like someone who didn't go to college is always trying to constantly, uh, throw out some information about something that they're well read on that they rent, you know, to overcompensate for the fact that they didn't fucking throw a hundred grand into the god damn toilet going of going away to school. Um, or you get those people that, um, you know, I went to Undergrad here and then I matriculated Holford to fucking blah, blah, blah for my graduate and my baccalaureate degree. You know, those fucking people. And you know, and I'm not saying that they can't be cool and I'm not saying someone that doesn't go to a fucking call, never didn't go.

Speaker 1:          12:51          It didn't go to college. Can't be fucking cool, but I'm just saying generally fucking speaking. Um, those are the two types of people. They overexplain shit. You know, I've had people who don't live in California. Tell me what California is like, you know, and then you just sit in there going like, dude, I lived there. The to La. It's just everybody's plastic. Everybody's got plastic surgery in Botox. It's like, no, no. There's a lot of unbelievably talented Pete. You know, all those fucking shows you love all those shows that blow your mind. This golden age of TV. Most of the people writing those in shooting those live in Los Angeles. So know that. All right. No, that okay. You want to see a lot of plastic surgery? I'd go down to Orange County. All right. I'd go down there. Okay. They even got laid. Off you go.

Speaker 1:          13:41          I thought that there was just going to be, uh, you know, my wife watches the real housewives of Orange County. I thought it was bullshit. I was like, all right. They picked the six biggest freaks down here, you know, and then of course made this place look bad. And then I went down there and I did a couple of weekends down in Irvine and I was like, oh, why can't I see, I see what's going on now I see what's going on. 53 year old woman wearing spaghetti straps, you know, freckled shoulders. You can see they're still working out, but you know, your skin just loses the elasticity and it just, it doesn't look good, doesn't look good. No one should wear a tank top man or a woman over 50. You just shouldn't do it. You know, even Jake a jackal lane, we had the decency to wear that funds. He fucking onesy zip up. He was still in great shape, but he knew, he knew what was going on. You know, varicose vein here or there. You cover it up, you know, you, you, you keep yourself in shape and you wear a lot of clothes.

Speaker 1:          14:37          Hey, by the way, all freckles is turning the ship around this big fucking tugboat of a, of a belly that I've put on here. Uh, I was a buck 87 or something. I think I, I've dropped a couple, you know, when you first started dating, you can drop a couple of times in a few days just by, just by eating healthy, just by going from the beginning of the day to the end of the day. So, um,

Speaker 1:          15:02          I've been doing the oatmeal in the morning with a banana and then between breakfast and lunch I have an orange. And then for lunch, uh, I've been just doing like a, what did I have yesterday? Had a giant salad and then I had a little bit of steak in there. And what are they have a little bit tuna later. And then for dinner I was running out the door and I just, I had this salary already fucking chopped up at a big glob of peanut butter and I just did that. And uh, do, that's a game changer, man. If you have salary with a glove of peanut butter, if you can fucking tough your way through that and deal with people going like, what are you doing? A remake of fucking, uh, outcast or whatever that fucking movie Tom Hanks did where he talked to the ball. Was that called Lone survivor? Oh, Jesus Christ. I know this one. It begins with an o not outcast, shipwrecked overcast weather.

Speaker 3:          15:55          Okay.

Speaker 1:          15:56          The fuck was that called? God dammit. Anyways, didn't being with an, Oh, let me add the big beard. Well said. Well said.

Speaker 3:          16:07          Okay.

Speaker 1:          16:07          All right. You're on an island. His ship wrecked castaway. Gasaway.

Speaker 1:          16:16          What does a castaway is that when they throw you overboard and they fucking stole, you've been cached away. Not to fucking safe. Let's say one of the worst things ever is getting keel hauled. Can you imagine that shit just fucking drag you underneath the boat til you pass out from sucking in water? I mean, like, it's just a fact that that could be a punishment. The egg shells, that I would be walking on it, whatever that fucking one legged maniac told me to do that was fucking driving the boat. I would do I fucking do anything. He cannot fucking Keel, homey. And your friends is fucking sitting there strapping me up for that ride. And you're sitting there going, come on guys under your breath like [inaudible]. [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          17:03          um, oh my God, I could never live back then. I would been y'all this shit that I talk right now. You know, I talk all this shit right now because there's no, none of that belly of the beast. No iron maiden's left. None of that fucking shit, at least in this part of the world or at least where I live. You know what I mean? But we don't to fucking set you on fire and do all that fucking horrific shit that we've done to people throughout the years. All right, let's get off this subject. It's a, it's Kinda creepy, Huh? All right. What do we got here? Other shit people wanted me to talk about battle rapper holds nothing back on the fat jokes. Uh, uh, post that video, I started to watch it, but he was going so goddamn slow. Um, it was annoying me. Ah, Shit. I gotta hit pause. Hang on, hang on, hang on. Hang on. All right, sorry about that. He sent to make sure that was somebody's calling me about something to have later on in the day, and I got to make sure I'm not gonna

Speaker 4:          18:02          we laid over there. Um, it's something else. Somebody wanted me to go off on. Um, cancer charities allegedly missed, used $187 million for concerts and dating sites, luxury cars for cancer charities. I think I already talked about this. Use more than a hundred to $87 million to buy luxury cars, luxury cruises, concert tickets, and even dating members. Memberships for families and friends. It's one of the largest charity frauds accusations ever leveled in the u s well, I gotta be honest with you. So many of them.

Speaker 3:          18:36          Okay.

Speaker 1:          18:37          If you dig a little bit, it seems like a,

Speaker 4:          18:42          I can't say like say like five hour energy.

Speaker 1:          18:45          Gee, they just got a thing now that every time you buy something, five hour energy, they're going to donate to this fucking costs. All right? And basically what they're going to do is they, but they have it on the screen. They say we're going to give at least 200 grand and we're going to give 5 cents on every five hour energy thing that we sell. And I got to be, when I'm talking, I don't think that that's bad because they're being, they're being upfront about it.

Speaker 3:          19:11          MMM.

Speaker 1:          19:14          Oh, Jesus Christ, you blocked me and jerk face, close the driveway gates and lock the front door. I had to move your rental car. That's a nice block. My wife and I are driving like an asshole. Um, anyways, um, I don't think that that's bad.

Speaker 3:          19:30          MMM.

Speaker 1:          19:31          But I, I just, you just have to pay attention to a up a portion of the proceeds is the big thing and it becomes like what portion of the proceeds and then it becomes like, well, what charity can I give to that? The most amount is going to go to the actual people that are suffering. Now you have to have some sort of infrastructure and the people, if they donating 100% of their time to the charity, they have to make a living where they can pay a mortgage. So I get all of that. But, um, there is, there is a thing where it becomes like, well, how much, how much are you making a year? Like if you're taking in $10 million, you're paying yourself a fucking $1 million a year. Then that's when it starts getting weird where it's just like, all right, so you're a fucking millionaire right now because people have rickets or whatever, you know, I don't fucking know who the fuck knows. All I can tell you is that my charity.

Speaker 3:          20:30          Okay.

Speaker 4:          20:30          Okay. The all freckles. All right. To raise, uh, to raise awareness on skin cancer is, is going to be a, I'm going to get that in motion for a 2021 even in 2015, 2016

Speaker 1:          20:44          I'm going to set it up. All right? And every time you guys go, oh, Jane's is, I'm going to, uh, I can't do that. I will go broke if I, um, I don't know. I'll come up with some more shit. I can fuck you guys out of money and make it seem like you guys are doing a good thing and I'm doing a good thing. And then one day you'll find out that I completely fucked you over and then I'll have like no comment as I get out of my, you guys find out that you bought my Tesla. Can you imagine that if I, you know what kills me about people do shit like that is, it's funny to me like if they can sleep at night or if, if they can't, if they're out or if it's the other way and they're just fucking wide awake at night going out Jesus Christ like a hey man, those alligator shoes who sings like Tom Ford, like 12 fucking grand. Yeah. How did you get dosed? Ah, raising awareness for a kidney stones. You know, while we raised a ton of money and I just take a percentage, 90% and I, you know, um, I do, I'm doing God's work. Glad plash shit. You're doing God's work. You do God's guides work. I run a nonprofit. Oh yeah. Then how do you pay your bills?

Speaker 3:          21:58          Okay.

Speaker 1:          21:58          Ball's in your court, Sweetheart. I just asked you a question. Don't stare at me like, how do you run a nonprofit and fucking put fruit loops on the table? I want to know at some point while I draw a salary, they go, you are profiting, you profit. But whatever. I guess I, I'm, I'm starting to think like, I'm overly critical of a lot of these charities that uh, you know, people do have to make a living, you know what I mean? But then there's that weird thing where it's like the bigger the event, they feel like the more money that they're going to make I guess. And then they got to start renting out these sick ass fucking places. And that's why I think it starts getting weird. I Dunno, there's a good movie in that somewhere, somewhere in there, there's a good movie script about somebody that starts a fucking nonprofit for the right reasons. And then the end, you know, the money's coming in and they get a nicer car. All of a sudden that driving around you ain't gold digging. Whores starts showing up. You make a statue of it, some broad walking into class doesn't like it. She fucking tweets about it. Nine people lose their minds. So 15 people lose their jobs. Isn't that how it works? And I'll bill you is such a Douche. Shut up. All right. Fuck you. All right, let me, let me, um,

Speaker 1:          23:09          oh by the way, uh, the, uh, the extra posters that then I had leftover from the Billy Bible belt tour, they're all autographed and they went on sale yesterday and uh, much to my, uh, happiness there. They're going really fast. So, um, if you want to get one there, uh, I made sure I autographed all of them and um, I dunno, we get a, I don't know to get left, I'm like 150 left or something like that. So if you'd like to get one, you know, if you can't make it to my shows or somebody, you know, you know that deal if like it to get it. If you

Speaker 4:          23:45          don't, I fucking get it. All right. Um, so anyways, what are we up to here? 23, fuck, 24 minutes. Um, let me do a little read here. A little advertising.

Do you guys remember that cartoon? The Jetsons? You know, meet George Jetson [inaudible] data to do his boy [inaudible] daughter Judy. Um, Jane, his wife,

Speaker 3:          29:04          Dang Dude. Ooh.

Speaker 1:          29:06          And His fucking car folded up and do a briefcase that was supposed to be in the future. And the whole premise was, is pool's getting, it was the Flintstones flipped on its ear. It's just like the Flintstones, but it's in the future. No, Dino, you got astro, right? No, Bam, Bam. You got Ellroy whenever the fuck I'm talking about. So anyways, they, the big premise about that was technology. Technology was going to be so fucking insane that uh, we were going to have three day work weeks and that was a running joke on that. George Jetson would always say, oh my God, these three day work weeks are murder. And, and I guess that hasn't happened. People are working more than they have a fucking worked. And uh, to the point they don't have time to go to a goddamned grocery store growth, some fucking vegetables.

Speaker 1:          29:51          I'll pick up a pair of socks, you know, or afford a pair razor blades down at cvs. So then all the shit that I'm fucking than I, than I, all these people that advertise, you don't have time to go to the post office. You don't get time to fucking do anything anymore. Why is that? Did we, did we not understand that the technology was now going to own us? Like look at all this shit. I'm fucking sitting there uploading all these fucking photos that I'm never going to look at it and it's making my computer freeze the fuck am I doing when I've been dealing with this thing. I don't even know what the problem is. It's been, it's, it started last night and it's still hasn't uploaded. It won't let me stop the process. It doesn't give me an option or probably a dozen. I don't know how to fucking do it, you know, and it just becomes something else that I got to fucking deal with.

Speaker 1:          30:35          So I dunno. Would you guys ever have the balls to go back to a flip phone like some of these kids are doing? Actually I heard this comic did that. He just got sick of fucking being on his, his iPhone or his fucking whatever the elements are. What are the other ones? You know Hitachi, who else makes it? Who else makes a a phone? There's the other one, the really big one and I don't fucking know. All I know is I don't talk on mine anymore. I just, I used the speaker. I'm big on the speaker, man. I don't hold it up to my fucking head. After that kid in mobile, Alabama told me his dad died of a brain tumor on the side of his head that he's talking to a cell phone all the fucking time and he's convinced that that's what it was.

Speaker 1:          31:21          And I remember hearing Roger Ebert say that about gene Siskel the same fucking thing. So, um, uh, I hope I didn't wait too long because God knows I can't remember shit. This is getting really fucking depressing. All right, we're up to a half hour here. Um, all right, so a, I didn't talk to me about any basketball. Let me talk about that real quick. Uh, the basketball man, who do you like? Who Do you like? Um, I love that the Golden State Warriors it back in it for the first time since what, 75. And um, I love that they play in that old ass fucking arena. There's a lot to like about them, but for some reason, you know, Lebron going back after they hated him and they burned all these jerseys and shit. Him going back and becoming a champion, showing that he didn't have to be part of a fucking pile on team with all, you know, all the injuries that got, I dunno, I can tell you this, I'm going to be happy with the, the team that wins and um, but I think, uh, I think Lebron's going to get, he's just such a fucking force, but I will say, and I don't know shit about basketball and that fucking, what's his Stephon Curry said, I you say his name Steve.

Speaker 1:          32:36          Dan Curry. Stephon Curry. I don't know his fucking name was. I've not, I've never seen a guy shoot threes like that in my life. He's like Larry Bird level unconscious every fucking game. Uv starts bad. All of a sudden he just, he starts, I haven't seen anybody. There was the greatest three point shooters I've seen in my life is Larry Bird, Reggie Miller, and just for degree of difficulty, the amount of times I saw Colby take a turnaround jumper with two guys hanging on him and he fucking hits it. Um, I mean those, those rhino, right. Wral and I guess I never watched him when he was playing. What do you play with the bucks?

Speaker 1:          33:16          The Sonics? I don't fucking know. I'm not a basketball guy. All I know is this guy. Is He, the way he shoots every fucking game is like a career game. He's the one, he's the greatest three point shooter I've ever seen. I would say Reggie Miller second and then Larry Bird. I've never seen anything like this kid. So, but I don't think that that's going to be enough. Him just fucking flicking that wrist and it going right through the net to compensate for the, the domination of Lebron. I just think that that guy is, um, I dunno if he's just on another level, just another level. And I think according to law head, Cleveland has a fucking amazing defense. Defense wins championships or what? That little tidbit of information from La had day of golf. That's my prediction. I'm saying the Cavaliers win a championship. All right. And Lebron goes down with Cleveland legends. I think it's funny. You gotta go back to Jim Brown and Bob Feller and then Lebron, right? That's going to be there. Bobby or Ted Williams, Larry Berg, Tom Brady, right. Those are ours. Those are our four. You gotta throw Bill Russell and another though 11 championships. Um,

Speaker 1:          34:29          who's getting hurt? We got so many fucking champions were fun. So many fucking champions. So many champions so that they have to suspend one of the great quarterbacks of all time of over. Absolutely fucking nothing. Um, do you guys read up on Jim Marsay how he had a, a, you know his, his mistress there. He bought her a house and she fucking hoe dating it. You know, he's a great guy. Okay. You know, it's solid fucking dude. You should be listening to that guy, Bill. Are you really going to whine about it again? You're right. You're right. It's over. It's done. It's going to happen. So anyways, thank you for listening.

Speaker 5:          34:59          Enjoy the throwback clip here. Have yourselves a wonderful weekend if cons and I will love talk to you on Monday.

Speaker 6:          35:49          questions or what, but what are some of your guilty pleasure? My guilty pleasures. Desperate housewives. A pint of Haagen Daas Ryan Seacrest's. Guilty pleasure. You know what? I gotta give it up to this guy. And he did call himself out for asking kind of a faggy question. What are some of my guilty pleasures? Uh, Jesus Christ. I don't know. You know what? This looks like a job for iTunes. Let's look at my iPod. Let me going to scroll down here and let's look at Kate Alice in chains. This is the last few things I downloaded. Alison chains, Jar flies, the new foo fighters. That's all respectable. Um, somebody was walking by staring at me. I'm doing this podcast in my car by the way. Uh Oh, there's one Rosanna by toto.

Speaker 6:          36:45          Fuck Yo. I like the drum beat. I want to learn how to play it. All right. God dammit. And I want to do it either way. It could be, yeah, it's a gay song. All right. That's a guilty pleasure. Um, nine, I'm going to get a bunch of comments. Everybody was fucking total pictures. Just make sure Jeff Macarthur was in it, so who won't get fooled again? That's kind of Hacky, muddy waters. I'm ready. The Allman brothers one way out. Kanye West. I Dunno, some people don't like him. Gym Class Heroes. Oh, wait a minute. Wait a minute. There's one poison. Every rose has it's thorn. Oh. You know, it's funny. I love that song and I can't listen to it without every time I listened to what I always picture people I know, watching me listen, catching me, listening to that song. So I always get embarrassed during the breakdown park.

Speaker 6:          37:36          You know, where he just Sorta strums the guitar, Dan in Aa, that part. Um, yeah. I actually get embarrassed. And a lot of times I say 30% of the time I have to shut off the fucking sun. I don't know what that says about me. Ben Harper, does that make me a Douche? I Dunno. Uh, loving spoonful. Maya, I got some, I got some weird ones here. Band of horses kind of makes me a hipster Douche. Dionne Warwick walk on by. I didn't download that today. Fucked about it. Up On my, I'm the only one to use. Is this bathroom really exposing myself here? Uh, what else do I got here? Beastie boys. Men at work. Work overkill. What did it all, you know why I downloaded that? I wait, what does that move? What's that show with it? Scrubs. The guy plays the, uh, the doctor, the guy with that fucking, uh, show them with the black dude.

Speaker 6:          38:41          Can I see your funny show? And they had that one time the guy came on, he, you know, you, you don't have a song like you don't think you like it or maybe you don't even like it and it's in a movie, then all of a sudden everybody likes it. It's kind of like black people all of a sudden, like in sweet home Alabama. Was that because they played that in, uh, what was it a con air? Was that the first time and then that guy rapped over it anyway, black listening to that you should really do is you should look at the words to that song. I don't think you'd like that song. Especially the second verse that in Birmingham, they love the good near Ooh, Ooh, Ooh. That they're talking about governor Wallace who was pro segregation. So think of that. Next time you're a, you're walking it out down there and hot Atlanta. That's not a, I don't think that's a pro black song. It's got a nice beat and you could dance to it though. I will give him that. All right. Does that pretty much pretty much answered this the question I got to redeem myself. What are we gonna be a tool?

Speaker 6:          39:47          You can tell him blowing by a bunch. I don't want to tell you. I'm just scrolling down here. Grace Jones. Demolition man. Yeah, yeah, yes. Somebody is, I just took a chance on temptation. I got a whole bunch of ACDC,

Speaker 6:          40:05          uh, oh my God. Actually have that pink song that's been on that forever though. Amazon, um, come in and say, you better get the buddy [inaudible] add up done. And I downloaded that. There was a moment in my life where I actually wanted to hear that song again. It's Kinda like Nickelback I have one of those songs, that song photograph there go back as amazing to me where it's like, the first time you hear the song you're like, Eh, Eh, it's not that bad. Why they get so much, so much shit. Then the second time you hear it, you're like, hey, I kinda like that. Maybe I'll download it. Then the third time you hear it, you're like, I want to find that group. Hunt them down, kill them. You know, like a deer. Have some ravens. Oh my back. Wait for me to fucking got them so the meat doesn't go bad and then they kind of fly in. We need the end trails. You ever watch? You ever watch someone ravens? I just watched someone Raven's the other day. All right, let's move on to the next question. This is my guilty pleasures.

Speaker 2:          41:04          So [inaudible] so,

Speaker 7:          41:30          so what happens then? Is that a, uh, you know, they, we, we, we, we auditioned him at the comedy connection. We go to do it live. We had done it in a room and they said, we want to see you live and we bond bond. It's just like, it's sucking silence now. What do you think? Wait a minute. Wait, so the first time you ever did it on comedy stage, now I've always said the first time if I bombed the first time, I don't know if I would ever have the courage to go back and do it again. Well, well that, that that's a difference between people that are, are, are, are hooked on it and people, yeah. People who are born comics and people who are just, you know, dabbling. Is that like really, if you bond you would have done it again. It would've, it would've taken me a minute.

Speaker 7:          42:09          I would had it been like the, just the, the sheer fucking embarrassment of a, I mean you can still, this is deal with standup is you can still eat it today. I'm 18 years in, I kind of, yeah, you can't eat it fun. But this is the thing, you have years of good shows to be like, well, you know, I know I don't suck at this. I had a bad night, but you know it right out of the gate. Oh yeah. The bad night thing is hard to, to really get around you had, cause it still hurts me if I bombed, but when you're up there and you know, you have this whole idea that you know, uh, it's, it's never, the audience is bullshit. I mean sometimes it's the audience, right. And you know, like you, you can tell, you know, you've done your shit and you can see where they're peaking laughter wise and you know, after a certain point that they're not going to go any further with that.

Speaker 7:          42:52          So I'll get after it. I'm just going to have to realize this is the best I'm going to do in this situation and either eat it and you don't take the hit or, or make light of the fact. Yeah. I've, I've learned like there's nothing worse than being angry on stage. But I heard, I actually heard a funny story last night. I was doing a kick and uh, this, uh, this book or Jeff Wills from the uh, yeah, he was telling a story. He saw one night, uh, said Bill Hicks it an entire show with his back to the audience. There was like a Bachelorette party. There was every fucking thing it did. Yeah. Those, you know, those Booker's they love to talk about those stories, you know. But if anyone else did that now, they would never fucking work in that club again. All these guys pretend like, you know, like, oh, Bill Hicks was the guy and he went on stage and angrily tanked in a brilliant inspired way almost all the time.

Speaker 7:          43:35          But if someone existed like that now he wouldn't have a fucking shot. You think so? Absolutely. Well, I bet. I bet he was still selling tickets at that point. Cause you can't, you can't, you can't turn your back on a fucking crowd and, and ever think that you're going to work. I don't think that's true. I think that the reason he got booked in this country primarily was to make club owners feel like they were, you know, they were at least championing something terrific. Like I think they innate, we knew this guy was special. There was no one like him. And even the fact that he didn't sell tickets or alienated the audience every time they were gonna have him twice a year to keep their content straight. Oh. So that can be dicks to everybody else basically. But just to sort of like, to, to at least support that, at least they knew well enough that he was an inspired guy.

Speaker 7:          44:16          But I've gotten angry on stage. I did it the other night, dude, not in it. And it would've been a long time because I used to snap all the tabs and say, that's kind of an understatement coming from you. Yeah. But, but that's like me saying, I've snapped. No, but, but you know, I'm pretty accessible now. Not, Oh yeah, you're your way, your way. Uh, but it happened at the store, dude, it happened at this how long ago? Two nights ago. And I, I, I, I could do this whole thing. Yeah, much better now. Much better enough. I snapped one time. What was it, 48 hours ago? I couldn't believe I did. It was such a different person. You know, that place brings it out of here. Come on. The comedy store brings it out of here sometimes. I, that's what I love it though.

Speaker 7:          44:52          It's so fucking soul on stage. It is evil. It is. It's just painted and heat, you know, you feel the walls wanting you to lose it, you know, if it's just in the place, so I'm on stage, it's like 40 people in the room and like, I'm already like just right when I get in there. You have some kid, that kid David Taylor, you know that kid, he's a tall guy, used to do comedy. He's very cynical and negative and I just, I wasn't in the mood for it. I hadn't seen them in months and I said hi to him and he goes, I'm staying around just to see you. You better be good. And so right away I'm like, I haven't seen you in a fucking long time. You have no right to fucking talk like that to me enough with the negative shit, you know?

Speaker 7:          45:29          And I stormed off and I walked back and made me feel really good about myself by that cause usually I sound like the angry psycho. I can be like the happy person. That's where take, take a break. Yeah. Thank you. Oh go ahead. You Go. All right. So, so I get on stage magical one on who I think is just terrific. I love al. He's, I think he's fucking hilarious. It's really original, unique stylists, real storyteller. He does good, you know, and then he brings me up and then I'm getting laughs. There's only like 30 or 40 people in the or and it's going fine. There's an old couple up front, the Oh maybe in their mid fifties early sixties and they, if someone talked to him and [inaudible] and they asked him about religion, I think Neal Brennan did. They said they were Jews. I'm like, fine. So I'm doing my show and they're not laughing at nothing.

Speaker 7:          46:09          And I looked at them and I said, uh, I'm sorry, my two filthy, you want me to talk some political stuff, you know, is, is that what it is? And then the old man looks at me, he goes, you're not funny. Yeah. And I, and I just had this moment where I'm like, all right, dude, all right. And I said, you know what, I am funny. I know I'm funny. I'm doing well with the rest of the audience. All right. And, and I, and, and I, I understand what you're saying. And, uh, and then like for some reason I just looked at him, I said, but the fact that that's what you had to pull out of your guts to say to me in this situation makes me fucking hate you. And, and, and the real punchline there, mark. So now you lose the rest of the crowd.

Speaker 7:          46:49          That's right. This is quite in the room. And I'm like, what? That wasn't funny. What did I say? Did Not come out funny now you turn on the rest of them. All right. Then I turned on the rest of them. And then, uh, and then he goes, you know, you asked and I said, well, you didn't, you could have qualified it. Like, how about you're not funny to me. All of a sudden you're the god of this fucking room. You're the Almighty. You're the one that has the last word. Fuck that. Right. And so that, and then like you were in a bad mood before you got there because you're going to say the read of this guy saying you are not funny. Sounds to me like you said some shit that he didn't want to hear. It was more of a subject thing. Not, not, no, I just, it was a general thing.

Speaker 7:          47:22          So then I, and the rest of the act, I'm doing my act and everyone's laughing every time everyone else will. After I looked at him and I went, Huh, Huh. And then like, you know, at the end of my set and bringing that Brenda is easy and he, he stands up with his wife and they walk out and while I'm still on stage bringing up Steve and I got very powerful statement, very powerful. I'll see you later, dad. Oh Jesus mark. Cause that's what I said to him. I said, hey, like you know, it's like every fucking Jewish guy that has that kind of judgment. That's your age. You just some surrogate for my father and I understand I'm trans, I'm transposing some contempt on you, but you could have fucking shows a different way. All right. All right. Anyways, Mark Marin here on Monday morning, but that's not funny. No, no, no. I'm just letting people know I'm acting. You know what I just did there? I acted like this was a live show. I like it. We'll take some callers

Speaker 2:          48:08          [inaudible].
