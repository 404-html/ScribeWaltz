Speaker 1:          00:01          Hey, what's going on? It's bill burn his time for the Thursday afternoon, just before Friday. Monday morning podcast. I'm just checking out on you. I'm taking time out of my day to read advertising to make a little more scratch, just to make sure that your week is going okay. All right? That's all I'm trying to do here. Jesus Christ. If I hear one more fucking asshole, bring up that stupid Michael Jackson video. I don't know what are they going to dig them up and arrest them?

Speaker 2:          00:37          Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:37          You know, and I, I love what anybody did. You see that thing on murder mountain? Did you see the making of a murderer? And you go in there and you listen. You basically, you are watching, you're watching the prosecution's case. That's not our case works. Then you hear the defense. All right, and I think it's kind of fucked up that you can have something come out about a dead guy and then everybody's just going to be like, all right, now we know definitively that this guy did. He should be allowed to refute moonwalk Outta the grave would be like, listen, just because I talk like this and I like castles and have a giant ice cream machine and like 17 doors that lock on the way to my bedroom designate in a fucking a child. He should be able to say that.

Speaker 3:          01:19          Yeah

Speaker 1:          01:20          and that, because I think he's innocent a it, it's, it's for you and me. Right? So we get the chance to do that. So some day, you know, somebody can't just say, Hey, I saw this guy with this tally whacker fucking wagon out of a zipper there. Right. You have a chance to defend yourself and what this new fucking bullshit of the Internet where they just all do processes thrown out the fucking window. The amount of people that I've seen accused of this me too shit. And then people just immediately go. Like I always knew he was a piece of shit. It's just like you haven't heard if you've heard an accusation, but having said that,

Speaker 3:          01:55          okay,

Speaker 1:          01:56          having said that, it makes me feel better about the suffering of humanity. Right? Cause when you look at human being suffering, if you're any sort of a human being, it bothers you. All right? But when you see 90% of them on the Internet, right? You get, will you be you at that point you're like, well maybe, maybe, maybe they don't need that much food.

Speaker 1:          02:17          Oh, that was just me, Bill, that was to meet for the morning. I hit him a little bit of a disappointing morning. I was going to go fly a helicopter and we couldn't get the fucking thing started. It's our 22 I don't know what the deal is. Like if, if you try to start it before eight, the magnetos are too cold. It's too cold outside this time of year. It just doesn't want to start. So we, we brought a car up to jump it, which we've done before and it has been fine. It looks funny as hell. But if you just don't look at the fact that it's a car and it's a helicopter and you just look at the engine, you're like, oh, it's the same fucking some fucking gas combustion engine. All right. Same fucking principles here. Um, I was really looking forward to flying and I know what a lot of you guys are saying, like, oh my God, I, why there's no fucking way I want to floats up that I had a bug, a jump shot.

Speaker 1:          03:04          I know, I know. But you'll get in your car that fucking every time you drive over a puddle at fucking Jesus in your face, right? Coming up to the rusted out floorboards as you texting, driving 90 miles an hour right down the fucking street. We'll say 50 driving, 50 looking down at your fucking phone and there's no guardrail in this. Somebody driving 50 miles an hour, just one, not even a like three feet up. You haven't you ever noticed that when you drive down the fucking street, just on a two way street, like the fact that you're going 50 and the other guy's going 50 and it never dawns on you like what does that guy just fucking swerved over? We'd both be fucking dead. It's like you're doing like what the, how the blue angels fly at each other the last second they turn away.

Speaker 1:          03:43          You're doing that with complete strangers. You're not on the radio talking to each other and every day, every day somebody is on their fucking phone, they drift over headlight to front headlight, Bam. Right brain smashing on the inside of the skull or what do people say? What do people say? Oh my God, it's a fucking shape. That's it. But the next time you go to get in a car and nobody says like, Hey, I'll go, maybe you should walk. You're going to fucking die. Sorry. I'm trying to preempt everybody who's going to sit there and the end for fucking say a bunch of fucking shit here. Anyways, plowing ahead. Guess who finally figured out how the Moto GP website works. Not this guy. Somebody gave me the link and show me. Then I was able to put in my password and a so thank you to the, to the listener who helped me out and I got to watch that race. The first one of the Aaron [inaudible] or a, what do they call k Tar? The English guys.

Speaker 2:          04:38          Okay.

Speaker 1:          04:38          Like every little fucking word they say different than us. It's amazing that we speak the same language over here. We say Ducati, they see do catty Oregano or a Gyno, tomato, tomato, Qatar, k tar or I didn't know at the scene I, Kantar Kantar is they think how they were saying it. Um, I dunno when I just hear shit like that. I really wanted to start to understand how difficult it is to be a spy because that's, that's the shit that gets you caught.

Speaker 1:          05:10          You get the accent down, you know, you watch a little peaky blinders and he'd go over there and next thing you know, you're in Buckingham Palace and you fucking snooping around to find out what those balding concert do it in there with all the goddamn money. Right? And then all of a sudden, what do you do? You let her do care. You go to a, a Ducati, a Ducati, I forgot how he said it. A Ducati slip then that's it, right? The queen pushes a button. You go through the floor right down to the royal alligators. Um, there's the, I'm gonna tell you right now, but moto GP, this is the best fucking racing that is out there. All right. On the final lap. The two, the two people, Andres divisio. So in Mark Marquez in first and second place they change leads, the delayed change three times in the final fucking, even though I knew it would happen, I was still up off the couch and everybody was asleep. So I was screaming quietly watching it. I'm an amazing race. Um, a little bit of controversy though, Huh?

Speaker 3:          06:12          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          06:12          The Duke cattys the Ducati's, they got this new little piece that they have underneath the bike that uh, allegedly is kicking up air to cool off the rear tire. And these guys, I guess they chew up their tires big time. So if he has just a little bit of an advantage. So divisio so one Ducati, one, uh, the team and immediately four teams complaint, which I'm guessing is Honda Suzuki.

Speaker 3:          06:38          Okay.

Speaker 1:          06:40          By the way, how come there's no Harleys are fucking Indians in the Goddamn race? What, what happened? My country, we started making real fucking motorcycles before all of these constant, constantly. I gotta look this up.

Speaker 3:          06:54          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          06:55          It's so funny that like Indians in like Honda's, it just for like fat fucks. Not Honda's Harleys. Essentially. It's for old guys want to sit down. I like the pegs up nice and high. It's my fucking air up my old fucking ball bag as I drive down the fucking street and all the Japanese bikes and the Italian bikes, they're all for the young guys who think they're going to live forever. Right. Having said all this, having talked to all this shit, you know, if I was going to get a bike, which I would love to, um, if I wasn't, you know, living for somebody else now, but even then, even before I had a kid, like I always liked my legs. Um, I like my feet pointing in the direction they're supposed to be rather than turned around like I'm fucking like daffy duck's bill. Every other cartoon. Um, all right. What the hell was I looking up?

Speaker 3:          07:49          Okay.

Speaker 1:          07:49          Oh, first motorcycle built. All right, let's see who built it first. Oh, I got the bad internet. Huh? Sometimes you get the bad cocaine. Sometimes she get the bad internet.

Speaker 3:          08:05          Okay.

Speaker 1:          08:05          What the fuck are you doing here? Can we wait one first?

Speaker 3:          08:11          Okay.

Speaker 1:          08:11          Fucking

Speaker 3:          08:13          okay.

Speaker 1:          08:14          Motorcycle ever built. It's going to bring a porno of, as I said, fucking in it. Come on, come on. You can load. You can, you could load if you want to. You can answer my fucking question. What is the Jesus fucking Christ? How much do you have to pay?

Speaker 3:          08:37          Okay.

Speaker 1:          08:37          How much I am fucking pay nine grand a month for fucking night. The first motorcycle, international combustion petroleum field motorcycle was, was the, damn, you're right. Viagen that sounds like German. It was designed and built by the German inventors. Ah, you fucking son's up. Is there anything worse than when you, a man did something or America did it and you find out they didn't? It's the worst. I feel like the world smiles when that happens. A motorcycle often called a bike or a motorbike or a cycle. I know what that is. Okay. 1894 Hildebrand and Wolf Mueller became the first series production motorcycles and the first to be called a motorcycle in 2014 the three top motorcycle producers globally by volume or Honda? Yamaha. And they hear a motor Corp, I don't know. It's an India. All right. So we're not the only ones making motorcycles that on in Moto GP.

Speaker 3:          09:36          Okay.

Speaker 1:          09:36          What is it about like Italians in, in uh, Japanese motorcycles that they just make the fastest ones they got, they got that unlocked that and look at fucking Japan. They got Honda, Suzuki and Yamaha. So what I'm finding out is a Suzuki's are the best in the corners, but then the Ducati's and Honda's just have too many horses when they go down the straightaway, which is fucking weird to me.

Speaker 1:          10:00          You know, I guess it would depend on the track because the one they were riding, riding on had like two long straightaways. So when he sort of fucking ground the dude and the Suzuki would gain, he would just lose it every time he would go by the grand stands over there. All right. Enough motorcycle talk. But I really enjoyed it. Uh, if you want to jump on board, there's only like 20 fucking racist. They're like 22, 2124 laps. They fly by and you're watching guys going 200 fucking miles an hour on a motorcycle, like an eighth of an inch away from each other. It's done. I'll tell you, it's unfucking believable. I've been given Yannis Pappas Shit, one of my favorite comics out there. Absolutely brilliant guy, but he's like the classic fucking New Yorker where he did this Instagram post, right? And uh,

Speaker 3:          10:49          okay.

Speaker 1:          10:49          He's like in Philadelphia and he goes, look at these, these go and look at the buildings, looking at buildings, look at the buildings. And he goes, every city looks like New New York City for a block and a half. And then the whole thing falls apart. You know? And I this, there's something just so fucking funny about the way New Yorkers travel.

Speaker 3:          11:08          Okay.

Speaker 1:          11:08          You know, every place they go to, if they can't do exactly what the fuck they can do in New York City, the place sucks. It's like you're in Philadelphia. Why would it look like New York City? That's why you travel. Oh, where are all the fucking bill day? The tristate area is arguably the biggest collection of meatheads in the United States of America. And I, and this is saying something cause I grew up in Greater Boston, you know, and if you want to see the level of meat had just watch a Boston sporting event when they pay into the crowd.

Speaker 3:          11:46          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          11:47          All right. And I'm not talking down. I know I'm part of the problem.

Speaker 3:          11:51          Okay.

Speaker 1:          11:51          So I've just been leaving all these fucking messages. How New Yorkers just think everything sucks. This such fucking moron.

Speaker 4:          11:58          Oh, I went to fucking used it, right. I mean Houston, Texas soil linguine and it fucking, it was fucking terrible.

Speaker 2:          12:06          Okay.

Speaker 4:          12:07          Can I get good Italian? A Houston, Texas. Why didn't you get the barbecue? You dumb. Fuck.

Speaker 2:          12:12          Okay.

Speaker 1:          12:13          Why did she get some Tex Mex?

Speaker 4:          12:18          I went to Buffalo. Right. I fucking went to the buffalo wild wings. Fucking wigs. That good

Speaker 1:          12:26          fucking morons. They are fucking morons. And you know what's funny? I um, I went to the Brody Memorial, right? I can't remember. I talked about this on Monday. I still can't get over this. This guy was eulogizing. Is that the right word? Brody Stevens, and he somehow was able to trash Boston twice. It is fucking eulogy. It was one of the high points of it cause it was, you know, it was really uplifting, but it was sad. But it was kind of funny to see that New York fans are that fucking annoyed that we won some championships finally,

Speaker 2:          13:03          you know,

Speaker 1:          13:05          finally one oh couple, you know, and that it's bothering them so much that they're now reduced to making fun of our skyline. Uh, and that stupid shit that ESPN came up with where they would like say that Boston had an inferiority complex is one of my favorite with New York is one of my favorite thing ever. I don't have the heart to tell Him New York is that like, yeah, we don't even, we didn't even know what the, we didn't know what the fuck it looked like. He'd given us too much credit. Um, I, I want to say I already talked about this on Monday, but you know, like whenever they fucking show New England, whenever there's a game in New England, they're always showing some sort of foliage. Uh, something about the revolutionary war and then somebody is eating a fucking oyster or something and it's just like, that's really, that's, that's not a good, uh, that's not a good indication of what's going on.

Speaker 1:          14:04          You know, so somebody in a dive bar with a beer in a fucking shot that, yeah, maybe. And they don't, they don't go to the bull and finch, that stupid fucking cheers thing or whatever the hell it is. Anyways, having said that to all the New York is listening, I absolutely love your city. I love the people. I just don't like the Yankees. That's it. Everything else about it. I absolutely love having said that, I love Philadelphia too. I enjoy Washington DC. Milwaukee's one of my favorite cities. I don't fucking, cause when I go there, I don't try it.

Speaker 4:          14:32          Get fucking, don't, let's get some fucking little fucking clam chowder shut in green bay goat.

Speaker 1:          14:40          MMM

Speaker 4:          14:45          Dude. I, I fucked in. I go to, I go to fucking Argentina, right? Dude, I'm fucking down yet. And I, and I say to the, can I get a fucking

Speaker 1:          14:51          Sam Adams? He got an email he had no Sam Adams. So I told this fucking place sucks.

Speaker 2:          15:02          MMM.

Speaker 1:          15:04          The anybody else. Do you have any stories like that? I shouldn't really just blame New Yorkers, but does anybody else have like a cause? I think country people are like that too. Where they just cut off

Speaker 5:          15:12          to on now y'all deal. There's all these bugs and playful out here, man. Give, give me the wallow for the spice is a mild property.

Speaker 1:          15:21          Get me a four wheeler and a good woman. It does. Now the self esteem to walk off [inaudible] she knows I'll fucking club or over the head and feet are numb up pigs. I've done it before.

Speaker 2:          15:32          Okay.

Speaker 1:          15:32          She knows it.

Speaker 2:          15:34          Okay.

Speaker 1:          15:35          We never talk about it, but she knows that she goes out when she goes to feed the pig. She sees a couple of thugs hanging on a nail. She knows what that means. I told her I'd been married twice before she gets it right? MMM. Yeah. The purpose of traveling is, is, is the when in Rome, right? When in Rome do as the Romans do. That's what you do. All right. You fucking go over there, you go over to fucking, you know, uh, the U K alright. Premiere League. See, get yourself a fucking pint in a scarf and start singing some socks. All right?

Speaker 2:          16:08          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          16:08          You know, pull a VRC like an a Stoney and you talk to some 90 year old woman over there, you know, blazing fast English. Go in like, Hey, do you know where we can watch the NFL divisional round playoffs?

Speaker 3:          16:25          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          16:25          You know what it is? I think about New York is they've just, they've just some too many fucking songs about your city and then all these meatheads who really didn't do that well in school, they think they're part of the success rather than the, they're just background in the movie. Um, as I've always said, Frank Sinatra was bridge and tunnel. He was at Jersey Guy.

Speaker 2:          16:44          Okay.

Speaker 1:          16:44          Breaks and he lives in no work. There's no buildings and fucking place sucks.

Speaker 2:          16:49          Okay.

Speaker 1:          16:49          Um, alright. Plowing ahead here. Uh, I did some stand up the other night, first time since Royal Albert Hall. I had a good time trying out new shit. Just like just nothing. I got nothing. So I'm going to go down to the comedy store possibly this weekend or maybe not this week and maybe next weekend. And I'm just gonna fucking,

Speaker 1:          17:14          I'm just going to do 20 minutes of new shit. I'm just going to have like four or five, six subjects written down and I'm going on stage and I'm just going to stand there and fucking take it. Um, and it's one of my favorite things in the world to do. Um, I was just listening to a Brody special, the one that he has on fucking iTunes and uh, I just, I dunno, just listening to that guy plowing through, it's just one of my favorite things. Definitely going to miss that guy. Um, but it was an incredible memorial service, which I really would think that I talked about it on Monday. I believe I did. I just kept no fucking short term memory. So anyways, Hayden was funny. It was right before I started. I asked my wife if she could just go talk in the other room because she was talking, she had a phone on speaker.

Speaker 3:          18:01          Okay.

Speaker 1:          18:01          And you know, I'm just recording. Just didn't want that shit in the background. Oh my God, the fucking look she gave me.

Speaker 1:          18:08          It's unbelievable. You know, like she's asking me to do shit all the fucking time. Can you go here? Can you pick up this? Can you do this? Can you do that? I'll ask. The Jewish just moved down one room closed the door. She just looked at me, cause I know what she's gonna say. You fucking talk so fucking lad. When you learn the fucking third kick it the khaki cookie to kill you. You know it's always, it always comes back. Always come back. Hey, de Rosa sent me some, I guess they got this new fucking Charlie Manson movie that's coming out with it. They're trying to make the women that Charlie convinced to kill those people. Victims. I don't give a fuck if you're a victim or not. If you're dumb enough that you let some fucking psycho look in Jesus talky window murdering a pregnant woman and then trying to cut the baby out. Yeah, you shouldn't be walking around in society. This is the new fucking thing. The new fucking thing now is to go back in time and find a bunch of selfish cunts and then somehow blame it on guys. And you know what I had started with it started with that stupid movie monster.

Speaker 1:          19:20          Well, that fucking lunatic was a serial killer. And I'm watching the movie and they're trying to make me feel guilty. Like I'm, I'm, I'm part of the problem. I'm the reason why she became, when I saw the Jeffrey Dahmer movie, they didn't do that. They just like, this guy's out of his fucking mind and he's eating people. Um, I dunno, but it's a woman. There has to be a reason.

Speaker 3:          19:40          Okay.

Speaker 1:          19:41          Maybe she just came out of the womb a complete fucking psycho. Right? Maybe that's what it was. I don't fucking know. I think they tried to like find some sort of trajectory in the madness of Jeffrey Dahmer, but at no point that they blame women. Um, although in fairness to the lab, they, um,

Speaker 1:          20:05          who's that guy? That Ed Geanne Guy, the guy from fucking Wisconsin. Uh, they did try to s they did say that his mother fucked him up. So, I don't know, maybe I'm just being a baby, you know, maybe I should have moved to a one room over. Is that, is that what I should have done? Um, all right. So as I mentioned, the Bruins lost two in a row, two in a row, hoping to get back on track here. Um, I'm going to the fucking Gad and a dreams April 2nd. Everybody. April 2nd, I'm doing the God and the dreams with uh, John Stewart. Oh, this is in New York City by the way. Oh my God. The read is unbelievable. It's so much nicer than a Rita's another fucking shit cities. Um, I'm

Speaker 6:          20:47          doing, it's Jerry Seinfeld. Jon Stewart. Alijah Schlesinger's or your, uh,

Speaker 1:          20:56          who else? Who else? Who else? I forget who else. Those are the names that I remember. Oh, and yours truly. How could I forget? Lovely me. Lovely baldy. None even balding balled me. Um, as the name of my one show, one man show, lovely balled me. I've chosen me. I've decided to ignore all the advertising does, saying that I'm not good enough and to say that I, I am good enough. How fragile is your fucking psyche that you fucking sit there looking at advertising and it, and it fucks with you to that level that you're walking out behind a fucking Papa John's throwing up into a handicap parking spot, right? I know what you think of bill. Why would you suggest that Papa John's puts the handicap parking behind? I've never eaten at Papa John's. All right.

Speaker 3:          21:54          Hm?

Speaker 1:          21:55          I like Papa. Ginos Nice fucking Italian. I don't want some guy named John Making my God damn pizza. All right. I want someone who can get a fucking tank. That's someone that Burns in fucking April. Um,

Speaker 1:          22:10          what was I talking about? The, I've just, yeah, I mean, what the fuck is wrong with you? First of all, the arrogance of you that you look at a Victoria's secret model and you feel like you'd have to compete with that. First of all, you can't any more than I can compete with a Brad Pitt. So what is the fucking problem? And the second of all, once the last time you saw a Victoria's secret model walking to the bar that you're drinking at all, right? You fucking regular looking person. You're an irregular looking person bar, you know with me in the second and eight walks in the room, everybody fucking turns like, like Bo Derek just k walking in and that movie 10 Hollywood just create season. Possible Standard. Yes. It's a movie. I don't understand. Like when they do this reboot boot a top gun, I'm not going to feel like I need to learn how to fly a fucking f a teen or wherever the fuck they're flying. Was it [inaudible] they up to the 19. What are they up to now? Let's see. Uh, you as a top fighter jet. All right, what do we got here?

Speaker 1:          23:32          Don't even fucking tell me. It's called this the Sukhoi sue 57 what is it made in Japan? Do we make anything here? Please tell me. In Asian American came up with that and they make this an Indiana please. For the love of God. Do you guys have fucked up? That was if, if all our fighter jets are made in Japan and then we have beef with them again and it's like, hey man, can you keep making it? Making it as jet. So like we can get you back for bombing the other part of Hawaii now, a top 10 best fighter jets in the world. The top seven US fighter jets. I'll come. They're not, they're not doing the, uh, the f anymore. The JTTF 22.

Speaker 3:          24:13          Yeah,

Speaker 1:          24:14          dude, I'm so old. I remember, I remember the EF 60. They have 60 was the Bob and I remember a two 40 [inaudible] before the two 80 [inaudible] before the 300. All right. I remember the f 100. I don't, who's the F-150 enough to 50. I just needed another example was another one where they just kept going up the Mazda rx seven. What are they up to? Nine. I love how they just, they don't start it. One like Jordan's like the sneakers, you know, then there's the Jordan twos, Jordan threes. They started like seven.

Speaker 3:          24:52          Okay.

Speaker 1:          24:52          Or a hundred. Um, if you wonder what the fuck I'm talking about. I don't, I don't know either. All right. I have no idea. But anyways, I'm doing the guy,

Speaker 7:          25:02          ah,

Speaker 1:          25:04          no dreams on, uh, April 2nd. It's in the, uh, it's the theater at Madison Square Garden. As I mentioned on Monday, this is where Eddie Murphy did, uh, the raw special. So I always think about that. So I will be there and I'm also the day before I'm going to go try to go to a Brooklyn Nets game. Now I haven't gone to a pro game in a minute as far as checking another one off the list. And I had forgotten I only need like six more teams and I've been to a home game of every protein in all four fucking sports. Now there's a very select few of you that thinks that's awesome and that's who I'm talking to right now. The rest of you could just fucking zone out because this part of the podcast, it's not about you

Speaker 1:          25:46          any more than, than an average look at woman. It has to feel intimidated because you know, there's another Cindy Crawford coming along or daughters now going to make a whole other generation of people not feel pretty enough. And I got to tell you something there, there is a beauty in coming to the realization that you, you aren't pretty enough. And just embracing that, just being like, you know what? I'm going to be the coolest six that walks into this bar tonight. It's all right being a six. Then just add, add to it. You know, tell a couple of jokes, learn how to juggle. You know what I mean? It's like you ever see somebody when they get a three, a Chrysler 300 and they try, they try to make it look like a Bentley. That's what you do. But at no point do you actually say that you're a fucking Bentley or do you get mad that somebody is making a Bentley?

Speaker 1:          26:41          Does any of that makes sense? I don't fucking know. Um, this is usually a point here when I would read some advertising, but I didn't get any so far. I wonder why. Probably because I shit on every God damn one of them, you know, and they fucking sensitive. I think these women today have fucking sets it. If you think these millennials get their feelings hurt, see these fucking advertising companies get see a goddamn thing. Um Oh, I do have a read. Here we go. Dollar Shave club dude has everything you need to look, feel and smell your best and you never have to go to was still war. That's because they delivered everything you need right to your front door. You're lazy bastard and they keep you fully stocked and what you, what you use so you don't run out. Here's how it works. Dollar Shave Club has everything you need to get ready.

I guess Liverpool, my adopted team is still down a point to those man city cons. All right. With their uh wait, where did they get their money from? Somebody told me, God damn it, it's not Saudi Arabia, is it? Did they get it from our Air Emirates? Is that when they get it from the airline? Throw some of their first class fucking ticket money at them. I don't remember.

Speaker 1:          28:53          Anyways, they're down a point that down a point and they got a game. Liverpool's got a game on Monday. They pay full of is I would say so they're probably full hand full. You go buy Bulla Wall on Saint Patty's Day. Oh Saint Patty's day. You got to get out there. Where your green plastic cat. You know, where's my Hashtag on that day where I get offended? Everybody's going at [inaudible] alligator. The low net goes, okay, everyone's getting shit. If you don't realize how fucked up that is, you know how funny it is? Irish people are part Irish people. They go out and they'd just like, there's no other fucking holiday.

Speaker 3:          29:27          Okay?

Speaker 1:          29:27          You know where people go out in, in people who are, are that nationality, literally go out and do the most like negative stereotype of themselves. You know, black history month, everybody's on their best behavior, right? Jewish holidays, everybody's fucking Shelan. Saint Patty's day one app, it's high. Everybody goes out, gets drunk in the fucking street, dresses like a Leprechaun and passes out in the gutter. That's what happens, right? Fucking corn, beef sandwich fucking hanging out of the Saudi of mouth. That's why I always hated about that holiday. It's like one of the prides of the Irish is not only do you drink, he can handle your fucking liquor. Don't, but don't. Can you guys just don't, just don't make a mess yourself. Fucking sitting there drinking green beer the fuck he you doing? Oh Shit. Odell Beckham Jr goes from the giants to the Cleveland browns. Cleveland Brown fans beside themselves can't believe their good fortune. Now they got a, they got that kid there. What's his face there? They got the quarterback. I just spaced on his name. Baker Mayfield. Right. He's got a little bit of a swagger. He likes talking a little bit of Shit. Right. He likes doing something and doing a little dance in front of the fucking crowd. Now he's got a wide receiver.

Speaker 1:          30:59          Right. So what's, what's this might work if they have like an Al Davis old school sort of thing because this reminds me of what the Raiders used to do, where they would take the fucking people. Everybody said don't take are the outcasts from other teams and then they would go in there and everybody would just be themselves and they would have a good time.

Speaker 3:          31:18          Okay.

Speaker 1:          31:19          I hope it works out for the browns. My Gut says I can't say that it won't. It just all depends on the coach.

Speaker 3:          31:27          Okay.

Speaker 1:          31:27          The personality, like that's a good rex Ryan team. Cause then he's talking shit. Oh Dell's talkin shit. Baker's doing what the fuck he does. Uh, but it's definitely going to be exciting. But I actually think of, I think it was a good move from, for the giants. He didn't kind of fit into their, they have vibe, defensive minded organization. You look at Eli shows up, he's got Khakis on, he tucks his shirt in. I mean that's, that's what the giants I guess have become, I don't know, you listened to some of those lt stories. Oh, Dellschau fit right in. But um, I dunno. It was a big move and I don't, I don't think they had to give up, give up too much for the guy. And they got a lot of draft picks. So see what they do. And A, I've got a couple friends of mine that, a Cleveland Brown fans and they're all saying they're GM knows what he's doing. So who knows?

Speaker 3:          32:20          Hmm.

Speaker 1:          32:21          The only thing I need are to Cleveland plans is to stop calling you stupid city. The land,

Speaker 1:          32:28          the land. Ugh. Fucking Midwest people. The land, the Berg did they call the natty get on the bus. You're in Columbus, you get it the day. Welcome to the day. So what they say in Dayton? Uh, uh, all right. Sorry, I'm being a cunt, but it's what I do. All right. That's it. I'm going to be, uh, out and about in La doing some spots bombing this weekend, uh, probably down the store on Friday. That's the deal. All right, so go Bruins, go Celtics baseball is starting up. A interesting stat here, and this is something on the success of the New York Yankees. Do you realize in New York Yankees are so fucking successful? That sense they got babe Ruth all right. From the 1920s to this decade, they've only gone one decade where they didn't win a war, at least one world series. And that was the 1980s. And even still, they went to a world series in [inaudible] 81 and lost. Right. If they don't win this year, this'll be the first time that that's the only second time this has happened since women were allowed to vote. Okay. Which was another huge, huge fucking mistake by this country.

Speaker 2:          33:58          Okay.

Speaker 1:          34:00          You should have kept those fucking prides in the kitchen. No. Um, I think it's great that they could talk more. Um, anyways, am I the only one who's like not looking forward to this next election, presidential election? I just, I just don't see this. I just didn't see it being a repeat of a few years ago and it's just going to be a fucking train wreck.

Speaker 2:          34:30          MMM.

Speaker 1:          34:32          Until you get that cancer out of the locker room. I just don't know what it's going to be. I, if I, you know, if I was running for president on the democratic side, what I would learn how to do is talk some shit. All right. Stop trying to talk about issues. What you need to do is you need to go in there and you need, you need to make fun of his hair. Make Fun of that to pay. Make Fun of his fucking big motherly hips. You gotta you gotta go after him like that. All right. Why is, why is your face orange and underneath your eyes, his ghost white? Do you have a tanning bed? Is that some sort of cream that you put under your eyes for puffiness? That's what you do. Do not go up there and try to talk policy and interrupt the shit out of him. Just do what he does. Completely ignore all the fucking rules. And then when you get called on it just act like a victim. All right? That's what it's going to be. This is what politics is fucking become. Okay.

Speaker 2:          35:25          MMM.

Speaker 1:          35:28          I mean, I'm acting like it was on the up and up before that, but uh, I don't know. We shall see. Although I do have to give Trump some props grounding that, that airplane, right? He did do that. He did try to pull the troops out of Syria. You saw the Democrats and Republican. Whoa, Whoa, Whoa, Whoa, whoa. Don't do that. You biting the hand that feeds bite net corporate cash. I'll spill it out of their pockets. And you watch all you ladies out there loving your girl there.

Speaker 6:          37:13          you know, and that show and I, Naomi Campbell, she's like 52 and she's still affects me. So it's like Tyra got a lot of years to go day. Who did we see walking away from that hotel that day? Oh, I, Cheryl t is Cheryl Tiegs. They're looking good. That time is a bitch, man. Dime is a bitch. No, I doing, I'm wasting my mental. And I think you got a bit of a fetish. No, you for awhile. And older white women. And he picked some bad with Hillary Clinton. I, my favorite number one is Carly Simon. I will still pop Cory Simon. I don't know why. I know why everybody got their fucking fetishes. Alvin cow cover alone, which she was on all fours, I suppose. That big mouth. Yeah, that's what I'm saying, man. That bitch is, by the way, a lot of people backed us up on that one. Wow. Yeah. Backyard. A lot of people calling and saying, Lord, we saw moving back though.

Speaker 6:          38:18          We saw Cheryl Tiegs leaving the Donald Trump roast. Yeah, Cheryl Tiegs. We had the great seats from Voss. Well yeah. Alright. Fairly in the buildings and thanks rich and I cocked your checkers for the Trump roast section. Oh, I'm going to be, we, we were behind a monitor that was showing the rows behind it on the second floor. Dude, everyone's going in the main ballroom and we headed, our tickets I got were going to be hobnobbing with the, the top celebrities in New York. Right. Awesome. The usher, it looks at our tickets and goes, Oh God, take that elevator. But W and then you're thinking, all right, well, you know, it's an elevator you ever see a roast with is an upstairs. It's always, it's the, the day is and the table upstairs that are roasted. So at first we're like, all right, well we'll follow all the other people that have seats in that area.

Speaker 6:          39:10          No, there were maybe another 20 people that had sciatic area. And we sit down and then I have my seat stunk. I had him stand up and look over this video screen to see anything. I couldn't tell who was up at the, they were tiny day. Everybody gets in the elevators, like holding cable and Shit. Yeah, that's what it was. They were all tech guys. Gaffers. They were heading for the fucking beat mixing board. So we're heading for the walkways high above. That's, so we leave. The roasts were walking back towards the station and uh, we're right behind Cheryl Tiegs and her white old saggy ass. Like how bad does it look though? I mean tears and I'm saying for an old old lady, she probably isn't that bad. But when you compare her to the Cheryl Tiegs poster that was on everybody's wall with the netting that she was just wearing a neck and her nipples were poking through. I mean you wouldn't fuck Sophia Loren. No, cause she exists 60 something years.

Speaker 6:          40:15          There's got to be just a glimpse of just young Sophia's one trial, half a pussy lip, paint enough. Believe me. And when you see these people out, remember they are looking at their absolute best. This is the best they can possibly look. How old is Cheryl Tiegs? 50 gotta be, she's got to be in her in her fifth phase five and no redeeming sexuality. She's not drunk. I didn't see any redeeming sexuality. I saw an older woman that you look at and go, all right, she's an older woman that doesn't look like she's ready to fall apart. What do you, you know the old broad women like who continue to dye their hair like that. It becomes like a fucking birds nest right out. And also like as you get into like you get into like your sixties it's like the smell of rotten pending death. So he started having that old person smell. So you see the top of their head because it gets to what you tall it and see right through that Kenny hair. It's like that fucking white cotton candy hair and scalp price. Low box to the back of her hand. And she kept jerking you off.

Speaker 6:          41:36          You gotta you gotta fucking old Sophia Loren and fucking movie on the TV. Trying not to look at the what happened in that whole Rod, don't you got back up? Oh Shit. Close your eyes. Close your eyes. So an open the Ark of the Covenant in front of that Bitch. Right on man. No she, she, she looks like you know a nice older lady. But you know you have a view of just against, you're just against old bitches. I could feel it. You know what? I disagree with that. I, I when, when it's because the hardest old bitch you could just be, cause he's compared to the memory has been what it is. I'm, I'm remembering what she looked like. Oh who's the hottest old bitch we knew her was because she was a sex symbol. So already there. Your old bitch. I know. And and and his is, the criteria is Diane Sawyer. It's not one that became, that used to be hot and super hard and just maintain it, but like, oh wow. She used to wait. She's, she used to be super hot but now she's all bitch like Cheryl Tiegs but she, you still like what's up? God knows. I mean now motherfucker now lack then not when she was old in 80 I remember goofy makeup on my right this second. She's a bad bitch. God Damn. At least what's, what's old enough?

Speaker 6:          43:14          Go back to the seventies and think who do, who did I want to fuck back then with China? But they were all, I never wanted to pop gripe mom's back then it was never a hot looking at arm, which that you would now Pam Greer, Pam Greer, a Jessica Simpson and sees all the old side, the, I took the bid and went the other way. I can write, I think I'm trying, I'm going through like old 70s TV show kind of things cause I'm in [inaudible] 80 minutes or area.
