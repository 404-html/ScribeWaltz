Speaker 1:          00:00:01       Hey, what's going on? It's bill burn his time for the Monday morning podcast for Monday, December 21st, 2050. What's going on? How are you? Hey, it's almost the end of the year. Did I take time out to say thanks. Thank you for being, you know, bringing your vibe. Um, seriously, I want to thank everybody who's been watching. F is for family. All right. Now, Netflix doesn't give out any ratings, you know, lonely. They keep them, they keep them to themselves. You know, like a fat kid with cookies. You know, they don't, they don't tell anybody what's going on. So I have no idea. All I can judge by is the, uh, the feedback you guys have been giving me on Twitter, Facebook, and wherever the hell else you guys are. Right? And now you guys seem to be liking it. So thank you so much for watching the God damn show.

Speaker 1:          00:00:53       Please tell your friends about it. I'm very happy that people are enjoying it. We worked our asses off on it. So with that, let's get on with the podcast. Um, as you know, it's really late today. You no later than it usually is. Um, I just have family in town and, um, I dunno. They're like regular people so they sleep and um, you know, they sleep and they sleep and they sleep. And I am, I don't, I don't get it. I mean, I go to bed after I go to bed after regular people and I wake up before them, you know, it's probably because they're like, I dunno, more just at peace with themselves so they could just keep sleeping. But my brain keeps going on how's the whole fucking night? So I mean, I can get about six hours and then I got to get up and start doing something or I go absolutely fucking insane.

Speaker 1:          00:01:47       So, um, I wasn't able to record this morning because everybody was still sleeping and I do walk around and be on eggshells. So of course I'm on the phone with Versie and we yelling about sports and, uh, my wife came out and let me know, you know, you got to stop walking around screaming at the top of your lungs, into your phone, having sports arguments with people. You do it at all hours of the day. You have people on, on speaker and you're screaming about sports and it's really affecting the environment in the house. Now, if I was a mature adult, I'd be like, you know what? You're absolutely right. I should be considerate. I can only imagine if you were walking around screaming about all the Shit you watch on Bravo TV, that unbelievably fucking, I don't just do void of any sort of intellect than that fucking cunt of a channel. I swear to God, if I knew somebody in, in the CIA, I bet it goes Isis and then Bravo TV and then whoever's the fight or no, I don't know who would be the next person that's going to go after. It's just as far as like, you know, fucking

Speaker 2:          00:03:00       up this country. Isis, Bravo TV, Eh, uh, I don't know. Bravo TV's. That's a broad brush that gets rid of a lot of people. But anyways, so if I was a mature adult, I would have just been like, you know what? You're absolutely right. But instead, what did I say? I said, well, you know, you fucking sleep all day. You sleep. They'll like, you know, all hours of the day and I get to walk around tippy toe. And she was just like talking about that.

Speaker 1:          00:03:26       It's like, yeah, well I am. I'm talking about that. Why are you talking about it? Because I know you're right in the other area that the of the debate. So I already have a new year's resolution, no more screaming on my phone in the house about sports TV. And there you go. Once again, I'll work on myself as a human being and slowly stopped being the bill that you know and love and I'll become that thing they want you to be. And one day they wake up, they go, oh, work's done. I'm bored. I think I'll go blow somebody else. And you know what? That's, you know, that's the trajectory of most marriages. You know, everything they liked about you, they start to fucking hate. Then they fix it and then they deal. You're somebody different than they walked down the street just given handies who wants one, who gets jobs? The married woman coming down

Speaker 2:          00:04:18       street took my dog for a walk today all the way around the block and it didn't ship once. It's just, you know, it usually shits like two, three times. So I got all paranoid and I was looking around the house trying to find dog shit. I couldn't find it anywhere. Then I was thinking like did it shit his braids out the day before. So they just, it's got nothing left. I don't know. You know something. This might be one for veterinarian. Maybe I should call him my brother and just talking the fuck in the empty space of podcasting. That's right. Podcast. I did that. A fighter and the kid Brian Collins podcast. I did that earlier today. So look for that.

Speaker 2:          00:05:03       You probably wonder what Jesus belt, why are you so fucking lethargic? Cause because you only get six hours sleep now because me and a buddy of mine went to a burger place that somebody suggested down in watts. La is in the watts riots. That's your reason why people, white people know about watch. They got a hamburger place down there called Hawkins and we went down there, there was three of us. Why does fuck, why does fuck a new show on Bravo? Um, and we drove down there and uh, we were all laughing, just going, all right, three of the whities people ever going to go down to watch, you know, are we going to get mugged his second we get out of the car? Are they going to think we're cops? You know, all the scared white guy thinks. And then we showed up and was staring at the fucking menu and this guy just,

Speaker 1:          00:05:46       hey, is this your first time here? Or we go, yeah. Then they go first timers and everything. Kitchen yelled at, well, I don't know. Kids came look at after school special. It was hilarious. And then as a white person you're like, Oh really? Isn't that down? I get it. No, almost in my thoughts are just fear based. Right? And then there's always that one dude's just got to fuck it up for everybody. Right. It's guy showed up. Fucking weird, weird vibe. Had a US air force bag. He just sort of left it in the middle of the area where we eating and then walked away from it. Sat in the corner, was sort of staring at us and he was eating peanuts. He wasn't eating a burger. And then he walked outside and walked around to the open window area where we were at. And then he offered us peanuts. We were like, no thank you. We would, we don't want any of your peanuts. And then we sort of finished up and we went to leave and he was staring at us and he wrote down our license plate number.

Speaker 1:          00:06:44       Ah, it's awful. It's awful what go into war does to you. But I think he was super fucking paranoid already. Um, I'm bummed piecing it together. I certainly wasn't gonna have a conversation with the guy was judging by the, the, the US air force bag and then, uh, you know, the paranoid behavior and he had something on his fucking risks. Like he get fucked up his wrist or something like that. I have no fucking idea. But all I can tell you is I'm going to go back there again because it was the best guy, Dan Berger. I think I might be the best Burger I've ever had, but Jesus fucking Christ, it's the size of a football. Um, and you know, if you're a goal oriented person, you know, you're going to get about three bites and going, holy fuck, this is delicious. You're going to get halfway through and you're going to be like, dude, do I win a tee shirt if I finish this thing?

Speaker 1:          00:07:33       And then finally just like, you know, I, I can't, I got to finish this thing. Ah, fries are delicious. I got the, uh, the fat burger with egg and it was outstanding. Um, it's called Hawkins. It's right off of south central I believe. And uh, it was fucking delicious. And I was like, thank God, because I was bringing, you know, it was a recommendation from a couple of people I met when I did yet another failed pilot. And, uh, you know, I love meeting people that are actually from Los Angeles because they love Los Angeles. And then they know all the cool places to go. So, um, most people who are transplants like me stay basically in the Hollywood valley area. So I asked these guys, I'm like, give me something. What do you got? What do you guys say you want to, you want to fucking, you know, you want to try something?

Speaker 1:          00:08:23       Go and go down to watts. We went down there, it was absolutely fucking delicious, but I'll tell you this right now, I am paying for it. Uh, there's no way you won't fit. If you're smart, you'll go down, then you'll split one. Um, but if you listening to this podcast, you're probably not smart and you're going to order one yourself and you're going to, you're going to do what I just did. And, uh, but it's a wonderful experience until you get right to the end and your body keeps saying, stop it. Stop it. What are you doing? Stop it. And you just can't, you just keep fucking shovel and in your face and then

Speaker 2:          00:08:56       you just lean in on something, you and on something. You're like, why did I just do that? Uh, I got, I got to be on the fucking elliptical for nine years, and then all of a sudden a fucking air force veterans off and your peanuts and you want to stay and say, no, you want to stand up straight. Like you're somebody that can't be fucked with, you know, and you just can't do it. And you just lean in there and then maybe it comes off as confidence and maybe that's why it leaves you alone. I have no fucking idea. But, um, oh my God, my mouth is dry. There was so much fucking salt and me right now, you know, Jesus Christ. But you know what? It was worth it. I was actually site, they went down there and watch this great documentary, which of course, I can't remember the name of it, but forest, where did the, uh, the, uh, the narration on it and it was all about, mmm, the history of Los Angeles and the gangs and all of that stuff and police violence and everything.

Speaker 2:          00:09:49       And um, it actually broke down all those different areas that you always hear about it, you know? Oh, you able saw straight outta Compton and actually know where, where Compton is. You know what I mean? It's ridiculous. It's one of the great groups of all fucking time. He should know where it is and it's La is just so fucking weird like that. They pave over their history. Then I'll fucking tell you where anything is. It's all about the highways. Take the four oh five to the 10 you guys have watched, said SNL, sketch the cow for onions. Right. And they'd be like, Devin, like that sketch was so fucking accurate as far as like everybody's obsessed with like, uh, when did you come from and where do you live in? It's always, ah, I took the one oh five to the one 10 to the 60, you know, got off at fucking Mulholland.

Speaker 2:          00:10:42       It's all obsession about how to get it. Uh, I know how you got somewhere because of this fucking Alicia's traffic. So anyways, I am a, I am full of salt right now and I am not going to eat again until breakfast time. Morrow. Ah, fuck. Ah, but it was worth it. It was fucking worth it. I had like one bite of that and I'm like, I am bringing Nia here tomorrow. And then I got halfway through the Burger and I was like, I am bringing Nia here in about a month. And then I finished it and I was just like, in six months when I'm not full, what am I full again? I'm so fucking full right now. I can't even finish my sentences. Oh, it was Gloria said it's really a feeling that so few people in the world. No, most people are starving, you know? So I'm trying to feel privileged right now, even though it's a big part of me wants to kill myself. Oh, it hurts to laugh. Jesus Christ now was Thanksgiving between two bucks. It was fucking my buddy. One of my buddies had a pastrami sandwich. He said, I'm three bites in. I still haven't made it to the bud. He was smart enough to stop me and my other friend just, we just kept going and he had to fucking

Speaker 1:          00:11:54       drive. I wanted real client ran, wanted to recline the seat so fucking bad. But I was afraid that if I were Clyde, it was all going to come up. All right, Bill enough, you talked about dog shitting in overeating. Is this supposed to be exciting? Well, it's that time of year. It's that time of year when you can say come on and eat a man hole size fucking burger. It was incredible. Um, so anyways, what's, why don't we, uh, why don't we talk about some shit other than dog shitting in a meeting, an oversized burger. Um, AH, stupid password. I can never reopen thing.

Speaker 1:          00:12:34       Still fucked it up. Uh, how about the, uh, how about those New England patriots sort of limping along? Um, I don't think we're going to do any damage this year. I really, I just don't think it's our fucking year, man. We just got too many injuries and uh, I watched the giants panthers, as I mentioned, I, when I was promoting the F is for family. Last week, I got to do rich eyes and show. I called in and I was talking about how I thought the giants panthers game was going to be the game of the week is far as either the giants turned the fucking corner, like they always seem to in December and make one of those great playoff runs to spite their record. Um, or the panthers are going to basically go into feed it and win the super bowl. That's what the fuck I was saying.

Speaker 1:          00:13:21       Of course. Who and what do, what do I know? Just a comedian. But I watched the game was a great game and of course everybody was freaking out about Odell Beckham in. I was a guy, Norman, um, I can't believe back of didn't get fucking injected, you know what I mean? I swear to God that was fucking unbelievable. But however though a lot of me, I really enjoyed it. I loved them getting each other's fate. I didn't, I didn't like him launching him helmet to helmet, that type of hit. But, uh, I was talking to another friend of mine, I said it reminded me of Mel Blunt and Golden Richards back in the day except golden. Richard's fought back. Um, but it's interesting cause Beckham kind of acted like a big fucking baby cause he wasn't getting any catches just cause he got roughed up a little bit.

Speaker 1:          00:14:05       And uh, I kind of agree with a w I hope I'm saying his name right. Becca. Was it not a pack of, I mean a Norman, right. Ah Fuck there. Why don't you look up shit before you fucking start talking about it then you've got to type with one index finger and that's not fun for anybody. Right. Um, yeah. Josh Norman, he said he kind of cracked the code on him. You get under his skin a little bit. So I think, I think more people are going to try to fuck with back home cause God knows if he just tried to cover him. You can't, you can't do it.

Speaker 1:          00:14:40       The, once again, the football gods love the giants. They love him. How to fuck do you get away? This guy ran like fucking 30 and just jumped in the air, headfirst into another guy's fucking help, I guess because it was away from the play. They didn't see it. Um, three personal files. I Dunno. You know what it really comes down to you as you know much as all you can. Oh, the fucking Brady rule. There really is the superstar rule. If you're a fucking superstar Rican, throw that guy out of that game. You know, you couldn't do it. He's one of the superstars saying they need to make their money first and then about 50 other things and then they try to protect the players. Cause even now that the fact that they're trying to protect players, why are they protect him? Flip protecting their wallets now that everybody there.

Speaker 1:          00:15:29       What's that from? No, you are looking at a man that doesn't judge another man by the size of his go on what movie? Fucking Wall Street doe. Charlie's Shay doing that scene with his fucking fuck with Martin Sheen. Right. Oh, Bud Fox. Um, anyways, but I was texting back and forth between Versie and Yannis Pappas and uh, you know, they kept doing this, you know, this isn't, you know, what did giants are coming back and this is New York, this is what New York does. And I was just writing. Eli is from Louisiana. You know that state met part of the country that all New Yorkers looked down upon. You know, he's, he just country walk Louisiana. That's who the fuck he is. All right. He's yet another Non New Yorker who came to New York and took over. Because when you look at the competition, come on man. You know, I'm just talking about white people here.

Speaker 1:          00:16:30       Okay? I'm not talking about other fucking ethnicities because I don't know what you guys are bringing to the table. I don't pretend to know. Every once in a while listen to your music. I tapped my toes and that's about the extent of it. Well, maybe I'd come down and eat your food. That's about it. But other than that, I'm pretty fucking white. So all I know is the white people in New York at generally speaking you it, it's not reason not real deep. Most of those cuts down Wall Street and not from New York. The jerk off finance, finance majors from all around the country go down there and start knocking on the bone. And what does New York do about it? They don't do a fucking thing. They went from gangs in New York when people just walking around with hatchets and shit to, to now, it's just, it's a fucking cake walk.

Speaker 1:          00:17:08       It's like when a Pachino said this is like one big pole. Wait, no, they'll fuck. That's what New York is. And then if you go there and you succeed, then they say you're a New Yorker. You know what I mean? Pad It. New York is such pds. It's fucking ridiculous nowadays. At least with white people, I'm telling, you know what I mean? All of great rappers obviously, and basketball stars and that type of shift come from New York. But other than that, white people are generally speaking, the average white New York. I'm telling you, it's just, and he's not bringing it. He's standing outside of a tad stakes. You know, when his sweatpants got his little fucking Sony Walkman on listening to Alicia keys.

Speaker 3:          00:17:47       Oh, do woo.

Speaker 1:          00:17:51       You know, thinking you're a part of it. You're not a part of it. You just, you just one of the ants running around Frank Sinatra's from Hoboken, New Jersey. He's bridge and fucking tunnel and he came in and took over your fucking city. All right. Eli Manning breathes through his fucking mouth and he looks, he looks like a five year old in a football uniform. He died. Just does, it's got no style of the man wears dockers for Christ's sake. And he comes in there and look at them. He's lining up under center. Um, anyways, why am I shitting all over them? I actually fucking love the giants. I do have to tell you though, a Jew Jpp that fucking, you know, that wrap that he now has on his hand. It looks like he's holding a fucking frying pan. I swear to God. If somebody on the Patriots deflected one pass with that fucking thing, it would be illegal and we would lose draft picks and I'm, I'm doing that every week from now on. That's going to be my new fucking thing. I'll tell you right now.

Speaker 1:          00:18:54       Did you see when he knocked down that passed with the fucking bulk of that, that bandage on his wrist? I'm telling you that's his new move rather than second. That wasting his energy, sacking the quarterback. You just hold up that giant fucking stop sign. It's an incredible, you know, obviously it's fucking tragic and I am trying to make light of it because I, I honestly feel, you know, it's just a fucking horrible that that accident had to happen. But you know, then all of a sudden the team you want to win throws a ball and he fucking puts his hand up in, you know, all the sympathy goes out the one do you like, dude, what the fuck is that legal? He's like holding up one of those giant light bulbs, you know, that using science experiments.

Speaker 4:          00:19:39       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:19:41       Anyways, I mean it's almost as big as my head. I'll tell you, if you could somehow wrap my head around your fucking hand, you know, and stuck it up, you, you wouldn't, you would lead the league in a past defenses. Is that what they call them? I Dunno what they call them. All I know is I really enjoyed that war between a Norman and a Odell Beckham and I loved it. Norman called him a bitch at the end of the game and I don't think he should be fine. Obviously Odell should, you know, you can't jump off you fucking feed like that doing a sailor's dive into the side of somebody's fucking ear hole. What are you thinking? You know what I mean? But I swear to God, it reminds me of Mel Blunt, Golden Richards. Golden Richards had blonde hair just like a Dell Becca, you know? No, you don't know that. Well, you know something. I do something. I like to think about it.

Speaker 4:          00:20:30       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:20:31       Oh fuck. I'm so God damn full. This is so stupid though. Why? Why, why did I do this by the way? I always, I always forget to do the c out of the podcast. Email, ladies and gentleman, the podcast email is bill at the [inaudible] podcast.com bill@themmpodcast.com.

Speaker 2:          00:20:51       Um, oh my God, I'm sorry guys, I got to keep fucking drinking water. I'm so full of fucking salt right now. I'm just talking to a buddy of mine. He thought he had a tapeworm swear to God they should be. You know what you know like, you know what? Sell like fucking hotcakes right around this time of year tapeworms that we're almost at the end of their lives and if he could just somehow force it down, you know, and just during the holiday season you eat like a fucking animal and it eats 90% of the nutrition and then it just fucking keels over and dies like Marlon Brando when he's out in the garden with his son or his grandson.

Speaker 2:          00:21:36       Wouldn't it be great? Then you can just eat and drink like a fucking maniac. And this tape warm just takes it all and then it dies and then you know, for the next couple of weeks when you have to go to the potty, he just don't turn around and look the most disgusting fucking podcast I've ever done. I'm sorry. I started off with dog shit and I mean, where do I go? He can't make a comeback. He might as well borrow a little further into it. Right. Um, is there anything worse than when you go out to take your dog on a fucking hour and a half hike and you realize you only have one shitbag left, you know, then you've got to make that decision. I'm either going to leave some stuff, I'm going to leave some behind like Willem defoe and platoon or I'm going to have to get, try to get creative and that shit in the bag.

Speaker 2:          00:22:23       And then he got dropped the shit out onto the new shit and then you just fucking did it as just, it's a, it's a fucking nightmare. Oh God. How gross can this become? I just, is there any women's still listening? This is disgusting. Are you like this guy? You think it's guides? Funny. Shut up Margaret. Shut up. All right. Anyway, a woman right now yelling you husband or boyfriend right now. You need to stand the fuck down. Okay? You know what? You're going to make them do this fucking holiday season. Let them man listen to a fucking podcast for Christ's sake. Look at him. He's going to die eight years before you can. Can you have a heart and be nice to him on average, she's going to die eight years before you. That's the deal. I should like Dick Van Dyke, 90 years old and he's still dancing.

Speaker 2:          00:23:12       Still got the light and his iron man. It fucking guy was sharp as hell. I think that's the key to it is dancing. Is it? I Dunno. Maybe figuratively dance thing in your heart. Walking down the street. Just still hearing the birds Chirp. Sorry. Oh my God. Oh fuck. I'm going to take a on. You know what?

Speaker 2:          00:32:28       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:32:30       Anyways, I did a, uh,

Speaker 2:          00:32:32       mentioned, oh fuck.

Speaker 1:          00:32:36       It's really is not a good feeling, man. It was people. But, you

Speaker 2:          00:32:40       know, I just, I recommend not doing a podcast right after you fucking eat one of these goddamn things. Um, oh my God. So anyways, like I mentioned, I did, uh, I did fighter and the kid podcast today, and when Brian Callen wasn't talking about his amazing athletic physique, I was talking, trying to talk to a professional fighter. Uh, Brendan Shab always said his last name correctly. Um, and I was just fascinated with the ability to slip a punch and how they just stare at the center of your chest and look for some movement in your shoulders and they're able to somehow slipped the fucking punch. It was amazing to me. We talked about cauliflower ears and at what points you're not, you can't drain them anymore because I guess initially it's blood and then it turns all fucking had. Um, I dunno, that's probably more interesting than anything that I fucking talked about.

Speaker 2:          00:33:35       But in everybody fights for a living man, I wanted to talk more about that. I hope I get to do the podcast again cause if it's just a way to get Brian Count is stop talking about himself, there's somehow a way to do that. Um, I had a lot of interesting questions but you know, Brian's somehow gets himself in between you and the interesting thing that could actually happen and he just has to talk about is a geometric shape, which I believe he described as an upside down triangle being screwed into something else. I don't know. Manly an old TV tube. I forgot what he described as lower portion of his body, but you know, it's just one description after another about his amazing physique. I'm fucking with the OCL. See Brown county. Um, so listen to that this week. And uh, with that, why don't I get into the fucking questions before I literally fall asleep. Alright. Uh, Terry Reed, everybody, I don't know who that is. I know Tara Reid, Rita's Terry Reid. Hey there,

Speaker 1:          00:34:36       Billy Bilbo Baggins. Just wondering if you ever heard of Terry Reed. Uh, he was offered by Jimmy page to be the front man to his new yard birds.

Speaker 2:          00:34:47       Yeah. Birds Band

Speaker 1:          00:34:49       and said that he had a couple of guys that would be better for the job. Robert Plant and John Bonham. I love this story and I love Terry's music. If you hadn't heard his stuff, checkout seed of memory, uh, to be treated right. And Dean are my favorites. I guess there's a documentary. Super lungs is coming out soon anyways, I've never heard you mentioned it before and thought it'd be right up your alley. Oh, well that's amazing. You know, there's a bunch of those kinds of fucking stories.

Speaker 2:          00:35:21       Like somebody sent me one recently, I think I might've talked about it, about a guy who filled in for Ringo Starr for like two weeks at the height of Beatle Mania. Ringo had like tonsillitis or something. And of course it was the early 60 [inaudible] so it was damn near fatal. You know what I mean? He had it yet. I like fucking go to some witch doctor Assam Shit to get cured. So they had this other guy sit in and he went from complete nobody to being totally famous in every chicken, the world that couldn't fuck Lennon McCartney or fucking Harrison was jumping on his dick and then the whole fucking thing ended two weeks later and no one knew who he was. And he was just like, what the fuck was that? Um, and I guess, you know, he didn't want to make a documentary out of it, but I recently, I was, I was going through Twitter and they showed a picture of them is great picture.

Speaker 2:          00:36:18       It's great for me looking at it to get a sense of what it was like after he was in the Beatles, probably crushing for him. He was sitting in a, I'm at an airport waiting for a flight. And he was like the only guy there, just sitting there by himself with his Beatles haircut. They made him get a Beatles haircut and wear like a fucking Ringo style suit. And uh, then he was just like, why, what the, what the fuck happened? Within two years he was broke and out of the music business, um, they just kind of lifted him up and gave him all right there for it, right back down. Uh, kind of incredible. So I always find that amazing when there was like people that were, uh, you know, in bands. In fact, I remember a long time ago I was trying to develop this script, but of course I've just, I have too much add to try and get these fucking ideas off the ground, but had an idea for a, for a movie and then they ended up kind of doing the movie already with, uh, just one of those guys from the office.

Speaker 2:          00:37:17       But my idea was, you know, I used to watch those, um, those behind the musics and there was always somebody, oh fuck her cubs. The um, oh, that burger is taking me down. Um, there's, um, there's always that person early on, you know, they're like in AC DC and they decide to quit and go to school or they get married and then the band goes on to make it. And I always thought like, what am it happened at that fucking guy got to spend the rest of his life. I don't give a shit what he does. It can be a fucking brain surgeon. People still like,

Speaker 5:          00:37:52       dude, you quit ac DC. Oh my God, what a fucking loser.

Speaker 2:          00:37:58       Well, the rest of your life. So I had this idea for movies of booze. Basically it was about a guy that quit a band and went on to make it. And it was all about is I think I wrote it for Adam Sandler cause it was the late nineties when I was writing this thing and it just, it was a fucking mess. I was never able to land it. And it basic, what happened was he ends up meeting the devil in a bar and he sells his soul to go back in time to not quit the band. So he stays in the band, he ends up not meeting the love of his life. And then he ends up discovering that the reason why the band made it was because he quit

Speaker 1:          00:38:36       and the right person got into the band. So he lost his, the love of his life. And the band didn't make it. He fucked them all up and a, and he was going to go to hell. And, uh, interestingly enough, that's where my script went to hell because I, the way I got out of it was then he didn't give a shit. He was going to hell. He fucking went out of his way to find the fucking guy who should have been in the band. So then the band makes it and uh, because he did that selfless thing, there was a loophole and selling your soul, real Disney fucking ending. And he gets beat, doesn't have to sell his soul. He gets back with his wife and then they go to the concert in the end, oh, this is how I should have done. And he's like, you know what man, I wouldn't trade being with you, Sweden for all the fucking free pussy in the world.

Speaker 1:          00:39:20       The end. Right. And they kind of made a movie like that. Um, or enough of it. Either way, I don't give a fuck. Right. So anyways, getting back to this Terry Reid Guy, uh, was, I gonna say, um, that sounds very interesting. I'm actually, you know, I'm going to fucking put this guy in right now to look them up. Cherry re, man, it sounds like a country guy. Was that Jerry Reed? I each of dad loaded up, ain't fucking, um, wife's. You know, we said that one night when he was just sick of singing that song in front of those fucking church going racing racist fucking country music fans. Ah, God. They love talking about family. I'll tell you right now, if I wasn't white, I would not hang around with any white people that talked about the family values. The second white people start talking about that shit.

Speaker 1:          00:40:10       You just know is she, you know what's underneath that good family values, you know, founding fathers. All right, let's go. Let's go. Let's not get too political here, Bill. All right. The wife's brother found picture I posted online. My wife's brother found a picture. I posted it online. Okay. Obviously it's not gonna be good. First off, go fuck yourself. All right. Thank you. Very nice to see you too. Um, oh wait, I forgot to read what this person wrote it again. Just a binge drinking, watching afters for family right now. So far, I love it. It mirrors the anger I have inside the can't let out in a modern day society. Thanks for all the free content and as always, go fuck yourself. All right. Just another guy watching after his family.

Speaker 1:          00:40:53       Um, all right, this next guy, my wife's brother found a picture I posted online. All right. First off, go fuck yourself. Hey, stop B and me. Oh, by the way, did anybody see will Ferrell on Jimmy Fallon the tonight show this week doing that? Uh, I got to give you a link to this even though it already has 12 million fucking views. Um, will Farrell is the new Santa Claus and he's like, uh, like a Santa Brow. Um, I, I can't do it justice. I can't do, he's Kinda got a high pitch. Hey Jamie. And he's got this fucking blonde wig on with the soul. I watched that. It's like a fucking 10 minute video. I've already watched it like four times. I hate to say this. I was actually watching it while driving the other day. Just laughing. You know, it's fucking traffic out here, you know, but, uh, you gotta see it.

Speaker 1:          00:41:45       It's the fact that it's just a one off character and that he came out and crush that hard with it. The guy's an absolute genius. And by the way, he has a movie coming out called Daddy's home star and Mark Walberg, Boston's old Mark Walberg and a yours truly has it. Quick scene in there. I got a quick seat, don't blanket, you'll miss me. But that comes out on Christmas Day. So if you already saw star wars, which is hilarious, I heard it's fucking awesome and now I want to go see it. You have to meet trashing it. Um, versus he was fucking defended. It was trying to say star wars is not a nerd movie, which is like me saying the New York Yankees aren't a baseball team. Like it's, it's not only a nerd movie, it's like a nerd, nerd movie. You know what I mean? That's like saying Goodfellas is not a gangster movie. It's more about interpersonal relationships. Um, yeah, it's the total fucking nerd movie, but it's, it's fine. It's okay to be. And he's defending it, going like talking about what a great jump shot he has and how he can throw a football like an animal.

Speaker 1:          00:42:54       I love versa. He's always talking trash man is always talking trash. Um, so of course I gotta be a cunt and I wrote them back on Facebook. I'm going Paul, not for nothing, but when there's this full grown adults dressing like the characters in the movies that Gee, you got to expect you're going to get a little bit of Shit. Right. Cause he's trying to, he shouldn't be negative KT when she has good Chai. Me. Um, I think it's the fact that the first four, like three out of four were either mediocre are absolutely horrific and people would rather line up and watch that shit. And it's all truly amazing movies. Truly amazing cinema out there. All right. A wise brother found picked that I posted online. First off, got fucking on here. I'll cut to the chase. Be Nice if I did. I've started this letter like three times. I'm 22 and married Maddie g's with two children. One is biological data with that word always reminds me of shacks. Rep Cause is biological. Didn't bother. Remember that he was bobbing his head. Of course he got him a convertible cause he's like nine feet tall. Uh, I got a little, I got a little too shit faced the other night and I shared skimpy pictures of my wife's awesome ass.

Speaker 4:          00:44:06       Okay

Speaker 1:          00:44:07       on. I can't tell where you've got a little shit faced. You've got a little too shit faced. Long story short, my wife's brother was also on there and it came across these pictures. My wife was passed out drunk and I drew a monster eating a hot dog coming out of her ass before taking the do. This isn't real. I don't want this to be real.

Speaker 4:          00:44:36       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:44:37       So then you posted it on a porn site and it turned out your brother in law was on there.

Speaker 4:          00:44:43       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:44:43       Oh your girlfriend's brother was on that. What the fuck? What the fuck is going on with brother-in-law?

Speaker 4:          00:44:49       Yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:44:50       this is, that's actually a happy ending that the circle of you three ended right there and you guys just swirl around in an eddy of that fucking nonsense. Thank God that didn't go out and to humanity like, like a virus. He goes, my wife was pimp passed. How he read this again. My wife was passed out drunk and I drew a monster eating a hot dog coming out of her ass before taking the pictures. Uh, her brother is coming to town for the holidays and I'm curious what you would do in this situation. Why the fuck do you know it was his sister's ass? He was scrolling through a look@thatass.com and then all of a sudden he's just like, or do you have your own name on this porno site? What would you do it on Facebook?

Speaker 4:          00:45:37       Okay,

Speaker 1:          00:45:38       this is really weird. You know what this is? This might be one of the few law and order episodes that were never made. Don't Doh, Doh, Doh, Doh. And then he shows up. You're like, hey man, I was just a joke. And then he fucking Daddy. Did he kill you? Did the wife kill you? Who knows? Um, her brother is coming to town into town for the holidays. I'm curious what you would do in this situation. Uh, you mean? I don't know, but aside from kill myself, uh, I don't know. Her brother already doesn't care for me and I'm expecting an ass beating. If he starts hitting me, can I hit him back or just become a punching bag for the evening?

Speaker 4:          00:46:22       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:46:22       Uh, how old are you? You got keys? 22.

Speaker 4:          00:46:28       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:46:29       Wait, you sir, you've made a series of bad decisions in life and it's ended with this and I think it's, it's great that the year is ending, that you're in this situation and I would try to do something to get out of it. Eh, the first thing I'd do, I'd stopped drawing pictures on my wife's ass and putting them on the Internet. Secondly, I would take some self defense classes and, uh, put my wife's brother and his place, but he's going to be right on this one.

Speaker 4:          00:47:00       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:47:01       The only way he knows it's your wife's ass as if somehow your name is connected to that account. So I'm guessing you went on Facebook for friends and family and your fucking wife's ass with the hot dog coming out of it. That's really weird. Probably those was like fucking Shit, didn't it? You were to a fucking turd coming out of our ass. Um, yeah. For brother, if anybody starts hitting, you can always hit back. I just try to tie him up. Just get him in a bear hug and just get your mouth in his ear going, I'm sorry dude. I'm sorry. I'm Joe. I'm sorry. Just keep doing that. Maybe that'll work. I have no idea. That's a hell of a predicament. Anyways, he goes, thank you for absence from family. It's the only show that is funnier than South Park Day. Easy, easy. No, it isn't a South Park for king. I love the podcast and of course the advice. Go Fuck yourself as much as I f I fucked myself. Well, good luck with that one.

Speaker 2:          00:47:48       Um, and final.

Speaker 4:          00:47:52       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:47:52       Uh, Dear William Claus, I'm buying a couple of friends slash relatives, some vinyl this year for Christmas. Needs some help. I want to get a couple of classic rock and jazz albums. So you are near or the dude who does your podcasts.

Speaker 4:          00:48:07       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:48:11       well I think bill burr live at Andrew's house is a hell of a, that's a hell of a record to own personally speaking. I think it's phenomenal if I do say so myself. Um, uh, what, what, what, what kind of a what kind of, what kind of judge you want to listen to? I mean, you could go with the classics if you just didn't come out. You know, you have the ones that everybody gets to try it. Even though people try to pretend like they're into jazz, like me know, you know, like, uh, God, what are those miles Davis one Bertha. Cool.

Speaker 2:          00:48:44       The one with my funny Valentine on it might be that one. Yeah.

Speaker 4:          00:48:47       Well, well, well, well, right

Speaker 1:          00:49:01       John Coltrane, a love supreme. That's deaths. Fuck him up that day.

Speaker 2:          00:49:07       Sounds like a baby playing the fucking saxophone to me, if, if it actually knew what it was doing, but didn't understand how to make sentences yet. Um, I always like miles Davis in a silent way. A classic rock albums. Quantum man Zeplin too.

Speaker 2:          00:49:28       Uh, ACDC back in black. I Dunno. I Dunno what to tell you. I Dunno. I got a giant Burger sitting in me and it's slowly, you notice you don't, I feel like, I feel like this must be what it's like after you get bit by a poisonous snake. After the pain is gone and the horror is gone, the serpent has left the area and you just given into the fact like, hey man, I'm just going to ride this up. I'm going to start hallucinating and I might wake up dead and some of the place or I might just die right here right now. Um, saw [inaudible] self, I can't even talk about it. Like I saw something so fucked up the other day. I was watching those animal clips, eight animals that don't have the decency to kill another animal before they start eating it. You know, reptiles are big on that. So reptile, one time, you know, it was giant bowls at fucking routinely kill lions. Komodo dragon fucking bid in it leg. And it's got such bacteria and its teeth in his mouth that it knows it's going to get into the bowls fucking blood system and it's going

Speaker 1:          00:50:28       to collapse. But it takes like three days. So there's a lizard just keeps following this thing around and waiting for it to collapse, not die, collapsed. And then it comes up and just starts eating its guts as the fucking cows. It's just horrific. I don't know why I'm bringing that up. You know what? I brought that up. Let's see if I can make you laugh after that. Fucking immature. All right. TV show, TV show recommendations. Um, number one, a Billy Bob read. Fuck a Billy Bob read. Fuck. How's it going? And that's actually a good one and I fucked it up. I have a show you need to watch. It's called Ray Donovan, starring, uh, Liev Schreiber. It's about a Boston family that moves to La and the, why are you acting like this isn't a massive fucking, uh, a massive hit plays a fixer for celebrities and high profile people in the city.

Speaker 1:          00:51:18       It's fucking amazing. I know you'd like it. It's got Busan and bang and tits and death. The four components of his sick show. Take a watch. You won't be disappointed. Thanks for all the podcasts. Always gets me through the day. Go Fuck Yourself. I'm actually, I want to start watching that show because I'm a good friend of mine, Mike by, um, who directed black or white who's become one of my really good friends and uh, he's actually signed on to start writing on that show and uh, I was talking to him the other day. He says he wakes up early, excited to go to work. He's loving working on the show and he was telling me how sick some of the shows are that they're making right now. So I'm definitely, I'm going to try to get caught up on that one. So thank you for the recommendation. Do you have any more?

Speaker 1:          00:52:05       I'll look at that. Recommendation number two. All right. Uh, dear Billy sloops, the 2009 BBC Sherlock Holmes t v show, starring Benedict Cumberbatch is awesome. The acting is great. Great. It's shot well. There are only four seasons, four episodes per season. Very well done. It's on Netflix and there were a couple of seasons, you know, I'm going to give that a shot. Sherlock Holmes was always really dry cause he's so fucking cerebral. I liked those cops that, you know, they smack people around, you know what I mean? And then drink and shit. They solve shit the way, you know, the way people want. Smart. Do you know, they get themselves liquored up and they use violence. I like watching that shit, so I'll, I'll sit with that. You know, I always feel like Sherlock Holmes is like Europe's doctor who, but if it's only four episodes per season, hey, I think I could do that.

Speaker 1:          00:53:05       But Oh, this Burger Burger's taking me down. I don't know if I'm gonna make it. Guys, this might be my last Monday morning podcast. I want to thank all you guys for listening over the last decade. Hey, bill speeches. Slowly gonna become slurred. Vision is beginning to double o be able to go on what the others. This is how it ends. All right. Hey Bill. Not sure if you've seen the nick yet, but it's a great show. Clive Owen is great. He's a heroin slash coke addict doctor who does experimental surgeries in 1901 AH, Jesus Christ. I'm on board every time my wife and I watch it, we always say Jesus Christ. Oh, oh Jesus Christ. The way you do because of the crazy shit that goes down. Give it a watch and allow yourself to say the same thing. Thanks for the laughs. All right, I'll try that number four dear bell, have you heard of this new show?

Speaker 1:          00:53:59       F is for family. Why? No, I have not. Wink, wink. Let me read. Let me read the description. It's voiced by the redheaded, the redhead from, I love the 80 strikes back. Bruce Stern's daughter does a voice too. It's an accurate portrayal of life from the 70s filled with all types of humor. The language is a bit salty, so make sure not to watch it on Sundays. I heard they signed for four and a half more seasons, so don't expect to see the red head on VH one anytime soon. Love you man. Thanks for the laughs. Ah, wasn't that sweet? That was a nice little gift there, wasn't it? All right. Winding down here.

Speaker 2:          00:54:37       Oh yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:54:37       You know, I told myself the other day I was going to wrap the Christmas gifts and just fucking just put this whole Christmas thing to bed, you know, cause the next few nights I'm going to a bunch of Christmas parties

Speaker 2:          00:54:47       and uh, you know what I mean? Oh God. Why did I do that Burger today? And then I go, he's Christmas parties. You know, I, you know what I'm gonna do.

Speaker 1:          00:54:59       I'm gonna fucking the second I'm done with this shit. I'm, I upload this podcast, I'm shoving my giant head under some water

Speaker 2:          00:55:06       and I'm waking the fuck up and I'm going to go to the gym. I'm going to go to the gym every day. Gotcha.

Speaker 1:          00:55:13       Just become pop me life fed. If you don't what I be faith or you go to the gym every day, you can't. Um, all right, dilemma. Here is a dilemma for you, dear bill, their billion, uh, my girlfriend said no gifts for Christmas. She looked me dead in the eye and said, please no gifts

Speaker 2:          00:55:33       this year. Wow, that's great.

Speaker 1:          00:55:37       To give you the backstory, we got engaged a month ago and they're also going to London in February. She's not the type of girl to bullshit about this or test me like some psycho. She really meant it. Oh, oh this, this is a tough one. I was thinking about making her a card or something laying slash awesome like that. What can I do that doesn't count as a gift but still says I needed to give you something. Um, all your listeners are probably going to suggest giving her the Dick and there you go. I think that's a great idea. This is what should do. You go out and you buy a little thread that you can tie into a bow, your wrapper, you tied around your fucking Dick and then you on some Christmas music go, we comes Santa Claus, here comes Santa Claus right down Santa Claus Lane and he is, you just run in like high kicking with your junk. Just flapping in the wind with, with the ball around it. Right. If you do that, I bet you'll never have to buy or anything else for Christmas again cause she'll probably leave you and then you go, all your problems will be solved.

Speaker 4:          00:56:45       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:56:45       I Dunno if, do you think she really means it? You know, don't buy me anything for Christmas. Oh God. Do they ever say what they mean? It's always a game. It's always a test. They're, they're higher thinkers. They're a higher level big, they speak in metaphors wrapped up in an enigma with a rental and something else from fucking JFK strikes back with the empire, whatever it is. Um,

Speaker 4:          00:57:14       okay.

Speaker 2:          00:57:16       Which, what could you get her? Why don't you just make a breakfast? We were in a Santa Hat. Something simple like that.

Speaker 4:          00:57:26       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:57:26       You know why? You know why I don't buy this? Because it's never enough. Even if you go onto, yeah,

Speaker 2:          00:57:29       get him some shit. It's not going to be an, and there's always something we, something needs to be worked on. Something needs to happen. What are we doing here? Um, oh fuck. That was me sitting up. I just made that noise. You know, somebody sent me a fucking video of this drummer I never heard of and I'm going to fucking send you will. His name is Charles something or other. He's a jazz drummer and he is an absolute fucking monster and he's really fun to watch for any drummers who listen to this. I don't think drummers listened to this for anybody happens to be a drummer, but you fucking listen to this. Uh, let me see if I can get the fucking name here. What is the name of this motherfucker?

Speaker 4:          00:58:22       okay.

Speaker 2:          00:58:23       I actually got this, uh, I got it this morning. Somebody sent it to me. Might or might not have been. I want to drop a name here, but he may or not may not be the drummer from truths and salvage company. He sent it to me and he was like, check this fucking guy out and he's a monster. So I'm going to, I'm going to have this clip up on the podcast to get you a little drummer, shit going on. But uh, I'm going to dunk my fucking giant head underneath the fucking the water right

And by sticking with it, I mean I've done it two days in a row. He recommends at least five days a week for three months for 15 minutes. You do is based drum fucking workout. And then you two will have a faster bass drum. What did anyone want to say? Doing the workout too. So I really want to stick with it.

Speaker 2:          00:59:28       Um, and I feel like if I don't go today, I'm going to fuck the whole thing up. I got to do it. I have to do it. And that's what I'm going to go to.

And we're talking about how there's like 30,000 earths out there in space. You don't want it habitable places like this with water and all that shit, but you know, they just don't have an Epcot center. So you know it's not earth, right. And everybody always thinks, well, maybe there's a bunch of human beings run around there. And I was thinking, well, maybe there's some dinosaurs up there. Maybe the asteroid never heard it, you know, and have a hit. And maybe human beings, you know, crawled out of the fucking, out of the trees, a mud or whatever the fuck they did. And uh, the Getty, you know, but it turns source rhexis right then. Then they're up there fucking eat and all the fucking trees and shit. You ever think stuff like that? Well, you know something.
