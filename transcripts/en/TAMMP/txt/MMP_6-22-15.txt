Speaker 1:          00:00:02       Hey, what's going on? It's bill burr and it's the Monday morning podcast for Monday. He over there. It's uh, June 22nd, 2015 and I am in Santa Rosa. Santa Rosa with it makes the one you're naughty say, um, California, Santa Rosa. And um, last night I performed, I don't even know. I can't remember the name of the venue. The Wells Fargo. Oh, Ho the wells Fargo wagon is, uh, I can't even look it up on my website because my fucking website, the second I do the Gig, he's like, go fuck yourself. It's over. That information no longer exists. Wait a second, we look me up here. Let me look me up. Oh God. He's in his ego this week. Basically I would gives a fuck with the name of the thing was, um, the venue I played last night was the, uh, the venue. George Carlin did his last stand up special. And um, someone, I thought, someone told me that this was the place where he did his last show. I was the wells Fargo Center for the, Ah, um, this is the place where he did, um, his recorded his last special and his last performance was at the Orleans Casino in Las Vegas. If you're a George Carlin, not like me. Um, so last night I was,

Speaker 1:          00:01:34       I was standing backstage and I don't, man, it was really fucking cool. It was such an amazing venue. It had like the lower level. And then I had like this, this small upper deck that just wrapped around, you know, all three sites that I was looking out at it. It looked like a minor league ballpark. And the crowd was, I could tell when Bart Nick went out there, they were, uh, they were just a really smart crowd and a one of my best shows of the fucking tool. So I really want to thank everyone that came out last night and um, you know, it was a good time. I Dunno, who knows. I ended up staying on the up to like four in the morning with fucking Barnick much in full metal jacket and drinking this wine because you know, we're in wine country, so they just given us this fucking wine and we're drinking it and I have the worst goddamn hangover.

Speaker 1:          00:02:27       I fucking, I appreciate wine. But wine should only be drank with like a good meal. You know what I mean? Seminar women can drink it. I don't know how the fuck they do it. You know, around four, four 30 when they really just can't deal with their fucking kids anymore. They just, you know, they pop in a DVD, you know? Okay, go watch spongebob takes over fucking Japan, whatever the fuck they're doin. Right. Spongebob First Pokemon come on kids, you know, this was just sit out and then they just fucking did just start boozing, which I totally respect. I don't know how the fuck they do with them and it's a brutal hangover. So I'm like, all right, the bus isn't, we're not leaving until 11 in the morning, you know. So I stayed up till like four in the morning and the back of my head, it's like, well, I gotta do my podcasts.

Speaker 1:          00:03:18       It's like, Eh, no big deal I'll do on the bus and I'll just fucking uploaded. And uh, it like fucking eight 30 in the morning. The people staying in the room next to me, they had these two little kids, like real young. Those fucking kids are up at the crack of dawn. And one of them was, you know, there's a door between my hotel room and the other one and one of them with his little baby hand was just slapping the door, you know, talking Jibo's. Yeah. I can't, I can't just slap, slap, slap bitch. Kiki can't get mad at a baby. You know what I mean? I mean, I guess some people do, you know, that doesn't usually end up well. I think babies are pretty much, uh, they've yet to win in a fight with an adult. You know what I mean? They like the 1977 fucking Tampa Bay Buccaneers that just went all and 14.

Speaker 1:          00:04:10       You know, I don't know what it is with babies. They really got to turn it around when they're fighting adults, they got her somehow they've got to change the culture, you know, then that nursery in somehow try to get out there and try and find a way to win. You know? Cause I'll tell you right now, you know, if they keep doing what they're doing or you know, they're never going to beat an adult. You liked that? I wanted to, I went to Mike Golick there. Yeah, the kid cry. So um, it's unfucking real, just that kids just fucking wake up and they, they don't even have to stretch. You know what I mean? Like the four I get out of bed, I swear to God, if I just lay down and watch TV for 20 minutes, if I get out of bed, I feel like I haven't walked in nine years.

Speaker 1:          00:04:57       Like I, before I get out of bed, I literally have to take my fucking toes and point them at my knees and hold it there for like, fuck, it felt like a good 30 seconds. Then I get up, I'm fine if I don't do that. If I just get up and start walking, I do that, you know, you take that one and a half steps and you do that little fucking quick little of like somebody just kicked you in the side of the leg, you go, oh, you know, and I have to stop putting my hands down on the mattress and then stretch out my fucking whatever it is. My Achilles, just kids just get up and run, man. You know, I swear to God, if I, is it illegal, they get your baby drunk, you know, just social sleep longer and when it wakes up it's just going to lay there like, ah shit.

Speaker 1:          00:05:43       Yeah. Uh, fuck it. Let me just lay here. Let me just lay here for another 20 minutes, you know? So what I would do if I had a baby, I would just get it hammered big time, drink up. You know, I put a right, this formula, is that illegal? You know, I know you, you're not allowed to drink publicly until you're 18 but if you're with your parent or legal guardian, catch you get fucked up together. I'm seriously asking you that. You know, what if it's wine, you know, you make it sophisticated, like whatever, like,

Speaker 1:          00:06:21       like if you have like one of those Gerber ones, if it's a lighter color, do you go with the white wine for the baby and then if it's like one of those ones that has beets in it, you get them a red or is that redundant? Is that vulgar to have, uh, that two colors on top of each other? I have no idea. I have no idea. I'm not sophisticated. Like, like you fucking wine drinkers, you know, somebody has got gotta be, do I know the, obviously I know that's fucking illegal, but somebody out there's got to be doing it, you know, like Jesus Christ. It's like if you're a night owl and your kid just wakes up at six in the morning, something has to give, you know, then they used to do that when babies were teething, they pour a little booze into their milk or something like that.

Speaker 1:          00:07:06       Or did they rub it right on their gums? You know, like the kids, some fucking cop trying to determine whether it's cocaine or not. You know, they always do that in the fucking TV shows and the movies where like, they're like, what do you got there Mike? And he goes, you know, he does a little little tap, tap, tap, and a Christian. He said, yeah, this is the real deal. You know? Oh, he's crying, poor thing. Whenever you hear a baby cry, just start fucking, I'd always makes me laugh. I always just think like, you know what dude, I hear you. I want to do that too. I wish I could still cry like that the way baby does. Just over little things. I think I wouldn't be angry anymore. He says, you just get it out of you. You know, if I go to turn on my phone and I find out that I didn't recharge it the night before and it's completely dead, you know, rather than the fucking Goddamn fucking idiot bill. What if I just went, he just fucking cry it out. Oh my God. How much would your wife fucking freak out if he just started doing that?

Speaker 1:          00:08:21       I wish I could do it for real, you know, just as a joke with me and just tell her that I fucking w I'm reading this new book on crying it out and just see how long it could sustain it.

Speaker 2:          00:08:32       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:08:33       I didn't think I could cry once. She just be like, put the fuck are you doing? You know what I mean? And then I would just cry. Like you don't have a baby does when you yell at it.

Speaker 2:          00:08:45       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:08:46       I Dunno what it is. Maybe he's just fucking make me laugh no matter what they're doing. Like if me see those psychos, like when you're on a fucking plane, I think I feel like I just keep going. Like, what if this happened? Like, did you ever have this happen? Like why am I talking, I gotta do it again. Instead of saying like, why am I talking as if I'm a seventh grade girl chewing gum. You know why? Cause I went to bed at like four 30 in the morning. That's why she going to have to deal with it. Oh, Billy teeny bopper hears this week. Um, whenever I'm on a fucking plane and a baby starts crying, whenever I see people like the, those people get angry and they put on their fucking Bose noise canceling. Thanks. You know, I always feel like anybody who has the money to buy headphones that all they do is just block out the sound of other people. It's just like

Speaker 1:          00:09:43       there's only the only way you could do that as a few. Uh, he had like blood money. Who's got the money for Bose? Fucking, they're like $300 and only do is just block out people talking. It actually sounds great. If I hit a fucking pair of those on right now, then I wouldn't hear those kids crying. I don't know what it is. No idea. Anyways, so what I'm trying to say is happy father's day, everybody happy belated father's Day. You know, did you get your dad a man? Great. So he knows that you care. You know, man, fucking hilarious. They just advertise once a year. Like your dad only wants steak house quality once a fucking once a year. That's it. You know, I called up, uh, a bunch of my friends who are dads and I was just like, hey, you know, happy father's Day. What are you doing today? And they'll be that guy, you know, mom working in the yard. Oh, you know, again, uh, putting up a shelf for some, I'm like, no, what are you doing, you know, for your, your sort of birthday here is, it's father's Day in every one of them. Just, it was just one shitty thing after another. It's like, now you guys are going out to like a teddy bar. None. He had gone to a ball game just out in the fucking yard.

Speaker 1:          00:11:08       I don't know what the, I don't get that. You know, Mother's Day don't you take her out for a little eggs benedict. You get us of flowers. I feel bad for the dads out there. What could you do? You know, even if there's a steak, I mean, God, God knows you got to go out and go make it right. Unless you Paul Versey puffers. He doesn't fuck with his grill. Sound real. I went over his house one time, you know, we were having burgers and he didn't even make them. They can't have that man. You can't have somebody else, man. And you're fucking grill.

Speaker 2:          00:11:46       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:11:47       I mean, what happens next? You know, you let a man come over your house and he cooks on your grill and you're not cooking on it. I mean, within five minutes he's going to be slow dancing with your wife. He can't, I don't even, I don't even care if you suck at it. I mean, it's not that hard. Get good at it. Right. Just make a couple of Burgers, some hotdogs. Jesus Christ version. Um, you know, it's funny as later on today we'll be like, ah, dude. Did you see it in cocoa? My, I don't I fucking cock domain. No, you didn't. You didn't. Um, anyway, so this is the Monday morning podcast is, we're working our way through June, um, me and Barton and Bart. Nick is absolutely fucking destroying in front of me. Man. It's great. It's making me have better sets because a student is bringing the heat, he's bringing the fire.

Speaker 1:          00:12:45       Um, he's just one of my favorite comics. I'm going to leave it. That fucking guy, just, he's, it's, his act is just so blunt. And even when he talks, he just gets right to it. And, uh, I can't even say half to shit. He says, cause it's so fucking politically correct. But he talked to me about, I forget what he's worked in some places, some biker came in with all his biker buddies and in one of them peeled off from wanting to go into this room and Joe was like, yeah, you can't go in here. And the guy was like, oh, I can't go in there. And Joe just, Joe has a way of like, uh, you know, just having a look on his face where all the emotion goes away and it makes you fucking blood run cold. So he's telling the story and he goes to the bike and goes, oh, I can't go in there. And then Joe just makes that face and goes, no, you can't go in there. And he said, him and the biker guy was staring at each other and then the biker dude back down. And he was just like, all I was thinking was, uh, you know, hey dude, I can go back to Pittsburgh and make pizzas while you pussy biker friends of putting you in the ground.

Speaker 1:          00:14:02       I left out a couple of words of, Oh my God, he said that shit and I think I came in with a fuck we wore. It was me and somebody else just, we'll fucking crying, laughing and Joe sitting there still deadpan like what? Like he went into that mindset. I don't think I've ever thought I had thought. I don't, I don't remember a time anybody threatened my life, but if they had that look on their face that Joe had, there's no fucking way I wouldn't. I went back down to, I'd be, I go, okay. He later walked in with my biker jacket over my forearm. Like a gentleman, you know, Jesus Christ. People got tattoos in northern California. My God, I saw this woman, she was so tatted up. It went all the way up her neck and then like, you know when they go beyond the neck but not quite there face, what do, what does that party if you face between your neck and your chin? It's like the Tanti your face, you know? Is that all, I mean I get Chin is that thing right in the front, right? Jesus Christ bill taken an anatomy class. Oh fuck you. What is it? What is the underneath? Is that still part of the neck or is that part of the chin?

Speaker 1:          00:15:17       What would you say that you put the gun right under his fucking chin. Yeah, I guess that's be Your Chin, right? I don't fucking know. Anyways, she was tatted right up to where if he had a cleft chin, it stopped there. And right along her face too. You know, like when somebody has a really neatly trimmed beard, it literally looked like she was slowly drowning and tattoos. Like if you stared at her long enough it was going to move up another inch and she was going to start panicking, worrying if she was still going to be able to breathe. Um,

Speaker 1:          00:15:51       do you know, don't really is normal now is actually to have a tattoo on your face. It's not as shocking. The only time we used to see it was back in the day when you watch national geographic and there's some tribe down in South America, they just draw all over each other's face, you know, worse than like prison tattoos. It looks like Morse Code, you know, or like a what are those things you had before there was the internet. He had crossword puzzles and mazes get through the maze and you drew like a pencil on it so they'd just like the drum maze on their fucking face. Um, I just saw a lot like chicks with just fucking giant pieces. I believe them. They call them all up and down their, their, their arms. It's like everybody out here plays in good Charlotte or something. I don't, I don't understand it. They're great people. Good looking people too. Good looking broads up here in northern California. I got to get you this a, I know I'm all over the place. I don't give a fuck. I got to get you this, this picture of this guy, um, who had a tattoo of his baby's face put on the side of his face.

Speaker 3:          00:17:02       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:17:06       And like part of it like went in, covered up part of his ear, like where the, and then it was also really dark. I didn't get it. I mean it was a white baby. It's like why is this thing so dark? It was like, it looked like a baby. That was like, if it was me as a baby, but for some, I dunno, kids stuck his head in the fireplace. It's like just the worst. So where's fucking tattoo I've ever seen in my life and this guys go and check it out, man. Check out my new ink. Mainly we look at this man puts tattoo sewn on Facebook. I love,

Speaker 1:          00:17:42       I love Facebook man. That's when you know you're old. When you like Facebook and all the kids look, Ooh, fucking Facebook. So lame. Good. Get out of here. You fucking punk and want you around here. Anyways, the dumb stories thinking you're lived life. You haven't. All right, you fucking dope. I'm actually that old now. When I look at people in their 20s like college age kids and I just think I have what a bunch of fucking dopes when they drink the way they behave. I used to think I was a maniac dude. I'm fucking crazy. It's like, no I wasn't. I was some nerd who couldn't handle the, the freedom of not being around his parents anymore as experiencing that for the first time. Oh, I'm going to get drunk and jump off something so that chick over there thinks I'm funny or crazy and then maybe she'll blow me like really bill, that was she game plan. All right man. Puts Tattoo a baby's face on his face. Probably be like 20 different pictures of some dummy doing this. There it is. There it is. Yeah. And he's holding his baby. He's got a white baby, Eh, this, this baby looks like, I dunno. It's weird. It looks like the baby is a yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:18:50       Coming out of [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          00:18:51       fireplace, you know, face maybe a little on fire. What a fucking, why would you do that?

Speaker 1:          00:19:04       Wait, where could that guy get? He couldn't even get a job in a fucking nursery like glove. Look how much I love babies, but none, none. Not in a structural way. Jesus, I just yelled at and they have babies next door. Oh, they can't hear me? Of course they can hear you bill. Their kids aren't yelling that loud. You can hear them right now. Jesus. Well, this would be my evidence. Bright if they came in. Why are you talking about? Uh, I can't remember what the fuck I just said. Oh, not in a sexual way while you're talking about babies in a sexual way. I be like, no. I actually did a podcast officer here at listened to him and then he takes my device and just a racist at some crooked cop. All right. I didn't know what the fuck I'm talking about here.

Speaker 1:          00:19:48       Um, I wrote about 19 minutes and I think it's time to listen to bill. Read out loud. What do you guys think? Huh? What are you all right. Hey, my batteries died so I had to go to the front desk and go get some more batteries. That every level high. That's what the record says because he has the English lady in there because it makes your device more classy. So this, uh, lady Butler that's in my recorder kept going back every level medium. So I'm thinking it's going to, you know. All right, well I don't have to worry about anything until fucking Queen Elizabeth goes bat every level low. And then I was going to buy batteries, but this shit went from battery level high to battery level, medium to just shutting off. You know what I mean? It's like when somebody, you know, just gets divorced out of fucking nowhere.

Speaker 1:          00:20:40       And like, I thought they were getting along, Craig. Not a nowhere. We just, we decided to go our separate ways. Did you? Well, that's good. Good for you.

Speaker 1:          00:27:52       I, by the way, that fucking horrible tragedy, that Douche shooting up the, uh, the church. Can Somebody please explain to me? I don't understand this as a white person. Why are white people trying to act like that wasn't a racist act.

Speaker 2:          00:28:09       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:28:09       I mean, did he have to have, I'm a racist, tattooed across his fucking forehead.

Speaker 1:          00:28:14       What else? Why? Why? I just, I hate when people fucking, they look at their race like it's a team. You know what I mean? It's like me when I defend Tom Brady and you guys all go out. If it was on the other fucking way, they know Andrew luck did it. You'll be shitting on him. Right? I'd like to think I wouldn't be, but people do that with like race. So because like they say in this racist White Dude is racist and somehow they say in your racist and not saying you're racist, you fucking moron. He's a racist. And why people stop fucking acting like you don't know racist white people.

Speaker 2:          00:28:50       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:28:50       You know that guy at the cookout who out of gets a couple of beers in him and starts dropping the n word and then you've got to be, hey, hey, take it easy clock. Come on. I try to have a good time here. Right, that fucking guy. And then hopefully you don't ever invite him again. Why are you acting like those fucking people don't exist? You know that that guy's a racist at your fucking cookout. And all he did was dropped again, word while he was eating a cheeseburger. This fucking guy went into that church specifically to kill black people cause he hated black people. I mean, what, what the fuck mortar you need? There was like nine shows.

Speaker 1:          00:29:21       If I had any hair left that would have tore it out. Watching them going, what the fuck are you trying to defend? Sorry. None of that was funny, but it was fucking true. Um, anyways, getting back to the podcast here, I saw this article on, uh, uh, Jesus. Then I get rid of it. Where is it? There it is. This fucking guy who it, who was evidently the 970th member of guns and roses. And I know, even though I'm making fun of that fucking band, you know, I don't even make in front of the band like the musicians think. It's just the fact that they're still calling it guns and roses. Right. That would be like if you bought Mcdonald's and you fired, you fired that fucking clown and you're still going. Yeah. And you fired the grimace and the hamburglar and you got rid mayor mccheese none of them were there anymore.

Speaker 1:          00:30:07       But like, uh, I dunno the fucking one of them. One of the grimace stuck around. No you don't. Ronald McDonald did. Cause Axel is a fucking red hat. Um, and you, you still acting like it's this band of brothers, whatever. So anyways, is this article by um, the 9000th guitarist and guitarist, the guy's Dj ash ba and it says DJ, but guns and roses guitarist, Dj ash ba claims his aunt and uncle invented technology for aerosol cans. All right. Uh, guns and roses and 6:00 AM Nikki Sixx, his band guitarist. Dj Asheville was interviewed by Sweetwater editorial director, Mitch Gallagher. Duh Duh Duh Duh, Duh. Here's what he said. Ashleigh says, who owns a company centered around media and advertising that runs various other countries, was asked, what takes him in those directions? He responds now basically they wrote exactly what he said, so I'm gonna maybe fuck up the emotion of this thing.

Speaker 1:          00:31:10       But basically he said, you know, I don't know. I've always had that creative bone. My aunt and uncle invented the technology for aerosol cans. So ever since I was young. Dot. Dot. Dot. They came out with a product when I was really young called Pam. That's like a buttery spray. And I've always kind of grew up in that environment. I thought outside the box, and it really taught me that it's better to create your own job then to work nine to five. So that's what's always been my mindset. I just love creating. Ashleigh also talked about his belief that musicians should diversify and have a backup plan. He said, I absolutely will always stand by that if you put all your eggs in one baskets, all you got to do is drop them and they're going to break and every one of them will break.

Speaker 1:          00:31:54       But the whole thing. Dot, dot. Dot. And I've learned this from 6:00 AM band mate, Nikki Sixx. It's like you set up buckets is set up buckets, little incomes coming in there, there, there, there, there. And as a whole, that's how you interact with this one. Jesus Christ. This is getting difficult. If three buckets aren't doing well this month, but the other ones are you going to be fine. So it's diversifying. But if you put all your eggs in one bucket and you have five months of, you know, things aren't going that well that could spill all your eggs right now. What the fucking guy said in there, I'm telling you, is the key to freedom and making your money work for yourself. So I'm looking at the comments and everybody's just shitting on him. Next thing you know, he'll be telling us he invented whippets so many roads.

Speaker 1:          00:32:41       So the fuck what I guess said some new cool way of saying what the fuck. And somebody wrote any invented huffing aerosol cans. Uh, I would like to salute auntie and uncle ash, but for making it possible for me to get high on the cheap during my turbulent and troublesome teen years, uh, by a real shirt. So his aunt and uncle are responsible for the deaths of countless insects for screwing up the ozone layer. And even worse for all the horrible hairstyles of the eighties. Congrats. Someone writes, this guy is the ultimate poser. It's it. Everybody just shits all over them. Now, I don't think he'd really fucking meant era. So I think he just invented Pam. I don't know what, but in the middle of all that, he said some brilliant shit about, hey, this guy's made it as a guitarist. Right? But then he started these business on the side with the money that he's made.

Speaker 1:          00:33:40       So if the next album doesn't do well, his business is doing well. And this is thing. And, and you know, I've found being a comedian, people always say that, hey, you know, if you have a fucking backup plan, you're not going to go 100% as a comedian. And I kind of bought into that Af, you know, early on. But the reality is is you can make all this money as a comedian, as a guitarist is whatever you're doing. But then you can take that money and start other shit. You know, I got this stupid ass podcast, I got some money coming in from the fucking advertising, I do my standup, I got money coming in from that and now I'm, I'm looking at, okay, maybe I'll, I'll take this money and go buy an apartment building and become a fucking slum Lord. And then when I'm in like 70 if I own enough of those fucking things, I don't have to go on the road.

Speaker 1:          00:34:29       Or if people are just like, oh, he's fed old freckled fuck, he's been talking about the same shit for 50 years, fuck him. And I go back down to plain in front of 30 people. I can still do it because I love it, but I won't become destitute. And this guy is like giving you this information for fucking free and everybody just shits all over. I don't know. I found it really a really inspiring and I'm a combination of that. And I also, um, I was reading this thing, I'm going to fuck up the guy's name. I think his name is Nick Offerman. That guy from that show. Um, you know where every parks and recs, the guy looks like an older, uh, Zach Galifianakis. You know, and he's funny. He's fucking hell. He does a lot of voiceover cartoon shit. Why don't you just look it up built?

Speaker 1:          00:35:19       Cause you know what? I got my fucking hands full right now. I'm holding the recorder and I got my phone, but he had this great article and I'm going to read this to you guys here. It said, what, what is the best advice you ever received? And he said, I had this amazing teacher in college, my Sensei in the Kabuki theater. And I thought that that was one of the women, you know, fucking put on the makeup. Right? And they gave you a hand job in the end. I have no fucking idea. Anyways, um, name shows. Oh Satco it probably fucked up his name for me. He was between Misdemeanor Oggie and Obi wan Kenobi. He told me to always maintain the attitude of a student. No matter how old you are, wake up in the morning and think, okay, how am I going to better myself?

Speaker 1:          00:36:01       Am I going to improve my French? Am I going to get my wife a good back rub? Then you can go to bed having tried something. It's led to a life that is more fruitful than if you have the mindset of being a master. Once you think you're the master, then you grow bitter waiting for someone to throw you a parade because she's so fucking smart. He didn't say fucking smart, but those two things right there, right there. You know what I mean? I hope you got something out of that. I have no fucking idea. But um, that's the way he should go. But if you play guitar, whatever the fuck you do, you think that, yeah, dude, I'm the shit. Then you stop growing and then these young bucks run you down. I'm basically saying people that even though I can tell a shit joke at the level that I can, I never stopped trying to find a better way to tell that shit joke.

Speaker 1:          00:36:50       What if I squatted down and really tried to take a shit on stage? I mean, those are the kinds of things I'm making fun of it, but I really got inspired by both of those things. So they got not, I can't always be sitting here on the podcast screaming. [inaudible] Kenny. All right, let's add, let's do some adding here. I did 19 minutes and 17, 19 and 17. His fucking 38 minutes. I already got another 22. Here we go. Um, all right. What the fuck was I did I want to talk about here? Oh, so we went to Reno, the biggest little town in America, and uh, that was one of the rowdiest fucking crowds I performed in front of, in a long time. And it kind of surprised me because the last time I came to reno, they weren't like that. But what happened was, is we pulled in to Reno, which I fucking love that city, right?

Speaker 1:          00:37:40       We pulled in and we just, I'll see all these people in the street. They had closed off the street. We had to try to figure out how to get the bus around. And uh, they had this festival out there. It was Bruce Blues and BBQ. They should've said BBQs, you know, like you're getting more than one barbecue just so it rhymes. Bruce Blues and Bbq spot. It was bloop bruise, blues and Bbq. And I swear to God, this shit show that was walking around out in the sun, the tattooed fucking shit show of people walking around hammered, you know, parents who let their fucking inlaws watched the kids and they're down. They're sunburned. Busan eaten barbecue. Me and bargaining comedian would just like, oh, this barbecue. We got to fucking go. And we go down there and people were fucking shit faced. Well on their way to getting shit faced.

Speaker 1:          00:38:31       I saw some lady in the sun, right sitting at this table with their head down, like, you know, you know when he came in from outdoor recess and everybody was all amped up from the sugar and salt, you'd put in your bodies during lunch and you came in and the teacher would be like, all right, everybody put your heads down on the desk. Let's just take a little nap here. Let's fucking relax so you're not bouncing off the walls is I try to teach you some phonics here. That's what she looked like. And she was, I mean, there was like two in the afternoon, so me and Barnick or going like, all right, let's get some barbecue. Took us forever to find out where it was. And then when we found it, if had this ridiculously long line in Barton, Mexican may gone do it.

Speaker 1:          00:39:09       I don't want to fucking stand in that line. And I was like, yeah, fuck that. Let's not stand. But then it seemed to be moving. So we were like, fuck it. So we stood in the line and, uh, the barbecue was unbelievable. One of the best briskets I ever had. And I was sitting there going, all right, I've been eating right. I've been doing catio every day. Um, let's just pick one meat. All right. Either get the ribs to pull pork or the fucking brisket. And uh, you know, I was starving. You know how that goes. You Get up there and your brain is telling you, you know, just get the pulled pork, but just get the ribs, you know, but the demon, the sugar salt demon that's running through your veins goes get all three. And who do you give into you given to the addiction?

Speaker 1:          00:39:55       So I go, all right, let me get, let me get all three and some coleslaw and one of those little fucking Jalapeno cornbread. Thanks. So, um, we fucking, you know, I'm in front of Barnick, I get all my shit and I get a lemonade and I see this table with his two people already sit in there, but there's an umbrella in some shade. And you know, I'm a redhead, so I'm one degree away from a fucking albino. So I beelined towards that and I sit down. I said, Hey, do you guys mind if we sit here and this guy's like, you know the cost you fucking eight bucks. That's crazy. Fucking laugh. And he's missing number eight. Okay, you got two teeth down front. Eight nine going from right to left. Um, he was missing number eight. No, I'm sorry, number nine. He was facing me.

Speaker 1:          00:40:43       Sorry. That's my dental office days. And I didn't give a fuck. I was just, I rolled with dead jokes, you know, I was like, Oh man, I'll give it to you in a check. He goes, Nah, I'm kidding. I'm kidding. It's only six bucks. [inaudible] fucking crazy laugh missing a tooth. And at that point Barton and sits down and he's got that, I'm going to murder a biker. Look on his face. And he just looks at me and he goes and they're like trying to joke with him and he completely ignores him and he looks at me and he goes, there's a tent over there. And I go, Oh yeah. And cause now it's all awkward cause he's not interacting with these people who are hammered telling the worst jokes ever. And I'm pretending like they're funny. And Joe goes, is a tent right over there?

Speaker 1:          00:41:24       And I just go, oh, you want to go sit over there instead? And he goes, yeah. And he stands up and I like a little kid, just go, okay guys, see Ya. And walked over there. I started laughing, I go, Jesus Christ. And he goes, and he just goes by, Nick does this thing where he just sort of puts his hand up, one of his hands up. He goes, dude, I want to enjoy my meal. Okay, I don't want to sit there, talk to her that, what did he call them? Methy or something like that with this missing tooth. I just want to sit here and enjoy it. And then we sat down at this other fucking table and it was actually great. We actually, where we sat there was like a breeze and all this thing. Um, and the fucking barbecue is delicious. And, um, I looked across the parking lot and there was this little coffee shop, little tiny coffee shop, looked like there was enough room in there for someone to stand and have a coffee maker, little coffee shop and you know, it was called, it was called Pony Express.

Speaker 1:          00:42:21       So, and my wife loves word place. So immediately I took a picture of it and I called her up, you know, and I been on the road for a little while so she gets a little grumpy when I'm gone that long. Um, which is funny cause when I get home then she gets grumpy when I'm home for five days. I'm a really annoying person. So what I'm trying to tell you, so I called her up and I told her that joke and she fucking lost it. I don't know why she loves wordplay, but it's my, one of my favorite things to do is when I see some dumb word wordplay business sign, I call her up. And every once in a while something gets her. And she likes horses. If she thinks ponies acute. And she just thought it was the cutest name ever. And she fucking laughs for like five minutes making me laugh as I'm sitting at devouring the barbecue.

Speaker 1:          00:43:09       It might've been the best moment of the tour. So anyways, you'd think having done stand up for 23 fucking years, I would have done the math and realized that this sunburn tattooed, missing tooth shit show that was already drinking four hours before my show was going to start. Some of them, some of those animals, we're going to fucking come into the show. It never dawned on me and I went out on stage. It was one of those things as a comic, you come walking out on stage and you just feel the vibe like, all right, why do I feel like I'm in a saloon in the 18 hundreds and I think I said one thing and somebody yelled from the to the left. I don't know if that stage left to stage right. I never know how to fuck that works. And just right out of the gate it's like Jesus Christ.

Speaker 1:          00:43:58       I didn't even get a fucking word out. So I wrote something about how they had this person had horrible parents and that's why this person was behaving this way. And um, and then that was basically the end of the show. I had engaged with them. So now it, it just became a totally interactive experience. It was actually a really fun show. Um, I do a couple of jokes and then I just have to have a conversation with a drunk. There was actually a guy in the crowd who got kicked out and he wasn't with anybody else. He was by himself like he was, he was basically the best drinker of all of his friends is what I figured out because somebody jets, I'm in the middle of my joke and somebody just yell, security, security. And they immediately made a beeline over and I seen them grabbing this guy to, you know, escorting them out.

Speaker 1:          00:44:45       And usually at that point, this either at least one other person with them screaming that it was bullshit and there wasn't, he walked out by himself and there was just one empty chair and a, I think that's when I finally put it together and I was like, ah, okay, now I get it. You guys are the guys that I saw drinking six hours ago out on the street. And everybody laughed. It was one of those crowds that would laugh at the jokes, but they would really laugh when I would snap and tell them how fucking drunk and how much they're not paying attention, then they would really laugh. Um, but hopefully it was still a good show. There was a few people that I was like, oh, we should, could have so in front of a sober crowd. So I kind of felt bad about some of that shit.

Speaker 1:          00:45:26       But, um, I dunno, it reminded me of my days when I was working my way up as a comedian and I'm just watching somebody go on in front of you having to deal with the crowd, but they weren't like Barton and click a seasoned vet so they are able to handle it like they were a new comic like I was. And you would watch them going up just person after person just bombing and you'd be just thinking like, oh my God. Oh my God. Can you just try to come up with a game plan? What am I going to do? What joke am I going to open with? What am I going to say to that guy? That guy says anything to me. Like back then I used to, I used to have to plan out shit that I was going to say rather than just go with the frustration of the moment in the moment.

Speaker 1:          00:46:11       And um, when you'd go up there, if you bomb too, he just go home. So fucking defeated in angry. But if you actually won, if he actually turned the room around, it was just the greatest fucking feeling. Like you felt like, uh, I dunno, you felt like you when you were on point of some platooned and somehow you didn't get fucking whacked. I Dunno. I Dunno what I'm talking about here. So anyways, um, this is like big time wine country out here and um, we played bouncing back here. I'll add bill here. We played that theater last night and it was just some of the greatest fucking people backstage I've been with. Like our bus driver ran into somebody else that he knew back when he used to, I guess I didn't know our bus driver used to drive the Allman brothers and um, I should have known he did because he was fucking cool as shit.

Speaker 1:          00:47:04       And if you get a cool bus driver, those guys work all the time. We get some fucking Weirdo. You know what I mean? They used to drive like, you know, I dunno, Milli Vanilli or some shit, right? So, um, him and the other guy just sitting there and we're hanging out and they had this unbelievably gorgeous long dining room table and it was one of those modern rustic is what they call it was built from wood, from an old ship and then, and then the legs are, were made out of metal and the tables just indestructable. What I loved about it is when you have a table like that, you can spill shit on it. You could literally use it as a cutting boy if you wanted to. And um, you know, I should give you guys the name of that fucking place. Um, I guess they're expensive is fucking hell.

Speaker 1:          00:47:55       But, uh, I've been looking for a dining room table because we have this awful just round one. We got it from our neighbors and then we paid this guy to refinish it. And uh, my wife, cause she's so fucking creative, had these, this design carved into it, that was the same design of this panel thing that was at our wedding. She had not Jesus Christ. I just realized there's no way she's getting rid of that table. So. Well, I guess I'm not buying a table from these fucking people, but, uh, if you guys would like a really great fucking table coke is Decaux is it c o, k a. S d. I k. O I believe in there in Santa Rosa, California. And um, they make tables all different sizes. This was like, what I loved about this table was it was big enough that entire, an entire band could come in and it was a lot of music acts that played at this venue could just come in and everybody could sit down granted if they still got along.

Speaker 1:          00:48:50       Um, and these people, like they had this unbelievable spread and they had glasses of wine and cheese and all that. Just giving you the whole experience because most of the times, you know, you're traveling, you don't get to have the experience. Like I wanted to go to bizarre guitar and gun shop and I just didn't have the time to get over there. Um, after I went over to get the barbecue, um, you know, when need a bunch of barbecue, he body just, just like, all right, shutting down now dealing with what you just put, like you just put so much fucked up shit into your body. There's not enough energy left to keep you awake. So your body's just like, all right, powering down. You know, it's like when you put your laptop on sleep mode, like that's what your body does to you. Like, yeah, that's why, you know, black people call it the itis.

Speaker 1:          00:49:34       I know what white people call it, you know, whatever the fuck it is. It's like a, I learned that from Charlie Murphy. I told this story before, I got to tell it again. Charlie Murphy and Darnell Rawlings, we were on a tour called, uh, the rich bitch tour. And that was from when Darnell Darnell was the guy that did that. I'm rich bitch that would scream at the end of the Chappelle show. [inaudible]. So, um, you know, they used to always just sit there and breaking balls, breaking balls, breaking balls, you know, making fun of my clothes and all that type of shit. And uh, it was the worst in the morning, you know what I mean? Cause I've, I've been wake up, you know, hung over or whatever and these guys will like a couple of kids, they just woke up like we, we like they weren't drinking with me the night before.

Speaker 1:          00:50:14       Um, I don't say take a multivitamin is a what? Right. Um, so one day I was just fucking, I didn't want to deal with it and we had this long drive from Chicago all the way up. Like Mount Vernon, I don't even fuck around Mount Vernon's New York. I can't remember some way of like a, it's like a two hour drive. And I knew that they were going to be loud and breaking my balls and I went extra hard and I didn't want to deal with it. And I was standing out there, we had this fucking car service, right? This old ass limo. I remember that. Are there any new limos by the way? They're always fucking old as shit. Um, this old ass fucking literally looked like the thing was from like the 80s, this old town car, right. And I'm standing there going, oh my God, I don't want to deal with these guys.

Speaker 1:          00:50:59       They're going to be loud as shit. And I looked down the street and I saw a Popeye's and I was just like, fuck this. Cause they had taught me about the itis because Donna was eating so bad. Darnell was literally buying hot dogs at the gas stations in Edam and within fucking five minutes he would be asleep. Like his body would just power down dealing with the poison he just put in. So I went down the street, went in there and got this giant bucket of Popeye's chicken with fucking mash potatoes and biscuits and they came walking up and I was like, hey guys, that got us some food. They don't like, oh all right man, thanks. Thanks. And they start eating it and I'm just sitting there nursing like one drum stick and they ate that shit in like within fucking 20 minutes. They will both passed out and I just sat with a fucking shitty and grid.

Speaker 1:          00:51:50       It just wrote in total silence up to the fucking whatever the fuck we were going. So they ago, if you're ever in a car and you've got a loud friend or something like that, a legal way to drug them is you just get some really bad fast food because it's poison. It's just all trans fats. Well, I, I am my own selfish way. I poisoned two really good friends of mine. I temporarily poisoned them so I could just sit there, you know, and enjoy myself as I wrote up, you know what I mean? And is it slightly racist? Then I went and, and got a bucket of chicken for two African Americans in defense of me. It's the first one that I saw. It was the first thing that I saw.

Speaker 1:          00:52:35       I don't fucking know. Anyways, moving on. What are we up to here? 32 32 in 1951 minutes. Oh, we're closing in on it there. Um, oh Jesus Christ. I haven't, oh Jesus Christ. I haven't even done the fucking let us for this week. I'm out. I'm out of it. I'm out of it here. Where the hell did it go? Is this them?

Do you know I watched the end of the u s open and watch that poor bastard potting for Eagle. He's with Wayne Gretzky's daughter.

Speaker 1:          00:54:24       Wayne Gretzky is in the crowd, a man who has his name on the cup four times a man who is a champion. And you saw Gretzky, had a big smile on his face like, yeah buddy, here we go, you sync this fucker, you go top shelf with this thing. And it was a long plot and the guy didn't see, didn't sync it. So it's like, all right, whatever. And then he had a three foot plot and I had to leave. I had to run out to go do my show and I shut off the TV, assuming he was going to sink the three foot plot and then there was going to be a playoff that I could watch, you know, before my show, I guess it would have been today, they would have played like a whole nother round of golf for some shit, I guess is how it works.

Speaker 1:          00:55:04       So I shut the TV off. Thank God I did. And as I'm going out I was, I was going out to, to the, to the bus. My phone starts blowing up and people, some Versie wrote, Oh my God, that just made me sick. And I thought at first they were talking about, they were talking about the, uh, you know him missing the, the, the Eagle Pot. Right. Um, I got this message from a buddy of mine. He wrote, holy fucking Shit. That's just awful. What does Gretzky say there? And I wrote back, did he miss the Birdie Putt too? And he just wrote Yas like 20 fucking asses. He just lost. And I wrote, Oh, now he said, miss the three footer coming back up. Unreal all time putting choke. It's shocking. Did you see? And I wrote, I'm so glad I missed the second miss. I ran out to the car to go over to the show. I assume you'd hit it and I'd watched a play off and then I wrote, golf is fucking devastating and he will play off at us. Open is 18 holes on Monday for you people who are really into golf. Um, golf has absolutely fucking emotionally fucking devastating. I still don't think it's a sport. It's the most devastating fucking activity.

Speaker 1:          00:56:31       Like the first masters I ever sat down and watch wire to wire. I watch Kenny Perry fall apart.

Speaker 3:          00:56:37       Yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:56:37       on 17 and 18 and then go to the playoffs and fucking loose to the coolest Argentinian dude. I just, I just, I can't get over

Speaker 1:          00:56:49       how fucking devastating I eat. What kills me is this is to think it's just a complete mind. Fuck. It's the biggest mind fuck out there. I believe in that kid though, even though he missed those two things. I believe that kids a stud, he's going to come back and uh, I feel bad that everyone's going to say he's a big fucking choker and all that, like they've ever dealt with any sort of pressure like that. So whatever his fucking name is, I'm not into golf. Um, I got MP three, four year, I believe in you. You're going to be back and uh, it's only gonna make you stronger. And they're just the fact that he could actually just not break down into tears right there on national television. He probably did later on that night. And there's nothing wrong with that. I would have just, when I missed it, I would've just let, not even like through my club doubt, I would've just let go of it. You know? That's even worse. That's when you're devastated. When you can't even make your muscles work anymore. You're like, you're so sad. You can't even, you can't even hold anything. You just let go. Whoa.

Speaker 1:          00:57:53       It'd be fucking hilarious. And you don't even finish your pot. You just fucking kick it with your foot. I don't give a fuck. He is. You have to be carried off. Like you remember when James Brown would do that thing and they'd bring the fucking coat over two of them. Like they have to do that except it's a little golf Poncho and the golf umbrella and they're just bringing you in as somebody patting you on the chest. Come on bill. Come on. I would have done that. So just the fact that he could, he had to walk out in front of all of those people with their heads high and you know, they were all looking at him.

Speaker 3:          00:58:25       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:58:25       In some way. A lot of them will love in it because they never made it to a u s open. So, uh, I don't know, just the fact that he was fucking in there first, he actually wrote that was so devastating. The guy who won didn't even enjoy it. Oh my God. It was, it's one of the most brutal fucking things,

Speaker 1:          00:58:47       you know, it was right up there with watching the Seahawks throw the ball and have it get intercepted. But at least then like the devastation of that, it's spread across 40 men. You know what I mean? Who can be all devastated together as opposed to golf? It's just you by yourself. There's no defense trying to pick the ball off or guess what you're doing, jumping around. It's just you in three feet of grass. Another my, one of my buddies was shitting on the fucking what the golf course look like. He goes, dude, that golf course looks like my backyard.

Speaker 1:          00:59:23       I hated it at first, but after a while I kind of liked it. I thought it was kind of a bad ass course man. It looked like a, they stopped in the middle of a war and decided to play 18 holes cause they had like the gallery. Then we're in like these look like these ruins these buildings or some shit that had been torn up. Anyway, so let's get to the questions here for the week. A bill where all the John Wayne, this is from a lady. Uh, hello bill. I'm a big fan. I hope this gets to you. Me and my husband take the drive from Austin to Houston visiting his dad in the hospital quite often. Uh Oh man. That's sad. I hope it gets better or I don't know. I hope there's something in then its benefit. I just made me sad. Anyways, the drive can can feel long, but we cut in.

Speaker 1:          01:00:07       Cut It in half with your podcast. Oh, there we go. We get good laughs and we don't have to talk to each other. I'm writing to get your opinion. I may be wrong, but I'm open to hear what you think. I wanted to have a pedicure on my birthday. I dragged my husband with me. It's, it is the best place to get a foot and calf massage. He's never had a pedicure, so I wanted for him to experience it with me. He was not a fan. He didn't feel like his feet were being touched by another, what? He didn't like. His feet being touched by another man.

Speaker 3:          01:00:38       Ah, ah. Oh God.

Speaker 1:          01:00:42       Another man giving you a calf massage. Oh, Jesus Christ. When is this month today and my God, the uncomfortableness of this month. Jesus Christ. Yeah. He thinks women try to emasculate men by having them get wax, spray Tan and have pedicures. He's always referenced in men in Hollywood by saying, where are all the John Waynes? I wasn't trying to emasculate him, but to give them a new experience and hope that he would enjoy a little relaxation. He wasn't into it. Tell me if you get pedicures and if you would enjoy them, you're great. Go Fuck Yourself. Uh, no, I don't get pedicures. This is the thing. Men are not allowed to enjoy any sensual experience unless it's with the female. Like women can just sit there and let another woman touched their feet and massage there cast and be like, oh my God, that feels so good. Thank you Stacy. You know, we're not allowed to this. The thing about it is his guys were like, what I pictured guys remember, remember those old square TVs that you had? That's like what a guy is physically with just like these blocks, you know, and we'll just like, what? Not like that I'm getting grossed out. This is just gross and maybe I'm fucking immature. But now you know something

Speaker 3:          01:02:14       I think,

Speaker 1:          01:02:16       I dunno, maybe I'm wrong. Uh, the song we need, cause she'll fucking soft. And what I'm going to say here. What the fuck are you doing to your man here? Why don't you want that guy? You see fucking read the second. Anybody in intruder comes in. You killing that off of him.

Speaker 1:          01:02:32       The EAG. He's just going to grab some fucking lamp and start smashing it over. Somebody who's fucking head. If they come to your house, if he keeps getting a calf massage and getting his toes fucking painting. What do you, what are you doing to you? You're rehabbing a pit bull here for no fucking reason. He's fine the way it is. Oh my God. No. You know something. I think I did one time. I did get a pedicure. I get when I was on the fucking rich bitch tour. He knows something. Black Dudes, we'll get manicures. They'll get manicures. I think it was a manicure. Did I have, you know, I, I know I got a pedicure one time. I think I was with Nia. I think I blocked it up. Yeah, I think we were in New York. I got a pedicure and then the lady was rubbing my calves and all it did was make me want to get a fucking, you know what? Happy ending. It was just like, yeah, keep going, keep going. Skip the size, get to the finish line. Um, I, I dunno.

Speaker 3:          01:03:40       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:03:41       I don't really even remember the experience. I just remember I did it because she asked me to do it and I did it. And I remember laughing. I remember being really immature and when I dip my feet into the fucking water, it just was making me laugh. I was like, I almost lost control of myself because it was just something that was so fucking foreign to me. Um, and I was sitting and then the more I laughed, the more near was laughing and she just kept laughing, going, what? It's nice. It's nice. And I just kept laughing going, what are you doing to me? Um,

Speaker 1:          01:04:17       and then afterwards, I don't know, but I will say afterwards, my toes, nails where's clean as they've ever fucking bed. But, uh, you know, I'll, you know, I'll just get one of those fucking 50 cent scrub brushes. Uh, I'll just say, can you leave him alone? You know what I mean? You, you can, I understand you trying to like give them a nice experience, but like that can go a little too far. And next thing you know, you, you're wondering what happened to the man you married or maybe you're not, maybe you're more evolved. I don't know. Maybe women are more involved. I don't fucking know. Don't ask me those questions. I feel gross right now. All right. Please explain this to me. Caitlin Jenner is receiving an award at the espys for her courage, which is apparently the greatest thing ever. What they don't tell you is the person who won't be receiving the award now is Lauren Hill, the girl who was diagnosed, diagnosed with inoperable brain cancer. Oh, Lauren Hill does to singer. She played her first game. Oh, so this is a, it has the same thing. She played her first game for her college basketball game after a diagnosis. I saw this, I saw this fucking story and for months to come, she raised over a million dollars for cancer research. She died a couple of months later. So please explain to me why a guide shopping his dick off is more courageous than standing up to cancer. You know, I'll tell you why. Because you know what, at the end of the day, it's show business. That's why,

Speaker 3:          01:05:47       okay,

Speaker 1:          01:05:48       it's fucking show business. Um, I know somebody that writes on that show and I know of something that happened that I'm can't say, and someone was in the truck flipping out that it was going on too long. And all they were thinking about was, you know, going like just the worst fucking moment in my life because this person up there, I'm, I'm going to say what it was, but it's just, it's fucking show business. That's why. So they're probably going like, oh, do we want to bring the room down? Or maybe like, well, but they always have something about somebody dying on that show, the, the touching moment, you know what I mean? But then they're thinking, oh Caitlyn Jenner is really hot right now. It has the high Q rating or something like that. That'll give us more.

Speaker 3:          01:06:31       MMM.

Speaker 1:          01:06:33       I don't know why. Why, why, why? I don't understand what that award is. I can see if Katelyn just went out on one another, the castle on

Speaker 1:          01:06:42       like they kind of given basically the giving it to Bruce Jenner in a way. The way they gave fucking a Martin Scorsese, the Oscar for the departed, cause they fucked up on a raging bull. They didn't give it to him for fucking Goodfellas. They audit tool. So I think they owed Bruce Jenner of fucking sp. They never gave it to him. It's like fuck, we waited too long. Cause now Bruce is Katelyn. Well maybe we can give it to her and she can give it to him through a brain. I don't fucking know. I don't produce shows. And by that last fucking horrific answer, you can understand why. All right. The age of technology, dare Billy bombsight. I'm an open miker in a semi small city and don't really expect to get much attention in this place. Well that's a great place to start. Don't videotape yourself and get better.

Speaker 1:          01:07:30       Well, videotape yourself the don't upload it onto youtube and get used to get real good. Then move to a better city with more exposure and then become a monster. Anyways. Um, I recently found out that someone at an open mic was recording video of everyone's set off. Fuck it. Put all the capture content onto their social network page, including mine. When I found out that my shitty undeveloped open miking was on the Internet, I was furious as you should have been contacted. The individual that posted it, they have since taken most of the content down, but I had a long argument about this situation with a different person. They argued in defense of this lady by saying, this is the world we live in now. You were in a public place and that gave her the right to record you. The worst that happens is that you say something stupid and get and you get publicity for it.

Speaker 1:          01:08:15       Any publicity is good publicity. All right? You know what? That person's going to be a fucking hack. Um, he said, my argument is basically that if she earns any money from my content, then I have a right to be pissed off. I also feel very uneasy thinking about the possibility of saying something stupid about a current event and getting flak on Twitter just because I thought it was funny and no one else did. Yeah. And you're also brand new to comedy and you should be allowed to make mistakes, uh, with the recent popularity of the APP periscope and hearing you bitch a little bit about it. I would like to hear your opinion on this argument. Thanks. And Go shag yourself. A PSU still have fans in Nebraska. Um, yeah, no, I'm a hundred percent agreement with you. You should be allowed to develop as an open micro, but you can't get mad at the lady.

Speaker 1:          01:09:01       Like they don't understand that what they're doing could be detrimental. Um, and it is the world that we live in because people do do that. But you're, you, you are right. Um, and I don't understand why everybody feels like they have to videotape every fucking moment of their lives. Now. It's all like, it's almost like they're campaigning for this office of, Hey, I have the coolest life. Like always taken a selfie. Like, you know, this is me and old faithful. You know, it's so what I was supposed to look at it like, wow, this guy is fucking goes everywhere. You know what I mean? I, I don't, I don't understand it. I mean, I guess I do that though and I do that. I took a picture of me and, uh, well it wasn't a Selfie, but me and Bart, nick, when we were in Reno with that iconic sign, I don't know, but I wish people wouldn't do it at live events.

Speaker 1:          01:09:58       Um, especially when there's jokes because the new jokes become old jokes. But, um, I think that's going to end because they're now coming out with these, as these businesses popping up for entertainers where they're going to block people's cell phones during the performance, which is, uh, just pretty awesome. I think if it's like up to the artists, although I'm also guilty cause I watch all this shit that people videotape the Stevie Ray Vaughan and that type of thing. Um, and then you get to enjoy the performance. But, you know, I don't think I'm going out on a limb to say that you're not at your Stevie ray Vaughan level of being a standup yet. It'd be nice if he could be allowed to develop. Um, people have recorded my shows and whenever I reach out to him on Youtube, they always take them down. I never get mad at him.

Speaker 1:          01:10:42       I understand that they're not in the business and they don't get what that what they're doing actually hurts me on some level. Um, so just deal with it. Whatever. Fuck that dude who, Jay, this is the world we live in. You know those people who don't get mad that the government can record all your phone conversations? It just like, well, hey, you know, if you're not doing anything wrong, what's the problem? Those fucking people. Anyways, I gotta I gotta wrap this up here cause I gotta be on the bus in 10 minutes. Uh, roommates lady wants to move in a, hey Billy Bob, ginger tits, Jesus Christ, enough with the red head jokes. Can you guys go with something new? It's getting fucking boring here. Um, my roommate of five years has this new lady who is cool, but off the bad seems kind of manipulative. He told me that she's getting kicked out of her place and she wants to move into our two bedroom apartment in New York City, which isn't that big.

Speaker 1:          01:11:31       As you would know for three months, she wants to move there for three months. The rest would be split three ways. They're planning on moving in together after she stays for three months. Do I accept the cheaper rent or tell her to take a hike? By the way, they'd been dating for six months. You rule. Go Fuck Yourself. Now. That manipulative con is going to end up convincing her boy, boyfriend. You're going to be the guy who's going to leave because she's not going to leave. They're going to ask you to leave and you're like, fuck you, I'm not leaving, and then it's going to be two against one and your, your life's going to be miserable. Do not on any level allow her to move in. Say this is a two bedroom apartment. This is for two people, not for three. It affects my quality of life.

Speaker 1:          01:12:09       There's not enough money in the fucking universe for me to compromise my, um, my quality of life. So no, that's it. No. And you stand by that and fuck him. Okay. And fuck her. And then that's it. And you won't have to deal with that situation. And with any luck, he'll fucking move out and you'll get another roommate and you won't be involved in that situation. Then you'll have more power because then you'll have been there longer than the other person. All right? That is one of the easiest questions ever. Do not on any level. Let her move in six months in, you're codependent fucking pussy. He'll fuck yourself. Oh my God. And then now you got to wait. You're gonna have to wait 10 times longer to go into the bathroom. Cause not only do you have another roommate, it's a woman and they take for fucking ever, cause he can fucking go to put on all that clown makeup and shit. All right, I'm done. Go fuck yourselves. I'll talk to you next week.
