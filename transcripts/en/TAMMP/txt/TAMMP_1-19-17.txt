Speaker 1:          00:00:01       Hey, what's going on? It's bill burn his time for the Thursday afternoon. Just before Friday. Monday morning podcast data.

Speaker 1:          00:00:11       Just checking in on you. Ah, just checking in on your week. How's it go? One hour you're slogging your way through another one, settling in to 2017 as it had been. Everything that you expected so far, are you still going to the gym? Have you have or are you sticking with your, I'm not going to take the bait, you know, with your, your, whatever the fuck you're dating, whatever you're rent to, whatever you have led into your fucking apartment. Be it a flat, a one bedroom of fucking a studio. I mean, or a fucking maybe got a little house, you know? Do you know that's one of the top reasons people get a house. It's because they fall in love with somebody and the only way to keep it going is there has to be another room for you to walk into. You know, there has to be a door that you could walk through and close.

Speaker 1:          00:01:12       See, you just can't see the person. Even if he can hear him. You just need that space. That's what it is, which really shows you what con's super rich people are considering. They have a fucking mansion, you know, and it's still not, it's still not enough room for them to get away. They get divorced left and right. You know, or this is, they go into another room. Right. And, but there's always somebody in there, somebody's Dustin off of vase or some shit. See, you can't just have that alone time to just go in there and just sort of yell, whisper. Right. You can't do it.

Speaker 1:          00:01:54       Um, I wonder if your spouse ever saw or your boyfriend, girlfriend, whatever the fucking issue were to ever saw a highlight reel of the shit that you said when you got into your car after a fucking disagreement. Um, it would either be the funniest shit I think with me and my wife would be fucking hilarious. Uh, I think her shit about me, we hilarious. Mine wouldn't be, you know, you know, cause I'm angry because I'm the guy. Cause what? Cause we're always raw, you know, according to those doctor Phil shows, we don't have a fucking leg to stand on. Um, anyways, speaking of which, you know what? I got to admit, I actually watched three days in a row of whale. Oh, for Jan and I missed it last night. And uh, I was actually upset. I think I'm actually gonna put that on my DVR to record the show. There's just something so mindlessly fun about that show. He just sit there and you try to yell the letters with them. Hey, there's t um,

Speaker 2:          00:03:02       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:03:03       And jeopardy. I'm telling you right now, I'm so sick of people thinking that people in jeopardy of fucking smart, those people are nerds. Okay. The book smart. No, nobody. I've never seen one person on that show look like they have any sort of a vision. Okay, you give him a fucking book. Yeah, they're going to read it in a day. They're going to retain 80% of the information and then some day, you know, at a cocktail party or a game show, they're going to puke it up when you fucking go, Hey, what's the capitol of fucking Tanzania? That's even a country. They'll fucking tell you what it is and what the state bird is. You know what I mean? They end the day, know some shit about classical music. They all his fucking trivial. It's trivial shit to be honest with you.

Speaker 1:          00:03:47       It's just shit. You know, the only purpose for no one, like 90% of the shit that they have on that show, if you really think about it, it just, it doesn't help you in your life, you know, depending on what you're looking to do. I mean, if you want to make like a zillion dollars, it's like no one, all that shit does not help you. Like, wow, this guy knows, or this woman knows a lot of shit. Yeah, but what, what do, what do you know about you fucking baroque music? You know, you go to crossword puzzles,

Speaker 2:          00:04:18       I'm telling you,

Speaker 1:          00:04:20       you got to have a different kind of smart, you got to have Donald Trump intelligence. Okay? And what you need to learn how to do is you have to learn how to mobilize morons.

Speaker 2:          00:04:34       You know,

Speaker 1:          00:04:36       and I'm not saying just because you voted for Donald Trump, you're Maura, but you know what I mean? I'm talking about,

Speaker 2:          00:04:41       yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:04:42       I'm talking about the kinds of people that would be excited if like Mayweather fought Conor McGregor, you know, not seeing that for what the fuck it's going to be, which is basically about 12 people vacuuming $100 a zillion people's pockets. Why would you want to see that? It's like that is a lose lose, right? If they have that fight and it's, it's going to be boxing only, it's going to, it's over. If it's, if it's going to be MMA rules, Mayweather's going to lose. It's going to be over in two seconds. It's the stupidest fucking thing. You know what it goes back to? It goes back like that fight. We'll, we'll, if that happens, will be no different than when fucking Bobby Riggs played tennis against Billie Jean King. At least he was a fucking tennis player.

Speaker 2:          00:05:35       You know,

Speaker 1:          00:05:38       I would say it'd be more like when Muhammad Ali fought Lowel Zaida that's not fair. Somebody compared to a Muhammad Ali fought like the best, you know, uh, Japanese wrestlers in like 1976 now, I'm assuming it was actually real wrestling and not like the fake shit where they still fucking break their necks. But you know what I mean? The predetermined, um, is it, was it Bobby Riggs? I think that that was the guy's name. The guy played bill fight a fight. I mean, fucking played tennis against Billy Jean King. You know, it was so fucking pathetic about that is that was considered a big victory for women that the best tennis female tennis player in her fucking prime beat like a fucking 57 year old former champion is the thing though. He was winning games. He actually didn't do that bad. And then years later there was stuff that came out, said he was a degenerate gambler and that he possibly, you know, could have placed a bet on Billie Jean King made it look good for a minute and then fucking, I dunno what someone is. Yeah, buddy of mine was talking about that. See the, you know Dana Way off from both 25 million bucks. Of course he did. Of course he did because he's going to find 50 million fucking idiots to give him a hundred bucks. Um, anyways. Yeah. What would you, you know, would you want to see a baker get involved in a, a cooking contest with, okay, we're going to smoke meat today. We've got a champion guy fucking, and he's won every smoking the meat comp I can contest. He's going against. The Gal makes cupcakes.

Speaker 1:          00:07:17       They're both in the kitchen. They're both making food. But I guess the other guys outside, you know what I mean? It's just two completely different fucking fix. All right. Um, anyways, and that's what Donald Trump did. Donald Trump was able to fucking do that. He got enough of them together. And that's what you need to do. All right. And I'll tell you right now, I haven't yet to see a contestant on jeopardy who can even remotely get the mouth breathers. They key to get the fucking heard moving towards whatever cliff you'd want them to fucking topple over. They don't have it. You know, just sitting there going like, uh, you know, I'll take a, I dunno, I'll take ancient Indian construction for $700. Uh, this structure was, uh, well, one of the most popular for lack of a plan was there in the 60. [inaudible]. What is a wigwam?

Speaker 1:          00:08:12       Uh, let me get door hinges from Switzerland Circa of, uh, Jesus crisis 32nd birthday for 200. You're not going to fucking get anywhere or maybe I'm just insecure when I watch it. All right, let's go. Let's get, maybe we're getting to the real shit here, by the way. I have a Boston Detroit came on in the fucking background. You know what's hilarious as they just showed a skyline and I think I saw the casino I played right across the fucking way, you know, we had just into Canada. You know, um, Jesus Christ, the Bruins play in the island is holy shit. What a shit show that was. That was one of the worst games I've seen them play in a long, long fucking time. Got smoked four to nothing and now much of the Redwings and all of a sudden they come out, they're ready to play.

Speaker 1:          00:09:02       And you got to ask yourself, where is this night in and night? Um, I honestly didn't know. They tearing down Joe Louis Arena. They're saying this is the last Bruins regular season game ever, um, against, uh, against the Redwings here at Joe Louis Arena. That's I, you know, and I got a chance to go to that one. I went to a, believe it or not, I went to a, uh, red wings Penguin's game in, uh, I don't know how many years ago. And I quickly learned that you have to sit back in that stadium if you fucking lean forward and everyone behind you has to lean forward. It's like there was all these fucking rules, but because I'm a considerate con, I was able to figure it out by halfway, you know, halfway through the first period, you know, with people screaming at me from behind and I was like, all right, I get this shit, I get it.

Speaker 1:          00:09:50       But it's just one of these fucked up arenas where you can't even stand up if you stand up and applaud the play. Half your head is blocking the TV screen of whatever the TV camera. Um, but anyways, I want to say this, this'll be the third. This is the second one they're going to get rid of. And then the next one will be their third. They played, it was at Olympia or something like that, which I have no recollection of really. I don't think. I think the first time I remember watching the fucking Redwings was the early eighties and I think in the late seventies they get rid of that one. Oh see this is some, this right here. This is some shit on jeopardy. I'll take a arenas, former arenas that sports franchises played in. What is county stadium? Excellent. What does that get you in life? You know, when it gets you a kit, you sitting in your fucking pajamas doing a God damn podcast Thursday morning, that's where it gets you.

Speaker 1:          00:10:50       Um, so anyways, I haven't been doing shit, no kid yet. So you know, we're coming right up on going full term. So I think, uh, you know, we're going to have to induce or something like that. But either way, most likely, you know, barring some sort of like a miracle, I should be dead next week. I think it finally goes down that all right. And then my whole perspective changes. What are you guys going to do if I really, you know, there's some people have kids, they don't fucking change it all. And then there's other people that have kids they change, which I think is shit, right? But what do you guys do if I just fuck if I go off the fucking rails, you know, I stopped Carson, I stopped saying, can't, you know what I mean? I find God, I reevaluate everything. That fucking remotely makes me funny. Nothing, nothing for a third time. Not Robs of all your humor, like finding your savior, you know what I mean? All of a sudden you give a shit about people, you know, you have empathy. You put yourself in other people's position. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:12:10       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:12:11       Which is also known as empathy. Now I've seen it. I've seen it in the past. I've seen, I've just seen too, I've seen musicians, I've seen Comedians, I've seen all of that. They find God. They get away from, what the fuck got you. Got You to the God damn dance. All right. It ain't happening with me. I'm calling it right now. What do you think? I'm, you think I'm going to start reading? I will read what? I become a dead. You know, I'm going to read these kids' books. Whichever Deli. I don't even, I don't even get, I guess that Caterpillar One's a classic book. I never saw. I never saw that one when I was a kid. I liked to make way for ducklings. I like where the wild things are.

Speaker 2:          00:12:52       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:12:52       Um, and that was it. And that was the two books. I liked it. And then other than that, I liked fucking football cards and not doing my homework. That's what I enjoyed. Hey Dad, what did you enjoy most about your childhood? Uh, blowing off the assignment and the challenge of pretending that I did it. Uh, the next day in class, that's what I remember joining the most. I like drawing on desks. Uh, getting in trouble, going down to the principal's office with a friend was always fun by yourself, was a lonely experience, you know, sitting on that bench waiting to go in there. William, come on in it for a second. Uh, Ms, uh, [inaudible] as Sarah said to you at tech and they do it, I'll let shit you just, you just standing there going like, why are you talking to me? Like I can actually plead my case and you're going to be on my fucking say, oh, I didn't look at it that way ever. Evidently the teacher was wrong. Just give me the fucking detention. You fucking cunt. You know, it's funny, when I really looked back, my, uh, the principal, vice principal and my school, he's a gavel leash to dole out the punishment. He used to dress like the geek squad guys who upon seeing a hidden figures dressed like he worked at NASA,

Speaker 2:          00:14:10       you know,

Speaker 1:          00:14:13       I don't fucking know. Anyways, what am I talking about here? Let's plow ahead all we got some football this weekend yet that worded, you know what, one of the, one of the dangerous things to do when you're watching NFL playoffs is not to realize while you're watching it, that the NFL season is almost over you. So fucking excited that it's the playoffs. Who's going to win? I said this, I said, dad, dude, I called it. I got, I fucking put my kids' college education on the Pittsburgh Steelers. What the point? Fuck it.

Speaker 2:          00:14:46       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:14:47       42, Detroit. I mean, 42 Bruins. God dammit. We needed to get that next one out in the second period. Uh, you know, you know, I swear to God with fucking hockey nowadays, the second they got rid of the red line, there's no lead that's safe. Back in the day you went up three goals. The fucking game was over. There was going to be like a fucking bench clearing brawl because the other team knew that they weren't going to win. Right. So they sell high. Well, if we're not going to beat you will beat the shit out of you. And that, that was hockey. That was the hockey that I remembered. Um,

Speaker 2:          00:15:18       yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:15:18       Now you go up three to nothing and it's, you know, for candidate, you can go up three to nothing and you go into the third period, you can still be going into overtime. So it was three, nothing Bruins. Then three to one, then four to one, and now it's 42.

Speaker 2:          00:15:33       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:15:33       Yeah. Jesus Christ. Anyways, um, you know something, I've been meditating so much, uh, I just been consistently not by lot that actually losing my shit now feels weird. It just felt weird to scream. Fucking cut there. I wasn't really mad. It was just upset. One of those two things. The same thing, Bill. You know what, go fuck yourself. Uh, anyways. Anyway. Yeah. So you're watching the NFL playoffs and you forget because you're so fucking excited that it's the playoffs and you're going to get to see somebody, you know, the best teams play each other. Next thing you know, it's the super bowl and he gets you. He gets your first taste of no fucking football. When, uh, there's that break between the, for whatever fucking reason between the, uh, the NFC and AFC gene games, championship games, and the Super Bowl, you get that first Sunday that comes by, you know, back in the day they used to give you the pro bowl ego Fuckos right? Um, is 22 people not really trying and that was your first hand of, Oh wait a minute, they're going to play the fucking super bowl and then I have to sit here for another six months with no fucking football. So what I'm saying is try to enjoy it.

Speaker 1:          00:16:53       There's only three football games left in the year. You know, I'm not trying to ram actually raining on the fucking parade here, but uh, that's something I always forget. And then all of a sudden the Superbowl's over and then, then, you know, you're not even thinking, wow, I can't believe this team beat that team or this team loss, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. And then next Sunday comes along and you're sitting there on your front porch waiting for your absentee father that show up in the eight common, he's not coming to the end of the summer. You got to grow six inches and he finally going to show up. Hey, what's up sport? How you've been on a fuck. Have you been, um, anyways, let me read a little bit of advertising here for this week. Um, as it rained again last night, rain, rain pretty much all night long, which is great, man. We're just getting a ton of fucking rain out here. And uh,

Speaker 1:          00:17:46       but I don't subscribe to that fucking lunacy that the drought is over. Yeah. In, in the, in the, in the near future it is. Put it in the fucking net. You can't, uh, you come here, come the Goddamn read books. You can feel it. I tell you right now, the next goal is the most important goal. It's cake. It's difference between five to two or 43. Give a one team hope putting the gave away. All right, let's, let's read a little bit advertising here. Oh, [inaudible] Miyan d play enough fucking red wings. But Dude, dude, my Mondays, Mondays losing them would be a sin. Meaning not as a right man. Fuck them with their red and white UNIS. I don't like that. They're called hockey town. It's a bad nickname. And you shouldn't give one to your fucking self. That's up to your friends. Oh yeah. Why would you give yourself a nickname?

Like that's, that's their retirement plan. That's how bad the bankers have fucked over this country. Hey, by the way, considering the Federal Reserve is not a, uh, it's private corporation.

Speaker 1:          00:20:49       Here's my question. Where does the money, where do the, what is your tax dollars go? Your federal income tax dollars. It goes to the Federal Reserve. What do they spend that money on? I get it. I get at a fucking state level that that's allegedly going to go to fucking fix and pothole. Let me get back to me on me. Undies knows that your special, someone deserves a special fabric, which is why their underwear is made exclusively out of modal, modal of fabric with a touch three times softer than cotton. Beyond has a special limited edition Valentine's undies, which means you and your Valentine's can match and yeah, it's as cute as it sounds. Jesus Christ. Yeah, that's great. Dress.

If you're at the top of the fucking Federal Reserve, why would you pay taxes? What do you, what are you going to fucking investigate yourself?

Speaker 1:          00:22:28       Do you know any, any money made past 11 million? All right. Say you're really fucking successful. You come up with some sort of APP, you know, you were smart enough not to go on shark tank, so they didn't buy it off you for fucking $30. You know, you retain the money. You like that Facebook guy, right? That little fucking cunt. You know, we stole the idea from all his fucking Harvard people for probably, I don't know, they're making money in oil in Iraq now. You know, all his Harvard people, you know, if they don't, if they don't end up like being comedy writers, they just kind of go around the world doing horrible things, don't they? Isn't that what all Ivy League people do? You know, they start managing, affirm that fucking cuts down the Amazon.

Speaker 1:          00:23:19       Oh, this is just sour grapes from someone who couldn't even go to a community college. Um, what was I saying? Yeah. Like wait, what do they use that money for? If the Federal Reserve is in fact a private corporation, you give them the fucking money. Where the fuck does it go? So our, I was going to say, so after any money you make after $11 million, that money you already paid taxes on that you then should just be able to give the a kids nice. You just sit around getting a drug habit. You know, if you, if you make over 11 million bucks, if you give it to them, you then have your kids have to pay 45% tax to the fucking IRS, which means any sort of sizable fortune. Okay. The IRS gets 45% of that. Every fucking sizable afforded a Rod Kevin Durant under 90 million, you know, provided, you know, they don't blow their money, which is something to be said too. This is what you should do. You should just go out and blow your fucking cash, but don't fucking blow it on stuff. Just go around a regular people and give it to them. There's gotta be a way to turn it around. You can't do that. You can't give them out free this, that kind of money. Actually. Maybe you could

Speaker 1:          00:24:34       then they get these psycho. Fuck you. Oh, nice. Safe. Nice. It it didn't save it. Four or three. Ah, Jesus Christ. Oh, you know how much of the red wing fans and join this, cause you know the fucking outcome of this game, aren't you?

Speaker 2:          00:24:55       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:24:56       Are we really going to blow it three nothing to lead in the first fucking period. Is that what we're going to do? Oh, that's great. Everybody can fucking go behind the net goal for the puck. That looks like me playing pickup hockey and I am a puck. Chase a jackass. I have not played hockey and like, well over a year. I didn't play one slash two year. I get hockey stuff. Just sit in my God damn bag I was supposed to play last week. Yeah, it was just fucking eight. Anyways, movement watches everybody. Oh, it's going to say, yeah, if he gave every, if every, if every fucking say that Facebook can right. Just kind of gives away his money just to regular people. What would be great about that is that, uh, the first thing I would immediately do is I would invest in whatever companies make four wheelers,

Speaker 2:          00:25:42       right?

Speaker 1:          00:25:43       Jacuzzis jet skis. Like the average fucking guy who wins the lottery. I mean, that's what they're going to buy. You're going to get a Jacuzzi, you're going to get a jet ski and you're going to get a four wheeler. All right? Then what else are they gonna do? They're going to have that and know what the fuck by George Foreman Grill. I have no idea, but the three out of four of those you'll hit and the stock market, all right? Then you get all these cards out there, okay? They're not going to have to work, which means they're going to be drunk and they're going to get on these four wheelers. They're going to tip over and they're going to crush their, their ribs will crush their, their, their vitals and the population will start to go doubt. Maybe. Maybe that's what it is. Maybe that's how the Illuminati plants to thin out the herd. Um, MVMT watches everybody movement watches the company started the company started by two broke college kids. I don't understand how you started fucking company if you're broke, but we're flat broke. Let's start making watches, um, that wanted to wear stylists, watches but couldn't afford them. So they started their own watch company.

Speaker 1:          00:26:49       How is this like how you started?

Speaker 2:          00:26:52       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:26:53       Built a following lunch to the podcast. You've,

Speaker 2:          00:26:56       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:26:57       They have the weirdest copy.

Speaker 2:          00:34:00       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:34:00       I bought a safe cause I had like, you know, moved out and all that shit. Well, shit moved out and moved out for 10 years and somebody hit me all fucking paranoid. You know that if I lost my birth certificate, my passport, you know, by done my first standup special and I had the original like whatever the, the master copy of it and basically if that thing was gone, I was afraid I was fucked. Oh No. Break away. They scored four to four. It was three to nothing. Then it was three to one, then it was four to one, then was 42 then it was 43 then it was four to four. These fucking constant scored three goals. We haven't scored anything. How does, how does this even happen?

Speaker 1:          00:34:49       Oh yeah. Our defenseman falls down. Yeah, that'll do it. I got to tell you kids, one of the big things you want to void when you're playing team hockey, it's the fucking, we just fell down. Ah, that's all right. That's all right. All right. Anyways, so I get this. I just got this little fucking, you know, it wasn't even that bad. The fucking safe was like the size of like a kitchen fridge. I mean one of those little ones. So you know what I mean? One of those ones that you can also use as like a nightstand. So one of the things about getting a safe is she don't want anybody to know that you have it, you know, or a kind of defeats the fucking purpose. So these assholes come

Speaker 2:          00:35:31       okay

Speaker 1:          00:35:31       to fucking deliver the safe. And I'm living on a second floor walk.

Speaker 2:          00:35:38       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:35:38       It's what I'm in New York City, right? I live in a second floor walkup, which is great. So, um, you know, oh, we just fuck it's gone. Adam McQuaid. Five to four.

Speaker 2:          00:35:54       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:35:55       This game is shaping up. Did anybody see that? Penguins fucking capitals game eight to seven. Here we go.

Speaker 1:          00:36:04       The fuck is going. They didn't even play in goal. He had a clean look at that too. Oh, it tipped and then it bounced between his fucking balls. The old five hall there. Anyways, so I'm living in New York City. I got a second floor fucking walk up. So I have these guys deliver it. Right. And like I said, the thing is you want nobody know that you have it. Not only do you want to have a fucking safe, but you don't want anybody to know that you have it because immediately you get is safe. People think you have bars of gold worth half a million of whack in there. We're just gonna fucking busted your apartment and find a fucking, you know, my birth certificate and the fucking, you know, the, the master to my first standup special. So the dude shows up. Now the thing about a fucking safe is not only, there's two things about a safe one, you know, once someone to be able to crack the safe, you know, pick the lock or whatever and get in there.

Speaker 1:          00:36:55       And number two, you don't want it to be like, you don't want someone to be able to just be able to pick it up and leave with it. So then they can go to their house and take a fucking blow torch. So it's gotta be really fucking heavy. It's gotta be hard to break into. And then, you know, depending on the thickness, you know, it can survive a fire for a specified amount of time. So I get this basic fucking safe, you know, I don't wait a couple, I don't know, a couple of hundred pounds. I don't know when it weighed. And this fucking guy shows up with this. I never seen this thing before. It was an elected, an electronic two wheeler. Okay. And I lived in this old building to flow, walk up. He shows up like Saturday morning, everybody's asleep in every step. He press a button and it would lift the safe up and then he, I don't know. And then the wheels would go up to the next thing and it was the loudest fucking noise ever. Every state. And we got here.

Speaker 3:          00:37:48       Yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:37:56       he did two flights of stairs and everybody's open in their apartments, looking out, seeing the safe and then looking at me and see me standing there with my fucking door open. Like nothing to see here. Everybody just buying a safe from my bars of gold. I fucking was so convinced that my apart what was going to get broken into. Um, and then what was funny when I went to move out, I just had friends helped me move out and we didn't have that thing. So then I just had to leave the safe. I just left to safe and gave the person the combination. And that's what happens to all safes. Like wherever they get delivered to his, where they fucking stay, uh, there never moved than haven't booked because they're too fucking heavy and you just, you just gotta say fuck it. You leave him now leave it. Yeah. Um, anyways, is that the podcast for this week? I have no idea. My wife's gonna kill me. I screaming about every goal and a fucking imitating somebody bringing us safe up two flights of stairs. Excuse me. I just belched that's that, you know, something that's not a, that's not a formula for a happy, for a happy marriage. Anyways, that is a Thursday afternoon, just before Friday. Monday morning podcasts. I know what you want to, you want to hear my predictions, don't ya? Um,

Speaker 1:          00:39:15       my prediction for Patriots Steelers. Ah, I don't have a good feeling about it. You know, I thought we looked like shit against the Texans. So I'm doing what every Patriot fan is doing. I'm hoping that that was our one bad playoff game. Like you can do that in the playoffs. So yeah, you can do it if there's no JJ watts and a, you got a rookie quarterback, you know, I guess she can get away with a bad fucking game. But, uh, I was not impressed with our offensive line last week. And the Pittsburgh Steelers always have a fucking great defense. So, you know, big Ben, the Steelers at due to beat us, man, they haven't beat us in a big game in a long time. But, uh, I'm going to go with my hat and I'm going to say the patriots are going to eat out. They're going to eke out a victory at home and a Gillette stadium.

Speaker 2:          00:40:03       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:40:04       You know, that's, that's what I'm open. I'm hoping we go up early. That's what I'm hoping. I don't want to see us try to play catch up against those guys. Uh, alright. And then what else we got? We got the Falcons and we get the Green Bay packers and uh, am I going to disrespect the falcons two weeks in a row? You know, so I don't even know where this game is. I'm going to pick a, you know, something. If the Falcons win, this would be Matt. Ryan's like fucking finally getting the respect he deserves.

Speaker 2:          00:40:40       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:40:40       Then he got an Aaron fucking Rogers.

Speaker 2:          00:40:45       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:40:45       Is it in Green Bay? I, if it's in Green Bay, I got to go with the packers. I Dunno, they beat Seattle, but what the fuck? Seattle was hurt. You know, if they're the fucking up by whoever the fuck it was came in, they're stepping on their quarterback's foot. Gave him two points. Let's see what we got here. This is, this is how every gambler, most gamblers makes their decisions before they put their kids college tuition down. This is right here is literally the level of research that they'll do. Where is that Gig? Is that in Green Bay? It's in Georgia. Ah,

Speaker 2:          00:41:20       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:41:22       This gets more interesting. Wait a minute. Point spread.

Speaker 2:          00:41:27       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:41:28       It's got a good spread. What do you got here? What do you got here at Green Bay packers versus betting odds? Just give me the fucking odds. Falcons packers. Why won't they do that? How can we, if you say, what does this mean in German? It just comes right up. If he asked for the fucking,

Speaker 3:          00:41:44       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:41:44       They asked for the fucking odds. I gotta Click on somebody's site. That's so they get, they get credit for uh, for eyeballs and this site, right. You know, this is such, this is why I hate the fucking Internet sometimes. You Know Ali? Okay, right there, right there. Green Bay packers at death. That was minus five and a half. Shut up. I don't even know what I'm doing. And you want me to hit pause? I'm not going to torture you guys with this. Hold on a sec. All right. Since the falcons open as five and a half point favorites, the total was 59.5 59 and a half earlier in the week. That's the over under according to the sports book. All right. I don't know shit about either one of these teams.

Speaker 3:          00:42:29       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:42:29       Oh, I tell you. Got To take the package with the points. If you're betting, you know what I mean? You're gonna get Aaron Rodgers fucking six points, almost six points. Um, fuck. I don't know shit. I'm going to say,

Speaker 3:          00:42:49       yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:42:49       do I do it? Do I take a chance on the new guy? There's a new quarterback in town and he's failing. Good. That was the theme to Alice. If you guys ever watched that fucking show, uh yeah. Fuck. I gotta go Green Bay. Green Bay goes in, breaks that fucking hearts, you know. That's what I say. They're going to go in there and somehow they're going to get it done. That's what I fucking, you know what? I'm going to go with the tried and true. I'm going to go Aaron Rodgers and the Green Bay packers. There you go. You heard it hear first from a standup comedian who hasn't watched a lot of football the last couple of years. All right, so take your hard earned cash. You know, put it on Aaron Rodgers. Get yourself fired. A half points, said a that doesn't work out. Uh, you know, that's what you get full listening to. A stand up comedian. Go fuck yourselves. Have a great weekend. You constant. I'll talk to

Speaker 3:          00:43:40       you on Monday.

Speaker 4:          00:44:49       Hey everybody, what's going on? It's still, it is the Monday morning podcast. I believe it's January, January 19th. Martin Luther King Day. Happy Martin Luther King Day. Everybody. Um, yeah, Obama's getting in this week. I don't know if you noticed, spent a lot of parties. I gotta be honest with you. I couldn't watch any of it and I heard some reports of what was going to be going on and I just got like those embarrassing, uh, you know, I just heard that they were taking white artists and black artists and putting them together and uh, you know, that old tired thing like this is kind of a scary thing or are, you know, now if they were having a white artists and a black artists get together and then beat the shit out of a banker, then I would be like, okay, now we're a, we're getting somewhere. But if you just going to put James Taylor with fucking I, you know, and then they're going to do a folk that then turns into a rap of, uh, knowing the Carolina in my mind, whatever the fuck it is. You know what's funny? I just sang the melody with the wrong words. No, in my mind, I'm going to Carolina. I still fucking roller blade.

Speaker 4:          00:46:19       Um, [inaudible] James Taylor's really into rollerblading. I bet you didn't know that. Well, listen, if you're new to my page, let me get right off. Let me just get right off on the right foot here. This is going to be a rough one. I'm, let me get off to the, on the right foot. You know what? It's early and I have to work out and I was like, I gotta get this fucking thing out of the way that sounds approaching this podcast this week. I have to get this thing out of the fucking way. And I don't know about you guys, but whenever I approach something like I have to get this out of the way, something suffers and it's usually the quality. Okay. So I want all of you guys, wherever you're at, to just lower your fucking expectations, okay? Because I am on, let's get this out of the way.

Speaker 4:          00:47:02       Mowed this week. All right, button going hardcore with my workout. Just had 98 proteins doing this new fucking diet, man. It's just fucking ridiculous. It's ridiculous. But it's working. It's working. But I know in the back of my head, eventually you're going to get to where you want bill, and then you're got to go off the Diet and then you gotta to fucking get, you know, get a big Charlie Brown head again. That's what's going to happen. Um, but anyways, the news page, I'll do one of those diets where you like weigh your food. Three nights, it's a chicken dance answer. The primers on cheese and ten eight egg whites, which is a whole fucking Carden. I swear to God. By the end of it, you just want to Puke, but somehow you lose weight. It's all like a, it's like chemistry. Is that what it's like bill?

Speaker 4:          00:47:50       Is it really like chemistry? Have you ever taken a chemistry class? A why? No. No, I haven't. Then how would you know? It's like chemistry. You don't, all right. That's what I'm doing. Heckle in myself this week. Um, yeah. You know something. I'm already kind of a no bill. Stick with what the fuck you wanted to. Let's, let's have some sort of beginning, middle and end to this thing. All right. Okay. Let's start with the basics. If you new to my page, I do one of these every single week. I do it every single Monday. People send me in questions and I answered them to the best of my ability. People send in their list of stuff that they feel is underrated, overrated. And lately much to my pleasure is that the word? I don't know. Two full of protein. I need some carbs to be able to pull up the right fucking word here.

Speaker 4:          00:48:40       Um, I really enjoyed the fact that a lot of people are weighing in on a lot of the stuff that I'm talking about. Like, um, and also introducing new subjects because uh, you know, I don't want to be doing the same shit. You know, it'd be doing this podcast 20 years from now and just being like, oh, battery power, um, underrated. Fucking, uh, Gabe Kaplan's come back. All right. That was overrated. Underrated in the year 2029 when gay clamp with Kaplan will be 96. Um, I saw him on the world series of poker and wow, you know, this had fucking aging thing where some people try to prevent it and that's when you get in trouble. You got to go with it. You've got to use a Kido, you know, you just, you just go with it, you know, you know, you know fucking Oh, by the way, I also saw blazing saddles recently and uh, two things I want to say is Gavi, Johnson is the best fucking laugh.

Speaker 4:          00:49:51       I got in about three months, absolutely dying, laughing. And if anybody can explain to me why the actor who played Gabby Johnson made the choice to start swinging his arms, it's, it's fucking genius. And Gene Wilder has the most horrific powdered wig comb over I have ever seen in my life. What was that bowling movie that, uh, Bill Murray was in and they had those really bad comb overs. He puts them to shame. What the fuck was the name of that movie? Candle? Big 10. The fuck was that movie called Gardner Ball had something to do with Boeing. I don't know these people right now screaming at that dashboards in the car, like they know the right answer. Like you're going to get a star or something. The fuck was the name of that movie. All right. Anyways, um, yeah, so I do one of these, every single week is such a fucking mess.

Speaker 4:          00:50:51       And uh, I also hype shit that I have coming up. Like these are my three big dates that I have coming up this week. I am at the Improv in Houston and a surprisingly I've been getting a lot of emails because I didn't draw a shit last time. I was their mom, frogger. And um, you can go to Improv too. Dot Com for tickets or you can just click on the link right on my, uh, run on my homepage, which I imagine probably still says that I'm going to be a Tampa this week, which isn't true. I just haven't changed it. Really need to get a fucking assistant that's on my list of shit to do. Um, and February 6th, I'm going to be at the Wilbur Theater in Boston, Massachusetts. And then on the seventh, I'm going to be out in chickopee Chicopee, Massachusetts. Um, and then a couple of weekends after that, I am going to be making my debut appearance in Ogden, Utah.

Speaker 4:          00:51:51       So all you Mormons, you know, fucking come on down to the Goddamn show. Why don't you, when you're 18 wives come down to the show and sit there and judge me. You know, I'll tell you, you know something. I don't know anything about Mormons other than Steve Young as a Mormon. That's the only thing I know about him. And you guys have a lot of wives and uh, for some reason, when I think about you, I think about the Amish, which I know isn't true. I know it's not fair. I actually, there's a college out there a long time ago and uh, it was really weird, like all the kids out there, how like for pepper press they were, this is out in front of sell tickets in Utah by basically attacking the main religion out there. That's real smart though. No, it was just really weird.

Speaker 4:          00:52:35       I felt like I was in the footloose, you know, people weren't allowed to dance. They weren't allowed to fuck. Anyways, let's get on with this. This podcast is starting to lose momentum. I can feel it. I'm like fucking Steve Austin and the beginning of $6 million man, you know, she's breaking up. She's breaking up. I can't hold it. Steve Austin astronaut, a man barely alive. We can put on a new foot. All right. Um, here's something that somebody said to me recently. Um, and this whole thing is judged because basically I drive a Prius, which, you know, driving a Prius yet people really fucking judge you. Like I pulled up in front of this, uh, just try to get an extra key made from my apartment and I get up, go and get out of my car. And I was like, pull up as these two douche bags with green, green peace sweatshirts on.

Speaker 4:          00:53:28       And they immediately eyeball me, you know, and I'm like, Oh God, right. And I get out of the car and the girl goes, I swear to God, she's like, hey, their Prius driver. So I go, he there chick with a green peace sweatshirt, you know, really what the country tone in my voice as if to say, I don't care about whales. Do you know, maybe I'm just a tight fuck. Who doesn't want to pay for gas? Do you ever think about that? But that doesn't stop her. She just keeps coming at me. He has time. He has hands. I go, no, no I don't. She's like, you know, he takes a second and I walked around the corner and I want you to this key place to get my, you know, my key done. And uh, you know, God does the key in to second.

Speaker 4:          00:54:16       I come walking back out, I mean literally within the first, the same two minutes of this woman talking to me and I clearly didn't want to talk to her and she sees me again and she's still coming at me and she said some shit like, come on, you know it's your Prius driver. Just sign up. It's easy peasy. What? She said it's easy fucking Pz, which made me want to go buy a bus and take the muffler off of it. You know, it's easy peasy. Goes to come on and you drive a Prius. I'm like, how do you even know this is mine? You don't even know what's mine. You know, fucking Twat hid away from me. I don't know why. You know, I really, I like animals. You know, I really like animals and I enjoy doing things to the environment, but I don't like fucking people thinking they know shit about them even though she did in a way she did. But just because I drive a Prius, it doesn't mean I'm going to talk to you and your stupid sweatshirt and, and you know, sign up on your clipboard. I don't want to fucking do that, you know, because if I do at some point I got to listen to you use words like easy peasy. It's where I'm like this fucking type a psycho environmentalist and I just don't get along with those Bergen stock. It is. Ah, I'm just getting annoyed now. Just fucking talking. Hey tree is driver.

Speaker 4:          00:55:40       The thing I really want to say, I'm just not going to say it because it's just going to be to me. All right, let's get on with it. So anyway, so I drive it for you. So this guy sends me something about global warming. I don't know where he says bill. It's a, it's about 10 degrees in New York City now. And since you drive a Toyota Prius, I'm going to assume that you at least believe somewhat in global, global warming. And honestly with you being a great cynical comic, that shocks me. Okay. I like how we just did that. How he, uh, was patting me on the back as he backhanded me in the face. And honestly with you being a great comic, wow, there's, there goes my self esteem that shocks me black. Um, I hate when people fucking do that when they give you a nice compliment.

Speaker 4:          00:56:26       So you know, thinking like lean, you're going to come around it. Their opinion like I'm some little fucking dog and I just rolled over and now you're going to give me a fucking snack. All right. And honestly, you being a great comic, that shocks me. You have common sense enough, Jesus, he's just throwing out the compliments here. It's almost like he wants to change my opinion. You have common sense enough to realize things like self checkout lines being the beginning phases of teaching us how to do the job for free yet exclamation point. You don't spell any bullshit whatsoever on listening to a guy like Al Gore basically predicting some shit that he claims is going to happen 50 years from now. Now you know what? I love how at the beginning of this he realized that he doesn't know my opinions on global warming and he says, I'm going to assume that you at least somewhat belief.

Speaker 4:          00:57:18       And now two sentences later, I totally fucking believe in it until he can trash Al Gore. Anyways, he says, my logic, my logic just tells me that if anyone's going to tell me that they know what the world is going to be like a 2060, they're full of shit. Nobody knows that shit. Same as nobody knows what's going to happen to you when you die. Um, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. On and on and on. And he trashed this basically a my really gonna read out loud this long. Okay, let me just try to blow through this. Some 27 now. I vividly vividly recall plenty of people 20 years ago guaranteeing flying cars by the year 2000. Really? I don't remember that. Um, 20 years ago, you're seven years old, they will probably just fucking with you once they still telling you that effect. Fuck came down the chimney and gave you the toys.

Speaker 4:          00:58:12       Um, I vividly remember that when I was in the sandbox, somebody saying that there was going to be flying. Did you go to a private school or all your little friends running around in sport coats? Um, and the closest thing we have to occur that car instead of a close to we have that car is instead of running on gasoline, it runs on less gasoline and, um, and a battery and is 85% plastic. All right. First, before we get into all of this shit, one of my pet peeves about people who argue against global warming is when it's 10 degrees out in January, you know, January, a winter month when it's supposed to be fucking 10 degrees out, you know, the big, you know, all of a sudden it's, it's actually winter weather. And then they're just like, well, I just, that proves that. I mean it's, it's fucking 10 degrees in January.

Speaker 4:          00:59:05       There you go. So it was fucking 10 degrees in October, you know, for a bunch of days in a row for a bunch of years in a row. And polar ice caps weren't fucking mouth. The top of the world wasn't melting and grizzly bears weren't mating with polar bears, you know, then I would maybe believe your little point about one day in January being fucking 10 degrees or maybe a cold spell and it's called the winner. Dude. All right, you want to talk about vividly remembering. I remember vividly riding on my bicycle back when, uh, when kids delivered papers before they scared the shit out of us that everyone was a fucking pedophile. And before they printed billions of dollars more with no gold behind it. So now adults have to do that job. They were fucking kid like me riding around in that bicycle and it was so cold out. You fucking nostril stuck together and they used to give you those ski masks and your breadth would condensate or whatever the fucking word was.

Speaker 4:          01:00:10       And then you had hocked up against your nose. I've definitely remember my brother coming home, his hands were so cold. He turned on hot water in the sink and stuck them in there and they immediately all cracked and became bloody. And I laughed my ass off at Adam. I vividly remember that. It's called the fucking winter. All right, so don't send me a fucking email about a couple of days in January where it's 10 degrees out and you think that that fucking disproves would not look it. I don't, I don't, I don't even how to get in this fucking shit. The reason why we don't have fucking flying cars right now, I mean, think about that. 6 billion people all having cars that fly around. How the fuck are you going to have roads? You know what I mean? And the reason why you have Prius's that run half on gasoline and a little bit on electricity is cause it.

Speaker 4:          01:01:01       That's all bullshit. It's a fucking scam. All right? It's a better scan than the car that they have out now, but it's a fucking scam because you're dealing with, you're dealing with that robber baron blue blood money that has been running shit for 150 fucking years, and they're not just going to go, oh, they're the fucking cop of the world's melting. Well, let's do something about that. They're going to incrementally slide their way into something, they're going to do the least amount that's required. A hybrid is a complete fucking scam other than the emissions, you know, the admissions are a lot better. That's the big thing. But as far as the gas mileage and all that shit, it's bullshit. You basically get 45 miles a gallon if you're gliding down the street. But that's true with all cars. But the mere fact that corporations are actually giving in now and um, at the very least I love what they do is they basically paint their packages green and then psychologically like there's a gas station, I think it's BP.

Speaker 4:          01:02:03       All of a sudden they went to like green and yellow now and it's subtly, I'm supposed to have to be thinking about ethanol or some shit. Like wow, grasses grade carness yellow gas is good, it's stupid. The whole is Jackie, what you're dealing with dude is a ton of politics in there. So to sit there and, and look at it and you know, blast the guy like Al Gore. Yeah. Al Gore, you know, the guy, you know in defense of him has always been into the environment. One of his things when he was in office was he tried to get the Supercar, a car that got a hundred miles a gallon and they just dragged their feet. The big three dragged their feet and as a, you know, we're putting it together and there's a finite amount of time. Someone's in office, he was in office for eight years. They just dragged their feet for eight years and he was out and then they shelved it.

Speaker 4:          01:02:51       That's all. That's all that bullshit. But Al Gore, yeah, he's using it to try to get himself back in the ring. You know, he's like a comedian, you know, his show got canceled and now he's, he's doing infomercials. He's got to get his face out there so we can still make speeches and make some money so we can pay the fucking bankers. But Dude, you know, you really should do a little more research into a global warming other than it's 10 degrees out in January. That's all I'm going to say. And to sit there, and obviously I'm by no means a fucking scientist, but you know, I do know that you can't have 6 billion of any species on this planet, especially human beings who, unlike animals, we're the only ones, as my brother says, we're the only species on the planet that alters the environment rather than adapting to it.

Speaker 4:          01:03:45       You know what I mean? You could have 6 billion deer and that would fuck up a lot of shit, but not to the level that we're fucking it up because they don't make, you know, nuclear weapons and deal with the waste and plastic and all that shit. So I dunno dude. I mean, if I, I mean, I don't know what to tell you, dude. I'm not here to try to convince you that global warming, that 6 billion people on the planet are going to have an effect on it. You know, we're like the Gypsy moth caterpillar for right now, just eating everything in her fucking path and uh, none of this shit that they're doing hybrids, any of that shit is going to fucking help anything until they literally get on TV. And they start telling people to stop having children. Um, well that's uplifting bill.

Speaker 4:          01:04:36       I mean, I don't understand what people are fucking doing. Have you seen that IBM car shul or all of a sudden, you know, they're acting like, you know, they're talking about how in uh, oh, this is Joe to Rosa just called me and I missed the fucking call. Um, this IBM commercial, they sitting there talking about how like in Sweden or something that, uh, they installed a automated toll booths and that decreased gridlock by 20%. And then in the end, this girl's like, I'm an IBM or, and that's what I'm working on. It's like, really? Well, why don't you work on a digital poster that tells people to stop fucking busted nuts in their girlfriends? I think that that would help gridlock by, uh, a hundred percent kept clashing. Not 100%, but you know what I mean? Some point I can't wait. I hope I live long enough to see that.

Speaker 4:          01:05:25       I really want to see that argument where they somehow finesse in, you have to stop having kids because there's, there's no, there's no farmland. There's nothing left, you know what I'm saying? And then just all the Jesus freaks going while the bottle said, go for food is multiply. Lord said it. He said it really, it wasn't a bunch of people just writing it. No, he said it. He said it. And then he had a kid and a kid was in some woman who was never impregnated and he walked on water to cure a leper and he does a lot of Jews even though he was one. Oh my God. Hopefully you know something. I really am as cynical bastard tried. Definitely. I still believe in a higher power though. But like I gotta admit I'm lost because I don't know what, I can't go to any of these, uh, you know, from the Catholic Church to Scientology.

Speaker 4:          01:06:25       I just can't, you know, I can't fucking, I dunno. Do you have a look at a picture yourself from five years ago when you just think, you know, I was so much better a person then how do I get back to being that person? That's where I am in my life right now. You know, I'm trying to do, trying to do some better. I don't know what the fuck I'm talking about this week. All right, let's, let's, let's, let's move on here before I do my, I tell you guys, I'm doing that teen 90 x system for fucking 40 year old douche bags like me. It's actually great. It's a great system and I'm just killing time right now as I tried to get to the next point. Okay, here we go. Uh, how to link to my podcast. This is something else I should have done upfront.

Speaker 4:          01:07:04       Um, you log in, you log into Google with an account. Yes, I am reading this. Um, go to google.com/reader/view click on add as added at a subscription on the left hand side of the page. Oh my God. And then paste this in the box. I can't read that. That's like too much. All right. Evidently I can't tell you how to link to my podcast. All right, let's move on to the next fucking issue. I really loving how this is becoming like the morons meet the press, my podcasts, we're discussing issues like that last guy who I just screamed that he basically has no more information on global warming than I do. He just has his gut opinion that says it's bullshit. And I watched the discovery channel and I saw a brown and white bear, this grizzly polar bear that they called the piddly there because they're now meeting and fucking, and how do I know it exists?

Speaker 4:          01:07:59       Because some redneck shot, that's what happens. I don't know what the fuck it was all shot in the face and now I'm standing next to it. And then I went and I found a scientist. Do you know what the fuck this is? Whatever it is, I killed. All right. The checkout line argument is still continuing. All right? Some people, uh, I don't know if you're new to my podcast, I'm in front of bloat from my explanation. Um, and a lot of people love had been arguing with me that the automated checkouts, um, where they make the customer work as a cashier for free. There's somehow telling me that this is progress and they are equating it with great inventions of the past. I kinda got into it with some guy on the Internet where he was, I can't find the email because I'm disorganized. He brought up some sort of um, some sort of machine like a hundred or so 150 years ago that came out and the textile mills that would obviously do the work of like 10 20 people.

Speaker 4:          01:09:00       So this one guy started revolt going, this is all going to put us out of work. And Him and his friends came in and they attack the machines and all that type of shit and he tried to equate that with the cashier thing. And I'm not saying that I am against inventions straight across the board just because they put people out of work. Like to me that's not the same example because it's not like they came out with a new cashier machine that does the work of 10 cashiers while I just fucking stand there. They just came up with a new cashier machine that now I have to operate and then I have to bag my own groceries. That's not progress. That's making me do the fucking job. And actually to his credit, he goes, you know what? Fair enough. You are right on that because I'm not against them coming up with a machine that does the work at 10 textile mill workers.

Speaker 4:          01:09:56       I'm really not against that. And uh, because at no point does it then require me to go down to the factory in, so my own fucking shirt, that is my point. But despite that, people still have opinions that they like them. Here we go. Here's one. Um, what a fuck is it? God dammit, I can't find it. It was a great one. Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on. Just keep yourselves busy. Um, all right. You, you actually just fell into underrated. That's why I couldn't find it. Um, somebody will, you know what's underrated? Those self service tills at the grocery store, I'm going to assume you don't understand what it is, what it's like to not want to talk to someone about the effectiveness of the Maxi pad you're buying or if some hair conditioner really works, et Cetera. There is always a fucking conversation and it's always fucking annoying.

Speaker 4:          01:10:50       I feel bad that maybe someone might be out of a job because I don't like making a name conversation with other human beings. But Sundays being able to get in and out without speaking to anyone is all I really want. Uh, you know, I have mixed emotions on that one cause I understand not wanting to get into an annoying conversation like that fucking Douche bag with their green peace sweatshirt, you know, pay Prius driver. I understand that. But um, I would rather have an an a personally, I'd rather have an annoying conversation then know that I helped to put another foot on the yacht of some corporate fucking Douche bag because I just put another person out of, out of work who's probably already eating macaroni and cheese nine times a fucking week anyways. Um, all right. What else? Some other people, like some people agree, some people don't.

Speaker 4:          01:11:45       I think we've beaten this thing to death, you know, I don't know what to tell you guys. I just fuck it. I'll just get you, keep having kids. Keep, keep going with the computers, you know, line up for the microchip in your head. It's all going to be good. It's all great. It's all fucking great. Everything's great, everything's wonderful. Global warming doesn't exist. It's all awesome. Go see that new movie that that fucking crooked nose guy is in with Jennifer Aniston about the dogs. You know, take your fucking kids there who are going to add to the mess. You know, an SUV when they turned 16 Jesus Christ, I am on my soapbox is fucking week. I really need to shut the fuck up. Let's move on to the questions. All right. Whenever I get this way, by the way, people, I'm really not this passionate about the subjects.

Speaker 4:          01:12:35       That means I have other shit going on in my life that's causing me stress and I have an inability to focus on the thing that's causing me stress. So I rant about other stuff and annoyed the shit out of people. All right. Question number one. Hey, I think you'll like this one. That's how somebody just started it out and then for some reason I didn't erase that part. Um, there's a forward, oh, this is more of a story. And then I guess a question. All right. This is a four way intersection that I drive through on my way to work. A lot of people keep getting into car accidents there. Well for about a month I could tell they were installing a traffic lights, um, because they had tons of poles and wires and construction workers where they are all the time. Or when they finish installing the new traffic lights with the Green Arrows alliance, allowing people to turn and not get into accidents.

Speaker 4:          01:13:21       They also installed cameras looking in every direction. Am I crazy to be really bugged by that? I live in a small area about 30,000 people and they definitely could've told local residents with a letter that they'd be putting in cameras or something. If they can't afford a cop to watch the intersection, then they shouldn't have cameras there. Right. People will slow down for a comp, but nobody cares about a camera. It's not like they, it's not like that. We'll stop bad driving. It doesn't, it doesn't even end there. They put even more cameras towards the downtown area, so when I drive into work, I could be photographed or tape twice in a span of seven miles. Would this bug you too? Would you do anything about it too? Awesome questions? Yes, that would bug me. Would I do anything about it? I probably do what I do on this podcast. I'd sit in the bed and bitch about it and not join a group that would effectively try to make a change because they judge me because I drive a Prius.

Speaker 4:          01:14:20       Yeah, it does bug me. It does bug me. I think it's bullshit. I bugged me on two levels. It's a way for them to just, I guess, nail every single person who sorta sorta ran a red light and just give everybody a ticket so they can have even more money, you know, to, to just fucking give away to some Douche bag that they're going to pay eight bucks for a ham for. You know what I mean? I really can't explain anything today. What is wrong with me? You know what I'm saying? If I that's like some boss hog shit that's like putting down the fake fire hydrant. Um, yeah. I really find it disturbing that in the future I'm going to have absolutely no privacy. I mean, it's not like they're going to watch every second of footage, but just to know that at no point am I, you know, can I just like being my alone, that's what freaks me out about the future and going to let shit I was talking about last week while I was on, you know, watching 60 minutes and they're in the beginning stages of having computers have the ability to read someone's mind.

Speaker 4:          01:15:27       I mean, think about that shit. They're already putting microchips in, people at the upper corporate level. They'll love computers to be able to read your mind and there'll be able to film you every way you go. You know, it's like, that's to me is a, that's like all those science fiction fucking movies. Um, I dunno what I do anything about it. I, I, you know, the movie version of me would, and I would turn into a Ellen, uh, Erin Brockovich or whatever fucking name is, but uh, yeah. You know what would make me feel good? I'm one of those people, I don't start shit. I, I, I don't do anything. I don't join two. I joined shit too. I don't know. If it was a movement, I would definitely join it. I just hate how protesting has been. It's turned into like a cliche thing. Like if I actually went to a protest and I had a sign and I was chanting something that rhymes with four, you know, it always has to rhyme with four, one, two, three, four wheel Duggan more. No, no, no, no, no, no. Not a whore. Right. It always has to rhyme with four.

Speaker 4:          01:16:38       Why is it, you know why that is is because musically, all our, all our, all our music is in four, four time. That's like common time and we just kind of go with that rhythm like in the Far East like they play in like I dunno like that Vinnie Kali Uta time, like fucking 17 eight or whatever the fuck it is and they can all sit there and bounce and they have the patience to wait for the person to count up to 17 and with their crazy language they have words that Ryan was 1717 you're fucking in the hummus team or whatever the fuck the fuck. I don't know. Question number two. Here we go. Hey Bill. Was there ever a crossover period in your career where you were still working a day job but getting successful as a comedian? Did anyone ever recognize you at your day job sparking a Mickey Rourke temper Tantrum at which deli displays if anybody, if any, did you body slam?

Speaker 4:          01:17:46       Dude, what the fuck happened? The rest of that sentence. Did anyone ever recognize you at work? Sparking and Mickey Work? Temper tantrum. And then this is the rest of his sentence. At which Deli displays, if any, did you body slowed? Okay. Oh I know of. There was no comma in there. It should have been at, at which deli displays comma if any. I Dunno. I Dunno what they should be a comma in there cause I can't figure out what the fuck that means. That I have a body slam someone at a deli. Um, does anyone ever recognize me at my day job? Uh, no. I, I want to say maybe once and I was thrilled because I never got recognized and I felt like somebody, you know, which I think is very poignant on Martin Luther King Day. I am somebody I did five minutes at the comedy Ville comedy vault.

Speaker 4:          01:18:45       I used to go up and Dick Doherty's, comedy volt and Remington. And uh, it's actually one of the things I like to do when I go back to Boston. I'm not working, I go back to that club cause it's still fucking exist. So I put my first five minutes together on Boylston street. Um, yeah. So no, no one ever recognized me. You basically, you have to be, um, you have to be on TV for a long time to start getting recognized. Um, you know, it's weird, like you'd think if you did stand up on like a Conan O'brien the next day you walked down the street, if millions of people watching a bunch of people would recognize you, they don't, uh, they don't.

Speaker 4:          01:19:33       So you have to be, you gotta be super famous and then, or at least famous, and then you have to fall off and then have to get a day job and then they recognize you. It's weird. People recognize you on the back backside of fame, you know. And speaking of which, you know, being 40 years of age, um, I did what you're the responsible person supposed to do. You know, the May I fucking, when I actually got my God damn prostate checked and uh, got to tell you, dude, do you want to talk about the, that's the other side of fame that people don't bring up. I was really happy that I have a low level because when people look at same and they just think like, you know, court side seats to fucking the Lakers, you fucking a supermodel, they don't think that you still have to get your prostate checked and you don't have the ability to walk into the office as an an anonymous, an anonymous person, you know, thank God this guy wasn't a comedy fan.

Speaker 4:          01:20:37       So my prostate is fine by the way. You know, psychologically I don't know how I am after that. It was just fucking, it's horrific. And I gotta tell you something when they tell you there's nothing wrong with your prostate, you really have mixed emotions at that point. Cause you site that you're not going to die of ass cancer. But on the other side does immediately a jolt of anger where you like. So it's, so that means you really didn't fucking have to do that then did you? I don't know. I just came to peace with the fact that his job is just fucking horrific. Said for me. It's just a fucking horrible eight seconds. And then I can just, you know, turn on the radio at full volume and drive away and try to kill the thoughts of horror. Where is he has to then just because he has to just do that all day long.

Speaker 4:          01:21:33       Uh, you know something. I think the fact that I just talked about this on my podcast, I'm now emotionally fucking dealing with the fact that another man put his finger on my ass and he's just fucking, you know, and it's done very professionally. It's not like he's whispering in your ear like, you know, like this, it's not that, oh my God, I got to go to therapy. I still fucking horrible. I let another man do that. And there was nothing wrong with me. You know, Jesus Christ, Jesus Christ. I think this is the end of the podcast. I really, I really don't know how to process that. I really don't know how to process that. And you know, you know, it's funny, as you know, in five years they're going to have a way to do it where they don't have to do that. You know what I mean? Like, I just did the ass version of electroshock fucking treatment.

Speaker 4:          01:22:37       That is what they should do. They should put like a fucking Arrow in your mouth. You know, I don't think I'm going to be able to stop talking about this. It's just fucking horrific. Fucking horrific. Um, okay, let's grit the teeth and let's move on to question number three. Who, wow. Wow. All right. Yeah. What the fuck? All right. What if that's all a scam? Forget about global warming. Oh my God. Question number three. Come on bill. You can do it. You can do it. Hey Bill, do you ever think of how ironic it is that Hitler didn't have blonde hair and blue eyes? Um, no. No I didn't. I've heard that argument. I find it more weird that he was just a complete fucking spats and people followed him. I mean, he had the classic spazz haircut, you know, that's shorts stuff on the side and it's all long on top.

Speaker 4:          01:23:42       I mean that, I mean, if there's any kids listening to this shit, it's like if you really want to just up the chances of you getting fucking slapped in the back of the head, buzz the back of the size of the ahead and then leave it long on top and mean it's classic in naked head is just sitting there, which is just going to make a football player want to slap you with those three fingers right in the back of your head so he can watch your colic flap around on your forehead. Um, again, you know, I've heard that before. I've heard people talk about how Kettler didn't even fit into his, uh, his, um, his view of, of, of the perfect race. I think it was like a self hate. He was like a chick who was born or Brunette and always wanted to be a blonde.

Speaker 4:          01:24:28       You know, he just sort of bought into what he was like a self hating Brunette that somehow convinced people to kill like 10 million people. Um, you know, and I like to say that we've moved beyond that and in our society and you know, judging by people's reactions to fucking microchips and being filmed every five seconds and being like, well, you know, if you're not doing anything wrong, I really think that there's another Hitler and our future. Um, all right, bill number five. Hey Bill, what's the, uh, worst slash most embarrassing thing you've ever done to get laid? For me it was watching ballet. Um, all right, let's see here. The worst thing I ever did, I'll tell you the last most lost I've ever gotten in a relationship was I dated a girl who sang in a band and I was about 20, 21 years old and she was like 30, 31. And uh, she's saying in this band that was called, uh, I don't know what it was called.

Speaker 4:          01:25:33       Fuck was the name of the band. God, I'm so old now. What's a, what's a, what's a male? It was something in the girls was a guy's name, like Mike and Mike and the girls. And it was basically, they did like cover songs and there was three, three hotties, you know, like the Andrews sisters and they would sing fucking, you know, awful Bryan Adams songs and CNC music factory. Shit. This is how long ago it was. And then the dude would be playing the keyboard. And I sat in the audience with a Michael and the girls sweatshirt that was written in three different levels of pastel. You understand? Like it was like the Miami Vice Aqua blue, the hot pink and some other awful pastel color. You know what it look like? It looked like Demi Moore eye shadow and that famous eighties picture of her where she has her hair all crimped, whatever the fuck that was.

Speaker 4:          01:26:37       You know what girls used to do that and their hair used to look like a staircase descending down to the [inaudible]. Um, yeah. And I sat in the audience and I remember sitting outside myself going, how the fuck do I get out of this? How do I get out of this? This is not, uh, I was just psyched to be getting late. You know, I was definitely a late bloomer and I was banging on this hot broad, who's like 10 years old. I mean it's sang in a band and you know, that was all my Dick just going like, yeah, keep blowing me, I'll load a sweatshirt. And then I was actually in public by myself sitting in the crowd. And uh, that's one of those things where it was almost like, you know when you were in first grade and your mother gives, your mother, gives you the shirt your grandmother bought you and you're kind of thinking you back of the head.

Speaker 4:          01:27:25       You kind of haven't thoughts like, does this shirt like fucking gay? Is it, I don't know. You just, you know, and then you watch a cartoon and then you go to school and then all this, the second you get on the bus, it's just like everyone just starts, dude, what's with your shirt at? Then it starts and then you like, oh my God, this is going to be the longest fucking day of my life. And everybody just, I mean, you lose like half your friends that day and you contemplate kissing your pants so you can just fucking get out of school or are claiming you have chicken pox or anything just to get the fuck out of it. That was the adult version of that. And uh, I remember I walked out of the place where they had the Gig and I, and I went into a bar.

Speaker 4:          01:28:08       I was trying to reclaim my manhood, but I still had that fucking sweatshirt on. I think I took it off and I turned it inside out and I just drank at this bar for the rest of their show. And then I walked back, hammered and I, I think I turned it back in. And you know, I hate that part of my life. I really do. I don't even want to bring it up on, I resent that question. What a fucking Douche. Like now I just, I dunno, it's all part of the learning process. People. This is a really fucking becoming a dark podcast. I'm just admitting to horrible things that have happened to me. All right. Um, index, anal rape and an awful fucking sweatshirt. All right, question number six, Bill. Hey, what's the worst slash most embarrassing thing? Oh, I've already read that one. I'm so fucked up right now. Emotionally. I just reread that question. Wait a second. Oh, I have it down twice. So that wasn't me.

Speaker 4:          01:29:05       All right, let's move on to underrated, underrated, overrated. This is really, I like the awkward pauses at this point is I'm trying to fucking mentally deal with what the fuck happened to me last week. I really didn't emotionally even deal with that big deal. It's a medical procedure. You did the smart thing. I know I did the smart thing, but did it, I have to go through that process. All right, Bill. Um, my friend and I have a couple of ideas for you. Uh, all right. Overrated. Crown Royal Crown Royal is overrated. Okay. I can't agree with you on that one. I think it's fun tickets, tremendous underrated. Woodford reserve. Basil Hayden, four roses, single barrel. These obviously whiskeys were from Kentucky and a little biased. Oh, well fuck it. All right. Now I have to try those. You know, there's a bar in downtown la called the seven grand.

Speaker 4:          01:30:03       It's a whiskey bar. They have all kinds of, uh, I'm going to try that four roses, single barrel and actually sounds good. Um, overrated. All the damn spitting in pornos. What the fuck? Spitting and a-holes spitting in Vijay Ga's, spitting on the pain. I, when did hawking a Lougie becomes sexy. Yeah, that is pretty disgusting. I've actually sworn myself off of porno. Um, I was a big fan of, uh, this one website, which I'm not going to name just because I feel like a crack dealer because it's a free porno site and I don't want to put the name of it out there and get somebody else hooked. And, uh, I just, you know, I just decided I wasn't going to go on there anymore because I was finding shit that used to turn me on. I found it to be boring, you know, and then you start progressively moving towards sicker and sicker, crazier shit.

Speaker 4:          01:31:04       And I'm just like, I can't fucking do that. So I know I've mentioned on a number of times that, uh, I've been trying to fucking stop doing that. You know, you know something, I, I really, I really think that that shifts, it's just not good. It's just not good for you. You ever think about how fucked up that is? That you can just, you know, think of something that you want to see and you can go on the Internet and you can just find it. And how, back in the day when you were a, you know, little house on the prairie, I mean, all he ain't just had was your imagination. I'm not saying he, people didn't lay in the fields, lay down in the barley and take down their trousers and a a but, whoa, whoa. What, what could you possibly could people even comprehend?

Speaker 4:          01:32:03       You know, some of the shit that people have come up with at this point, I don't think you could. There's no way that you could think of some of the shit that they have on there. If like musically you're just that Jimmy cracked corn and I don't care. Actually, that's not true. They had Beethoven, they had classical music, but still, you know, I dunno. Like I said, I just looked at a picture of myself like from four or five years ago and I was just like, you know, I was a lot better person back then. So, uh, you know, this is actually been a very, a very sad melancholy fucking podcast and uh, yeah, that's it. I'm going to end on that. No, because I have to emotionally deal with the fact that a, yeah, I got to deal with that shift at whatever's in medical as a medical procedure. It doesn't count, right. Fuck. Anyways, so I'm going to hit the Improv in Houston this weekend. I want to be extra funny because I want to be burying that, uh, that procedure deep in my psyche. And I probably won't be talking about it on stage just because every comedian over 40 who's had that procedure then goes on stage and talks about it. It's all stared in there. Uh, I got the bug in Pega on, in my ass is hanging out.

Speaker 4:          01:33:31       You know who, who goes to school to become that guy, if any. That there's your homework for the week. If anybody can come up with a new standup comedy angle on, I had to get my prostate checked. Um, I'll give you a free DVD. I will literally fucking mail it to your fucking house and I'm not joking. All right. If you can somehow come up with a new angle, that's actually a no, you don't, I'm not going to put any parameters on it. They can go clean. You can go dirty, you can go clever. You can even be a guitar act if you want to write a song about it. I don't give a fuck if you can somehow come up with something. You know, you got a couple of days to this offer expires Thursday afternoon because by then I'm going to be on my way over to the club in, uh, in Houston, Texas.

Speaker 4:          01:34:24       Oh, speaking of which, you know what, I fucking, uh, you, one of the things I like going about to Houston as they got a mall out there that actually has a skating rink in the mall and it's the funniest thing ever. You can actually go ice skating right near the food court as you watch. In fact, Fox eating orange chicken and you're burning calories. And a actually when skating out here recently, I just hate going to the gym people. That's basically it sound like I can burn calories doing that. So I go out to Burbank, it's like 80 fucking degrees out and I go onto a skating rink out there. It's the worst fucking ice I've ever on it in my life. It's like the cracks in the ice. I mean it's, it's unbelievable. It's like Tiger Marcel Dion skated on this fucking ice back when the kings wore the colors of royalty.

Speaker 4:          01:35:14       And um, I get over there and there's literally like 15 other people out there and uh, I have a question for, uh, people who are Asian, not Indian people who are like, you know, Chinese, Japanese, Korean or whatever. Like, I'm really interested in your culture that, you know, it seems to me that like, I dunno, I just never see you guys get angry. You know, I'm sitting there, there was like five Asian dudes and they suck to get skating and they, and they just kept falling down like really hard. Like they be getting going fast and they would fucking roof really hit the ice hard. And every time they would get up smiling with like this self deprecating when I go, I was still bad. Look on their face and my, you know, and everybody else in that group or just sort of laugh and I just was fascinated.

Speaker 4:          01:36:13       I mean it's like I never saw maybe like an American version of an Asian person. You'll see, you'll see one of them go like fuck if they'd like stubbed their toe. But these like dudes are like whacking the heads and shit and they just kept smiling. And I'm not gonna lie to you. I was laughing my ass off. But then after a while it just became bizarre. And then I felt bad about myself. Like, what's wrong with me as a human being that I can't laugh off the little things in life, but you know to me once you fall for the 15th time, that's not a little thing anymore. That's like a major God damn problem. Then you should, you know mine's be that Stephen King Book were there was, there was the music guy and those I got dammit, I didn't close my fucking refrigerator. I hate when I do that. It's refrigerated. Such a piece of fucking shit.

Speaker 4:          01:37:05       Don't you know your frigerator you supposed to have to hold the door open and if you don't hold the door open, it's supposed to do this. Listen, it's supposed to close but not mine. Mine just stays open. Cut the shit and to global warming right there. I want to go to the fucking energy. I just wasted anyways. What the hell. I was talking about Asian people fallen on the ice and not in a, not, not caring. I don't know. It's just been a really weird podcast and I don't even know how I feel about it, but um, anyways, that's it. I'm done. I have to go work out. All right. You guys were a very patient with this one. Please keep the, uh, the questions and everything like that coming in. Please let me get the momentum going here. Please come out and see me at the Improv and Houston, please come out to that show.

Speaker 4:          01:37:55       Please. I'm begging people because every time I go there, you know, didn't like nobody shows up. And I know I said that about Tampa and people showed up. I don't know if cause I have a new special out, things are finally going to change, but, uh, please, for the love of God, show up. Bring 15 fucking people, you know, just, you know, I wrote a new hour. I'm literally begging you. Okay. Just for the love of God, I had a really rough week. I did violated. Okay. I've seen confusing things. I've seen a group of people fall on the ice and not get mad about it. And I left my refrigerator door open. Okay. And that's it. All right, that it come see me in Boston and in Utah and that's it. Right?
