Speaker 1:          00:00:01       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:00:01       Hey, what's going on? It's bill burn. It's the Monday morning podcast from Monday, March 19th, 2012

Speaker 3:          00:00:10       and like the line,

Speaker 2:          00:00:13       I'm fucking cold out here in Los Angeles. If you're wondering about the weather report yesterday, um, cold does not bug me unless I'm in Los Angeles. Then it bugs me, you know, from and Cleveland Farm in Boston. If I'm a New York, if I'm in Philly, I don't give a fuck if it's cold, I'll put on a park. Right? But when I'm out here in la, it really bothers me. It's just something annoying about being cold while looking at a palm tree. Just fucking bugs the shit out of me. So it doesn't make any sense, you know?

Speaker 1:          00:00:52       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:00:52       It's like seeing a skinny Santa Claus. It's like, what are you doing? I thought you were just supposed to be a tub of shit. How can you be jolly if you're in shape, if you haven't met a jolly skinny person? You know, there's, there's a certain level of being fat where you just find you just, I dunno, I don't know if you just psyched because you're eating cookies and you don't give a shit, but you can still tie your shoes. Like that's that level of fat you want to be at. Well, you're eating pizza and you're eating cookies and Yay, you have fat. But you know, you put on a sweater and you go, Whoa, Whoa, whoa. All right, you got rosy cheeks and nobody cares. Nobody's looking at you. Nobody's judging you. But then when you go beyond it, when you go beyond it is when your stomach comes out from under neath that sweater and everybody can see it. You know, but you can't see it, right? Cause you're so fat. And uh, even when the wind blows, you don't notice it because you're all warm with all that blubber. You know, there's that, there's a, there's a fucking, I don't know, there's this, there's a sweet spot of being fat.

Speaker 1:          00:01:57       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:01:58       Where, where no one's making funny being fat and you're eating, I'll shift food, but nobody's trashing you. So I guess it out. That's what makes you jolly, you know, oh, I get to eat all this shit food and nobody's judging me. Then once you go beyond it, then you start fucking crying. You know? I'm one of those reality shows I don't want, I'm talking about, I don't even want to be doing this podcast right now. I'm going to get, I'm not even lying. I'm only going to lie to you. I can't even spit it out and fucking exhausted. But I got a bunch of Shit to do tomorrow, which is today. By the time you listened to it, you know, I really don't feel like doing this shit. So it's going to be quick. I'm getting right to the fucking point. All right. I already solved why certain levels of fat people a jolly, you know right there. If you guys weren't so selfish, that could take up your whole fucking week. You know? But not yet.

Speaker 3:          00:02:50       You guys keep it coming.

Speaker 1:          00:02:53       Okay?

Speaker 2:          00:02:54       You like, I'm blaming you guys for this thing that I started. I just realized I even looked at it half of this fucking crap here. So what happened this week, Bill? What did you do this week, Willie? I, I, um, I didn't do any fucking standard. I think maybe I did stand up this week. I'm on vacation people, I'm still on vacation still on vacations. You guys sit there and you work putting in an honest day work, make it somebody else's dream come true. The dream evidently was to stick everybody in these little fucking cubicles. Everything would have fire hazard or cubicle is what if there's a fire in your little doorway, you know, there's no other way to get out. Where are you going to do? Shouldn't that be another doorway to the, to the cubicle next year? Do you have a little latter on the front of it? We climb up and over your terminal. Why are you still sitting in that fucking thing surrounded by plastic? They can't give you anything. How bout like, can they make your mouse may not have like wood or maybe some sort of precious metal to somehow act like they give a fuck about you on any level?

Speaker 4:          00:04:09       Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:04:10       Do you know why? I have a, uh, I live in this old house now, this old houses fucking old, this old houses, old wiring. This old house says fucked up plum in and Billy's got to pay for it. Eh, houses, got little garage and I got a big fat truck. And every time it is, I started saying, God damn, fuck, I can't fucking get it in the garage. So you know what I did the other day? I said, hey, who knows how to make garage doors wider. And I found somebody, I found somebody on, uh, make my garage doors wider.com and the person came over and they made my garage doors wider and I backed my fucking truck in there,

Speaker 4:          00:04:57       you know, fucking like butter.

Speaker 2:          00:05:01       So you guys don't have, listen to me bitch about that against an opposite and they go on, this is fucking great. You know, I can put my truck in there, I don't have to worry about it,

Speaker 4:          00:05:11       you know,

Speaker 2:          00:05:12       and there's no problems. So what do I do? I fucking jump in the Prius c of the day, you know, the ying and the Yang. I got the gas guzzler and I got the, Oh my God, it's like a tree kind of car. So I'm going to go down and watch some final four fucking action and would have a march madness, whatever you call it. And uh, you know, as you guys know, I'm not a big fan of basketball. I love the first 97% of it. It's that last 3% with the 58 timeouts and the fouls and the commercials. You know, I watched the game today. It was one of the worst sporting experiences I've ever had. I watched St Louis, uh, the Saint Louis fairies or something like that. There was some sort of a, the gremlins versus the, the Michigan.

Speaker 4:          00:06:00       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:06:00       Okay. 20 minutes. First half, 20 minutes. Second half. Okay. The first, I don't know, 38 minutes of the game or not even 37 minutes of the game. I don't know what to, it seemed like it took 90 minutes to play is flying. And I'm like, this is why I love college basketball as opposed to the excruciating, 48 minutes of NBA hoop. And then what happens to final fucking three minutes? I swear to God it took 50 minutes to play.

Speaker 4:          00:06:29       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:06:29       Jesus Christ, they're up by seven. It's over.

Speaker 5:          00:06:33       Wow. Wow.

Speaker 2:          00:06:35       That took 0.8 seconds off the clock goes little lied for a one. And what?

Speaker 4:          00:06:41       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:06:42       Fucking guy misses the ball. He throws it down. Right? Fucking files another guy. Right?

Speaker 4:          00:06:51       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:06:51       Fucking I, I had my shoes on. I'm trying to leave cause I gotta get my buddy a ride cause I got shit to do, but we want to see the end of the fucking game and I swear to God the final 45 seconds, it took like six minutes to play, 45 seconds.

Speaker 2:          00:07:07       And I know every once in a while somebody can hit that big shot and everybody goes, oh shit in a buffalo wild wings. Right? And then you slutty waitress comes over with a ref shirt tied off, you know, just done at the teddies cleavage showing, hey guys, how are ya? You want some more wings? Did we win? Yay. Stick the legal tender in my RFS, please. Right? I know every once in a while you have one of those things, right? But you know what, 99% of the time in basketball that doesn't happen. And you just sitting there letting six months, six minutes to your life, go by to watch 45 seconds of action,

Speaker 4:          00:07:50       you know,

Speaker 2:          00:07:52       I dunno. So anyways, so I go to a buddy's, my house buddy's house, a buddy of mine's house. There we go. It's actually an apartment. What do you have to exaggerate, bill? You don't, why you're trying to enhance your life. And I go fuck yourself. All right? So I drive over to his apartment, right? And he lives in this part of the city where there's no fucking parking. And I'm really trying not to lose my shit. I'm trying to control my temper.

Speaker 4:          00:08:18       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:08:18       Cause I don't want to be this guy. I really don't. I'd like to be that. I'd like to be jolly. I like to eat some pizzas, some cookies now my stomach hanging out underneath my sweater and nobody gives me shit about it. Right? Oh um, so

Speaker 4:          00:08:32       yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:08:33       What am I, so I get my fucking Prius and I drive down the road. I can't find the parking. So I say fuck it. You know I'm going to park at a meter. So I park at the meter and I reached into my little fucking console to get out my little Baggie, a quarters and oh and I forgot the not there cause that cunt broke my fucking window in my driveway, broke the window, my fucking car and stole a bag of quarters. We say good, this Dosha, right. And then I have to pay for the fucking window. So I pull up to the meter and I don't have a Goddamn, I don't have any quarters. I don't have any quarters. Sorry guy. Evidently I have to use my credit card. Something I don't like doing. I don't like using my credit card on a, you know, in a parking meter on a parking meter.

Speaker 2:          00:09:18       I don't like doing that because there's a record that I was there. Okay. Now I stick that thing in and that takes a lot of stuff off the table for me. Okay. I can't like get into a fight with somebody and he pulls a knife, we wrestle for it and he falls on it and dies. But I have no connection to him and you know, and I can't just fucking leave without getting caught. Right? I can't call somebody a cunt. This does. I mean, I can do all that stuff, but there's that, that the paper trail, he was there. No, I wasn't. Yes you were. We got your credit card. Well, I didn't call her a con. Why'd you lie about being there?

Speaker 2:          00:09:57       All right. Listen, am I being charged with anything? Because if I am, I want a lawyer. If not, I'm fucking leaving. All right? Remember that first 48 that's what you say. So anyways, so I've got to use the fucking credit card. So I use a credit card. All right? All I can get is two hours of time. There's an hour and something on the meters. So I'm trying to pave the 20 minutes. It's all fucking confusing. I gave them two hours of time for 20 minutes. So go on and walk in this guy's fucking apartment. I watched the Goddamn game, right? I'm thinking two hours is going to be enough. Timeout, timeout, file, file, file, time out, all that fucking bullshit. Right? But time I figured out what's going on. It's three and a half hours late and I'm like, God, Jesus Christ, you're an idiot. Bill. You've forgotten. You've parked at a fucking meter. You're going to have a ticket, right? And I come walk it down the street

Speaker 2:          00:10:45       and I'm walking up to my car. What do I see the fucking meter maid who's a guy pulls up. I still call them meter maids. Even if it's a guy, you know what kind of a fucking man does that job? I don't give a shit if it is a recession, go break into somebody's Prius to be a man about it, right? I see the fucking meter maid man pulls up and right as I'm there and I'm laughing my ass off going, you gotta be fucking kidding me. I got away with it and I jumped in my Prius and I drive away. Wa Ha ha. Laughing my ass off. Call up my buddy gay wouldn't believe it. I got there, right. It's a fucking blah, blah, blah. Yeah, you had to be there, right? I'm all thinking this is the fucking greatest story ever. All right. Put My car in the fucking driveway. I don't know what I did after that. Came inside at a couple of whiskeys and I yelled at everyone in the House that I love, you know, typical evening for me. So the next morning I wake up and I looked at the side of my car and evidently somebody hit hit my fucking car. I'm driving away last night, you know, I'm driving away thinking, oh, look at me. I've got to wait from the fucking meeting maybe. And somebody caved in the entire side of my fucking car.

Speaker 6:          00:11:52       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:11:53       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:11:54       I don't know what it is about. My Prius has just fucking, every fucking three days, somebody smashes into it. I just can't keep the dead side of it. You know? I'm not one of these douchebags who gets a fucking car and when something breaks you just say fuck it. You leave it that way. And next thing you know, you look like Lamont drive it over to Fred Sanford House. I'm not going out like that. Even if it is a Prius, I'm keeping it nice. All right. I get the fucking thing detailed. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:12:16       I don't give a shit. I get to fucking interior shampooed I keep it nice. Not riving around some, you know, sorry. Bad enough. I'm driving around on something that it has bicycle tires on top of that and have fucking Denson it all right. I've got an image here of people I'm trying to keep up. Ah, Christ. I'm so fucking tired right now. I don't want to do this. God Damn, I didn't, what the fuck I'm talking. What am I talking about? That's how you guys are.

And uh, she's fucking awesome. God Damn Rock Star. You know, it's kind of a cabaret thing was she would sing songs and that type of stuff. You know, and I think I was the only straight guy. They're under the age of 45. But I loved it. I actually wished that she would do more standup. She was fucking hilarious and a, I don't know, she was just, I don't know, that perfect kind of just not giving a fuck. Just an absolute beast. I've always been a huge fan of hers and uh, so if you get a chance to see her, I definitely fucking recommend it.

Speaker 2:          00:17:26       oh Jesus. So anyways, I live in this old ass house. All right. And uh, whoever lived here before, I don't think it's the people right before the people, for them, people for them. This is a great old house. And the great thing about having an old houses, they have these old fixtures, doorhandles hinges, other handles, you know, would carbons, all that type of stuff. That makes the thing unique. You know what the worst is, is when somebody lives in the house before you and they don't fucking appreciate it. And what they do is they take all those wonderful features. They take 'em out and they go down to home depot and they buy some plastic hunk of shit. And he used that as a God damn door handle. Well, you know what, that's not how I roll.

Speaker 2:          00:18:13       Am I really going to talk about brass door handles at this point? Is that how far the fucking podcast is? Com. I got a fucking door handle. It's made out of brass and it has 90 years of Schmutz on it. Okay. Fatty Arbuckle banged a whore up against it probably sometime in the early thirties and that what's from that horse? Twat is still on the door handle. Okay. And I went out and bought myself a little fucking kid and I'm trying to Polish that thing today. And I realized how annoying it must have been to work for rich people back in the day. We had to polish up their candelabra has in their fucking spoons in it. Tea Cups. Oh my God. I would fucking rub my balls on all their fucking forks and everything before I put them in the drawer. And there's no way these people didn't do that.

Speaker 2:          00:19:04       There is nothing more annoying. And I know these people back in the day had no idea what an iPad was. You know, they had no idea what it'd be like to have live streaming porn on some little fucking plastic box right on that table where they could rub one out whenever they wanted to. I realized it was a simple time, you know, back in the day, like an apple was a dessert, at least according to my research, it was, remember that back in the day he'd watched those Tom Sawyer movies and they'd be, hey, whitewash my fence and I'll give you an apple boy. Oh boy, you're fucking apple kid. Couldn't believe it. I don't understand. You figured. Then there was a whole bunch of apple trees all around. Why don't you go climb went up, you'd dumped. Fuck, you wouldn't have to paint the fence. It's you really thought about it. But then again, he was an orphan. It wasn't Tom Sawyer and orphaned was the huck Finn. I don't fucking know. What am I talking about? Anyways, to be back in the day, just have to sit there and shine up all these fucking rich people's bullshit. You know, I bought this you that you can't afford, make it even Shinier and you've got to sit there doing that. You know the same motion over and over again. The fucking your knuckles swelling up, right?

Speaker 2:          00:20:16       Just sitting there, you know going and I always to, I always want to drive a stage coach. And that dream just never happened for you and that you are your whole fucking life. You got to sit there and shine spoons, not wash them. You got to wash them and then he got a fucking shine him up. Let me tell you something. I fuck with this brass door handle for about 20 minutes. And I was like, you know what? Fuck this. No, I didn't. I went on Youtube and actually looked up how to shine a breast fucking door. So now I'm going down to the fucking hardware store in tomorrow and I'm going to get some fucking low grade or high grade fucking Sos pad and I'm going to do that with a little toothbrush tomorrow. Shine this son of a bitch up

Speaker 2:          00:20:57       and somehow I feel like it's going to fill the void. Oh God. Can you guys fill me slowly going crazy. Um, well if you can, I don't give a fuck a YG. If he been wondering, you know, I've realized that full ever. I haven't even told you guys how to email me. Um, it's bill at the [inaudible] podcast.com. All right, bill at, that's the, the a with the circle around it. Like Walt Disney drew it right. bill@thempodcast.com. Okay. I said it three times. If you can't figure it out, go fuck yourself.

Hang on. Yeah, that's it. That's what happened. That's how that ended.

Speaker 2:          00:22:25       All right. I'm back. One less moth in the house trying to eat my fucking sweat. The mothballs work or let's like ice cubes in the drink of moths. Do they? Cause I swear to God, I got it. I got mothballs all over the fucking place and he's got, it's, I think that throwing them in a high ball glass as they fucking shout out my turtlenecks. Um, I dressed like Dick Cavett. Now did I tell you guys that anyways, the contact link@thetopofbillbillboarddotcomisabillatthemandpodcast.com or billboard.com/contact. Send me an email. You know, let me know you listen and do it. Don't do it. Who gives a fuck? Do you even give a fuck at this point? I think a lot of my listeners right now are just sitting with their hands. They head on their hand, just staring off into space. And I gotta be honest with you. That's exactly how I feel.

Speaker 2:          00:23:19       I just don't have time to do this tomorrow morning. So I'm doing it right now. You know what I mean? It's Kinda of like when you're building a toy for your kid, you don't really want to do it. You know, you just plowing through it. You're not even thinking about the joy is going to have you just trying to get to step eight. We could just finish this whole fucking thing. Um, you know, last week I brought up, uh, the different types of cock blocks. Last week I brought up the announcer that who can cock block you from across the room. Second, he sees something happening.

Speaker 7:          00:23:49       Hey, what's going on?

Speaker 2:          00:23:54       All right. That guy, you know that he goes slowly slide your hand back down to thigh, back from out from underneath the dress. You know, you just, you just felt we have a good time. So it was another type of cock block. Evidently this person named the double oh seven. This is the friend of the girl you're trying to hook up with or who acts like she's in diff and acts like she's indifferent about heading back to your PR or what this the friend of the girl you're trying to hook up with who acts like she's indifferent about heading back to your place or staying at the party but is secretly texting 1000 reasons to her friend as to why they should get the fuck out of there. Oh that's the worst. That's right. Why don't you just man up and say I don't want to bang you. I'm leaving. Um, so anyways, just cause she's not getting any attention.

Speaker 6:          00:24:43       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:24:44       She's always got some stupid passive aggressive look on her face as she's texting and going on about why they got to get to Mickey's cause everyone's there. Mikey's cause every once there. Yeah. It's always, you know, is there anything worse than the, you know, it's something, what do you think is worse? The Guy, your buddy cock block on you or the ugly friend of the hot girl? You Know Martha. That's cow.

Speaker 6:          00:25:10       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:25:11       You know what, I wish I did back in the day.

Speaker 6:          00:25:14       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:25:15       Because I always tried to ignore that person and just keep working on the other girl. Even though I wanted to tell the the the fucking ugly one to go fuck herself. It's always killed me that I never did because it never worked out. One set girls marathon. Come on, let's go.

Speaker 6:          00:25:33       Okay,

Speaker 2:          00:25:34       Marissa, you've had too much to drink like that one. Like I just wished, just one time I just said, I'm sorry. No one wants to fuck you. Sorry. You're athlete. We're going your personality. Right. I might as well have done that because once that fucking God damn, I Dunno what something big and hairy. Abominable Snowman. Big Foot. I don't. What if I was fucking nuts? So sleepy. I would have had something funny there. You know, once she starts fucking yell and Marissa Girl's not going to bang you.

Speaker 6:          00:26:07       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:26:08       You know what I mean? Shane's snack a bag. Well, maybe you should just lean into Marissa just to be like, Hey, let me ask you a question. Why do you hang out with such ugly women? You know? Well, what's your deal? What are you insecure or something? I can't say. What are your insecurity? You got to keep it about the other one. Do you have any good looking friends? Just something. Just something so you can go down swinging.

Speaker 6:          00:26:31       Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:26:32       I have no idea. Why am I excited about the baseball season start? I haven't watched baseball since David Ortiz flunked some tests and I, so it was like, you know what? Fuck this. For some reason I'm excited about baseball.

Speaker 1:          00:26:45       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:26:46       I don't know why that is. Well bill, we don't know either. Can you figure it out? Can you say something funny about it? Are you just gonna just leave it out there? All right. This guy wants money. Advice. Jesus Christ. There's no way I'm making an hour. This is 27 minutes in and I'm flailing. Absolutely flailing. Um, so the damp towel, um, which rocky was that? What was the one was that, that was the one where Apollo creed got fucking killed by the Russian. I must break you right. Those cheap bastards. Um, money advice bill. I'm an Otr truck driver. What the fuck is that off track?

Speaker 1:          00:27:34       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:27:34       Betting. What does that o t I don't know what that is. All right, I'll take your word for it. I'm an Otr truck driver and have a problem with blowing fucking money like a politician. I have a wonderful fiance with a great head on her shoulders and she is great with money. Uh, every time I see the bank statements, the balance is more and more so I know she's doing a bang up job with our finances. Well, let me tell you something, sir. You are one perceptive son of a bitch. Um, Casein, another beggar. And I know that that must be a good thing. Um, so what's the fucking problem you say? Well, like I said, I'm terrible with money, so I got one of them. I got one of them prepaid debit cards. He literally wrote one of them. I liked this guy, talks like Elvis and every Tuesday payday, my girl puts $50 on there so I can get groceries.

Speaker 2:          00:28:30       That way I don't turn into one of these fat shifts that eats every meal out out of the Wendy's, out of the Wendy's. Ah, God, this guy is great. He's man and Dan loaded up at truck. We go and do what they say can't be done. We're gonna get some hookers at the next truck stop. We ain't can wear condoms and shoot some drugs and we'll all get fuckin aids and pass it all around. Um, well, $50 is good for one week of groceries, but it's like pulling fucking and teeth for extra money. Lock safe for drinks or some rubbers now like for drinks or some extra curriculars. Am I an asshole for thinking I deserve a few extra bucks or what the fuck bill, by the way, Nia has a sexy fucking voice and go fuck yourself. Um, are you an asshole for thinking you deserve a few work? Starbucks? Absolutely. The fact that that poor woman is legally bound to you and you, you have no concept of how to hold on to money, that would be like, I mean, you're a guy like you're supposed to fucking earn a living to support a family, right?

Speaker 2:          00:29:42       If you have no concept of that, that would be like if she had no concept of like how to have a baby or how to blow somebody's, you know what I mean? Cause that's what their job is. Sucking Dick and make it idiot.

Speaker 4:          00:30:00       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:30:01       Ah, God measured my end of the balls to run for president after doing this podcast for five years. How, how easy would it be to take me down?

Speaker 4:          00:30:12       MMM.

Speaker 2:          00:30:15       Do. Why don't you learn about money? Do you really just want to float around like with your fucking eyes wide open, just not getting it and don't you want to understand money? She's given you 50 bucks a week. You know why cause you to fucking stupid. He gets 60 and I'm sure you can crawl under a truck and modify it. I'm not saying you straight across the board dumb but to not to not to understand money. It's, I swear to God dude is one of the dumbest things you honestly, and this is for everybody. It's one of the dumbest things you could ever do in life is I understand not understanding money up to about 1819 but once you're to the point where you can go to a library, we can go on the Internet and you can just just read up on it,

Speaker 4:          00:31:00       okay?

Speaker 2:          00:31:02       You don't understand money. You're going to be behind the eight ball for your entire fucking life and you're basically going to be an indentured servant to credit card companies and banks and your life is going to suck way more than it needs to. Okay? I'm not saying that just because you understand money. When he a kid, these isn't going to shit the bed. Bad Shit's already going to happen. You don't need to compound it with not understanding money.

Speaker 4:          00:31:26       All right,

Speaker 2:          00:31:29       this woman is the best thing that ever fucking happened to you. You don't understand money and you want monit for drinks and some extra curriculars. What does that mean? An eight ball? If you start with drinks and then you say, I like how safe or drinks or some extra curriculars like boozing to you isn't even an extra curricular activity. That's just, you know,

Speaker 2:          00:31:52       let's like nourishment few. So I'm, I'm assuming that extra curriculars is at least a bag of weed or maybe some condoms to bank some trucker whore, truck stop whore, you know? Listen sir, you got a great fucking woman, but she's only gonna put up with you not understanding money for so long because at some point she's going to want a god damn man. Okay. Especially once you have a couple of kids, she doesn't need you being some adult kids. So I would say read up on money and you'd understand what a favor she's doing for you. If you, if your bank balance is going up, you're doing better than 90% of the people out there. All right? So here's a good thing. You got to fucking angel and she's smart and just read up on money. All right? She's also keeping in shape. Go buy groceries. Don't become a tub of shit. You know, she's basically without you even realizing or possibly even her, she's laying down the gauntlet here. She's basically saying in her own cute way. I don't want to be married to some fat broke trucker. All right, so read up on money. Keep eating your fucking pears and fruit out there and a and you'll be fine.

Speaker 2:          00:33:04       All righty. There you go. Alright. Hyphenating name a bill. My girl was thinking about hype, uh, of

Speaker 2:          00:33:13       hyphenating. Did I say hyperventilating earlier? I can't even remember. Five seconds ago. I'm this sleepy. My girl was thinking of hyphenating her name when we get married. I'm not some archaic, Patriarchal Nutcase, but I think the whole concept is absolutely ridiculous for one reason. First of all, I love that. If you, if you even disagree with some fucking horseshit a woman's going to do at this point, you always have to say, no, I'm not some caveman, um, sort of use goes. I think it's absolutely ridiculous. For one reason. Say we have a daughter and our daughter wants to be like mommy and get her name hyphenated. Then she will have three names. If she has a daughter does the same thing, she will have four names. Absolutely ridiculous. Your thoughts? Yeah. I would say that women hyphenating their last names is basically the same as that's like their prenup, you know, so they can just drop you off. You know, if you get divorced, they can just sort of chop you off like an appendix, you know, like you're this thing that isn't really necessary, but for some reasons it's still there, but you can live without it, you know? Um, look, she's either marrying you or she isn't.

Speaker 2:          00:34:30       Okay. Cause I gotta be honest with you when I'm on the road in some married woman with a hyphenated name comes up to me. I think I'm 50% in the game. Hey, I'm not fucking Sarah and Russell. I'm just trying to fuck Sarah. Anne, why don't you drop the Russell to not baby? No, I'm just fucking with you. What do I think about that? Um,

Speaker 1:          00:34:53       yeah,

Speaker 2:          00:34:55       I dunno. A woman with a hyphenated last name to me that's a red flag. That's a red flag that says to me that she does want a husband. She wants a wife. Uh, she's going to be a terrible mother and she's going to focus on her career. That's what I think. But then again, I'm ignorant. You know, what are you gonna be [inaudible] Zimbalist Jr. What does a good fucking hyphenated name doesn't? That chick who, uh, that raven haired beauty. Who married Michael Douglas? Isn't her name? Like a from Zito Jones. Catherine Zeta Jones Douglas. Is that how she has it? She just kept her last name. Look at me and Nia ever get fucking

Speaker 6:          00:35:38       marriage. She goes, I don't want to take your last name or I want to hyphenate it. I'd be like, you know, it just, you know, don't fucking, you know, don't, don't, don't pander to me here. All right.

Speaker 2:          00:35:50       I, you just either you're fucking taking my name where you're not, you're not doing this fucking hyphenated shit. Give your own last name. I don't give a fuck, but our kids are going to have my last name because I'm the God damn man and I'm stronger than you. That's how it's going down. I gotta be honest with you. I don't, that hyphenated name thing is fucking weird to me. I think you should either just be like, look, I'm not taking your, your last name. And it just be done with it. Or the hyphenated name is, uh, you know, I noticed that a lot of chicks, uh, on, on Facebook do that so they can get in touch with guys. They used to bang back in high school and college so he can still be found, you know, that's what I think. There you go. I think she's got a wild streak in her. I don't think she's ready to settle down. She doesn't want that barn door to close. She'll go into the bomb. Don't close that door. She's going to start kicking, um, advice. Hey Bill, I need some advice. Oh, I didn't give you any way. What do you think about it? Yeah, I think it is fucking ridiculous.

Speaker 2:          00:36:51       All right. Just say, look, if I'm going to pay for your fucking life, who's kidding? Who? That's what's going to happen. You got to pay for it one way or another. You are going to pay for it. You're gonna have most of the fucking financial responsibilities and you're going to die before she does. That's basically how it goes, you know? Can you at least just take my fucking last name and act like you're with me. Fucking unappreciative son of a bitch. Advice a bill. I need some advice badly. Uh, I got a fucking delicate situation I'm working with and I'm not sure how to handle it. I swear to God this is how this guy's writing. I like, it's very conversational. A little pertinent. Uh, first I'm 20, I'm a 20 year old living with my parents. My 21st is the 20th. It's like a math problem for train leaves at 20 in the 21st is on the 20th. Um, mid April. I plan on getting a vasectomy. I do not want advice about this. Well, you're going to get judged. What are you low? You will those population people.

Speaker 2:          00:38:00       I haven't gotten laid in about a year and a half story. Last Friday the ninth, there was a party at a friend's house. Kelly's, her parents were out of town and she was a senior and Ah, what did I say? Her name is she of age. Everyone was drinking lots of fun parties winding down and we go upstairs. Saturday morning, I woke up in her bed, we go to breakfast, had a real nice time. Saturday night, I go over no party, just great sex. I suggest a new position. She loses her mind, says it was the best sex of her life. It's a great story so far. What could go wrong? As we're cuddling, falling asleep Saturday into Sunday, I casually suggest that we should never date and she completely agrees. Oh my God, this girl's a fucking angel. What could go wrong? Right back step a little bit. I broke up with my very unserious girlfriend and also a senior at the same high school about two or three weeks ago saying, I want a more serious relationship. Completely true. Uh, the fucking challenges. Should I try and keep this thing going or quit while I'm ahead? Uh, the only potential downside is if word gets out. It would put a lot of strain on the relationship with one of my extremely good friends. Also, my ex best friend are, I see a bang in your x best friend's girlfriend.

Speaker 2:          00:39:28       Uh, do I need to read the rest of this? Yeah. Quit while you're ahead, dude, unless you don't give a shit about your best friend. MMM, yeah. That's what I would do. I would get the fuck out. Let me, let me reread that again in case I messed. Messed it up. Sorry. I'm fucking half asleep here. The only potential downside is if word gets out. He'll put a lot of Susan as a, with one of my extremely good friends. Also, my ex ex, his best friend.

Speaker 2:          00:40:01       Dude, I can't do the math on that. I'm too fucking tired. Itchy. I you obviously, you're basically, as far as I can tell, there's a cocktail party right around the corner and you're on just the other side of the wall banging the bosses. Girl says something going on it yet, Dude. Get the fuck out. Pull the ripcord. You banged her. It was great. You're young. It's going to be another Ra that there's going to be others. Don't worry about it. All right. All I can tell you this. Don't get a vasectomy so you don't have to wear a condom. Wear a condom. All right. Definitely do that. You don't need that shit. All right. You don't need any of that shit that comes along with dead fucking level. Christ, what do we have two guys? Can I tap out early? You guys ever go sick early on a Friday. You go home, I a tummy ache. I want to go home. Right? And then you go down to the local bar and you start fucking drinking, right? Then all of a sudden, some girl in a gene fucking skirt starts dance a little provocatively and next thing you know, yell and college. Boy, you're next, right?

Speaker 2:          00:41:00       Um, God Lord, was that an accused? Yes, it was a Bon Jovi car. Everybody. I'm blown. Hey, you know what? I think it's time for advertising.

Um, here's something that's really been doing well. The skate fenders, people are buying them. People are sending me emails telling me they're loving him. Tell him to taking pucks in their foot and they can barely even feel, feel it. Um, go to escape fenner.com and type in the Promotional Code Bill Burr, all lowercase. No, uh, no space for $5 off scape fenders. I highly recommend them. I'm playing hockey tomorrow night. I'm putting them on and I'm going to be a shot block and motherfucker cause I got protection on my feet.

Speaker 2:          00:43:48       Skate fender.com. All right, there you go. That's it for those. That's it for those. And Oh hey, do you see this shit? Did you see this shit about the fucking guy who's got the, you know, he went over to, he went over to Uganda, that Guy Kony Kony 2012. You see that? You see how quickly they brought that guy down? This guy's shines a light on the, uh, on himself first and foremost, and how he and his child or dealing with it, which was really bizarre. I mean, I don't know about you guys, but it was enough for me to see the boy soldier crying cause he saw his brother have his next sliced right in front of him, you know, and he goes from that to be a, now I'm going to sit my son down and tell him about the, it's like, Whoa, I didn't even get it. All right.

Speaker 2:          00:44:42       So anyways, this guy shines a light on this bullshit that's going on over there and all of a sudden everybody's in an uproar of a sudden. Everybody gives a fuck about Uganda and these boys soldiers, you know? Then all of a sudden the United States government is going to do with fighting two wars. We can't even afford to fight one. Now this guy's bringing this shit up. Gee, wouldn't it be nice if something fucking happened that would discredit him? Next thing you know, a couple of days later, a, this guy connected with the film from Dec Kony 2012 gets caught jerking off in public. Was I the only guy who found that unbelievably fucking convenient? I didn't buy it for a second. In fact, I tweeted, you know, back in the day, they used to assassinate you. Now they just do this. You know what I mean? If they can make it look like we landed on the moon in 1969, you don't think that they can make you anybody they want make it look like you're rubbing one out in the fucking parking lot. I don't buy it.

Speaker 1:          00:45:36       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:45:36       What that fucking Douche bag was doing, not douche bag. That fucking self-serving. Cont there we go. That's what I was trying to say. What he was doing with that film was he was putting pressure on the United States to go over there and fucking somehow insert themselves into that situation, which would have cost a ton of fucking money, you know? But there's no way to be like, hey, fuck those boys soldiers, you know, because of the, uh, the way the coop, because of what it says in our pamphlet, you know, give a shit or your week, give us your poor and will exploit the shit out of them and uh, let him die of tuberculosis in a damp apartment. And then years later, whoever made the most amount of money gets a statue made out of them. That's all in our thing. So we can't look the other way with these fucking boy soldiers. So what's easiest thing to do? Just just make that guy look like a freak show.

Speaker 1:          00:46:30       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:46:30       First of all, who hasn't jerked off in a parking lot? Honestly? You know who hasn't done that? You know, you fucking girl goes in to change something. You sit in there, your board, you can't get any radio reception cause you know, it's back in the day. He just say, yeah, I'm bored. Right? He got a girl in your life. So you know, there's gonna be some sort of Napkins in the car. What are you going to dope? Right? You got the captain's chairs? No one could see ya.

Speaker 1:          00:47:00       Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:47:00       Oh, this is taking forever. Hey, what if I rub one out, right? Yeah. Everybody's got a fucking camera. You know, you know what's amazing is that everybody hasn't got caught jerking off in public at this point. Everybody's got a camera in their, uh, their cell phone. What I'm trying to say people is I don't buy it and it doesn't matter. I don't give a fuck whether the guy from Coney was jerking off in a parking lot or not. That doesn't change whether or not this boy soldiers in Uganda. But what's great is, is then the conversation switches from what's going on over there to low let's this guide Dylan, he's he rubbing his deck like we all do and then everybody would be like, yeah, but we don't do it in public out. So what that makes you better. It doesn't make you better. It just makes you more considerate, doesn't it? I mean if you had two people and they were both shooting heroin and one person had the decency to do it in their house and the other person does it out in public, at the end of the day, you both drug addicts. So if you're really going to sit there and shit on this guy for jerking off, then you would have to basically be not jerking off

Speaker 4:          00:48:12       at all. Right.

Speaker 2:          00:48:16       Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, I'm asking you to look into your hearts. If you have not rubbed one out, let he who is not rubbed one out in some sort of pump. No, you'd have a jerked off at work. God, I'm fucking bored. Excuse me, let me go to the bathroom. Maybe they think I'm taking a shit standing up. Right. Come on. If you're a guy in your arms along enough, at some point you've jerked off in some place where you shouldn't have. You jerked off to somebody you shouldn't have. You've done it. We've all been there. Who gives a fuck? There's still boys fighting in wars over this. So you know, if you want to help out, help out. If you don't, don't, but don't let some guy rubbing one out in a parking lot. Change your mind either way.

Speaker 2:          00:49:11       You know what they're doing right now that doing what women do when they argue when they start to lose is they bring up other shit and they spin it into a different room. And next thing you know, you're arguing a whole different argument and argument that they wanted you to fucking argue. So they knew that they could win rather than keeping the argument on fucking track of saying, listen sweetheart, I don't like the way you fucking been dressing lately. Okay? I gotten this relationship to treat you like a piece of fucking meat. All right? And lately you've been slacking off. Oh God. Let me adjust my weight. Maybe the funnies on this side of the couch. Um, what else? What do we got here? Come on bill. You got another 11 minutes? Huh? You know, I feel like right now, like if I was in the tort of fraud, I would actually, I would be in the Pyrenees right now. All right. And My podcast is that one bald motherfucker with the bracelet. And he just looked back at me to see all I'm doing. He seen my fucking mouth hanging open and now he's going into fucking second gear and I'm going to lose this stage. Okay. Except the Lance Armstrong is my fucking podcast this week. If he didn't get the metaphor, was that a metaphor? It wasn't as similarly similarly is like her as right.

Speaker 2:          00:50:35       My podcast is like, I always want to say Greg Lamont. What a Douche that guy is. Greg Lamont. I still can't get over how he talks trash about Lance fucking, uh, all worth whatever the fuck his name is. What does it lance, what went lance Whitaker, you only won seven bike races. Bill. What the fuck you've ever done? Did I ever even win a bike race in my childhood? You know, I try to beat my brother one time in a bike race and that mother fucker always beat me because he had big legs, you know, and I had little legs, little bitchy lakes, and our driveway was a hill. And so we don't, and we lived on this busy street, so we'd always have to fucking stop and then, you know, look both ways and then cross the fucking streets. So from a dead stop, I can have a good, I could have a beat this son of a bitch.

Speaker 2:          00:51:25       So one day we'll race and home and I come up with a brilliant fucking idea. I'm like in second grade, I know what I'll cross while we're racing. When he goes to stop, I'll be all we going up the driveway and I'll get to beat him and his fucking Bo Jackson thighs right up the goddamn driveway. And uh, I swear to God, I turned around and I looked, evidently I didn't look well enough and I fucking pulled out right in front of a, a jeep and all I heard was boom, right. Next thing you know, I'm fucking upside down.

Speaker 1:          00:51:59       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:51:59       And I vaguely remember seeing the bumper and feeling the heat of the engine at. Uh, and then like, I dunno, like two seconds later I was open my eyes and I was laying across the yellow double line on the road. I was out for like literally like fucking five seconds long because by the time I stood up to get out of the street, the guy in the jeep had already got out this big son of a bitch and he was crying

Speaker 2:          00:52:30       and he came up and he's like, I'll buy a new bike. My bike was all mangled and all I was thinking was my dad's going to fucking kill me for fucking up my bike because that's how it was in the 70s. All right. I know if that happened to a kid nowadays, my parents would have sued the guy in the jeep for everything he was fucking worth. And then bought me a bicycle made out of gold and that guy's four o one k plan. Right? But this was the 70s people didn't sue. People yelled at kids for being dumb when they did dumb shit. So I was like, oh my God, they're going to fucking kill me and my bike's all fucking mangled. And um, then I went to the hospital, we'll taxi cab. I told this story before. I remember that I told you I got hit right on the side of the fucking head.

Speaker 2:          00:53:16       It happened on a Wednesday. I remember it happened on a Wednesday because then I didn't have to go to school. The Guy said he has to go to school for the rest of the week. So I've got Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday off and all was fucked up about me, was on the side of my head. Puts you, put your fingers on the side of, get your temples right now, right. And bite down on your molars. You doing that already know you feel that little thing that goes in and out. That's right where I got hit. So it hurt to chew. So for four days I was a little spoon. I didn't know I was just such, it was fucking awesome. I didn't have to fake sick and they have to pretend that I was sick and for four days, which is a goddamn maternity.

Speaker 6:          00:53:58       Yeah,

Speaker 2:          00:53:58       I got to fucking chill out. 54 minutes. Um Oh God, Jesus Christ. I don't know how you fucking people do this. This is like, this is like your work week. Isn't it just staring at the fucking clock. Um, or you know, it was make fun of how Bon Jovi can somehow sell out giant stadiums in New Jersey, but for some reason can't sell out a, a fucking Denny's. And in Oregon, I don't even know if that's true. I just like shitting on him. Um, somebody wrote and said, hey bill, I love the podcast. I know one of your vaccine questions of our age is why the fuck is Bon Jovi so popular in New Jersey? I get that they're from, from there by giant stadium. Anyways, he goes, I'm a u s service members stationed overseas in Germany. When I first moved here two years ago, I saw a Volkswagen in my town with a Bon Jovi sticker on the side of the car.

Speaker 2:          00:54:49       I thought, Holy Shit, that is one dedicated fan and wouldn't be funny if VW really made a Bon Jovi edition of the vehicle while I started seeing the car elsewhere in Germany. And finally I googled it. It's real. The attach photo is a picture I took on the base of a VW Bon Jovi. Yeah. And it's not a sticker. It's literally like the emblem, like on the side of your car. If it says Prius or Monte Carlo. Right. Um, isn't that funny? That Chevy named that car. A Monte Carlo. You ever seen Monte Carlo Monte Carlo that's in France and it has like fucking like that's all the Illuminati money in an America. It's some shitty accent. Shitty. It's a good looking car. Back in the 80s, it was, but come on, you know there was a poor man's caddy. It's a poor man's Buick anyways. They actually, it's, it's the uh, yeah, like, like whatever. It's the make not the make

Speaker 2:          00:55:50       not to make, what the fuck is it? They say make type. I don't fucking know. I'm sleepy. It's on the side of the God damn fucking car. We got a picture of it, everybody in order to feel like right now, I feel like one of those guys who gives those double decker tour bus guys, you know, and I don't know shit about the city and I will give a fuck. Somebody hooked me up with a job. I sort of feel like, um, and it was, that's the podcast for this week. Everybody, I apologize. I take full responsibility. This, I'm going to do this. Like when an athlete blows a game and he, the press is going to trash them. So he just jumps on the fucking grenade before they throw it in his face. I take full responsibility for that loss. Said I didn't, I didn't get it done.
