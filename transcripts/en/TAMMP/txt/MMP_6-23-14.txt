Speaker 1:          00:00:01       Hey, what's going on? It's bill burn. It's the Monday morning podcast from Monday, June 23rd, 2014. How's it going? How I yeah, what's up and all of that shit. Um, I don't know. What do I start? I don't even know where to begin. Um, I taped my special Friday night in Atlanta at the Tabernacle and I want to thank everybody who came out. I had a wonderful time. As always, there were a couple of glitches as always. A couple people screamed out and as always, what the fuck are you going to do? I had a great time and I'm,

Speaker 1:          00:00:40       I'm really looking forward to putting that special out and coming up with my new hour of material. And right now I'm trying not to freak out because essentially when this thing comes out in a couple of months, I have no APP. I mean I have an act, but it will be an act that potentially people in the crowd have seen. So I have to try some. Uh, I don't know what the fuck I'm going to do. Well, you know what I normally do when I try to build the new hour. No bill, we don't know. Nor do we give a shit. Well fuck you. It's my podcast. I'm going to talk about it. Um, when I like to do basically I, I basically I take off all rules of like hack deed shit. I don't give a fuck. I will, I will talk about anything. So I am now just looking what's go, what's, what's going on in the news. A little ageist thing here. It's like Jay Leno was bit right. We, it takes like the uh, the headlines except he actually has a staff of writers combing through to actually find funny ones. I on the other hand, we'll be going down to the clubs, just throwing anything I can up against the wall. Why the fuck is it so hot in here?

Speaker 1:          00:01:46       Jesus Christ and I can't open the fucking windows because my neighbors are going to freak out. I'm taping this Sunday nights. Everybody's home right now. God dammit Jesus. It's not one fucking thing. It's another, you know what? I was going to do it in the bedroom, being over. My wife wants to go take a bath and relax, which you know, is that wrong? No, it's not wrong.

Speaker 1:          00:02:10       You don't know is it, is it, is it pathetic that I can't do a podcast and then in the next room without disturbing her because I scream and yell and rant and rave and all that shit. I had to put that in. I guess that is pathetic. So I am, I'm out here in the living room. I can't open the fucking windows and I tell you that heat's getting to me already. Oh, it's getting to me. Um, what would you rather do? Would you rather freeze to death? I'll get myself a dilemma here. We'd rather freeze to death or a, I'm not going to say burned to death. Every, everybody's going to choose freezing to death. Although there'll be a couple of dishes. Woo. Boozing, good at be painful. So it would to get the pain over with.

Speaker 2:          00:02:49       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:02:50       You know, hit me with some sort of scientific facts or whatever. He'll just say some science shit. They don't even have to be faxed when it comes to my scientific background of which I have none. You know, I took two goddamn classes. No, I didn't even do that one was chemistry and I was just like, I'm not fucking looking at bugs, you know? I know it's not bugs, but I had to follow through with that sentence cause that's the first thing I thought of when I was looking, looking in the petri dish. What are you looking at? Huh? Oh that's biology. So I was still wrong. Chemistry. You know what I love about this fucking podcast is how dumb you guys think. I am not how dumb you think I am, but like how much smarter like this shit that you guys, right? I swear to God, Yo, Yo, Yo, you fuck it.

Speaker 1:          00:03:40       Animals just like make all right, but whatever. Maybe that's my job. My job's to make you feel better. I don't know. I have no idea. Um, but anyways, yeah, my science, my science backgrounds, horrific. I took a, I just didn't give a fuck when I was younger. They shouldn't try to teach you that shit when you're young. You know you're too busy staring at the fucking hot chicks and class. You sitting there with the fucking Rod, you know, trying to memorize a periodical chart. You can't do that. And if you can, you know what? I don't even know what the fuck you are. You're not even a human being. How are you not looking at the check that develop the quickest, you know, with the tits over there or Jordache jeans would have a Sass on whatever the fuck they had back when I was a kid.

Speaker 1:          00:04:29       That's what you're looking at. Or even worse, you had some Hadi for a fucking teacher that you wanted to bang, you know, that'd be tell you about that time. I got trouble. I got in trouble long time ago. I was taking this French class and the teacher I had was beautiful and she had a habit of wearing dresses where she had a slit halfway up the side of her fucking leg. You know, I'm in the eighth grade. What am I supposed to do? Well. Long Story Short, one day she came and she had a slit up bolt on both sides of the dress, right? So she would be writing on the board and in when she would step back. And did I ever tell a story came out when she would step back so you could see, you know, she'd step one leg back and then somehow you could basically see halfway up her leg on her inner thigh on the leg closest to the blackboard and like the fuck egg. It was over. All right. No blood in my brain. I'm just going. All I'm doing is thinking how to say in French, please step back again.

Speaker 1:          00:05:36       See me play. I have no idea. I don't. I'm not even fucking listening. And to this day, I don't know, I never had just one of the worst. I've had a teacher yelled at me, she called on me, all right, and I'm trying to fucking answer her and I'm trying to bullshit my way through and she realizes that I haven't been fucking paying attention. And she flipped out calling me a liar. It's screen. To this day, I swear to God, something was going on in our home life because it's like, yeah, I mean, you should just called me a fucking liar and moved on. She just fucking, she berated me for like the last 20 minutes of the class.

Speaker 3:          00:06:12       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:06:15       I remember Jesus. I'm rubbing my head now thinking about it. I was just sitting at, you know, you know any times I've thought about that fucking moment, my life, and I just wished that I had the emotional maturity to be like, you know, you weren't paying attention to where are you? And I'd be like, no, I wasn't. I wasn't. Why don't you, you know, not come to class. All right. We're with two slits up both sides. You're dress obese. You know what your inner thigh is way more interesting than watching you. Uh, go g, suite two A and all that. I fucking crap. Okay. Send me down to the office. What do you want? What do you want from me? I'll give a f. Yeah, whatever. I'm not passing this class anyways. Am I, am I, I, you know what, fuck this. I want to thank you for dressing the way that you do because that shit you're writing on the board is not interesting.

Speaker 1:          00:06:59       It's not nearly as interesting as a what's going on downstairs? There. Okay. And quit acting like you don't know what you're doing and you're yelling at me, you're getting on me. You're having a bad time with your fucking husband. That's what it is. What's a matter? He doesn't want to touch anymore. So now you've got to come in here all gussied up. Get us all hot and bothered. Right. And then fucking scream and yell at me cause I'm not paying the, yeah, you're not even going to be yelling at me. You're yelling at your fucking husband. Can you imagine? I actually have probably when and got half of that up. I don't fucking know. You know, I have to mention I had paid off. I guess I had really bad add.

Speaker 3:          00:07:36       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:07:36       Yeah, I can't, you don't, you only time I can focus is if I give a fuck about something. All my life is in jeopardy. You know, like I went on a motorcycle ride today with a buddy of mine and we drove all the way down sunset all the way down and all the way back. And I got to tell you, uh,

Speaker 1:          00:07:55       I don't see the enjoyment and riding a motorcycle. I don't get it. It, it always looks awesome. But once you're on there, all you're thinking is I'm going to die. That's a fucking range rover. Jesus Christ. Get the fuck away from me. You know, the whole fucking, you can't look at anything. All you're doing is making you driving down the street. You're making sure that nobody's pulling out somewhere. No one's going to open a door up. You get up to a fucking stop light. You got to look in your rear view mirror to make sure it's nobody rear ends you and pushes you out into traffic. Fucking horrific. You're going around a turn. You got to look your way through the God damn term and they make sure the other ass hole across the street, you know, come on the other way. Is it going to wipe you out? But I gotta tell you my focus is incredible. I guess that's the only way I can focus.

Speaker 3:          00:08:51       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:08:51       Or if there's like something, something is on, uh, on the line. Other than that, I just started staring at bugs on the ceiling or whatever. I don't know what it is I do. I'm out of my fucking mind. So anyways, uh, what was I talking about? Oh yeah. So I take my special this weekend and um,

Speaker 1:          00:09:10       you know, that's the fun part though. The horrific part now is I have to go back and I got to uh, go in during the editing process and that's not something I liked doing. I said, I got this weird thing where if I videotape myself with a club, I could sit there and I can watch it and I can laugh and I can enjoy it. But the second I know you guys are going to see it too. I get all in my head and everything I'm doing, I think, Jay, why did I do that? What am I doing? Blah, blah. Why did I say this? You know, why is my weight on my right leg right now instead of my left? Like it's fucking torture. So I got to push my way through it because, uh, you know, I, I'm trying to make sure, you know, with each special, you know, you want to be a little bit better than you were the last time. You want it to look a little bit better than the last one. So, uh, I didn't realize with that also become, comes to pressure of, of uh, I dunno, trying to, trying to keep going up.

Speaker 1:          00:10:03       I don't fucking know. I don't know, whatever. It's behind me. Okay. So now basically what I'm doing is I'm looking over these, uh, I'm trying to watch the news, which I can't do because I don't know about, I don't know where you guys live in the world, but we don't really have news over here. We have a little bit of it, but for the most part it's basically, uh, the Democrat news and the Republican News. It's really fucking sad. Um, I used, I liked the way they used to lie to us. I liked it back in the day, you know, when they just had that person, that fucking older white guy who had that sound in his voice that just sounded like he fucking, you know, was giving you the straight deal, you know, as opposed to now we got all these personalities that are like bigger than the news, you know, all those silly concent, Fox News and all those dip shits on CNN. Who's that guy with the fucking silver hair on CNN? What does he, what does he call his show? Ah, Jesus Christ. I, I can't remember when he got the, he got the one calls it the, the situation room, which you remember opie and Opie and Anthony is to always make fun of the situation room.

Speaker 2:          00:11:22       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:11:23       And you got what's his face going? Yeah. This is the no spin zone that bill O'Reilly jerk off. This is the no spin zone. It's like, dude, the your and your entire fucking show was you spin in it. There's no such thing as a no spin zone. Right now I'm spinning. How I think news is that this country, so you guys agree with what the fuck I say there's no such thing like I'm going to give you a strike dark. Even if you wanted to. You couldn't cause you getting it off that fucking whatever the fuck it is. That ticker thing that you get it. Yeah. You weren't there. You don't know what happened. It even if your were there, I'm going to get it. It's going to be what happened. Cut with your childhood. That's what's going to happen. Cause it goes into your brain and then it's fucking in there and it's stepped on like drugs. It's not the pure shit that just happened so I can't watch it. What the fuck does that guy called his shell?

Speaker 1:          00:12:14       That's silver haired guy. It's something arrogant. Something arrogant like he's giving you, do you know what the fuck is supposed to be happening? Anderson Cooper three 60 is that what it is? I thought it was worse than that. Three 60 is not bad. Right? He's spinning around is he tells the news today. Hey Jeff. Uh, sorry. Terrible joke and, but you know what? I'll put that in my act. I need jokes. Anderson Cooper, three six look at net worth. Who the fuck would look up his? Oh No, it's just guys make a year or two. I did good. Well what did you do? The shoot? Any read teleprompters? I could do that.

Speaker 2:          00:12:51       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:12:51       I thought he had something. I thought it was called something worse than that. Anderson Cooper, three 60 sounds like one of them. My ex game tricks. You get a backside fakey followed by Anderson Cooper. Three 60

Speaker 2:          00:13:05       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:13:06       Jesus Christ. Insert homophobic joke. They're like, what would, what would an Anderson Cooper, three sixties that's skateboard look like? Oh that's, you know what? That's too easy. Full coverage from Anderson live in Baghdad. I got to tell, oh, I know what annoys me is when he goes out and he tells us stories. Got a fucking helmet on. You know what I mean? Jesus Christ. A helmet won't even help you on a motorcycle. Okay, you're out. You're in a fucking war zone. Take it off and show your great hair. You son of a bitch, Anderson Cooper, three 60 spinning around live here in Baghdad. Republicans do everything wrong. Um, oh. Keeping them honest. Is that, is that what, is that what he does? Why am I asking you guys, why didn't I do my fucking research on this thing? Keeping them honest, gay conversion therapy. Oh, Jesus Christ. I can't imagine the tension there, dude. How fucking retarded are you that you actually think that you can stop somebody from being attracted to what they're attracted to and then also thinking that it's unnatural. You know, I don't understand that.

Speaker 2:          00:14:25       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:14:26       Unless you're talking about pedophiles, but even them, it's the way they're wired is something happened to them and then they try to undo that wiring. That's noble work. But I mean, at the end of the day, I mean, we all know what needs to happen. You got to take them out behind the barn and give him the old fucking old yellow treatment. All right? So you can't help it. I know it's not your fault. You want to help. You want to fuck a kid? We can't have that. Okay. Maybe

Speaker 4:          00:14:52       someday in the future. I don't know when, but not now. When would you, I don't know when you would, but it's, it's, it's, it's not gonna happen. So you get done. It's over. Quit. You cry and be a God damn man. Right. And then that's it. So

Speaker 1:          00:15:10       keeping them honest, gay conversion therapy, look at this fucking Weirdo.

Speaker 1:          00:15:18       How do they try to convert you from not being gay? I bet they just have you sitting there, right? If it's a gay, a gay man and they'd be like, all right, okay, we're going to do something different here. Okay. And want you, I want you to do is, uh, think about having sex with a man. Okay. And Are you doing it? Yeah, yeah, I'm doing it. I just keep thinking about that. You haven't sacks, you know, he smells like old spice, you know, whatever you're into, blah, blah, blah. And it gets the fucking due to Ra aroused and then he just has some naked woman come in and do like a flying scissor kick and put her snatch rightness face. Right. Gets that stank or on him. While he's still has an erection thinking that maybe that would take, you know, other than that, I don't, I don't know how you'd do it, but what's funny about that was then if they wanted to convert me to be engaged, they would do the exact same thing except the flying scissor kick would be somebody package coming flying at my face. I mean, I want to go on a limb and say that, that that's not going to work.

Speaker 2:          00:16:22       Okay,

Speaker 1:          00:16:23       dude. How isolated are you as a fucking human being that you're actually part of a group that's trying to do some shit like this? I mean, I guess people looked at Orville and Wilbur Wright like, yeah, you out of your fucking mind. You're trying to fly. That's crazy. So maybe they think that they're doing that except with like sexuality. You know, funny about the early planes is when the people didn't understand that the flapping of the wings was to gain speed. So they tried to have like the like, well I get, I don't know. Isn't that what they thought?

Speaker 2:          00:16:58       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:16:58       Isn't that something else that I haven't read about that they thought that the, it's got something to do with the flapping of the wings before they realize like, no, we just need the somehow gained some speed. We got to build something that somebody can run with. Oh, Jesus. I look, fuck you guys. I already told you I didn't take any science classes. Okay, go. You know. Anyways, Jesus is fucking podcast is all over the place. Uh, let, let's, let's do a little advertising here. All right. Um,

For those of you listen to my podcast every week, you know that, uh, ever since I came back from France, I have not drank. I am up to, I don't know how many fucking days. By the time he listened to this, I'll be on my 67th day and a, I'm going to Vegas and I'm going, I decided I'm going off the wagon and Vegas. I got two shows a Friday and Saturday night and at the Mirage casino. And it just so happens that the tour, that the Monday morning podcast has been sponsoring the tour that has been crushing it in the clubs all around the country. The Tor, that includes Paul Dude, I called it Versie Joe Bart, Nick Rosebowl tailgate legend and a rolls volt tailgate legend and Grill Cook.

Fun For all fun for all. And who knows? Maybe even a couple of special guests when we're in Vegas. You never know who drops in. Um, so, so anyways, I haven't been drinking. So today, uh, I was like, all right, you know, I've been on the road and Shit and getting ready for this, a taping. I'm going to take my wife up. She wanted to go to the beach, right? So I got my little motorcycle riding in the morning. I didn't die and uh, came back and I took her out to the beach and I went over to a, Oh, I did my workout over there, right over there on muscle beach. I stood there and a little banana hammock showing off my fucking pasty body. Now they got a, they got pull up bars and they got rings and they got the rope over there. I hate the fucking new rope now. They used to have like a real rope. Now this one's made like, I don't know if they put some protective thing on. It felt like I was almost made out of plastic. Um,

Speaker 2:          00:24:35       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:24:36       I guess for the weather or something like that. So it wouldn't disintegrate like the last one did. But I did all right. I did all right on it, man. I was able to go almost all the way up to the top without using my legs. Then I got to tell you for 46 and a bed and a fucking bed. So after that we drive up to Malibu and I'm thinking malleable. This is fucking, you know, with all these rich people are and everything, this is going to be nice. We go to the beach and I tell you, I can't even begin to describe the fucking animals, the absolute fucking animals that were at the beach. I made. It is fucking horrific. Fuck Dude. You know, it's fucking hilarious is seeing people from my generation and the generation before, like the tattoos that were in, you know

Speaker 1:          00:25:25       like dude, I saw this guy in the beach, right? And now that everybody's older and out of shape and has kids and shit, this guy, you know those fucking stars that everybody had. Everybody got him in the early 2000 they were like red and then they had like some sort of darker shading in him. I mean I have a friend that has two of them, I think one on each elbow. So there's some fucking guy, roughly the same age as my buddy. He's got one just to the inside of both shoulders, which was sort of a weird place for him. But if he had more tattoos that look fine, but he had no other tattoos in that area. It was just weird. It's like, what are you, are you like a general in your own life? White? Why do you have those fucking stars there?

Speaker 1:          00:26:06       Right? So we sit in there, you could tell he used to be in shape. You know, they used to have the packs, but now that kind of looking down, staring at the floor, big stupid pot belly and he's sitting there as his kids are running around and these eaten these digging into this bag of chips and then not ships, you know, all those things that look like the onion rings but then not onion rings. It's like if you had a potato chip, but it was a fucking shaped like an onion ring that he's just sitting there eating those things. So this other dude come by.

Speaker 2:          00:26:36       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:26:37       I know, Dude. I am obsessed with trying to stay in shape and not become what I see. Okay. At the fucking beach. This guy comes by, or Latino Guy, right? Fucking big giant belly and tattooed on his stomach. You know, like Tupac had thug life. This guy for some reason had Pasadena.

Speaker 1:          00:27:03       Oh, it was awful. It was fucking awful. There were two hobbies on the beach other than my wife. Uh, there was like the fucking model couple guy in woman in front of us who look like they were, they were shooting up fucking guests ad and then all the way down the way, there was some chicken, a fucking pink bikini who was working out on the beach total like exhibitionists. It was great. It was great. I kept saying, I need to go and look what she's doing now. Look what she's doing now. She's doing, she's doing a leg lifts with the weights on her ankles and she kept looking over going like, Oh God, no. I love when women get mad at other women who were fucking prancing around showing that clam. It's fucking hilarious. Yeah. I'm trying to think of the guy version of that.

Speaker 3:          00:27:51       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:27:52       What, what would a guy be doing? I guess I'm trying to think of something that a guy would be doing in that version that would, that same scenario that wouldn't make me laugh my ass off. Do we think guys would do that? Would ever bug me is, is uh, I guess walk up and just start hitting on your girlfriend or your wife or whatever. Right in front of you. I guess that would be the only thing. Other than that, if they walking around peacock and I don't give a fuck, I think it's hilarious. You know, and plus you're young. Go ahead. Exactly. Go fuck around the surf. What? You still can. So anyways, we're sitting there, Alan, the families do what kind of people go to the beach as you can tell. I'm not a beach person, so I never went. Just fucking animals. These fucking people brought a table down. They've got a large cheese pizza. They just sitting on the beach getting fatter. You know, it's like you're going to take your shirt off in a second. You're going to slam you gonna fucking down four slices of Pepperoni mushroom, Jesus Christ. You know? And I would love to, I don't know. I would love to act like, you know, people try to act like it. It's only in America where everybody's all fat. Uh, we are, we are pretty God damn fat because that food is such fucking poison.

Speaker 3:          00:29:10       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:29:12       But it's, it's still a shit show everywhere else, I dunno. And in its own way. Oh, speaking of that, do you know what I was, uh, I was in Utah last week and I took this picture and I put it up on Twitter and I was in the gym, right? The hotel gym and they had a couple of ellipticals and then they had a big window when you looked outside. And right across the street was a, this fast food place. So I took a picture of it and just Hashtag like, come on man, you know, like I'm trying to lose weight here in the attempt me with this shit. So the fast food place sod and then tried to write a joke about it, like trying to draw me until the horse shit the fucking poison that they're serving. They always say, why don't you come over here afterwards and do some fucking Hamburger Charles? Get it. That's what they hashtag you get it. You know, acting like they're the cool, okay

Speaker 4:          00:30:05       fucking

Speaker 1:          00:30:07       dailer of poison. Right. And I just wrote him back. I was like, no, I don't get it. Why would I work out and then go over New York restaurant and eat that poison kind of defeats the purpose of working out. No, and they never wrote back stop back then. Like, you're cool. You know, it'd be cool if they just came out and said, listen, what we're serving you is absolutely fucking horrific. There's barely an ounce of nutrition in this shit, but God dammit, it is fucking delicious. So I don't have it all the time. Just every once in awhile, if they just came out and said that,

Speaker 1:          00:30:49       you know, I don't fucking know. I'm, you know what I'm talking about here. I'm just trying, you know, I'm just, I'm just trying to get to another podcast. That's all I'm trying to do. Um, you know, I really thought I was going to have a big feeling of relief when I finished my, my special I could get on with my life here and, uh, I don't know, kind of feel love. I feel a little melancholy. I'm really going to miss those jokes. I really am, man. I fucking, I, I, that was my favorite hour and a half a shit I've ever written and uh, I dunno, I might have to pull out those couple of those every once in awhile somebody requests one or something, I might have to do that.

Speaker 2:          00:31:28       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:31:28       I got this helicopter joke, man. Wait, wait DC. It's one of my favorite jokes I've ever gotten to. There's just so much fun to fucking do it. You know, it's a, that Steve jobs bit than I did. I did that one on night and too many stars that was up. That was a sad one to let go. I just loved when I was walking around acting like he was eating a pair that was so much fucking fun. Just acting like an arrogant ass trashing somebody that's accomplished way more than I'll ever accomplish. You know, those are the funniest moments.

Speaker 4:          00:31:57       And uh, and stand up

Speaker 1:          00:32:01       is when you get to do shit like that and just act like a fucking idiot. And people actually laugh and that's a God damn it making fun of Oprah's fun. How was it? How was it not fun to make fun of somebody as successful as her who has like 50 fucking houses and her own TV network? It's just fun. Do you guys know? I had at one time I had a meeting. Right?

Speaker 2:          00:32:21       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:32:22       And uh,

Speaker 1:          00:32:25       I was meeting with the casting director of, uh, of uh, what does it dreamworks. Right. And I know this sounds like a big deal, but this shit happens all the time. All the time when you're out here from the day you get out, you get a meeting with like fucking back in the day, like castle rock was doing all the sick contract. Oh my God, I got to meet it with castle rock. They have like nine sitcoms on and they just meet with you and you think you're going to get on a Sitcom and you're lucky if you get an audition within the year that just always meet new people. Right? So this is all is, it's a, it's just a meeting, right? So I go over there and I'm sitting in the waiting room waiting to meet, uh, with this big time casting director. Right? And all of a sudden I hear a,

Speaker 2:          00:33:10       okay,

Speaker 1:          00:33:11       this woman sing,

Speaker 2:          00:33:13       okay,

Speaker 1:          00:33:13       and goes, I hear this woman go and Spielberg like that and I'm thinking like, Holy Shit.

Speaker 2:          00:33:23       Yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:33:23       am I going to see Steven Spielberg? He's, he's at the top of his fucking chain, but you never see the top guy. So I'm like, rubber neck and, and all this shit. And I look, and he's not there, but the person who sang that, it was Oprah Winfrey and she walked by and I'm sitting on the couch going, oh my God, I have made fun of you on like 50 fucking podcast. It's, she walked by with her entourage and a for half a second. We both, I was looking at her, she actually looked over at me and she just kept going for half a second. I was so arrogant. I thought she was going to stop and be like, you're that punk ass who did that fucking bit about me. You know, it was going to start yelling at me. And she didn't, she just looked at me like I was a lamp and she just kept walking and I was like, oh yeah, that's right. She has other things to do. Evidently she was just saying goodbye to Steven Spielberg. How funny is it that she doesn't just do that on a show? That she actually really sings stuff that she's saying

Speaker 1:          00:34:30       in real life does, did you ever see that hilarious impression that Maya Rudolph used to do of Oprah and she used to do that thing where she would sing to like the crowd. Okay. And everybody gets a new co would do like that thing that she actually does that in real life. You know? Isn't that nice as a little Hollywood story for your people? I dropped two names in there without you even noticing. Um, all right. I don't know what to talk about because hockey's over. Basketball's over. I'm trying to get into baseball. Oh, I will tell you this. I'm actually thinking about getting the baseball package and um, as a red sox fan, you know what I really missed doing? Watching Yankee Games, believe it or not. I absolutely love watching the Yankee telecast more so than I like watching the red sox won. I don't even know why.

Speaker 1:          00:35:23       I think because I lived in New York for so long and I would just want, and this is both, this is when I lived during the height of the curse of curse of the bay when I was there. So I fucking hated the Yankees. So I went to Yankee stadium a zillion times. I watched all of their fucking games just sitting there rooting against him and must have saw Clemons pitch like 50 fucking times. I saw them. I saw the 98 Yankees. Um, which is legendary now. I mean, I don't think there's been a team like that sense. Um, but I got to be on it. Like, I don't know, there's something about it. Like I did it for so fucking long. I think I've actually watched wire to wire more Yankee regular season games. Then I have red sox games because I mean, I was in New York for like, I don't like 12 years. And you know, when I was a kid growing up, I mean, the first 10 years of your life, I mean you just run around throwing sticks and mud and shit. You're not really paying attention. And then from 10 to 20,

Speaker 1:          00:36:24       I dunno, I would watch him, but you know, you'd getting drunk for the first time, you're trying to get up some girl's shirt, you're busy. So then I just basically had from like 20 to 27 and then I moved. Um, but I stayed in New York for like, you know, fucking 12 years. So I, uh, but I got to tell you, I love watching them now because they're, they're announcing team is, it's the shit. All Right, it's Michael K,

Speaker 1:          00:36:53       he's steering the ship. And then I love when there's nothing better. When you have former players that are actually really good broadcast is, and they have Paul O'Neill, the former Yankee. Great. And they have al Leiter. So you have one, uh, one of the great hitters of the last 20 years and champions. And then you have al Leiter a pitcher. So you got a picture in here and just the combination of the two of them. Man, it's Al Leiter is hilarious. Fucking hilarious. And I, and this is a thing I always loved Paul O'Neil and uh, every my money and my family actually fucking love the guy because he was so hilarious to us cause we all have tempers. And the funniest thing about Paulownia was the amount of times I saw that guy come up to bat, hit a fly ball to right field and the second he hits it, you'd see him put his head down and go fuck and throw the bat down and it would be a home run intellect the third row.

Speaker 1:          00:37:50       But he, he, he was such a perfectionist. Like the fact that he didn't get all of it. He was mad. I guess what the, he didn't drive it 30 rows in and then in every fucking time, whether he got a hit or whether he didn't get a hit when he ran out to the field and he would go out to right field, he would immediately, I guess he'd throw the ball around, but once that was over, he would be out the in between like batters, it's in between pitches and shit. He'd be out there practicing his swing. I don't know. There's just certain guys, even though they play on the team that you hate, you can't fucking hate the guy. The guy was great. So I was watching on one of their telecasts recently and um, they actually, they cut to some footage of Al Leiter facing Paul O'Neil and was hilarious and of Paul and Neil gets a hit.

Speaker 1:          00:38:36       And then the last two that they showed, Al Leiter struck him out and he's like, oh, I struck yard. I didn't even know that. And then he looked over at Michael and he goes, yeah. And Paul didn't get that mad. Was fucking great. So I'm actually thinking about getting the, uh, the baseball package, cause I actually have a package where I get the nes and network and I get the yes network thinking that I'd get the fucking games and I don't, they blocked the whole thing out because they say force you to buy, you know, so I get the Milwaukee brewer home games. It's such con there's such fucking cunt. Why can't they just, you know, you know, I guess it's my fault for moving away. Do you understand what I'm really bitching about here? That basically for a hundred something bucks that no, Boo Hoo. Now I have to watch all the baseball games you want to strike all of that. God bless whoever came up with that package. Um,

Speaker 1:          00:39:29       uh, what am I going here? All right. World Cup soccer. If you guys been watching, I hate to say this man, I haven't watched one second of it. And I actually, for as much as I make fun of a [inaudible] football, the real football, uh, I, you know, I, I totally respect it. I think it's a beautiful game. I just wish I had and I'm driving by the bars and I'm seeing all the flags out in the hearing. People screaming and yelling. I wish I had the time to watch it. I know that there's some games tomorrow. I think Brazil, please somebody. I'm actually going to try at least maybe to tape a game. I got to get into this shit's once. It'd be four years. The whole fucking world's going nuts. Uh, but hey, you know what? I said that the United States is going to win it.

Speaker 1:          00:40:09       I said, the fix is fucking in and we are one o one one. I haven't watched a second of it. I know that we tied Portugal today, which to me seems pathetic. All right. Portugal's barely in Europe. It's like Spain felt bad for him to like, all right, here's a little landing strip. You guys can fucking live over here. Okay. You can have your little football team. He once every four years we'll let you run around and sing you songs and where you scarves. But other than that, your pipe the fuck down. All right. Now if all you Portuguese people were going to get mad at me, um,

Speaker 1:          00:40:42       right, all the mean shit you want. And then also tell me where I can do a show in your country and I'll fucking do it. All right? You guys can go there and you can fucking heckle me by singing your soccer songs. He football songs right in the middle of it and I'll give you shit. And in the end, you know, we'll trade jerseys, you'll give me a soccer jersey and I'll take off one of my button downs. What the fuck was with that guy who scored the goal today? And he started sucking his thumb. Can anybody explain that to me? I don't understand soccer. Every time you start to love it, somebody does some shit like that. And then you just, you just got to walk away. So anyways, we are one all in one.

Speaker 2:          00:41:21       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:41:21       So we're gonna play Germany next and basically if we tie, if us in Germany tie, uh, we move, we automatically advance. We're one on one, one Germany's one on one. And in Portugal and in Ghana I think is in our, in our, uh, whatever division, whatever the fuck you call it, quadrant. They both are, have yet to win a fucking game. So, um, I dunno, I, I, I'm, I want us to win the World Cup so bad just because I love what I was talking about last week. Just how much world would fucking heinous, but I gotta tell you, man, I think we're going to win and one, eventually we are going to win one. And I don't mean that like, well shit, you know, they're going to play it every four years forever. Eventually everybody's going to win one. I mean, I think,

Speaker 2:          00:42:11       yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:42:11       we're on our way to winning one.

Speaker 2:          00:42:14       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:42:14       As in I think we'll win one by 2030. All right. Which is saying something, considering how far behind we were. And in 2030, if you want to know, I will be 62 years old. That's how fast it goes. You know, Jesus and I'll be working on another fucking special. Um, hopefully, maybe it'd be my year off. All right, let's plow ahead here. Um, anything else here? Did the all in tour. Oh, youtube fucking video of the week. I was watching this, uh, the dead weather concert.

Speaker 1:          00:42:52       I don't know how to private p. R. I. V. E. I started watching this thing. I was trying to, I don't know what the fuck I was doing. I was doing something and all of a sudden I just started watching Jack White videos and I got to this, I can't believe I didn't see the dead weather live because I got to tell you the lead singer that, or at least what I've been watching, that woman, I hope I say her name right, Alison Mosshart, uh, is a fucking rock star. I'm going to go see that band. What is it? The kill that she's in. Very rarely do you see a legitimate fucking rockstar. And she's definitely one without a doubt. So that's one of the youtube videos of the week. Just fucking watch it. And what's cool also is Jack White's set up, uh, his drum set up, how he has everything all level, kind of like the way buddy rich did.

Speaker 1:          00:43:37       But he's is a wonder why actually buddy, which is symbols will level. That's right. This is some drum kick shit. You can fast forward through this, but he has like, it looks like he has a rack, Tom and then two different snare drums all at the exact same lab, all at the same level that you would have your snare drum. Um, and then on the A to his right side, he's got three floor toms. The Way Tony Williams used to have him. Right. You guys all know it, right? When he had that yellow yellow kit, do you know I saw him at the regata bar. I saw Tony Williams and I knew he was awesome, but I of course didn't understand everything he was doing. And in between the break I walked right up and stood next to his drums. That classic Yellow Kid. I saw him, I saw Louie Bellson shook his hand and I saw a Roy Haynes. I saw all these great jazz drums. And of course, Tony Williams like died a couple of years later, unfortunately from a heart. But, uh,

Speaker 4:          00:44:32       anyways, what the fuck? Why am I talking to you guys about old jazz drummers? Jesus Christ. Uh, let's, let's get to some questions here. Um, oh, by the way too, if you want to, if you want to, um, send in some questions or whatever, uh, which you want to follow us on Twitter, it's at the [inaudible] podcast on Twitter. All right. And all the videos that I recommend and all the shit that I talk about, I'll definitely, uh, have the links up there. It's way more organized than it ever used to be. All right. There you go. Ah, Bill, bunch of emails from people who were at the taping, couple emails, calling out Douche bags at the first show for being loud. You know, I didn't mind that, you know, the first show, they told everybody to stay in their seats and we realized that that was wrong because I was doing well over an hour and people were drinking.

Speaker 4:          00:45:22       They had it, they had to go to the bathroom. It wasn't fair. So, um, so on the second show I was, I just said to the people, you know, who was shooting and things like, look, people walk around all the fucking time. I still have a good set. I don't give a shit. Just let them do what they want to do. I don't, you know, let's just make it more like a show. And that's what we did in the second show when even better. So anyways. All right bill, in response to male whore verse a female whore. Um, all right, dear Billy Buffalo, uh, I am a proud woman who loves other women. Nice, Nice. [inaudible] I found your handling of the whore gay son verse a whore for a daughter. Question to be spot on. I also agree with the gay man who wrote in last week, if I was sitting around a table and this question was posed, you know, it's funny, I don't even remember what I said.

Speaker 4:          00:46:15       I'd feel it was addressing current issues that are generally ignored, uh, discussions that are usually avoided in fear of discrimination, but in actuality depriving important dialogue. Yeah, absolutely. You should be allowed to be ignorant. Is Long, you know, as long as you're not like acting on it and like trying to hurt somebody should be allowed to say the things that you feel. And if they end up being, um, you know, I ignorant not mean dumb, just ignorant. Like you just want to expose to some other information. You got to have people get them out and then that's how you move on to the next level. Like, no, actually it's like this. Oh, I didn't know that. And then, you know, hopefully you change for the better. Um, so anyways, discussions that are usually avoid it, blah, blah, blah, blah. She says, I never knew my father, but I would hope he would answer that question honestly. Frankly, I don't like labeling either as whores, but it's the easiest way to sum it up. I agree with you wholeheartedly. Uh, caused somebody a whore that's really bad, a hose kind of funny whore to actually say it has really bad. Um,

Speaker 4:          00:47:32       she continues to say, I'd be remiss not to mention that Nia spoke emotionally as a straight woman, but did not consider why the question is important to gate children. Oftentimes gay teens experiment prematurely after having repressed feelings for their early, for their ear, early adolescents or from their early adolescence. I don't know. The truth is though, emotional, emotional changes and repercussions of early sexual encounters affect the female much more severely. This is not to say that boys can't suffer the effects, but as you and Nia have both pointed out in the past, women are more sensitive to certain things that men are not. Um, I was with you all the way until, till, um, why you say that the, uh, the sexual encounters affect the female much more severely? Um, I don't think that that's something you could ever prove or disprove. Like that's something that I always go round and round with my wife with

Speaker 1:          00:48:29       somebody says, you know, it's easier for guys to lose weight. You know, I, it's like, well, you would have to be a guy, okay and then be a woman and then live the exact same life and eat the exact same food. To really sit there and try and guess if, if whatever is easier and whatever. I mean, I think it all kind of balances itself out is far as easy and difficult. It's like, you know, I dunno that just that whole fucking reoccurring thing that this is a bad experience but it's worse for women. Um, or this is this experience. It's easier for guys. It's just always like there has to be something out there where it's even, or there has to be something out there where it's worse or aren't they both? It's just kind of a big shit sandwich out there. And the big game is, you know, trying to block that out isn't it? I would actually say that, uh, the guy's pain is that we are not allowed to talk about our pain

Speaker 1:          00:49:37       at all. Where you guys can have painful shit happened to you and it's okay for you literally to break down sobbing and weeping, which is so healthy for you to get it out, to get it out of you. I mean, it doesn't get it all out of you, but it gets that the buildup, the, the like, you know, you have a cook oatmeal and you'll walk away and you'll leave it too high and it fucking boils over. Yeah. That shit. You can get that off. I think through crime, like the funny thing about crying is it is a natural emotion for both men and women. But we're told that we can't do it. And I, it, it's a fucking horrible thing.

Speaker 4:          00:50:21       MMM,

Speaker 2:          00:50:23       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:50:23       It's a horrible thing. So I'm now, I'm not saying that that makes you guys have it easier, but I'm just saying that

Speaker 4:          00:50:28       that is, that is something that I don't think that, uh, is taken into consideration. And I just feel like, you know, every time I see, you know, I, that's a reoccurring thing, but I, I agree with everything else that you're saying. I guess she probably thinking I'm a dick now, but I'm just just saying that, you know, like, um,

Speaker 2:          00:50:46       okay.

Speaker 4:          00:50:47       I Dunno if you're a guy and you know, you got to cry, but you don't want to embarrass yourself. Just go take a shower. Nobody's going to notice. No one's going to hear you. And if somebody would have ripped back the fucking thing, the, the, the, the shower curtain, like in psycho, you could just act like you got shampoo in your ride. Just don't start talking or I'll still realize it, but you know, just have your head under the water and just sort of look at it. I'm like, wow, I'm showering. Get away from me. You weirdo. Um, yeah, you can cry out. A lot of childhood pain is a guy in, in the, uh, in the shower without anybody knowing. All right, dear Billy, ginger nuts.

Speaker 4:          00:51:29       Jesus Christ. Can you fucking, you know, can you come at me from a different God damn angle? Everything's red hair red. Pubes fucking pasty. I got it. You think I haven't heard this my whole fucking life? Jesus fucking Christ. I gotta hand it to you guys. You know, you have found 700 different fucking ways to attack me. I'm referring to the question raised, uh, whether it would be better to have a daughter who Jesus Christ. This fucking question really has been living on whether it'd be better to have a daughter who were a whore or a gay son who was also a whore. The best analogy I've ever heard with respect to the whole, why is it dean bad for a female to be a whore but not a male is this? If you own a key that opens, opens lots of locks, then that that is pretty cool, but if you have a lock that is opened by a lot of keys, then that is a shitty luck. You know? It would've helped if I read it better. She owned a key that opens lots of locks. That's pretty cool, but if you have a lock that is opened by a lot of keys, then that is a shitty luck. I actually, I don't like that one.

Speaker 4:          00:52:37       I like my analogy because I'm a self centered cunt. I just think it doesn't take any fucking skill. The love, the skill level for a woman to get late is just like, what do you have to do? Lay on your back, spread your legs. Who wants it? I'm not saying you're going to get somebody desirable, you know, but the fucking work we, this is something to try this one time I told you I did this with my wife where you just turn the tables one night, have her hit on, you, have her come up with an opening line.

Speaker 4:          00:53:13       You Watch, you watch how much they bomb. He watched the flop sweat. They got nothing. You think you have nothing. They when it comes to that shit, most of them are, are like their game is where your game was. You were like 12, 13. The first few times you were trying to talk to some girl in your grade, you got nothing cause you never tried it before. That's where they're at at like 35. Um, anyways, free Billy. They they a golden little play on the movie title. Uh, Billy four times. Congrats on the completion of your fourth special. I can't wait to watch it with my friends. We will all crowd around the tree TV like one of the Roosevelt's fireside chats. Okay. This person, a free willy reference and then hit me with a little bit of a depression era ship. Uh, my question to you is how will you celebrate beers, burgers. Uh, what did the coming weeks have in store for you? Please don't say working on your next hour because no one likes a goody two shoes. Yeah. You know why? Cause you're still fucking up in your life aren't, you know, it's funny, as I opened this podcast talking about this, um,

Speaker 2:          00:54:19       okay,

Speaker 1:          00:54:20       I am going to drink, but I also, I don't want to put on the weight that I took off for this special, you know, I'm looking good for me. All right? And, uh, I actually have started this new workout. I found this dude on, on, uh, Youtube. I fuck, I think I told you guys about them last week. This guy, uh, frank [inaudible], frank Madrano fitness, this guy, he's a Vegan and all he does is, uh, his own body weight and he's absolutely fucking shredded, shredded. So, um, I'm going to try to, you know, I've been eating a lot more vegetarian, but I still, you know, I'm one of those guys, I mean there's no fucking way, you know, I'm still going to have a couple of steaks a month, but I'd like to try to eliminate a lot of that other, I dunno a lot of that. You know what I, this is what I liked about eating vegetarian for two to, I would try to go two days a week and it was hard, man. At first you don't know what to eat, you don't know where to go. You don't know how to make anything of sucks. But

Speaker 1:          00:55:26       uh, the cool thing about eating vegetarian, I would go back to back days, Jesse eaten all Veggie. What was great was it affected my eating the other five days because it, it really, it like reset your cravings and I'm telling you man, like when I get into that fucking sugar salt thing, like back in the day, man, I would go on like, I don't know, I would go on like a two and a half month bender of just eating poorly. I would still, you know, take my dog on hikes and stuff. So, and I never really let it get too bad, but in that two and a half months I put on like fucking 10 pounds, 15 pounds or something like that. And then I'm just, ah, fuck, I got to tell you to get this shit off. And um, that great thing about,

Speaker 2:          00:56:06       okay,

Speaker 1:          00:56:07       or even just one meal a day, if he's just do it all Veggie, it fucking balances you out and you stop riding that rollercoaster. Sugar, salt, sugar, salt, sugar, salt. And I fucking hate going to the gym. I fuck, I don't like working out. I mean, I like it, but I don't, I don't like having to do it because I'm a tub of shit. And, um, I can't recommend it enough if you just start eating that way, dude. If you go veggie two days a week and you go for a walk, ride a bike or do something like that, the fats got nowhere to hide. He's got nowhere to go. It has to fucking leave, you know, and then if you just sort of decent the rest of the week,

Speaker 4:          00:56:52       you know, and I tell you, you know, I saw I'll, I'll fucking, I'll crush a pizza, I'll order a fucking, I'll order a pizza and a fucking slam that I'll make cupcakes, like the twinkle toes that I am. And I lead a bunch of those in that type of ship. But then I do the two veggie days in a row and all of that, it gets settles down again. Like the, it's almost like a fire. It doesn't get out of control. So that has been working for me. And, uh, I've been doing the pullups climbing the rope and the dips in the pushups. And, uh, I just liked that type. I at this point in my life, I just liked doing that better than a throwing the weights around, but I'll always still like doing that because I came of age in the eighties and that was always fun, you know, benching. So what am I going to do? Um,

Speaker 1:          00:57:40       I going to, I'm going to fucking party with the all guys, smoke some cigars, but uh, I am, I'm not a goody two shoes. What I am is I'm somebody who fucking, I already lived the life, dude. I did all of that. Okay. And uh, I'm too fucking old to keep, to keep putting on 1520 pounds and try and take them off. I don't want to look like the fucking horse shell that I saw at the beach today. I don't want to be those people. All right? I don't want to be sitting here with my fucking shirt off with my tits, staring at my fucking toes, you know, eating a bag of crisps. I don't, I don't want to fucking be that guy. All right? You can do that in your 20s have at it, and you can wake up the next day and still fucking be in shape. But I can't do it at my age. So, uh, there you go. Um,

Speaker 4:          00:58:25       I dunno. I rode a motorcycle today. That's about the dumbest fucking thing you could ever do. So is that enough for you? Um, okay. Bill. We'll the military hurt my comedy career.

Speaker 4:          00:58:36       Um, hi bill. I'm an 18 year old standup comedian in Atlanta, Georgia. I started when I was 17 and so far I enjoy it while it can be shitty at times. Um, however, I've always wanted to join the military when I was young and still do to this day, I've been considering joining the army and trying to become a green baret for a long time now after I finished college a, this isn't a decision I made because I played a couple games of call of duty and thought it was cool. I've just always wanted to do something exciting and adventurous. I realized that it's very hard to become one. Uh, oh yeah. I watched that thing on Netflix and that was a, that wasn't to be a green baret that was to be like an army ranger or something like that. I forget what it was like, called like 11 days a health. It was fucking brutal. Um, anyways, he said, I

Speaker 1:          00:59:21       realize it's very hard to become one and there's a chance I might not make it, but I am pretty much training every day and still have another four years. However, if I were to pursue this goal, it would also mean I will not be able to do stand up until I'm about 28 or 30. I would like to continue with stand up comedy once I get back, but I am worried that I might be a little too old to start by then. Any suggestions? Jesus Christ? Uh, well first of all, um, being a comedian is also an exciting life and an adventurous life and

Speaker 3:          00:59:53       mmm.

Speaker 1:          00:59:55       I guess it all depends on what type of adventure that you want to have.

Speaker 3:          01:00:00       MMM.

Speaker 1:          01:00:02       I mean, becoming a green baret is pretty fucking bad ass. And that is a very, very, very small,

Speaker 3:          01:00:09       uh,

Speaker 1:          01:00:12       I guess club to be a member of.

Speaker 3:          01:00:16       MMM.

Speaker 1:          01:00:18       You know, so I wouldn't have a say don't do that. I mean it was fucking guy. I mean, if they're unbelievable, they're fucking unreal. I mean, I was still stupid action movies, these actors flipping over cards and everything. I mean like the true like actions, like those navy seals, the green berets, the army rangers. I mean those guys are, are there are fucking unbelievable. So, I mean that's a,

Speaker 3:          01:00:40       okay.

Speaker 1:          01:00:41       Um, I gotta be honest with you. I don't, you know, I don't see any regret on either one of those, cause I would just, whatever, whatever one you want to do more, I would look, the great thing is you got four years to get through college before you have to make this decision. So I would continue doing standup. I continue doing your workout and uh,

Speaker 3:          01:01:01       yeah,

Speaker 1:          01:01:01       you know, in four years, just figure out, you know, you got four years to figure out which one you want to do, but I can't give you advice like that as far as a, you're 28 or 30. Um,

Speaker 3:          01:01:14       okay.

Speaker 1:          01:01:15       Yeah, I mean that's later than most of you, but you're already doing it now and you can also do it all the way through college and there's nothing stopping you from doing it while you're in the military on your, your, your weekends off or some shit like that. Um,

Speaker 3:          01:01:30       okay.

Speaker 1:          01:01:31       All right. Let's just say if you actually got into the military and you didn't get out until you were 28 or 30, I would say,

Speaker 3:          01:01:38       uh,

Speaker 1:          01:01:40       if that's the situation you were in, what I would do is I would just look at comedians that started late and made it, and that's who I would focus on. Um, I've always done that. I didn't always do that. I learned to do that, so I stayed positive, you know what I mean?

Speaker 3:          01:01:57       MMM.

Speaker 1:          01:01:59       And it really is like, did I, the business that I'm in, the worst thing that you can do was give,

Speaker 3:          01:02:07       okay.

Speaker 1:          01:02:08       You know, the other people, the power mentally to just be like, well, I'm too old. They don't want me. You start thinking that way, then they don't. You just fucking, you go out, you do your shit. And it's, it's really, uh, yeah, like even the way you're looking at this and the way I just realized this now, like it's not what the fuck can you not walk on a stage and take a mic out of a mic stand at 28 or 30, you're going to be a goddamn green. Baret Jesus Christ should probably repelling from a fucking helicopter and come through the ceiling.

Speaker 4:          01:02:41       Um, course you can.

Speaker 1:          01:02:44       Course you can, you can fucking do it. Because what it really is, is it's what you're doing then is you're becoming an artist. Um, and then all that is, is that's just your own personal journey and you're just trying to keep becoming a better artist and all that other fucking crap,

Speaker 4:          01:03:00       um, comes, you know, and if you just keep working on yourself

Speaker 1:          01:03:04       and try and get better and better and better and better, eventually you become undeniable and they got to let you in. That's basically what it is. Or You just go out and you make your own shit and who gives a fuck? And then they'll come over to you. Hey, what do you make an over there? I'm making this stuff. Okay. We'd like to be involved. All right. What's the deal? Well, we're going to own it. Hey, go fuck yourself. Oh, okay.

Speaker 4:          01:03:24       Um, it's been my experience. Yeah. Dude. So you've got four years. So I would, I would continue working out and keep doing the standup in four years. Four years is a long time when you're only 18 years old. So, uh, see what you think in the end. But, uh, those are two very noble, um, you know, uh, uh, goals to try to achieve, I'm not gonna lie to you. I watched that 11 days of hell and just, I mean, I was just wondering if, if, you know, just to see if I can make it through it. If gotta be mentally tough enough, forget about physically the mental where down to those fucking guys yelling at you and the impossible situations that they put you in both as an individual and then in the group dynamic. It's just, it's unbelievable. 11 straight fucking days of that.

Speaker 4:          01:04:13       Um, I would love to do that, but I, I don't, I dunno. I'm enough of a fucking psycho. I wouldn't need to, to, uh, to be in the military, if you know what I mean. You know, especially when we're at war. The last fucking thing I need to do is break one of the only commandments I haven't broken yet. I guess I don't know that I would come back. I don't know that I'm mentally strong enough that if I went to that fucking place that I could somehow come back. Uh, I dunno. Um, I'm out of my fucking mind. So I have a tremendous amount of respect for anybody who successfully becomes a soldier and can handle the demands that are put on you. All right. Okay, here we go. Catholic girlfriend. Hey Aaron burr. Sorry if that history of reference was a little too high.

Speaker 4:          01:05:02       Brow. Oh, he full. Do you mean high brow? Like you'd be like, I don't know who that is. Why? Hi Bro. You know what? I'm not even going to take that person cause you give me making fun of the listeners and making fun of yourself. I have no fucking idea. Um, I love Aaron burr and he was right. Okay. In a Hamilton's a cunt. He knew what he was getting himself involved in. Any fucking lost fucking crybaby. Now he's on the $10 bill. Where's Aaron Burr? Everybody hates him because he won. You know, he's like the original Colby. I'm sorry if that history reference was a little too high brow, but Aaron Burr was essentially the biggest client in the early United States history. Small world. Right.

Speaker 2:          01:05:41       Okay.

Speaker 4:          01:05:41       I would love to hear you justify that he was, he was one of the biggest cons. How about the people out there who are committing genocide on the native Americans? What do you need though? He was a Dick at dinner parties. Agreed to have a dual and had it the fucking balls to walk out there. Any wins because Hamilton was cheating. He fucking quick, whatever they did the quick cocked his fucking gun. So when he brought it up, it was already, he did. Some do. Tried to do some little shady fucking move before he brought it up. Stripe it should it fired. So fuck him. Unfucking real. I'm fucking real. Do you realize if Aaron Berg fucking lost, he would be on the $10 bill and then you would have said that Hamilton's a biggest content. Who the fuck would you be? Do you be talking to that guy in the rangers? Um, anyways, I've been seeing this girl for around six months now and I'm seriously nuts about her. I love spending time with her and can see this relationship even leading to a ring in a few years. Oh, congratulations. But the big problem for me is we're not having sex. She's very religious, which

Speaker 5:          01:06:49       now all the age,

Speaker 4:          01:06:52       she's very religious, which does not bother me because she doesn't care that I'm not extensively. I don't know what the fuck that means. Um,

Speaker 2:          01:07:01       okay.

Speaker 4:          01:07:01       You know what, why don't I look that word up you guys, when you want me to take a guess here, even though I'm not ostensibly I, you know, I can't even guess what the fuck that means. What does that mean? You go twice a year. Can I even spell it? Uh, stents. Well, there it is. It figured it out. Thank you computer apparently or purportedly, but perhaps not actually. You know what God says, why? Why, why do you try to become smart when that's the fucking answer. Um, you know that that's a great line to give a cop.

Speaker 2:          01:07:47       Okay.

Speaker 4:          01:07:48       You've been drinking tonight apparently or purportedly, but perhaps not actually fucking flashlight to they head. Um, to all outward appearances.

Speaker 2:          01:08:04       Okay.

Speaker 4:          01:08:05       So I guess that's a fancy way of saying apparently is this guy a hipster and he's sick of all the hipsters saying, apparently, apparently. Um, where am I? Cause she does not, wait, let me read this now. Now that I, I just learned what ostensively means, which, okay. But the big problem for me is we're not having sex. She's very religious, which doesn't bother me because she doesn't, it doesn't care that I'm not extensively.

Speaker 2:          01:08:33       Yeah.

Speaker 4:          01:08:33       I have to go back and look it up again. I don't understand what this means to all outward appearances. You're not religious.

Speaker 4:          01:08:43       Is this like some fancy way of saying that your mysterious anyways, it's her choice and it didn't bother me for a while, but I guess my fucking hormones are starting to get the better of me. We're both in college right now and come from different backgrounds. She does community service and I'm a Frat shithead. I break it off if I didn't feel as strongly about her as I do, but I'm not sure how much longer I can put up with my most intimate partner being porn hub and a bottle of lotion. Should I tell her how I feel or just quit being a selfish bastard, a selfish bastard? Are My concerns normal or am I being a con? Um, first of all, you're not a Frat shithead if you actually have empathy as far as the stereotype goes, you're actually a very mature person. You seem like you know what you have and you don't want to lose it.

Speaker 3:          01:09:31       MMM.

Speaker 4:          01:09:34       Oh, how do you say I respect your,

Speaker 2:          01:09:38       okay,

Speaker 4:          01:09:39       your religious views, but how does the bearded baby Phil about the occasional hand job, does she know the, you're watching? I tell you, it's not a good thing to only be watching porn and not having sex with somebody. Uh,

Speaker 2:          01:09:59       okay.

Speaker 4:          01:09:59       I Dunno. Are you starting to become more of a serial killer? I have no idea.

Speaker 3:          01:10:05       Hey Nia.

Speaker 4:          01:10:08       You know what I, I gotta I gotta Bring Nia and for this one,

Speaker 2:          01:10:11       yeah,

Speaker 4:          01:10:12       I got to bring her right for this one. Hang on one second. Let me, let me hit pause here.

Speaker 3:          01:10:16       I don't want to hit pause.

Speaker 4:          01:10:20       All right, the lovely near everybody. Hello. All right, here we go. Um, here is the question. So this kid, he's basically, I'm going to paraphrase here so listeners don't have to listen to it again. He's got a Catholic girlfriend. Um, she's very religious. Just to pull the microphone back. You're breathing into it there. Sorry. Sorry. I think I had turned up too much. Um, anyways, uh, you know, Catholic girl, very religious, does not want to have sex before marriage. And he's saying, you know, they've been together for awhile. He loves or spending time with her, can see actually given her a ring in a couple of years, but the big problem is, and not having sex, she's very religious. Um, he's not religious, but she doesn't care. He said it's her choice and you know, to not have sex. And it didn't bother me for awhile, but I guess my hormones are starting

Speaker 1:          01:11:14       to get the better than me. We're both in college right now and I come from different backgrounds. She does community service and I'm a frat boy, shithead Frat Shit. Eddie said I break it off if I didn't feel as strongly about or as I do, but I'm not sure how much longer I can put up with my most intimate partner being porn hub and a bottle of lotion. Should I tell her how I feel? But just quit being a selfish bastard on my concerns. Normal. Or Am I being a cunt? No, you're not being a cunt. I think he's actually being really great. That's what I thought. Yeah. I mean, you should definitely tell your girlfriend, but be prepared but don't play. How does he do it? Because what I would, what I would, if I was in that situation, I would try to say, you know, it's, you know, it's just a hand job.

Speaker 6:          01:12:01       It's just a handy, just a handyman. No, I think you should tell her I was feeling, but I would just walk out with my day. You gonna keep interrupting me. Can you help me out all week? That sounds like something you would do actually. Uh, she'd laugh. Uh, no. I mean, you tell her how you feel, but don't frame it in the context. Like, I'm fucking dying over here. What are you doing to me? Oh my God. Don't make it like a guilt trip. Just say, just, just so you know, I'm, I'm really having a hard time with this because I love you so much and I really want to have sex with you, but I know you don't want to, I don't want to pressure you. They make love I'd rather than sex. Well, however you want to it. Love is gross. No, it's not. It's gross. Make love. Yeah. I mean, I don't know. It's gross. It's just, it's very like old fashion. It's like what you say when you're trying to like be nice about it or something, you know? Yeah. Fuck. You don't want to say that. That's my favorite line in the movie. What? Tom Robinson Bull Durham. We don't fuck a word. Oh yeah. Um, but yeah, just, just tell her and the thing is, she's probably feels the same way. She might be frustrated.

Speaker 6:          01:13:17       He has been looking at Becky, she's been listening to this southern Rep,

Speaker 1:          01:13:24       white and black people in the south. They pronounced in certain words, they just pronounced the beginning with the first couple of letters. Yeah.

Speaker 6:          01:13:32       Yeah. You drop off. Like, if it, if a word, it has like two like syllables. You got to just do the first one to start on a new, uh, but anyway, yeah, just, just, just be honest with her about it. But, but just, you know, make it clear that she knows how much you love and respect her and that's, that's all you can do. But how does he do it without her feeling pressure? She might feel pressure. She probably already feels pressure from society or whatever. So, you know, she's already feeling the pressure, but he just said

Speaker 1:          01:14:07       Tara and be like, listen, I'm not trying to put any pressure on, I'm just telling you where I'm at. Because if he keeps going to porn hub, what happens is with porn is you have to keep going further and further and further down the fucking hall.

Speaker 6:          01:14:21       Well when they finally have sex, she's going to be like, what? What do you want me to do? You know she's going to be freaked out. Cause that's the other thing, you watch too much porn and like porn becomes like your reality about what everyday relationship sex. And so there's all kinds of like, I, it's, I don't know. I mean obviously kill me, but it's like, be careful what that porn shit cause it's awesome, but it will really like put you on another planet if you're not careful about it. And you just start thinking like people should be performing like porn stars and you should be performing like porn stars and you should be able to do all these crazy shit. These people are paid to have sex. That's their job. That's not your job. So just, I dunno, just be careful with that. I just feel it was like, well what the fuck is he supposed to do though? This is the thing you masturbating.

Speaker 1:          01:15:10       Yeah, I know. Thank [inaudible] wasn't around when I was fucking that age. Jesus Christ.

Speaker 6:          01:15:15       How did you watch porn at that age? You would like sneak old VCR tapes from your older brother. Um, no. Like how did you do it with nobody had a porno in my house. No fucking way. We had one VCR in the family room. Fucking watch it. It was impossible. I used to sneak and watch. Do you remember a Emmanuelle? It was like the soft core, like Cinemax show. It was like from Europe, it was from Europe and it was all like soft lighting and it was all about this girl and manual who would have these like sexy adventures. Like she's going on a train to Paris and then like she looks over and you know, she the a guy like bang in the fucking, I dunno, could literally and figuratively,

Speaker 1:          01:16:01       no. Uh, the first time I saw a porno, uh, uh, a buddy of mine had it, buddy of mine got one and we were all on our way out and like five of us just sat there and watched it and then just got up and went out like 17.

Speaker 6:          01:16:21       I watched a porn at a sleep over, but we were like in eighth grade or something. Like she stole it from her dad and it was like a seventies porn. It's always just like everyone's a hairy and it was just this guy. Like it wasn't the ones, the one that I saw I, where'd it go? Me Out?

Speaker 1:          01:16:35       The one that I saw, I swear to God, I swear to God this happened. Okay. The dude who was he, he was working at a restaurant and he was getting laid and he's fucking everybody. And they had this fucking old ugly lady comes in, was giving him shit, you know, make the chicken sandwich and I want extra mayo on it. Yeah.

Speaker 6:          01:16:54       Oh God. Oh No, this is even worse. Can instead of just having a guy jerk off onto the fuck

Speaker 1:          01:17:02       sandwich, I swear to God, you know, or Twista re chicken, you know, you can just buy one that's already made. Yeah, he fucked it. Oh my God, this was an a porno. See nowadays that that would have been considered BCL no, it was considered like they were trying to be funny. I was and they were trying to be like funny cause they play like there's weren't wink apparently this wacky music when he was doing it right. And I was like, you gotta understand. I had never seen a fucking porno. And it went like the first time you saw a need, especially back then where as like, uh, like the most overtly like sexual thing. Like when I was a kid was Brooke shields the one button on a shirt and you know, went from that to watch people actually fucking, and then there's dude's stuck his dick in a chicken that's discussing, remember when we went to go see that?

Speaker 1:          01:17:53       Um, what's that? Quintin Tarantino. It was grind house. It was like the two movies and then in between they had the fake trailers and one of them was Thanksgiving and they show that quick little like two second thing at the end of it of a guy like fucking a Turkey remembering and everyone in the movie theater went through it in like fabric. Like I would not be surprised if they got that idea from that very porno that you watched. Yeah, because back cause I think Eli Roth directed that like trailer, that fake trailer or something. But yeah, that's discussing. Yeah. Like no we're not lacking in. And I remember like the videos. Then after that the video store came out and then the video store, it had the back room with ours. It had those so funny they had these saloon doors. He had to walk through end to get into the back room and there wasn't me being like a beaded curtain in some areas like that was like the sexy area.

Speaker 1:          01:18:43       It was whether it be the current one and I have to, it was so early on I don't think that there was categories. They just had porno. It was all straight porn. Yeah. Growing up in a suburb, right. It was just all straight porn. There was no, there was no like categories like uh, you know, whatever fucking doggy style ones or it's more like, I feel like it's like race or racial identity, like Asian boy agent Paul or have an evil bondage, blah, blah, blah, blah. There wasn't just Debbie, it was just people fucking on camera. That's all it was. It was a man and a woman fucking or man and two women fucking are two guys. Fuck it. A woman and that within the occasional, and then the chicken thing was a bit like it was supposed to be this funny thing and that I had and it was funny because it was the first one I have a solid, I was sitting like what the fuck?

Speaker 1:          01:19:39       Right. Um, but then I was also site cause I actually saw some, I is actually saw porno a we getting bagged and shit and it wasn't until years later, wait a minute, I think I was hanging out, I was still living with Bobby Kelly and we were talking about the first, yeah, the first pornos that we saw. I remember telling that and he was just going, what? And I go, dude, I swear to God. He goes, what was the name? Like I don't know what the name of it was. My buddy just had it. I, but you know, you know

Speaker 6:          01:20:07       who would know, you know, who would know the answer to it is David's [inaudible]. He would know. I bet if you asked them or if we tweeted him and said, do you remember ever seeing a porno from circa whatever year that is. And a guy. If I bet he would know, you realize you just blew up his Twitter account. All right, we're going to end with this dilemma.

Speaker 1:          01:23:37       Hey Bill, would you rather be morbidly obese to the point where just walking around is exhausting? I'm talking over 350 pounds and you weren't allowed to lose the weight. I love that. You already answered or would you rather be stuck in prison for the rest of your life?

Speaker 6:          01:23:54       Oh, God. Stuck president. Rarely. It's a shallow way. Um, I feel like though, hey, easy, easy. If you're 350 pounds or whatever, that's my fault. By the way. I'm not good with the mixture. Oh, okay. Uh, it's like you're already in prison. You're in prison, in your own body. I think they're both prisons, aren't they? I mean they are, but I mean it's like, oh, I see what you mean. No, no, I'm agreeing with you. Yeah. You just had a nice little metaphor there and I ruined it. Um, but I rather be obese. It'd be in prison for the rest. No brainer. Yeah, yeah, yeah. But I can't just make it a fun. You'd have getting that fat. That's the thing. It would be really fun to just be like eating all the good shit that you can't have in prison. They don't have good food there. So maybe I would rather be obese. I don't know. Jesus Christ,

Speaker 1:          01:24:55       you might just, somebody's obese listening to this right now. They're basically, you are basically saying, Gee, I would rather be in prison

Speaker 6:          01:25:00       for the rest of my life to be you. I definitely rather be silly like objective thing that's new for you to get on a plane, talk about it and people shouldn't get offended by it.

Speaker 1:          01:25:10       Get on a plane with your two seats and your giant seatbelt and you can fly anywhere in the fucking world and go get even fatter. Right.

Speaker 6:          01:25:19       Do you have to buy two seats if you're like over a certain weight? What's the weight requirement now? Whenever it is like the Kevin Smith is over it. Right? Cause that's how why he got, he had that whole problem with JetBlue or southwest because they thought southwest. Cause they were like, yeah, you need to buy. I don't think he was that big though. Like two seats big. I Dunno. I've never met him. I met him. He wasn't two seats big when I saw him. Yeah, I dunno. Maybe they're just being decks. Look the only time

Speaker 1:          01:25:53       southwest is a great airline, but I don't like, uh, I don't like all the jokes that they tell. I get it that they're trying to make it lighten it up and with a cool company, but it's like my life is in hands right now.

Speaker 6:          01:26:05       I would, I would. I thought you meant the stewards and this, even that. I don't like being sad. I don't like it either. I've kind of,

Speaker 1:          01:26:12       what I find, I find when you're going someplace, if the person at the top is doing their job right, everybody beneath is also in line and they come off like the rod a line. It seems like the, the vibe on a southwest flight is that this is substitute teacher. I don't like that. You know what I mean? I like, I liked feeling like shit is in order, you know?

Speaker 6:          01:26:35       Have you seen on Virgin Airlines that there's safety video is like this full scale music, video production fucking thing. It's like a little kid that wraps into, there's like a little Asian girl that wraps a little black kid. That's awareness suit. I was like in those break dancers you can't get away from, it's a whole can't get away. I was actually like, I was actually finding myself happy for the people that were in the view that they were got work and exposure on this level and I was, I was like, how much money does Richard Branson have? He really made, I hate the mood light behind the music behind the scenes video of how they made the thing on it. So when Williams or where are you saying you hate the mood lighting? Where on Virgin? Why? What do you mean you walk on and you just going to get an STD on the fucking thing. I Love Virgin Airlines. I love it.

Speaker 1:          01:27:22       That all mine like origins. Cool. I I don't, I jet blue's cool. Jet Blue is good. You get to watching ESPN the whole way across the country. I liked that. I liked being able to watch all my stupid like Bravo, real housewives. I the only airline I really don't fucking like other than the, just the crazy ones that I used to fly when I was starting out. Like that was it. Ata or some shit. Oh, I don't know. All, all trans something. Try and err. Yeah. Yeah. You know the airlines I've flown that don't even fucking exist anymore at this point. We just got swallowed up. Uh, I flew people's express in the age. What is that? Oh, it was like the precursor to value jet man. It was fucking shady. I remember values yet. Um, they had that fire. Um, unfortunately, uh,

Speaker 6:          01:28:11       I need to go back. Um, I would rather be obese

Speaker 1:          01:28:14       eastern airline

Speaker 6:          01:28:15       my, but yeah, my mom has to work for eastern choose to fly. She was a PE

Speaker 1:          01:28:19       anyway. And northwest, none of these exist anymore. None of them are you. They'll get bought out or they went out of business. Uh, wait, can we go back? So got a flight. Franks airline.

Speaker 6:          01:28:30       Can we go back to that? Sounds like like a corner store. Like a place like a deli. Frank's like a deli. Sell hotdogs. I made that up. Rather be obese and free than in a, in exactly apologize to people who were overweight, apologizing. We're in the age of apologize and take a fucking joke. Fatty. But you and your fat shaming. But you know what? The fat, shame, shame, shame, American in the Frat people. Shame is such such a fucked up industry that I would not want it off. You have no, I wouldn't get off your, I wouldn't want to be, I wouldn't want to be in prison. That was, that was a stupid answer. Said that, that was my main answer. We got it. But I admit that, hey, I want to, I'm going to start a new segment on here where I felt shame somebody every week.

Speaker 6:          01:29:23       Cause I know cause I'd make it work. Why don't you shame other people too. Can you shame just shame. Can I finish across the board and I'd finished here? Sure. So the jingles, consider that chain of fools where they go chain chain chain. I'm gonna Shame, shame, shame, boop, boop, boop, boop and other songs. Shame on you. I don't know that I'll have somebody sing the high pod. Yeah, add those cupcakes. You really are just going to go with this idea. No. Your nods. Yeah. Yeah. I'll wait. I'm going to show that it works through that on news. They used to do this shaver, remember? And they'd have this like graphic of a finger pointing and it was the reporters. I'd be like, they would go up to like slum lords that he used to. No, they had their own, they had their own little like jingle.

Speaker 6:          01:30:02       But I'm telling you is that they, yeah, they were like burst into places and say, I hear, you know, we hear that you're charging, customers were bup, bup, bup, and don't you think that's wrong? And they'd have to like get the owners to try to like fess up. I, yeah, it was a finger wagging and that was it. That was it. I don't know if there's a religious nuts out there that can try to like make gay people straight and they're trying to show like that they think that that works. Right. Oh, and I kind of liked those people where I think shaming, I've actually had iPad, that's what they do on the biggest loser. And I thought when they scream at them and make them cry, make them puke. I can't believe somebody just hasn't dropped of a heart attack. I know they've been writing articles about that show and how it's really fucked up.

Speaker 6:          01:30:47       You know, I wa I used to watch it all the time cause I was like, I found a, and you'd sit there and cry with them, laugh and you did a bit about it. I remember because that's, that's what you were talking about how like they had so much fun. Like they're living the life, they're the, they're the real rock stars because while you're sitting there like, you know, eating salads and having to work out, they're just like doing whatever they want and living the life. Oh my God. That was a, wow. That was a while ago when you did that bad. But I used to love that show after awhile I was like, all right, I get it. I get it. I'm over it. But no, I really, I really liked it, but people will have a serious problem. The woman left the show cause she was sick.

Speaker 6:          01:31:26       She was sick of them sweating all over him. She made her money. She's back. I think that last season she's been back. She left for a little, everybody's back. This business is shrinking by the day. There was a homeless on there. All the, all the movie stars are doing TV shows now. I know I want to watch that Halle Berry TV show that I need to want the pilot. Just emotional people are grabbing every dime they can get before my business turns into what the music industry did. You realize how fucking lucky I am that I can, I actually

Speaker 1:          01:32:00       have a live show that I can go on the road. How lucky I am. Thanks fucking Christ.

Speaker 6:          01:32:06       I think like live shows are going to be something of the past because it's like they've been going on forever.

Speaker 1:          01:32:12       No, no, no. I think people will always want to do that. I mean maybe they'll uh, you know, be funny is if is if somehow like what do they call those things? They did that creepy thing with Tupac and Michael Jackson.

Speaker 6:          01:32:25       Oh, the Hologram shit that they're doing like at Coachella and like award shows where like, yeah, all of a sudden two POCs shows up and does like his entire discography. Spencer people tripping their balls off. I know, right? I know. And people, you could hear people when you see footage on youtube, you'll be like, and then they're like, oh wait, it's a hawk.

Speaker 1:          01:32:49       Well I would never say that that wouldn't happen, but I would think at some point you're going to want to leave the house. You're going to want to have to leave the fucking house. But I, I gotta be honest with you, like live shows, if people look live shows would stop. I will tell you this. So I love that movie. I did walk her shame. How at this it's simultaneously released on yeah, I fucking like, I would see more movies if I could just sit on my ass here and pop in God's Zillow or some shit like that. I definitely would. And Godzilla is something that I didn't go see. But if I was sitting at home, I was fucking watched that shit. We still need to go see him. Maleficent is it still in the movie theater? I want to see that movie. Yeah, I did.

Speaker 1:          01:33:35       And now I don't. I was glad cause they stopped showing commercials and I stopped giving a shit. Like I was into it. They got me, they had me rest and all that. I go see that Alison Wonderland looking evil. Which shit, I'll go see that snow white and the seven dwarfs. All right. It's about the evil queen, but yeah, yeah, exactly. Oh it's hurts perspective. When we had Juliana is the, uh, she's, she's the queen and we had a wrong the whole time. Well we get to understand what happened to her and the whole bit and why she's that way. And can I say something about that evil witch she childhood. Tell me about it. Cause her childhood was a long time ago. Okay. At some point it happens in your thirties. You have to stop taking your childhood on, on people and you've got a fucking man up.

Speaker 1:          01:34:21       Okay. So that's what I would say to that, which, okay, can we please go see this movie so we can talk about it then? Is she standing there stirring her fucking steal fucking pot. Whatever the hell she's doing with bat heads in it. Coldron all right. Listen, this podcast is going on and on and on and on.
