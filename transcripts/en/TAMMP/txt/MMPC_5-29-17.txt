You'd be surprised I bet if I could somehow get some sort of lives. You know phones in here I bet my phone lines would be lighting up right now with paramedics fire department people people that drive ambulances is the driver of the ambulance do you actually have to know how to help people are you just like the guy the getaway driver you know all you need to do is not to turn on the siren you won't be able to block it out.

Speaker 2:          00:02:50       You think ambulance drivers hear that siren at night it's a late night quiet bedroom you know trying to put fucking music on cause they don't they're just laying there all year slowly going insane I don't know I'm in a great fuckin mood you know my lovely little Lay is starting to sleep through the night I'm starting to get some sleep again dude she's hilarious she just does this thing now she's trying out a voice she just goes guy like it loud as shit laying in the bed in the morning between me and this just that. It's like fucking a little mini Jerry Lewis. The entire time it's so I just put my hand over my mouth I just I just make it go away I think and then she kind of like looks around like What the fuck was that and that stops for about four seconds before she starts again and then she gets used to the noise and then that's it. She started to crawl she's fucking moving backwards it's funny like that I guess they move backwards first so it's like the thing that they want.

Speaker 9:          00:03:59       It just keeps getting further and further away like that Alfred Hitchcock shot.

Speaker 10:         00:04:06       But anyways I had family from back east out here this weekend which means plenty of booze plenty of fucking crazy food.

Speaker 13:         00:05:27       I think most my material is just about other fucking lunatic parents.

Speaker 2:          00:05:32       I'm telling you what I'm going to start saying to people when they go Oh she's the Oh yeah that's a great H I'll wait wait til 3 days from now then all well you've done she's gonna love she'll and start stabbing you in the night.

Speaker 9:          00:05:44       I mean you don't start saying those parents.

Speaker 2:          00:05:45       I'm just gonna be like you know you sound like a horrible father and I think you married the wrong person.

Speaker 14:         00:05:52       Have a nice day.

Speaker 2:          00:05:58       How you could look at this experience in a negative way is fucking look if you're broke. If you're a kid if you're a fucking high school student right and you know you started banging your goddamn English teacher and yet you didn't know enough to pull out as much as they told you in sex education how much you know how a baby's made you couldn't fucking believe you a bang and your English teacher and the next thing you know you're going to be a fart Yeah. Then then it's brutal. You know if you're married to this fucking old broad is always correct in your fucking sentences. You know.

Speaker 13:         00:06:35       You're calling around for dressing like a whore and she's fucking giving you shit for for a dangling participle whatever the fuck I never knew what that meant.

Speaker 10:         00:06:42       The past participle Bell was a past participle this sentence I don't know. Just send me to summer school just gimme gimme in that fuckin distilled version of this class that is nothing. That dream team of class clowns that is summer school drug addicts and musicians. It was just fucking tremendous summer school. Underrated I tell you. I went. I did it twice. I should have done it all four years of high school but I blew off the last year because what was the fucking point.

Speaker 9:          00:07:12       My sophomore year my teacher hooked me up gave me the D minus D minus and geometry I fucking had a great time. I had a great time I tend to take one class. You don't get me out of bed in the morning.

Speaker 2:          00:07:31       In summer school was combined like three towns where I lived and it was a it was all the class clowns. Just like I said creative people everybody had a D and the level of shit that they gave to the teacher I was like why I got to up my game. These people are on a whole nother level. So when you go to jail you become like a better criminal. I became a better class clown just sit there like well these guys are fucking these guys I have no intention of going to college Emily still lying to myself I think I could you know I think I could go in the later rounds if you were a fucking draft pick.

Speaker 9:          00:08:08       Be honest with yourself you were a high school student What round are you going and do you know and if you really think about it that's why Bill Belichick he doesn't like the first round draft picks because the first round draft picks they like book smart right there the fucking nerds you know you give him some information they'll memorize it and spit it right back at you right there's no passion they they they they don't walk into a room and light it up is a bad analogy because first round draft picks do I guess do they I don't know about college basketball now with everybody one and done you bring this fucking kid to a locker room full of men and put the team on his back bony fucking legs Well Bill what are they supposed to do a lot of them you know it's like their mothers you know they they need a new kidney and the shack they live in is falling the bucket.

Speaker 10:         00:09:03       Fair enough. Fair enough. But selfishly as a fan you know you miss the days when somebody had four years with fucking Coach K or Dean Smith rest his soul.

Speaker 15:         00:09:14       Bobby Knight flip it I mean the chant stopped looking down fucking there.

Speaker 2:          00:09:21       David I've told them before they it much I fucking love that Bobby Knight speech where he says you know I'm not going to you're not going. I'm not gonna walk around with a 40 to 20.

Speaker 16:         00:09:35       I don't know what it is about that guy. Listen to that speech and it makes me want to go fuck.

Speaker 9:          00:09:39       I don't know if I'll go to the gym after listening to that guy. Something happened you know when that guy got ran out of town. That was that was it. You know. Then all of a sudden like guys stared into just literally being pussies like fuck and wearing shirts with cats on him and stuff.

Speaker 17:         00:09:59       You know.

Speaker 2:          00:10:01       My wife was showing me that look there's a men's onesie that's out there now that guy's aware and I was like You've gotta be fucking kidding. Like when is it going to stop. When is it going to steer back to testosterone. When is the guys guy going to make a comeback. I mean everything makes a comeback right. Classic rock disco hair metals make it a little bit of a comeback. I don't fucking know. I just don't get it.

Speaker 16:         00:10:25       And in some ways show me what they were like Sean Connery wore one in one of the James Bond movies and it's like all right. But he wasn't wearing it like he thought it looked good. He wasn't wearing it because it was fucking stupid. You know that's what I can't fucking stand. Everything's like Mark and something else it's like all right. So what do you believe in. What are you gonna fuck him sign your name to and these fucking millennial cunts. Oh I can't say all of them. That's not fair to a whole generation.

Speaker 2:          00:11:00       But so the ones that at least have taken pictures of OK which granted most of these pictures are being taken care taken by older people from my generation who are jealous of younger people. That's what a lot of it is. I bet I bet I'm overreacting when I really think about it. I don't really see a lot of people with cats. On their shirts. Although when they do people take pictures of them then they post them on social media and then old fucks like me start going Oh look these fucking millennials they're fucking. It's a scratch all of it. I mean really Bill. Have you seen anybody with a onesie.

Speaker 10:         00:11:36       Some we just showed you a picture and then you literally started freaking out like you watch CNN or Fox News for two hours. That's always a great thing to do watch those for a couple two three hours and they get you all panicked what you want to do is you want to switch between the two of them right. And then you balance out the lies and you keep yourself level headed. You know fake news tell fake news. So anyways I want to be like that I want to be that guy okay. God bless you millennials. I'm sure this there's plenty of guys guys on the way. You're out there fucking crush an ass. God bless you.

Speaker 18:         00:12:10       Join your youth Joy your fucking youth before it's Memorial Day and suddenly you're that guy with the dad bod standing in front of the grill filling that tightness in your Achilles you know you've got to reach for that last burger in the back of the fuckin grill. You just start feeling that tightness in your ankle you like. If it's going to happen please don't let it happen now.

Speaker 12:         00:12:34       Not in front of my family back east. Nobody has guessed the movie by the way that I am referring to.

Speaker 19:         00:12:43       We had problems with the family back east.

Speaker 20:         00:12:49       This I was gonna say I'd give you a hint but this isn't really hard in my opinion that movie. It's a car movie for me.

Speaker 11:         00:12:58       I just feel like that movie is a car movie. Other people thought there was some philosophical question you know who's to fly who's the windshield. All I remember from that movie was I loved the car. Because I love a fuckin sleek I remember the car that was a sleeper and then I just remembered that there was this one guy. Was having problems with the family back east and that explained his entire fucking backstory that's it now.

Speaker 2:          00:13:36       If you guys can't guess it now I don't know what the fuck. I don't. I don't know what to tell you. All right they had a fuckin pizza.

Speaker 19:         00:13:45       Yeah. Can I get a guy get a sausage in a rubella. We got an old rule. You know me Rubio. Yeah. We had family we planned up the family back east.

Speaker 9:          00:13:55       It will give us a Ruger anyway. So what you guys do this weekend other sit around. You know what I did. I watched somebody tweeted me on the old Twitter and told me are you watching the time trials for Monaco. And here's the thing. I know I'm new to F1. She goes No I can barely remember the fucking names.

Speaker 2:          00:14:21       So I'm like I'm I'm gonna like it. I had no idea like how they qualify for a race. I just thought you know you get like five laps around the track whoever has the best time gets the pole position and then they just work their way back. But that that that is not how it works. It's like a whole other day of racing because I was one like Why the fuck did people show up to watch these these qualifying Remy. Just watch some guy by himself out there. Yeah.

Speaker 21:         00:14:53       Yeah he is gonna be in eighth place tomorrow.

Speaker 10:         00:14:57       That's not how it works. It is the race before the race and it's like there's three race so there's three levels of the qualifying. There's like first of all this practice laps. Get used to the track and if you don't do the practice laps you're not allowed to race so obviously it's probably some safety thing like Dude you're not just gonna fucking go out there and start driving 20 miles an hour.

Speaker 9:          00:15:17       It's this next one a right or a left turn share qualifying OK.

Speaker 22:         00:15:24       So there's just like three rounds of it. So qualifying the first round one. It's like March Madness but with cars it lasts for 18 minutes.

Speaker 2:          00:15:35       Everybody gets on the fucking track. I'm sure they don't turn up they let six out and another six I how fast they do it I miss that part of it OK but it lasts for 18 minutes at the end of which time. Can you tell I'm reading this the sixth slowest drivers are eliminated from qualifying and 16 advance to q t the qualifying 2 so those six are gonna be that then I thought oh my be out of the fuckin race is this like golf or you missed the cut. And I found out later No they just start way in the back. OK so so there's 22 fucking drivers I guess so let's see so six of them are fucking eliminated but I think usually 20 drivers to to not have to go home I have no idea if anybody knows the information to that I don't know if anybody if you don't move to the next round of qualifying if anybody actually doesn't get to race because I thought there was 20 cars in the race and according to this mass there's twenty two or whatever so six or eliminated in the first one then the next sixteen you know after a short break the times are reset and the sixteen remaining cars run in a 15 minute session.

Speaker 2:          00:16:46       So now we're down to 15. And at the end of which the slowest six cars are eliminated from qualifying leaving tend to progress to qualifying three. Now the top ten spots after the race those that that's when you're in the points from first all the way to 10th it's like some like twenty five points for first 18 for second then it's like 15 then 12 10 8 6 4 2 1. Are the points you're in the you're in the fucking lightning round at that point.

Speaker 2:          00:17:24       And then whoever you are obviously has the best run after that gets the. Qualifying three after a further break. Times are reset in the final 12 minutes session is held to decide pole position and the standing order of the top 10 grid places. That's when you're in the points all right. That's when you're going home with least with the fucking year supply of rice a roni. If you're in the top 10. So I watched it because somebody on Twitter is like Dude you gotta watch this. This might be better than the race. So Lewis Hamilton.

Speaker 23:         00:17:55       From the Isle of Man. It's an island with men nothing but men.

Speaker 2:          00:18:02       All walking around like right where the Falcon lays the birds.

Speaker 11:         00:18:07       Whatever the fuck they call them over the flags. Anyways.

Speaker 10:         00:18:17       He's out there he's got Mercedes he's got one of the fastest fuckin cars out there but for whatever fucking reason he's not getting enough downward force or something on the front of his car in the front end is sliding all over everywhere so he barely gets out of qualifying when he gets into qualifying too. And it's there's a 50 minute session and he's outside of qualifying to get to the next level. His time is too slow so he's got time to do one more run. OK now he's in second place overall for the for the to become champ to stand. To stay on pace to be whatever the fuck and best drive with you. I'm sorry guys.

Speaker 22:         00:18:57       I'm new to this fucking thing and his fucking front and starts sliding all over the place and then some cunt hits the wall. So then the yellow flag comes out and I guess that doesn't matter if some asshole drives into the fucking wall.

Speaker 9:          00:19:13       You're qualifying time has done this fucking idiot he's a professional driver.

Speaker 2:          00:19:18       He hits the wall and he hit the wall. I get it. You know they said they actually put some special staring at. They make custom steering just for that fuckin track in Monaco because they're just driving through the streets and they have such a hairpin turn that they actually have to turn the wheel harder than they do at any other race.

Speaker 9:          00:19:34       You know why when they just leave that in when you want to have that option. Case she had to drive all the way around something at some point in the other races. Evidently not.

Speaker 10:         00:19:46       So anyways long story short this fucking guy I think from Force India with the future car just basically you know he pulls the Greg babe Brady you know gotta beat Marsha getting a call closer than a quarter of an inch he fuckin slams right into the wall and then that's it. And Lewis Hamilton was so fucking dejected he couldn't even get out of his car.

Speaker 2:          00:20:05       You know and long story short the fucking Ferrari's a fucked is my god damn computer.

Speaker 24:         00:20:13       Keep doing this to me trying to get the screen to come up can you stay up dog.

Speaker 9:          00:20:19       I sit there fingering the fuckin thing the whole time.

Speaker 10:         00:20:24       Yeah so long story short the Ferrari's won the first and second position. And I think that Brutus guy the finished dude started in third and Lewis Hamilton was all the way back in 14th so he's out of the points and you're driving through the fucking streets of Monaco a sovereign state. In other words they're in France but they're not part of France like you have fuck off. We're doing our own thing here and I guess it's really hard to pass there. But despite that the fuckin race starts. Immediately. He went from 14th to 12th and I'm watching the race and I'm like This motherfucker. He's probably going to finish fourth.

Speaker 2:          00:21:07       He's somehow gonna figure some he's gonna fuck up in the Pit Stop. Something's gonna happen so I'm watching the whole time I'm watching the race and I'm watching and he's 12 and he's 11th then he's 10th and the fucking announcers are blowing it off because they're too busy looking at that what the Ferrari's are gonna do. What the Red Bull teams doing what the fuck are boo tasks he's gonna be doing in the Mercedes and meanwhile he's Lewis Hamilton just moving at this is the longest ever talked about race and it's got to feel people like dude I don't give a fuck you driving around in a circle.

Speaker 2:          00:21:38       No they're not then I try and run there's left and right turns all right there's a chicane. Dude you least gotta watch Monaco you shouldn't watch Monaco with the fucking Illuminati people fucking back their yachts up although I went online and I found like you can actually there's a lot of them were just like packages like those aren't just rich people with their yards backed up there's just a lot of like booze cruises and you can sit there on a fucking yard getting hammered acting like you didn't just light up your fucking credit card whatever Stacey will deal with it when we get back we get baggage. So long story short on a track that you could not fuckin pass on somehow Lewis passed seven fucking people finished seventh so let's see that's 1 2 he got like 6 points or something like that and the Ferrari's came in first and second. All right Sebastian Vettel ended up winning after a great fuckin pit stop and what's his face. Kimi Raikkonen is at his fucking name.

Speaker 13:         00:22:43       Raking in or whatever finish dude Sebastian's the crowd. The German dude he fucking comes out of the pit before he hit Kimi going like What the fuck.

Speaker 25:         00:22:52       He said to like make somebody cut me off in traffic but he's driving like 170 miles an hour.

Speaker 1:          00:22:59       What's his face. Daniel always a bridesmaid never a fucking winner. Ricardo came in fucking third the guy's always on the podium never comes in first he's gotta be pissed like guys what the fuck can you do somebody the car here so I can get past these Ferraris and Mercedes and I want oil and I got a deal here.

Speaker 2:          00:23:19       So long story short Ferrari is a team has one hundred ninety six points Mercedes has one hundred seventy nine and the Americans the Yanks just to let you know we're pulling up the rear. We got our first points of the season what do we got we got Romain like the lettuce grass Gene he got nine points and then Kevin Magnussen like the condoms got five so we got 14 points so just those Ferrari's Mercedes better mind their fuckin p's and q's because the Yanks are coming. All right thank you for fuckin sitting through all of that shit. Let's talk about Tiger Woods. Jesus fucking Christ can you believe he got arrested for drinking and driving.

Speaker 11:         00:24:00       It only happens to nine zillion people every fucking day. I'm so sick of people talking about Tiger Woods like the way they disrespect this guy. You know I love Stephen A Smith but I started watching him talking and he was saying that you know that you know this guy's just his fall from basically his fall from grace.

Speaker 20:         00:24:23       And now his whole you know he became a billionaire and his whole fucking thing was based on the fact that he presented himself as a family man. And I'm thinking like when. When the fuck did he ever present himself as a family man. Did he get to where the fuck he was because he was the best golfer anybody had ever seen because he was making like PGA fucking links look like like he was playing miniature golf. I never pay attention to that fucking Blondie was Why don't you do a fucking name that area.

Speaker 12:         00:25:01       So he bangs a bunch of Hooters whores and then I'm spot then I'm supposed to sit on the couch go on. He lied to me Tiger.

Speaker 21:         00:25:10       I thought after you golf you fucking went down to Applebee's with your family and fucking your family back east and you shared a fucking bloomin onion. I have to be honest with you I never once thought about what the fuck that guy did when he got off the golf course and when I found out what he was doing off the golf course I was like Yeah I mean that kind of makes sense I am to say it's the amount of fuckin men okay when Stephen A Smith walks out.

Speaker 2:          00:25:42       Of his studio you know he doesn't have a line of whores just waiting to fucking blow him just so they can say I blew Stephen A Smith. Tiger Woods had to deal with that. And like most men he folded under the pressure. And the fucking reason why. He's not doing well right now it's not because of his fucking wife who by the way took a bunch of his money bought a house fuck and knocked it down and then rebuilt another one. What about her.

Speaker 7:          00:26:17       I thought she was right.

Speaker 2:          00:26:24       What about her. What about all Blondie right there. I still a bit about this do you think she would even give Tiger Woods a second fucking glance if he wasn't making all that money if he wasn't the greatest at what he did. Would all blond blue eyed even give that guy a fuckin second I don't think she would have.

Speaker 26:         00:26:43       All right.

Speaker 27:         00:26:45       Even when you're a bum like me when you fucking walked in the singles bar back in the 90s what did women always say what do you do. They're not making small talk.

Speaker 28:         00:26:57       Okay women all fucking judge okay. Their status. And then they get a number in their head. All right. And then they find out the jobs okay that earn this and earn that. And then they figure it like who they can fuck. Okay. And then it becomes a thing of like OK you're underneath what I want for the lifestyle.

Speaker 27:         00:27:22       That I'm looking for in the future but you're a good looking enough guy that I'll fuckin bang it tonight. Maybe I'll have a little fling with you. But that's going the end of the fucking day.

Speaker 28:         00:27:32       You know when you slid that piece of paper across the table and you made your offer say my dick and balls bring home this each year they're like Yeah. Keep it moving keep it moving.

Speaker 11:         00:27:44       That's that's ten grand less than I want. And you got that one snagged too. Fuck off. Move on. Who's next. Gad put your junk on the table what's your number.

Speaker 29:         00:27:58       And he has it any is a thing. I don't fault women for that.

Speaker 28:         00:28:03       Who wants to live like a bum. If you're good and if you're good looking enough. OK. And you can land somebody that's making a ton of fuckin money.

Speaker 9:          00:28:12       You can learn to love that right. I don't know.

Speaker 10:         00:28:17       So anyways now he gets busted for drinking and driving. This is the bottom line. This fucking guy's fall from grace. OK.

Speaker 2:          00:28:25       All right I'll give you the first fucking couple of years after his divorce. Like maybe that got in his fucking head but at the end I mean you can't get divorced ten fucking years ago.

Speaker 10:         00:28:35       What happened was was his marriage and his body broke down at the same fucking time. But I just had major back surgeries knees of fucked up. And they always said they said back when everybody thought he was the family band back east that the way that the level of talk and the pressure that was put on his back. They predicted his body was gonna break down and it did. And then when it does you know now they're going to blame you know it's the classic ladies just taking credit. That's all it is. They always take it behind every great man is a good woman. You know they're okay. All right is it I don't.

Speaker 9:          00:29:13       I mean what's your definition of great I mean but every great man is a great woman.

Speaker 10:         00:29:21       It's like the guy was already a fucking champion when he met. So if you're talking about his mother I'll give you that. But this whole fucking thing or now. I mean Jesus I can tell you his mug shot. That's a classic one.

Speaker 30:         00:29:31       I'd like to have a couple of pops of Tiger back alley.

Speaker 16:         00:29:37       Yeah. He needs this is what he needs to do.

Speaker 9:          00:29:41       He needs to hit the fuckin treadmill all right. And he's got to shave his fucking head already. You gotta let that go.

Speaker 2:          00:30:03       God you know it's funny is he looks like he's fuckin wasted. But you know what he's saying he's looking into the camera. Gone well I know a billion people are going to see this. What the fuck are they going to say about this one.

Speaker 31:         00:30:19       I don't I can't even begin to tell you guys.

Speaker 22:         00:30:35       How much do you think they actually talk to Tiger Woods so the death of his father set a battle raging inside the world's greatest golfer.

Speaker 9:          00:30:45       Dish dish. How the fuck do you know why.

Speaker 1:          00:30:49       Because you talked to his gardener said the closest you could get to him an egg and write 400 pages of bullshit.

Speaker 10:         00:30:54       Listen do me a favor don't listen any of this stuff okay. He's a man. He makes mistakes. He's in the public eye. I hope his back gets better. You know what. I hope he goes out like fucking who's that guy used to fucking to sit there. The big deal that put the blonde hair and he's fucking sit there. I think you played Oliver on the Brady Bunch way back in the day. Then when he grew up he became this drunk. He was this alcoholic fuckin he he hit the ball a fuckin mile. God damn it it's gonna kill me I gotta look this up here alcoholic golfer.

Speaker 32:         00:31:32       Driver long and so I search and John Daly there we go.

Speaker 33:         00:32:25       You know guys. I don't know. I don't if you notice the last couple of weeks I've been a little and I've been a little down you know and I know the podcast hasn't been as good as it has been in the past and it's just because you know I feel like Tiger Woods let me down. You know all those times I've never met him or even remotely spoken to him. You know I just really thought we had something there and for him to turn around and go back on his word that he never gave me because I've never spoken with them that just I was devastated and.

Speaker 18:         00:33:00       I'm not going to be able to come into work today. Man I hope that guy wins another fucking Major. I can't even tell you I can't I can't even fucking. I just didn't tell you didn't they. I think I just did tell you last week I was talking about helicopters and you know I know some pilots listen to this fucking thing you know mass pumping all that shit you have to deal with low g pushover with a fuckin semi articulated rotor system does anybody know about these fucking these these new European helicopters that are starting to be available over here and he has a fully articulated rotor system set up to deal with any of that shit and a fuel injected so there's no do I need to pull carb heat. Am I going to fucking die here. I don't know to say gee you I MBA l gamble Aubrey G to.

Speaker 9:          00:33:53       And I wrote next to it what's the deal.

Speaker 2:          00:33:58       I talked to two of my instructors one of them said hey that's pretty cool that they do that. The other one said Well it's kind of like remember when the first iPhone came out because they're brand new. Then they had to work all the bugs out. He said they learned about aircraft through people crashing.

Speaker 18:         00:34:13       That's right. Fuck those things. Then anyways you know. You know I was thinking. I think one of these days when I would do it I'm just gonna buy a used Apache you know or whatever the fuck they have those black hawks is some shit I'm just gonna learn how to fly that and then I'm just going to join those Blackwater dudes. That's my apocalypse thing. You know what I mean. I'm not gonna learn how to kill people. I think like that I'll just be the shuttle guy. I'll take you back from the frontlines back to base base camp and I'll just sit there eat my soup. That's my game plan. All right let's read some of the fucking advertising here for this week which of course I didn't even did even look this shit up yet. No I didn't. I apologize for this. You know I just it's just Tiger Woods let me down.

Speaker 13:         00:35:08       Since Michael Jordan's acceptance speech at the Hall of Fame when I found out who he really was I mean I was devastated and I just remember all those times I had not hung out with Michael Jordan or ever talked to him.

Speaker 9:          00:44:11       OK. ALL RIGHT. LET'S READ THESE FUCKING let's read these fucking questions here. All right. Europe Hi.

Speaker 2:          00:44:22       That's it. I like it short and sweet. Been a huge fan of Bill for many years. Are there any plans for a touring Europe specifically the Netherlands. Would love to see him perform live. Well I was there last year man if you were a fan for many years you should have checked my Web site. I think I'm going to go to Europe next year.

Speaker 18:         00:44:42       And I'll probably build it around a couple of F1 races possibly I don't know what I'm going to go over there but I'm definitely due to do a run I've got a bunch of new shit but you know I have to make sure it's at a certain level before I go over there because Europe loves to just have critics show up at shows without you know the artists saying hey can you review this show you know and they review it anyway and they take out their fucking goddamn steak knives and they cover up every fucking time. So I always make sure I'm on my game here.

Speaker 10:         00:45:13       All right girl who stabbed boyfriend isn't walking free. OK here we go. This is the new this is new part of the podcast everybody fucking correct and old Bill you know. That's why I made sure to fucking look up all my my F1 shit you know cause you goddamn cunt girl who stabbed boyfriend I have a prediction about the Red Sox too by the way which I will get to later on hopefully if I remember.

Speaker 13:         00:45:40       All right that's a teaser and I might let you down I might disappoint you like Michael Jordan like fucking Tiger Woods you know all that entertainment that they gave you when they watch when you get to watch them doing things that have never been done before. All right girl who stabbed boyfriend isn't walking free. Okay so this story was about some lady at Oxford two fucking. I don't know what the hell she did she stabbed her boyfriend in the leg with a bread knife and blah blah blah blah blah. And I think I was like Well I know you have. You know you have all this fucking you know potential and all this type of shit. So this person. This person is writing back saying she is going through what's.

Speaker 1:          00:46:23       I realize you like to make the excuse that we shouldn't expect you to do any actual research on stories you talk about and that's fine. Well then you should leave it at that sir.

Speaker 2:          00:46:34       But in this particular story you ranted on Thursday's part. I didn't rant. I'm joking around. You're fucking overreacting cunts. Do you guys understand what a rant is. Read to me is short for ranting and raving so you've got a borderline have froth coming out of your fucking mouth. Joking around about a subject for five minutes is not a fucking rant is stupid fuck.

Speaker 35:         00:46:57       God damn it.

Speaker 9:          00:46:59       All right. So even like right there.

Speaker 2:          00:47:03       To me that's just I just fucking fucking wigged out for a second there. But a ray rant. Ok. On Thursday you didn't even you didn't even need to do research to see how wrong you were again.

Speaker 15:         00:47:15       I'm not wrong. I'm being funny. Fuck that Oxford girl isn't getting off free because she's white. Oh my God. As the lovely Nia proposed and not because she's a woman as the freckled BA literate bird suggested she isn't getting off at all in fact.

Speaker 1:          00:47:33       It's said right in the article you reading that she was going to be sentenced in September and has been giving a restraining order.

Speaker 2:          00:47:41       Yeah I saw that and I also read the fucking judges quote.

Speaker 1:          00:47:46       I looked it up and I read along with your pockets. Sentencing was only postpone. She isn't getting out of jail time yet.

Speaker 2:          00:47:54       Yeah but don't you find it fucked up what you can address the fact that the judge said You're so talented I don't wanna derail your fucking what you could possibly achieve.

Speaker 16:         00:48:02       You don't think that's weird for him to say that you don't think race and gender affects your sentencing.

Speaker 22:         00:48:11       You don't think that you don't think that any day that there's all this racism there's all this sexism and all that but in the court of law there isn't. There isn't status there isn't you're at Oxford versus you're just somebody on the street you stab somebody with a fucking knife. You don't think that any of that comes into play sir. So anyways he says if you ask me which it didn't I think this is a good thing. If she is as bright as the people at the schools say she is she can definitely do a lot of good in her career. In sentencing her for a one off would ruin that. So you're agreeing with this guy.

Speaker 2:          00:48:48       Oh my God this is fucking hilarious. You're sitting there saying that I'm not. That's basically what it is. It's not that I was misinformed.

Speaker 9:          00:48:57       OK.

Speaker 2:          00:48:58       It's that you agreed with the judge. He said that being said she needs to be held responsible. So what is it. Seeing as if it was only a butter knife I think mandatory anger management classes is an order at the very least. Thanks and go fuck yourself.

Speaker 22:         00:49:16       Come back to Madison. You were great last time. Go fuck yourself again sir.

Speaker 36:         00:49:20       She stabs somebody with a knife.

Speaker 22:         00:49:26       Let me let that sink in.

Speaker 2:          00:49:27       She stabs someone with a fucking knife but because she goes to Oxford and she could be a doctor you're out of your fucking mind.

Speaker 37:         00:49:39       You're just like the judge you're like oh look at her she's a girl she's doing so well in school she looks like me.

Speaker 21:         00:49:50       It was just a bread knife. You're doing what they're doing.

Speaker 1:          00:49:55       In a perfect world sir. Stabbing somebody with a knife and the punishment is stabbing someone with a knife. In the punishment. And that's fucking it. Go watch said fucking trap car thing or whatever the fuck they call it with a pocket down in the fucking poor neighborhood.

Speaker 16:         00:50:09       They rest one black eye after fucking another I mean that's they're not trying to help anybody. You don't think anybody down there has potential. You just gonna say it's gonna fucking do that to them. Why do they just do why they don't why don't they do than a fucking white neighborhood.

Speaker 2:          00:50:32       Mike I don't know. I don't I just don't see the world the way you do sir. And you see it the way that judge does. And I also think that you are like what you're taking into consideration which is is the fact that she's at Oxford and she could be a doctor. You're completely and you're now downplaying that she stabbed someone and yes you are sir. Yes you are because you said she should take anger management classes at the very least like you might call me fucking overly liberal but if you stab someone you should go to jail. Regardless of what your potential is Do you realize that this woman if she becomes a surgeon will have a knife in her hand every fucking day of her goddamn career just about and it won't be a fucking butter knife.

Speaker 1:          00:51:19       Jesus fucking Christ and when she goes to cut somebody open and then finds out that they have state insurance rather than private What the fuck is she going to do then just because you go to Oxford doesn't mean you couldn't be a fucking lunatic.

Speaker 9:          00:51:33       You don't know me.

Speaker 1:          00:51:35       And people in those schools commit murders and they do commit crimes but they don't go to jail the way poorer people with more of a tan do. I don't know if you've noticed that. So for us to bring up the fact that she was a woman and that she was white. Was not we were not uninformed. We're actually more than I actually you know I'm going to pat myself on the back I'm more fucking enlightened than you are.

Speaker 2:          00:51:57       OK. Because I'm not saying that because of who she is. She should get punished more.

Speaker 22:         00:52:02       She should get the punishment I think once you stab somebody. What the fuck you doing in the rest of your life is out the goddamn window.

Speaker 11:         00:52:13       And I know you guys don't say what they do that they do that all the time they fucking take into consideration if people have children and blah blah blah blah. Yeah I know they do but the consideration is a lot smaller. By the level of tan you have and whether you have a dick hanging between your legs or not. And that's the fucking truth. Go into a bar. A woman can slap a guy in the face. Dump a drink over his fucking head. She's not getting kicked out. She's not if she's if she's hot she's a fucking wildebeest Yeah. Throw her out in the fucking dumpster.

Speaker 22:         00:52:50       Come on people this isn't this isn't new information. All right. Stop acting like Good Lord. All right. Why airlines lost their privilege.

Speaker 9:          00:52:58       Hey Bill.

Speaker 2:          00:53:00       Big fan. Love your podcast you recently ask why airlines are not as prestigious as it was in the 70s as a pilot.

Speaker 12:         00:53:06       I have an answer for you I love when the pilots write in Sky Pilot why is it still great in 1978. Hah. I'm Jim McCone Jimmy Carter signed the airline deck deregulation act.

Speaker 13:         00:53:25       Leave it to a peanut farmer from Georgia to ruin the fucking prestige of airline train travel.

Speaker 31:         00:53:30       Prior to this law the government allowed equal usage of federal airways among all the airlines. All right. You're he lost me. Maybe this law the government allowed equal usage of federal airways among all airlines so the only way for airlines to compete effectively was with good customer service. OK. After the law went into effect airlines were able to bid for exclusive usage of certain airways airways are basically the streets in the sky so different OK. Oh I see so then and everybody had their territory so is like. That's right. There was Eastern Airlines. They just flew there. OK. All right. American and United flew cross country. So it's like wrestling. Back in the day where everybody had their territories and then rather than having one guy dominate the whole thing like Vince. It became a bidding war. OK. After the law went into effect airlines were able to bid exclusive usage of certain airways so airways essentially gain monopolies on most of their routes with customers having little or no say in which airline to take the airlines were able to get us by the balls. So now airlines business strategy has shifted from good customer service to monopolizing their airways and packing as many people as possible into their plane planes. Hope this helps.

Speaker 1:          00:55:00       It started too. What should I look up I should look up the Airline Deregulation Act now that all of a sudden in the era of fake news I'm being suddenly being held accountable for what the fuck I say.

Speaker 10:         00:55:13       I can't believe this. You guys are so disappointing me. Can somebody please write in and mock these fucking assholes all right. Not saying that the pilot here. All right. Airline Deregulation Act airline D Regulation Act Jimmy Carter.

Speaker 9:          00:55:34       And effects. Let's see what we got here. Oh my God. All right. Whiskey.

Speaker 10:         00:55:41       The law that changed the airline industry. That's the one that looks like OK this is the one I will read up on. Are you guys going to try to make me informed and then I'll deny you know what happens when you know arms become uniformed he become an arrogant ass you know you start smoking a pipe you fuckin eyebrows are always trying to touch each other as you wrinkle up you for her. No one wants to be around that all right. A law that changed the airline industry beyond recognition. 1978 okay before deregulation airlines competed on service alone as fares were regulated by the government. I didn't know that. I mean granted I was fuckin 10 years old 1970. Many remember this era. Finally is the golden age of aviation. When stewardesses.

Speaker 22:         00:56:30       As flight attendants were then known carved I can Chateaubriand on rolling silver carts and airlines put P.A. lounges in upper decks of their Boeing 747 as passengers dressed up to board flights and flying was glamorous and exciting and mainly for the rich. That's why the Liberals deregulation resulted in the rise of a new kind of airline. The low cost carrier El Sisi at the time of deregulation Southwest Airlines was a small regional airline prevented by CAIB rules and what that is. From flying outside of Texas today Southwest is the largest domestic US carrier in terms of passenger traffic something no one could have foreseen in 1978. Yeah.

Speaker 9:          00:57:22       That's back when stewardesses were fucking hot.

Speaker 38:         00:57:26       So now it's a bunch of animals they pack us all in and then it's just like yeah the heart is like oh fuck this I'm going to go sell jello shots at a goddamn one of those deejay shows where baby baby. Wow wow wow wow wow.

Speaker 21:         00:57:39       Right. Southwest is a success story but deregulation allowed.

Speaker 2:          00:57:44       Yeah I hate flying Southwest. I fucking hate it you know why I hate how the stewardesses sit there making jokes and fucking around it's like dude my life is in your hands here. You're not making me more relaxed doing your fucking Dean Martin impression. But deregulation allowed airlines to innovate new business models people people express. I remember that number ValuJet that one went down people express may have come and gone. May someday be revived but in others like it shook up the white glove world of the US airline industry and democracies travel hub I said that right. We may peer through our rose colored glasses and yearn for the days of Chateau bring all in piano lounges but ultimate companies like Southwest and newer ones like Spirit are allowed more people to fly more often.

Speaker 15:         00:58:39       Yeah. And now look at the result. You got people with no shoes on walking into the bathroom. Oh my God. It all came full circle.

Speaker 2:          00:58:49       Holy shit do I like being informed. Deregulation left the international carriers like Pan Am in Braniff and to a lesser extent TWC TransWorld Airlines without robust domestic feeder networks. What that means and it allowed domestic carriers like Delta Airlines to apply for international routes.

Speaker 31:         00:59:10       Pan Am and Braniff scrambled to create domestic networks but ultimately were unsuccessful. Although it took until 2004 TWC to be absorbed into American Airlines some argue that massive consolidation of the US airline industry in the last decade which has resulted in three large carriers for when Southwest is included is deregulations final act. The network carriers that survive Delta United and American learned to be tough competitors and combined existing domestic networks with the international networks acquired in large part by carriers like Pan Am. That didn't make it. Get the fuck out. So now they have to drag people off flights barefooted lunatics and then you got people fucking you know you ever see those people that just fly around the world all the time trying to get Miles and shit just created all these bottom feeders.

Speaker 2:          01:00:05       Wow do you think a VIP airline would would make it I wonder you know in this era of Donald Trump if they just they if they didn't even try to be nice just be.

Speaker 9:          01:00:19       I wish I wish I could do a Trump impression should be a lot of animals flying barefoot of here. And then you know all the liberals have no idea why you saying it barefooted people shouldn't be allowed to let it be your feet a bare feet.

Speaker 2:          01:00:35       Too Can you. What if what if they had a fuck that you couldn't do it nowadays if you had a fucking top line airline.

Speaker 31:         01:00:45       Okay all first class seats all hot stewardesses.

Speaker 27:         01:00:50       You know first of all all the fucking you know all the fucking feminists would be up in arms would all be up in arms saying that they your objective flying these women blah blah blah blah blah.

Speaker 11:         01:01:03       And at the end of the I don't know I agree with some of that feminist shit but a lot of times I just feel like it's women who aren't good looking.

Speaker 2:          01:01:11       Hating on good looking women and just being mad that could look and women don't have to work as hard.

Speaker 9:          01:01:17       You know it's like that whole thing that you're going to somehow get people to give.

Speaker 2:          01:01:23       Not as good looking women not as good looking man not as strong men like a chance it's not how it works you got to like you gotta look at it like sports and realize that you're not the Jordan you're not Sidney Crosby all right. You're on the fourth line OK so what you have to be is you have to be a fucking you've got to be a gamer. You know. This is coming from a bald redheaded male so go fuck yourself. If you think I'm being elitist here. OK you got to be scrappy you've got to go in the corners. All right you've got to drop the gloves every so healthy you gotta do that. OK. You're not going to get the calls you're going to have to work 10 times fucking harder than other people to get you know half as much over the expression goes but it's gotta make you stronger. You know what's great is your fall from grace from your youth. 6 As you slide into a four is not that bad. But at the end of everybody's life everybody looks like a 4 or 2 OK. But you have a nice soft landing you do a little bit of a belly flop you get the wind knocked out here between 20 and 60. All right these fucking tense I mean they've fallen off the top of a goddamn building. OK then a lot of them they don't survive it.

Speaker 31:         01:02:38       They don't if you look at their botox faces they look like they landed face first the fucking lips are all swollen. I mean Jesus Christ look at these fucking near watches this show and these women will not stop taking fat from the back of their arms and injected him in their ass and they've got these stupid looking fucking asses now and their legs look like my legs with this weird like they look like ostriches.

Speaker 22:         01:03:08       I don't know why they did that I just I just don't fucking understand why they get what point it's like they're literally like Michael Jackson where Michael Jackson couldn't see what he's doing to his face these women cannot see what they're doing to their asses I don't understand it.

Speaker 2:          01:03:24       So anyways you know it was actually fascinating and I make fun of the fact that I'm not a well read guy because it gives me license to be lazy and that's what I like to do best. OK but if you fucking assholes are going to keep reading I did I did enjoy that I do enjoy I like drums shit I like aviation I like that type of shit all right. So if you're going to fucking really start hold my feet to the fire here. Could you please try to keep it. Well I guess I have the power right I have the power. Where I can actually decide.

Speaker 13:         01:04:00       What the fuck it is that I want to read or what I don't want to read. Speaking of which for some reason I woke up this morning thinking about Roy Haynes and the fact that he's still alive and still doing gigs and all the fucking people he's played with. Like I saw a bunch of great jazz drummers before they passed. I saw Max Roach I saw Tony Williams. I saw Louis Belson.

Speaker 10:         01:04:21       And I saw Roy Haynes. I saw Roy Haynes like 20 something years ago and he's in his 70s is now 92 and I looked it up like this guy's still on the road.

Speaker 9:          01:04:28       He's got a road gig coming up in September. Like the Blue Note in New York City he's from Roxbury Massachusetts. Fellow Boston guy I'm a suburb guy. He's actually in Boston but I don't think that's pretty fucking cool the guy's still gigging out there. Manitoba guy he played with Charlie Parker Miles Davis Sarah Vaughan Chloe all the way up right up through like young people today.

Speaker 10:         01:04:57       The guy's been playing drums professionally for 70 goddamn years. So I don't know if you're into drums you've got to go see that guy. All right. Let me go.

Speaker 36:         01:05:05       We read some more of the All right.

Speaker 2:          01:05:10       Let me read these last two cultural appropriation. Dear Billy rationale. Things are getting crazy these days because of technology it's definitely a lot easier to be critical of what everyone does. I'm sure you've experienced this before where people try and misrepresent what you say for whatever self-serving reason they may have. Yes of course that would be the Huffington Post. One of the things going on today that really bugs me is the accusation of cultural appropriation. I hate picking extreme sides to any arguments so I will say I do think that there are cases of cultural disrespect. Let's say someone wears a religious or cultural garb and is overly disrespectful for the purpose of trolling that could be that could be cultural appropriation. You put that in quotes. So do you not think it is but almost everything anyone does is derived from another culture in some respect. There is a YouTube video where a young black college girl berates a hippie for his cornrows and it seems a bit silly because the kid is just doing what every other walkies who listen to fish do. I don't know what a wookie is.

Speaker 9:          01:06:22       There's somebody into Chewbacca now. Fuck now I got to look this up. What the fuck is a wookie a white something wookie meaning slang.

Speaker 39:         01:06:37       A wookie urban dictionary a wookie a wookie is a hairy yet modernised human being that commonly is seen in the western in the western most regions of Washington a gentle creature by nature but tends to get a little erratic when it overindulge itself with its favorite foods its diet consists mainly of a blend of barley and hops. If you see these creatures be cautious as to whether you should provide him with these items they will commonly respond to the name of Richard Pulliam but be very wary of these creatures. I have no idea. They're usually um remember a certain brand of cookie that is very chewy.

Speaker 22:         01:07:25       A wookie is a lifeless idiot whose whole existence consists of falling around jam bands.

Speaker 39:         01:07:30       Here we go and not showering or shaving when they're not panhandling or trying to rip people off. They're selling veggie burritos a grilled cheese to fund their useless existence. They stand for nothing and care about nobody else. Not to be confused with a hippie AP As someone who lives a certain lifestyle due to their belief 50s often shower and have jobs used in a sentence shows yo those walkies over there are trying to sell beat rolls. That's from fucking 2003. So I guess they've been around for a while.

Speaker 13:         01:08:03       OK all right let me get back to that. OK so now you know what a wookie is and what a wookie is and I know about airline deregulation and now I'm going to be insufferable the next fuckin social event is I try to work both of those into the conversation.

Speaker 9:          01:08:18       Where the fuck is it I was an anthropology major.

Speaker 1:          01:08:23       Which doesn't make me an expert but it definitely informs my opinion of this. I went to culinary school after college and learned even more about cultures through their food. I came up upon this article and wanted to get your take upon it. Take a couple girls in Portland Oregon started a food truck selling Mexican food. They traveled around and learned recipes the way every chef I've ever known has done. They were accused of cultural appropriation because they're not Mexican. I'm not going to go on a tirade of mother fucker mother fucks but my adrenaline really starts going when I think about this. I haven't heard you speak about cultural appropriation yet and wanted to get your take. Here's a link. Oh the Huffington Post. What a fucking surprise. Thanks for your podcast. You're a great dad and husband.

Speaker 9:          01:09:11       How do you know that you have no idea. I hate the fucking Huffington Post.

Speaker 2:          01:09:17       They're always trying to stir up some shit. You know I hate all these organizations that try to act like they're their news organization and you read two articles and you know who everybody on the website voted for essentially. It's like back in the day like it was supposed to be. No fewer journalists you were supposed to just sort of present what the fuck happened not making up. If you say this. That's probably because you're doing that. That's like that whole fucking web site and I shouldn't just single them out. There's a bunch of them out there and but they're held in like this esteem. I just don't understand it anyways. Cultural appropriation is I don't fucking know. You know look if you if you have an appreciation for Mexican food you still learn how to cook it and then you sell it. I think at that point if you become successful that's when people get annoyed by it. And college kids are really extreme. In their thoughts as I do you know you're fucking breaking free of your parents.

Speaker 22:         01:10:20       You know when you got some anger issues probably towards your parents so you're very you're very open to radical fucking sort of ideas.

Speaker 2:          01:10:31       You know going all the way over here all the way over there it's a very dangerous time in your life because you make very extreme judgements snap judgment calls with your young brain as I did and that can cause you to do stupid shit like join cults. Blow yourself up at a fucking concert you know for some stupid fucking cause.

Speaker 9:          01:10:59       All the way to like I don't know what fucking without a condom you know you just it's pretty fucking wild thing.

Speaker 2:          01:11:07       This is why I don't talk about shit like this. I don't know what a cultural appropriation is. I don't know what it is. I know is that my culture is the matrix. So everybody's allowed you know I don't get upset when people get on airplanes B.A. that's some white shit you know.

Speaker 1:          01:11:29       I would say that if they're two white girls being white and they're making great fucking Mexican food good for them but if they're sitting there wearing a fucking sombrero and talking like speeding Gonzalez when they do it. Yeah. Then I would get upset but you know there's plenty of Asian infused this and French and fuse that and cultures to me and all of that shit to me. It's like. It's like the MMI how is how was like How good were the martial arts when it was you would just want discipline. You know everyone I I I am a Kito I am fucking taekwondo I do karate I fucking box or whatever. And then a guy Bruce Lee comes around he's like I'll take a little dance I'll take a little of that wasn't he doing that you know. And then he was teaching it to fucking the round eyed guys over here and everybody over in Asia is like hey that's our shit. Don't be showing it to their shit and now look at it now look how great the fuckin fighters are.

Speaker 2:          01:12:30       You know what I mean. I would love to see Bruce Lee today if he beat him back then if he got into the fuckin ring you know what I mean. Did he ever have to deal with a double legged takedown what would happen to him. Does he have a ground and pound defense ground and pound didn't exist. Could that man fight on his back.

Speaker 1:          01:12:48       That's how much it's progressed so I feel everything should get all fuckin mixed up and then shit spins out of that easy just like I think it's just when you start to act like you're the thing that you're doing.

Speaker 9:          01:13:02       You know what I mean like people do.

Speaker 1:          01:13:05       But the thing is is if you start getting into like like whatever Japanese cuisine OK or you get into anime or whatever I'm watching this anime show like I just watch it and I appreciate it. I don't start walking around with the rising sun fucking T-shirt and I get some swords criss crossed on my walls you know starts sitting on the floor and a pillow with a little short table. You know what I mean. I mean where I don't know I don't know where you are. I think it's all how you do it. I mean I walk into an Asian person's house and they've got a bunch of shit from Ikea.

Speaker 15:         01:13:43       I don't go like you know you're appropriating my culture.

Speaker 2:          01:13:47       What's what that L shaped couch but they're also not a pressing me and I'm not pressing anybody. But overall the fuck and you know a longtime concept to top. Ah so that's what it really comes down to it really. I think it really comes down to why people get held to that standard of of cultural appropriation because you know we can the damage we can do and we can be really ignorant with it and then other times people are just being country like I'm not going to read this fucking article but if it's just a couple of white chicks make Mexican food they're crushing it you know and they're dressed like White Chicks going like Oh my God who wants a burrito.

Speaker 1:          01:14:27       I don't think there's a problem with that if they're killing it right.

Speaker 9:          01:14:30       It's a fucking food truck fill your pie hole up and shadow. All right girlfriend Hey man what's up.

Speaker 2:          01:14:40       I just we had a few questions. Sorry for the lack of punctuation. We'll use parentheses when he said that. I flew this girl out all the way to Japan. You know something. Fuck you I'm not reading this shit. You this you want you rewrite this fucking thing. You rewrite this fucking thing okay. And then I'll read it. Go fuck yourself. Sorry for the lack of punctuation. Yes I am not fucking pregnant. There you go. I draw the line at lack of punctuation.

Speaker 11:         01:15:10       I hate when people fucking go. Sorry if you're sorry you would've taken the time to to put some shit in there. You didn't. You're not sorry you're fucking lazy so fuck off. Now I'm going to be lazy right back to you and I read your goddamn shit. However if you want to fix it put some punctuation in and I will read it. God damn it I will read it all right. The Red Sox were in second place and the evil empire Yankees are in first place. Those evil mother fuckers with all their homegrown talent. And here we are the young upstarts with a 250 million dollar team just doing anything we can to try to keep up with them.

Speaker 2:          01:15:49       I want to know I want to fucking know because I already lost a bunch of weight. I know we end up getting fucking hurt again. I want to know when Pablo's coming back. I don't know why I just feel like he's going to have a great second half of the season.

Speaker 28:         01:16:01       Pablo Sandoval and he's going to earn his goddamn money. I think the Red Sox are good they're gonna catch fire here right before the All-Star break and it's gonna be Yankees Red Sox Yankees Red Sox.

Speaker 40:         01:16:12       It's gonna be great again it's gonna be fucking hilarious because now we're the fucking evil empire that could spend it to win a fucking million dollars. That's my prediction. It's gonna go down to them.

Speaker 11:         01:16:27       And ESPN will blow the Yankees because they have homegrown talent and they will fucking trash the Red Sox for spending all this fucking money like they never trashed the Yankees when they did it back in the day because that's how it works because when the Yankees win the World Series ESPN goes in all is right in the baseball universe. It's just like Oh so you guys are all Yankee fans there. Why does it make it right. I never understood that that they play favorites like that but I guess that's what they do. So you know what. Fuck them fuck you too. Have a great couple of days I'll check in on you on Thursday.

Speaker 20:         01:17:07       Be careful around those grills you have fatties.
