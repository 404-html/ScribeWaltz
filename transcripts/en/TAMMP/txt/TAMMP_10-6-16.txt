Speaker 1:          00:00:01       Hey, what's going on? It's bill burn. It's time for the Thursday afternoon. Just before Friday. Monday morning podcasts and just checking in on you. Just chicken and Anya chicken in Anya.

Speaker 2:          00:00:13       Jay help man. I need your help. Guess what I have, I have the iPhone seven.

Speaker 3:          00:00:18       Oh

Speaker 2:          00:00:21       yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:00:22       Well what are you going to comicon bill? What do you, when you got, what do you got all of the latest technology for? I'll tell you why I was fucking

Speaker 2:          00:00:30       making some God damn fucking potatoes and I had my fucking iPhone to the side on the sick and water splashed around and it got in, it got in it somehow and then the thing just went below a hoe. Just fucking shut off. Right as I realized it, I thought I, you know the fucking counter tops. I didn't see it. I fucking set it down. This little was in a rush fucking, you know, peel potatoes like a fucking God damn Mick. I Dunno what the fuck I was doing. And I looked over and watched a couple of dishes and I always lose sight of where my phone is. It was near the sink and there was water from, you know, all of those pots and pans and stuff, sprays and it was just sitting in a fucking puddle and uh, and my wife was just like,

Speaker 1:          00:01:14       shut it off, thrown in a bag of rice, you know, it was like mash,

Speaker 2:          00:01:19       the happy ending and the thing just fucking died. And, uh, I didn't save any of my contacts, you know, I, I didn't have, I have had zero phone numbers. I lost all my photos and all my video for my European run, my trip down to a mall fee. I lost fucking everything, all kinds of shit. I lost a picture of my fucking Ludwig Drum Kit when I played at the Roxy and I just did shit that I lost. I didn't even want to fucking think about it. And uh, but you know what, most of it, I forget anyways, it's like all that clutter that you got your fucking house, all the magazines you saving, you never get to go back to them. You know, if somebody actually snuck in your house and took half of it, you know, other than the space, you wouldn't miss it, right?

Speaker 2:          00:02:01       So this is my thing. I know a lot of you guys would think, oh well why don't you just put it on the iCloud? And she says, well, you know, uh, I don't know if I said this because I had to start this fucking thing twice. Yeah. I don't want somebody at fucking, I just don't want somebody else having my shit. I mean, is, is that so what can you fucking imagine like back in the day, if somebody, older people, you remember when you had your little black book, all your fucking phone numbers member, all your family photos, your slides, can you imagine if some corporation guy will hold onto these, should be there? Fuck you, will you Weirdo? What are you doing with them? So, and the reason why I never backed him up to my computers because I could never figure out how to do it. I mean, I, I googled it and all that shit and says, go, go in the iPhone section of your iTunes. Click on the Info fucking tab. I can't wear it. I have no fucking idea where it is. I've looked up on all these things. There's no video of it. Does all these Shinay had to go iPhone to iPhone? I found an ad iPad asked the fucking, they've got everything except pop for me to put my fucking phone numbers in the contact book, which I could do a few phones ago.

Speaker 2:          00:03:09       I know you guys think I'm a fucking moron. I know you think I can't read. I know you think I suck at reading out loud and you know what? You're right, but I'm not at the age where I used to know how to do shit. Now I don't. Okay. Give me a little bit of credit. I'm only 48 years old. I'm at 78 88 that's when that shit creeps on. Okay. I knew how to do this shit. It used to be fucking easy. You just do it automatically. You just fucking plug it in and then all you fucking knows we're on your computer now. Now they've, they've made it really fucking difficult in the amount of times. I just thought, just given, given given bad, put it on the cloud. Let the ghost of Steve Jobs handle it. Fuck that guy. Fuck that guy. There's a reason why God took him so early.

Speaker 2:          00:03:52       He needed to fucking slap him around first. Okay? He needed a yank that fucking turtleneck right up over his head. Jesus Christ built the man is dead. He had children. I don't give a fuck. I can't figure this out. Okay, so people have to get hurt. Okay. Oh, I felt good. So if anybody knows where the fucking Goddamn fucking Info Tab is in the iPhone section of fucking iTunes and can explain to me how, how the fuck I can save my own phone apps. I actually went into Barnes and nobles. It's a bookstore. Everybody for anybody under the age of 40 they used to sell books. They still do. And they're all, my God. What a collection of fucking human beings that are in that place. The last of the last, the last of the book readers, right? Like the last of the blacksmiths, the last of the people with the crank start fucking cars, you know. Last of the Mohicans, right. Last person to take his shit and CBGBS before they turned it into a John fucking Barbados. All right. I am gave you some examples. I can't even, what the fuck I was talking about, but all I know is uh, I need your help. Okay. I don't know. I don't know. I went into the fucking Barnes and nobles or is it Barnes and noble? I don't even know. Once I see Barnes, I'm like, uh, yeah, it's it. What does it Benny Barns guys, a fucking drug dealer. He's either in jail or is hide. [inaudible] Nicky Barnes. I don't fucking know Benny Barnes. Who the fuck was Benny Bart? Was that one of the cats on top cad.

Speaker 4:          00:05:24       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:05:24       It wasn't John Leguizamo's. Benny Blanco. Benny Blanco from the Bronx. The fuck was Benny barge. He was somebody that's too cool name and not have been somebody that is somebody. Anyways, we'll get back to that. When I looked that one up later, if I, if I still know how to fucking turn my computer on, God knows on the new operating system, maybe that changed. Um, so I walk into this fucking bookstore

Speaker 2:          00:05:47       and I walk up to this, this woman, you know, who's just like one of these people who probably, she's, she's the one who should be running the country. All right? But she's, you know, cause you know, but she's not going to it because she's a good person because she probably doesn't like telling people what to do. She probably doesn't feel qualified. All right. Unlike those two complete fucking psychos that you mean, can you imagine if the two of them had a kid, if Trump fucked Hillary, what would come out of that fucking pre presidential snatch? I can't even fucking imagine the lack of feeling while, and it would have black eyes.

Speaker 4:          00:06:26       Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:06:26       Whatever it had. And you'd look over and it would be sitting on the swing just staring at you and you would be fucking horrified. Um, so much of this has to do with the fact that I can upload my contacts. All right? So don't take it too, too personally. Um, but um, anyways, by the way, uh, you know what I, I barely noticed because I'm just like every other fucking mouth breathing more and just watching the football season, did you notice how there's like no pink in the NFL? Like they toned it down over the last three years. That kind of fucking tapered off. Isn't that amazing? And you know why that is right? Because the NFL raise so much money for cancer awareness. They put such a debt and the disease that they don't even, they don't have to do it anymore. That's what happened.

Speaker 2:          00:07:13       Okay. That's, that has to be what happened. Cause if that's not what happened, then I guess the NFL doesn't care about finding a cure for cancer anymore. Dead. There's no fucking way that's true. It's kind of weird how that happened. Kind of weird how fucking went all the way the fuck up and then it just kind of tapered the fuck off and people are still getting cancer left and right. This kind of weird. I thought that that was like, yeah, I thought they were all about the family's support and the tropes. Charging them for those pictures. Right. Support and the fucking troops and all that. Those fucking cops, they got in bed with that pink lady. They all got their yachts. People are starting to figure out like, hey, where the fuck is all this money go? You know where it's going. Okay. It's going down to the pick Twat fucking strip club and all the owners go down and they fucking bang away while their wives are fucking, I dunno, driving around in their pink fucking caddies, they stepped away.

Speaker 2:          00:08:10       The NFL stepped away. They just backed up. They just slowly fucking backed out of the room, you know? Now they just got a little pink fucking thing on the, on the, this is all my conspiracy theory. They just have little pink thing on the field. You know, let's say it's a maybe 30 paces around next year it'll be 15 this it is going to gradually disappear. Yeah. And then maybe one guy in, in October in the NFL will get Pinkeye and that'll be the last fucking thing. And they'll just, they'll just, Joe just fucking step away. They made their money. They're going to let that lady take the heat. You know what I mean? They gonna play babe in the fucking woods. All we did know, we thought it was on the Fuckin Bull, but the, you know what you were doing, you took all that fucking big money, you cuts. Um, got it being such a great mood. If I could just fucking, you know what's great is, is today the amount of the amount of fucking phone numbers I've got to tell you, having not used the iCloud any, the only fucking number that I knew other than mine was, was my wife's. That's it. I knew nobody else's, you know.

Speaker 4:          00:09:11       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:09:12       Trying to think if there's even like a commercial on TV. Was that one? Hey date, hate, hate, hate, hate, hate that fucking phone number. The seven seven's a car. [inaudible] I know that one. Um, it's a car service in New York, I believe. I don't know if they're still around. I think they are like the only ones that I fucking knew.

Speaker 4:          00:09:32       MMM.

Speaker 2:          00:09:33       But I mean I got like, I got like a fucking, I swear to God, I feel like you've got a hundred phone phone numbers back already. Let's go into the old fucking iPhone seven which for some reason you got to buy this umbilical cord in order to this little mini umbilical cord that's 10 bucks, 10 bucks for this little fucking thing that you know you're going to loose if you're like me. I mean I, I've probably bought in 15 fucking charges for every phone that I have. I always lose them. I always leave him. And those things are actually, you know, they're long enough. They're like an amaze. She hated garter snake. I mean I shoot with a big fucking head, you know what I mean? Like I shouldn't be losing those, forget about this little thing. I mean, I don't think it's longer than an inch. So the problem is, is that now with the new ones, I guess when you charge them, you can't listen to your music, which of course is just a major problem for everybody, including me. Forget about all these political prisoners around the world. Forget about the children that's so together. You're flashy fucking clothes. Let's talk about how us in the first world can now not plug our phones and charge them while listening to our music. Okay. I know it's a first world problem, but of course it is. I live in a first world.

Speaker 4:          00:10:37       MMM.

Speaker 2:          00:10:39       Jesus fucking Christ.

Speaker 2:          00:10:42       Let me see how many fucking context I had already. I put that guy's name in wrong. Got To fucking fix that one. I've just been obsessed all fucking day long. All Day long. Just just everybody who I had to take every call. Like once you lose all your contacts, you don't know who the fuck's calling you. It's like, Jesus, I got to call this guy. What if? What if? This is what? This is the guy calling from the thing. What if something amazing is going to happen? You know? And it's just the same old bullshit fucking phone calls. Let's see here. All right, done. All right, then you hit this. So the new thing about this one is it's fucking waterproof, which is great. Oh, by the way,

Speaker 4:          00:11:19       okay.

Speaker 2:          00:11:19       If you want to get a, there's a Belkin lightening, 3.5 meter adapter, B, e. L. K. I. N. They're 15 bucks. And if you get one of those, you can charge it and listen to your music at the same time. So they have filled the void, the proverbial void created. Um, was it done on purpose when we return? All right, so let's see what I got here. How many fucking phone knows do I have here? One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight. You know what? I'm gonna hit pause. I'm going to count these fuckers and let you know. All right, I'm back. Quick count hundred 13 phone, phone numbers recovered.

Speaker 5:          00:11:56       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:11:57       Recovered in fucking in Lynn in 24 hours then ain't bad. I'll get another hundred tomorrow, you know? But there are some that I'm just like, Oh fuck, I'm never going to get that guy's number. You know what I mean? You got to, you know, when you lose all your numbers, there's like, rather than just trying to get to everybody, you got to have hubs. You gotta be like, all right, this guy, he can give me five. Okay. And that one, one of those five will lead to another five. And this thing is you can only hit each person up for about five numbers. Have you once in a while you find a fucking sweetheart, which I did. And she'll give you a zillion of them. My wife gave me a Zillion, uh, you know, the woman that I put the Patrice O'Neal benefit together with. She gave me a bunch and, um, I'll just kinda keep going and going and going and going as a, as we get this thing together. But, um, I lost all the photos and, uh, you know what I think, uh, I think I'm all right with it.

Speaker 2:          00:12:48       Whatever. You know what? I got him up here, man. Got Him up here. The gray is hard drive ever, man. You brain. Um, I keep threatening. I keep threatening to get a flip phone again, but I can't because everybody is just, you know when you run your own fucking business, even if that is shit jokes and everything and people are sending you emails and you have to sign shit and scan shit, it's at some point you got to have one of these and I also love having all this fucking music on it. I really do. Oh, that's another thing too. When I plugged my new fucking iPhone and I lost like half my music. How does that happen? I don't know. Is it a, is it in the cloud? Is it on the stars with a fucked it all my music go. I had every fuckin ACDC album.

Speaker 2:          00:13:32       Now I have like four. Where the fuck did they go? Oh I know. I'll call somebody up at iTunes and I'm sure I'll get them on the phone shortly and they'll, they'll help me out with it. Fucking hostile. Can't she can't get to anybody. You know what, this is one of this was blessed would be what it really fucking feels like as you grow older is you just feel the world cares less and less about you. You just like this old horse ready for the glue factory and that we can't make any money off this guy. Just this guy can't carry anything. My fuck them. And you just sit. Yeah,

Speaker 6:          00:14:03       there were, I can I get anybody on the phone,

Speaker 2:          00:14:06       you know, like, you know what I'm really feeling bad for right now is Hugh Hefner, you know, you have, there was and always will be the fucking man. All right. And he recently, he had to, you know, he had the magazine and because of new technologies, nobody's buying magazines anymore. They tried to revamp. They tried to keep up Babababababa online porn, all this fucking shit. They just couldn't keep up. And uh, he ended up having, I think having a s, I don't know what he had to fucking do. All I know is he put his house up for sale and part of the sales price was, you know, that he was gonna live in the house until he dies. And then you get it and you can do whatever the fuck you want. And I oh man, what a fucking this bit. I gotta tell you something man.

Speaker 5:          00:14:49       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:14:50       I said this to, to, I ate

Speaker 4:          00:14:52       Nia to, I'm going to forget how I said it. I was just talking about Los Angeles. Los Angeles is an extraordinary lonely place to die in and less, but he does have kids. So I think we'll be all right. You Dude, if you fucking just, if you just, if you go out here and you make some money and you get some fucking whores and you get some blow and you take the fucking ride, you know what goes up, comes back down. And when you come fucking back down and that you got no cartilage left in your nose, right. And your fucking hairpieces fucking flopping around. I mean that and then, then you just sit in there and whatever's left. Uh, yeah house. That used to be the shit. Now you're sharing it with somebody else. Right.

Speaker 4:          00:15:39       And you sit in there slowly dying. No one I'm dying and then no one in the background here in the cars going by. Right. And just knowing it's going to keep going without you. They're going to keep making movies. They got to keep, there's going to be beautiful women and then I could have fucking it's over. It's over for you. I hope you had a good fucking time buddy. All right. I know it's fucking more, but if shit, but you know, I can't get my, I can't get my phone numbers. You'll be fucking hilarious as if you went country to country. What's your biggest fucking problem and uh, you know, or like neighborhood to neighborhood, you know what I mean? All this black lives matter shit and I'm fucking sitting here. I can't yeah, get my fucking phone.

Speaker 2:          00:16:21       Okay. It's people with diseases is war torn countries and I am throwing literally at a 48 year old man having a fucking shit fit cause I can't get all these fucking people's any, what's funny is, is pretty much at this point, I have everybody's phone number, I got all my friends, I got all my family pretty much. I got all of that and I got my business context and uh,

Speaker 5:          00:16:48       okay.

Speaker 2:          00:16:49       I Dunno, you don't some worst thing about losing all your numbers is you lose all those do not answer once, you know, fucking psycho, don't pick up. You know all of those ones, Jesus Christ and I, I have to pick up, I, I'm, I, I'm one of those I got to pick up. I'm like, oh what if, what if this is a, what if this is Steven Spielberg and he's doing a reboot, a VT and he wants me, he wants me to play 80 he wants me to fucking crouched down and I'd fucking do it too. I do it. I don't give a shit. You know what? Stick me in a fucking movie, Gag, go. Whatever the fuck you need me to do there. Stevie, you know, you want me to sling the mud around as I'm looking at a volcano? Is this some flying saucer playing some fucking music? I will do that in a cell. That's the lead.

Speaker 2:          00:17:39       I never understood that movie close encounters. I wanted to see it so bad when I was a kid, when I finally saw it, I was just like, that's it. That was the fucking movie that, that really look hastily put together. You know what I mean? Like I don't, I don't fuck, maybe I got to watch it again. Maybe I'm just a football watch and fucking moron. But when I watched that movie in Richard Dreyfus is just sitting there like listening to this, whatever that like, it was like a Simon says, but it was a flying saucer going like, hey booboo, BBB. But he's going like, wait a minute man, wait a minute. And he's throwing like fucking mud at this, this volcano. And somehow he gets it. He gets what the fuck's going on? And uh, I don't even remember the end of the movie. I, you know, I don't remember most, what the fuck do I get off criticizing a movie, having never made one.

Speaker 2:          00:18:30       Right like that. Like being the director and the creative force. I never fucking did that shit and I can't remember how it ends. That's not gonna stop me from criticizing it. I didn't like it too. Freckle thumbs down, close encounters of the third kind. There's a lot of fucking movies that have done really well that I just don't understand. You know, there's the classics like chariots of fire. I don't know who the fuck that was for, but when I sit down and I saw that movie, I could literally smell the house of the person that liked that movie because I had a paper route and I knew what those kinds of people smelled like. You know what I mean? They just, the heat was going to be on too high and it was going to have that musty smell of someone beginning to die. You know, you know that, oh, there is an old person odor and it's so you have a meeting, you have a meet somebody who's like almost your age and they already have it and you just look at it and I'm like, do they realize they're were already dying?

Speaker 2:          00:19:23       It's, I don't if PSAs smell it, the cake, you know, how does that happen? I mean, Jesus Christ, that's like a fucking car. If you don't start it up every day saying, I don't know. Is that what happens? I don't fucking know. All I know is Tom Brady. Tom Brady's coming back. Okay. And also, Oh shit. Starting tomorrow night, take me out to the ball game. Take me out to the crowd. I don't give a fuck about the first one. 62 I show up in October. Oh whoa. That's what I do. And I root root root for the fucking red sox. If they don't win, it's a shame. But they are already beat the cursor, the babe and everyone Mozhan rights. Right. That's why I left. I left in 2010 I left in 2010 with baseball. I was just like, look, either fucking get it out of the game or make it legal, but stopped getting me excited about shit that you can say five years later. It doesn't come. I still love the game. Who Doesn't love somebody? I, you know, I love a picture still. That's how much I love baseball. I like to keep score. I like all of that. But, um, I know from 98 to 2010 there was just too many fucking people that I was just like, Holy Shit,

Speaker 2:          00:20:48       Whoa Lee Shit Dude. I'm watching a guy who is fucking with, you know, the greats of the Goddamn game. And then the, and then like, you know, five years later I actually, he was parked, Sentara had I done, it doesn't really count that as shitty or should they not be in the hall? Right. But then you had like, you know, people like Alex Rodriguez come along and they fucking like, I mean, they've got most talented fucking do it all, you know, and all of a sudden it's like, oh, he's on steroids and the big fall of him or whatever. And then I love the guy comes back, he gets a 600 home run in. I'm in, I'm in New York City in this video of this, cause I know I posted it somewhere on the cover. They were given shit for the Patriots. One of the trumped up fucking horseshit ticky tack charges of US cheating. And then on the back they were given Alex [inaudible] rig is love for hitting his 600th home run. It's only cheating if the other team does it. Um, so anyways, I'm very excited for playoff baseball, you know, that's my favorite time. Everybody's all bundled up. They get the extra microphones at the ballpark. Joe Buck's calling the game. What's not to like the Games fucking matter.

Speaker 5:          00:22:08       Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:22:09       Of the four major sports, there was not a fucking sport out there where it matters worse if you lose a game when there's 160 fucking two of them. It just, it doesn't fucking matter. You know, and, and I, the fucking slave labor that these people have to go out and play 162 fucking games is just like, I mean, baseball's got it. How the fuck does football make more money than baseball? You would just think collectively like during the height of the steroids era, which is is a great argument for steroids. I mean the ballparks were packed, you know what I mean? I think you know all of these people around the world who are just confused at why America could give a fuck about soccer, right? Or feet ball is what it should be called. You know what I mean? I love whoever the fuck came up with that on Twitter. Cause what do you call football and you can pick it up. Well why do you call, what do you call it? Football. You can use both feet, right? And then feet ball. You want to be a cunt? We can be a cunt to right. This is a deal. If they would just fucking roid these fucking players up. Okay, we're there at at center ice, but it's a field and they could just tee one up and fucking blasted into the back like fucking album again. It's back at the day at the Blue Line. You know what I mean?

Speaker 2:          00:23:32       Fucking Paul Coffee Skate down towards his old goaltender, widen it up, go and fucking top shelf. If they had some people fucking doing that. Somebody said that to me one time I was in Fenway and then we were talking about how we're just not into soccer and the dough just goes, well we have soccer here. It's, it's, it's, it's called hockey and it's a lot faster. And whenever I watched soccer, like I see that I look, I understand there's a beauty to that game and everything, but, uh, you know what the reality is, is I just don't have time to watch another sport. I mean, I've gotten a little behind with the f one, you know, um, I haven't seen the Malaysia race yet, but I, I was able to go back and, uh, I watched the Singapore race, which was cool as shit cause it was at night.

Speaker 4:          00:24:15       MMM.

Speaker 2:          00:24:17       And then I watched the beginning, it was at the beginning of the Malaysian race would that fucking Hackenberg guy just got fucking hit and the whole side of his car got taken out. What a fucking buzzkill that is. Um,

Speaker 4:          00:24:28       okay.

What was it, the red bull team. I don't fucking know. But um, anyways, I think Japan's next and then do they go to Austin, Austin, Texas. I think that's what it is. Yeah. Which that's, I obviously don't, I should probably go to that one next year. Book Myself Out there in Austin. Go out there. Right.

Speaker 4:          00:24:59       Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:25:00       Um, anyways, what the fuck am I talking? I'll whipped of 25 minutes here. I don't have any of the advertising but um, I am actually, I'm flying out to Atlanta, um, later on tonight, taking the red eye out and I'm working the Fox theater in Atlanta. Uh, tomorrow night with Paul Versey guess is going to be tonight when you listen to this. Paul Versey, Joe Barton neck and then a good friend of mine from the original punchline Atlanta and they've just reopened. Jamie Bendel is going to come out and mc it, bring up the acts. We're going to have a great time. And then, uh, then we're going down to Gainesville and I don't give up. Let me tell you, I don't give a fuck. All right about this God damn tropical fucking storm.

Speaker 2:          00:25:47       Is that all it is at this point? Because they've their fucking, and this is the thing, this sitting there on these weather channels and they're showing people from 2005 buying up all this bread they use using stock footage of people freaking the fuck out. All right? And they're saying like, you know, we did, there's so many of these warnings that people, they've, they've, they've come become complacent. They be completely, they like blaming people. It's like, no, because you can't have trick these people. You've cried wolf so many fucking times. And I know you have to warn the general public that there's something coming, but the way that they do it,

Speaker 4:          00:26:19       yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:26:19       You know what I mean? They just have this riveting footage of people getting washed out to force. They don't get washed out to sea. There's always some Douche fucking surf into. Yeah.

Speaker 4:          00:26:27       MMM

Speaker 2:          00:26:29       know they scare the fuck out of people. And there's only so many times you can end up, you know, just getting a regular rain shower and you have like fucking six weeks worth of of of milk in your refrigerator that you just going to be, ah, yeah. Yeah. That's like them freaking us out about the fucking yell. The next giant earthquake is coming out here. That's the funniest thing ever. So what exactly am I? It's a fucking earthquake. Should I go with, is no earth. What am I going to leave my shit like when you moved to La, you know you're rolling the dice. You're basically rolling the dice. I can make enough fucking money. All right, I can make my mark and then I can get the fuck outta here before this thing breaks off. It's ups. You're basically Wiley coyote looking over the edge of a fucking cliff.

Speaker 2:          00:27:15       You know what I mean? As the roadrunners coming by and you know what's going to happen, you're a little apparatus. You can jump on the stick. The rock goes up in the air, it hits the fucking part of the clip you're on in the year you get, you're going to go down. Right. You're just hoping that it doesn't happen during your time. It was probably a bad example, but you know, I'm, I'm, yeah, I'm not the brightest guy. I mean, I can't even upload my context under my fucking computer, but I know after this podcast, I will be able to, cause I've reached out to you, the common man, the person, the common lady on Twitter. And you know what I love about you guys. I know, you know, you're going to teach me how to do it, but you're gonna, you're gonna hate your stupid freckled fuck blah, blah, blah, blah.

Speaker 2:          00:27:53       You can give me all, and I don't give a shit. I'm gonna fucking, I will glide through those insults to get to this information. I've already wasted a fucking hour of my life trying to figure out how to do this, to avoid being in this exact same fucking situation. Um, I was actually, when I was at the, uh, the fucking iCloud store, they would have an iTunes store, the apple store, right. I fucking go in there, you know, let's see if one of our geniuses, they literally say it with a straight face, one of these geniuses configure out. But who's can, no, I can't figure out how to do it. So in my world, I guess they are a genius. So this guy was cool as shit. He goes to just store anything on the ICLOUD and I go, well, not on purpose. I might've clicked something by accident and we just would just sitting there.

Speaker 2:          00:28:33       He goes, we'll click on this, wait a few seconds. And he's like, ah, no, no, no, no, no. Well maybe your folders, maybe save she photos. Click on that. And I'm like, nothing. He goes, no, no, I'll wait a second. Wait a second. Just wait a second. See if something comes up. Yep. Nothing there. And he goes, how can we, you know, use the iCloud? And it doesn't have to like, I was fucking creepy to me. He goes, well, you know, it's a really safe, totally secure system. I go, yeah, until it isn't. He goes, yeah, I know.

Speaker 2:          00:29:03       So, um, anyways, I'm very excited to go to Atlanta. That's where I take my last special. I'm getting ready to do another special. I picked out the fucking shirt I'm gonna wear. It's a little nod to Nashville. Um, little busier than old fucking Frederick always used. What the fuck? Why not every special should have its own God. Damn. Look, I'll wear a snazzy shirt for those fucking cowboy. Fucking those, those steer cow punching fucking people down there. Um, I am beyond ready to do this fucking thing. Oh, by the way, by the way, I got a call. My car fucking showed up yesterday, showed up yesterday, the detail in it. Everything's going to be fucking ready. All right. And I pick it up. Uh, hopefully next Monday when I get back, I come back, I go out there, I picked this fucking thing up. And, um, so I'm taking my last few rides with the Prius.

Speaker 2:          00:30:04       You what's funny about the fucking Prius? All you guys shitting on the fucking Prius, right? Do you know what me fucking offers I've gotten when I, I was buying a new car, the amount of fucking people that have asked me to buy that Goddamn car simply because of the gas mileage. I got the fucking side view mirror of fixed. I got a, I got to get the bumper fixed and then I got to go get a detailed because of, you know, all these years I have in my fucking awesome dog, you know, um, you know, she's a dog. She shipped. Sometimes she doesn't smell as good. Um, and evidently according to my wife, when she gets nervous, she admits and odor. She's never peed or shit in the fucking thing. But definitely when she gets fucking nervous and I don't know what the deal is.

Speaker 2:          00:30:46       Um, yeah, but mentally she admits a fucking odor or something. Maybe that's what the fuck it is. I don't know what it is, but there's definitely, hey man, there's been a dog in this car for like eight years. Right? So I got to get that shampooed out, uh, before I sell it to somebody. I wouldn't do that to somebody. You know what I mean? Fucking asshole. He hit my God damn car right before I'm giving it away. So I'm like, all right, throw like the fucking 18th bumper on this thing that I've had to get in. Reality is probably like the sixth back bumper, like every year, year and a half. I got to get another one cause someone fucking hits me. Um, and uh, I took it over to get the estimate, that guy go

Speaker 1:          00:31:25       slab. Actually, uh, I, there's probably, I can tell by this dent, you're probably going to need more than a just a bub or see there's another layer behind that

Speaker 2:          00:31:36       layer behind that layer. And then there's the frame. And I was like, well, I wasn't having problems closing the hatchback, so I think it's out. Know that will, I will, I'm not going to know until I get back. So the fucking asshole hit me and I didn't even run it through my insurance company. I just said, fuck it. Fuck it. You know, I'm not going to deal with that shit. You know, go down there and then, and

Speaker 1:          00:31:58       then they're not going to say, and then they go, well you didn't, you do this. And what about this guy over here? I just say, fuck it. I use insurance companies for the big things. You know what I mean? Cardiac arrest, a near death experience. You know, some guy gets mad at somebody and he slams a car that hits a card. The den hits mine. I feel like that's par for the course out here. You know, I kind of wished the cops got there before he just grabbed his bags and left his car. Probably fucking stole the thing. Who knows? Well, this is the end of this rambling horse shit. Uh, you can listen to some advertising after that. Then there'll be a little bit of music and then you listen to some, uh, some clips from a podcast, from a podcast gone by in a time that's already happened. Um, I want to thank everybody who tries to help out me to help out me, to help me out with this fucking thing. Um, if you're listening to this and uh, you have my phone number, text me, send me a fucking text, cause chances, chances,

Speaker 8:          00:32:59       I don't have your fucking

Speaker 1:          00:33:01       number in my fucking iPhone seven.

Speaker 2:          00:33:06       I'm calling it right now. That little, uh, umbilical cord that's hangs off that thing. I'm going to have to buy at least nine of those before I buy the next one. This is the first time I've gone from like one number two, the very next number. Like I kept the iPhone four s until I got the six. Um, I had the three and then the iPhone four came out and then I get the every other one. I never had the five. I got to six and I was like, fuck the seven. You know, especially when people are complaining about something new, right? Like this one is so stupid to buy. I would not buy this phone because what's going to happen is they're going to figure out this little appendage fucking thing. They're going to figure it out. And you know what? They already have it

Speaker 1:          00:33:49       figured out. They have the next nine complaints already figured out and they don't give a fuck. They just put it out like this. So everybody could be like old, you know, 89%. Great, but what about this? Right? So, um, you know, I wouldn't buy this one. I would wait for the seven s or possibly the eight. That's what I planned on doing until I, uh, look making any mashed potatoes. All right, go fuck yourselves. Have a wonderful weekend. You can't and I will discuss more shit with you on Monday. All right, have a great weekend. Enjoy the advertising. Whatever the fuck I get it.

Speaker 9:          00:39:09       is

Speaker 10:         00:39:55       um, all right, lights, camera dumped bill. I'm a 29 year old guy and recently broke up with a funny, attractive and all around. Great girl. Oh Gee. Why Sir would you do that? You ask. All right, uh, two things. Her Dad was born without teeth and your words, your baby will if you breed with her or a is she has got something going on in the vaginal area, some sort of odor, sticky pussy. I don't know. Oh, here we go. Well let me tell you, this girl and I had been dating for about three months and we had a great thing going. She's half Afro Cuban, half Puerto Rican and really sexy. She had a rough upbringing, but I didn't care because she's honest, easy going and not bitchy like so many girls I've dated. She was a bit needy, but I didn't mind.

Speaker 9:          00:40:47       Okay.

Speaker 10:         00:40:47       Um, we were out at a bar one night having a few drinks and I was feeling pretty good. I was looking at a couple of floozies at the end of the bar and asked her if she's ever been with another woman. She coyly looked at me and said yes.

Speaker 9:          00:41:00       Okay,

Speaker 10:         00:41:01       good stuff. I thought, yeah, dude, this is a fucking fantasy right here. Fucking red shoe diaries. Um, then I proceeded with, have you ever been in a threesome with two girls and a guy again? She answered yes.

Speaker 9:          00:41:15       Okay.

Speaker 10:         00:41:15       Okay. Kind of slutty, but I'm no saint. While I couldn't stop. They are God, you're going to go for the rotisserie question. What's in the box? Ah, here we go. Here we go. Strap yourselves in for this one. Well, I couldn't stop there. So I asked, have you ever had a threesome with two guys? She looked down at the ground and she looked up a bit ashamed, Lee and said, yes. Wow. Skank alert. I thought I then asked her one more question. I knew this one could back for where the fuck do you go from here? Like throwing the high heat to Elbert Elbert pool hosts. I finally asked, wait, have you ever been in a porn? She then blushed and look me in the eye and said, yeah. I looked at her calmly and was like, oh, but inside I was like, Jesus fucking Christ. Yes. Well, you should, you know those first couple. I mean, you can look at, let's, let's break this down here. All right. She's been with, uh, she's had a threesome with another girl and a guy who get that. That's who gives a fuck right there. All right. You're already knew she banged another guy. All right. But, uh, the fact that she also did it with another girl that takes a little fucking, uh, that tones down his dick in her pussy. Right? This is how guys think. Women, I'm sorry. All right. That's something that, that's something in the, uh,

Speaker 10:         00:42:51       the credit is the credit. Uh, why, why, why do you try to talk with counting shit. You're too dumb. All right. That one's all right. The two guys thing. Now you can look the other way on that. Maybe if it, if it was in another state, but it can't be in the same state because if you run into one of the two guys that fucking, you know, we're high fiving as they fucking banged her that, I mean, I dunno about that one. But then the third one she did a porno. I mean, yeah, no, that's a, you've got to walk away from that or, or you have to go to NASA to get tested for the latest fucking STDs I would think. And then also God knows what's going on. Uh, mentally that you would do that.

Speaker 10:         00:43:39       What? I just like sex. No, now there's something going on. Who doesn't like sex? I Dunno. Anyways, plowing ahead. See, she's so, she egos. So basically she had moved down to Los Angeles when she was 20. She's now 25 and after a short stint in the military, somehow she got into the porn industry for eight months. She did everything. Ooo, Fox sucked the whole Shebang. I asked her if I could see her video, but she wouldn't tell me her performer name and said Vietnam, the that it would be impossible to find her body of work. I asked her why she got into porn and she replies because I wanted some feeling in my life and then he rides dao. Ji Ji is, yeah, dude. Oh, this poor girl. Something happened to her. The thing was she was clean, had a good job and really liked her and the sex was great. Yeah. Obviously, you know what's funny, there was something you wrote in the beginning where I just thought she was going to be good. 29 year old guy, attractive all around. Great girl. All the fact that you said she had a rough upbringing, but she was easygoing and honest and not bitchy right there. I was like, that girl's good in bed.

Speaker 10:         00:44:52       It just seemed like a kind of free open person. I don't know. I didn't know. She was going to be that open. Oh, Gigi. Um, anyways, the thing was she was clean and I have a blah and the sex is great, but I couldn't stop picturing her in some sleazy porno that was probably filmed in some junk yard on labrea. So I went to ask for friend's advice. Most of my guys were telling me to dumper my gay friends told me it was fabulous and that I should overlook it. I didn't even bother asking my girlfriends because they would automatically reject her and assume I had aids. There you go. Keep your options open. So regretfully I dumped her.

Speaker 10:         00:45:35       I felt terrible and obviously didn't tell her it was because she was a porn star because she would have been ashamed for the rest of her life. And I was happy that she was honest with me. I've done my fair share of sleeves, but this was too much. My question bill was, Bill, my question bill, was it wrong for me to dump her for some decisions she made years ago? Should I have stayed with her? What would have you done? Um, well you don't want to know what I would've done. I'm a fucking degenerate. So lets you, you seem like a good person. Um, dude, when you're trying to find the person you're going to spend the rest of your life with you, you have to have a list of criteria. All right? You sound like you're still young, so there's no reason to compromise. All right? I mean, when you get with somebody like that and you're gonna live with them and you, when you get with anybody, you're taking on all of their fucking baggage. All right? You're only three months in and you know people who go into the porn industry that, you know,

Speaker 10:         00:46:41       it's like people will come. Comedians were not healthy individuals. Okay. And that is like a specific area that I just, this is just my own personal nonmedical feeling that you're just not a healthy person. Something awful happened and that line, I just wanted to feel something. I mean, something bad happened to her, caused her to or self off. I don't even want to try to guess what, but you know, there's nothing wrong with anything that she did purse, you know, technically. And she was honest with it. It all comes down to whether or not you want to deal with it. All right. And if you feel that you know, you want to deal with it and that there was this sort of connection that you just had, this girl had to be in your life, then you're going to have to learn to live with it and get it. MMM. But I would be definitely, I would definitely be concerned with a certain mental issues. Um, now like she's insane. And then I would also be concerned with, uh, sexual boundaries, you know, like would she have any and could she remain faithful after a while and when you settle into the seven year itch or whatever,

Speaker 9:          00:48:08       yeah.

Speaker 10:         00:48:08       And you really start needing to work at the relationship and it's feeling boring and she needs to feel something again. Is she going to go back to that right leather couch from that show? Martin, my end, you know, down on fog in the valley. And get banged again. I mean, I don't know. I Dunno. That is a, uh,

Speaker 9:          00:48:30       okay.

Speaker 10:         00:48:31       That is, you know what, that is beyond my skills. I don't know how to tame that horse. I can tell you that right fucking now. I have no fucking clue. That's a a, you know what? That's a doctor drew question. That is a classic doctor drew question and that guy within two seconds we'll get right to the core of it. I would call, I would call in love line man, if you're out here, call him up. Cause that's a, that's a great one. Um,

Speaker 9:          00:48:59       okay.

Speaker 10:         00:48:59       Yeah, I guess you'd have to figure out is is has she works through whatever the fuck she was working through and now she's ready to

Speaker 9:          00:49:07       okay.

Speaker 10:         00:49:08       I mean, I don't know. Hey those are some good looking girls down there and she's like, yeah they are or whatever. Like, I mean if you kept steering it in that direction, you'd probably get you fucking threesome right there. Um,

Speaker 9:          00:49:20       okay.

Speaker 10:         00:49:21       So there's that, there's that option. The option that you have is if you're with her. Like I think he, I mean that, that's, that's a selfish fucking and I, and a shallow reason to stay with somebody long term, uh, that you,

Speaker 9:          00:49:34       I don't know.

Speaker 11:         00:50:31       Hey, what's going on the Monday morning podcast and uh, I gotta admit I'm a little tired today. I drank too much yesterday. I don't know what the hell happened to some bar out here in la. And uh, I was watching the patriots playing the 40 niners and I get caught up in it and I had a couple of beers drinking cores light. I mean, it's like water, right? And like fucking four of those. And somehow I started doing shots and I was, oh, next thing you know, I had to, I had to call a cab and actually flagged one down, which is practically impossible in la. And I had to just, you know, go back and rescue my car later on that, that, that's how early football comes on out here. I actually got shit faced watching the game, took a cab home, passed out, sobered up, and was able to go back and get my car and it was still light out. That's how early the games come on out here. Isn't that amazing? Christ, what the fuck is my phone ringing my phone?

Speaker 11:         00:51:47       Shit, hang on a second. Hey Paul. Hey, let me call you right back. All right. Ima uh, yeah, that dude's calling me back cause I just left him a message telling them about fucking sports radio. He lived from this dude. His name's Paul. He fucking, he fucking, he listens to sports. Very listen to me. I'm a mess today. All right, let's get focused here. He listens to a, that's sports talk radio, which uh, you know, I finally discovered, uh, that ESPN radio thing out here on the am station by accident and you know, they got it. They have these triple header baseball games. So I like listening to the Games like Michael K and those guys. I think those guys are great. I love listening to the Games, but the sports talk radio, it's just so ridiculous. It's like, I dunno. And then I just feel like they just deliberately saying shit to get people to call in and you yell, you know, really bill, does that what you think?

Speaker 11:         00:52:49       Do you think people deliberately do that so their ratings are higher so they can make more money and fucking pay a mortgage on a bigger house? Why didn't, that was just one of the dumbest statements I've ever heard. You don't want, I think they do. I think they use gimmicks. Some more people listen, so they make more money. While bill, you'll really going out on a fucking limb there on Shah is basically what happened last night. My Red Sox were playing the angels was one of the best baseball games I've seen in a long time. It's why baseball's a great sport. It's why playoff baseball is awesome. It's why I love the five game series because every game is so huge. So I'm listening to fucking douchebags talking about the game. And uh, this guy actually makes a statement. He goes, uh, you know, I think the red sox last night were raw, taking the angels lightly.

Speaker 11:         00:53:36       You know, I think they thought that they were going to come back to Boston and a day we're going to close it out. [inaudible] it's like really, really well. Why do they always do that when one, that's what I hate about sports talk radio is they can never give credit to the team that wins. They always got to trash the team that loses and just talk about how they fucked up. So, so using that analogy, that means that the angels, the reason why is the red sox won the first game was because the angels would taking the red sox slightly. And then when gain two came along, the angel said, Hey, you know what? I got a good idea. Why don't we take the red sox lightly again? And then the third game came along and then they said, hey, wait a minute. It's the playoffs. Let's take the red sox seriously.

Speaker 11:         00:54:18       And then fortunately that same night, the red sox for some reason decided to go, oh, hey, let's take the angels lightly. You know, you know what that meant that that's the same mentality of when the giants won the super bowl. I still don't feel like the giants got the fucking credit that they deserve for having one of the most undisputable championships of all time. They beat Dallas in Dallas. They be Green Bay in Green Bay. They fucking bill the last game of the season we played them. They scored 35 fucking points on us, only lost by three clearly showing that they were among the elite and everybody ignored it. There was 17 point fucking underdogs and it was all this fucking bullshit hype. I don't know. Meanwhile the Patriots of squeaking by winning games, we beat the ravens cause they fucked up. That was in November. Everybody just ignores that and they just ride the hype.

Speaker 11:         00:55:12       And when the hype doesn't play out then they got to figure out, I don't know, I'm saying it was the fucking giants for the shit. And they kicked the shit out of the top three teams in the league, which means they are the baddest team of last year and looking on this year they won like 44 to nothing or 44 to three. I don't know. So I'm saying so all I'm saying is tonight it's going to be a great game and whoever wins the game is because they played better now cause the other team wasn't trying. It's like you have a play a video game with some fucking Douche bag and he thinks he's the shit and then you beat him. And then rather than him admitting it, he just goes to, or it wasn't even trying, it was even trying. Then he packs up his little fucking Atari and he goes home.

Speaker 11:         00:55:55       You know, it's just, this is fucking stupid. I don't know why. Why do people listen to sports talk radio as that so they can then call in with their dumb theories. You know, you know, I thank God for ourselves is deliberately overweight because he's trying to have a heart attack during a game because, uh, you know, coaching football just got too easy for him. I mean, that's why you never want to super bowl with the judge to the cowboys. He was just bored. Oh, that's interesting. Let's discuss that for an hour. God knows we have five hours of radio to fill.

Speaker 11:         00:56:25       You know, it is, I'm just mad at myself. It's because, um, about a year ago I figured out how to watch sports because it was annoying me. Like, uh, just how big they had gotten. And I was really starting to have a theory that people who aren't even into sports or watching sports now because they're so fucking over height, you know what I mean? It's kind of like me. When Star Wars finally came back, I went and I saw that first episode. All right, forgetting that I fucking hated star wars. I didn't hate it. I just didn't have that Jesus Freak. You know what I'm saying? It's just like, yeah, you know, I like sesame street when I was a kid, but when the muppets come up with a new movie, I'm not going to go see it because I'm fucking old now.

Speaker 11:         00:57:20       You know what? I don't even know what I'm talking about. I just totally lost my train of thought. They'll fucktard. Well, where the hell did I kind of, they get to that point. All right, let's, this is the Monday morning podcast. Uh, I think it's built bar. You know, obviously he came to my page. I do one of these every single Monday. And, uh, he said, you can subscribe to this podcast right here on my website, [inaudible] dot com or if you're on my myspace page, just go to www dot [inaudible] dot com you can subscribe to it. You can download it on your iPod. You can do all that wonderful stuff. And, uh, I can become part of your life for a half hour every Monday. Try to put a smile on your face at the beginning of the work week, isn't La all right. Last week and was riffing above directors in the 1920s.

Speaker 11:         00:58:09       And I was trying to remember what the fuck was that thing that they yelled through that fucking battery free bullhorn and a megaphones bullhorn. Wait a minute. A bullhorn is the one with that Jesus Christ. A bull horns. The one like, uh, that's the modern day one on tension. We have, you're surrounded, weighing down your weapons and come up with Dan's up than any comp ever. Really say that my intention. You know what? I bet when they get in that situation they don't know what to say. Cause like all that dialogue is so in their head. I mean, what else are you supposed to say? Excuse me, I'm a police officer. All right. Anyway, so the thing that you yell through that, uh, that's erectors UC yell through way back in the day and action cut, print it, whatever. I guess it's called a megaphone. It's a, it's a megaphone.

Speaker 11:         00:59:10       And somebody told me, I guess back in the day they called it a speaking trumpet, speaking trumpet, but a megaphone. And then the person said, yes, I listened to podcast for that long. Jesus, I know last week's was really long. It was like 40 minutes long. I Dunno. I these things getting too long. Was he saying that's the one thing when somebody sends you an email, like you can't tell like how they mean it, you know what I mean? And they make fun of themselves. It's all up to the interpretation of the reader. All right. So anyways, if you're new to my podcast, I do one of these every single Monday and I, uh, I answered questions and I learned stuff like I learned this week. Uh, the original bull horn was a megaphone or a speaking trumpet. And there is something that you can sell somebody at a party right before you're going to get laid to switch it into, oh, wait a minute, you're not getting late.

Speaker 11:         01:00:00       And, uh, people send me and movie reviews, overrated, underrated, and I babbled about shit. Um, I actually did a college out now in Phoenix this week, this aeronautical college. And I got to admit I had to look up aeronautical and I still don't know what the fuck it means. Um, I think it's the, the one, is it the science of space or something like that? These guys basically. All right. The kids. Okay. The 2021 years old, which was a kid to me cause I'm 40. Right. And they know how to fly planes. Some of them they're designing planes and they uh, I dunno. Weaponry. I have no idea. All I know is when they have a job fair, the fucking CIA shows up, which is a, it's pretty intense, Huh? That when they show up there, you know, have like the men in black suits and they have like those sunglasses with like the fucking built in Ipod.

Speaker 11:         01:00:55       That's how they get them. Man. See you like these sunglasses kid. Hey, why don't you sign up? He's sick of playing video games. You want to do video games for real when you sign up with the CIA. Okay. Cause when you know Brent up Datto was a fucking joke compared to what I did last weekend. Um, so anyways, yeah, I had a good weekend man. I went out there. I'm always have a good time when I'm out in Phoenix. Swung by the Improv and a, I'm not even listening what I'm saying right now cause I'm trying to find the first question of the week, which is this one? Uh, this guy from Detroit. Uh, let's see. Love the DVD bro. Definitely well worth the wait the day. Started listening. Money mean podcasts. All right. Podcasts, questions. Um, okay. Is being happy and being content. The same thing.

Speaker 11:         01:01:49       Recently I had a discussion with some friends at a local bar that went well into the night. I'm undecided. All right, well you know something. Well actually he says he's undecided due to the fact the majority of people I had the discussion with were women. Um, okay. All right. That didn't really shed any light on it. What are you saying? Women are stupid or they're not a guy, so they're going to have a different point of view. I don't know. Okay. As being content and being happy the same. Uh Huh. I don't know. Something about being content means that you just kind of gave in to the shit around you. You know, where you just kind of like, well I guess she's just going to be a cunt for the rest of my life and there's nothing I can do about it. So, uh, but you know, my own half the house and as long as I'm not in the half that she's in a, you know, I'm pretty content, you know, set the greatest situation. But uh, you know, it's good. I'm happy, I'm happy when she's not in the same room as them. You know, I'm gonna have the most amount of people that, you know, can we compare to, while a lot of other people live in, you know, well, I mean there's people trapped in rubble after an earthquake, you know, I definitely got a better than them, so, you know, I think I'm on, I think I'm content with world with what I got.

Speaker 11:         01:03:13       That's my definition of, of half of content and being happy is a such a weird word, Huh? Happy. How are you? I'm happy. No one says that. I don't say I'm happy. Happy sounds like a lie. I don't today. I'm good. Thanks a great. I'm a good mood. No one ever says I'm happy. That's one of those words that's used a lot, but nobody really uses it. You only use it when you write. You write when you're typing shit. That's all it was typing only words, you know, the only time you ever see happy, it's like on the cover of like a self help book. How to be happy and make the 12 people around you happier by some bald guy with the fucking goatee. Um, Eh, right. As long as any of you can answer the question is being happy and content the same?

Speaker 11:         01:04:07       Um, I don't, I don't think it is. I think being happy is generally you're just walking around and you're in a good mood. You appreciate life and a, I don't know, you'd try to do something to a every day to make sure he didn't waste a day or whatever. You know what I mean? You're not an angry cycle like me. I guess that would be happy. And you know how many fucking arguments I got into this week. I get in an argument with a guy in a scooter. All right, fucking guy passes me on the right between a parked car. So I beat that. Um, um, you know, first of all these fucking assholes and these scooters out here because gas is so expensive out here in la. Like literally it's, it's starting to look like Europe, the amount of people on here, on scooters and in vespas and all that shit.

Speaker 11:         01:04:56       But the funny thing is, is secretly every guy always wants to have a fucking Harley. He wants to be a bad ass with fucking tattoos and some fucking winch on the back of his bike. You know, doesn't have a boss. He's a fucking outlaws and he can play the guitar like Duane Allman. Okay. That's what fucking guys want to do. Okay. But the people, most guys like me, we don't have the balls to get a fucking motorcycle because we don't want to get road rash and you know, have your nose burned off when you do a fucking face plant out on the fucking one one-on-one one. Right? So what happens is, is a lot of these douche bags, now they're buying scooters and they have a false sense of safety because it's just the scooter and nobody who works in emergency room, like they'll always tell you the worst accidents we ever see, a motorcycle accidents.

Speaker 11:         01:05:42       They never say, Oh my God, this guy was doing 45 on a scooter and he hit a lemon tree. And let me tell you, I have not seen carnage like this since Vietnam. You never hear that fucking story. It's anyways, it's fucking ass. And plus all of these assholes get on these scooters and that they think that then they, you know, it's kind of fill in that I really wanted a motorcycle, but I don't have the balls to buy one kind of thing. And they get like that born to be wild vibe. So this fucking moron passes me on the right between a parked car because the road was about ready to split and I was going to make a left, but he was going to go straight. So I fucking beat that him. And he immediately slammed on the brakes because the light was turning yellow and he fucking, he backs up his scooter to my fucking hybrid. Okay.

Speaker 11:         01:06:34       This guy on a scooter screaming at a guy in a hybrid men, it must, it's fucking hilarious. It's like it really was showing you the future when we're going to have a different, we're going to be relying on a different kind of energy. How the whole definition of being a man is going to be, it's just going to be different. The whole marvel man thing is going to be gone, right. So anyway, so he flips up his visor to reveal like his fucking twisted up angry face in this little Tom Selleck mustache that he's got going on. He's like looking for release. It's fucking yelling at me. I was like, Dude, you just passed me on the right between a parked car. I didn't see you. I didn't want to hit you. Right. So he keeps fucking yelling at me and I'm just like, dude, I'm not giving you shit.

Speaker 11:         01:07:15       I just don't want to run into you. I know I'm just driving a fucking hybrid. You dumb. Fuck. But if you do something like that, you know your head's going to be over here and your mustache is going to be in the fucking trees. So I keep telling the guy like, dude, I'm just beeping at me cause I didn't see ya. All right, I don't want to run into you. I don't want you to get hit. And then he goes, oh, I didn't mean to startle you. And he flipped down his fucking visor and then went, oh boy. And a, I got to admit I laughed my ass off, but then was kind of pissed cause I let a guy on a scooter get the last fucking word and Ami. So I got into that argument and then I got an argument with this is all in like within 24 hours, I got to know argument with a TSA person or whatever the fuck they are at the airport.

Speaker 11:         01:08:00       Um, because of their Gestapo fucking attitude. And then I got into an argument when I was in Phoenix, I was driving under the budget, rent a car. And, uh, I was looking down at my directions cause I trying to figure out how to get to the hotel and this fucking cop in shorts. I don't know if it was rent a cop or a real cop. I don't know what he was. And bicycle shorts was, you know, he was directing traffic. So he's telling me to go, but I'm looking down at my directions and he's like, hello, hello? Like yelling at me like I'm a moron. Like I didn't see him. I did fucking see him. I just want to make sure it was going the right way. So I just snapped and I was holding up the directions and I just started screaming. I'm reading the directions, I'm just reading me Sarah.

Speaker 11:         01:08:45       I kept saying, sir, rather, but, but the undertone was you fucking asshole. Which I couldn't say because I didn't know if he had the authority to arrest me and uh, I don't know. It's just bad. You know, that's another thing that I can't fucking stand about America right now. Is this too many variations on the police officer outfit. And I think there's a lot of times that people aren't cops and you give them the respect like they are cops. I'm going to guess. You know what I mean? When you don't have to, like I don't have to take shit from a fucking meter maid. I really don't. You know what I mean? Like this morning I made like I made like an illegal u turn and then I saw that, you know, this fucking person meter maid sort of looking at me and I got nervous for half a second.

Speaker 11:         01:09:31       I was like, wait a minute, it's a fucking Meta me. What are you gonna do? Throw it three little fucking pencil. Lamean can they do anything to me? Like if they said, hey, that's an illegal u turn. And I said, hey, why don't you go fuck yourself? Can I do that? You know, I really wanna I really wish I knew my rights more because I think there's a lot of times you don't like that guy is I drove by, I go, dude, I'm just, I'm sorry, I'm just reading my directions. He goes, well that's why we don't read when we drive. Really? That's why we don't eat whoppers with cheese when we drive either. You Fat. Fuck. That's what I wanted to say. But you know, I stopped myself because I was like, well, wait a minute. What if that's a real cop? You know what I mean?

Speaker 11:         01:10:12       Thomas would have been worth it just to see him running after me and those fucking bike shorts. That was my favorite part of the, uh, that reservoir dogs movie Jvc. When Steve Buscemi, he's running down the street and he shoots, you know, after he gets hit by the car and he turns around and he shoots those at those three cops, they actually hits one of them. And as he's driving away, you see in and out his back windshield is, do you see that one copper and down the street just shooting his gun? Um, that's what I would have got to see. Like if he was fucking shooting at me, Jesus Christ. I'm really all of, let me get, let me get back to the fucking questions here. All right, so a happier content. Um, do I think that the same thing? No, I don't. I think content is an exception.

Speaker 11:         01:10:56       This is an acceptance and acceptance that, you know what, you're not going to make it to the NBA and uh, you, you a, you appreciate, I think, I dunno. What would you rather, would you rather be happy or content happy? Just sounds like you're fucking in denial, you know what I mean? Do you just fucking walking around? Hey, it is great. It is great. No, it isn't. No, it isn't. Banks are failing. $10 billion a month is four to fucking war. You know, everything isn't great. Everything's Kinda fucked up right now. I'll speak into that shit. You know, people always make fun of me with my conspiracy theories and that type of shit. You know how they're eventually going to stick a microchip in the back of your head. And I've been doing this bit on stage talking about how they start slow. They start with dogs.

Speaker 11:         01:11:42       That's the first thing they start with. And everything's cute. Oh good. I found fluffy and then they graduate going to work on the kids. And sure enough, there's a fucking commercial outright now with this lady. Lady can't find her kid and she's freaking out in the park. So she takes out a device, okay. And she fucking hit some buttons and then all of a sudden the end of the commercial, she finds her fucking kid. Now the thing is is they never showed a device on the kid. He didn't have a wristband, there was nothing in his, uh, he didn't have a funny hat with a propeller on it with an antenna coming out of it. Nothing. She just fucking had that little thing and they found it. And the funny thing was the commercial is for batteries. And I'm telling you, they are working towards putting microchips in kids that they're going to do it.

Speaker 11:         01:12:33       And it's all going to be done with fear as they always do it. Oh my God, I can't find my kid. Oh, there he is. Thank God. You know, I thank God I put a fucking microchip in my child and now I'm able to find them. You know what I mean? And they're gonna use fair and the reality, they're going to put all your information on that ship from your bank information, your, uh, your social security number, everything you fucking resume to, you'll just be getting scanned. And the conspiracy theory is though, is if the powers that be ever turn your chip off, everything you've ever done is gone. Your money, you records everything, it's all gone and you're fucked and you are immediately homeless. So that will, that will be the ultimate level of power. Plus they'll always know where you are. Oh my God.

Speaker 11:         01:13:29       It's put the, you know what? They're going to fucking do it. They're going to get away with it because all you got to use his fear is anybody else seen that commercial and it fucking creeps them out. Anybody? Am I seriously the only one here? Just kind of going nuts here. All right, let's move on to the next fucking question here. All right. Um, uh, where are we a blah, blah, blah. You mentioned being a Stevie Ray Vaughan fan. Did you ever see him? Um, yes I did. I saw him on the instep tour and on the summer of 1989 at great woods in Mansfield, Massachusetts, and I was fucking loaded and I remember I was with my brother and he ended up getting into a fight with some guy, an argument with some guy who was easily three times the size of me and I'm bigger than my brother.

Speaker 11:         01:14:17       So I just remember like going through it, uh, you know, what are you trying to do? I, whenever the guy had a big orange mesh shirt with a Jimmy buffet hat, and you remember those sunglasses from the 80s with either had the neon green or orange, I think he had the orange ones. I mean, in retrospect, I could see why my brother was yelling at him, but you know, you know what I mean? I came there for a, an evening of blues music. I didn't want to fucking roll around the floor with some fat fuck. And then I have that Mesh imprint on my face when it's fat torso landed on me. All right, next question, uh, is the U S U s is the UFC? Look how fucking like what alcohol does to me. Why do I keep drinking it? Is the UFC jamming too much down our throats?

Speaker 11:         01:15:05       Do you think the UFC is somewhat of a fad that'll end up bearing itself or do you think that it will be us three with us for a long time? Um, no, I think, I don't think the UFC is jamming too much down our throats. Uh, what do you mean there's too many shows? What they got the tap out show, they got the other one. I Dunno. I like all those shows and uh, I dunno. I don't think it's going to end boxing either. I think they're both, you know, I mean, I even want like those tough man competitions. You put two guys in a ring who are going to try to beat the shit out of each other and how do you not watch it? It's great. It's almost even better. Like some of those amateur ones where they, they don't not have fight and they fill those haymakers and the guy gets the other guy gets knocked out with five basically getting hit with the palm and risk of the other guy.

Speaker 11:         01:15:55       You know, those, the [inaudible]. That's why I think about barroom brawls. They throw punches like black girls. You have to see black girls. They do that fucking, you know Damon Wayans bit he does about the windmills thing that they get going. That's how a lot of fucking a barroom brawls look like. I guess. You know what it is is because you're not a professional fighter and you're not calm. So even if you know how to fight, you don't, you don't throw, you know, Jabs, upper cuts, you deserve. You just basically espousing up, which is always, that's always fun to watch. All right, moving onto the next thing here. What else do we got? Oh, you know, why do I hype some shit that I've got coming up next week? I'm a really excited, um, I'm very content. I'm very happy with the fact that next week for the first time ever I will be performing in Austin, Texas at the cap city comedy called and it's part of the uh, the uninformed tour, um, which is the radio show I do with uh, Joe de Rosa who will be opening for me out there at the Cap City Comedy Club in Austin, Texas.

Speaker 11:         01:16:57       Uh, and I will be there from August 16th through the 18th and a on the 18th. I will in fact be going to the Texas Longhorns, Missouri Games. So take out your binoculars because I will be one of the people, one of the 100,000 people at the game. And uh, if you would like to get tickets anyways to go to the Austin thing, a Oxman show, go to a cap city comedy club.com and a click right on the tickets thing. I'm on the website right now. There it is. Look at that. There it is. Who's going to be the, and some guy named Matt Sadler's there this week. So if you want to look at the room, go see him, look at me hype and other guys fucking shows. All right, so is that, is that going to be it? Oh, hey, let's do overrated. Underrated. I didn't really get any this week, so, um, or at least I can't find any that I got.

Speaker 11:         01:17:54       Um, I'm going to tell you my fucking, you know what I think is overrated. You know, it's overrated. Japanese, uh, baseball. Wait a minute, somebody said that, didn't they? They already said that on this one. Somebody said that Japanese baseball players are overrated. And you know what? I have to agree with them after watching dice k pitch game too, and when he came over, oh, the fucking gyro ball and all that type of type of stuff. These Japanese baseball players, they always have these ridiculous nicknames like they're going to be, you know, you know, they're always named like titled in Godzilla and then they come over here. So we're going to miss strike three had decky Ema, now I can talk to act goes down again. He's in a bit of a slump and it's amazing. He hit 9,000 home runs over in the Osaka.

Speaker 11:         01:18:44       You know, why don't they just go to the Dominican Republic? That's where they all are. I mean, how many fucking Pedro Martinez? You know what I mean? Like a Manny Ramirez. But what the fuck he's done for the Dodgers. Okay. And he's just from Washington Heights. All right. But if you actually go to to the, to the fountain, to the source, anything down there. Puerto Rico. Yeah. You got to respect that. That dom isn't that where many Rivera's from David Ortiz doesn't need Dominican? Why wouldn't you go there? Look at those guys. The fucking insane. I mean, I think you've got to, you got to go Latino firms. I'm going to, I'm going to send it out there. Latinos have taken over Latinos saved baseball. You know, people always talking about how black dudes took over hoop and they took over a football and all that type of ship and no one's bringing up a baseball.

Speaker 11:         01:19:38       All these fucking guys, right? I just don't know enough baseball players. But anytime I see somebody doing like, you know, turning a double play with his back to second base and he doesn't even take the ball out of his glove and he fucking flips it over there with his club. It's always a Latino dude are some of the top white Jesus Christ. There are many white guys left. Really getting low self esteem here. When his second Ukeles wow was just fucked up. I am hard pressed. Who is, who is the best white guy is a question for you guys. Who's the best white guy? Baseball player outright. Now I'm really drawing a blank half of Derek Jeter. Can we get credit for that? Um, well let's look at the red sox. Jason Varitek calls a great game. He's batting about fucking Oh 25 Euclid. Kevin Lowe, Jason Bay. Adroit Jesus Christ. Wait a minute.

Speaker 11:         01:20:42       You know, I can't think of one fucking, you know. No, this is bullshit. This is bullshit. That's gotta be one. I'm just throwing fucking drawing a blank. Let's go to the Yankees. They was going to a zillion stars. All right. Hey Rod. Okay. Hey, Rod Rodriguez. Okay. He's not white. Derek Jeter get half credit. Second base, uh, the fuck, that's not Soriano. What the fuck play second base. I know who he is. He looks like fucking a Ralph Harris. That's not a white dude. Jason Giambi. I mean Jesus Christ. Fucking guys on a, these are like horse tranquilizers. You have another set guy. He fucking hits the ball. He just starts running down the line, licking his lips and he's always sweaty. Got that crazy fucking look in his eye. Like he wants to admit to a murder, but he, but he can't. Then you go out to the outfield.

Speaker 11:         01:21:38       Who Do they got? I don't know. Random fucking figured stuff. You know what I, my brain hearts, I think we got Tom Brady. Tom Brady is the AMT. Wes Walker. They ain't go, I can not tell you something right now. You know, I did a bit on my last special about how, you know, whenever you watch the Olympics, whenever you watched the track race has always nine black dudes and at one token white guy in lane eight, you know, and I'll not the other nine black dudes bomb away. I don't know if you've noticed during this Olympics. I Dunno. I dunno what new synthetic drug is out there that they don't know how to test for. But I think that they, they're giving it to some white dudes because uh, that was someone, some of the fastest white people I've seen in a long time and I was just sitting there like fourth place.

Speaker 11:         01:22:19       Really? Wow. They were flying. Well, the short shorts, I think the white dudes coming back. Yeah. Well I'm going to, I'm going to fucking go out on a limb here. I'm going to say that uh, blacks and Latinos have raised the bar and Chinese people in Ping Pong. Not to be disrespectful, you know, want to make sure I include everybody and uh, now we're going to raise the bar. Hey listen, the question I've got for you, how come only USC seems to know that Samoans make great linebackers or defensive backs. Every time you get fucking watching UFC, they always got some, some new motto. Follow guy with fucking a 12 inch Afro mullet coming out of the back of his helmet. Just lighten people up. Did Samoans only say, I'm only playing in southern California because that's the closest thing to the beautiful weather we have in the islands, Samoa. You know what I just realized, I have no idea where the ILS Samoa is.

Speaker 11:         01:23:17       I'm going to guess it's a south of Hawaii in a little further east now. Live a little further west. Got Him stupid. That doesn't make you stupid, does it? I don't know. All right. Anyways, this has been the podcast for this week. It's been very disjointed, very hung over. My voice is tired and uh, and when I was telling you I was quitting drinking, well obviously I've stopped and uh, you know, I don't, I don't have to do about it. It's just fun. You know, it's like that guy said he's sitting there bar and he got new big an all night debate over. What's the difference between happy and content? You know what I mean? It's a, you know, it's good discussion considering everybody has air conditioning nowadays, so no one hangs out on the stoops anymore, so you can't shoot the shit. You go down to the bar and you have great discussions. It was a good one. I had the, it was a fucking, when I had the other day, who was one of those, what would you rather be?

Speaker 11:         01:24:26       Would you rather be gay or would you rather be tortured? That's what came, that's what came through. You know, that fucking dilemma was like an hour debate. What would you rather be? Would you rather be gay or would you rather be tortured? All right. Now I believe that you're born gay. Okay. So it was a bad question because what they should have said, would you rather be forced to be straight and forced to perform a gay act? Or would you rather be tortured but to just say, would you rather be gay or be tortured? It's a no brainer. You'd rather be gay because you born that way. You just came out going, hey, I'll loving the cock. You know, it's like Lichen cookies. You like it. That's like, what? Did you run any cookies or have someone take a pliers and remove one of your fingers? Ah, I think I'd eat the cookies.

Speaker 11:         01:25:17       So now, you know what I mean? I, I'm, I'm of that school. I believe you're born gay, you know, I don't understand these people who think is a choice. Why would you choose that? You know, everyone, if you could make a choice, you're trying to be a quote unquote as normal as humanly possible, unless you like Madonna and you're just like an attention whore. You know what I mean? So you just deliberately, you know, finally jumpsuits. Did you just yank up between your Twat lifts? What does with her? You know, it's like lady you 50. I got it. You're in shape, but I don't, you're, you're weird. Look. And now they just weird looking because the loan you, she looks like an old stripper, you know? Fucking put the God damn glass high heels away lady. It's over. If 50 yeah. Had a great run.

Speaker 11:         01:26:07       People have been fucking rubbing one out to you for since the 80s. That's unprecedented that it's, it's three decades. You know, I think you got enough. Think you've had enough. All right. Oh wait a minute before I wrap this up here. This is, somebody sent me this thing. Um, uh, what is this? I actually, I didn't know where to file this under other than just an op ed piece. All these are the movie reviews. What am I talking about? Someone actually made up a great one here. They said they gave me a good, when they said my number one worst movie of all time time was m night Shambhala limit Dingdong whatever his fucking name is. Uh, that movie, the village. But now pineapple express has taken its place. Horrible movie. I guess you have to smoke weed to get it. Although half baked was hilarious. Now I think you made a great point there.

Speaker 11:         01:27:03       In the end we said you know, half, but you know, you think Pineapple Express was the worst movie ever but you like half baked. And I'm going to say that's because half bake came out 10 years ago when you were probably 18 to 21. You know what I mean? Cause I saw pineapple express. I thought parts of it were funny, but in the end I was just like, yeah, you know, I kind of felt like I wasted my money and I was like, ah. It was kind of stupid. But then I was thinking, wait a minute, you know what? If I was 16 to 21 years old, pineapple express would be one of the funniest fucking movies I ever saw. Just because you're in that mindset. So, you know, so it's not even fair for me to say that star wars sucks. Now you know what it is.

Speaker 11:         01:27:45       Because I remember I thought the way he walks for gay way back in the day, and by gay, I don't mean, uh, I don't mean happy like the gay nineties number, the 1890s, everybody, they would call it the gay nineties before gay switched to meaning. You like to have sex with someone of the same sex. And I don't mean gay as in, uh, yeah, homosexual. I mean that other kind of gay, you know what I mean? You want to do that, that's fucking gay. That doesn't even mean stupid. What the can may give me a good definition, but that's one of those, everybody knows what it means, but she can't give it a definition. Doesn't mean happy. It doesn't mean homophobic. It's that inbetween said gray area of gay, like uh, uh, jam bands. That's fucking gay. I don't watch somebody play a fucking guitar solo for 90 minutes. That's not even a good example. I'm the fucking worst. Why don't I prepare for these things? All right, here's, yeah, well this is the last thing I'll read. This is some op ed piece feeling I, because this wasn't a question, it didn't fit into any category. It was just somebody opinion. So this might start something new. Um, okay. Here we go. Bill. Nowadays, the majority of men are such wimps that there is no hope for a woman meeting. A decent man that isn't a pussy.

Speaker 11:         01:29:09       Most men have no shame admitting that they are weak. And I seriously wonder myself, where have all the man, where's all the manhood gone? Didn't men use to feel good about being manly? Have we as strong women, quote unquote taking it away? My grandfather, my grandfather would rolling over in his grave if he heard how pussified most men have become it. It's very sad. However, it has caused me to stand on my own two feet. So I never have to rely on a weakling, which is good because I don't want anyone else running my ruining. I mean, running my life about myself. Um, and then it just goes on. And it wasn't our fault that men have weakened, uh, and been feminized. So have women become so strong that men are afraid to take their rollback? That's a ridiculous question. Oh yeah. Yeah. We're terrified.

Speaker 11:         01:30:02       Have we lost because we've won either way. It sucks. Smell. You know what? This is sweetheart. This, I dunno if it has to do with your hormones or what it has to do with a woman. Never for the most part, never really knowing what she wants or what's going to make her happy. And you become psychotically focused on something and then when you get it, you are still not fulfilled, which causes you to question everything. And uh, I dunno, I don't think, I dunno. What, what are you basing nowadays that the majority of men are such wimps that, you know, are you basing that on like the television you're watching? Because I definitely think that we are in a streak here where they, you know, I think always throughout the history of time with like sitcoms and that type of stuff that they, uh, they always had to make the guy like dumber and the woman's smarter.

Speaker 11:         01:31:05       And, uh, I just think they do that as an apology for the fact that for the most part guys run shit and uh, don't let women get past a certain point in management. So I think that they, the, you know, to throw you a bone, they make the guy character a fucking idiot in the, uh, in the Sitcom. But at the end of the day, who wants to show some studio that's run by some guy? So who gives a fuck? So, I dunno, I think you're, you're probably fishing in the wrong pond. Um, but you know, be careful what you wish for. Uh, because the quote unquote real man is a probably an asshole, I would think. I don't know what the fuck do I know? I don't fucking know anything. Have guys become pussified. I think a lot of the comedies, like you know a lot of them, like these hipster fucking Douche bags out there that, that, that kind of in right now.

Speaker 11:         01:32:02       Maybe that's what you're basing it on. How they were those stupid fedoras and it's just a fucking, I don't know what it is. I hate the fucking, you know. Dot. That that whole fucking, that whole scene just bugs the shit out of me. Fucking idiots walked around there for doors like deliberately dressing like nerds. It's like, dude, you are a nerd. You don't have to try. Okay. And stop acting like you were cool in high school. Stop trying to rewrite your story. All right. You weren't cool, you weren't getting any pussy and now you know, and it's just, I fucking hate that whole thing. I think that's all. But you know what I, you know I'm really sick of though, is, is the word awkward? You know what I mean? I'm sick of awkward comedy. Like, do you guys watch that show? The office? I can't deal with that show.

Speaker 11:         01:32:50       It's just like, can some person, can one person on that show be aware of what they're saying? It's just everything that happens on that show and it's like, and then my house burned down, not good. And then they sort of look around like, wait a minute, what did I just say? It's just fucking, it's ridiculous. I'm sick of that kind of comedy. Yeah. The, I'm calling it first awkward comedy is out. All right. And if it's somehow spin back to false anger, I get my own goddamn show. All right. That's it. How long have I talked this week? 42 minutes. These things are getting too long, I think. I mean, I'm making fun of jam bands and I'm having 42 minute fucking podcast. Why don't I get to the point a little quicker? All right. So anyways, I am going to be at the a Cap City Comedy Club in Austin, Texas on a fucking October 16th 17th and 18th. Go to Cap City Comedy club.com to get your tickets.
