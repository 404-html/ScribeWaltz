Speaker 1:          00:00:01       Hey, what's going on? It's bill burn is time for the Monday morning podcast for Monday, January 18th, 2016. How's it going out? Why? Yeah. Uh, I am recording this Sunday afternoon and, uh, in Vancouver, Canada doing two shows here tonight. It's halftime, actually third quarter just started of the Bronco Steelers. I missed, uh, Seattle and a Carolina. I know that must have been a great fucking game. It kills me. You know, you never know when your book, the fucking gigs that have game like that is going to be on. But uh, I imagined that that was as good as the score looked. And of course I'm up here in Canada and uh, I dunno, they don't have, they just went to boomer and all those guys at halftime and all they did was interview Cam Newton. They asked him one question, you know, he didn't answer. He just talked, didn't give an answer about anything.

Speaker 1:          00:00:54       They like, what do you think it did? The, uh, the second half to, uh, you know, uh, blah, blah, blah. And he just goes, well, you know, our offense and our defense. And of course the special teams, you know, everybody's got a job to do when they get out there and they tried to get done. And unfortunately today we were able to get out there and execute some of the things we'll be working with all this week. And uh, you know, next week we've got another person that we're going to be playing. I should set a team, not a person who we had on the team are going to play. I know. We just hope that, uh, you know, we're just going to try to keep it going because, uh, you know, we're all trying to win a championship here.

Speaker 2:          00:01:23       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:01:24       And by then you're just like, what the fuck did I even ask you? Um, I wonder if, you know, cause athletes, anything they fucking say they're going to take it out of context. So they just, they get trained to just answer and not say anything. Just like a politician. I wonder if you could fucking turn that off. You know, if you stay in the league long enough, if you drive your wife and that's, you know, hi. Well you know, you're your own a lot of stuff at uh, sometimes that stuff gets misplaced at Oh, you can do is just try to fire on all cylinders and try to find the things that you could have in a, if you can find them, you can find them. And if you can't a then you've got to move on to the next thing. But uh, you know, it was always, I'm always looking towards the next week and then another thing that's going to be lost in, I've just lost, while we're definitely going to do everything we can to find it, uh, the offense defense, special teams.

Speaker 1:          00:02:14       Um, anyways, uh, yeah. So I'm up here in Vancouver. God dammit. It's fucking beautiful up here. Fucking gorgeous man. Especially when you live in, uh, you know where the hell I live, which was not designed to have really anybody living there other than I guess maybe some indigenous people sending smoke signals, you know, probably sending smoke signals said, you know, can you find any food? Cause we can't. I'm sick of eating snake and do you want to get the fuck Outta here? However the fuck you do that with smoke signals, it must have been pretty God damn simple, right? The smoke signals if they even did it or is that just another Hollywood thing that they threw a ball? I mean, how do you even fucking do that? I guess she had to go. Obviously you've got to put the fire out, right? How the fuck would you do that? You know? All right. One big pop for fucking. She had to know what kind of wood to burn. What a pain in the ass. Jesus Christ you. I'm going to get lost it. I remember getting lost at the mall before a fucking cell phone. That was unbelievable. Forget about back then. If you get lost or you are fucked.

Speaker 3:          00:03:21       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:03:21       Anybody see a, what the fuck was that guy's name? Oh, fucking red face. Where the ego done. I mean, how long do you look? You can't really yell. You're going to attract wild animals.

Speaker 1:          00:03:37       It's walking around the woods. Hey Eddie. Eddie the fuck are you. This isn't funny man. Anyways, but you come up here after leaving the desert. Um, whenever I see at the, say the desert, I always think of a that awesome. They're great. Greg Giraldo rest his soul joke where he says did that whole thing about, uh, how eloquent the words, the words, the notes were that, uh, soldiers wrote during the civil war, you know, versus some of the letters from people coming back from re Iraq. Uh, what am I, I can't remember how the it went. It's really hard to be out here with the ball sticking g leg out here in the, in the desert.

Speaker 1:          00:04:24       And I remember the difference between desert and desert. Two s's for dessert, more calories. Right. There you go. That's how I do it. And don't even ask me to spell restaurant cause I won't even fucking remember. So anyways, I'm up here in Vancouver, so we go to fucking land, um, and just, Oh my God. All the lush greenery, all the lakes, all low water, everything we don't have down in La, beautiful houses. I guess it's expensive as shit up here. And they were saying how, um, a lot of Asian people, um, you know, not indigenous foreigners, you know, they got to get rid of that fucking money. They get to wash their money or I don't know what the fuck it is. Their government's going to take it all. So they uh, use this place up here like a Swiss bank and they buy like super expensive places for cash.

Speaker 3:          00:05:11       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:05:13       Which drives the housing market up. It's fucking nuts, man. Anytime you go to another country you just see the shit that they're fucking dealing with. I just, you know, you always think like, he come up here, candidate, it's going to have no fucking problems. You know, you watch one Michael Moore documentary that just gives you a complete like misinterpretation of what the fuck is going on up here. Um, so they, I guess they had to make some sort of law

Speaker 3:          00:05:35       mmm.

Speaker 1:          00:05:38       That you couldn't do something like that. I can't make him up. The fucking person told them went all the way while the way to the fucking supreme court. It was like a group of people from Asia that was so rich that they actually sued an entire country for not letting them either come into the country or, uh, by a bunch of shit over here that drove the housing market and stuff up or something that, or by their citizenship, I can't even fucking remember. But that's the charm of this podcast. You know, I get a little information, I barely remember half of it and I just fucking run with it. That's all. Um, so anyways, um, so it went all the way to the supreme court and then they would just finally like, ah, yeah, you kind of have to be from this country for us to give a fuck about you, you know, to like win a lawsuit. So a, see you later. And that's in an ended, I guess the lawyer for them new the whole way, going all the way up that it wasn't going to happen, you know, they weren't going to win it and he just took that money. He probably had to sit there and work on is uh, I'm disappointed we lost to face, you know, as he took all their fucking money.

Speaker 1:          00:06:42       But anyways, so let's talk about NFL football. What pop pop. Pop Gate. A car. He didn't get it in. Um, the fucking patriots. They want God dammit. Thank Christ they won then Christ day one in Seattle. Los Thank Christ. You know, if we're going to keep advancing, I just didn't want Seattle to get to revenge. You can't remember if I've, if I've already said this, I just didn't want to see Seattle get the revenge on a bagged up Patriot team. If we come become healthy and they kick our ass good on them. But uh, you know, congratulations to the Carolina Panthers. They gotta be the favorites at this point. Come on this 16 and fucking one. Right. Got that young defense then that scared as shit. They just beat Seattle. Right. Who knows? But, um, I don't know shit about football. I've just been so fucking busy, so I'm, I'm still going to talk about it.

Speaker 1:          00:07:34       You guys can keep trashing me that I don't know. Shit. I don't give a fuck. Um, and by the way, this is why I never record on a day that I flew because my brain is even more all over the place than it usually is, especially when I got a fucking TV going on in the background. But uh, you know, I got, I got too busy fucking datum. I fly back tomorrow. You got a busy fucking day. So I apologize if this is all over the place, even more than usual. I as a first down for this fucking 25. Oh, somebody else up here. It gives a shit about NFL football. I know they, a CFL ends and like is it the end of November? They have the Great Cup, which is their super bowl or is it a December? I don't know. The people even give a shit.

Speaker 1:          00:08:20       You ever see the fucking stadiums for their football teams up here? It's like you sit in the stands, you can see your car, you know, one of those deals where there's like a fucking, you watch them kick a field goal and you're looking at traffic driving by on the street, like those old school football stadium, uh, from like the sixties and seventies. You know, where they would have like the horse shoe shaped stadium, which was, I think what happened with, with the, with the football stadiums was when there wasn't that many people in the or, and also the leagues were small. They just had sitting on both sides, right? He had the home side and the visitors side and that was it. And then as there's more and more people population got bigger, the league's got bigger, then they built end zone seats that connected both sides. I think they just did it on one side first. And he had the horse shoe, right? Like the fucking Broncos played in the buckeyes. A buckeye still called their horse, they still call it a horseshoe, even all they fucking closed in it. And then eventually there was people, people did so much fucking that they had to close, you know, and there's so much ESPN that got everybody fucking interested in it that isn't even interested in it. Then all of a sudden Beyonce singing it fucking halftime, you know? I mean there's a bunch of people in the crowd that are excited by it, you know?

Speaker 3:          00:09:41       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:09:43       A fucking old ass Rod Stewart who the fuck they dragon out? They always usually go with somebody younger. They just fucking drag somebody out who's on their last fucking legs, like their last big payday, you know, they just fucking wheel him out there. Who are they going to do this year?

Speaker 2:          00:09:59       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:10:00       Uh, night ranger. Do you think going to be like night ranger? A Drake. That's what I'm guessing. Oh wait, I think it is Beyonce. You know? I know cause neo wanted to go to the Superbowl because Beyonce was there. I'm like, why don't you go see her in concert?

Speaker 2:          00:10:14       Okay,

Speaker 1:          00:10:15       you're going to make us go to the fucking super bowl and then we get to watch her lip sync. One fucking song. How the fuck did Sean Penn interview that drug? Lord, how do you do something like that? And the government isn't like, Hey, you know, we're trying to find that guy.

Speaker 2:          00:10:31       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:10:31       You know when you're just sitting there palling around with them.

Speaker 2:          00:10:34       Yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:10:35       probably bought them like fast times at Ridgemont high DVDs. Right. For his underground layer.

Speaker 3:          00:10:43       Okay,

Speaker 1:          00:10:44       dude, I love Sean Penn as an actor. But how are your fucking tree? Are you that you're going to go and interview that fucking guy? You know I did. I'm trying to think how many fucking standup specials I would have to put out before I could go. I would go fucking interview somebody in like, well, I guess Isis is actually fight, but we're fucking with them toe. You know? I would just say, I'm going to walk in there with my microphone. They're all gonna laugh at me and then they're going to saw my fucking head off. Are we going wars tie me to a chair. Fucking torture me to death. That's insane. Hey, good on him.

Speaker 2:          00:11:26       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:11:27       Also, I don't understand. Is it El Chapo? That's his name. He sounds like such a gentleman. Huh? El Che is a good chap. El Chapo.

Speaker 3:          00:11:36       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:11:37       I don't fucking get it man. What are you doing? Why, why did he go down there and interview that guy?

Speaker 2:          00:11:48       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:11:48       And like how, how, how well does Sean Penn's do?

Speaker 2:          00:11:55       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:11:55       That drug dealers on the run, he's on the run from our government, right? Isn't this the guy who escaped? I don't fucking know. You know what's going on is my fucking Internet won't let me sign on so I can't fucking see anything. I can't see the fucking highlights. Nothing. You know, while I'm up here is I fucking got one God damn channel and a bunch of Tim Horton fucking commercials, which is at Dunkin donuts. See if I can sign on here is an El Chapo, the guy that like that we would, that keeps escaping from jail. Set the Guy El Chapo. Come on man. Come on. Ah, this connection is untrusted. Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:12:31       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:12:31       Yeah. Jesus Christ. There's probably some psycho from Alberta trying to hack in here. That seems like their Texas to me. When you're up here, it's all fucking oil. Men and ranchers and Shit. Um, and then you got admitted.

Speaker 2:          00:12:47       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:12:48       10 it seems like it's nice. You know what I mean? Like that's they're like business hub. You know, I'm just totally judging these just by doing like driving through and doing a little bit of standup out here. Like when I did stand up in Calgary, great people, but fuck an animal's Jesus fucking Christ. They were animals. I don't know if it's cause the place that we performed out there was like no carpeting or nothing. They were fucking, I think it was coastal cause it was bring your own beer. Fucking animals. I would never fuck with anybody from Calgary.

Speaker 2:          00:13:20       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:13:20       I saw the way they behave when they were in a good mood. It's excited for a show. Don't have a fuck with anybody from Calgary to Edmonton. It was civilized category. Jesus Christ. They had everything but a hooker swinging from a swing. You know, back in the old days with the salons where they had the horse, you know, way overdressed. Once again, it might just be a fucking movie thing. So much. So much of my history is, is based on that. By the way. I can't get on the fucking Internet, but for some reason I could fucking, uh, I could do it over the, uh, I could do it on my phone. Let me look up El Chapo here. Like I said, he sounds like such a champ. I just think like that English thing. Chapo. He's a Mexican chap. How Mexico secretly launched a crackdown after Penn met El Chapo. El Chapo was finally captured again. That was one day ago. We'll el Chapo rat out rival cartels. Corrupt officials. It's gotta be a lot of stress. Be In this El Chapo guy. Huh? Joaquin Guzman.

Speaker 2:          00:14:29       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:14:29       You know, I got to say, he looks like a Mexican Robert Blake like during the Beretta years. Now when he says, uh, yeah, that's me who's also on the phone and it starts laughing. How else this is when you know you lived a fucking crazy life. This is just the front page of this guy's for if you search this guy's name, how El Chapo was finally captured again, we'll el Chapo. I read those. Uh, El Chapo Guzman. Sean Penn talks about them. El Chapo had erectile dysfunction surgery while on the run. It's nice to know we took a pitstop, you know, guy takes care of himself. How nervous was that doctor working on that maniacs? Dick? Uh, El Chapo speaks rolling stone. Sean Penn has terrible regret about meeting El Chapo. Well, what did he think he was going to meet? It's going to get some fucking Sherry's berries. The Hud for El Chapo, Joaquin El Chapo Guzman. The truth about the jailbreak, there's nothing here about, uh, an older, wiser El Chapo puts out a little singer Songwriter Jesus fucking Christ do. You don't realize how fucking finished we are. Just as, as, as, as a, just as a race, as a race, as humanity. So I'm trying to say, she says people were fucking done.

Speaker 2:          00:15:49       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:15:50       You know, rolling stone. Rolling stone this month as Sean Penn talking to El Chapo, Leonardo Dicaprio's on the current cover and they're billing him where he has a plan to save the planet.

Speaker 4:          00:16:04       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:16:04       What are we doing? What the fuck is that government not doing that a list. Fucking, uh, actors have to talk to drug lords and try to save the planet. I mean, there's got to be how many leaks are in the fucking damn at this point? I don't know about you guys. That does not make me feel comfortable. You know what I mean? Boomer Esiason to, uh, figure out how to cut a fucking colonize Mars. That's the next thing that they're going to have in the rolling. Rolling Stone. You don't know why the fuck do I want to hear that? Can I hear a scientist?

Speaker 2:          00:16:42       You know,

Speaker 1:          00:16:44       how about have a navy seal interview El Chapo.

Speaker 2:          00:16:48       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:16:49       I don't know, Bill, how would you shut the fuck up? I, I will. I don't know. I get unsettled. I get unsettled him. I did. I have problems with digestion. Um, I can't even remember what the fuck I was going to look up. What was I initially looking up before I got to El Chapo?

Speaker 2:          00:17:07       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:17:07       Jesus Christ. Some of the stories on that guy.

Speaker 2:          00:17:10       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:17:11       You know, it's right up there with that fucking rod Stewart rumor for way back in the day. Remember that one? I think it was, I can't even have rob Stewart over there. Yeah, they find like a gallon of ges and his stomach. His stomach had to be pumped, you know, a gallon. He went to trader Joe's and butts. I'm a fucking all natural organic fuck, I'm sorry. Um, you got a gallon of it. You know, you went to a, was those, what's that place where you buy everything in Bulk?

Speaker 2:          00:17:45       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:17:45       Fucking whales. They're pushing around those pallet jacks by Cheerios. You gotta get a membership to it because with a C it's not countries. What's the, what's the name of that shit? I ain't never go to the fucking place. Once I had to go in there and get a membership, they wanted on this fucking information.

Speaker 2:          00:18:02       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:18:04       Oh Christ. What the fuck is it called? That coat check. I'm never going to remember it. You know what I'm saying? It just kills the jokes bill when he can't remember the fucking references. It just, it absolutely kills it. Costco. Hey, what's the cost going? But one of those big fucking a gallons of fucking Jizz it on a dairy. Chugged it. Anyway, so there's, here's something on El Chapo, El Chapo. They said, uh,

Speaker 1:          00:18:31       I can't remember, like, just fucking killed this person. His whole family took their kids and I just, why I don't believe it though. He took his kids and then flew him to, uh, to Columbia and then throw him off a bridge. It's like, really? There's not any bridges in Mexico. You never know what to believe. But I gotta tell you when you go south or the u s you do not want to piss anybody off as far as I can tell. That's some next level shit. And I could say that because I just read papers from the United States. They, uh,

Speaker 1:          00:19:06       that's just, that's just next level. Like, you know, you're mad at somebody and then you know how you get your revenge is just some next, I read that, uh, killing Pablo one time, I had to put the book down like three times. Some of the shit they just said that the guy did not, I don't know if the fucking guy did this ship, but I'm a one times hearing that the guy had a party night and everybody's out there by the pool standing around, you know, and uh, what's his face there? Pablo Escobar standing there. You know, everybody's ignoring the weight that he's putting on as he sits there in his fucking Hagar action slacks. You know, you seem to like those. He's stretched and, uh, you know, still tucked them in right at the waist, you know what I mean? Talk to him, writing the waste.

Speaker 1:          00:19:48       Didn't push the pants down, didn't do the fucking shirt on, tucked. He tucked it right in. And uh, they said that he allegedly filed one of his, uh, one of the people they don't want to, it's not as, but one of the maids, I don't know what allegedly was stealing. So they tied this guy's legs together and his arms behind his back and they threw him in the house pool and just watched him drown. Is everyone was standing there at the party, you know, I'd say they must have been a lot of ice shaking and drinks after that one. Like so is this a Victorian house? Pablo? Mr Escobar. Oh, I want to go to the pool. Um, yeah. People get their faces ripped off. Is it torture or death? They like peeling their fucking faces back. This is not funny. This is not what this podcast is about. Um, why is this fucking stealer Denver game so fucking boring?

Speaker 2:          00:20:43       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:20:44       Is it, cause I have the sound down. I just don't give a fuck the afcs just the walking wounded Rothenberg is a fucking man. Look at that guy just getting bumped by Lyman. He stays in there. That guy, he has like fucking, he stays in the pocket like Steve Grogan use to use to stay in the pocket. Did anybody remember that? Any old pats fans out there? You'd fucking sit there and say, this is back when you could literally, you could hammer a fucking quarterback, drive your helmet right under his chin and then lift them off the ground and pile. Drive them into the fucking astro turf.

Speaker 2:          00:21:18       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:21:18       Which is like getting tackled in a parking lot that's been, uh, painted green and Steve Drogan. But he would go back for a pass. It's back when he had that fucking neck brace and he had such a long neck, he could still see like six inches of neck. Right. Even what the neck brace, and there'd be some defensive lineman just running full speed right at him. And he, he would just hang onto it, hang on to it, hang on to it, and then he would throw the ball and the camera would follow the football. And right as he let it go, you'd see just the beginning of that fucking Lyman drilling them and he'd go flying right out the right side of your screen or left side, depending on which way he was going down the field to Stanley Morgan, you know, Bruce Francis, one of those fucking guys, right? Harold Jackson. Who else did we have back then? I can't even fucking remember.

Speaker 2:          00:22:09       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:22:10       Hasselbeck it Hasselbeck whose son was the one who said, uh, we want the ball and we're going to score

Speaker 1:          00:22:19       don Hasselbeck. I think it was his dead. All right. Anyways, what, where the fuck am I? Um, yeah, Rothenberg is like that. That guy stands in the pocket. It takes a fucking hit and speak in which to, uh, I know there's a lot of Kansas City fans would probably pissed off at the calls Tom Brady got and the lack of call said Alex Smith got Ed. Uh, I'm a patriots fed. Uh, you're absolutely right, but that is not Tom Brady's fault. Okay. And I'm hoping most of you guys at Kansas City can hear what I'm saying because you're not as upset because you got to see your baseball team when the world series. Right? So you got that going for you. Half of you professional teams won championships this year. That's pretty fucking good. Right? Um, Tom Brady earned those costs. Okay. This is the, if you want Alex Smith to get those calls in the future, in the future, he has to make the NFL owners a lot more money than he is.

Speaker 1:          00:23:16       And that's just a simple fact. And, uh, people call it the Tom Brady rules. It isn't, it's the superstar rules. You know, Jordan gets away with the push. Right. Was the last time you Coby Brian, what does Colby Bryant have to do to get, you know, well, he's not healthy anymore, but back in the day you could be standing in the lane before the fucking game starts and if he runs into you that they're going to call it on you, he'd literally have to take, he'd have to fucking tie an ax to the front of knee and fucking jump into your, cut your head off before, you know, there was a way to call offsetting. They would have, it's just, it's just how it works. But, um,

Speaker 1:          00:23:54       I have to say as much as he earned the calls, that one where he was getting sacked and he switched it to his left hand in throw it and they still gave him the call was fucking ridiculous. I even as a page, it's fair, I was at hall going, Oh, what the fuck? Give me a break, but you know, I'll take it. Of course they'll take it the same way you would have. Uh, but uh, I don't care to see as a great team and they have, you know, Alex Smith, I think he's going to be a really fucking great quarterback, but you got to have it all, man. He got to have the coach and the ownership and all that bullshit and lucky enough that we have that in, uh, in New England. So there you go. That's me trying to not be a cunt.

Speaker 3:          00:24:33       All right. And uh,

Speaker 1:          00:24:37       Oh God, I can't wait to go home and watch that fucking Carolina Panther game, man. I think you're going to see like all these people that they were saying or the heir apparent to fucking Tom Brady and Peyton manning. I think it is. I think it's what's his face there and the panthers. I kid, you remember his fucking name? What is wrong with me? He went to Auburn, right? He's a superman thick cam Newton. There we go.

I was like, I gotta I gotta find this out, man. I got to find out, uh, you know, if anybody's ever done it, cause I was like, there's no way anybody's done it. In my lifetime of watching the last 30 something years of watching football, holy fuck. I've been watching football for 38 years. Oh my God, I'm old.

Speaker 2:          00:33:56       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:33:57       I started watching it religiously in about 1978. Um, yeah, about that. 78, 79. Jesus fucking Christ. Um, put it this way. The first Superbowl I watched was super bold 12th and there is 50, so there you go. Wow. This is going to be my, uh,

Speaker 2:          00:34:20       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:34:21       Well would that be my 50, not 51st? You fucking idiot. My 39th Superbowl 50 minus 12. Plus I watched 12, right?

Speaker 2:          00:34:30       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:34:30       Yeah. So that day. There you go. Yeah, there's a lot of people right now actually think I'm wrong, but it's true. This is my 39th I'm going to be watching anyways. Let's plow ahead here. Um, so I looked it up. Successful Hail Marys. Okay. Um, there's only one guy that I saw since they started keeping the stats in 1975, at least on Wikipedia. I didn't go to the football reference.com which I love.

Speaker 3:          00:34:55       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:34:58       The one guy who's ever done done it twice since they kept the stats in 1975, Steve Bart Koski,

Speaker 1:          00:35:07       Steve Bark Koski and there's no way to picture Steve our Koski and not have the song, this song go through your head walking on a never thought I could be so free. He throwing the ball to Bailey, watch, choose Johnson and to another guy. Yeah. He looked like the greatest American hero. He did it in 1978 against the saints. And then he did it again in 1983 against the 40 niners in the NFC west, which back then was only four teams. It was the Los Angeles Rams, the New Orleans saints, the Atlanta Falcons, and the San Francisco 40 niners quarterbacks or Steve Bark Koski, uh, [inaudible] 78 seat bark house. He, Archie Manning.

Speaker 2:          00:35:58       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:35:59       And I think they had a quarterback controversy. Pat Haden, Vince Ferragamo back and forth, uh, for Vince covert gum. I tried to take the money and went to the fucking CFL. Oh, Jewish. Never saw him again. And, uh, it would be Steve to Burger Jim Plunkett at 78. I did this with fucking Joe Bart. Nick, one time. We tried to name all the starting quarterbacks in the NFL in 1978 we went around the league. I, so I think it was a AFC east was Burt Jones, Bob Greasy, Steve Grogan, Richard Todd and Joe Ferguson for the bills.

Speaker 2:          00:36:39       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:36:40       Then it was Terry Bradshaw, Dan Pastor Reni.

Speaker 2:          00:36:46       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:36:47       Who the fuck was quarterback for the browns? It was either Mike Phipps or, uh, Brian's site. And then the bangles was Kenny Anderson. Kenny the candle as Collins were sent. They Call Him Kenny the candle, cause one blow and he was out. You ever see that one on NFL films and they cut the Kitty Anderson. He's like, I'll fuck Collins worth. Um, and let's see, it was Craig Morton. I'll just do the AFC, cause I know this just fucking drive and everybody not split it. This is my, if I have to do it now, because now it's in my head. Craig Morton, was it the orange crush Broncos. Ken Stabler. Kenny Snake Stabler for the, uh, the Raiders. Dan Fouts, the Great Dan Fouts Air Corre l with the gadgets.

Speaker 2:          00:37:38       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:37:39       Jim Zorn with Seattle and then a fuck. There's always the one that gets me. Who the fuck was with the chiefs? It was before black lynch was after Len Dawson. Who the fuck was the quarterback? There's a good one for you. There's some poor bastard in Kansas City right now screaming it. Yeah. Who the fuck was it? I even know, I think like the Buccaneers had Gary hough. Lynn Dickey was out in Green Bay.

Speaker 1:          00:38:11       Jim Hart was it? How the fuck do I remember those? I remember Kansas City, Kansas. See, I gotta look this up. Kansas City chief quarterback. Hey, it's going to get better guys. I played drums this week out and I played with, uh, Colin Hay from men at work, right? I'm going to tell a story in a second here. Just fucking deal with this here. Kansas City chiefs, Qb 1978. Why do I care? Why do I fucking care? Lists of Kansas City chief quarterbacks. This is fucking made for me. Who's the last person who fucking went to this starting quarterback season to season Jesus. They've had some guys. Yeah. Joe Montana. Warren Moon. Rich Gannon.

Speaker 2:          00:38:57       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:38:57       All right. Here we go. Here we go. Back. Ended up backing it up.

Speaker 2:          00:39:02       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:39:02       1970 I, I'd never get this. Mike Livingston and Tony Adams. This is the one that always fucking gets me.

Speaker 2:          00:39:10       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:39:10       Lenny Dawson left in 1975 and then Mike Livingston took over.

Speaker 2:          00:39:19       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:39:21       You know, there was a guy who played for the Bengals that Bill Walsh was talking about. He only played for one season. He got fucking injured. And Bill Walsh to this day still said he's the greatest quarterback that he ever coached, but he's probably still trying to motivate or he was, anyways, he passed away, probably still trying to motivate fucking Montana or young, even after they retired, get them to rake the leaves better that day or some shit. Um, I can't remember the guy's fucking neighbor. That's one to look up. Uh, anyways, so yeah, this, this week I did a Greg Behrendt show at Largo and uh, it was one of those things too. It's not quite like the goddamn comedy jam. This was one where they actually have people, uh, for the most part it's musicians coming out and telling funny stories. And this is something that Greg did a number of years ago and, uh, he's brought the show back.

Speaker 1:          00:40:15       And, um, so anyways, let me, let me get the line up here so I don't fuck this up. I did take a picture of it. I'm so fucking disorganized. I apologize. Um, all right. So it was Colin. Hey, Tom Morello, myself and Chris Fairbanks and other comedians. So it was two comedians and then a two musicians. And I got to a, I got to play with the band, told some stories, and I got to play with the band. And then afterwards I got to play with Colin Hay and we played, uh, who can it be now, which was a just beyond a fucking thrilled. And he, he was the nicest fucking guy, so generous to let me play. Um, then he had this really cool way that he wanted to bring me out. He goes, uh, he just went out there and he's telling stories. He was fucking hilarious.

Speaker 1:          00:41:06       And then he just randomly goes, you know, and I had the weirdest dream last night. I was dreaming, I was playing a show and a, I was playing, you know, who could it be now in the crowd collapse because it's such a huge hit. And he goes, the weirdest thing, you know, it, Bill Burr was on drums, like, you know, and I just waited a second. Then I just walked out and sat down. Everybody started laughing and then he told this great story. I'm not going to repeat the story. Just it's his story. So I'm sure if he wants to tell it on a podcast, he kit, but he tells his fucking hilarious story that ends with the word cunt. And he told me after I say cunt,

Speaker 1:          00:41:47       basically you do the drum fill intro and then we'll go into the song and uh, let me play it anyway. And I went off, went off pretty good man. It actually, uh, I don't know. It's fucking unreal, man. I played like 20 years by myself in a rehearsal space until it finally dawned on me that I'm supposed to be out interacting with other fucking people. So now then I've kind of opened Pandora's box. I just, I told you, I made this rule that I'm not going to ask to sit in, but if somebody asks me to play, I'm going to fucking play. All right. That includes if I come to your town and if I'm drinking at a bar, if I go out to a bar and your local band is playing, if you come up to me and asked me to sit in with your band, I'm going to fucking do it. All right. I know. And this is a warning.

Speaker 1:          00:42:36       It's a warning. I'm going to do it and I've got to fuck up. So you know, if you want a story, I'll fucking do it because it's fun as hell to me. And it's weird. I don't feel any pressure whatsoever because I'm a comedian. Well, what's the pressure? He's going to sit down and play drunk. She's going to stick. Of course he is. Everybody already knows it, so it's fine. Um, plus everybody just looks at the singer anyways, but it's, uh, it's a lot of fun. And I've been getting cycled back into lessons and, um, I told you I've been taking, I've been taking some lessons. Um, do you remember long time ago when I watched that Mars Volta Video and, uh, I was talking about that drummer who was Dave [inaudible] at the time. I was going, Holy Fuck, look at this guy's fucking unbelievable, blah, blah blah.

Speaker 1:          00:43:26       Well, from doing that, he must have heard the clip. He reached out to me on Twitter and Lo and behold, he lives in La. And every once in a while I go by and I take a lesson with the guy and uh, he's a fucking unbelievable teacher and he's been teaching me technique. So my, you know, I'm one of those guys, I grabbed the drumsticks the same way, like a toddler would, would just my fit meaty fucking fist, just right over both of them and it was causing my arms to be doing all the work and my forum, if ain't drummers are listening to this, if you have like that fucking, you know, that pain in your forums and all that, you know, that's, I was kinda going through that shit and he is teaching me this technique where you let the stick do the work and it's holding it in this particular way that does not seem fucking natural at all.

Speaker 1:          00:44:16       And, uh, it has been a motherfucker, but you know, incrementally, I've been gradually working its way into my playing and, uh, it's been, it's totally been worth it. And we've been going through this jazz book and I'm like most students, like I work on something for three seconds and then want to go onto the next thing so I can have that sense of accomplishment and just get through a whole fucking page and a, and I was moving ahead and every time I'd go to the lesson, I would still not have the, the first thing down.

Speaker 2:          00:44:51       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:44:52       And I've been taking lessons, you know, on and off since the summer. I mean, I get busy and I can't go for like a month or something, but, um, I'm still on that first page and it finally dawned on me in the past week that to be like, dude, just work on this one fucking thing and fuck everything else. And I just sort of sat down 15 minutes a day just working on this thing. Um,

Speaker 2:          00:45:14       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:45:15       You know, make it a little bit of an improvement and then being fuck having to start over. And Blah, blah, blah, Blah and all that shit. And um, I actually had a great lesson this week where I think he actually was saying that I was just, I was finally starting to improve, which made my fucking week. So anyways, um, I even know what the fuck I'm going with this. I'm rambling all over the place. What are we up to here? 45 minutes. Jesus Christ. Bill, can we fucking get on with this here? Um, oh, by the way, somebody told me to watch the show. Top boy, TLP boy on Netflix.

Speaker 2:          00:45:49       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:45:49       And uh, I want to Netflix for the life I can, I can figure out how to search when I'm on the Internet. I can't fuck it. Do it when I'm on the TV. I don't know. How do you search when you were on the TV? If anybody knows? I would really appreciate it. But anyways, I'm going to be, um,

Speaker 1:          00:46:03       I'm going to be a playing out again this week. Uh, I'm doing that Bonzo bash thing. I'm hosting the Bonzo Bash Co hosting and I don't even know who I'm co hosting with. It's going to be an Anaheim this Friday night. And, um, uh, Brian Tish, she's wonderful event or all these dramas that I grew up watching sit down and play led Zeppelin songs, which is going to be the shit I'm going to get to host it and a with somebody else. It's going to be fucking awesome. So, and I will be sitting in for one song once again, risking total humiliation, which, you know, I'll probably make an ass of myself. Who gives a fuck, right? Um, but anyways, uh, oh, I knew what I wanted to talk about.

Speaker 2:          00:46:47       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:46:48       Fucking the Arizona cardinals packers game. I started to talk about it and uh, you would think last week after watching that dude on the Bengals intercept the ball and then fucking walk into the locker room like, well, I guess that's that, right? You'd think that these, these damn kids today, they'd learned something. Patrick Peterson, who I fucking love Lsu Kid, right? It didn't complete fourth down. That ought to fucking do it. Two and a half minutes left. This guy's walking down the sideline waving to the crowd, doing damn near blowing kisses. To the crowd. Like it's over. What he's playing pack is in Aaron fucking Rogers. Fucking hilarious. Two and a half minutes of football left and he's walking around doing that. And what happened? Two minutes and 25 football seconds later he gets beat on a jump ball in the fucking end zone on a hail Mary to send it into overtime. Um,

Speaker 1:          00:47:51       fucking unbelievable. How many times is somebody going to fucking do that? How many times are you going to run down the field? You got the football, you're not past the goal line. You already start holding it out. It don baby slaps it out of your hand or you're fucking, you know, you have to be a spike. It over the, you know, over your back. You know that one we had throw it down over your shoulder and you get big toes across the end zone, but the ball is, and how many fucking times you're going to see people do that. I just don't understand why I don't get it. So anyways, let's plow ahead here. Uh,

That's probably the Ron Ron reference. Who knows, you know, the little ass country that people know, uh, about because of Austin Powers. Oh, I thought I knew them from a, I thought isn't, that's not Brussels. The muscles from Brussels. That was the guy who used to, who's the guy used to do the splits. Now Fuck is the guy's name.

Speaker 1:          00:51:03       Yeah. Luxembourg and Belgium. Right,

Speaker 1:          00:51:06       right. They're a tucked in there. Right there. A battle of the bulge right there and in France and Germany. My nuts in between a Amsterdam in a fucking Denmark. They're Copenhagen. You get tucked right there staring at the fucking a bad teeth of that. The English, aren't you looking across the channel? Maybe not enough. Maybe if I had a map I could find it. Yeah. All right. Love Aptis F is for family. Please come to our, our freckle of a country. Uh, dude, I'm definitely going to go there. I'm definitely going to go there without a fucking doubt. I'm a, and we're waiting to hear about the second season for F is for family. The pitch went fucking great. Uh, when out of there, we were all excited. I got a great feeling about it and I'm going to let you guys know as soon as I find out. Um,

Speaker 1:          00:51:55       I got a good feeling about it. So, uh, and I'm definitely going to do a European tour. I did Australia and Asia last year, so this time it's time. We had the other way. I'm going to do a Europe this time and I want to hit all the countries I've been to. I'd like to add a few more and I also want to do a little bit of eastern Europe, but, uh, if we do get a second season, I don't know how many episodes that would be. I would think it'd be at least 10. And then, you know, we got to sit down and write them and if we want to make it as good as the first season, you know, and even better, which of course we do, it's gonna take a lot of times. So I got to kind of figure out, you know, uh, once they give us the Yay or nay on that.

Speaker 1:          00:52:30       But like I said, I got a really, really, really positive vibes. A lot of laughs in the room and, um, which is always good. So anyways, he said, the guy says anyway, I've heard you talking about cooking more Asian food. I'll wait. This is a different one. Um, oh, it's the same guy. Sorry. And He, this is the same guy from Belgium because anyways, I've heard you talking about wanting to cook more Asian food on your podcast since I love cooking as well. Please allow me to recommend you. Some Korean cuisine has a lot of spicy food. Oh yeah. Kimchi and all that stuff. Um, yeah, I've, I've been to those Korean barbecue and all this stuff. I love all of that stuff, but to, it's just so different from the stuff here. I'm really intimidated, um, about cooking it, uh, which is so stupid, you know, if I'm on, if I'm afraid of it, I should just just sit down and be like, okay, let's start with something easy.

Speaker 1:          00:53:27       How do you make the sticky rice? You know, if you could just make sticky rice alone, that's the shit, right? That's the best fucking rice there is. I don't wanna hear everybody tell me it's not fucking healthy. I don't give a fuck. You know, it's fucking delicious. Korean cuisine has a lot of spicy food, which is great for losing weight since you tend to be full more quickly and drink more water. Plus a lot of other health benefits. If you are interested, please check out. Uh, I cannot, it's m a n G. C H. I on Youtube. Oh, I've got it. Do this. Uh, I guess I go, I guess this is a lady. She's a Korean housewife who is funny as hell. It learns, uh, teaches you, you said learns you how to cook. It's teachers, teaches you how to cook great traditional and overall easy recipes. Now you've got to teach me some Belgian words. I gave you a one there, Huh? Uh, recommendations are a Belgium words. Belgian eum a rep recommendations are spicy pork stir fry. Jinxing chicken.

Speaker 1:          00:54:39       I didn't know how to say this. It's j. A J. A m. E. O. N. G. Judge. I'm young. That sounds like an annoying character in fucking star wars, which is black bean sauce, noodles. Some other shit that I can't say Korean barbecue, which I bet you've had before. Yeah, I have. What does that, the hacky American thing? Well, I've had Korean food. I went to Korea at barbecue. I literally just said that Japanese cuisine is mostly salty, sweet, Umami. What does Umami mean? Is that Umami Burger Bender that flavors? Lots of vegetables. No butter soy sauce, which is amazing for you. Enrich, enrich, tastes. Yeah. I got to tell you mad people when I went over the age of man, they will fucking in shape people adjusted shape over there.

Speaker 3:          00:55:24       You know?

Speaker 1:          00:55:27       I bet if you have fat in Asia, they just mean looking at rich motherfucker. He must be traveling. He's got enough money to get to an Applebee's. I don't fucking a, I'm too tired. I didn't want to say Applebee's. Applebee's is not a fattening places. It what's a good fat? She said, I'll just wrap up the podcast. Okay. If I'm going to be this off right now, what the fuck's going to happen when I go to do my shows tonight? All right. Now Chinese food, I don't know a lot about. A cool to know is that Chinese food in the states and Europe is not actual Chinese food. No, it isn't. That's their surreptitious way of trying to fucking kill us. That's what they're trying to do. They know we have the bomb, right. They could, they, they, that China is attacking us on two levels right now, giving us food that's going to give us a heart attack and they're going to fuck with our economy somehow. Somehow we're tied in with them and they're going to pull the fucking rug out anyways. He said modified for our taste buds, but I'm guessing they have amazing stuff too. Yeah, I would think. I would think so.

Speaker 3:          00:56:29       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:56:31       No, fuck am I getting the hiccups here? Uh, Thai in Vietnamese food is mostly spring rolls. Jesus Christ, she'd go, oh, went through the whole continent here.

Speaker 3:          00:56:39       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:56:40       We get some water. Oh fuck. Completely missed the glass.

Speaker 1:          00:56:48       Fucking bad angle here. Um, lastly, okay. No Thai and Vietnamese. Mostly spring rolls. Spicy Curry. I love our guy from fucking Belgium is telling me about Asian food or you at least Asian, lots of coriander, which I personally did because it tasted of dishwasher product, dishwasher, product. Lastly, if you really want to go hardcore, try out North Korean food, it's basically starving yourself. You'll be able to see your ginger pube Ding Dong without a mirror. Again, in no time, Pretty Edgy, Huh? Yes. You're making fun of the fact that they under a dictator that doesn't feed a very edgy, very edgy, uh, hope this helped go fuck yourself. Lots of love for Nia and old [inaudible] audio. Um, oh shit. I guess I'll give the shit, you know, I love how Asia stops with people that we can, you know, it doesn't go into India. That's also Asia, right? Is in the Middle East. Isn't that also Asia? Russia,

Speaker 1:          00:57:45       you know. Anyway, I like that guy and fucking Forrest Gump. Alright. Hey, Billy Beane, uh, been a fan of the podcast for a while now. Yada Yada. I need some advice or just a fresh perspective on what to do. I'm 23. Ah, yeah. The primary life dropped out of high school, like a dip shit at 17. Got My GED when I was 19. I you back in the game, you back in the game and he decided to start becoming a productive member of society. Everything was going good. Paycheck meant uh, the dating pool opened up, tried a few jobs, et cetera. But now I'm 23. I quit my job to go to, to go to school for advertising. Slash art at an artsy college should probably mentioned the only thing I'm truly good at. His art, mainly pen and ink stuff. Well that's a great thing and he can make a ton of fucking money doing that.

Speaker 1:          00:58:36       It's just, it's schools generally speaking, are not geared towards that. Um, so yeah, you will fucking bored and then you took shit that you weren't good at, made you feel like an asshole. You fucking drop out. You partied for a few years. Right. Bagged a couple of who is and now you coming back. Dude, you're fine. You're 23, dude, you're fine. Uh, that was eight months ago. I missed the sign. I missed the sign up date. And just lack the general knowledge slash support on going about it. I spent six months grinding the living shit out of drawing, trying to achieve something I might be able to take some pride in. Didn't work. I was just going to say, you're being too hard on yourself. Your next line is, I'm hard myself to the point where I'm thinking I'll never be handed a metal is the greatest that ever fucking live, so why bother? Ah, Jesus, dude. Well listen, Richard Pryor's the greatest of all time and I'll never come close to that guy. That does not going to stop me. You just try to see how close you can come. Some people you can't pass and that's all right. You know, you just try to come as close to them. Try to just like try to go as high up the all time ladder as you possibly can, and who knows? If you keep pushing yourself,

Speaker 1:          00:59:57       that's it.

Speaker 1:          01:00:00       You don't know what your limits are to you. You keep fucking throwing yourself out there. Especially if you're hard on yourself. You probably be in way. You're way better than you think you are. You're going to be fine. All right. You'd get you're depressing me here anyway. I have since quit drawing and now do nothing but troll around dating sites all day and hooking up with semi decent looking women, women as a way to stay positive and cure boredom. I'm not lazy. I've done primarily law, manual labor jobs and no, I have the back for, but Jesus Christ, I can't force myself to pull the trigger on anything because I can't be the top of the crop of the very God damn best. I want people fulfilled. I've been standing at a crossroad, my Dick in my hand for nearly a year and he's sort of vice be fucking amazing. Don't hold back. If you think I need to be ripped a new one, I can handle it. Thanks. Go Fuck Yourself. Yeah, Dude, you've got yourself into a completely paralyzed state here because it's like you got it. You just bought a guitar and because you're not Jimmy Hendrix, within the first two weeks, you're going to fucking quit. All right. If Jimi Hendrix did that, he wouldn't be Jimi Hendrix. All right.

Speaker 1:          01:01:06       All right. And they'd look just

Speaker 2:          01:01:09       okay

Speaker 1:          01:01:09       if you, whatever you like to do in life, just go out and do it all right and enjoy it and don't put that level of pressure on yourself.

Speaker 2:          01:01:17       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:01:17       Like what was your, was your dad like the Great Santini is something that, I'm trying to figure out why you like this, but like, um, the reason why he can't pull the trigger on anything else in life is because you actually have a strong, I think you have a strong sense on what makes you happy and what you want to do. All right. And you know that despite the fact that you'd be totally negative but you're drawing, you know that that's what you want to do and you have such a passion for it that you're that hard on yourself. And then also it's preventing you from getting a job at the fucking Costco or wherever the God damn place you're going to end up fucking working at. Um,

Speaker 2:          01:01:58       okay.

Speaker 1:          01:01:58       I would, I don't know if I was you, I would continue drawing. I get into computers and all that. There's all kinds of stuff. I've seen people do drugs on computers, and they turned that into building websites, which helps to pay for that their studio and the shit that they really want to do this. There's tons of money to making the arts. Don't, don't let anybody ever fucking tell you that there isn't it did you? Just helping people make it in show business. All right? This p people will get head shots, give acting classes and all that. Just doing that shit. People make a small fucking fortunate. So if you actually a talented artists, you can actually, you're going to be fine. Um, you just have to stop beating the shit out of yourself. All right? So, uh, just pay attention to that voice in your head. And when it tells you you can't do something, just tell it to shut the fuck up basically. Even if you have to say it out loud, you don't just make sure you're not looking at somebody you care about as they're telling you a story. When you think of those thoughts, just, you know, maybe, maybe say it in your brain first. All right? Okay. Advice. No one to relate to cheeses. He's a fucking gloomy this week. All right. Advice. No one to relate to causing loading loneliness.

Speaker 2:          01:03:10       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:03:11       All right. Hey, Billy batts love the podcasts you stand up after it's her family. Uh, they all put a smile on my face. Well, that's great. Okay. I'm sensing that all of a sudden now the smile is going to go away. I hope you read this because he had under my problem is I have no one to relate to and I fear I might as well read this year. I hope you read this because I've been doing everything positive, but I just can't seem to get my life where I want it to be. It's a bit of a long road, so please bear with me. Oh, fuck us. It's a long email dude. You know, I can't read out loud.

Speaker 2:          01:03:44       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:03:44       All right. My problem is I have no one to relate to and I fear I might be co this might be causing me

Speaker 1:          01:03:51       to be lonely in life. I fear that if I continue the way I'm going, I may never get over. I'm in my last semester of college and an engineering program and if made almost no friends throughout my entire stay at college, I am at the top of my classes and I'm lining up jobs at big tech companies. Now you're probably managing some point extra with the pocket pocket protector and all that. Actually I was, that's exactly, that was the picture you were painting, sir. Uh, quite the opposite actually. I had been working out for a few years now and I have one and I am one of the Jack to people in my classes. All right. So now a picture is that dude in American psycho, highly achieving, totally shredded, cannot relate to human beings. Um, I dress well, eat healthy. Please tell me you don't listen to Huey, a Huey Lewis and the news.

Speaker 1:          01:04:42       Um, and always make sure to keep myself clean. I feel like I might alienate my classmates from interacting with me. They probably think I'm just a jock in their class where it's quite the opposite. I'm into gaming, chess and all of that though. Do you like a fucking a renaissance man here? So I figure I might try to interact with the opposite crowd, the Non Geeky people. I know a way to meet people is to get out there and do something. I I like doing, playing some sport or joining a club or volunteering. The problem is with my PR program and my work, I have little time to be doing much else. The free time I have is Friday or Saturday nights that I spent by myself playing video games or playing guitar because I have nothing else to do. Well, you could go out those nights.

Speaker 2:          01:05:27       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:05:27       All right. It wasn't always this way. This is like a movie. When I was in high school, my life was completely the opposite. I didn't work out, eat healthy, work hard or nothing, but I always find ways to make new friends, make people laugh and start conversations. Now that I'm doing everything right, it seems my only problem is social. Oh Jesus Christ. Dude. So you know what you're doing. You just too busy. I fear once I graduate college, things will only get worse. I lost all of my faith, my family, apart from my older brother who was in another country. So once I graduate college, I'll truly be alone. No one to grab a beer with no one to help me move or anything helped me move or anything. Despite all this, I try to be positive and thankful for what I have and what I have accomplished.

Speaker 1:          01:06:04       Sorry for the long email and go fuck yourself. Yeah, Dude. You just look, you already know how to make friends. I would, you need to make time to do it. Um, played video games by yourself is very antisocial. Uh, playing guitars. Always. Cool. That's fun. Why don't you play guitar with somebody else? Find somebody, plays drums. I play Bass. Get together, do some covers, you know, jam. Fuck around. Get off, drink some beers. Invite some ladies over. You do every week you just add some more shit, right? You know, start taking bets. Open your own fucking a draft kinks. You know, maybe start selling coke. Just keep expanding your ring of a social interaction. I'm obviously fucking with you, but no, I would, uh, there's a bunch of people that are into video games. Why don't you find somebody that you can play against? Can you do that anymore? The kids do that or do you have to go online to do it? You know, is that like Corny? Now doesn't two people not sit next to each other with an Atari with a joy stick and the one red button is, are we past that? I don't fucking know, but it seems like you know how to do that stuff. He just got busy. And, uh, with all your achievements, you, you know, sometimes, you know, when you go after a goal, some things suffer. All right. I've talked about this numerous times when I was on, um,

Speaker 1:          01:07:27       you know, when I was 36 years old though, I was fucking living alone in a studio apartment that they called the one bedroom, sleeping on a futon. I remember days just going by going, what the fuck have I done? The only thing I've worked on is trying to become a comedian. Everything else is at the starting line. And, uh, over the next 10 years, I just worked on some shit like that. So that's all you need to do. All right. Jesus Christ. I'm starting to feel like doctor Phil here. Um, all right. What do we got here? Third and goal? Broncos have the ball with three minutes left and I'll do an a fucking podcast. Touchdown Broncos.

Speaker 2:          01:08:02       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:08:03       All right. All right. Broncos ne go celebrate and act like a bunch of fucking idiots when Ben Roethlisberger has three minutes left.

Speaker 2:          01:08:10       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:08:11       This one is not over. All right. So what does this do? This puts them up by five people in the crowd holding up two fingers. Like the crowd's going to look at them. Oh yeah. Yeah. We should go for two, shouldn't we? We shouldn't just be up by six. Thank you. Thank you. The you and the fucking a mezzanine level. Ah, fuck.

Speaker 3:          01:08:31       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:08:32       Are we gonna have to go to Denver? Is this going to be one more? One more break? Either way. This is going to be great. Either you get to see Brady versus Peyton manning. One more time.

Speaker 3:          01:08:45       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:08:45       I'm assuming he's retiring, which is stupid. Or you get to see another patriots, a Steelers matchup with fucking big Ben. Big Bad. Not Afraid of anything. Big Bed, both grade teams. All right. That's the podcast for this week. I apologize that my head was kind of all over the place. I don't know what flying and going to the fucking airport does to me.

Speaker 3:          01:09:08       MMM.

Speaker 1:          01:09:10       But, uh, it makes me even more fucking scatter brained. So anyways, go fuck yourself and I will talk to you on Thursday. Okay. All right.
