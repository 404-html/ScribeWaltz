Speaker 1:          00:00:01       Hey, what's going on? It's bill burr and it's the Monday morning podcast for Monday, November 25th, 2013. How you doing? How are you happy thanksgiving. Eat some Turkey and some stuffing and Gravy

Speaker 2:          00:00:20       v.

Speaker 1:          00:00:22       Then he'd saw Paul. Why? I love Thanksgiving. I really do. But you know, I'm actually a, I'm leaving the country of going to be an ex patriot. Now I'm leaving the country. Um, the Wednesday before thanksgiving, I didn't even realize that this is going to be the first thanksgiving I ever spend, you know, outside of the country. I'm actually going to be over in Italy like, like, like one of the, some of the army guys back in the day in World War II sitting over there when no moon itch your eye like a big pizza pie. Shoot him in the face. Um, getting ready for my big European tour over there. Have you buddy? You know, I didn't realize when we went to book this thing, how fucking cold it was going to be in Scandinavia in December. And I just did some, uh, some interviews there for the, a Norwegian journal or the fucking Swedish, uh, a periodical, whatever the fuck I, whoever I was talking to over there. And um, they told me they were laughing that I was coming over there like, why are you coming over here now? Which is never a good sign. You know, when the people of the nation are not ope we like or not welcoming you with open arms, they're immediately going like, yeah, you sure you want to do this?

Speaker 1:          00:01:47       I guess the sun goes down at three in the afternoon. I can't believe it's like, is it that far fucking north? And I'm starting to think about it. I'm like, wait a minute. If he goes straight across from Massachusetts where I grew up, where do you end up? Mediterranean Sea. The south of Spain. I okay. I don't even fucking know. And then I'm thinking like, wait a minute, they've wired a minute, their way, the fuck up there. They're like, Yukon territory's did that high up, you know, cause you look at a fucking map, it's flat. You spin a globe, you can't see it. It's, it's around the corner. Where is it? Where is, you know, am I supposed to take a strength? I didn't fucking know. So evidently it's going to, the sun's going to go down at three, then it's going to be cold as hell. I don't give a shit. It's still going to be a good time, you know, break up my party. Um,

Speaker 3:          00:02:41       yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:02:42       You know what's funny though is I talked to this person in Iceland, the radio show, and they said, okay, before we start this, I got to do the, uh, I got, uh, you know, they were, we were recording it for the radio and he goes, all right, before I, uh, I asked you the questions, I just have to do a intro, so I'm like, this, this, and this is always cool because they speak in their native tongue and then they go right back to you. And I had never heard the Icelandic language and it's fucking cool as hell. You know what it sounds like. Remember when they would play lyrics backwards, that devil shit on, on metal records. That's what it sounded like. And he's like, okay, I'm going to do the intro of a Ba. I can't do, I can't even do the accent.

Speaker 1:          00:03:23       Then he just goes, Rashi up to the opposite cause I'm about to gift build births. It's riskier option and offering more stand up comedy or a lot barrel. So you're coming to our country, it's like, oh my God, I opt these fucking people going to be bilingual because there's no way I could ever make that. You know? There's certain languages that I feel like I could make like Spanish. I know if I could just find some beautiful Spanish woman to teach me Mexican, Latino, whatever the fuck I'm supposed to say. If you just come over here with your Brown titties hanging out of your fucking beautiful white blouse, you know, I could learn the damn language. All right? If I could get some French woman dress up, like one of those horror, I would have it down. The problem is as I sit here with this Rosetta stone and I'm talking to a fucking computer, where is the motivation? The second I walk away from the computer, I can immediately speak English and to do anything I want. I can get food, I go to Africa, I go to Asia, they can do whatever I want. Um, why don't I just think of that weird girl and a breakfast club? Um, I didn't know if that was the proper quote.

Speaker 1:          00:04:45       Anyways, back to what the fuck I was talking about. So like the motivation isn't there. So what I think I'm going to do this next time I try Rosetta stone to learn Spanish, French, whatever the fuck I'm trying is I'm just going to have beautiful women like pictures of them on the wall. Even then what's second to do?

Speaker 1:          00:05:04       You don't what they should have. They should just start like, you know, like they have like those, those late at night talk to some hottie and they just show these ridiculously hot women. They're like, yeah, hey, for some reason nobody's buying me a bunch of stuff tonight. I'm just sitting here with my panties on. Why don't you call me up and talk to me? You visited back fat. Fuck right. Any of you, you know what isn't true, but you want to believe it. So this might be a good business and I don't want to start a fucking business. All right. I have no, so feel free to steal this idea. What you do is you hire a bunch of hotties to Skype with people to teach them the language of the nation. Nah, that would work because the might have times that they would click to talk to somebody and all they would see is just some dick getting fucking stroked.

Speaker 1:          00:05:54       That would just be really traumatic for those beautiful women. And why would you want to that? You know, if they were nice enough, if they were nice enough to like take time from being hot to teach somebody at different language, they're probably at the person so they shouldn't be subjected to that. All those other horse that are just walking around being hot for hot sake for the sake of being hot and getting a free Jello shot. You know, I, I wouldn't have a problem with them having some video dick like shook in the face. Does that make sense? I'm unbelievably fucking jet lagged. Everybody's speaking of smart people. I did it, a college gig at this theater and a, and I literally flew out and came right back. So I don't even know the name of it. I have no idea. It's the second time I've been there and I want to shoot a special there. The crowd was fucking awesome. They're okay. I showed you my respect. But um, I went there because me and version went to the Harvard Yale game at the Yale Bowl, the original bowl in the United States of America. This is the one that started all of it. The reason why there is the rose bowl that I go to every fucking year, uh, is because of the Yale Bowl. And we went there and I got to tell you, we saw what sports look like without the use of any sort of steroids.

Speaker 1:          00:07:15       Versie was fucking hilarious. He was going to bill. I'm not even joking.

Speaker 1:          00:07:20       I feel that if I went to this school and I played for Yale, like I could not only make the football team, I could like dominate, like I could stand out and I understood why he felt that way. I'm not saying he's right, but to sit in the stands and for the first time in my life be watching college football and seeing people that are kind of the same size as you, I know the way fucking faster and all that type of thing. But um, it was unbelievable. Yale versus Harvard. Harvard kicked the shit out of him and uh, I got tell you like it was, it was really cool just being around that many smart people, just like some 20 year old fat kid walking through the crowd wearing like a bow tie, like not like a clip on like you tight yourself. Like he knows how to do it. It's just immediately, it's like how fucking smart is that guy? Like who knows how, who fucking knows how to do that?

Speaker 1:          00:08:17       I'll take two. Smart people in plantation owners are the only ones who know how to do that fucking bow tie. Right? And then there was some really good looking women there and they will, they will, you know, that was just, that's a really turn on to seek women that good looking, you know, I mean, they're actually going to Harvard. They just not walking around being hot, getting free shit. They're actually doing something with your life. That's really a turnoff. Can imagine banging a girl like that. Just being on top of it. Like, Oh God, she's so smart.

Speaker 4:          00:08:46       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:08:47       Ah, she has all the answers. Um, I know this is ridiculous. So the Yale Bowl, everybody, in case you're wondering, the Yale Bowl is a football stadium in gun wave in new haven, Connecticut. I'm on the border of West Haven, Yadda, Yadda, Yadda, Yadda. It was constructed in broke ground in 1913. All right, cost them 750 grand, 17.5 million in today's dollars. Uh, that was the hundred 30th meeting between Yale and Harvard. And I was just sitting there thinking like George Bush. George W used to get fucking shit faced back when he was still a good shit drinking, you know, he used to get hammered here. Hilary fucking Blue Bill Clinton under the bleaches,

Speaker 3:          00:09:33       right?

Speaker 1:          00:09:35       Those, those two families, they're the worst. I don't mind his dad, but fucking Georgie Jr and the Clintons, they're just the fucking worst. But anyways, um, basically ground was broken in 1913

Speaker 1:          00:09:49       and it was the first bowl shaped stadium in the country in provided inspiration for the design, the design of such stadiums as the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum, the Rose Bowl and Michigan stadium. This was the one that started at all. This is the daddy to the granddaddy of them all. All right. This is Zeus to all the Athenas and Mercurys and all that shit. Did I jump between Greek and Roman gods? I don't give a fuck. All right, you God damn egg head. Once you go tie a bow tie again today, nobody gives a fuck. Um, so we went there and through first he was so fucking fun. First of all, he killed on the show. And then we was staying at this hotel and before the show, uh, we were hanging and, uh, in my hotel room, you will watch an Lsu play in, uh, the Aggies. And I was great to see Lsu went, you know, all the disappointing losses this year. And uh, when you looked out the window, you could see Yale's campus and I was joking with Paul and I was going, look at it, Paul. I go, it's so close. And then I pointed to my brain and I'm like, yet so far away and I'm laughing. And in first he's such like a fucking competitive

Speaker 1:          00:10:58       psycho. He says, going to fuck that to fuck these fucking people. You, he's like, you think we couldn't get in to the school? I'm like, yeah, yeah, I don't think we didn't Paul. You know, you're going to go into fantasy land. What happened is we both went to high school and we tried and we didn't get in. So yeah, there's that. This isn't even like a debate at this point. We didn't. And now we're coming back here like a couple of fucking dance and monkeys to entertain these people.

Speaker 3:          00:11:29       All right.

Speaker 1:          00:11:31       And he, he wouldn't, he wouldn't leave it alone. He just kept going like, dude, fuck that. If I had a better upbringing, you know, if I had like people who like made me focus on academics and if I be gap, Paul. Yeah. If you're not the result of, of Morons fucking right. That's too harsh. Um, I feel like I'm the same way. All right. Jesus Christ. So just attacked his parents. That's that. You know, that's the last thing I want to do on this podcast. But first he's sitting there. He was, what was not joking saying that he could be, he could make it, he could've went to Yale. And that's why I love that guy is I just sit there and look at go, there's no fucking way he's, yeah, we could do it. There's no fucking forsee if you're listening to this, there is no fucking way.

Speaker 1:          00:12:23       If your parents made you read books every God, like there's no fucker. We've said enough dumb shit to me. The foundation of you. It's just not there. The same as me, Paul. Okay. It's, it's built on. It's built on sand. Um, now had either one of our parents gone there and then we were part of a legacy or whatever the fuck they call it. We could go, I could go there. I could go to Yale the way George W went there. You know, get their, have that fucking look on my face. Just getting shit faced. Everybody loving me. He's a complete fuck up. He's, he has no business being here, but he got the, he bought the keg. Right. I'd be that guy. I don't fucking know. Either way. We went to the game and uh, it was great. It was really like a, it was sort of pure. There was nothing riding on the game. There's no reason to play football at Yale and Harvard other than you love playing football. And then also the fact that, you know, they're all really smart.

Speaker 1:          00:13:23       That was something really fascinating about it. Like that guy, look at that guy out there, he gets geometry and he just went over the middle and took that hit. That's just fucking amazing to me. Just multitalented so I've got all kinds of respect. I've got to tell you, I think Harvard was on the juice. So BECU or they have some sort of, I dunno, lock on draft picks because they see, they've seem to be a definite, a sizable difference between the athletes on Harvard side versus a Yale. And I didn't no to root for. I liked the ales colors spot. Harvard's for math that [inaudible]. All right, I'm done with this shit. I'm all right back to the fucking podcast. So, oh, I have an announcement to make everybody after threatening forever that there would be podcast tee shirts, ladies and Gentlemen, Gentlemen, gentlemen, boys and girls of all sizes, sizes, sizes, the podcast t shirts are here, t shirt and fo.

And I was doing great and it came up the 18th fucking fairway and I shanked it the goddamn woods. All right. Back to the podcast here. All right. Very uneventful week. I feel everybody. So, uh, considering there's not a lot going on in the world of politics, what should we talk about? Oh, I don't know. Hey, let's talk about sports. Anybody Watch any sports this weekend where you're, where you're, where you're watching things that involve sports.

Speaker 1:          00:22:48       Was there sports watching? Um, all right. First things first I have to address the, uh, the no call pass interference thing last week and the panthers game, um, that was obviously a Monday night game, so I didn't comment on it. I didn't have a problem with it. I thought it was a good no call. I didn't like that they threw the flag and then picked it up. But how's Gronk going to make it fucking play on a pass? It's not even going to get to them. It's not like the guy who interfered with them or held them, caught the ball. It was another guy who undercut the route and I just feel like the rules in the NFL right now, our tips so heavily in favor of the authentic, it's nice every once in a while to see the defense get a break, even if it goes against my fucking team. Okay. Classic examples. If you watched the giants cowboys game early in that game, I think the cowboys were up seven enough and at that point,

Speaker 4:          00:23:46       okay,

Speaker 1:          00:23:46       they forced a fumble. They recovered it in a way from the play. There was a flag with a cornerback barely grazed this wide receiver and a negated. The cowboys, you know, turnover. The defense made a play cost to turnover. Once again, made a play cause to fucking turnover. It's in this, this new,

Speaker 4:          00:24:08       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:24:09       The new rules. I mean I can't complain. They are, the rules negates that and in stops them from having a short field and possibly going up 14 to nothing or 21 nothing. I can't remember what. So I did not have a problem with it. Good for the panthers and I actually tweeted that I didn't have a problem with it and all got all these fucking condescending. Yeah. Like responses to it like oh it's good to see a levelheaded patriots fan. It's good to see an impartial patriots fan. It's good to see a smart patriots fan. What? Cause I fucking agree with you and your team. You Selfish Asshole,

Speaker 1:          00:24:45       you know right there. That's when you know, like you don't have a true friend is when they just like you because you agree with them. And I would, I am, I would be willing to bet a most of my fucking whatever my shillings here that those people who compliment me or not impartial and had the call gone. If the exact same fucking thing happened to their, uh, their receiver and they lost the game, they would be bitch moaning and complaining and saying how Tom Brady runs the league and all that fucking shit. All right. So before you sit there and try and pat me on the head and say that I am impartial and I'm a smart Patriots Fan, that's not a fucking compliment. All right? You're a cunt. All right? As long as I agree with you and your team and I don't agree with my team in it causes you to have a victory, then, then I'm smart. Go Fuck Yourself. Um, and with that, we get to a, yesterday, yesterday's games, the New York football giants lost. And I know a lot of people think that I hate the giants because, uh, they beat the Patriots two times in a row in bowls. I don't, not only do I not hate the giants, I love the giants. I love that organization. I've liked them for fucking ever all the way back to Harry Cas and Brad van pelt, Beasley Reese. I've been watching them forever. I've always liked the giants. I like the uniforms. I like the, the defenses. I just liked to,

Speaker 4:          00:26:10       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:26:11       There's nothing better than haven't like doing, they had Lawrence Taylor and Harry Carson and you know, I was like Wilbur Marshall. I was always like big linebacker. Like I'd like the bears. I like defenses and that type of thing. So I don't hate the giants. What I hate is listening to Paul Versey talking about how he called something because he doesn't just say it for that weekend, he'll say it for the next seven years. So the reason why I wanted to see the giants lose is because I don't want to listen to versus talking to me. Like he's Nostradamus if that's how you pronounce that guy's name. Um, so that's all. And what kills me too is that division is so bad that they're still, they're still not out of it. There are only two games out of first place, three from going all the way up front, which should be insurmountable after 10 fucking games. But with that division, it isn't. It isn't. All right. I don't know who shot. I don't know. He's not waiting on what are the, are they for, are they foreign? Seven. Oh, so it's 11 games. Oh yeah. That pretty much fucked. Um, but I was, I got to tell you the back of my head, I was kind of hoping that they were going to make it into the playoffs because playoffs, because I have a feeling just the way the giants are. They, they would beat

Speaker 1:          00:27:31       Seattle in Seattle and another bunch of people would probably think that I hate the Seattle Seahawks because I did that whole, you know, the, we are the loudest song and I always make fun of Pete Carroll. I don't hate him. I don't give a fuck about the Seahawks one way or the other. I think the loudest crowd thing is silly and it's something that you focus on when you don't have any championship banners to look at. And I stand by that, but that doesn't mean I want you to lose. But Pete Carroll, it's just funny watching that guy loose, you know, watching a guy who goes, oh

Speaker 4:          00:28:06       woo,

Speaker 1:          00:28:08       something good happens. And he's totally proved himself as a coach. She's a great fucking coach. He's a great college coach. He knows how to build up the program illegally and right before the, the all the shit hits the fan to walk away from it. And I don't begrudge them for doing that because that's how the game's played. The same way I don't begrudge lance for, for doing what the fuck he did when everyone else was doing it. I don't regret any of that. And everybody who gives the Patriot shit for the spygate thing is living in this fantasy fucking land that your teams do not cheat. I'm reading this great book right now on, uh, uh, I don't have the title of it. I'll get it for you next week. Lie had gave me the book, uh, somewhat the last headbangers or something like that. It's like basically back when you just played with concussions and that type of shit, the level of cheating that was going on.

Speaker 1:          00:28:57       First of all, they didn't even test for steroids I think until like 1988 and football. And if you read about the Oakland Raiders, who still to this day bitch about the fucking tuck rule, um, does shit they were doing in the 70s. Do Dino, like they used to have like their pads, they used to soak them in water because it would make them hard and it was almost like having like a cast on and they would just club people in the head and other teams knew that they were doing it. So during the pregames and the warm ups, they would wear the soft ones and they'd have their hard ones under the bench. And it wasn't nine Zillion fucking TV cameras and people in the crowd all having TV cameras with this smart phones. So when the game started, they would put the other pads on and they would just clock people fucking head.

Speaker 1:          00:29:43       These guys were claiming they were taking horse tranquilizers and they were doing the dosage for a fucking 1500, 1200 pound fucking horse. Um, they were out of their minds, hopped up on everything in the plant. So people have cheated all day long. And the greatest thing about cheating is watching people who don't cheat, discover that there's cheating and to just watch them as adults, once again discovered that there's no Santa Claus and seeing their bottom lip quiver. I just, for the life of me, the reason why it's funny, it's not cause I can don't cheating, it's just that I just don't, I don't fucking get,

Speaker 1:          00:30:20       I like how many times you've got to get fucked over to realize that how human beings are, you know, I'm a piece of shit, right? Why wouldn't a football team where there's a zillion dollars at stake and, and your legacy and your, your, your spot in the all time list. I'm not saying everybody's going to cheat, but I just get this fucking shot. Look off your face. Like when Oj got acquitted, oh my God. That millionaire, the guy who had the money enough to be innocent gets declared in this. Yes. All right. Am I fucking, I might like preaching right now. I should shut the fuck up. Oh, and then also, what was I gonna say? Uh, how unreal was that? But that Patriots Broncos game, I guess it's unreal if you're on the fuck at winning side or if he didn't give a shit who won or not. Um, unreal. I watched that game flying. I was on Virgin Airlines, who by the way, they have this five minute music video for is great is that airline is when you get on that plane, rather than have them announce like this is how he put on a seatbelt and the mask, which usually takes live human beings like a minute, they made like a five minute video

Speaker 1:          00:31:37       that tries to have all the like people dancing and singing and then auto tuned voices. And I gotta tell you, it is one of the most horrific things I've ever heard and it's played at such a volume. I had my fingers in my ears and I was humming and I could still hear it. I heard it on the way out and the weight on the way back, I just gave into it and I just watched it. And um, I don't, you don't, you don't really annoys the shit out of me is people who dance with an attitude. Look on their face like they think that they're fucking amazing like it. I'm not saying that I don't respect the art of dancing, but what is with that look on your face. You know like you're fucking Gronk. Koski and he just dragged fucking the entire secondary over the goal line. What are you doing? What? Cause you did a little Shim Sham. Huh? Cause you're shaking your left shoulder while your right toes doing something else. Like now you have this look on your face like line up across

Speaker 3:          00:32:40       in your reading the defense. What is the, what is with that fucking look people have on their faces when they dance night, I think did Fred Astaire had that look on his face?

Speaker 1:          00:32:51       When you're dancing there's only one look you should have on your face and it should convey roughly. Ooh. All right. Stop looking at me like you're going to take my wallet.

Speaker 3:          00:33:03       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:33:03       I th I just don't fucking under. So it's five minutes of that combined with like auto tune and that fucking robot dancing that I, I just don't with this fucking look of attitude. And then rapping, they got some little girl fucking rapping, like sounded like dice when he makes fun of women.

Speaker 3:          00:33:27       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:33:28       About how to put a seatbelt on and it goes on for like five minutes as you sit underneath these aquarium, TJ's lights.

Speaker 3:          00:33:36       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:33:37       The same ones that they have at the w hotel. Um,

Speaker 1:          00:33:42       other than that it's great because you get to just sit there and watch TV. So anyways, when I got through the whole fucking a put on your seat, that's it. Rock, whatever the fuck they was singing. Oh, just wasn't fucking end. So, um, I actually, I was watching the Patriot, I watch all the giants game and then I want went into the winter to the Patriots game right before we were about to make a 24, 21 got off the plane and somehow it was already 24, 21. And I went by the bar and I score, saw a score to make it 28, 24, sorry, 24, 21 and then 28, 24. And um,

Speaker 3:          00:34:25       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:34:26       It was in state and then the whole way back from the airport versus he was texting me the updates. And right as I got home, I saw the replay of the, uh, of the punt with a guy inadvertently touched it because he didn't hear Welker tell him to get out of the way. But uh, what a fucking game. And um, yet another reason why you don't leave early, but I don't think that that was a definitive example of what Brady and Manny can do. Cause I thought the elements played such a fucking role in the game. But I will say this Brady is 10 and four and 14. Matchups against Peyton manning. So I am done with that argument. All right. If you want manning, go ahead. You can, you can have them. I will take Brady any day, all day. You know, Brady doesn't even have that look on his face. Neither this Peyton manning that these fucking dancers have. Is it trying to tell me how to put on a fucking seat belt?

Speaker 1:          00:35:27       Did people who liked dance too, they just get sick of getting beat up. So now they feel like they have to take it on and now they have to have a game face. Um, I was just watching it like, when did Kevin Garnett start dancing? I don't understand. Oh, that's not Kevin Garnett. That's just somebody dancing. Um, I'm so exhausted from watching that whole fucking game and traveling around. I don't know what to say. I'm not going to try to rub anybody's nose in anything. It was at the end of the day, an unbelievable win and just a regular season fucking victory. And, uh, but it was, um, it definitely, if you watched that game and you still leave games earlier, you're not a sport. You leave the game early and not a fucking sports fan. I just was watching people, Clara, I understood because it was fucking freezing and you're down 24.

Speaker 1:          00:36:21       Nothing. I understand if you're down 24, nothing at the half and it's fucking like absolutely freezing, disgusting. And you with your little boy or your girl and they're cold, they want to go back to the car. I get that. All right? But if you're a, and you're standing there in the fucking stands for the love of God, all right? If the offensive lineman can be out there and short sleeve shirts, you know, you can't tough it out and you mighty Mac with your fucking mittens and they leave or they watched one of the historical comebacks in New England sports title town. It's just an unbelievable run. Every time you think you've seen the last great thing that's going to happen and then it's going to go back to the way it was, another great thing happened. So I feel very blessed as a sports fan so far.

Speaker 1:          00:37:10       They go, they go, great fucking game. And this is the thing too. I don't think as much as that was a big wind, that doesn't mean shit when the playoffs come. Cause we're going to have to go into Denver and at the end of the day to use that overly used expression, Denver could come back and beat us in January and then who gives a fuck that we beat them in in November despite the fact that it was unbelievable victory. Um, I mean, shit that happened with the jets. We absolutely raped the jets and December and then a month later we lost to them at home. So who gives a fuck? Um, they're both great quarterbacks and the both great teams and who gives a fuck? It was an amazing God damn game. I can't believe he came back and won it. And A, I'm done arguing the Brady manning thing.

Speaker 1:          00:37:55       I think the numbers speak for themselves as far as the way I look at the numbers. And, uh, I think they both played each other enough times with all different kinds of teams. Loaded teams, patched together. Teams like our fucking defense last night. I'm so fucking sick of them two talking about how many injuries we have on defense and then they go and like, they absolutely just, just ran right through the guts of that Patriots' defense. It's like, Oh yeah, the one word yet where the guts were already ripped out. There's no guts left in it. Well, there are, cause we won the game. I'm not saying that people are out there, but do we start started four rookies yesterday. I it just, you got to have a guy as good as fucking no, Sean running the ball. Yeah, he's going to rack up some fucking yards, although over 200 is an excusable. So whatever. All right, let's uh, let's get on to the, uh, the questions this week. See, I think I handled that really well. Help you. I don't rub your fucking noses in it unless you jets fans. Um, all right. Response to last podcast or Yankee fence,

Speaker 1:          00:39:04       respond to the last podcast. Uh, this is in response to the item mentioned on your last podcast, the brother that had the 16 year old sister who was dating a 22 year old. Okay? All capital letters. This guy writes, the brother needs to stay out of it. All right? So for those of you who didn't listen last week, there was a guy who is 16 year old sister was dating this 22 year old dude and he was questioning, do I knock this guy the fuck out? Do I say something to my sister? Do I somehow get my parents to wake the fuck up? What do I do? All right, I gave my advice in. This guy is saying this, he seems like he's speaking from experience or this woman, whoever wrote this, the brother needs to stay out of it. I met with a lady, I met my now husband when I was 15 and he was 20. Well, you little fast tramp. You couldn't even drive a car. How did you even meet a 20 year old, Huh? Oh, you standing on the street corner?

Speaker 3:          00:40:06       Eh?

Speaker 1:          00:40:11       I'm sure you're a nice person. Sorry. Um, you were 15 and he was 20.

Speaker 1:          00:40:24       Did your plane crashed? And he was stuck on an island and it was like that blue lagoon or some shit. He said we started dating just after I turned 16 and we got married when I was 20 and he was 25 we have now been happily married almost 25 years. Oh, that's a nice story. It may not work out this way for this guy's sister, but it also might work out to and ended up being a stronger relationship than any relationship this guy might have. It's none of the brothers business stay out of it. Okay.

Speaker 3:          00:40:57       Hmm.

Speaker 1:          00:40:58       Miss, I respect your point of view and what happened to you. All right. Well let me ask you this.

Speaker 3:          00:41:05       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:41:06       If you have a daughter and she turns 16 and some 22 year old guy starts sniffing around the house, are you going to just sit there and be like, well, my husband was 20 and I was 15 you know, I gotta be honest with you. The difference between 20 and 15, a 15 year old is a fucking, I can't quite say a child, but there was a massive age difference. Forget about the legality of it. And most states other than Mississippi, I'm sorry, I'm fucking with you guys. Um, 22 to 16. I mean, you're talking about somebody who's in the middle of high school dating somebody who's graduated college. Ah, that, I dunno. I Dunno about that. All right, I look, can you at least understand why this guy, is that upset and have you ever watched to catch a predator? I mean that there's not like, there's not like evidently a zillion fucking creeps out there. How many seasons have to catch a predator? They did. They do. I mean, you would think like the amount of people out there that are going online trying to meet underage women. You wouldn't think that. I mean, I would like to thank

Speaker 1:          00:42:31       that there's maybe 40 people doing that, but there isn't. There's a bunch, hundreds of thousands of fucking creeps out there doing that shit. So this guy is supposed to stay out of it and roll the dice that maybe this guy is a good guy like your husband. Well, all I can say is I hope that you're right. You've had, fortunately you've had more this in this than I have because I would not want to have experience in any shape or form in this and I don't think my family would, um, stay out of it. There would be major fucking problems.

Speaker 1:          00:43:12       There'll be major fucking problems. There would be. It's like, Dude, you're 22. What the fuck is wrong with you? How did you even meet my sister? You know, how are you, how are you meeting 16 year olds? You fucking creep. I, you know what? Maybe I'm ignorant here. Why don't you write back again? I want to hear the story. How you guys met, you know, was he teaching you how to add and subtract? Sorry. The jokes are just too easy. All right. Thanksgiving Day special Billy Crocker. There's a new one. Betty Crocker. Billy Crocker. I liked that and I like to cook. Oh, that's a good one. Love your intensity when it comes to bringing something to the table on Thanksgiving. Absolutely. No Pun intended. It's, it's really a no brainer. Get good at making something and get to a point where your automatic oh, he's talking about, yeah, like I was talking about a few weeks ago, when Thanksgiving comes around, you got to have that dish that you just fucking can make and you throw down and you take it to another level.

Speaker 1:          00:44:14       All right? Everybody else should be doing the same thing. And then the end, that's the Thanksgiving meal. Um, so this guy goes, yeah, you should get a dish downs where your automatic. How hard can it be? A you'll, you'll never been x. You'll never been. You've never been expected to step out of your skillset. If you're baking breads, no one will ever expect you to bring the cranberry sauce. Uh, what should go to this year? What's Nias specialty? What's my Goto this year? How about the whole fucking meal? Dude, I'll tell you right now. You guys stick. I'm a fucking a one trick pony. I can make you a Turkey dinner. Was stuffing mashed potatoes. My gravy game is getting better. I got to work on my gravy game and I know that's crucial. All right. But my fucking, ah, my mashed potatoes, not a fucking lumping them all right enough. Bato to make you slag off the chair. Um, as they say in New Orleans, that's bad. New Orleans accent. I admitted my stuffing. Go Fuck Yourself. All right dude. You know, you don't understand the recipes that I have access to all of my recipes. Start with melt a stick of butter and a third, a cup of Chris. Go in a pan.

Speaker 1:          00:45:32       Okay. So, you know, it's delicious. Um, yeah, my stuffing.

Speaker 4:          00:45:39       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:45:41       I don't my mashed potatoes or the shit, but knee is African American, so she likes more sweet potato. So I don't, I don't think they, uh, that side respects mashed potatoes the way they should. Okay. I feel like my potato, my, my, my United colors of Benetton, whatever the fuck it is. Respectful for sweet potatoes and mash potatoes, I think I'm a little more mature.

Speaker 4:          00:46:05       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:46:05       Then the lovely Nia. Um, what's Nice specialty, uh, Nias she's just great at everything. She's one of those people that I, I'll be out in the kitchen like, dude, what the fuck? I'm starving. But she'd be like, what do you [inaudible] she comes out there and like, she knows she's got a couple of things on her arms and I dunno, I'm eating spaghetti or I don't know what the fuck. I mean she somehow just throws it all together or make some ridiculous omelet.

Speaker 4:          00:46:31       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:46:32       Um, she's actually a true cook. I'm a little more robotic. Um, mmm.

Speaker 4:          00:46:37       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:46:38       I think I'm going to become a, uh, a great cook or a better cook. The way I became a better comedian where at first I was a joke writer and I was trapped in my act and then I learned how to Improv and she's kind of just watching her. She kinda as she cooked, she's tasting it and doing all that type of stuff where I just, they said to leave it at 58 minutes, it's been 15 minutes and I take it out. Um, pies, I kind of got the whole thing do from start to finish. My, uh, my appetizer game is terrible. In fact, I don't even know if I know how to make one. I have no idea, but do what? I can make a pie from fucking scratch. Okay?

Speaker 4:          00:47:15       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:47:16       I can look at you and tell you what all your fucking problems are as I'm making the pie crust and not even look down once I can just feel the texture. You know what I'm saying? That's how many fucking Pi's I've made. All right, and I'll take debt

Speaker 4:          00:47:30       pie someday and I'll bring it to your fucking house. All right, and I'll take a whole hunk of it just in, I'll just shove it. Write down your throat and these nothing that you're going to be able to say other than thank you for that experience. All right. As of shaking up the can of whipped cream to give you a facial. You know what's funny about this? My attitude like cooking is the same as like those dancers with this stupid fucking looks on their faces. Take that fucking look off the Goddamn. Unless you just dunked on somebody. Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:48:01       Unless you have a loaded fucking pistol pointed at my face. You take that fucking look off of your God Damn Grill. Is She a fucking moon walking across the stage? Like I'm in awe of you. I'm not saying it's not a, not a great skill to have, but what you're doing versus the look, the look on your face is so far down the fucking street compared to what the fuck you doin. What is that?

Speaker 4:          00:48:29       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:48:30       All the way back to those Janet Jackson videos. Hi Miss you much. And she'd have this fucking look in her face as she's putting her fingers in and she's hopping around. And it was amazing. Visually. It was amazing to look at. But why do you have that fucking look on your face?

Speaker 1:          00:48:48       Why are you all dressed in these army uniforms? Like you're fighting in a war? All right. Get back to the way it was. All right, everybody.

There'd be tell you guys so much. I love Yiddish words. I actually just looked up a bunch because I wanted to learn some more cause they're fucking hilarious and they're fun to say. And uh, I really liked Jewish humor, but uh, I actually looked up and it was like, I knew already knew 90% of them. There was so many that I was using and I didn't even realize, did I already talk about this or did I start to talk about I don't give a fuck the holiday week. You guys got a short week.

Speaker 1:          00:54:22       You get thrown in a burlap sack and beaten with a read like fucking a Dr Evil. What happened to you? Um, he said I got too much stuff going on with work to be thinking about a relationship. However, I'm enjoying this casual situation. She seems to be happy as well. Oh Jesus, dude, you're going to break her heart, man.

Speaker 3:          00:54:40       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:54:40       Women don't look at the Sh this shit the way we do. She seems happy as well because she's probably thinking it's going somewhere is what I'm guessing. And then one day can be like, yeah, you know, I'm not feeling it. And then she's going to start crying and it'd be like, what the fuck? I thought we were just fucking, and then she,

Speaker 5:          00:54:55       that's all you thought this.

Speaker 1:          00:55:01       Okay.

Speaker 5:          00:55:02       We went, oh, we got ice cream.

Speaker 1:          00:55:04       Do you know anyone? It's like, just pictures, Seinfeld crying. That's what you're going to hear. Um, however, I'm enjoying the casual situations. She seems to be happy as well. So what do I, what do I get her for Christmas? That doesn't make it look like I've made room for her toothbrush. Dude, you shouldn't get her anything for Christmas. Don't get her fucking thing for Christmas. Don't fuck her until after Christmas. Why are you filling up her heart with hope? Don't do this. I've done this. You're going to hurt her. He goes, I was thinking about some small things, a book and maybe a sweatshirt from this place on the beach that she likes. Oh well isn't that thoughtful to get her a pack of Fig Newtons, like share a package of those. Let her know where you stand. He said, ps, the last gift I bought a girl was a few years back. We've been dating for three years and she cheated on me. Oh, we had been dating for three years and she cheated on me. I found out over thanksgiving, and when it came time to give Christmas presents, I handed her a frame with a poem. The first part of the poem was super sweet. She was getting emotional. Then she got to the last line, which red after these words, your heart's feel heated, but stead, I'm going to piece because bitch, you cheated.

Speaker 1:          00:56:30       Holy Shit. Wait a minute. Is that a true story? I don't even care if you made it up. You have to write back. I want to hear what happened. What the fuck did she say? Jesus Christ, Dude. That's like,

Speaker 4:          00:56:48       yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:56:48       I'd expect like, oh, that's like,

Speaker 4:          00:56:51       okay,

Speaker 1:          00:56:52       that's really deep, man. That's really clever. That's really intelligent. That's a kind of thing a woman would do. You know? We're usually just knees and elbows, like what? You know, just start screaming at them because thing, you know, you were in a full Nelson by some other fucking jerk off dragging you away and you're in the right. That's really, uh, that's really amazing. Um, I would, I would say I would say this, uh, oh wait, this is my podcast person texting me right now, trying to call me right now and he's getting on a plane. So that's why this podcast is late. All right? And also I had to do this radio. Took a fuck yourselves, right? It's the holiday week. Come sit in here. My slippers. What are your thoughts? Um, my thoughts are as you're, you're really going to hurt this woman cause I feel like you haven't had a conversation with her. You said, you said, however, I'm enjoying this casual situation and you said she seems to be happy as well. So that indicates to me that you guys haven't talked, sat down and talk this out. And I can guarantee you if this woman is any of that with thing, like the women that I've dated, it's already too late.

Speaker 1:          00:58:06       All right. Um, she might be happy thinking like, Oh wow, he's taking it slow. He's really getting to know me. You know, he got me a sweatshirt from this place on the beach that I like. He's paying attention to me. He is noticing things about me. You know what it is do you are actually, you're actually a relationship guy, but this other woman ruined you and you got to get that hate out of your heart or the defensiveness audio heart before you should be messing around with somebody like that. Right. Right. Now what you should be doing? It's just going out and just, I dunno, working on yourself while

Speaker 4:          00:58:49       yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:58:49       Fucking everything that moves or, or maybe not.

Speaker 4:          00:58:52       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:58:53       It shouldn't be going like don't hurt this. I don't know what's going on. Cause this is still very vague, but don't hurt this woman because that last one, her, yeah, I've made that mistake. It's a bad, it's bad dude. And I, and I know I'm not judging you for being in that situation because you're a guy and you shouldn't understand them. But now that I understand them a little bit more, uh, you know, um, you're headed for a fucking, if I had to guess you're headed for a rough or shortly after Christmas, you know when she goes, you want to meet my parents that I could wear this sweatshirt that you got me from the place in the beach that you like, you know, and she'll bring that up right after she just blew you and your Saturn and you'd be like, yea no, I was going to watch the holiday bowl instead with some buddies of mine get to watch the outback steakhouse. Steak House fucking bull.

Speaker 4:          00:59:44       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:59:45       And then she'd be like, well, wait a minute. Why? Why? Oh, I, I don't understand. And then he'd be like, and then you're going to be starting to sense like, well, what do you mean? You understand? I just invited you to meet my parents and you're like, you don't want to meet them.

Speaker 4:          01:00:02       Huh?

Speaker 1:          01:00:04       I a little, a little offended. I mean, these, these are, these are my parents. I sounds kind of awesome. Joe Starts hanging down. He in understand what she's saying. I said, Ha, okay. And you're like, and then she starts crying. And then if you're like, most guys should get mad because you're uncomfortable. All you got to fucking cried out.

Speaker 5:          01:00:28       Say something. Oh yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:00:37       Fucking rolls into a snow drift. I'm telling you, dude, you, you don't, you don't want to go down this road. I, I got a bad feeling.

Speaker 4:          01:00:44       Okay,

Speaker 1:          01:00:45       I've got a bad feeling about this one man. Um, just make sure that she's enjoying this the same way you are, dude. Who wouldn't like to be with the super cool girl that you don't have to fucking be emotionally involved with WHO's coming over and banging you? Now let me tell you something, dude, this is not 100% on you, so don't feel guilty because she also hasn't sat down and had the conversation.

Speaker 5:          01:01:07       Okay?

Speaker 1:          01:01:07       Maybe she has her baggage. Maybe she sat down and said that to some other guy and it scared her away. She said, okay, now to south, did I bring up, hey is this guy said [inaudible] have a lot of data. Um, coffee shop girl, dear illiterate cunt. I'm not illiterate. I just not good at reading out loud. It doesn't make me a literate. I can still read the words.

Speaker 4:          01:01:35       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:01:35       Did that, did that just sound like somebody illiterates I'm smart. Fredo all right. I'm a young guy. Oh my God. Some 21 year old kid just called me an illiterate cunt.

Speaker 1:          01:01:47       And you know what? I got to take that on the chin. I got to sit here at my locker at the end of the reading game. I take full responsibility for that loss. I've got no one to blame, but myself, I'm a young guy, 21 and I have kind of, and I kind of have a thing for a chick who works at my local coffee shop. Please tell me she's not 16. I don't want to read another one of these. Uh, the idea of chatting her up while she's working always seems weird to me, mainly because I know she has to listen. Just give me some quick tips so I don't come off as a Weirdo. Love the, and thanks dude. Are you fucking kidding me? This is the perfect situation.

Speaker 1:          01:02:25       All right. Oh, she works at the local coffee shop. Oh, I thought you worked with her. Fuck, that's the perfect, that's the perfect situation. If you work with somebody that you're into as far as you know, being able to talk to him, it's not weird at all. And uh, you can make them laugh and that type of thing, then they get into you. But then the bad thing is, is then you start fucking somebody you're working with and you've got a pretty good chance that you're not gonna make the playoffs with that one, you know? And you're going to have to rebuilt and it's going to be ugly and you're going to lose your fan base. And the fan base will be other chicks that worked that you probably should have been fucking instead of that whore. But anyways. All right, so you're walking into this coffee shop and there's a girl there working there that you like and you don't want to start because it's going to seem weird. All right. Well, what's weird about that is to try to do it in line is you're really dealing with a, a,

Speaker 1:          01:03:22       a short period. It's like a vine. You're going to try to hit on her in the span that it takes to sh to watch a vine. You liked that, you liked that reference. Trying to be hip to the DUBSTEP fucking generation is dub step already over. Have you moved onto something else or Shabbat for, for um, that fucking look on your goddamn face. Alright, I could break you in half like a pencil. Will you stop looking at me like you can kick the shit out of me while you're dancing? Maybe that's what it is. Maybe that's just the funny stuff. Just something funny about it. Attitude, dancing. Um, can you guys send me some clips to some of the funniest attitude dancer you can find? So maybe put some together right? They go, you know what I love is when you guys take clips from my podcast and then you play the audio underneath like some of the, the, uh, the animation that people have done is, it's fucking so creative like that one.

Speaker 1:          01:04:20       When that guy did the one for, and I sang that song, do you know what it means to Miss New Orleans? That's where my baby goes. And the guy did the whole animation of it and I was talking about somebody throwing up and when the word throw up came in, it looked like it was launched out of somebody's mouth, like at Arctic [inaudible] really creative. So how bout uh, as I'm talking about these people dancing, just have, just put, come on you guys. All you fucking youngsters, you know how to use computers. Just split the audio underneath and just have that kind of dancing over the top. Like that's the video. I don't know how to say technically. Anyways, let's get back to this thing. So he, all right. First thing you gotta do is a I would you got to drink your coffee there. Does she come around?

Speaker 4:          01:05:10       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:05:11       This is so hard. How do I give you advice? All I can give you, I can't tell you what to say because I never know what to say until I'm there in the moment and something pops in unless she's really good looking. And then I, at that age I would just get fucking intimidating. It'd be like, how's just going to sit here? And you see he might bran muffin. Um, when would you do, I don't know if, do you got something coming up but you can invite it to, this is what I would do. I would come there frequently enough that she starts to recognize you. All right. And then ease your way into kind of no one or I guess I would do that. And then you have something if you've got a fucking, whatever you kids do nowadays.

Speaker 4:          01:05:47       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:05:47       You know, if there's a big ecstasy shipment coming to town and you're going to meet the truck there with the glow sticks and he got an extra pair of glow sticks that you could hand to her. Uh,

Speaker 4:          01:05:57       yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:05:58       Maybe you could do that something where I'm just flailing here. Don't, don't fucking ask me coffee. Shot of what it did. I never picked up any girl that worked at a fucking coffee shop. I was good on the subway in New York.

Speaker 1:          01:06:12       But that was because they would always be some weirdo doing something weird and then you could just lock in with the other person, you know, like look at this fucking maniac and then you could make something, say something funny about that. You'd make them laugh and then you were in that the gym coffee shops, that's out of my wheelhouse. So I would just say go there enough where she starts to recognize you try to extend the conversation each time you order and then blah blah blah. But, but the thing is you can't keep coming in there cause you really going to look like a creep. So I would say within three visits, give yourself three visits.

Speaker 4:          01:06:46       Yeah,

Speaker 1:          01:06:47       on the third visit you just got to fucking asker. You know, if she's seen anybody and it have something to invite her to, that's going to be a fun thing. Don't just be like, oh he's willing to take y'all show time. And maybe I could pull it out and you could just look at it. You don't have to touch it. Don't do it like that. Have something to too.

Speaker 4:          01:07:04       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:07:04       An event, ladies like the events and I don't know what they're into what your age, but um, I dunno the first time it's too weird. You got to have unreal game that I don't have, so I can't fucking give you advice. Second time she's getting to know you and the third time you go for it, right. Swing for the fucking fence. Just say, look, Cutie Pie. I don't work here. All right. So I know this is well, what am I supposed to do? I'm attracted to you. All right. Fuck Sakes. Put Down the God damn coffee and, and come to me to, to the, to the burning man thing. I got plenty of Sunscreen and ecstasy and uh, you know,

Speaker 1:          01:07:50       and it's not a sex thing. I mean, I would hope it would eventually turn into it, but more in like a lovingly thing, like the kind of thing where I wouldn't tell my friends what we did because I care for you kind of thing. You know, maybe we lay in the dirt and roll around next to that thing that's on fire. Right? I have no coffee shop game. Hey, anybody out there of coffee shop game? I don't drink coffee. That's the thing. All right, it's fucking gross. It tastes like dirty water and it burns my mouth so I don't fuck with it. And that just takes all that coffee shop pussy right out the fucking window. They always just seem like the coffee shop people to me always seemed like hipsters, like they just were over everything, you know? So if you're over everything, you're over everything.

Speaker 1:          01:08:40       The fucking Grand Canyon, you're over that. My dumb ass is coming in there with the, you're not going to be over that lack of pigment a. All right. The mall. Billie holiday. Very nice. I am going on all a day. I'm going to Italy. I'm going to miss thanksgiving. Um, what's your plan of attack when you enter a mall? Are you on a mission or are you a window shopper? Do you have a favorite gift you've ever been given and what's your go to Mall Food Panda Express. Taco Bell's sparrow pizza. It's spiraled. Pizza sucks. It always looks good, I'll tell you. But it really fills you up. I usually go with the chicken parm or shown and that, that one a little scary. Then I get on the plane and they start farting into that fucking flotation device beneath me. Or perhaps a fancy sandwich from Obam Paul. They don't have, there's nothing fancy about that other than the fucking name.

Speaker 1:          01:09:36       Um, all bond pan. If you're still living in the 90s, always making fun of the place. Thanks and gobble, gobble, go fuck yourself. All right. My plan of attack. When I enter a mall, I only go to a mall when I need something, that's it. And I know what I want and I know where it is and I go in there and when it's not there, I'm like, oh, what the fuck? And then I leave. Um, I do not window shop at malls. I hate malls. It's just all those fucking people and it, it just makes me, they're just depressing. When I was younger, it was great. You walked around, there was all these fucking, I was like, what you did? You go to the mall and then you ran into girls that you were in your grade and they'd be like, hi, Bill. And I'd be like, hi. And I'd walk away my face all red. And then it was like, Whoa, why didn't I say thought that I hate myself? And then I went, when? Then where would I sit down and eat? Um, I don't like Panda Express. Uh, Taco Bell, no fast food. Mexican food. Why don't you just play Russian roulette? That's Taco bell is Russian roulette for your ass. I'm spiral pizzas. Same fucking thing. Where would, where would I go?

Speaker 1:          01:10:58       Well, if I had to choose smaller as I go to, I'd go to sparrow. Um, that's usually some barbecue thing. I Dunno. You know what I hate is when they had, they'd have that little sweet and sour chicken on the toothpicks and then that overly smiling Asian women would come over and ask you if you wanted one.

Speaker 4:          01:11:18       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:11:19       It's just like, didn't you like poison the toys? I don't want to eat that. Right. How Archie bunker was that I just don't like, I just fucking creeps me out. That you're walking around with food. Like where, where was that? Where did you get that?

Speaker 1:          01:11:35       You know, you're on this side of the counter, like on that side. I already know there's enough health code violations at sparrow pizza, Taco Bell and Panda Express. Enough rat turds in that shit that, you know, I should run out of here right now. But now you're on this side where people are sneezing. You're on this side of the sneeze glass walking around with that shit. You don't even have a covered stuck with a little fucking toothpick. And then you've got that other thing over there where people stick their use toothpicks. Well, you get that fucking glazed chicken out of my face. This smiley be it. Um,

Speaker 4:          01:12:06       yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:12:07       Yeah. I'm too old to eat at those places. When I was younger aid at Mickey D's, Oh, ate McDonald's hose and Mcdonald's guy a Kentucky fried chicken cold. I can never eat it hot. That grease when it's hot, it makes me sick to my stomach. When it's cold, it's fucking ecstasy. And I would melt into the rug, into the rug like I was on in train spotting. Um, I'd like friendlies back in the day, get myself a nice burger, melt in a fucking Jim Dandy, nice. 3000 calories to the fucking hat. And then I walk out of there and go play Frisbee football because that's what you did back then with my fucking white sox yanked up to underneath, underneath my Patella. Um, Ken Patella. All right. That's the podcast for this week. People, I don't know what to tell you. All right. I hope you guys have a wonderful thanksgiving. My European tour is about to start. I'm going over to Italy and speaking of going to like the first bowl ever, I'm going to go to the coliseum. So if you're in Italy and you're going to be over there, look for me in the coliseum.
