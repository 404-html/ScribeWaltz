Speaker 1:          00:00:01       Hey, what's going on? It's bill burn. It's time for the Monday morning podcast for Monday, September 11th, 2017 what's going on? How are Ya? How's it going? How's it going? Um, more hurricanes, more hurricanes. And this is the 70th anniversary of the attacks on the World Trade Center.

Speaker 2:          00:00:20       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:00:21       The Pentagon and then the one that went down to Pennsylvania, you know, I mean, Jesus Christ, what is going on this week? It's just all gloom and frigging do you know, I was sitting there watching the news, the news with Nia, right? And they're showing highlights of this. Um, was it hurricane Irma is what it is. Jim or safe was coming into fucking Miami. Right? And there's some fucking white dude out there of course being like, well, you know, it's no come down real hard. They show like five white people out there. And Nia literally said to me, she goes, what is wrong with white people?

Speaker 3:          00:00:58       Okay,

Speaker 1:          00:00:59       Eh, the lab. I was like, you know, we, for the most part, we grew up in called the sex. There's no excitement. There's no drive. Bys is no, uh, you know, cops beat me up for no reason. Generally speaking, you know, it's gonna hey, knock it off over there. Straight up. I know your father. You know, it's Kinda like that. So I guess, you know, a hurricane comes around you where you need a story. Shit, you need a story. I have no idea why I came up with a hacky eighties joke though about fucking the hurricanes. It's, it's, it's, why don't they have all the people's Dan with a report? Because the report has never died. They're always standing in the fucking middle of the shit. I don't know how, I don't know how these news agencies know exactly where to fucking stand, but somehow they stand just enough in the shit. I don't buy it. I don't buy it. Um, she has one of them died yet,

Speaker 2:          00:01:52       you know,

Speaker 1:          00:01:53       out of fuck. I mean, how the fuck did that, you know, Jesus bells spit it out. Sorry. I flew today. Once I fall, I'm already dumb. But once I fly it just, you know, breathing that fucking pressurized air up there. Um, I mean, it's fucking inevitable. If you stand out inside in a fucking hurricane, someone's going to fall on top of it. It's bad enough. Like I love when they sit there and they tell these people, you need to evacuate. You got to get out of the, and it's like, and go where? To my summer home. Don't you remember the fucking bags left half this country upside down in their fucking house.

Speaker 1:          00:02:28       It's fucking unreal. I don't understand like where these people are supposed to go. Like where, where do they go? Everybody just goes north and sits in a fucking waffle house for three, four days. All the hotels get bought up. And if you don't have money, what do you, what? What are you supposed to do? Um, anyways, at least it was knocked down to a, to a category three men. I read some fucking, you know, it's some horrible shit about, uh, Houston that's still going on now is all mold and it's all in here. You know, you don't need to listen to this. You see it all fucking day. This is all just gloom and doom, all fucking misery here. So, um, why don't I go to something positive? I actually a friend of the podcast, one of the great traumas of all time, Steven Atla, uh, he sent me this thing.

Speaker 1:          00:03:13       He's got a, uh, they're doing something for Ronnie James Dio. Um, on October 6th, it's 6:30 PM bull for Ronnie Celebrity. Uh, Christ, my eyes are going celebrity bowling tournament. All right. Oh fuck. I'm not going to be able to read this. I can't. Okay, here we go. Oh. Gotta love that. You can enlarge. Wish I could do this to the world, man. I have to get glasses. Why won't I just give into the fact that I need glasses? All right. October six, 2017, 6:30 PM celebrity bowling tournament.

One, two, six five five Ventura Boulevard, studio city, California nine one six oh four go down there.

They go, I'll have put up a link. I'm going to post the whole a flyer on the Monday morning. Thingamajig there's another guy got the TV on there and I'm on my Twitter account. There's a guy standing out there, Jesus Christ standing out there in the fucking rain.

Speaker 1:          00:04:30       Like the video al Roker is out there.

Speaker 2:          00:04:33       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:04:34       How many hurricanes is that poor bastard stood down and now it's going up to Tampa and then it looks like it's going to go right over the Florida gators football stadium somehow die around fucking Macon, Georgia. And is that what they said? Is that the trajectory?

Speaker 1:          00:04:50       I don't know what. Um, anyways, um, so I was in a miss shippy flew into fucking miss share pay on Thursday night and I missed the entire New England patriots game. And from what I've heard as a patriots fan was probably better to just landed, find out that they got the shit kicked out of them. Really just kind of in the fourth quarter though. I mean, it was kind of a shootout with no fucking defense as far as I could tell. The chiefs are all excited doing fucking cartwheels cause they let up fucking 27 points. I don't know what they're so fucking excited about, but I will tell you as a patriots fan, I'm pretty fucking happy. Now I'm going to tell you why I want to tell you why, because I don't like the fucking worst thing ever is when before you even start the season, those fucking hacks on this sports shows go.

Speaker 1:          00:05:40       You know they talk about your team like they go right? They start doing that shit. So before the fucking season, our restarts, you already got that fucking monkey on your back. Every fucking fat Douche who never got picked in gym class coming in with his fucking loafers and his sweaters in India locker room, just trying to rip the team apart and just adding just distraction. So right out of the gate we fucking lose. All of that is gone. And then immediately they go, oh wait a minute, wait a minute. Remember when you say in Tom Brady is the after his last game was the greatest without a doubt of all time. Now with the exact same people one fucking game later saying he's too old. So I'm loving that. I'm loving all of that. What would you know, I would actually love if we lost next week too, but then they would have all this, you know what's cause a toddler hit the panic, blah blah blah.

Speaker 1:          00:06:38       You'd have to deal with that. So I'm hoping, you know they were in the next three, four they lose another one, four and two and then they're five just nobody's paying attention. No, they treat us like the Indianapolis Colts man when they were 13 and oh and nobody said Shit for whatever fucking reason, which is really a reoccurring thing with the Indianapolis Colts. No matter what they do. Hearing aids in the fucking helmets, fucking pumping crowd noise in tank and the final third of a season to get Andrew luck steel and the Patriots' offense fucking being on the rules committee, changing the rules of passing and on and on and fucking on. Right. Go on 13 and oh, nobody's saying shit. Oh they're just a bunch of country boys out there. We won't pay attention to them. I love it. I love that we, uh, I mean I hate our fucking defense, but I haven't liked our defense since we won our first three.

Speaker 1:          00:07:25       Um, I think ever since then we've always been like a, you know, well we're going to score, you already going to score 35, we're going to score 38. I always just, I just Kinda feel like we've been like that for too long. And occasionally we've broadened, we brought in a shutdown corner like a Revus um, oh they take whatever the fuck his name was who was here for like a year or two. He was fucking great. But then all of a sudden they're like, yeah, okay now I want to get paid. They like, yeah, Nah, Nah. So, um, anyways, yeah. So I just, I watched a little bit of the highlights. I mean when you give up an 85 yard touchdown in your corner, like fucking lets the guy go by him cause he thinks that he's got help over the top and the guy just isn't there. I mean, I really don't think that's the chiefs kicking our ass as much as that's

Speaker 3:          00:08:12       mmm.

Speaker 1:          00:08:13       Just horrible defense. You know what I mean? I would say though that that guy running for like 6,000 yards against us, it's definitely a concern. But you know, what are we supposed to win it every fucking year? You know? I'm all right with it. I love it. I love it. So there we go. So now what? Now what we go 11 and five. They'll fix it, but I don't know. You know, we don't, we always fucking have guys and then they make the pro bowl and then they asked for more money. Then we let him go and then we got to build it back up again. So we'll see. It is definitely towards the end of Tom Brady's career. You know, I don't know how it could have gone any fucking better.

Speaker 3:          00:08:49       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:08:51       You know, what are you going to tell me what the you do? You know why so many people out about that? Aside

Speaker 4:          00:08:56       from the fact that they hate the patriots, it's, that's how people, that's how most people live their lives. You know, they take one loss and they just pack it in.

Speaker 5:          00:09:05       Oh,

Speaker 4:          00:09:08       and I'm including a lot of patriots fans, you know, those ag, but she can never listen to those sports shows. Cause even like the people who call in, you know, they always use words like concerned,

Speaker 5:          00:09:20       Oh dre, right now I'm really concerned about our past DeepBench on dirt Jones

Speaker 4:          00:09:25       are you, what are you concerned about as if you're like, you're, you're a part of the coaching staff and if it doesn't work, you're going to get fired. You're gonna have to put your house up for sale and reload, relocate your kids once again. What exactly are you concerned about? Um, but congratulations to the chiefs. I've actually, I've always liked the chiefs. Um, I used to always watch the Superbowl highlights and that one with tanks, tramp, you know, 64 talks, power trap. It was always like the one of the great ones. She's just sitting there laughing his fucking balls off. And everybody loved that back then. But now if they had that audio, he'd have to issue an apology to the Minnesota Vikings and bud grant in the family and all that bullshit. But um, so anyways, I was flying back from Alabama and uh, so the only football games I was able to catch, I watched the uh, Green Bay Seattle game, which I know Seattle fans, hey, cause they, they definitely seem like they were getting the short end of the stick. Certainly on that phantom punching a injection, which I didn't see. I just saw the replay of it. Of course it happened on a fucking pick six. Always fun to watch Pete Carroll loop blow a fucking gasket. But that guy is a great coach and that's, that's a great defense. You know what I mean? The fucking legion to do, you know, legion of boom, sorry, boom. Right in your ass with the steroids.

Speaker 6:          00:10:45       Okay.

Speaker 4:          00:10:46       Fuck all you guys. If you're going to bring up every fucking God damn time, Jesus Christ, we bend a card in fucking New England. I'm fucking trashed. And everybody, I am doing research on all your fucking teams and I'm going to do what you guys do every fucking time. You give me shit about my, I'm fucking fine. I'm going to fucking look in the corners of your franchise. Jesus Christ's like 30% of that fucking team tested pause, defense tested positive for fucking steroids and this still just talking about how great they are. Unbelievable. That's another colts won that gout caught the fucking allegedly deflated ball, which was never fucking proven.

Speaker 3:          00:11:24       MMM.

Speaker 4:          00:11:26       It's never fucking proven yet. Tom Still got fucking suspended. Everybody's basically paying the price for the under suspension of Ray Rice. I think when they go into Roger Goodell, um, how site would see that the Patriots lost after the, uh, those barstool guys had that hilarious t shirt to him, just like a fucking clown. Is there anything better than just call and say he's a fucking clown? All your accomplishments just go right out the window. They're fucking guy. Roger Goodell makes $30 million a year, $30 million a year, and you can catch a walk into his car and you're going to tell you you're a fucking clown. I'm telling you, as much as he has $30 million puppy, seven, 16, after taxes, it bugs him. He's going to be thinking about it when he's drinking his little donkeys, coffee in the morning. Fuck is that guy to call me clown talking himself.

Speaker 4:          00:12:13       You know, when he's putting his suit on and he's got the jacket, tie and shirt, he looks like one of those guys. He gets everything on. He puts the pants on last Clooney already has his shoes on with the fucking socks in the sock. Garters you're going and talking to himself as he's adjusting the nut in the fucking, the night right there and then in the mirror. Um, so anyways, so I watched that game and uh, the defenses, uh, look to obviously great and those fucking games. And uh, and now I got the, I got the cowboys and giants in the background. Um, I did watch the Moto GP race. I just watched the uh, the big boys. I didn't get to watch a moto GP, three or two, but what a fucking race about mark mark has just saying, you know, Davinci also, it's just like, hey man, I'm going to take, I'm going to take the bucket points.

Speaker 4:          00:12:58       Mark Marquez is like, fuck that. Fuck that. I'm going for the victory for you guys at all. Watch motorcycle racing. It was raining out and they still race. They don't quite go as fast, but they were going like over 150 miles an hour in the fucking rain on each other's asses. And this guy, what the fuck was his name? He started the race. He fucking shot right up the side in the first place. What the Fuck is be able to pee? I can't, I don't know. I'm new to this sport. I don't know all their names. So anyways, now it did. It was that guy a bill. Why don't you just look this shit up so he can tighten? You know what happened? He just can't remember the fucking names. What was the guy's name? Larry Legend. Is that the guy who fucking shut up and first before he fucking wiped out, there's more goddamn accidents today or yesterday, I should say when they were racing.

Speaker 4:          00:13:46       And uh, anyways, everything that Formula One needs moto GP has, it was a race right down to the end. And fucking Mark Marquez said, fuck this, I'm going for the points. Because if he got the 25, he was going to be tied with Da. Oh. So he passed them on the fucking last lap or second to last lap and then held them off. Um, you know, there was some film Nicholson Shit, you know, I'm not going to fucking, you know, just try and get back out on the fairway. I'm going to try to put it in the hall, then I'm going to four point and walk away with sweaty tits. I mean, that's what this man did, but basically on a motorcycle. So that was very enjoyable. Uh, but let's get down. Let's talk about going down south now that the Patriot season is evidently over and Tom Brady is a over the hill.

Speaker 4:          00:14:29       Um, you know, the Atlanta Falcons won today in the New England patriots. Lost the exact opposite thing that happened the last time. Um, so there you go. I don't know what that means. I'm sure Atlanta Falcon fans, if they could switch, you know, the results with the Patriots, I think they would, you know, but evidently the fucking football sky is falling. Um, you know what I fucking hate about fantasy football? That is literally taken over like um, they used to have like in the sports pages, he used to just have, they would have like the leaders, it was sunny. It was really easy to find the leaders. You could collect football cards and shit. I used to know so much more about the game. I don't know anybody's fucking name anymore. Anytime you go to any sort of website where they have like fantasy, they the, when you want to look at stats, it's all this fantasy football shit. Get this guy on your team. Peyton Manning's fucking advertising that stuff.

Speaker 2:          00:15:24       Okay.

Speaker 4:          00:15:24       I Dunno. Should I just give in, should it just give, I don't want it. I don't want to do that shit. I don't want to have somebody on a team that I actually, I don't really hate any other team in the NFL. Do I hit anything I hate gym or say that's it. That's the only person I don't like. You know, there's certain people that act like fucking idiots in the league that I don't particularly care for, but that I don't hate the team. You know? Here's another classic. The cowboys are probably going to beat the giants cause this is what the cowboys and giants to the cowboys win in the beginning part of the year. And then the giants always fucking losing in the end. They come back around and they do the same thing down in New York. So time to move on from Ely, he only steps up in every fucking big moment in January his entire career. I think it's time to get rid of him because he fucked up in September. Um,

Speaker 2:          00:16:13       yeah.

Speaker 4:          00:16:14       You know, I didn't even want me to look this shit up. Did that as Zq Elliot guy play seems to me. What's weird is they threw out his case in the real world.

Speaker 2:          00:16:25       Yeah.

Speaker 4:          00:16:25       But it's like in the NFL, you need less burden of proof.

Speaker 2:          00:16:30       Okay.

Speaker 4:          00:16:31       Elliot cowboys, is that his fucking name? Uh, Elliot cowboys to play. Is he playing judge grants? Temporary restraining order requests for Dallas cowboys running back probably from that cycle. What would the person of seeming like a psycho.

Speaker 4:          00:16:52       Okay. Is He, cause he goes, I'll, it really makes you, I've been out of the loop. All right, so he played, that's good. That's good. Cause the clown was going to over suspend them. The ALGA, that's the NFL is back. And so at the 15 reasons it's a complete disaster. Hey, y'all bought those Los Angeles Rams coming back wearing the lumbar Lundy. Fucking blue and white. The fearsome foursome. Merlin Olsen. Rosey Greer. Was it Lamar Lundy? I always forget him. And then uh, what's his face there? Ah, I can never name all four of them. I always end up forgetting one. I always remember Merlin Olsen Rosey Greer out Jesus Christ. The coolest one of them are Deacon Jones and it was at Lamar, Lamar, Lamar, Lamar Lundy. Is this even a podcast? Is this, you guys listen to me fucking yeah, there you go. Right. Lamar Lundy, was he a stealer or was he a Ram? He was a Ram Lamar. Lauren Graham's fearsome. I right. I got

Speaker 1:          00:17:49       it. All right. So anyways, let's get, let's, let's, I'm not watching TV anymore. Now I'm focused.

Speaker 2:          00:17:54       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:17:55       Now I'm focused. Oh, is Eli driving him in? What's he got his second and eight, eight oh nine to go in the third quarter. Eli calling a fucking audible over the metal, foreign affairs down, moving the ball. Cowboys fans are all going to be fucked saying you need to fucking bench fucking quarterback and bring back Roger Stolle back. Um, so we did the, uh, the Horseshoe Casino in Mississippi. I had so much fucking fun doing that.

Speaker 2:          00:18:26       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:18:28       Although it was just a part of the south man that was just deep, deep, deep, deep south, deep south. Hang a fucking right. Don't stop. And Alabama keep going. Stop right before you get the fucking wheezing. Know. And um, it was just, I dunno, the pace of the people down there was driving me fucking nuts. You know, I ordered room service twice. I kept ordering water and they just wouldn't bring it up to me. So the second time I said, did you, where's the glutton? Is there a glass of water? And she's like, well, now I'm try.

Speaker 2:          00:19:03       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:19:04       And I'm like, and, and that's what's on the tray. It's just fucking walks out. There's no, Oh, I'm sorry. I'll go get you some. It's like it wasn't on the tray. So then I go to use it like nothing fucking worked. I go to use the fucking irony board. The ironing board was fucked up. I was trying to make it stand up. It wouldn't stand up. I had to bend the piece back. It wouldn't. And then I finally just had a fucking meltdown and I'm admitting this to the casino. I jumped up and down on it and then I pulled the shark nose back. I felt bad afterwards and I tried to bend it back, but it's all fucked up. If you wonder why it's fucked up, I finished it off. It was already fucked up. So if you want to send me a bill, I apologize.

Speaker 1:          00:19:49       Um, and then the next day meet Dean and Bart. Nick drove over and to Tuscaloosa to go on. We went to go see Alabama versus Fresno state. Uh, we had a great fucking time. Um, we met some people there, some friends of mine and a, they hooked us up. We were, and I think this fucking skybox no sunburn. You know, it was a cupcake game. Who's kidding? Who Against Fresno state. It was a day game. It's like I went, but I have to go back there again. I want to go there and night game when they play like Texas a and M, Mississippi or fucking, you know, anybody like Lsu or some shit like that. I want to go back for that and I want to sit in the fucking crowd the next time. Um, this was like, it was too nice. It was awesome. I had a great time, but it was like a, I didn't, I didn't get to feel the crowd a little bit, which was perfect because I had a show that night, so I didn't drink. I'm still not drinking and I didn't get a sunburn. So it worked out for me, but I feel like I kind of went to a preseason game. Um,

Speaker 4:          00:20:49       so we're walking out of there and fucking Joe Barton. It's somehow found the one Russian guy in Alabama. Then shit escalated quickly.

Speaker 2:          00:21:01       Okay.

Speaker 4:          00:21:01       You know, bardic walks up to the guy, the guy, uh, I don't know how they got into a conversation. The Guy said he was, somehow, he said he, he always heard his talk and he mentioned, said something to us, we're waiting for the elevator. And the guy said that he was Russian, so bar next to a huge penguins fan. And he goes, yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:21:18       oh, he's that guy. You're a Russian. He goes, hey, you know, you'd say Gino Mulkin Malkin right? Hey, you're like Malcolm. The guy's like, yeah,

Speaker 4:          00:21:25       Nah, Nah. He's like, I like go. He's like, I let go vet skit.

Speaker 1:          00:21:30       You like a back shit. And then he gets right in the guy's face and he goes, zero cops, zero cops. He's like a vege kidney goes

Speaker 4:          00:21:38       doing the choking thing. Right. Joe had had a couple of SAS Barilla's who's kidding who, right? So they fucking start going back and forth. And the e Joe keeps giving him shit. The guy's going, oh, come on man. It's a team game.

Speaker 1:          00:21:53       Cops. And how can you like Xero Cups? Xero cuff. It keeps it active.

Speaker 4:          00:21:58       The guy's choking on a fucking Dick in the Russian guys get mad. Joe's fucking around. He's not seeing it. And the fucking elevator can not come fast enough because it looks like it's going to escalate into a fight, which, you know, Joe Barton, nick and this Russian guy was actually taller than Joe, but he was skinnier. But you know, you sell so Russian, you know what I mean? So you know, you know, it's fucking people. They be, they be, they fucking bitch slapped Hitler all the way back to fucking Berlin. You know, let people out of prisons and say, Hey, remember we throw you in there for, why don't you come out and go do that to people who look like this? And that's what they did. Half of them weren't bare feet. I mean, I know it's a legend at this point, but it's just, it's pretty much fucking true. So now I'm concerned because they're both Joe's like whatever, six for this guy's like six, five. And I kept going, Joe, hey man. Hey Joe, take it easy.

Speaker 1:          00:22:50       Go ahead guys. That he just kept doing it and then he's laughing at the guy

Speaker 4:          00:22:57       and I don't know what, he just wasn't seeing the guy getting mad. So the guy goes, hey, why don't we go around the corner?

Um, we actually left the game, uh, halfway through the fourth quarter because we had to go do our show, but we wanted to go around and get a picture in front of the bear Bryant Statue. And uh, we actually got one in front of the Nick Saban one. There's one other guy that nobody, everybody always forgets he's only won one championship, but it was pretty fucking amazing to uh, to go there. I'm telling you, if you, if you get a fucking chance, man, everybody wants to go to the ballparks. All the baseball parks, they go to a fucking Lambeau field and that type of shit, which I understand, but you know, all you guys who live in pro football cities in, in, you know, New York, Chicago, all that pro shit.

You're like, oh my God, fucking football season. It's fucking great. Then all of a sudden it's like it's the playoffs. And you're so focused on the playoffs playoffs that all of a sudden like it's that week between the championship game in the Super Bowl and you're like, what the fuck happened?

Speaker 1:          00:25:37       You so busy putting money on the games and betting on the fucking games. You don't realize not only is there only one, two teams left, there's only one game left and then then we're fucked. Then we'll fuck too. Then the panic starts to set and then you think, well at least I got march madness, right. At least it got march madness and then I got the the hockey and the basketball playoffs and then there's just a, it's just, you know what it really is. It's just July. It's that one panic of July and into August. The dog days of baseball

Speaker 4:          00:26:09       that you have to fucking deal with. That's how I ended up getting into fucking, I think Formula One and all that shit just to cover that. Then I totally got into it. I don't know. I feel like I've been talking in circles for like fucking 25 minutes. What is this? How many? How many awful minutes? This has been 26 see that comedian long enough. You can, you can, you could sense time. I had this feeling that had been bombing for 26 fucking minutes.

Speaker 4:          00:26:56       black, which I had never heard of. And I'm like, I am fucking buying that when I get, when I come back off the plane and when I got off the plane I, you know, I think I flew delta out United on the way back. So it wasn't there but I was going to buy it. You know, I'm sitting there talking to myself like, am I done? Like I was actually thinking on the plane today, like I might be done for good. And then I came home and I ordered these whiskey glasses and I'm like, well that's not a good sign. Like if you just say, I'm done with heroin. And then you go to Amazon or you go to like syringe.net, you know, and you just order a bunch of fucking drug paraphernalia,

Speaker 2:          00:35:38       loves me. I can see it in his eye. And you're actually thinking about that bottle of booze that you bought. How are you going to go out in the garage like a fucking degenerate? Sit some dirty chair. You don't give a shit, right?

Speaker 4:          00:35:52       Pour that glass. You set the bottle down. It touches the floor. You hear it echoing in your garage. You know that garage that's yours, right? That garage that you made the decision, you weren't going to be like these. Most of these guys who let their wives not only take over the house, but also the garage, right? And they just fill it up with all this shit. You can't even get the fucking car in their garage is yours. He put up the DART board. You get the Keg rater. That sets you little fucking tree fort. You know mean. Who's kidding? You're a guy. You're still a child. Just because you can grow a beard doesn't mean you're mature. All right. What'd you look at all these stars doing these fucking commercials now? Jesus fucking Christ. Can you leave something on the bone for the struggling actor? Can't you just do a fucking ad over in Guam like you used to? Um, anyways,

Speaker 4:          00:36:50       well, well, well Dre, I want to Redo my fucking garage again. Oh God, I gotta I gotta add something else in there.

I haven't driven my truck in like two weeks, man. I miss it. Uh, I gotta do that Sunday. I got to have the garage with the fucking room above it. You just have to have it. That's what it is, you know?

Speaker 4:          00:37:18       And then what'd you do? You have a fucking prenuptial agreement that if we get divorced, I get the garage and the room above it and you can not fucking evict me. That will be mine and you will get the fucking house. But you know, something fucking, they'll just people. But I just still feel safe with him being out there. They'd cry their way into getting that to, you know, I swear to God, I wonder if anybody, like when a hurricane's coming in, if they're in an unhappy marriage, like what's going through their mind? You just sitting there with your wife, you know, she doesn't know that you bought a boat. They get tied to the back of the house, a little fucking row boat. You know, she can't see it. You convince her to try to ride out the storm and then when the water comes in you like say you're later. Oh Jesus, Bill. Um, all right, let's get to the fucking questions this week. I apologize.

I'm one of those guys, but I know piss people off talking about it. My pole position. Drink. Quite happy to drink these beers all night. Drink iph all night. Jesus Christ. It's like drinking a Thanksgiving dinner. Each pint is so fucking I hate. There's so fucking I, you know, every once in a while, if I just want to have one beer, but I know I'm going to drink 30, I'll have an IPA because by the time I'm done with it, I'm just like, Jesus Christ had enough and I put the fucking hops.

Speaker 1:          00:41:48       Good Lord. It's like overacting could bug in your eyes out of your fucking head. I get it. Beer supposed to have hops as long as you don't drink any of those stupid beers that have those, those aggressive for no reason. Names, you know, angry fuck face. Kick your mother and the cut beer whenever they lay him. Angry Ale. All right. Is second batter would be for the Ferrari team. Jack Daniels Black label old number seven, whatever you want to call it.

This guy's a rum drinker. When I started drinking rum and move to the red bull team not long after. All right, Molly, she didn't mix that with anything. The highest, the American Formula One. Jack Daniel's single barrel one for the Americans. There you go. The only whiskey I really drink. Neat. Good man.

Speaker 1:          00:45:04       question number two or whatever the fuck I'm doing this week. A rhinestone stone ball bag. Billy, uh, love the podcast and love when you rip into the more on simply for being morons. Keep it up. That's why I trashed myself so much. I wanted to throw down a booze lineup, but for hockey. All right, here we go. We're going for more booze line am I feel like this is getting old people. I'm going to read this last one that's going to be it for the booze lineups and every once in a while we'll do it. Uh, we need some more overrated, underrated,

Speaker 7:          00:45:31       uh, center.

Speaker 1:          00:45:34       The Cindy crabby position, Miller genuine draft. I hate that beer. God bless you. Somebody's got to drink it. You pay a little too much for him, but he's your franchise player. See, you have no choice. Left wing is Weiser's black labels, smooth dangles and sets everyone else up. Right wing is Santiago 16 year Cuban run rum. Foreign player. Other teams are afraid to sign that plays his ass off every night, but take some stupid penalties, man. Number One, Jack Daniel, safe, gritty, defensive minded and, and you didn't break the cap. Hit Forum demand two cores light never misses a game, jumps up in the zone, but on the wrong end of the odd man rushes to often goalie is crown royal hometown boy that gives you 65 starts this season and always gives you a chance. Bartok would love that lineup. I don't know about Miller genuine draft, but he'd love that you've finished with crown royal. Uh, thanks and go fuck yourself. All right.

Speaker 2:          00:46:33       Okay,

I can't do this. There's too many boobs lists here. What's this going to get? Boring because it requires me to really read out loud. I'm not good at all right. Fingerprinting students. What in the fuck is happening to this world? Hey Billy Bo. Baggins I'll try to keep this short. I just started college and in the dining halls, they now only use fingerprint scanners to let you in. Cooking is not allowed in the dorms, so if you want to eat, you have to give them your fingerprints. I'm not one of those. I got shipped slash free tee shirt people. But what else can I do? You have thoughts would be appreciated. Thanks. And Go fuck yourself. Well, millennials, I think it's time you fucking rebel. You got to rebel against something here.

Speaker 2:          00:47:34       Yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:47:35       I'll go to subway.

Speaker 2:          00:47:38       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:47:39       Why do they need your fucking fingerprints and what are they going to do with them? Even if they're not going to do anything with them, they're going to hack into your system. Somebody's going to hack into the system that's so fucking nuts. That is legit. I honestly have to look up like how, how are co, how do people justify taking your fucking fingerprints to give you a fucking slice of pizza?

Speaker 2:          00:48:05       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:48:05       How do colleges justify taking students fingerprints? I love all the mainstream fucking pussy ass. Fucking corporate media never talks about this shit. They just sell people loud. Did just such fall these fucking idiots screaming about Trump and Hillary and this is what they're doing to citizens of this fucking country. It's fucking unbelievable. Can I refuse to have my child fingerprinted at school? Background of fingerprinting. I got to uh, Jesus. I almost lied to you guys. I got to read up on this. Like, I'm actually going to do this. Should schools fingerprint your kids? Isn't that of, what is this for? Let me guess. It's for our own protection.

Speaker 2:          00:48:57       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:48:58       All they do is make gift bags for people that know how to go on the Internet and steal shit. Here it is. Here's the fucking social security number with the fingerprints, the home address, all the relatives and all in a nice, neat, nice, neat little fucking bag. I, I can't fucking believe that this, these fucking jerk offs, these fucking jerk offs. Anybody Watches Fox and CNN is a fucking jerk off. When was the last time they held the feet of the fucking car instead of doing all of this shit at the end, the fire. When the fuck are they ever done that?

Speaker 2:          00:49:33       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:49:33       If they ever really gone off the pharmaceutical companies for starting a heroin epidemic and they ever really gone after Monsanto for fucking with the food supply. Have they ever really gone after bankers for what the fuck they were allowed to get away with 10 fucking years ago?

Speaker 2:          00:49:46       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:49:47       Jesus fucking Christ. You get one off colored fucking joke. They cover that more than these fucking insurance companies are probably gonna fuck everybody over. Ah, now I'm upset.

Speaker 2:          00:50:00       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:50:01       You know what I would do, sir? I would fucking somehow go out of my own pocket. Then I would fucking eat down the street for fucking cheap the best I could. That's why you can still bring snacks. You can't cook. You can still have a fridge, right? I need a bowl of fucking cereal. I would eat a fucking bowl of cereal three days, three times a fucking day before I'd get those fucking cunts. You goddamn fingerprints. First of all, you, all you're going to do is come out of college. You, you're going to be all these student loans and what sort of job is even to be there? You've got to give me a fingerprints to fuck these people. Fuck up. You know?

Speaker 1:          00:50:43       I Dunno. You're not even allowed to fucking protest anymore. You'd have to go to a certain section. You'd have to get a fucking permit to protest. Do I guarantee fucking t you? I guarantee you the reason why they're taking your fingerprints is an added revenue stream and they're going, they, you know, they're, they're going to fucking sell them to somebody else. All of those fucking people that take your fucking information. How we getting weed seed safe. It's secure, it isn't safe and secure. What they've done now is they've made it a lot easier for these people that go in and steal shit rather than having to having to break into you personally. They just break into a company and they get like a flu or whatever, a couple thousand people a whack. And then what kills me is after these cons, take your information, their system gets hacked into and you can, you sue them for putting your shit up there. Say it's fucking unreal. Anyways, I just recently had, you know, a TV network that I worked for sent me a fucking letter. She go in there and go read it and say, uh, you know, unfortunately someone broke into our system and uh, the, a lot of personal information was x might've been exposed. So all they're required to do after. It's like, why did you keep all that information?

Speaker 1:          00:52:03       We need to go back to paper and file cabinets. People. I'm telling you make these fucking pieces of shit put on blue cat burglar outfits have the flashlight in their mouth is they try to pick the lock to go in. I'm sorry, I really just lost my shit there, but I feel like my, I know even though I didn't have all the information I needed to, to make a logical argument, I I feel like I am right. I'm sniffing around something there. All right. Alcoholics anonymous. Hey Bill. I was in Aa for roughly two years. If you're thinking about attending, I would suggest you visit a library and get the AA big book. Sometimes they have a copy available. I would read it. Okay. Now you just asked me to do two things that are really difficult for me. One, going to a library and to finding a book and then actually three reading it. Um, what else you want me to dunk a basketball?

Speaker 1:          00:52:55       You're really getting outside the realm of what I do here. Uh, then I would also read the orange papers and online website, which attempts to debunk the AA philosophy, attend a few meetings and get a feel for it. But honestly, I don't think you're an alcoholic from listening to your podcast. I just think you're a piss head. Uh, you can put a cork in the bottle. I hear you sometimes beating yourself up when you've had three large pores. Oh, Jesus. Relaxed. That's not alcoholism. I love this guy. Uh, sure. You're probably not a good drinker, but it's all on a spectrum and you seem to be doing fine when you start drinking, cleaning gel mixed with fruit juice because it has alcohol in it. Then we can talk. I've heard it all in Aa and, and you don't qualify for the club in my humble opinion.

Speaker 1:          00:53:41       Take it easy. You're bald. Fuck. All right, well thank you for the kind words, sir. Um, no, but it's also, it's not good for you. I can tell you it's not the level that I was drinking was not good for you. Uh, but I announced them think Aa is bad. If it works for you, then I think it's good. If it doesn't work for you, I don't think you then have to go out in deep bunk it. What kind of a cut does that like alcohol and non alcoholic anonymous has helped so many fucking people. Let me look at the orange papers. Who fucks the asshole? Who to say everybody just always has to rain on somebody's parade. Orange papers here. I just realized something. We might be fucking riding out this hurricane down in Florida listening to this podcast. If you still have power, if you get a generator and I just said rain. Rain on your fucking parade. Sorry. Um, where do the orange papers? Orange papers. I spilled orange. Wrong. I put two n's in there. I Dunno why I said O r n a n g orange papers. Aa. Here we go.

Speaker 1:          00:54:45       Orange papers. Recovering from recovery, anti gay sites such as orange papers. All right, now this is just going to be another website that just hijacked the whole fucking thing so I can't get to it. Where are the original orange papers? Original. Original please, please. Can I get the original? I can't find it. I cannot fucking find her. What the fuck? Come on bed. Alright. It just clicked on this page and I see a big picture of a monkey leaving. Aa staying sober. All right, here we go. For the suffering alcoholic and those unhappy in Aa.

Speaker 2:          00:55:30       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:55:31       All right. Let's see what they pitch. Your body here for the suffering alcoholic and those unhappy and Aa alcoholics anonymous has over 2 million participants globally. That's it. It is a friendly and welcoming organization with many caring, helpful members. AAA offers companionship, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. If you think you have a drinking problem and haven't tried Aa, stop reading this essay and go to a meeting. However, a growing number of options of slowly we can. I want to fucking read all of this shit. All right. I'll take your word for it. Evidently we get Eli stepping up in the pocket. What's the score? Yeah. 16 to three, seven minutes to go. Did he just throw a pic? Who knows? Alright.

Speaker 2:          00:56:24       Wife working out with X. Oh, Jesus. Fucking Christ. If I saw that at the beginning of a fucking porno, I'd be like, oh my God, can we come up with a fucking less cliched scenario? Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:56:43       Oh, okay. Hey there, Billy red sack. Love your podcast. Love F is for family. Can't wait for season three. I wanted your advice on something. Here's the story. I got married about a year ago and me and my lovely wife moved to La right after the wedding because she had a great job opportunity. She had lived in La a few years ago prior to meeting me and when she was living here, she had a fling with some douchey if private fitness trainer, both of them viewed marriage as a stupid concept and they made a pact that when they'll get married to other people, they'd meet up and fuck, I don't believe a fucking word of this. I don't believe a fucking word of this. This is too stupid.

Speaker 1:          00:57:28       They made a pack. When when they'll get married to other people, they'd meet up and fuck. I mean, it definitely sounds like an la conversation in a gym. I'll continue reading. Uh, so as soon as she changed her relationship status status to married on Facebook, that guy sent her a bunch of messages, which was sexual and pretty much offense. Oh. Offered to take her up on the agreement and fuck. She didn't respond, but she did tell me about it, but I didn't lose my shit in remained calm in the last few weeks. She told me she's looking for a way to get in shape and she said that the Douche she had offered her private workout sessions in exchange for a help and his business, she's an accountant. She said that because private workout sessions are expensive and he's very good at what he does. This is a great opportunity that would save us some money. She said she made it clear to him that she's happily married and nothing is going to happen, and he understood completely. She asked me if it bothers me and I not wanting to look like the insecure, jealous type. Oh my God, you fucking dude. I'm telling you these fucking women are in guys heads.

Speaker 2:          00:58:47       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:58:48       All of this bullshit that you've seen on fucking TV. All of these fucking women fucking playing the victim all the time. All of this fucking coverage of just what guys do to women has now every fucking guy has his balls in his fucking back pocket. And it's just like, well, I don't want to be the guy that fucking makes you uncomfortable if she fucking tolerate this from you, you don't want to look into, that's not being insecure, sir. That's common fucking sense. So he honestly, honey,

Speaker 2:          00:59:22       I trust you. I want what's best for you and tried actually to do that. My question is, do you think she's trustworthy? Possible, but that guy isn't. Hmm.

Speaker 1:          00:59:34       And that guy's just drawn her in cause he wants to fucker. Um, she does have a history of cheating on her exes, but so do I. We both been happily married in our sex life is great, but still the doubt and insecurity about that. This issue exists. Love to hear your take on this. Can't wait for the new hour special. Thanks. And Go fuck yourself buddy, buddy. Yeah, no, no, no fucking way. No fucking way. Work some extra hours,

Speaker 2:          01:00:05       you know,

Speaker 1:          01:00:09       I would actually be willing to believe that she's gone over there thinking she's not going to do anything, but that guy's going to seducer. That's what's going to happen. They already banged. They're already, you know, physically like, you know,

Speaker 2:          01:00:22       yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:00:23       You know, the boundaries are not going to be there. And I'm telling you that that's not a good situation and you're not in, you're not insecure at all.

Speaker 2:          01:00:35       You know?

Speaker 1:          01:00:36       And so what if you are, that's a legitimate, that's a legitimate feeling, that full fucking thing. Let's let those stupid fucking tee shirts. I saw this, there's some woman was wearing this fucking tee shirt that I told you about. That one was back in the summertime. It said something like,

Speaker 2:          01:00:51       yeah,

Speaker 1:          01:00:52       a real man is excited by a strong woman. A boy is like whatever, intimidated or something like that. It's just some musical. Oh, I want to be, I want to be considered a strong man. I want a cookie.

Speaker 2:          01:01:05       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:01:06       I was reading that rolling stone where they had the, the, the actress that was playing, uh, played wonder woman and I was all excited to read the article in the first quote that they had. They said, are you a feminist? She goes, yes, I'm a feminist. Everyone should be a feminist because if you're not a feminist and you were sexist, right?

Speaker 2:          01:01:25       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:01:25       And I like bursting out laughing thinking like, well, it all depends on what your definition is.

Speaker 1:          01:01:32       Yeah. That's what's funny about these Hollywood people out here. I swear to God, they sound just like the Fox News, right? People, they're the exact, you know, Zara is zero tolerance seal think Savannah I do. If you do not, then you are this, um, like there's no clear cut definition of feminism any more than there is of like what makes, you know that's real rock music and in some ways always like Dutch, not rock dishes. Rob Dad's bullshit. It's the same thing with like family. Like everyone was a feminist the way my wife is, which, you know, in all fairness, this actress that played wonder woman could be,

Speaker 1:          01:02:13       I don't fucking know. But just to say like that is just such a, I mean, granted, it's a fucking interview. They're trying to get people fucking worked up to read the fucking thing. Maybe it was taken out of context. Maybe she said other shit, but just the way that's presented, you know, rolling stone is just fucking, it's soft Boldo it's just fucking is sufferable the way they handled Obama with like kid gloves and if you, if you're a fucking Republican, they stick your head in the fire. Now I'm not saying they shouldn't stick these Republicans had in the fire. I mean,

Speaker 3:          01:02:43       okay.

Speaker 1:          01:02:43       They're the fucking, you know, the, the, the,

Speaker 3:          01:02:46       okay.

Speaker 1:          01:02:46       They're bought and paid for it. That level. Right. Am I nuts? And I also thought Obama was too, judging by the $69 million with the tour dates he has coming up, given speeches to all these fucking rich people. Guy Just bought a $10 million fucking house is fucking unreal. And they don't say shit. All they do is show him playing, highlight and fucking going kayaking and parasailing.

Speaker 8:          01:03:11       Cool. I can't believe how cool he is.

Speaker 3:          01:03:14       MMM.

Speaker 1:          01:03:17       Anyways. By the way, rolling stone is trumped the worst president ever. I haven't noticed. He, it's not like you up and fucking written it. It's just like, I don't even read the fucking article. It's like I understood your point of view. The first 90 articles, there's so much other shit you can be writing about. You know what I mean?

Speaker 3:          01:03:34       Okay,

Speaker 1:          01:03:35       good fucking Lord. Like my, why can't you make fun of like extreme liberals every once in a while? Throw me a fucking curb ball, something. Ah, Jesus Christ, I fucking need to go buy some fucking tampons here. I'm sorry. You know what, when it happened, you know what the funny stopped was the fingerprint of these fucking poor kids, these poor kids are going to college. So getting it all in fucking debt. All right. And these colleges are acting like they've adapted to how quickly the real world is changing and I don't think they are. And that's why these kids are coming out and it's like they're coming out with degrees in like fucking, I don't know what the fucking a churning butter essentially, and then they can't find a fucking job.

Speaker 3:          01:04:16       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:04:17       Yeah, I don't know. I remember like, we always reading up about all these fucking amazing musicians. They would go to Berkeley and they would, they would never complete the guys that went out and seeing the guys that went out and did shit. They never finished. Like, they will like this, this whole being here. I got what I needed. Now I gotta get the Fuck Outta here. And, um, I'm not saying drop out of college, but I really feel like if that voice is screaming in your head and you, you fucking have some good ideas, why take on the last year a debt, the last, you know why? Because your parents want you to,

Speaker 3:          01:04:52       um, I dunno

Speaker 1:          01:04:54       what, because Bill Gates dropped out. If you drop out, I'm just saying,

Speaker 3:          01:04:58       you know

Speaker 1:          01:05:00       what the fuck I ended up doing. I didn't need to go to college and all those fucking village student loan, all a dead. And I left and I immediately went down to a comedy club and started doing shit jokes. Um, anyways,

Speaker 4:          01:05:18       we got to end on something positive here. Uh, please go to that. Steven. Al The Ronnie James Think, uh, I'm going to post that the bowl for Ronnie. Ronnie James. What a fucking voice and what a great guy too, man. I never met the guy, but like ball his interviews, he couldn't have been more down to earth. Uh, once again, it's going to be at pins, P I n Z bowling center, one, two, six, five, five Ventura Boulevard. Uh, it's gonna be a bunch of rock stars. They're a bunch of comedians. All Bolan raising money for a, I don't even know what the, what is the cause here? Why No, Ronnie died of cancer. So I imagine it's that right? Oh, Ronnie, Ronnie James Dio. Stand up and shout a cancer fund. There you go. Stand up and shout. Right. Um, so there's something positive for you and I believe it's October 6th.

Speaker 4:          01:06:08       All right. I will be tweeting that out and I am trying to get back onto Instagram. I haven't posted on Instagram and forever. I think I have to create an entirely new account because I keep saying I forgot my password. Please email it to me. And they haven't been able or I haven't been able, I can't find the fucking thing. Um, so that's it. That's a podcast for this week. Congratulations to everybody. One week, one, congratulations all football fans. That is football season. Uh, my favorite fucking thing happened this weekend, by the way, when I was in the Alabama theater, there was this fucking guy in the front row and he had his middle age too. We had his cell phone on it's middle aged guy and I'm like, dude, he recording the show. You recording the show? And he kind of was like, no. He goes, he goes up looking at the scores because it was Saturday night.

Speaker 4:          01:06:53       He wanted to see how the other SCC teams were doing. And I go, well, what's what, what are you watching? He was watching the Georgia game. I go with your Alabama to fuck. Do give a shit about Georgia for. He goes there in the SCC and I go, they're not, I couldn't catch you. They got that decent quarterback though. I don't know. They're, the crowd kind of dies down and this guy in the back goes, he says to the guy with the phone, he just goes, excuse me sir, sir? He goes, what'd he say? Oh, fuck it. I'm going to put you the joke. Auburn, Clemson, whoever the fuck Auburn was playing, it was like, I wasn't even there anymore. He just asked for a score. Oh God. What a fucking great setup or would have been such a killer story if I could have fucking remembered.

Speaker 2:          01:07:35       Okay.

Speaker 4:          01:07:35       Auburn score. What do we got here? That's right. They played Clemson.

Speaker 4:          01:07:43       Yeah, he got, excuse me sir. Auburn. Clemson. That's all he had to say. The guys just write it on his phone, looking to give them the fucking score. Um, I dunno. It's a great fucking place. Don't sleep on the south. All right. If you really think about it, your states just as racist. Okay, that's it. Go fuck yourselves. I don't know what else to tell y'all. Check in on you on Thursday. I hope. Um, you know, my hope is, is a little damaged in Florida as humanly possible, and that's all he can fucking hope for. And um, you know, all you guys make it fun of people driving electric cars. I don't know. Now you know what the fuck I drive gas combustion cars. So I'm not fucking looking down on you, but you know, I don't know what the battery does in the end when you drive the Tesla into the fucking ocean. Can you recycle the battery? I have no idea. But I'll tell you what that guys doing over there at that Tesla company. I like it. I like it. I just wished the car could look a little more meaner. Looks great from the back. Looks great from the side, the front. I don't know what it is,

Speaker 4:          01:08:45       just can't quite get into it. But uh, I know it's a fucking amazing car. But then they asked you these fucking cool, Huh? The Lamborghini doors opening up a plus. It's also a great way to win the war in the Middle East. You know, drive an electric car, you ride a bicycle, anything you do to use less fucking fossil fuels, fucks those people over over there and they don't have money to funnel through the mosques to give to the terrorist. And there you go. And then all of a sudden, oh, a Jimmy cracked corn is out of fireworks, right? Oh, I just saw the Middle East or problem or the Middle East. Prob not Middle Eastern. I don't have problems with Middle Eastern people. And this is why I don't hold office. All right, go fuck yourselves people. I'll talk to you on Thursday.
