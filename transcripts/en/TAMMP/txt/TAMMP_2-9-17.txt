Speaker 1:          00:00:01       Hey, what's going on is bill burn is time for them. Thursday afternoon, just before Friday. Monday morning podcast and yeah, just checking in on you. Just checking in on you, seen how your week's going. How's your week going? Hard. Did your fucking team have another championship parade? Like minded? Well, you know what? I wish it did. Why of function? My town have all the goddamn success. You know, it's fucking unbelievable. I still can't believe the one that fucking game, but I'm not going to go. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:00:31       One and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on. Right.

Speaker 1:          00:00:35       Um, I'm in Charlotte, North Carolina came in and day before the comedy zone Gig. I went to the, uh, shall at horn. It's versus the Brooklyn Nets, you know, and when you try to go to a home game, sorry, I'm going to, I don't have my fucking microphone, so I'm just recording. Right. If my laptop's on, anytime I click on something might be goddamn issue. Um, but, uh, when you're trying to do what it is that I've been doing, which is to basically go to all of the, uh, to go to a home game of every fucking team and all four major sports, every once in a while you got to go to a game. It's not the best game. You've got to go see a couple of franchises dead. Even though they, they've had their moments, this is not their time. They are, are currently re rebuilding and that, so that's what happened when we saw the Charlotte Hornets play the Brooklyn Nets. Um, a couple of nights ago, Jesus Christ,

Speaker 1:          00:01:28       it was, it was just like it was, I dunno, I dunno what it was. It was like a fucking WNB game. WNB At its worst in the first couple of seasons, you know, where they, they just didn't look good to me. They look way better now, the fundamentals and all that, if you watch any, the WNB but those first few years I couldn't understand why it looks so bad cause women's college basketball look better in a WNB. But Jesus Christ, Charlotte, first, Brooklyn, Jewish, Jewish, and I say that enough time, oh this is how fucking boring that game was. The kids that played at halftime was fucking more exciting cause they will run in the court. Big smiles on their faces was fucking hilarious. The game was like subdued, like you know, 16 to 14. And it was all lay ups. It was just all fucking run in the court. Lay ups was tremendous. And um, but anyways, last night, uh, we went to, um, you know, we worked the comedy zone and uh, I did the smartest thing I've ever done on the road in a long time was when the show was over. I just went home and I went to fucking bed. Um, because the Charlotte Brooklyn night, you know, I had a couple of flops, about 17 and a. The next day woke up. I'm like, what? What the, what am I doing? Okay,

Speaker 1:          00:02:45       what the fuck am I doing? Okay, I've got a newborn at home. I can't get any God sleep. I'm on the road now. I should be like a, a fucking sober as a church mouse. And just go right to bed. And that's what I did last night. Fucking phenomenal. Other than God damn fucking cleaning ladies coming by every 10 minutes.

Speaker 3:          00:03:03       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:03:04       Yeah. They didn't, they play some stain and doesn't have the fuck off side. Um, so they just keep coming. Housekeeping. I love when they fucking knock, right housekeeping and then immediately open the Goddamn door. There's that. There's the lost art of knocking on a door, waiting for a response and then coming in somewhere along the line. These goddamn kids today. Oh yeah. I just said that these God damn kids, they think the fact they just knocked that they can just, w means they can then enter the room. You knock, you wait for somebody to say, you know, hang on a second or blah blah, blah, blah, blah. You don't just knock on a fucking door and walk in. You got to give the person a chance, you know, put the dick away of something, you know. Well, who knows what they're doing. Maybe they're just sitting there in their underwear, right. I don't fucking know. She fucking knock. And you wait and then you went to, sorry, I'm just saying it fucking can't stand. That's one of my pet peeves in life. People who knock and then they just fucking walk in. Um, that shit. Or if you know, when you go into to a parking spot, you know with two cars could fit and you just stick your fucking cunt car right in the middle of both. So no one can fit two cars can't fit anymore unless you're driving a smart car. Um, so anyways, tonight you probably thinking, Jesus, Bill, I have to, uh, they're patriots super bowl.

Speaker 3:          00:04:32       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:04:32       How could your sport, I could just sportsworld get any better. You know what I mean? Well, after, uh, uh, a major dip I believe on Monday, which I think they, they did on purpose cause the Bruins had a little gap in their schedule with all the buzz about it. The patriots excuse, we have yard already care. Be a good time to get rid of, uh, quote Julian. And uh, I just want to thank coach Julian for, uh, being the best Bruins coach since I've been watching them. Um, for the last, you know, close to 40 years. Um, chasesL is Farzeen everybody. [inaudible] I'm doing my podcast. All right. Do you think or no? Uh, just the Thursday one. I'll be done like a half hour. All right, cool. Hey Paul, you go eat those eggs and then I'll meet your first team. All right. We got breakfast coming in and like 20. When it's done, I'll call you. Okay. Okay, pal. Okay. All right. The acuity anyways. Um,

Speaker 3:          00:05:47       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:05:47       The fuck. What the fuck was I talking about? Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:05:52       [inaudible] Julian, Jesus Christ. I'd never seen a guy more of a victim of the GM and for the, I do not that fucking move whatsoever. You know, I guess maybe if he had a fallen out with the people up top, I have no idea. But, um, how, how you just going to blame it on him and not get rid of your fucking GM? I don't know what they see in this. Our GM, I have no fucking idea. I don't know. Uh, I have no idea what this guy's doing. I mean he got rid of everybody and I just didn't, I don't see they, we actually were playing our best hockey of the year. I felt, you know, we won three in a row. Lost a tough one of the fucking capital's not a tough one. They actually kicked our ass five to two. But I mean what the fuck? They're the capitals. We didn't do bad for a seven seat. I don't know. I think it's a dumb move. You get rid of the guys like okay, you want to get rid of the guy? Who are you to replace them with? WHO's out there? You know, and it actually tweeted congratulations to every year, every other NHL team out there that needs a fucking coach that knows how to win a cup. Um, cause that's what we just dumped.

Speaker 4:          00:06:57       Um, I dunno,

Speaker 1:          00:07:01       I don't get to ship that stuff where the ownership gives into the fan base. It's like what are they listening to? The fucking Dope said. Call into sports talk radio. I've never called it a sports talk. I watch sports all the fucking time. I would never call it a sports talk radio show, you know, just specifically to talk about the sports thing. I mean, I'll call it into hyper show, you know, whore myself out. Oh, I would absolutely do that. I was speaking of whoring myself out. Um, well wait, wait, wait, wait. Let me get it back. So, uh, thank you. Hello Julian. And uh, for bringing us the Stanley Cup and uh, and in, uh, you know, 40 year drought, um, and continued success wherever you go. I know you're going to do great wherever you go. Hopefully you got a better GM at the next place you'd go up to.

Speaker 1:          00:07:51       Um, so anyways, um, after all my ranting and raving about a award shows, I think I might be a presenter at one. All Hollywood bill is the a writer's guild awards. And um, they asked me to be a presenter or whatever. And at first I was like, Nah, I'm not going to go down and do that fucking bullshit. But then, you know what, I'm actually, I guess soften enough or selling out, depends on how you look at it. But what I realize is that on our show, um, it's those award shows are a big deal for, uh, for the writers because that's how they actually get money. So if you win an Emmy, um, or a writer's guild or sag thing or whatever, it's great for the writers in the writer's room cause they can say that they wrote on an Emmy award winning show and Blah, blah, blah, blah blah.

Speaker 1:          00:08:47       So old freckles has to play the game a little bit. Um, go put on a God damn monkey suit. It's a fucking black tie thing. I got to go, I'm going to go to one of those fucking from places where they had the cheap tuxedos cause I don't think anybody can fucking tell, just come out in those God damn plastic bowling shoes. Um, I know who the fuck decided that they wanted me to be a fucking presenter, but like if they've never, they've obviously never listened to me read out loud on a, on my podcast. But, uh, I don't know. I figured this would be a good one to try out to see what I, to think about it. Because a, it's not televised, you know? And um,

Speaker 1:          00:09:31       I don't know if we'll see if I can actually read out loud. I Dunno. Knee has been on me about the shit. You got gotta do it. You can't play in a game. All right. I'm playing the fucking game. Why make a fucking difficult business even more? God damn difficult. Um, so fuck it. I'll give it, I'll let you guys know how that goes. How am I reading out loud, if that's in fact what they have? Me Too, but it's not bad. It's only like two hours long. Um, so it kind of seems like the best one to go to and Patton Oswald is hosting it and I think he's a fucking genius. So at least I'll get to listen to his monologue, um, that I am without a doubt. I'm going to get the fuck. I'm going to get a nice fucking, I'm going to get a senior prom special, the clip on fucking tie and all of that shit.

Speaker 1:          00:10:18       That's like the dumbest shit ever to go out and go buy some expensive Tuxedo. It's like, what are you a fucking Rockefeller? Uh, but I guess people trashed you then, right when you've watched walk the red carpet or something like that. Um, so anyways, so there you go. There's my full of shit moment after making fun of all those fucking award shows. Uh, I'm actually going to work. Go to one. I don't know. What are you going to do the fuck am I going to do right? I'm doing it for the tape keg. Can I get out of it by saying that? So anyways, I was saying, um, how my, um, my, uh, my sporting world, how it could get any better after the, uh, the Patriots win and then they, uh, the, the let down of seeing them give into the fan pressure or whatever the fuck they did. Get rid of coach Julian. Um,

Speaker 1:          00:11:09       tonight be frizzy and, uh, Joe Barnick or doing a bucket list thing for any person that's even remotely into sports. We're going to the, uh, the Duke versus, uh, North Carolina Tarheels game tonight, and we've got some great seats. Was sitting right behind the fucking dude bench. Coach K is going to be there if it wasn't so God damn loud in that place, we could hear him, you know, during the time outs and everything, it's going to be crazy. So, uh, I dunno, it was a chance you might see the three, three of us dummies on TV. Um, but beyond excited to go to this like this is, this is a fucking huge one. This is a huge one. Um, as far as the bucket list sports stuff to go two years ago I told you, I don't know if I told you guys I went to the, um, I went to a

Speaker 3:          00:12:01       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:12:01       Indiana university versus, um, what was it? Michigan state and I believe it was the year that Michigan State won the National Championship and Bobby Knight was still coaching there and um,

Speaker 4:          00:12:15       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:12:16       I've never seen anything like that. All the years, everything I've ever, every sporting event I've ever gone to, I have never seen anything like watching Bobby Knight coach a game. I mean, that guy, you watched him as much, if not more than you were watching the game. I was actually rooting for the Spartans. You know, I came there rooting for Indiana, but Bobby was so fucking entertaining. I started rooting for the Spartans because I wanted to see him flip out even more. I've never seen somebody, yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:12:49       yeah. She made me feel good about myself, like just complete loss of composure obviously, or whatever his coaching style motivating people. I remember they let up a couple of easy buckets and this kid, the point guard starts bringing it up to court and Bobby Knight is like 10 feet onto the court and he's yelling so much. He's like juicy. Uh, was it Ben Kingsley and sexy base? When he, when he's, when he's yelling, it'd be in a right content and he's like thrown his head into everything that he's saying. That's what the fuck he was doing. But it was way more intense because he wasn't acting. He was serious. And um, I've never fucking seen anything like that. And that's one of my favorite of everything that I've seen in sports. The coolest thing ever is that I got to see Bobby Knight Coach at Indiana University. Man, that's fucking legendary. Like scenes Zeplin or seeing the Beatles, you know, James Brown or whatever. Like you know that's right up there. I saw Eddie Murphy on the Rod tour. I saw [inaudible]. He's my brother. Think greatest things I've seen Eddie Murphy on the raw tour. I saw when he went to purple suit, I saw Bobby Knight Coach at Indiana.

Speaker 4:          00:14:04       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:14:07       The fuck did I go from there? So Judas Priest and the Turbo Lover Tour, does that count?

Speaker 5:          00:14:14       I know I saw Stevie Ray Vaughan.

Speaker 4:          00:14:18       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:14:20       I saw Dan Marino kick the shit out of the Patriots.

Speaker 4:          00:14:24       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:14:25       With Don Shula coaching. That's the one great thing. Yeah,

Speaker 5:          00:14:28       it will be in an old guys. You can start talking about all this shit since I can note that now. Fucking no longer exists. So I actually made a few guys who just bear with me clicking here. Sorry. I know it's fucking loud as hell. I know. It's annoying and you're going to listen to it again right now. All right. I actually looked through, um,

Speaker 1:          00:14:48       I got this, this document teams scene

Speaker 5:          00:14:52       and um,

Speaker 3:          00:14:54       yeah,

Speaker 5:          00:14:54       I have seen 31 I been to a home game. If every major league baseball team, I haven't been to all the stadiums cause like the mets changed. There's got a new one. Philly's got a new one. Um, but I've seen a total of 31. There's 30 professional baseball teams. I've seen 31 cause I went to the expos. Um, I've seen 32 home games of the NFL. There's 32 teams, but I still need to see the Tampa Bay Buccaneers there. The last one I need to see, but I saw the Saint Louis and the fucking, um, the Saint Louis and the fucking, uh, La Rams. So that's how I got up to 32. I've seen 25 NBA teams. Uh, one of those being the a, I saw both the Seattle Sonics and the, uh, Oklahoma City Thunder. Um, and I saw the New Jersey Nets. Now I got to go see the fucking Brooklyn that's speaking of which I also saw the fucking, oh, I see the fucking, the islanders at Nassau Coliseum. Now if they don't, if they don't become the Brooklyn

Speaker 5:          00:16:07       fucking islanders, then uh, then I don't need to go see him. It's like if you change your food that they're still in New York. You know what I mean? I don't need to fucking do that. So I've seen 27 of the 30 fucking, uh, I got three more to see in, um, in hockey. So I'm going to try to knock those out over the next year. The Fan Slam is what I'm calling it, you know, you know, Serena's fucking the Serena Slam. This is just the fence slam the fucking, you know, you have no life. You run the fucking road. You don't want to kill yourself in a comedy condo. So you start building it around home games. Um, back, she made a list and I don't know if you're not a sports fan, this is going to bore the shit out of you. But these are all the fucking places I've been to that now no longer exist. Uh, the Boston Garden, Sullivan Stadium, a Yankee Stadium, Shea Stadium, veteran's stadium, three rivers stadium, soon to be no longer there. Joe Louis Arena, the RFCA slash Hoosier dome. I saw Peyton manning there. Uh, I saw a game it original soldier field. Got a picture and then this fucking asshole stole my God damn camera. I would say at a picture of me. And uh, when I went to, um, a green bay packers, that game was a, um,

Speaker 5:          00:17:23       was a preseason game. They played the browns bread five or it was still there. The verse, he says, I can't count that one cause it's pretty seasoned. But the reality is, is he just wants me to book, you know, book a Gig like the skyline cafe and go to a packers game, which of course I will, I'll do all right. Continuing on county stadium to the target center, the Metro Dome, the Edward Jones Dome, which is still there, but the Saint Louis Rams don't play them anymore. Texas stadium, the Astrodome mcnichols Arena Mile High Stadium, Sun Devil Stadium, that still exists. But I saw the Arizona cardinals versus the Patriots there. QUALCOMM stadium still exist, but the fucking charges aren't there anymore. Uh, I also saw that the, um, San Diego Padres there and I went there with and watch Mark McGuire take batting practice the year. Uh, he broke Roger Maris his record and I saw him hitting number 27 to 28 there, uh, Edison field before they redid it.

Speaker 5:          00:18:19       Um, La, the La sports arena that's still there, but I saw, um, who did I see there? I saw the clippers there. I saw the clip is there and biggie smalls was in the crowd and four days later he was dead. Swear to God. Uh, the La Forum, um, I saw fucking a young Kobe Bryant and just left the, uh, magic shack with del Harris is a coach. I want to say Dennis Rodman was on that team. I went to candlestick park, sat out in right field and saw, uh, a early on he head getting bigger Barry bonds key arena for a Seattle Supersonics game with a rookie year. Kevin Durant. And then, uh, the kingdom. I saw young Ken Griffey Jr. I sat right out in center field bleachers and as far as I know, oh, you know what else, the, uh, the Montreal forum, I can't believe I forgot that I saw the mantra in 1989. I went up there and March and I saw I, uh, Canadians versus the fucking, uh, Minnesota North Stars with Patrick one net.

Speaker 3:          00:19:32       Okay.

Speaker 5:          00:19:32       I of course, rooted for the North Stars and they of course lost. Um, so whatever. That's, that's the dumb bullshit that I do when I'm out here on the road. And now I can add the a, after tonight, do Carolina and, uh, I want to thank the comedy zone for hooking us up,

Speaker 3:          00:19:48       mmm.

Speaker 5:          00:19:50       With some sort of Duke booster that gave us those tickets. And I was surprised. Of course it came to the game. I came to the game, came to the show last night and left without saying hello, which was like, at least go to thank the guy.

Speaker 3:          00:27:45       All right, let's start.

Speaker 5:          00:27:47       That's Delta, Sierra, tango, Lima, Delta. All right, let's get back to the top of the page here and finish this out.

Speaker 4:          00:27:54       Um, all right.

Speaker 5:          00:27:58       Has that been a half an hour? I have no idea. I never know whenever I'm fucking recording on just the garage band thing here. So, uh, we're going to go to the game here tonight. Um, I can't believe I'm going to see them be this close to fucking coach k. I know Duke's having a tough time this year, but coach k's back from back surgery and um, he did that thing where he, uh, I guess every once in a while I get so disgusted with his team. He doesn't let them wear any dupe.

Speaker 3:          00:28:27       Yeah.

Speaker 5:          00:28:27       Gear. And he won't let him in the locker room until they start playing at a fucking level that the university is used to see. You've got to love that old school coaching. That made me look up like, um, you know, I was looking up all this stuff on coach k and I didn't realize that when he was in army he played for Bobby Knight. I didn't know that he assisted with Bobby Knight and all that. And there's all these great fucking pictures. You got to see the way Bobby Knight is dressed in 1979 in Puerto Rico when he set the pan and games of course he ended up getting arrested because he allegedly slapped a cop or something like that.

Speaker 3:          00:29:02       Yeah.

Speaker 5:          00:29:04       You want to talk about a guy that needs to fucking meditate? Jesus Christ. Um, so anyways, uh, I was watching all this stuff where's coach sent me down this rabbit hole of Bobby Knight stuff

Speaker 4:          00:29:17       and um, you know,

Speaker 5:          00:29:21       my favorite clip of all the Bobby Knight ones was when somebody secretly recorded him cause I feel like that was the real Bobby Knight is I thought towards the end he kind of was, was doing the Bobby Knight thing. Like when he did that game face thing. I think at that point he was just, he started like hamming it up when he didn't need to. But like when you listen, that one where he's talking about the Purdue game coming up and that he has an eight and 10 record, um, I swear to God, I'm going to start listening to that speech before I go to the gym because I actually listened to that thing and he's talking about how he had to go to some function and he goes, I'm sitting down, I'm tired to sit down with a fucking eight and 10 record every fucking look. I'm sick and fucking tired. Oh, this isn't a fucking burrito.

Speaker 3:          00:30:05       Okay,

Speaker 5:          00:30:05       you guys get the fuck out there. Said some of the, if you fucking lose to Purdue, you put me in that fucking position. I will fucking run you something until you, I don't know, something about puking or whatever. It's, it's just such a great speech. And in the end of it, my natural reaction, I laughed and just said, that's how it's done. And, uh, I know we got a lot of criticism for the stuff that he did, but, um, I think a lot of that criticism came from people that are not athletic. We're never in a locker room. And, um, you know, they came from that hole, they actually had bad experiences in sports and listening to Bobby Knight Yell, I think just brought all their sucking in gym class memories back and, um, I dunno, it's like there's this certain type of person that is a fucking athlete and can handle that and understands what the fuck that is. And, uh, I think if they don't have a problem with it, all these people who don't play sports should just shut the fuck up about it because you don't understand what's going on. And, um,

Speaker 5:          00:31:16       I mean, Jesus Christ, Bobby Knight won almost a thousand fucking games and all his former players for the most part love him. And, um, and I always felt that kid that lasts fucking incident that Bobby Knight had. Um, I thought that felt that kid was baiting him cause Bobby Knight walked by and I think the kids said, what's up night? You know, say that that's totally disrespectful and night just had that fucking temper zero to fucking 9,000. Um, but I, I mean when I heard that story is like that kid was being a fucking cunt. Um,

Speaker 5:          00:31:50       but you can't do that shit anymore. At least during his heyday there was no cell phone cameras, man. He really would have gotten a lot of trouble because they would have been fucking video of that. And I would have loved every second. I would have loved every second of watching him grab some student by the fucking throat who just did what's up night guys walking around. 900 fucking wins. Some sophomore comes by. That's come on. Um, so anyways, yeah. So we're going to be hitting that game tonight. Um, if anybody knows a oh by the way, I have to give a shout out man. I went to a, um, this is my new thing now and I'm on the road, you know, cause I got my beautiful little daughter up at home and I can't play drums as much, you know, uh, knee is still lets me rehearse and stuff like that. You know, never rehearse like practice and shit when uh, what I'm homeless

Speaker 1:          00:32:40       feed the kids up blood. Um, I haven't been able to go to a, uh, you know, the practice place that I go to out in La as much as I would like. So I'm like one, I'm on the road out or look up these rehearsal spaces. So I looked up this place when I was in Charlotte, it's called the playground. And um, I went down, shout out to Eddie z who runs it totally fucking one of the coolest dudes I've met. A lot of these rehearsal spaces are just absolute shit. The drum kits are old. Everything's fucked up. Everything sounds like shit. I went into this place, this place was like a fucking FirstClass place. He stopped me in the best room that they had a, at a discount price cause they were doing construction on some other rooms that he didn't want them, you know, disturb me or whatever while I was playing, I played for like fucking three hours.

Speaker 1:          00:33:32       Well, I paid for three hours long to get it to about, you know, two hours and 20 minutes in my body was like giving out on me and I just had the best fucking time. And you know what I loved when I went in there, the snare drum was tuned to low and I was able to tune it up to some pretty good. And I used to not even remotely have a game plan on how to tune up the snare. And um, I was really psyched about that. Uh, but anyways, this guy at z was saying he, he actually used to be a roadie for van Halen and he was on the 1984 tour, the last phone with David Lee Roth and a, then he did a couple with Sammy Hagar. So he had all these fucking really cool pictures, just originals that he took of like Sammy and, uh, Eddie van Halen and David Lee Roth was really fucking cool.

Speaker 1:          00:34:27       And uh, I had the best time and like that's going to be on. So what I'm to do when I'm on the road, now that I'm, I'm back building up the hour, work in the comedy clubs like the old days. Uh, it had such a great time last night on stage, uh, comedy zone. Do comedy zones, one of the best fucking comedy clubs up there. By the way, if you can find the God damn thing, he got to, he walked in and there's like a cafeteria, then a bar and there's, there's a sign. This is comedy zone and nobody tells you. You got to like ask like 20 people. It's like you're feeling your way through the dark. Did finally go down those stairs that go down there, but just the hallway, there's the stage is set up. Um, it seems like every seat in the house is a good seat.

Speaker 1:          00:35:08       Um, you know, I'm obviously, I've never sat in the crowd out there, but uh, just had the best time working the shit out. I did two shows, both shows I was able to do a little over an hour just pasting together new ideas that I have and then old bits that, you know, never made it on to specials. And I'm just, I don't know. This is, this is, you wouldn't think so, but this is one of my favorite times of doing stand up is just letting everything else go and just trying to figure out like what the new shit's going to be. You know, I'm reading newspapers, I'm writing shit down. Anything that I can throw against the wall. Last night I was on stage talking about how fucking human beings are edible, like, and everyone was like, what the fuck? And that'd be something that I would abandoned, but I had no material and I just kept going with it. And um,

Speaker 1:          00:35:57       should, I dunno, it just takes me back to my early days. Um, I was stand up when, uh, because you, your skills, like if you don't have the material, it just complete your skills to completely diminish, even though you have the poise and, and the, the skillset because you've been doing it that long, but it's just completed just from imagine a band if they had to like just work at workshops, some rifts in front of a fucking crowd without like rehearsing. That's the greatest thing about the art of standup comedy is that you can't, you can't go to rehearsal space and get the shit together and then fucking like you have to second you like coming up with riffs in front of the fucking crowd. Um, and it's, uh, yeah, it's fucking work. It's absolute work. But, um, I dunno. I'm a fucking lunatic, so I totally enjoy this part of it. So anyways, that is the podcast. Once again, thanks to whoever it is that owns these two seats, um,

Speaker 1:          00:37:01       whoever that is getting in with the comedy zone, you have free tickets to any comedy show that I ever do for life, front row, whatever the fuck you want, forgiven given up these tickets. Um, Jan, thank you enough. This is going to be amazing. So, um, we're on our way up to a Durham and I was just out there, so I know a couple of good spots to eat at. So, uh, we're going to have a good time. All right. That's the podcast. Go fuck yourselves. Have a great weekend. [inaudible] and I will talk to you a, I'll talk to you on Monday. I'll let you know about the game. All right.

Speaker 6:          00:37:46       Uh,

Speaker 7:          00:37:48       Ooh.

Speaker 8:          00:37:52       Yeah.

Speaker 9:          00:37:54       Hey, what's up? This is bill bar and a, this is the Monday morning podcast. I just did a 50 minute podcast. I tried to save it and uh, didn't once again this week. Talk for a fucking hour evidently to nobody. Um, I'm going to have to buy some sort of device so I can save him so I can try and put them back up. I don't know what to tell Ya, but uh, I don't even know if this one's going to record. I don't know if I'm going too long. I don't even know who the fuck I'm supposed to call. Who the fuck do I call sound like I call this number on anybody you can talk to kicks up. You know, typical of how we're living. You know, I was on the fucking airplane flying out to Boston, right? I'm on the airplane and for some reason they always have the fucking intercom's turned all the way up to 10, right?

Speaker 9:          00:38:48       Hello. Is My goddamn ear drums out? So I say the lady, she walks by, I go, is there any way you can turn the thing down? He's like, Nah, I die. There's nothing we can do. The fuck do you mean there's nothing you can do? You can call up there, you can fucking turn it down. But it would, they be installed an intercom system on 10 with no fucking volume, whatever. Fuck this technology shit. I got to figure out. Somebody sent me an email about something that I can record into. I'm going to try to find that. I guess I got to go out and buy it, but I apologize. Um, I'm gonna try to do one again tomorrow or something like that. Uh, oh Jesus. It was such a great podcast. God dammit. All right. Whatever. I'm going to try it tomorrow. So all 14 are you hanging in there? I'm going to do a podcast tomorrow. Alright. Take it easy.

Speaker 8:          00:40:08       [inaudible] Hey, what's up?

Speaker 9:          00:40:17       Um, I don't know what the fuck is wrong with his cheek cast thing, but I have figured out how to save my podcast. All I had to do was press number two for some reason I wasn't hearing that, you know, I dunno she was saying it or whatever. The computer with the fucking female voice has been saying it, but I don't know what's going on with this thing. It seems anytime I record something for longer than, I dunno what a fucking go through, but I know how to save him. So all I'm saying is from here on out, um, I won't lose any more podcasts, but I'm going to do a podcast tomorrow and I'm going to save the thing and hopefully I can publish it. All right. Thank you for your patience and God bless the United States of America.

Speaker 8:          00:41:17       So [inaudible]

Speaker 9:          00:41:31       hey, what's going on? It's bill. It is the Monday morning. My podcast, I'm going to said poured the Monday morning podcast, we'll Guyland six 18 on a fucking Wednesday. And I learned how to save these podcasts and he go, this is the podcast. This is it. I'm doing one take. I don't give a fuck. I've already done it three times and I'm running a red light and I made it. Good deal. Good deal. Oh Hey you guys, you guys got cameras, you've got cameras where you're at. You know, you run a red light and they take your fucking picture and then for some reason you have to pay the fucking ticket. Um, I got a way around it. I got away around it that I've learned. Somebody told me all you gotta do when you run the red light, he's gotta be in the center.

Speaker 9:          00:42:21       You know, if there's two lanes, just be in the middle, have half your car in one lane after car and the other lane and it doesn't get your full license plate or your full face and you throw it. Granted, I haven't tried that yet, but I heard you can do that also is another way. When I got my car out here in Los [inaudible]. Evidently, evidently there's so many fucking people out here that, uh, that, you know, it takes, I swear to God, it took like four weeks or six weeks for me to get my license plates, something ridiculous. So basically I drove around for well over a month with just the name of the dealership where I bought my car, act on both the front and the back. And one day as luck would have it, I was like going to the airport and I ran a fucking red and they took my picture and I flipped out and I was like, ah, fuck.

Speaker 9:          00:43:20       You know, that's me flipping out that fuck sake. I stink at acting. That's good. Bill, could you raise the stakes you want to? I really did. I was like, you gotta be fucking kidding me. This is fucking punk shit. That's what I really did. But I didn't want to yell like that. And um, but basically all they had was a picture of the deal is, and my stupid a face, so I never got the ticket. Why am I admitting to this? Can they use this in a court of law? Come and get me say so anyways, I'm driving down the street and I don't have my laptop with me so I don't have your questions, but God knows I read them enough times that I can actually remember him once. So here's the first question somebody asked me, hey bill, what kind of drum kit do you have and where you're having a band and if so, do you have any good band stories?

Speaker 9:          00:44:12       All right. I have a late seventies Slingerland five ply the fireflies shells and nobody wants, everybody wants to three ply shells from the late sixties, early seventies to get that great tone. Whatever the fuck they're talking about. Well fortunately I'm a comedian so I don't give a fuck. I'll take, I'll take the extra two plies. And uh, basically yeah, they're all Bonham sizes. 14 by 24 bass drum. I had a 13 [inaudible] 14 and then an 18 inch floor Tom. So years later I bought the 16 inch floor Tom. And recently I had another bass drum cause I was listening to the Primus and I was like, I want to play like Tim Alexander even though I already had a double pedal. I'm like, I'm going to add another base drum pedal. Cause that guy from slayer said it's not the same unless you have the fucking both of them. So I went out and I bought another bass drum and I should have realized the fact that I suck with the double pedal, that they added a second bass drum. All it was going to do was just take up more room and it wouldn't make me any better a drummer, but I did it. So, uh, yeah, that's what I played. I got an old Slingerland kit and have I ever been in a band? No, I was never in a band. I just had a fucking, I did the drums were at my house so everybody came over to jam man. And we sucked. Which is why everybody who ever came over and now has a real job.

Speaker 9:          00:45:41       Um, yeah, that's it. I don't have any rock star. I don't even need to fucking Dan stories other than that. We stunk the usual shit. And the next question somebody asked me was, what the fuck was, the question was some question about I guess late at night they got these new economy dentures, something like that. That's what the person asked me. Have you seen these economy dentures? What the fuck is this? And uh, it's actually a really interesting question because I used to work in a dental office and I know a little something about dentures. Huh? We're going to meet peeling off another layer of the onion as Madonna says. You know, she actually had the balls to say that one time. She doesn't have any balls. God knows. We've all seen her Twat, um, that she actually had the nerve to say that when she did yet another totally planned out. You know, look, I can dress like a whore this way. Nice fucking parking job. You fucking idiot.

Speaker 9:          00:46:48       Fuck. I swear to God, man. People just, you know, people cannot fucking drive out here in la. They really can't. Like a lot of people don't know that. All they talk about is the traffic. Who are good. It's good if you could so fucking bad man. Well, you know what, when it clears up the driving get, then people can actually drive the, their uh, I have established it's before, you know, they fucking, they suck at driving out here. Look at that homeless guy. There's a homeless guy out here, I swear to God, he looks like George Clinton, um, from parliament. Anybody. So anyways, you're asking me what these economy dentures are. I'm going to guess that they are a one size fits all denture, which really fucking bizarre. And I bet um, on the upper it has some sort of form fitting thing that will fit to your palate.

Speaker 9:          00:47:40       It's horrific because when you get a denture, you're actually supposed to, you know, this impressions, you pour up a model. You know, if they took out some teeth, they tried to get the teeth to look like your other teeth. So you don't freak people out. Like one day you look like a witch and the next day you come walking in and look like Guy Smiley. You know, I used to work in a dental office. I actually am certified to take x rays. I can take impressions. The upper impression was the worst. I'd always get some. I'm just going to let you know that I'm a gagger. I gag. Really? Why don't you just brush you fucking teeth so I don't have to worry about you throwing up on the fucking left sleeve of my, uh, like what, what do you call it? The doctor robe. The doctor coat or whatever.

Speaker 9:          00:48:27       Yeah. I used to take the impressions and people used to always gag when you do the top. And if you hang in there another eight seconds, and then they always have, then they'd always say, yeah, God, I fucking hate the dentists. Really? Well, why don't you brush your fucking teeth? You idiot. You know? I guess I do the same thing. I ain't going to the gym, but God knows I'm going to go order a fucking pizza right now. Jesus, I'm going to move. So yeah, that's what I would guess. So basically after you took the impressions, if you want to know the whole fucking process and the person's going every five seconds, if they don't puke on you, you actually have a good impression. Then you'd take it into the little lab and then you take out a little green cup. That rubber Green Cup, that's all I remember.

Speaker 9:          00:49:13       Things can only be mixed in that. I never took a chemistry class, so I don't know why it couldn't be just a plastic bowl, but it was always those rubber things. And then you'd mix it up and then you'd pour it into the fucking impression and then you'd stick it on this little vibrating thing, trying to get all the bubbles out of it. And it was nothing fucking worse if you didn't get all the bubbles out of it. And then I swear to God, the bubble would always be right where that person's tooth was and you'd fuck up the whole impression. And then he'd have to go in there and be like, we gotta do it again. I'd have to deal with that again. So I would guess that what they're doing is, is they, uh, they're skipping that whole step. I don't know what they do.

Speaker 9:          00:49:54       If, if you take a whole pack of juicy fruit and you chew it up and then, you know, form it to the top of your mouth and then you mail that in and they make a denture out of that. I have no fucking idea. But that's really, that's really a scary thing. It's a really scary thing, you know? That's the kind of Shit I wish people focused on. Like everybody keeps talking about that fucking broad with the eight kids. Can you believe it? I mean, that's so irresponsible. Who gives a fuck? People talking about all the money she's going to cost us. She's going to cost the swat a couple million. You know? What about the, so you know, the fucking bankers, three quarters of $1 trillion, nobody gives a fuck about that. Some chick squirts eight babies out of her twat. It's going to cost us, you know, one half of 1% compared to what?

Speaker 9:          00:50:41       These fucking constant who stole a trillion dollars and then gave themselves $30 million bonuses. Nobody gives a shit about that. You know, some chicks squirts out fucking eight babies and all of a sudden no one can stop looking at it. You know why? Because it has a face. You know what she looks like? That's the thing. That's the genius of the bankers. Nobody knows what a bank or it looks like. I don't even know what the fuck my teller looks like. I go to the Goddamn ATM because I worked nights. Um, all right, what else? What else could I do on this podcast? This is going to be a short podcast. I'm doing a podcast until I get home and that's going to be it because I'm exhausted with these fucking podcast. All right? It's insane. The amount of podcasts that I've done this fucking week and to no avail. You know, it reminds me of listening to somebody talking about who the fuck was it recorded with like a Ray Charles.

Speaker 9:          00:51:37       You do like nine, 9,000 takes of Georgia on my mind and by the end of it you wanted to make them deaf too. You know, that's why I feel like right now with these fucking podcast. So, um, I guess the last thing that I have to do is I'm stuck in traffic waiting to make my left hand turn to come home to order a pizza. Uh, is that got announce the winner of the uh, the submissions for the original a proctologist I went to the proctologist joke, I got to omit man. They were all strong and everybody seemed to like, there's sort of an even amount of people like in every one of them except for one. So basically I think I'm going to pass out like a three or four DVDs. You know, you know what? Everybody's a winner except for the one guy, the one guy who meandered for 20 minutes about having the chicks Katie mashed in the mammogram is the only one that didn't get any votes.

Speaker 9:          00:52:30       Everybody else, the guy with the potato salad line got a lot of votes. The dude who freaked me out and got a bunch of votes and uh, the dude who did the, uh, had the great angle. I thought this was the most original angle of, of the gay guy bragging that he's dating approch cologists you know, if you didn't listen to that podcast, he was saying, it's kind of like if you know one of your, one of your buddies started dating a gymnast, you know, and then, then all your buddies would be jealous. Like Jesus Christ. I bet she can do some freaky shit. You know, he can bend her every which way. He was saying gay guys would do that. I bet they'd get jealous if you started dating a proctologist and they'd all be sitting around going to hi. I bet he really knows his way around it. Ass. Thank you. That was the hacky gay guy voice. I don't know if you guys noticed, but my chick's voice is basically the gay guy voice just done at a whisper. If you ever want to get that impression down, instead of going, hi fellows, I just go,

Speaker 10:         00:53:34       hey, what's going on? This is

Speaker 9:          00:53:36       it's relationship coaching. Exact same thing. I make complete fucking no talent and a, anyways, I'm in my garage right now. So this podcast is over. I know it was a quick one. I know. It was a quick one. All right. It's a little 12 minute. It's an EDP. All right. Like guns n roses life. That's what it's like. All right. Stop. I didn't drop the n word even though there was a half black Obama guitarist in my group. How fucking drugged up with slash that day where he fucking coach signed on that one. Anyways, I want to thank everybody who came out to the, uh, my shows back in Boston. Uh, the comedy connection at the Wilbur Theater and out in Chicopee, Massachusetts. I had an, I had a great time coming back there and a bunch of friends, family, former babysitter from the 70 showed up. It was a, it was an unbelievable weekend. And uh, then I went out to chickopee, Massachusetts. That shows sold out as well and a bunch of drunks and I made my way through it. And, uh, then I went back to my fancy hotel in Boston. I owe today Philemon Yawn.

Speaker 9:          00:54:52       The maid had left classical music on the clock radio. Trying to remember how this went down. That's why I walked into my hotel room that, you know, the turn down service, I don't know what that means. They fold your sheets back and they give you a mint and she left classical music claim on my clock radio. I ordered the filet minion, a little mashed potatoes, a glass of red wine. And I sat there and ate it. And it was one of the most loneliest experiences I've ever had in my life to the point I actually had to call Robert Kelly and tell him in the moment how lonely I was. The stakes suck too. I actually, it was such a bad steak. I actually didn't even consider putting a one on it. I went straight to catch up. That's how bad it was. And I don't put anything on, you shouldn't put anything on a steak.

Speaker 9:          00:55:47       They should just tastes delicious. And this thing was so fucking, I ordered it medium rare and it was gray all the way through and it was tough. Like fucking shoe leather. That Mozzarella. Um, anybody know what's that one from anybody? I'll give you five seconds to tough like fucking shoe leather. That Mozzarella, I only know one other fucking person. We have a new, that reference rubber brought it up and he owns Gotham comedy club. It was a Eric Roberts in the pope of Greenwich Village. Tough like fucking shoe leather that moves around. Anyway, the fucking steak stunk and I actually put ketchup on it. I like it. Literally take it tasted like fucking hamburger cause hamburger tastes great, but you know what I mean? Any chefs out there? You never put ketchup. Okay, let's do overrated. Underrated. You know what's fucking overrated? A one steak sauce. I don't even get it.

Speaker 9:          00:56:45       It, it, it's just, it sucks. I am in a garage right now talking to myself basically about fucking a one steak sauce. Who gives a fuck? I'm done with this podcast. Next week you're going to get, you're going to get a double album out of me. All right? I promise you. But this week you get in the eep. All right. Thank you to everybody who came out to the Wilbur Theater in Boston, Massachusetts and all you fucking meth heads and drugs who came up to the Hooky loud and chickopee Massachusetts. And uh, my next Gig, my next upcoming Gig, I am going to be at wise guys in Ogden, Utah. I believe it's Saturday night, the, uh, February 21st. So, uh, please come out to see me, man. I've never done a club up that way. I've only done colleges and a why don't you come along and bring your 18 fucking wives or whatever the hell it is you Mormons do out there.

Speaker 9:          00:57:39       And uh, you know, I figure you're a cool Mormon if you're actually listening to the stove, you know, come out to the show and uh, congratulations to the Lakers in the Cavaliers, man. You guys look like you're going to be playing, you're just playing a hungry or game playing a fucking hungry or game. But I have to, I have to say this before I sign off. I really think that, uh, the reason why I can't stand the fucking NBA is unlike any other sports like that, that sport, the officials control the outcome of the game. Like I've never seen. It's like, it always like the Celtics Lakers was a fucking great game. And then down to the end they just kept blowing the whistle on both sides. I'm not being a cry baby here. Lakers won fair and square. But I'm just saying, you know, sometimes they should just put the fucking whistle away, you know, just let them fucking play.

Speaker 9:          00:58:32       And they did that. And the Cavaliers game, it's like you've got these two juggernauts going head to fucking head and then this little fat, he flown his whistle. Now all the action stops and then, you know, you know, hey, stop pushing him. That's ridiculous. Okay, let's let them shoot uncontested. It's the most, it's the biggest fucking buzz kill to the end of any game I've ever seen. You know, and I love how God there's been a referee that was, has been busted for having mob ties in the fucking NBA and I'm supposed to act like that's the only guy that was just one bad apple, you know, I think, I dunno. What do you guys think? There's my question for you this week. Out of all the four major sports, which referee do you think if you bought them could really influence the outs? The at the uh, the outcome of the game.

Speaker 9:          00:59:25       I didn't have to go and be a cause. It's so easy to get a guy out of the game. You just keep calling files in football, you know? Do you want how many you took? Throw a guy out of the game. You've got to wait til he, you know, kick somebody in the balls and spits in the face. And I don't know what, look at me babbling and it'd be not literally the light and my garage went out. I got to get out of the car. All right guys. That's it. I'm going to save this podcast so you're going to hear it.

Speaker 11:         00:59:49       What's, I don't know how to fucking uploading.

Speaker 8:          00:59:52       It's been a brutal week. All right, good. All right.

Speaker 11:         01:00:25       Fuck list bill. I wake up at my girlfriend's house. She leaves to work. I can't find my socks. She says I have some. She says I have some just use mine and leaves. I wake up later and I looked for the sock drawer. Top drawer. Right. Um, and I find this list with about 20 to 30 names on it and my name is near the bottom. Oh No. Some have check marks on them, et cetera. I asked her about it and while she's initially upset it turns out to be her fuck list.

Speaker 12:         01:01:02       Yeah.

Speaker 11:         01:01:03       Wow. I don't have a fight. I have a list in my head. She actually made a fucking list.

Speaker 12:         01:01:09       Okay.

Speaker 11:         01:01:10       Dude, you coined a phrase.

Speaker 12:         01:01:13       Okay.

Speaker 11:         01:01:13       She said she made it after we got together with some friends drunk one night. She then admitted to being somewhat of a whore. Her words, not mine before we met, but assures me that she hasn't done anything since she met me with anyone else. I do believe her, but I totally blew up on her. And we haven't been talking for a few days. I also look a bit creepy as to why I went through her door drawer. It was in an envelope. Yeah. You know what it is? Yeah. You kind of look creepy, but she would've done that to you. You know women call it snooping when we do it. It's fucking creepy. Anyways, he goes, I need some help here on this one. Do I apologize? She already has. Do I just say fuck it and forget about it? What's knee his take on it? God dammit. You know what? I'm going to have to ask her. Take on that one. I'm not going to have it on this podcast. When I, when I go home, I fly home tomorrow, I'll try to have an epilogue to this podcast, um, or maybe tack it onto to the following weeks. That is a great question because I don't trust this girl.

Speaker 12:         01:02:32       Okay.

Speaker 11:         01:02:33       You know that when, when a girl, is that fucking free?

Speaker 12:         01:02:38       Yeah.

Speaker 11:         01:02:38       All right. And I know girls are getting mad. Why? Why can't we be as free as you? I'll tell you why you can't, because you don't have to work at getting laid. Okay? I can be sexually liberated. I still have to go out to the bar. I got to do a fucking tap dance.

Speaker 12:         01:02:56       Okay.

Speaker 11:         01:02:56       You know, like me getting laid, it's, it's like somebody on fucking, uh, American idol trying to get that ticket to Vegas. You know? That's what it's like, is it for most guys anyways, to get laid. Even if you get good at it, it's, it's like fucking, you know?

Speaker 12:         01:03:16       Okay.

Speaker 11:         01:03:17       It's, it's, it's not hot, but you guys, anytime you want to fuck,

Speaker 12:         01:03:21       okay,

Speaker 11:         01:03:21       you can fuck. Look at that. Golden Knights came up with a back out. I didn't know Hosea. I put my hand and I wasn't ready. 44 year old guy. I'm sitting there, the boop, boop, I can't even fucking talk. Um, so that's what I would be worried about.

Speaker 12:         01:03:36       Okay.

Speaker 11:         01:03:37       She said she's a bit of a whore. Like,

Speaker 12:         01:03:40       okay,

Speaker 11:         01:03:41       I don't know if that's a good thing or a bad thing or if like, uh, I don't, I don't know about that one. And she sat down and she made a list. Jesus Christ, 20 to 30 names. Now this is the thing, I don't know how old she is. All right. 20. You know, for a girl, 20 to 30 names, I don't think is even that bad. The fact that she, well I dunno, but it might be even worse because,

Speaker 12:         01:04:13       okay.

Speaker 11:         01:04:14       They, they,

Speaker 12:         01:04:16       yeah,

Speaker 11:         01:04:16       I'm not honest about their number. They do the exact opposite of what we do. Guys. We exaggerate our numbers. They dial them fucking back like,

Speaker 12:         01:04:27       okay,

Speaker 11:         01:04:28       like women's, how many guys have you been with? Numbers is like when they put out how many people are unemployed in this country, you know, they try to keep that number fucking down. It's the same thing. Uh, uh, fuck list. I mean, uh, I, I don't know how I'd ever get past that. You sat around with your friends, are your friends all whores, you know, and it's not like they just sat there going, oh yeah, you know, I fucking, you know, Bobby, fill up fucking Dakota Tornado ever fucking modern name. Um, Range Rover, whatever. Fucking people called kids and boys now. Um,

Speaker 11:         01:05:19       and then, you know, there's checks next to them of, of like what she did with them or how good the deck was. And, uh, I, I don't know if that's one of those things that they all fucking do and you just unfortunately peek behind the curtain and you should let it go. I have no experience with something like that. Um, oh, this would have been a great nia question. I have to do this with her and get into a fucking giant argument, but then I run the risk of possibly getting a fucking preview of her fuck list, which I don't want to know about. I don't want to know if, I mean, I gotta be honest with you. I don't give a fuck at my age. I'll give you a clean good. Okay. What do I think you will fucking God damn bubble. I hope you banged enough guys and learned how to fuck. I really do cause I don't need some fish in bed, you know, just laying there. Haman fucked a lot of people. Great. Isn't that Greg? Do you want a pilot who hasn't flown a lot of planes? You know there's give and take. Okay. You got a girl hasn't fucked a lot of guys, ed, you know?

Speaker 12:         01:06:22       Okay.

Speaker 11:         01:06:23       She sucks at Dick. Like she's eating green beans. That's the tradeoff yet. Oh, ah, dude, that sucks.

Speaker 12:         01:06:34       Okay.

Speaker 11:         01:06:34       That really sucks for you. Why were you going to wear one of her socks to work though? You know, with, with a little fucking Chris Everett ball hanging off the back.
