Speaker 1:          00:01:46       Okay,

Speaker 2:          00:01:46       I know. Well that's good. Um, what a week. It's amazing how much the world can change in a week. This weekend. Everything. Sadness, fear, triumph and conspiracy theory. When else do you need? And by conspiracy theory, I'm of course talking about how the fucking Los Angeles Lakers made it into the NBA playoffs. Dude, the NBA is the most manipulated. I, I, it's just, it's almost like they're trying to get caught. You know what I mean? I'm going to sound like this fucking guy who made this conspiracy theory about the bombings in Boston, but you know, to steal his fucking line, how much more proof do you need? Oh, you got to look at is fucking, who would you rather see in the playoffs? Who's going to make it more fucking money? Huh? The fucking Utah Jazz or the Los Angeles Lakers.

Speaker 1:          00:02:53       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:02:53       Jesus Christ. I mean it was, it was fucking ridiculous. And now they're in the playoffs and they, but people are gonna Watch cause they hate them. Just to watch them suck and watch them get pounded it jazz. Just fucking, I don't know. I, it's, it's the worst. It's the easiest fucking league to fix. All right? Nobody has more power than a fucking NBA official. I could fix a game. I don't even understand the game.

Speaker 1:          00:03:20       No.

Speaker 2:          00:03:22       All I gotta do is just fucking, I've said this before, all you have to do as a fucking NBA Ref, who's the best player? Give them two quick ones and then another, right? That is, he's sitting at turnaround, looking over his shoulder with his fucking eyebrows down. You know, some guys worth 300 million fucking more than I am and my stupid athlete's foot shirt. I just look at him like, yeah, keep looking. I'll give you a tee the tee up. All right, so now he's out of the fucking game. He comes back into the game. The second quarter. I give him another one that's straight saying the third quarter buddy. There's no other fucking sport. You can't do that. An NFL football,

Speaker 1:          00:04:08       you know,

Speaker 2:          00:04:10       I can't call intentional grounding fucking two times on Tom Brady and get them out of the game until the second quarter. I can't call three strikes on it. Fuck. You know what I'm saying? It is the most manipulate Avi and obviously brutally, obviously manipulated game. This is what kills me. What fucking kills me about the mouth breathing fucking morons that you walk into that you bump it to. She walked into, I'm a fucking mouth. Three more on. I can't even express my views. Um, I'm actually taking a class on that. How do you express your views or to call other people done without sounding dumb yourself. Have you found yourself on your podcast with no guests? No. Um,

Speaker 1:          00:04:57       yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:04:57       This is what kills me about these fucking mouth breathing morons. If you to start telling that the NBA is fixed or it's fucking manipulated, they roll their eyes at you like you're a moron. And what fucking kills me is they had a mocked up ref. They had a fucking mopped up ref. Then they do that shit. I was just what was just one? Yeah, just one bad seat in the NBA. It's boxing. It's basically boxing. What? It's, it's just as fucking corrupt. I loved that Shit. How it was just one how there was a mobbed up ref and no, none of the other referees on the officiating crew could figure it out that this guy was throwing games, a shaving points to me. What are they doing? They don't notice.

Speaker 2:          00:05:46       Give me a fucking break cause all I'm saying. All right. And then another thing is I, I, there's no other fucking sport with the star players. Get the level of preferential, I didn't want to hear it from you fucking NFL fence with how they protect quarterbacks. Okay. They do that straight across the fucking, they do that straight across the fucking league because those guys are the breadwinners and obviously a Peyton manning a Brady is going to get one of the star plays. Always get more preferential treatment. Okay. In all sports. I'll throw that out there, but none, none like the fucking NBA. All right. If you go near Coby Brian, you're getting a fucking file. If it doesn't go in, he looks at the ref like it didn't go in. Obviously I was filed and he gets to fucking call. It's annoying. Having said all that, as much as I hate the Lakers, that was the fucking worst thing I've seen is sports and a long time other than that kid's leg fallen off for Louisville was uh, uh, uh, Colby, uh, snap, snap, snapping his fucking Achilles.

Speaker 2:          00:06:49       But luckily they were in a, in an age now where they, the, he's going to be back there the way that they can operate on that. Like, what am I trying to say? The level of technology that they had, like back in the day, you were fucked. It was over by my buddy Jason [inaudible] had, who's got a great podcast himself, um, was saying Dominique Wilkins came, took a year off after an injury and actually came back and became NBA player of the year. But he was never the same guy. But, but it's different now. You know, what's your course? They won't take into consideration. So when he does come back, they going to be the most I believable and probable, you know, isn't it ridiculous? My, my level of fucking, it's not even a Lakers, it's their fucking fence. Their lack of knowledge on the game. Well, they have one of the most selfish self centered fucking players of all time and how the team actually plays as a tape when he's not on the fucking court and they still chant MVP. When that fucking cancer comes back out on the court, it just blows my fucking mind. You know why? Because everybody's in a fantasy league and it's all about, well, he had fucking 38 and Scholia 2,240 16 points better. All right, let me take my tampon out here in la. Let's get on with the podcast. You're listening to the Monday morning podcast and it's not brought to you by anybody this week. It's brought to you by me and my fuck.

Speaker 2:          00:08:11       Um, all right, so I started off with something silly and over the top. Uh, I don't, I don't like talking about heaviest shit on this podcast, but obviously I've got to acknowledge what happened at the Boston Marathon. Um, you know, I'm not gonna say anything that everybody else hasn't already said. I just don't know how somebody can, hi, how do you fucking do that? Just walk up and you setting it down and you're looking at people's legs and kids and Shit and you just walking away knowing that in whatever, seven minutes, eight minutes, whatever the fuck it is. I mean, just how do you do something like that? You know, fucking unbelievable. It's got damn nerds, man. I gotta tell you something. Nerds are some of the most fucking people on the planet. Okay? Those two were a couple of nerds, nerds, fucking MIT fucking nerds. You send me in a Goddamn hobby store to cannibalize some fucking toys. You think I'm coming out with a bomb? I'm not, I'm coming up with the fucking ugliest toy you've ever seen in your life.

Speaker 2:          00:09:15       I'll fucking tape together with duct tape. I didn't know what, what is in a fucking hobby store? What is in there? What did they, what did they, some glue. I don't know what they took. Um, and is another thing that's fucking annoys me. You know, and then everything's nerds. They, they make all these fucking movies like they're these great God damn people. They aren't, they aren't all the weaponry that you see across the fucking globe for as much as some sociopath thinks of this shit. It takes a nerd to make that psycho thought of fucking reality.

Speaker 2:          00:09:51       Fucking God damn nerds. You teach them, you know the secrets of the world and this is what they do with it. You know? Or they come up with something and then somebody else uses it for fucking evil. I don't know what the fucking thing is, but here's my thing. Fucking cutting. Get any terrorists listening to this podcast. Are you, I in a fucking cave right now. You know, jerking off to your fucking 72 virgins or whatever the hell they're promising you. All right? First of all, they're not there. When you die, you're going the ground. Okay? That's where you go. And so what you want to do is you want to try and stay alive. You know, meet yourself. Acute fucking lady, you know, have a cookout,

Speaker 1:          00:10:38       okay?

Speaker 2:          00:10:39       Ride a bicycle. Fill the wind in your fucking hair or in your beard. You know, what are you doing? When is your district manager going to go fucking do something instead of sending all you can sit over here is another thing too. How about you switch it up every once in a while and you go to a gated community? You know, does it always have to be regular people? Why don't you actually fucking go after the country that are making your life miserable and you know who I'm talking about. I'm talking about the fucking bank, you know, let me tell you something about these banker cons. They fucking own everything. You understand me? They own everything. And if they don't own it, it's just temporary because somebody's going to fucking die or need a kidney and then they're going to lose whatever the fuck that they own.

Speaker 1:          00:11:38       Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:11:38       You know, every fucking house, every fucking building, every fucking piece of property, every fucking blade of grass, these fucking banker conch own. And they look at it that way. That's our stuff. Okay. And then you go on it, you, you air quote, buy it from us and then we bend you over that fence and fuck you in the ass for 30 years. By the time you come out the other side, you're too fucking old to take care of whatever you bought. All right. Can I go up the stairs or the wrong through walls and then you sell it and then they get another 30 35 year old cut in there and they fucking bend them over. Fucking have add if the 30 goddamn years, that's what they do.

Speaker 1:          00:12:25       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:12:25       Yeah. So I dunno what those people were trying to fucking achieve. All they did was just, you know, make a bunch of regular people. There's no way to hear whatever you have, whatever your fucking causes. I don't give a fuck. You could actually have agree with me on everything that I think about the fucking world this second. You walk into a crowd and just fucking do something like that. It's, I don't know anyone we want to hear it.

Speaker 3:          00:12:56       MMM.

Speaker 2:          00:12:58       But you know, it was, it was, well, it was fucking amazing was how they just shut the whole fucking city down. I mean, that's just unbelievable. Nobody just stay inside and then you just got the only person running up the street is the guy you're looking for a couple of crackheads, you know, crickets don't have radios and plus they live outside it. What the fuck am I supposed to go in my box? You know, get your feet up on that park bench. Your fucking feet come off the park bench. You were officially considered outside. It gets to the shoot too. And your fucking neck deck kid. How funny was the news coverage? Listened to all those fucking Boston accents?

Speaker 1:          00:13:40       Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:13:41       Yeah, we actually obtained yet there's no suspects of Marcy Boulevard. Um,

Speaker 3:          00:13:51       yeah,

Speaker 2:          00:13:51       I actually didn't watch most of it once the bullshit was going. It's like, I'm not going to sit here for eight hours in watch a goddamn standoff watching these fucking news reporters grabbing anything with a mouth to start talking to them, you know? Well, we got a, Ah, we got a gentlemen hair or works, uh, he works at adamants bakery. Uh, you, you said that, uh, you, you, you actually knew one of the, uh, suspects or should we know about both of them had brown hair and, uh, my mother's got brown hair, so there's like, you know, it's like eerie, you know. Then one time they actually got a guy who were, were one of the suspects, dropped off the car, you know, and he had all this fucking unbelievable information and he's just spewing it out on television and I, and they're also filming the cops where they're at and their location. I just wanted something like fucking 20 year vet to come up to, what are these reporters? Stick a pistol right underneath his fucking Chin and just be like, who's fucking side of you are this, shouldn't this show? And what they're doing. I Dunno. But anyways, I was really amazed at how quickly

Speaker 2:          00:15:19       and efficiently that whole thing went down and how quickly they got those guys. Uh,

Speaker 1:          00:15:25       okay.

Speaker 2:          00:15:26       It W it was unreal. Um, and then I was happy that when I found out I'm sitting there going, please, please don't be from North Korea. Please don't be from the middle of fucking east. Please don't be from one of those fucking places because these fucking assholes are gonna beat us because if we keep bombing every fucking and going to war with every country that they're from, I mean we're going to go bankrupt. I mean, we just spent like fucking out of how many billions of dollars did we just spend to catch like 35 people? I don't know why we just don't send the drones over there. What are they going to do? Worst thing to do is they shoot, went down and gives a fuck. He just make another one. Have a fucking nerd. Make another one.

Speaker 1:          00:16:10       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:16:11       You just fly around over there, right? Damn. I know. I'm over overly simplifying it, but, um, then I found out they were from Chechnya and I Chet. Yeah. How the fuck you say it and how many people will like, like me who said that if from Chet, yes. You can't even say it, let alone even know where it is. I thought that was near like Yugoslavia or like a, uh, checklist Slovakia. And today when I went to look it up before the podcast, so I wouldn't even sound dumb or, um, I just wrote in Chetan yet, and I spelled it so bad. Oh my God, I spelled it so bad that, um, I don't, I have you say, I still can't fucking say it right. And I've heard them say it like 9 million times in the news. Like that computer didn't even know what I was, was typing in.

Speaker 2:          00:17:01       So I had to take my shot at spelling [inaudible] and then I've wouldn't Russia after it. And then I was like, oh, you made this. Um, evidently it's just north of Georgia and Armenia and as [inaudible], um, it's basically to the right and to the north of Turkey. You know, I don't fucking know. And you know what the worst thing about the bombing other than the tragic loss of life, you know, and there's so many, so much other stuff like just I would imagine people with hearing loss lost, you know, vision or partial loss of vision and just, I don't, just a psychological, all of that damage that was done, um, right up there. Not right up there, but a distant third to death and injury in psychological put it forth is the fact that I really felt that I was then in my own little way, I was starting to turn the tide and I was starting to turn red sox fans against that fucking Neil diamond song.

Speaker 2:          00:18:16       But now, now it's over because now everybody's all patriotic. You know about Boston, they played the fucking song, they played it at Yankee stadium. I'm getting Deuce chills just talking about it. And then Neil diamond himself, the devil himself comes to fucking Fenway and everybody region out touching me, touching the fucking joy in these people's faces as they sing along with this man who wrote a song about an eight year old girl. I don't understand it, but it's over now. I give up, I'm thrown in the fucking towel. It's, it's over. Cause now it now it is. It's, it's now associated with the triumphant feeling of getting the two counts that uh, you know, it started the whole fucking art, whatever. Anyway, I'm fucking, this is why I'm not a news correspondent. I can't even explain it without saying Kuntz who will responsible for the bombings of Boston.

Speaker 2:          00:19:22       There we go. That's what I'm trying to say. And now it's associated with that. So it, it's, it's fucking over fucking over. And, um, anyways, bright side of all of this is that they got the two guys, um, and the two guys who are trained in, in a fucking country that's too fucking big for us to attack at this point. They've got too many, too much shit themselves. So maybe we won't go. We won't have to spend $1 billion, you know, have more loss of life on our side and have like kill a million civilians over there trying to find fucking 35 assholes. So, um, so I guess that part of it is good then. I love that we got them and I think it's fucking hilarious that people, if there's already conspiracy theories that, that, that these aren't the two guys and it's the youtube video of the week.

Speaker 2:          00:20:21       You got to hear this fucking guy. He basically, he pieces to gather a bunch of video and cell phone pictures and he finds another guy with a backpack and, and then that's, it completely ignores, you know, they say innocent men don't run yet. They also don't kidnap people and throw grenades and shoot guns at fucking police. You know, that's not what you do. Like I being accused of something I didn't do and then he just grab a grenade Outta your fucking back pocket, you know? But this guy is absolutely convinced that from his computer, he doesn't need to go down to the sea. He doesn't need to interview anybody. He doesn't need to be anywhere near the evidence. He just needs to be on his computer looking at cell phone pictures and video and so he finds another guy with a backpack that he says matches the one that was exploded afterwards and then he goes, there it is folks.

Speaker 2:          00:21:24       He goes, how much more proof do you need? Then when he goes, he goes, smoked it folks. Game over. Just talking shit like version. I love the guy. When I have time I'm going to go back to his channel. I'm going to watch all of his fucking videos because if he's going to end every half as half-baked fucking idea was smoked it folks game over. I mean, I don't know about you guys, but that's easily four hours of entertainment in my world, you know? Anyways, so here we go. Let's get, this is the Monday morning podcast and I am your ignorant fucking host and I'll make you feel better over the next 60 minutes about your level of intellect because no matter how dumb you think you are, there's no way you're going to come off as it stupider than I am.

Speaker 2:          00:24:38       I'm all right. Before I get onto some of the other shift that I want to talk about, I'm going to read this first email that I got from somebody and it's titled Anger, not hitting. It said, dear bill, I watched two of your specials recently on Netflix while you, you are a very funny guy. Now this is when you know some criticism is coming your way. Anytime something now, you know? Yeah. I'm not saying you're not a good guy. While you are a very funny guy and most of most of the stuff is great, I really need to point out your bit about violence against women has a major flaw though. Thank you person who never did stand up. Please by all means help me fix my jokes. Uh, there's no doubt.

Speaker 2:          00:25:22       There are plenty of reasons a man could be angry with the woman, so there is a reason for that, but there really is no reason and no excuse for hitting. My ex nearly murdered me because I didn't want him to be with him anymore and told him he needed to move out of my house. I paid for entirely mine alone. I never laid a hand on him, never even thought of it. I spent a week in intensive care so you can see how I might think that you could amend that bit to say there are reasons for anger not hitting. All right. Now for those of you who aren't standup Comedians, this right here is a reoccurring email that will go on throughout your entire fucking career and this is what I find. First of all, at no point did I say anybody should hit a woman. I never said that. I said, when they say there's no reasons to hit a woman, I presented the scenario. I just said, look, there's plenty of reasons to do it. You just don't do it. That was the joke. Repeat the joke. Capital j Dash O k joke. And this is what I find about people who get offended and she was cool or whatever. Obviously, you know, um, this is what I find

Speaker 2:          00:26:46       about people who send me emails like this. All right? Obese people get offended by jokes about obesity. You know, women who've been fucking beaten by some piece of shit. Guy Get offended about the hidden women joke. All right, fuck it. I Dunno. People flight pilots get offended by my shit about talking shit about pilots. But this is what I find. Pilots never get offended by the obese material. Obese people never get offended by the hitting women thing. The dog lovers who get offended by the dog, they got adopted dog rescue dog bit. Never get offended by the starving child jokes. See what I'm saying? Well, I understand. If you don't, I'll let me try to explain it a little bit. I'm just saying this fucking lay sat through

Speaker 2:          00:27:39       two of my specials. So the first special, okay. She watches, I don't fucking talk about hitting women. So that's an hour right there. She sat through laughter, fucking tits off at a great time. And then she sits through about 40, 45 minutes to the next one and everything's fucking fine. And everything's funny and everything's just a joke is I'm just going through one topic after another that's offending the fuck out of everybody who's in that group. And then it comes around to some shit that's in her neighborhood and then all of a sudden I have to start making like a men's

Speaker 1:          00:28:09       okay

Speaker 2:          00:28:10       to bits. I need to tweak it a little bit because of her fucking personal experience. I have to tweak it because of her personal experience. And then all of a sudden what I'm saying is not a joke anymore. It's more of a statement. And I'm more, more like, you know, I mean, earlier in this podcast I advocated these terrorists go into a fucking gated community. Do you think I really want him to do that? Yeah. No I don't. I don't. But uh, just maybe light some firecrackers off underneath that limo. Just something, some sort of small payback.

Speaker 1:          00:28:42       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:28:45       How easy would it be for them to get the fucking, those gated communities, they're already driving town cars.

Speaker 1:          00:28:53       Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:28:53       Dude, if I was a banker and I was a piece of Shit Bagger, I would be so fucking paranoid that someone was going to whack me for all the misery and suffering.

Speaker 1:          00:29:04       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:29:04       That I fucking, you know, that I've been caused.

Speaker 1:          00:29:09       Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:29:09       The fact that I turned a fucking pond into my own Jacuzzi, right. I can park my yacht and my fucking Jacuzzi and I just sit there, you know, eating fucking crab legs and caviar every fucking day, standing on fucking dead babies heads. There's no fucking way I would ever get nick fucking town car. There's no way. There's no way

Speaker 2:          00:29:38       I would have whoever my Fredo of my litter of kids, whoever the Frito was. That was the be the guy that I had driven the car. Although in the godfather he was looking out for Marlin Brando and then I, he got shot. Right. So, I don't know. Fucking dumb. Anyways. Oh, you know, I read some, actually some really interesting shit about how Iceland beat the bankers when Iceland went bankrupt and in the, banker's tried to pull this shit where, yeah, we were greedy cuts and now we're putting the dead on you when your taxpayers, they said, you know what? Fuck you. This is an our debt. This is our mess. It's yours. And then all these fucking sellout costs like fucking Amsterdam and Britain put all this pressure on fucking Iceland because they pussied out with the bankers. They've been on their knees sucking that banker cock for fucking ever. They tried to fucking get them to come along. They've tried to pressure them and I, you know, or else we'll turn you into the Cuba of the north. And they said, fuck you, we're not doing it. And you know what, that's what this country should have done. This country should have told us bank or fucking cunts. I just emphasized myself that it isn't brought up more.

Speaker 2:          00:30:53       You know, it's the whole thing. Like I had water damage to my house, my insurance company sends a check that's made out to me. Uh, Nia and, and then my mortgage company and I have to sweep up the sign, the check over to them. So they keep the money. And you know why that is? Because they fucked so many people so fucking hard in the ass. So many people are upside down in houses because of the bullshit that they created by making people who aren't qualified for loans qualified. So instead of having five people bid on a house, she got 10 people bidding on it and it goes up like super bowl tickets, right? And all of a sudden a house that's really worth a buck 80 sells for two 70. So he got these concerts. Everybody's fucking upside down on the house. They're like, well fuck it, I'm keeping this money.

Speaker 2:          00:31:37       And then when they foreclosed on it, they fucking come in and they're like, fuck, they never fixed the roof. So now I have to sign over. My God, their money. It's my money. It's my insurance. That's my insurance money. I have to send it into them. You know why? Because people, it's not my house. It's their fucking house. It's theirs. All right. And if I ever paid this fucker off, what, you know I'm Gunna, I drive off. I dropped her six year old hybrid. All right. I don't give a fuck. I fucking, I dress like Malcolm young cause I'm getting these cuts on in my life and this is what's going to happen. I'm going to pay off this fucking house and you think when I die I can, I can just give it to somebody else. It's my house. Right?

Speaker 1:          00:32:20       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:32:20       If I can fucking give away all my other shit, why can't I give the house the house is going to have all taxes and all these penalties and all this bullshit, whoever I fucking leave it to is gonna make you know what? It's just going to be easier to sell it and then they sell it and whatever money they make, they get the shit tax started them. They get half a dick in their ass and then somebody else buys this thing and then the, that the bank goes deep in them for another fucking 30 years. You don't want halfway through that I realized, am I sounding crazy or am I making sense? I Dunno, I talked to a banker and a titty bar. He agreed with everything I said.

Speaker 2:          00:32:55       All right, special thanks this week to a everybody, I did a at the Tampa it, who came out to the Tampa Improv, who came out to Florida State University in Tallahassee. I'd never been there. And, uh, came out to Miami, the Fillmore, Jackie Gleason theater, um, had a great time in all cities. That was the end of the bus tour when it was just me and Versie, uh, Jason Law had, and his dad had gone home at that point. So it was just us on the bus. Um, I got gotta, I have a fucking unbelievable video of being on the bus and, uh, this fucking RV is, is just completely engulfed in flames. So that'll be a video that I'll be sending out to you guys this week if you want to check it out. Tallahassee, Florida. He played Florida state. We went over to their Ra, Bobby Bowden. We went over to the, uh, the stadium. Did I tell you that last week? I can't remember.

Speaker 1:          00:33:51       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:33:51       No, I wouldn't because that would have been on a Tuesday. Yeah. So we fucking, we, it was one of these great stadiums where

Speaker 2:          00:33:59       it, they just leave it open and then the students can go in there and run the stairs and just, you know, it's Kinda how like it used to be stadiums, even pro stadiums used to be like that. I remember a long time ago, my family was, was a vacation down to Florida and we, we, uh, we're in Tampa and somehow we ended up the original Tampa Bay Buccaneers stadiums, like the John McKay one. Right. And I just, I wanted to see it, so I got out of the car with my mother and we just walked right into the stadium and I stood on the corner of one of the end zones was just, it was wide open. I mean, what do you, what are you going to steal grass chairs? It's just a big fucking circle with, with uh, with chairs. But now I guess because they got all this other crap and there was the luxury box. People think you're gonna, I dunno. Steel what a fucking recliner. I Dunno, whatever. So Florida State University, we went there. I mean for, as he actually, we ran up the stairs once one time and um,

Speaker 2:          00:35:04       it was one of the great workouts I've ever had. Just doing it once. And of course me I have fucking OCD is like, oh, you know what, I do one for three days in a row. Then I do too when I, if I could work my way up like that, but that, but that was just my brain just starts fucking going. But, um, great crowds. They're great crowds and Tampa smoked some amazing fucking cigars and Tampa. And then we went down to the Fillmore. Um, Miami, south beach. It's south beach is so fucking beautiful with the, they have all these, like I'm a big fan of art deco and they have all these, uh, art deco style and the theater itself, um, was that art deco style crowd was amazing. Um, I'm not gonna lie to you dude. That tour I just went through through the south. I was on my fucking game. I had some of the best shows I've ever had. And, um, I think it was because it took me so long to sell tickets down in the south. Like, um, like the first place I sold tickets obviously was east coast. It's where I'm from.

Speaker 3:          00:36:06       MMM.

Speaker 2:          00:36:08       You know, I, my HBO special came out and then I got on the opiate Anthony show at the same time cause Norton was doing, I'm lucky Louie. So those two things kind of hit at the same time. And once they hit, I kind of was able to sell tickets from Boston down to like DC, which is a big O and a market. And um, then maybe to about Cleveland, but I didn't have Pittsburgh though.

Speaker 3:          00:36:35       MMM.

Speaker 2:          00:36:37       And then I think I had like San Francisco, that's what I had. And then gradually I got the middle of the country and the last one to fall was the south. I just couldn't get in down there from fucking Nashville all the way down.

Speaker 2:          00:36:53       Even a like Miami, Miami, and Miami's do the Improv. It was like, yeah, you know, white comics don't sell well down here. It's a really big Latino community. And, and they weren't lying. And I showed up, there was nobody there. So I think I was fucking excited and felt like I had something to prove. I don't know what, but it was kind of like the first show went well and uh, it was like you hit your first jump shot, you know, and then it just, it just was fucking amazing, man. Just amazing. So I really want to thank everybody who came out to all those shows. One, one thing that did bump me out though was, you know, I'm a huge Jackie Gleason fan. I used to watch is, uh, obviously watched all the honeymoon winners episode and then I used to watch is a, is a variety show, which I also loved. You know, Joe the bartender. Um, what was it? Crazy crazy. I can't remember. It's been so long. I forget it. This isn't, when I say Lou Holtz sounds like, hey yo, hey, you meet the gunny. He that guy, he sounds just like Lou Holtz. Shay, you praised freaking to you coach. Um, excuse me. Um, oh fuck me. God dammit. I swear to fucking Christ. Are you guys like me? Ah, fuck. I spill a fucking glass of water. Every god Damn Day

Speaker 2:          00:38:20       went right on my rolling stone, which I have a subscription to fucking Louis CK is on the cover. You know, this is one I'm obviously going to say knock it off fucking wet. Now you gotta go down to the new standard by another one. But you know what, that'll be good for him because they'll think, well everybody's buying it cause he's on the cover. They won't realize it's a bunch of morons spill of glasses of water on it. Uh, by the way, if you get a chance, fucking unreal article on Louie Ck fucking killer article, killer article. Um, so anyways, going back to, uh, the Jackie Gleason theater. So I performed there and then I leave and after I left, somebody goes like, yeah, how amazing is that theater? You know, I was insane. He's like, yeah, Jackie Gleason performed there and blah blah. Like I know, I know. And they go, did you see his dressing room? And I was like, what? They go yap stairs. They have his dressing room. They'd kept it pretty much like the way he had it after he was finally here. I mean, it's amazing. It's like walking back in time. And I was like, it's like, what the fuck? Why didn't you tell me? How do I know I'll ever be back there again?

Speaker 2:          00:39:30       That was the only bad part. But then it was quickly made up because Versie at the end of the show is a, he met this chef under New Hampshire, uh, Tim, Andrew Yola, and he had this, he was like, uh, I guess he has three restaurants down there, celebrity chef. Long story short, he invites us out, keeps the restaurant open, and we basically, to use firsties expression, we dined like gods. It was insane. Now forgive me, Tim, because I don't fucking remember the name of the restaurant. I and, and, and so you don't think I'm being disrespectful? I don't know. Remember the names of any restaurants. All right. Like I have, I just have nicknames for all the ones that we go to out here. One of them's called pancake circus. That's cause I walked into the first time I saw it, his giant like manholes size pancake with a bunch of fucking whipped cream on it and all I could think of was like, that looks like clown food.

Speaker 2:          00:40:31       So I don't know. I'm a moron, but I think it's Timo. But this is the thing. The first thing we go there, the first thing they bring out is crab legs. I fucking hate crab legs. I've never been into them. It's so much God. Their work to get a mouthful of fucking meat and then it just tastes like the God damn ocean. All right. I have been converted these fucking crab legs. Not only with the best crab legs I ever ate. They would some, it was some of the best food I've ever had. Even the melted butter tasted better than anybody else's melted butter. I was sitting there, I look like a fucking, I look like a toddler eating birthday cake, seven cake all over my face. It was just fucking crab legs and butter. I musta ate like fucking three or four of those legs.

Speaker 2:          00:41:19       Then he brought over pizzas. Who does pizza well in fuck outside of New York and the fucking east coast. This Guy Tim, Andrew Yola fucking pizzas. Unbelievable. Unbelievable. And then, uh, we had, uh, severe Jay. Is that how you fucking Chetan yeah. I don't know how to fucking say it. Um, on fucking believable food and the restaurant. It's spelled t I m. O. I know I'm saying it wrong cause there's a little fancy accent thing over the o team. I don't know how to say it, but it's right on the beach. All right. If you ever go down to south breach and you bring your fucking lady, then I can't say at t I m m o with the fucking, it's not the motley Crue two dots. It's one of those little accent things. Um, so thank you to Tim. His whole staff, everybody was, was insane. And we came over, they was like, it was like eight of us. Um, and you know, I swear to God, he, they, they would've still bring it bullpen, bringing out food if we didn't, if we didn't, if we didn't leave, it was one of the greatest I've ever been. Uh, treated on the road and uh, you know, yeah. I don't know. It was, it was fucking insane. Um, so,

Speaker 1:          00:42:31       okay.

Speaker 2:          00:42:32       What else? What else am I going to talk about it that I don't have any smooth transition from that to the next thing here. I've been watching a bunch of shit on, uh, on Netflix. I'm big on the, uh, I like documentaries, you know, and I watched one and a half last night before I fell asleep. I watched this thing called the queen of Versailles was she have to, you have to see, and it's basically about this guy, 75 years old, 75 years old. He married Miss Florida, 1993. So he's fucking balling. Has seven kids with her. Right. And he's got this, he sells time shares, you know, which you know, is really a shady fucking business, you know. Hey, you what? I mean, I don't, I don't know. What is it fucking time share? It's, it's, it's a, it's a fucking overpriced hotel room, isn't it?

Speaker 2:          00:43:28       I mean, I don't know. What am I buying if I spend all that money? I don't want to be laying in a bed that somebody else has been fucking in. I want a brand new bed. Okay. That's, that's deal number one because other than that, I can go lay in a bed that everybody else fucked in all year long. It's called the hotel. Right. But this guy hit, we had basically had, was the biggest time share company, um, in the world according to him. And uh, and he was in the middle of building the biggest house in America and it had 10 kitchens. This fucking nine people in their family. They have one more kitchen. Then they have people in their family. All right. You have to watch just to see them. I mean, it's not finished yet because in 2008, they got caught up on all the bankers shit. And um, but you just have to see when his wife walks in with their friend and when they walk up these stairs, I'm telling you, these fucking stairs are, are wider than the stairs at grand central in New York City.

Speaker 2:          00:44:35       They go upstairs and they'll fucking friend of miss. Miss 1993 Florida goes is like, you know, cause they haven't like put the walls up. It's just the uh, the framing of it. She goes, oh my God. She goes, is that your bedroom? And she goes, no, it's my closet. It's fine. But if you really want us, okay, now a lot of people will watch the queen of Versailles and go look at these two selfish fucking people in all the waste and all that apps. A fucking loofy lutely that's on the fucking surface bond underneath all of it. You, you see a guy who doesn't want to declare bankruptcy and put that money on the American people and wants to fight his way out of it. And the bankers won't do it. Like he had a building out in fucking Vegas. He put 350 million of his own fucking money in and now we can't make the payments. So he wants to bankers to try and, you know, give him some of the bailout money and they kept all of it because this is the thing, if he fucking, if they get him to default on that, they get to keep his 350 million and sell the fucking building all over again.

Speaker 3:          00:45:41       MMM.

Speaker 2:          00:45:43       You know, and obviously this guy, he got over extended, he made the mistake of not realizing,

Speaker 3:          00:45:49       you know,

Speaker 2:          00:45:52       what bankers are and what it is that they do. They're not your friends. They're not trying to help you grow your fucking business. They're trying to make every fucking dime off you is they can. And when it's over, you're bus the joint out. I just started thinking about the, the fucking, uh, good fellas when they start burning it down, but rather than burning the place down, they fucking did you that Ray Liotta and fucking Joe Pesci a fucking tie in those little candle things to you. Trying to bang his fucking Jew brought over here. You can't help me out. So well coming to, um, and then you burn to the ground and that's it. But the building's still standing and then they get some other group to go in there and then they fucked them in the ass. I'm telling you.

Speaker 3:          00:46:38       Yeah,

Speaker 2:          00:46:39       we should all as civilians, you remember the ending of Scarface when they were coming over the wall. That's what we should be doing right now in gated communities, going to bankers, fucking houses. We should be dragging him, dragging them out by the tassels of their fucking wing tips. Um, all right. Anyways, so I watched that phenomenal. And it was sad. It was also sad because you saw a guy that was really into his business. But granted, I think also, you know, you have to find a through line when you're filming something. Cause I think they initially started the documentary, Eh, I think it was an issue was going to be, look how successful this guy is. And then that shit happened and then it turned into something else. So I heard he sued the makers of the documentary. But a phenomenal and the music is, is incredible. Um, all right. And then I watched another one about the serial killer, Carl Pans, Ram, the spirit of hatred and vengeance. You got to fucking see this.

Speaker 3:          00:47:39       MMM.

Speaker 2:          00:47:39       He, he writes this guard befriends him and he writes a fucking book in jail.

Speaker 2:          00:47:47       And, uh, I forget how off I fuck it. I Ha I had it in my head. How he said it. They have the voiceover actor. Good. My name is Carl pay his rent and they've killed over 22 people and committed over a thousand acts of sodomy. How his book starts. I got to buy the fucking book. Um, let me, let me look this up. I'll read, I'll read you a little bit about this guy and Wikipedia for some reason, like, you know, a bunch of other people. Ted Bundy, speaking of Florida state, Dude, you know what? Florida state where Ted Bundy killed those three sorority girls. Um, they still use that house is a sorority house that should fucking blew me away. Fucking blew me away. Like how, how, how in God's name. Now I'm not into ghosts. I don't believe in that shit. But, uh, I, I do draw a line. I don't think that I, I could sleep in that fucking house knowing that all that shit like happened. All right, here we go. Let's just re Carl Pants rim here. Um, it wasn't American serial killer, rapists, arsonists and burglar.

Speaker 3:          00:49:00       MMM.

He'd fucking sodomized them and then shoot him in the head and throw him overboard. One of those evil fucking things. That was basically, that happened when he was a kid. He got fucking raped. And then he was like, all right, well, I'm fucking rape. And everybody else. I mean, the guy was just fucking, yeah. Let me look up some quotes. I don't want a creepy guys out. This would be turned into a creepy podcast, but I just never heard of this guy.

I'm a 30 year old man and have a bit of a problem over the past few years, I've become addicted to horse, not just typical bar sluts, but full blown professionals. So GJ um, it's gotten so bad that I researched the girls that I see in the majority of my time consists of going through message boards and underground communities filled with other pervs like myself who review working girls. All right, dude, you're going down a dark fucking hole. I fortunately never went down.

Speaker 3:          00:55:18       Uh,

Speaker 2:          00:55:21       I'm already in over my head here, but you know, whatever you wrote it. So I'm going to fucking try and answer it knowing full well that I am not a professional sir. Um, he says, my problem is that I have become so addicted to this lifestyle that I cannot see myself having a traditional relationship with the woman. Yeah, absolutely. Absolutely. You Open Pandora's box. You know, dude, you're, you're, you have a woman who will do whatever you want and you don't have to be emotionally there for, you don't have to wipe your feet off. You could just, you know, talk to wherever you want. Give her some money and then she leaves. You don't even have to cuddle. You have zero emotional responsibility.

Speaker 2:          00:56:07       You know, that's like somebody rich who's been fucking flying around in their own jet and then all of a sudden, you know, this shit goes down like, and that, that queen of Versailles and all of a sudden they have to get on a commercial flight and that kids are looking around. God, why are all these people on a plane? You're in the same place. Your Dick is like a billionaire, you know, and if you get door fucking relationship, but that this point, that's like the 2008 collapse, you know? Does that make any sense? All right. After experiencing this lifestyle for so long, I just cannot force myself to sit at a bar trying to convince some chick who's best years are behind her to give me a halfhearted. Bj, um, I consider myself a decent looking guy. I think you consider yourself a lot more than that, sir.

Speaker 2:          00:56:52       I think you stand in front of the mirror with your hands on your sides. Like Superman, not hands on your hips, hands on your hips, that's a feminine. But if you stand there with your two fists like that, then all of a sudden you look like you should have a Cape flapping behind Ya. Um, I think you do that, you stand there and you're naked, you know, with like the same distance between your feet that a state trooper has when it comes up going dude, how fast you were going, and then you look to the side with your Dick flap, but it in the wing because of the oscillating fan. Yeah. Then you'd every morning,

Speaker 4:          00:57:26       God, I am not sure.

Speaker 2:          00:57:30       Uh, that's how I think you feel about yourself. That I would just guess. Um, anyways, I think I'm a decent looking guy and I do get attention from the women, but I often find that they are not worth the effort because I get bored so quickly. Yeah. I know actually having to converse rather than just being like, hey, how much for you to suck my Dick? Oh yeah, I'll give you a half that good. My work with me meet. I'll meet you in the middle. I'll give you an extra five cause it's cold out. All right, get in the car. Um, my problem is that I get bored with women immediately after I sleep with them. I do not fear diseases as I always use condoms though. That's not 100% by the way. I don't know why, but it is. I don't know how you can have a raincoat on your Dick and still get herpes I think cause your balls are fucking hanging out of the back of the chopper, you know, and safety.

Speaker 2:          00:58:22       I always use condoms and safety and safety wise, I love when you guys like rewrite your, your fucking emails and then you delete half a sentence and then you fucking don't notice and then you put it in here and you make me look even dumber than I am anyway. So I guess he uses condoms. He said it would be Doobie just as dangerous sleeping with a random bar slut who doesn't force their partners to use condoms? Uh, no it wasn't sir. No it wouldn't because it's a numbers thing. Alright. Some bar slut who doesn't use condoms versus some woman who fucks professionally. Okay. That's like you throwing the football around in the back yard saying you just like Tom Brady. Okay. Did, it's not the same thing, but I know you're saying that to make yourself feel better, feel better. He said, I fear never being able to have a normal relationship with a woman down the road. I feel like my internal wiring got crossed somewhere and I need a wide variety of women to keep me sane. I really want to fuck every woman I see. But unfortunately I can cannot a golf club, so I got to pay for it anyway. Out of this love the podcast. Yeah. I you need to go to therapy.

Speaker 2:          00:59:30       Um,

Speaker 3:          00:59:32       okay.

Speaker 2:          00:59:33       I gotta tell you though, once you, once you, I dunno. Yeah. You, you need, you need to go seek professional help, sir. I would, I would. I would say that because, uh, you've gone down a road for so long and you keep coming around the track the same way you've worn this grooving and it's very hard to get out of. And, uh, you have to sit down and want to do the work and you, you have to work with professional and figure out if you have a sex addiction addiction or whatever. One of the doctor drew, you know, if they can't afford it, I would call doctor drew. But even then, he's only going to talk to you for a minute to have him guide you in the right direction though. Uh, because that guy is, is he kind of keep gets right to it. I've done a show a couple of times, he's fucking unreal. Um, so that would be my suggestion. I would say at first and foremost, stop fucking prostitutes because you are going to catch something and every, and not only that, every, every one that you bang or have blow you or whatever, it's just another step further down a direction you don't want to go. And then also, it's a terrible thing to do,

Speaker 2:          01:00:42       you know, to solicit a prostitute. You're basically, you know, something horrible happened to her and then you take an advantage of it. It's fucking horrific. Um, so they, you go, I hope I helped you. I know I gave you a lot of shit throughout that, but I hope it helps you out because that is a serious problem. Okay. House Derris Billy boy, keeping it short and sweet duty. Your undying hatred for reading out loud. I actually don't mind it. I just, I hate sounding stupid. Uh, my fiance and I are moving into our first house on Friday. Any last minute advice? Yes. Um, well, it's too late. You already bought a fucking house. My first thing would be drive less of a car, wear less clothes, everything less and start knocking out the principal. All right. You got to start knocking that fucking thing down.

Speaker 3:          01:01:41       MMM.

Speaker 2:          01:01:42       And when they, then once you knock it down to a certain point, then they're going to come at you and be like, Hey, do you want to refinance? You want to refinance? Look, your mortgage payment will go from 1500 down to 1200 dental. Save you 300 bucks a month. That's all a fucking scam.

Speaker 3:          01:01:56       Okay.

Speaker 2:          01:01:58       You really think there's somebody who works at the bank and his job and he's sitting there going, how can this bank make less money? Oh, I know what I mean. How long would that guy worked there before we get fired? It's a scam because what happens is if you like four or five years into your mortgage, they're going to refinance it and your payment doesn't go down 300 bucks and you're still five years in, it starts back at zero. All right? Now you have that payment for 30 years and you're starting all fucking over again. So the 300 bucks that you're saving each month, they make it more in the fucking interest in the long run because they sent you back to square one. It's all a fucking scam of telling you, go to the gate communities and go over the fucking wall. Um, don't really do that. All right? I don't want to be held responsible for that. Um, these are all jokes. Wink, wink, nudge, nudge. Um, all right. Any other advice? Yeah,

Speaker 1:          01:02:51       yeah.

Speaker 2:          01:02:52       Don't let you fucking lady. Let, let your woman have the fucking dining room. Let her have the fucking, uh, living room. All right? But you, you have to stake your fucking claim in there.

Speaker 1:          01:03:07       Okay?

Speaker 2:          01:03:07       Don't let her turn it into a fucking doll house the same way she wouldn't want to be living right in some fucking, you know, House that looks like a sports bar, you know, and you got some fucking deer head in a keg on tap and all that shit. You know what I mean? But just like I would say steak, you're fucking claim in the house and just say, listen, I want this house to be a representative represent presentation of both of us. All right?

Speaker 1:          01:03:35       Okay.

Speaker 2:          01:03:36       And uh, if it goes too far one way or the other, I don't think the other person is going to be happy and just say, listen, I don't care what you do with this. I don't care what you do with this room. Just pick yourself a rumor to cause this sort of unwritten rule is that the guy gets one room and it's the darkest kv just fucking place. It's the basement. It's the fucking garage and a, it's bullshit. It's bullshit. Okay.

Speaker 2:          01:04:03       So that's what I would say. Make sure that when people walk in, they can immediately see that you live there too. That's something with a set of balls is actually in that fucking house. All right. And that's it. Good luck with your marriage then. Your new house. Congratulations. Pay Down the fucking principal, sir. Get the shackles off Ya. All right. Crazy ass mom. Hey Bill. What's up? My name is Hector. I'm from, I'm a full time college student. My life is fairly well. I get good grades and shit. Big family. One, a seven boy refinance with some new put. Uh, start it back to square one. Uh, when was that? When I was little, she was basically trying to steal me from my father and taking all of his money in the process. Hell hath no fury, sir. Also, she used to beat me like a red headed stepchild. I find that offensive.

Speaker 1:          01:04:59       Okay.

Speaker 2:          01:04:59       All right. You want my advice? Stone itself. Me?

Speaker 1:          01:05:02       Yeah.

Speaker 2:          01:05:02       All right, Hector, you don't what? I always got childish. It made, uh, made some joke about your change steering wheel because you name is Hector. But then I realized that that would insult other Mexicans and I'm not like you sir. I'm gonna, I'm gonna, I'm take the high road here.

Speaker 2:          01:05:19       It just say that I wish you would've chosen your words a little more carefully. All right. And, uh, tell me. Okay. Bb like a redheaded stepchild and tell him, tell me. My Dad did not love me, so I would stop asking for him. Wow. Yeah. That's, um, that's something that parents do during divorce on both sides. They use the kids. That's, I'm so glad that never happened to me and I got fucked up in other ways. Uh, this fucker left. My father was so little money that he had no money to pay the light bill and other shit. My Mom's stupid ass brother held a gun up to my father's head and said he would blow his head off because he got my mom pregnant with me. My Mother's dad was also, um, an ultra can't. Yeah. So he was familiar with, constantly went out and married it. Hopefully he fucking corrected the problem. Cheeses. You giving me the whole family tree here, sir. Um, since then she had gotten remarried and then divorced a fucking gun. He says the problem is after all that shit, I can't stand even look at my mom. How do I tell her to basically fuck off this fucking podcast is the fucking shit. Don't stop you redheaded maniac. All right. There. He made it up with something positive towards redheads. Thanks for your important. No. Yeah, go fuck yourself. Um,

Speaker 2:          01:06:45       no, this is very touchy because you know, as much as you consider your biological mother, your mother, this is your mother. So, um, I don't know how that works because I've never been in this situation, so I wouldn't tell you.

Speaker 1:          01:06:58       Okay.

Speaker 2:          01:06:59       Your first mother to fuck off.

Speaker 1:          01:07:01       Yeah.

Speaker 2:          01:07:02       What I would do is I would have, um,

Speaker 1:          01:07:08       yeah,

Speaker 2:          01:07:09       she is your mom. So I would, I would have a, just a very controlled relationship with her. Like I would meet her at restaurants, I'd meet her in public and have lunch with, be okay. Got To get on with my week and that way, you know, that way itself, when she dies some day, you don't have this regret that, uh, you know, I hated my own mother. What does it mean? Um, and then I would just do happy mom shit with, with your non biological mother, you know, just smile and wave, go through the motions with there. But, um,

Speaker 2:          01:07:41       I dunno, I'd say I'd say maybe therapy call you call your mom a cunt in therapy rather than to her face. Cause it's, it's not going to get you anywhere. And as you get older and she gets older, it's just, it's not going to be a good fucking thing. But I totally have empathy for the situation that you're in. I would just treat my biological mother as my real mother and I would have a respectful relationship with my, uh, my original mother. And, uh, when she started talking crazy and everything, just be like, listen, you know, you said that stuff to me when I was a kid. It caused a lot damage to me and, um, I don't want to hear your trash, my dad anymore. Uh, I respect how you feel about him, but I don't want to hear about it because you have to understand that that's my father. All right? And if she has a problem with that, you just go check please.

Speaker 1:          01:08:30       Yeah.

Speaker 2:          01:08:31       Now you go, she wants to make a scene and throw some bread or route, then a, then you got to be like, listen, you know I can't, I can't hang out with you. You're crazy. Trashing my dad. You're throwing appetizers around the road. Okay. I will have dinner with you again when you can show to me that you can act like an adult. Maybe you can just lay the ground rules. This is how it's going to be. We are meeting at restaurants and you going to behave like an adult and you are not going to trash my father. Okay? We're going to sit here. We're going to talk about the weather and what's going on in our lives right now. We're not talking about the past anymore. That's, that's what I need from you. If you can't give me that, then I'm not going to the olive garden.

Speaker 1:          01:09:13       Okay?

Speaker 2:          01:09:14       There you go. Sir. I hope that works for you. All right, relationship advice? I'm pregnant. Oh, okay. Hey, Mister Bill. I'm a 21 year old pregnant girl who lives in Shit town, Illinois. I moved here a little over a year ago to be with my boyfriend who I met on match.com

Speaker 2:          01:09:35       this is your prints. You meet him on match.match.com led you to shit town, Illinois. There's a fucking one for everybody. Do not go on match.com those stupid commercials. They show everybody happy. Everybody playing Frisbee women jumping into guys arms. Zani you see some 20 year old girl got knocked up by some cut and fucking Shit Town Illinois? I don't think so. Hey Sweetheart, you know what? You're already a great person because you'll let us know what happens@match.com. Um, everything was great at first that I realized how much I fucking hate this place. This town is such a cunt and that includes the people in it. I've been telling him that and I'm unhappy for at least six months, but he doesn't seem to care. Oh, see, you don't really have a problem with him. Yeah. Great. Now I have a slander case with fucking match.com he said, now I'm pregnant with his child and have the opportunity to move to Arizona to be with my parents.

Speaker 2:          01:10:29       I told them that I'm going to go, but he said that he would absolutely, absolutely would not follow me there. He said he loves this place because it has a lot of outdoor activities and he loves his job. This is not as hometown. He makes $9 an hour being a bicycle mechanic. I told them there are bike shops all around the country and he can find another fucking job, especially since he is former military. He doesn't care. He's a stubborn ass. What the fuck do I do? This place has turned me into a depressed bitch and I hate myself for it and I don't want to bring the baby into that kind of whirl. Hopefully you can shed some wisdom on this for me. I Dunno. This is a rough one. So you're basically going to move to where you want to live and then he's going to become you. That's what worried about, um, do you have some sort of job opportunities in Arizona?

Speaker 3:          01:11:23       MMM.

Speaker 2:          01:11:25       Cause you know, along with having bike shops all around the country, they also have outdoors.

Speaker 1:          01:11:31       Yeah.

Speaker 2:          01:11:31       You can go outdoors anywhere in the country. That's one of the greatest things about the United States and Russia. They can't go outdoors wherever they go. You know, you could send to Siberia and shit. You are a fucking indoors.

Speaker 3:          01:11:42       All right?

Speaker 2:          01:11:46       Getting fucking raped in the ass and all you can feel is somebody mittens on your hips.

Speaker 3:          01:11:56       Oh,

Speaker 2:          01:11:57       that's one of the fucking most evil jokes I've ever made.

Speaker 3:          01:12:00       MMM.

Speaker 2:          01:12:03       All right. What am I talking about? What do you do? A sweetheart? I don't know.

Speaker 1:          01:12:08       Okay.

Speaker 2:          01:12:09       If the guy's fucking that level of stubborn, I, I honestly, you know what I, you stumped me. I know you're fucking punching your fucking iPod right now. What have you listened to the song? What do you what? All right, what would I do if I was a pregnant lady?

Speaker 3:          01:12:28       MMM.

Speaker 2:          01:12:29       Well, here's the question. How do you feel about this guy? Do you love this guy? He's just the guy you're going to marry.

Speaker 3:          01:12:36       MMM.

Speaker 2:          01:12:39       If that's the deal, then I don't know you. You got to try and work something out because you guys are together and you got to do, you've got to try and do what's best for the kid. But if this guy isn't the guy that I don't know what to tell you that I read, I think he's some great advice. Don't get fucking pregnant by your boyfriend at 21 I mean, I don't, I don't want to tell you here you really, you know what? You really painted yourself into a corner. I think what you have to do is you have to, you gotta man up and make a decision here.

Speaker 1:          01:13:13       Okay?

Speaker 2:          01:13:13       You have to make a decision what's best for your baby because now you're in this situation. I know a baby needs a mom and a dad, but if you guys don't really love each other, whether you live in Arizona, he live in Illinois, it's eventually gonna fucking blow up.

Speaker 1:          01:13:28       Okay.

Speaker 2:          01:13:29       So I would just at this point you're having a baby. So your needs are out the window. It's gotta be about the kid. But you did mention in there, so I guess took me a second to try to figure this one out. I guess if I was in your situation I would do what was best for the baby.

Speaker 1:          01:13:44       Okay.

Speaker 2:          01:13:44       So whatever that answer is, I would go with that. All right. But I don't think that that's just a, uh, a one sided talk. Like you really have to sit down with, uh, with your boyfriend there and try and together figure out what's best for the kid.

Speaker 1:          01:14:02       Okay.

Speaker 2:          01:14:02       And then I would do that. Alrighty. I hope that helped you out. All right, this is a long podcast today. Um, is this the last? This is the one. All right. Hang in there everybody advice for a big presentation. I bill, I saw your special on Netflix and I left my face off a few days later. I started a new job at the sort of place where my coworkers don't really speak to each other during work hours. You can hear the wiring, the gear of the worrying of the fan overhead and desk drawers being open and shut Jesus Christ. So thank Christ for your podcast. What a relief. Thank you for making my day. All right. I'm presenting at Ted at a Ted x event. Is that like ted.com or all those eggheads talk about robots and scuba diving in like a wheelchair. Um, and I'm wondering what sort of tips you might have for speaking to large crowds.

Speaker 2:          01:14:50       Try to make them laugh off the top or save it until I'm further into the speech or, or what you've poked fun about bringing a joke full circle at the end of the set. Is that lame? I do this where whenever I write something I can't read it once it's published because it all sounds so cheesy to me. Oh, if you write it down because you're in your head. Okay, I see what you mean. He says like, I ended up hating what I just put out there. I just want to cringe every time I think about my speech, you know? What do you think? Ah, I think you have the classic mentality of the performer. You want to be in front of everybody, you have self hatred and you want the crowd to clap and be like, no, but seriously, you're a good guy.

Speaker 3:          01:15:33       MMM.

Speaker 2:          01:15:35       I would say this. Um,

Speaker 2:          01:15:39       just talk to them like you're talking to your buddies in a bar. That's what I would do. I would just, if, if you don't like what you wrote down, what I would do is I would have talking points in front of me like I'm starting with this point and then talk off the top of your head. If you're good at this, by the way, all right. Now this is one of your first times doing this. You're going to be a little nervous. It might be good to have something a little more prepared, but if you're good at, you know, talking in front of people, I would just have bullet points. You know, like I'm going to talk about how I ended up in a wheelchair. I'm going to talk about how I used to love the ocean and then I'm going to talk about having all of that taken away from me.

Speaker 2:          01:16:17       And then I'm going to talk about the apparatus and then I'm in the ocean. Then I'm going to show him the pictures and then going to get all teared up. And then I'm going to wheel myself off while with one hand while waving. But then I'll be in a circle and then realize that I'm doing a circular waving thing in my chair and then I'll just sort of back up off the stage. You know, that's just one example. But um, I think you know what the good thing is your competition isn't that stiff. There's going to be a bunch of monotone jackasses. I'm just sitting there going, Bruker, Naren, Cary Sherburne duty for fuel and Yorkton injury or injury. You're going to, you know, you're gonna have to go on after that. So it might not be that difficult. So that's basically what I would do.
