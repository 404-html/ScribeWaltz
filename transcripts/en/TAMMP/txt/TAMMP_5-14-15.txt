Speaker 1:          00:00          Hey, what's going on? Why you're just checking in on you. I can't go up that. Hi everybody. I am 10 shows in to my epic 19 show run at the Wilbur Theater in Boston, Massachusetts. And I got to tell you, I'm a little bit, I got 10 down, nine to go and I gotta tell you this was a stupid idea. Should have played a venue a little bigger. Um, all the shows have been going great. Um, but I've been doing all right. I've been taking a steam every fucking day. Little Eucalyptus spray. I'll be able to tough my way through this shit, man. Um, that's the extent of how difficult my job is. I think my voice was, I think my instrument will hold up. You know, you have all your other people doing the fucking back breaking jobs right now. You're not how many backbreaking jobs or even left in this country, isn't it?

Speaker 1:          00:53          All infrastructure other than ups. People will unload or load and unload ups, trucks, construction. What else is a difficult job? Uh, early on in your relationship and your girlfriend as a fucking birthday coming up? That's a difficult job, dude. What do I get? Or, you know what I mean? It's like I don't love it, but I still want to fuck her. Right? What kind of gift is that, dude? You know, what should I do? Should I get her a blouse? Should I take it as a box gift certificate? Uh, my accent's going to be coming back really strong. Jesus Christ, I met this guy last night in so many people think the Boston accent. It's just that practicality in the habit. Yet they met, they miss all the law part of it. This fucking game. Gramar George, you've got to do your job. Draw up Jay Jay, WB guys comes walking.

Speaker 1:          01:49          You need, he's not doing his fucking job job. There it is. I can job job, you know? So anyways, I got to tell you, you know, I was fucking rag in the last two podcasts about Tom Brady and I gotta be honest, man. What a difference a couple of days makes. This is all gradually just going to blow over with real sports fans. People who just straight up hate the patriots will fucking, now they're saying Aaron Rodgers likes his ball a little over inflated. Minnesota heats up the footballs and Tom Brady, let's a little bit out the end of the day. You still gotta throw the fucking thing right? It's fucking idiot saying he's cheating. Is that all you have to do to make it in the NFL is a little, a little bit of air out and all of a sudden the ball goes exactly where you want it to be. It's so fucking dumb.

Speaker 1:          02:36          But I'm, I'm looking for the Patriots to, um, you know, Brady's already hired a lawyer. They're going to go at this fucking thing. I think we're sick of uh, uh, the teams in the League fucking doing all this country shit too is trying to make it look like we're a bunch of cheaters when we're not. We're just kicking your fucking asses and why don't you grow up? Why don't you take your fucking skirt off and just play the fucking game and quit looking under every goddamned jock strap. Cause we can do the same thing to you or write you a bunch of pussies. Sorry, I'm really just talking about the jets. I'm talking about the cults and I'm talking about every other sports park content out there. I love to how everybody acts. Like they've never been guilty of any sort of gamesmanship looking for a fucking edge. Right. You're never took a test and kind of glanced over at the smart chicks fucking paper over there. Right. A little gamesmanship.

Speaker 2:          03:27          Okay.

Speaker 1:          03:27          Um, whatever. Uh, I'm actually in a great sport, smooth at this point because I've realized at this point that, uh, I think good Dale, after all, he went through last year with the ray rice thing I'm with under suspending somebody now. He's like a fucking like a baby poisonous snake. Just unleashing all the venom when he doesn't need to do that, you know? Um, I guess it's within every team's right. If they want to fucking, I mean, I dunno, I look at it like when they said George Brett had too much fucking pine tar on his bat. Oh really? Is that why you hit the fucking home run to win the game really? Because he had too much, too much sticky stuff, so he got a better grip on it. That little bit of extra sticky stuff, you know, if you never hit a home run and a major league ballpark, I don't know if you know this, all you have to do is put a little pine tar a little bit beyond the label on the bat and you'll be, the thing's going to be jumping right off the bat. It's crazy, man. I don't know why McGuire and those guys, you know, poisoned their bodies with all the steroids. All they needed was just a little bit of sticky stuff on that bat and then forget it.

Speaker 1:          04:29          So anyways, in other sporting news, all Canadians, you fucking lost again. I'm just giving I, I would, I shouldn't be rubbing in it. What the fuck am I to say? My team didn't even make the playoffs, but our congratulations to the Tampa Bay lightning and Canadian fans as much as I give you shit. Fuck it. I'm not, I, you know, I want it. Am I going to do? You guys got fucking 97 cups. You know, granted both of them were one. When your team was the team plane was like a biplane.

Speaker 1:          05:01          You don't know or understand about Canadian fans. I always give you shit about how long ago you won the cup and there was only six teams in the league. Why don't you guys ever say back to me? Yeah. And the Bruins for one of them. So why didn't you guys win 20 cups? A bunch of people in French just said, we exactly. Um, let's see here. So I am, um, 10 shows in 10 shows. And by the way, the curse of Patrick Wall continues the solemn saying, tell him saying, and now I've got to congratulate New York City. Well, congratulations to the New York fucking ranges. I actually hate to admit this, but I actually, I actually liked the ranges, um, because I remember when they want it, 94 that uses like this. That's to me, that was the greatest year in hockey ever saw. Um, Mark [inaudible] we will win, you know, breaking a fucking 50 [inaudible] 54 year curse.

Speaker 1:          05:53          I'm an original six team. It was great, man. It was awesome. And also at that point, the red sox hadn't won the world series yet. So I remember watching that going like, wow, maybe that's what that's gonna feel like when we finally beat a beat, somebody to win a world series. So, um, God dammit, Washington capitol fans. I mean, what did you do? You know, you know, we'd be a great fucking sports show if you had like Washington capitols and like San Diego charger fans sit down, right? And just talking about all the shit that they've been through. Right. And then in the end, you know, Jason Law had, comes in crying worse than anybody as a Cleveland Fan. Um, and then a cubs fan walks in with his horn rimmed glasses asking why? Asking why anybody really gives a fuck. As long as you take your shirt off and have a good time, who cares?

Speaker 1:          06:42          Right? Who gives a fuck? Fucking red sox won. Oh, I'm back in p town. I'm cage. People end up with the sports. They're red sox one, two to nothing. It gets, the A's actually won the series. I fucking miss it back here man. I really do. Sitting there talking to my wife about it going, what the fuck are we living out there? And a God damn state that has no water. You know what I mean? Coming back here, lush land, bunch of trees, lakes, you know, I really miss my home town. I fucking love it back here and I'm trying to see like what I go fucking nuts if I moved back here. I mean kind of be difficult to still be in this business, you know, to get acting work. We're not be based here, but uh, I don't know. I got to admit, I got to admit it turned me on little good fellas reference for you there.

Speaker 1:          07:30          Um, so anyways, uh, I got to try to conserve my voice. I don't even know what the fuck I'm going to talk about. This is how out of it I am. Last night it came home. I fucking come home late at night as always. Oh, me and Rosie one night. Jesus Christ. Jesus Christ. Dude, we fucking stayed out till like five in the morning. I was driving home and the sun was coming up, was sitting here like, what am I doing? We ended up, uh, we finished our shows and then these guys will say saying, Hey, you know, you got to come to our dive bar, a dive bar around the corner. And we're like, Whoa, we got a couple of cigars. I know, I know. I said I was quitting, but whatever. Um, we've got a couple of cigars and I wanted to fucking needed a place where we could smoke them, right? So he goes, yeah, yeah, you know, come on over, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. I'll probably get this guarantee. I don't want to get this. Get in trouble. And then we went outside and we smoked him in the alley.

Speaker 1:          08:24          I want to thank everybody at a bitty earlies flatten a smoke legally outside in the alley. It's not even an alley. They were outside on the sidewalk. So when he was be fucking ended up going there and um, these guys, fucking hilarious guys is off duty. Cop is off duty firemen and they just walked. They were already, you know, fucking four hours into drinking at least, you know, and we just come walking in stone sober and I had me and [inaudible] a little hammered, then we would've started telling stories, but instead we just listened to the show.

Speaker 2:          09:00          And, uh,

Speaker 1:          09:02          this fucking guy, man, I swear to God, he's telling this story and he's going like, all right, you're not going to. But he's like, fucking like leaning in on us. He's gone. You know, I got fucking, I got fucking two kids, right? I gotta, I got a son and a daughter by two different women. I know. I'm fucked up. My life is fucked. I know. So anyways, my daughter, she's like fucking 10 years old and she starts asking me about the birds and the bees. I'm like, what the fuck? I mean, I don't even know what to say. So I just start, I, I freak out. So I, I emailed my ex wife, you know, cause I can't call her because of the restraining order. And then he makes this face that looks up in the air, like whatever that is.

Speaker 1:          09:49          And then he fucking goes, I fucking end up telling, I don't even know what I said to her. I was like, you know a man, a man's penis gets erect in it, goes inside and it fertilizes I dude, I fucking blacked out. I came to like fucking 20 minutes later and she's staring at me and my daughter and then my new girlfriend's looking at me like, dude, what the fuck did you say?

I got the FBI over here. The fucking CIA is behind me. I got my gun on his fucking dude, right? I got it on him. The FBI is in the other room, fucking dude. He started the story like 15 times to the point. I finally go, Hey, what side is the FBI on? And he doesn't miss it. Be the FBI is in the other room is CIA is behind me. It's like, dude, just get to it. And then the fucking fireman guy goes and Yada, Yada Yada. You didn't fucking shoot them your bunch of pussies.

Speaker 1:          10:52          So those of you haven't been keeping up on the, um, on the whole, uh, that whole story there with the Boston marathon bomber, like he's on trial right now and uh, I'm listening on the radio was listening to one of those NPR things in there talking about how, uh, you know, the big question is, you know, when they convict this guy, does he get life in prison or the Dia fucking kill them and you know, I think it's a no brainer. You take them out,

Speaker 1:          11:27          It's over. You know what I mean? They're trying to pull that shit. You know, he was really influenced by his brother. Yeah. You know, I was influenced by my older brother, but you know, if the second he starts going, hey, let's stick a fucking bomb in a mailbox.

Speaker 2:          11:39          Okay

Speaker 1:          11:40          next to innocent people, children, you know, at that point I'm like, hey, all the brother, you know, I think you kind of going down a road. I don't want to be on it.

Speaker 2:          11:47          MMM.

Speaker 1:          11:49          I Dunno. Yeah, I think you put them, you put them down and he put them down like a rabid dog. Am I out of my mind? I like when they go like we don't come from a country that's an eye for an eye. They'll fuck. We don't what fucking history book are you reading? What apple when they scalped a couple of us. Jesus Christ, we committed genocide. Can't take our one fucking bomber. Come on. All right, this has been conservative bill coming at you here on the podcast. Um, so anyways, for those of you guys who are new to this podcast, I do this podcast every fucking Thursday ride where people just, you know, I just check in on you. That's all. I see how your week's going. You know, I worry about you guys. I worry about you guys just got my head busted at this fucking place.

Speaker 1:          12:34          I haven't gone to since I was a kid. You know, we just call it the hack shop. I'm not going to say the name of it, but that's what we used to call it. It's fucking guy go in there. He's like fucking, you know, there's the guy that's kind of old and then there's the guy that's really old. So I'm going, you know, and they're both finishing a haircut. So I'm like, come on. Almost old. Come on kind of. Oh, maybe really old won't gave him an, of course really old finishes first we get there, right. He's fucking funny as hell. And I could just tell the whole fucking thing's uneven. So I had to try to fix it when I got home, you know what I mean? And he goes, we can, we need to say, hey, it got to give the state troopers.

Speaker 1:          13:10          Um, all right. So anyways, um, let's get to the, uh, the hashtags here. Shit that you guys want me to talk about. I got home so late last night. I actually looked for some reason you don't want just an old news stories pops in. I started looking, I remember Shondra is Shandra Levy, remember that? And there was that politician and they were about ready to fucking maybe make a case on them. And then nine 11 happened. He never fucking heard about it again. I always wondered about that. Okay. The Thursday afternoon, m m p for those, uh, you people, you people that want to fucking email in. It's uh, for Thursdays it's a Hashtag t a m. M. P. All right. I know this one sucks so far. I'm going to try to turn it around here. All right. Aye. You got to talk about dad bods. Oh yeah.

Speaker 1:          14:02          That was Michael Rappaport. I am Rapaport podcasts where he's talking about dead bodies. I'm not a dad and I already have that body. That fucking kills me. It really kills me. Um, isn't an awful how in shape you can look in with the shirt on fucking unreal. Every time I'm thinking I'm looking. All right. You know, you catch that sideways view of you in the marriage. It's a fucking absolute shit show. It's so fucking depressing. Um, anyways, report show the NFL may listen to podcast. Brady suspension could be overturned. It better be overturned. You know what? I think all patriots fans should do, every Patriot fan should go watch that fed fucking documentary on Scientology and rather than judging Scientology, you know, he should really, we'll look at it and be like, well, you could really make that documentary about any religion, every religion, if the core is a giant fucking guests.

Speaker 1:          14:54          Right. But the greatest thing about getting clear is Scientology wanted to be recognized as a religion and then get that tax break. And the IRS is like, no, you guys are a cult gimme a break. You know, you're talking about space ships. We don't believe in that stuff, so fuck you guys. And they basically sued them. They had like 2,500 2,700 of their members individually filed a lawsuit against the IRS. Never been defeated. The fucking Mayweather, right. The Rocky Marciano of, uh, I, I don't even think they are a government agency, are they? Aren't. They worked for the Federal Reserve, which is a private group of people that don't, that print the money. I don't fucking know. All I know is the shit I over here and buys. So they defeated them. 2,700 individual lawsuits from one group defeated the fucking IRS. So they go, I say, if they don't overturn this fucking Tom Brady suspension, I am going to fucking rally every Patriot fan I know to sue the NFL.

Speaker 1:          16:00          Alright, for emotional damage done for you guys. Lion, our bod, our quarterback who looks like a fucking astronaut. Okay, we'll fucking smell fucking show you when. That'd be great. Just fucking overturn it. Then we'd be called a bunch of cry and whine and assholes. But who gives a fuck that do fun. Gay coming to work today. Don't talking to my lawyer about my fucking lawsuit against the fucking NFL. Um, I really think we ought to do that fucking child. This one is one. I'm still waiting for the day that the light is gradually going to shine on a gym or say somebody at some point. Can you look under one fucking rock and just take a look at that guy? I'll give you a hint. He sits on the competition committee. Start with that. Just start with that. And Ben, you just look what happened when he sat there. What his team looked like, what his team's strengths were, and what were some of the new rules that got implemented. I know, I know. I'm fucking going crazy. I should be standing here with a fucking legal pad next to a fireplace doing stand up in front of three people. Um, all right. Uh, let's see, what else do we got?

Speaker 3:          17:13          Yeah,

Speaker 1:          17:14          what do we got here? What if it's California against Florida for the cup? Your thoughts? Oh my God, I didn't even think about that. What if it's Anaheim first fucking Tampa Bay.

Speaker 3:          17:29          Okay.

Speaker 1:          17:29          Ooh, just picturing that is really cheesy. I would still watch. So, cause there are great teams, you know, something, you know what gives 'em that really gives Tampa Bay credit I think is Steve [inaudible], you know what I mean? He's such a hockey guy is such an ambassador for the sport and I just think what he's doing down there, it was great. And uh, I have to be honest with you, I love the lightning and I also love the devil rays. And I think I don't like about the devil rays. Is it just called the race? You know, I mean, I don't get why people down there and Clearwater and Tampa. I don't get what you're afraid of. I bend down there. I've seen the people. All right. The devil is all over Tampa. Okay. I don't think it's going to influence anybody one way or the other, um, with, okay, if it was Tampa versus, um, the ducks, you know, I really liked both of those teams. I gotta be honest with you. I like, uh, I kinda like what's his face there? The form of capital's coach. Cause everybody was kind of like, Eh, you know,

Speaker 2:          18:28          okay.

Speaker 1:          18:29          He doesn't have what it takes to get them over the hump. I think either way, it'd be a great story. And I also love Ironman. So, uh, you know what, I would, I would root for a seven game series of that happened. But, uh, the other option would be Chicago verse the Rangers. Um, I dunno, range has got a shot, man. They got a shot. It definitely got a shot. But, um, I think most people are saying whether it be wins between the ducks and the Blackhawks, but, you know, something, I've missed all of this shit cause I've been doing two shows every night down at the Wilbur and I want to thank everybody who's, uh, who's been going, coming out to the show is me. It's been fucking ridiculous. I'm doing a late show on a Monday night, Tuesday night, Wednesday night. Just the fact that people even coming out to the early show. So I'm blown away by the support out here. So I hope you guys have been on, um, enjoying the shows and it's certainly having a good time performance for you other than my voice being a little fucked up. Um, okay. Bill, do you have any radio shows slash other podcasts, not Diversey effect that you already mentioned that, uh, you would recommend, um, that you guys don't know about?

Speaker 2:          19:38          Okay.

Speaker 1:          19:39          I mean, the shit, I like the opiod Jimmy show. Um, I always liked Howard Stern fucking, um, the other guys. I was like the other guys in Atlanta,

Speaker 2:          19:53          mmm.

Speaker 1:          19:55          That she can actually, but listen to online. This is a whole new game here. Actually, Joe Rogan, you guys probably already, if you listen to my podcast, you know about Rogen and Marin and all those guys. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          20:07          MMM.

Speaker 1:          20:09          You know what was a fault of my, one of my favorite radio shows of all time was to fill Henry Cho and he used to do this thing where it was this amazing thing where he would host the show, he would bring up a topic and then he would have a caller call in, but the color was actually him and his collar would just say the most craziest shit and it would just get other callers to call in. He was like the original troll. And then the other people would call in and argue with this phantom color that was actually fill Henry. And then he would, uh, and then he would moderate it the same time I, and he's actually doing a voice on f is for family. And I finally got, I was so such a thrill to talk to him. I asked him how he did it and he just said he was clicking off from one microphone to the other and every once in a while somebody would figure it out and call a B, you know, is this the same guy?

Speaker 1:          21:00          And then you quickly hang up on them. And some of the classic ones at this point, I think he can just listen to them online. But he had one where he was talking and was like this, like the 20th, the 25th anniversary of the Star Wars trilogy. And he called in and you know, called in his own show basically, and he was pretending to be some big star was fed. And he was going like, and he was like, yeah man. He's going like, uh, in empire strikes back was awesome. And I loved that po where we're the with Darth Vader is Luke, I'm your father, you bitch and blah, blah, blah, blah. And he just kept going back to that quote, go on Luke, I'm your father, you bitch, and blah, blah, blah. And Phil would then as a host, go, yes, I remember that. That was, that was an incredible, uh, of credible twists in that trilogy.

Speaker 1:          21:48          I would think that all star wars fans, uh, we'll put that rank that in the top three and the guys on. Yeah, man. He said, um, you find that you bitch and then somebody calls in, he's gone. Ah, yeah. I just wanted to talk to the collar. Yeah. He just says, Luke, I'm your father. He doesn't say, Luke, I'm your father. You Bitch. And he just kept saying, yeah, yeah, Luke, I'm your father. You Bitch. And the people would sit there and argue with it, wouldn't figure it out. He pretended to be pilots talking about seeing goblins on his, uh, on his wings one time and some real pilot calls and go and look, I don't know who this guy flies forward, but there's no way he saying that he reported that to any sort of FAA agency or he would be grounded immediately. And then Phil just goes, are you calling me a liar?

Speaker 1:          22:30          And then we'll just immediately launch into this argument. It was fucking tremendous. Um, I dunno. Other than that, you know, I'm an old guy and all the radio shows I like to have gone off the air. I was actually flipping through the Boston stations here, like what had happened to BC and I couldn't find Waf. Wh J why it's all gone. It's got, um, anybody else remember that? The big mattress show. Uh, all right, where are we going? Oh, hey Billy drumming. Drumma boy. What you know about Jimmy, Jimmy Chamberlain, uh, that's the guy from smashing pumpkins. Um, I believe, right? Not as much as I should know. Does that, uh, does that count a look at that? Somebody made a new logo for the colts. It's a blue and white pass a fire right on the side of the fucking, and it's Saturday omelette. I love it.

Speaker 1:          23:23          Please. More of that. I would really enjoy it. All right, so, uh, let me read a little bit of advertising here. Uh, for this week's podcast. Dude, I am so fucking wiped out. This was, you know, this was such an amazing thing to do to be able to do these shows. And within three shows. I was like, this is a really dumb idea. Um, oh my God. Fucking voice. All right, Uber, Hey, oh fuck. This is part, this is, I thought this was a question Uber. Everybody. Hey, you like making great money, right? Here's a really cool opportunity that I had to share with you driving with Uber. Uber's that populous smartphone APP that connects riders with drivers. Um, my wife takes Uber all the time, um, you know, when she seems to have a good time with it. Um, and in chatting, okay, I'm supposed to be saying that I take it, well, I do take it, I take it with my wife and every dental guy loved them by the way.

Speaker 1:          24:21          And in chatting with different drivers, some of them have really interesting stories as to why they drive with Uber. You know, what I do love about Uber is it's a nice clean fucking car. I will tell you that. And I've yet to get in there with somebody who smells like they just fucking played a game. Seven. How about that? Is that enough as a of a personal endorsement for you? Um, the people who drive love being their own boss, they earn great money. It's easy to start. You just need a car and a license. Do this really is a fucking unbelievable employment opportunity. Like back in the day when you got laid off, he was screwed. How do I make my car payment? You can just call Uber and now you were employed driving around a bunch of people. That's your arm out the window. You're your own boss.

You don't, one of the great things this week, um, aside from seeing a bunch of people that I'd gone to high school with, people who have been coming in and, and you know, I've been having them come backstage and, uh, like I said, it's been awesome. You know, I just been running into people and everybody seems to be doing well. Everybody's happy, seem to be happily married. Actually ran into one of my friends who just got divorced within the last couple of years and I got to tell you, he was fucking ecstatic.

Speaker 1:          28:51          Is there anything better as a guy than meeting another guy that's happily fucking divorced? He's just, fuck, he's loving life. You know, he's got an apartment, a couple, two, three boys, you know, he's like, oh dude, it was time. It's tea. He goes, you know what I love about it best? He goes, he'll be sitting in my apartment and there's a bar across the street. And he goes, see, I just think to myself, wow, if I want to I can just walk right over there. I can walk right in there and get a beer, you know, very simple thing. So I know right there, a lot of women are probably thinking like, oh, this guy was a bad husband. He was out there drinking all the time. You know, there's always that fucking option. But then there is the other option that, you know, sometimes ladies, you know, you hold onto the reigns a little too tight, you know what I mean?

Speaker 1:          29:36          He kinda Yank and they head back and uh, you know, it's that horse wants to run, going to have, you're gonna have some problems. You know, if you get some old mayor that's going to go to the glue factory, I'll let you fucking lead them wherever the fuck he wants. You know, you married a stud, right? You got yourself $1 million horse day. You got to let that thing run every once in a while. There you go ladies. And then go off to the pub and get a fucking good buzz going every once in a while. You know, I know you're married. I know you got kids. I know he comes home and he fucking mistakes to sync for the toilet, but every once in a while, you know, maybe once a month, once a month. You know what? I would be fucking amazing. All right, let's just say you were in a marriage right now and you know your husband is a little, a little miserable, you know, and every once in a while he needs to go out and be frank the tank.

Speaker 1:          30:25          What if you just let him get Uber, right? You get him a pair of Bomba socks. You get them an Uber and say, you know what, honey? Once every four to six weeks you can go out with the fellas and just get absolutely fucking loaded. All right? You come walking in through the fucking cellar doors. We'll have a couch down there. You pass out the next morning, the kids won't know shit. All right? Just fucking, just blow out the pipes and then fuck. And then he can come home. And then, you know, once every four to six weeks I get to go do whatever it is that women do that they consider fun. I have no idea what you guys do. What is it that you guys do? You know, I know women fucking love women love a glass of wine around four or five o'clock uh oh that is this a Gar, Huh guys?

Speaker 1:          31:12          She wanted your fucking wife to chill out. You know, just fucking pour a glass every day around five o'clock and she's bitch moaning and complaining as you just go shoo blub, blub, blub, blub, blub, blub, blub, blub. Let it sit out right on the back porch. Go ahead. You know, she's in a really bad mood. Pour another glass. She'll be asleep by six 30 right? Then you go in with your kids. What do you do? You throw in the fucking talk in plain movie with Dane. Cook is a voice, right? Get Dane Cook a little bit of scratch. Your kids is staring there. You know, you fucking poor a whiskey. That's, that's what parenting is all about. Working with your partner. So that the two of you can get a good buzz going every other day without the kids noticing. And I know kids notice a lot, but you stick them in front of a TV, they got no idea what's going on right?

Speaker 1:          32:01          There you go. And you know something. I think that that's one to grow on. You guys ever watched those that I talk about this. Did you guys ever watched, I already talked about this and I don't give a shit. You guys got to go look up. Uh, uh, will forte's like greatest hits on a, the SNL site.

Here's the thing, when the next time I got, next time I talked to you guys, um, will be on Monday and I'll have my final two shows. Number 18. Number 19. All right. Freddie Lynn, who's a famous 19 Joe Thornton. I'm trying to think in Boston sports. Is that what he wore?

Speaker 3:          33:07          Okay,

Speaker 1:          33:07          Randy [inaudible], has there ever been a great 19 and Boston sports? Wasn't Fred Lynn 18 or was he 19? Maybe? [inaudible] was 18 and Freddie, Freddie Lynn was 19. Uh, Fred Lynn. Oh, what a fucking ball player through the end of the day. He was a California boy and they ended up with the fucking, ended up with the angels. All that killed me. Do you know that was our, our, our field. We had Fred Lynn and center Santa Dwight Evans, the greatest fucking, um, you have a saw and we had Jim rice and we had butch Hobson at third. Rick Bellson. It's short. Jerry Remy, the ram dog. It's second. We had George Scott at first, Carlton Fisk behind the plate. And we had Carl Yastrzemski at Dh.

Speaker 1:          33:58          We still didn't win a world series. Fucking brutal. Absolutely fucking brutal. So anyways, um, I think that's it. That's the, uh, the podcast for this week. I know the energy's a little low here. People just work with me here over the next fucking podcast as I, uh, I really gotta go easy here on the voice because you know who's kidding, who? I don't really know how to write a joke. So I do a lot of silly faces screaming the effort and I'm paying for it right now. All right. Hey ladies, once every six weeks, you know, just let them go out and get fucked up. You know, dorm are solid and just say, listen, I'm letting you get fucked up, but you have to be fucking husband of the year for a week. Is that cool? It'd be site be fucking sites. Right? And all you guys got to do every once in a while you pour a glass of wine and then you've got, and then you're good. And then your kids grow up to be raging alcoholics. And you know what? A family that drinks together stays together. All right, you guys have,

Speaker 4:          35:00          we, we can you have a great fucking weekend? I'll talk to you later. I want a girl with the mined diamond.

Speaker 1:          35:17          Have you guys seen this stuff about the, uh, all the suicides at the, uh, the apple plant. You know, that really Canty commercial where they go, uh, you know, if you don't have an iPhone then you don't have the iPhone, you know, and I want it to get an iPhone until I saw those God damn commercials and they kept like, uh, just, it's most bizarre

Speaker 5:          35:38          advertising. It makes me angry at the iPhone. I've never had any anger towards the iPhone or the people who had one. I never gave a shit. I was like that phones to shit. I heard it. It drops calls. I'll wait till it's on Verizon and then right when it gets on Verizon and I'm all ready to jump on board, they come up with this Nananana fucking country shit going. You know, if you had an iPhone right now, you could be looking at the inside he your fucking throat and, uh, diagnosing your fucking throat cancer before it even happens. You know, but if you don't have the iPhone, you don't have the iPhone. It's like well fuck you. I'm Cuban sticking with the droid.

Speaker 5:          36:16          So anyways, now I read they just had the 10th suicide at the apple plant. Now who's kid? Until we all know that everything that we're wearing, everything that we're using is made by some four year old making 6 cents an hour somewhere. We'll evidently they, these people have had enough. They've had 10 suicides at the apple plant. Here we go. On the same day that apple, Dell, Hewlett Packard promised to look into working conditions at China's Foxconn plant, a 10th worker committed suicide. The death of a 19 year old male male worker. Uh, it's too bad. He was like one year away from getting his fucking severance pay or is a shit. I fucked it up. What the hell do you get it when you do 20 years in the force? Ah God, I'm sorry everybody. I'm on my fucking vacation mode. What the Hell I get my pension. What does that, when you worked 20 years on the force and he's only 19 you get it.

Speaker 5:          37:16          Cause he's been working since he was two. Oh Jesus. Um, the death of a 19 year old male worker also came just after the company's billionaire founder took the media on tour of the sprawling complex in response to accusations from Labor groups that workers toiled and sweat shop like conditions. All hilarious. So then the billionaires shows up, they cleaned the place up, stick in a water bubbler and goes, see, it's great. Um, and I know what a lot of you fucking heartless consequent to say. You're going to say, well, sweatshop labor is necessary. Do you want to pay $8,000 for a laptop? What? Here's my rebuttal. You know what if the content, the top didn't have to make $1 billion a year? You know, kind of like when they were talking to the oil companies and they go, you're projected to make 350 billion. How about you just make 340 billion?

Speaker 5:          38:11          Do you have to make that much money? That's the thing. The people at the top are taken way too much fucking money. There's no fucking way that the only, a reasonable way to make a laptop is to give people such shitty wages that suicide is a better fucking option. And you do it at the fucking plant to make some sort of political statement. There's just no fucking way. How about the people at the top? You mean once you got $100 million to what? What do, do you ever need to get another paycheck? I don't understand that. I don't understand that. And I'm not saying that the people at the top shouldn't be filthy, stinking rich because they came up with it. But you shouldn't be paying people. This shouldn't be sweat shops, everybody. That's all I'm saying. And what sucks is that we actually came up with unions in this country because of sweatshop like conditions.

Speaker 5:          39:12          And, uh, but what ended up happening was the people in the unions took advantage of it. And with their strength, they became a bunch of sloppy Douche bags to the point that there's a lot of people who actually have negative views about unions. That's how bad it is in this country. And they're actually excited that they're going to do away with unions. A lot of people want to do away with fucking unions rather than reformed them. But to do away with them is we're going to end up like these poor bastards and in fucking China, you know, so and shit together and go and you know what? I think I'd rather jump out the fucking window then make another God damn iPhone. Um, so anyways, it says the company has bought psychiatrist and Buddhist monks to the factory, to the factory complex to support workers and now plans now play soothing music along production lines.

Speaker 5:          39:59          Why don't you just fucking pay them? Um, it plans to install 10 foot tall, tall fences to stop workers jumping from buildings and may give workers a 20% pay raise. This is how tight these fucking rich concer. Let's play soothing music and put a fence up. We'll try, we'll try that first rather than just giving them more money. What is it? What is it 20% pay raise when you make it 8 cents an hour? Um, and anyways, Foxconn representatives maintain that the increase would not be in response to the suicides, but it's being considered because business has been good. Yeah.

Speaker 4:          40:42          Give me a fucking break. Justice

Speaker 5:          40:49          my neighbor's ass. Yes. Generally speaking are we're going to go with yes. A hey bill loved the podcast. No. Yeah, that's east coast. Oh, okay. Uh, that's why people bitch. Where the fuck is a podcast? I need some advice on what to do about the got this guy lives in a few houses down from me. I'm a third year college student and I live at home. My parents moved, uh, to go live in the state above mine. You mean north and I currently reside, uh, alone while they are trying to sell the house. A few months ago I was driving home, coming back from a gym and while I was driving in my neighborhood, I saw this guy step in the middle of the road, about 20 yards from my car. He was yelling something at me, but I couldn't hear what he was saying. I slowed down to stop my car right in front of him and he came to my window and told me to get out.

Speaker 5:          41:38          I was totally confused and thought I'd run over. I thought I ran over his cat or something. Also, I think he just moved in because I'd never seen the dude in my life. So I rolled down the window and ass. Why did you say he goes, I'm going to kick your fucking ass. Get out of the car. This guy's probably in his forties and has to be around five 10 is that, does this me? Um, 250 pounds. That's not me. I'm 21, six, three, 200. I do crossfit and I wrestle occasionally at another gym I go to. So I got out of the car and I'm standing there trying to figure out what the hell is going on. The guy starts moving towards me, so I take the initiative and take a step towards him. We ended up being an inch from each other and he's trying to do some alpha male shit by just staring at me.

Speaker 5:          42:24          But I have the height advantage. So I'm looking down at him at least 10 seconds go by before the guy goes. How fast do you think you were going back there? I say, I don't know, probably around 30. The speed limit in my neighborhood is 20, and I know I wasn't going that much over it. Then he goes, I'm not going to have my children playing in the yard if I no assholes, like you drive in like that and the neighborhood after, uh, he said that I saw his wife and son were a little off to the side of the road once the word asshole left his miles, I was fucking pissed. I wanted to just tackle the Dick and put him to sleep in front of his wife and kid to teach them a lesson, what I pussied out and just apologize to them and said that I was really Solly sorry. And it wouldn't happen again. The guy then gives me a fucking little smirk and turns around and says while walking away with his back turned it better not or you know what will happen.

Speaker 6:          43:18          Ah, yeah, yeah. He definitely should have kicked his ass. He said, I kicked his ass. Yeah. What the fuck do you do? You realize what a good do you realize what this kid did? He's such a fucking gentleman. He could've kicked the fucking shit out of this guy. He saw his wife and kid there. It would have been emasculated. Yes. Dad Is Superman. He sits there. You know what it is? It's that little smirk. Yeah, that fucking smart. I bet that con steals from work. Yeah, I bet he does. Sorry do. That's the first time I literally had to walk away. You fucking cunt. Yeah. He should have kicked that guy's ass. But it's a good, it's good that you didn't do it, but because you weren't as the bigger person as they say. But he definitely has a comment.

Speaker 5:          44:04          Then he writes now after that, that shit, I want it to explode. I mean, the guy totally disrespected me, so I get in my car and drive off and his story wrong. I couldn't get this fucking guy out of my head. I do it. I can't get it out of my head. I'm going to actually fantasize that I was there and he did that. What I would want to do. I've already, you know what I would fucking do? I would wait till he was alone. Don't do this shit. Don't do this. But I know what you just want to get up. Get the guy alone and be like, Hey, what are you going to do now? Huh? Huh? What are you going to do now? You just get right in his fucking grill and have him back down or I, I would almost just say we got to say, hey listen man, just call them over the car and just say, listen, I just wanted you to know the other day that if I wanted to I could have fucking stuffed you in my trunk.

Speaker 5:          44:51          Tied you up like a fucking pressel and ass rate you in front of your fucking wife. But I chose not to. Okay. Cause I didn't want your son to know what a little fucking, I can't say it. Pussy he has for that wouldn't have been homophobic either. I wouldn't mean me talking about gay people. That's such a fucking pussy move. Yeah. And if for some reason but, but I'm putting no, then that's what you say. Maybe do it like Columbia to say, listen man, I gotta ask you something because I'm six foot three. I crossfit. I wrestle. Okay. And just looking at you. I know I could tie into a pretzel. I know I could do it if I wanted to, but the confidence you had, I just want to know what is your background. You know, cause you know I'm a real competitive guy. You know, if you've got some sort of martial arts training, you know, I would love to have you once we didn't she come down to the gym sometime when your wife and kid aren't there. So I don't have to feel guilty when I fuck you up and close both your eyes with this one and his friend over here.

Speaker 5:          45:56          What does the rest of the things say? I don't even need to read it, but it's not over though. I know. Because this is what's happening now. This is what happens when you do the right thing in life. Okay. When you know it, it eats away at you. You have to make peace. You have to make peace and eat and you got to tell yourself the lie that someday this guy's going to get his. And you know what? He doesn't guys like this don't get theirs. Oh, that's smart. This kid, this kid really painted a fucking picture. I can. This is driving me nuts. He goes, I couldn't get this guy to my head. A week went by and I was still thinking about that asshole too. I would think about this guy. 20 years from now, two weeks later, I was driving home from school and I see the guy rolling is garbage can out to the curb.

Speaker 5:          46:43          I slow down to fucking under 20 and I know this because I looked down at my spit. Tom's pedometer. I pretend to stare the guy down. So I look at him and he looks at me and yell, slowed out. Wow. Now when he said that I am fucking raging, I want it to stop my car and do some ground and pound on his face. Yeah. This kid knows what he's doing. This isn't wrestling with this kid's doing UFC shit, but did I know I just drove off like a fade the next day I talked to my friend about it, about what had happened and he said that this guy said the same shit to him. If he said it, he would have put him on his ass. I know you do. You know what I would've done? He told me that, uh, if he says he's going to kick your ass, then that's a threat so you can defend yourself. Listen to your dumb friend. He's saying you won't get arrested. So a few months have passed and I'm still thinking about this asshole every time I drive by his house. Fast forward.

Speaker 3:          47:39          Okay.

Speaker 5:          47:39          Uh, two yesterday and um,

Speaker 3:          47:42          okay,

Speaker 5:          47:42          I'm biking in my neighborhood. Let's do an I hop I and I hear a honk from behind me. So I pull my bike over to the side of the road and it's none other than the same dude in his Ford F-150 driving along and he looks at me and gives me the middle fucking finger. Wow.

Speaker 3:          47:58          Okay.

Speaker 5:          47:58          Now, granted I was in the middle of the road and didn't hear the guy coming because I was listening to music, but still the middle finger. So I bike home, take a shower and try to convince myself to walk over to the dude's house and confront him. But after a couple minutes of pacing, I just decided to wait it out until the asphalt does. One more thing. I mean, I don't want to get arrested. So my question is, what the hell should I do? I mean, every time I drive by this guy's house, now I want to fucking veer off the road and ran my car into the middle of his living room. Any advice would be good. Uh, all of my friends think I should go over there, but I want a second opinion. Um,

Speaker 6:          48:33          uh, you can't do anything to this guy unless he puts his hands on it, unless he puts his hands on you. This is just one of these things, but you can do to him what he's doing to you. This guy has an insane

Speaker 5:          48:43          temper. So,

Speaker 6:          48:45          uh, you know, I'm not advocating legally so you don't do this. But like, um,

Speaker 5:          48:54          I don't, I dunno what I would next time, you know, if you see him out in the yard or something, this is what you do. I have a great idea. Do you have any friends who are really good mechanically? Um, why don't you take your credit card out, go down to the fucking auto store or whatever. I'll go online and buy like one of those fucking train horns and have it installed in your car and next time you drive down the street, just be sort of zigzagging down the street just to get this guy to be fucking, you know, getting all like, oh, what the fuck? And the second he starts screaming, you lay on that fucking horn is loud as humanly possible and you blow out his ear drums. That's what I would, but then again, then no one too. She liked us. He would say that I have permanent hearing damage.

Speaker 6:          49:37          You know what I think you should do? Maybe because I'm a female and I'm all about the cycle of bench. Okay. Psychological warfare. What should he do? I think when the husband is not home, I don't know if he, if he knows his schedule or whatever, he needs to go over there when the wife is at home and be like, listen, you know I'm so sorry about that time that I was speeding. I really, you know, but your, your husband's seems really upset. I'm really not trying to be like that. I would never do anything like that. And women I, oh no, no, no, cause she knows her husband is a psycho and like, I mean she could turn it around and be like, yeah, you shouldn't do that either. But I have a feeling she's not like that and he can just go over and just make nice and be like the sweet kid that's helping out or oh, do you need me to take the mouse out? And then, but then the, I feel like maybe that would fuck with the husband and he's like sitting there sipping tea with the, the way if it, oh look who came over. He just wanted to apologize in person. And you know,
