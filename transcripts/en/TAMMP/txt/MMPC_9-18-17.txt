Speaker 1:          00:02:02       You know, after every bite I count and I chew fucking 27 times on each side of my mouth. And then I take the Napkin and I wipe off like a fucking angel. If there is a god, La, whatever the fucking peanut butter sandwiches you're read to. And with that, our law peanut butter sandwiches. I wonder if fucking the couch getting any death threats from extreme Muslims. Well, maybe he was Muslim. I don't know. They never really said God knows sesame street was liberal enough. They probably would have thrown that in back then. Right. And then Bob would be fucking singing that song. Uh, what is it? Who are the people in your neighborhood?

Speaker 2:          00:02:47       Neighborhood. A neighborhood. Oh, who are the people in your neighborhood? The people that you meet each day. Oh,

Um, you haven't had Devon had a drop of booze in fucking 32 days. 32 fucking God damn days. I'll die right now. I'm not even gonna lie to you. This was the longest month and a day of the year without a doubt. Um, it's fun in the morning. It's not in the evening. Like right now. I just want to get fucking blasted, you know, I dunno. Can't do it. They'll can't do it. Gradually coming down. I got to get down to a buck 72 my fighting weight is Bob. Pogo says onF is for family season two while you're watching, are you liking how you're giving it a thumbs up, whatever the fucking scoring system is over there at Netflix. You know, I don't know what they use it now and I think they said they're going to go with thumbs up, thumbs down.

Speaker 1:          00:03:47       And I think they stuck with the star system. I have no idea. I don't pretend to know. Um, my whole fucking weekend it's just been about keeping my fucking leg raised. I went to this fucking party on Thursday night with my lovely wife and the fucking host of it was given a big speech and I was stone sober and I had to go over and sit in the corner was outside in this guy's lawn with like a tent. Right. And I'm sitting, I go off in the corner to sit down stone sober with a fucking, I had like club soda and lime. The hardest thing for me to order, cause I can never remember what you're saying. I can just for some reason I can never remember club soda cause I never ordered and half the time I go up to the bartender at the Va, what can I get you? I'm like, yeah, what's that thing people drink when they don't drink and then they go club soda. I go yes with alive.

Speaker 1:          00:04:41       And then if you're trying to be funny like a third of the time, that's how I have to order it because I can't remember what it is cause I never ordered. So I'm on my second club soda and lime in this guy who's hosting the party. Fabulous hose. He's fucking tank and all these people. I had to go outside the tent because I see a stone wall where I could sit down because my fucking ankle is filling up with fluid. Um, and it's becoming twice the size, my other ankle. But you know, I went to the, you know, I just went into some walk in clinic and the guy looked at it. Oh, I'll tell you what. I'll tell you. I can tell you what you did right now. I can tell you for a cross the fucking room without even doing an x ray, you know, walk in clinic type Shit, you know.

Speaker 1:          00:05:21       So I go to sit down the guys in the middle of this great speech, everybody's fucking listening and I don't know how, but I set my glass down and I reached back to get something. I knocked it off and it made that and it was like a fucking wine glass. So it sounded like a booze glass in the middle of his speech and like half the 10 fucking looks over me. I spilled it on my link. I did all of this stone sober. So my [inaudible] comes walking out. She's laughing at me going, what did you do? And I was all embarrassed going, I was going near stomach and a scene. I felt bad enough as it was. And then she got mad at me cause I got like, I got, you know, I

Speaker 3:          00:05:58       got emotional with her so she didn't, didn't talk to me for like two fucking days because of that. But two fucking day she started talking to me. You know what I mean? Like if she ever spilled a drink on herself and half a tent to people looked over at her and I walked over and said like, what did you do? Like, you know, mad she'd be at me. But that's how it works in the male female dynamic. All right? You're either wrong or you were too mean when you were right. That's basically how it was. That's what it was. I think I was guilty of being too mean. So anyways, I, um,

Speaker 1:          00:06:32       I watched a little bit of the Patriots today. I saw the first quarter, I taped the game. I'm going to watch the rest of it, uh, patriots with a little bit better today. Obviously it's early in the season, you know, this is what they always do. They hype up shit because people are went beating teams are losing to teams and all this shit that you're not going to see in January. Who gives a fuck, right? That's just getting going. And um, I actually went to a, I went to the stub hub center today and I saw the new Los Angeles chargers, their first game against the Miami Dolphins. Um, I went down there, I got to tell you, that might be the best stadium. I've seen a football game and at the NFL level, simply because there was only 25,000 people there. I can't believe the patriots are playing the charges on the road. If I could see Tom Brady and a 25,000 seat stadium of, it'd be fucking incredible. That's like the old, that's what, what the old NFL used to look like

Speaker 1:          00:07:28       back before. You know, we out fucked all of those other stadiums back before lady Gaga and fuck it, Whitney Houston, everybody brought all these other people into the game. All these people who are just like, oh my God, what else happens after the concert? You know, when they started watching football, so they had to build 50, 60, 70, 80, a hundred thousand fucking seat stadiums, 25,000 seat seats. I got to see two wily veterans to gunslingers, Philip Rivers, Philip Rivers against a, what's his face? Said? Jay Cutler's at Jay or Jake? Jay Cutler. That's right. Jay Cutler, right? Am I going to say his name right? Jay Cutler. I like it. One guy's a fucking religious frequent 90 kids. The other guys like set them up, set them up. Let's have another drink, right? Jay Cutler. There you go. That's right. Jay Cutler. So I'm fucking, San Diego had the Goddamn game one. Wait, this is showing me a body builder. Is it Jake?

Speaker 3:          00:08:27       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:08:27       This is the age I'm at now. I don't know anybody's fucking name anymore. Jay Cutler. There we go.

Speaker 1:          00:08:36       No, it is Jay Cutler. All right. Whatever the fuck this fucking guy, right? He key key leads his team down the field day. Go ahead by three points and then San Diego comes down the field. Philip Rivers, he doesn't give a shit either. He's worried about a fucking two minute offense. This guy's got nine miles to feed. You bet you have a nine kids. Just it's, you just come home to a standing ovation. Everybody's freaking as here. You have a crowd, you have a fucking crowd of kids. Oh, amazing. Is that till they all become teenagers and then there's a 10 to 15 year period where they hated you. You know, you never made sure that I know. So God staked down. You always sat down the other end of the table. I wanted to sit closer to you and then he's going to deal with all of that shit. Right. Um, was a great game. Fantastic fucking stadium.

Speaker 4:          00:09:26       MMM,

Speaker 1:          00:09:28       dead great. There's not a bad seat in the house. I'm telling you before they moved to some giant monstrosity of a fucking stadium that this Sharon with the rams, I believe. And it's going to fucking, you know, bankrupt his city.

Speaker 4:          00:09:40       Um hmm.

Speaker 1:          00:09:42       Before they fucking do that. Eat. If you get a chance, definitely go to the stub hub center. It's fucking phenomenal. You know, it's funny, I was, I was sitting, I was watching the game and I see this guy flying over in this helicopter, the Robinson 44 during a fucking game. He's, he looks like he's not even 500 feet off the fucking gruff flies right over the fucking stadium. And I, with my limited knowledge of aviation, realize that when there's a big event like that, it's an automatic temporary no fly zone. An hour before and an hour and after the game, I believe that what is, if not two hours before and after, right? This fucking jerk off flies right over the fucking stadium. And I'm sitting there with my buddy going, ah, that didn't look like a cop. Right? You can't, I don't think you can fucking do that. I'm just a novice, but I do not think you could do that.

Speaker 1:          00:10:23       This fucking jerk off comes by again. He's on his side showing all the passengers down in it, and then like two seconds late, like a police helicopter comes flying over. I don't know if he got in trouble or what, but, uh, I dunno. I know some pilots listen to this shit. I, like I said, I don't ever pretend to know anything about that stuff as far as, uh, my limited knowledge. You are not allowed to do that. God forbid something happens and then you fucking land on 25,000 people watching fucking Jay Cutler, right? With keg booze coming out of his pores going up against, uh, the other guy from Ash Wednesday, right? Um, uh, these Kansas city chiefs for real. Uh, so I, I fucking got a taxi on the way down.

Speaker 4:          00:11:09       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:11:11       And then on the way back, I called the car service and I'm fucking tell him this guy, I'm like, meet me at one 84 and Avalon. All right, there's a Kentucky Fried Chicken right next to a doughnut place. Can you fucking meet me there? Right. So the guy is like, yeah, I was good. All right, great. Great. All right, so we get down there, right? The game ends. I walk out there for 15. He's supposed to pick me up at four 30. I called the guy up, he's like a fucking city block away. Everything's going good. Then all of a sudden the cops are everything and they're like, dad, like Uber and Lyft. One 92, I walked down, walked down to one 92. Right? And I'm sitting there going, well, I'm not Uber or Lyft car service. I'm like, these guys are going to fuck with me. So I try and call this guy.

Speaker 1:          00:11:51       I called the guy up and I keep telling him, the guy, he's gone to grab a block away. I'm a block away and I'm going, yes. Yeah, I forget the Kentucky, the KFC and go, no, no, no, no, no. Don't KFC now. No, KFC. There's a doughnut shop right next door. I'm going to walk over, see if you can turn it in there and he goes up, go up. See, I'm going, no, no. Listen. I'm walking over, walking over. All right, forget it. You can't walk into the doughnut place. I'm going to go down to one 92 in Avalon. He goes, okay, give me a parking lot, KFC. He just kept saying that like a prank show and I'm literally getting angry.

Speaker 3:          00:12:29       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:12:29       Yelling, no. One 92 an Avalon into my phone and like people with kids and turn around looking at me. So I'm trying to put more of a happier tone in my voice and it's just not working

Speaker 1:          00:12:40       and he just kept going, okay, KFC parking lot. I come, no, one 92 when the Avalon, and then I finally got to just repeat it, repeat it, and he goes, yes, yes, I will repeat what I said. He goes, one 92 Avalon. I go, fine, fine. And then like he's calls me back, hook up, pulling into the donut shop. I finally had to fucking take a picture of one 92 in Avalon and send it to the fucking gun. Ain't showed up. Right. And he was the greatest guy ever. Greatest guy ever. And I was like, all right. You know what? Maybe I got a little emotional. Okay, there's 25,000 people walking up and down the Goddamn street here. I don't know what to do here. Maybe, you know, I don't know what, but I will tell you that when I was at the game,

Speaker 3:          00:13:21       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:13:21       Um, go. See when I was at the game, the, uh, these people in front of me, I've never seen this before. We're drinking. Uh, what's that Mexican beer that begins with a, with an m begins with an M bay. It's in a, it's fucking gold, right? It looks like there's almost like a trophy looks delicious, especially after 32 days in that booze. And so these people in front of me are drinking this shit in it, out of a can. And they had this shit, this shit on top. I'm like, what the fuck is that?

Speaker 1:          00:13:51       Is it crushed red pepper flakes? What is, and this guy next to me goes chili powder. They put chili powder around the topic cause I don't like it. I'm like, is that like white people putting a lime and a fucking corona? He goes, yeah, it's something like that. He goes, you know, I don't really like it. And I was like, well, I got to try that. I mean, not right now, but eventually I'm going to try that. Um, it looked like the shit that you put on the warning track. So these new, uh, baseball stadiums, it's sort of sanded sort of rubber. That's what it looked like for fucking far away. Um, so that guy proceeds to get absolutely plastered and after three fucking, um, quarters, he comes back up and yells to the crowd that they stopped serving beer at the start of the fourth quarter and he's yelling about how dumb it is. And, uh, that's one of those moments where it was good that I also wasn't drunk cause I would have been like, yeah, buddy, you're the reason you're the fucking reason they do that because you can't hold your alcohol. Look at you, you're a fucking mess. So I actually went to this game and this is like a record for me. I didn't have any booze and I didn't eat any of the shit food. I had like two handfuls of fucking peanuts and drank like three waters. That's it.

Speaker 1:          00:15:02       Because I can't be a fat fuck on this thing, you know. So, um,

Speaker 3:          00:15:06       okay,

Speaker 1:          00:15:06       I fucking go downstairs and take a piss. Right.

Speaker 3:          00:15:09       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:15:10       And he's this fucking guy just yelling at the police and there's like two cops there and then there's three and then there's five. And I'm walking by. I go down and take a piss and I come back and there is like half the police force is standing there and is this white dude screaming at all of these cops screaming, you got to do some, go up there and, and do something. Another white guys yelling, dude, it was like total white guy moment. You're like yelling at fucking 20 cops. He's not getting the shit kicked out of him. And they actually listened to it, went up, they'd kick two guys out and the other guys were like really fucking like, oh, all right. They just sort of left. I don't know what they did. I Dunno what the fuck they did. It was the weirdest thing was the two guys screaming, looking like the ones that we're going to get fucking arrested. Um, but we're demanding that these cops go up and do something and then they finally fucking did when they throw these guys up. It's a really bizarre day, but I'm, but once again, a phenomenal fucking a sports experience if you go there. So, um, I apologize. A lot of this shit is going to be all sports stuff. That's kind of what I did this weekend. I can't hang out with my daughter and I just watched a bunch of sports and uh, did anybody put on the NFL network and watch Dan Marino a football life.

Speaker 3:          00:16:27       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:16:27       It was fucking amazing. But like you can't do the Dan Marino story in fucking 30 minutes. That should have been an hour and a half long it least. And as much as he five feel like the finally got his fucking do is you watch and Troy Aikman, Peyton Manning, Brett Farve, all of them saying this was the guy, this was the fucking guy. Then finally putting to bed this whole thing that you know that, because he didn't want a Superbowl, like that's some sort of like,

Speaker 3:          00:16:55       okay,

Speaker 1:          00:16:55       black mark up against the guy's fucking name, the guy, he was so ahead of his time, he was such an unbelievable fucking quarterback. It took 25 years, a quarter of a century, and a massive change in the rules of passing in. How you could defend against the past for people to start fucking with what this guy did from 1983 on. Um, he was unbelievable. You know what kills me is his dad taught him how to throw ball, come the arm comes up, ball comes out. And I can't even tell you how many times as a patriots fan, we played them twice a fucking year. I thought Andre tip had had him, he's armed with the football would still be at his waist and Andrea was bringing his fucking arm down to get them in somehow as armored come up. And it'd be out 40 yard fucking laser.

Speaker 3:          00:17:44       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:17:45       Oh my God. He used to kill us. He used to kill for all you young dolphin fans out there. That fucking Tom Brady. You know, cause he's been beating your ass two games a year for like almost his whole career. Just about, um, that's payback for Dan Marino. I'm telling you, Dan Marino today in his prime would easily throw for over 6,000 yards easily. And if you could actually win without having a running game, which you can nowadays, the way that fucking game has changed, he would have at least one Superbowl ring. Okay. I'm telling you, um, if one of my favorites of fucking all time and I'm glad they finally did, uh, the football life and I think it was at least an hour too short. All right, day you go. I've said my piece that's coming from a patriots fan too. And when he played, I fucking hated him because he, he killed us.

Speaker 1:          00:18:39       I didn't really hate them, but you know what I mean? I wasn't pleased with him.

Speaker 1:          00:24:40       It's one of my favorite fucking just one scene actors. I've, I've, I don't know, I don't watch a ton of movies, but I fucking love this guy. He plays the cop in the bathroom when a, what's his face? Tim Roth is sitting there with all the drugs and he comes out and this is a dog, a dog sniff and a the drug sniffing dogs sniffing drug sniffing dog. Um,

Speaker 3:          00:25:04       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:25:05       See was in pulp fiction too? Meaning also. Yeah. He wasn't in a lot of movies, but he plays Mike. The way he, he's being the cop and he's telling that story. Just the way he

Speaker 1:          00:25:17       like the line. I said, buddy, I'm going to shoot you in the face if you don't put your fucking hands on that dashboard. That's just the way it's written in the way he did it. He goes, I said, buddy, I am going to shoot you in the face if you don't put your fucking hands in that dashboard. Just the way he said it. I don't know why that sounds exactly like a fucking cop to me. So that was like something just me and my friends, we would be fucking hammered striking out with chicks and you'd just be walking out to your car and one of your invariably would just go, buddy, I am going to shoot you in the face. And everyone just started laughing. You don't put your fucking hands in that dashboard. Who are your favorites?

Speaker 3:          00:25:57       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:25:58       Who were your favorites? They just had that one thing. Your fucking friends you still quoted man. Ice knew a bunch of those is obviously a zillion guys. Is it a zillion lines and fucking Paul, uh, am sorry. And I'm good fellas by the way. Uh, rest in peace. Frank Vincent, the first big guy to go from Goodfellas, man. I mean, what, what an absolute legend. What an absolute legend. He was as amazing as an actor, as his hair was. What a head of hair that guy had. Good Lord Jesus Christ. What a head of hair. That guy had his whole frigging life. That's what you say when you're bald. You fucking see that on people. Look at that guy. I know if I ever had

Speaker 3:          00:26:44       that hair. Some people, you know, some people they just fucking, I don't know what genes that guy is, that guy, he must add a Roman emperor or something in his fucking family tree. Um, credible actor.

Speaker 1:          00:27:02       And so God damn funny, comedic timing was incredible. Um, I even love the commercially did one I think is only line was oh, when that guy was like stocking up the freezer and he was disrespected him, he and his buddy just kept going. Oh, oh, um, definitely going to miss him. And that was definitely somebody on my bucket list. You know, I get in a movie, I'm like fucking two, three lines, but that was definitely a bucket list to ever be able to do a scene with him. And what was so cool? Uh, Michael Rappaport. Um, quite possibly the funniest guy in social media right now with this fucking videos are so god damn funny. Um, he actually posted a picture on his Twitter account. You should check it out. I think it's, I am at, I am Rapaport and it's him working with Frank Vincent in the early nineties.

Speaker 3:          00:27:53       Yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:27:53       it was like really early on. And he got a picture of him shine and Frank Vincent shoes and he said, uh, at one time, Frank Vinson, uh, maybe go home and get my shine box. And what I love was a lot of people now can look back on it, a classic, and everybody's quoted it a zillion times, but Rappaport already knew. Go home and get your fucking shine box. He was on that shit early. Fucking early nineties. Uh, they barely done editing it. He already knew that that was an instant fucking classic. Uh, I got to get him back on the podcast again.

What'd you think I was gonna talk about how Mississippi, Mississippi State fucking trounce my Lsu Tigers. You know another one of my favorite teams, Smu giving away 56 pounds per player on the fucking offensive and defense defensive line against Tcu. C'Mon frogs. How SMU was whipping that fucking Horn toad ass for fucking the first half before they wore him down. He just leaned on him. Um, do you think I was going to congratulate the Cleveland Indians in an unprecedented 22 in a row? Does that what you thought I was going to do you think I was going to do all of that? And I wasn't to talk about that Formula One race down and fucking Singapore, that race made me sick to one of my favorite races of the year. It's at night, it's in Singapore. It's one of the most beautiful, amazing slash kind of freaked me out cities I've ever been to in my life slash countries. Um, it really is one of the most beautiful, amazing fucking city where you just feel like you're overbearing. Parents are home all the time. Um,

Speaker 1:          00:34:01       it was fucking rain. It was night. It was raining out. Okay. The Ferrari's were running great. Daniel Ricardo was running great. Mercedes wasn't doing that well, you know, I don't know if Hamilton at fucking, I thought it was all tied up. Maybe he was up by three points. I can't remember. But Ferrari needed to show up on this fucking day. All right. And if you watched when they were doing the time trials on Saturday and you sell what was like trying to drive behind somebody doing 150, 60, 70, 80 fucking miles an hour with that fucking rooster tail of water coming up. I mean, it was going to be an unbelievable fucking race. God knows whoever's in fucking first place and then first turn is going to win the God damn race. All right, so Sebastian Vettel the Ferrari's, they get first and third. All right, well Daniel recard on the red bull isn't second fucking place. I believe that's the way it was. Right? Fucking Mercedes or back and fourth and fifth. So the Goddamn race starts offer Ferrari has to do. All he's gotta do is just make it to the first turn in first fucking place unscathed. He's going to win this fucking race. Okay. Worst case scenario, Hamilton gets fucking second place. That's only 18 points. Federal is going to get 25 he'll pick up fucking, you know, whatever. What does that seven points? The fucking race starts.

Speaker 3:          00:35:28       Yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:35:29       Kimmy Reagan and he acted like fucking Greg Brady. When, when? When the pressure was on to beaten gotta beat Marsha could to get close to the quarter of an inch. He fucking stomps on gas. Tries to go around.

Speaker 3:          00:35:40       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:35:40       Oh, I'm sorry. It was Max Verstappen, not Daniel car tries to go around the guy that fucking tires get all fucking

Speaker 3:          00:35:47       yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:35:48       in a locked there when they fucking go up and over.

Speaker 3:          00:35:52       Yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:35:53       he fucking fucks up his car. Slams the fucking red bull car into his fucking teammate.

Speaker 3:          00:36:03       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:36:03       The other Ferrari Vettel

Speaker 1:          00:36:07       makes it to the first turn unscathed. Meanwhile, fucking not on skate, but he makes it there, but it takes, car's fucked up. It got hit in the back. Meanwhile, fucking lose fuck. And Hamilton, he drives right around the shit. Raise sneak sneaking by. Fuckhead comes back in with this fucked up car. Greg Brady, right smashes in to the fucking red bold guy again. And who does he hit? He hits the fucking Alfonso in the fucking orange car. Try and do the exact same thing as Lewis Hamilton, but Lewis Hamilton's that Derek Jeter, fucking star child, just blessed 3000 hit the aid of fucking grand. Slam one of these guys in fucking Vettel drives like, you know, two more turns in the whole front of his car. It comes off both Ferrari's, out of the fucking race. They were in first and third place, a first and fourth. I can't, I don't remember.

Speaker 3:          00:36:56       They had them.

Speaker 1:          00:36:59       They had them and they let off the hook. They were both out of the race before it even fucking started. And all I could think is what my dad used to always say. When somebody would do something like that, you'd be on crisis guy or that guy. I said, okay, you could fuck up a free lunch. That's the first expression that popped in my head. I think I tweeted it. I was so fucking pissed. Ferrari could fuck up a free lunch. I mean, that was a free lunch. No one could drive fast. That date. Mercedes weren't running well the whole fucking weekend. So what do you do? You take out yourself and you fucking teammate you clear out the whole fucking front row. So fucking Lewis Hamilton, who just drives along unscathed. That guy, Lewis Hamilton is a blessed man. That's one of those deals. He's one of those guys. Makes you believe in a higher power like this. Just somebody that just fucking loves. I mean, I, I'm taking away all the preparation the man does, but

Speaker 3:          00:37:56       you know,

Speaker 1:          00:37:58       he cuts around the outside, no problem. Alfonso goes through the same thing his fucking days over. Unbelievable. And then the rest of the race and riding around the fucking rain in Hamilton fucking wins. No problem. Unfucking believable.

Speaker 3:          00:38:13       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:38:14       I wanted to see a race. I knew that Hamilton was going to try to fucking, he wasn't gonna be happy sitting in, you know, all the way back there. Right. Who would be right. I wanted to see what the fuck he was going to do with this car. Not doing that well and all of that rain. What? He actually crashed. I mean, you know, he's going to push it to the fucking limit. All of that was out of the second. It started like, remember that year the jets was supposed to be good and like fucking 99 and like the first game, Vinnie tested verde goes back and blows out as Achilles and then Keyshawn was crying after the game. That was the original. That's my quarterback. That was the original. Um, that's what it was like. I still watch the fucking rice. It was still fucking, it was still exciting by Jesus Christ. Um, anyways.

Speaker 3:          00:39:06       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:39:06       And then I also, I watched the boxing. That's all I did this weekend is I just fucking watched a brain in an episode of F is for family. So I just stayed in the whole fucking weekend when I wasn't writing. I was just watching sports and, uh, I'm not a big boxing guy just because I've gotten fucked over so many times in the paper views. Uh, so forgive me if I fuck up. The pronunciation is a Golovkin first. Conello and uh,

Speaker 1:          00:39:33       that took me back. That's what pay per view. Boxing. He used to be. I'm not saying he didn't get fucked every once in a while back then, but it was just too, they was fucking forehead to forehead. Just, it was a war, feeling each other out, respecting each other and all that shit. And then, uh, the usual bullshit happened. You know how that fucking lady saw at one 18 to one 10? I mean, I, I the Jesus, I, I don't know shit about boxing. And I was like, what the fuck? Um, and I loved how Roy Jones in the fucking end goes like, I, he goes, I love that it was a draw, you know, cause that means we get to see this again and next time there's definitely going to be a decision. And I felt that, I felt like he was like, they were like, Roy, don't bring this up. This is the Illuminati script of boxing. Please don't bring this shit up. That it's, this whole fucking thing is a, that it was going to be a drive. We had any way to make this thing be a fucking draw so we could do it again. Um, but it was great. It was a great fucking fight. It's so, I thought a glove can clearly won the fight.

Speaker 1:          00:40:35       I just thought he was backing up the whole fucking time. And uh, I know can, I had some big shots towards the end, but he glove could just fucking walk. He ate them all up. He ate him up. He just can, he would back off for a second. You just come back and then he would fucking give him, uh, you know, if he took two, we'd come back and give him too. I just thought, you know, I dunno, I agreed with you that, that fucking guy who screams all the time.

Speaker 5:          00:40:57       No, I got to fight the mood.

Speaker 1:          00:41:01       That guy, he's always screaming. Uh, do they have them in the crowd so we can't hear himself? Does he not have headsets on? I loved that he yells every fucking time. Um, I dunno. I thoroughly enjoyed it. The decision obviously stunk, but I did not feel that I got fucked on my money. I feel like the fighter's got fucked and I retweeted this rant that Teddy Atlas went on and um, it was, you know, somebody has to say, I just don't understand how it's still that corrupt. It's just, they've never like, it was weird. Like Vegas was totally corrupt and totally mobbed up. And then they cleaned it up by putting those corporations in there who then fucked you on everything, including the steak.

Speaker 3:          00:41:44       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:41:46       Why can't they clean up boxing? Can they get the mob out of this so that the corporations can come over on the legal side of stealing and fuck people more than they ever have. Maybe they have, I have no idea. I don't understand it. But a Teddy Atlas said, I'm gonna, I'm gonna Butcher it. How he said it. He said those guys went in the ring and came out less of who they were. Meaning that they fit you do permanent damage to yourself. I mean, will they will break it down the uh,

Speaker 3:          00:42:17       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:42:17       They will break it down, the power shots and all of that type of shit. And it's like I was watching Rogan's recap of it.

Speaker 3:          00:42:24       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:42:25       With Jim Norton and, uh, Rogan read some stats where this guy, he took, okay. You know, here's the, blew his head. He took 118 punches to the fucking head. I haven't taken 118 punches to the head of my life. Am I bowled? A brother used to beat the shit out of me all the time, but we knew you kept it to the body. That's what your father wouldn't see it when he came home. Um, so, but other than that, I mean it was, it was great. It was everything that I knew that may weather and m McGregor wasn't going to be. And that's why I didn't rent it. And that's why I spent my money on that. I still got fucked.

Speaker 3:          00:43:05       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:43:08       But, uh, it's Tommy Morrison still alive. Okay. I have to hit pause on this cause I gotta watch this shit. He's a relative of fucking John Wayne in case she didn't know. I'm sorry. He's a boxer back in the day. Uh, all right. I got to read some of the, uh, the shit here for this week. I can't see anything here doing this in my fucking living room. We bought these things and where we, uh, yeah, and another thing I had to fix on this house, say these fucking awful lights on the wall. So we bought these sconces, these really fancy fucking things. And the thing, the fancy thing in front of the light is so goddamn thick that it, it always seems like it's on a dimmer. It probably should have just bought a higher wattage bulb. I Dunno. This has gotta be one of those moments where you're like, why the fuck am I listening to this guy? He's talking about the fucking light bulbs in his living room. I'm sorry. All right. DNA testing at Raven's game.

Speaker 1:          00:44:02       No boy, dear bill, I love the podcast. Love you. Stand up. I Love F is for family. Thank you. I have to start promoting that at my standup shows too because I feel like a lot of people still don't know the show's on. Um, so if you get a chance, if he give the show, tell your friends about it and everything just so we can continue doing the show would be awesome. He said, I wanted to hear your opinion on this very weird giveaway at Sundays. Ravens game. I'm a season ticket holder for the ravens and it's not unusual to get little freebies when you went to stadium commemorative coins, beer, koozies flags, et Cetera. A Sunday is the home opener and some company is giving away free DNA test. So I guess this happened yesterday. Free Dna test, but he trying to do it. Figure out if you're a fucking human being.

Speaker 1:          00:44:50       Um, and it's not even some ancestry.com type shit that could give you some semi useful information. You're not getting any useful information from ancestry.com they're doing what this company is doing. I don't know what they're doing, but they're not trying to help you out. Do you really need to know how much Scottish blood you have in you that you really need? What? So what you can do, what go on and go feel justified by an a fucking kilt. You're not Scottish. You're a Mutt. Um, the article I linked says, uh, they're testing for four genes. The test offers insight into your mind, body and health is what they claim. It seems like this company just wants a bunch of data and they figured that an NFL game is a great way to get 70,000 mouth breathe and fucking morons. Um, that, that part was me. 70,000 people, d 70,000 people's DNA all at once. Uh, the company has also partnered with the 40 niners. So testing my, come to San Francisco soon. What are your thoughts? Keep up the good work and go fuck yourself. Ah, I think I know exactly what this is.

Speaker 4:          00:45:51       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:45:53       In the future, people's DNA is going to be a, it's just starting to become a revenue source. The way your phone number and all of this other shit that they get from you at cvs and all these fucking places. It was another revenue stream where you were buying shaving cream tampons whenever the fuck you doing and then they would get personal information from you that then they could then sell to other fucking companies. Um, I think it is now that they've exhausted all of that, they've now moving on to fingerprints, face recognition in DNA and they're going to share this with everybody. And uh, I know the robots are coming. I don't know how to, I don't know where this all lands. I know that there's talks in the future that human beings could be meshed with robots.

Speaker 4:          00:46:39       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:46:41       If I had to guess, they're probably going to get to the point where with your DNA they can grow another you and say, well that's not really you. The real you is going to the ravens game. So we're going to do all kinds of Nazi doctors, Nazi doctor esque type experiments on this with the fucking robot before we release this to the public. That's where I think it's going. All right. And you know, I don't want my twin adult brother coming into this world had 51 years of age cause I figured another two years we'll probably start doing it and getting a fucking, you know, bionic arm put on as he's screaming and fucking pink has, God knows they're not going to use fucking anesthetic cause that that fucking DNA version,

Speaker 4:          00:47:30       you will be the property of a corporation and we'll have no rights to fucking mmm

Speaker 1:          00:47:37       anesthetic.

Speaker 1:          00:47:40       Why don't I write Scifi? You know, I did the whole fucking thing about how you had to take a test and if you flunk the test on the population control, eh, you just walk into the ocean and now there's a movie coming out about that. I Dunno, maybe I'm just not original. Maybe I should start writing these fucking things and that sounds like a cool fucking movie, right? Uh, you have to go save yourself. You know, Hollywood do some fucking creepy happy ending where you're just staring there yourself touching each other's face and everybody's fucking crying.

Speaker 4:          00:48:13       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:48:15       I Dunno. You throw will Smith in there somehow. It's a winner. All right. Whiny fan complaining. All right. Howdy bill. I'm a four year podcast listener and I saw you love and San Antonio early this year. I think your layers guy, and obviously it should podcast and I should go fuck myself, but I think your Trump positions are kind of unfair. Um, oh God. Not another political fucking person. He did call himself off of being, I think your Trump positions are kind of unfair. Well then you think my Hillary ones are fair. All right. God bless you. I know you're just a comedian. I know you have a lot of fans in the quote real America. Ah, there's the left talking down to the right. Okay. And so you have to tow align.

Speaker 1:          00:49:05       Isn't this? This is the classic, I really hope the person wrote this is listening, sir. You're in, you are inventing all of this in your head because you're upset about something politically. Okay? Are you mad at what I'm talking about about Trump? Is that what this is that you feel? I have to tow some sort of fucking what? Liberal Line because I'm out here in Hollywood. Uh, but Trump is, to my mind, obviously a dangerous guy. I won't go through my whole list of grievance grievances, but he thinks climate change is a Chinese hoax, a supports the white supremacists and just this week through the lies of 800,000 I think that to make sure he didn't use any comments, you 8 million people who were brought here as children into disarray. I know every president has skeletons, but even a liberal like me, Oh, is a Hillary person can see this guy is nothing like w w or George H. Uh, dude, when did I say I liked this guy? I never did. I never said that I liked the guy. I just said people freaking out about them and losing their fucking shit. I should've been more specific like fucking white people acting like the needle in your life was going to change that fucking far. All right. By the way, um, you know, if you really want to see a bunch of skeleton, both of these people, I mean this election was essentially 2:00 AM at a bar. I mean, you had to go home with somebody, right? Probably shouldn't have. Um,

Speaker 1:          00:50:42       listen, this fucking guy thinks climate change is a hoax. Fine. All right. Hillary was all for bailing out these fucking banks in 2008, which is exactly what the fuck happened. And all these people who stayed in Florida riding out the fucking storm and everybody's making fun of them and saying how dumb they are for staying there. They're probably upside down in their house. And unlike the bankers don't have another house that they can go to. Yeah. Evacuate the area and do what? Go with half of the Florida and sit in a fucking waffle house in Georgia. And then what? I don't have enough gas money to get back. I love the complete lack of sympathy for people that can completely fucked in 2008 which Hillary was totally all about. She was also all about fucking

Speaker 3:          00:51:29       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:51:30       You know, ignoring the wishes of the people on the left who voted more for fucking Bernie Sanders according to this trial and colluded with the Democratic Party to ignore those votes in box. Bernie Sanders out in and she just took the nomination and now all of a sudden she's got the fucking balls to sit here and talk about the electorial college. Okay. She's not a good person either. And I'm not saying w was, I told you I was done. I want to say WME. Sorry. Donald Trump. I said I was done with Donald Trump.

Speaker 3:          00:51:59       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:51:59       When he said that both sides can take contributed to the violence, that he couldn't even get himself to say that those Nazis might be a little out of their fucking minds. The neonazis I told you I was done with the guy. Okay, but you hate the guy so much. You're hearing what she want to hear. All right. Maybe I don't Trump trashed Trump enough on this podcast, but I don't feel that I need to, everybody, at least in my profession has a bit on how fucking stupid the guy is. Million dry mouth talking about this shit. So I don't, and for you to sit there, you fucking cunt. After four years of listening to my podcast, acting like I tow some sort of line. Did you, do you ever listen to my fucking advertise and I lose advertisers all the fucking time. Okay. If I was towing some sort of line, I would read those things like I was on fucking Lawrence Welk. Hypen Geritol I don't. Okay. I tow a line as far as I say, what the fuck? I think it's funny. That's the line that I am towing here, sir. I'm sorry, the guy that you wanted to fucking win didn't fucking win. I know. I know. Trump's out of his fucking mind and I don't need you wagon. You fucking finger at me. Give me a God damn fucking lecture. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:53:08       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:53:08       Is if I don't understand that this guy's fucked up. Okay, so why don't you look at your, I'll up your own fucking skirt.

Speaker 3:          00:53:17       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:53:18       It'd be a little more even handed all you fucking guys. I mean, I guess you got to whine about Trump because he's actually the fucking president of Jesus Christ. The fucking, I don't know what the fuck it is that Hillary gets is, is unbelievable. P S Hillary sucks. That's all I get on this side.

Speaker 1:          00:53:35       You know, he said, look man, I just think that despite what you're saying about being community, you do have a platform. Fuck you buddy. Fuck you. You're not putting that on me. All right. I can tell you this right now, dude. If you get your political information from a fucking standup comedian who can't even read out loud, you use this thing to decide who the leader of the free world is going to be. I can't help you. What am I supposed to do? You know what I would say to you? Send you fucking DNA into the ravens. Um, anyways, you do have a platform and why? I'd never dare to tell you what to say. I hope you will consider what happens when you play down the danger of his behaviors. Um, let me ask you this sir. What exactly would be happening now if the other fucking bought and paid for fucking Twat went in there? What do you think would happen? What do you think would happened? Huh? Do you honestly, while she admits that global warming is real, what do you think? What happened?

Speaker 1:          00:54:40       Do you think she's going to do anything most the most she could be and therefore is eight. Fuck, they just wait him out. Al Gore in 1992 said that there has to be a car that gets at least a hundred miles a gallon by the fucking year, 2000, something like that. And it just kept delaying the project and delaying it and delaying and delaying it and delaying it. And then they were out of office and they just fucking went away. There you go. So I don't know what to tell you. I have to tell you buddy. Um, I always vote outside of the democratic and the Republican Party. Okay. Unless I find somebody within them, like a Bernie Sanders who I feel will actually, hopefully make more people within those bought and paid for fucking groups. Uh,

Speaker 1:          00:55:27       I don't know. Take a stand for fucking regular people. I mean, that's what I do. Okay. I don't like Trump. The guy makes me sick to my stomach. I think he's a, I absolutely think the guy's fucking racist. Uh, but I also think Hillary is the fucking devil in a lot of ways. We sidestepped a bunch of other shit. Okay. We walked into a bunch of the shit with Trump. But you definitely sidestepped the come on man. Everybody, anybody with any remote sense of intelligence knows that, you know, that was the fucking Blue Bonnet bowl. All right. That wasn't the fucking, that wasn't Alabama versus fucking Clemson or shit. That was uh, you know, that was the holiday bowl election. Alright. Actual money based, but I, I'm, you know, I dunno. I Dunno why you needed to send me that dude. Do you honestly think that I want to see fucking kids get sent out of this country? I don't. I don't. Okay, so stop turning me into the fucking, you know what it is you want of this country's fucked out. There's a guy who can't read out loud that does a podcast twice a week. And I'm telling you that is, if we could just get him to politically say what we feel, I think we could turn this country around.

Speaker 3:          00:56:38       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:56:39       We're taking callers. I said, buddy, um, actual money based on gold. Hey, Billy gold bullocks. That'd be great. Have some gold bullets in that fucking diamond encrusted pouch. I was listening to Rogan's podcast recently and he had a guy called Peter Shift on and he was talking about gold money.com. This is basically a private gold reserve where you can buy gold, which is held in a secure vault. Oh, is it? Listen, you give us our money and we'll have, we'll hold your gold. Great. So they keep my cash and the goal, do I got to send them a donkey toe and using a prepaid mastercard, you can pay for goods and services with your money backed by gold or platinum if you'd rather buy that. Uh, I would do that immediately or when the dollar crash is effectively what the banks used to do a before they sold the foundations of our currency here is here in the UK. Gordon Brown sold all the diamonds that back sterling, uh, when the bank shit the bed. Um, I don't know what any of that means. Here in UK. Gordon Brown, who's Gordon Brown or is that a bank

Speaker 1:          00:57:58       like fucking JP Morgan, uh, sold all the diamonds that back sterling when the bank shit the bed. Oh, okay. So you got your money back. Cause I was saying I just, this minute signed up does sounds like a commercial and I'll be putting some money into it, although not all my money as it's always best to diversify when you stash of saving. I think it is much better than bitcoin as it's actually based on something of value. I love you to go fuck yourself, sir. Why don't you just take your money and go buy a gold coin?

Speaker 1:          00:58:29       Why don't you just do that? Why don't you take your paper and go buy some gold and leave with the gold rather than giving your money to this fucking person you're not gonna meet any tells you that he has got, he know there's gold there. He's basically doing what they're doing with Fort Knox where they say there's all this golden there and then there's rumors that it's fucking empty. Um, I liked the direction you're going in, but uh, I think you, uh, went out of the frying pan into the fire with that one grant. I don't want to shit on the whatever that guy's doing because I got your abridged version of it. But um, that reminded me of that movie blow where Johnny Depp's character gives him $2 million in cash and they give him a book that says $2 million on it. Then he goes to jail. He never gets his fucking money. All right. My girlfriend's daughter is causing us to break up. Is that a bad thing? Um, Jesus Christ. I mean, you're already dating somebody that already has a kid, so that's going to be already a hundred times harder to make that fucking work. And then the kid doesn't even like you. So I mean maybe she's doing you a solid here.

Speaker 3:          00:59:32       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:59:33       Hey Bill. Okay, here we go. So my girl and I have seven years, both work for the same company and I was offered a better position in Florida and she was also offered a position as well. Now here's where the daughter comes in and fucks up the flow. Yeah. Cause she fucking probably wants to stay at her school. Her daughter's 14 is just starting high school, just a foods refusing to move and her mother is going along with not forcing her to move and it's going to pass her is going to pass on our position. We agreed I will not move down and get things in order until she wait. We agreed I will move down and get things in order until she gets there in four years. Now, for the past few weeks we've been getting into more fights in our reasoning for the fight is sit down for this one bill. She says it's easier for me to leave when she's mad. She's fighting you because it's easier for you to leave when she's mad. I think that's the dumbest fucking reason I've ever heard. Also, she keeps saying, I'm going to go down and find myself some black ass and ended up cheating on her while I'm there.

Speaker 3:          01:00:43       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:00:43       We'd love to get your take on this situation and get your insight on what I should do. Thanks. And pick up a fucking drink. You Pussy. Fuck. Ah, I would say A.

Speaker 3:          01:00:58       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:00:58       I'd say there's a staggering lack of trust. Um,

Speaker 3:          01:01:02       okay.

Speaker 1:          01:01:03       I think the key here is to not get into an argument with her is to just sit down and try and discuss it with her and just say, listen, yeah,

Speaker 3:          01:01:10       mmm.

Speaker 1:          01:01:13       We agreed that this is what I was going to do and now what it is is I know, I think this is what happened. What she did was she did what was best for her daughter and she put herself with you in second, but she still sounds like cares about you and the fact that you're down there and she's worried that you're going to leave and she misses you. I think that that's what's happening. So I would just ask her, it's just some like misdirected anger. I, we were actually just saying that you miss me and you love me.

Speaker 1:          01:01:45       Is that what you're saying? It, we can work through this and then if you're really not going to fuck around, we're on her and you're really going to see it through. Then you want to be able to just say, listen, I'll do whatever it takes. I'm going to be there in four years. If you're not lying, I think you ought to be able to work your way through it. And I think this has less to do with the daughter then it has to do with the fact that she just misses you and she's afraid that you're going to find somebody else down there. Evidently wherever you moved where, uh, there's a bunch of black ass down there. That's what I was, that's what I would guess. So are you guys need to get on the same page and you didn't have an honest moment with yourself before you fucking slowly tear the bandaid off. Either get the fuck out of it are totally commit to her. Um, I mean, seven years at this point. Why didn't you drop in a fucking ring on her?

Speaker 3:          01:02:34       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:02:34       Done on a, shut her up for a good couple of weekends. Um, it won't shut her up permanently. I can tell you that right now. Oh, I can tell you some stories.

Speaker 6:          01:02:42       Oh,

Speaker 1:          01:02:44       can I tell you so, oh shit. Right back in a or a tea latte. 11 mayor Reed Guy who jumps through all the fucking hoops and still gets the evil lot. All right. My wife, uh, my wife is, uh, who were there, Bill Billy Butler tits. Fuck you. I'm losing weight. Uh, my wife, my wife decided to have an affair for months ago. Oh boy. Before I knew what was going on, she told me she didn't know if she wanted to be married to me anymore and that it was because I was too controlling.

Speaker 1:          01:03:21       And by controlling she means I told her as a stay at home mom, I had expectations. I expected it to keep the house clean and take care of our children as we agreed when she quit her job. Yeah. Which is a totally fair ask, you know. But nowadays in this world of hyper fucking feminism, not all feminists are bad, but the fucking, the uh, the god is great fucking crazy ones there. Um, yeah, they would say that that was sexist. That, you know, well, why don't you work all fucking day and then come home and also have the house clean. You know what I mean? Let me look up. You got a bunch of kids, it can only be so fucking clean, but at least she could do is order a pizza. Right? Um, anyways, I would come home to her friends being at the house and her drinking all afternoon while Jesus Christ. She's not even making an effort.

Speaker 1:          01:04:16       Oh, this is what happens when you draft in the first round buddy. You know, you get those second rounders, they, they got some to fucking proof. You know, that's just what happens when you marry a 10. I'm assuming she's good looking. If you putting up with this shit. Uh, I would get home from work after being gone 15 hours and a half to say something about how I felt that the house was a wreck and there was no dinner and sight. It never seemed to matter. Back in January, we moved to Denver from Atlanta thinking everything would be better. And she met this 25 year old guy who she proceeded to sneak around behind my back with and bring our children around. No Way. I'm 38, she's 35. We have two children and we've been married for almost 12 years. Yeah, Dude. Yeah. This is a wrap. Yeah, and now she wants a divorce to plans to move this kid into our home with our children. Oh my God, Dude.

Speaker 3:          01:05:10       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:05:11       This is the worst person ever. I am beside myself with the thought of the divorce and this punk living with my children. Oh my God. I know it won't last, but the fact is I don't want my children to be around this piece of shit, let alone living in my house. She thinks this is, she thinks this is perfectly okay to put the kids and I through this. I do love her and would do anything to save our marriage, but the truth is she's delusional at this point and I guess I am too. What do I do this? Stop this. I know this is not my fault because I busted my ass to build the life she always dreamed of. Only for her to think she can kick me out of it. Any advice and or the lovely nick you could give would be greatly appreciated. Thanks. And Go fuck yourself. Yeah, man. I mean, this is the things, this is what can happen to a guy.

Speaker 4:          01:06:00       MMM.

Speaker 1:          01:06:02       But you're not allowed to talk about this on television are you? Never, never, never. You can talk about guys being overbearing, domestic violence, all those things that should be brought to light, but they will not talk about this. You Watch doctor Phil talk about this. You want to blame the guy. So she saying, Lou reason that she saw his cock was because you weren't paying enough attention to her. You need to try to pay attention more to her. Well, she sucking his dick. What do I do to stop this? I don't know.

Speaker 4:          01:06:44       MMM.

Speaker 1:          01:06:47       At this point I would be thinking about my kids and how I could make this as look through. This is what the fuck she wants to do. This is what the fuck she wants to do. Are you make this as easy a fucker? Transition your fucking divorce. Uh, I can tell you this. I know you called her a whore here. Don't ever say that to your kids because at the end of the day, it's still their mother and you got to fucking, you know, you got to look the other way. Um, I dunno dude, this is, this is outside my fucking realm. Um, I can tell you this dude, you fucking 38 years old. You sound like a great fucking guy. Um, I would just, whatever you got to do for your kids, I would do that. Her is a fucking lost cause. All right. And I would, um, yeah, I would do that and I would start P90x and, and go out and get yourself a fucking beautiful, goodhearted fucking woman. I mean, I would maybe even if you have time, I would go to therapy and figure out how the fuck you ended up.

Speaker 3:          01:07:58       Okay,

Speaker 1:          01:07:59       well she's just a total psycho. Like, so you don't go out and fucking marry that again. Um, figure that out. But the fuck I'm trying to marry you off already. Jesus Christ. You just getting out of something. I don't know. Do this by head spinning over this one because I'm putting myself in your shoes. I don't know what the fuck I would do. Um, oh man, that's a rough one. Some other fucking guy going in telling your kids to pipe down. I mean, Jesus fucking Christ. Uh, yeah, I would, I would, uh, I would talk to somebody about this way beyond my fucking educational level. That's what I would do. I hope you get through this thing and, uh, what a fucking mistake she's making. I can tell you that, but she does the way you described it. Granted, I gonna get your side of it. She does not sound like the final person that even when she does fuck it up, she'll admit it. She probably still put it on you and uh, but you know what? It'll all come out in the wash and you kids are going to know that you're a fucking good guy, so. Well, Jeez. Can we, can we, can we end on that? I don't know.

Speaker 3:          01:09:05       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:09:06       I don't think so. Hang on a second, Nia.

Speaker 1:          01:09:12       Okay. My fault. I thought she could come on. Uh, she can't just get to do mommy duty. I got to have it back on more, man. Miss Savin around here. Um, anyways, that's the, uh, that's the podcast for this week. Uh, how about those dolphins? One and over top of the AFC east, you know, patriots won and one in second place. Um, it's still early. Kansas City looking fucking tough. Uh, what else? Cowboys' defense is in shambles. Bread Ahrens to call me or text me all fucking concerned about that. But it's still early. It's still fucking early.
