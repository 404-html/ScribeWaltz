Speaker 1:          00:00          Hey, what's going on? It's bill burr and it's time for a another special edition of the Monday morning podcast. If you new to my podcast, you probably say, Hey, what's his special, what's a special one? Usually I'm here by myself laying in my fucking underwear, running my yap, but every once in a while I have a special guest and uh, this, this person will not let you down. This is one of my great friends in this business is one of the funniest bastards I haven't met in my life. He has a new special coming out on Netflix called mouthful of shame on a, that's already funny on March 14th please welcome the legendary Jim Norton.

Speaker 2:          00:35          Thank you bill. That's a nice intro. I don't know how to handle nice things being said about me. I know. Does it make you uncomfortable with people? I was going as big as I could go through when you score me. One of my great friends, one of the best comics I ever saw. Just listen, just watching you squirm over there. I can handle personal things are a Gar away. We are from one another. It is odd. My manager's kind of saying they're uncomfortable with this fucking giant cock bulge in the middle. It looks like a retired figure skater.

Speaker 2:          01:02          Sorry. All right. Anyways, I can handle personal like, because we are great friends, but any type of compliments of work, I can't. It makes me so like, do you like watching clips of yourself? I'm going to torture you for this. Drives me nuts, dude. I watched he, we get to watch a clip of yourself when they bring you back and then the people in the room like, ah, Yay. That was good. It's so fucking [inaudible]. If you ever do a talk show and then they're light and they play either something you've already done or whatever you're promoting, I literally will, uh, you know, if they cut to it and I actually look to monitor to see if the crowd's watching it at home and then I just literally, I'll put my fingers in my ears if I have to. I'll start humming now. Humiliating. It's horrific. Do it man. I can't watch because then they feel like they're fake laughing. Like they don't really like it. They're just playing along to me polite. I feel like they're just kind of being nice to little Jimmy Norton. They just being polite to me. The only way I can watch

Speaker 1:          01:53          myself as if I filmed myself at a club and I'm just watching it. But the second that I would, if I knew it was going to be uploaded or broadcasted and I know that everybody's going to see it immediately, I'm like, oh my God, why did I do that with my hand? What did this fucking sell? Everything immediately. It's horrific. But having said that, I uh, I actually made sure my last special that I sat through it. I sat through a couple of times to make sure that at least I had like the look of it, the look of it right now. Did you do that with your new special mouthful of shame that comes out in March?

Speaker 2:          02:25          I'm going to hype the shit out of this. It's funny. Yeah, I did it obsessive. I probably seen it about 60 times, but just in editing, like I don't mind watching it to edit. Like I go point by point over both shows. I want, I know exactly what I want from the late show Polish from the early show. I'm really anal about it. That's good. That's good to have. Yeah. Cause I don't trust that like anyone else it, Netflix is easier cause there's no commercials you have to worry about and they don't give a shit if it's 56 minutes for promos it can be an hour and two hour and three. So I was very comfortable doing that. But like you said, as soon as somebody else in the room, I want to hang myself but I can do it alone all day. Cause I know I'm doing it as part of, it's still part of the work.

Speaker 1:          03:00          But once it's done I'm like I can never watch it again. Oh I walk out of the room second other people in to watch it. Oh Hey can I see a thing here? And absolutely. And then they sit down and I closed the door and walk out. Could you watch it with Nia? Could you watch it with someone you really, really close to if like it's not like somebody you need to impress her. I just don't have to be standing up and would be standing up with my fucking hands on top of my head like that. Like, Eh, is it good? Is it suck? I'd be doing that the whole time. And she literally gets mad going shut. She knows that this point, Nia knows to be like, you know, she'll just come up and say, Hey, I watched your special, it was good. Or I watched this, it was good and blah blah.

Speaker 1:          03:32          And I go, okay, good. You know, like if some, if a parts coming up that you don't like legal, I, and I hated the way I did this thing like right before it happens. Cause you like, you don't want them to watch it and pretend to like it when you know it's not it, it's fucking psycho. Have that thought buttons. It comes out like this. I just, I just go, ah, it's just a noise. I just yell over over and it just, it will bother her. But I've also learned that, uh, yeah, it just, that you're going to think it's way, way worse than it fucking is. But don't you find the comedians who are so comfortable watching themselves saw something wrong with that? Man, I can't, I keep your eye back could literally watch a fucking marathon of their entire career and be oh yeah, I love that sport coat.

Speaker 1:          04:12          I loved when I wore that. The way I roll those sleeves up. I absolutely love this one. It was a dog and cat thing. Oh you're gonna love this. You know I've been a loop. I've, I'm not a loop a tear watching Robert Klein videos cause I, we are having him coming in and I, and he's one of my idols and I'm watching like Robert Klein from the tonight show in 81 82 83 watch them on 74 on soul train or whatever. He was fucking great man. Robert Klein is a guy that most people don't mention like no one talks about Robert Klein anymore. As much as I mentioned prior and Carl and, and Robert Client is the most underrated guy I think to ever. Seinfeld always gives him a bunch of props and was talking like how he, he was, I think that was one of his guys. He liked Cosby and Robert Klein I believe.

Speaker 1:          04:54          And um, I forget how he put it, but he was like sort of their age, like when he was still in those things in the 70s and he was going to colleges, like he was like that age part of that generation. So he was kind of there. Thank keep like Carlin was more of a sixties guy, even though he blew up in the 70s. I think, um, people from that generation remembered them, but it's, it's weird how some people, despite their contributions will kind of slip through the cracks like that. It's, I find with most people that when that are like, that they're not into self promotion. So if you're not spoon feeding it, like the amount of fucking journalists out there, if you just tell them, you know, like, uh, I'm one of the edgiest guys on the set, like, oh, well what not that's tuned to stripe. But if you're, you're like the, um, uh, I would always like to, I dunno, I would, I would equate it to Detroit that calls itself hockey town. Like they gave themselves a fucking nickname. Like why are you a hockey town? Wouldn't it at least be Montreal, Montreal Canadians. They have the most fucking uh, you know, championships they've got the fans will literally drive out of town. I mean,

Speaker 2:          05:58          why, because you're that, well no one Michael Jackson the king of Pop, not saying he wasn't good, but he kind of gave himself that like right that nickname. But like have a lot of hacks do that and nobody thinks that somebody will be a big enough asshole to give themselves a nickname. So people just kind of go with it. Like people must have called him the king of pop cause nobody can be that fucking narcissistic to give himself the nickname, the king of pop. But he probably did. And the press loves them because they write the story for them. That's why they'll love a Rex Ryan. But hate bill Belicheck like Bella check is smart enough to be like, you constantly going to take any little thing that I say and turn it into bolts and board material. That's why he stands that gun, you know they're good. And I think next week's going to be a tough game and just taking a, why don't we get time and then they want a guy like Rex Ryan go look, oh gonna win the Super Bowl. Then they love him. I didn't come here to kiss the ring. The I'm going to go in there, we're going to shove it right up their ass. And they're just like, like before he's done talking, their article is written. Yeah. Milania go foreign 12 yeah.

Speaker 2:          06:53          I Love Rex Ryan. I love what a priority is. I live with that. He loves his wife's feet. He's the best one. He loves his wife too. Yeah, he does know his wife keeps him on the rails. I swear to God, if he didn't have that guy would ate himself to death. I see it like all that shit talk and he does. You see like that's why I love that guy. When I watch him, like he's his flaws. I'm like, Oh my God, this guy, he's a shit show. This guy is a shit show. And he loves his wife to death because she saved them. You totally see the whole thing. Yeah. He's a disaster. He's a disaster. I was trying to say it in a nice way. Yeah, but he is. But there's something endearing about that and not, you know, I just started watching football again.

Speaker 2:          07:27          I can't care about it. Uh, I'm like, wow, you're the biggest one. We would come up. You were huge. Campbell's always fan and then you were huge Yankee Fan. I just, I stopped, I started going on the road more and more. I just stopped caring as much and I'm like, I'm putting in so much effort to these guys and I meet them and they don't give a shit that I'm alive. I had a couple of bad experiences with athletes on, I remember done. Yeah, I was wrong about the Jeter thing. I was a baby. I really act like a little douchebag. I was fucking rat. He was a deck to nighttime, but I way overreacted on the air. I'm embarrassed by that. Well, if you, if you, if you go to the psychology of the way you overreacted, it wasn't really just your love for the guys and the team.

Speaker 2:          08:03          Yes. You are a jilted lovers. Patrice used to always say absolute lover. That's exactly what it is. I mean, you know, uh, the, the, the husband that becomes a stalker is the guy that was obsessed with his white, like, you know, that's what I was, I was obsessed with them. And then they didn't love me more than my biggest meltdowns was gene Simmons because he hurt my feelings. He blew me off and I wanted a photo and he was kind of a dick about it and it just ruined me and I fucking killed him on the radio about it. And I kind of felt bad because he was nice to me. The next time I saw him, I met him one time. He was teasing me about losing my hair and shit. I just so wanted to be like, dude, do you think of anybody's buying that fucking Darth Vader helmet wearing a walk in your fucking head?

Speaker 2:          08:37          That's terrible that he as Chewbacca his hairline dude. It is like shoe Polish, black. I mean you can you talk to the guy and your kids kid not even look at. But what I love about him is he would sit here and laugh right along with you and not give a fuck and then just scribble down Chewbacca with hair and the next day they'd be a picture of him dressed as Chewbacca with some his shit written on it and he would make $1 million on unreal unapologetically go make $1 million off of it. He really doesn't care. You don't. One thing I like about Gina, and this is one thing that Dee Dee, Dan rather interviewed him and he talked about his, he's a patriotic guy. Like nobody loves America more than Gene Simmons because his mother was in a concentration camp and she came here and when he was a kid and he remembers he did.

Speaker 2:          09:21          I think he was Iranian are the biggest kiss fan. Yeah. Yeah. No, you're way off. This is about as far off. Yeah, he was. He's a Brazilian. I thought he was Irish. Yeah, he's a, he's a, he was born in his name. His real name is hime whites I think. And he was born in Israel and he said his mother's Zig high old when she came to Ellis Island. And he tells that story to Dan Rather about how moving it was to have them tell her to put her arm to it. So you watch that and it's like, that's the gene he should be showing people. Wait, what did she do that, cause she was, she didn't know any better. She came to America and she had to pledge allegiance to America to get in. That's what you did. So she's [inaudible] and the guy put his, put her arm down.

Speaker 2:          10:00          It's like, no, you don't have to do that. So if that made gene come incredible patriot, those people were so lucky back then that there was no youtube that would have ruined her life. She'll never run for office. Never even opened a bakery. You know the seek high, a little girl is now coming of age to make some pastries. Fuck you. You Hitler love and pitch all of that picture of her with the statue behind her. Say Hi. Yeah, you're right. There's no live in a town now. Do you have any clips about you? I think there's so many things on me that I, that could ruin my life that I, I think that it's almost, there's so many that they can't at this point. Things I've said or you know, things I've admitted. Is it the things in your life that you're like, fuck, I wish I didn't talk about that way back.

Speaker 2:          10:39          Weddings. I didn't realize that it could me on me or do you not care? Yeah, I mean I just, I mean it's going happen. It's inevitably going to happen to everybody. They're going to go like, oh, you said this in 2006 and be like, oh, did I? All right, well why don't you get into your time machine and have me apologize. The 2006 version of me. You know what a lot of it is, is I would equate it to the the Eddie Murphy thing where Eddie Murphy delirious and he did all that, that material about gay people and everybody laughed and nobody said, Shit, I'm sort of gay. People didn't, but mainstream did not. And then when mainstream catches up and starts to learn that, oh, that's really hurtful and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah to gape, then all of a sudden, and he's just like, you know, they talk about, oh my God, they look the other way.

Speaker 2:          11:23          Bob, you know when you, when they talk about that part of the special, they act, it's like, well where were you during that year? I know you saw it and you sat there and laughed at the same way I did. I did. I didn't know that. I didn't know what the Sh that it was to that level. So I think you could do that with anybody. Well, I think what? Let's any off the hook, especially with that type of material is the whole, you know, I was giving her a ride. Excuse me for that special young lady boy, if that didn't make me love Eddie, nothing. Well, but like you have to that you're like, Eh, all right, we get it. We get it. Who knows he could for him. Who knows? I get involved in people's

Speaker 1:          11:54          personal lives. I don't give a, I don't either. And not in a judgmental way. I love the fact when when things about let's say any celebrity come out, they could or could not be true. It makes me like the more like, it makes me understand like, yeah, this, this is a public persona. Like I feel bad for, there's one major actor in particular who miss male massage therapists said he was doing stuff and I feel so bad for this guy. I'm like, he said, what did torture it is to live your life. Being afraid you're going to get caught or being for being who you are. Yes. Oh God. That's gotta be fun. It's going to affect how much money you make because of the, yeah, that's all. It's all, you know, some, a lot of that personal life shit that kind of drove me away from ESPN because it used to just be the games and they'd show highlights and just seemed like a bunch of people, you know, broadcasting, it just loves sports.

Speaker 1:          12:42          But when they started to just keep like delving into these people's lives and trying to like do like the controversy shit, I just, um, I dunno, I just Kinda, I got away from it after a while. That's why I love the sports packages and I just taped the games that I want to watch. I S I blow through the pregame and I, and I never watched any postgame analysis or anything. I just watched the fucking game and that's it. You know, the Knicks recently handled Hannibal Burress retreated this thing where they did the first half with, uh, you went to the game and there wasn't a bunch of people running around shooting tee shirts at you every time there was a stoppage of play, not a bunch of music playing. And all I would have loved to have gone to that game. Yeah, it is distracting and they think we need constant stimulation and constant noise.

Speaker 1:          13:23          Like no, we're at the game. I'm okay just watching the game. I'm okay if it's the third inning and it's a, you know it two in one and this one I don't need I fucking manic stop it. Basketball's the worst. Basketball is the worst just because they run out into the court and it could be like a really critical part of the game. One Oh three one oh three timeout did. It's like time for like one more shot and these fucking assholes guy comes out in a gorilla suit, tee shirts at you and shit and it's just kind of, it becomes like a Chucky cheese. You supposed to be teaching your kid the game here, like this is really important and there's all these people at that extra excited look on their faces. They're holding the tee shirt. I always, I sit through all of that hoping that I'm going to, you know, nobody ever sits with me, but I have this, this is my little fucking dream is that I'll sit and everyone else would just stare at fucking daggers at them and they won't do it anymore.

Speaker 1:          14:14          I don't give a fuck about a bunch of con smiling, jumping off trampolines, dunking the ball. It's actually embarrassing. The white people like, look how little we can jump. It's humility. We need this here. I saw that at a suns game. I had a great time at the game, but that bullshit. They're like, yeah, that calm look crazy trampoline fucking guys. And it's like fucking nine white guys coming out there. We don't need gymnastics. Yeah. There's nobody blocking them either. And there's Matt Paul. It's like a nerf hoop, like taken to the next level. I'm sure someone's going to tweet me. Oh, actually it's really hard combining those sports. But um, I hate mascots. I think they're unnecessary

Speaker 2:          14:52          and they're stupid and they, they, they, they child up the game. Like the, I, we interviewed the Philly fanatic in 2001. There's one I like to Philly fanatic. Oh he's smells. Those uniforms stink. I too. I remember about being next to the affiliate for night. The stench. I'm sure they all smell like that, but they all smell guess man than you know you're out there wearing some for fucking outfit. It's horrendous. And to me they just, they do nothing to make me enjoy the game. That's what I kind of always liked about like I hated the mets cause fucking Mr met and that big store.

Speaker 1:          15:23          I love the lack of imagination of that one. It's just a guy with a baseball for a head.

Speaker 2:          15:27          Yeah, Mister. And then they named them after the team. I literally is stupid. Really comes off as the first idea. What are you going to, how about Mister Matt? Go ahead. He's got a baseball head. He's a guy.

Speaker 1:          15:40          Call him mister. We played during Valentine's Day. Maybe we going to miss his men. I actually love a mascot standing on a street corner holding up a tax tax thing and doing a stupid dance. When I'm sitting at a red light. It makes me laugh my fucking ass off. I don't know what it is. I think they should have them. Just mascot should be like in traffic like every 200 yards. It's just somebody doing a stupid dance just to entertain you. That's what I need. Entertainment, not when I'm fucking attic at an entertainment thing. I don't need entertainment during the,

Speaker 2:          16:10          in between the moments of entertainment, you don't need extra entertainment and it's not even entertaining. Mascot should not entertaining. I never watched a mascot and like, oh that was kind of funny or cute. It's insulting and it's related.

Speaker 1:          16:21          I would say the Philly freak, the San Diego chicken, there's a couple of classic ones where they were actually funny. Um, that's about it. I always feel bad for the truck when they slide, when they run in to take the big slide, go ah, the little guy couldn't do it. No, I like when like the Philly frequent walk up and fuck with the umpires and mess with people on the other other team and stuff like that. It's, it's, I dunno, like that's one of the classic ones, but I forget the red sox they tried to have on a long time ago, it was called the Fenway freak and he lasted like seven games. People would just pelting him with shit ain't, you know what was like the 70s this is when you could actually go there and be a fucking alcoholic scare and children. And then they brought this guy out in a fucking, you know, muppet outfit and he just got the Philly freak.

Speaker 1:          17:06          But now they have a, Oh this is just the green monster one. Yeah. And it's called Wally Wally, right? Oh, it's like a pun. It's a mascot with a pond name, Pun for what the park is known for. And then, then, yeah. And then they swing sweet Caroline during these seven things stretch. Just when I thought your YMC horseshit at the Yankees game, trust me, it's bad. But at least the, you know, was the grounds crew that kind of looked like, all right, like they took this boring thing and made it entertaining a little bit. Like that was kind of interesting to watch people still spell out why MCA was just, yeah, that, that's, that was always tough to watch.

Speaker 2:          17:43          I don't need to wash the grounds crew was singing what was probably the gay anthem for 19, for the 70s. I don't need to see them fucking saying that every seventh inning. Yeah. That might've been the, uh, like, like they were so gay than the shift that they were doing, I think would actually be offensive to gay people. I'm a construction worker and I have the big mustache and I'm a leather guy. We like, dude, like literally now gay groups would be like, you know, you're perpetuating stereotypes. We go to work in gray suits just like you do or whatever. But um, that's fucking hilarious. Do you remember Victor Willis the lead say, did you know they were, I didn't know they were gay. I was a big village. My father took me in to see them when I was a kid. It was them in sister sledge was the opening band and I didn't know legendary, you know, disco show are absolutely, that was like for the mighty.

Speaker 2:          18:26          If it was either them or kiss was the first one and I didn't know they were gay, but I found out like I didn't know what the village was. Greenwich village thing. I had no idea what any of that meant. I didn't either. I thought it was cool to, oh that's the construction worker got YZ construction worker. Yeah. I didn't know where musicians, why is he just a bass player or the Indian Phillippi rose. He's still, he's still, he's still my favorite. I thought he was awesome. I loved this head dress. I really did. I actually liked the one who looked like a, somebody who hit on Al Pachino and crews and Glenn Glenn was the one I liked. I thought he was bad ass like that's why I never saw a rob Halford from a million miles away because I'm part of that last generation of way. If you wore a bunch of leather and had a mustache, you would like some bad ass bad ass cycle.

Speaker 2:          19:06          I didn't understand that. There was a whole other side to that. I had no idea. But now you look back on old Helford video. I'll go back on Youtube and watch old Judas priest from like a, from that domain was that contract. They didn't like 83 and Philly. There was that. That was the, that just live aid or whatever it was. Do you watch priest from that and you're like, oh, how did we not know? It was so obvious and I love the fact that he came out and nobody gives a fuck. It's just how offered, you know, he's like a big power top, you know, he just, he's fucking ramrod. I, I've just loved the guy. Nobody gives a shit. Oh. I think he grew into that role. He looked like a bottom early on. I think as he got older, you know, he got a little more comfortable with himself.

Speaker 2:          19:42          There's a story that he has a big Dick and he puts some guy in the hospital, Florence, he told me his story, anything, if you put a guy in Ohio, he didn't put any person in the hospital with your Dick. You're a legend. And I heard that there was some, some hairdresser who for years one and half or to find finding it's consensual. Let's put that out there before that clip gets you in and they're over 18. I mean, I'm talking, you know, the asterisk is that it's an adult in a consensual relationship or consensual encounter and you willingly allow him to put your Dick and you line up in the hospital. That guy's a legend. I'm just picturing the interview afterwards with the fucking another person. At what moment did you realize you were in over your head? When I was, when I, when I told him he has to pull it out and I realized it was still four more interesting.

Speaker 2:          20:21          Yeah. There was some moment where he realized this was a bad decision, but I heard he was bugging Alford to fuck him and he was a hairdresser or whatever he was. It was odd. The whoever the guy is that how for oh, fucked intend to the hospital and a health word finally did it. And uh, he, the Guy Wound, oh, you hate fucked them. All right, fine. I'll give you the rock star Dick. Yeah, I hear he's packing like an animal. So there's nothing but good, good thing you think you did it right before a show. So he's wearing all that fucking awful studied shit. It's just the sound of your screaming in his fucking milky thighs rubbing together leather pants. I'm sorry everybody. Sorry. Just paint that visual. He smells good too. I interviewed him before a show one time. Me and this guy Troy from the show went to the, I guess it was a garden or wherever they were were the metal and he smells so fucking good.

Speaker 2:          21:06          So I bought the same Cologne. A lot of times I'll smell Cologne that British rock stars have on and I'll buy it. And it's very specific. It never, because they smell gay. British rock stars are just British rock stars. No Ozzy's not gay. Ozzie's Ozzie's the best smelling guy in music. Ozzie smells better than anybody a rob Halford smells great. You would never guess that with Aussie ass. Not saying that. You know, just, you wouldn't think that he smelled. You wouldn't, you wouldn't associate him with like a really rich guy smell. But Ozzy, you can smell from down the hall and he, he has it, I think in his hair or whatever. It's this British Cologne and he fucking, he smells fucking amazing. He smells amazing. How food also smelled good, but it never smells good on me. I buy it and I just smell like garbage.

Speaker 2:          21:46          How do you know I can, I smell it on myself and I'm like, it stinks. I thought you can't really smell yourself. Oh yeah, the Cologne. You can, I put it on and it's great for a minute. And I put like, sure. I'm like, oh, suck it. I said, yeah, but that's self hatred. No, but I, I don't, I never get compliments on it. And no one's ever said, hey, you smell great. And that like, you know, when Ozzie walks you, people like you fucking smell. That's the first thing I noticed about, first time I met him was with Jim Florentine in [inaudible] 97 and the first thing that struck me is this guy smells amazing. They're not getting enough ass. You know what I mean? They've got a shell like Jesus Christ. That's where you got to fucking send your wife into the next room. Yeah, go get some.

Speaker 2:          22:20          You host that shit off of you police so I can still be married at the end of this. How funny is it that he just, you know, he had the whole thing with shower where you get caught having the affair and he's not, I loved the damage control. Ozzie does it in an interview. He's like, well, I'm a fucking, I'm in a fucking band. Or No, like that's his reasoning. Like what do you expect now that that was the greatest? That's something you say to your friends though. You don't say that in an interview after you play. My fucking said that I am too for if it doesn't get them divorced, I'm happy. He said, look, I fucking, do you mind if fucking people that aren't in his position that can easily sit back, you know you'll fucking life is, you're not in a band.

Speaker 2:          22:54          You don't have all these women fucking throwing themselves at you. You're like, what the fuck is he supposed to do? I know. I know. But you how to use, you're like a grounded guy. Like I really mean that. Like I look at you, you're married, you have a baby and like you, you're a fucking booze gym that's in the green room until everybody leaves. And I boost theory. Really? Yeah, I admire, I sit there and I just tell stories with people. They bring a bottle in and I'm with like four or five of them. I did it the last night. I was just in a, what the fuck was, I stand up live in Phoenix and they brought it to have this bottle for us and for three days we just would, you know, taking a third, a third and a third and by last night, you know, we'd just sitting in there, I go to cigar bars.

Speaker 2:          23:34          I just basically go. But dude, I always used to look like fucking Ralph mouth too. So it was never really a problem. You know what I mean? That wasn't like a fucking like Geraldo rest his soul. I mean that guy was like a fucking great in those, those guys, if you're funny. And he had a, he had like a, I also always had like a really, you know, angry fucking energy. So like most women who had even remotely had a decent father or maybe an uncle that they spoke to had a nice conversation once would be running for the hills. And I would get these absolute fucking lunatics that would come up to me. And um, you know, so it kind of took care of itself to be honest with you. It is scary when you meet women and like to girls you dated first or for awhile when you realize I represent something to her.

Speaker 2:          24:16          Like I'm an average looking God. And there's some girls I've dated who are better, lot better looking than I deserved. And I knew that there were mental things and I'm like, I represent something weird to her. It's a father, a mouthful of shame. I would say that, you know, it's a monster rain. I mean the names of your, it's very, uh, I think you've carved out quite a niche for you. Yeah. You know, I got, I figured, I gotta be honest because I once other girl tried to blackmail me, I had to go and try to blackmail me one time. She had no idea who I was. And we had hooked up a few times. Yeah. It was a money thing, not a big expense. We had texts, a lot of dirty fantasies, and then she wanted me to send her money. She's tried to blackmail me and I'm like, well, I'll send you money to help you with this, but I'm not doing it that.

Speaker 2:          24:53          And she goes, well, maybe all your friends would want to see your fantasies played out on Facebook. And I'm like, you really don't know who you're talking to. And I, and I, I texted, I said, I don't give a fuck. Everybody who I know knows what I'm liking what I do. Uh, at that moment I was grateful to be me. Yeah. You gotta be what, when you put it all out there and you know, they can't catch it. It's nothing funny. You're one of the fun, I wish that was a scene in a movie watching somebody's thinking that they can blackmail somebody and they just completely don't give a shit. Do that. How am I going to say the guy's name? But that happened to a hockey player. He was like in his forties and he, um, Oh yes. Yeah. He hooked up with some like 1,989 it was legal at everything and she's just like, I'm going to tweet this out, you know, if you don't, blah, blah, blah.

Speaker 2:          25:37          He goes, what? Then I slept with a smoking hot chick. Half my age. He goes, God and do it. I don't give a fuck. And she did. Sometimes they will. They will at times do it. She said she was gonna. He said he didn't care. She did. And he didn't give a fuck and nobody else did. Oh my God, this guy did something illegal. Yeah. She really didn't have like a leg to stand. He did what we'd all love to do. Shame on him. Good for him. But, but if you're married, if you got killed, you know, there's so many guys that they like, I heard a lot of rappers get like girls will, you know a special ladies, a lot of rappers you know are, are, are a little on the DL as they say about certain things and uh, they get blackmailed a lot.

Speaker 2:          26:14          Like I've heard a lot. A lot of times the girls will go, yeah, I want a $30,000 I'm going to start fucking screaming in the lobby. And there's been times of that stuff has worked. It's a shame Jesus. He can't just go, go ahead, go screaming the lobby's stupid. Well you know what, if everyone was like me, you could and you like I wouldn't, I wouldn't give a shit. I was like that's what kills me. Like whenever a, a controversy like that comes out, like I like you were talking about that guy with the massage therapist and all that stuff. I always just think like I cannot fucking wait to go to his next movie just to make type of shit go away

Speaker 1:          26:44          cause right to support it. Yeah. Cause even the worst case scenario is they did something where they just fucked up. They fucked up. What am I saying? The guy goes on the road, he banks, you know, fucks around and his wife every that's between them. Does that mean I don't like that song any better? I those fucking people who do that shit. Well they just go like, Oh fuck that guy. I'm done with this movie. Rarely get done with those movies. I'm done with this movie's when his movies suck. You know, if he's, if he's not out there, you know, they'll say, fucking people will still going to mass every Sunday. The Catholic church, it wasn't everybody. It's like, is that really what you're thinking? That's just your fear of dying and not knowing where you go when you die and you don't want to piss off the invisible guy.

Speaker 1:          27:24          Right. My buddy, my brother said it the best. He goes, it's talking about the Catholic Church. He goes, dude, if that was any other fucking business, they would be shut down. Fucking shut down. I'm, I, I'm still on, and I think of this a lot, but the fact that you don't believe in name calling, I've thought that a lot, like how negative it is and bad it is. And it's something, and not that I've had cause to, cause I'm single at this point, but can an interrelationship with the woman. I've never done the Europe fucking bitch and blah, and I would never have thought. And, but hearing you say that it's the, yeah, I guess it really is a damaging thing to just do it. I can't kick because it builds up, it builds up resentment because people don't forget, like, uh, I got this weird thing.

Speaker 1:          28:05          If my wife goes, you know, you're a fucking asshole. I don't care. I know other guys that would be like, you know, you like that would actually, it would hurt him in a way that they will as a man. They wouldn't want to admit I don't give a shit. Um, but like I, I, I saw enough guys growing up doing that you fucking bitch thing and everything like that. And I just, I just, I saw what that did. Uh, I was a little kid and just saw it. I just saw it. It just, it didn't look, you know, this big deep voice yelling at, you know, it just was not, it just, I, I dunno. So I just made a vow is just one of those things. I was like, you know what, I'm not doing that. But then there was other stupid behavior that I guess I didn't recognize them then I repeated that, but that was the one that, that I, I didn't do.

Speaker 1:          28:46          So what we do, she calls you an asshole. You just tell me about what she's doing is if I go real mature, I wish I had the presence of mind ice. I, uh, what, what do I do? I, you know, I definitely say the f word a lot, but I don't, um, you know what, now that I have a daughter, so I really, I just, I don't do that. I'm not gonna fucking sit there and screaming. You can't. Yeah. When there's a baby in the room, change that we can stay on. My radio partner just had a baby and it's, see everybody I know is having kids, it gets, it changes the way you do shit. Right? Yeah. Because then there's that whole, uh, I think for the first time in your life, you're actually aware of your behavior affecting other people. Right. With, you know, with your girlfriend or your wife.

Speaker 1:          29:30          It's an adult to adult thing. So you really don't, you're like, oh, this person is an adult. They can drive a car. You know, I can say this stuff, this isn't going to affect them, you know, but it's when you have the kid and, and it's just like, you know, that this could actually affect who they marry, right? Oh yeah. This guy that literally, you know, if I do what I'm, you know, if I flip out right now and I consistently do this, this could literally drive my daughter to a trailer park someday. Right. You know, and, and be one thing, if I was just completely oblivious that I could just sit at a bar, Go, now she's a fucking loser. Get Out. She grew up in a house. Now she said a thing, but I am kind of aware of the effect of it now and then I would have to sit there and take on that kind of guilt.

Speaker 1:          30:12          So, um, plus, I don't know. I, I don't, um, uh, just growing up there was a lot of just the era when I grew up, like every authority authority person was just so not approachable as I said this and this is what it is and you shut the fuck up. And it was that just, you know, that's kind of what stoke the whole fire in me, I think. So I try to, uh, you know, I think you go one of two ways. You either repeated or you just remember that. So like, um, I actually got a really good comment from somebody one time. It's like, you know what? He goes, Mike, you should got to come by. Come by my house. He goes, my kids love you. And I was like, really? He goes, yeah. He goes, they, you talk to them like they're adults.

Speaker 1:          30:49          I wasn't even aware I was doing it. Like I would be talking to like is a 10 year old, right. Do you, what grade are you in? Are you getting homework now? Ah, that sucked. The hated that. Like I wasn't thinking that I was and they kind of liked it that they were talking to adult like, oh this is, this is somebody older who they think knows everything he's saying how he hated it. Kinda gave him making it. It made it okay to be like, oh this sucks man. I hope that did make them not do their fucking homework but I would just, you know, I would address it rather than being like, no, you need to sit down, you need to learn it. This is what life is. It's sitting there doing shit get, don't want to do like that's so much that you learn that, that you like, you don't think that you can actually go out and achieve shit and like life becomes like fuck, when is this over just staring at an

Speaker 2:          31:30          cock and people saying that, I think hepatitis don't even mean it. They just think it should. An adult as supposed to stay, like to say like, you know what I mean? Can you sit out, you buckled down your throat, you lie. If I said that to anybody, I would entirely be on shut up. You don't fucking believe that I cannot wait to tell my daughter. I don't know. I cannot wait to tell it. Why is this blah blah blah. And I'll just, I dunno. I Dunno. Why be like, well you know, cause I don't read. Why? I don't know cause it makes me sleepy. I'm just going to fuck brutal honesty. I'm just gonna own up to it. There's a lot of stuff. Your dad isn't good at sweetheart. Do you want some ice cream? Yeah. Cause you want [inaudible] I'm in the middle. Like I, you know, I'm in a point where I'm 48 no wife, no girlfriend. Like I, you know, I don't know if I'm, if I'm the best boyfriend candidate by, I'm tired of being single. Like I'm, I'm kind of, oh, there you go. That's where I think of it. You got it

Speaker 1:          32:14          sick of it, right? Yeah. I got a no, you know what I did was I finally, I just looked at like what I was doing and then, you know, we have to like, I used to joke about that on stage. I feel like the 90th fucking person that doesn't go well and there's only so long you been doing these chicks are fucking psychos after a while. It's like, what am I doing? Okay

Speaker 2:          32:33          dude, I chase him away in tech. I've had some updated literally for I lose in text message. Oh, I'm so, I'm so like I want to either talk dirty or I just, I just want to keep pushing the envelope and the next thing you know, um, they stopped talking to me so I know I'm doing something wrong. It's not that then him not talk it over. I'm just creeping them out on some level. I don't know why. That just reminded me this last night I was watching, uh, what does that fucking show with Andy Cohen when he does the wrap ups of the, uh, the real housewives. Oh, I'm not a his talk shows. Look what happens live. Yes. That show that one. So my wife always watches that show. That's one of those crossovers shows I have to watch what they're, so we don't battle over the TV.

Speaker 2:          33:13          Right, right, right. So I'm watching, it was Jennifer Lopez and I'm, oh Jesus Christ, and just went blank on his, uh, Ray Liotta Dude, ray Liotta was fucking hilarious. He just answers eight doesn't give a shit. He just answered everything straight up, straight up. They were like, what? So for cocaine, like in Goodfellas, like what did they use? And it was like cocaine just to say that. And they would be like, who's the most, they played this thing, you can plead the fifth. And He, oh yeah, he never, he never pleaded. The fifth would ask him. They asked him like, uh, Oh, who's the worst kisser of, of anybody? Easy you've been with this person. But I suppose first and you know, Andy's doing all the things. So who was the worst kisser? Like this was going to be the thing. He goes, uh, well, I don't think I kissed any of them.

Speaker 2:          33:58          And he goes, well then who would you guess? And he goes, oh, Sigourney weaver. Just setting. They go, who's the worst actor, most overrated actor or the 90s? And he goes, most overrated. He goes bad. I'd probably say Clint Eastwood. And then somebody mumbled, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. But he's shown, he turns around, he goes, I don't know, give a shit. It's just like he is kind of untouchable at this point. He Israeli Yoda, he gets no, but it was real. It wasn't found to be dangerous. He literally goes, I don't give a shit. I don't give a shit. I don't give a shit. I'm fucking, I'm Ray Liotta. And by the way, I, I am, I don't give a shit what a brilliant game that is. Plead the fifth on one of these three questions. Then what it'll do, it was then it would then pass it over to you and then you got to, you know, and it's all this, this, uh, you know, he does all the squirming questions.

Speaker 2:          34:46          He was asking like Jennifer Lopez. Okay. When you, you know, how many, you've been proposed to five times, did you? Who did you say no to? And she's a nice person. Doesn't want to say it. And Ray Liotta was just sitting there going, just plead the fifth on this. I'll answer something like he just completely didn't give a shit or two of them together. Yeah. Cause they're on that cop show together. Oh, you know, it's fine. I auditioned for that. Uh, I did. Yeah, I did. Doug Davidoff got the part and he lazy. He, I think he's better for that than I am anyway. Not just acting ability, but you know, he looked more of the part of uh, a kind of a slick like internal affairs guy if that's what you got. I didn't know Doug was on that shit. Hey. Yeah, he's got a good party part. Radioed into the comedy cellar one night. Um, but you know, if I'm not going to get it, I'd rather see somebody I like yet.

Speaker 2:          35:31          That's great. Seen a glimpse of what your life would have been cool. Hanging on Ray Liotta that would have been fun. How it had been kind of Nice. Jim, you're are next. What should they say about you? Yeah. You know, she'd going up, sorry, was my bad STM. Like, like she announces you before you go on, but I understood what you're saying. Oh look, as bad as that joke was everybody, uh, Chuck Norris and special is going to be the opposite of that mouthful of shame. I, it's so stupid. I keep going back to this. When people listen to a podcast, it's not like they can, there's no right, there's no commercials coming in front, but I just feel like I have to keep going back to March 14th in case you forget, because then they got to rewind and try to remember where and when. Of course we'll probably tweet it out.

Speaker 2:          36:09          And I did love Netflix too. I've never done anything with them before. I know you've done a bunch of stuff with them, but they're so easy. They're like, all right, just put it together. I mean, Robbie had a couple of minor suggestions. They don't overly manage you. It was like fucking great. It was so nice to do it. And I'm actually happy with it. Like, you know, you shoot something, you this one, I actually feel it's dirtier than I kind of intended and wait to next time you go to Australia, now that it's on Netflix, like you'll sell tickets. You can help someone. I'm going to a you. I told you you inspire me completely to to do, I'm only doing this stuff because you got in my head and I hear bill burn my fucking head all the time. God, what are you waiting for it?

Speaker 2:          36:44          And I'm like, I got to do it. I really do. It's like, but you are right now. Watch. I'll stop selling tickets and then I'll be like, you're watching David off coming into a place. I'll be watching you sell it out. The fucking, what does that thing in Sydney, the Opera House and I'll be like, I used to do that. I, I, you know it's funny, I did one show there. It was a TV taping. No, was, it was a TV taping and something else. And I enjoyed city. Melbourne was good, but Sydney was really good and I'm like, like Melbourne and a little bit better. You did? Yeah, I got that park was fun cause I landed there and was Australia day and everybody was just fucking getting hammered and shit. So I was like, hey this, this country is, I didn't go to Perth. I didn't go.

Speaker 2:          37:20          What was your first time through is great in Perth is the Bon Scott. Oh, buried there. They got the stats. Show you pictures of that. Yeah, we did it. We went to the Bond Scott Wall and Melbourne. It was like in one of the things someone painted a tribute while in the bond. Scott, you know it's Bon Scott because it says ac DC. But if it didn't you'd be like, you know, or say say acadeca down there. I don't know why. Oh, do they really? Yeah. And then what does, what does burger can call down there? I don't remember a fucking cheese. Yeah. No, it's something. No, cause somebody down there actually had already had a burger king and he sued the corporation and the, what the fuck is it? You're looking it up, Jonathan. Um, did you sell tickets when you first went through the first time? No.

Speaker 2:          38:01          No, I think I did. Uh, the first time I went out there, it was like an old four and I did something for comedy central and we flew in from New York, so it was like six hours to five and a half to la and then lay over and then 14 hours and uh, you land, they let you sleep a little bit and then it's like, it's already the next day and then we taped it and then the next day you supposed to go back was so fucking nuts. So I was just like, well fuck that. I'm going to stay here for a few days. Hungry, Hungry Jacks. That's right. Hungry Jacks. Okay. That means nothing to anybody listening to this. But I thought it was cool. Um,

Speaker 1:          38:36          and I just hung out there and I bought all these ACDC albums on CD that, you know, the original like, like was t and t. I used to know the names of the, like t and t was the original album that then became high voltage, but their version had like dirty deeds on it, which later became its own album, became an EAP over here. So we went, you know, I bought like all these, you know, cause I got a big family so I just bought them for my brothers and sisters. Oh that's cool. Yeah. And uh, drove around and saw the apostles and just driving on the other side of the road was really fucked up. And anytime I went to take a turn, like the joke was I would just pretend that I wanted to kill myself and then I would actually make the right decision.

Speaker 1:          39:11          Cause everything else, it doesn't even make sense. You like, what the fuck? This makes no sense. Especially when you're, um, when you make a right turn and you're sitting, you're sitting on, on the passenger's side and you got to go wide. You like, what the fuck can you just picture like a semi. But late at night when I came out, I didn't know where the fuck I was at. I was with this other comic, one of those comics, I was from like Scotland or some shit, an ex patriot and I just met him and I never saw him again. But uh, we got on the road with no street lights and drove probably maybe eight, 900 feet and the same time we both went like, oh shit. Oh Shit. And got over it. But there was nobody coming. Right. We definitely was starting to go up a hill.

Speaker 1:          39:51          So yeah, I'm sure people get car service when you're out there. And Jimmy, that's what I'm trying ubered when I was there and the openers there, it was great. But I'm also going to Norway and I think I'm doing something to Scandinavian and I've never been to any of these places. I'm doing all of them. That whole run through, uh, Oslow Helsinki, Stockholm dude the best. But they said those are just places that, you know, as an American to actually go there. I mean I think he got to be like, either you're either in the Illuminati or you'll like a downhill skier or some shit. Cause other than that, you're not going to go there as far as, it's just not on our radar to go there. Beautiful countries and the people are, the people are great. Do you fly in and out the [inaudible] can I have sleep apnea and I fucking, I take Dramamine to fly.

Speaker 1:          40:31          Like I came this morning from Portland, so I'm like, I'm very loopy and I'm tired and you just do a show that night and then fly out the next morning. I can't, there was a, um, I'm panicking about that. What I do is I turn it into like a paid vacation. So, um, what I do is I fly over there and I either do the tour and then I meet my wife afterwards or other times I've done it like just because of our schedules that work out. Like, all right, let's do the vacation first. Um, and then not only will I be rested, I'll be, you know, talking about to acclimate at that time and that type of thing. So I've done both. But uh, you know, there's all, you know, I build a window, it build a of shit around sporting events and stuff. Like, you know what I wanted to go to this year.

Speaker 1:          41:16          I, I don't think it's going to work out though, but I was going to go to that. There's this motorcycle race on the Isle of Man, which is an island between Britain and Ireland home saying that, right? A fucking whales, whatever the fuck you want to call it. Um, and it's just this fucking motorcycle race that's just like, I mean more people have died than years. They've had it. It's just they go on like fucking 200 miles an hour down these country roads and shit and they go, go. I come blazing through town. I mean it's like if you love the beginning of the last mad max, this is like the closest you're going to see to the real version of it. I mean, these guys are fucking lunatics. Like they know that going so fast and it's his little ass country roads and this like stone walls and shit and trees like you're dead.

Speaker 1:          41:58          And pedestrians are getting killed once in a while too. I'm actually surprised that so many people stand so close that my only nervousness about it as how can I get high up enough to see a little bit more of it. Right. Because I'm worried that it's just going to be like, you know, I'm going to stay fly halfway around the world. Just see and then stand there for like another fucking 20 minutes because they go by that fucking fat and that's it. Yeah. I went to the Daytona 500 we were on the infield on like, like this little building so I could actually stand and kind of watch them go all the way around. Um, but like if you just stand, the first time I went to the Indy 500 I was just, you're just in a corner and it just becomes this drinking game and everybody's bed on like four different cars and you just pray to God there's going to be an accident or some shit in front of you.

Speaker 1:          42:45          Right. Just something interesting. Yeah. And it's actually really amazing the first time you see it and you actually hear this tire skid like a real accident. You're like, oh yeah, I guess it is a car. For some reason I never thought it would sound like that. But the thing is that going so fast as they'll hit the wall in front of you and then the debris just they fly down. We've seen the accident. Yeah, I saw like I hit a wall in front of me one time, but it's like it's, he hits it in front of you and by the time your brain reacts to what that is is he's already a quarter mile away. It's not like they hit it and just stop. Do you watch like boxing and MMA cause you such as sports care, do you watch uh, combat sports or no? Yeah, I keep going in and out of MMA.

Speaker 1:          43:18          It, it's like to pencil my road schedule where it's like, you know, I work a lot on Saturday night and if a couple months goes by and I keep missing the fights, I hate it. But it's a big thing that me and my wife too, like she fucking loves it. The shit like UFC dude, she's old. She's almost embarrassing. Like she gets up and yells at the TV. Oh Great. She totally gets into it. When Anderson Silver, like had the compound fracture of his leg. I was like, oh my God, look in a way, and she has this weird thing where maybe she should have gotten the medical field because she was, it wasn't like she was happy it happened. She was just more fascinated by what it looked like and was just like, good Lord. Oh, I was called. That's like the, uh, when they break that fucking thing, that's like, you ever see like a little kid put on like his dad's rain boot straps on the side and just folds up.

Speaker 1:          44:01          Like I can't, I cannot look at it. I was at that fight. That was their second fight. That was a, nobody knew what happened. Like until the replay, you just saw him fall and then the replay played the whole place was like, oh, it was her. That was a horrible, but he's still kicking. He's still using that leg. He just thought I heard when you break the bone or it doesn't come back stronger, some weird reason, they might have strengthened it with metal. I heard it was a pretty clean break. Here we go. We're going into the best. We don't have to make it stronger. How you heard they did metal [inaudible] we don't know, but he's able to fight with it, but it's just give

Speaker 2:          44:32          answers chuck, why it happened. I remember over hearing somebody say that and I never did any background check on them and had gone to one of the fights. Yes. Yes I did. What does that, oh, is that the picture of him going by on the stretcher? Jesus Christ. Jim, you look like you're in a fucking band. Dude. I got to tell you, this guy took this weight off. What? Two, three years ago? And you've kept it off. What are you doing? I just just eating in the gym. Just that. That really is it. But when did you find that? Because you were a, you weren't those up and down. It was awful. It's just that moment of clarity. I was like, Ugh, just so much fucking self disgust. What were you eating and where were you when you, when you finally were just like, I can't do this anymore? You know, I really don't remember. I do remember is going to the gym and going, I am going to go. I was fucking, I was just sick of like when you feel it in your back above your belt, that little bit of fucking fat. It's just soft. Like a little lamb. I started getting the uh, the effort noises, putting on socks.

Speaker 2:          45:35          I was just like, Oh God. And becoming that guy. So I just like, uh, this last trip I just had, I got off the road two days ago now I've just been, it's so funny. I literally just two days of not eating burger king or steak and shake and I never, I just kind of fell into this. I think it was just because of the lack of sleep I've been getting and just going out on the road and then having to do the shows and the pressure putting together the new hour. I just spent under a lot of stress and I've just been like last second, Oh fuck, I'm hungry. Let's go here. I don't give a shit. Just stuff this in me and fill up the hole. And it just was a, yeah. So La is dangerous for me because I go, this is what a fucking fruit I'm turning into Jonathan and I will word it is a great one.

Speaker 2:          46:18          Fucking fruit. We eat. Uh, I like eating Sushi here, but then we go to the yogurt stop on Santa Monica. But I didn't go on that for years. They think we're a complex. My favorite place in the world is the fucking yogurt stop on Santa Monica. I love where is that? It's on Santa Monica by rage West Hollywood. Get get, get, get a Mike. I know you're just talking to Jonathan. Forgot. God. Put it on. Put It on the fucking head. Can you just speak into thinner at Brownstein? Everybody. Oh, hello? Yeah, Jonathan. Well who was very instrumental when we first started doing the Patrice O'Neal benefit. That's right. Please help me get in touch with all the guys and everything like that. And uh, it's an amazing thing. It's still going on. It's incredible. Yeah. Just like she knew how much Nah, no, no. It was Maureen Taren Morin's flooring.

Speaker 2:          46:57          Taryn deals with all the infrastructure and uh, the herd of add that is booking a bunch of comedians through it. It's like literally, it's like you got 12 cows just fucking, I guess what, what runs cows don't run. You got 10 you got 10 fucking things that run there will go in a different direction and things that run all going in different directions. But February 21st that normally would and this right? Yeah we kind of, we kind of know it's going to be in February now. Yeah. Now she lets us know in enough advanced and that's why we do it Tuesday cause sometimes fans go, why the fuck is this on a Tuesday night? It's cause guys

Speaker 1:          47:30          are working for free. And this is what, that's the day when comedians are, uh, are in town. So, uh, next year, uh, I already know like one of the guys out here every year, we try to like maybe fly somebody in and uh, we got an idea of possibly who are going to try to use it next year. But, uh, it's been a great thing because I just hate like, you know, like when someone passes away, like with unfortunately we're at that age, you know, and where you had that one time benefit and you're like, okay, here's your sack of cash, good luck for the next 40 years. And it's, um, you know, he was taking care of those people. So it's, it's definitely been a great thing. So, and the thing about it, I said, here's the, and I think of there's too this year is that it's the fifth annual one.

Speaker 1:          48:09          I've officially done this four more times and Patrice would've done it for me this year, I think might've been this shoe. I thought it was the perfect combination of a great mix of people. The ball breaking was on a whole other fucking level. And then, uh, when Leslie Jones told that portray story, oh my God, it was just fucking know dude. The shit that you said when to Keith and Keith Robinson, Keith Robinson, Keith unfortunately, uh, suffered a mild stroke, uh, wasn't moment coming up on two years ago, was it? No, I'll say less than a year. Yeah, a year and a year ago. And um, he's of course now he's doing like someone funniest shit or whatever. So Jim, when he out-tro to me it goes, keep it going for Keith Robinson. He should had a stroke 15 years ago. The place fucking dies laughing and then your other one was like a, well, it's funny is even after a stroke, Keith is easier to understand than rich vos.

Speaker 1:          49:05          How is it, I don't know how you followed it with the rest of your jokes, but yeah, people like the attacks on each other that, that's always a crowd favorite. You had one way, you said, I think Colin came after you and you said, uh, he's here, he's a, has to be back at men's Wearhouse soon. He was wearing a suit that night and it was bosses awful hat this year. And Pete Davidson kept telling him the truth going to look awful. I'm like, Pete, that's not how this game works. Tell them it looks good and you wait till it goes out on stage. Yeah. You don't try to discourage them. You wait until he's on and then you fucking attack them in front of the entire theater. Was another, another one. That's the first time we had him and he came out and he was trashing Voss has had, I think they actually may make fun of us as the old guys. Um, I, yeah, I think that, but then vos leveled him. Pete Pete Talks about his dad died on that 11 and voice had the one good thing is that of uh, uh, the Pete's dad didn't have to seem in that blouse and he's saying he would have thrown himself in another fire.

Speaker 1:          50:02          Oh yeah. That, fuck. Oh my God. They're terrible. Sweater, head artsy golden girl's sweater that was going to wear. Yeah, that was really bad. It was really, really shitty. I wanted to make fun of it, but I knew I didn't like it. I'm like, you're on a TV show. You're, you're fucking good looking young guy and if you dress slightly of feminine, it's like you're not getting enough pussy. So I knew that that's what I was going to come out. And I was like, I can't come at him. You know, the potential was wrong. I knew that I was just, uh, an old man

Speaker 2:          50:28          getting jealous, you know, now I had to, Rosa just showed up and that then I, I would've, I mean, the sweater on by itself should have been burned. It was brutal. It was, it was bad. But you know, you knew the reasons for attacking it would have been more. Yeah. It's not one of those fucking guys remember those, those all those people that Madonna used to fucking sell Ho in New York City, those Charlie Bean Beneatha's, those artists. Yeah. He looked like he fucking, when he dies his artwork, it was going to be worth something. Yeah. Like a young, uh, I can't, I haven't got bused yachts. Yeah, the young guy of age. It's all I'm thinking of. Yeah. I don't like any of those guys because it always makes me feel foolish because everybody looks at this shit like it's fucking amazing. And like one of the, uh, I dunno, like the two ways when I always know that I'm a dope was when I tried to read out loud bat and when I go to a museum, because I mean, you want to just talk about flatlining emotionally and it just, it means not dude.

Speaker 2:          51:19          I went, when I went to Paris, I went into a little lube. I could not get out of there fast enough. I was like literally almost shouting at people. Like, where is it? Where is the fucking, where's the Mona Lisa so I can look at it and get the fuck out of here. And you get out of it. And there's all these people just, you know, just creating like a ledge with their other hand and then fucking holding their chin out with the other one. And I was, I just sort of, I peered over like it was the presidential motorcade driving by and I saw that was it. Did it move you and give a fuck. The only thing that was cool as it's been recreated so many times and be like, that's the actual one. And Dude, I saw the Sistine Chapel, I couldn't be off fucking small.

Speaker 2:          52:00          It was, I think the guy was dogging it. I mean it's saint. It took them that fucking long walked in. I literally was like, this is it. And somebody went shoo, shoo, like shushed me. I'll tell you what would be on inspiring. And they recently dug up Christ's tomb and the church and they had to do something that they know where he's buried. They know where the, suppose the tomb of Christ. They do know. Yeah. She just fucking, Al Capone's vault is shroud of Turin. It probably is bullshit, but I mean it is in Catholicism. They do kind of Riviera, it's somewhere in Jerusalem I guess. But these guys had to go down and they were doing some kind of maintenance work on it, which they had to be done on the lid over the tomb. But I'm like, that would probably get me like, Ooh, this is a pretty important place.

Speaker 2:          52:46          But the art museums do nothing for me. I did see the Washington crossing the Delaware painting. It's fucking massive. It's probably the size of this room and I always in the Metropolitan Museum of art, that was kind of always the, well, I would rather look at that shit. Then something like abstract. Yeah, me too. It looked like you rolled a baby and paint and just fucking threw it. Yeah. Canvas. I liked, I went to the van Gogh one when wherever were the fuck whatever country that's an, I went to that and I actually liked that one and it's not because he's a fellow fucking red head. It was just, I actually would like with Netherlands. Yeah. How about uh, I like a Norman Rockwell. You sure it's not in Denmark? Copenhagen? I thought it was Amsterdam,

Speaker 1:          53:26          but maybe it could be the whole way. You're addressing me, lets me know. I know, I know that you're right. Initials on his shirt. He gives like the air of authority, but half of the times he knows what he's talking about. Half the times he does. Oh, this is that what you have your initials right there? Yeah. That's very unique. And the Taylor's, is that near your run, your pancreas? Is that why you put it there? I thought you did it on the cuff link on the cuffs. There's two styles. You can do it. The cuff. You can do it here. You can. What is that and what does that style? I don't know. I've always had it here though, so I dunno. The Taylor that I got this made yet. He did it there. Yeah. This is a true gentleman. Yeah, the train. I can tell how difficult you are as a client because I know when you're not around, his shirt is untucked.

Speaker 1:          54:05          Yeah. He said he's getting a little rock and roll because I'm in town. He's, there's chicks to talk to get them to the Greek. All right, well coming up on an hour here at Jim, I'm, you know, I'm such a fucking huge fan of you and I always tell you this dude, I owe so much of the tickets that I sell to on the road that you were generous when you got a lot of guys would have got that opie and Anthony Gig and they would've kept the fucking door closed and you let us all run in. So, uh, I want to thank you. Well, you know, you can see I'm blowing all my money on footlocker tee shirts here now, but you do do it well. Deservedly like you're a great comic and I don't mean it's not like, yeah, I just taught my compliment with a compliment.
