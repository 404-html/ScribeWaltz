Speaker 1:          00:00:02       Hey, what's going on? It's bill burr and this is the Thursday afternoon, Monday morning podcast. Just before Friday afternoon. And okay. Just checking it on you. What's going on for July 2nd, 2015 happy birthday to America. Happy Birthday too. Woo Woo America. Happy Birthday, Uncle Sam, me happy birthday

Speaker 2:          00:00:38       to you.

Speaker 1:          00:00:39       Go Fuck Yourself. All right. It's, it's just, it's, it's the fucking birthday of this country. And you know what that means, right? You get out there and your true, you get yourself a bag old barker,

Speaker 1:          00:00:54       undo your fucking top button and most of your zipper let that belly but it walk around. I'll tell you what, 4th of July in Los Angeles I will tell you is like no other place seriously. Like they, they, it's an absolute fucking free for all. You can shoot off essentially whatever the fuck you want, wherever you want, regardless of safety. And uh, we are now in the fourth year evidently of the drought and I knew that we were having water issues. I didn't realize that it was the fourth year because a, either I wasn't paying attention or raw, they're finally starting to report on it. So it is dry as can be, you know.

Speaker 3:          00:01:39       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:01:39       Dry is a fucking white guys torso. Um, anyways, so I am predicting, once again, last year was the first time, you know, I go up, I go up on the roof, I go up on the roof and I watched the fireworks. You know, I fucking put a little lawn chair down. This is the end of the day, right? And I just sit up there and I smoke a cigar and I have my fucking, my Miller high life plural. Exactly. I have a hell of a time getting back down because there's, you know, the only way to get up on the roof is by a ladder. Right. So, um, but I just sit up there and I just, I just watch all of them going off. And uh, I think it was last year. The year before was the first time I saw it. I saw some something, basically fireworks show Worthy Litton Lid off by just some jackass.

Speaker 1:          00:02:30       On a street that has a bunch of palm trees and apartment buildings. And I saw it explode and it started to go out and then it started to go up again and we were all standing up. They're going to set on fire is that fucking place on fire? Fortunately was right around the block from the fire station and I gotta Tell Ya, I gotta hand it to the a l La f d the fire department, that fucking thing caught on fire there. There uh, sirens came on within the minute and they were over there. The whole thing was done within like swear to God, two or three minutes, which was incredible. And I couldn't tell from where I was at if it was a, a, a tree or what don't. I just sound like the awful reporter on site. No, I don't know if that's a tree, if it's an apartment or a Parthenon, but whatever it is, it is definitely on fire.

Speaker 1:          00:03:16       Back to you, Chad. Thank you. Wilamena she's a new addition. Transgender, transgender ginger from Massachusetts. Will Amena Bird. Wilamena wa. We just want to say how much we support what you are doing. Um, anyways, uh, so I got him, oh, did I get into with somebody? I think I had some good shows this week. There was no fucking problems. You know, it was just said to that couple last week that got offended when I got mad. And I use that word that I should have said, well what if I said this word, which was a different bad word for another group of people. You know, it's funny you wouldn't of got offended and you'd be standing here, slapped me on my back saying what a funny edgy show it was. Oh, Billy, you still not over it now I'm not. I'm not. So anyways, I'm going to do a little bit of grilling this weekend and uh, got some family over here seeing all the pressure right.

Speaker 1:          00:04:09       You take out your grill, you gotta make sure you fucking, you're doing it right. Not like Versie. He'll just let anybody jump on his fucking grill. Maybe that's the genius of [inaudible]. I don't know, but I'm going simple this year. I was going to do the whole fucking pork shoulder and all that and I just been so fucking busy. I'm like, you know what, at the end of the day, how drunk people are going to be. Did they really need anything more than fucking burgers and hot dogs? I remember one year for the Rose Bowl, j law had smoked a pork shoulder, which evidently was delicious, but by the time he took it out I was so shit faced. I had already started my cigar, like the meal had already happened. So then he gave it to me and I was sitting in a fucking lawn chair with a beer in one hand, a cigar in the other and I was trying to figure out how to set down one or the other so I could pick at it. It was an absolute shit show. So I don't know what, why go through that effort?

Speaker 1:          00:05:01       I didn't what the fuck I'm talking about. So anyways, I'm happy 4th of July to everybody and I hope you have a, even if you're around the world and it doesn't mean shit to you, you know what I mean? Like, I had never heard of Cinco de Mayo until I came out here to la. And I actually asked the classic White Guy Question, what day is Cinco de Mayo? For those of you who are like me, that basically means in Spanish it means 5th of May. It's like the 4th of July and say what does the 4th of July? That's what, that's what I was, I was that person. Well actually no, because I didn't say the whole thing in Spanish. So that'd be a 4th of July, right, bill? We get it. We get it. So anyways, um, being a lover of all things old, uh, one of the frustrations of that is every day, you know, something happens.

Speaker 1:          00:05:53       I have my old truck, 68 f 100 and I have my old house, which was made in the 19 fucking twenties. And uh, if it's not one thing, it's a fuck another. And some days it's both. Like today I started my day, I had to go do some, um, look at some of the writing. Some of the drawings for F is for family by the way, which is coming out in December. We got three episodes, three episodes in. It's a serialized, um, series, meaning basically each, you know, they don't stand alone like the Simpsons. So this is going to be like, uh, it's going to be like watching true detective, except it's a cartoon and it's not as gritty. I don't know how to describe it. I think it's going to be fucking funny. So I went down there today to go look at, so I got my truck and um,

Speaker 3:          00:06:39       yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:06:40       and I don't know what happened this morning. I come down and stay at me because I left it on a hill. And you gearheads know this. I had my tarp in the, on the, uh, passenger's side floor and I go to take out the top. I need to wash it anyways, so I didn't have it on my truck. As I get my truck wash and I throw the top one, then it gets dirty. So long fucking story. So, um,

Speaker 1:          00:07:01       I go to pick it up and it's covered in like not covered, but it's, there's a bunch of antifreeze leaked out from underneath the, from the dashboard, uh, area. Now I know I have, the way the heating system works, I have a heater coil right behind my glove box that I had to replace it. I don't know if, I don't know why any that'd be antifreeze in there. I have no fucking idea. I don't really understand the coolest system belong beyond what it does for the, the engine block. But anyways, there it was, it was all of that. And I hadn't watered up when a time I realized it was on the tarp. I already headed against my shirt and my pants. I had a light pair of gray pants on and I was just like, yeah, you know what? Fuck it. So I toss that thing aside and I go to work and I'm joking with people laugh and I go, I've got a brand new fucking engine in there.

Speaker 1:          00:07:47       Like, how, how could I have a fucking problem? You know why? Because the fucking things almost 50 years old. That's why bill, you get out of bed every morning, no matter how good a night's sleep, you got some fucked up on you while you're driving. You're driving you bill. That's what you're doing. So then I come home, all right, picked up one of my family members down the airport, fucking when I've got a burger and a beer, they make the best burgers out here in La, I have to say. And uh, I backed into the driveway and I get out of the truck cause I got to close the gate and I grabbed the handle and the fucking handle comes off on the gates. So, you know, I've, uh, I don't what, what, what, why, why buy thinks, why do you buy shit? So then it just fucking breaks down. But, um, I didn't want to get into it. So anyway, so we got all these fucking people over here, so it's going to be really stressful. And, uh, we got to figure out what the fuck we're going to put everybody and all of this bullshit. And um,

Speaker 3:          00:08:42       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:08:42       I don't know. My, me and my wife kind of pining kind of me getting into it, you know what I mean? She bought one of these fucking pull out fucking sofas. I remember a long time ago, Todd, Barry, you stupid this perfect joke about the pullout bed self a cause they gonna stick it in my office. Right. And of course there's no fucking room for there. There's no room for it. So now, uh, you know, it was just like, you know what? Fuck it. I'll get rid of my desk. I don't need an office. Anyways. Whenever I do the podcast, I do it in the bedroom anyways, laying down on the bed. I don't need an office. You know, you got an office, you know, I'll just fucking use yours. I mine. So whatever it Todd Barry, you said this great joke about the fucking pullout couch where he was just going like, uh, you know, you know, he's like a pullout couch.

Speaker 1:          00:09:26       He goes, it's an uncomfortable couch that pulls out to an even more uncomfortable bed. I'm butchering it. But I used to always laugh because it was perfect. I was living in New York City at the time. We all had small apartments and you know, you'd hook up with somebody or go over some chicks house and Hook over a house or fucking apartment and you'd be at one of those fucking things and you'd be on, you know, you'd be a healthy snack, a healthy scratch, you'd be fuck, you wouldn't be playing the next game is basically what I'm saying. So we're getting one of those and I haven't slept on one of those fucking things since I was 30. I slept on a futon until I was 36. Not Proud of it, but I did, I made the sacrifices so I could scream comments on my own podcast someday.

Speaker 1:          00:10:07       Right. So I haven't slept in one of those in a while. So maybe the technology has gotten a little better. Um, I dunno. I have no idea. But, um, anyways, I not feeling it. I had nothing to fucking talk about today. I'm just excited. I got the whole fucking weekend. So last week I started to talk about the Bruins and what dawn Sweeney did and why they let everybody go. And how I didn't understand it. And as usual, they're saying that everybody wanted like a 50 year contract, like Douggie Hamilton wanting to get paid, like the best defenseman in the league is what they were saying. And then evidently Lou Cheech wanted like a fucking eight year contract and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. I don't know whether to believe it. I don't know who shot. I don't know who's not. And I don't know what to believe. What this fucking thing. Oh, I know is I'm just sitting here thinking we got rid of Tyler's Sagan, Johnny Boychuk, Douggie Hamilton in Milan, Lou Cheech all in the last three, four years, three, four seasons I should say. So, um, I don't know. I guess we just got some goon from Philly. I don't know how that helps us.

Speaker 1:          00:11:13       I don't know how that helps us. I don't know what the fuck we're doing. I, I'm not a big fan of draft picks. I'm a big fan of people that have proven themselves. If you think he couldn't pay one of those guys,

Speaker 1:          00:11:23       I would have kept blue Cheech and I go, fuck all you guys sit in and say that he's not scoring as much. Nobody's scored as much. Last year we had a brutal fucking seasons. Now all of a sudden Milan Lou teaches that one isn't a fucking guy. He can build a team around. Sorry. This is like a delayed reaction. Think I was just in shock. So, um, I just feel like next year when I go, you know, get the center ice package. When I go to watch the Bruins, I want to feel like I'm watching the blue jackets or something that I never fucking watch. No disrespect to all you hockey fans there in Columbus, Ohio. Hey, y'all wish you fans. You guys getting a little nervous about a hard bother. Is it John Harbaugh captain? Come back, bring it fucking Michigan Beck. He's starting to hear those horns playing. Listen to it. Listen to it this weekend. When you're out there with the fireworks, right and you're fucking Osu championship tee shirt, you're not going to tell me that way in the distance. If the wind's blowing just right, you know, you're not going to start here

Speaker 1:          00:12:22       during you guys gonna flip out. Yay. He won shit. Yeah. You want shit and fucking are Caribbean Maribela time you won a championship. Why would people in Ohio have a southern accent bill? I Dunno cause it's offensive. Um, I'm hoping. Here's the John Harbaugh bringing the, uh, is it John Harbaugh? I can't remember anything anymore. Uh, the fucking wolverines back. I hope he does because I would love to see that become a rivalry again. You know what I mean? It's like, you know, Brian's contains as much as I should and the Canadians, it's no fun when the Canadian stink. You want to beat them when they're good or at least you know, their version of good now, which as well, you know, we want a couple rounds of the playoffs, poor bastards, poor French best. It's, um, I'm actually going to be up there later on this month.

Speaker 1:          00:13:05       I'm doing a Gig in Ottawa and then September I'm doing Toronto. So that's the extent of my Canadian shit that I'm going to be doing this year. And, um, for those of you who want to complain, ah, relax. All right, the way global warming is going, your country will be a fun place to tour within eight months, you know, so who knows? Maybe I'll be up there. Maybe I will be maybe a, well, so, uh, anyways, let me do a little bit of advertising here and see if I can get this fucking thing back on the rails.

That's ziprecruiter.com/burr again, ziprecruiter.com/burr oh you know, this whole podcast, I've been sitting here trying to wonder what the fuck it was that I needed to talk about, which is probably why the first 10 minutes was so goddamn bad. My apologies. How can I do that on the, on the birthday of this nation, you know, so, um, the native Americans have like a 4th of July type of thing. They must have had their holidays, right?

Speaker 1:          00:15:57       Did we take those away from them to, you know, anyways, fucking horrible. Let's plow ahead here. I need to apologize, specifically heartfelt apologies from the lovely Nia to the person last week that wrote the quite the hypothetical about p diddy and the Kettlebell and 50 million bucks. It just seems so fucking random. Um, I think we were out of the country when that whole thing happened or I don't know what we were doing, but we missed. For those of you who also live under a rock or maybe just have better shit to do with your life. Uh, P diddy was arrested on East UCLAs campus Monday for getting into a fight with a Bruins assistant coach early Monday afternoon and later charged with three counts of assault with a deadly weapon. One count of making terrorist's threats and one count of battery making terrorist's threats. What does that fucking Marty all family, you know, it's shit. You yell when you're mad. Terrorist's threats.

Speaker 1:          00:16:56       The fuck constitutes is terrorist threat at this point. I have an a bottled water and your carry on. Um, yes. You read that correctly and yes, that p diddy and then of course the snarky comment, he'll always be puff daddy to me. Oh, Sam Cooper. Um, did he son Justin Combs is a red shirt. Junior defensive back for the Bruins. He's that fucking old. I remember living in Manhattan when he, when he was a kid and did, he had that fucking a restaurant called Justin's. He was a little kid and he used to do standup down there and p diddy would come in there and he would heckle the fucking comics. It was a brutal gig. Um, he's played in seven games combined over the past two seasons. This is his kid registering for tackles according to a, um, these people here, one of us, you see Las assistant coaches was at Justin on the field and did, he later confronted the coach and grabbed him as a result.

Speaker 1:          00:17:55       Diddy 45 was arrested for assault and remains in custody at the campus jail. Isn't that fucking hilarious? Who would have thought that Sean Combs was a helicopter parent? Shouldn't you be if like flipping out at like his pop Warner game? It's like he's a man now. I don't know. Maybe it's hard fucking watching your kid getting screamed at. I have no idea. Ucla later confirmed the report and said that, uh, Sean Combs, let's just use his real name, was charged with assault with a deadly weapon. With the weapon being a kettle bell, uh, a piece of weightlifting equipment for all you fucking lazy bastards out there. Um, here's Uclas full statement. Shortly after 12:30 PM today, Sean Combs, Aka p diddy was the rest of that, a Costa athletic training camp. We, we've already running, we already know this shit. He said, I'm thankful that our staff showed the level of professionalism that they did in handling the situation. Well. How difficult was it? It's a bunch of football people.

Speaker 1:          00:18:52       Here's a picture of what, what are you doing? You know, at some point you just gotta give into the fact that your kid's not going to make the pros sit there attack. Then, uh, uh, a fucking assistant coach get your Goddamn head in the game and all of a sudden, do you think he did one of those little ditty dances? You know, it was, he came over. You remember that thing he did when he bent over at the waist and kind of just walked up with his shoulders going up and down the p, the APP, the Di, the Di, the why the fucking datey hold up. Remember that? And that guy from a meet the parents, Ben Kingsley Bent, uh, Ben Fucking, uh, Ben. A sizzle, which Ben Shenanigans. Ben Stiller. Ben Stiller was in that fucker. All right. He did the whole beginning thing fade Leptin and like he was his neighbor and then Sean Combs did his, his, what he thinks is hilarious, that dead pan look at the camera and turns his head to the side and you could just hear all the white people laughing like it was the funniest thing ever. Oh ha ha ha. Instead of going like, listen, Shawn, Mr. Combs, I, I want to tell you that sucks. But you had just gotten into that incident where you're saying the gun was shines. Is that his name? Remember that guy who went to jail? That's back. When did, he was still banging a, what's her face there? The chick from the Jennifer Lopez, right before she was with Ben Affleck before she was with the fucking backup dancer before she got with the fucking, that fucking guy that looks like Latino Anthony [inaudible].

Speaker 1:          00:20:34       What the fuck was that guy's name? What did he sing? He sang one of the east, sang all those fucking, oh Jesus. What the fuck was that guy's name? Piazza Dora.

Speaker 5:          00:20:48       Ah, fuck. It's something junior, isn't it? Freddie Prinze Jr. Okay,

Speaker 1:          00:20:52       I don't fuck. Well, what are you going to do? What are you going to do that? You know what? It's unfortunate.

Speaker 5:          00:20:57       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:20:57       Parents, I'm not a parent, so I can say this with confidence. You know, I can say this without prejudice. Sometimes you kids just can't play it the next level.

Speaker 1:          00:21:07       Yeah. Well, you just gotta you, you gotta deal with it and they're going to get yelled at at the collegiate level because you think that assistant coach wants to be the assistant coach for the rest of his life. He doesn't. He wants to be the head coach. Then he wants to get to the pros. That's what he wants to do. And sometimes your kids getting in the way, that dream, you know, and they, they got it. They got to yell at him. So, uh, I know I'm going to go out on a limb having not seen any of the footage to say that. Obviously there was a complete fucking overreaction, but I will say that no terrorist threat was fucking made under the definition of the law. I'm sure it was a terrible terrorist threat. Look, I'll kill your whole family or something. You know, I'll blow this fucking place up like people you sit. That's just an expression for now is growing up. Burn this fat burning the run down. Next thing you know, rights. Fucking people step off for buying the bushes and you put it on a most wanted list.

Speaker 1:          00:22:00       Hey, here's a bet I'd be willing to make. I'm not making it, but I'm willing to make it with one person. I'll bet anybody out there $1,000 that at no point during this next presidential election, at no point will anybody who has a serious chance at becoming the next president of the United States at all. Will they bring up all fucking it and he taught Monsanto there. Nobody's going to bring that shit up. Is they're sitting there charging p diddy with with making terrorist threats. Is that what it is? Meanwhile these guys are fucking up the whole food supply for their own countrymen. It's the biggest like act of treason, terrorism, whatever you want to fucking call it. Do you know? They just pass the fucking law.

Speaker 5:          00:22:50       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:22:50       The house votes. This is how underpaid politicians are and rich people get him into office corporations and all this shit. How's votes to repeal meat labeling law under threat of retaliation from Canada and Mexico, we basically passed a law that was going to say that we don't have to say where the meat comes from. You haven't, so you basically have no idea what the fuck you're eating. Under threat of trade relations from Canada and Mexico, the House has voted to repeal a law requiring country of origin labels on packages of beef, pork and poultry.

Speaker 5:          00:23:26       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:23:26       Wait, Canada and Mexico are arguing. Oh wait, wait a minute. Wait, Whoa, whoa. So Canada and Mexico also have fucked up food so they don't want that either.

Speaker 5:          00:23:36       Okay,

Speaker 1:          00:23:36       so this is the end. This is the end of the fucking world. The World Trade Organization rejected at US appeal last month ruling that the labels that say were animals were born, raised in slaughter, are discriminatory against the two u s border countries. Oh yeah. Don't bring in your fucking genetically altered food and fuck with ours yet. Cons. Uh, both have said they planned to talk to the World Trade Organization for permission to impose billions of dollars in tariffs on American goods. Well, joke's on you buddy. We don't make anything here anymore. I don't know that we export anything other than fucked up food. Right. I don't know. But anyways, I guarantee you that, um, you know, if I every once in a while, if I read a story before he started talking about it, um,

Speaker 5:          00:24:21       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:24:22       I, I guarantee you nobody's going to bring that up. I doubt anybody's going to bring up that Nestle doesn't think that a water is a human right and that corporations are in the process of trying to privatize water.

Speaker 5:          00:24:34       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:24:35       So, you know, I don't know if it rains and you stick your tongue out your own money. It's just, it's going down. It's why I was talking about it. I did that, that, um, needed too many stars. I was joking around where I, the president should have fuck you money. He should make 400 grand a year. If that guy could feel good about where he's going to be at the end of his, you know, if for eight years you made 400 grand every year. Okay. Do you think you'd be set for life walking out in your 50s? You know, there's no fucking way. And that they go around and they give those speeches after they've, their PR, their president to these fucking corporations that got him in and they get $1 million a night and that's that stem washing their bribe money. And that's how they, they, they take care of them.

Speaker 1:          00:25:20       I don't know. I know I'm going down the fucking Reva. Notice that guys, I'm slowly going back down the rabbit hole again. Just cause I know, I know another fucking election is coming up. Uh, they will, they won't talk about any of that shit. So when he was, well, what can I talk about that's a little happier than that? Um, Oh, last night I'm getting ready for another goddamn comedy jam. And uh, I, um, I played for like two hours. I got fucking blisters on my fingers. I don't know if it's cause I'm just hadn't played in a minute because I was focusing on the helicopter shit. But it was the most God damn fun I've had in so long. Two hours in this rehearsal space. We went through all the songs that we had done on the previous ones. Uh, all these fucking 80 songs. Dr Feelgood, Paradise City custard Pie. What else are we doing now? And so now we're working on new one. Uh, I know I never tell you what the song is, so, um, I'm, I'm getting geared up to do that again and uh, oh, I can't tell you that this is nothing more fun than playing fucking drums if you don't have a good time playing drums. So you were an asshole. I mean, I am an asshole.

Speaker 1:          00:26:23       I don't know. Well wait a second,

Speaker 1:          00:26:26       you don't have take. The problem with this podcast was I had one beer before I did it about an hour ago, and that's enough for guy, a guy of my age, a man of a certain age. If you have one beer in the afternoon, you're done. You're done. You got to take a fucking nap. Let's end on this everybody. Mercedes AMG. That's like the Shelby division. No, no. I don't mean to insult Mercedes by comparing them to an American car. And now how insulting that is. You know, I met some German girl and I was talking about, uh, I was on the road, this German woman. I was going like, Oh man, do you guys get great cars? Like BMW? She goes, Audi and I go Mercedes. And then she just rolled her eyes. She goes, it's a cab. Like it's a taxi because when you go over there, like that's what all their taxis are. So they don't even fucking respect them. I'm saying, AMG, we'll build something fast as a given, uh, that's, it's specialty. But in this instance, a suitably vague teaser video has piqued our interest. Evidently they're making some sort of v eight they don't know what the fuck it is. I'll have the link for this. You guys want to hear what it sounds like. This is their little teaser here.

Speaker 5:          00:27:30       Okay,

Speaker 1:          00:27:30       AMG. Something fast as coming. Come on.

Speaker 5:          00:27:35       Come on.

Speaker 1:          00:27:39       Show me the fucking car.

Speaker 1:          00:27:43       You know what? I'm not showing you that because that was just a waste of 19 seconds of my life, you know? Fuck you. I'm glad you lost both wars. Your cons, I think something fast as common. You supposed to your AMG, right? You know what? This is a complete cluster. Fuck. I apologize to check in. You walk in on you the way I did this week. Did I even ask you? I mean I'm supposed to be checking in on you. I didn't ask you about anything like how was your work week? You know, are they making your work the Friday? Are they making you work the third your boss makes you do now don't blame you fucking boss and like whoever's the shot collar. You've got to figure out who, who's the fucking evil cunt that won't give you the half day on the third. Right. Cause you know businesses psych that the 4th of July is on Saturday and how great.

Speaker 1:          00:28:30       We don't have to give him a fucking day off. Fuck them. Make them come in Friday. Tell him to stay till five 30 find out who the shot caller is and a, I don't know. You gotta you gotta do something fucking stupid. You know, maybe you'd take whatever condiment you were going to put on your hot dog that day and you stick it under his door handles. That's such a chick Conti fucking thing to do. But it is hilarious. Now. Whatever you do, don't make a youtube video of it and then send it to me and then you're going to get caught. Just don't do that. But I'm just saying it's gotta be something you can.

Speaker 5:          00:29:04       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:29:05       Is it considered an act of terrorism now to do the old gag where you put the bucket of water over somebody's door? You know, why did that go away? I think it was considered hack after awhile, but it's still is one of the funniest fucking things ever to see somebody standing there and not in swim trunks dressed ready to go to work and have a bucket of water go over their head. Right. It's an act of terrorism. Do you support Isis? Um, oh Jesus. Bill. Oh yeah, that's this, you know, it's this podcast. This was, I should have renamed this podcast. Who, oh, JJ, gosh, maybe I don't have enough to talk about. You know, it is. I got off the fucking finally, um, I got off the road and uh, I haven't had to do shit. I think I did one show this week. Is that all I did?

Speaker 1:          00:29:51       I Dunno. I'm gearing up for the Montreal Comedy Festival and uh, I'm doing some God forsaken Gig in Ottawa, which is either going to be amazing or it's going to be an absolute shit show. I think it's some sort of blues festival or something. I'm just picturing a bunch of bikers. You know, the only thing worse than a bunch of bikers is a bunch of Canadian bikers, you know, cause at least the ones down here, they're frightening. You know, up there that probably all find out. Jesus. Why, why would I do that? Why would I say that before I go up there and then you have to prove how fucking tough they are. You know, that's got to be weird, right? Joanie? No fucking biker gang. It's like, am I seriously going to do this with my life? What are you doing? Hey, I haven't seen him since high school. What do you do? I'm going to count. What do you do? I'm in a biker gang.

Speaker 1:          00:30:42       Yeah. Making my money. Yes. Selling drugs and a prostituting women, you know, you know the office area. It just wasn't for me. I tried the cubicle thing and uh, I dunno. Then I just started getting tattoos. It started with the, you know, the classic early 90 ones, you know, I got a tramp stamp and Barb wire around my fucking arm and then I just continued. Okay. Next thing you know, I dunno. Oxy came out right. I was sick a crank anyways. Right? Oxy came out and then, and then here we go. By the way, did anybody see what Eddie van Halen said this week?

Speaker 1:          00:31:18       Eddie van Halen. I swear to God, man, that guy is like, he's becoming the good, do you guys ever see that, that documentary, but beware of Mr. Baker and this is whole thing on ginger Baker who a, I'm obviously a big fan of, um, I mean the guy just comes off as one of the most psychotic fucking human beings you wouldn't ever want to be around. And I hate to say it, that was just watching Eddie. I'm so fucking old. I don't want, it was a young guy, 25 year old kid just redefining the guitar and just to watch him turning into this grumpy old man. I guess there's some sort of horse shit going on between him and the Bass player, Michael Anthony. I know he's not in the band anymore. I don't know what happened this week. But Eddie basically said like, you know what, if van Halen fans don't shut the fuck up, I'll bring back Gary Sharon as the lead vocalist.

Speaker 1:          00:32:06       That'll give him something to bitch about and it's just like Jesus Christ. Dude, you had to shit on Gary and fucking do anything. How'd you drag him? Is that his name? I don't know. Like fuck his name is. It's just really stat enough. So like Eddie just go play the guitar and shut the fuck up man. I don't understand what, what's this guy's problem is? Let me see something. Let me, let me get the exact goddamn quote here. Then I swear to God, I'll get out of your way. What do you care? Even though this will, this one kind of sucked this week. He got admit to short fucking weak. If you have a boss with a, uh, who has a heart, you know what I mean? They let off for the Friday. Who's getting it? We don't make anything here anyways. What are you taking a day off from? Answering phones, you know, calling up China and tell him to have the, the crying people in the background who build the shit for no money to shut the fuck up while you listen to some spreadsheet numbers. Sorry, I have no, I'm just, I'm totally, I'm just back into this shit. All right. Michael Anthony, Eddie van Halen. Here we go. Why do we got something fast? It's coming. Can you believe that? Fucking that, that was like clickbait.

Speaker 5:          00:33:12       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:33:13       And when you see this car, it's going to change your whole attitude on what cars could be. Um, where was it?

Speaker 5:          00:33:22       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:33:23       No, Jesus Christ. There's so much fucking drama. So this is when you look up Eddie van Halen. Michael Anthony. This is, this is the front page. This is how much fucking chick yelling and screaming is going on in this band. Michael Anthony says it's really sad. He hasn't spoken to. I don't want the rest of this is Gary Sherman reflects on his three year stint and Van Halen. David Lee Roth vents about van Halen [inaudible] future a Sammy Hagar defends Michael Anthony. Um, Sammy Hagar predicts Michael Anthony will rejoin van Halen. Uh, Sammy Hagar defends Michael Anthony. Fuck you, Eddie. Michael. Anthony. I never quit. Van Halen. Ladies. Ladies, can we just get back to running with the devil there? Can we just do that? Um, I got the greatest reality show ever. You take fucking Eddie van Halen and axl rose.

Speaker 5:          00:34:20       All right.

Speaker 1:          00:34:22       But then you'd have Steven Adler play the Donald Trump role as who gets fired from the fucking band, you know, or whatever. It gets annoying. Maybe I didn't have a great idea. Maybe I had it. I just thought of the people and I thought it was great. Speaking of which, you see Donald Trump got fired from his own fucking show. I actually think that he's getting paid by the Illuminati is a distraction because I absolutely fucking love this guy in this election and I don't give a fuck what he says. At least he's saying something different as opposed to right. Yeah. Yesterday I said to Kate yet, right? There's cadre great again. Right? I just liked it. He just sounds like some fucking drunk in a bar with his simple stupid solutions.

Speaker 5:          00:35:04       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:35:05       Hey, uh, Trump, what about the hole in the ozone where I get a ladder?

Speaker 5:          00:35:11       Yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:35:12       we'll draw this country. Everybody's afraid to get a ladder. She's like, what are you talking about? You know, they can't get ladders because of the Koreans and there are a bunch of rapists. He is literally sounds like he's like dead guy at closing time where everybody's going like, oh Jesus, is he gonna Puke? Let's get this guy a fucking cab. Um, somebody please explain to me how that guy's worth $9 billion. I just, I, for the of me, I don't buy it. I really don't show he his running his Yap,

Speaker 1:          00:35:44       which is funny. He's lost his TV show and I think his clothing line at Macy's and what's the funniest fucking thing ever is to watch the network. They'll issue statements like, we don't stand by some of the hateful things that he said about Mexico Mexicans. And it's like, fuck you. You don't stand by losing money and people are bitching to you and they're threatening to your fucking advertise as quit acting like he'd give a fuck about, about anybody right now. Jesus. Jesus. I was so fucking negative. Maybe somebody at the network does care. Um, all right, so that's it. I already sang happy birthday to America. They Canada. When's, when's your uh, oh, I should have done it on Cinco de Mayo.

Speaker 3:          00:36:23       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:36:23       Right. Happy Birthday to Mexico. Happy Birthday to Mexico. Bueno birthday day, man. He called. Whoa.

Speaker 1:          00:36:39       I don't know any you'll tango Pero. Wow. You don't think, oh, Pero Greece, Splunk. I don't fucking know. I don't, I don't fucking know. What do you want from me? Both de uh, I swear to God got at one beer, one beer and I'm not drunk, but I can't think. All right, there you go. There's your podcast. Just yeah, get it out. Yeah, we got a, we got some greatest hits coming up here. Uh, people please have a happy and safe holiday. All right. Booze and fireworks. Don't work but booze and you're friends with fireworks definitely works. So find a safe place for your drunk ass to watch and blow their fingers off or light their backyard on fire. All right. If you're half drunk friends over, do not have fireworks. If you're going to your friend's house and they are drunk and they have fireworks, let them do what they want. It's their house. Just make sure you have enough juice in your phone to be able to videotape what's happening, what happens, and please send it to me here at the, uh, the man podcast and, um, and that is it. All right, go. Fuck, I haven't,

Speaker 3:          00:37:44       God bless you. I'll talk to you. A lot of shipments,

Speaker 6:          00:38:19       gas mileage thing I brought up last week, how I was watching the good bye girl and she was standing at the corner of characters, was standing in front of a fucking Subaru and uh, it got 39 miles per gallon and here it is 36 later and my car only gets fucking a hybrid, only gets 41 miles per gallon. So this brilliant guy writes in and he goes and he starts talking about leaded gas and all this fucking how cars today are heavier. This fucking Moron thought cars today were heavier than cars back in the day. You know, like the 1959 Cadillac, I'm sure that that car was lighter than your average Toyota Camry. So anyways, this, somebody sent me, let me, let me, you read this guy's, this guy's response here. One of the many that I got. Um, on the gas mileage thing, it always blows my mind what people fucking respond to. So this guy ends up writing me a, he goes, there are two reasons. Wait a minute, it's loading.

Speaker 3:          00:39:31       Okay,

Speaker 6:          00:39:32       loading. I don't know. He gave me all these fucking reasons and I basically responded with so basic, you're telling me, he basically said that it had nothing to do with money. It had to do with the weight of the cars and somehow the mixture of the gasoline that we use nowadays. That's why they just can't figure out a fucking way to get more than like better than what's the highest you've seen? Like 40 45 this guy tried to say, well, actually there are things that can a hundred miles to gallon their scooters. Ah, what it more rod? He goes, there's two reason why old cars have such highly high published gas mileage. For one, the EPA tests simply used to provide higher numbers. Sir, they've been doing that right up until the last couple of years ago. In fact, the year before I bought my Prius, they were legally able to claim that it got like 55th I actually almost 60 miles per gallon before they cracked down on the hybrid and made him say, actually 40 ones.

Speaker 6:          00:40:34       I'm aware of the EPA test. I'm aware that they do it when there's no headwind. I'm aware that most of the test is when they're fucking going 25 miles an hour and they only drive the car 55 miles an hour for about fucking 30 seconds. I realize that the numbers are skewed. Okay. He said it's been revised several times over the decade. Yeah. So my Prius, your Prius would get like 70 miles per gallon on the old test. No, it wasn't, sir. No, it wouldn't. It would get more like 60 that's what it did. Look. So let's just say that it would get 70 who gives a shit? He goes, what? Where am I? The second reason is safety features. Check out the weight of your vehicles. Cars have gotten heavier. No, they have. My Prius is not heavier than a fucking Subaru and the 1970s it isn't.

Speaker 3:          00:41:26       Okay,

Speaker 6:          00:41:26       dude, I'm old enough to remember when cars actually had metal on their dashboard. They're all plastics hunks shit now.

Speaker 7:          00:41:35       Okay.

Speaker 6:          00:41:35       He goes, cars, if even 15 years ago, feature death traps when compared to the modern cars. No, they didn't. They've had to crumple free zones. There's those little crumpled freak. They've had those crumple zones for years, sir. In 19 fucking 88 I was coming home from a Christmas party drunk off my ass, sitting in the fucking passenger seat of a Pontiac Grand Prix. We pulled up to a red light. There was a fucking jeep CJ seven the old school ones sitting there. All right, we saw it, I saw it, the driver's side, but the alcohol didn't quite see it and we just sorta went. We were slowing down, but we didn't come to a complete stop and just completely rear ended this guy. All right? There wasn't a scratch on the fucking jeep. This goddamn Karch folded up like a fucking accordion. The engine dropped down underneath us and I, I got, I didn't even get a booboo.

Speaker 6:          00:42:35       I just Sorta, you know, I didn't, I didn't have a seatbelt on or nothing. The car was designed to take 80% of the fucking impact. All right, you're sitting in your cubicle. Just toss in these fucking numbers out. All right. So basically my response is, I'm saying it has nothing to do with money in the oil companies. So basically what you're telling me is that nowadays I can have a video conference with somebody in Brazil. Why my entire music collection is in my pocket on a phone that is also a camera and a video recorder. I can upload the content onto the Internet and potentially have it viewed by every person in the fucking world. But we can't make a car that does any better than 40 miles per gallon. So fortunately, you know, everything else has fucking progressed except for gas mileage. Dude, I'm telling you, they have the technology to get like 500 miles per gallon. They're just not going to fucking put it out because that's how powerful the Goddamn oil companies are there. Right up there with the banks. You've got the banks and then you've got the oil company. The banks control the money supply and then the oil companies, they control energy.

Speaker 7:          00:43:43       Okay,

Speaker 6:          00:43:43       okay. You control energy. You can, you control the fucking population. Do you know that? They're actually out here. There's people, they're selling kits out here to have your own fucking windmill so you can get yourself off the grid. So then they immediately pass the fucking law, General Electric, that General Electric had to come around and make sure that everything was safe. They had to get their fucking noses back in there. So cause they can't have people disappearing off the fucking grid. You can't have people getting free energy other than the cost of the fucking wind mill. You can't have them sitting there. And every time the God damn wind blows it, it recharges a generator. And now I don't have to work as much. I don't have to work as much. I don't have to go into debt. You're getting yourself off of the fucking treadmill and they can't have that.

Speaker 6:          00:44:31       All right. God Damn it. I wish I was more intelligent so I could explain this better. But you know what? This is a great documentary. I'm actually going to email this guy back. It's called the gas whole full documentary, and there's the date and they have everything from, they have everything from the, the, the urban myth of the watered powered carburetor, which this guy who I brought to me completely dismissed. He completely dismissed any sort of, uh, that, that, that, that, that exists because he sits in a cubicle and I sit in the fucking bedroom. All right? And he tries to just say, that's just another media hoax. All, you know, they said, do we beat Eisenhower? A fucking like dumb shit like that. Okay. This. So this documentary, I have everything from like the urban myths that the, that these a water powered cars existed. Um, all the way up to actual, uh, retired, um, scientists who worked for Shell.

Speaker 3:          00:45:32       Okay?

Speaker 6:          00:45:33       Who, you just have to watch this documentary. They were shown, there was a book out that claimed that they could get a 149 miles per gallon in the 1950s on like a Packard or desoto. And by the 70s, this scientist who worked for Shell said they had gotten it up to a thousand miles per gallon. All right. I don't know why people think that it's, it's

Speaker 3:          00:45:59       okay.

Speaker 6:          00:45:59       Absolutely impossible to improve the gas mileage. Some people feel that, I don't know why people feel like we can't come up with anything better than the gas combustion engine. It's complete fucking book. It's the same level of bullshit as that. There's an actual difference between a Democrat and a Republican watch this documentary, the gas hole. We're going to have the link up on the Monday morning podcast. Just watch this shit and I don't know what to tell you. Some of it looks like, okay. Did they have this old guy going, you know, and this guy showed up and he had, it was a contraption made auto, you know, it was powered on water and then he claimed that Shell bought the patent, gave him $1 million, and then he could never fucking, you know, make another one now. That's the kind of Shit, some old guy saying that he saw it on a salt flat in the 1950s I'm not going with that. All right. I'm not that much of a fucking whack job. But when a guy who worked used to work for Shell is coming out saying that type of stuff, it's just, it gets to the point like, are all of these people nuts?

Speaker 3:          00:47:04       Okay.

Speaker 6:          00:47:04       You know what I mean? There's no fucking way. I don't give a shit whether there's led and gas, whether there's not letting gas, how much the car fucking ways or any of that bullshit. There's no fucking way.

Speaker 3:          00:47:17       Yeah.

Speaker 6:          00:47:17       That in, in, in almost 40 years, you can't do better than two more miles per gallon. I absolutely fucking refused to believe it. I rap. I fucking refuse to believe it. I think it's complete horseshit. It's just another way to s to keep control of the herd. Now, if you want to argue that you need to keep control the herd or there's going to be absolute chaos, so we have to keep cars down like that. I will listen to that argument. But if you're going to come at me and tell me that in 2000 fucking 11

Speaker 6:          00:47:46       okay, when I'm reading shit that in the medical field, they can now grow a fucking a new colon for somebody outside of the body. I read this, this thing on that ted.com this woman had a completely ulcerated large intestine, so they took some sort of tissue, CARF culture, whatever the fuck that means out of her of diseased colon. Use that to then grow another one outside of her body where they would done growing it. They took the old one out and put the new one in, like she went down to midas muffler and it totally fucking worked okay. Up until like five years ago, you were looking at a colostomy bag. You would have a bag of shit right under her fucking right, tinny for the rest of her God damn life. Her social life would have been over. Okay. If they can do that, you're telling me you're still going to tell me they can't do anything rather than about 40 fucking 45 miles a gallon. You're really going to sit there and believe that in your Goddamn cubicle that they just can't fucking, just can't fucking figure it out. The only way I can get like a hundred miles a gallon is if I ride on a fucking scooter.

Speaker 6:          00:49:03       You sir, believe in Santa Claus. I remember one time I had this old piece of shit truck, right, that I drove for like 10 years because I knew I wanted to be a comedian and I didn't want to go into debt. So when the engine finally died, I threw a new engine in there and the guy told me he needed to rebuild the carburetor. I'm like, you don't need to rebuild the carburetor so you know what this cunt did. He fucking adjusted the carburetors. So I would just get shitty gas mileage hoping I would be an absolute fucking moron and then drive back and I'll be like, well, I guess you're right. I'm just, I'm just chowing through gas here. That's what this mother fucker did at his little garage. This little piece of shit did that because it wasn't enough that he fucking made 1600 fucking bucks off me. He wanted to make like fucking 1900 bucks. So he did that just as a fucking individual and you're going to try and tell me that a corporation that basically controls the world fucking energy. He's not going to buy up patents

Speaker 6:          00:50:10       by people that that are, that are, that are are making or coming up with the carburetors and stuff like carb. But by coming up with, with with alternate ways of powering a car more efficiently, they're not going to buy that up. Do they have that whole Stanley mayor thing? And that's not a conspiracy theory either. We actually, we actually played the news clip on the opiate Anthony show. Stanley mayor, great news for individuals, but bad news for oil companies claims he's come up with an engine that can run on any type of water, fresh water, salt water, rainwater doesn't make a difference and he claims he can drive across the country on 28 gallons of water. Um, this is of such interest. The Pentagon is sending a lieutenant colonel out there. That was the actual news clip from the opiate Anthony show. It was an actual news clip.

Speaker 6:          00:51:04       It's not some bullshit I read on a fucking website. Okay. Now what happened after that? Nobody knows. But basically within 10 years Stanley was dead in his car disappeared and his brother right now is trying to get the car back and nobody knows where the fuck it is. All right. Um, I, I truly believe that the quickest death sentence you could possibly have is to go on the news and claim that you've come out with an alternate source of energy that's going to put a corporation out of business that is making, that is projected to make $350 billion next year. How much do you think your life is worth? And if you have $350 billion, how easy is it do you think to get somebody to solve this problem?

Speaker 6:          00:52:33       Now, if you're new to my podcast last week, I was saying, how come miles per gallon on gas on cars, sorry, as it's been, it's basically been the same since the 70s. So people were trying to suggest to me that cars weighed more back in the 70s. And I said, get the fuck Outta here. Those God damn led back in the day. They had metal bumpers and full size spares. Get the fuck Outta here. I remember when we had, uh, we had like a 72 or 73 Buick regal to door and it took two. Me and one of my brothers, all of our might to open that fucking car doors like opened up God damn like a bank vault. But two things I forgot to do. One actually look up the stats and to realize that I was like fucking six years old when I was trying to open it. You know you ever think that shit when you think it doesn't, it doesn't really snow as much as it used to, which it probably doesn't. But as far as like the storm spent by you, like dude back in the day was up to my waist. Yeah. And you were about three feet tall. That's why. That's why, that's why it seems so fucking deep because you could barely look over a coffee table. Um, anyway, so I'll give you guys that one. I'll give you guys that one. Okay.

Speaker 6:          00:53:49       And I would actually love to be wrong on this one, but I just don't think I am. Even though I was wrong that that cars weighed more in the 70 when people show me a bunch of stats, cause God knows I'm not going to look at them all right. And people, by the way, who actually said that I really sounded like a moron last week. I May, I invite you to listen to the first four years of this podcast and just see the reoccurring theme that that is. Okay. I don't read it makes me sleepy. I've stated that before. I don't fucking read. All right? I go with my gut. Okay. I'll tell you this right now. I don't know how to fill a tooth, but I can go in and look at a dentist and real and I can, I can fucking judge that guy. Whether or not he's gonna he's, he's telling me the truth. Does that make any sense? Of course it doesn't go fuck yourself. I've got a God damn hour to fill here. This is what, this is a problem I have, I have with people who are defending the oil companies here is basically when you go back to the 70s okay? And you prove to me the cars. Did they weigh more now? Okay, so you're right on that one.

Speaker 7:          00:54:56       Yeah.

Speaker 6:          00:54:57       But your logic though is still based in that the oil companies were telling the truth in 1976 that whatever 35 miles per gallon was the best that we could do. So you use that as a jump off point to then prove your point now that that's why cars get the gas mileage that that, that, that they get today is basically, I have to make the leap with you that oil companies are telling the truth,

Speaker 6:          00:55:24       that there's $350 billion industry. Okay. That that has on numerous occasions openly got in the way of any sort of progress. I remember here out in California, I think it was the late nineties it might've been 20 years ago. I can't remember what it was before I moved out here the first time or right after I left. The air quality out here was so fucking horrific. It's like I know a lot of people still think it's real smoggy out here. It definitely gets smog, but it usually just in the summertime, and it's definitely hazy out here, but Hays is not fucking smog. Smog is Brown. You go hiking and you feel a burning in your fucking chest back in the day, in the late nineties. Okay. You could see this shit. So anyway, so they, they, they put this, uh, they put it to the vote for a people to the people who actually would vote on this shit and they pass this bill that said by the year 2000, whatever, whatever, 25% or 30% of cars had to run on something other than, you know, the gas oil could get basically the gas combustion engine. They basically paved the way for the big three to then basically start making electric cars the fucking thing past.

Speaker 7:          00:56:46       Okay.

Speaker 6:          00:56:47       An oil companies got together with their lobbyists and they went and they just totally dismantled the whole thing and the whole thing fucking went away.

Speaker 7:          00:56:56       Okay.

Speaker 6:          00:56:56       Okay. Which for all you people out there who are gonna explain capitalism, capitalism to me, I get it. That is their prerogative to do that.

Speaker 6:          00:57:07       Why wouldn't they get in the way of that? So let me ask you this. You're telling me that they would get in the way of that but they wouldn't get in the way of any sort of progress. Just with the gas combustion engine, they wouldn't get in a way of any of that type of progress. They seem to not get in the way of anything else. Safety, they don't give a shit about. They won't get in the way of that type of stuff. Burning it cleaner. They don't give a fuck about but miles per gallon, which is their bottom line like do you guys honestly think like today, like what your car gets like that's honestly the best that science can do that is we are right up against the fucking wall. Is that what you're telling me? You know, considering if they just even increased it by five, 10 miles a gallon per every new car, that they would immediately lose hundreds of millions of dollars. Why would they do it? Why would they do? Why would they allow that to happen? Why wouldn't they get in the way of that? That's all I'm asking here. And you know something for all you fucking assholes out there. Who called me this? Whack job conspiracy theories. These are my conspiracies.

Speaker 6:          00:58:13       Bankers are fucking evil. Well, companies lie to you and insurance companies are pieces of shit. That's basically my three. And then they have enough money to basically buy elections. That's basically yet, okay. Those really aren't groundbreaking conspiracies are they? I'm not saying that some guy living in the fucking moon. I'm not saying I saw a fucking flying saucer come out of the God damn emotion. It fucking take a piss on somebody sunbae then and then, you know, I saw Ronald Reagan waving out the side of it and then it took off. I'm not saying that shit, I just, I don't buy it. Okay. And I actually got emails from people. Um, they sent me these, these, these links, they sent me this link of this, this fucking kid, 14 year old kid with one of his classmates built this futuristic looking Jetsons car and they got close to 2000 miles per gallon. I'll, I'll, I'll send you the link to this. You can go on the [inaudible] podcast and look at this thing. Mm, the MM podcast.com

Speaker 1:          00:59:22       look at the picture of this thing. Okay. And once you'd done saying, well, it's not a practical car, it's not as heavy as the other ones. It would never meet the safety standards and Yada, Yada, Yada, all that fucking shit. Do you honestly think that airbags, navigation systems, crumple zones and all that? You're honestly going to tell me that that basically knocks off 1900 miles per gallon. Are you really going to fucking sit there and tell me that you honestly think that they're not? Why wouldn't they get in the way of it? They have the money to get in the way in the way of it. And not only that, they're not even part of this country in a way. They're borderless. They're, they're worldwide. I don't, I don't know. So I decided, I, I respectfully apologize for not fucking, uh, looking up the weight of the car. I was 100% wrong in that, but I still do not think that I'm wrong or I'm fucking paranoid. I had one guy, this guy is fucking hilarious. This guy was just ripping me, just saying, this is classic old man. It's like, dude, I'm 43. Jesus Christ, this guy's going old man. Like I'm afraid of the world.

Speaker 1:          01:00:34       I'm afraid of the fucking world I have. I at least can sit here and tell you that I don't believe in all that religious horse shit.

Speaker 1:          01:00:45       What if I was a scared old man? What'd I be going to church every God damn week when I be doing that stuff? Believing in the immaculate conception. I think you go on the ground people. I, you know what that's, that's my theory. I think when you died you go in the ground and then you become a fossil fuel for more people to fucking fight in, in, in, in a lie about the, the do you know, you know, and my actually my Prius and I've actually thought about doing this. There's people granted it fucks over your warrant, your, your warranty on your car. They can actually get a hundred miles per gallon bay. And basically what they do is they just, uh, they just fill the ass end with a bunch of batteries, you know?

Speaker 7:          01:01:24       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:01:25       Which I'm sure those are great for the environment. Oh, you know what it is people, I think you know what? It comes down to the most. Why is my fucking throat so dry? Hang on a second.

Speaker 7:          01:01:39       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:01:40       I think it comes down to the amount of what we do. We're fucked. But I just think that there's certain entities that just have too much fucking power. I think when you start making $350 billion a year and you're nationwide, at some point some sort of government should have some sort of power over you. And I don't really think that are ours does. I don't, I don't think that they have any fucking pile. Well, what are they going to do? They got us by the balls the second you start giving them shit, they put their hand on the, on the nozzle, the spicket good. Keep talking. We're goodness. We'll shut this fucking thing off. Huh? Do you want to pay $9,000 for a cantaloupe?

Speaker 6:          01:02:18       Shut your face for 25 gallon. Go Fuck Yourself. Next question. Yes. This is our Marnie. MMM. [inaudible] alright, plowing ahead here. I really want you guys to look at this. Okay? You guys who actually fucking do research. Um, like here's one guy tells me the 1987 Honda, CRX got 57 miles on the highway. Wait was 1800 pounds. The 2011 CRX miles per gallon is 41 on the highway and it weighs 2,600 pounds. So I, I see, I see. They're fucking argument. So right there it's like, all right, well the car was fucking 800 more pounds, which is a lot when the first one only wait 1800 you almost, you're talking about, was that 40% boys? 40% more? Is it getting 40% less on the gas? No, it isn't. So that's actually a fucking improvement. I will give you that. But the jump off point, I'm not buying it.

Speaker 6:          01:03:16       I'm not buying that. We can only get 15 to 25 miles a gallon in 1975 I don't buy it. I bet they easily could've got 200 at that point. They're not going to do it, dude. You talking about the blue bloods at that point? You're talking about that level of fucking power. All right. My apologies to everybody out there who actually has some sort of science background. Evidently people told me that that Stan Stanley Mayer, the water power car is junk science and it's, it's absolutely ridiculous as some would even suggest that they could do that. Uh, so I lost on that one. So this, so you'd, so you guys, you guys want two thirds of the argument here with me. All right. So now that you've backed me into the corner, I want you to explain to me why oil companies wouldn't stand in the way of that technology and w and two fold and why you believe that what they tell you that cars get is the best that we can do. Why you believe that we can't get 60 miles per gallon?

Speaker 3:          01:04:16       Well, you know, there's air airbag and other things and satellite flying around us.
