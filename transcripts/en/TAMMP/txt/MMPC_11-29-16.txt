Speaker 1:          00:00:01       Hey, what's going on is bill burn is time for the Monday morning podcast for Monday, November 28th, 2016 and I'm doing on November 29th at Tuesday. What's going on? How, why? Yeah. Um, I am okay. Case. You were wondering. I got a little, uh, I don't know. I got a little s I've been fighting off this cough for like two fucking weeks. Who's kidding? Who? Right. And I, uh, you know, I was fighting off and it was getting worse and he kept going. Why don't you take some medicine? Why did I say take, take some of this new youth, the next, all right. Holy Shit. Half fucking, my hat's off to anybody that can get fucking drunk off their, that stuff. Jesus Christ. That's like peppermint Schnapps Times fucking 20. Really? It's Musinex. It's like schnapps on steroids. It's just, you know, one of the, you know, the other ones of these dumb champ challenges like the mannequin challenge. I don't understand. What is the challenge? Just hold still has somebody pans around the room. That's a fucking challenge. How the fuck did we go from faking a lunar landing, faking that, faking out the whole fucking Russians. And they got so freaked out that day day when they went on a hissy fit for the next fucking 30 years before they finally went broke. Right in the early nineties

Speaker 1:          00:01:20       cause we, we accepted the challenge of the faking of the lunar land. Maybe we even got there, the Lunar Lander Atlantic challenge. Now we're fucking, oh, the mannequin. Oh, planking. Yeah. I lay face down and somebody takes a picture of me. Oh Jesus Christ. I don't know what the f you know what it is, is he's fucking Goddamn cuts young people these days, you know, no offense, right? God blushes. Let's say fucking spend their whole lives with these fucking reality, virtual reality. God Damn things on their head. They're playing video games. They don't have any skills to second, you take the fucking laptop, you take the fucking laser tag thing, the pink gun, whatever the fuck technology is. The thing that, you know, that new thing that they're trying to get old people into the virtual reality, like, like live in a fucking life is it isn't enough.

Speaker 1:          00:02:10       Like I want to leave this fucking world. Really. You wrote of both through the fucking canal. You haven't done shit. All right, so this is the deal. They don't fucking know how to fucking do anything. This is such an old man rent not to do anything that just fucking literally laying face down in the road, you know, and somebody takes a picture is, is this, it's epic. It's fucking epic. Now granted in the 70s, they did have pet rock, so I might be full of Shit. But you know what it is, the great thing about being old is you lack perspective. When you talk about anything new, you're just like, that's different. It scares me. Um, I don't get the mannequin challenge. I don't, you know, and that, that was like the hell. So had the, uh, whatever the Harlem shake was initially it was a dance and then it was just that stupid youtube. They, the ice bucket challenge, all of that shit. You know, if your instincts aren't immediately to not be part of the group. Um, I don't know what that says about you. I don't want it says about me that I immediately ice buck or everybody's doing it. Well then fucking I'm not doing it.

Speaker 1:          00:03:24       Anti social sick. Freckled headed bald current. What's wrong with you today? Hang on a second. Rico law. Yeah. So I've been fighting this fucking thing off. You know, I have a bad feeling. It might be one the cigar that I got that there's something in there, some sort of bacteria because I was fine. And then I smoked with first he on his birthday and then I smoked with Bobby Kelly had fucking comics come home back to back nights. And then I just had this fucking cough. You know, it's Nike Inhale, the Goddamn things. It's not like I smoked one every fucking day. I smoke one like once every two weeks or they've been a little bit of a bender. Okay. Um, so anyways, so Sunday night, you know, it's been a good 15 days since I smoked. All right. I'll smoke. Another one went down with my buddy.

Speaker 1:          00:04:16       We watched the Broncos chiefs game, arguably the greatest Sunday night football game ever. I lost track of how many fucking lead changes there were. Um, just, you know, and I wasn't drinking. I haven't drank since thanksgiving. I kind of bottomed out thanksgiving. Right. You know, a speck. I had a great thanksgiving, by the way. Great fucking thanksgiving. Um, we ended up day. Talk about that already. I think I already did. Maybe it didn't. I don't remember. Or I started Taco. I hadn't gone to it yet. That's right. That's what it was. Listen to this shit. We went to somebody else's for Thanksgiving and everything was fucking delicious. Every side was fucking not only delicious. It was a home run set. Best thanksgiving I've had since I've been a kid. When I eat my mom, my parent's house, you know, my mother cooked. So it just automatically taste right.

Speaker 1:          00:05:09       Cause that's the only thanksgiving, you know. Right. But at once you move out, you're eating other people's food and no matter what, it's always a little bit different. It's not quite the same. You get that feeling of, fuck, it's over. I have to pay rent now I'm going to get old, right? I'm going to be that person. What happened to him and then I fucking die and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, and all that bullshit. Right? So anyways, we had a great fucking Thanksgiving and I had this fucking bottle of Bourbon that I brought. That was my responsibility. When the fuck is my phone, I got to give this thing shout out man. And you know, they say you can't judge a book by, by it's fucking cover. Um, I actually judged this bottle of just by how cool the fucking bottle looked. So let me scroll through my, it was called angels and something or other, by the way, it rained like a motherfucker out here and I have water collecting up on my roof. Again, fucking cons. It's unbelievable. It's just fucking, it's just, it's just not even right.

Speaker 1:          00:06:12       So I got to get the third fucking people out here to see if they know how to fix it. Ah, God damn. And I thought I took a picture of it. Nah, I got to find it. Hang on a second. You know what, me hit pause. I'll hit pause. All right. I found it. Angel's envy. It's a Kentucky Bourbon. God Damn, it was that delicious. And I'm me and two other people. We finished the bottle and uh, I dunno, I got like two, my last one. And I was just like, you know what? I think this, uh, I think it's time for me to shut it down. You know, maybe once in a while that drink and just gets a little bit too fucking far and then I just shut it down. So I walked away cold Turkey, thanksgiving night, cold Turkey. I fucking walked away from it. And um,

Speaker 2:          00:06:57       you know,

Speaker 1:          00:06:58       not gonna lie to you. I miss it. It's only been four days. I'm still thinking about you sending it letters and shit. Um, yeah, I'm just going to shut it down probably until, um, I'd say maybe the Rose Bowl New Year's day or whatever. I already got it, shut it down and get a fucking kid coming so it's over. You know what, you know what people, I gotta be honest. I had a great run. I got the stories, you know, I spent a few, a few hours in jail. I mean I've done, you know, went to court. I had the whole, you know, had to apologize to people. I had a very full experience with alcohol, you know, talk to some chicks that were way out of my league. You know, I, I did it. I had the whole thing, you know, stayed on the outskirts of bar fights to make sure that I didn't get pummeled.

Speaker 1:          00:07:54       So that's it. So anyways, um, believe it or not, as bad as my cough sounds, it's way better than it was fucking yesterday. I was going to, wasn't going to put you through that shit. So anyways, so Sunday night, yeah, smoked it on one of those cigars and yesterday I woke up, but just so was having a fucking coffin fit. Granted I was already run down. So yesterday, um, I didn't do shit. I got to tell you, that was like the greatest six hours of my life, not doing shit. But somewhere in that six hours after the six hours I was going out of my fucking mind. I don't know how you guys do it, you know, not you guys. Just whoever the fuck is out there that just can just truly take a goddamn day off I go fucking nuts. After six hours was great. I laid there, I watched like two, three episodes of um, Westworld getting caught up. I'm up to like episode six, I'm going to watch today. Right. And I'm loving that show. Although he can't watch more than two or three a day. It's just too much man. It's like you just gotta be you.

Speaker 1:          00:08:57       It's a lot of shit going on to kind of take it. And then also having now doing my own little show, that's only a half hour. When I look at that show I just think of like how fucking long did it take them to do this? And then I'm going to sit here and I'm going to watch it in two days and then be that douche going when season two coming out. You know, it's like, it's a fine bottle of wine and I'm just going to Chug the thing, you know, after the third glass, I'm not really tasting it anymore cause I'm so hammered. I might as well be drinking like fucking red, white and Blue Beers. Some shit, right. Just doesn't seem right. So anyways, that's what I did yesterday and um, I'm feeling much better. Thank Christ. So, um, by the way, today's November 29th, which is the five year anniversary since the passing of one of the funniest and greatest people I ever met, Patrice O'neil and speaking of which there are still some tickets left for the, uh, the fifth annual Patrice O'Neal comedy benefit.

Speaker 1:          00:09:57       Um, all the proceeds after we pay for the, uh, the venue, of course, our only expense, um, you know, it goes to all of his loved ones. It's been a tremendous success. And this year we have, we have, um, let's get the whole lineup here for God's sakes. For God's sakes. We've got Leslie Jones, we've got rich foss, we got Bobby Kelly, Keith Robinson, Gary Gulman, Dan's soda, so right. And myself. Um, it's going to be another great year of, um, I'm just getting to see all those people, you know, I never get to see them anymore because I'm always out here gigging on the road or living out here in la, but pop up up above. So, um, that's going to be, uh, Tuesday, February 21st at the New York City Center. And um, you know, it's just a, it's just a great event and um, thank you to everybody who's come to it in the past years and um, you've guys have done a wonderful thing.

Speaker 1:          00:10:59       I'm keeping all his loved ones comfortable and I'm very proud of that whole charity thing because, um, you know, as tragic as it was that he was gone, I'm very proud of the fact that all of his friends stepped up and that all of his loved ones are comfortable cause I know that that's what he would have been concerned with. So with that, um, I'm actually doing another benefit for those. You can't make it to New York City. If you're in the La area and you would like to, um, you'd like to help out on another benefit. I have another buddy of mine that died. So what happens when you get into your forties, man, it's fucking brutal. Is a couple of your buddies die too young man, it's awful. This Guy Pete coming, I started out with him in um, 1992, um, did stand up with them from 92 to 99 and then he moved on to writing with National Lampoon.

Speaker 1:          00:11:50       He did some stuff for the UFC. Just a great guy. Unfortunately he had a heart attack a few weeks ago and about a month ago. So, uh, Tuesday, December 6th at the laugh factory, I'll be doing a headlining set there and I'm a bunch of pizzas, friends from back in the day, a bunch of comics. We haven't all been on the same show in forever. Probably 20 years. We'll be going on, um, earlier in the night. Uh, it's going to be a great thing and a, it's in memory of him. So there you go. So enough with the friends of mine that have passed away unfortunately. Um, and let's talk about some shit here. I fight. I got it. Why I to give a shout out to fucking Nico Rosberg what in his first Formula One championship, um, the final few laps of that race were amazing. Right? For those of you who are not into it, basically what the situation was, Lewis Hamilton had won the last three. Nico Rosberg had never won. They both drive from Mercedes. Okay. So Nico's, the young upstart Lewis is the grizzled vet, even though they're both fucking young. It was kind of like days of thunder of both. Both people look like fucking Tom Cruise is basically it, right? It's like too Tom, the old Tom Cruise, right? Scientology, Tom Cruise versus fucking, um, what was that movie that they will all in? Whether they were the socials in the greasers the fuck was that movie called? I knew that one.

Speaker 3:          00:13:22       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:13:23       God dammit. What was it called? Matt Dillon was in it. Emilio Estevez as Steph says, uh, the dirty dancing guy, roadhouse guy. The karate kid was in it. Tom Cruise was in it.

Speaker 1:          00:13:40       Who else was in that fucking movie? Everybody was in that fucking movie. Everybody like there was like nine people in that fucking movie. They'd all went, uh, see Thomas Howell, they all went on to star and movies that made, I would love to see how much fucking box office, every, every guy that started as a greaser in that movie ended up making. You know, he got to hate being the one fucking grease or that didn't make it right. That's when you just got to look at yourself like, dude, what the fuck everybody in this ensemble cast? I got to find out what it is now. All right, Tom Cruise. I am DB. How do you spell Kruze Rung? I somehow spelled it with to use a yos. Tom fucking crows. Toyos. All right. There he is. Smiling, looking sort of normal, as normal as he possibly can. Well, what the outsiders, the outsiders. All right, here we go. Let's, let's this, this is the fucking line up. See Thomas how Matt Dillon, Ralph Machio. Patrick Swayze. Rob fucking low. Emilio Estefan is Tom Cruise.

Speaker 3:          00:14:46       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:14:47       All right. That alone right there. One, three, four, five, six. The first seven guys all went on to star in movies. Tom Cruise alone has done billions in box office. Matt Dillon, the amount of money he's done, Ralph Macho, the fucking karate kid, Patrick Swayze, dirty dancing alone. Forget about ghost when they were in the claymation class and what he did. And he comes up behind her and they go, oh wow. The time of my love, Whoopi Goldberg grabbing your tits. I swear Emilio Estefan is right. He was in stake out. He was in fucking, uh, the breakfast club.

Speaker 2:          00:15:35       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:15:36       He was in the cowboy movies, right. And he played Billy the kid come, you know, all these fucking people are, and you've got a guy like Glen Withrow. The fuck happened to him. Diane Lane. She was in a bunt, Leif Garrett. Jesus Christ. He sold a bunch of albums. Tom Waits was in that fucking movie. Then there was a William Smith who plays the store clerk. You went by William, if you went by will, you know, could've been a whole different story. So anyways, I didn't know what the fuck I'm saying. Oh yeah, so Nico Rosberg, right? So here's the deal. The way the points worked out was Lewis Hamilton had the wind. The fucking race provided Nico didn't crash. All right? If Nico is gonna finish the race, Louis had to win the race and Nico had to become in fourth place or worse, and then Louis would have won his fourth in a row.

Speaker 1:          00:16:26       Okay. But a lot of three peat and out there for not nobody. Who the fuck does four in a row? You never see that shit. Right? So it comes down to the La. All Nico had to do was finish in third place and no matter what Lewis Hamilton did, the shit was over. So you get down to like five fucking laps to go. Nico Rosberg, he's in third place, he's a fucking lunatic. He passes. And then it was a red bull car. And all guys, I love the guys who announced it. They're always so fucking, oh like whenever there's a pass. Oh Jo. Oh God. They're always doing that shit. It's like, dude, do you have money in that car? Is that your son in there? I mean after reasonable watching this shit is to see him crash. It's like watching hockey, half bits to watch the game. The other half is to watch somebody beat the fuck out of somebody. I want to, I want to see somebody spin around a little bit. You know, I want to see a fender.

Speaker 1:          00:17:20       Right. So anyways, uh, so it gets down to the last five laps. Nico goes around, whoever the fuck was in second place. How can burger or fucking one of those other guys are Timo Nikunen, Timo, Salani. I don't know any of the end of the year, the other drivers yet. It's my first year watching it. Right. He fucking passes the guy. Now he's in second place. So now Louis is like, what the fuck? So Lewis Hamilton starts slowing down trying to let the third and fourth cars catch up, which they're doing. All right. Now there are a fucking team. They're on the same team. So evidently,

Speaker 3:          00:17:57       yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:17:58       when the head dude and Mercedes, you know, if you're on the Mercedes teams, if you're a team, calls you and tells you to do something. He not supposed to disobey a direct order. I'm telling you, this is like top gun and fucking days. The thunder, sorry. It's just a little touch of a bowl of people, right? So he gives look that they give Lewis the direct order to go and Louis, uh, you got to drive faster here. Come on. We want to win this race.

Speaker 1:          00:18:25       And Louis just says, he just says back into the radio on TV, basically said, um, well, um, I'm still in first place and I'm comfortable with my current position, basically. Meaning like I'm not going to drive any fucking faster and I'm good enough that even if Nico's right on my ass, I know he's not going to try to go around me, you know, risking crashing because he's got it. So for the last five fucking lapse you, I just on the edge of your fucking seat, like is this guy in third place going to go around Nico Rosberg um, he didn't Lewis Hamilton disobeying a direct order. I believe Robert Duvall came out in the end and started screaming at somebody. I can't remember, but, um, it was kind of funny, like whenever, like they're both on the podium, which was almost every race this year. Nico and Louis like wouldn't even look at each other.

Speaker 1:          00:19:18       It was fucking like, oh my God, I'm not even talking to you right now. I'm like, so like not even talking to you right now. Like it was that whole fucking energy. So when Nico, when's the thing, they actually shook hands and there was some fucking clown interview and I'm going, oh, I kind of blocked the shot. Can you guys do that again? It was great. And then they just sort of begrudgingly shook hands or whatever and the guy just goes, oh, that's great. It's a, it's all good again, or something like that. It's like, dude, it's very far from all good again. So, um, I believe the season starts up again, either the end of March or the beginning of April, and I jumped on this year after they raced in Monaco and I had a great time fucking watching it. And I actually started to think of the sheer amount of fucking money it must cost to have a Goddamn to run a Formula One team. I can't imagine how much fucking money you got to ship that car around the fucking world like nine times. And you know, you've got a couple of other cars you've got to bring with it. It's got to cost you $1 billion. It has to,

Speaker 1:          00:20:18       does it bill? Have you ever tried to ship even your fucking Prius to Connecticut now? So then you really don't know how much it costs. Ah, you got me. Whatever. I know it's got to cost a lot of fucking money there, right? So anyways, anybody watch Ohio State, Michigan? I know this is kind of old games, but I don't give a fuck. Did you guys watch that? It's one of the best games I've seen between those two in a long fucking time. And, um, Michigan just kept fucking up when they got the ball. They had the Goddamn game one. Do you notice how, what's his face there? The whatever reason, I can never remember their last name. The fucking coach and Michigan. Jim Harbaugh. Do you notice he was wearing the woody Hayes glasses? I actually had a theory that if they won, he was going to take the glasses off on their fucking logo on the 50 yard line and steps stomp on him.

Speaker 1:          00:21:09       You know, like after Jewish people get married, they step on the fucking glass. He was going to do that with the fucking his, his woody Hayes glasses. And I loved that he called out the referee and, and all that shit. You know, I'm not saying I 100% agreed with them and all that shit, but uh, you know, I thought they got to call right on their first down. I stood up too when I saw a live action. It was like, yeah. And then I saw a fuck. He got it. I thought he got it. Anyways. Um, but all my Michigan Buddies, they were all texting me. That was a home job and all this type of shit. So who do you like guys? It's probably going to be Alabama, right? That had a nice, had an easy time with fucking Auburn. She, the kicker for Auburn, he grew up in an Alabama family roll tide family in Alabama. Didn't give him a scholarship. So he, he, he goes to fucking Auburn now and his grandfather calls him turncoat fucking lunatics down there. Right? Scary Danielson. The whole gang keeps going. It was turncoat kicking it for three.

Speaker 1:          00:22:11       I didn't think this podcast is remotely funny, but maybe, maybe just laughing at me. Coughing up a fucking lung here. Um, anyway, so it's going to be Alabama and I'm going to say it's going to be Ohio state for the championship and he has old Billy red face. Having only watched about 15 college games this year, having never played beyond the third grade level. This is my prediction. All right. Organized. Anyways, I played enough pickup football for the first time ever throw up my back was playing fucking football and uh, it's never been the same, you know? No, it's not the first time. First Time was when that kid put me in the figure four leg lock and fourth grade outdoor recess. That's the first time I threw it out. The next time was playing football. And then the third time was another wrestling thing. I tried to lift my younger brother up over my head, like Tony Atlas and the the upper third of my spine folded.

Speaker 1:          00:23:08       It felt like, and uh, you know, that's giving me problems ever since then. You know, it's probably why I leaned on the mic stuff. Anyways, plowing ahead here. I think it's going to be, it's going to be fucking Ohio state, Alabama. Obviously I'm picking the number one and two teams and I think, uh, Alabama Beats Ohio state this time simply because I thought Ohio state had a lot of problems with debt defense there in Michigan. Um, and I think Alabama's defense is even better and Alabama's offense is not going to make the fucking mistakes that Michigan's, um, offense made. You know, you don't watch an Alabama team and they fumble a fucking snap on the one yard line. They just don't do shit like that. You know what I mean? Cause what's his face? Nick Saban, that Luna ticket, he probably fucking waterboard you. How angry it dude.

Speaker 1:          00:24:00       You know, that guy makes me feel good about my anger when I see that guy. I was joking about this. I did, uh, Jeff's a as podcast and we will fucking joking about, my favorite fucking thing to do is to watch Alabama going in like down by seven at halftime. I love when the halftime report, it comes up and starts talking to Nick Saban and the, the look of fucking anger on his face. All he wants to do is go into the locker room and call everybody's mother a cunt that's wearing his uniform, right? And, but he's got to sit there and talk to some chicken. The sidelight go. I like,

Speaker 4:          00:24:34       so why do you think it is your dad by eight to me?

Speaker 1:          00:24:37       I said, just sit there. You know, he just wants to slap the wig right off her fucking head. But he doesn't do it. He doesn't know it. He sits there with his fucking, I dunno what it is on his head, you know, he makes Donald Trump look like fucking a Fabio. I'm trying to think of somebody who has good here. Who the fuck he been has good hair and you never even know anymore, right? Everybody goes around, they get, they get the troops from the back, you know, peeling. But the potatoes get put out right up on the front line. Now there's now what they do. Then everybody goes swimming and nobody knows what's going on, right? Tell you. It takes a real man like myself to walk around looking like Charlie Brown. I'm telling you. Redheaded, Charlie Brown. Um. Anyways, let's read some advertising here for this week, everybody.

Was there anything else I wanted to fucking talk about? Uh, oh dude, I started going through my shit cause I'm, I'm, I'm selling my Prius, right? So I'm going back and I'm trying to find the title to my car and of course I can't find this fucking thing. And I find the title to my wife's car, to my car and my old truck. And I also found a copy of a title to this 88 Honda accord. I had like fucking 15 years ago I had the DX Lx, the LX five speed manual transmission. What a great fucking car that was. God Damn it. I loved that car. Um, I found a copy of that, but nothing for the Prius and I gotta go fucking to the DMV and get a copy of it and all that bullshit.

Speaker 1:          00:32:52       Um, ended up getting rid of that shit. Move on with my fucking life. Um, yeah. Get a fucking God damn conference call coming to Pune. 10 minutes. I'll have to finish the rest of the podcast later. I apologize. You know, it's what it is. Patriots, jets. Did you watch that? How fucking awful that our defense look in the first fucking half. Good Lord. Um, I mean, I know were banged up and everything, but uh, I don't know. Remember that time when we traded Richard Seymour long time ago in every Patriot fan was like, dude, what the fuck did we do that for? And then the people who were kind of paying attention and we're like, well look, it was a deal. Next year he's going to be up for free agency. He was going to ask for a zillion dollars and we knew we weren't going to give it to them and then we would have gotten nothing for him.

Speaker 1:          00:33:40       So we traded him the year before I went on this website and they showed all the trickle down from that thing, that trade, um, and all the players we got, how we could be more aggressive because of what we got from Richard Seymour. I'm hoping the same thing is that happened this year with a, I didn't know if we traded Chen Chandler Jones and we lost him to free agents, free agency. But, uh, they're fucking dude that we sent to Cleveland, which I keep with Jamie Collins. Maybe that'll turn into something, but, uh, I dunno, it's unhealthy as we are. I'm not, I'm not, I dunno, I'm not giving up. I never came up. I'm just saying, you know what the fuck. It's the God damned jets. They will fucking go and crazy to every fucking play they made. They were going fucking nuts. You know, like they just fucking like, that was their playoff game, which I respected.

Speaker 1:          00:34:32       They fucking came to play. But anyways, so this whole fucking weekend, all I did was watch football and I, and I was looking for that title and in the process of looking for the title, I cleaned up a bunch of my shit and I was kind of thinking with a kid coming along, um, I'm not going to have time to do shit, but life is going to keep hitting me. So I want to know where all my insurance forms are. We're every fucking piece of legal shit that I need. You know what I mean? Like the lengthy tracking number and all that. I'm getting all of that stuff organized and um, I had all these fucking shit that I held on to for, I had like fucking my insurance auto insurance contract from like 2007 until now. And I'm like, it expires 12 months after you get it.

Speaker 1:          00:35:16       Bill, you've held under this shit for nine years longer than you need to. So I shredded a lot of shit, but a underrated, just finally going through your office and just organizing everything. I kinda know where like everything is now. And uh, I want to, I want to do that kind of for everything that I have. So when my kid comes here and then take some marker out and draws all over everything, I'll know where the fucking insurance shit is. All right, let's, let's read 'em. Let's read some, uh, some questions here for the week. Stan. Hope special is, is somebody writing it about the great. Doug Stanhope said, Hey, bill used your promo code to sign up for CSO so I could watch stand hopes new special. I've heard nothing but great things. He said, Holy Shit, you're still my favorite bill, but Stan hope is a genius.

Speaker 1:          00:36:07       Why do you guys always have to do that? You still going to take the piss out of me? I know. He's fucking tremendous. You know, why can't you just say, this guy's a great comedian. I'll dye it bell. I it, but this guy over here. Yeah, everybody in the Internet's got to do that. If you have a good band, someone's got to just sit there and be like, dude, I love you guys, but it's fucking Doug. Stan Hope, man. He's a fucking, I know he's a genius. You didn't have to take the piss out of me and he's fucking better than I am fucking cunt. Um, he said, I wish more people knew about them. I felt the same way about you years ago when you were just a comedy baby. Uh, tell you people at Netflix to give them the Chappelle treatment. Uh, love you, man. Um, yeah, I've heard nothing but great shit about that.

Speaker 1:          00:36:50       I'm sorry. That's the last of the, the, the Ricola eaten on the mic. Kind of a fucking amateur am my, um, all right, well what you're telling me, every comedian has known about Doug Stan hope since probably the late nineties. And um, Doug is, um, ever watched those cop movies. You know, when you know that guy, he always has to turn in his badge cause he's doing shit outside the system, but he's got a good heart and in the end he arrest the bad guy and it's all good. That's who Stan hope is. Right. But the entertainment industry hasn't figured that out yet. But eventually he will be standing on their fucking city hall steps as they give them the key to the city. I'm hoping, but, um, my rule with all of these guys is I don't watch this standup special just cause I can't have an hour and an hour and a half of this shit floating around in my head because it'll influence, you know, I'm of two paranoid about that.

Speaker 1:          00:37:46       But my rule is that with all these guys, Rogan, Stan Hope, Louie Chappelle, all of these guys that if they come into a comedy club that I'm at and, uh, they're going to go do a set, I will watch them. That's how I do it. But I don't watch their specials cause I'm too paranoid about any sort of overlap or whatever. But, um, having said that, every time Doug stand, hope's specials come out always, always, always for like three to six months afterwards, comics had just taken me aside and go, dude, have you seen Stan hopes new fucking special? Um, yeah, he's fucking incredible. And um, I don't know. Well, I dunno why. I Dunno. Why, what it is about comics like that, that they just, uh, I dunno if the industry just won't give the same, I don't, you know what it is at the end of the day where if you ever have a question about an artist you like, just imagine Doug Stan hope on TV trying to sell your Ritz crackers. Okay. How long could he talk about those crackers before they would have a major fucking pro? And I think that's what it comes down to. All right?

Speaker 1:          00:39:00       There's the people that are truly are the greats. And then there's the people that are really good, but they won't fucking, you know, they can sell a box of Ritz crackers. That's what it kind of comes down to it. Doug. Stan hope is one of those fucking guy is what makes them great. So maybe that's what it is. I liked that this guys like that. You got to have the fucking row guys. You know what I mean? You can't have everybody just fucking hanging out with a, I don't know, Eddie show Biz, you know, at a fucking, you know, in an election party. You know what I mean? And talking about issues, hi, I'm fucking sandy sands, Sam cakes and I'm here to talk about the fucking, uh, the slaughter of baby seals and all of that. You know, that main stream, like, um, step off your private jet.

Speaker 1:          00:39:50       Take the time to give a fuck for 20 minutes before you go back to yelling at your personal assistant. There's that level of uh, connecting with people and then there's what Stan hope does, where he fucking goes, where they're at. That guy is literally played, I would say, you know, let's say there's 10,000 comedy clubs in this country. He's played at least 9,998 of them. That fucking guy has played as much as I've done a bunch of [inaudible]. That guy has been fucking everywhere and that's why, that's why he's as good as he is, that his work ethic, he's fucking prolific. He's one of my favorites of all time. So I wish I knew what the name of the specialist maybe I can like go to look at. I'll look that up. You know what? I got to hit pause. I got this fucking conference call.

Speaker 1:          00:40:38       I'll be right back. And I'll also have the name of the special. What do think about that? And this will be like fucking like an eighth of a second year life. Just like those fucking millennials. What? They're virtual reality glasses. What's that over there in la, which I fucking hate that commercial where the kids are sitting there freaking the fuck out. Like they don't realize that it's not a real world. And then the greedy corporate constant, what do they got to do? They've got to have the old curmudgeon guy like me actually older than me. And then what are you kids do? And then he puts it on and then of course he's completely enamored, right? And now he's going to be into the shit. Get the fuck Outta here. Fuck those glasses. I swear to God man, like the amount of people that are going to get mugged while they have those fucking things on in public. Cause I'll tell you right now, these fucking kids are so God damn stupid. They're wearing one of those and like on a city bus and just fucking have it on there. You know what I mean? It's like walking into why Cornell's little fucking baskets

Speaker 5:          00:41:33       with what? Cobra in there and you stick your head in with your virtual reality glass glasses and he can't see the snake anymore because you're in fucking a middle earth. Ah, the old man's coming out of me this week. All right. Hang on a second. All right. And I'm back just like that. An hour of fucking conference calling. Huh? Don't you wish you were me? Is there anything better than a conference call? Hey, let's get on and make a call and have a conference. Everybody can talk and share ideas. Have another hour your life go by that you're never going to get back. All right. You know, this is how old I am. You know what's on my Christmas list this year? You know it, this pajamas, I've had the same pair of fucking pajamas for like, I don't, I don't even know how long. Like, I dunno, maybe, uh, early two thousands, you know, I'm trying to think. All this shit that I've watched on TV and these jam jams and they've just had it. It's fucking over and I've actually dropped. Not even the hint I just demanded. And you get to when you get to be my age, cause no one gives a shit about you anymore. You can't ask for something for Christmas. You got to start. You got to make demands with like a touch of a threat. Okay. I'm just saying,

Speaker 1:          00:42:50       okay, just throw, putting this out there, but we'd be in everybody's best interest if I've got some new pajamas this Christmas. That's all I'm saying. Okay. Huh? You like where you live in, you liked it.

Speaker 5:          00:43:06       There better be some jam jams under the fucking tree. Um, anyways and then no matter what, then you end up being wrong. Like I had a fucking argument with my wife this week about the way she fucking, you know, stacks up the dishes in the sink. You know what I mean? I don't know if your wife does this shit, but there'll be like a pot sitting in the fucking sink and then they have a plate. Right? What did they do? They stick the plate on top of the thing and then they take another bowl and they stick it on top of the plate and then he just got this leaning Tower of Horse Shit and you fucking sink. It's like, why don't you put the plate underneath the pot and then just see if the pot can fit in a ball. The ball can fit in the fucking pot and then it takes like a third of this space. You know, you haven't take a door to that fucking

Speaker 5:          00:43:55       Jane can, you know, make, rather than make it look like this, 10 weeks of fucking dishes here. This is like two meals, you know, one of those fucking, one of those fucking dumb arguments where you end up getting in your car and driving away and then afterwards you're just sitting there going, what the fuck? I'm literally driving down the street right now, contemplating giving this woman everything that I own in moving into a one bedroom apartment over the way. She stacks dishes in the sink. But I'll tell you when you live with somebody, it seems so fucking important. All right, time off. Dear Billy body, I think you're awesome. Thank you. And I have a crush on you and I'm,

Speaker 6:          00:44:33       hey,

Speaker 5:          00:44:34       hey, you go at that. The left term was going to be, and I'm a dude. I love that you take care of yourself and are always striving to be better. If this is great, you know what, if I were you guys listening to this right now, I would be highly suspect of whether or not I actually wrote this in my husband and I haven't seen you live yet. And we want, we want to this year. If you happen to be coming back to Wisconsin, well where the hell were you a few months ago? You know, when did you develop this crush in October? I was there in September. Uh, do you think you'll be touring as much or will you be taking the year off to spend time with your newborn? Love you and I love Nia. Um, oh, I'm totally going to be the absentee father. I already have that worked out.

Speaker 5:          00:45:19       You know, we're going to be doing like 56 weeks on the road. No, obviously my schedule would be a little bit different. Um, be honest with you. I'd, I don't know. Um, I do know, however, that, um, you know, when I was getting ready to do my special rather than doing one night in every city, you know, when I did that little, I played a smaller theater and I spent a week in Durham, like just Thursday, Friday, Saturday. And I, it's, it was so much more enjoyable way of doing the road rather than doing one night in Durham one night and fucking Poughkeepsie one night here. It just becomes a fucking thrash. And when you were an older fellow like myself, you know, I liked going to a place, hanging out with the people, seeing where they eat, going to a game. That's how I always fucking did it.

Speaker 5:          00:46:09       So I'm going to try to do more of that. And I was just in Madison and funny you should bring up going back to Milwaukee. Uh, uh, Wisconsin was, I haven't been to Milwaukee and um, well I guess it was October of, it's amazing. I can always remember this. It was like October of 2015 so it's been a, we'll call it December at this point. So it's been 14 months. So, um, definitely in 2017 not only will I be coming back to Milwaukee, uh, I plan on spending like three, four days there because that Milwaukee had not only a great cigar bar, it had the best fucking steam of any place I've ever been to. And it was at a hotel called the Pfister. I swear to God, it the hotel is called the Pfister. It's P, f. I. S. T. E. R. If you add Milwaukee, dude, I'm telling you man, Milwaukee, don't sleep on Milwaukee.

Speaker 5:          00:47:08       Great people, great food, great fucking Lake Front property for a song, right? And the sickest fucking steam room you're ever going to go in to, you get your own private like lifestyles of the rich and famous fucking, it's, it's unbelievable. So, um, no, when you get to be my fucking age, that's the type of shit appealing to you on the road. You know what I mean? It's not like God, Dude, you got to go to Miami. They got all these hot chicks down there. I'm a fucking creepy old married guy. Where is there a steam room? Listen to me. I got to Berkeley. Losis

Speaker 3:          00:47:47       okay.

Speaker 5:          00:47:48       I ain't got time for the WHO was, um, anyways, so yeah, tonight I'm actually doing the Steve Allen Theater and whenever the fuck they calling it now, and I'm just basically running my whole new hour. I'm so fucking excited. I've gotten past the whole mourning period of missing my old jokes, um, past the hole. Now I'm not as funny as I was on stage. Now, you know, I took all the bullets out of the gun. I'm shooting fucking blanks up here. Um, this is my favorite fucking thing in the world. I'm so excited tonight about the show. Um, and just seeing where it goes. And I've got a couple of buddies of mine coming down who were musicians, so they're going to get to see that whole fucking, because I already told them, I was like, all right, you guys want to come down. This is gonna. This is gonna be the real deal.

Speaker 5:          00:48:32       This is not the old tried and true. They're all right. Coping with being single. Uh, oh, I already liked this right here. Hey Billy, master of fuck. It's, um, I've been single my entire life. I'm into my later twenties and still haven't found any lady that I really hit it off with. I've struggled with being single for a long time, but had been working through it. I'm okay with it, but I still have my dark moments. My question to you is, when you were single for all those years, did you ever get lonely or feel alone? Uh, did you ever think you'd be single forever? What helped you to endure through those times and how did you cope with it? Yes to all of that. Yup. As I figured some things out, I've been doing bucket lists, types of stuff that helps me get through it.

Speaker 5:          00:49:22       Yeah, dude, that's a great thing to do when you're single. Go do all that shit you want to do cause a, you know, you meet somebody else. Yeah. You know, you might not have the time. This person says, I've gone to see some of my favorite bands play live. I've traveled a little and I've been working towards finding a career path that I really enjoy. So I believe I'm doing some good things, but I still have my days when I suffer through it a little. Uh, but I've learned to sit in that pain for a bit and find good things. Uh, saying something dumb at work. Oh, that's the next one. I thought that was the guy signing off or the woman, whoever the fuck this is a, all right. My question to you is, you've been single all those years. Did you ever get lonely or feel alone? Here's the thing, I was never lonely for the first, I don't know how many years am I in life until I had a girlfriend and then lost my girlfriend. And then after that, that's the first time I felt like, oh, I don't have a chick. It's weird.

Speaker 3:          00:50:19       Okay.

Speaker 5:          00:50:20       I didn't have my first serious girlfriend till I was like 23, something like that, 22, 23 years old. So I was fine

Speaker 1:          00:50:28       with being single. And that thing lasted like, I dunno, like eight, nine months. And uh, I ended up breaking up with her and that was right before I started doing stand up. And, um, I remember the first six weeks of being like, fuck, how long is it going to take for me to get over this person? And um, it's weird, man. Like getting over a person, it's like, it's like Quintin, the booze. It's a habit. They're a habit. You know what I mean? I always call them at this time. Then he got to fill up those fucking times. But you just can't fill him up. You of got to go through the mourning of them not being there anymore and then you start filling them up with other stuff. But like, dude, I think travel, seeing bands and everything, the great thing is too, the fact that you aren't lady, the fact that you're single and you feel alone is a very healthy thing.

Speaker 1:          00:51:22       You know what I mean? Now, if you were totally fucking single and you didn't feel lonely at all, well I guess maybe, you know, maybe you're just a fucking someone who doesn't want to be with anybody. That could also be because as long as you're not out killing people, you know what I mean? As long as you don't feel the need to hunt your, you're not feeling that. And as long as you're all right with whatever it is you're doing, then you should be fine too. During your fucking late twenties through, trust me, someday you're going to be married, you're going to have a fucking kid coming like I got right now and you'll all of a sudden all your drum videos you thinking, I'm going to guide you gotta gotta get rid of those. I got to get rid of all his shit. I got to get rid of all of this stuff and there's this feeling that I'm having right now.

Speaker 1:          00:51:59       Will I ever played drums again? But fortunately I married the coolest woman ever so I just was able to sit down with her. This, this might help you if you're afraid to get in a relationship cause you feel like you're going to lose all of this stuff. You just let the person you're with know what's important. I already said to my wife, I said, listen, here's the deal. Like once a week. Okay. You pick a day, once a week when this kid is not sleeping through the night and you can just go somewhere, get a massage or just go someplace and fucking sleep. Or I'll take the kid and go drive around. I'll let you sleep for fucking hours and hours, whatever the hell it is. Okay. All you gotta do is let me keep playing drums, taking drum lessons in that shit. That'll be my spot thing. Cause I don't really need to sleep cause I'm a fucking lunatic.

Speaker 1:          00:52:45       And also I'll still get to do the road twice a month and you know, I'll use that time to sleep. I'll do my shows at night and then I'll go right to the hotel and I was sleep till the fucking cats come home, the cows come, whatever the fucking animal is and then I'll come back recharged, you know what I mean? But we, we make sure that we kind of worked that stuff out with each other. So, um, if you're afraid to get in a relationship, just know that there's a cool people out there as long as you, uh, I dunno. Yeah. You never hear me say this, but women in general pretty cool if you just tell him what the fucking deal is. Um, but I have issues with women. So even as I said that, just picturing how many women just

Speaker 5:          00:53:26       went like, oh my God, yes. That like, that annoyed me, even though they were agreeing with me. It's weird. I got a lot of fucking issues. So, um, yeah, I definitely felt, I felt like I was never going to meet the one. I felt like there was something wrong with me and all of this type of shit. Just know this. Every one of your friends that's in a relationship is secretly envious of you, even if they're with the right person. That's how much fucking work it is. You know, every once in a while, you know, I look at fucking, um, you know, I look at it, I'll look at a playboy like Joe de Rosa and I'll be like, God damn it, man. What the fuck did he's got? He's getting always key skis, living the life, you know, but then, you know, you come home and your wife make some fucking cookies.

Speaker 5:          00:54:09       You're like, this is pretty cool too. All right, saying something dumb. It works. So what I was saying to this person, you, you, you fine dude, you're in your late twenties. I'm the same way that you have goals with um, your career in bucket list stuff should have, she should have some goals about the kind of person that you want to be with like a women after you actually do shit like that. Women actually sit down and think about the kind of, guys don't do that. We just sort of Ping Pong and wrong. I'll stick my fucking Dick in that. You know, we're idiots. But if you actually, you know, get a little bill Bellacheck, you know, see what's missing. You know, from your half, see what you're looking for. What do you want? You know, do you want a woman that wants kids? Do you want a woman that can cook a, your traditional, do you want a career woman? Like, what do you want? You know, I can tell you right now, if you want a woman that can cook, we'll actually sit down and cook. Woo. Tell you right now that's like a, I dunno, you know like every, once every, I don't know how many years they, they have that and that 1983 draft, like women do not foe women's do not be cooking anymore. All this feminism shit. It's really a sad thing. But men have, you know, it's our fault because we didn't put a value on it.

Speaker 7:          00:55:23       Great. I'm out there busting my ass. You Ain't here pickling cucumbers, right.

Speaker 5:          00:55:27       Just gave him shit. Making a meal for somebody who's one of the nicest things she could have a do, you know? But what happened? How we talk, shit we gave, we didn't give him a fucking respect him. Now look up. They don't want to cook up. Be Mothers. They're out there running around Willy Nilly wearing pantsuits running in, running for president of the United States.

Speaker 7:          00:55:45       I mean, you know that. That's a man job.

Speaker 5:          00:55:50       Okay. You know, the funniest fucking thing ever is how sick you have to be to want to be president. The fact that Hillary Clinton is depressed right now, that she didn't get a job where she was going to have to put her head on the pillow every night knowing she just made a decision that bombs would just dropped and possibly landed on somebody's baby and she, she's, she's depressed that she didn't get that fucking job. It's unbelievable. What do you think are pajamas look like? She definitely has the fucking guy once, right? Like the flannel ones wearing the pants suits. Um, I liked the pant suits. I don't know why everybody gave a shit about it. And I always liked Rhoda, you know, Rhoda, Mary Tyler Moore, they fucking fill those things out, you know, walking around with the little bungees up against that Rayon. All right. Say something dumb at work saying something dumb at work.

Speaker 5:          00:56:41       Okay. What do we got here? Um, yeah. Fuck you guys. Mind if I just do the last bit of, you know what, that's a country move.

That's, that's two o's. All right. All right. Here's my problem. I was at, I was at Work Party, I think you mean at a work party? Talking to my colleagues. I work as an RN in an ICU. Okay. That's a registered nurse in an intensive care unit. Uh Huh. I have some nurses in my family. Uh, we have a new

Speaker 5:          00:57:26       to our unit higher joining us, but she's worked as a nurse for 25 years already. My friends said she's joining my rotation. I say out loud in my typical bill blurp burn a inflection. Oh, Jj [inaudible]. No. How Ge is another old broad in our line there, several colleagues heard this and now every day is some new twist on my comment. Some chirping is fine, but half the unit is over 50. I want some joke comment. I don't want some Joe comment to hope haunt me for years. Bill, how do I get this to go away? Thanks. Um, I would just say it with them. I, I just, I wouldn't back off and I would just keep doing the Archie bunker and she's another little broad on a line there. And then when they, they, yeah, this lady to World and Oh God, all of you with your menopause, the, but you can't do that at work now. You can't do that work now because you're not making it a safe place. This is a safe space.

Speaker 5:          00:58:33       Oh my God. That alone, that alone gave Trump about 200,000 folks fucking adults saying, you're not making this a safe space. I just fucking did. They all have a meeting and they came up with that fucking horrific that, that what was the second choice? I just don't understand that. Uh, you know something, I have to be honest with you. I don't know how you get out of that. And right there. That's why I do what I do for a fucking living because there's no way I could be in that level of a childish fucking environment that people, oh, what did you mean about that? What are, what about how many fucking thoughts have you had in your head today? Your old fucking bag. Then if they were publicized that you would even still have a job as a nurse. Get the fuck Outta here.

Billy the cunt. It's Martin from Sweden. Thank you for this podcast. No worries. Uh, it's been more than 10 years since I was almost raped in Syria. What the fuck? Although time passes, the story seems to never get old.

Speaker 2:          01:06:32       All right.

Speaker 5:          01:06:34       You know, I, I, you really just going to fuck with me on this God damn level here. Am I supposed to believe this is true? How time flies? It's like you're, you're looking back fondly on this. This is weird. I was 17 when me and my class went on a school trip to Syria, puts in parentheses, Middle East. Go Fuck yourself, Jason. I know, I know American. I know we're serious. All right. One day all of my classmates were out snorkeling. I stayed in the hostel bed because I had a fever. Two aspirins later I found myself out looking for my class in Sana like temperatures with a foolish mindset. My blonde, blue eyed nature, fig figured the aspirin had cured my fever. So I was in quite good spirits for about seven miles of searching for the other Swedes. This is creeping me out. Now.

Speaker 5:          01:07:26       The fever was kicking back and in at this point, uh, and I'd given up my endeavors of snorkeling. I didn't know where I was or how to get back to my hostel. At that moment, a taxi pulled over. The driver asked if I wanted to get a lift. I said I didn't have any money to offer, but he insisted that no money was needed for the ride. Oh, Jesus is right. Yes. High fever and good amounts of gullibility led me to step into the cab and off we went. Hi, welcome to Siri. The taxi guy said, you are very beautiful. I didn't want to be rude, so I said, thanks back at him. Then he asked me if I liked women. Sure. I replied that he asked if I liked big women share. I said, he said, ah, you like big because same with your Dick.

Speaker 2:          01:08:14       He said,

Speaker 5:          01:08:16       what? At this point I regretted getting to the what the fuck? Ah, you like big because same with your Dick. He said, okay. I thought this was a woman, so it's a guy and others, dude. Oh Jesus. Here we go. At this point, I regret getting to the taxi very much in the moment after he was reaching for my package while he was driving, oh two that's, oh you in the front seat. That's when you got to do, what was that fucking Schwartzenegger movie? Or he gets on the plane with that guy and he pretends to tie his shoe when he comes up with the elbow, a death and drives this spine of his nose into his brain and then puts his little fucking a Tommy Bahama ad over his face and he goes, don't disturb him. He's dead tired. That's what you needed to do was that rod deal.

Speaker 5:          01:09:05       I think he needed to go rod deal there anyways. I say, no stop. I said, but the tracks, he driver was very persistent. He wondered why he couldn't touch my penis. Like I owed him the right to do so. I was feeling extremely vulnerable. Being a teenager foreigner and having a high fever and all. I shouted at him to stop the car, but he kept on going, dude, you got to start going Dave. The Hammer Schultes here. Right? You got to fuck. And he got to start swinging, man. Uh, but he kept on going. I thought about jumping out of the car, but I was, it was going way too fast. I also didn't want to start a fight and risk crashing the car. Ah, Jesus. At some point, dude, you got to pick your poison. Did it have airbags? Picture pictures of Taliban rape Cade's with pulp fiction.

Speaker 5:          01:09:54       Kim's suits and gag balls was entering my mind as the taxi car continued to drive on without any intent to pull over. This is really happening. Oh my Lord. I thought to myself, luckily we came to a traffic light and I managed to get out of the car and on the pavement. I started running when I heard him screaming at me. One Syrian pounds, Mr Oh God. Now you're going to get paid for forget. You got to pay him from moving less than you. I got over the experience pretty soon. [inaudible] have not affected my life to any extent. No fucking way. People sometimes want me to tell the almost raped story and given pressures of the taxi driver. I can't help to think how of unfunny it would be if I were a girl almost getting raped in Syria. Yeah, but you're a guy so it's fucking hell.

Speaker 5:          01:10:42       Everything that happens to a guy's hilarious. Nobody gives a shit. My question to you is, why is this kind of a, why is this story kind of funny if it happened to men but awful in every way, if it happened to a woman, you're thoughts on that after you go fuck yourself. PSA hide a lovely new, um, this is why it's funny because you're able to fight them off. It's a guy with an accent grabbing your Dick when you tell this story. I, my friend, my friend, just like your Dick Beep beep, right? It's just hilarious. I remember one night we were down in the comedy cellar. We were all telling stories about getting molested as kids. And it was one of the funniest nights I've ever had. It was so fucking Cathartic and we would just cry and laughing. And I remember all the comics where, you know, I dunno, had a different upbringing.

Speaker 5:          01:11:31       We're looking at it like it was fucked up, but it was fucking hilarious to me. Um, and if you told me this story, I would be laughing my ass off. It's still knowing that you, you probably have some sort of fucking issue and all depends. It all depends. You know, if that was the first person that ever touched you, you know, no girl ever. He gave you a hand job. The fact that it was the first guy that ever did it, you know, his Harry fucking hand coming over, you know, they could possibly fuck you up, but you know, okay, he had a little bit of sexual activity. Maybe it doesn't, you know, it's kind of like, you know, if you're a relief pitcher and you, you got to, he got some saves on your belt. You let up a home run. Yeah, give me another fucking ball.

Speaker 5:          01:12:06       But if that's your first fucking pitch, I mean, that could fuck with. Yeah. Um, why is it not funny? Uh, when it happens to a woman's a same reason why it's like watching a guy get punched in the head is fucking funny. You know, if he was like talking shit, it's fucking funny. You know what I mean? But like, you know, kids, women, animals like this, just never anything funny about watching them get abused. But there's just something hilarious about guys. I would say the reason why you get having your Dick grabbed and getting molested is funny is the same reason why the three stooges is funny. You know? Imagine the three stooges, if it was women grabbing each other by the hair and slapping each other, the faith, maybe that'd be a little funny. I Dunno. It's just like a guy thing. We like slapstick and there's just something funny about him grabbing your fuck stick in some car and then he charged one Syrian pounds, you know.

Speaker 5:          01:13:04       Well it really comes down to is I imagined being gay is not accepted even remotely in serious. So this guy thought like all right, even if this doesn't go down or if it does go down, this story leaves this country and goes back to Sweden. Uh, so in the way I'm going to say the cab driver was the victim and not you. And stop being so selfish. Now I'm fucking with you. I'm sorry that happened to you. Um, well you do. I mean, I mean you were kind of asking for, cause you were on cold medication. You know, I'm going to blame the victim here. Well, I mean, what were you wearing? Um, I dunno dude. That's one of the more, uh, I want to say that's one of the more fucked up stories I've ever heard. But uh, yeah, that, that's just goes into that file. I've heard enough of those ones. Um, yeah, that's why it's not funny. Um, so I would actually say that you are fucked up. There's no way you're not fucked up cause that happened to you. And there's, um, there's that feeling where it's just like, why is that funny when that happens to a guy and then you feel like you can't fucking a, that you should should just, yeah. You know, I'm over it. Like why would, that's a horrific fucking thing that happened to you. And I'm even like over the whole thing,

Speaker 1:          01:14:12       cause it's a guy like, hey, you know, fucking shake it off, shake it off. And that's part of growing up. It's always meet you have a paper route or something like that. There'll be some Weirdo come in at your junk at some point.

Speaker 5:          01:14:25       But that's just how it is. I remember when that fucking, I'm that lady. Cut The dude's Dick off and put it in the garbage disposal. One of those shows. It's not the view. I think it's the talk, the Asian Lady, she was reading it and as she was reading the details, they're all snickering, laughing.

Speaker 3:          01:14:43       Okay.

Speaker 5:          01:14:43       And I remember the bid I was doing one of some guy cut a woman's tiddy off and threw in the garbage disposal. I mean, they would have done a week long special on that and they would have tried to help the lady out raise some money to get her a prosthetic. You know what I mean? So a broad wouldn't be all lopsided. That's what the fuck they do. But it happens to a guy. It's just fucking hilarious. And I also think that that's why guys are so fucking funny.

Speaker 3:          01:15:04       Yeah.

Speaker 5:          01:15:05       You know, cause uh, you know, if a woman gets molested, it's a tragedy. If it happens to a guy, it's a sketch. We really don't have any options. You just got to shake it off, man.

Speaker 5:          01:15:21       You know, having said all that, dude, I'm sorry that happened to you. I'm sure you're emotionally fucked up about it. But I would love to hear that story one time cause I want to hear you imitating the guy, you know, and then listen to everybody get interrupted. So wait, how fast were you going dude? You could jump on in the car. He's grabbing it day and then everybody be laugh ago. Yeah, but if you jumped out then he'd be like holding onto your Dick. Like Steve has happened, the car half part of the car, right. Stretching out your deck, you know, then you have one of those needle dicks cause it's not going to give you any more girth. He's just going to weed out. That's what the whole fucking thing would be. And then all your friends would laugh and say that you wanted it. You know what I mean? Why don't you sit in the back like a normal person? Why did you sit up front? You know, that's what guys would do and they would laugh. You know, you'd just laugh your way through it. So anyways, I guess I'm going to stop there on the, uh,

Speaker 1:          01:16:10       I can't, let's stop on something positive. Once again, I have two benefits that are coming up to two friends of mine that are no longer here. Um, Pete Coming, um, memorial is going to be December 6th at the laugh factory. I will tweet that link and the Patrice O'Neal, the five year anniversary of his passing is today. And um,

Speaker 1:          01:16:31       the one truly positive thing that came out of that is we get to remember him and we get to see our friends and we get to raise some money for his loved ones every year. And it's going to be February 21st a Tuesday 2017 at the New York City Center. Um, thank you to all who, uh, take the time to check it out and buy some tickets. It means the world to me. That's it.
