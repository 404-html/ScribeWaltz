Speaker 1:          00:00:01       Hey, what's going on? It's bill burn his time for the Monday morning podcast from Monday, March 28th, 2016 the year of the Yac whatever the fuck it is. And the Chinese New Year. I have no ideas and they had new year. Next, next, uh, next month. How does that work with those people? You know how to like, I don't, I don't get it. I just don't, I don't understand why we're on standard and everybody else's on metric. Can we just pick one fucking calendar, one unit of measurement. You fucked over Europe. Jesus Christ metric. And then some old guys talk. Hey, way fucking 20 stone, 20 stone. I mean, I guess we're still saying horsepower. Jesus. Fucking, well, what size stone?

Speaker 1:          00:00:49       What are you a fucking free mason? Um, she buddy in the Illuminati. Is that where he's at now? The little secret group. You think you're gonna make it buying up land on the aquifers? Is that what you're going to do? And then what? Ha. All the robots are gonna take everything over, right? You phase everybody out, but a big, except you and then you, you guys, you guys going to be good. And then all the robots, for some reason I'm going to turn him. He fucking movies you need to watch before you realize that they're eventually going to turn on. You stuck out. You made a fucking robot now, which choke when you off with your Dick and you deserve it. Madec glad you stayed ban on and layer on. There you go. There was a little Illuminati with a Lionel Richie and he'd like that.

Speaker 1:          00:01:33       Um, somebody sent me this fucking video. They go, hey, you might want to, you might want to watch this thing. And it was basically this person was talking about, uh, we showing how the automobile put the horse out of business, you know, which it was so funny to me. Like the Horse was upset like, Oh fuck you mean human beings and our nature aren't going to ride on my back anymore guy what I want now what do I gotta do? I can't run free on the planes. Um, I guess the horse population dropped off, but like nobody who is no one, you know, most of them are born into a, I guess you really don't see horses running around do you can be out in Wyoming. Yeah. See a lot of cows at the waffle house. I'm sorry. Well why would you do a fat joke bill this early and come on, you're better than that bell.

Speaker 1:          00:02:17       Hang on a second. We come off a certain standard of comedy. You got to go that low. Yeah. You got a tech, the broads and fat people while at the same time that early, hey, you know, whatever, you've got to shoot your way out of a slump. It's my second attempt to get to sing go. And this is one of these times I'm recording the podcast. Not because I'm feeling it, it's because I have to, cause I got shit to do tomorrow. So, uh, I got to kind of knock this thing out on Easter. So anyways, anybody, if somebody shows me this fucking thing, so the guys shows how the car put the horse out of fucking business and uh, yeah, like I said, like, like the horse is upset. It's like when you watch those weird commercials, we're like, uh, the Mr potato heads or sneaking off to eat potato chips.

Speaker 1:          00:03:03       There's some sort of weird like undertones of cannibalism going on there and it's supposed to be adorable. I don't, I don't get those commercials on any level. Um, but uh, totally lost my train of thought. Oh yeah. So they were basically showing how computers and everything being automated is going to phase everybody out and there's going to be this mass unemployment that is coming. I'm like, this is fucking groundbreaking thought. I mean, a dummy like me has been saying this for fucking ever. Right. And he just kept going like, oh, see are in this industry. Well, you're not safe either. You think you know, you actually, you're a computer programmer. Well guess what? You're not safe either, buddy. Just fucking relax. And like he just kept coming with that tone. And at some point I was just like, what are you going to fucking shine that light on yourself that maybe it does by the end?

Speaker 1:          00:03:55       I couldn't listen to them. What about condescending? Douchebags who think they know everything? Narrating over these fucking videos, you know, with the big dude I'd called. It really is technology in the future are going to get rid of jobs. Yeah. I had no idea. It's only been doing that since the beginning of fucking time. And these fucking people are just forever forecasting that the sky is going to fall. This is the fucking thing. Eventually the sky will fall. Nobody knows when it's going to happen. Everybody's been trying to predict it ever since that fucking Nostradamus Douche bag all the way down to a moron like me. And the bottom line is none of us know what we're talking about. Oh, the lovely mia. I'm busting that on your podcasts. We'll get a microphone in a, in a plug there in the, uh, they in the closet until the bottom line is nobody knows when all this shit's going to end.

Speaker 1:          00:04:44       So just fucking go enjoy yourself. You know, I just feel like there's fucking, all this whole presidential election you get, you got one loan, it's in the closets on the closet, a top shelf. You got one Luna tick on the fucking left, another lunatic on the right. And then you got this fucking, I dunno what she is in the middle, you know, she's not really in the middle. She's just more of the same, you know they're going to be, they should just wheel her into the White House. Like fucking Hannibal Lecter. When I was in fucking mass zone, you just went out to watch her awful fucking mouth. You need the plug too. Oh I got the plug over here. Let me hit pause so the listeners don't have to fucking listen to this shit. And with that, the magic of the pause button, we were able to get by all that. Don't you wish she had a pause button in life? Nia? I certainly do. When all of a sudden something bad was going on. Like you know, I was in the middle of one of my long drawn out stories. You could. Well, I actually want to fast forward when you,

Speaker 2:          00:05:40       I felt that your listeners might need rescuing from that, from those that what it is. You just bring it down. Bring into the mic here. Yeah. Don't do that. Just have it. Just hold it down a little more relaxed. You know, like you sitting there with a drink in your hand. You're always telling me how to use the microphone. Yeah, because you don't,

Speaker 1:          00:05:58       all right, well fucking use how you want to use it. Then

Speaker 2:          00:06:02       I got my own style, man. Yeah, you do.

Speaker 1:          00:06:05       Yeah, you don't, you sound, sometimes you sound like you don't want to. A little kid answers the phone. You just pick up the phone, you know? It's like,

Speaker 3:          00:06:12       hello

Speaker 1:          00:06:14       and you're like, Hey, what'd you do today? Do you have a good day?

Speaker 3:          00:06:18       Yes.

Speaker 1:          00:06:22       That's the hardest thing ever. I just was talking to my niece and it's just like you gotta like you can't, if you just ask them yes or no questions, you gotta be like, what did you do today? You can't be like, did you have fun today? Because they want elaborate there. Just go, yes.

Speaker 2:          00:06:38       You're like, oh fuck, I need another question. Yeah. They're not the greatest conversationalist, but oh they're, they're brutal interview, brutal interview. So they just always that white child actors are so creepy, you know, like little kid. Cause it's like you shouldn't be able, you shouldn't be this articulate. You shouldn't be able to just like elaborate in a way because you're a kid. Yeah. Right. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:07:02       No, it's, it's the combination that they talk like adults, they're making more money than you are. Right. And they're wearing that little talk show suit, the whole thing. And they just peel and they just sit there and they cross their legs like an adult does when they do panel and they'll just be like, you know, so what was it like working on blah, blah, blah. And He'd be like, oh he was great to work with. I've, I've, I've been a huge fan of his stuff. Like, yeah, for the last six years, my whole life basically, I don't think they should make little kids do interviews. I feel like that's, I think it's one thing for them to do movies and stuff. But I don't think they should be doing interviews and press and stuff. I just feel like that's weird. I don't think people should talk the little kids period. Like no, like you seen like little kids. I don't talk to little kids, like little kids. Yeah, neither do I. And I think that that is a like, I think it weirds them out after the age of four to be like, yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:07:50       Oh, okay.

Speaker 1:          00:07:53       When they're just talking to you like, yeah, you don't like, do you remember her being a member in young Frankenstein when he just goes like, yeah,

Speaker 2:          00:08:01       tis alive. I've never seen it.

Speaker 1:          00:08:05       Frankenstein sitting. They look looking at him like, dude, what the fuck is your deal? No. Gene Wilder. Oh No, he never saw that movie. No. Walk this way. You haven't touched your food.

Speaker 2:          00:08:17       Are you quoting the movie area saying words? You're quoting the movie and to have a tough cookie? No. No. Like uh, yeah. How have you never seen that when we was fucking hilarious out. The one where he's always going Frankenstein. Yeah, Broncos. Remember those clips, but I don't, wasn't there something cool? He's young. Frankenstein with Yahoo serious, that comedian and process really movie. Well God knows I always fuck up the name. It's the one with gene wilder in it. I think you're right that that's the name of a gene wilder movie. But wasn't there something with Frankenstein with Yahoo Serious am I? I Dunno. I don't know why there's like a wind

Speaker 1:          00:08:56       tunnel where you're, where you're talking you, you know what it is. Does it sound bad? No. Cause this is what you do. You're up here and then you're down here and then you're here. You're moving it all around. So what do I do? You need a steady hand on that microphone. You don't move your hand at all. Ah, I'm, I'm pretty consistent. I just, I rest it like this. I rested against my chest, my chest tickles my mail, my mail pecks him, my testicles. Does it sound far away though if I do this? Yeah, it does. How about this? That's fine. This is good. That is good. All right. That's right. Then I just don't move and freeze for the next 15 minutes. Well, I'm probably gonna leave soon. I just came in and say hi. Oh, okay. Well, I didn't know if you had any questions from all that hasn't come in yet.

Speaker 1:          00:09:36       Oh, so where are you going on about Frankenstein? No, I was talking about the Illumina, this fucking video somebody told me to watch was just like, this guy is just saying how technology and robots are going to phase everybody out and you just go, you know, Oh, you're a milk man. You think you're safe. Check out this fucking robot and everything. It's just like, yeah. Well what about condescending douchebags who narrate videos? Like they probably already have a robot to do that, right? Don't they? To do what? I'll tell you this to just narrate shit. They already have the fucking robot lady in the elevator or even that's just a voiceover that in so many countries only please make a poster. It's like a horror film. And what did he say? That weird robot lady in the elevator. I want to fucking robot lady in the elevator.

Speaker 1:          00:10:23       He didn't do a poster for a movie with your face looking very concerned and there's like an elevator she used to pressing. She's in like every fucking elevator and it's like going up. And then when she says going down, she goes going down and she really like, like your whole life is going in the shitter. And I can't tell you how many people I've been in the elevator. I go, I, it's so fucking depressing. They're like, I know I hate it. It's not just me. Okay. You know, it's all of us out there in the remodel, you know, hoping they got that little waffle flippy thing down there for the continental breakfast. It was stale blueberry muffins. Those little bite size ones that for some reason give, give you a, what do they call this? Your little muffin toughened tops. Those things are like little grenades for your gut. Feel your belly. You know, you just pop one of those in there and you come like, like homer Simpson. Yup. Oh, you're going to do this. All right, let's get into the, well, let's get into this part of it. Oh, I thought you were giving me shit. Yup. It's still on that shit.

Speaker 1:          00:11:24       Let's talk about uh, your, your little trashing that you'd say you took like a seller level, comedy cellar level trashing. Today we were out to Brunch and mother in law, brother in law, my sister in law and you and me and we go out, we go out to a lunch and you are the biggest sweetheart. You got to your wonderful sense of humor. You're a cutie pie. But when you talk to the wait staff or just in

Speaker 2:          00:11:53       general, I still don't see it. Oh in everybody. That was an agreement. You have, you put a little mustard on it. You have like a can you get your shit together or what? Like how many times do I have to ask you the first time, like when the lady came over and she goes, what did she ask you? And I were sitting down while that is six top while my mom and my brother were outside waiting for my sister. So we went to get our table and she said, hi, can I get you guys into the drink? And we both said waters and she goes, okay, and can I get you some appetizers? And I said, we're just, we're waiting on three more. That's all I said. But you make it seem like, um, excuse me. You had this tone of like, bitch, why would two people sit at a six top? There's obviously more people coming. You had a little fucking, and there are menus and then we'll menus that see Derek and the menus and it was totally, that's what it was. The fact that there was menus there and she didn't do the math. You just have this, well what the fuck's wrong with you?

Speaker 2:          00:12:59       But I don't think that I'm a difficult person to serve in a restaurant. What'd you say that I know what the way don't you do it the way that you do it. It's, it's one of those fucking zingers. It's a tone. So the person that you said something nice, but there's a tone in there that makes the person a step and a half away kind of cock their head like, well she just being a fucking asshole there. Am I like you are accusing me of being shady is basically what it was and that's not my intention. I just, you do. You do know though I not shady. Shady is like dishonest. You're saying that that shady as in I'm being shady the way it throwing shade. Are you going down, drilling down? Um, I, I just have, I definitely have a little less patients than normal perhaps at a restaurant.

Speaker 2:          00:13:51       This is good. You're gradually, they do feel that. Um, I don't like it when they're not on top of things. That's all. And I mean it wasn't just for me, like my mom got her salad before she got her wine and the woman, the bus got drinks and like, you know, me and my brother and my sister all had mixed drinks. She had wine like hers should have been the first thing that came out. And then we all get our stuff and then she gets a salad with no wine and I said to her, and she has a wine to the ones you brought over. My Mom's fat salad. I just said that she has one. I wasn't like my mom ordered wine and she should've gotten that first. I don't do all that. No, you don't go to that level. Yeah. So what's the problem?

Speaker 2:          00:14:31       You have a fucking tone. I can't do it the way that you fucking do it. I just, I always look at you go easy. Nia. Just fucking take a little off the fast ball there. You just have this fucking do your brother agreed. You sister agreed when she pleaded the fifth and he goes, I'm not going to get involved in this cause she does the same thing. To be honest, I'm not trying to throw them on. That's what you want. That's what your brother said. What brother goes when your mother would tell I said that's where she gets it from. Well I mean my mom definitely has been known to complain about food. She bitched about the food in Italy. The funniest thing ever keeps saying, I guess I'm just used to a sandwich that has meat on it. More meat, more meat on it.

Speaker 2:          00:15:17       No, I mean I think, yes. How hard did we tease her for complaining about the food? A lot, but then then good sport about it. But um, no, I mean my mom has a tendency to be late. Just to the point with people like that, because you know, just letting them know, listen, this was the Sunday waitstaff, this was the Easter Sunday weights that, like I said, you're not getting, you're not getting the Crigila wait stab on Easter Sunday. Like let's be real. Wow. You're just, you're going in there with that attitude now this is all this type of fucking predispose thought and tone that guys like me, guys like me and offend somebody because somebody did it shift at it. No, no, no, no. I'm saying on Easter Sunday you have, you're going to say that I'm saying that they're not the creme de la creme, but if you had been in this restaurant, okay, so I'm not talking about you.

Speaker 2:          00:16:04       If you had vantage restaurant, you would have seen just how it was a little off. That's all. And I wasn't like throwing a temper tantrum or being demanding. Here you have a mandate. You have this fucking attitude every fucking place we go. When you order, you have, I'm always like easy, easy, all you're gonna do. Just pump the brakes a little. I just feel like they asked me what I want and I just tell them what I want and what I need and I'm, the thing is, when you order, I think you're fine. But then it's when, when everything isn't chomp, chomp coming your way, you have a way of like, can we get some more bread? Like please, like you have this, I can't, I'm, that's my page. So you're fucking agreeing with me. I agree that I have a low patience for service that is not the quality that I feel that, yeah, well his is that, yes.

Speaker 2:          00:17:10       Sound crazy. I know. And if they fuck with your food, they're going to fuck with my food too. So it's just fucking, the wait staff has an unbelievable amount of power that you're not really realizing to fuck with your life. I realized that I was a waitress. Remember, I understand how it all goes down. I just say, what happened to you at that job? You got fired and here you are. Oh yeah, I got fired over some bullshit and they could never even tell him why I got fired. Okay. They were like, oh, you told somebody that they couldn't have ice coffee. And I said, Oh, you told me that we don't serve ice tea anymore because it's the fall. And they're like, oh, but you still can have ice coffee. And I'm like, oh, I didn't fucking know that. And that was an example of one of the reasons why they fired me. Bullshit. It was over some bullshit

Speaker 1:          00:18:08       little mustard getting slung around in that place. You don't, you probably have the same fucking attitude, the same lack of patience with the people ordering those fucking bar flies. Actually no, he did a great show. That was one of my favorite times when I was first getting that this place doesn't exist anymore. The all state cafe on the west side in New York and she used to work the lunchtime shift and I would come in as a fucking, you know, no name Magoo comedian. Right. So on my days of free, my phone's not ringing. You come in every day that I was working with. So cute. You come in with the New York Post, you come in with the paper, I loved it. And you'd sit in the same booth and you get a burger. Oh Shit. And I would sell, Rosa would come by to, Rosen would come down.

Speaker 1:          00:18:50       You looked adorable. You looked at during people love to the people that you got. You got the chef there. I wish I just brought that up there cause I had friends there. But restaurants are just, they're weird environments. Anyway. That's the only place you ever got fired from. And I remember how far you took that cause everybody sells. You've just gotten promoted, promoted, promoted. That's the only place. Yeah, you cried. So I think maybe that's why you have that fucking attitude when you go in there because it brings you back. Oh, that's ridiculous. Well then I didn't know if maybe you're just not nice

Speaker 2:          00:19:21       person. Now I get impatient at restaurants. I will cop to that. Okay, fine. I cops are being impatient at restaurants.

Speaker 1:          00:19:31       Well do you remember when you were awake? Waiter or waitress and people were like impatient with you. How did that make you feel?

Speaker 2:          00:19:37       It didn't make me feel good. Okay. So the next time we go out, do you think maybe I'll just let you order from me. How about that and make an all nights at school and traditional just like you like that. Well yeah, I liked it when there was defined jobs. Define gender roles you mean? Yeah, absolutely. Well I'll let you, it made it made a shrew to deal with when you take me out to eat it made it a lot easier. And what do you mean the questions just came in by the way? One of them them's skin infections.

Speaker 2:          00:20:15       What am I talk to somebody I'm wrote you about? They got, they were getting married or they're engaged in their fiance wanted to have a little mermaid theme wedding. Did you have this question? Yeah, cause I got sent it to Andrew. Send it to me too. Um, it's a comment. I'm an, obviously I'm late, but I just, first of all, I just don't think that's a real fucking question. Are you okay? Good. I didn't think it was real, but I was like, if this is real person would really like no 28 year old woman wants, have their fiance dress up as who was it supposed to be? Neptune.

Speaker 1:          00:20:53       Um, you know,

Speaker 2:          00:20:54       because that doesn't make any buttons sense because June is her father would, would, would be, uh, the Little Mermaid's father.

Speaker 1:          00:21:01       Yeah. I, it just seemed like it would be addressed

Speaker 2:          00:21:03       stop as Prince Eric and the fact that you didn't know that just proves that you lied because a girl who's really into little mermaid like I am, would know that those are the facts.

Speaker 1:          00:21:13       Well, maybe they're just talking about, okay, here we go. Bazaar 13, most bizarre and unusual wedding themes. All right, here we go. Look, these people are dressed up like fucking monsters. All right. Look at these other both dress zombies. Yeah. No, this isn't really, this isn't good for the podcast is people can't see what we're talking about it. Yeah. Well we can comment on it. I can you have a little faith in me. Jesus. Stop treating me like a waiter.

Speaker 2:          00:21:37       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:21:41       Having your wedding edit at a department store. These people got married at Tj Maxx. Alright, no comment. No comment. Oh, okay. Your entire party can be superheroes. All right, so here, this is getting towards a little Neptune or whatever the fuck it was. Couple of the Little Mermaid, little mermaid. Okay, so one was dressed like wonder woman. The other one is dressed like Batman. How out of shape is the Batman? It's a loose fitting. Fucking Batman suit. He looks horrible. That's some shit that you regret later. He looks like old Batman. Like we know when your skin loses the els. This city Super Mario Brothers can smash it up at your weddings. That's a wedding cake or Super Mario brothers wedding. Just show up naked. Okay. Now is this scene, is this seeming a,

Speaker 3:          00:22:31       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:22:31       Wow. What a bunch of fucking Weirdos. A roller coaster of a wedding. People get married on a rollercoaster. Yeah, I could see that. Jump off a bridge while you say I. Do you get the metaphor in? Yes. Is it hitting you over the head with the at? Yes.

Speaker 1:          00:22:48       Uh, make it so somebody has in their wedding ring to boldly go where no man has gone before you. This is, this is the seeing the theme here. This is Shrek wedding. Oh really? Well, anyway, I, I thought the question said that the dad thrown into a shark cage was not the dad, but like the, the groom was supposed to be dressed like Neptune and that just would not make sense unless he was just all this comic con shit. All these fucking nerds try to find middle earth for the wedding of your dreams. Rocky horror picture show and a Zombie wedding.

Speaker 1:          00:23:25       I mean, it's just people out there that think that, that shit's cool. I still thought it was a bogus question. I have. I don't fucking know. Hey, what do I know? Okay. Um, I was going to tell the story of seeing the old guy fall off the scooter and I hope you saw it, right. Jesus Christ and you helped him. Now what was I supposed to do? The first person there, it's silly bird of the rescue fucking guy rolling down the street, slide on his face. Pork. He wasn't phy Ed raspberries. He knocked himself out. He came around, he was spitting up, he was pulling out little bits of teeth. And I dunno why, it was horrifying when I saw it, but now I can't talk about it without laughing cause he was on a scooter. I had basically I was, I'm on, I'm not going to say all the information cause God forbid the people that are related to them and listening.

Speaker 1:          00:24:17       So the fucking dude was like, uh, I fuck it. I'll just tell the story. I didn't do anything. I just finished flying. Explain his fucking tragic. Why don't we know is all right. Just done, finished flying. Right, which everybody says is so fucking unsafe. Right. Fly around and look all this cool shit. Flyovers Silver Lake to see that they took the water out of it. I even realize that. And I came back, I fucking land, you know, say goodbye to everybody and I'm driving out, you know, to the real scary thing. Driving down the fucking street. And I literally pull out, I make a right turn and I don't, I don't drive more than 40 yards. And I just see this fucking guy, just this old guy takes the turn to come onto the, on the little two lane highway. Then I'm on, he's on the opposite side of the road and he liked, he went too fast and I'm like a motorcycle. You can't just turn the front wheel. You're going to go down on a scooter. You know what I mean? You've got to kind of look your way through the turn in lean and your momentum momentum. You know he's supposed to look through the fucking turn. He, he was going too fast and he went into the, the fucking island in the middle of that.

Speaker 4:          00:25:27       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:25:28       He fucking, he jumped the fucking curb. The whole fucking scooter went up in the back. You high sided, right? He just gets launched off this bucket thing and he's rolling down the street like a fucking log. Why are you laughing so hard? Because people falling down. It's fucking hilarious. He was fine. He didn't break anything. He just knocked himself out. He's Lucas and then he wasn't wearing a shield and in the end he was sliding on his face. So I'm going, Oh shit. Oh Shit. Oh Shit is, I'm watching it and I fucking pull over. No, I made sure everybody stopped and I got out. I was like, dude, do it right. Just stay there. You're alright. You're alright. And um, and he was, he wasn't saying anything and he, his fucking raspberry on his face, his pants with torn up, you know, you got fucking attacked by a wild animal and he's fucking late.

Speaker 1:          00:26:20       I feel terrible that this happened to them, but it's just afterwards, this is funny. And he was laying there right in like one of his legs. He had like, oh, like he was chilling and the island was just straight out like that is, and he was like going around and I was like, all right man. I called nine one, you find you're fine. And then this lady shows up and she just kept going, don't move. Don't move. Okay. You're okay. Just don't move. Okay. You just have to keep going. Okay. And it started annoying me and I almost started laughing like, I want to be like, lady, like the way you're talking is probably worse than what the fuck is failing right now. So, uh, by then you were like five or six people at stopped. Everybody called to this ambulance shows up and like, okay, thank God, and he, and now he wants to get up.

Speaker 1:          00:27:01       And we just kept telling him not to get up. And, um, the ambulance pulls up and he just goes, uh, he goes, is he all right? Is he all right? You're like, yeah, yeah, he seems to be okay. You know, we're not fucking doctors, but he seems to be okay. And he goes, all right, just tell him not to move. I already have someone on this ambulance, there's another one coming, and then he gets in and drives away and then we're looking down the street. We don't see any ambulance come and we're like, what the fuck? And um, finally one at a, a cop finally came up and this guy was fucking priceless. He gets out right? Fucking horse. You Bald Guy, right? He's got the whole land in strip. He just comes out looking like Sargent Riker from the rookies for anybody's old, and he fucking just comes walking. He looked, the guy from d Bluth, the old guy showed his ass with the mustache minus the mustache. She just comes walking up and he just walks right up to the guy, Dennis Franz. Yeah. He just walks up like his toes are almost touching the guy's body and he just looks down at Amigos. You're all right.

Speaker 1:          00:28:04       And the guy at that point, it's going like, yeah, yeah, I'm fine. And he goes, hi. Know Daniel's going to be kind of like, he just, his level of just like, I don't know, he must be like, people would be on fire every day. So this guy, he just sees a scooter and this guy fucked up. He's just like, yeah, yeah. All right. He also seemed way too old to still be in a patrol car, so I think he fucked up somehow and got busted down. Or maybe he was on his way to some a senior police fucking banquet or some shit. And he's just like, I'm driving a cruiser. They know I'm a cop. I have to stop. So once that was fine, it was funny, they were just standing there waiting for the ambulance. But you know, we got to get on with that day and uh, me and there was this tall, older black dude standing there, this, he's just like, he's that guy, man, the here.

Speaker 1:          00:28:47       And I was like, yeah, yeah, the here and we just like, we both got in a car and fucking drove away. And uh, it was really, you know, it wasn't too bad. I mean, it wasn't too glorious scene. It was just a couple of raspberries and stuff. I didn't have a, but it was, oh yeah, absolutely. But it wasn't until I got on the highway and I started driving and I started thinking about it and I just started laughing. I think it was just more of a surprise that you saw it, but there is just something, just watching somebody get fucked up like that. I remember the time I was in Griffith Park and that dude came down the hill in street clothes on a skateboard. He went down that fucking, are you serious dude? This kid will you hike up to the observatory? Somebody was going down a skateboard.

Speaker 1:          00:29:30       Yeah. So I was just north of where the Greek theater was and this guy just went flying by in this thing and I was just like, oh my God, that guy is the shit like, and I'm thinking like, well how's he going to stop? Cause this is just downhill to you getting the traffic and all of a sudden his legs started doing that. What are [inaudible] wobbly fucking thing. And I'm like no fucking way and I'm telling you this guy was going like 30 miles an hour. Then he just steps off the skateboard. You always do that either one or two steps and then you're done. He was going so fast, he did like one step and it was like, who's that guy who fucking jump 30 feet in 1969 nobody ever broken he fucking head first client. It was like the greatest study of his sight. He learned it too and he started rolling with me. When I tell you this guy, this guy was rolling so fast, he was like a blurry. He's like, he would go like you hit like his elbow, which would shoot them in the area

Speaker 1:          00:30:28       and then the best is when you're not going fast enough to keep rolling and then you just slide in the sand like all the way down the thing and I'll let you escape and kept going. And he just, he was just not moving and I was going like, oh my God. And he was so he started wiping out like 50 yards away from me and I swear to God was a quarter mile walk to get where the fuck he stopped. And he was just laying in the road dump moving and like I was like, I think he had, he had no helmet. No, he had street clothes on. He looked like he just came back from drinking and he just, he had like this Harrison Ford, like Brown leather chair. He just fucking launched himself. So I get up. So I, I'm getting close to it at this point is trying to set up, he knows he's laying in the middle of the road and I finally see his skateboard hit the curb on the other side when pops into a parked car and then he like, like crawled.

Speaker 1:          00:31:28       He tried to stand up and he couldn't put any weight on that like, and he crawled, he crawled over and sat down and by then I knew it was all right. So it was already starting to laugh. So it's just going like Tony doing that dude while laughing. I got you. All right. He goes, he's like, yeah bro. Fuck. I was, and at that point I'm trying not to laugh. I was just like, dude, I go, that was fucking, I was fucking hardcore man. I never seen a wipe out like that. If I wasn't filming that fucking thing, dude, it was the most fucking, it was the greatest log roll, whatever the fuck you call that thing that do. It's just,

Speaker 1:          00:32:11       I never seen him either. I can't believe these shoes stayed on. Like, you know, your shoes always fly off whenever you get hit real hard. Oh my God. Tremendous. Fucking tremendous. And it's just as much as you feel for the person that's just nothing funnier than watching somebody fucking wipe out if they don't die and you don't know him. Right. God, God, help me, man. Anyway, so let me do a little podcast reading for some, uh, for some of the advertising. Oh, it's advertising. It's advertising. You do the questions afterward. Yeah, I can get right to those things if you know. I just don't want you to start talking to me in a certain way. I was going to ask you what you wanted for dinner. I'm starting to get hungry again. Um, some were moldy. Oh, here we go. Oh. The advertising would help me read some advertising yet God knows I can't read out loud. They don't want me to read it. Well, I can't read this again. And she had the whole fucking, am I supposed to read the whole menu? I'm not doing this shit. All right. What's it? Look at it before you do the black? Yes, baby. Yeah. I didn't get into this business to have a job.

Speaker 1:          00:33:14       Blue Apron, everybody. All right. You need to know how to cook. Um, not only do you feel like you know your way around the kitchen, honey, but cooking at home means eating healthier and saving money instead of ordering expensive takeout again, but where do you start? It sounds like an almost old school infomercials. Somebody like looking at all the pans and it looks at the camera and shakes their head. Look, I don't know where to start. Turn on a burner. You're fucking checker. Blue Apron, blue apron. As you covet for less than 10 bucks per meal, blue apron delivers all the fresh ingredients you need to create home cooked meals. Just follow the easy step by step instructions. This is actually a cool thing. This is, I would definitely try that. Can blue aprons and that's some stuff? No. Oh, okay. Neil. We got too much shit.

Speaker 1:          00:34:01       I'm trying to get rid of shit. I don't need a bunch of way friends hanging around. They said you food in a recipe card. I haven't even finished this. That's what blue apron is. What are you talking about? How do I know what this is? You're doing? The average has any, you don't know what Blue Apron is. They send you the ingredients and then the rest they send you the exact amount you need so you don't buy it too much or too little. Well then they should call it blue recipes, shouldn't they? Maybe you do want me to read it. Each meal can be prepared and I'm just saying if I was young, right, and I was, you know, dating or anything, this is a great way. Hey, let's stay in tonight. Well, we're a little blue apron. We can do that. Each meal can be prepared in 40 minutes or less. No overwhelming trips to the grocery store.

Speaker 1:          00:34:43       No more sad takeout. Oh, look at the noodles. No matter how I love that, they just have to shit on everything else. It's convenient. Why do you have to take grocery stores down no matter your dietary preferences? Blue Blue Apron makes it a breeze to discover and prepare dishes like I am not reading all of these fucking things. At least read three. Let's, we'll do like a little like a Donny and Marie here. I'll read the first one. Chicken Fried Chicken. With what? And you've not heard of chicken fried chicken. You wrote chicken fried steak, chicken fried chicken with big sweet potato when Quick Collard Greens. Oh look at him. Go Shrimp Po boy sandwiches with Tribeca bread. Locked in. The fuck is striped backup bread. Maybe we should go to blue apron. Dot. Steak and egg number for ourselves. Steak and eggs with Kimchi fried rice. That sounds good. I love Kimchi.

Speaker 1:          00:35:43       Spice Catfish with pious direct style rice and creamy saffron AOE. Ooh, I used to be my stripper name. Seared pork with sprinkler such an old jokes. Dot. Dot. Turn off the computer. Not C'mon, c'mon. I like Yo here. Uh, radishes and sugar. Snap peas. Hash with ranch yogurt. I haven't heard of it after the shit. One word. Oh, radishes and sugar. Snap Peas Hash with, I know, I guess. Yeah, it has to do with ranch yoga. I speak the language. That sounds great. In your own kitchen. Cook with ingredients that you've never used before. Like watermelon, radishes, Pharaoh, Pharaoh, Pharaoh, Pharaoh. And purple potatoes, ab clicks with purple potatoes. Oh, we used to go to the farmer's market every Sunday and it was all dirty people walking around. What dirty people are just, you know, he's talking about the vendors and all the lefties you'd recommend like the Hippie Carmela's guys, all the man buns, the fucking hair fallen into the fucking Kim.

Speaker 1:          00:36:47       She kind of plays into the way you could definitely buy weed there as no, I actually, I don't mind the farmer's market, but I hate how you have to get there. I just hate that. I know you gotta get there early. He got to get there early. It's like, do I, let me just go down the street and I'll just get the poison oh and recipes between 500 to 700 calories proportion. Delicious and good for you right now. You can get your first two meals for free. You get blue apron.com/bird. That's blue apron.com/bird blue apron. A better way to cook. Actually, I like farmer's market because if they actually are local farmers, I like to, uh, support them. But I know the corporate food has worked its way in there. You know, they just take off corporate potatoes and they just write, hey man, potatoes.

Speaker 1:          00:37:27       And then it, it's like me by him thinking I'm sticking it to the man. Hey man, potatoes only two this week. Can you believe it? Great. I read these things. Helux a great group. Uh, right now it's not helix helix. Was that the name of the group? I don't know. Gimme it. Oh, oh, see, see what are you talking about? What you want to do rob do rocky, you don't remember that song now? It was like a, I dunno what it was. It was one of the most bizarre things. And there was some reason they would dress like fucking cavemen. That sounds like an eighties thing. Oh, absolutely. It was an eighties thing. Oh, well you know how old I was in the 80s like I would, I, I don't remember sermons. Yeah. But you know, other things was, speaking of robots taking over everywhere, how can you have a can make a robot do what James Brown did? You can't you kit. You know what? But there's some fucking nerd trying to insert oppression in pain into a robot to see if they can give it a little bit of soul.

Okay. And today we have, we want our first one PB Toronto, thank Gosh in breweries.

And then uh, of course as always Berge run and shower fucking step up, you know, for the, uh, I guess the tying goal and then the ahead goal and what's his face Boleski get the fucking empty net or I missed the whole game because we were at Brunch and I was sitting there watching you looking absolutely gorgeous. Treating the wait staff. Is that why you didn't want to go to that? No, I didn't. I didn't know. I didn't want to go cause I thought your mom wanted to go to someplace where everyone was going to go and everyone was going to show up with their Easter hats and I was gonna be standing out in the sun.

Speaker 1:          00:44:53       It's going to be a 45 minute wait. If you guys want to go down the street and get some drinks and then maybe come back, we'll give you this vibrating square. Yeah. And I don't want to do that. Not to be that. No, it ended up being great. Ended up being great. Oh by the way, I haven't even talked about it. And the, I played the terrorist's data last night and long beach is the place where a Richard Pryor did the greatest standup special of all time. I want to thank everyone who came out. I had such a great time, but for the first 10 minutes I was literally freaking out going like that's where he told the white guy, you know, sit your ass down. You know, this is where he did. My monkeys died. And I remember in the end when I waved, good night, I remember how he finished to set doing the woman having the orgasm and the whole place goes nuts and eating enough to say goodnight.

Speaker 1:          00:45:38       He just waved. Ah. I started to watch the special, I had to stop watching it because I knew it would fuck up my set but like it is, if it is the definition of a comic who's just in a zone, he walks out from the beginning to end. It gives me like fucking goosebumps when I watched that special to this day he is the greatest, it's not even fucking close and I got to basically stand and do stand up there and I just can't believe I watched that special since I was a kid. And you walk in and it looks the exact same way you drive in his where he drove him with his wife when they filmed the special and it all still looks the same and as I was walking in I was getting like the chills and you just walk in and it's like there it is.

Speaker 1:          00:46:21       This is, this is it, this is the place and it, and at the end of the show, when I said goodnight, Dean del Ray came out and out, showed me in the spotlight, went on him so it wasn't on me. And so it wasn't in my eyes anymore. I could just see the spotlight hitting the tops of everybody's heads. And that's the way I saw the theater, you know, cause they didn't really show the crowd in that special. And, um, it was just one of the coolest things ever. And then the night before I worked at theater in Riverside, California that they actually debuted, gone with the wind. The first, you know, before they had the official premiere, it Mann's Chinese theater, they wanted to make sure the sound was our rights. So they just headed east and they, uh, they shot at, I don't know, they fucking, whatever.

Speaker 1:          00:47:01       They played the movie out there and I got to stand on those stages. It was fucking tremendous. And I want to thank everybody who came out. Um, it was fucking amazing. It's fucking amazing. Yeah. Um, and lastly before we get into the questions is the, uh, the Lincoln Continental. All right. I talked about this, you know, this guy who drove us, we got a driver to take us down to long beach because I knew it was going to have a couple of whiskeys after that. You know, I was trying to be responsible. So, um, you know, I, I was sitting there going like, you know, I like to Lincoln Continental. I hope they don't fuck it up. I hope they make it fuck with the Mercedes Benz. You know, like those really make this a nice car. Like fuck. With the seven series BMW, I went to seem to be a nice fucking car and I was saying, you'll be cool if they actually brought back the suicide doors and the driver was going, yeah, they're doing that.

Speaker 1:          00:47:50       The top of the line is going to have suicide doors. And I went and I looked it up and here's a picture of it. How sick is that fucking car? That's very cool. Um, where I'm going to post this picture and it's just the concept car. And as far as I know, they didn't fucking do it. Why wouldn't you do that? Look at that. The how fucking food. That is the sickest fucking shit ever. Yeah. Look at that car. Yeah, I see. No, it's cool. I'm looking at, hopefully you guys had just you looking at the picture right now. They even had like the trunk comes up and slides forward and then the bottom kicks out and they should fucking luggage. You can see it in real life. They can. We know. What you have to do is you have to buy the car and then you've got to take it to one of these wizards out here and say you see that?

Speaker 1:          00:48:37       I want you to do that. One of those gas monkey guys. Tell him to fucking do that to the car. Wait, what's this one though? I saw on the bottom this, this is a Lincoln. Yeah. This is what the led lights and in this one, the led lights like the, the Lincoln continental, their emblem also lights up in led lights as fucking sick. That's nice to them. 17 Lincoln continental to replace 2016 Lincoln Mkx. Yeah. I'm either going to get that. I'm going to get that Dodge Ram, r t s sport, like just a two door, no extra cab, none of that. I just, I'm, I'm such a Ford Guy, but I just fucking love the way the dodge Ram Hemi truck looks. One of the other one or the other. But I'm going to get some, I'll probably get the old man car. That's me. Right? You're definitely an old man. I am. God Damn it. I thought it was cool. I guess I'm not. All right, so here we go. Unless they fucked the car up and then I'll be right back to square one. Um, look at this fucking guy.

You don't think he is. I enjoy a couple of his songs, but I wouldn't go that far. He didn't see the fucking video where they had the things in that Ida look cooler shit. They did that in the fucking, the opening to that movie belly. This is not like a new concept. Look, everything's been done. You could do that to my Yak. Hawaii being, yeah, he's treating everybody like a fucking way to this week. I'm trying to give somebody a shout out who got plucked out of a record deal. You know what I mean? It's true.

Oh, the question everybody has not been waiting for. All right, dear bill, I was hanging out with this girl and I think she gave me a quote. Skin infection. Oh No, I haven't been with anybody else. I confronted her about it and she said she didn't have any symptoms. I am 100% sure I haven't been with anyone else and I contracted it from her. She's acting like nothing happened. And I didn't say I got it from her, but it's still kind of weird. Should I take my chances and get back with her or move on? What kind of skin infection do you have?

Speaker 2:          00:52:20       Means Std. He's just trying. I know. Okay. Um, I was hanging out with this girl. I mean if you were, if that was the only person that you had slept with and like the last six months and you didn't use protection and uh, I mean as long as you told her just get treated and I mean that's up to you if you want to keep banging this girl or not, but don't keep being in this girl. Yeah, I'm probably not. Especially if she, I mean, because the thing is she could at least be like, all right, well let me go get tested just in case. Yeah. And then you could both be tested for everything and get treated for everything and that's all good. Yeah. Going, I go your separate ways. This is how this thing starts off. Yeah, it's not good. He obviously likes bagging her, otherwise he wouldn't be asking this question and might not be too many prospects on the horizon. If this is what it's come down to.

Speaker 1:          00:53:13       I'll go the obvious one. She's really good at fucking, but she's done it a lot. A lot of people maybe, maybe, well, maybe she got on well, I mean she got unlucky. Maybe she just had the gift. I don't fucking know. Jeez.

Speaker 2:          00:53:26       Well I hope whatever you got is hero section. Go to the doctor. It gets treated. Use Protection. Like don't be an idiot. Stop raw dogging out here. Okay. New Girls. No new car. Sorry. New Car. That was like a Freudian slip. Like get a new girlfriend. Get the fuck out of that thing. Oh Man. Dude, that's brutal. Makes you happy to be married. All right. New Car. Dear Billy Blue Book. I'm in the market for a new car like yourself. I want to get something, use something with character, but my girlfriend thinks I'm holding onto the past and I'm trying to be hip in my own way. She wants me to get a Passat. What do you know how much of a creepy sell out I'd have to be to drive a facade. Thoughts? Sexy car. Why would your girl wants you to get a facade? That's some lame. I would want to see the man.

Speaker 2:          00:54:22       Mankind, not a fucking facade. This keep on top of it was that, but I also fucking drive an eight year old dented Prius. I know, but you're, I mean, I'm a frugal son about this. I think it's a little bit different. Why? Why is it different? Well, you didn't tell me to get the fucking thing. You know what is, you know what it is out there. There's so many fucking men and women out there that that will derail your fucking dreams. They, I wonder if she wants him to get a car like a facade because I feel like that's a reasonable safe car because she's trying to get you to save up for a ring or an apartment or something. Yeah. Look at that thing. That is not, oh my God. That's his solace as my car I've ever seen in my fucking life. That that is so boring. Yeah, free is at least it's like, what is that a Passat? Whatever. I was horrible and defected. Germans made that Germans usually fucking crush it. Well then I'm sure it's very efficient.

Speaker 2:          00:55:21       Leave that one alone. Um, but other than that, I'm not into it. I think the biggest thing here is what happens to a lot of people when they get into a relationship is, look, there's definitely going to be some compromises, but like when your heart's fucking racing and you want to fucking do something, or the person you're with and you can see it, like this is something they want. This is something of a passionate and something's gonna make them happy for you to try to fucking talk him out of it. Like, why would you do that? She wants him rain. That's why. And she's trying to get them not to spend, I have to spend money on an older car that needs repairs, pairs and the this and that and the other when he could be saving for it rang. I guaran fucking see it.

Speaker 2:          00:55:57       Switch to thinking. I absolutely think, well if he gets a used car, isn't that cheaper than going out and getting a new Passat? Uh, what, what is it? Um, what did he wants it? I want to get something used and then with character things I'm holding onto the past and trying to be hip of Myeloma, but does he meets wrong Kevin? A little bit of style. Asset. Car. He must plastic. The miss means you have something like that. She wants one of us get up the sun. Right? She wants him to get a nice cost. Modern. No, she uses, we're going to have a family and a house someday. Oh, car. That's what that's about. Read between the lines. Read in between the lines.

Speaker 1:          00:56:33       Oh, I thought she was the dream catcher. You know, dream catcher. Dream catcher is like, your dream is this is my dream. And then she catches it and she puts it in your pocket like a dream killer. Dream killer. Right? But you got to catch it first.

Speaker 2:          00:56:48       It's like an ant. You can't kill it much. You just decide that things are what you want them to be. That a dream catcher is really what a dream killer is, but you have to catch it. Catch it before you kill it. Okay, honey, I live in my own little world over here. Alright. Magma,

Speaker 1:          00:57:07       magma. Okay, dear bill, have you heard, have you heard about the lonesome blues? Have you heard of magma? I just saw them in la. They definitely sound like some sort of fucking metal band here. I'd never heard of them, but what the friend of mine who works in post production, the drummer is 68 and unreal. All right. I already loved this band. He plays a combination of Jazz and progressive style beats, tons of soul. The music is interesting. An operatic, oh, he invited his, he invented his own language and it's really out there. Please look some up and give you a reaction on the podcast. Well, let me fucking do it really quickly. We're running out of time here. Let's see here. What do you think? You think you're gonna like it?

Speaker 2:          00:57:51       Well, I'm curious about it. I'm surprised the dude I was, I, when I saw this crazy fucking band, Bobby Lee's Bobby Lee's brothers in it, and I went and I saw this crazy fucking bad. Like I don't, I got to the show late. I can't remember the name of the band, but they'll fucking hot. Yeah. Somebody tagged me in a picture you took with one of the band members. I had the best time

Speaker 1:          00:58:10       they had this one. Still look them up so he can give them a shout out. Okay. I the best fucking time. All I remember was there fucking they're closing song was, was that the guitar was like really likes fresh, fresh, fresh, and the guy just what's going like, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. That was, it was just so ridiculous. It was awesome and funny. And I was just going to say, you should put that on an album cover and then have all the lyrics like written out like, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Oh, there French. Oh, they are Mac, mother. Weird. Weirdest band in the world. All right. Let's, let's see what we got here.

Speaker 3:          00:58:48       Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:58:50       All right. I'm already in. I kinda like it too. I would go see that. That reminds me by about to this kind of stuff you always reminds me of. I used to go see, have you used to go see Oz noy down in the village? Mas Noise. O. Z. N. O. Y. Yeah. You still always have like, we'll Lee would be down there and Keith Carlock would sit in and just settle. He's insane drummers. Um, look at me. Look at that. Oh my God. Yeah. I love it. They all look a little long in the two. That actually

Speaker 1:          00:59:22       good. These guys are all BS. That guy, the bass player looks like the cop that walked up to the guy in the fucking scooter. Yeah. All right. Oh my God. I love these guys. I'm speeding up. Oh, what's going to happen? Hang on. Why can't leave it here? Here we go. I'll let me fast forward so you'd have to sit through. All right,

Speaker 1:          00:59:53       dude. I would just add this is the, yeah, this is when it starts getting weird. It gets all fucking night. Yeah, I'm in know what I feel like if there was, if we had our own version of the Andy Warhols factory or something like that, like a big loft space downtown when we just had a bunch of our artists friends and assorted Weirdos, we can have magma playing in the background and it just would make a lot of sense and we're cause you could drown out all those assholes that hang around with people like that. I'm not an Andy Warhol fan on on any level. Or you don't like his like persona? No, I respect the originality of it, but I also just feel like a lot of it was smoke and mirrors and it was very like that hipsters sort of sort of the original, the original of like that hipster shit.

Speaker 1:          01:00:34       Like am I going to paint a soup can and then like it's some sort of comment on capitalism and everything and it's just like, all right, but is it a really a deep comment on it because it's not moving me. I Dunno. I mean I like Andy were high like his stuff. I feel like that was a very cool time to be in New York City during that time. I feel like I would've loved to been a part of that scene, but, um, it just seemed to me like it was a bunch of nerds trying to be cool, pretending like a lot of hipsters to me. I think there were a lot of, I Ms. Smith that found each other and they created like their own little world and they became cool because of that.

Speaker 3:          01:01:12       Yeah,

Speaker 1:          01:01:12       that's what I think. All right. Because there's a bunch of like, you know what a transgendered people and just like, yeah. College and they're just automatically cool automatically. Cool. Can you just listen to what I'm saying? Like there's no asshole transgendered people.

Speaker 3:          01:01:25       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:01:26       Can I explain to you what it was the bringing together of all these different kinds of people and that was different in New York City. It was like a whole birth of interesting, like outsider perspectives and giving them like a platform and like you're a freak and you're cool. No, no, I absolutely think so. Then like though the, uh, what is wrong? Why can't, why if I have a different opinion, you gotta fucking get upset. No, it's not that you have a different opinion. Is that you literally didn't even let me finish my thought before you just hopped on that whole thing and that just makes you sound.

Speaker 3:          01:02:01       I interrupt. It's what I do. Fine.

Speaker 1:          01:02:07       You're taking this way too seriously. Look, do I have any sort of artistic style of looking at me like I'm in a buffalo wild wings. I'm going to sit here and criticize fucking Andy Warhol. Her fucking,

Speaker 2:          01:02:21       oh yeah. I took an an Elvis cover that somebody else already created and then I painted red and blue stripes across the war. How can a very easily made that poster? That's the kind of stuff that he made. Actually there is a poster of him and on John Michel Basquiat, that was kind of like my tour poster. Yeah, like the kind of like battle of them boxing and stuff like that poster could 100% have been what Andy Warhol did if you were famous back in the day. That's what I'm saying. So he's saying he's not original. I'm saying the person that did that, perhaps putting a head on something, was he the first guy that he's the first day I was Photoshop shit style to that poster, which is really cool by the way. And like that. It reminds me a little bit of what Warhol might have done. That's all I'm saying.

Speaker 2:          01:03:11       When you went to a museum though, like let's be honest, I don't like them. I really don't like it. Look, if it's, if it's a bunch of old cars, if it's painting old cars, if it's paintings, uh, cars, you know, there's a big debate actually, the art community, our automobiles works of art and they took a Ralph Lauren's car collection and they stuck it in one of those fucking stuck up museums there. Moma, whatever the fuck it is. Museum of natural history. The, the, I don't think they put it in. Let me see the fucking on the fifth avenue, whatever the fuck it's called. Every other fucking broad. I dated in New York, that was always the first date. Like they, oh, let's go to a museum. It's like, well you stop back and look at smart. Stop doing this. Just cause you're dumb. Does stop trying.

Speaker 2:          01:04:02       Trying to be, oh for fuck sakes. Let's just go out and get a drink and see if we can deal with each other. I got to go fucking sit there and stand next to you in silence. Reading Shit above dinosaur bones. Yeah, that sounds like a lot of fun. I'll meet you there. Um, no I don't like them. I don't like, one of the worst museums I ever went to was when we went, we were in Vatican City and we should've gone to the right just to look at that overrated painting on the fucking ceiling. We went to the, can we just pause and I just, they know what I'm talking about. They know about the Sistine Chapel, so fucking overrated sizing the art that was in the mannequin. Like this art, that's like hundreds of planet. I'm telling you what now, like this amazing, if I bought that building torcal fucking art, if I bought that building the Sistine Chapel, I would turn that into a cigar room and I would let that smoke go right up into that overrated. Do they make it seem like it's fucking huge? There's no way it took that long bill. You went in there and you looked at him for like five seconds and then you were like ready to get a fucking Panini bull shitting you. I'm going to tell you I'm going to end. He was like the original contractor. They said, hey, can you paint my ceiling? Uh, yeah. Yeah. This will be easy.

Speaker 1:          01:05:18       I'll have this done in like three fucking weeks. Fucking four years later. Yeah. They're fucking the green page on back order. He's got 20 other ceilings he's fucking working on. Um, I mean you can't tell me when you went through the whole Vatican thing and you watched every fucking investement that every goddamn pope ward like after a while you like, I get it. They all wore these ponchos with a cross on it. I was fascinated by it because I love religious art. Oh, okay. What about sexual assault? What about it? He'll fucking 800 pound gorilla. What? Don't they have a little something about that in there? Yeah, cause I kind of went, yeah, well that would have ruined the year while there was an art, the way they hit all those pedophiles, all those years. That's an art form to be moving all those chess pieces around while still collecting the money and not paying taxes. What does that have to do with the art that we're talking about? Saying of the Vatican? Well, if I was to talk about a certain somebody Sitcom right now, I think you would bring up some of his offstage behavior. Are we talking about Cosby? No, we're talking about fucking slapping. Right?

Speaker 1:          01:06:31       Uh, the, the priests are the ones that were painting the fucking Sistine Chapel Bill. No, I taught, I'm not talking about that. I'm talking about when we looked at every fucking fork and chalice that Pope John Paul the fucking 58th. When you go into the Sistine Chapel, which admittedly I thought it was the 16th chapel. Did you really? You don't remember that we are staying on line. I remember I said, you know what I would do, because this line is so fucking long. If I lived here, I would open a bar across the street. Now we call it the 17th chapel. And you're like, why would you call it that? I was like 16 chapel to 70 chapel. And he just looked at me and your eyes narrowed. And he said, Bill, it's the Sistine Chapel. And I said, that's my story about Rome.

Speaker 3:          01:07:24       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:07:24       Alrighty. Fuck all you guys. All right. 37 years old, ladies and gentlemen. Yeah, I'm not into that shit. Okay. You know. Okay. See that, look at you. You're an angel. You can see through my stupidity. You don't have to be into it. I still love you. It's, you know, it is a good guy. It's still, you know what? But the reality is that there are certain things that are common knowledge. I really should have known that. I would think so. But I bet a lot of people think it's the 16th chapel. You know something I don't, uh, I don't like, I don't get embarrassed by shit like that. You really don't know if I think I would. Yeah. Yeah. I thought it was the 16th. I didn't know it was the disgusting and then a big, oh my God. It's assisting. It's like, did, is anything in there from something that you created then shut up. What are you, oh, that was the Apollo 13 mission. Oh really? You were fucking astronaut. It's just sitting in this diner with me getting fucking eggs, aren't ya? And they're not the farmer's market once either. It's why you don't like the, the museums. Do you feel like there is a pretension and people who like art and stuff like that? It's too much fucking shit. It's too much reading. It's reading. Oh my God. It just keeps going and going and going. And then there's people whispering.

Speaker 3:          01:08:51       Sure.

Speaker 1:          01:08:55       That's what happened to me in the, in the Sistine Chapel when we walked in and I was just like, oh wow. It's kind of small anyway.

Speaker 3:          01:09:02       Sure.

Speaker 1:          01:09:04       Oh, I wanted to put that guy's head right to the fucking stained glass window that we were in a church. So it's like a holy place. So you know, you gotta keep it. Why would think they went on a certain level of noise to drown out the children's screen in the basement? Oh my God. They deserve it. Fuck them. Pieces of shit. Um, we can't, we can't end it with that. Why isn't the dog coming in here? I'm a little concerned. Oh, play. Oh, because she's a Clo. Oh, poor thing. She's right there, right baby. All right.

She was just sleeping well, thank you for hanging out on the podcast. Thanks for having me. All right. I'm glad you came by.

Speaker 1:          01:09:52       I don't think those stories of people falling off shit would have been as fun and somebody to bounce it off of. Oh, look who's here. Sleepy old gray bear. Yes. Seeing your dog. I know. We just realized that dog's a senior now. She's eight. She's eight and a half years old. Starting to get a little bit of white in her face. Yeah.
