Speaker 1:          00:00:01       Hey, what's going on is bill burn it's time for the Monday morning podcast for a Monday fucking and match 12th March 12th. The very important day of the history of Barch. That was the day that was the first day slash ever wore a top hat on stage or was it Abraham Lincoln? What would you say that those are the most famous people who ever wore a top hat. Right.

Speaker 2:          00:00:30       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:00:31       Got It. Lincoln just get shot while he was wearing one. So that's how everybody always draws him.

Speaker 3:          00:00:36       Um, I dunno, I feel like you gotta be a certain height. That's, that's tall people shit, you know, to have a fucking top hat and tails, you know? Is there anything funnier than seeing somebody short wearing tall people? Shit. You know, like when you went to your prom, that fucking little fucking five foot, six inch fireplug showing up, wearing the fucking tails

Speaker 1:          00:01:04       look like a little God damn penguin. Um, do people even wear tails that even have prompts anymore? Is it considered unsafe? I know that they're supervised and that they started to fucking book Comedians at them. And now who's kidding? Who? I guess they always should have been, especially if you have a dog.

Speaker 2:          00:01:22       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:01:23       Speak in a ladies and ladies, ladies get in for free. Um, they never talk about that when they talk about equal pay. Huh? Ladies' night. Leave your money at home and bring your snatch cause you're not paying for shit. Right. They don't talk about that through that. All the nightclubs, they get in for free, for free. Um, actually what they really mean, don't they really mean beautiful women,

Speaker 3:          00:01:49       beautiful women. Get it for free, you know,

Speaker 1:          00:01:52       mediocre to ugly women. Then they just start going like, hey, you know, we're uh, we're kind of full right now. And what does that do? That causes of movement. I went to a club the other night and they said it was full and there wasn't, you know, I know that because all of a sudden these other women who yeah, they were skinnier. Yeah. They had better bone structure. Yeah. They were better looking at it. They wouldn't lend me and they let them in. Yeah. This isn't right.

Speaker 2:          00:02:24       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:02:26       What do people who aren't good looking just go to admit that they're not good looking and just realize that they're going to have to walk through another door in life. It makes you stronger. You know, I'd love to have sympathy for you, but I'm a bald, redheaded mail, so I mean, you fucking preaching to the choir.

Speaker 2:          00:02:41       You know,

Speaker 1:          00:02:43       you think the club wasn't full when I showed up. Well, will make me my own room.

Speaker 2:          00:02:52       Wow.

Speaker 1:          00:02:54       It's just the fucking poor me era of human beings is we ignore a real, real, real

Speaker 3:          00:03:00       shit, real shit that's going on. What kind of real shit is going on, Bill? I don't know. I don't pay attention. I know there's gotta be something more important than fucking bathrooms, right? We already got bathrooms. Pick one. I'm sorry.

Speaker 4:          00:03:22       Okay.

Speaker 3:          00:03:24       Anyways, plowing ahead here. Yeah. You're probably wondering why I'm in such a weird fucked up movie. I'm really not in a weird phone. I'm in a good mood. This is me in a good mood. I cleaned up my office, finally, finally put things in their proper place. Um, found a lot of shit that I thought I lost or misplaced or even forgot that I even had. Now I'm a minimalist will be like, well, that's sense what you need to get. You need to get rid of all this. You to get real low as it is. Where does it go? They're minimalist.

Speaker 4:          00:03:54       Okay.

Speaker 3:          00:03:55       Into the ocean. Into a fucking dump. Okay. Stop acting like every fucking post that you have out there. You're going to go sell on craigslist and someone's going to want to buy it. Okay. Isn't it more environmentally sound to be a hoarder rather than sending all your shit to the dump? Poisoning the soil. You have it contained within your own apartment or house or a or or Cabana Oak guesthouse, depending on your living situation.

Speaker 4:          00:04:28       Yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:04:29       You can't tell me ever since Oj that when you're in a guest house, you can't. You can't be the guest and think, what if the fucking person who owns this kills their spouse and somebody else who happened to be there? Wait, am I going to be the person who happens to be there? All right. Note to self the entire time. I'm a guest in this guy's house. Just make sure I'm always wearing, supposed to be, how will I know where I'm supposed to be? I'm just going to avoid this fucking guy and pay the rent on time. That's what Oj did. I have a lot of people talk about the bad that he did. Okay. Which is pretty obvious at this point. Um,

Speaker 4:          00:05:10       yeah,

Speaker 3:          00:05:10       but the good that he did is I think the behavior of people in guest houses. I bet if you were able to chart it, if you've got an algorithm or whatever is these number crunching, crunching people do, they would find that the behavior of the Keto Caitlin's of the world dramatically improved after Oj, you know?

Speaker 4:          00:05:33       Okay.

Speaker 3:          00:05:33       Well I guess you can't say killed those two people. He was acquitted. Um, it's fucked up. How the fuck you supposed to say that? I, you know, I don't, I think I just talked myself into a corner. Look at the bird then I fucking burnt out there.

Speaker 4:          00:05:51       Okay.

Speaker 3:          00:05:52       You know, a lot of, you know, I'm just sitting there looking at that fucking thing. How that fat fuck that bird just flew the way it just did. I think it's all about the legs, I think. Yeah. You know, I bet if you got a fucking really skinny person, right? Had a beer belly and they had little bird legs.

Speaker 2:          00:06:09       Yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:06:10       Nah, I still wouldn't work would it?

Speaker 3:          00:06:14       You know what? I bet you could get them to try if you talked to him long enough. If you talk to him long enough, you know, C'mon Dude, look at he, you shaped just like a burden and you're smarter than that fucking thing. Give it a jump. Come on. I'm sorry. Anyway, so this is Sunday afternoon. Uh, I just put my absolutely darling daughter in the other room for a nap, so I got the fucking big brother camera going here. Where the fuck is it? A Shit with a flux. The camera. God dammit. I just fucking had this thing. I was killing it. I had everything going the way I needed it to be going. Oh, there it is. There it is. What is she doing? Oh, she's sleeping Rocca by Qd and the other room something someday. Then I'll get a broom, clean up all the shit that fell on the floor, and then you'll come out and deal with some more. Oh, dad, can you stop singing your nerd songs? Um, anyways, uh, you know, it's fucking amazing is I'm getting my Invisalign off, allegedly just like Oj, allegedly. I'm getting my Invisalign off this Wednesday. I can't fucking wait. I'm on train number 13. It was projected to take 16 weeks, but I had these fuckers in the whole time. I did my half on my stand up sets. I left them in spitting all over the fucking stage.

Speaker 3:          00:07:42       I just wanted to get it over with.

Speaker 2:          00:07:44       Right.

Speaker 3:          00:07:47       That's a big thing in life when they would, something sucks. You just get it over with. Kay. You get tossed overboard in the ocean. You know what I mean? You see that shark fin. Don't swim away from it. You swim at it head first, get it over with it. What do you say that show gain? Um, anyways, I'm getting my Invisalign off and then they give me a mouth Gad. Uh, so for the rest of my life when I go to sleep, I just popped in the mouth guard and then I'm fine and the ship will stay the same.

Speaker 2:          00:08:24       And uh,

Speaker 3:          00:08:26       and it's also cool because, you know, occasionally I will grind my teeth at night because I'm a lunatic or I'm stressed. I don't know what it is, but it's something I've done ever since I was a little kid. Um, so anyway, so it all worked out and I'll fuck a worked out and I highly recommended and they're not paying me to tell you guys that fucking Invisalign is the shit. But uh, it's the shit, you know, considering what they used to do, put all that Barb wire and you fucking mouth, you know, then God forbid you got into a fight. It was just like you were a fucking bleed. All someone to do is just punch you right in the mouth. I would playing, we were playing killed a man with them, not kill them out with the ball. That's what we used to call that game.

Speaker 3:          00:09:08       You just pick up the football and start running and the other half your grade would tackle you and then you just coughed it up and someone else got it. It was fucking great and played a toll. We played it everyday. Outdoor recess, just a button you come in, you when you weren't even sore, your body was brand new. He had a big puffy coat on. That's all you needed. Um, so we were playing football one time and uh, it was right around the time, you know, junior high when kids started getting braces. And I remember this Kid Sean, he got somehow hit in the mouth and when he got up like the wires that go from like, you know, you know the, each tooth they had like a, like a little fucking central hub where the wires would go through and like the thing had like popped off, the wired popped off.

Speaker 3:          00:09:52       Those things are still glued on. That's right. And he had like two wires sticking straight out of his mouth and maybe even getting up, like making this weird noise and he was bleeding. And then we all just standing there like, ah, somebody get applied. Um, but now they got Invisalign and it's tremendous. And you two and 13, well it depends on how fucked up your teeth are and how much you're willing to wear them because I know somebody else that's getting them and doesn't want to wear them all the time. So she's given into the fact that it's going to take, you know, like a year and a half or some shit. And now it's just like, why wouldn't you get it over with? And she was just like, why wouldn't you just fuck off? And I was like, fine. Fair enough. Fair enough. Who am I to tell you how to fix your fucking dentition?

Speaker 3:          00:10:38       All right. I'm just, you know, I'm excited. I want other people to be excited. Hey, his son to be excited about, I finally watched, I watched two Bruins games this weekend. Yeah, it, Eh, I finally saw Rick Nash Plan with the Bruins spake physical presence, scored a goal on a Saturday. Now matinee game, those games usually suck, right? Cause if fucking teams tired, they're just waken up. They used to like sh there's still shaken off a hangover and all of a sudden that dropping the puck is a bunch of kids there and shit. It feels like, it feels like a charity game, you know, it doesn't feel like the season. Uh, but they played a wild one on Saturday, seven to four. They won. They were up two to nothing looking like it was going to be nice smooth fucking time. And then, uh, the hawks gave a seal right there, Fred.

Speaker 3:          00:11:25       Then it was two to two. I came out with three, two, three, three, four, three, four, four, five, four, six, four, seven, four. Right. I think that's what it was. And then today, like to fucking, you know, I thought we were going to a, we tied it up and thought we had the goddamn thing one. And then shower law. I know the Patrick Sharp took a stick to the face of Charisse and we'd get a shower in the box for four minute fucking major for the rest of the Goddamn game. Right. A double minor I should say. And then, uh,

Speaker 3:          00:11:55       of course they go out there and the fucking, it reminds me when we lost the Stanley Cup to him, but we were like, oh, there is going to be a game seven now there isn't, it's over. Um, they did that fucking Patrick Kane, Jesus Christ, guises sniper. Um, so I'm going to try to watch some more of the gains, but I mean I've watched so many fucking games in the last 10 years, so it didn't feel like I was away that long and I still knew most of the team cause I've been watching, uh, looking at the stats and all of that shit. Um, so I dunno, I guess I'll try it. I don't know what we're not, and I got the kid, man. It's just, it's fucking hard, man. I haven't been able to watch my Celtics. My Bruins patriots are easy cause it's like once a week, you know.

Speaker 3:          00:12:38       So, um, anyways, I'm just fucking, I'm meandering right now because I'm waiting for the, uh, all the reeds and all that bullshit to come in because there's always, I have 50,000 fucking things I have to do today. Even on a Sunday. This is a day arrest. Even God rested on Sunday. I'm working harder than God people. Um, I shouldn't have said that. You know, this fucking person sent me this, this, I don't know, this fucking thing with this guy was convinced that I was possessed by Satan and his eye for cinematography was incredible. The way he was breaking down something that he did. He got every fucking thing that we would doing right. He just had the motivation rock. He was like, this is hypnotic. They're trying to hit the Taj here. It was all the serve Satan. And it's like, no, it's not the serve Satan.

Speaker 3:          00:13:27       It's so I could sell tickets. The reason why there's no crowd shots is because I feel your brain resets every time they cut to the fucking crowd, and then you've got to try to draw him in again. When you go to a fucking standup show, you're not looking at the comedian and then turning around and looking at people laughing every fucking eight seconds. That would be a shitty experience. So I'm trying to recreate the live experience. That's all I'm doing. I'm not trying to serve, uh, you know, the guy down under all right. With my standup special, I do that effortlessly the way I live my life anyways. Um, but it's fucking this youtube video. This guy's comparing like fucking, he goes, look at the [inaudible] x. So kind they use black and white and they fucking do all this shit was really a, it was really insane.

Speaker 3:          00:14:14       Um, my favorite part was when he told his kid and knock it off. I'm like, all right, he's a good dad. Hey, knock it off. Um, but yeah, uh, anyways, you're going to get that right. I guess if you put a fucking special out, you're going to get some shit like that. Who gives a fuck about my standup specials? You know, it was awesome. Last night I stayed in with my lovely, beautiful, gorgeous wife and we hung in and, uh, I started to watch peaky blinders and you don't know nothing about no robbery. Right? She's like, I don't want to watch this every bill, you're wide enough. I have a difficult time, enough understanding. You forget about these fucking people. Right. So I was like, okay, fair enough. So then we were scrolling through and, uh, I look for the nice guys once again, Netflix. Can you make my year and get the Nice guys starring Russell Crowe and, um, God, Jesus. Wow. How can I forget this guy's name? The guy from drive, the guy from la La land. I'll remember it later. I always the fuck is his name. He's fucking hilarious in that movie too. You know. Fuck this. Hang on a second. I'm going to hit pause. I to get this guy's name,

Speaker 3:          00:15:37       sorry. Ryan Gosling.

Speaker 4:          00:15:40       Yeah,

Speaker 3:          00:15:41       they're fucking hilarious in that move. Ryan Gosling's hilarious. But also Cora was hilarious. It's such an underrated comedy and it reminds me of one of my favorite comedies of all time, midnight run as far as I feel like the comedy, so much of it, their reactions and the way they're doing things, it's, it comes from a real place. I don't mind Wacky, I don't mind absurd or any of that bullshit, but, uh, I fucking love that movie and I'm so I looked it up and for whatever reason, Netflix has every fucking movie just about on this streaming surface, the biggest streaming service in the world, world world world. Right. But they don't have that one. So I'm like, fuck. And we scrolled down and then they had Fellman Luis and I was just like, man, I am not, I literally not seen that movie since I saw it when it came out in the movies. And uh, oh, is that a great fucking movie?

Speaker 4:          00:16:38       Okay.

Speaker 3:          00:16:39       Fucking great God damn movie. And it still holds up. And now with all this, me too. Shit, you watch it now and it, it's, it's more relevant than ever. And every guy in there was just this piece of shit hitting on him. Like the guy who plays Gina Davis has a husband, Christopher McDonald, he fought, he fucking steals every scene that he's in.

Speaker 4:          00:17:05       Yeah,

Speaker 3:          00:17:07       you got to, you got to watch it again. What did they tell him? That his wife might be involved in her murder, murder. He just goes, what? W what? Just the way he does. I'm going to be, I'm butchering it. He's fucking hilarious in that movie. And uh, we watched an aroma in the end, you know, I don't want to ruin the ending for people who haven't seen it, but uh, you know, anything that you know is a little nod to vanishing point. You got to love that. Have you ever seen vanishing point? That's one of the first like anti hero. It was during that, not the first, but during that era of the anti hero, like up until then, I guess with movies and Shit, it was always like, you know, the guy with white hat and who's kidding who the white skin was always like the fucking hero.

Speaker 3:          00:17:53       He was always trying to do the right thing. He didn't rob, he didn't steal and he was a fucking hero. And if you stole and you were a piece of shit, uh, you are the black cat, you were the bad guy. You know what I mean? I would say that they'd put minorities in those roles. But way back then, I didn't think they did that. They just had like, they even had white people playing like native Americans and Asians, even Asians. I remember that when I posted that thing from fucking Hawaii five o and they had that fucking white dude and they did some that was eyes to try to make him look. He just looked weird. Um, which was really strange because they had all those, I don't know if they will hope Asian Hawaiian on what the fuck they were, but I mean they had plenty of people who weren't white on that show.

Speaker 3:          00:18:40       I don't know. It didn't make any sense. But anyways, you've got to love Jack Lawrence Mercury Marquee. Um, I liked the first one. They'd had the 67 that he had or the 66. That was a mean fucking looking car. Um, anyways, but we sat and we watched that movie and uh, it's still, it's just still holds up. It's still fucking holds up. This is a time when usually I would start doing some reads, but I don't fucking have any filming my reads Jesus. Bill. Why would you make such a bad fucking joke? You know, I can't even sign into my fucking Gmail right now. I don't know what the problem is. Oh, Instagram instinct. I'm inching closer to getting on Instagram. I figured out what my password is and now they're like, God has been too many fucked up attempts to get into your account. I'm like, all right, that was me.

Speaker 3:          00:19:31       But there's nobody to say that too. So they go in and send this fucking code to you and then they never sent it. Well, who's kid who they send me something back in September and I never fucking responded. So now I think they're looking at my, uh, you know, my account, like it's fucked up or some shit. I have no idea. But anyways, who gives a shit enough about that? Um, oh, so thank you to everybody who, uh, who came out to my shows of Vancouver, Jesus Christ and I have a good time. I had such a fucking great time, uh, performing up there, such a beautiful city and all that. And um, this woman started running down to the stage. She was yelling something about how lesbians were better at something and I was just like, why do I don't know what you're talking about and you know, and I was being an asshole, you know, make it fun of all that and me to shit.

Speaker 3:          00:20:21       You know, just, you know, feminists that you did just so easy to get mad. How do you not do it? It's just so fucking tempting as a comic. So I'm up to it just saying this fucking ridiculous ignorant shit and everybody's laughing, including all the rest of the women there. Cause he know what I'm saying is so fucking ridiculous. They know. I don't believe it. Right. But nowadays there's, there's always the, uh, you know, Franny face value in the fucking crowd, right? You've got to fucking take everything. Like, did he mean, now I'm offended, now I'm offended. So I dunno what the fuck she was doing. She started like marching down towards the stage and all this security cave and just got her in a way. And next note. Next thing I knew she was being escorted out, which sucked because that meant the fun was over a curb. I heard people, People's guides of preds and came out to the show. They were trying to just people walking out saying that she was a plant. That was funny. Is that like I got that kind of time and money to fly an actor up to fucking Vancouver to interrupt my show. It's just like at that point when I just hired somebody to write me better material, um, who knows? I don't fuck, I have no idea. I don't know why people always think that

Speaker 3:          00:21:35       that's such an old show Biz thing to have a plant in the crowd. But people used to do it. They did used to do it. So I guess it's fair that they, that they, uh, that they think that. But anyways, so she got kicked out. I never kick anybody out on the show and it wasn't my call either. They just fucking escorted her out. Um, which I thought was funny after, I mean, I kind of felt bad. I was like, well that's, you know, we've been fun. If she stuck around, I could hear it. Some more of a fucking crazy theories,

Speaker 3:          00:22:05       you know, I don't know. I don't, there's this, and I had, I had another two women walked out on my show when I was down in the Improv. Now if I was some sort of thinking man, it would be like, well, hey bill, that's two incidents the one week, maybe it's shoe. But you know, I really don't think it is. I just think that the, uh, the extreme left are, are out of their fucking minds now. And they have this thing where if you, if that the, there's only one way to think and it's their way and there's only certain subjects you can joke about. And if they don't think that you should be joking about it, that they're, they're just gonna really just behave like children was funny when they got up and walked out when I was at the Improv, like people were going to care. Um, I dunno. Hey, you know what? You know what? It's just the world that we're living in, Huh? Just as overly sensitive fucking time that we live in. And so anyways, uh,

Speaker 4:          00:23:03       okay,

Speaker 3:          00:23:03       the fuck am I going to get these reeds 80 just see Trump is going to go talk to Kim Jong. They're going gonna go hang out. So I actually looked up the fucking story, right? I looked at story and we see if I can find this shit. And my first thought when I saw that picture side decide is like, you know, Trump gets way too much shit for his fucking hair. Do the picture they have on the Google news is, hey, it looks good to me. You know, I think it was bad for a long time where he had, he did have a comb over, but since then hair plugs got way better and I think he filled it in, but he likes having the big swooping thing cause I think that's part of his look. But I think that's all his hair but whatever. But Kim Jong UN's haircut. How in the fuck you say, Jesus Christ, I don't want to sabotage this meeting, but my God, he has like a Joseph Stalin meets Moe Howard with a little bit of John Travolta. All in the same,

Speaker 4:          00:24:07       yeah,

Speaker 3:          00:24:08       all in the same fucking

Speaker 4:          00:24:10       okay.

Speaker 3:          00:24:11       Haircut. It's incredible. Really? Yes. It's like the kind of haircut like a wrestler. You know, what have they wanted to make a splash? Like, oh my God, who the fuck is this guy? Um, but anyways, isn't it? You mentioned the balls and me just sitting here and fucking completely bald. Sitting there trash in these people's haircuts. I gave Trump a naughty, that nautical or Septra compared to what? Compared to what I'm fucking dealing with, I guess. Although I think I look better than a,

Speaker 3:          00:24:40       Hey, well let's do that. Let's do that on the Photoshop. You know, when they go, who wore it best, you know, do a fucking Trump, me and Kim Jong Un and just vote worst haircut and fuck all you assholes. Who picked me just to be cunt. I respect it, but fuck you too. All right. CIA Director, Mike Pompeo has defended Donald Trump's decision to meet North Korean leader. Kim Jong saying the president understands the risk. Uh, I actually think it's fucking great that he's doing this. This should happen more. Go talk it out before a bunch of people fucking die. You're lunatics. He said, Mr. Trump isn't doing this for theater. He's going there to solve a problem despite chief told a Fox News Sunday. Uh, it's funny that he's a spa, a spa, a spy, and he's going on the fucking news. The president has said the summit could produce the greatest deal for the world. What else do what he say? He's been saying that that's how it got him in the office. Everything's great, but critics have warned that it's a tops tog scope. Poorly. The two nations will be in a worse position than before. Uh, the, it's the political gamble of the 21st century that the tricky task of preparing for the Trump Kim summit. Why is everybody so like, why is it better if that the two of them don't talk?

Speaker 3:          00:26:02       Says no sitting US president has ever met a North Korean leader. Mr. Trump reportedly accepted the offer to do so on the spot when it was really relayed by South Korea, South Korean envoys on Thursday, taking his own administration by surprise. Let me ask you this, please tell me they're not going to meet some fucking Italian restaurant in the village. Okay. And if any point Kim Jones says, I need to go to the bathroom. All right, you better. You better have something down by your ankles. That's all I'm saying. Um, anyways, attempts to negotiate aid for just disarmament deals have failed repeatedly since 2003 when the north pulled

Speaker 1:          00:26:44       out of the nuclear non proliferation treaty. Mr Pavio told CBSC administration had it's eyes wide open to the challenge of dealing with North Korea. Um, I gotta be honest with you, I don't understand what the fucking problem is.

Speaker 4:          00:26:59       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:27:00       Like why are there so we have like economic sanctions on them. Is that why there are people are starving and we have that on them because they were part of the communist expansion.

Speaker 1:          00:27:10       You know, there's gotta be a better way to do it. We gotta, you know, economic sanctions. We, why don't you go the other way? Why don't we ever go the other way and just become like the, the, the fucking, you know, just be like a good shit, you know, fight the guy to the Superbowl. Get him some whores, you know, then he, then he doesn't want to blow this place up. He, I can't fucking blow that up. Yeah, I bought to the football game. I got my dick sucked. Well what are we doing here? I liked those guys. Right. Is that going? The Bruins in the rangers hated each other and then they all played on the same team and they went and they played the Russians and all of a sudden the rivalry fucking died. That's what you do. These people they got, they got to hang out. You know, I don't know how good that will be for the rest of us. Cause then they're probably like joined forces. I have no fucking idea. Um,

Speaker 4:          00:27:56       yeah

Speaker 1:          00:27:57       sweat. Don't read the news. I mean, Princess Diana's iconic minefield walk. What the fuck is this about?

I put my right set of coping in the day. They fucked up. I still tip the guy, right? I got to need to be liked. He was a good guy, whatever. So I ordered again, same fucking place and I'm waiting and I'm waiting and then I'm looking and it says it's going to be here at like six. And I'm like, fine, you know, but I can't negotiate it. And then fucking, I dunno, I hit something and it said, oops, it's been a problem you order can't go through. So I was just like, hey fucking fuck Postmates and all this shit and ate something else. And in the middle of prepping that, uh, the doorbell rings and my order came, so I don't know what I did. So I apologize to Postmates for all the Shit I just said about him walking around my house. Evidently I fucked it up. I went back to some other screens. All I knew was I couldn't tell if I ordered it and had gone through.

Speaker 2:          00:44:01       I don't, I don't know.

Enough with me fucking drooling over all those great places I get to perform at Boston sports. Hey, they had Billy Russell. Do you think Boston is the type of city that could have supported two teams in any sport? Do you think it's something you could handle in the future? Thanks and go fuck yourself. Um, well, we had that opportunity way back in the day. We had the, uh, let's see, we had the, uh, the Boston Braves and the Boston Red Sox, the Braves ended up leaving.

Speaker 4:          00:46:53       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:46:55       I Dunno. I Dunno. I gotta be honest with you. I don't know how the Brooklyn Nets did it.

Speaker 4:          00:47:02       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:47:03       We're all those people out there with nick fans and then all of a sudden the New Jersey, Nick's move out there and it just says Brooklyn and everybody just jumps on the bandwagon and says, fuck the Knicks. I don't get that.

Speaker 4:          00:47:15       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:47:15       Especially if you're a long time suffering Knicks fan. And then what if they win it? You know, even if the Brooklyn Nets when it, it's not going to be the same. You didn't fucking, they showed during your life,

Speaker 1:          00:47:32       you know, that's like the second wife. You don't love her the way you love the first one because the first one went bad, I would think. Right. I don't know. Um, and then of course we had two football teams there for a minute. We had the New England patriots and we had the Boston breakers in the USFL. I went to a game against the Washington federals, that Nickerson Nickerson field. I know, I know. I don't, you know, this is the deal. We don't need more than one team and every sport the Way New York does to try to fucking win some championships. I'm telling you, the fucking New York Yankees or the sugar daddy of New York City, I, that's the reason why New York City is not looked upon as one of the most pathetic fucking sports towns ever. Just conspired considering the amount of titles versus the amount of fucking teams. Um,

Speaker 4:          00:48:25       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:48:25       You know, the next habit, one in forever. The Nets have never won the med seven one in 30 something years. The jets have at one since Superbowl fucking three, uh, four wells. The Knicks, the Knicks since what 73?

Speaker 4:          00:48:43       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:48:43       The rangers have won one since 1940 and they're going on a 25 year fucking drought again. Uh, they're about halfway through that fucking curse again already. Just like that. They went 54 years. The last time. They're almost at the halfway point of the, um,

Speaker 1:          00:49:02       giants. A decent giants are respectable. Um, and also they did a bar, you know, some giants also want some NFL titles too. So, um, but what kills the fucking city for me, aside from my blind hatred of them is the fact that, you know, you can just go, oh, what about the giants? Cause you already have the jets so that you don't have to have the jets hanging around your neck, out the fucking meds a lot. What about the Yankees? You know what I mean? They always have like a fucking option. Um, so yeah, I dunno. And I gotta be honest with you, I don't understand how the clippers fucking survive, but they do. They do. Um, I just don't see that happening in a, a city like Boston, the size of it and the, the ridiculous loyalty that you would bring a new team. Like who the fuck would you bring in there? I mean, everybody hates us at this point in everybody's talked shit about us. So what, what are you going? What are you, who are you gonna move there? The jag was the new England Jag was.

Speaker 4:          00:50:05       Okay.

I recently started eating animal fat again and I feel a lot better. I'm not going to preach against Fredric [inaudible] vegetarianism, but the mental benefits of those types of cholesterol is complete, improved my hormone energy and cognitive levels. I only eat grass fed meat and try to eat in the morning to improve brain function. Also, since I started lifting weights once or twice a week, my upper body feels better than when doing when doing basic tasks around the house and yard.

Speaker 1:          00:51:04       Uh, what's your take on red meat? Are you picky where it comes from? Nah, dude. I've literally, I'll lead a fucking cow. They need another cow. I don't have, I don't have the patients. The, there's a butcher, you know, a couple of towns over, I guess I could go to sometimes I go there, but generally speaking I don't know what I'm eating. Um, but I try to eat as well as I can. Uh, what's my take on red meat? It's fucking delicious. Um, you know, I start to read up on all of that shit. It just gets so fucking depressing. So I try me and then he goes to that, they just say it's grass fed. Okay. So it's grass fed. Everything sends. It's fucking organic. It isn't organic. It's got a bunch of crap put in there like the system to monitor what's in your food.

Speaker 1:          00:51:55       Like most systems at this point is so fucking corrupt. Um, I don't, I don't know how to, I don't know what to do, but uh, yeah, I'm actually, I will go back to lifting weights. I don't think I'm going to do like bench pressing. I'll do it with dumbbells for some reason with dumbbells. I can control the angle independently on both shoulders and I don't have a fucking problem. But a bench pressing is for a young people and I am not young. All right. For Mont Gun Laws Bill, I'm from New Hampshire and I always found it fascinating how lenient for months gun laws are. Here's a basic rundown of how Bernie runs things and why he's always careful around the gun law conversation. A minimum age to pursue, purchase and possess in Vermont, Vermont allows any person age 16 or older to possess a handgun without the consent of a parent or Guardian.

Speaker 1:          00:52:49       There is no minimum age to possess a rifle or a shotgun in Vermont. Fremont law allows firearm sales to anyone. 16 years or older. Thanks. All right, well I really don't have a problem with any of that. I just have a problem with people who are mentally ill getting them. Uh, that's the problem. And nobody on either side seems to know how to stop that from happening. You know the guy's the fucking people who buy guns keep making this is this guy made this whole video showing how like this, this rifle, he had had a bullet twice the size of an ar 15 going, but this is the, this is the friendly gun. Nobody's scared of this one and it's got a bolt twice cyber. So you have to stop that and semi automatic. You know what this saying? You know what they're saying? And everybody's just got to fucking just sit there and act like they don't understand what the f doesn't. Everybody want this shit to stop somebody for the love of fucking God. Just come up, figure out how to fuck you. You can't be a fucking nutjob and just walk in and get a fucking gun. That's the fucking problem. But people who like to buy guns don't want it to be extra difficult for them to get the fucking thing because they're not nuts.

Speaker 2:          00:54:06       So,

Speaker 1:          00:54:08       which is crazy to me. I don't, you know, ah Ya, Ya, Ya, Ya, Ya, Ya, Ya. But watching both of those arguments, they're talking about two totally different fucking things. One size, just like cage free to have all of the guns. Stupid.

Speaker 2:          00:54:25       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:54:25       Guns are great. Guns do great things. Okay? They, they do. You keep defend yourself with a gun and you can provide, you can hunt with a gun. Okay? You can scare somebody off with the fucking gun. This is great fucking things. And then there's bad things you could do with the gun.

Speaker 2:          00:54:41       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:54:43       Um, to Helen, adventure. Hell of an adventure. All right, wife on able to grow the fuck up. Okay. Hey there. Billy said old sober ball sack. Now I'm not sober anymore. I got a rack, a bud tall sitting in the fridge. I love a Budweiser every once in a while and it can't, it takes me back to when I first got shit faced down. Faneuil Hall. Uh, Ben, a listener for a few years. Actually I was drinking Michelob light that night. I'm a particular, um, I'm particularly a fan of the way you look at sensitive topics like religion. Not everyone is able to question the fact of why all other religions sound silly, like our own. I love that bit on your special. Well thank you. You know, and as much as you loved it, somebody else thought I was a servant of Satan. Now for the question, I'm a guy on my early thirties, you mean in my early thirties. Married with a boot with a beautiful two year old daughter. Congrats on yours by the way. It's a wonderful thing being a father. Yes it is. However, my wife routinely gets nostalgic about her teenage years. She's unable to get a steady job, keeps changing topics. It's, it's school. So she attends a certain course for a couple of years, gives up heads onto the next one. I was hoping becoming a mum would help, but it looks like it hasn't recently. She's even been asking how upset would I be if she told me she was cheating?

Speaker 1:          00:56:07       Oh, what the fuck it, that's it. Uh, she has apparently been watching some fucking show on Netflix where the protagonist is a check that cheats to feel free and young again.

Speaker 2:          00:56:22       Yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:56:24       Oh my, isn't it a fight? It's just women. I swear to fucking God. I swear to God.

Speaker 2:          00:56:30       Okay.

Speaker 3:          00:56:30       Do you know if they have, I put a show on the fucking air where a guy was cheating on his wife to feel free and young again, the amount of fucking attacks that that God damn show would get. You know, this is one thing that I have learned generally when it comes to women. Okay. If you fuck up, it's your fault. Okay. It's your fault. If they fucked up, it's because it's something you did. That's kind of how it works. Um, I told her, I think that's bullshit. I can go out on a guys' night out, smoke a cigar, and drink some alcohol and have a fucking great time. And that's basically more than enough for me. Unfortunately. I have also found out she's been trying to engage in conversation with their first big crush. Oh boy. Dude. Like, I, you know, you don't have to be a genius to read these tea leaves here, man. At least the way you're presenting it.

Speaker 2:          00:57:23       Okay.

Speaker 3:          00:57:23       So what's your takes on this? What the fuck do I do with this woman? We're planning on having a second child, but honestly, I'm not sure if it's a good idea. It's fine for me to stay with my daughter and she can fuck off if that's what she wants.

Speaker 2:          00:57:38       Uh,

Speaker 3:          00:57:39       I almost think you have to tell her that. Find out first what's just be like, what's going on with you. You're asking me how I would feel if you cheated on me. You watching this show with this woman's cheating and you're, you're having conversations with your, your first big crush. Okay. I need to know what's going on. Are you going through a phase? Because if this fucking things over, it's fucking over. I'm not having another kid with you.

Speaker 2:          00:58:10       MMM.

Speaker 3:          00:58:14       And I wouldn't get upset the way I'm getting upset for you to say it. I would just put it on line like what's going on with you? And, um, I don't know how much I would trust her.

Speaker 2:          00:58:25       Okay.

Speaker 3:          00:58:25       Listened to what she has to say. And before, uh, I have another kid with that person, I would fucking die. I would hire a private investigator to follow around to see if she's not fucking somebody else. Uh, no, I wouldn't, but you should. Uh, by the way, you said I'm doing very well professionally and have also some hobbies that keep me entertained. Having a daughter certainly takes a toll on a relationship. I'm guessing she's had, she has too much free time and maybe consequently feels neglected. We do try to watch a show every now and then and we'd go out as a family regularly on the weekends. Sex Life is okay. Not sure if we can blame this situation on me. Thanks a lot.

Speaker 2:          00:59:04       MMM.

Speaker 3:          00:59:08       Well, God, no, she's gonna.

Speaker 2:          00:59:10       Yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:59:11       I mean, what man does it feel fucking neglected to when they have a kid? I mean, your sex life does suffer,

Speaker 1:          00:59:20       you know, so that you then go out and, you know, do something to feel free and wanted.

Speaker 2:          00:59:28       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:59:31       Yeah. You need to sit down and talk to her. Uh, find out what the fuck is going on. And I would just tell her what you're doing and the way you make me feel right now is not even remotely fair and it's not something I would do to you. So what the fuck? Uh, just clean that up. Say it in a nice way.

Speaker 2:          00:59:52       Uh,

Speaker 1:          00:59:54       man, it's fucking annoying. Does a show out there where a woman flux around to feel free and young again? Um, listen, here's the thing. All right.

Speaker 1:          01:00:05       It's not that I even fucking mind that show because I believe that there are people out there, like there's people out there that they're just not designed to be married. There's people out there that can actually do that and it doesn't mean shit to him. Both men and women and they can just fucking walk back in. It doesn't mean shit to him. The problem is the person they're with it means something too. So, um, I'm pretty fucking open minded, but uh, I've just annoyed that if, if you made a, you know, did they, I guess it was Californication like that. I have no idea. I never watched that show. I couldn't get into that show. I didn't get what this guy's problem was. Ah, man. You know, these fucking young chicks just want to keep banging me.

Speaker 1:          01:00:46       I'm supposed to feel bad for this guy. Um, anyways, friend's wife is attracted to me. Jesus dear billiard, the cube bald, the cue balls. I like to appreciate the podcasts and everything you do and thank you for taking the time to read this email. No problem. Thank you for the funny nickname. I like it. Uh, I'm in a tricky situation here. There are four people involved. My Buddy of 12 years. Oh man, his wife of two years. Dude, where's your loyalty? My girlfriend of six months and myself, we're all in our mid to late twenties.

Speaker 2:          01:01:24       Oh boy. Um,

Speaker 1:          01:01:27       is recently come to light that the wife is interested in me. Oh Geez. You just skipped over a lot of fucking details. How did that come about? She sent you a Valentine.

Speaker 1:          01:01:40       Oh, you guys having inappropriate conversation that led to that end. He was, I met her about three years ago. Why she and my buddy were still just dating. She was my type and I was drawn to her immediately. She is at least a nine for my tastes, but I just put her in the unattainable compartment in my brain. Since she wasn't available, I did not give her any additional thought beyond being cordial. I didn't really care to get to know her and I didn't think about what it would be like to date her though she had been single. I would have gone after it. All right, so so far, according to you, you've been a good guy. Fast forward to the recent past. My Buddy's wife and I got to know each other on a bit more of a personal level. On my birthday a few months ago, my girlfriend was there too and it seemed like my bud's wife took an interest in getting to know my girlfriend as well. Since then, the four of us have hung out a few times and the wife has gotten to know me a lot better.

Speaker 4:          01:02:37       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:02:37       I've also been hitting the gym, which has gotten the attention of my buddy's wife. Ah, Jesus Christ.

Speaker 4:          01:02:47       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:02:47       All right. They'd been married two years, your 20s in your late twenties. So she's looking to pull the ripcord.

Speaker 4:          01:02:53       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:02:54       MMM. Where the fuck was I? Yeah. Okay. So one weekend a group of people including myself and my buddy's wife.

Speaker 4:          01:03:06       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:03:07       Go to a club. My girlfriend was invited but decided to go to sleep instead. Obviously alcohol was flowing and there isn't much room on a dance for I'll spare you the details. Do what do you mean? Spare me the details? It was just getting good. Fuck what the fuck. This is like a a Cinemax movie. I'll spare you the details and suffice to say that I learned that night that she was into me.

Speaker 4:          01:03:32       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:03:33       Uh, when, what she was doing the running man on your Dick. I don't know what. Okay. I was pretty overwhelmed and thrilled because I thought she was a bit out of my league and I'm also, I'm also am not the happiest in my relationship. What makes it harder for me to sort out my feelings on the matter. This girl likes cells in the areas that my girlfriend doesn't am. I certainly am very attracted to her and enjoy this type of attention. I didn't know if she was unhappy in a relationship of what I've tried to see what this girl wants or if there's a problem with their marriage, but she has had a lot of dodgy answers, like I wasn't looking for anything or this isn't supposed to go anywhere, or I'm perfectly happy in my relationship, et cetera. She also has a hard time committing to any boundaries of fuck this chick. Fuck this chick. Or maybe she just got drunk and said something stupid.

Speaker 4:          01:04:22       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:04:23       It all sounds like bullshit to me. I think she is lacking affection from my buddy and she's bored and Horny. She also sounds like she just doesn't want to admit that there's a problem. She's trying to have the security of a marriage and the thrill of a new romance. We haven't kissed or anything yet big word yet, but I feel like we've already desecrated both of our relationships. I also feel like any increased fun, talk about it and the tension will eventually reach the inevitable breaking point. Yeah. You gotta stay away from her. What should I do? My girlfriend will lose her shit. If she hears about this. My buddy will be really unhappy. I think you flipped those.

Speaker 4:          01:04:57       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:04:58       I think you girlfriend be unhappy. Your Bro, your buddy. We'll re lose his shit.

Speaker 4:          01:05:02       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:05:03       Um, anyways, and I already feel like I couldn't trust this girl if we did get together. However, I don't really care. I just loved the hookup with her. I can, while it's honest, I could tell this girl has something wacky going on, but I don't have the strength to reject her advances.

Speaker 3:          01:05:18       What should I do? Thank you so much and go fuck yourself. I stopped going out to the club with them or fucking rub one out before you go out or don't drink when you go out there. Yeah, that's going to blow up. That is going to fucking blow up and your face. Um, but who's kidding who, man, that type of shit happens all the fucking time. All the fucking time. Married women will come up to another guy and say that they're attracted to them. I mean there's all this shit out there now about guy's behavior and that type of shit. Um, you know, women do it all the fucking time and they say they're better at it. I don't think they necessarily are. I think what the thing is, is that just women are into vengeance. So you know, you know, if, if he gets like something like that going and if the end, if they don't get a fucking check for $1 million in a house, they're going to try to do something to blow up your life.

Speaker 3:          01:06:24       That's what they do guys. We walk away. Fuck you. Booch and we just, we've generally speaking, we just, we walk away. They, they don't, they burned down your fucking life. Um, so, uh, dude dairy, first of all, break up with the fucking check you're with now and go find somebody else to fuck around with. All right? You don't need to be fucking around with your buddies, unhappy wife. Um, cause you're never going to be able to trust her. All right. Do you just not, and then you're going to lose your friendship at 12 years with this other guy. All right? This is basically, um, like your Dixon Congress right now. Like filibustering, you know your deck has the floor right now. That's what the problem is. If you just sit down, okay. And you listed all the pros and cons of doing this. If you are aware, I was at right now sitting there, the answer is easy. Don't do that. Don't do that. But when your rented and your deck is there, all fucking logic goes out the fucking window. So, um, you know, uh, I dunno, I just, you know, I, I would just fucking,

Speaker 3:          01:07:50       she said there's nothing else to it. I would leave it at that and if she brings it up again, I would just say, look, you said there was nothing to it. Okay. So I don't want to hear any more of that kind of talk. I already did it. You can't hang out with her anymore. You can't, you cannot fucking hang out with her unless that dude is there. And if this guy is really a fucking friend, by the way, wait a minute. If this guy is really your friend, you know, you wouldn't be thinking about doing that. And B.

Speaker 4:          01:08:24       Okay.

Speaker 3:          01:08:25       Oh Man, I don't know if you tell him. I don't know if he should tell. I wouldn't tell him it's a fucking mess. You know a woman would. Women would,

Speaker 4:          01:08:33       okay.

Speaker 3:          01:08:34       Women would initiate the conversation and then turn around and fucking tee, you know? Yeah. Don't tell him. Don't tell them. That's a stupid fucking idea cause she, she'll flip the fucking story, start crying, he'll feel bad and he's going to choose her over you. Dude, you got a situation. There's just so many fucking ways that this can go and none of it's good unless you just walk away, walk away, go back to the wrong. Go back to the wrong fucking sad moment in fucking when you're playing cards, we just kind of admit, you're not going to win tonight. Just fucking cash out and go back to the fucking room. That's what you should do. A jerk off tours. As much as you fucking want to get it out of your system. Go find somebody else that you like that makes you not to think about your buddy's wife.

Speaker 3:          01:09:12       How about that? There? There we go. Um, but I'm sure she just wants to feel free. All right. I know I was a little bit of an asshole, but what are you gonna do? All right. That's the podcast. Um, once again, thank you very much. It came out in Vancouver and I'm going to be in Ontario coming up this weekend on the 17th. Wherever the fuck I'm going to be. I came up against when Al, I think it's up on my website. Bill Bill bird.com. That's the podcast. Go fuck yourselves and I'll check in on you on Thursday.
