Speaker 1:          00:02          Hey, what's going on is Phil Berger and uh, just checking it on you so I can't yell too loud. Okay. Yell too loud. The street. I thought Monday the peas and everything will pop it on this fucking thing. So I'm gonna try to hold it a little further away. Maybe talk a little bit louder. Um, welcome to the Thursday afternoon. Monday morning podcast just before Friday, Aka the just checking in on podcast for June 4th, 2015. Ah, fuck. I'm missing everything. Oh No. I miss game one of the Stanley Cup finals. I literally just woke up about an hour ago. I'm still fucking jetlagged. So, uh, I stay up and I drink as a cafe. Wait until like, that's how I put myself to sleep. Like Nia is always going to take a sleeping pill. Just take one of these. And I'm always like, I'm not taking that thing. She goes, why? I go, cause that's like a 10 day bender to u of t your liver. Why don't I go down to the cafe and I'll fucking drink like Ernest Hemingway, you know, which is really just like, yeah, it's only a one day bender to your liver. Right. I guess if you drink like Hemingway or John Bottom, then it's considered maybe like a three day bender. I don't know what, but that's how I do it. That is how I do it. Sorry. So, um,

Speaker 2:          01:26          okay.

Speaker 1:          01:27          Yeah. Well last night neo was more tired than I was, so she came back to La Plata Mount and um, she was going to go to sleep. So I was like, why am I gonna fucking be down here by myself, you know, like some goddamned degenerate. Um, so I came back here. Uh, I don't know that I've been fucking up every sense and I was not up ever since. I stayed up to like three, four in the morning, ended up waking me up inadvertently. And um,

Speaker 2:          01:56          okay.

Speaker 1:          01:57          So we started watching this, this video of this trial, I guess it already happened. This, this woman who seem really, really nice. She met this guy who was some his parents smoked crystal meth and he got himself out of it, raised themselves, became uh, uh, um,

Speaker 2:          02:16          okay.

Speaker 1:          02:17          Are Those Byu People Mormon became a Mormon, you know, was trying to abstain from sex. He got himself a little side piece. Basically she was just a side piece to him and she loved him and then he ends up dumping her and then she's still kinda came back and hooked up with them every once in awhile. And uh,

Speaker 2:          02:38          okay.

Speaker 1:          02:39          And uh, and then she realized that she was getting the old heave Ho a keyword there is how, that's how she felt like she was being treated and she came back one night and she fucking killed him, stabbed him up, shot him, and then stabbed him, fucking slit his throat, all this crazy shit. And then came up with the worst fucking story ever was that there was two people that intruded killed him, put the gun to her head, pulled the fucking trigger and the gun didn't go off. And then she grabbed your person or your keys and all that ran out of the house as the, I guess the two of them are going like, can you believe it didn't go off? Wait a minute, where did that woman goes? So then she gets in the car and fucking drove away, stunned out into the middle of the desert and didn't call anybody or tell anybody anything and actually visited other people and never said a fucking word to anybody.

Speaker 1:          03:31          And, uh, five days later, the dude's friends came into the apartment and found his body and uh, and she got the, she got the death penalty. Fucking crazy story. Isn't that nice? Is that uplifting for Thursday, Thursday afternoon? I got to tell you, I was watching an interview and she really seemed like a nice person. She seemed like a sweetheart. And I like to think that I got a good gauge, but it was fucking a, I dunno, it's disturbing. I don't know. You know, it was even more disturbing than that was yesterday. I went out and I got a cheeseburger. Right. Ah, they got this place, has cheeseburger over here in Nia is fucking hilarious. She goes, hey, there's got the best burger in Paris is supposed to be at this place. And I'm like, fuck yeah, I like cheeseburgers, let's go. And it wasn't until after I've finished the cheeseburger and said it was fucking delicious that she told me that she learned about the place by watching a keeping up with the Kardashians and Chloe, he said that that was her favorite fucking place to get a burger. And I go, why wouldn't you tell me that? And she goes, because if I fucking told you that you wouldn't want it to eat here or are you trying to come in? Uh, hang on a second. The lovely mia. Everybody posts show up. Punch. Your mom was deaf. No, I say madame, I sent him a dumb cause you're married, right? Wait, wait. All right, come on Kim.

Speaker 1:          04:57          On Aqua. Chloe's the big one, right as j law had says the power forward, power forward of the Kardashians. Lay down here cause I don't really mind. I would say she's the tallest. Maybe not the biggest since Kim is pregnant. Congratulations Kimi cakes. All right. You have, you will have to leave. All right. So anyways, so here's the thing. I did the most disgusting thing I ever did in my life. Like we are a side dish or macaroni and cheese. I took the macaroni and cheese and I put it in the bottle of Greece. It was ag on the, on the Burger too. So there was bake. No, but I'm saying the puddle was the Ang yoke in the grease from the Burger and I put macaroni and cheese in it. It's the most disgusting thing I've ever done. But it was absolutely fucking delicious. I you can't tell me I didn't block at least one of my, uh, what is it? Your aorta arteries, your ventricle, the vulva. I'm very [inaudible] was amazing. I would go back

Speaker 3:          05:58          before the end of this trip to be honest with you. I was thinking about it this morning. I'm off Saturday. I'm just thinking of friends within our bump. Paris highly recommended. Oh, you have to text for a reservation, which you won't be able to figure out unless you're near, cause I wouldn't have been able to figure out what, I'm sick of the French with their little tables. Oh wait. Oh really? Why? Oh, because it just like if they got these little fucking table table table every, not everything is little here.

Speaker 3:          06:33          Well that's because it's a fucking rip off. You know, it's like New York. It was a super small apartments, but I mean New York you can sit down and have an adult size table at those fucking doll house tables make, God forbid you order some food, you got to pick your drink up. Don't let me see. It was almost all pleased. Your moves the glass. Um, so anyways, I'm glad you're here to taper this part. Uh, so I was, I was over here and Nia showed me the cover of what magazine was that? Vanity Fair. Vanity Fair was talking about Caitlyn Jenner. Yeah, the Dash Kardashians just blew it. I was going to fucking build the whole thing up cause I was looking at how do I know, I'm like, how do I know that chick? Is that somebody we know you're a woman? And I was thinking she's not good enough. She's not good looking enough to be on the cover. Is she a publicist? Is She some famous publicists? And then it was Mick, Caitlyn Jenner. Caitlin with us. See, wow. I gotta tell you man, that is the most relations Katelyn cakes. I know. I got to tell you, that is the most,

Speaker 3:          07:41          listen, those was hardcore thing I've ever seen played out.

Speaker 2:          07:44          Okay.

Speaker 3:          07:44          And like, uh, all that Marilyn Manson Shit and Alice Cooper and Ozzie biting the head off a bat. Nothing compares to the what the fuck factor. And I'm not saying I'm to like, you know, you're comparing like, like shock, shock, shock rock tactics to someone becoming transgendered. I really don't. Somebody that you knew not, can you let me, can you let me continue up? They're ignorant thought. Sure. No, you shouldn't say that. This is the first time I ever experienced this. I had to be able to fucking say what I'm thinking. You see his own, his own daughters that go in like so wait a minute, you're going to be borrowing my toenail Polish. They got to get their head around it. I'm allowed to get my head around I so I bless him. Okay. That's what he wanted to tilt chair. Well he did it now he's now he's a shape. Is He? But he still has his Dick, right? Bell does he or she wants to be called she, she wants to be called Kaylin. Okay. I'm cool. I'm all right with that. She has not had surgery. No she has not.

Speaker 2:          08:45          Yeah

Speaker 3:          08:46          I think that's an issue if you chase. So she has a penis and she, she still is she at this point? Correct. Cause those are, the reality is is you don't have to do any of that. You can say I want to be called Chez and people should just respect it pretty much because it's the whole idea about gender not necessarily being rooted in physicality or sexuality. It being more of a state of mind. So this is like, so this is a big debate of course. So this is like some Ornette Coleman Shit. Who is that with your body or their Coleman? He was one of those guys who played so free with jazz. There was really no one and even like Charlie Parker would walk off the band stair going, I don't know what the fuck these guys are playing. Okay. So right.

Speaker 3:          09:29          I think this is a groundbreaking thing that he's the first and he will be like, he's like the uh, I don't know what though. Well, I'm not going to wade into that fucking sinkhole. God knows. I'll say the wrong fucking thing first. The chance gendered person on the cover of Time magazine last year, which was actually the first, no, no, but I mean as far as Cox from orange is the new black. And what was her name before that? Larry? I don't know. And it doesn't fucking matter. I think you should, you should keep your like, like I, I would, I would be, I go Trump bill. I would be Beth. Beth, can we talk about that? Decided to transition was you really go bad, bad? No, I think, I think I'd be Janet and I would be such a cunt.

Speaker 3:          10:21          Ridiculous. Yeah. But you don't mean now as a male I'm awarded for being an asshole. You know, that, that ridiculous feminist theory that if a woman does it, she's a con. But if a guy does a Doula, you want to be president. Moron's um, I feel like, man, I did not hear the microphone assholes when they're assholes, but I don't think they're morons for saying that men get to get to do what it get to act, especially in business. And the more, um, let's say cut cutthroat like a mark Cuban. Mark Cuban is a fucking deck, but Mark Cuban is also brilliant and a really successful businessman. But I feel like more often than not, he gets called brilliant and amazing. Even think it's called a jackass. All the tests all the time when he runs out on the court and it does all that stuff hit off the court.

Speaker 3:          11:12          You Jackass for always saying like, you know, Mark Cuban is a business genius and you know, no, yes, but he is. He's undeniably is. But he does, he doesn't get good reviews. That guy gets trashed on the time in order to answer is you guys have bad experiences with men while you're dating and they get to be dicks and bang you and then leave and you never quite are able to wash that off. So I think that you guys then look at us in a certain way. I'm able to separate my experiences from dating Dick's to dealing with Dixon day to day life. I am not so simple minded and like one dimensional that me one time and now they're all deck like you fucking kidding me. But there was a period in your life, you can't tell me that you didn't get a little petty.

Speaker 3:          11:56          I did. I actually never did. I did all those guys that dumped me. No, I did not necessarily have the track record with men, but I didn't write you all off because of that. I still was looking for love. So what I'm saying is as far as like the most hardcore fucking thing I've ever seen as far as just spinning in your head around like Holy Shit is the fact that Bruce Jenner, unlike that other woman, why don't even know who the fuck that is. Who's on Time magazine is that this guy you're going to send my whole life. I've known this guy from like second grade on, he wanted the catalog. He was on the Wheaties box. He was on chips. He got a nose job and then he disappeared and then he came back on the Kardashians and he was walking around in the background.

Speaker 3:          12:51          I remember law had had this great fucking bit. Yes. It's been like, what the, why are you sitting there getting bitch said you got to fucking gold medal for the catalog. They got you walking around in the background. You know, like you know, I used to be walking around with that medal around your neck or something. Right to then, I remember when when Tmz was chasing around saying that he was having a sex sex change, I was like, oh my God, leave the guy alone. You know, he doesn't like his face and out and I dunno he's, he's doing whatever the fuck he's doing it and then it turned out they were right and now when he comes out, call me Caitlyn. I mean this is the thing like, because what, I don't know, I said this is going to be a lot of people that get in trouble as they're trying to fucking process this for the first time.

Speaker 3:          13:36          This is their first time experience and I think you want to allow people to have that, that first dumb thing that comes out of their mouth not understanding and being like, what? But everybody's going to jump on him and someone, someone will lose their career to sit down and watch this guy like you wanted to be this guy, you wanted to be Bruce Jenner. I wanted my hair parted down the middle and fed it to the side. I wanted to be a motorcycle cop. I wanted to do all of that shit. And then all of a sudden I remember reading articles about him, like his fucking life, you know, he's in between, you know, girlfriends or whatever. And uh, they went to his house and he had some Porsche target. I still remember this in Sports Cilia, porch target in the garage that he walked by and he ran his fingers along.

Speaker 3:          14:18          He had a little bit of dust on it. I'm like, this guy, he's so, this shit that he just has a leftover Porsche. I mean, who was like a guy's guy that then boom, go the other, that 180, the other other fucking way. I think people should be allowed to be honest with it. I just feel like the cruelty is, is what's unnecessary. No, no, no. Not Cruelty. But you want to be able to say like, Bruce, what the, sorry, Kate lucked up. Wow. Wait a minute. Leyla and I sit down for a Sunday. We're talking governments in one of his sons from his other marriages, like Brandon or something. And she lifted up her dress. So, uh, his other new boobs and he goes, Whoa, I'm still your son. Cause it's like, Whoa, wait, just give me a second. And then another one of his foot, he was snow show his balls of course.

Speaker 3:          15:11          What you came from John? Of course. No, of course. It was definitely I that would be very uh, uh, weird. No, but that's always been my theory, but, and the girls who get fake boobs, we'll show them to you like they got their nails done cause it's an insecurity thing. So it'd be like saying I have two friends was amazing boob jobs. I never would have known there. So the Soca, you gotta he gotta pay for it. You know what I'm saying? He can't go out in there and get discount plastic. Danny's when you're getting a boob job, like whatever, the facial reconstruction that Caitlin has had is a fucking amazing. Now of course she's still is a handsome woman, but like it really, it looks good. And those, those, those times, she's still a handsome woman. Did you mean that she started off as a handsome guy?

Speaker 3:          15:56          No, there were some women that are like handsome. This whole thing that I'm saying right now, this whole thing that I just said, what do you mean like that? The assist the handsome guy or like the woman right now, you know what this, this is, this whole fucking scenario is why I never watched lost what is why I never watched lost. How did you come the dream state? Is there a fucking monster down here? What's going on? And then now you're jumping back and forth on either side. It's like he's playing tennis against himself right now. It's kind of like your add brain actually. Oh, is it? It's kind of like bringing around, look, I'm on vacation in front of a good size.

Speaker 3:          16:35          Um, but you know what else? Um, uh, one of his kids, her kids to see even I'm slipping with the Pronoun. You homophobe, transgendered, hater, what's your career? We need to, and it, uh, my career is lagging around with you and France on Twitter gave me shit. Anybody who starts at tweet with the word, maybe I'm done with, maybe don't, blah, blah, blah. Oh No. I was saying one of Caitlin's. Dot. I son said I'm, I'm, I'm hoping, I think or something like that. Katelyn will be a better parent than Bruce was. No, I mean he's been, I mean she's been pretty open and add it. And then if Katelyn Stone's crying and be like, Kayla, I wasn't talking to you talking about no by, uh, by all accounts, especially his, his first set of kids, he wasn't there. They were, Bruce wasn't there for them cause he was a fucking man.

Speaker 3:          17:38          And now that, now that now that Bruce has become Caitlyn, you think feminine and he won the gold medal, Caitlin still has to prove herself. She hasn't won shit. Yes, she's won all of our hearts. Um, all right, well but you know something else then there's also the then falling all over yourself. There's, there's the ignorant being mean about it. Then also the going the other way where you fall all over yourself and if Caitlyn's being a cunt, you can't call her. Cause she used to be Bruce, which is bullshit. Well, I guess Bruce was an asshole because Bruce really wanted to be Kaitlin and it was struggling and was taking it out on other people and was literally running away. I think Katelyn, who's going to be the biggest gossipy, he's going to go to brunch and just talk shit about everybody in her immediate circle.

Speaker 3:          18:35          I'm pretty excited to see how this unfolds. Actually, it's, it's pretty a major. Are you going to watch the her show? No, I never watched the Kardashians. Oh, that's true. I hate those fucking shows. Yeah, that makes sense. And to be honest with you, I would have, I'll just sort of walk by the TV and occasionally glance over. I need to ease my way into, you are my soul there and I am done. I have the fucking right to do that. Yes you do. Yeah. When you make that big of a fucking change, Jesus Christ, I shaved my head. People like, what the, yeah, you've got to give people, you gotta have you gotta be courteous. It let people like fucking guy. Let me, uh, okay. Okay. You should have like five minute visits and then they increased the 10 and you just got to gradually like, I mean, you literally get like you killed off the other person.

Speaker 2:          19:33          Yeah.

Speaker 3:          19:33          You know what I mean? Pretty much. Yeah. Yeah. Like where are they?

Speaker 2:          19:37          Yup. Nolan.

Speaker 3:          19:39          Yeah. So then it, and then it's weird. It's like, well, I technically should be liking you. Right. But you're not the other person, but you still, you.

Speaker 2:          19:47          Hmm.

Speaker 3:          19:49          Do you think he did something like he sold his soul to the devil. He's like trying to beat the devil at his own game and that, that'll be just becoming like a woman at the end of his life so he could save his soul. And the devil's it, it's like, I don't know, like angel hot. Are you talking about a movie with Lisa Monet? Yeah, Mickey Rourke. We cipher. Um, anyways, I don't fucking know bill burns. Caitlyn Jenner. No, I didn't. I fucking, I'm getting my head around it because I'm, I should allow it to be allowed to do,

Speaker 2:          20:30          um, anyway.

Speaker 3:          20:38          Anyways.

Speaker 2:          20:39          MMM.

Speaker 3:          20:40          A lot of shit to say. Oh, you don't want to miss last night was the, uh, cause I couldn't find my fucking password. God knows I was awake. Was the first of the Stanley Cup playoffs.

Speaker 1:          20:48          And um, is it that time of the year again? All right. That time of day when you could say so. I'm sure we can find some errors. French pub, Irish French pub. They're going to have soccer or they're going to have rugby. Oh Zero Roland Garros highlights. Oh well listen. So I saw Tampa was up one to nothing when I fell asleep and I was like, wow, wouldn't that be really amazing if they won game one? Um, well wait, is it in Tampa? I think it's in Tampa. I'm trying to think of the highlights. I think Chicago had on their white jerseys. I can't remember. They won game one. Like what that would do to this series. Like immediately you got to think it's going to six or seven. Um, so anyway, so the rough one and nothing.

Speaker 2:          21:41          Okay.

Speaker 1:          21:42          And then am I excited that, you know, Chicago score too late. Goals to win the game. So I got all excited. I want to put on the highlights of Seiu scored. So I put on the highlights and it ended up depressing the hell out of me when I watched it because, uh, you know, to Tampa Bay lightning fans who have been, uh, just let you know as a Bruins Fan, I've been there against Chicago. It was the deciding game. Like we were trying to force a game seven and we were up by a goal. It's like a a minute nine left and they scored two goals in the final minute to not only beat us to win the Stanley Cup and celebrate on our ice and our building. So kind of took me back to that, but uh, what, uh, I don't, I can't remember who did what, but that first goal they had, um, that guy who stole the puck just poke checked it away.

Speaker 1:          22:31          It just, that just gives you the idea how fucking good those guys are at that level. You just poke checked away in two seconds later. It's in the back of the neck. And uh, just amazing. I hope Tampa wins game too, cause I really want to see a series and I'm hoping it's still going to go. Both the NBA and the NHL Finals will be for games and when we get back, and I'm obviously open for serious. Would you like out of Cleveland in Sacramento? Near Cleveland has Lebron James Sacramento's got a Steph curry who's forever chewing his mouthpiece.

Speaker 1:          23:03          Um, okay. Thank you. You don't watch. All right. Let me, uh, let me wrap this thing up. All right. You want me to get up because we're done talking about reality TV and Shimizu CBU play [inaudible] see, we'll play. Um, anyway. Uh, so I'm psyched to see that. I gotta get my password and uh, I think this is what I'm going to do. I'm going to fucking hang out here. I'm going to booze it up and then at night I'm going to come back and watch the NBA and the Stanley Cup finals. That wouldn't suck. Right. Um, so what else did I want to talk about? Oh fuck. I forgot to bring this up since, uh, two weeks ago when I was telling you guys to watch, I watched that Bollywood movie, that Res Return of Singham or single returns. I gotta tell you something. I saw the most bootleg fucking NBA tee shirt I've ever seen in my life is in that, in that movie.

Speaker 1:          24:09          And uh, the bad guys wearing it. Anybody from India, if you could please explain to me the context of this. It was a Chicago Bulls tee shirt, red tee shirt with the, uh, with the red bull mascot and above where it should have said bowls. It said chef, like c h e s like someone's going to cook you a meal. And I remember looking at that code. How to the chef, is that like a Hindu for fucking bull? I have no fucking idea. You know, and then I'm thinking of bowls. A male cow. And they don't eat cows over there or they're not supposed to with, some of them are, you know, so why would they say that? Is that like some punk rock shit? Like this guy is such a bad guy. He's saying he's going to eat the fucking bull. No, right. Fuck you. I can hear you laughing in India from here. All right. Just let me know what the hell that means if you don't mind. So, um, anyways, uh, I'm sorry guys. We don't have a fucking TV here. I don't know what's going on in the world. So I would have to just rip something here to give you your fucking half hour for the week.

Speaker 2:          25:23          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          25:24          I've never been more home sector when I watched fucking those nhls highlights.

Speaker 2:          25:29          Okay.

Speaker 1:          25:32          All right. Google news. God knows this is reputable, right? Where do we go here? Where do we go? Google news. Bam. All right. So you think six things to know about Rick Perry? I Dunno. One thing about it with a fucking see. So you think Texas got former Texas governor Rick Perry who launched this 2016 campaign on Thursday. Six things you may know about him.

Speaker 1:          26:02          Oh, he's from Texas. That means he's tough on crime. He doesn't like gay people and he thinks she ought to be able to smoke in public. That's what I'm guessing. There's three things I'm going to guess about a son of paint creek Perry's life until he attended college, revolved around the small hand scrabble community of pain. I don't give a fuck about that. He's a former Democrat pilot wings. He joined the famous corp of cadets at Texas a and m university to earn an Air Force commission upon his graduation. All right. I like them creating jobs, felony charges. You also skipped by the good stuff. Let's get to the juice here. Perry's attorneys, I've asked the Texas appeals court to dismiss charges, discharge, felony charges against him, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

Speaker 1:          26:51          What the fuck did he do sentence for drunk drive enough? I did that. A union member. He's a Republican who was a card carrying union member. All right, awesome. That's a good mix. Hey, I remember what I have. Somebody sent me to talk about. Did you guys see that article on the Red Cross raising all of that money, like $1 billion or something for, for aid and Haiti and they only, they said they were going to build all these houses and roads and get people electricity and all they've been able to accomplish is get make six houses and um, some people are blaming the uh, the lack of infrastructure and on Haiti or whatever. But I'm telling you right now, more and more of these ds.

Speaker 2:          27:37          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          27:38          These, uh, I guess charities are, are getting exposed for, I mean, I can't say that they're all, they're all bad. Um, sorry, I'm looking at this fucking thing up. But

Speaker 2:          27:53          Yeah,

Speaker 1:          27:53          Red Cross Haiti scandal. Let me look this up so maybe I can read it. So it's somewhat intelligent here. Where is it? Where is it? Red Cross misuse of funds for Haiti. Sparks protest. Sorry. All right, here we go. Yeah. 354 million raised 1.6 million spent and allocated. MMM. Haitian American organizer issued organizers issued a series of complaints and called for strict accountability early last week over the misuse of over one 11.6 billion in donated funds. Promise for post earthquake relief in Haiti. 11.6 billion. You could rebuild the whole fucking country, couldn't you? It's a little island. What does he hate? He shares a Dominican Republic is with Cuba and then Haiti's their own little island. Right? I Dunno Macy. I don't know anything about the covenant meal. Uh, whatever. So classic fucking thing. Hang on one second. Hang on, hang on him.

Speaker 2:          29:01          Okay.

Speaker 1:          29:02          Alright, I'm back. Sorry about that.

Speaker 1:          29:05          This dummy. Can somebody tell me like a charity that you just know? It seems like Saint Jude is the only one that I, Jimmy Fund. The Cam Nealy House. Oh, the only ones that I've seen that really just like the lion's share of the money. Yeah. For obvious expenses. You know, you've got to rent out a venue and that type of shit. All the Patrice O'Neal benefit. I can tell you without a doubt. What'd you guys do with Sunday? You found out? I was actually keeping all the fucking man, that would just be the end. It'd be end of everything. Me Stepping out of my Prius have a no comment. By the way, we're looking at the first Tuesday in March for the next one. Um, so anyways, one of the, somebody said all of the money the Red Cross has collected, uh,

Speaker 2:          29:57          yeah,

Speaker 1:          29:58          I know of only one location where they gave out plastic bottles of water while providing no shelter or any significant amount of food. I mean, these guys, they getting them and they're getting trashed here. Now please tell me, is this making national news? Is this anywhere on the news or are they not there? Because what ends up happening is the Red Cross,

Speaker 1:          30:22          you know, they advertise on television so they don't get to advertise for free. So those networks are making money off of the Red Cross and that sound networks make their money is through advertising. So there's an immediate conflict of interest where it's like, should we do this report? You know, these guys give us $1 million a year up to advertise. We're throwing $1 million out the fuck window. If we say that these fucking guys aren't doing the right thing. Um, so I dunno, I'm not in the state so I'm going to, if they're actually show him the same anyways, this whole fucking thing's just petering out. Um, all right, so four days end of this trip. I'm not going to lie to you already miss being home. Um, but I got that a sporting event coming up and going to the tennis game. So that's my, my big thing.

Speaker 1:          31:10          Other than that, I'm just over here sitting in cafes, boozing it up. Oh by no fucking way. If you ever come over here, which you should include, that negative content got mad at me for fucking bringing it up that I was over here. Like I'm supposed to lie when I'm supposed to be and if you're listening you're a Douche bag. Your tweet really depressed the hell out of me for like five seconds. Cause not because I give a fuck what you think. It's because when I was young and was not confident, it was an introvert. Someone like you could have fucked me out of becoming a comedian. All right? You need to work on yourself. And you know, it doesn't cost that much fucking money to come over here. He kept college kids come over here and backpack, just sleep in a fucking hostile. You want to come over, you can make it happen.

Speaker 1:          31:55          Lay off the booze, you know, make some sacrifices, you know, fucking asshole, making it seem like I bought Paris over here on his fucking seven day bender. So anyways, um, and if you have somebody like debt your life, you've got to get rid of them. Don't ever be afraid to literally just fire a friend, you know what I mean? Call them into your office and just say, listen, this isn't working out. And they'll be like, why? What are you talking about this? Because anytime I want to do anything with my life that's going to take me into a direction they want to go. You fucking pull it back the reins because you're a client. So you're right in my life. So anyways, so when you do come over here, everybody, if you choose to, um, you got to watch out for the fucking Gypsies bad.

Speaker 1:          32:44          These guys, these men and women are, they're so good at pickpocket and you can't even get mad at it. I'm a cab driver gave us the whole fucking breakdown. They actually there to the point now because everybody's on to them. Like don't Fret French police are run to, they actually, they show up dressed like tourists. They have cameras around their neck, socks pulled up too high, you know, just walking around like a bunch of fucking nerds like me. And they will literally walk up to you one bumps into the others in your fucking pockets before he, before you even know what's going on. And I know what you're saying, like, oh, that old trick, that old trick. You wait, you wait, you'll come over here and you'll be like, uh, you know, finish in a fucking meal. And UBS using while at the TCO, TCO, TCO, TCO. See, we'll play music check, right? Then I'll bring it over to you and you go to gold for your fucking wallet. And it's God.

Speaker 1:          33:45          You're like, well, I, I didn't, I didn't walk near anybody. I just fucking glided over here. I think I said hello to one press. I got you say a load on them and they got your fucking wallet. So you got to watch out. So I know a lot of you guys are thinking, where are they from? Where are these Gypsies from? That's the question I asked. We just travel around and not from anywhere. Um, should, I probably shouldn't say where they're from cause I'm sure there's plenty of decent people there. Uh, but it rhymes with Romania. So anyways, that's the Thursday afternoon. Just before Monday morning. Thursday. What is fine Thursday afternoon, Monday morning podcasts just before Friday. And other words, nobody's. Yeah. Yeah. Um, it was a classic kit from fucking back in the data and what they're going to play. Uh, anyways, I'm going to try to watch the, uh, gay more than the NBA finals tonight and that's it. Have a wonderful day. Uh, and go fuck yourself.

Speaker 2:          34:51          Yeah.

Speaker 4:          34:52          Oh, do I see the star light? No kisses

Speaker 3:          35:06          camera two. Hey Bill, uh, maybe you can help me out with this um, thing. Now I haven't read any of these things people. So, uh, bear with me here. Uh, this sounds ridiculous but hear me out. I met this girl a couple of weeks ago and I've been talking to her and hanging out with her nonstop.

Speaker 2:          35:21          Okay.

Speaker 3:          35:21          We is pretty

Speaker 2:          35:24          what?

Speaker 3:          35:25          I guess it's, she is pretty, she's pretty funny, intelligent and one of the most upfront and upfront and honest people I've ever met in my life. In fact, maybe a little too honest, cause she tells me every day how great, cute and

Speaker 1:          35:38          honest I am. And it's a little much sometimes. Anyways, we've been hitting it off like crazy. And on Saturday she spent the night and we hung out all day Sunday about nine, around 9:00 PM, we got on the topic of old jobs. Fuck is she a dancer? And she told me that a few years ago she worked in a pet store. Okay. I guess wrong. There was a hamster there that would bite her every day drawing blood and would attack coworkers and customers. Generally, the hamster was a crazy douche. One day her, her and a coworker decided they had to do something about this thing to put the hamster in a bag and smashed it against the wall. Whoa.

Speaker 5:          36:24          Okay.

Speaker 1:          36:25          What? Jesus Christ, what a fucking left turn that was. They put it in a bag and smashed it against the wall. Needless to say, I was shocked. The first thing I said was, holy shit lay. That's Kinda crazy. That makes

Speaker 1:          36:52          wait. That's the kind of crazy that makes a wife cut her husband's Dick off. I'm sorry dude. That was a hilarious line and I blew it. The first thing I said was, Holy Shit Lady. That's the kind of crazy that makes it wife cut her husband's Dick off. She said she still feels horrible about it and that she killed it that way because she couldn't think of any other way to make it quick, but Jeez, I mean, I never been in that situation, but it seems kind of crazy. Lol. This seems like something straight out of a Seinfeld episode, but I just keep thinking about it. Every time me and this chick's are are getting together. Should I just accept this is a crazy story or is this a sign that she has serious issues? Remember, this happened years ago and she seems absolutely sane. Otherwise, please help potential murder victim question mark through. Some of you guys are really fucking funny man. The way you guys write this shit. I, I you, but you've got to met. I haven't proved with my reading. I feel so bad that I butchered that God damn line. Um,

Speaker 5:          38:00          yeah.

Speaker 1:          38:01          Okay. Jesus Christ. What do you do with this one? This is fucked up on like so many different levels. Okay. Let's start with the first thing. The cruelty to animals.

Speaker 5:          38:13          Okay.

Speaker 1:          38:13          Okay. Not only cruelty to animals like I could what she did, I could do that to an aunt. I won't even do it to a spider. I could do it to a fucking mosquito.

Speaker 5:          38:25          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          38:25          That's what she basically treated a hamster like a fucking mosquito.

Speaker 5:          38:30          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          38:31          Now granted a hamster. Okay, let, let's try to be a little empathetic here. Empathetic. Let me try to put myself in her situation. If I was younger, 20 years younger and a hamster bit me every day at work and I met working at a fucking pet store, uh, what? I smashed it against the wall and a bag. No, I wouldn't. However,

Speaker 5:          38:55          yeah,

Speaker 1:          38:55          I love do something

Speaker 5:          38:57          to it.

Speaker 1:          39:05          I would do something. You know what I would do? I would take a ruler and if I would wait, I would wait till it was a fallen asleep and I would just write on it's fucking hamster ass and it woke up whenever the fuck it did. I would just take the ruler and I would pin it against the fucking cage. They just watch. You get all upset. I just, I would bully it. That's what basically what I would do. And I you liked that? You liked that you little fucking hamster, Huh? I wouldn't hurt it. I just keep it pinned there. I'm a frustrated, I would frustrate the living shit out of it. That's what I would do. I would do something like that, I that I think I would do that, but I would not smash it against the fucking wall. They put it in a bag. Now did, was it repeated strikes? Jesus Christ, you know, some of this shit kids used to do in my neighborhood. You know, I had a friend of mine, he's take his house cat and he'd put it in an empty Pellis Kelo case and he would fucking spin it over his head like someone, like it was at a Steelers game,

Speaker 1:          40:14          you know, that's what the fuck he would do. And then sometimes he'd put it in the dryer. They used to tell me these stories and I used to laugh my fucking ass off for some reason. I found it funny back then. Now I find it absolutely horrific. And uh, I would never do it, but if I had to do it to either a dog or a cat, I would definitely do it to a cat. But it'd have to be a real douche of a cat. All right, so we're getting off the subject here. So it's cruelty to animals and she works at a pet store. So that's bizarre because he figured if you work at a pet store, that means you either you love animals or you, you like I had a low level deal pot. You, you've, you're dealing weed on a low level, you know what I mean? You're that guy. You like the burnout, Matthew mcconaughey. At least that's how they used to be. But then there's the other option that serial killers, you know, they start off with small animals. You know, they watch a ton of porn and they start torturing small animals and then they gradually work their way up, uh, you know,

Speaker 1:          41:20          to a fucking human being. So yeah, you could possibly, you could possibly be dealing with that right now. Then also, you know, you're looking at it like this is, that's the mother. Your children put a hamster

Speaker 5:          41:34          in a fucking, I could see if it was fucking 1911 rather than 2011. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          41:41          People back then, they kill an animal. They didn't give a fuck.

Speaker 1:          41:45          They just walk out. What do you guys want for dinner? Good. It's has some goose in the fucking mom would walk out. They grabbed the goose by the neck and then they fucking act like they were trying to start up a model t ah, fucking body Susan. They've just break its neck nice and quick. Um, and then they pluck it, Nick Cook it and that was it. And that was, that was dinner 1911. Did you like that little piece, piece of history? Uh, I don't, dude, I don't know what to tell you. This is like, um, that's really fucking insane and at the very least, um, if you get into a fight with her, she's at the very least, I think she's going to throw something at you. She may be one of those. I have no idea. Dude. How hot is this girl? I think I, some of these people I need like a picture to see if it's like worth it. You guys seem to be connecting on like a personality level, but I really got to tell you,

Speaker 5:          42:45          you know,

Speaker 1:          42:47          that's just like something Roger Clemens would do. I could picture him doing that. You know, he is at posy, posy from the fucking dirty dozen sort of vibe about them.

Speaker 4:          42:58          Hugs forward to the please come back to come to me last be sweethearts.

Speaker 1:          43:20          Did you want, shall we? Um, so anyways, this is why I've been cooped up in Cincinnati the entire fucking weekend is because, uh, this is what I've learned about Cincinnati. Evidently they have what's known as good downtown and bad downtown. But as far as I can tell, it's all fucked up because I'm supposed to be in good downtown. And um, I've been walking around this, you know, I've, I've lived in cities and I performed in cities enough for, I know what the fucking red flags are when it means, hey bill, why don't you go back to your hotel room or at the very least, take your watch off. Put it in your pocket. I love that. That's the classic White Guy, suburban Wolf. I know. I'll take it off and put it in my pocket.

Speaker 1:          44:12          What exactly does that do? You know, other than maybe save you from getting a broken arm, you know that somebody is just ripping your pocket off your jeans. So this is the deal. I walk out. This is, these are the red flags. I walk out of my hotel the first block, I see a check cashing place. All right? This is for tourists. The people, if you see a check cashing place a hail a cab and get the fuck out of that neighborhood, or at the very least stop the direction you're walking in and going the other direction. All right. Which is what I did. I was like, well, you know, I don't think I want to get food down this way. Let me go this other way. So I start walking up the street a little bit more and what do I see on the right hand side of the street?

Speaker 1:          44:54          I see a hat store, a store that sells nothing but hats and I don't mean like Lids, baseball hats. Oh, those Brian Johnson, I'm a fan of ACDC, had some talking like Venus fly trap fucking bitch. Where's my money hats? And right next to it they had a store that sold the suits that went with those bitch, where's my money hats? So I'm like, all right, I'm in a pimp, Allie. All right. I am not a fucking pimp. I don't have any bitches. Let me get the fuck out of there. But then I see an oasis. I see Walgreens. I'm like, okay, that's a chain. All right, it's a corporate chain. I will walk in there and I will regroup and I'll ask somebody in there with the fid Rutgers's you know, so I walk in there and I go in there and once again I see another red flag.

Speaker 1:          45:44          The lotion, lotion people was locked in a glass cabinet. All right. 18 years on the road. I have never fucking seen that. How much does lotion cost people? It doesn't cost that fucking munch. All right. You have to lock it up like it's fucking razor blades, which I still don't think that they should cost that fucking much. Razor blades, they lock up because they just, they make them seem like these, they're these diamonds and they're very rare. So for some reason they are 40 bucks for eight of them and everybody knows it's bullshit. So they're going to steal them. But this is lotion. Every fucking drug still you go into, you know the shampoos out in the ocean, out in the ocean, out in the open. The lotion is my brain, always three words ahead of where the fuck I'm going to say you'd like to add open and lotion, you get ocean.

Speaker 1:          46:39          Um, yeah. So I was like, all right, what the fuck? And then I walked out and I saw, uh, I saw a black dude under the age of 35 with a Jheri curl. And right there, that was it. I was like, I'm done. I'm going back to my fucking hotel because, oh no. And then the last thing was all decent, respectable. A Brady bunch looking white people and Huxtable look and black people all vacated the city at five Oh one leaving depression era looking white people, you know, do you guys ever see peewee's big adventure and he's on that train with that Guy Jimmy cracked corn and I don't care. That's what all the fucking white guys look like. And the black guys all look like Pac man Jones. Actually they didn't know it was just one guy. One of my shows he did, he had the Paul Wall Grill in his mouth. And uh, you know, I dunno. So I've just been sitting here ordering room service my entire fucking weekend reading about Cincinnati

Speaker 1:          47:52          anyways, so I was so bored this week and I was just like, ah, I'm going into a negative funk here. I have got to do something positive. So I actually went up and I go, you know, after I started reading about Cincinnati, I was like, maybe I'll go to a museum. So the closest museum was this museum about the underground railroad, the underground, not like that. That's what the, uh, Swedes called. They're a call the subway, the underground in England, they call it the tube. You know, look at make fucking world traveler. I know how to say grilled cheese in five different languages. Um, uh, God, my brain's so fucking tired. Come on belts. You can make it, you can make it. Here we go. What am I talking about here? So I go, all right, go to the underground railroad and I use, usually I don't like going to shit like that.

Speaker 1:          48:38          Okay. I understand how evil white people are. And, uh, I've seen enough shit in my lifetime that I really don't want to be reminded. I go on Youtube, I see all the shit that people, right, it's fucking, you know, it's depressing, but I'm figuring this is the underground railroad. There's a happy ending after this shit, right? It starts off with the slavery, but then there's freedom, right? And there's going to be a big, you know, we are the world thing at the end, you know. So I walk in there and they gave me this little radio and I go, all right, and I go, it's one of these museums. We start at the top and then you wind your way all the way down. And I walked in there and it was fucking horrific. It was horrific. Just see, and they stacked them up like fucking wood in these God damn ships.

Speaker 1:          49:25          Now people's families getting separated. And it was just in every fucking picture. Just had some black dude, a woman just getting the shit kicked out of him and then some evil looking white guy. And, uh, I quickly realized that was one of the only white people in there. So now I'm looking at black people and I'm feeling like an asshole. Like Ah, yeah. Hey, uh, yeah, sorry about that. I kinda got a little out of control. It wasn't only me, it was my ancestors and I just want to get the fuck out of there. Right. So, oh, it was, it was brutal. I can only, I can only be in there for like half, like half hour, 40 minutes. And I was like, I already know this shit. I know this shit. I already know this shit's fucking, it was horrible. It was fucking horrible. And I just basically fast walked down like five flights of stairs to get, it wasn't even stairs. It was like a round thing, you know, I should have just been gone, I'm sorry. All the way down. Right. And then when I fucking went to leave, this is the best part. I handed my radio and I'm so full of white guilt at that point then I'm to be friendly as possible. Then when I hand it to the lady, the lady behind the counter, this black woman, she goes, she goes, how did you enjoy the museum? And I was so trying to say something positive. I went to big, I went, it was great.

Speaker 1:          50:43          I felt like an asshole. I sounded like I enjoyed it too much and I want to be like, great, like, like informative. Great. You know, not great. Like, you know, woo slavery, slavery on two on two, ready break. Um, AH, yeah. Fuck. It was brutal. It was brutal. So I dunno, that's it.

Speaker 4:          51:10          Yeah,

Speaker 5:          51:17          no.
