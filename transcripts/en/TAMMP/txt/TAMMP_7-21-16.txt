Speaker 1:          00:00:01       Hey, what's going on? It's bill burn his time for the Thursday afternoon. Just before Friday, Monday morning podcast and

Speaker 1:          00:00:10       just checking it on Ya. I'm checking in on you because I give a fuck. Right. I care about you. Oh, who's the freckled content gives a fuck. I do. Um, how's your week going? Everything going good with you. I hope it is. Um, oh freckles. The pasty old fucking man. 48 years old. My back feels better than it has since that since I don't know when, um, just been going to the chiropractor and get in this fucking the shit beat out of me in a massage. This is finally a, I dunno, it's fucking great. I guess my spine was compressed and twisted that for, for decades. So, you know, after having professionals beat the shit out of me for like weekly for like the last since May, I guess. Um, I dunno. I think I finally, I undid, they undid it or whatever. But now, like when I go to stretch, when I go to a, you know, you know the whole thing, you lay on your back and this young people won't know this because they just get up off the couch and start running.

Speaker 1:          00:01:19       They're fine because they're young, but old people, you know that she lay on the floor, right? You get down on the floor, right? You make that noise and you keep going down and getting up. It's the same noise. Ah, right. You get down on the fucking ground and then you bring one of your knees up to your chest, right? And then you bring it over to one side and then you have your arms sticking up. You know, like almost like you're doing like some sort of old timey football move right. High stepping over somebody. But when I do that on the ground now, I just bring that over in my back. Just cracks from the lower back to about three quarters of the way up. And that never used to, I wouldn't crack at all. It was just all fucking jammed in there. And um, I feel good man.

Speaker 1:          00:02:01       I've been working out, I won't spend eating like a fucking animal though. Went to a barbecue Sunday, so that's all she wrote with that. Right. And I did a show, so ate barbecue and then I also fucking eight in a comedy club, Green Room. And I was working down there and how most at the, uh, the comedy and Magic Club and um, which is really fucking cool to go down there now because whenever I look at the pier, I'm like, that's the thing I fly over. Right? But you know, as I'm coming down, you know, there's the, the hormone [inaudible] beach pier and then Manhattan Beach Pier. When you get to that one, you gotta be down around like, you know, like 300 feet. And that's when you call lax and say, Hey, I want to fucking skedaddles underneath the fucking jets there. Right. And I never knew what any of that shit.

Speaker 1:          00:02:45       I didn't have a new way. The beaches where this redheaded cutting, where the beaches are. The only reason why I know where the beaches are is so I know how to drive in the opposite direction. I fucking hate the beach. I fucking, oh my God, I hate the beach. I love the fucking beautiful brown people that go there, you know, 10 and themselves up. God bless you. I sit there like the boy in the bubble, you know, and one of those Ford Astros with the slide and fucking door with the AC on looking out like the boy in the bubble. Right? Um, I, I fucking hate it. I get there. It's hot as fuck. It's boring. I'm terrified to go in the ocean. I'm not fucking going in there. It's Goddamn sea monsters and they're going to fucking grab you. You know what? A bunch of 80, we're kind of a fucking moron.

Speaker 1:          00:03:40       I just, I'll never get over there at the fact that people just swim in the fucking ocean. And Ella was a shark attack today. Yeah. You know, it's funny. Somebody goes to the fucking zoo and they, they crawl into the fucking cage and he'd get attacked. Everybody's general consensus. Consensus is yes, it's a tragedy. And what'd you think was going to happen? You know, you go to the beach and you go into the fucking ocean, everybody acts like it's a big city. Like it's a big surprise. How did that happen? I can't believe it. You went into an unnatural environment, right? And it's something where there was a bunch of shit there that could kill you in something. Did or took a chunk out of you, took a fucking bite Audi, if you know when you've come stumbling out of there. I don't know why.

Speaker 1:          00:04:25       It just makes me think of an unfinished, the Gar when somebody gets bit right. You know what? I went to this fucking party, right? And I brought in Sony for my birthday, had got me this really incredible box of cigars. So I, uh, I immediately call all my friends because, you know, or whatever. It's like, because I'm not going to smoke all 10 of these fucking things. First of all, that's not what cigar smoking. It's about. It's a social thing, right? And secondly, I don't want to smoke all of them because I'm trying to keep the habit at bay. All right. Special occasions once to twice a month. Right? So I brought it over there and there was a bunch of hover and [inaudible] who all showed up. Everybody acting like they're fucking cigar smokers and some handing them out to these people, I don't fucking know.

Speaker 1:          00:05:11       And I turned my back and like 15 minutes later, like three of them had been stomped out. They like, they weren't even halfway done fucking idiots anyway. So then I just, I figured that's, yeah, you get bit by a shark. You know, he'd come in, it takes like, you know, the bottom 30 you off and you come out like a, like a fucking unfinished. The gar. No, I don't fucking know. It made sense to me visually. That's what I thought of. They're not all going to beat Jess. Relax. This podcast doesn't even count. This is me just checking in on you. Oh, Billy back brace. Huh? I took it off like fucking Forrest Gump. I actually feel like I could run, the only downside to my back feeling as great as it does right now is I have to fight myself from doing something really stupid.

Speaker 1:          00:06:02       Um, but uh, but has always, I was psyched. I didn't have to use any drugs. I stayed away from all of that shit. And it reminded me of that guy when I used to watch that doc, the doctor drew show, the celebrity Rehab, and there was that guy from taxi who since passed away and he kind of got hooked on painkillers and shit. He's always bitch about his back. And a, I remember I had, for whatever reason, I was just thinking about that. Go, man, I wish that guy went to a fucking chiropractor, Mizzou. So instead of going down the fucking painkiller route, I don't know. Who knows? He might have fucking done heroin first. He might have fucked up his back nod off on heroin, although they tend to stand pretty upright there, but he keeps it back straight and then their legs bent.

Speaker 1:          00:06:44       I don't know. But as always, I don't know what the fuck's going on. Um, yeah. So Monday night, Sunday night, sorry, I went to, uh, went to the comedy Magic Club, uh, worked. And that's not an easy road. It's not an easy room to do. Well, and as those people have seen a ton of fucking comedy, you know, Jay Leno goes down there every Sunday so they used to seeing the top notch shit. So you know, if you go down there and you have fast that you've got a bomb. So it had, I had a good set. Fortunately I had something in the middle of my set though I was, I was leaning on the mic stand and they had, and I had my, my arm sorta like instead of leaning on to how I usually do, I had my arm up and something was like pushing into my elbow.

Speaker 1:          00:07:23       And when my hand was like that, I went to close my make a fist and like my middle, my index and my fucking bring finger wouldn't close. It was like in slow motion really freaked me out. I don't know what the Hell I did, but what I'm basically telling you, people's, I'm falling apart. Um, but my back feels good. So anyways, so that was the first night of me and like an asshole. But I still work out every day fucking crushing the elliptical. I give it back at night, a little bit fucking drink here are fucking cheese stick, whatever the fuck I have. Right? But uh, then Monday last second, a buddy of mine called me up and said, hey, sting and Peter Gabriel a playing at the fucking Hollywood bull, right? So I said, you know what, I bet Vinnie call the UDAs playing drums.

Speaker 1:          00:08:11       I got to go see that. That's like a bucket list. He's one of my favorite drummers of all fucking time. And he's one of those guys who just keeps getting better. He's an absolute monster. I mean, the guy's like pushing 60 years old and he could still like blow away young drummers in the teens. You know what I mean? A lot of young drummers just think, you know, all the young guys are the shit and they're all fucking flashy. And then as guys get older, you know, they stopped practicing or whatever. He's one of the few fucking guys, there was no dropoff. He just kept getting better and better and better and better. So I say, fuck this, right? So I called up somebody, you know, who was in the know and I was like, Hey, is Vinny playing tonight? And they were like, they got back to me and I was like, fuck, that was the, that was the game right there.

Speaker 1:          00:08:55       I was like, I gotta go fucking see it, right? So I go on the, uh, the hub of the stub there, the old stub hub, and just pay through the fucking nose, get as close as I can. So now I'm all fucking excited. I'm all down low, right? And I'm fucking going, oh my God. You look at, they've got to drum kits up there. I'm guessing Peter Gabriel's going to open. Do is set, then stings going to do with fucking set. And then, uh, in the end they're going to come out and sing fucking Hava, Nagila, whatever. They're gonna do some sort of encore together, right? The fucking show starts. Okay. And there was so many fucking people on stage. I didn't know what was going on. And Peter Gabriel all of a sudden is like, yeah, you guys like right in front of us. He sings one of his fucking, I dunno, world music songs.

Speaker 1:          00:09:44       It was amazing. And his voice sounded fucking incredible. And I'm like, okay, the Peter Gabriel and his giant band here, this giant ass fucking band, but two drummers and shit is, is going to fucking open and then stinks going to come out and, and get to see Vinny, right? He finishes the first fucking song. He walks offstage and then all of a sudden sting just walks out. Everybody's like, what the fuck? Right? And he starts playing the AFI. Amba you right. He starts singing that song and I'm like, wait a minute, wait a fucks Vinny. I realize he's been playing the whole fucking time. He's just behind these, this fight. I don't the fuck it was somebody amps or some shit. So I could see was like the top of his head. But there was like video screens and stuff. So of course I was standing on my tiptoes to watch it, but what killed me about his playing is, uh, you know, every great musician has a voice, right?

Speaker 1:          00:10:36       I know this is like hacky to say that, but that fucking guy, the bell of his ride cymbal and when he plays the cross stick on his snare, it's just undeniable. You're like, that's fucking Vinny [inaudible]. And the fact that I would, he was making that noise that close to me and I was immediately hearing it and just all the Times that I've listened to, uh, all the music that he's made with staying in everybody else, the fact that they were actually reproducing it live right there, it was fucking nuts to me. You know, like their plan, this, the songs for us, this is fucking incredible, right? So then the consequences and they just keep flip flopping back and forth. So stink finished his fucking song. And then Peter Gabriel came back out, but staying stayed in fucking played bass on Peter's shit. And then he, they just kept going back and forth.

Speaker 1:          00:11:21       Then occasionally Peter did too. And then staying do a couple, only sting would walk off and Peter would do his thing and then vice versa, whatever, and filing in the middle of it. Um, oh, maybe towards the beginning. And I can't, they, they talked to the crowd a couple times and they basically said that they were just that a, they both had bands and they're kind of competing with each other band. And Peter Gabriel's band was the red band and strings was the blue band. And then I, then I finally noticed cell one drummer's got red, the other Vinnie's playing on blue drums. And I, you know, the way he told the story, they would just, you know, having battle of the bands and they were like, why don't we fucking go on tour? All I can say is, it was an incredible night. They played like all the fucking hits.

Speaker 1:          00:12:01       Peter Gabriel played big time sledgehammer of shocked, a monkey, a red rain, uh, staying played, fucking, uh, sending out. And it's so as a bunch of shit off. 10 Summers tails, uh, some shit off a sole cages. It was some police stuff. It was fucking amazing. It was fucking amazing. And, uh, you know, definitely a bucket list night. But of course I was in the crowd and at the Hollywood bowl, the either drink wine, which just gives me a brutal hangover oil. They had these giant fucking beers. Um, which I gotta be honest with just does nothing to me. It's just this, it's like, it's like somebody just handed a job here, why don't you drink this? Like, yeah, fuck. And I get it. I get really nothing out of it.

Speaker 1:          00:12:50       It's why I like Whiskey, you know, it gives you the right there Fred, and it's just a couple of swallows. Um, but anyways, Jesus Christ, the level of musicianship, the backup singers, one in particular was just, they kept, you know, given her solos and stuff, she was incredible. Um, got to watch stink, played bass, got to watch them up close. And the weird way he kind of comes from the side rather than might've. Bass players are kind of have their hand up top rest of their thumb on the low e or whatever the fuck that string is. And he's, he looks like he's coming at it from the side, like a fucking crab. It was really interesting. But uh, anyways, it was like some of the best musicians you ever going to see. So that's what I did Monday. And uh, then Tuesday we came in, we did the Polish up after the table read of episode 10 and we recorded episode 10, and that's it.

Speaker 1:          00:13:39       Oh, fucking Billy red faces on fucking a summer vacation here. Then I got a nice, um, I don't know where I got, I got about nine days before I go off to the European tour and I'm going to work out like a madman still, you know, have a couple, two, three drinks, whatever. It work hard, play hard. What are you gonna do? And I plan to have a nice, um, I want to have a healthy fucking tour over there. You know, my wife isn't going on this run. She's going to meet me over there afterwards, when to take a few days to hang out. But uh, during the whole run, it's a thrash. It's like a different city every fucking night. So it's kind of boring and pointless. You're really just saying to the person who isn't doing shows like, Hey, do you want to, uh, do you want to go over to Europe and like pack and unpack every fucking day? And they're like, yeah, no, I don't in barely see anything.

Speaker 1:          00:14:36       That's what I'm offering you. So what I want to do, the first died, I'm working with Joe to Rosa in Dublin on one of the shows. It's an earlier show, which is odd to me, but whatever. It's not my fucking deal. Right? So that night's a wash. I mean, we're going to get shit faced. Um, then the next night I'm in Belfast and I got to drive up and drive back so that night I'll fucking take it easy. The Irish people bitching. I already asked, stop being a pussy drink every night. I can't do it cause I got to make sure I have good shows. And then I got Gallway. But a chill for that, that London chill for the first night. Second night I'm going to maybe, you know, knock a few back and then I go to Scotland, I believe. And, uh, two nights stair. I'll just fucking chill. And then the third night, you know, that's going to be hard because it's, it's the whole fucking, the festivals going on over there. Somebody, me being a ton of Comedians, that might be a rough one. And then Jeremy, I don't gotta worry about Shit. Who's kidding? Who? I got to go out and have some beers that you, okay. It's going to get a little rough and once I get around Scotland, who's kidding who but, but the, the first half of it. Aw, that first half I'm going to be healthy. Um, does Amsterdam in there?

Speaker 1:          00:15:48       All right. You know what? This whole thing just went off the rails. Okay. For the first few nights in Ireland, I think it's going to be okay one night in London. Other than that, yeah, it might be a little rough, but if I can eat well,

Speaker 2:          00:15:57       yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:15:58       The problem is when you go over to Europe though, there's just this, just fuck it. There's no treadmills. They, these people just don't work out. It's weird. They're not like necessarily fat, but they're not in shape either. They just sort of, people mean, you know what I mean? Like, yeah, those are arms, you know? Yeah. They're connected to your torso. They got like, I think ellipticals are illegal in England. I don't know what the fuck it is. Everybody's so jammed in there and that little island, um, I'm fucking with you. Obviously they have gyms over there, so I'm going to try to hit treadmills and shit as much as I can. And, uh, I already know how I'm going to open my set when I'm over there, you know. Um,

Speaker 1:          00:16:44       it's, it's going to be, it's going to be a great fucking time. I can't wait to do it. And I'm so site that we got the first big chunk of work done on a, on f is for family. I feel I can, could finally fucking, uh, can finally fucking chill out and coming up this week, by the way, next Monday night is the second, uh, the two year anniversary of the goddamn comedy jam and a, they're going to have it at the rock seat down on sunset boulevard. And rumor has it that I'm, I might be down there. I'm going to be down there for that show. It's next Monday night if you are in the area and uh, I'm going to be busting out the fucking, I'm going to bust out the fucking green spark a Ludwig Kit. I'm going to bring it down there for that. And I bought it two years ago. I've never played it. I got this 71 Ludwig, it's fucking gorgeous. And right as I got it, I had it all set up and everything. We got what we had the water damage on the house. Fortunately thank Christ it didn't come down in the room where the drums were. So immediately went out and I got drunk cases and I put the fucking things away. And then, um,

Speaker 1:          00:17:56       you know, that was a year getting the house fixed and they stayed in cases and then the next year my truck, shit, the bed I had to get the engine rebuilt because it was going to do is put them in the cases and take them over to a rehearsal space. I was never able to do that at a, that my truck was better. And then I started writing on f is for family. So and just like that fucking two years goes by. So I busted them out.

Speaker 1:          00:18:17       71 Ludwig kick, I got the fucking Pisces symbols, that whole bottom set up, the 15 inch high hat, the 24 inch ride, complete fucking overkill. And I'm going to play a couple songs. I actually sat down and played drums today for the first time since like March, I played like a drum kit, you know, other than a cup that I think I took two lessons. But that's, you know, different than sitting down and playing. And I'll tell you right now, I fucking inside, oh Jesus, oh, sorry. Just blew out the uh, you're saying, oh my God, that was fucking terrible. Terrible. I better get my shit together by Monday night. Or I'm just going to look like a dish with a really nice kid who can't fucking play. Um, but I'm really looking forward to doing that. And I'll let me do a little, still read here.

Speaker 3:          00:20:26       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:20:26       ziprecruiter.com/ [inaudible] all right, there you go. Sorry about that. I fucking thought I had the levels down. I guess when you scream zip recruiter, it's bound to go off the rails after a while. Um, all right. So what else did I want to talk about? Anything? Um, somebody said that the New York Times did this article and for the love of God, I can't, it they did it. And talking about the legalization of pot and was saying in states where weed is become illegal, dep, uh, prescriptions have gone down drastically, obviously for pain, anxiety and all of that other stuff. And it's really starting to become the wonder drug man that all the hippies always said. And I always fucking was like, no, booze is legal, blah, blah, blah. And now it's really looking at like, booze does way more fucking damaged. Oh. But it's so delicious. Does way more damage than we does. So, according to this New York Times article, according to this person who said it was in New York Times article, um, that the pharmaceutical lobbyists are now going after legalized marijuana in every state and then they're going to try and start trying to fucking, you know, basically go, oh my God, it's the devil in Blahblahblahblahblah and get people to stop using it and have all this shit about side effects it, but they'll start showing commercials and all that. But I got to tell you, um,

Speaker 1:          00:21:51       the fact that this is the pro ball, maybe they won't, I was gonna say the problem that they're going to have is now that the cat's out of the bag, okay. In the states are making so much money in tax revenue, right? Like this, this whole thing going on at Denver, because it's legal at a state level, but not at a federal level. You don't pay federal income tax and it's this weird fucking thing. So nobody knows. Oh, I know banks won't accept the money,

Speaker 1:          00:22:20       you know, cause the banks, federal banks or whatever, can't accept the money or whatever. So what these, these people who grow the wheat are doing and they're just buying up land. So in Colorado, from what I heard, once again, I never read, I, I, I listened to people and whatever they say to me, I just considered it as, as a fact, right? It's so much easier than doing research. And you know what's great about it? If you fuck up, it makes other people feel smart, you know, nothing, nothing structure Rigo like correcting another human being. That's a human being. That thing can speak. It could drive a car. Maybe you can fly a plane to be right. I mean, anybody can be right when there's a dog, you know, there's a fucking dog in the room that doesn't do anything for you, you know? But if it's another fucking Parson right, he's got a thumb and shit and getting like hold a hammer.

Speaker 1:          00:23:12       If you're fucking Rad, that just, it's the greatest. I actually, ah, that was, it was actually 1897 yes. 1890 set Spanish American war. Anytime you get to do that and then you get to watch them be all fucking mad. Like when I was talking about George Bush, I thought everybody was making fun of them cause he deep, he didn't dance well. I didn't realize it was some memorial service for, you know, fallen officers or, or, uh, an officer in particular. And I didn't, I didn't look, I just watched the fucking video. Oh. And it just rolled in, you know, everybody, oh, let's, let's, let's fucking correct old Billy red beard. You know, everybody had a great fucking time doing that. Um, but I'm off the rails here. Okay. I still have to say, you know, you know, as much as that was inappropriate, which was completely inappropriate, obviously, it was fun to see him, you know, it was fun to see that he's enjoying his retirement.

Speaker 1:          00:24:06       It's like when you see Letterman, he let the beard go out. He got rid of the fucking two page. It doesn't, it doesn't give a shit. And when you look at him, a lot of people were saying, you know, maybe George was a little drunk. And, uh, you know what? Good for him, good for that fucking guy because that fucking guy, he held it together for eight goddamn years. You know, granted he gave a speech. The way I read advertising, granted we winded and into wire rack because there was weapons of mass destruction and we never fucking found Eddie. I love all that fucking story goes away. But if you make fun of fat people as a comedian, all of a sudden you get in trouble. And was like, what about this fucking guy? This guy here was playing fucking patty cake, Patty cake bakers man at a fucking funeral.

Speaker 1:          00:24:49       Good Lord. That guy is like, he's like you when you talk about failing upwards, I think you know something. There's something about that guy. He's just smart enough to know that he's not qualified. And I think that that's why he drinks. I think that's why it's got to hate that fucking vibe. He just, he, he's kind of like Rodney, like he does everything but tugs on his collar. Like it'll tell you it's a rough one, you know? Um, I dunno. We'll see. We'll see. What the fuck happens. But what was I talking about? Oh yeah. In New York Times they were saying that, you know, that these pharmaceutical lobbyists, you know, we're, we're going to be trying to, you know, fight back to win back some of their money, capitalistic society here. Right. What do you do? Somebody taking India, you're cutting India territory. What he had done. Yeah. You go on the offensive, you start making up shit about him. You lie, you know, that's what you do. So, um, I was going to say now that the cat is out of the bag legally with weed, um, and I think it's going to be really hard. I was going to say, because not only is it appearing to have all these positive effects medically according to stuff that people said to me that they allegedly said scientists did.

Speaker 1:          00:26:06       Um, it also makes you feel good. That's a rough one. You know what I mean? Whereas all that other shit, a lot of the pharmaceutical stuff just sorta like numbs the pain, all of that stuff. And then you all of a sudden you get onto the harder drugs and all that. It's really fucking evil. You know, I got a friend of mine, she had problems with there. She couldn't some going on with the shoulder. She couldn't pick a fucking arms up past shoulder. I referred it to this same as suits that I went to and she immediately was getting results and she, she was, according to her, was stuck going to these fucking doctors. I'm, look, I'm not totally shitting on doctors and stuff like that, but, uh, I don't know. It would be nice if the mainstream medical would kind of let these other people come in.

Speaker 1:          00:26:52       You know what I mean? It's just that I think the, the people outside people outside of the mainstream medical basically hospitals and shit, I don't know what mainstream medical means. It just sounds right to me. Right? Oh Jesus. I am so out of my fucking element. You know what? It feels good. I feel like I could start swinging my arms at a funeral right now. Um, when you get outside of hospitals and stuff, you could actually, most people you'll find, don't know what the fuck that dude, but if you find that gem that's outside of the fucking studio system, basically, they actually can cure, you know, where a lot of this other shit is. Just treating it and treating it and treating it and treating it until you then get symptoms for something else and then treat that, treat that, treat that. You know, I dunno.

Speaker 1:          00:27:38       It's, it's a fucking shady think and uh, it's a big fucking problem and it requires a lot of reading and research. And I have to be honest with you, I did none of that before I started talking about seven minutes ago. So there's that subject. What are we up to here? 27, almost 28 minutes. Um, this is all drawn nerd shit, but I saw Steve Smith has playing with journey again. I'm gonna have to go fucking see that. You know, I've never seen him when he played with vital information. I've never seen that guy play life. Got All his fucking DVDs and all that shit. There's another one I got to check off the fucking bucket list. But uh, um, if, if that, that sting Peter Gabriel tourists coming to your, uh, neck of the woods, do not sleep on it. Like I've never seen like staying, having so much fucking fun and ever, never realized how like goofy and silly Peter Gabriel was.

Speaker 1:          00:28:29       It's got all these sychronized dances and shit. It's fucking hilarious. And he's funny as hell and like sting was just like really just taken a back seat when letting Peter, Shane and all of that, I'll let you know all that fucking drama that you always heard in that band. The police, it was great seeing stink. Just fucking, I mean, granted the guy's still, he looks better than he looked when he was in the police. It's fucking ridiculous. Jesus Christ clean living and, and fucking yoga and whatever the fuck he does that tantric where you come for like fucking 50 minutes, whatever that shit is. It's unbelievable. I mean, the guy looks better than he did fucking 30 years ago. His hair somehow grew back. I, I dunno, I dunno what the fuck this guy is doing. He looks like it's a combination of like a teen idol and he said like Mad Max all at the same time.

Speaker 1:          00:29:22       He never kind of would like, as far as like his wardrobe though, I will say that guy is never sort of advanced past um, uh, that synchronicity tour, you know? And when he yells, he always has to put an o at the end of it. You know, when he did Roxanne and then when he had wanted to do a call and response with the crow with the crowd is going like, where did they all come from? He loves the, Oh, I bet he does that in his castle. You know, his wife yells up, you know, up the fucking goddamn stone stairway. Stay for lunch, lunch, lunch. And he's up there. Let's sandwich. Yo, she's fucking driving her nuts. Fuck does he put, oh, at the end of everything just fucking say sandwich. All right, you fucking cunt. What? You get knighted and all sudden you can put an o at the end of everything, you know.

Speaker 1:          00:30:20       Anyways, what am I doing here? It was so fucking great show. Um, all right, so I still have to go to work tomorrow and how we do the animatics, I'll take you through the whole process. Everybody over the next year as we wait for this fucking thing to come out. So once you write the thing, and once you record it, before they animate it, they had these things called animatics, which is just rough sketches. Okay. Of the scenes, the way that they're going to draw, draw, like, you know, they look at the script and says, you know, frank walks into the house so they know it's in the house, but there's a lot of other stuff that has sort of variables about where people are standing and where they're sitting, how they're eyes are moving and all of that shit. And it's that, this is where it gets a little bit tedious.

Speaker 1:          00:31:00       But, uh, it was much harder the first season, the second season. Now everybody kind of knows how everybody creates and shit. So we go in now and we'll look at the animatic for like the second, first or second episode. And you just look at, you know, is the scenes go and you'd be like, all right, frank needs to be standing up here or sue needs to be doing this or whatever. And um, I have to be honest with you, I am decent at arm gestures, but I'm really bad at the directing shit. Like this should be a two shot that should be a master and all that. Um, not only make bad at it, I have no desire to get good at it. So that's a tough thing. Like I don't give a shit that is that there's nothing more boring to me then that just sitting there going like, this should be over this guy's shoulder and this should be a two shot.

Speaker 1:          00:31:46       Can we Dolly in? Can we get a fucking whatever the fuck they say. And I just said, I just glaze over. It reminds me of when, for whatever stupid fucking reason, my junior year of high school, like I took Algebra two and fucking trigonometry and it was just like I fucking had to go to summer school after Algebra. I barely got out of that shit. I got to fucking d minus in geometry just because my teacher was cool. I flunked it. She gave me the d minus, so I didn't have back to back going to summer school and the district, I mean, I was lost by, I was done. I was done three weeks into September, Algebra two and trig. It was fucking over. And I ended up in fucking motherfucking summer school again. I swear to God, my geometry teacher didn't hook me up with a d minus. I would have had like a dynasty. I would have three years in a row, a summer school, fucking dope. Um, I don't know. I'll tell you this right now. This is how dumb I am is I can't even remember why I even just fucking told you that. What the hell was I talking about? I just sat up in my whole memory, went, what the fuck? A hell of his. What right

Speaker 1:          00:33:03       did I started talking about? I don't, I don't, I don't remember. Um, but you know what the great thing is is I don't have to remember anything else who gives a shit because this is, this is the a, this is just me checking in on you. Just peeking into your cubicle or maybe you've got an office. You've got a door. Huh? You feel good about yourself. You like that door. He puts stuff audit. Do you close it and say, no calls makes you feel good. Then you close the door and you snicker to yourself. Like I just said, no calls. Um, the no calls guy hold my calls.

Speaker 1:          00:33:35       Um, anyways. All right, that's it. That's, that's a podcast. Uh, please go see Peter Gabriel and sting on tour and he amazing Vinny, call euro and everybody else in both of those bands. Uh, I should have known more than names. I should have looked it up. But, uh, you know, I'm running around like a fucking loan to tick. Um, and that's it. If anybody can find that New York Times article, I would really love to read it. And, um, I'm also going to try to read up on all that whole fucking European Union thing for when I go over there just in case anybody's a cunt to me, uh, about not knowing what the fuck's going on in the world, which, which I don't. Um, I do know that there was some sort of fucking failed coup attempt in Turkey. Jesus Christ. The only thing scarier than trying to overthrow the, the government is attempting it and then failing.

Speaker 1:          00:34:26       This is one of the scariest couple of paragraphs I ever read. Turkey's President Tayyip t double. Why Ip Ert again, tell you bird again. Um, declared a state of emergency on Wednesday as he widened a crackdown against thousands of members of the security forces judicial to judiciary, civil service and academia after a failed military coup. All right, here's where it gets scary. Erdogan, however, you said, said the state of emergency lasting three months would allow his government to take swift and decisive measures against supporters of the COO and was allowed under the constitution. Yeah, they're about to kill a couple thousand motherfuckers.

Speaker 2:          00:35:17       Jesus.

Speaker 1:          00:35:20       That right there is the definition and the Joe [inaudible] and the old right there, Fred, right. There's no cold lotion in there. Okay.

Speaker 4:          00:35:29       MMM,

Speaker 1:          00:35:31       you're not cold. Lotion is, is is your final meal on death row.

Speaker 5:          00:35:38       Yeah, man. We'll make you whatever you want. Uh, you guys in sweetheart. Yeah. And then we're going to electrocute you. Ah, Jesus. Then. All right. Um, that's the podcast, but just checking in on you. I'll see you guys again on a talk to you. Get on Monday and um, that's it. Thank you to everybody who helped fix my fucking back. I feel great. I'm in a great mood. Please enjoy this music. And then we got 30 minutes of some throwback podcasts. Greatest hits from a podcast in a year.

Speaker 6:          00:36:07       All right. See you soon. Okay,

Speaker 5:          00:37:15       so I got that out of the way. Then I had two days to hang in New York and then I came down in New Jersey and I'm like, this is going to be great. I got the pressure, a Letterman off me. That's off my fucking back. And uh, now what? Now what do I do? I get to go to one of my favorite clubs in the country.

Speaker 6:          00:37:34       Okay.

Speaker 5:          00:37:35       The stress factory. I was already talking to what Vinnie brand? The club owner. He's got a boat. We were going to go out on his boat on Sunday. Everything was going to be great. All the shows were fucking sold up. Had a great time and then what happens? These fucking nerds on the weather channel. What do they do? They turn out all the lights in their studio and they put a flashlight under their Chin and just start scaring the living shit out of people and you know what kills me is every fucking time people buy into it. I was joking about it all weekend. I'm like, nothing's going to happen. I am in my hotel. Tell them I don't even have a fucking snickers bar. Nothing's going to happen. You're going to be fine. All these people going out gathering up fucking food for what

Speaker 5:          00:38:30       people do. You realize how long you can go without food. Food is no big deal. You need water. That's what the fuck you need. That's what you need. I'm actually looking here on a, who gives a fuck.com? How long can a person survive without food and water? Uh, basically it depends on a number of factors such as bodyweight, genetic variations, other health considerations, whether you're a fat fuck or not. Uh, most importantly, the presence or absence of dehydration. As long as you got water people, you can basically go 46 to about 73 days without, without food. Then that was based on a 10 individuals who died on a hunger strike and they all died between 46 days and 73 days. As long as they drank water. If you don't have water, I believe you dead. And about three days. All right, so enough with the fucking milk and eggs, all the soccer moms now for the next fucking three weeks. Who wants, who went theorial? Who wants what you have in theory? Alanya having an Omelette isn't going to go to waste. He's fucking people telling you to fill up your goddamn bathtub full of full of full of water just in case Jesus fucking Christ. I'd rather die than drink out of my bathtub. All right. I wash my fucking dog in there, not drinking out of that thing. What can I just stick my head out the window and drink? The rain drops. I think those when those be cleaner than the God damn tub that I watched my dog in and then hit with chemicals, love stomach cancer. By the time to fucking rescue boat comes,

Speaker 5:          00:40:18       you just get water. Everybody get water. Get yourself a couple of fucking zag nut bars and they'd go down, go down, go down to a god bad in fucking seven 11 and go buy an $8 Poncho. You find you were in a house, you fine. It's fucking people or whether she know how much they cost me. Half my God Damn Gig money. We could've had shows we could add show Saturday night. It was raining hard Saturday night. It could have done both shows. Everybody could have got their fucking labs. Everybody goes home and then at night [inaudible] Boegli the fucking hurricane. Hurricanes come through the north east. It's like, it's like an old price fighter. By the time it comes to us, it's all fucking punch drunk and people have no business standing out in it cause they should've got knocked out, have no fucking problem. Then they just sit there laughing at it. All right.

Speaker 5:          00:41:18       That's what it is. That's what a hurricane is in the northeast. It, you know when it's down south, it's Cassius clay. Right before he becomes Muhammad Ali, by the time it gets up to Jersey in New York, it's fucking Ali. When he fought Larry Holmes every fucking time. Yet these people, they all run out the weather channel. How long you guys, you guys think Fox News lies to you or CNN? Depending on what side of the political fence you're on, you want it. You want to see some lies put on the weather channel. Anytime there's a storm scaring the shit out of you, every time there's going to be, it's going to be four to six edge says, Holy Shit, that's almost up to my calves. How will I ever get to where the food is? 46 inches. Jesus Christ. Who are they talking to? 80 year olds.

Speaker 7:          00:42:15       Okay.

Speaker 5:          00:42:15       Even then, you know, 80 year old people, they'll be fine. You are there. They're already wearing a sweater.

Speaker 8:          00:42:24       Okay.

Speaker 5:          00:42:24       They're dressed for a blizzard year round. Does anybody will work for the weather channel? Does anybody who listened to my podcast, can you please tell me? Well, who's behind you? I think the supermarkets have behind that, right? Ralph's Shaws, Gelson's fucking whole foods. All of them. That's their payola. You know, with a big time corporations, they wait for the political elections. That's when they start throwing their money around and start calling up a truck full of hookers to go blow some Bible belt and Douche bag. Right?

Speaker 5:          00:43:00       Oh, married. I got five kids. I love my wife and I love Jesus. Support the troops. Right? And then what do they do? They throw a big pile of money at them. Have two, three horse drop to their knees. And next what? Next? What happens next? Huh? He comes on his blue blazer. That's what happens. Everybody goes all over his red tie and then he goes, AH, Jesus Christ. All right, you got me, you own me. You got video of it. Just tell me what you want me to do. I will pass any bill you want me to pass for the love of God. Don't let my wife see that.

Speaker 7:          00:43:33       Okay.

Speaker 5:          00:43:33       That's basically how that works. Well, let's, let's stay on track here. Okay. The fucking weather. Does anybody listen to my podcast work? Did they ever work? Can you give me any sort of anonymous behind the fucking scenes over there? Why? Every time it's just going to rain.

Speaker 7:          00:43:48       Okay.

Speaker 5:          00:43:48       Did they scare the living shit out of us? Why is that?

Speaker 7:          00:43:53       You know,

Speaker 5:          00:43:55       how often are they right? It always is. It's always downgraded to a tropical storm. By the time it comes here, someone was telling me the entire east coast, the way it's shaped, that's from years of hurricanes comes right into Florida and Georgia. South Carolina gives it a nice fucking upper cut to their southern balls and then slows the fuck down right over the Carolina, Virginia.

Speaker 7:          00:44:22       Yep. Then what?

Speaker 5:          00:44:26       Trimet, it hits DC. Barack Obama's out on the porch drying off his nuts with those. Nice. That nice hurricane when, right.

Speaker 5:          00:44:35       Oh Jesus. I don't know. I'm talking about, I just want to fucking go home. I was actually thinking, you know, when you, you, you know, when you fuck up in life, feel like God, if I could just go back 48 hours, Howard do this differently. There's an Avis in the lobby of my, uh, you know Jesus as a callback. I remember this time we left this comedian, he was always late. We had a car service to the airport. We were so sick of waiting for when we were going to miss our flight. We just took off with that and we said fuck him. And we got halfway to the airport and he calls up all pissed off. It's like, Yo, where the fuck boy you put a fuck. Why are you like do we waited for your 20 minutes? You didn't show up? And he's like, I was in the, and that became the catch phrase for the rest of the tour. I was in the lobby anytime you fucked up and people will call him, calling you on some shit. You went over your time. No I didn't. Yes you did. I was in the lobby. Oh. And it made us laugh. I don't know if it made you laugh. I don't give a shit, but he expected from me. I'm, I'm stranded.

Speaker 5:          00:45:41       I feel like I'm being held hostage in my captors. Forgot about me, you know? And maybe it was just all a practical joke. I have no idea. So whatever. Here I sit.

Speaker 2:          00:45:53       Okay.

Speaker 5:          00:45:54       You know, it was anything sadder than a stranded comedian with no shows to do.

Speaker 9:          00:46:00       Yeah.

Speaker 5:          00:46:01       They got a 24 hour gym downstairs. I haven't used it.

Speaker 2:          00:46:05       Okay.

Speaker 5:          00:46:05       Um, but talking to you guys about all the way to eat, the way you lose weight. I haven't been doing it dummy pizzas. I had fish and chips today. I had fucking to hamburgers. This is all during a hurricane, big bad hurricane Irene fucking over rated. So I'm sitting here, I realized, you know, tomorrow I'm like, finally I'm getting the fuck out of here. Go home. Could see my girl, I can see my dog. Right? Can I have a good fucking time, you know, can cruise around in my hybrid. That's what I was looking forward to doing. And, uh, all of a sudden I realized that was stranded here. So what do I do? Do I handle it like a man? What do I start cursing like a little bitch? You know what the answer is? So once I'm done having my fucking temper Tantrum, excuse me, I a sufficient chips. I say, all right, I'm going to run a fucking rent a movie here in the hotel. So I go to rent a movie. It's called catching hell to documentary about the guy with the glasses who was at the cubs game, who, uh, reached up for that foul ball that Moisis Lou was allegedly going to catch. So I hit the info to watch the trailer and they're talking about, they got this guy on, they're gone and says how he worked for sports illustrated and his assignment was to find this guy.

Speaker 7:          00:47:42       Okay,

Speaker 5:          00:47:42       whatever the fuck his name was, Steve [inaudible]. I don't know. I'm not from Chicago, so I don't give a shit. I don't know what his name is. All right. His, as he goes, my assignment was to find this guy and he goes, my heart sank. You know, because I actually felt for this guy, I didn't want to go see him. And I said to my editor, editor, why can't we just leave this guy alone? Can't we just leave the guy alone? He goes, no, go find them. And then they shout showing the highlights of this dude. And for those of you don't know the play, basically the cubs have won the world series since 1908. You know, there a game away from going there, five outs away from going to the fucking world series. Sorry to all the cub fans. Just hit fucking mute for the next 10 minutes. Um,

Speaker 7:          00:48:25       okay.

Speaker 5:          00:48:26       They got the five outs away. So some dude, right? A lefthanded batter hits a slicing foul down the left field line. It's right there. And uh, the cubs left field or Moises Alou, he's got a chance to make a play and all the, all these fans reach up to grab the ball. But the, the, it just hits one guy and a Moises Alou flips out cause he doesn't catch it and he sorta yells towards the fans. Like, what the fuck I could've caught that. And then after that the wheels start falling off, but they got a double play ball. Good solace could have made it. Buddy booted it man first and then they let up eight runs, they lose the game and then they lose game seven. And then everybody wants to murder this fucking kid. So this guy is basically sold that. They're going to basically interview the guys far as I could fucking tell. And I'm like, Jesus Christ, that's fascinating. I want to let me watch this. God, God knows I got the time.

Speaker 5:          00:49:20       Let me watch this movie. All right, so I go to order it and it doesn't allow me to, so I got to call downstairs to have the uh, you know, I dunno what somebody had kids or something. I didn't want to run a porno, so I had to get that, you know, just switched over so I could actually be an adult and pick out a movie. So I watched this fucking thing. All right. About the cubs, about their history, about their curse, about this poor bastard that got used as the scapegoat. This is what I was sold. This is the bill of goods. I was sold. Okay. After 36 hours of being lied to by the fucking weather channel, I want some truth in my life. This is what you're telling me. This thing is about, this is how your advertising and I want to see it.

Speaker 5:          00:50:05       Do you know what the first 15 minutes of that movie was? It was taking me through the red sox in 1986 as they excrutiatingly slowly replayed the bill Buckner incident and I'm sitting there watching it. All of a sudden I'm looking at bill Buckner. I'm like, what the F did I order the wrong fucking thing? I don't want to see shit. Do you understand? This is like my baseball nine 11 I don't ever want it. You know that like the 10 year anniversary of of nine 11 is coming up and like they, I don't want to watch any of that. I don't ever want to see that footage again. Like how the fuck could you ever forget it? It's absolutely fucking horrific. Horrific. I don't want to see it. I don't need to see it to remember it. I'll never forget. It's our Pearl Harbor. My grandmother still doesn't like Japanese people because of Pearl Harbor.

Speaker 5:          00:50:58       Okay. If she can remember that shit, I don't think I got a problem. Remember something 10 fucking years ago. Okay, so now. Anyways, total total fucking tangent there. So I'm watching this thing and for the first 20 just to worn red sox fucking fence, the first fucking 15 minutes of this movie is the bill Buckner thing. The thing that we left behind. It's so funny because Paul Versey just texted me then the night before during the hurricane, typical fucking Yankee Fed, typical Yankee Fan living in the past, right? He, he texted me, he goes, hey bill, what was, what was worse for a Red Sox Fan? He goes, Buckner or Aaron Boone just out of nowhere, we won't even talk in baseball. And I was just like,

Speaker 5:          00:51:47       I was like neither do to it. It's like, I don't even think about that shit anymore to be honest with you. And then he gets mad at me about a typical red sox fan. Terrible fucking answer, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. It's like, I don't know what he wanted out of me, so I just texted back. It's like, dude, I haven't thought about that shit since 2004 it's over. You know what it is. It's Yankee fans used to be able to bully red sox fans about that shit because we hadn't won one forever, you know? So they just, I think that they, they miss, they're kind of like our big brother who just beat the shit out of us forever. And then one day we were the same height and kick the shit out of him, you know? And then they just, they, it was over.

Speaker 5:          00:52:29       We're not scary anymore. We expect to beat you. It's fucking over. And I, I think they still don't know what to do. You know? Wait a minute, we used to tease you and we used to always win and yeah, now you don't, now you don't. Now we got this the biggest choke of all fucking time as hung around your neck. That will never be beaten. When do you guys think another $220 million $10 million team, whatever the fuck it was with five first ballot hall of famers are going to lose four games in a row, have to be an up three games to none. I'm asking you to a fucking team that hasn't won a world series and like a hundred years. Right. He had just asked me about that and I swear to God I had not thought about Buckner.

Speaker 7:          00:53:10       Yeah,

Speaker 5:          00:53:11       yeah. Since like all for it was fucking, it was over. It was great. I don't even give a shit now. I don't even give a shit. And I got to tell you, it's phenomenal to sit down and watch a red sox game and something good to happen. And when something bad happens, you get upset at the player rather than some sort of specter or some sort of ghost or some overly boogaloo horse shit. Right?

Speaker 9:          00:53:38       So

Speaker 5:          00:53:41       I'm going to watch this fucking thing. And all of a sudden out of nowhere, this show, and I may do, they broke. They almost broke down bill Buckner more than they broke down this poor cubs fan.

Speaker 7:          00:53:54       Yeah.

Speaker 5:          00:53:54       And in the end the dude doesn't get the interview. There's no interview. They just talk all day. But what I still recommend it, I'm still wrecking recommending it because they show, um, they talk to the people. Some people, I guess they found the people who like through bear Adam, they talked to the security guard. He was removing them, giving them shit that he now feels bad that he did and they have the footage of him going out of the ballpark and putting the jacket over him. It's fucking amazing what happens to this dude. And uh, I, I totally recommend it, but I just, they should have been some sort of warning for a red sox fan. It was like walking, go run in into your old psycho girlfriend.

Speaker 7:          00:54:45       Okay.

Speaker 5:          00:54:45       Somebody who stopped you or something. Just somebody who just hadn't even thought about 2000 for seven years. I haven't thought about that shit. I haven't even thought about that. And fucking seven years. And all of a sudden this documentary about the cubs, they just go blow by blow through the Buckner thing. Cause I guess they wanted to show how Buckner was used as escape goat, despite the fact Bob Stanley through the wild pitch and how this kid was used as, as the goat for the cubs, despite the fact that Gonzales booted a fucking double play ball, which would've got him out of the [inaudible]. Um,

Speaker 7:          00:55:24       okay.

Speaker 5:          00:55:25       I Dunno, it's, I, it's definitely interesting, but I was, I was more than upset that and an elder and they even show the Aaron Boone home run, which I don't even remember because that was basically annoying for about 12 months, you know, because it was immediately rectified

Speaker 9:          00:55:45       and, uh,

Speaker 5:          00:55:47       but it was just one of those things. I don't know. I don't fucking know, but I gotta be honest with you, I never really felt bad for cubs fans. I never did because, you know, they didn't have that anger did the Midwest, I don't know what it is. They're positive. I don't know what it is. They just didn't have that anger or misery.

Speaker 7:          00:56:05       Okay.

Speaker 5:          00:56:05       You know what? The Red Sox, back in the day, it was every Yankee success was our failure. And with the cubs, they just, you know, hey, let's play two zip Betty do. Du was like a big fucking keg party,

Speaker 9:          00:56:19       you know.

Speaker 5:          00:56:20       It's like they didn't even give a shit. Even their curse was stupid. The curse of the goat. It was just fucking stupid.

Speaker 6:          00:56:27       MMM.

Speaker 5:          00:56:29       Made no sense. It's a ballpark. You've got a goat. It doesn't belong here. It's going to shit all over the place. Get it Outta here. I curse you. Really?

Speaker 6:          00:56:37       MMM.

Speaker 5:          00:56:39       Any fucking waste.

Speaker 5:          00:56:41       So they actually bring up what, like skateboarding, my sheet ruining this entire thing. You probably don't have to fucking run it. They start talking about what? It's, how they came up with that terminology. The scape goat and it went back to religion. Oh Gee. That I guess back in the day, I don't know what the hell religion it was. They're all fucking stupid when you really get down to it other than they're due on to other stuff that every religion has. Um, they would basically have a goat. They bring a goat in and I'm thinking, all right, they're going to sacrifice it or whatever, and they wouldn't have, the priest would lay his hands on a goat for once instead of some unsuspecting child. Oh, a little molestation joke for ya. How'd you guys like that? Huh? Do you like that on your Monday? Do you think that that was crossing the line? Well, fuck you. I'm stranded in New Jersey.

Speaker 6:          00:57:35       Okay.

Speaker 5:          00:57:36       Fucking New Jersey, Huh? Jesus Christ. What? A bunch of animals. You know what amazes me about New Jersey is how they still support Jon boat. Jon Bon Jovi or the Bon Jovi bend to the point that that band can sell out giant stadium still.

Speaker 6:          00:57:56       Okay.

Speaker 5:          00:57:57       Unbelieve let's Jersey for it's 70,000 people singing, singing along. Lay Your hands on me. Your love is not bad. Med is to [inaudible]. Whoa. Fucking acid wash as far as the eye can see, dirty jersey.

Speaker 5:          00:58:21       Actually, I think New Jersey underrated is New Jersey. It's fucking phenomenal. All these New York snobs, Paul Versey being one of them. I'm really trashing him this week. Paul versus your typical New York snob. And I hope you're listening to this, Paul, our help born, somebody sends this to you. Um, yeah, he's, he's a snob. He's one of those guys who just thinks because he's on the other side of an imaginary line that all of a sudden, I don't know what that the trees are greener. The grass is, I don't know what the fuck it is. You know what I really realize, like most New Yorkers judge New Jersey on their drive to Newark Airport where they go by all those chemical plants, look at it. It's so fucking shit hole. Oh, right. Despite the fact that all some of the most major celebrities live here, we think they live next to the plant. You know,

Speaker 5:          00:59:18       all those fucking guys down on Wall Street, the children of the Illuminati, they all live out there. And Red Bank with their fucking, uh, Rockefeller estates. I know, but they got New Jersey license plates. Therefore it must suck. Anyway, let's get back to the scapegoat. Um, so basically the, uh, you know, the priest would take a day off from dental and kids and he'd lay his hands on a farm animal and one would think he would grab the horns and then start fornicating. But this, that's another story. What they would do with the goat is he'd lay his hands on it and he would basically, somehow, I guess after everybody confessed to this douche bag, he would then place all of the sins on the goat and then they would just banish the goat and send it out of town with all the sins in everybody's souls. We're going to be clean again. But this is the funny thing. As the goat left, people would line up on either side of the street and they would, they would heckle the goat and jeer at them. Eh, you fucking adulterous piece of shit. Yeah. Why don't you jump off again? You can't just yelling about the sins that they did. I don't know what it was. Yeah. It keeps stealing from the pot at work. You selfish prick, yelling at a farm animal, you know, I swear to God, I would love to have a segment on here of all this stupid fucking things that, that, that they do in religion that people, you know.

Speaker 7:          01:00:56       Yeah,

Speaker 5:          01:00:57       there's no fucking way, there wasn't somebody like me back then go into it. This is fuck. Why are we yelling at a goat? You know? I mean how you're banged somebody fucking wife. You stole money from work, you know, you're booted an old lady in the ass. Do you really think it's in the goat now and it's just walking? I just don't fucking get it. Even if they filled your head up with it as a kid, at some point you gotta be looking at it like this is a fucking goat.

Speaker 7:          01:01:32       Okay.

Speaker 5:          01:01:32       It's got nothing to do with it. So anyways, they would just Jared this thing and they'd send it out of town and then everybody would be absolved and I don't know where to go. It would go. Sometimes they say they take the goat and they would throw it off a cliff,

Speaker 5:          01:01:45       you know? I know it's extra painful for me because I fucking love goats. I really do. I was actually feeding some this morning. I don't know what it is about them. I think they're fucking hilarious. You know I got this buddy. He lives out here, right? He's got this giant house, there's all this fucking land and he's got farm animals, farm animals on it and I'm thinking he's got these fucking things because he's like me. He's, he likes, he thinks goats or funny or whatever. And it is, and I found out that there's tax laws out that if you farm on your land, you only have to pay property taxes on one acre. So he went out and got these goats. He doesn't even give a shit about it. Can you fucking believe that he's got like 10 goddamn goats and he has to go out there with this bucket of feed every day. He's got to feed these things and it's hard as an in it. That's what kills me. It's just just pay. It's just paid the taxes. If I, it would be worth it to not get up there with that lunch pail of cheerios every fucking morning.

Speaker 7:          01:03:02       Okay?

Speaker 5:          01:03:03       Jesus fucking Christ. What is what? It's just money. It's paper. Who gives a fuck? You just, you know, work a couple extra hours. Fuck it. What do I owe you? You sit down, you're writing numbers on a piece of paper. You stick it in a magic envelope. You'll fucking lick it. You send it out next. Jesus Christ are you gonna sit there and have a bunch of goddamn livestock. It's fucking guys swear to God.

Speaker 8:          01:03:33       Okay.

Speaker 5:          01:03:34       If, if, if you had a Giraffe, oh, what do you guys want? What do you guys want? Hang on. This is the hotel. Yeah, sorry about that. I had to go answer the phone. I couldn't even figure out how to work the fucking phone. He's probably somebody above me that was probably yelling too loud. God knows what they are mad about.

Speaker 7:          01:03:54       Okay.

Speaker 5:          01:03:55       Anna, just thinking about some of the Shit I've made fun of. You know, Jesus beastiality and Bon Jovi and they all hold the same weight here in New Jersey. Um, the hell was I talking about? Oh yeah. This fucking guy. I swear to God, if he, if he would get a giraffe, you get like five giraffes. If, if he only had to pay like a quarter acre tax.

Speaker 7:          01:04:17       Okay.

Speaker 5:          01:04:18       They always amazes me when people like that in the money, you know?

Speaker 7:          01:04:23       Okay.

Speaker 5:          01:04:23       I mean, I obviously give a fuck about money. I want to have enough to survive.

Speaker 8:          01:04:29       But uh,

Speaker 5:          01:04:32       the amount of shit that didn't work and I never took it back.

Speaker 7:          01:04:36       Okay.

Speaker 5:          01:04:36       Just blows my eye. I've probably kept at least 25 grand worth of shit that doesn't work in my life. I just gotta you gotta be shitting they same as what? The fucking prime. He's fucking pieces of shit and I go off, then my girl goes to last. You return it. Ah, not doing that shit. Standing down there with the sales slip, like some angry old fucking lady. I'm not doing it. Who to hell would be calling me now I'm all self conscious about whatever. If I'm too loud, knock on my door,

Speaker 5:          01:05:09       I swear to God. I bet it was the Bon Jovi Shit. Um, anyway, so let's get on with the podcast. This is the Monday morning podcast. Everybody, if you're to this podcast, welcome. Um, this is yes, and if you're thinking this is extra dirty and extra angry this week, no, this is how it is every fucking week. All right. Do one of these every week. I do them on Monday mornings because I know most people hate their jobs or they hate their commute. They hate their spouse or they hate themselves, you know, and they need, they need to brake. And it's also a great way to horror out wherever the fuck I'm going to be. Uh, speaking of which I am going to be in a Columbus, Columbus, so Ohio at the funny bone down at the mall. Dot. Bragen on the, uh, September 9th, 10th and 11th. That is my next gig. I'm gonna try to go to that, uh, Ohio state game. You know, it's in September. That's always a dangerous one. You know, to go to a college football game is September. Who were they playing? They playing Wentworth technical institute.

Speaker 5:          01:06:22       You know, I'm new to college football the last couple of years and evidently that's what they do. They've got all their cupcake games in the beginning of the year and I guess these other colleges, uh, they pay money to, to play these giant teams and get the living shit kicked out of them on television just to, I don't know what to expose to get TV exposure for their school. I have no idea. Speaking of scapegoats, their entire fucking division three team goes out there a bunch of up against a bunch of roided up division one guys or whatever the fuck they're doing now. I don't know. And then they get the shit kicked out of him, but I don't know, every once in a while an Appalachian Mountain state community college will beat a Michigan. So I don't know who they're playing that weekend, but I'm going to go down there. Uh, I was looking forward to it until I spent fucking 14 straight days on the road.

That's how I'm doing them. All right. When somebody, uh, somebody different. Okay. Because, uh, I don't want to interview other comedians. I just feel too many podcasts or doing that. I've done too many podcasts talking about comedy. I don't have any comedy stories left. I really don't. And I gotta be honest with you, aside from a couple of people who are really good interviewers, the Mark Marin's, Joe Rogan's and that type of shit, uh, I probably should have saved most of them for, ah, the unmasked that I did

Speaker 7:          01:09:08       okay.

Speaker 5:          01:09:08       With, uh, Ron from Ron and Fez, I dunno where you can find that, but I did one of those this past week and, uh, ah, I've just been running my yap all fucking week late. Why don't, why don't we get to something entertaining here? Uh, somebody sent me a, um,

Speaker 5:          01:09:25       this youtube video of this week, you really have to watch it. Okay. It's one of those shows. It's basically, it's a rip off of the view. It's for broad sitting around and they got the same thing. You know, they got the older one, they got the sexy one, they got the one who was fat and then got her fucking stomach tied up like a God damn balloon. Not now she's dropping weight faster than a junkie. Right. I don't even know if that's true. I just looked around them. You know, they got the racially mixed chick and they all got on their fucking shoes. Right. The little outfits. Uh, hang on a second. Hang on a second. Somebody's knocking. I'll let you know what this is.

Speaker 5:          01:10:01       All right. You guys not going to believe this shit that was security and they just said that they had a noise complaint. There was a lot of, uh, the guy comes to the, I go to the door. Right? This is so pathetic that at 43, I'm getting reprimanded. I feel like I'm in fucking high school and I talk like it too. Um, let me just the levels here or maybe turn up yours cause I don't want to get kicked out of here. Um, and say open a door and there's a security guard. And he goes, Ah, you Ben? And I'm like, no.

Speaker 7:          01:10:36       Okay.

Speaker 5:          01:10:42       Cause I know he, I know that he knows my name's bill. Well this is the thing, when security interrogates you, you never offer any information, you know, are you bent? No. And then I just looked at him like, is there anything else I can help you with? And he's like, and he looks down on a piece of paper. Oh, are you bill? And I was like, yes, yes I am. And he goes, uh, yeah, we, uh, we get a noise complaint from people on either side of you.

Speaker 10:         01:11:14       Uh, these are VIP rooms on either side of you. And, uh, talking about, uh, it's very loud. There's a lot of cursing. And I'm like, all right. He goes, is there anyone else? No. Wait, wait, wait. He told me, can you step out in the hall? And I go for what? He goes, I need you to step out in the hall. And I said for what? And then he just goes into a Spiel, you know the fuck the want you to step out in the hall for [inaudible] am I gonna be able to hear you better? You know I sit in the racking like your Goddamn state trooper, you're fucking sport coat on. It has the name of the hotel and the lapel. I'm supposed to step out in the hall. I don't know who you are. Right?

Speaker 10:         01:11:57       I'm such a Dick. It's ridiculous. Right? So I made them basically say I just didn't doorway and he asked me, he goes, is there anybody else in there? And I was like no. And then yeah, that's what he basically said. I'm being too loud. Jesus Christ. I was cursing, I think it was you realized that he said this, people on either side trying to sleep and I was singing Bon Jovi songs at the top of my fucking lungs. All right. I was also talking about beastiality and I was trashing Jesus. You know what? This hotel is cool as hell cause when you really think about it, they probably should have kicked me out. Um, all right, so this is going to be my voice for the rest. This is bill on punishment voice. I'd like to apologize to everybody here at the Sheridan. Um, anyways, you know what some rich cons on the other side of the door with a fucking piece of one of those really fancy glasses that they think came from France but actually came from a fucking pottery barn.

Speaker 10:         01:12:57       Um, if you can hear me, go fuck yourself. This is what you get for nuke in the economy. Um, all right. So anyways, so I'm watching this show, these four fucking broads on it. Okay. Listen, nothing too. I had to be, oh, he told me this is, this is your one and only warning next time you will be. And he say objected from the hotel. He had such hacky security, uh, like terminology, you know, a fucking enough. I do, you know how bad I just want to yell cunt at the top of my lungs right now and get ejected from the fucking hotel. Just so I can get out of Jersey. Maybe I should call up Paul version. Tell me to, you know, fuck that. That's what I'm going to do after this podcast. I'm calling up Paul Versey and I'm having them coming down and get me all right. You know, fucking threaten me next time I come up here. What do you my fucking Dad fucking douchebag Christ. I swear to God. You know what's funny about the male voice is it, uh, is it carries, you ever noticed that when there's a couple next door, you can never, the woman's voice, you're just hear the guy every once in a while go, Ooh, the Lulu.

Speaker 10:         01:14:18       Whoo, whoo, whoo. Yeah. You never hit the broad. So I'm probably gonna get kicked out.

Speaker 2:          01:14:26       Okay,

Speaker 10:         01:14:26       what do I do? And you know what? Go Fuck Yourself. I'll take a cab back to New York.

Speaker 2:          01:14:31       Yeah.

Speaker 10:         01:14:31       Then they drop courses. They probably won't show up because they're still afraid. Afraid of the weather channel. Um, anyway, so these four fucking broads, they're on TV, right. And they ended up there talking about that guy that doing that story. You know that story where that dude get his dick cut off. I'm gonna have to raise the levels here. There we go. How's that? Is that better? All right. So talking about that guy who got his dick cut off his wife, drugged him, tied him to a bed, cut his dick off, threw it in a garbage disposal and turned it on. And it was basically because he wanted to get a divorce from her. She mutilated them. She ended the guy's fucking life and he saw of quality. Life is over and these women are talking about it and lo and behold, it's fucking hilarious to them. They had all they could do to keep a straight face during the first minute of setting up the story. And then all the jokes come and they are laughing their fucking asses off.

Speaker 10:         01:15:41       It's the funniest fucking thing ever. And this right here, it's because of that type of shit that I don't feel that I am misogynistic. I just don't. I think that I am just like women. I trashed women the way they trash guys. It's just nobody pays attention to the broads. They don't. Do you think of a guy mutilated a woman in any shape or form that four guys on a pregame NFL show would be laughing about it? You know, Sharon Osborne was the guest and she goes, somebody asks, you think the guy deserved, and she goes, well, it depends on what he did. You know? I mean, that thought is totally overlaps. The thought of those morons in the Middle East who cut women's clits off, you know, it's fucking medieval thought and it's just considered silly. I don't know what it is. I don't know. But it maintains what I've always fucking said, that women will do a to you exactly what they don't want you to do to them if you let them.

Speaker 10:         01:16:55       And I think why so many guys are miserable in marriages is they get married to fucking young before they really know how to stick up for themselves in a relationship. And that's why before you know it, yeah, married and all your shit is either in the basement of the garage and she's barely touching it and a, and you're wondering what the fuck happened to your life. You know, I don't know. The video is, is going to be up on the [inaudible] podcast.com. You know something. This is actually, I like this talking like this. This is very challenging to try and be funny with a late night DJ voice. All right. This next chunk of the podcast goes out to the ladies. Ladies, if you're out there and you're single, hang in there, there's a date rape is on the horizon. This next song rape me by Nirvana.

Speaker 10:         01:17:51       Who was, I'll tell you. Um, I know that somebody, some Vanderbilt on either side to may going Keith curse thing again. MMM. Anyways, uh, being on the road, what did I want to talk about? Bitches laughing at Dick being cut off already talked about that, wanting to go home. Talked about that. All right. Last week, uh, I was, I, we showed that youtube clip about that guy running on that soccer field and getting, uh, you know, getting beat down by the cops and then the crowd overwhelms the cops and beats down the cops. And I wanted to hear from the police officers to just ask basically why they're such dicks when they pull you over. Uh, not in a judgmental way, but just, I'm just basically asking the question, the way all drivers talk. So we have a cop responding here. He says, hey bill, not all cops are assholes.

Speaker 10:         01:18:44       Some are just lazy. Uh, the summer after my sophomore year, oh, no, no, no, no. This is a different ones. What the fuck is the one from the cop? That's the one I want to hit. Oh, here we go. Here we go. Here we go. Let's see if I can read this before being ejected from the hotel. Uh, you're not going to be, the worst is if I do get ejected. This guy's going to be standing here, uh, with this security fucking jacket on in my hotel room, watching me gather my things. So once again, I already have a game plan for that. If I come, if there's another knock at my door, I'm not opening it. I'm going to look through the peephole and I'm talking through the door. So we opened the door please. And I'm going to go, why?

Speaker 10:         01:19:32       Uh, uh, cause and I'm just going to ask him straight out. Am I being ejected from the hotel? Uh, yes sir. You need to let me know and I'll just bolt the door and I'm going to be like, listen, I'm going to gather my things. I'll be out there in five minutes. You just sit tight. All right. You with no fucking badge. All right. What are you going to do? Take off your shoe? Is that what you're going to do? Try and throw it through the crack in the door. It's not going to hit me fucking asshole. Can you step out into the lobby until the hallway please go fuck yourself.

Speaker 2:          01:20:11       Huh?

Speaker 10:         01:20:13       You fucking half a cop? You half a security guard? Like step out into the hotel? No, I won't. Okay, then I'll just, just stay there then you douchebag. Um, anyways, let's plow ahead. So here's a cup. Uh, um, okay, Bill. Uh, the thing about this job is basically that we have no fucking idea who we are dealing with at any given time. Just because someone looks sweet and innocent. And just because the situation isn't likely to escalate, it doesn't mean that they're not capable of murder or that the situation may go pear shaped quickly. I don't even know what that means.

Speaker 2:          01:20:56       Okay.

Speaker 10:         01:20:56       Pear shaped, I don't want to shape is a pair of shaped like what, what, what shape is it before it goes pear shaped? Is it an apple shape? Somebody he can't talk shop cause you're gonna lose me. I'm not that bright a guy. Um, anyways, I can't tell you how many times that someone said to me like, I'm going to do anything people or what about that person running upstairs? Hi, can you eject that eight, eight year old out of the fucking hotel. All right. You know, I feel, I feel like right now like, uh,

Speaker 2:          01:21:30       okay.

Speaker 10:         01:21:30       Either I'm announcing a golf match or, um,

Speaker 2:          01:21:37       okay.

Speaker 10:         01:21:37       Um, I'm reporting live from a hostage situation. Okay. There talking to him right now, he still has the weapon up to the woman's head. You can clearly see that she's frightening. Okay. There's somebody flanking him on the left. Oh, he doesn't like, okay, he's fired. A shot it missed. And Al, they just took them down. Oh my God. He's been shot in the head and they have to woman. Um, anyways, plowing ahead here. Um, so anyways, the amount of time just got pulls people over and the person behind the wheel says like, I'm going to do anything. People think that I know. Oh, the people, the drivers and stuff think that I know them their whole lives and know that their Cape, that they're incapable of harming anyone. But I don't, I always think back to the academy and all the videos we watched of cops getting killed or nearly killed because they made one mistake or had a lapse in the paranoia that keeps us safe.

Speaker 10:         01:22:34       See that? I knew it. I knew it was something that they showed them at the academy. I said, another thing to remember is that there is a gun at every call and every traffic stop the gun on my belt. No Man is invincible and a lucky punch can knock me unconscious, leaving me vulnerable to take to them taking my weapon and killing me or others. For this reason, we like to keep some distance. We don't like to be touched in a bubble. We can't allow people to get the opportunity to take control of our weapon. Um, so when someone's sir, uh, squarely or not listening to my commands, they may get cuffed and put in the back of my car until everything is figured out. They may not like it, but I am going home at the end of my shift, not to the morgue.

Speaker 10:         01:23:17       Uh, that leaves another point of control. No one likes to be bossed around and told what to do. But when the police are there, were there for a reason someone called us or we have a reason to believe that we're needed. Once we're there, we have to be in control. We call the shots, not, um, not forgo or to be on a power trip, but because if we lose control, we're fucked. It's our ass. If someone gets hurt and our president, and it's literally Rs, if we get hurt or killed, if someone thinks that they can do what they want or walk over me, how am I supposed to do my job? Uh, as for the videos you recently posted, those cops with the name changer were absolutely terrible. If there is a lawful warrant for that guys arrest despite the reason, uh, it is their job to arrest him.

Speaker 10:         01:24:03       Um, the suspect knew about the warrant. I didn't know what video is. It didn't take care of it. Now he asked to see a judge they should have, they should have used much more forced to take them into custody. But the reality of it is you can't just be able to keep passively resisting a cop until, until the cops let you go. Uh, they can't let you go. All right, here we go. With the video at the stadium was disturbing. They shouldn't have been. Obviously jabbing the guy with their batons, but they had the right to take him into custody. People running around sports fields isn't and shouldn't be tolerated. Are they supposed to stop the game and wait for him to be finished with running around? What if he assaulted or killed an athlete? Then everyone would be crying that the cops didn't do anything.

Speaker 10:         01:24:46       There's a great point. Also when we deal with people, 90% of the possible danger from them is their hands. If you're laying on your hands and I can't see them, I will expect the worst. How am I supposed to do? How am I supposed to know what they are? Lay that they aren't laying on a weapon. Uh, when I want your hand gimme your hand or I will use force to get them out. Yeah, they go, uh, one last thing is tasers. Uh, they are amazing tools. I've been tased and training and yes, it sucks, but it beats getting thumped or shot. Uh, we're in the old days, a guy may get the crap beat out of him or his brain can cost. Now he gets an electric ride for five seconds. It's also amazing because the suspect can be cuffed while being taste. Basically less chance for everyone to see, to get seriously hurt.

Speaker 10:         01:25:36       Why should I risk getting seriously hurt or killed going hands on with someone when they can just be taste. Um, that, you know what somebody told me a long time ago, if you want to make, if you get pulled over by a cop, a great way to help them relax and maybe bring down them being a dick to you is a have your hands where they can see them. You know, if it's during the day, I always put on like right on the steering wheel. I get pulled over a lot by the way. Uh, not as much. I guess back in the day I did, cause I used to just drive 80 miles an hour anywhere I was going, you know, there's only so many fucking farm she can look at. Um, it was funny. So I'm still nervous about getting thrown out of here. And the only reason why is because some of the roads are washed out and I don't know where the fuck I would go by. I don't know why I'm nervous because I am now speaking in a speaking tone. If I'm not allowed to speak, this is actually great stuff. What if I show the hotel security my hands, maybe he'll allow me to stay.

Speaker 9:          01:26:43       So anyways, um,

Speaker 8:          01:26:45       okay.

Speaker 10:         01:26:46       Yeah, I put my hands right on top of the steering wheel where they can see them. Um, if it's a sunny day, I have one hanging out the car window where they can see it. And the other one I just put on top of my head, like an ape chilling out in, uh, in the zoo. You know, when they sit there and they just have that one arm draped over their head,

Speaker 8:          01:27:05       uh, I sit like that.

Speaker 10:         01:27:09       And then when they show up, I just had my hands on the steering wheel and, uh, and you know what, there's still assholes,

Speaker 10:         01:27:20       you know, it's kind of a crap shoot, you know, so, but I think this guy run up a lot of great points. What the fuck is he supposed to do? And that's a great point. If the guy ran on the field and did something to an athlete, then they would blame the security and they would be screaming and yelling at them, you know, which probably goes back to the weather channel then if they don't scare the living shit out of people that they would get blamed for not warning people. But I think it has more to do with, uh, scaring people, gives them great ratings. Um, so I don't know any more cops want to weigh in. I, here's one for you. I want to know what, what do you guys think about that? You can anonymously talk about this as cops, that kid who got shot on the subway platform and died new year's Day in Oakland, um, they do definitely wasn't being compliant. He definitely wasn't giving them, showing them his hands. And this guy, I dunno, he's like the Manchurian candidate. All of a sudden the guy said the wrong thing. The guy's laying on his stomach.

Speaker 7:          01:28:16       Okay.

Speaker 10:         01:28:16       One cops got his foot on his neck. I mean, the dude is down. And all of a sudden this one kid just stood up, takes out a gun and just shoots the guy right in the back. And I do, it's like what the fuck is shot me? And he ended up dying.

Speaker 8:          01:28:31       Um, you know

Speaker 10:         01:28:35       what about that one? That's, that's, that's one, this is what I should say for the podcast. So like, cause that's what I want to ask and I didn't want to like just have so many go on there anonymously and just say what you think about it should have that cop gone to jail because uh, he got what basically usually happens when a cop shoots somebody is he got off?

Speaker 8:          01:28:58       Um, I dunno, but

Speaker 10:         01:29:02       I don't want to, I don't want to do this whole cop thing attack and cops, I'd like to try to create some sort of forum where you can actually anonymously present your side and that worry about pissing off other cops or worry about pissing off victims or any of that type of shit. Cause I think it's, I don't know, it's one of those things for some reason I guess I know why. The reason is it's too much shit at stake so people don't talk about it. Um, that could have been a lot more fun topic. I didn't have to speak in my time out voice. This is officially the first Mlm podcast. Timeout on. Oh wait a minute then. Fucking old bastard downstairs.

Speaker 2:          01:29:37       Yeah.

Speaker 10:         01:29:38       You know something? I think I'm allowed asshole.

Speaker 2:          01:29:42       Okay.

Speaker 10:         01:29:42       I think that that's what it is. You know, on both sides of the country. I've been told that I'm too loud. I need to shut the fuck up self. They know at some point you gotta look in the mirror and realize that you, all right, let's plow ahead of here. All right. Advice for the week. They'll have known this young lady for a few years and we're very fond of each other. Uh, but she has had, she's had, she has a possessive boyfriend with a stupid haircut in a couple of times when she's broken up with him, she's come to me. Uh, but then she goes back to macro man. Uh, this is the thing that bothers me. Whenever things have got gotten sexual between us, like I go down on her and blower fucking mind. This guy has definitely got confidence. He goes, she never returns the favor.

Speaker 10:         01:30:26       She gets disgusted. She even gets disgusted. If I sulk in my seat that I didn't get any dude sulking is like, I don't, I'm not gonna sit here and act like I know what turns women on. But I can tell you the exact opposite of turning a woman on. If you want to have the exact opposite, Spanish fly would be sulking. Nothing makes a pussy dry up like sulking. Just let you know right there. Okay. Um, but nothing that makes it wetter with complete indifference. Um, anyways, once she said callously Oh, after she did, after the guy went down to her and then she, he didn't get a blow job. She wants callously said, have a blank to alleviate my horniness after having her completely naked on my chair worshiping her and pleasuring her holes, Jesus Christ body. Thank God I'm that yelling. That one right there where it kicked me out. Uh, it was just me with the Styrofoam Cup. Another time when we had intercourse, we were drunk. She stopped me halfway through and she even stopped halfway through,

Speaker 10:         01:31:37       uh, shit doing you a favor hand job. She's never made me come. These are the only examples of when she tried to get me off. And I'm a good looking chappy, so it's not that. Recently I boycotted her body. I said, let's be friends to be strictly platonic. I won't even play with her. NORCS I'm guessing her titties. Uh, this is, this has had the result of her trying to rekindle things like the old magic. Um, if she's not that into me, what the fuck is going on? I'm finished with her. But any insights you can give is a treasure. All right? First of all, dude, you're not finished with her. Um, just halfway through writing that you probably realized what a PSAP you were being. All right. Okay. First of all, who's couldn't? Who you're, you're fucking with the psycho. All right. And, uh, I don't know if this is a very, this is a very touchy one to talk about here, but, um, this girl strikes me is one of those girls who wants to be put in her place and wants to be bent over something and once a guy to tell her what the fuck is what?

Speaker 10:         01:32:45       All right, okay. Consensually. Do you understand what I mean? Okay. Don't take this the wrong way. Going and just fucking give him a forearm. Give her a forearm shiver. Right. I'm not saying to do that. All right. You know, some girls that concert and they know their account and they want to, got to basically tell them that they, it, it could be this, I have no idea, but I could tell you one thing right now, sulking and keep coming back for more. You like Charlie Brown, she keeps pulling the football and uh, you know, if you want to fuck this girl, walk away from her, stop returning your phone calls and all that type of shit. You, you basically started to do that when you boycotted a body. But then you said, let's be friends. That's a weak move. Okay. What's this girl I think wants to see you be a fucking man. All right. And you're not, you're going down on her. You're pleasing her and she's doing everything. Everything she can to disrespect you and you're allowing it.

Speaker 8:          01:33:49       MMM.

Speaker 10:         01:33:51       And I think that's turning on off. And I think she's a fucking statistics psycho. So she's getting you off as she's leaving you with blue balls, you know, I don't know. That might be it. Or she might be fucking angry at something else and she's taken it out on you. All I now do is walk away from this girl. Just walk away from our birth. Some fucking reason. You still want to bang her one more time. Blow her off, blow off her texts in or calls for like a week and a half, and then randomly answer one. And when you pick up the phone, just just have a whatever vibe. Hey, what's going on? And I being me to, to make calls and me, I to make takes and been busy. What's up? You want to hang out now? Why not? Yeah. You know, I dunno. What do we want to handle you for and get blue balls. You know, you fucking selfish. You're fucking annoying. Leave me alone. You know I was probably too angry but I'm sorry guys. I'm fucking angry right now that I have to talk like this.

Speaker 10:         01:34:58       Yeah, just blow her off and just be, you know, and when you go to meet her, meet her in a public place, don't go over a place where she can immediately, she's going to dress extra sexy when you come over there cause she's trying to get that power over you again. Meet her in a fucking pop place and be talking to her as you kind of glancing around the room, you know? So what I hit on another girl while she's standing there, I'm telling you it out and when she asked you to go home with their, don't just say I'm cool or whatever, you know, fucking blow her off and if she ever calls you again, she wants to cook, hang out or whatever, tell titled to come over to your place. And the second she starts acting like a Douche, kick her out. I don't know. I had shit. It's what sucks about a girl like that as immediately. You got to try and get into her head. Then you got to start playing games. It's not worth it. There's, there's too many decent girls out there who will, when they take the dick out, they will fucking complete whatever you want. So I would just walk away from her.

Speaker 8:          01:36:04       MMM.

Speaker 10:         01:36:06       Let's be friends, Jesus Christ, body that and sulking you need to take. Those are the two parts of your game. You need to work on this off season. All right? And then maybe next year you'll get the ring. Okay. Good luck. All right, next one. Bill. I'm a cubicle dwelling, suffocated engineer in Texas. I was rushed through the college machine with all the rest of the cattle destined to find a job, don some pleated Khakis and live the rest, live the rest of our lives and has steadily paid servitude of the man. But a few years ago out of college,

Speaker 8:          01:36:42       uh Oh,

Speaker 10:         01:36:43       but a few years ago out of college and I hated, I think you saying I'm a few years out of college and I hate it. Uh, I wish I'd followed my desire to be some sort of a writer. And after listening to your podcast among others and hearing from friends that I should have, I wish I'd given stand up a shot. Well, now I'm 30 years old, staring down the barrel of 35 more years as a cozy smug engineer, making six figures, but hating five out of every seven days of my life. I don't have any wife or kids, but I feel like I'm too old to jump back into being a starving artist. What do I do? Ah, this is on you. All right? I would never tell somebody who's got a six figure paying job to jump into this fucking awful business. All right? Um, but I would never tell you not to do it.

Speaker 10:         01:37:34       All I got to tell you is you can't half ass getting into this business, all right? Or you are going to be, you think you hate in your life. Now, uh, just picture hating five out of every seven days, except you're making fucking, you're making low five figures and you're old now and nobody wants to fucking book here. And you don't have any wife and kids, I'm telling you. All right, I'll give you this advice. If you decide to become a fucking comedian, there's no turning back. All right? And you got to go into it.

Speaker 10:         01:38:14       You can't even consider quitting. And it has nothing to do with fucking talent and has to do with desire. I'm telling you. Um, that's what I would say. So what I would do if I was you, I would keep my six figure job and I'd start doing some open mics. That's what I would do. All right? And if you feel in your heart is you're standing on stage that this is what the fuck you want to do with your life. I would do it in a second because six figures, seven figures. If you're miserable, it's not going to be worth it. All right? But I don't know if you know you're into comedy, you know, the way I'm into playing drums, drums, or a hobby for me, I absolutely fucking love them. But there's no fucking way I would have always about to climb into a van with three other fucking guys, you know?

Speaker 10:         01:39:13       And he pasta, I'm not going to do it. It just, I dunno. I actually played drums and I realized I didn't have it. You know, I didn't, I didn't have it as a musician and I didn't have that drive. Um, but when I got on stage, the first time I did comedy, I just, I never looked back and I was just like, this is, I'm doing this shit. So, um, they go, so you have to answer those questions. So the best way to do it is to sign up for some open mics. I see how it goes and see how you feel. And like I said, if you feel like that's what you want to do, then I would, I would work towards it, but I would not quit that six figure paying job. Uh, you don't just quit your fucking job. You don't build up your time so you can swing out of that job into some fucking paid gigs.

Speaker 10:         01:40:04       That's how I did it. Um, I kept my day job until I moved to New York City and I had saved up a bunch of money. Um, you know, I had paid off all my bills, I didn't have a car payment, I had nothing. And I moved to New York and I had a nest egg of fucking money. And, uh, and yeah, I've told these stories before. I hate fucking spaghetti. Every God damn night, three pieces of bread filled up my stomach and I just did stand up every night and I just did. I just wasn't doing standup. I was working towards getting better at it, analyzing what I was doing wrong and um, you know, but I would, I would never tell you to quit your job. And I would also never tell you that you can't start comedy at 30 years of age because you can't.

Speaker 10:         01:40:56       All right, so there it is, but at the ball's in your fucking court. All right. Youtube videos of the week. Uh, we had an earthquake here, um, this past week. Uh, best earthquake reaction. This is hilarious. It's like three guys on the MLB network or something like talking about baseball and all of a sudden the hurricane comes. Uh, it's fucking hilarious because people on the east coast don't know what an earthquake feels like a, so they're sort of looking around like, um, wait a second. Is anybody else feeling something moving? Uh, in defense of them? I was one of those little shaken ones. Um, somebody sent some home videos of Peyton manning as a kid, uh, running around whining or whatever. But, uh, I, I'm too hard on Peyton manning. He gets fucking ridiculous how hard I am on this guy. But everybody wind is a kid, but at this still funny as a patriots fan to watch.

Speaker 10:         01:41:50       Um, and here's two that I got. Um, it's called fuck, fuck the police one. And this is hilarious. This is some guy, I dunno if he's in Brooklyn or what, this black dude who knows his rights has been harassed by the police. You can tell his entire life or whatever, but he's screaming at the cops. That's the mistake he makes. They don't arrest him, but the shit he's saying, if he would just say it, if he just said it, I think he would have been fine, but he's screaming it. Uh, and it's really funny. It's actually the sky goes on for like 20 minutes. And, uh, I've said before, it's all about not losing your shit and this guy loses his shit. But I don't think he ever gets arrested, but it's fucking hilarious. Um, and he has a youtube video of the week. This was actually suggested by Paul Versey, uh, Oh will forte.

Speaker 10:         01:42:51       And this is a, a sketch with Peyton manning. Peyton manning is fucking hilarious in the sketch. Um, it's basically will forte, you know, everybody comes walking in there like a basketball team and they're getting their asses kicked and will forte comes in and basically tells people that they shouldn't quit and that he had a coach and they played him the song one time when his team was down by 60 points and by listening to the song and amp them all the way up. And then he basically puts on some fucking song from the 1930s and starts dancing to it. And it's fucking hilarious. Underrated for the week. Will Forte guy is, is fucking hilarious. And uh, please watch the director's cut of macgruber highly recommended that. And what else do we got here? We got the a woman cuts. Guy's Dick off all the four. Brad's laughing at that.

Speaker 10:         01:43:42       And I got one other one here. What the fuck is it? Hang on, hang on, hang on. Um, I'm the worst. The fuck did it go? All right. Oh wait, don't say it too loud. Don't curse too loud. We will eject you from the Sheridan. Um, oh. Future gun owner. I'll creepy game show host. There's another one that we have. Creepy fucking game show host. She used to see this. I can't believe that this guy actually was allowed on air and I showed it to Bobby Kelly and he was laughing at just this guy's fucking, the game show was basically a mother and a daughter. You know something. They already showed this on tosh point. Oh, I really try not to do that because I figured everybody sees him, but we'll put it up there just in case. But Bobby Kelly actually showed me another one. I don't know where the fuck this took place.

Speaker 10:         01:44:33       It sounds like it's in Scandinavia. And this guy calls this kid up to sing a song and he basically just starts kissing his back. It's unbelievably disgusting. Uh, nibbling on his ear in the back of his hair is this kid is singing. It's fucking brutal. Um, alright. Overrated. Underrated for the weekend. Then I'm going to fucking rap this pie. Holy Shit. Hour and 15 minutes. Time flies when you're whispering in a super eight, um, overrated hand sanitizer. I've been sharing the company restaurant with a bunch of coworkers who believe using hand sanitizer is the equivalent or even superior to washing their hands with good old soap and water. It's not the rubbing alcohol and the hand sanitizer kills the bacteria and destroys virus presence on the hand. And that's about it. It does not physically remove the genital grime deposited on the hands after guy has finished jiggling his junk to get rid of the last drops of pests.

Speaker 10:         01:45:28       These people also use other commodities such as the company refrigerator, therefore effectively covering every God damn thing that they touch with their dead penis and vagina cells. All right, that guy, he's not short of descriptive adjectives, a overrated lawns. People dump all kinds of chemicals to make them look pretty. Personally, I prefer a clean water over a pretty long, uh, overrated. The overnight, the other night I decided to have a nice wink and crash out for the night. So I hop on the generic porn site and started browsing. Next thing I know, two hours have passed, I was still awake, hadn't ranked and barely even had a Fleetwood Mac, soft rock, half Chubb, et Cetera. Uh, I didn't even watch a full video, which I think no one really does total fucking waste.
