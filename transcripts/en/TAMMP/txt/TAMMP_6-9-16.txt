Speaker 1:          00:00:00       Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:00:01       Hey, what's going on is bill burn. It's time for the Thursday afternoon, just before Friday, Monday morning podcast. Just checking it on you. Just checking in on your fucking red line in the goddamn levels. Here we bring this down here. Ah, Jesus. I got shit to do today, so let's fucking get right to it.

Speaker 2:          00:00:24       You see these? God Damn digs. Fuck it by him. I found that youtube clip the other day, man, when the fat kid would review food, that was my favorite one. Fat Kid reviews, girl scout cookies. He goes, sees a girl scout mint chocolate chip cookies and I fucking love him, right? He sits there and he teach eight some looks up in the air and then he goes, if some you see somebody selling these goddamn things, fucking buy them. It's one of the greatest food reviews ever. I totally believed them and I want to girl scout cookies. But anyway, so I'm not here to talk about this. I'm not in to talk about that. I'm here as a casual fucking fan of the NBA, meaning I've probably watched seven whole games in the last seven fucking years. And I watched the second half of last night's Cleveland Cavaliers, first the fucking Golden State Warriors, um, in a bar with the sound out.

Speaker 2:          00:01:23       Now here comes my analogy, my favorite fucking moment of last night and this thing, I don't have a dog in the fight. I'd love to see Lebron win a championship for Cleveland. And um, I always like the Golden State Warriors because they, they stuck, you know, and their fans fucking hung in there and I liked their floor and all of that shit in that old piece of Shit stadium they play. And I went to a game there. I went to a game there about fucking 10 years ago and there was like nobody there and they had the sickest fucking live band there. They were playing Herbie Hancock. What does that sound? Well down there and what Bob?

Speaker 1:          00:02:02       Wow Dude, dude, dude at the beep,

Speaker 2:          00:02:06       fucking sickest shit ever ate was way better than mine. I just did the fuck was the name of that song. I got that on my fucking phone somewhere. Oh, Jesus. You know, and I'll play it for you here in a second. Maybe you guys understand what this one is. Herbie Hancock or wasn't watermelon man. What the fuck was it called? Headhunter her be head cock. I'm going to hit pause while I look this up so I don't torture you here. All right. I got, they were playing. They were playing Herbie Hancock Chameleon. I met a professional basketball game. There's nobody there. There's fucking live band is crushing this song right here. Come on, play it for fuck sakes.

Speaker 1:          00:02:47       Okay?

Speaker 2:          00:02:50       That'd be stuck around like, just fucking game sucks. Listen to this band though. They're killing it. Harvey Mason,

Speaker 1:          00:02:59       right?

Speaker 2:          00:02:59       Black people all start moving around. White people start getting uncomfortable and then the guitar player comes in, maybe comes in and the next spot,

Speaker 1:          00:03:12       very calm.

Speaker 2:          00:03:21       I felt like it was in a fucking movie, so I was like, you know what? I love this franchise. You know what this is? This is if you shut, this is what you should be doing. Saying, listen man, we're only going to win eight games a year. Let's fucking get a killer band to come in there and people, can Lisa have a good time? It was a fucking party and they lost by like fucking 30. So anyways, I got, I don't have a dog in this fight and I watched this game.

Speaker 3:          00:03:45       MMM.

Speaker 2:          00:03:47       I watched this game with the fucking sound on that was Herbie Hancock Chameleon by the way, before you try to shit it, point your phone at your fucking dashboard while you're driving down the street. Killing a fucking mother has six. Um, I have to tell you this over the last couple of games that I've watched, like the NBA has fucking changed so much the way Steph curry just runs around the court. Like it's his, like the whole thing is his, it's his fucking showcase when he was sitting on the bench and that dude hits the three pointer and he did that little jazz hand thing.

Speaker 3:          00:04:21       Yeah. Whatever

Speaker 2:          00:04:23       the fuck he was doing, you know, dribbles out the game and then it looks at the crowd, goes, starts fucking screaming. I'm just looking at them, okay, now I know this guy could fucking body slammed me. I'm just a comedian, but I'm talking about NBA player to NBA play at this fucking guy is, he's built like an honor roll student. All right. And I know he can shoot the fucking lights out from behind the three point line. Fine. You know, you do the best she can back there, but you let that little motherfucker just glide down the God damn lane like clear path, clear path. Today's Nba don't touch him. Don't fucking touch him. That guy needs to get his head taken off. Get one of those fucking giant white dudes from fucking eastern Europe, some Transylvania guide. Get him out there. He's got six files.

Speaker 2:          00:05:19       Just, you know, you know what would happen? He do fucking one. They'd be like, Ooh, Ooh. 32 channel. Which the trade or whatever the fuck they call it. Was that a hard foul? Was he trying to hurt his feelings with that fall? Oh, let's go over and look at the tape. What do you think was, was, was his face snarling too much when he did that? Uh, we can't have that. Get him out of the game. You know it's still worth it to fucking do it. Cause I could take back in the day, you know the Rick Ma Horns that John Sally's all at all of these fucking got John. Sally passed away unfortunately. But all of those fucking old school NBA guys gotta be this fucking kid and just be sitting there going like, yeah, there, there, there weren't a half. All right, wait, that guy would have got his fucking head taken off.

Speaker 2:          00:06:07       Do you know if you watch highlights of Jordan all you young millennial fucking Yolo people out there. If you fucking watch him, it's like he's skinny, he's skinny, and then all of a sudden he's filled out. That was because the Pistons beat the shit out of him. EPFL like fucking two, three years in a row in the playoffs. He finally had enough guy had to go to the gym because the NBA reps weren't protecting them. They could come down there. They'd fucking do remember one time fucking bill and beer, one of the, it was like all Samuelson without skates out there who hilariously and the 30 for 30 years to be like, we used to like to try to get in people's heads. It's like, like he was playing this high level fucking mind game. It's like, no dude, you were just out there waiting for people to leave their feet and you'd take their fucking legs out.

Speaker 2:          00:06:53       How'd you come up with that? It's your major in Calculus. Um, so I remember one time he was hacking the Celtics so fucking bad. Robert Parish finally couldn't take it and the players go on up the court and he just fucking gave them two, four. I'm smashes over the head. He chopped them down like a fucking jealousy. Like when a guy who does not a chop down a tree chopped down a tree and it falls into his house. That's the way he was hacking away at Lam beer and lamb beer. Just put both his hands up like, oh, you know, like George Michael when he was with wham and he just fucking went down. All right. He gave him to fucking ruin your friends. Right. And he went down, the refs didn't see it. It was like wrestling. And then when they back they went back and looked at the tape.

Speaker 2:          00:07:38       You're like, yeah, well, you know, we should've called the file and there was no fines. There was no objections, there was no nothing. He just, you know, live by the sword, die by the sword. Um, there was so many of those. I just was thinking of another one that I saw. They just, it just nowadays, you just Curry's out, they just fucking gliding around. He's built like a muppet. I just don't understand in this day and age how that has happened. And the only thing that I can come up with is that the leagues are so fucking guilty that not guilty. Greedy is that they realize that, you know, um, that offense sells tickets to the casual fan. You know what I mean? Like, let's take the most boring game ever. And I'm not talking about horseshoes. I'm not talking about Shuffle Board. I'm not talking about darts.

Speaker 2:          00:08:28       I of course am talking about soccer. Okay. Which the entire world has embraced except for us and when you really look at it, that's probably why we're number one. You know what I mean? The rest of the world is too stupid to realize how boring that fucking game is despite the fact that it's so fucking boring that even their fans have to have campfires singalongs as they wait for something to happen. I walked some matter what age, right? Just sitting there, they're fucking scarves and shit. This is the thing about, Oh man, I'm going to get some fucking emails in this. This is the thing about fucking soccer, right? If they just let the forwards run pass the final line of defense, like in any other competitive fucking gang where it's like, hey, I'm faster than you. I understand like offsides to a point, but it's got to be it just a line like in hockey and then after that, if I'm faster than you, if I can see the play developing before you do, I get by you. I don't have to fucking wait for you.

Speaker 4:          00:09:40       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:09:40       If they would just adjust that and you'd start to have some fucking 10 to eight games, I'm telling you that game would blow up. We blow up here in the United States, we would sit down and fucking watch it. You know why? Because we don't understand the game. You know what I mean? If I was watching cricket right, I guess they score a lot in that fucking thing. That's a good one to just sit around and booze with, but any fucking game than I'm not into. If somebody is crushing it and everybody's flipping out, I'm going to be like, what's going on? I'm going to actually going to sit there and watch it. Like nobody. Like when I walked by.

Speaker 4:          00:10:13       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:10:13       You know in soccer is on, I don't even look at it, but if I hit this guy go,

Speaker 2:          00:10:22       he's doing that. I stopped when I watch, you know, and I read all the fucking advertising's all over there fucking uniforms. I got to tell you, the premier league has the worst fucking uniforms I've ever seen in my life. You can't figure out who the fuck any, it doesn't say man United, it doesn't say Liverpool. It just says Exxon and fucking Joey's fish and chips fucking banks. I heard they're going to do that in the NBA. But anyways, I think that that's what happened in the game. And I know I don't know what the fuck I'm talking about. I'm too fucking busy to pay attention. And at the end of the day I never really excelled in sports anyway. So who better to break down? What's wrong with the fucking NBA then some Sutter and fucking prick like me.

Speaker 4:          00:11:03       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:11:04       I think you got an entire generation of people that grew up playing Madden football and all of this shit and everybody was the globe trotters. And now that just doing like the real version of it. All right. I love Steph Curry. He's the greatest shoot I've ever seen in my life, but watching him just glide down the fucking lane is ridiculous, which is why last night after the fucking whistle blows, he just decides like, Oh, I'm just going to fucking, I'm going to take a little lay up here.

Speaker 4:          00:11:29       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:11:30       You know right next to Lebron James. And I loved that Lebron blocked it and looked at him like, what the Fuck Outta here? That's what they need to do. All right, you're not going to beat these fucking guys play in their damn game trying to out shoot fucking three pointers or whatever the fuck it is they're doing. Granted, I washed it with the sound down in the second half. Um, they need to fuck they got it. They got you. I'm telling you, they got to give him the old right there for it. That's what they got to do. Okay. That's what you do. If the other team is faster, the other team fucking, you can't, you have to play fiscal. I'm not saying play dirty Pittsburgh Penguin fans. I'm not saying you hire a fucking knee breaker and, and the career of the best player on their other team.

Speaker 2:          00:12:12       I'm not saying that. All I'm saying is when the guy comes down the lane, your whole team should be yelling clearer path, you know, and this guy looks like he's in the fucking globe trotters. Um, now, now that I'm done with that little fucking Soliloquy, most of that was based in what happens is you get older, you know, and you start realizing your own mortality. And there's a couple of panic thoughts that you have is, you know, the world is churches. Oh, I'm gonna die and it's gonna keep going. Part of it was that, that the game has changed. You know what I mean? I am kind of the old man going, why can't they have shorts, shorts again and close line somebody. It's amazing. Somebody balls didn't come out like during that Rambus play. It's unbelievable that his junk didn't come out the side.

Speaker 2:          00:13:04       He fucking literally did. Like, you know, like, uh, he did, he was doing like a Thomas flair in the air and do it. I actually retweeted the other day, it was enough game Jack Sigma elbows, Kareem Abdul Jabbar in the fucking like right in, right in the right. Inhale solar plexus zs to say in wrestling. And Kareem had to like fucking just run it off like, fuck. So whatever happened on the play where the sea, uh, the sonics hit the shot or not, they're going back up to court or whatever. No, they didn't cause what's his face? Sigma was still setting up. Corinne walked back into the play and just got a little in front of Jack Sigma turned around and punched him right in the face. And sigma had that great hair, you know, that hair that like moves around if he get hit, you know, he had whip lash hair, the white version of it.

Speaker 2:          00:13:56       We had Thomas Hitman Hearns had the black version when he fought, uh, when he fought Marvin Hagler. You know, if a black guy, he's going to get punched in the head in a boxing match, you want them to have a Jerry curl because it just adds to it. When all that liquid just shoots off his fucking head. And Jack Sigma had the white version of it where he had basically a Beatles haircut. So it just enhances, you really get to see like how much you know, whiplash, somebody who's enduring. Um, all right, there we go. That's just the end of it. I, I, you know what, I'm going to, selfishly, I want to see seven games, um, and uh, I would like to see, all right, one teams of finesse team, the other teams of physical team, I don't want to say any dirty play, but I don't see one team, you know, putting on their Tutus and trying to out fucking spin the other team. Right. Isn't that what I'm saying? Then you know, sorry, I'm trying to plow my way through this podcast. So they got to go a table reader. You want to join the podcast? He just coming in to say hello. No, I just called Tuesday. Has a day. Not Today. I got one more day and I'm doing today, but tomorrow it's your birthday. Oh yeah. Where are you taking me? Chucky cheese.

Speaker 2:          00:15:17       I get to work here. Come here. I do. I feel about it. How do you feel about your birthday? This is a weird one. Why? Because usually at my advanced age, I start going like, oh God. And I was this number. Now I'm that number, right? This one. I, I don't, I've just sort of, uh, you know, somewhere when I, during my year of being 47, I realized it's over what's over my sex appeal. My, uh, my dream of being one of the People magazine's 50 most beautiful people. Uh, yeah, that might be in the latter rains, but a sex appeal I think is, oh Geez. Is everybody gets a ribbon nowadays. Um, so I just have settled into a, I went and I got glasses the other day. Yes, he did. Cleo, get out of there. That was a grape nuts. Those are not for you. Go Fat.

Speaker 2:          00:16:16       She's getting fat. She's fat. You're fat, and you're not going to get a date. No one's going to love, you know, I've been so busy, I haven't been able to walk. Grab a microphone here cause you're going to drive people nuts off off the thing. Go get a call. You're gonna drive me nuts cause a microphone in the closet. Huh? I feel like de Niro and knock and I'm Goodfellas now kick on right down there. Yeah, it was scaring me, Karen. Um, no, this one I'm just now like, I'm Kinda like, all right, I'm old now. It's all about, and because I had sight, Erica, Erica, um, I realize now that all I give a shit is that if I just can sit down and not have pain, I'll be fine. And I want to thank everybody that's have given me all their, their, you know, remedies and all of that stuff.

Speaker 2:          00:17:21       You know, it's funny. It's, yeah, it's funny as hell how they fucking do it, where it's, it's done with love, but in a Twitter way, like, hey fuck it. Just if you have Sciatica, just do this. Get or get one of those foam rollers and roll out your [inaudible]. And it's like, I did that, I did that, I've done all of that shit. I actually went to the chiropractor again yesterday and he said that the swelling on my spine has gone tremendously. I am now on the next level of healing. Well now I don't have pain. I just feel like, uh, it's a little tingly sometimes my foot falls asleep. I've been doing these stretches. A buddy of mine at work got in this. You don't like do any of those things where you hang upside down? Yeah, he got one that's actually not legal in this country.

Speaker 2:          00:18:08       Um, but you they sell it in Canada, Canada and you just basically, uh, you're more hanging from like your waste as opposed from your ankle. Dad was talking about, my dad was talking about the one where you hang from your ankles. Yeah. And what my chiropractor was saying was that that one, it puts stress on your joints cause you got your whole body weight, puts like your ankles, your knees and your hips because your whole body weight with this other one. He had loved that thing though. Yeah. I don't know. A lot of people love it for whatever reason, but I've been using the other one and that one would be like, uh, say like you're at the zoo and you're at the gorilla and closure and you want to bend over and look for the dime. You just fucking lost. Very timely. Just imagine that except you don't fall in is the thing and an adult, if an adult fell in there, would they have shot at with a tranquilizer thinking that maybe the adult could handle the fucking thrashing that he was going to get?

Speaker 2:          00:19:04       I think that they had a, would have had the presence of mind to like slowly try to back out of the situation as opposed to a baby that's just kind of like sitting there. Can you give us an example of how you would slowly back of a situation with the gorilla? Alright. You fallen, I god, what would you say? Hey Man, like easy, easy. Well, you know, I'm terrified of primates. Like they just freaked me out in general, so I don't really know what I would do because I just feel like, oh, I know what I would do common like Dna wise or something with a chimpanzee than they do with a gorilla like date. That freaks me out. I know, I know exactly what I would do. I don't like it. Actually I would curl up in the fetal position and I would cover up my face so he wouldn't rip it off and I would just be like, if I got to take some gorilla fucking kidney shots, I would much rather take the ESV comes over and just fucking whales on me, like from fucking ankle to the side of my head.

Speaker 2:          00:20:02       I will take that before I will. I will just stand there with my face out waiting for you to rip it off. Well I do they, yeah, I mean I feel like that's probably the best way to go. So they don't see you as like a threat or something like you just sort of submit to them or something? I don't know. But then I don't want them to be like, I'm sure this information is on the Internet wife now. Like it's just so weird. I don't know. They just, they really freaked me out. I remember when we went to Australia, you know they're going to grab you by your ankle and just drag you around like a fucking, like they did that little kid. I haven't watched it. Oh, remember when we went to Australia and I was telling they have video of it. I don't want to watch that.

Speaker 2:          00:20:37       I did. I did watch the, one of the naked guy that walked into the line and closure and he's trying to kill himself and the fucking his, his neck is in the guy in the fucking and naked. I mean, I was talking about that on the TV. Oh my God. Yeah, a little. Yeah. It's like, go ahead, grab my neck, but I still got a cup of my junk. You still got to keep your boxes on, right? No, but this is the thing. The thing was just handled by his neck. But you survive. Yeah, but cause I, they must have just fed the fucking thing. So it just had him around the neck. She and the guys literally, he's got his arms around the things that blinds neck and then he's basically in any wrapped his legs around his body. He basically had it in the guard, like a Jujitsu guard and the fucking lion around his throat, but he wasn't shaking him or anything. And everyone like, you know, going, Oh my God, I'm a God and you know, whatever fucking language. What if a country was in their film in the guy, that guy was completely fucking naked and um, yeah, he obviously had like mental issues because if you're in sound mind and you kill yourself, you just like jump off something, right?

Speaker 5:          00:21:38       Yeah. You don't wander into a land on somebody naked Volkswagen Passat. Wait, but I wanted to say when we went to Australia that time, were you with me when I was in that monkey exhibit or whatever, and it looked like planet of the apes and it was freaking me out. And then we went into that other little side room and there was a monkey behind the glass and everyone was looking at it and taking pictures and he started rocking back and forth and I was like, that thing is about to freak out. And then it threw itself up against the glass and like screamed and yelled and everyone was like, and then the other chimp came in. Yes. And like tried to come and I hugged it. Yeah, we thought they were going to fight and then they embraced each other and then they like put their backs toward the glass with one of them's arm around the other. Like it's going to be okay. Like we're going to get out of here some day. Like it was so emotional and it was so scary. I just, I can't, I don't know. I can't deal with it. Like that scene in the trailer for Tarzan, the legend of Tarzan or the monkey comes in and like see as the Tarzan and the bassinet and then picks it up and then leaves with it as just like, I don't know. I don't like that shit. Yeah. I just think it's really weird. I mean,

Speaker 2:          00:22:48       if that was in the wild, they would, they would eat that baby and they would actually leave it, keep it alive as long as they could because they enjoy the screaming cause. It

Speaker 5:          00:22:57       is that true that they get off on it, man. Two chimpanzees are fucking evil. Grill is a chill. Gorillas don't have anything to prove. Chimps have the short man's disease. I feel like men are a little more chill

Speaker 2:          00:23:09       and then he got those tweaker monkeys. Yeah, right. The meth head ones. Those ones that throw their shit out. Yet

Speaker 5:          00:23:14       the chimpanzee was the one that like threw itself up against the glass and was like really loud and screaming. The other girl is seem a little bit more peaceful. Those are the ones that are handsome. Like you saw that one gorilla that everyone was freaking out about in the zoo in Japan because everyone thought it was like a good, it's actually a very good looking gorilla, but yeah, that was weird. It was really weird. You will never find another gorilla like me. I, yeah, like sexy gorilla. That's why they freak me out there. So human like that is just, it's unsettling to me. And I don't like when they make gorillas have agendas like that commercial where the little girl is deaf and she's doing sign language with the other gorilla. It's like all,

Speaker 2:          00:23:59       oh, rang a Tan. What? One Orangutan? My hope is that that's the ones that, look, if I was a fucking chimp, that's what I would,

Speaker 5:          00:24:06       oh the ones with all the stringy hair. Orange ones look like old men, but they're like sign language in each other and it's like, oh that's sweet. Like they're communicating through sign language and then all of a sudden that orangutan is like, oh, but like the way you live is destroying my life. And it's like, wait a minute. And it was like for about palm oil or peanut oil. And it was like, don't get the monkey. Everything's fucking cause now did you see, I told you this morning, I didn't see that. You get it, but don't bring the animals into it. And deaf children, like I just felt like that was his fucking monkeys with their agendas. I didn't,

Speaker 2:          00:24:45       I didn't see the clip. It's, I just, I just read about it. Some reporter as Bernie Sanders, the fact that he's staying in the race, they asked him if he was being sexist by staying in it. Yeah. Like he couldn't handle lights into a home. And why is that sexist for him to stay in there? Because the reporter wants Hillary Clinton. They want him out. They want him out. They want Trump out. Even Republicans like where the money's at thick. They are going to accept Hillary Clinton before Trump and before, um, uh, Bernie Sanders. And what I love about Trump and Bernie Sanders was it showed that enough Americans are sick of the standard Republican Democrat. Like Hillary Clinton is the standard fucking Democrat. She's got the same money in our pockets. The Republican, the General Republican candidate would have had. And he goes, all the fucking guys that was running basically, um, and it's, you know, it was just, that means just the 1% is going to get more fucking rich and going to push down the middleclass the same fucking bullshit. They're going to stay the course. They don't want somebody that's off to the side. I got, uh, I just had a scary thought. What was that? Trump president?

Speaker 5:          00:25:52       No, I was thinking about, I don't know that around your president now, that orangutan thing. And I just literally got a picture of an orangutan. Yeah. Like I said, Tang, like the drink of my whole life isn't an orangutan. No, it's a rang a Tan. It is. Nobody's, I don't think that's true. Well, oh wait, is it rang a Tan. I just, it was making me think of planet of the apes where it's like take over. Oh yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:26:21       Yup. And I got to made everybody made fun of what's his face fell and potato with the knee. I always did potato Po. Tay told, I think I used to smell, I mean spell tomato with an e at the end. Cause the, the toe. Yeah. It's like there's a toe.

Speaker 5:          00:26:37       So are both dumb. Well that's why we found each other. That's right. Because

Speaker 2:          00:26:44       there was no one to be on the date going like, oh my God, this person's an idiot. We were both going like, wow, this person gets me. I'm excited for your birthday tomorrow. You'll never find Doo Doo Doo Doo Doo. Yeah you are. You're very resigned this year. I've noticed even now talking about it as much. Oh, cause I'm in the writer's room. I know what's going to happen. My birthday. I'm going to fucking go to the writer's room and stare at a computer all day. Oh yeah. Well if this person says this and then called back to that story til still track. Yeah, that's, but they'll probably give you a cake at the office. No, cause there's somebody's birthday was yesterday. That was the oh yeah. You guys have some of these first date. Today's the ninth and mine is Friday. If they get a cake, you know, if they get me a cake, it's because they all want cake.

Speaker 2:          00:27:37       No. Um, no. I know what I wanna do for my birthday. What do you want to do for your birthday? Um, tell me. Well, you know, in a perfect world, my back would be fine and I'd take you up in the helicopter with an instructor. Of course, you know. Oh, that would be fun. Yeah. And we'd fly over the ocean and I'd be singing where no more nurture our Lord. The more I would do that. My name is John Dacre. My name is John Dacre. That's my favorite fucking thing ever. I just more than any question in the world, [inaudible] Mori, what's the first religious song you sing? So, Oh, I'm Rosa Lord, or it was really good. It goes when he ends up here.

Speaker 6:          00:28:37       Oh

Speaker 2:          00:28:40       Hey had a fucking meltdown. He was on TV and he just got in his fucking head and I don't think he'd ever been in his head in his life that he's a really cerebral guy and he couldn't understand that for the first time ever. His head, his brain was failing him. He was really looking around like, I'm just as confused spot this as you are. Did he choked and I feel like in church or wherever it is, because the woman playing the piano, she is like, I guess she gives lessons in that town and I, I'm sure that in charge he kills it, but then he's in that public access duty. I don't think it kills her camp. I think he can change changes, like just he can carry a tune and they bury them with like 40 people around them. Right, right, right. He's probably still weird. What kind of car you think he drives? It's something very old and something like tragically unhip it's Brown. Yes. Brown. He drives a brown, a brown interior. Like it's just brown on Brown. Yeah, it's like an old Pontiac Bonneville.

Speaker 2:          00:29:48       Then old Napoli. [inaudible] my name is John Dacre. My name is John Dacre. Let them fuck. There's so much. You guys have to see this. No, no.

Helix Hallux. I don't know. Uh, your helix. Sadly. Helix. Helix. Your unique. You don't walk like anyone else talk like anyone else or sleep like anyone else. So why is your mattress one size fits all? I don't know cause we're all basically the same height. You know, unless you're like an NBA freak because a truly customized mattress will cost you five to 10 10,000 bucks until now. Now, now my name is John Dacre. Go To Hague, calyx sleep.com answer helix, sleep.com I keep thinking of the band for a answer, a few simple questions, and they'll run a three d biochemical model of your body through the proprietary algorithms they've developed with the help of the world's leading ergonomics and biomechanics. It's like just a troll me biomechanics experts as a mistake or you know why? Because my brain is already gone. All right, so they take a three d image of your body and then that's on the Internet somewhere, right? It's a custom mattress. Yeah, but any information goes on the Internet. People can hack in, so someone hacks in and see what they take that five 11 right now and then they make some blowup doll of your body and then someone's fucking a rubber version of the Pacific with the Ville. Birthdays. All again.

Speaker 2:          00:31:42       Yeah. This is, I have a theory about the internet. I don't give a fuck what it is. Somebody's jerking off to it. I don't care. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:38:22       eh. Okay.

Speaker 7:          00:38:45       Hey, what's going on? It's still the Monday morning podcast and, uh, I'm in Raleigh, Durham airport. I don't know if it's, I think she had the balls to call this an international airport. I'm not sure. I don't think it's international cause the lines went that long. Uh, that's one of the dumbest things I've ever fucking said. Let me consider last. And the lunch went that long. Really? He didn't see anybody on a fucking Jeannie rug. So you don't think that flies anywhere else? You idiot. All right. I'm not in a good mood. Why? Bill? Why aren't you in a good mood? I'll tell you why. Because a hair cut them in Raleigh, North Carolina. There's no fucking connects. There's no direct flights to Los Angeles. So for some fucking reason, high after God, The lady with the voice either hang on a second. Every five seconds. Yes. Okay. All right. Okay. Terrific. Phone message. You don't have a cell phone with friends who have that number.

Speaker 7:          00:39:52       Unbelievable. Pick up a courtesy phone. It's so fucking stupid. Everybody has cell phones. Why would you use that archaic form in an airport? Okay. Whatever. Uh, anyways. Yeah. So I'm in Raleigh at the, I want to get to La for some fucking reason. I have to fly to Cleveland first. And, uh, it's annoying enough when you have a connecting flight, but you know, why can't it be in a city that's at least going in the, in the direction that I want to go. I'm going to go fucking West. I want better. They make me fly north. It's a little bit west, but you know, at the end of the day, it's fucking north going north of the Mason Dixon line, you know, Mason Dixon Line just to keep, uh, yeah. What is that late in the lady's talking so fucking loud over there.

Speaker 7:          00:40:46       Why is it, you know, in society, why can't I just like, can you just lean over to her right now and just be like, hey, Hey lady. Hey. Yeah you do. Could you shut the fuck up please? Or at the very least get you talk a lot quieter because no one gives a fuck about whatever the fuck it is. It, you're yelling about it, but you stupid fucking board meeting. You know what I mean? Who the fuck are you talking to? It's fucking, I guess it's 10 25 in the morning. You know what's annoying me? And she's talking really loud and her eyebrows are at full fucking mass. Uh, Jesus. Is there anybody even listened to these announcements? I look at this person by, she's got the, uh, the p diddy syndrome or the Shaquille O'neal Syndrome. You know those, you know those people. Uh, okay. It's on a Cosby shirt.

Speaker 7:          00:41:46       You know those people who fucking, their mouths are open even when they're not talking. I call that PDD syndrome. Is that what you call it? Bell? Yeah. That is what I call it. All right. I have a flask of time on pm that I'm going to be, I'm going to be taking, but I can't take it because I have a connecting flight. So I'm going to stay awake till I get to Cleveland. By the way, my flight to Cleveland is delayed, you know, they said because of wind, you know what I mean? Really rough wind, which I don't really understand. You know, it was like, isn't that how the fucking plane gets off the ground? You wait for a gust of wind and you drive into it, you know? I mean, granted, I never took a physics class. I was getting you. I know you got to know how to fucking plane gets off the ground, which is one of the reasons why have such a fear of flying take.

Speaker 7:          00:42:36       If I actually understood it, if anybody listening to this could actually explain in layman's terms how a fucking 10 ton piece of metal with a bunch of people in various forms of physical convinced condition can get off the goddamn ground, actually get out, gets off the ground. I just don't understand how it stays off the ground. Like I can get off the ground, I can take a running leap, you know, and for good 0.8 seconds, I am actually airborne, but I quickly come crashing down to the ground and roll my fucking ankle. You know, it's kind of like a boat to how the fuck does a boat not sanction. You know what I mean, Dave, you just displace the weight across the water and spill. I don't, I don't, you know, then a bunch of people get on and then it still doesn't sink. It just goes down into the water a little bit more.

Speaker 7:          00:43:31       All right. I think we've established that Jesus Christ, look at this guy, he's dressed, he's got some guy, he looks like he should be yodeling. He has on khaki shorts than about five inches above his knee. Chancellor of Brown, low cut suede hiking shoes with ankle below the ankle. Black thought he just needs like, I think, what do you call it? A shaft. One of those sticks with the, with the curl on it. Jesus Christ. He's probably going to a whorehouse and just looks like he has some sort of twisted fetish and wonder what's in that briefcase. He's drinking coffee, but he's trying to appear normal. Um, anyways, if you're a new to this page, this is the Monday morning podcast. I do one of these every single week I hype upcoming gigs, I rant about bullshit and people send me questions and I tried to answer to the best of my ability and uh, yeah.

Speaker 7:          00:44:36       And that's about it. And I gotta admit my computer is tucked away in my bag and I don't know what the fuck the questions for the second, second week in a row. You know what it is? I have one of the, I have one of those g four Max. I'm at my laptop was about four years old and uh, actually have legs on it, like an old TV and a and an antenna fucking old. All right. And uh, the battery evidently is defective. So, uh, when I turned it on it, it loses battery power and about nine seconds, actually it will say I have 75% battery power. And then it says, um, two seconds. I don't know what the fuck I'm talking about. All right, let's just get to the shit I have coming up in my career. I had stand up on the guys' choice awards for Spike TV and that is going to be a, it's going to be airing on June 22nd Sunday night on Spike TV.

Speaker 7:          00:45:35       Uh, it's actually a pretty big award show. I was very amazed at the level of a celebrity that was there. It's like Harrison Ford, Cameron Diaz, Jeremy Pivot, you know what I mean? Spike TV, no offense. But I thought it was going to be like Lee Majors and Micky Dolenz uh, and me, you know, that's what I thought I was going to be. And then I showed up. I was like, Holy Shit. You know, sent Steve Carell's. Yes, it is. Isn't that amazing? And uh, I was not sitting seated at his table. I was uh, I was seated at a table. Well I dunno what the fuck one, one guy was a reality show director and the rest of them were a seat filling horse. I think. Um, at least that's what it said. And then the name tag. Um, so anyways, all right, let's get to the podcast questions that, uh, that I can remember.

Speaker 7:          00:46:32       Ah, fuck with the announcement. And he retains [inaudible] fucking airports. They make you hate. Have you got the in flight is delayed. I'm actually looking a horrific thought I had at the day. I have the USA Today taper in front of me and, uh, one of the pictures they have is of, uh, this guy looks like he's in the bowling Joey. I can describe them all right? He's got a checkered shirt on with a t shirt underneath it. And uh, he's about up to his man tits and water hanging onto a rubber raft that has some, uh, coast guard looking guy in it. He's basically too fat to get in the fucking boat. Um, and he's walking along and it said Midwest storm turns deadly and it says seven reported after tornadoes and heavy rain pounds states in the heartland. So I'm like, wow, that's, you know, at least I'm not fucking up to my man tits and a rainwater, you know, it's probably eels and fucking water moccasins and shit.

Speaker 7:          00:47:47       But then there's a part of me because there's so many goddamn people is a kind of happy, you know, wash away a few, let the traffic go down a little bit. Isn't that a fucking terrible thought? But I actually, I actually think that shit underneath that it says a FDA's tomato warnings grow. This is all the happy news I've looked at today. Outbreak of Salmon Nela from raw tomatoes spreads to 16 states with up to 150 people reported ill. You know, now a lot of people would look at that like that's a bad thing. But I look at it like, look, those 150 people fucking die from eating tomatoes or at the very least get some horrific cases of diarrhea or they're not going to get into a car. Uh, you know, the roads would be a little bit clearer. You know, somebody, I guess, uh, this is all the happy news. They don't have one fucking happy thing on the front page. What do we got here? US gas average $4 and rising and then they have a cartoon picture of a hand squeezing a house with money falling out of the bottom.

Speaker 7:          00:49:01       You know what the funny thing is is if they didn't even bring this shit up, I wouldn't even know it was happening. Who would know that housing houses were fucking, uh, the values dropping? How would you even know that if they didn't bring it up? Why don't they just stop talking about it and we'd all walk around like Happy Idiots. We've continued to spend our money in malls and they won't be a recession. You know what? That might be the second dumbest thing I've ever said. You know something? I really resent the way fucking pilots got to dress like they were on the love boat. You know what I mean? What is that? What is that awful fucking uniform? Now? Of course he's going to sit next to me so I can't make fun of them. You know what I mean? I hate like the, the, the, the, the shoulder pads with the stripes on them. You know what I mean? You could if they just came back from battle as opposed to a round trip to fucking Seattle, you know what I mean? I don't know. There's a golf shops at target, you know it's going to go shiny golf shirts on and most Seinfeld white sneakers.

Speaker 7:          00:50:08       You know what? There isn't one well dressed person in Raleigh, Durham airport. I keep thinking everybody has on a Cosby share, but it's the same fucking guy. He just keeps pacing back and forth. So every time, you know, I look up, he's on my right and then I look, looked down, I looked up, he's on my left and I think it's a different guy ladies. Definitely a mother you got here. What? The little personal size pizza, mothering, hips swinging to and fro. That guy's a psycho. Look at him. He's got a backpack. Probably tried to hike the Appalachian trail. Get fucking Ricketts. Umm. All right. So, uh, yeah, the fuck was I talking about? My girlfriend wants to see Kung Fu panda. That's what I have to look forward to when I get back to la. Just want to see it. God damn cartoon about some fucking martial arts.

Speaker 7:          00:51:05       Why would it fucking pen to need to learn Kung Fu? You know what I mean? Why would it need, how to throw kicks when everybody knows that a bear naturally just has that like you. Have you ever see like a watch discovery channel? My show up bear killing like a, uh, I don't know. Fucking Yak, whatever. What the fuck did they kill an elk or deer? They don't come up and grab it by the throat. All right. All messy. Like all those other predators, they have the bears come up. They have like that, that fucking, how do you describe it? Got fucking bionic bitch slap. You know what I mean? Just Bam. Just breaks their neck. So right there, that's the grizzly bear proof equivalent of the one inch punch. We've stopped yelling.

Speaker 7:          00:51:56       I think she kind of heard me on that. She's literally looking at me screaming, can you hear a voice? She's one of those fucking women. I hate women who were like 40 years old and they talk like the eight probably like guys kill their wives while they just get sick of their voices. God, what a stupid fucking thing to say. You know what? This is the bills and more on podcast today. I'm just done a bad fucking roof. Fucking plane was supposed to take off at 10 15 and 45 I got some 40 year old lady with a kid's voice screaming and then I got the the pie. Oh fuck. My plane's here, Valerie, that, you know, it's funny, the plane that I'm flying from Raleigh Durham International Airport, Esquire is uh, actually it looks like the kind of plane that Tom Cruise flies by himself. You know, I always get excited when I see those cause I imagine that, you know, I'm a fucking rock star and I'm getting on it by myself as opposed to the fact that I'm getting onto it with 40 other people.

Speaker 7:          00:53:04       This is how fucked up Raleigh, North Carolina is as far as a airport goes. The plane, I actually flew down here from New York City and I flew down here on I, yeah, a plane that had propellers. I'm not even lying to you, but it was a new plane and I was like, wow, this [inaudible] still going with this. You know what I mean? And it was one of those, there was so few people on the flight that I was sitting in like feet five a and they go, sorry, excuse me, excuse me there. And I'm like, bitch, fucking bitch. What? Excuse me, bitch. And she's like, sir, I don't need to listen. I'll get it. And say that that's what I was thinking. I just said, I said, uh, I said yes, but the underlying, the way I said it was like, what? And she's like, I need you to move to the back of the plane so we can redistribute the weight.

Speaker 7:          00:53:58       You know what I mean? And it's like really, you basically telling me if I don't go to the back of this plane that it's going to like what fucking tip over when we go, when we go to take off. That makes me feel as a customer, you know what I mean? But you know, they don't give a shit fucking hilarious. She makes me move back, but she sits up front, you know what I mean? And when that stupid little fold down stewardess chair, it's like, why don't you sit in the back? I'm a customer. Okay, I want to stay here and this lady to dress like my fourth grade teacher. Wow. Black on black pants to Bruce Lee Kung fu shoes and a shiny pink blouse underneath it. I Dunno if she's dressed like my fourth grade teacher or a Nancy Reagan one or the other hand. She did you dress like a first lady?

Speaker 7:          00:55:00       Uh, all right. Wow. Ooh, let's go with this talking. Oh, he guides in the points. That's why shirts so bright. So I shared so bright and his mustache is so short. That girl does not trim her Bush. You can just tell, just tell us going all natural. I don't know what it is about her. That lady there has an above ground swimming pool and her husband. Yeah, we're going that shoulder tattoo. I fucking nailed it. I know it. Above ground swimming pool made stuffed crust pizza guy there was good at basketball cause he's in shape. He's black and he has dreadlocks right there, which means he's like the sixth man ever noticed that the black dudes with the dreadlocks, they like rebound guy. You know what I mean? There's never been a Michael Jordan style player with dreadlocks, dreadlocks. And you play in the NBA. You, uh, you get like fucking 12 rebounds a game and uh, knock out 12 old ladies with your fucking elbow.

Speaker 7:          00:56:03       I don't know what. All right. I ran out of references there. Wow. Capri pants, Khaki Capri pants, they ago. You're married. There's no reason to give a fuck anymore. Why would you dress like that? Look at this black guy. Hey, go. Huh? He's still doing with the extra baggy shit. Wow. That look was like 10 years ago. Remember that one black guys would go to footlocker and they would find those, uh, quadruple fucking XLT shirts even though they were five foot six. I always thought they look like a, you know, like after you bang a broad over there in the next morning, now she gets up and put some money, a tee shirts. Uh, all right. I'm just making fun of people, not because I'm like, well, I am kind of a con, but I'm just making fun of him because I don't have my podcast questions in front of me. So, uh, why don't we hide some upcoming gigs and lady looks like Robert Plant from behind. Oh, it's the same fucking lady. She's got all kinds of lists going on. What happened to Robert Plant Man, Jesus Christ.

Speaker 7:          00:57:06       Like, I look great right after age 46 and all of a sudden now he looks like he should be in like a children's book. Like, like one of those, uh, it looks like a troll. I don't know what a fairy tale. That's what it looks like. Robert Plant looks like. It looks like he's in a fairy tale. You know what I mean? Is this, this is a cruel thing about life is even if you stay in shape, life is still going to make you look awful because for some reason, even if you stay at your high school, wait, your fucking head never stops growing. So if you don't get a little out of shape, if you look fucking ridiculous, you look like a, I just lost my train of thought. The fire stop taking this time on a pen.

Speaker 7:          00:57:54       No, you're not. You look like if you, have you seen that fucking guy? Uh, he's like 45 years old and he's shredded. I might have talked about this last week again with the Mike Epps had, um, you know that guy late, late at night. He does all the physical fitness shit. He's like 46 years, years old and he's shred it, but for some reason he still looks weird and it's his head because his head, I know it's not the head, it's your fucking knows it's your ears or something like that. Something about your head. It just keeps getting bigger. Like classic example is Ted Kennedy. Okay, Ted Kennedy's been in the news lately, has got a fucking brain tumor or something. Right. He will get that guy's head and the 60s for granted, all those Kennedy's had big heads. You know what I mean? It's one of the reasons why two of them got, got, got assassinated.

Speaker 7:          00:58:50       It's like there was no way to miss I, that's just fucking me. It really is. But I got to tell you something, man. I saw Ted Kennedy, I shook his hand one time and his head is as big as the seat that I'm sitting and he has been the biggest fucking head I've ever, it wasn't, it was unbelievable. I was just staring at it. I couldn't fuck. And I got a big head, but this guy's fucking head was huge. And, uh, you probably want to, how did I meet him? I actually, uh, I fucking shook his hand and Bill Clinton's hand, the long fucking story. Just remind me, I'll tell it to you next week. Let's stay on track. You without biggest fucking head is, I just kept looking. I just could not believe, decided like I just want it to like a, I wish there was a way to just like hold his head just to see how much it weighed.

Speaker 7:          00:59:48       You know, I, I'm not even joking. I bet his head ways like, like 27 pounds, 27 fucking pounds. When we think about that, you know who got the less weight, you know that when you're doing your warmup set and you grab like, let's go with 35, the 35 pound plates, you know, you can do with one hand. You know what they should have. They should have like a part of the strong man competition. So those little kettle balls there, they should have like little Kennedy hats and each one of them gets a, it's a stupid idea. You know that, that's why I don't have a fucking show on TV. All right, let, let's, let's get the, get the hype and the upcoming Gig. Um, first of all, I just was in our Raleigh, North Carolina at a good night's comedy club. I want to thank everybody who came out to the shows.

Speaker 7:          01:00:40       I had a great time. And, uh, I got drunk every night down at the bar downstairs and I watched my Celtics go up two games to none and a, I'm not going to lie to you, I didn't know how much one Celtic game all year. I fucking hate pro hoop pro who is the worst? Like it's just too God damn long. You Watch college basketball. It's exciting. The crowd's into it and it's over. It seems like it's over in an hour. Pro Hoop with, with the fucking files and the timeouts. And I mean, that's final five minutes, final five minutes. It takes like 45 minutes to play to the point. You don't even give a shit anymore. But, um, I put to the test to Phil Jackson for bitching about the files. You know what I mean? Fucking baby. I can tell you right now, if your gamma definitely bet on the Lakers, you definitely bet on the Lakers on game three because they are going to call 9,000 files on the fucking Celtics because Phil Jackson's a fucking baby.

Speaker 7:          01:01:44       You know what I mean? Give me a goddamn break. What? What about that guy in the Lakers who stop dribbling at half court? Ran The west rest of the way and dunk the ball and they didn't call travel. And what about that? Okay, you'll get in calls to, I don't want to hear it. Um, and also the two, three, two playoff system is bullshit. You know what I mean? You give home court advantage to the fucking visitor through game five. It keeps saying the Celtics have home court. They don't. The next three games are in la. We get to spend a fucking weak out there. Me, I had, he made tension. Please would the person who has the current next to the deal jail please report to the fucking front office. All right. I'm starting to talk way too loud with Tourette's. Um, I dunno man.

Speaker 7:          01:02:32       I thought the Lakers were going to beat us and like six games. I thought they were going to crush us. I'm really impressed Ray Allen keeps getting his shots. Uh, we're just going to have to weather the storm. I think Colby is going to get 30, 40 every game. And if we can just somehow, whether that storm, uh, I dunno, I still think it's going seven games and uh, I dunno. It's gonna. It's gonna be great. It's going to be great. I just don't watch ESPN any most fucking jackass. So overhyped everything. Look at this lady, Jesus Christ. She's never committed a crime in their life and gave my cat, I go to church every week. I have a little tote bag. It's like the egg and I pack the exact perfect amount of clothes. I don't swallow. Um, man, I'm getting crude on these podcasts. I got to stop with this.

Speaker 4:          01:07:25       All right,

Speaker 8:          01:07:27       I'm on a good plane. Why would I want to get off it and switch and roll the dice and get on another one.

Speaker 4:          01:07:33       Okay.

Speaker 8:          01:07:33       You know, let's just fucking get there. When it, when I drive up to San Francisco, I don't pull over and fucking, uh, Burbank and then get hit one another cup. We get it bill. All right.

Speaker 4:          01:07:45       Okay.

Speaker 8:          01:07:46       So I get on the fucking plane, right? I use my miles, bump myself up like a fancy person. You know, maybe, maybe I invented the cheesecake factory. People are thinking and then they see how I'm dressed and I go, oh no, he didn't invent the cheese cake factory. Um,

Speaker 8:          01:08:02       and I go to go to sit down on my seat and I go to set my bag down and I was going to set it down right in front of me and the Nice fellas sit next to me cause why don't you stick it in the middle, this room? And he moved his bag out of the way. I'm like, all right, this guy's a solid dude or whatever. And then all of a sudden the waitress by a stewardess, whatever, she comes by, flight attendant, whatever the fuck you supposed to call them, she comes up and she, uh, can I get you gentlemen and Drake? And I was like, yeah, I can, I get a, let me get a water please. Ice or no ice. What? However you make it.

Speaker 8:          01:08:32       Stop acting like it's a fucking Martini. It's war, right? Just give me a water with ice. Thank you. Um, and the, the guy next to me, he orders it doers. Neat. No, I, no nothing. Just put it in there. So they bring our drinks. All right. And I'm really thirsty. So I start sucking mine down and he just throws his back. Like it's nothing like fucking John Wayne right before he's going to turn around and beat up three guys, three mustachioed guys in the 1930s. Right? So, um, I'm just sitting there and everybody's getting on the flight, you know, and I'm looking around at the passengers, you know, fucking doing whatever I'm doing and all of a sudden the guy next to me, Mr doers goes to me. Uh, he goes, excuse me? He goes, are you afraid to fly? And I looked at him, I was like, what? He goes, are you afraid to fly? And I go, no, no, I'm not. And he goes, he goes, all right, but you know, it's, he goes, it's okay. It's okay to tell me if you're afraid to fly.

Speaker 3:          01:09:38       Okay.

Speaker 8:          01:09:40       And it's immediately getting weird. And I'm like, no, I'm not afraid to fly. And, and I'm thinking in my head, wait, is he afraid to fly? And that's why he's drinking the way he just drank. And now he's hoping that I'm going to be afraid to fly. So he, you know, he just wants to open up. That's what I'm thinking. And I got, I'm like, yeah, no, I'm not afraid to fly.

Speaker 3:          01:10:02       Yeah.

Speaker 8:          01:10:03       And he won't leave it alone. He goes, all right, cause you know, you're, you're, you're fidgeting, you're looking around at other passengers.

Speaker 3:          01:10:11       Okay.

Speaker 8:          01:10:11       And I'm sitting there looking at it like, is this guy fucking serious? And I go, no. I go, I'm not afraid to fly. So now I'm like, fuck this guy. I'm not talking this guy for the rest of the flight. This guy's weird man. It's like a 30. Just get paint the pictures like 32 year old winery in shape, but like, why are we white dude, he's got a skully cap on with fucking glasses. Um, you know, and uh,

Speaker 3:          01:10:40       okay.

Speaker 8:          01:10:41       He goes, uh, like there's like a minute of silence and people still getting on the plane and then he goes, hey, sorry about that. So we, we just, we just got off on the wrong foot. He's like, my name's So-and-so. He goes, what's your name? And then I'm thinking in my head like, what's my name? My name's frank. I wanted to give them like a f by just some reason I just wanted it's bill. And he goes, oh, hey bill Nico's nice to meet you. So we shake hands and I'm just looking at, I don't have any poker face. I'm looking at the guy like, what the fuck is your problem? I'm not even trying to not, I'm not trying to be pleasant. I'm already done with this guy. So then the guy goes, oh, hey bill. He goes, why are you going to Indianapolis Bill? Right. Like he's fucking interrogating me and I,

Speaker 3:          01:11:24       okay.

Speaker 8:          01:11:24       I'm like, is this gonna fucking serious? And I start doing the math in my head going, when is this guy like an air marshal or something? And I'm like, no he's not. He's fucking slamming bows over here. Fuck this guy. So I just go, I go, look, I don't, I don't have to answer your questions. That's it. And I just look straight forward. He goes, okay, now I'm concerned. Okay, I am concerned and I'm looking at, I'm like concerned about what he goes, you're fidgeting your, you, you, you have issues with other passengers and blah blah blah blah. He's such a Peyton like, like this. Like he's been, I don't know what the fuck, like psychologically breaking me down. All right, so now at this, by this point, they've closed the fucking the door to the fuselage and we're starting to taxi.

Speaker 3:          01:12:16       Okay.

Speaker 8:          01:12:17       And I just finally look at the guy and I go,

Speaker 3:          01:12:22       okay,

Speaker 8:          01:12:22       I go, you know, I came up with the five one point. I literally stick my hand out cause he kept saying I was nervous and I stick my hand right in front of his face and I hold it level. Well that's what I did the first time. Yeah. I hold it level. I go, I'm not nervous. And he goes, well, anybody can do that. And that's when I was like, fuck this guy. I'm not talking to the guy. Sorry. Fuck this story up. Then Denny Denny came back, got my name. Now he's going, why are you going to Indianapolis? And I find, look at them. I say, listen pal, I'm drinking waters. You're drinking doers. Okay, there's no issue over here. And then he goes, it wasn't doers. What she gave me wasn't doers really. What was it? Some sort of spy juice. You fucking jerk off this point.

Speaker 8:          01:13:02       I want to punch him right through his fucking stupid wirey glasses. Right? So he's going like, you look around hostels and I said something that just ticked him off. I was just you that dude I got, I don't have to answer your questions. All right, leave me alone. And then he goes, uh, he goes to, he goes, he starts going like, okay, now I am really concerned right now. He goes, why are you going to Indianapolis? And I just look at him. You know what I start doing? I start doing like this Ryan Gosling, you know that little smirk that fucking Mona Lisa smile he has is his smarts his way through all this fucking movies. I do go. I go full on Ryan Gosling. Now I'm not talking to this guy and I just keep looking at him and I give them that little half was smart and I just shake my head.

Speaker 8:          01:13:43       That's my game. Now that's, this is Mike. It's like if you're going to be a Dick Right now with your fucking delusional authority, right? That you're going to like, we're in fucking Guantanamo and you've got to waterboard me. Ah, there's no water. There's no board. Go Fuck Yourself. Here's my smart, and I'm just going to shake my head at you like you're a fucking pathetic human being. This is what I'm doing, right? And this is the funny thing. I'm such a Dick. All I have to say to the guys, I'm a comedian, I'm going to do a sold out show there and that would make them back off, but I'm a dick. I'm like, fuck this guy. I want to see where this is going. So now he's all fucking amped up and he starts droppingF , you know she's saying the f word. He sitting there going, if you don't, he goes, you don't fucking answer my question right fucking.

Speaker 8:          01:14:25       Now I'm going to hit that call button was sitting there, taxi and down the fucking getting in line, I'm going to fucking hit this fucking button if you blah blah, blah, blah, blah. And I'm just fucking Mona Lisa. Smile smirk in just shaking my head like you are a fucking retard, right? So now he sees saying the f word so much. The lady who's sitting in front of me diagonally in front, right in front of him, turns around and looks at us, and now my heart's racing. I'm like, where's this going? This is going to be great. I am a hundred percent fucking innocent. This guy's drunk, and I think he's going to hit that button. He's going to hit that button. What's going to happen? Right? I want to see what the pilot looks like. Let's see where the fuck this is going, right? So he goes, you'll fuck you.

Speaker 8:          01:15:07       He starts eating such bringing his hand up to the button going, I'm going to hit that button. You don't have to go fucking do it. I'll hit that button and I'm sitting there smirking and I'm thinking in my head, go ahead and hit the fucking button. Let's see what happens. Let's see what happens. Right? So finally, now he wants to hit the button and he can't fucking find it, and it's an in defense of him. I couldn't find it either. I was looking up there, I half wanted to hit it myself. Then he finally, he finally finds it and he hits it right? And now I'm just like, Holy Shit, what's going to happen? And he's sitting there going, yeah, Huh, you want to fucking play this game and you want to fucking play this game? And I was surprised. I mean it took like fucking like 30 seconds before a flight attendant, the one who gave him the booze, which evidently wasn't booze comes over.

Speaker 8:          01:15:50       And at this point we're like doing that shit where we're behind the plane, we're almost ready to take off, like we're pulling up and then stop and pull it up and, and stopping as planes are taking off. So she goes, yeah, what's the problem over here? And he goes, ah, I'm not comfortable to fly with this guy. This guy, he's fidgeting, he's looking around at other fucking people, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. He's doing all this thing right? And then the stewardess looks at me and I'm just sitting there fucking my little smart, just shaking my head and I just looking at this dude just shaking my head like, this guy's out of his fucking mind. I don't say a word, and this guy goes on and on and on about his fucking psycho babble about how I'm the security risk. So she goes to, so she goes, okay.

Speaker 8:          01:16:29       Um, any other passengers? Have you noticed anything? She's talking to everybody first class. This is, anybody noticed anything odd about this guy and the lady who was sitting right in front of the dude diagonally from me turns around. She goes, yeah, I've been listening to this guy, bright berating this other passenger. She's on my side and I haven't said a fucking word. This is great. And I'm just sitting there smirking. Then they'll let students looks at me and I shrugged my shoulders like, I don't know what to tell you. It's a finally she said, sir, do you have anything to add to this? And I just said, look, I'm just a guy trying to go to Indianapolis. This guy over here, he starts slamming his doors. I kind of felt like a rat when I said that. I go slamming his doors. Next thing you know, he's dropping the F bomb to me. Then I'm thinking, oh fuck. I just said bomb, right? Fortunately, nothing happens. So now another fucking the male stewardess comes over right now, he's going like, what's going on? And the captain of the fucking now at this point we've pulled over in the plane, has stopped.

Speaker 4:          01:17:37       Okay.

Speaker 8:          01:17:37       250 people trying to get to Indianapolis and jerk off over here who can hold this fucking alcohol who just watched a person of interest every, every August. Evidently I have no fucking idea. Now the plane is stopped, is fucking jerk off, has stopped the plane interrogating a Goddamn comedian. Like I'm in the fucking Taliban and like he works for the CIA, right? So now we're just sitting there and the captain is up front in the plane, like saying to the stewards is going basically relaying, do I really have to fucking come back there? This is the last flight of the night. Is it really a God damn problem? And that was the vibe. And they finally said to the doe, sit next to me, are you going to be okay to fly with him? And at that point it appeased his fucking ego that he was somehow in control. And he goes like, you know what? Okay, it's fine. It's fine. It'll be fine. It'll be fine.

Speaker 4:          01:18:37       Yeah.

Speaker 8:          01:18:37       So they go, okay. So now the plane's going again and now we're now, we fucking come around and he's sitting there fucking, he's in my ear and at this point I am la like to fucking laugh. He him, me doing the podcast, that's what I'm doing. And he's sitting there going, I, he goes, you know what? I'm glad. I'm glad. I hope you fucking do. I hope you fucking try something. I'll be fucking try something. One more update. I really hope you fucking try something. And I'm just fucking like gut bust and laughing, shaking it. Like, what are you going to fucking do to me? What are you gonna do to me? How are you going to punch me in the face? You fucking winery jackass. You get fucking glasses on. You know, that's a federal offense. You're going to go to jail if you do that or something.

Speaker 8:          01:19:19       I Dunno what, right. So I'm just in a fucking laughing at the guy going, I actually, at one point I put my fucking little I pill thing on. Do you know, like I'm going to sleep. Oh, I had that out too. When the stewardess was talking to me. I was like, putting it on is this total mind fuck. Like I don't know what this guy is. I'm just trying to go to Indianapolis. I'm going to sleep. And um, so I got, I got my fucking eye thing on, right as he's sitting there threatening me, just I was going with total passive aggressive. It's like, dude, I'm so not concerned with you. I'm literally putting a blindfold on. All right, so this fucking guy, he starts going, he goes, yeah. He goes, you think you're fucking one this, you fucking won this. He goes, my, you know, my dad is my dad. He started saying his dad, some major CEO in Indianapolis, doesn't sound like a fucking made up story. I swear to God, this is all true. He Goes, Mike, my dad is such a major CEO in Indianapolis and I'll have you fucking arrested. And The lady turns around again. How have you fucking rested the second weekend on the ground? I'm thinking like for what? For what?

Speaker 3:          01:20:21       Okay,

Speaker 8:          01:20:22       sitting here, you fucking loser. Learn how to hold your alcohol. Right. And he starts describing the view that I'm going to have when I go to jail, like some fucking law and order episode. Oh, you're going to love it. You'll be able to see Lucas oil field in battered by the bar. And I'm just sitting there cracking up laughing and then there's this pause, right? And I'm thinking finally he finally shut the fuck up. It's like a three, four minute pause. He finally just gave up because I wasn't giving them anything. I was just laughing and shaking my head. I was being a dick to him. I was cause I was enjoying it. And then there was like a three minute pause and then all of a sudden he just goes, why are you going to Indianapolis Bill?

Speaker 8:          01:21:07       So we're like 20 minutes into the flight and am I going to be honest? He's, my adrenaline was so going during all of that because I knew I didn't do anything wrong, but I thought we were literally going to go back and there was going to be fucking cops there. And if like, if, if, if, if the fucking stewardess or the pilot asked me who I am and where I'm going, I'm going to tell him I respect your authority. You're just some, Gee, I don't, you don't have any fucking authority. I don't have to answer your questions. It was pro was one of the most fun experiences I've ever had with another human being. Like when somebody thinks that they have power and you know, they don't, and all they can do is try just keep bluffing and raising their voice and start cursing at you. And if you just start laughing at them, the look on their face is fucking priceless.

Speaker 3:          01:22:02       So

Speaker 8:          01:22:04       blessing. He said, he said, why are you going to Indianapolis Bill? Right. And I fucking started howling, just fucking holding my stomach, shaking my head and with my fucking eye pillow thing on right. And I know I'm going to get a ton of shit that I wear one of those eye, they're fucking underrated. Get the one at Brookstone where it's literally a pillow. I'm telling you, you could fall asleep 12 noon facing the sun. It's awesome. So anyways, like after he asked me what, what, you know, where are you going bill? You're like, there was like a 10 minute, like probably 10 minutes had gone by and I can't fucking sleep because it's so fun. And to me I can't wait to tell the story. Every comic I know, I can't wait to try it on stage to see if it's funny or whatever. Uh, so finally I just like our fucking, maybe I'll just get on my computer and I bring up my pillow and I like, I got to look at the guy cause I know he's fucking staring at me, waiting for me to do something right. So I lifted up, I get my fucking Lisa smile going and I look over at the guy and dude, he is fucking passed out.

Speaker 8:          01:23:14       He looked like he got shot. He was sitting there like his head was just hanging straight down and anytime the plane move like his head was, I mean he looked like he got knocked out for the rest of the fucking flight. All fucking uh oh. What's Matt Damon's character? Jack Ryan. Hold fucking Jack Ryan over here. It's just, you know the sky marshal, the fucking bows bag and God knows what else he was on. He was just completely out passed out for the rest of the fucking flight. And this is why I want you to dick. I am. I was having so much fun with this guy. I start, I can't sleep. So I start slamming waters because I want to have to get up and take a piss just to see if this guy's going to freak out because this security risk is getting up and this is, the joke was on me.

Speaker 8:          01:24:04       He never regained consciousness. And then I really had to take a Piss, but I'm such a stubborn fuck. I was holding it because I wanted to make sure he was awake when I got up, cause I was going to give him a little smirk and then I was going to get out to see he hit the call button again. Um, but he did, he didn't wake up till we hit the ground and um, and then it's funny, then he woke up and it was like four hours later. So now he had kind of slept off, whatever the fuck this guy was on. Okay. And I'm sitting there SmartQ and wait for the guy to start talking. I mean he won't look at me and I, and I think at that point he kind of fucking realize that maybe he got a little, uh, a little extra little too patriotic.

Speaker 8:          01:24:47       So we stop, we stopped at the gate and everything and we're going to get up. So I grabbed my shit. I get up and I'm just kinda looking at him and he won't look at me. And then the lady who was sitting in front of me, I had this big smile on her face. She goes, hi. She goes, how are you doing? I don't want it good. I go, there I go. That was an interesting one. And I said it really loud. So the guy heard and he didn't say anything, and this is what he did to try to save face. His pillow was kind of stuck behind this kind of stuck behind his shoulder and like a weird place. So he was frustrated with it. So he ripped it out from behind him and kind of threw it down on the floor when he tried to do some caveman grunt to try to still have some sort of, yeah. Uh, I don't know what, so, so that was my flight to Indianapolis people. Um, you know what, how, how far into the fucking podcast down here. It was a long, that was a long fucking story.

Speaker 4:          01:27:43       Yeah. Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:32:05       I will.
