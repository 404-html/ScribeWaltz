Speaker 1:          00:02          Hey, what's going on? It's bill burn. It's time for the Monday morning podcast for Monday, July 30th, 2018 what's going on? How, AH, um, I'm a little bit late here with this podcast. Um, you know, I was out there and Houston, Texas for two nights in Dallas for one and I want to thank everybody that came out and uh, the weather was great. It wasn't that hot, you know, I mean it was hot, but it wasn't like Texas hot when we flew into Houston. I saw, you know, a nice green fucking grass and that shit, I didn't realize Houston was right on the water. I always thought you still had to drive like an hour before you get to the Gulf of Mexico. I don't think I ever looked at that. And I know a lot of, yeah,

Speaker 2:          00:48          Ooh, boom.

Speaker 1:          00:54          No I didn't. I didn't want to watch a bunch of people losing their houses. Did you watch it with your fucking popcorn before there was that disaster? Did you know that it sat right on the Gulf? Unless you live there, that's actually, you know, something. Every time I go to a, um, a state, I kind of look where everything's positioned in and it's self fucked. How, like your brain remembers it, Nick. I always thought Austin was in between Houston and San Antonio. Turns out it isn't,

Speaker 1:          01:23          it's north just northeast to San Antonio on the 35. And then like a, you know, fucking San Antonio and Houston and kind of parallel with one another. And of course, Dallas is all the way up there on top Dallas, Texas, where the heat is real and the titties ain't. Um, I had an awesome time when I was up there. And guess what, guess what old freckles has done? He hasn't drank this whole month. Oh, did he want one last night? But he didn't. Um, I'm going to, yeah. This is my new thing. I'm drinking the way I smoke cigars once every 10 to 14 days. If I do that, if I do that alone, I will cut down on my drinking by at least 172%. No, I don't know what I would do. Um, that's the game plan. So I got a little, uh, little, little Shindig August 7th. Then I go right back on the wagon until fucking, I'm gonna try to go back on the wagon. That's the hardest thing for me. Once I go off a whole daddy's playing the game again. Oh, he's, he's in the game. You get a little dirt on his beautiful. Um, yeah. So, uh, Nate Craig was out there with me crushing it every single night. And um,

Speaker 1:          02:43          I dunno, don't have anything bad to say, but it was weird. It was weird going to Dallas and that's sending a vignette texts. Other than that, it was a good time. Um, all right. They're just bum me out. Why would I bum you up? Good News. Hey, you know, something, his taste is something that you, you might not have known about me, but since when you were in my presence is, I swear to God, if I wasn't a comedian, I could have been a manager. Well, at least I could. I could have been a talent scout, you know, telling you how many more do I have to call? Remember long time ago I said, you know, I've been watching this drummer on Instagram at the pocket queen. Well, that drum is going to be sitting in with the Seth Meyers show all this week. What did I say?

Speaker 1:          03:29          Go ahead. Go back and look at the old podcast. Listen to them. We're just right there. I could have done it. I could've brought the red socks out of there. Fuck at age six, year curse earlier. If they had me as a talent scout, I could just see now I can't see it in sports. I can't see everyone. Whatever, you know, you don't. It really is. You make a fun fucking thousand guesses and then one of them comes in and then what you really do is you just brag about it, which is, which is what I'm doing. So anyways, I'm back out here in Los Angeles. All right. I'm sitting in a very progressive manner.

Speaker 3:          04:03          MMM.

Speaker 1:          04:06          You don't want to watch. Last night I watched a couple episodes of, uh, Seinfeld's new, uh, comedians in cars. You got to see the Brian Regan won the Dave Chappelle one is awesome. It's Dave Chappelle. But this Seinfeld one, the car that Brian Regan likes, I actually like it too, but it's a 2005, like two Cedar Cadillac or something like that. The level with I on all the episodes. I've never seen Seinfeld shit on a car. Like he shut on that car from the way it looked to the options to describing the person that was going to drive it. Um, and then Reagan of course it was Reagan and he was fucking hilarious. But I was kind of hoping he was going to bring up how much he did not care for Brian's tastes and cars. But you should check it out if you get a chance. So anyways, is my story.

Speaker 1:          05:00          So I'm in Houston, right. And I was supposed to fly up to Dallas and once again I fucked up. I wanted to fly into love field cause that's the smaller one in Dallas, the and whatever, that fucking Metro airport, whatever the hell it is. It's gigantic. But this time I actually went through Dallas airport and it, it was, it was really easy. Oh I know why. Because that wasn't connecting, connecting through Dallas. She always got to get on that fucking monorail. And I swear to God, if you're, if you're in terminal B, your connecting flight is in terminal a and you always have to go all the way around. You always miss it. Just buy one share. You could grab your bags and start running through the airport, you know, like Oj Simpson back in the day, I guess, you know, maybe that's an option.

Speaker 3:          05:44          I don't know. Um,

Speaker 1:          05:47          so anyways, I was going to fly from Houston, but uh, Nate didn't get a ticket, thought we were driving up, so it was like, God, fuck it. You know what? I can't remember last time I took the 45 north up to, uh, from Houston to Dallas and uh, canceled my fight flight. We just fucking drove up there. And um,

Speaker 1:          06:09          I gotta tell you, man, that is a, uh, it's an intense state. Dallas, Not Dallas, Texas. I mean, I mean, there's just like nothing out there and then all of a sudden you just, you finally fucking come on something. You get so fucking excited. Some sort of barbecue. Joy, Mike, Mike and I, we should stop there, man. You're the middle of nowhere. Everything starts looking good. Look at how they got fireworks. Let's pull over man. Got To get some of those. I haven't seen anything. Any sun is civilization for the last fucking hour. Uh, but we ended up stopping at this gas station where they got this checklist, Slovakia, Aki and a Slovakian. I don't want to start any fucking wars over there. Um, little, uh, dessert thing that they have that some people put meat in, some people put fruit in it or whatever. And I only see him in Texas. It's usually when I'm on the 35, right around Waco, Texas. Um, I was joking about that guy all weekend. You know, Joel Olsteen.

Speaker 1:          07:12          I was teasing those people down in Houston going like, I can't believe you guys were surprised that that guy didn't let you into his house when the hurricane cave. He's, he's selling out a basketball arena talking about Jesus. Do you think this guy's even remotely honest on any level? Let's do that thing where I had my eyes closed going. Jesus doesn't want you to step on my blue rug. I'm talking about David Koresh anyways. Was that was named David Kresh. Really good looking guy, man. You remind me of that guy that who started in California, California occasion. He's also written, uh, um, the x files. David Duchovny, sort of the David Duke Company. Sort of understated by with them with like Richard Gere's here. What was that? I got more of a Rambo haircut, you know, I gotta look it up now.

Speaker 1:          08:08          Be like, if you could go back in time, we go hey to the cops, right before that guy went nuts. Hey man, you got to get this guy. He's saying he's Jesus. Oh, what's he look like? Uh, you know, he kind of looks like a skeletal Rambo Haircut like David did. Covenant with just a splash or Richard Gere. Sounds like a cover of people magazine from Phuket, 1989. Um, what, what are you looking up, David Koresh? The K factor? He definitely would have got the plane ticket to Vegas. Look at the guy. You know what I mean? If you tick off those fucking glad. He looks like he could have done that. Bjorn Borg story is what's going to freak me out. How long did this guy live from 1959 to 1923 Oh Jesus.

Speaker 1:          08:57          Oh, he's 33. You know those Jesus freaks. That's when they like to die. That's when they like to die. Oh Geez. Is died at 33. So if I fucking die too then that means I'm just as his father or to make no sense. I thought it was going to come out on Sun anyways. Um, so I'd been eating perfectly the whole weekend and then I stopped and I got a couple of those uh, with, I didn't know what the fuck they called. Checklists allow Hannis I'm going to get you the name of them. I can't find it. It was called like a collage or something like that. I can't find it. What the fuck? Come on. There it is. Kol a c h e. Oh my God. That the delicious. Hey Nia. Wait, who's that? Hey. Hey Buddy. Oh, you've got your book. You want me to read you a story baby? Oh, is it? Hi Buddy. Hi Buddy. Can I get a kiss?

Speaker 1:          10:09          All right. Oh, the boss baby. Did you guys like to listen? A little freckles Riccio kids book. Oh, you did? Okay. I don't touch that. Don't touch that. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Thank you. I appreciate you showing me that was there. Yeah. I have to do a podcast, man. I don't know if I could do this right now. All right. From the moment the baby arrived, it was obvious that he was the boss. Yeah. He looks like he put mom and dad on a round the clock schedule with no time off. Thank you. Does this seem familiar Kiddo? Um, bombing with her right now and then he set up his office right smack dab in the middle of the house. She's not even listening to me. I have like no charisma here whatsoever. She's finding the crap on my couch way. My interesting, he made demands many, many demands. And you've got a little Trump suit on and he was quite particular. No, I don't like that. If things weren't done to his satisfaction, he had a fit. Well, it sounds like these parents need to pooch kick him into his crib. He conducted meetings lots and lots and lots of meetings. Hey, I eat, are you interested in this at all? I had to get back to my podcast.

Speaker 1:          11:26          Keep reading. All right. Many of the meetings happen in the middle of the night. The funky thing, when was this written, Marla? Prezi. Is that an old black woman, Marla? The funky thing that came out of nowhere is it the 70s read the book. He never ever said a single word that made any sense, but that didn't stop. She wants to run around. Do you want to look at this? I just feel like everybody's fast forwarding through this. Oh, whoa. All right. And then daddy went back to his podcast. The end. Is that cool? Bye. Okay. Um, yeah, I have to get back to a particularly excrutiatingly unfunny podcasts. I'd been recording anytime I start and I start like promoting something or whatever the hell I just did. I had it. My whole brain just goes out the damn window. Do you want me to read that book again? Okay. Sorry guys. This is just part of it. Not The boss baby by Marla phrase from the moment the baby. All right, let me get back to this. So bye bye bye. Say I love you.

Speaker 1:          13:01          There you go. She can't say it. She just goes and Yang, Yang, Yang, Yang. Um, she yesterday after, uh, I flew back from Dallas, um, I landed at lax and I met a friend of mine, believe it or not, um, who owns one of those Vietnam era fucking helicopters, the Huey ewh ones. And uh, he was there with this instructor and they picked me up in the thing. I literally at least sounded like I was in fucking apocalypse now. And um, you know, he flew around off the coast of Malibu and all that stuff and then we landed at this small airport, got some lunch and then they let me fly it. And uh, it was amazing. You know, it's funny, they, old people always said, if he can fly in our 22, you can fly anything. Um, they are 22 is the little egg beater that I fly and it's kind of like driving a car.

Speaker 1:          13:52          I would say like no power steering or power brakes. You, you're really doing it. Um, but despite all that, anytime you get a new helicopter, it's like, it's not just like, no, if you would just to like, if someone was to like taxi it out for you and you just took off, it's very easy to fly anything. But it's like when you come to a hover, you know, and you're doing little turns and stuff and trying to set it down on the pad. I don't, I don't know. That's when I sit there thinking like that, you know? Okay, you might be able to fly it, but I don't think he can maneuver it. Well. So, uh, we just did it some pad work and then I flew from a camera Rio all the way out to, uh, to Burbank. It was amazing. It was fucking amazing. And um, I want to thank my buddy Phil. Let me do it. Not naming any names or any of that crap that was speaking about helicopters. Everybody keeps telling me I got to see that new Tom Cruise mission impossible. Doesn't it seem like my podcasts lately that I'm throwing in advertising. I swear to God I'm not. I watched that movie. Uh,

Speaker 3:          14:57          okay.

Speaker 1:          14:59          Uh, the, uh, the death of Stalin yesterday on the plane. Jesus Christ. I don't know who the hell wrote that man. How do you turn that guy into a comedy? But somehow they did with those fucking hilarious, um, two of my favorites of all time, Steve Buscemi and a Jeffrey tambor or rent it. They are absolutely hilarious and I wish I knew the name of the one of the other league cronies there.

Speaker 3:          17:50          you know, I was like,

Speaker 1:          17:53          like, it seemed like I was, I had to go shovel somebody driving. Once they get out on the stage, I'm fine.

Speaker 3:          17:58          But, um,

Speaker 1:          18:00          actually I'm probably fine the whole time, but I'm just like, uh, just the thought of it, two shows never bugged me. Three was always like, all right, what the fuck? What am I working in a mine here. I thought he got into show business to have a nice easy fucking life here.

Speaker 1:          18:37          Just crawling around, playing with my daughter. All of a sudden just my knee all of a sudden felt like really? I don't know what hot, stinging pain, but it's not constant and it's only when I put pressure on it, so I don't think that it's bone to bone. Thank God. I think I've been active enough to have that shit. This is one of my favorite things to do by the way, is to let you guys know what some of my ailments are and then you guys all just turn it. The doctors. It's one of my favorite things. Go. Do you know what that is? It's actually your kidney. Hear me out. One time there was this guy, right. And it just fucking goes into that shit.

Speaker 1:          31:33          other than that I could hug Bob Right now and tell him that it was okay that he took that couch off the sidewalk.

Speaker 1:          33:33          All right. Let's get to some of the uh, questions for this week. I guess that's what we'll do. We'll do a couple of questions and then we'll, I can go back to some more advertising if I can actually figure out how to read it. All right. Russia feeling left out. Hey, your bill bur rough. Uh, I've been listening to you, you talking about your upcoming Eastern European tour in the latest podcast, but not hearing about any stops in Russia leaves me quite scarred and traumatized every time the podcast ends. Is this guy making fun of millennials or how soft Americans are or are millennials a worldwide problem? I mean, what's the deal with leaving us out? Stand up is very popular here right now. Stand up in Russia. I mean, you allowed to talk about anything. I can't see going over there doing a Vladimir Putin fucking impression could I?

Speaker 1:          34:24          Then what happens? All of a sudden somebody sprays some mist on me and I'm sure you can easily pack a full show several times over in places like Moscow and Saint Petersburg. Uh, besides think of all the experiences you can have in the Oji Vodka capitol of the world. It's dirt cheap with the current exchange rates. The cities are beautiful and quite different from what you see anywhere else. The people are friendly, welcoming, and fun loving. Was this written by the KGB or is this really a regular person? You never know. I mean, we haven't gotten along for a long time. I know it kind of died down for a minute, but you know, it's always going to be Yankees and red sox with us, unfortunately. Um, to be honest with you, dude, I'm actually, I was talking to my agent about trying to add Moscow, um, which I shouldn't have said because not everybody is always trying to add it. And then if I don't, then I'm a fucking asshole. Um, anyways, he said, I know we have a bad rap currently. Even heard, you mentioned that gay people and journalists have been killed here, which would be laughable to us if not so many people believe those stories.

Speaker 3:          35:26          Uh

Speaker 1:          35:28          Oh, you don't think, oh my God, am I who's living under the right media bubble? Anyways, but let me ask, just ask you one thing. If you're so skeptical about trusting the media in your everyday life, why go around and believe what that same media is spewing about other countries? Not Saying you should take my word for it. Come and see for yourself. Hey, come on over, Bill. We're not killing anybody over here. Grab it. Make your own decision and the meantime, give a little gift of laughter to melt are cold. My strikes, chef, loving hearts. I don't even want to say it. Have a nice day and go fuck yourself. Oh Man. Um, no. I would love to fucking go over there and uh, I dunno what the fuck the belief, but I do know this a, we're not the only one's lying, you know? Okay. It's don't believe the American media, but believe my media about my country. Well, I guess maybe I should believe. I mean, look, I don't think I would if I went over there. Yeah, it would be honest. I Dunno. Maybe you're being honest. Who the fuck knows? You know, I think we should just grow up and joined forces. Um, okay. A RP. Oh, hi bill. I've heard on your podcast that you was, oh wait, by the way, have you guys seen the Vladimir Putin fucking goes out and plays hockey and they're just letting them score right and left. I got a fucking post that video, you know, that's that type of shit. You know what I mean?

Speaker 1:          36:55          Like do you think they'd let Donald Trump score? They probably would,

Speaker 1:          37:01          but we always had that thing all, they're not like they're letting them score cause they don't want to get sent to Siberia. Um, a high bill. Hey, you know something? I would like to hear from more Russian people. I want you guys to infiltrate my fucking podcast here. Like you did the last election. Oh, a hot take. I don't even know if he did that. Um, I have no idea. I don't pay, I don't watch the news. Um, a ARP, hi bill. I heard on your podcast that you received a r p invitation to join. The biggest benefit we get from arp is that it is a very large lobbyists for us. Old People. Please join. Thanks. Oh my God. Did I just joined a group? Um, yeah. For those of you didn't listen last week I tr uh, I'm 50 years old now. Mooc makes me qualified for Aa, our P and I can, I can go to the movies for like $8. You know, I can get a custom cane walking cane or something if I want. There's a whole bunch of things I can do. Um, I'm actually, you know what, I was on the road and I saw there was an email. It was something I needed to fill out.

Speaker 1:          38:09          Um, anyways, plowing ahead further. You know, I gotta be honest with you guys, I'm always honest on this podcast. Last night, yeah. Had this little square of fucking weed and she goes, take a bite of it. I got, I hate eating wheat. I don't like eating it. And she goes, no, just try as like, I don't, I don't want to do. So she talks me into it. I'm eating dinner and I ate the fucking thing and I never really felt anything. And about 10 minutes ago on this podcast of a sudden it fucking hit me like 12 hours later. You know, I'm not like fucking tripping, but I think that's why I was reading like x, x, x, x twice instead of once. I have no idea. I thought this shit is supposed to make it clearer.

Speaker 4:          38:50          Okay.

Speaker 1:          38:50          I really Miss Booze. I mean, you just kind of know what's going to happen. Like what, what's going on right now? Is this like some Bruce Lee shit. It's my brain swell up now and I just keel over on my own podcast. Um, anyways, nutrition.

Speaker 1:          39:05          You goofy, bald headed baldheaded potato looking. Fuck Jesus Christ. You're harsh in the mellow man. I know. You were looking to go to a nutritionist for advice. Be warned. This industry isn't particularly well-regulated. Yeah, I know. I know. It's terrifying. Basically once they, they have that degree, they don't have any oversight like real doctors. If they fuck you over, there's only so much that you can do. Well I could sue them, but the already saying they don't have the money of a doctor. So what's the point? A here's what you should do. A find a nutritionist that provides advice based on lab work. Most of these cuts we'll just have you keep a food journal and then give you advice based on what you ate over the week. This is stupid and it can be both misleading and inaccurate. Not to mention expensive lab

Speaker 1:          40:01          for finance person that provides advice based on lab work. Well, I mean it's, it's can't you just fucking sit there thrown out stats. Four to five doctors recommended this has barriers. Um, anyways, be whatever product they get you to start taking. Ask them if they get money for the referral and what are they going to say? Yes, I'm a good nutritionist. Won't try to sell you something just because they get a kickback and an even better one. We'll give you a list of options of things you could do based on your blood work. And I make this all makes sense, I guess. Hey, people that have to give their opinion, give you their credentials as a means of validating their opinion. But for context, I'm a member of Team USA and competed in the 2006 Olympics in Rio. Jesus Christ, it fucking thrown your Dick on the table here.

Speaker 1:          40:50          The only reason why I say this is that a is for the example that team USA is sponsored by Coca Cola and even our nutritionist attempt to hook us up on protein brand, um, on a protein brand owned by coke. Yeah. It's how it works. Everybody has a side deal despite it being an inferior and more expensive product. Wow. They recommended it to the athletes, isn't that, and there was, and there was gold medals on the line anyways, just saying, be careful who you listen to. They even do elite athletes with this shit. Well, you know what? That's probably one of the most informed fucking emails I ever read or are. Yeah, I guess it is an email write letter. And I was like, oh, when I was a kid, they called him letters. Yeah, I know. I have to watch out for that. I'm one of the reasons I got a nutrition in this.

Speaker 1:          41:38          It is because, um, when I went online, anything that I looked up about food, I mean the whole front, I don't know how many pages was just all big time websites and um, and then just confirm everything was conflicting. You know, these are good. Don't eat those. I'll tell you he got belly flat. You know what the problem is? Bananas. A lot of people think banana is a fucking just like, you know, I don't know how long when people do that. You start telling you like certain fruits and vegetables are bad for you. It's like, yeah, well I imagine if I eat a fucking Bushel, love him. It's not good. But isn't it also like some sort of a potassium or some shit I get out of bananas. I Dunno. Gorillas eat them. They look pretty fucking buff. A 23. And me, uh, here's the old Billy cito. Oh, hey there Billy. Ultimately Cheeto Dick. Oh Man. Come on man. A link to the article at the bottom, but I know you don't read. So here's the gist. All right, hang on a second. 23 and me is getting lots of money from big pharmacy. What the fuck is this? Okay. Anyway, he goes, all right. He goes, you were absolutely right. This company, 23 and me is set to make 300 million from sharing their users generic information with big pharmacy. Oh, is that one of those, uh,

Speaker 4:          42:59          okay.

Speaker 1:          42:59          Like ancestry.com websites. Uh, they say it's so the bank company can use the data to develop medical breakthroughs, Isam ship. But I'm sure we all know that's bullshit except, except to see robot replacements within a decade or two anyway, so you could use some vindication from a fellow conspiracy nuts, have a good one and go swap your own spit, go fuck yourself. Um, I would actually guess that all of that is true. Okay. They're going to use all of that information,

Speaker 1:          43:35          um, to develop new drugs, I would think because they're trying to make money, none of which will cure you. They'll just keep you up, you know, on the hook. We'll keep them all just alive enough that he keeps buying her a little pill. Um, and then I also think the robots are going to come. Absolutely. You know, but the bottom line is, is the people who are making the robots are overseeing it. Earl so human. So it's in their best interest to try and cure shit for other humans. Right. I already told you my philosophy. Right. Am I fucking theory was basically, I should've told you guys about that fucking stupid pot square thing. Cause right now you're like oh man, this is just cause he's high. You know, fucking people who are like into, we'd always give it credit. You know, like I didn't already have this thought.

Speaker 1:          44:20          I had this paranoid thought stone sober alone in a hotel room. This is what I think. I think that they're going to fucking use that shit to build robots and then they're going to kill everybody off, keep a certain amount of people alive and their job's going to be to like keep reproducing so the Illuminati can harvest the organs. I swear to God that's got to be from the weed man. No, I swear to God, I've actually said that on stage this weekend. Stone's Silva after eating a salad. You know, a lot of those salads actually have chemicals sprayed all over him. So you're actually, I know, I know. There's no fucking way around it. Alright, Bill from a lady, uh, hey, build the blahzay blahzay cunt, the Blazo Kat, um, I'm a relatively recent listener of your podcast as if seeing you at cluster fest in San Francisco a year ago.

Speaker 3:          45:16          MMM.

Speaker 1:          45:18          That sentence makes no sense. I am a relatively recent listener of your podcast as of seeing you at cluster fest in San Francisco a year ago. All right. I guess that does make sense, but it's kind of written it up. Passive aggressive Shakespearian way. You could've fucking arranges the letters a little more, uh, straightforward there.

Speaker 1:          45:42          All right. I'm not going to lie. That one right there. That was the weed. I literally have a meeting in a half hour. Like what the f I'm just going to fuck. I can't imagine the show I'm going to agree to do. All right. Not Looking where I was going. I almost accidentally walked into you while you were on your way to interview Jerry Seinfeld. Uh, most of the same way. I probably came off as rude from my deer in the headlight moments of literally running into one of the best comedians of all time that I write this. So I hope you can accept my late apology.

Speaker 3:          46:14          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          46:14          What am I in fucking in Lord of the rings here? Yeah, I see. You are forgiven. She is spared. I thought your interview and headliner act was terrific and hope to see another one of your shows. That was one of the coolest fucking days ever, by the way. I fucking got, got to do a and [inaudible] show that day. No, it was, it was the day after I'd finished my show the next day. Uh, I got to interview Jerry Seinfeld in a theater in front of them, I don't know, a couple thousand people while he promoted the latest season of comedians in cars. Had a great time. And then I walked out the door and, uh, had a car service to go over.

Speaker 3:          46:51          Okay.

Speaker 1:          46:51          With Josh Adam Meyers. We had booked a car service to go into the NBA finals to see like game three of the NBA finals. Um, golden state versus the Cleveland Warriors and the driver was so cool. He let us smoke cigars in the back.

Speaker 3:          47:06          Come on man.

Speaker 1:          47:08          Great fucking days of my life. Anyways. Um, I'm glad you mentioned you wanted more women to write to your show. I would love, yeah, cause I love trashing you. No, I'm kidding. I would like to hear what it is. Shit you think I would love if you had more female guests on your podcast. Oh Geez. I don't think I've ever had a woman on my, does that mean on sexist, sexist, sexist? I don't think I actually appealed to women. And I can tell you why. Because my shows a sausage fest and when I go outside I can't even tell you how many times somebody will be like, it'll be a couple and they want a picture and like the wife or girlfriend takes the picture and they never want one. Just the guy does. So I mean, I dunno. I think maybe this is just like a,

Speaker 4:          47:56          okay.

Speaker 1:          47:58          I Dunno. I'm trying to think of something that's so strictly for guys like footballs, you know, basically that version. I'm trying to pick something when actually offend women footballs and for everybody. Anyways, I was wondering if you could give me some dating advice.

Speaker 4:          48:13          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          48:14          Um, society generally teaches women at a young age that men are suitors and women are courted. But as a 27 year old woman who dates women, sometimes it gets particularly difficult to figure out who does what role, especially if both women are very feminine. Well, at that point you got to step it up. Also just be a staring contest, right? Sometimes these roles just fit naturally, but other times there isn't a clear sense of direction and the whole thing just falls apart. Let me asked you this. All right. Because opposites attract. They always say, um, and I've dated people who are too similar to me and it's just, we want a yin and a Yang. We would to yangs. So we had half the fucking thing taken care of and the rest was a shit show. So when the lesbian world, all right, if both women are feminine, does that have less of a chance of making it as a relationship we want to hear from lesbians were taking college it fat, fat, fat. Uh, sometimes these roles just fit naturally, but other times there isn't a clear sense of direction and the whole thing just falls apart. I'm also not naturally comfortable with approaching women at bars or social events that eventually wait for someone else to make the first move. Risa, why you got all the power? Because it's, it's, it's, it's all women, right? So there's no fucking,

Speaker 1:          49:38          there's nothing, there's nothing holding you back here other than that voice in your head going, what if she says no? Recently, I feel like I've missed out on some good opportunities for dates because of this. What advice would you give to someone who isn't used to being the proactive or leading role in a dating situation? Uh, thanks and best wishes to your family. Oh yeah. And Go fuck yourself. Well, why don't you just start hitting on somebody you're not interested in. You don't just as practice and just say that stupidest, dumbest, most over the top shit. I mean, I'm applying to this two as a guy, if you're afraid to talk to women, it's kind of like a,

Speaker 1:          50:19          you got to see the humor in it. You guys see the humor and getting up thinking someone gave you a look like, yeah, I'm in to you. And you walk all the way over there and it turns out they were looking at somebody else or whatever you say to them, just completely bombs. And then instantly in that moment, you know, I should just turn around and walk back to where I was, but just out of some stupid pride, you'll continue to stand there for 10 minutes, no adding rather than ripping the bandaid off, just slowly tearing it off so that person can reject you for another fucking sixth of an hour. Um, oh, she said, ps, I've been Vegan for six plus years and found it does work. It does wonders for my health. Changing my diet, literally cured a moderate skin condition I had since I was a child. Uh, if you're still curious about giving ved veganism a trust, a test run, sorry. I'd say try it out for a month and see how you feel. It definitely works for me, but I know that's not the case for everyone and tries it. Um, yeah, I'm trying to be lazy about learning how to do it. I just like go to a nutritionist, teach me, you know,

Speaker 1:          51:31          I was just like, hang out with somebody that's, you know, show me some, just give me a fucking bitch. You know what? I wish they just had like a giant march madness like poster for how to be a Vegan, like that. Easy. You know what I mean? Like you look okay, these two teams play. Now, this team's names here, so I know it won that game. I wish they could just fucking do that and break it down and the bracket leads to the finals, which is protein or at least the fucking, whatever the fuck, whatever else you need. Carbohydrates. I don't fucking know.

Speaker 1:          52:02          I swear to God, I am literally going to assume my girl, my wife for fucking drug in me here. I came to keep my fucking thoughts straight at this point. Um, girlfriends, arguably racist family. Oh boy. Oh Jesus. Uh, I'm a black guy in Louisiana with the girlfriend who is white. Her family is very religious and reserved as am I. Although we are kind of religious, her and I, not our families per se where we have our beliefs and don't shut them down people's throats. Anyways, the problem is she has had, she had a kid with a black guy right before I met her. All right. She has a type, her kid is not even six months. He left her high and dry and wants nothing to do with them. Now seeing as we are in the south, I asked her a normal question down here, is your family okay with you dating a black guy? That question gets asked all over the country. By the way, it's, there's this myth that racism is just down in the south. Um, she was very honest and said, Eh, my mom and dad should be fine. He eats fried chicken every Sunday. So you'd love him. She said that my grandparents generation, uh, not so much.

Speaker 1:          53:22          Well, she was making, I guess this is a joke. This is one like reading it. You're like, I don't know how this was set anyways. Fair enough. I'll work with that. The problem is after she talked me up to her mom and her mom saw a picture of me, she was like, oh no, he's black. You just going to get hurt. So I don't know if her mom was just an error.

Speaker 3:          53:44          Okay.

Speaker 1:          53:44          Inherit, oh, inherited the races more if she feels that way, because a black guy ditched her pregnant daughter. Uh, how do I approach this? They live in the woods.

Speaker 3:          53:56          Jesus Christ.

Speaker 1:          53:59          This sounds like fucking Tarantino movie. You know, one of those little shorts that he makes, you know, and going back to visit them is kind of sketchy to me.
