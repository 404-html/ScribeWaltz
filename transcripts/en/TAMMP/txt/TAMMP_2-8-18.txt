Speaker 1:          00:00:01       Hey, what's going on is bill burn. It's time for the Thursday afternoon, just before Friday, Monday morning podcast and

Speaker 1:          00:00:14       just checking in on. You see now your week's going. I know your week's going great. And Philly right now. She'd not a sports fan then. You probably all upset it. Everybody's all excited running around, tearing up the streets sides, you know, eating horse shit. I felt bad for that Philly fan that had to eat horse shit. You know what I mean? It's just all the shit that diff fans have gotten, you know, attention for like the bar has just been set so high that this poor bastard that was through, he was like out of ideas, you know, you know where it is as far as bad behavior, you know, or Philly fans are right now. It's kind of like, remember when they did the dunking contest every year in the all star game and at first it was amazing, you know, so we'd just like takes off from the foul line.

Speaker 1:          00:01:00       It's like, Holy Shit. You know, the next thing you know, you've got to have like some fucking quivering fucking woman standing there and you got to jump and your balls have to just scrape the top of her fucking head while you covered your eyes like Dee Brown. You know, that's kind of like where eagles fans had flyers, fans. All Philly fans are as far as like, how the fuck are we going to get on ESPN this time? What are we going to do? Throw up on a kid already did that. What are we going to do? Punch an old lady in the con. Ah, we've been doing that since the 70s what does fall, my God, there's a pile of horse shit. Ah, turn on your fucking video camera.

Speaker 1:          00:01:45       That didn't even make sense. I'm not going to put that on eagles fans. I'm not going to put that on Philly. I'm in bed is an individual act. That guy wanted to do that shit for the longest time. He just needed an excuse. You know what I mean? It's like all of us, most of us have never eaten another human being. Right. But put in the right situation, you'd fucking do it. Right. What was that movie alive plane crashes in the rocky mountains. You know, they're right next to aspen, but they're all rich, so they're not going to help out. It wouldn't give them a sandwich. And next thing you know, they're eating each other. There's this have to do with Eaton. Why the fuck did this have to do with eating horse shit? I was trying to think where they actually landed. Where was it?

Speaker 1:          00:02:29       They didn't land the crashed. I would actually be upset if I survived that. You know, like you're like, Oh fuck, I'm gonna die. Right. And then you fucking survive me on top of that mountain freeze and you fucking ass off then you wish you did. Um, anyways. Anyways, um, I actually was finally able to look at some of the highlights because I really wanted to see eagles fans celebrating. I just couldn't handle it cause they'd beat my team. And, um, I believe I said, you know, on the podcasts and towards the end of December that if the Patriots get bounced out of the playoffs, I was going to root for the fucking eagles, just cause you know, they had one, one, like I said, I really don't have anything I wanted to say. I forgot to say that on Conan because so many people fucking reached out, you know, Twitter and all of this crap because of my Philly rent thinking I really didn't want the eagles to ever win one.

Speaker 1:          00:03:22       And all of it. It's just I got booed in Philly. I made fun of Philly. If I got booed in Texas, I would have made fun of pickup trucks and women who wear too much makeup. You know, when you dumb fucking boots walking around. All right, if you've got a flat screen TV and not a fucking cowboy, all right. You look like you're on your way to a gay bar. I would've said something like that in Texas. That's what I would've done. Oh, look who's here. They'll love bleed knee. The fuck are you eating? What are those things called? Panoramas alright, take it down. Take it down a bit. Hey, that's when you know your wife's here. Hey, what are you having a good time? Take it down a bit. I'm eating pomegranate seeds. I'm eating pomegranate seeds. I heard they're good for my ovaries and my lady parts.

Speaker 1:          00:04:07       They do. I heard, I read that this post to shine up the advantage lips over there. Oh baby. You know it's weird. Has a weird segue, you know, a year ago or so when I didn't have a kid, oh, we'll go back a year and a half when you didn't get yourself knocked up. Right. Um, I would just be walking around the house that would be singing whatever contemporary shit that you know, you would listen to to, you know, did she say why gold and Michelle fiber that some bum, right. I'd been singing that shit. Right. Okay. Then now that we have a kid down there brushing my teeth going right,

Speaker 2:          00:04:41       whoa. Bab Arena. I may be blue with Koi tea tea's Whoa, arena, but I'm not so different in Daddy. Yeah. What happened? What happened to me? A pop up a puppy dog close when they're going through, when they go on the adventure. How's the song go? Go in on a mission, not a mission that's going on. A mission going on a mission. That's true. Sure

Speaker 1:          00:05:15       about. Ooh, what? Oh, I was, that's why I brought you on. Yeah. Yeah. Those are me undies beyond these sent matching, matching. Underwears I love it. They're so cute. What's, what's on this a Taco with hot sauce. You get it. Do you need to be explained that hearing these on Valentine's Day, I may make him be fun in front of me for being a redhead. I didn't make it. Make it fun. Make it be fun of me for being a redhead. What though? What the hot sauce did you see the text that I sent you that now they're going to have red hand emojis in June? Uh, yeah. Which I just think it's going to lead to more redheaded hate. The thing about being a redhead is what you want to do is not stand next to another red head. You want to sort of like fade into the background.

Speaker 1:          00:06:01       But you know what, you don't really, you're not going to use those. But they also have, um, bald, bald emojis. Do they have a bald what? The Red Beard? I don't know if the baldy has facial hair. When am I ever going to fit in my whole life? Oh, when are you ever be represented? No. You realize how difficult it is to be a redheaded white male. He's so close to the brass ring, but those blue blood and what? They won't let me get to know Jesus. I am like the lazy, I'm like the runt of the litter. The one that the mother rejects. Yeah. You're the real underdog. Um, I hate when you do you? Yeah, you're the real law under the, why don't you just do it in a giant fucking, I roll with that. There it is a meme level. It looks beautiful outside.

Speaker 1:          00:06:45       So why don't you put on your underwear, Nini? I want to see you in those. I want to wear it on Valentine's Day. We have to both where I'm Valentine's Day. No we don't. That's why they get cause. I'm going to, I'm an adult and I can make my own choices despite the fact that you know something. What's killing me? Can you just wear your taco underwear? Can you just have a little fun and not be so uptight? Did you just say uptight like we're in a fucking black and white comedy movie here. He's white and she's black. She teaches up to loosen up. Huh? You're really uptight. You're not uptight. I'm a fucking control freak. I don't like people telling me what to do. It means you're uptight. If you're a control freak, that means you're uptight. No, it doesn't. Yeah, it does. Oh, black people uptight because a sick of white people fucking running shit. What does that have to do with anything that troll did Janet Jackson do a whole fucking album about that?

Speaker 1:          00:07:42       Why am I here? Because I want you to see the match and underwear. I thought you'd have fun with it rather than put demands on. Isn't it enough that I have to pay for the whole evening? We're celebrating our relationship. Where is your contribution? Oh yeah, but you supposed to do that. You supposed to do that. They blowy. Yeah, but you're supposed to want to do that. That's the question. No money. And you're burning calories. Ridiculous burning calories. What do you, what? It's an aerobic exercise if done correctly. Oh, whoa. Getting a blow. We were wearing matching underwear. Don't fuse those two worlds together. I will. And I just did. MMM. It's because of that world that you now have a new world. Okay. There you go. Okay. By the way, I, I lovely little one. Um, oh, she uh, she took her first steps this week. Oh, it was awesome. I want to start crying. Yeah, she did. It's funny. You're going to start crying. I wanted to film it and then fucking put Aerosmith's walk this way. Underneath it. Yeah. Be Time she falls, that debt

Speaker 2:          00:08:56       ball get, and we'll hit the snare as when she falls down and arrest. So cute. She was so proud of herself too. I didn't realize babies get like proud of themselves. Yeah. Like what? She learns how to do stuff. She looks over and smells like, Huh? Yeah. Look at me. Seeing this. He checking this out. So cute. Um, anyway, so, well, let's get down to what everybody's talking about. The scandalous interview by a Quincy Jones. Nia. Ah, Jesus Christ. Iconic and Rbo. I didn't like it. Of course she's in. What do you like bill? What a was popular that you actually enjoy? What do you mean? There's a bunch of shit that I like. Chocolate cupcakes. Oh look, a basket full of puppies. I hate it. Like what's not? No, that's true. I like cupcakes. I actually know how to make them and I've made you some and I love dogs. You've never made me a cupcake. You fucking whore. Put that microphone. Yeah, that's exactly what I just said. Excuse me. There's no need for that. I drove all over the fucking La base and trying to find you a fucking Yellow Cup cake with chocolate frosting and it didn't exist and I went out and I fucking made them for you. You don't remember that. You haven't that were in your life made me cupcakes. And this is in Los Angeles or in New York? This is here. Like when the last, within the last two years.

Speaker 2:          00:10:18       Give me that microphone off the podcast. You're up the podcast. I don't remember that. Unbelievable. You made it and you went out and bought me cupcakes like late at night when I'd have like cupcake cravings. But you've never made because that would mean you'd make it like a dozen cupcakes because that's how many were in the pants. Yeah. And you frosted them and everything. Yeah. I don't remember this.

Speaker 3:          00:10:41       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:10:41       I ain't fucking with me, right? No. Go into the cupboard and go look. There's a fucking cupcake tray. Why would I have one of those? Uh, that's right. There it is guys. For years, the only as good is the last act. It doesn't mean shit to them. You know the Patriots are always just pushing fucking all pros out. The door liners are in there too. Yeah, yeah, that's right. Yeah. Wow. Well guess who's not making cupcakes anymore? Maybe I should film it. Well, you make some for Valentine's Day. No. Why? Why? Cause you're not going to remember. And then you can come on a podcast. You know what? I made red velvet ones and meanwhile I'm wearing matching underwear. I'm playing the game, I'm playing the game, right. And then I make it cupcakes. You don't even remember. How dare you. You look gorgeous. So by the way, oh name, he's been hitting the gym and I've been noticing, I'm trying to keep it together, keep it together, keep it together. Do you know my issue is positive right there. I made you cupcakes. I said you're looking good. All of that. Whose wedding? Like about Quincy Jones, he was talking shit about people who were dead. And then everybody took everything he said is fact. And it's like you didn't notice halfway his gold. I know who killed

Speaker 1:          00:11:54       Kennedy. Oh Shit. You should have told Oliver Stone. He wouldn't have wasted all that time making that movie when he could have just called you up. Um, I just like when he said, when you go for the money, God walks out the room. That's where like as far as all that gossip about everybody else, it's like, dude, why once you grow up? Huh?

Speaker 4:          00:12:14       Okay,

Speaker 1:          00:12:14       well who? Who goes around doing that? Who just got used to steal songs. He didn't say that. When you will make an records with the whip, he was still fucking alive.

Speaker 2:          00:12:21       Tell all the stories. This is what I'm telling you. You are mad. Cool, cool. Damn it. Old People, my family, they just, they don't give a fuck. They're just tell him stories about everybody. This person did this and this person did this and back in the day it was that because what are they apt to lose? They're not, you know, fearful of being politically correct. Let me get this straight line. You're not supposed to be. Yes, you supposed shit. You're not supposed to be a snitch. He's supposed to keep your mouth shut and all of that shit your whole fucking life. He's not in the end when everybody, do you know what the fuck? I mean, well, I dunno how I was brought up.

Speaker 1:          00:12:57       What'd she didn't do that to people? It does get stitches. No, not that street shit. Yeah. Like I said, I don't pop off. I'd flip out, but even in the hard streets in the suburbs, pretty classic line I think for the podcast. But I lived in that Culdesac you want to talk about dead end streets, man, you had to go out my suburb but street ended and all it was was beautiful woods into a lovely pond

Speaker 2:          00:13:25       lunch yesterday with mom and she like, did you hear her? Like kind of chastised me for not drinking water

Speaker 2:          00:13:33       cause it all, but I wish I could have enjoyed that. Claudia and I drank a whole bunch of water like the whole entire morning and then automatically they automatically filled up my glass again for more. All right. In Password. They just automatically filled it up and my mom was like, do you want some water? And I was like, no, it's okay. And she like hits me on the arm just you should be drinking water. And it's like I drink water all God damn day La. It was just a mother's love I guess. So I just annoyed me anyway. It has nothing to do a little word. Hey Nia, you should drink more water. Wow.

Speaker 1:          00:14:10       I literally drink water all day long. Nobody notices that system and why in that moment she had to like, I dunno. It literally has been bothering me since yesterday so it doesn't, yeah, hold on. I wouldn't have slapped you on the wrist if I knew it was really bothering you. It's just annoying. You want to talk about it, Neil? No, I got it off my chest. That's what I've learned about women. You just, Oh, I didn't know that. You just said about women. No, nothing. You have no instincts. You have no intuition. I nailed that whole thing about how you guys stopped giving compliments when you get married and you even said, fair enough. I don't remember that. Of course you don't just like the cupcakes.

Speaker 1:          00:14:51       You know what's funny? I'm going to stop doing shit for you. Just say that I did it.

Even though much of it was painful for me to sit there. I think a Philly fans deserve that. You know, after all this shit they've got because of that rant, which I said once again was not fun. It wasn't personal. It was a personal, it just so long ago too. It was, that's the funny thing is now people that go to another you share you get was, well, he fucking won one and only took half a century fucker. You bragging about. That's like the guy who fucking finishes a marathon in Lynn, like nine hours. It's like,

Speaker 2:          00:20:48       yeah dude, I could have walked it and that, that amount of time. Also, that audience deserves it. Who did the audience and Villi they deserve?

Speaker 1:          00:20:56       Yeah, they did. They were assholes. Yeah, and it was funny. Most of them probably have kids now and they're raising little asshole kids, but you know something. Not all Philly fans. I like that. I remembered having Shay's a nice guy. Oh we love you. You know you, I remember those guys aren't always sunny. Yeah, they're nice guys. I didn't see them do it. Yeah. They weren't tipping over any cars and stuff.

Speaker 2:          00:21:19       Oh my God. Um, I remember you called me after that whole thing in Philly happen and you were like, I have a massive headache. And I said, what happened? He like, I just got into a fight with like 10,000 feet. You did you call me right after it happened. I'll never forget it. And I was like, oh my God. Whoa. And then it just blew up. And I think

Speaker 1:          00:21:42       that's right. You were at my apartment that I was when I rode home with Bobby Kelly and he's going to judge Whitehead tonight. Kid. Yeah. I was like, Bobby, I've got a headache. Yeah. Does people, they go back and shells get, you know what Bobby Kelly had to follow that night? Bobby Kelly had to go on after the intermission where they, somebody was an ear infection. Drained it. Somebody else drank it. And somebody who watched it. Cute.

Speaker 2:          00:22:10       This is in Philly? Yeah. What is going on with the P and let that guy that he'd horse shit. Like what is going on? No, no, no, no. Well, what is going on over there? Seriously.

Speaker 1:          00:22:19       You know what happened to Philly was when they built night interstate 95 they, they got bypassed. Okay. So I just think that they're just stuck in time back in a time when people ate horse shit. I don't know. I don't know why. I think there's something there. There's either some sacred burial ground that they built the city on, or there's some sort of toxic waste, like the Simpsons thing going on. I don't know what their deal is, but all I know is they don't care that people don't like them and they're proud of their behaviors. So I say God bless him.

Speaker 2:          00:22:50       There's some really amazing people though, and affiliate. Right? If you had the Horse Shit, uh, the roots, that's not a person, Jill Scott. It's a band. Um, all the black people

Speaker 1:          00:23:04       I know. You're like really racist, Huh? Kevin Hart. Keith Robinson. Kevin Hart. Yeah. I didn't

Speaker 2:          00:23:11       know that he sold out the Eagle Stadium. Yeah. And he was, he did stand up in a fucking football. So funny. He was so happy after they won. You saw him on TV drunk. So I can, but I know that sounded hilarious, so it was pretty great. It was pretty great. He was very happy. Yeah. So that's the deal. I'm, what am I going to get mad? You know, my team can't win it every year. Right, right. I know. I think you're very gracious about it. You like, that's the one thing you've actually mellowed out about as the years have gone by. I mean, I can't, it compliments, go ahead boards. That's the one thing I can actually say. I see you

Speaker 1:          00:23:47       improvement on the rest of it is taking a fucking nose dive now. You're very gracious when it comes other teams. Yeah. I don't, I don't take it to the point of like, like I said, I just, you know, what's his, I retweeted that, that uh, nick foals audio in the, uh, in, in the huddle was great. Other than he said, I love you guys. And just like, why does everything have to be so fucking sweet now

Speaker 2:          00:24:16       I would love to tell a boy, nick, I would advise your responses in a huddle in an NFL game. I mean, I would've loved to have had teleported him back to that fucking 1980 Superbowl team when they were playing the Raiders and just be okay before we do this first place. When to say, I love you guys. I just said, well, we'll put Montgomery, look at him when they win the Superbowl and stop. He can't say, I love you too. Now when I was not, when I was a kid,

Speaker 1:          00:24:40       didn't,

Speaker 2:          00:24:42       they didn't think anybody. Actually the cra had emotions when you were a kid and then all of a sudden it's a new millennial thing to have emotion and express them.

Speaker 1:          00:24:50       Men did not cry when I was a kid that I saw, I saw the Celtics went three championships. I saw the Lakers went five. I saw the Pistons went to, you know, the first time I think I saw a guide cry was Jordan. It was because his dad died and he wasn't there and that was understandable. You know what I mean? But he didn't just cry because he won. He said that angry look on his face going like five fucking six and you always seem to win it on the road. And you know, he's looking at some little kid who was crying. He got off on it, he got off on PNB. That's what a man was back then. Okay. Um, first of all, just want to say, I love you guys want to just take time to just, everybody knows how much weight to offensive line is lost.

You know, my life has changed a lot in the last year and in a great way. I became a father and I look at the world at different time, different way, and I've noticed the whole thing. You can just be like, all right, no, it has to be a big thing because then they're going to expect that there's going to be this punchline that never comes. Right. And this is going on and on about how much love you have in your heart. And don't forget to look at this. Don't forget to look at the sky today, everybody, you know, it's those little things that we take for granted. If you get some of that fucking pomegranate and my jacket. Oh, all right.

Had the same manager. Okay. As new kids on the block and their manager at Maurice Starr said he wanted to make a white pop crossover version of new edition that don't get mad, don't get mad at white people. It was a black guy's ideas who said, I'm mad at white people. And you were doing that fucking Elvis Shit. New Kids on the block have always given props and respect to new edition their whole entire careers. That's good because I would hate to know that those two bands are fighting.

Speaker 4:          00:28:13       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:28:27       Okay. Why? Why get all weird? Not Weird. It feels weird. Well, that's because you live in a place of fucking awkwardness and anger. Can I ask you a question? Do you know what to tell you about my issue? Question sincerely. Is it ever you, is it always me and my world of awkwardness and anger and negativity, as you say, fucking unbelievable. If you guys, of course she said to me, I woke up this morning, but I do what I do. I fucking change my daughter's diaper. Right?

It's all the great shit that had done today and this is what we, all, she all she talks about how she just just dials into is my, is my fucking anger. Right. And I haven't even been lost my shit yet today except when it burned my hand in the kitchen, which is not why I yelled. Fuck. That was why? Because I was putting the fucking Keno into my thermos and you know, and it always falls down in between. That's a stupid harness. And you said that's why you screaming obscenity? Yeah, cause I went out before it fell off the spoon and went all the way down anyway to clean it up and I just went fuck. And you were in the other room, you're like, whoa. I was like a burned my hand.

Been trashing me. But you've been the last three times were on the podcast. You make it sound like you're emotionally held captive here when you're running the deal. Yeah. Puts into that laugh.

All right. Why can't we just say the seventh? I'll remember that. Well, what day is today? Well, it's the eighth. So it was yesterday. What kind of life are you leading that you don't even know what fucking Datas. We have the nerve to talk about me. What month is it? Quick, quick. There you go. Show a history monster and you'd be like lighting a candle every day. Don't they make a giant Black Menorah with 28 candles and science Blackman. Nora. Yeah, no, I know. Then our, this day in 1932 I'm reading stories a little every day about African Americans and Americans and that did the shill lace, which was later taken credit was taken by the light bed and actually it was three women who were good at math of African descent. February 9th the first steam ship was actually built by a native American African Blood Robert Fault and killed that person that said, I invented the steam ship. This happened February 9th, 1845.

Speaker 2:          00:31:32       I said it. February 9th, eight eight Oh four Thomas Jefferson finally gave into his desires and hopefully it was her desire to, but that's not how it worked back then. Yeah. Yeah. Where are you performing next? Um, and the Patrice O'Neal benefit or Patrice O'Neal benefits. This is a 54 tickets left. Uh, something like that. Um, that's on February 20th. My next one is going to be in Santa Barbara, Santa Barbara, which was actually an African American named it and 1970 til like people took it over because they liked the view of the beach. Are you a, are you flying to Santa Barbara and me decided, yes I am. I'm frying playing a helio copter out there. Are you chilled? Yo, meet there and then flying back. So can I come? There's no room for you. What do you mean there's no room? There's no wrong blue and the copilot and the opener.

Speaker 2:          00:32:32       Yeah. Okay. Well I guess that's that then. Oh two openers to open up. The still flying out there. One them is as he, and I'm going to be fucking dying laughing cause he hates to fly and it's going to freak them out that I'm on controls. Even though we're going to have the copilot there, he's going to be freaking tell whoever the other person is. It's coming with you to film him. Oh yeah. When we first go into a habit, because you know when the first time you go into Howard, this one of the weirdest feelings ever, other than realizing that you were attracted to me 15 years ago, 14 years ago, it must have been, am I attracted to that orange headed Weirdo? Um, so negative. Well, that's nice. Nice. That's a nice dog. And You wonder why I live in a world of anger and awkwardness.

Speaker 2:          00:33:14       No, no. The, when I first saw you, the first time ever, I saw your freckles really handsome and I was like, oh, what were you like? That's, that's what I always know, like five years later. So it was meant to be, oh, you like me. I saw, I met, I met my wife in an alley behind the first one in an alley behind the Apollo. Yeah, that's the first I was going into do fish area. It was going in to do showtime at the Apollo. My Dad had booked you on, it's showtime at the Apollo. My Dad used to book the Comedians on it, show Timothy Paulo. My Dad is actually known bill longer than I have. And, um, I saw, he was like, oh, I got this funny wipe away from Boston on the show. And I was like, okay, cool. I had just graduated from college and I went back there and you said hi briefly.

Speaker 2:          00:34:06       And I was like, oh, he's really good looking. And then when I saw you years later on, tough crowd, I immediately recognize you. I was like, oh my God, that's the guy that I met at the Apollo with my dad, Jen. And you were such a jerk to me. I wasn't, I kept trying to ask you, he was such an asshole. No, that's not how it went at all. I wouldn't even look at me if you were in the elevator. I was looking over it. I was like, think of something to say something with something saying he was staring straight ahead like those fucking guys in London with the big furry hats. Expressionless trying to play hard to get, but you also had a girlfriend at the time and I had a boyfriend. No, I didn't. Yeah, you did. I thought I did. No, you did.

Speaker 2:          00:34:46       And then when we ran into each other at the party for Chappelle show, that's when you told me you didn't have a girlfriend, but when we first met you did have it in fucking asked you why? When I had a girlfriend I know. Well then all right then and I'll buy, but you were still looking at so what I can look, I was looking to, even though I had a boyfriend, but we didn't do anything until after we were both still after. Exactly. Yeah. Jesus. That's all you're going to go all Quincy Jones there. Oh listen. When you guy kicked the bucket and kicked the plug that you wait til the week. I would never do that to you, but I do. I don't. Why would I give a shit? I be dead. I had to imagine myself. No, I don't want to, first of all, I don't ever want to think about your time before me. That would be too much. Well, it's going to happen. I'm 10 years older than you and I'm a guy, but I do take better care of myself. Then you do. Wait, what I do, I do the elliptical.

Speaker 1:          00:35:38       I swear to God you eat Kina war for three weeks and you think you're some fucking like health, like you really need to knock it off. Fair enough. You're like, Oh wow, you don't want to have so much energy. Yes bill, we are all aware of like the health benefits of joining or jealous of my new healthy diet. I'm not jealous you are you always nosing around like a little fucking rabbit. We didn't know was wiggling like wait, what are you eating over there? What are you going over there?

Speaker 2:          00:36:04       I'm just curious what you're doing. Cause Yeah, you're, you're doing really well with your diet and stuff but I just think be like we're the first person that discovered Keana was the way you go on and on about and not what I think. What do you think?

Speaker 1:          00:36:17       I think I went to the dentist yesterday and found out that I was supposed to do 16 weeks of Invisalign, but because I've left these things in sometimes even during shows spitting on the front too. Fucking rose cause I want to get this over with. He says it's only going to be 13 weeks, and I just put in train number nine,

Speaker 2:          00:36:35       bitch,

Speaker 1:          00:36:38       I got another month to these fucking things.

Speaker 2:          00:36:42       That's it. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:36:44       You just, you know, excited. I was, when I got, you remember when I got, I remember my, I got your teeth fixed. All this shit that I've done for you. Please put it that way. All this shit that I've done, I see one more fucking piece of clothing that you just had to have the chief judge just frisbee down at a fucking goodwill for some homeless guy to traipse around in while these looking to get his fucking junk.

Speaker 2:          00:37:09       All right.

Speaker 1:          00:37:10       I got to get off. I have to get on on with my fucking day. This has been the podcast. We're gonna not play a little bit of music and then you get to listen to another half hour of bullshit from a Thursday podcast, uh, earlier this year, 10 years ago. I don't know how it works. Um, that's it. All right. Have a wonderful weekend. You'd concert once again. Congratulations to everybody. You'd Philly, uh, please don't eat excrement from an animal, right?

Speaker 4:          00:37:43       Eh? Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Hey, what's

Speaker 1:          00:38:32       going on? It's bill bird and it is the Monday morning for Monday,

Speaker 5:          00:38:37       February 8th, 2010 one day after Superbowl 44. Well, um, usually I don't begin my podcast with a warning, but I'm going to this week. Um, if you live anywhere near Indianapolis, you want to shut this thing off right now. Okay? If you one of those fantasy football playing Douche bags with your stats and your Peyton manning poster hanging above your fucking bed, you want to shut this thing off right now. All right? Because this podcast is dedicated to you guys. You fucking cunts who I've been telling you for the last five fucking years that Peyton manning is overrated. I even went off on him last week. Last week I went off on that guy. And you can not believe the emails that I got from people all just fucking, not only defending Peyton Manning, but brushing off Tom Brady and his three super bowl rings as if, oh, you can plug anybody into that system, you know?

Speaker 5:          00:39:41       But paint may, who hate Manny, who paid money? He used to, he threw for 50 fucking touchdowns during what? He threw five touchdowns against the fucking Buccaneers in November. I said it last week. Peyton manning is a regular season statistical juggernaut. All right? If you want to know who the fuck that guy is, if you're still confused, the fuck is there an invasion. You hear that shit? That's what happens out here in fucking la. So we'd probably just robbed a convenience store. They got a little overboard out here, dude, I'm telling you right now, if you want to know who Peyton manning is, you wanna know who that fucking guy is. Picture this. If Dan Marino fucked Brett Farve, their baby would be Peyton manning. That's who he is. Okay? And this asshole had only one one fucking time, his whole career and all these analysts on TV, it was ridiculous.

Speaker 5:          00:40:31       They're all going, you know, I'm telling you right now, you know, if he wins here, uh, you're, you're, you're arguably looking at one of the greatest quarterbacks of all time because of what? Based on what? Based on what his regular season stats. This guy fucking chokes every year in the fucking playoffs. He's only one once. He's only one once and everybody's just fucking talking about and all you assholes. Who fucking emailed me this week? Where are your emails now? Huh? I emailed each one of you, every one of you fucking back and I never heard it from you. You know, maybe he's still fucking stunned. Maybe he's still fucking confused. So you know what? You know what I'm going to do just for all of you fucking idiots out there who think that Peyton manning is the greatest fucking guy ever. Totally disrespecting Tom Brady. Tom Brady has to wear, you know, he has to wear a fucking welder's mask at night to go to sleep.

Speaker 5:          00:41:24       That's how fucking bright his room is from those three championship rings. And you guys still disrespect him. The analysts on TV still disrespect them. They never talk about the way they talk about Peyton manning all accounts is what the fuck you do in January. You know, nobody talks about Terry Bradshaw. You guys haven't watched super bowl 10 it's up on fucking youtube. Watch that game. Terry Bradshaw, if you looked at his numbers, you fucking stat boy pussies. If you looked at his numbers on paper, you wouldn't think the guy was shit. You'd be like, Oh, pick many. He's like twice as good as this guy. He's closing in on 50,000 yards. All Bradshaw has a 25,000 yards. Yeah, in four fucking rinks. Superbowl 10 Terry Bradshaw Fades back to pass and the fourth fucking quarter gets knocked. Unconscious gets a concussion. Okay, and on that play that he got a concussion, he throws a 50 yard strike to Lynn Swann for the go ahead. Fucking score. All right. That's what the great ones do. And nobody ever brings up Terry Bradshaw. You. What the fuck has he ever done by? Other than when for fucking super bowls. So just in case you guys are still confused about your boy Peyton Manning, I'm going to read you some of his stats, the stats that fucking count. All right?

Speaker 6:          00:42:35       Yeah. We go the greatest quarterback of all time. I've got a little music for you this week. All right. December 30th I'm such an obnoxious ass. This is Carly Simon, by the way, singing. Nobody does it better. You know, this is what all the analysts have been singing for the last fucking 10 years of this guy's career. December 30th all right. Kicks ass in the regular season. Dolphins beat the cults. 2117 overtime wildcard game. Oh, whatever. Whatever. It's his first trip to the playoffs. He'll get better. 2002 colts lose 41 nothing in a playoff route against the New York jets, j e t s jets, jets, jets. This is the greatest quarterback of all fucking time. Potentially with one fucking ring. Everybody tune in and watch and see how he does against the saints. That's look how he did. January 8th, 2004 called slews 24 14 to the New England patriots. Greatest swapping quarterback, potentially a better one fucking ring.

Speaker 6:          00:43:45       You see his footwork? He's an unbelievable, okay. His hand eye coordination. He's got the pedigree. January 60 2005 cults again lose to the Patriots, 20 to three greatest fucking quarterback of all fucking time. January 15th, 2006 cults lose to this Steelers, 21 to 18 greatest quarterback of all time and right around then people start going, oh, is this another Dan Marino? But no. The next year he finally fucking shows up. Finally grows as Dick comes back. 21 points down against the Patriots, winters for a super bowl, and then I'm thinking, okay, he's a fucking man now, right? I'm going to see some Montana Shit. I'm going to see some, some fucking Terry. I'm going to see some time fucking Brady. What's he doing in the next year? He loses at home to the San Diego chargers. All right. Maybe he had a fucking hangover, maybe at a fucking hangover. What's he do in the next year?

Speaker 6:          00:44:46       Wait, is quarter fucking quarterback ever loses to the eight and eight chargers at fucking home? Right? And you hear this song, this is what these fucking analyst has been. Just continue to sing. He's the new Brett Farve. Brett Farve can do no wrong throws against his body over the fucking middle. And what is Tom Jackson say? Well, you know, he's never been afraid to lose the game. He fucking blew it. He mushed those vikings purple nuts right into the fucking ground and it's still fucking rubbing his god there. Mississippi Caucus. I'm sick of it. So here you go. She goes up against the lowly saints. They've never won a fucking thing in 40 fucking years of being in the league. What's going to be the difference, Peyton? And I'll tell ya, I got to go with Peyton manning. Oh, Peyton manning cyst. Peyton manning stat. Peyton manning lost the fucking game yesterday. The final drive. I've got a question for you. Indianapolis fans. Does Tom Brady throw a pick six at the end of the Superbowl? Does Joe Montana throw a fucking pick six

Speaker 5:          00:45:54       is Terry Bradshaw. Does Ben Roethlisberger one of the most overlooked quarterbacks of all times sitting in home with fucking two rinks. Does he know? He doesn't. All right, so fuck all you fucking idiots out in Indianapolis. There you go. How was that? Did you like that? Right in your fucking ass. God bless the saints. Everybody. Huh? Do did they say drew Brees his name? What? Maybe three times when they finally figured out he's going to win the game. Then they're like, oh, by the way, drew Brees is about to break Tom Brady's, you know, single fucking Superbowl record for completions there. I got it out. I've got a little started there for a second, but it got it out. Unbelievable. Unfucking believable.

Speaker 5:          00:46:39       You know something. This is how fucking bad and Nadeem bad. How fucking I predicted the IC got Keith Robinson to fucking apologize to me. Keith Robinson, classic black dude doesn't like white people. Hates cops. Okay. There's no reason for him to apologize to me. He actually apologized. He goes, you know what? You're right. You were right about this guy. Uh, I feel vindicated. Vindication. What a great emotion. So there you go. There you go. Congratulations to the New Orleans saints. Okay? And I know what it feels like to fucking have a great team. And nobody even fucking talks about you. Do they even bring you guys up for half a second? Oh, by the way, Big Bang. The luncheon city, the amount of shit that you guys have been through down there. How many Superbowls had been played in New Orleans? How many times have you seen people from other cities come to your town and feel the joy of winning a championship and you just sat there, you know, with your beads and your chicken foot and you're Voodoo.

Speaker 5:          00:47:39       Go on. When the fuck is it going to happen for us? Well, it finally did. Congratulations. You're totally fucking deserve that. Your defense was the shit. Even when the culture receivers, we're catching balls. I mean, you guys were hitting them. They look like they, they'll like many, many explosions. You will not get them off their feet. Totally fucking deserve it. Can't be, could not be happier, could not be happier. Not only did you know, I don't know, it feels like to wait for a fucking championships. So congratulations to everyone down in New Orleans. And I also want to thanks the saints for fucking proven me right? Proven me right. There you go. There you go. All right, so while you fucking analysts, hey, then you, and are you a pas at ESPN in Bristol, Connecticut. You listen to this shit. Why don't you go play it to some of those jerk offs at Upi? Have on the fucking hair. Who can't do anything, dude, I'm telling you, they'll even go on. I'm even watching a little bit of shit this morning. This is loosen me. I'm stuttering. I'm so fucking pissed right now. They're still not saying, ah Brady. What's his face paint and blew it. They keep talking about drop passes. Ms Field Goes, get the fuck outta here. Pick six nail in the coffin. Thanks Peyton. You know he was going to lose you see all tanned up. He was,

Speaker 4:          00:48:54       oh

Speaker 5:          00:48:55       Jesus Christ. It's going to be a great week. I feel fantastic. You know, especially as a fucking Boston fan, you know what I mean? I already watched, I watched the Lakers come in and win another one. You know, I watched the Yankees win number 27 was I actually got to sit here and have to watch the cults when to and prove me wrong. That may be Peyton is let's be puberty. Peyton maybe is, maybe Peyton is one of the greatest of all time. Fucking unreal. I had this one guy this week was sending me an email saying, you know what Dude, if uh, if I, you know, if, if Peyton played for the dolphins, I don't know what year this guy's talking. He said they definitely would win at least one championship and it Brady went there. You know, it wouldn't have made a difference. Yeah. Why would it make a difference?

Speaker 5:          00:49:42       Brady only is cool under pressure. How many fucking Superbowls does that guy have to fucking win on the last drive to get some respect? I don't get it. I don't get it. I don't get it. And what about Ben Roethlisberger who has twice as many fucking rings as Peyton Manning? Okay, let's look at Peyton Manning's brother Eli Manning against the Patriots. Tom Brady, once again drives them down the field for the fourth fucking time. For the go ahead score. Huh? Did Eli get nervous? No, he didn't drove him right down the fucking field and did what his big brother didn't do. Oh, I would love to hear that awkward phone call today.

Speaker 4:          00:50:21       Ah,

Speaker 5:          00:50:22       sorry. I'm sorry to everybody who doesn't listen. Yeah. You know what? I'm not sorry. Fuck you. I was right. I always write. Okay. This is the Monday morning podcast. I'm fucking strutting around like a God damn rooster here. Loving life. Anyways, let's get down to the podcast here. Um, last week I worked in a, I worked in Irvine, California, and uh, I worked at the, uh, the Improv for the first time. It's just south of Los [inaudible]. And uh, I gotta tell you something. You guys ever watch that show, uh, the real housewives of the Osi? Of course you don't. Why would you? All right, but do you have a woman in your life who dominates the TV once a fucking week whenever that show comes on? You know, you can't help but see it. Right? I remember watching that show going like, there's no fucking way. You know what I mean?

Speaker 5:          00:51:12       You know, it's a TV show. They take the extremes of different areas in the dumber you addicted like the Jersey shore thing. You sitting there going, you know what, there's no fucking way people are that goddamn stupid. And then what happens? You go on youtube and you see bootlegs, bootleg cameras, you know, shots of the Jersey shore and you're like, Holy Shit, there's an element of truth to this. Now I'm not saying everybody in the Osi is a 63 year old cougar with their face yanked back. But uh, uh, wow. After, uh, after one of my shows, I hate a group of women coming up to me who collectively, I think their age was about 606. And um, if you saw it, I don't know these plastic surgeons to gets sued. Do these you ever seen Rhianna's Mugshot?

Speaker 5:          00:52:02       All right. It's not a mugshot. You remember the picture after she got the shit kicked out of her by a Chris Brown or wherever the fuck his name is. You remember that? Just picture that face except wherever her face was swollen. Just imagine if it was equally swollen. On the other side of her face, like it was a symmetrical beat down. That's what, that's what plastic surgery looks like rather than Evan one swollen up fucking Aye. You got to and there and you're like, wow, what the f did this person get the shit kicked out of him? But because they're too, and they're exactly perfect, Ula and you know, Michelangelo is dead. You gotta be like, well, he didn't kick the shit out of her. This must be plastic surgery. I'm talking like my eyes, my eyes were watering when I looked at their faces and, uh, they, they, and they all get like the, the, these, uh, those, those fucking lips and then not even in it was a, it was a fucking nightmare.

Speaker 5:          00:53:04       But anyways, uh, but you know what I mean? So of course I bring that up on stage and there was like a talking about plastic surgery in, uh, the Osi in Orange County is like bringing up Scientology in Hollywood. It just gets really fucking quiet and awkward. So anyways, but I want to thank everybody who came out to my shows and, um, actually, you know what? I had one person come out. Uh, you know, a lot of people who are in this business and a lot of people who aren't in this business, they try to act like they don't give a shit about fame and they don't care about celebrities. Well, I am not one of those people. I love famous people and if they even look in my general direction and acknowledge me, it actually fills me up inside. That's how fucking insecure I am, right? So Thursday night I'm doing my show down in, uh, down in, uh, for the fuck was I Irvine, right?

Speaker 5:          00:53:55       Yeah. Belt. We know you're there. We're not arguing. Just get to the fucking point. I'll, right. So I'm standing there after the show, whoring myself out, I'm selling my DV Dvds. I'm shaking hands and kissing fucking babies. Right? And all of a sudden this like famous people, they just got that thing, man, I didn't even know who the fuck this was. This woman comes up and really quickly, like two seconds just goes, hey, I thought you were great and shook my hand. I felt that electricity. And then she went away. I was like, God damn, who the fuck was that? I just got done shaking like fucking a hundred hands, nothing, nothing. Regular Hallway Accountant, a plumber, eight as a college student, she comes up, she fucking unbelievable. Felt a connection and then she ran away. I'm looking at it, I'm like, well, that looks like a Tonya contain is how I was standing.

Speaker 5:          00:54:46       And he evidently, it's tawny [inaudible] and I walked in there and someone goes, hey, they just, that was tiny container. If you don't know who the fuck that is, she was the best looking video girl for my money out of all the heavy metal movies of all fucking time. The Whitesnake video, you know the one she danced on the cars. I didn't like that one. I like what she danced at the foot of the bed with that little mini skirt, barely covering her little a whatnot, you know, lifted her fucking leg up like a fucking show pony, you know? I know that doesn't mean shit to you kids nowadays, but this was pre internet, Internet porn and all that type of stuff. All you had was Victoria secret and your imagination. I guess you could rent points at that point, but I was too fucking young and I was like Eagle in you begin to think of a book and read.

Speaker 5:          00:55:29       So I never rented one. Okay, so that's as far down the fucking pussy rabbit hole I had been as far as video pussy and a unbelievable unfucking believable. So I don't know, you guys probably think that's a lame fucking story, but I got to tell you something. When somebody who you used to jerk off to comes up to your 20 years later and says, Hey, great job. That's a special moment. You know, I had a lot of special moments this week. I really did. You know what? I didn't want to beat on my car. I like saying that I don't want to beat him my car. The reality is I have a Toyota Prius and it has a, what looks like little breath mints for tires. And I didn't feel like driving it down in the fucking rain. So I went out and I rented a car and I rented one of those dodge challengers, black on black.

Speaker 5:          00:56:19       All it had was the v six, just waiting for all the gear heads to get done. Ah, dude. That's a fucking bitch. What'd you suck a Dick after you drove the, it was a v six 3.5 liter. It's still moved the car. It was a, I'm telling you man, even if he get the v six dude, you're going to feel like fucking Steve McQueen in that car. That car is the shit. I think it's way better than the Mustang. I rented the Mustang when I was in, uh, Fort Lauderdale. So all I have left to rent is the new Camaro. I like all of those cars and, but I got to admit, man, the challenge of man, that fucking, you know what it is? It's the forefront lights for headlights in the front. I don't even, I don't even know if one of them does, you know, if two of them are just dummies or they just, you know, they're like blinker lights or something like that.

Speaker 5:          00:57:04       I don't know what, but it just reminded me when I was a kid that was a sign of status to me, you had the forehead lights cause I was always into the caddies. You know, in the late sixties one they had the Ford, you know, the two and two and they were on top of each other. And then for some stupid fucking reason in the 70s they put them side by side and they just didn't fucking look right. But, um, I dunno, I, I would really, uh, I think I'm going to get one of those cars at some point. I've got to find out how much they are and uh, you know what I mean? Cause I'm an insecure guy. I mean that's a perfect car for a guy like me. You know, look at me. I'm a winner. Rife of a window.

Speaker 5:          00:57:43       Dodge challenger 41 nothing. Alright. Anyway, uh, let's get on with the podcast here. I got a lot of different uh, sections to this. I'm hoping you guys are actually listening to this. If you are, that means I figured out my new podcast server that Mark Marin have dubbed the WTF podcast too. I'm going to try to have on as a guest, uh, in the next month. Um, this is my new server. It's costing me about 36 bucks a month and I'm still not charging for my fucking podcast. This is a little bit of guilt, so, you know, I figured you guys can pay me back. Don't steal my DVD online. All right? Go on in order the fucking thing. I'm giving you a podcast every God damn week. Now, I'm not going to be, I'm not gonna lie to you. I don't expect anybody in Indianapolis or re anywhere remotely related to Peyton manning to buy my DVD.

Speaker 5:          00:58:33       But the rest of you, sons of bitches just go on and pay for the damn thing. Okay? We spent a lot of money on that. They gave you a bunch of extras or come out to one of my shows. Pay me back that way, okay? And whatever. If you're in between jobs right now and you're going through a rough time, here's some free fucking comedy. But when you hit it big, remember, remember who fucking held you up? Huh? When you look down in the sand and there was only one set of footprints. That was when I carried you with my podcast. Look at me getting all biblical. Why are you getting biblical bill? I thought you don't believe in that shit. You know why? Cause I have a confession. I've got a confession to make to you guys. You know what I did on Sunday and I think this is why Peyton manning got his fucking ass kicked.

Speaker 5:          00:59:20       I actually hope you're all sitting down at this point. I actually went to church on Sunday after all the Shit I talked about organized religion and all that shit. I actually went, I went to church, I went to fucking church. And uh, I don't know why it's one of these deals is something about I haven't been drinking. I'm trying to clean up my act and the last 20 years, you know, I've just slowly become a complete piece of shit and I'm really trying to get back to who the fuck I was. You know, I used to be a good guy. I used to not be cynical. I used to believe in people. I had hope. I gave to charities, you know, I was a fucking swell guy, you know, 20 years of being on the road, drinking who was corrupt club owners fucking me over at the end of the weekend.

Speaker 5:          01:00:13       You know, you start to uh, I got no excuse, whatever, I'm weak, I'm so whatever. So I was like, I don't know, I need to, uh, I need to do something good. So I was actually, this is how far I went. I actually considered going to confession and not even because I believe in the shit. I just wanted to see what the priest was going to say. Cause I, I never, you know, at the risk of burning some of my new material, I just never bought into that shit that like I have to talk to God through you. You know, now you're, you're some sort of voice and you want to listen to all the fucked up shit I did. As you look through the fucking screen, pretending you're not looking at me, you know, plus I gotta admit, I kind of want to see how many our fathers and hail Mary's I was going to get considering the last time I went to confession.

Speaker 5:          01:00:59       It was simple stuff. Like I beat up my brother, you know, I, uh, had impure thoughts about my fucking, you know, whatever English teacher or some stupid shit, you know, why is that a sin? Doing ice, have this fucking language teacher. When I was in middle school, we didn't have junior high. It's just fucking girl was so fucking ridiculously hot. Right? And she used to wear these dresses with a slit going right up the fucking side. You know, it's a little Italian girl. She was short. So she'd wear the sky high, fuck me shoes. You know, every once in a while she'd give us a treat once a week, you know, she come in with those fucking things on it. It was really, it was ridiculous. Um, and not only that, she was, she was my French teacher. She's trying to teach me a different fucking language.

Speaker 5:          01:01:47       Right. So one week she comes in, she literally has a slit going up both sides. And she had this habit, she'd, she'd write whatever she wanted us to learn and she would step back. So she'd have one foot, like, I don't know how to explain it. It's like if you're a wide receiver and he looking at the quarterback, checking for the audible, you got one foot in front of the other. That's what she's doing. But she's got a slit on both sides. So now not only do I see a slip and the outside of the leg, I can actually see the inside of her fucking thigh on the other side. I am in eighth grade. Okay. My Dick is that his fucking, you know, saluting the troops at that point. I'm not listening to what the fuck you saying in English, forget about in French. And then she ends up calling on me as I'm sitting there with my little Woodrow Wilson, right?

Speaker 5:          01:02:31       And she's like, ah, you know, fucking whatever the fuck she said in French. And I had no idea. And I tried to play it off and then she got all fucking mad at me because I lied to her and I didn't have the emotional maturity be like, really? Why don't you put some fucking clothes on sweetheart? And maybe I'll pay attention to your fucking language lesson here. All right. You stand standing here with half your fucking hoo ha hanging out. You think I'm looking at chalk on the board? You asshole. But I didn't, I just sat there and stared at my books as she screamed at me. And, uh, when she told me to go down in the office, I did, didn't even put up a fight. Then I missed my bus home and then I walked home in the rain fucking saying all this shit that I wish I had the balls to say, but I didn't.

Speaker 5:          01:03:14       All right. That was a sad memory. Okay, let's plow ahead here. So anyways, so I decided, I'm like, I gotta go, I'm going to go to fucking church, right? I got, I got to start doing some something good in my life, something positive or whatever. And for some reason, I don't know why. I'm going to church because I don't believe in this shit. I don't, but um, I don't know. My girlfriend's mom goes to church every week. She's a sweetheart. I'm like, you know, fuck this. I'm going to go to church with my girlfriends mom. Huh? That's a nice thing to do. Right? Then all my female listeners just go walk. Did you just do that? Of course you did. It's a fucking nice thing to do. So, you know, and I'm going all out. I haven't gone to God's house in like 20 years. So I'm like, what am I going to do?

Speaker 5:          01:03:56       Go there with a button down and some jeans and some shoes. Fuck that. I broke out the tonight show with Conan O'brien, suit number, that shiny one that some of you cunts bitched about. Some I fault is fucking HD. And you can see the inside of my nose. It looked good and real life anyway, so I put that on. I'm looking like a fucking million bucks. So maybe I'm looking a little ray Liotta. I don't know how I'm looking, but I'm feeling good, right? Went to church and I walk in. What's the first thing I see? I see a big Jesus nailed on the cross, you know? And as he looking at me, no, he's looking down and I'm like, is he looking down because he's in pain cause he's slowly dying from this torturous device or is it part of the guilt? Oh look, I dude, for you, hope you appreciated.

Speaker 5:          01:04:38       You know, so I'm a guy. You think thinking negative bill, don't think negatives is a good thing. It was a sunny day. You know, it's been raining out here. La has never more beautiful than right after it rains. Wow. That was the cheesiest thing I've ever said. I should just broken into a fucking song right there. Reminds me of my mother now. You'd already as it fucking, I don't know what beats down all the smog and you can actually see out to the ocean. It's fucking awesome. So anyway, so I sit down into the pew and I got to admit, it's kind of bringing it back. Good memories. You know, we used to go with the family. I used to go to church every fucking week from like third grade till I was like

Speaker 1:          01:05:18       22 I don't think I missed a week. And I go with my family and then afterwards we go to fucking Dunkin donuts stowed and we get some fucking donuts. I don't know why we get a dozen donuts and then we go home, have Sunday breakfast, and then we all sit around eating donuts. While we did. It was a good thing though. It was a family thing. So part of it was like, wow, this is what I actually felt better that I was in there.

Speaker 5:          01:05:43       Right as I was starting to feel better. First fucking words out of the priests mouth is a, he goes, hey, thanks for coming out everybody. I see a, I see you all came out here early to get it out of the way. She could watch the super bowl. That's what he says right off the bat comes with the guilt. What do you mean get it out of the way? Fucking game comes on at three 30 out here. What do you got? A three o'clock mass. You asshole. You don't, I'm not getting it out of the way. How about this? Um, I made time for it. You fucking cunt. I still have to go to the grocery store and buy the fucking hamburger. I came here first. It was right out of his mouth. First thing you fucking says, all right here. You guys all came here and only here

Speaker 1:          01:06:26       one to suffocate him with that fucking Smocky he was wearing. I was like, no, no, no, no. You don't try to think fucking positive. Trying to think positive. Stop looking at the negative. Cause there is an element of this that does feel good. There's an element of this that feels right. So I'm still sick

Speaker 5:          01:06:41       now. You know, and uh, then all of a sudden they start reading the stories and here comes the reader. If you're not Catholic, they always have a reader and they read a couple of, a couple of little Jesus did he sing a couple of songs and then the priest comes in and he fucking brings it home. Like the headliner, you know, reads a little bit of Gospel. So I don't know what this guy's doing. If he's reading scripture, I don't, I don't know. I don't know the fucking words. I don't know the technical words. So anyways, the reader for this week comes up. I swear to God, he's like fucking 45 years old and I shit you not, he's wearing a boy scout shirt, a fucking boy scout shirt, and he has facial hair, a boy scout shirt and facial hair, and you're in your forties I'm I the only one who sees sex offender, you know, and you would think with the scandal that has gone through the Catholic church, they'd be like, hey dude, we appreciate you coming in here, but could you take off the fucking boy scout uniform considering that's another organization that doesn't exactly have the greatest tap track record when it comes to little boys.

Speaker 5:          01:07:45       Right. But they don't. So I'm sitting there going, no, no, no, no. This guy's a good guy. This guy's a good guy. He stayed on the path to the right. Unlike you, Mr Burr, this guy, he stayed in scouting. All right. If he diddled somebody at this point, they would have figured it out. Maybe he's just a good guy. He knows how to start a fire without a match. Let's listen to what he has to say. All right, and what does he do? He fucking goes up there and he starts, this was basically the story. Jesus is standing on the edge of a lake as he is. You know what I mean? James Brown had the cape, Jesus has the lake. Everybody's got this shtick. It's fucking show business, right?

Speaker 1:          01:08:23       So Jesus is standing by the edge of the lake and there's a couple of fishermen. Of course, of course. There was like three jobs back then. You were fucking black. Smith of fishermen are a leper. Okay? So this is one of these fishermen stories, right? So the fishermen, Simon, and some other fucking Douche bag is sitting there cleaning out their nets and Jesus goes a Romy out Romy out, you know, 10 feet into the lake and they go, absolutely wasn't like we weren't fucking busy over here cleaning up after a hard day's work. So they roll the dude out there, he's 10 feet off shore, and now he's preaching to the people on the shore from a Robo. You know, I'm sitting there going, what a fucking arrogant ass, but I got to give it up to him. That's a little show Biz there. You stand on the beach, you're just regular.

Speaker 1:          01:09:06       All of a sudden you're out there in the water, you know, all of a sudden it's like he's got a stage, so whatever. So now he's out there like the arrogant ass. He is. He standing up in the boat, which you're not supposed to do. You're not supposed to fucking do that. He just breaking the rule. Just like when you see a cop speeding in a fucking cruiser, not using his directionals. He's not even on a call. What kind of fucking example you set. So anyways, he starts preaching, he's done preaching. He then tells these fishermen to take their nets and they go fishing. And they were like, wait a minute, son of God. Not trying to step out of line here. I know, you know, you came out of that debt vagina. That was never fornicated with, uh, you know, we've been fishing all day and well, you know, the risk of sounding crass, sounding crass, we haven't caught shit. So Jesus goes,

Speaker 5:          01:09:55       am I not the son of God? Did I not just tell you to bring your fucking nets out here? And they, hey. Yeah, sorry man. Will, what was I thinking? Right. Okay. By the little casino moment. How about stick your head to that little fucking hole. Yeah. You weren't laying, that's why he had the fucking money ready. Right. So they grabbed the fucking nets. I only know that quote because Joe to Rosa uses that line all the time. So they grabbed their fucking nuts and they bring it out to the lake and they go fishing. And what happens, not only do they catch fish, they catch so much fucking fish that it almost breaks their nets and they're dragging them back into that.

Speaker 1:          01:10:31       Jesus is the best shit ever. And then he looks at him, he goes, today, you caught fish. Tomorrow you're going to fish for men. And then they all walked away, evidently leaving their fish behind to follow Jesus to go fish for men. Can you fuck, I mean, what kind of a fucking story is that? You're hungry. You wanted the food. You're going to leave that to go try to pick up some dudes. And I'm listening to this with some guy with a fucking boy scout fucking uniform on. I'm not making any of this shit up. I was waiting for them to start playing the weather. Girls

Speaker 5:          01:11:07       Rain in men. I don't understand. I know it's a metaphor. You going to go fish for men? It's fucking Amway. We got to get somebody else to believe this shit. What a crock of shit. You didn't catch shit. And then he said, hey, put you, netsuite has done, we got a bunch of up. He said, come on, let's go tell it to more people so I can make more fucking money and live rent free and not pay taxes. So anyways, um, but I'm still feeling good. There's something about, there's something about going to church though. It's, it's getting me, get me in my chest is something that's still feeling good. Oh, I'm a master at telling story. Okay. I'm keeping the fucking, the, the, the, the, the peep, the blast for many people in this shit. And I'm also keeping the Jesus freaks. I'm driving you right to the fork in the road.

Speaker 5:          01:11:53       What, is he going to choose Jesus or is he going to keep trashing organized religion? Hang in there. Here we go. Getting into the third act. So then the uh, the priest there, the headliner, he comes up, you know, and I'm thinking, all right, let's, he reads the fucking Gospel and everything and now I'm waiting for it. He's going to say, and what does he do? He pops in a CD. All right? And all of a sudden we'll listen to some cardinal is some bishop from the Vatican doing a guest spot and you know, and what does the guy said he teach, he does some quick little bullshit up front going, praise Gigi. You praise him for a few benching, knows your news. Wonderful Day. And we'll, you know, give days to hear him. And G. G. G. Oh Geez. Right. And when he's done saying that Shit, little five minutes of that shit, just stroke stroking you with the Jesus stuff.

Speaker 5:          01:12:39       What does he do? Huh? Come on people. You haven't seen this episode before. What's his next move? What is the move after they bought a you up and hit you with the guilt and tell you how thankful you should be for Gigi, what does he do? He starts hitting us up for money. Start setting up sup for money for some of the poorer churches that aren't making it. And we got a quota. We got a $41,000 quota and we didn't make it last year. You know, it goes on and fucking on. Right? And right then. Right then my girlfriend's mother was hilarious. Leans over, she goes, of course you'd have to come this week because she knows, I think it's bullshit, right? Fucking guy in the cub scout uniform. Now they're asking for money. So we're laughing. And then the priests, when they finally, he, you know, he shuts off the boombox wherever the fuck.

Speaker 5:          01:13:27       Oh, I know it was a boombox, but they had it hidden so it seemed holy, you know, then he spends the rest of his homily telling people, you know, where to fill in their credit card number, like in an unbelievable detail. You pick up the envelope in the front. If you look over there and the left, if you fill in your credit card, I'm sure a lot of you don't have your credit card numbers memorized. Trying to make little fucking jokes, you know, and one of the things was, you know, if you don't want this to be a monthly, uh, um, deduction on your credit card, just, you know, check the box. I love that they're trying to get you every month and the only way they're not going to charge your card every month as if you do something. Then you know, that hope and all those fucking old people with hard of, and they're not going to check the fucking box in the next month.

Speaker 5:          01:14:13       I couldn't buy it. Right. They don't give a fuck. And then that was it. And then the mass ended. But there was something doubt still, I don't know. It felt good. You know what it was when I walked out and they were having their, their little fucking bake sale and they were having their raffles and I bought my girl's mom a ticket to win some fucking pots and pans and shit. You know, it felt good because you around good people. And that's what I hate about religion is because the people who show up, they're good fucking people and they getting fleeced, you know, you know it's funny. It's actually, I gave two bucks if you know, bought a raffle ticket for the pots and pans. And then we walked by another table and the lady's like, Oh, you know, this one's only two bucks for this raffle.

Speaker 5:          01:14:53       And I look what they're raffling off. It was one of those fucking, you know, Virgin Mary pictures with his like holy blood dripping down her face or something like that. And it's like, I really don't want that hanging in my apartment. Okay. It's just, it's creeping me out. I'll take some pots and pans, you know, and make a rump roast, have a little get together. Right. I'm not going to wash anybody's feet as they come through the fucking door. Leave that FGCs. Um, so anyways, there you go. Actually went to church and, uh, I didn't buy into any of the bullshit that the fucking guys with the uniforms on, we're saying, but there was something that I kind of felt a little bit nice and evidently they're having a car wash on Saturday. I'm going to go by, I'll go by, I'll get my fucking car washed.

Speaker 5:          01:15:35       Why not the car wash in my neighborhood? They're always protest and that they're not paying the fucking illegals to wash the cars. So fuck it. I don't know. So there you go. That artist sparks some fucking discussion. One side's going to say, I sold out and the other side's gonna to keep trying to push me towards Jesus. It's not going to work. I know what the feeling was when I went in there. That's that overall natural spirituality that you're born with, that uh, organized religion. Okay. I'm going to give them a bent, the benefit of the doubt that they started off with a good, uh, a good purpose, but they hoard it out. They whore out that feeling. But when you do something nice, you feel good. You know, I felt though, cause I was there with my girlfriend's mother and it was a nice thing to do and I wasn't hung over and I wasn't a Douche bag the night before I did my shows, everything was good.

Speaker 5:          01:16:24       I didn't hurt anybody. You know, I can do that without, uh, you know, you know I can do that and still have a fucking chicken sandwich on, on Good Friday. Whatever the fuck it is when I'm not, you know, tell me what to eat and when I can jerk off a fucking jerk off all I want. He cuts. All right, let's get to the topics here. Spend a great fucking podcast. She got to give it up. Come on man. It's been a great fucking podcast. Started off with some music I got into religion. I'm, I'm feeling this one and right now when you know what I'm doing right now, you think you think I'm fucking pat myself on the back? I'm not, I'm actually killing time right now because I'm trying to get to the fucking, where the hell is it? The questions for the week. Podcast.

Speaker 5:          01:17:04       Quick questions. Click twice. All right, let's get into this. Let's get into this as quickly as we can and then I'm getting Outta here. Um, all right. Oh, here's a new one. This is what, this is one that I like because as you can tell, I'm really into sports. Um, I'm into sports the way I'm not into Jesus. And is that how I spelled obscure? O B s c u r e size. Spell obscure. It's not, you spell anything that's fucking, and that looks weird. That made sense to my brain when I wrote that. You know what's funny is I'm so fucking stupid. That might even be right. But now I'm looking at it and it just looks wrong. You ever do that? You have actually spell it right and you're like, there's no fucking way I got it right. I'm too stupid and then you look it up on the Internet.

Speaker 5:          01:17:53       Like Holy Shit, I got to write and actually got it right. I wish I could retain that information because I know God damn well. The next time I write it, I'm going to go through the exact same process again. That happens to me with the word restaurant. I can never remember if it's e, s t a,U r a n t or r e s. T. A fuck a R. A. U. N. T. I keep always forget whether you goes, all right, here we go. Yeah, that's, that's what I get for Sansa. Great podcast. Now it's going to fucking Peter out. Alright. Obscure movies, bands in books. If you guys have read a great book, if you've seen a really cool band and if you've seen a really cool movie that is not, you know, I mean don't, don't fucking recommend Lord of the rings. Okay? He's check out this band.

Speaker 5:          01:18:36       You too. You know, they got a Nigga, they got there, got a pretty good catalog, you know, just some shit that is um, you know, under the radar a little bit. Here's one foya that uh, one of my brothers actually recommended. They recommended the movie, the conversation that stars are gene Hackman, a young Harrison Ford and that fucking dude who plays Freightos. I can never remember his name, but he is the greatest IMD B I've ever seen in my life. Okay, go look it up. You know, he died tragically young of some disease is fucking horrible, but you can't mess with his IMD be he never did any meet the parents bullshit. This guy was in the godfather that he did the conversation. Then he did the godfather part two, then he did dog day afternoon, and then he did the deer hunter and then he tragically passed away.

Speaker 5:          01:19:24       It's not even tragic he did it. There's no reason for him to continue. Guy Was the shit I was actually reading up on him. He, I guess he was one of the reasons why, you know, Al Pachino moved down to New York to become an actor and he was like his best friend who was a really sad story. He was engaged to a Meryl Streep, phenomenal actor. And I don't even know his name, very tragic, whatever. But the conversation is a great movie and I think it's very, uh, it, it holds up and it's very, I don't even know what the fucking word is of this time, whatever the word is to say that. All right, here's something, somebody else, I'll recommend it. Somebody said, um, he's a couple of movies recommend you there, Woody Allen Pictures, um, that not a lot of people talk about. One of them is called whatever works.

Speaker 5:          01:20:08       I'm not going to describe it because I'll ruin it. All I'm going to say simply say is it's worth a watch if you've not already indulged. Also, have you seen the flick Allen did a few years ago, a few years ago called match point? Definitely not your average woody Allen picture, but it was really good. So I'm going to check those out. And somebody actually this weekend recommended, I can't remember. Sylvester Stallone, I talked about people getting microchipped and they were trying to say that's invested like demolition man was that the name of it was saying that movie was so on point as to what the fuck is going on right now. And they basically talked about the phasing out of cash and everybody getting fucking microchipped and if you fuck with the deal they turn your chip off. I think it was called demolition man. Um, if anybody knows what the name of it is, please let me know and I'll, I'll, I'll reconfirm it next week on the podcast.

Speaker 5:          01:21:02       Um, and here's a book that somebody saying, um, if you don't have to read Socrates, this woman from Germany, I thought that was really cool. Somebody from Germany, he's actually listening to this, actually recommended this sang Socrates is really dry obviously because it was for fucking 9,000 years ago. And, um, so they said, if you want to, I have a better read for you, which is based on the great philosophies of soccer, Socrates, Aristotle, and Plato, uh, is called Sophie's world is the name of the book and has the same core ideas and it really takes you to the edge of your mind. How great is that to describe a book? It takes you to the edge of your mind. See, I love stuff like that. There's no fucking way. I'm not going to read that Sophie's world. It's spelled s o. P. H. I. E. S. Come on man, start ringing.

Speaker 5:          01:21:52       Stop being a dumb fuck like me. Come on everybody. Let's, let's try it. Let's try it. Try to improve ourselves. You know, I'm trying, I went to church. I try not to fucking heckle dude. You know what's funny when I was there is I was saying prayers I had not seen set in like 20 fucking years. And this is one pray prayer after, uh, the homily at in Catholic Church that is like, it takes a minute or a minute and a half everyone to say. And it's like, and it goes on to something like we believe in one God, the Father Almighty, the maker of Heaven and earth of all that is seen and unseen, the Bible by, I don't even know what the fuck it was, but it was like one of those things where like I was just, I was just reciting it like a fucking Zombie to the point I was laughing because I couldn't remember it.

Speaker 5:          01:22:36       But as people were saying around me, I was just right on it. You know, kind of like when there was a song, if you're really into this band in high school and you hadn't listened to the song and 20 years and all of a sudden it comes out and you just fucking find in the words like, where the fuck are these coming from? Cause they, they get, they had embedded in my head 20 straight fucking years and not missing mass, um, or whatever it was. 14 years. All right, here's his last thing I'm going to read for this week and then I'm gonna do some overrated, underrated. Um, all right, here's some advice. Somebody was asking me about a broad over there. Dear Bill, uh, since you have no idea who I am, I don't mind writing to you and explaining my current problem I'm experiencing with a certain female.

Speaker 5:          01:23:15       And since you don't know me, you'll probably be more than honest. You'll be more honest than the girls I tell this story to. Okay, here's the deal. I'm currently chasing this girl that I've known for a year who for some reason goes through phases where one day I'm the greatest thing ever, and then for the whole next I could die from cancer and she wouldn't blink an eye. She also has a tendency to make me jealous on purpose for no reason at all. I've confronted her on the issue and her explanation was that she hates when I get jealous. All right? Right there dude. She is standing on top of an old Victorian House waving the where I'm a cunt flag. All right. Told you, you got to get away from this girl. This is the, you know what this girl's deal is? She wants to be in a relationship.

Speaker 5:          01:24:03       She doesn't want to be in one with you, but she doesn't want to be alone, all right? And in the back of her head, she knows she's wasting her time by hanging out with you rather than going out trying to find Mr, right? So what she's doing is, is rather than dealing with that herself, is she's taking it out on you, you know, and, and another thing she's doing is really sadistic is she knows that you like her and she's playing you. You know, just playing with you, playing with your fucking mind and just trying to see the shit that she can get you to do. Fuck her. All right, this, you know what? You want to fuck that girl. This is the guy you got to walk away from her. Walk away from her. Go hang out with your buddies. If you don't have any buddies, go get somebody.

Speaker 5:          01:24:44       Go hang out in a bar and do what I always say to do. All right, cause you're wounded right now and you're going to be in the bar and you can be feeling now will these girls don't make me feel the way that each other girl does. Fuck that. You got to beat that feeling down and you beat it down with alcohol and hitting on girls. You don't give a shit about getting the fucking game. It's going to build up your self esteem. Now I'm not saying be mean to these other girls. Don't take out your heartbreak that this other fucking chick gave you. Don't take that out on these other girls because then you become a con to go out there and fucking find out how your personality works. You know it's going to build up your self esteem. Next time she sees you, you got to fucking broad on each arm.

Speaker 5:          01:25:23       She's going to get competitive. Next thing you know, your Dick is in her fucking mouth, okay? And you finish in their son. All right, sorry man. I stood up. I stood up. I started feeling like a fucking coach. I want a little big there. Don't finish unless she says it's okay. All right. But if you bang are definitely wear a condom, you have fucking respect for yourself. You have respect for your body. All right? To go out there and talk some shit. Son, you had shoulder pads that be fucking banging on right now and send you out right through the fucking tunnel into some meat market. Okay. Overrated. Underrated for this week. Uh, overrated. This guy says children right off the Bat, I love this guy. He said, I'm sick and tired of people doing shit for the children. We got to do it for the children.

Speaker 5:          01:26:11       I understand that you need to look after infants and toddlers, but I remember being nine, 10 and 11 and at that age I really didn't give a fuck. I was too busy trying to hump some girl behind a garage, all the while trying not to get caught by the people who were supposedly looking after me. My parents, half of the little twats just want to fucking eat cookies and ice cream and play Xbox three 60 all day. So I say, fuck the kids. Help the adults that are struggling with bills and shit. I love that. What a fucking great guy. I love him because he's speaking from his heart and the right in the end, it petered out with his ignorance. Fuck the kids and healthy adults who are struggling with bills and shit. I love and shit. It really just knocks it down by fucking 90 Iq points right down to my level.

Speaker 5:          01:26:57       All right, I'll go with that one. Exactly. Why don't we help out the fucking people without jobs. And then this is how the his, his other one underrated, uh, he says whores and he spelled it h. O. A. R. S. I think that's hilarious because isn't bores spelt with a B, which is a pig, you know, which is another fucking derogatory term from a woman. So he's kind of combined whores and Boris Horse Hoa Rs. He said there's nothing like a good whore Hoa are, she will make you appreciate a good woman. I can't tell you how many times I've looked at a stripper or some country, little whore and thought to myself, thank God she goes, she goes home to some other dumb fuck wives and girlfriends hate them. But until you spend the night at a club full of skanks and horrors, you can't really appreciate a good woman. See, I liked that because it's actually positive for women.

Speaker 5:          01:27:50       That's right. That's absolutely right. I totally agree with you on that one. And that's the podcast for this week and I'm not going to go long because I think this was a fucking great one. I had a blast on this. Fuck that. I say a blast. How fucking old am I? I had a rocking good time. No, I did. I feel fucking vindicated. So fucking vindicated. Peyton manning was exactly who the fuck I thought he was and they were crowning him. King crown and him fucking King. And I'm not saying that that dude won't eventually become king, but you got to do some shit first. That's all part of that marketing shit where they're selling. They're just selling you a like before they ever do it. You know, fucking guys come in and lead. They get a sneaker contract before they gain a yard. It's bullshit.

Speaker 5:          01:28:36       When the Superbowl's when I'm in the end, drive your team down the field, tie up to score, winning her over in over time, and then I'll give it up to you. I'm not that much of a homer where I'm going to be, I'm going to be a conduit. You got to fucking do it first before people say you're the greatest. All right. I know I repeated myself, but you know, it's not, it's not a lot of times in life when I'm fucking right. And I was right on that. So congratulations to the saints and a, all the fans of the saints and all that. It was fucking awesome to see that you guys deserve it. Hope you make a bunch of fucking money down there and your rebuild the houses and you give them back to the fucking people who previously owned them rather than the consumer want to build cheesecake. Yeah.

Speaker 4:          01:29:11       Factories down there. All right. That's it. I'll talk to you guys next week. Have a wonderful, yeah. Wow.
