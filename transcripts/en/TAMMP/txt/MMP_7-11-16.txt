Speaker 1:          00:00:01       Hey, what's going on? Is Bill Burns time for the Monday morning podcast for Monday, July 11th, 2016 what's going on now? Why? Yeah, I'm recording this 6:01 PM on Sunday. July 10th. Still fucking light as hell out even though it's getting Jackie by the day. Um, I'm in a great mood. Uh, I think my Sciatica is Phi Psi. I think it finally went away. Um, like 90, 95% of it went away. Uh, that Mizzou said I was seeing who was fucking amazing winter again. She beat the shit out of me. Um, and show me this stretch from my leg. Brie. I just lay on the floor. I put my leg up against the door jam and it's been working fucking wonders for me. Um, and I really feel like I'm going to see her again next week. I just keep doing that stretch. Do all these other stretches. She was telling me all of this shit.

Speaker 1:          00:00:58       I, you know, I need to strengthen my obliques cause it's putting stress on my lower back, the whole fucking thing. My back feels amazing. And what's so great is my back has been fucked up for 30 years. You know, I did a podcast this week, not trying to drop any names, but stone cold Steve Austin, the stone cold. And that's the bottom line. Cause stone cold said. So I did his podcast. He's like, well we talked for like two and a half hours. Um, he's going to turn it into I think a part one and a part two. And um, I was talking to him on that podcast, how the first time I threw out my back, the two times, three times in my childhood, I throw out my back. Two of the times where's was doing wrestling moves, right? One was the figure four leg lock, which I've told you before, that's the first time I threw up my lower back.

Speaker 1:          00:01:49       Right. And then, uh, try to imitate a Gary Valentine. His kid was trying to show me how to do it. He did it and everybody went nuts and he wouldn't fuck it, let me out of it because all the fourth graders started flipping out like it was the WWF. Right. And then when I was like in seventh or eighth grade or maybe the beginning of high school, I, uh, I tried to pick my little brother up over my head, like Tony Atlas, his finish and move. And I swear to God, like three quarters of the way up my spine, it felt like it folded. And I just had it kind of dropped. My brother dropped them down on the fucking ground. Fortunately there was wall to wall carpet in cause it was leftover from the 70s there. Um, but anyways, uh, yeah, so my back has been fucked and then I was playing just pickup football and I fucked up my lower back.

Speaker 1:          00:02:38       And for the last 30 years, if I ever fell asleep laying on my stomach, like a, I woke up in unbelievable pain and had to literally like just slide down the side of the bed, get on my back and just start doing stretches for a half an hour to get it undone. And uh, that has gone away. And the cyanic things going away. And I guess I had no fucking idea. I thought, you know, like I stretch, you know what I mean? I get a massage and wants to be couple of years. I thought I was all right. But I guess all the way down the rights, I probably shouldn't do this. If I lose my health insurance, they'll just have to just splice together all my podcasts to get all my preexisting conditions. Um, that muscle that runs down your entire right side of that whole thing was spasming.

Speaker 1:          00:03:20       And then like half of it on the left side, the muscles in my fucking left thigh and left calf dude, she fucking slammed her elbow into the back of my fucking leg and was bringing it up. It literally felt like my leg was going to fucking explode. Um, but, uh, but it's, it's actually, it's been way better in like today. I just, I dunno, it just kinda felt so everything kind of like freed up and, uh, I'm just gonna keep going to these people and I'm going to try to get my back is, I had no idea how fucked up it was. I'm site and all these people going to do it. You know, you gotta go get an just go to a doctor, you know, these chiropractors that there's these [inaudible] or that just go to a doctor, get a cortisone shot and fucking get an operation.

Speaker 1:          00:04:08       And I was like, fuck that. The last place she ever want to get an operation on as your fucking back. Um, as far as I've seen, like you remember when they were operating on Bobby, yours knees and they just was scooping shit out. Next thing you know, he was like bone to bone at like 27 years old. Um, I feel like, you know, as far as they've come with knee surgery, back surgery, they're still in those Bobby your years and I just don't want to risk it. I would never do that. So I'm happy that I was able to do it in a noninvasive way and it's literally affected my mood and like a positive way. So I'm so psyched about that. But, um, as I mentioned before, um, Stone Cold Steve Austin's podcast, he's got a podcast, and I could not believe, I don't want to ruin anything that we talked to her, but I could not believe the similarities of, uh, wrestling to stand up as far as listening to the crowd.

Speaker 1:          00:05:06       You know, not getting them all the way to high before you're going to get off and building up your time. Like that's a big thing when you're, you're like a, a comedian starting out, like you're doing 10 minutes sets and then one night somebody tells you to do 15 and x extra five minutes. Doesn't sound like a lot, but that's like you coming up with another 50% more of your act. You know, there's a math workout. All right? In that, I mean, the five minutes is a lot of fucking time. And he was the same thing he would do. He would wrestle for like eight fucking minutes. And then one day he moves up and they go, all right, give us 20 minutes. He's thinking, what the fuck am I going to? Am I going to do this for 20 minutes? Um, but of course, you know, we don't get the shit kicked out of us, but, um, I will definitely a retweet when that thing is going to be on.

Speaker 1:          00:05:56       I had a great time with him and he in the, in the best way possible. He is exactly like when you see him, he's just completely no bullshit and all that. And uh, he wants to learn how to fly a helicopter. So we talked about that. We just went on and on and on and fucking on it. We just, it was just fucking awesome. A great guy and uh, definitely was beyond cool that I got to meet that guy. So I'll, I'll definitely tweet that when that shit is coming out. So anyways, let's get on with my, uh, my sports weekend here. I, um, I had a crazy weekend. I Saturday night say,

Speaker 2:          00:06:35       uh, I went, um,

Speaker 1:          00:06:38       by watch the UFC first of all and um, you know, I'm not going to blame the UFC for that one. You know, they kept hyping UFC 200 and that was supposed to be fucking unbelievable and all their great susposed to come back. And then what happened? You know, God and my grandmother, they had that big issue where he fucking loses and then he doesn't want to do some sort of Promo. I don't pay attention to the soap opera, the shit, right? Ronda Rousey's still not fighting and you know that they felt that those two are going to be on that card. So they're above, both are on the car. And then some guy named Joe something or rather tested positive for some shit. So you know, there was scrambling for bodies and I'm fucking is, oh my God. Am I going to say his name is an Anderson Silva? Is that his name? How can you fucking watch somebody so many fucking times? It just, I just know, I never know the names. I just fucking sit down and I'm like, oh, that's the guy who crawls in like a spider. He's going to kick the fuck out of this guy. Um,

Speaker 1:          00:07:38       he, uh, you know, he was supposed to be sitting in the crowd and neck three and three days later he's in the octagon. It was like the whole Vinnie test of Verde Shit. We're back in the day, you know, Vinny tested where he's like, he was sitting on his couch watching the game or he's like in the backyard, you know, putting together a fucking horseshoe pit or some stuff and all of a sudden he sees under send a plane for the jets. Yeah. Anderson Silva, he had to come in and um,

Speaker 2:          00:08:04       yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:08:04       fight Daniel Cormier, Cormier and I, you know, as much as a fucking douchey UFC fans were born, um, you know, cause they wanted to stand up against him. Anderson Silva, it's like what the greatest of all time and had nothing to fucking lose in this guy earned this title shot that got taken away from him or whatever the fuck this big fucking payday. And if he loses to this guy, then all of a sudden Anderson's coming back and he's the next contender in this guy's ass. The fuck out. Right. So he did what he had to do. We just kept taking on the ground. He stayed on top of them. You could hear him and his after he won going, hey listen, I did what I had to do. You know, you could tell he felt bad. He wanted to put on a show, but the guy fucking prepared for months and months for this other fucking guy saw the fight of the night for me obviously I think in everybody else was the, uh, was the um, mission to Tate.

Speaker 1:          00:08:55       Uh, Amanda Nunez. I'm saying all these fucking names, right? And uh, Jesus Christ. I mean that, I mean, that's of course what everybody wants to see. It's like when people watch racing, you know, as much as they want to see wheel the wheel, they want to see. So see somebody go careening into the fucking wall. We want to see a car, you know, hit a wall at 200 miles an hour. That's what the fuck they want to see. And fight fans want to see somebody get knocked the fuck out. Right. I'll get the shit kicked out of him. So I feel like the one thing that other than the first fight, whether it was at six foot seven guy, lot of dad bods for UFC, you know, 200, did I say 50 earlier on a fuckup talking about a lot of dad bods that was like the dad bod fight card.

Speaker 1:          00:09:39       Um, granted all of them, I obviously could kick the fuck out of a hundred normal people at a time, but that first fight there was like dead six foot six, six foot seven dude, which is hilarious to me. You're six foot seven and you gotta learn mixed martial arts. It's like, it's not enough. You can step on the average person like a fucking man. You're now going to add, add this whole other level of fucking craziness, you know? Um, that first guy, Jesus Christ, that first guy, whatever the fuck his name is, that guy looked like he was in the Bourne identity and he was like the head bad guy that you had to beat. He just came fucking walking in. He gave that tall dude, the old right there, Fred, and he was fucking done. Um, and the only two guys who were in shape with those, those, I don't fucking, I mean I don't know anybody's fucking name.

Speaker 1:          00:10:28       I have no fucking idea. You know, this is my deal. I ordered it. I tech any was anybody else go to tech store. Right. And you accidentally ordered it in Spanish. Like the way the text thing came out, it says order UFC and then it says, uh, no sports event. And then right after event was the number one, and then after done the next line it said UFC 200 number two, and then the next line said Espaniol or something like that. So you didn't read that, you just saw events and then you immediately went to the second line and you supposed to press one for English two was for UFC 200 in espanol. And I fucked the whole thing up. So I hadn't, you know, I had to talk to the fucking lady to get it, you know, the whole fucking thing taken off. But I'll let a lot of dad bods a lot of fucking dad bods until you got to the women they came in, they were like w and other than that featherweight fight that I can't fucking remember. Um, but I just hate when fucking when it goes to the ground, everybody fucking boots. You know what I mean? It's like this kid, you have a little respect for the person who's on their back, taken forearms to their fucking head. You Boeing, because they're not standing up.

Speaker 1:          00:11:41       I Dunno. People start chanting, stand them up, stand them or whatever the fuck they was saying. Um,

Speaker 1:          00:11:49       I dunno. To me it's a lot scarier to have somebody on top of you and you can't fucking move and they're just raining down on you and they're putting a glove over your fucking nose and mouth and you can't breathe. Like I'd be on the guy fucking kitten. All claustrophobic. I would tap out so fucking fast. Do you remember that? We remember that UFC fight with that guy just backed up the whole fucking time. The whole fight. He just fucking backed up. That would be me. And then you'd get me on the ground. I'd be like, Woo Ellie, just tap out. I would have to, I, I would say I have to leave the country after the fight, but UFC is worldwide. I would have to like move to mainland China, you know, not Hong Kong to try to somehow, and even then somebody gets some sort of bootleg shit, whoever is the son of that dude who sat and stood in front of the tank, you know, he'd have the fucking balls to get the UFC feed and then he fights, you know, walking around with my fucking okay God damn Whitehead just walking around in fucking China.

Speaker 1:          00:12:53       They spot me in a second. Hey, you're that fucking guy. And had screaming bitch from UFC fucking whatever. Right. So I don't know. I think those fucking people that go to the UFC got you got a lot of fucking balls bu in a professional fighter. Every time I watched the UFC it, I always, I always had some point, probably about 15 times during the night have to say these are like some of the toughest people on the fucking planet. Just like the, I can't imagine the mental place you have to go to when you're walking down there. No one you're going to fight somebody, especially as the fucking underdog, right? That it's just been training for three months with like some of the best people in the world. And their skill is how to beat the fuck out of you. Like they broke down your style and they're just going to figure out how to beat the fuck out of you.

Speaker 1:          00:13:42       It's like nauseated. How do you even get your raisin brand down there that morning? I mean, these people, they're on a whole other level. So, um, congratulations to amend Amanda Nunez, the first female Brazilian UFC champion and, uh, you know, I, I was loving me just to take, you know, always class act. He's fucking gorgeous. You know, it was hard watching her get busted up like that, that fucking, that upper cut that was perfectly timed. Ugh, Jesus Christ. Um, but anyways, so I did that and then a buddy of mine texted me and he said, why don't you come down to the fucking troubadour? There's some band playing down there. And I hope I get the name of this band right. Cause I went down and saw a band, I think they were called Earth lists. Yeah. Earth lists. Okay. And I'm still processing what the fuck I saw.

Speaker 1:          00:14:36       I went down there, I watched like three seconds of a youtube clip and I'm like, I gotta get out of the fucking house. Right. So I went down and that my buddy started drinking waters. It was really good that night. Right. And this band comes out, power trio, right? To guy in a strat, there's a fucking bass player and a drummer and that's it. And the guitar was starts playing immediately. You're like, wow, this guy can fucking play. And then the drum start coming in and then the base and then they just went into this epic fucking like, just imagine if you were playing an arena show, right? And you just, you're in, you're bringing home the greatest arena rock show ever. Like where your energy would be in the final minute before you said, right. Bragen row. Right. They basically started there and stayed there for a half a fucking hour. We're as far as I could tell once there was like four or five songs that we're all one giant song dude. It was, it was fucking exhausting. Just watching it and I remember about 12 minutes in

Speaker 1:          00:15:50       when they were ended. One part of it that you don't like the cliched endings to things. They would like add 15 minutes each at see it was fucking unreal. I just looked at the guy I was with and we just started laughing like this is fucking nuts. 20 minutes in I got to go up to the bar and get a drink. The fucking band is poor and sweat. They look like they're in a fucking sauna and they're still going and the guy on the guitar is fucking shred and out of nowhere you're like, wait, what the fuck song is that? What does that feel like? A couple of bars, they played that fucking part of dazed and confused, Doo Doo Doo Doo Doo Doo Doo Doo Doo Doo Doo Doo Doo Doo and the fucking guitar player, the drama that we're all doing and then he like, hey, that's daisy, daisy and fuse. It goes right by it.

Speaker 1:          00:16:31       Then they were into something else and then finally after a fucking half hour it ends right. It's fucking, it's and people are like, people are exhausted from just watching it and uh, I couldn't hear what he said cause I had my own earplugs in because I'm an old man. I eat psychedelic something was the name of the song, psychedelic infinity, psychedelic fucking a scrabble. I have no fucking idea what he said. And then they went into another song that was like five minutes long and then they closed with communication breakdown, I guess it was like three, four bands and they just played it like a quick like hour 45 minutes set and it was over and it was a, I like, it took me till like halfway through today to like process what the fuck I saw. I don't know how you would ever put together something like that, the complexity of the whole thing. But it was definitely worth it. And I heard all of their shows are different every time, but I was completely blown away by him. The band is called Earth lists. If you get a chance to see them. Um, I guess, uh, here is Wikipedia. They're on a San Diego, California, Isaiah Mitchell. Is there a, is there a guitarist?

Speaker 3:          00:17:51       I hope I sailed the names correctly. God knows, I always fuck it up. Uh, Mike [inaudible], e g, I n t o n was the bass player and then Mario, Mario, I'm never going to try with the last name. Rubella Kaba who I guess is also some fucking psycho skateboarder, uh, meet up the band and they were, they were absolutely fucking amazing.

Speaker 4:          00:18:14       MMM.

Speaker 3:          00:18:17       If you get a chance, he had definitely, uh, definitely check them out formally a professional skateboarder. So, you know what I instantly love about that guy. He's never had a real job. And I mean that with all respect. When I first started doing comedy, I used to work with the guy who used to have his first job. Was he a, he was a professional roller skater. He was about 10, 15 years older than me. So like he was like 18, early seventies Assam Shit. Right. And that's when like, you know, the rollerskating and that type of shit was at its height and there was magazines about it and I didn't believe him until he told me how he fucked up his elbow, what the maneuver, and he knew the name and all of that shit. And then he played drums in a band.

Speaker 4:          00:19:00       Yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:19:00       And then he became a standup comic and I was thinking like, dude, yeah, you, he's like, yeah man. He goes, I never had a real fucking job. I that I, that stuck with me. I think about that every once in a while, just like you want in life. Like I don't care if you never made any fucking like real money doing that. As long as you, you can pay your rent and you can eat, you know, you're not fucking homeless. If those were the three jobs you had in life, I swear to God, if there's an afterlife and God's looking at your resumes and like, all right, professional roller, skater, professional drummer, professional comedians, nothing else. Lee was fucking guy. All right, it's gone up, buddy. I'm looking forward to popping in this VHS tape of your life. See what's going on here. Right. Um, anyway, so let's do a little bit of advertising here for the week.

Speaker 1:          00:26:52       all right. You know what I missed today? I thought I fucking tape that I missed a fucking British Grand Prix. But uh, I ended up watching most of it on a youtube. Some French dude put it up or like

Speaker 3:          00:27:02       lady, um,

Speaker 4:          00:27:05       yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:27:05       and I watched most of it and uh, congratulations to a Louie,

Speaker 3:          00:27:09       the uh, Lewis Hamilton and fucking, what's his face? The Tom Cruise of Formula One. Nico Rosberg get panelized again. Fucking penalize them again. They fucked, they don't like the guy. Evidently he got too much information from his pit crew. Some was going on with his fucking gearbox. See every couldn't go from six to seven. He had to go to six to eight. He was saying that, you know, it caused a dangerous assumption. Shit. Yeah. He's guy. Every fucking, every race, every race, there's some sort of fucking deal. And he's getting penalized. He came in second but they bumped up down to fucking third, which is huge because now we only leads Lewis Hamilton by fucking three. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:27:46       Points. I, I'm, I'm actually taping it tomorrow I'm going to watch the whole race, but it was kind of fun to watch it and French.

Speaker 4:          00:27:52       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:27:54       Picking out words. I Dunno. I got to get like a tutor assumption maybe then I'll actually start to get a little better with that ship.

Speaker 4:          00:28:01       But um,

Speaker 1:          00:28:03       so now let me tell you, I think I got the standings here somewhere. Where the fuck is it? I got lyrics to Mac Davis, baby baby, don't get hooked on me.

Speaker 3:          00:28:12       I started this podcast a couple of times. I can't remember if I sang that yet. Baby Baby. But don't kid hooked on me cause I'll just use you and sits you free. I'm all right. Nico Rosberg has 168 points. Lewis Hamilton has one 67. They fucked him out of three points today. You know, he would have been up to one 71. Okay. Guys. I don't know. He's just constantly getting into, he's just constantly, I don't know, putting himself in a situation, I don't know how many fucking times can one man have problems. This is the third race of this year, right? Slammed into fucking his teammate at the Spanish. You slammed into his teammate at the fucking Austrian one, right? I think this is, then he got penalized. Two different, fuck, this guy's having a hell of a fucking year. I didn't see the press conference, but he had the had fucking tears in his eyes. It was looking like the kill even Cavaliers fucking coach there. Um, anyway, so I've been getting my back

Speaker 1:          00:29:11       taken care of and uh, the fucking gym out in the garage has been a Goddamn game changer. We finally got an elliptical out there, so that's it. If I can just stop eating like a lunatic, I think I can be under one 80 by the end of this writing season. Speaking of which, we're a recording, uh, we're doing the table read for episode nine tomorrow. The record on Wednesday, it's fucking great. And then we're on 10 and then the writer's room as far as going there, every single day is done. But, uh, we're now looking at the animatics and I got to tell you guys,

Speaker 3:          00:29:39       episode one,

Speaker 1:          00:29:42       episode one, there's a scene in there that we have been trying to get right for like weeks. So we've all seen it like fucking 20 times each and they finally animated if the way we want it to. We finally, we were able to basically see you. It's all about conveying your idea to them, you know, and they finally understood what we were trying to say and we watched it and we fucking died. I cannot wait for you guys to see this shit. And uh, oh man. If we get a laugh like that each fucking show, that's what we got to go for. If we can fucking make you laugh the way it made us laugh, where a bunch of jaded assholes so we can get you laughing like that. Um, I think we can, uh, I dunno. I think we can keep making some more of these very excited about it.

Speaker 1:          00:30:26       And uh, very excited to get out of the fucking writer's room. Now I back's feeling great and uh, I've been hitting the fucking gym, had um, told you guys want a bottle that fucking wheat. You know, I put up to 25 once in my life. I weighed about 165 pounds when I did it and I put it up one time. I always wanted to do it. I was always just too fucking little to do it. Uh, just my frame. I was never like a Starkey fucking guy. Like naturally. I mean anybody eats fucking pizza and drinks beer, you're going to look for little husky. But I'm just saying like naturally, um, I was just more of a middle weight and I did at one time for the fucking gym rats. You know that if you put up to 25 you get, you got the two 45 plates on both sides.

Speaker 1:          00:31:10       So that was like a big fucking deal. Right? So, uh, today I'm inching my way back, right? I put up one 75 twice. I could have done it three times. If I had somebody there sparked me, they could have helped me on the fourth one, which would have been huge because that's how you build up. But I've been going really sick slowly up from, you know, one 35 just going like 10 pounds at a time rather than back in the day. I'd go up 20, it's just been too much. And what I do is I wait, you know, like gone from one 35 to one 45 and then up to one 55 and I just make sure I can do before I tried one 75 I make sure 20 pounds below it, I can, I can do it like seven, eight times. And they did one 65 four times in one 75 two times.

Speaker 1:          00:31:53       So I felt pretty good about that, which means I could, I could probably bench my way at this point. I could, I could put up one 85 just makes me feel good. But, uh, and I got the atomic holds. I can now fucking do a little Ninja Warrior Shit. I can go from one side of my garage to the other. It's a bad deal for 48 fucking years old. Pegboards coming along. I can do like too thick to, uh, take it out like twice on both sides before I then fall down to the fucking ground. But I'm, I'm telling you, if I wasn't so busy doing this fucking show, I could actually get in great shape. I cannot recommend those atomic holds enough. They are fucking incredible. And they have all these different kinds. And just to the grip strength that you get, the core strength that you get, it's fucking amazing.

Speaker 1:          00:32:43       It's, this is the free advertising. Atomic holds a t, O, m I k. Um, and they have a website and they get all these different things. If you watch that Ninja Warrior Shit, American Ninja Warrior, which is on, um, it's on Mondays and Nia has always gone. They should do a celebrity, one of those fucking things. You should go try to go on and do one of those and it's just like, you know that there's no fucking way I could, I would fuck up that first jump at thing. But you know something, no matter how great, let's say I was fucking 30 years younger, right in the prime of my life, 18 if I fucking trade, no matter how much I trained. Okay. Which I don't think I ever had enough. I just don't have the gift to get into that kind of shape. But the, let's just say I could at 18, there's no fucking way ever I could ever make it up that last wall to me, that's the most, you know, out of all the crazy shit that they come up with, you know, is hard as it is.

Speaker 1:          00:33:44       Most of it is just being able to fucking hang on that shit there. Forget about it. I would fuck it. I would do about three steps up and we'll do the most embarrassing faceplant like I would do a face plant, but like it would be like I was running into a wall. I do like one, two, three steps and I would slip and I would slam my fucking button nose right into the fucking wall. And then that would be the end of me. And it would become a meme. It would become all of this shit. I would never fucking live it down. But, um, but I, the inspiration for my gym was all the shit that I did in the 80s, you know, when it was all about just doing your upper body and fuck your legs, walk around the chicken legs, it was that shit.

Speaker 1:          00:34:28       Little bit of Yoga. And then, uh, American Ninja Warrior, just looking at all that shit and just going on youtube and watching people who are training for it and these crazy fucking things that they build in their backyards. Um, you know, just the strength that they have. I mean, I'll never have to be actually do B if I ever do a muscle up. First of all, my head's going to go through the fucking ceiling. Uh, but I, I just, I just don't have it my age. I just, you just, there's just, you get to a certain point, you know, nature's just like, yeah, we're beginning the dying process. Okay. At this point you should have had a couple of kids and they should be handling the hunting for the tribe and a, you need to just sit around a fire telling stories about what you used to do.

Speaker 1:          00:35:13       So, um, I am excited though that I am, I'm able to do a once 75 two this is like such an 80 shit. Only old people get this stuff because I'm basically 10 pounds away from being able to have the 40 fives and then the 20 fives that was all like a big deal. Like you know when people would be doing pyramids ten eight, six, four, two, right. It was always like the fucking guys would come in. They put the 45 played on for 10 then they put the 25 add that right. One 85 they do eight reps of that. Then the 35 two oh five and then the 25 to 25 and then they do, and then everybody would fucking pretend they weren't looking when anybody went above two 25 if they threw one like 25 pound plates again, 10 of five pound plates. Nobody gave a fuck. But if you do the 20 fives on, now you're up to 75 right? If anybody put the three plates on, that's right when the bar starts to bend, right? I remember is at the gym one time and I saw this guy curl to 25 it was fucking unbelievable. This guy was the most dense human being I ever saw. And he would like bring it up and just go,

Speaker 2:          00:36:23       ha ha.

Speaker 5:          00:36:28       It's just like, what the fuck?

Speaker 1:          00:36:33       And I wanted to laugh. I know I've told you guys all those stories that we tell that guy, when I used to go to New York sports club and when I was living on the upper east side, New York, uh, near Spanish Harlem, I just take the fucking train down. There was one in the 70s I used to work out there. And, uh, this guy came in one day and he had to speak in a fucking bay, but bay, but don't get hooked on me. He had the fucking Mac Davis haircut. He had a fucking Bandanna on not doing some fucking a I heart. I heart Huckabees that Royal Tena Bonds, hipster horse shit. He wasn't doing that. He was like, he was one of these guys that just dress like how you dressed. Like he stopped looking at fashion at like fucking 18. He came in, he had fucking like the glasses slash shades all in one with a headband, the curly fucking hair, like a tank top. He had Larry Bird shorts on, his socks pulled up. He looked like Ken Patera. That's what he looked like. And he would fucking work out dude. And he would, when he would do a rep, he'd go,

Speaker 2:          00:37:41       yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:37:43       yeah. So you'd be in the gym and you just hear this guy over in the corner and he was a fucking monster. He didn't want to laugh. We just hear this guy in the corner unquote.

Speaker 2:          00:37:51       Yeah, yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:37:54       He would bring it down and go, and then when you push it up with, yeah. And then when he get to the last set, when he was pushing himself, he'd go,

Speaker 5:          00:38:04       right. I remember one time

Speaker 1:          00:38:07       he was sitting there, it was me and some other dude and all I've tried, I don't even know the other guy, but I can feel him laughing and all I'm trying to do is not look at him. And finally when he did that, she, ah, I fucking looked over at the other guy and he was curling any, it's, you know, he brought the curling bar down. He was just holding it and he had his eyes close with his back to the Ken Patera Guy, so he couldn't see him and he was just silently like crying, laughing. And I'm you dude, I, I don't, I think I was doing cardio Asub Shit, I almost fell off the fucking treadmill lunatic right out of Boogie nights. So, um, anyways, I sh, I mean, you know, at some point I'm going to post a picture of the gym. I don't like giving up pictures of my house, but it is just a fucking garage.

Speaker 4:          00:38:53       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:38:55       So anyways, I, I, I'm, I'm totally off the fucking rails here. Where, what else did I want to talk about? We talked about the Grand Prix. We talked Steven Adler, we talk Amanda Nunez, stone cold. Uh, it too. We're only a month away from preseason football. Always. Another thing I saw this weekend. Do you guys ever watched that live at Darrel's house? Darrel Hall of Daryl Hall and Oates. He had Joe Walsh on. What a fucking, every time I see that guy play, it's like, why do I always forget what an unbelievable fucking guitarist and singer that guy is. He came in and absolutely just fucking ripped. If you get a chance to watch that one, I think they're up online. Um, so I'm like VH one and then like this headbangers ball think came on and a Nia somehow got into it. She is promised me at some point she's going to sing. Um, oh, what the fuck is that? Saw that Queens rake song. I don't believe in love. She's been singing that, that in teenage Frankenstein, she just got into it. She, she loved it and thought it was silly all at the same fucking time. So maybe on Thursday she's a little tired today, so I'll have her come on and sing some of that shit for you. But at this point, let's get to some of the questions here.

Speaker 4:          00:40:11       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:40:14       I guess, well maybe before I do that, just I have to say, I do have to see something with all the, just the shit that went on in the over the past fucking week, you know, with those two guys getting killed and then the five cops get murdered. It just, I actually believe it or not, I think something positive is going to come out of this. I'm really hoping, I just feel like, I think everybody at this point, no matter what side you're on, if there's one to one side, two sides of it, whatever the fuck three sides, whatever the fuck it is at this point, I think everybody can kind of agree that whatever the fuck it is we're doing isn't working. And I'm, I'm really, I don't know. I don't know what it is, is horrific is all of that stuff was to watch. I feel like at this point that you know, everything on both sides was undeniable, that it was wrong and it shouldn't have happened. And I think I just, I dunno, I was fucking devastating as it was. I just feel like, I just feel like that was a bottoming out. I'm really hoping anyways and that it's going to turn around. I'm hoping, uh, cause I dunno man, that's this as just one of the fucking

Speaker 1:          00:41:34       worst, all of that shit. The worst shit I've ever seen in my life. Somebody just go on for that license. He just, I just kept replaying that, just wishing the guy said, listen, my license, can you want to reach for it? Can I get out of the car with my hands up? And you just reach in and get it. Just sold. That doesn't have to have, is a fucking kid in the car. It's just the whole thing was brutal, you know? And then the cops, Dallas is just down there. They're just trying to handle the crowd, make sure nobody gets hurt. And then just, you know, all of them, you know, I didn't, it was so fucking brutal. I didn't even look into the backgrounds of them, but you know, you know, people were married, had kids and the dad isn't coming home and she said the whole fucking thing is horrible and because it is so horrible, I, I'm really holding out that something positive is going to come out of that cause. Uh,

Speaker 2:          00:42:20       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:42:20       I Dunno. Cause what else can you think if you can't get something positive out of that, that's just too fucking devastating to even think about. All right, so let's get to the, uh,

Speaker 1:          00:42:32       the questions here for this week. All right, sweet. Hi Mr. Byrd. I don't know if it's the correct way to address someone you don't know in the U S. Dot. It's fine. It's fine. I like the call me Mr. Byrd. I'm old enough to be a minister here, uh, in Sweden. I would just call you bill, by the way. I don't want to Piss you off anyway. I was, I was wondering if you're coming to Sweden again. I quote discovered you on Youtube a year ago and I watched you every night while I put my son to sleep. Oh, that's great. He said, and I love laying in bed holding my mouth so I won't wake my son up. I would love to see you live. Greetings from Sweden a PSRF if my spelling mistakes, spelling sucks. Sorry Dude. You're fucking, your English is great compared to my shit, unless you just looked it all up and typed it.

Speaker 1:          00:43:19       I'm definitely coming back. I just got to figure out when, uh, my life has changed a little bit now that I'm doing this show. But, uh, I think what I'm going to do, I have this European run that I'm going to do and then I think I'm going to do another one possibly march, April of next year. Uh, but I'm also taping a special, I got to make sure when I go over there though, I'm, I'm, I'm bringing the fucking, you know, I don't want come over there with some halfass act. I'm not flying over the other side of the world to give you guys a okay show, but I'm definitely going to come back. I'd like to go back there and um,

Speaker 1:          00:43:53       well ideally I could go over there right before my special comes out and knock that out deck deck. That is ideally, that's what I could do. But I'm definitely gonna come back and maybe do a little bit of eastern Europe. Some of the countries that I haven't been to. Uh, we shall see, but I'm definitely going to come back like I've done the Sweden, Norway, Finland run two times already. And uh, I think I've been to Sweden three times, so because one time, but I think I just did sweet. Then the next time was Sweden. Uh, no way in Finland, but I'll definitely going to get back. But thank you so much. That's a really fucking, that's a thrill. That's someone that far away is watching stuff. Laughing at my

Speaker 3:          00:44:32       stuff. Thank you very much. Okay, here we go. Uh, Bill, I fucked up and could use a hand. All right. Let's see. Why did you fuck up? Hey, you all biscuit big and bitch. Uh, I fucked this one up and could use some of your broadcasted advice. I'm 26 year old guy living and working in the great white North Toronto to be exact and I love your podcast and all that shit. Thank you. Anyways, few months ago I started seeing this really sweet girl. She's pretty, she's thoughtful and she's as low maintenance as a 1991 Honda civic. Okay. It sounds like the beginning of a horror movie, everything's like fucking perfect. Right? And he literally says, perfect explanation point. She deserves to be treated right.

Speaker 2:          00:45:18       Okay.

Speaker 3:          00:45:18       About a month ago I was eating at a restaurant with a buddy when this smoking hot redhead comes up to me out of the blue and says, hey, you're cute. Take my number. Let's go out sometime. I should have said no. I have a girlfriend right then and there, but the excitement of having a babe throw herself at me was too much for me to pass up apps. A fucking Lulea was, that's like a fucking movie. We're not wired to pass that moment up. I'm not saying you go and do it, but Jesus, uh, he said I didn't have the damn strength to keep it in my pants. Later that night, after a few wobbly pops, I texted her looking to meet up. We did and we did the deed. I felt like a piece of shit.

Speaker 3:          00:46:07       Ah, yes. We've all been there as men. We've all been there and a lot of ladies too, which never gets any press because it's considered sexist to suggest that, um, here's where it's getting interesting and slightly complicated. Not even 48 hours later, I'm hanging out with my girlfriend when she gets a call from one of her friends saying, I have some bad news to tell you. Oh boy. I overheard the conversation coming from my girlfriend's phone and knowing exactly what the bad news was. I snatched the phone from her and proceeded to spill my guts and told her the whole story. Well, there you go. At least you're Amanda. Evidently the friend dead called was roommates with the red head and the redhead through social media and hunted me down and showed my picture to her roommates too. You can't, you can't get away with anything anymore. Look at this. The friend goes on to tell the redhead that I have a girlfriend. Oh Dude, this is what this is like. You're going to end up with nothing here. My girlfriend obviously was super upset, but being the sweetheart she is and after many many's, I'm so sorry. It's from me. She agreed to let me make, try to make it up to her.

Speaker 2:          00:47:14       MMM.

Speaker 3:          00:47:16       Kind of cheaters do this shit. I didn't even last 48 hours. Cut to two weeks later myself in three of my buddies since kindergarten or on a mountaineering expedition in Peru.

Speaker 2:          00:47:28       Okay.

Speaker 3:          00:47:28       Do what do you Jason Bourne,

Speaker 2:          00:47:30       what's going on here? Hot chicks throwing themselves at you and now you're in fucking Peru. Uh, a trip we planned since February and I get this panic stricken email from my girlfriend saying she parentheses the redhead had broken into my apartment and trash the place. See attached photos. Okay.

Speaker 3:          00:47:51       Do what the fuck women are fucking crazy. Let's just say, let's just say this. Okay. Like how was she hurt? She came walking up to you through her fucking clam at you. You fucking took it. Who? You're not in a relationship with her like voices. Lily crackers had a really shit, you don't have to fucking relationship with her dude. You need a cross. The cute, this fucking woman. This has to stop this whole fucking thing that would, women get upset. They can destroy property.

Speaker 3:          00:48:27       Let a guy go out and fucking trash some woman's car after she fucks around on him. He'll end up in jail and have to pay for the fucking car. Everything was smashed. My TV, one of my guitar, she cut up my bedsheets and the dubé. She even went so far as to throw all my towels in the bathtub and ran the water. How do I know it was the red head? The dumb bitch left a note next to TV. St cheaters never win or some bullshit like that. Give me a fucking break. She even bragged about the whole ordeal to her affirmation roommate. Classic Guy. He just writes sheesh. My borough friend called my girlfriend called the cops and a problem. I returned from Peru. I set up a restraining order against the redhead. You should fucking chart. You should, you should sewer. Here's the problem. All this drama has led to my girlfriend reconsidering her willingness to give me a second chance. Dude, his surreal thing. Anytime some fucking smoking hot girl just comes up and throws it at you. You know, it's a headcase.

Speaker 2:          00:49:24       Uh,

Speaker 3:          00:49:26       go with a fake name. Um, I, I feel real bad about the whole situation and want to make it work between us, but there's this little voice in my head says, let her break up with you and start fresh. I'm pretty confused. I was going to say that. Just start over again, dude. You're 26. What are you going to, you know, you got a dick. This is going to happen. All right? So he goes, I fucked up initially, but forgiveness then got fucked with in the forgiveness was retracted. Anyways, I hope your site, your sage advice is half as good as those fucking pies you make. Thanks a lot and go fuck yourself. Yeah, Dude. You know what you gotta do? You gotta walk and you got to have this crazy redheaded a bitch. Pay For your shit.

Speaker 2:          00:50:09       All right.

Speaker 3:          00:50:11       Jesus Christ. She takes no responsibility in that. Just walking around, throwing a fucking pussy and everybody, I mean, what the fuck he thinks going to happen, you know, is a guy you could walk around throwing your Dick at fucking people for, for years and not get, this is why there's the double standard. You know, if a guy does it, he's a stud because he has to convince people just the way we're set, it was just, it's the way we're set up. Okay. Women are no better than guys. It's what it is, is the way they're set up anatomically is they're letting someone enter their body. That is a major decision. Sticking your Dick in something. It's, you know, it's funny. It's like, you know, it's like putting Sera back in the cabinet. I mean, you don't even fucking think about, um, I probably, you know, that was probably ignorance in there. I, yeah, I would just say like, you know what? You're right. I fucked up. That's a really big pet peeve of mine that fucking women get to do shit like that. They teach us, get to walk around, destroy your Shit, just fucked up your TV and all that dude. Then you just in your whole thing is just like sheesh. Like we're like, we like,

Speaker 3:          00:51:25       we're just conditioned to be like, all right, well that's what they do. They ruin your stuff, dude. You are 100% the wrong. You shouldn't have done it. It definitely did a piece of shit thing, you know? But that doesn't give somebody the right to go to break into your fucking apartment that's breaking and entering and destroying property. She should be in jail.

Speaker 2:          00:51:46       MMM.

Speaker 3:          00:51:47       This is what you do. I would break up with her and uh, I would, I would, yeah, I would try to take legal action against the red head and at some point I'd s you know, you want to send her a note, but don't do it. Just say, yeah. Breaking and entering, you know, fucking felons never wind either. Whatever the fuck that is.

Speaker 2:          00:52:03       MMM.

Speaker 3:          00:52:05       Yeah, Dude. Whatever you know it happened. And uh, you know, you know what I would do with your 26. Stay single for a while. Stay single for a while, go to the gym, get back in shape, figured out what the fuck you want to do. Do you want to fuck a bunch of women or do you want to meet the one? You know, I, but I, I think at this point, dude, you got enough fucking drama. I can't believe she gets to do that. Like first of all, she got laid the redhead, she got fucking late. You know, she had a great fucking time and she gets to bust up somebody's place, like a fucking rock star and then walk out of there and feel like she's a fucking hero.

Speaker 3:          00:52:48       This is why I don't give a shit that they make less an hour than I do. Because when you add up all the fucking parks, I mean, it's a pretty good goddamn deal. Being a woman, you know, you get all your emotions out all the fucking time. You get to break up people's Shit and you get to live longer than men. I don't know what the fucking problem is. You're going to complain about an extra 79 cents. Alright. Um, ex wife wants me to adopt ex's son. Hey there. Bill Burlington coat factory. I usually laugh at some of the poor schmucks. Who right into your, into you asking the advice today. I'm that schmuck. I won't go into every little about this and hope she can give me some advice. A few years ago I married my soon to be ex wife. Dude, I was so fucking thinking about that woman ruining your apartment and how they can just get away with that.

Speaker 3:          00:53:37       Let me, let me, I wasn't even paying attention. I mean it's again, I am today. I'm the smock. Okay. I won't go to every detail. All right. A few years ago I married my soon to be ex wife along with the marriage came or two year old son. His biological father is a deadbeat who didn't hold down a job and avoids child support. He has never had any contact with the sun. Wow. All right. So I did the most manly thing that one can do besides going to community college. I put on my big boy pants and I took her son in is my own. He Calls me Dad and whatnot. We bonded. I really care for the kid the first few years of marriage, my wife for great, which ended up leading us to having our very own daughter. And then my wife turned into a whore. Oh God. What happened? Uh, so we're going through the divorce and I still pick both kids up, even though I'm legally responsible for one. I carry her and her son on my insurance to this day. Maybe against my better judgment, but I'd like to give her some time to get our shit together until I drop her off,

Speaker 3:          00:54:40       drop her off of it. Complete dropper out of it. I think been sick completely. Well, the finalization of the divorce papers is in August. The soon to be ex mother in law keeps insisting that I legally adopt her grandson. No, don't do that. Now here's the thing. I send a very gracious amount in support payments biweekly.

Speaker 4:          00:55:00       MMM.

Speaker 3:          00:55:01       We choose to not go through the court system because my ex sees that I'm a good father and still take responsibility of her son. Keep it like that. I flat out said, no, I'm not legally adopting him yet. Your fucking mother in law does not want you to legally adopt him because she thinks you're a good father. Okay. She's looking at you like an ATM machine like a lot of women do with men, which once again, you can't fucking say that despite the 10 million fucking examples of it, it's considered sexist. All right? One wrong move. And now the court system has me by the balls for support for two legal, uh, children. What, what happened? Yeah. Yes. It flat out. Yeah. He said and flat out. No, because one wrong move. And now the court system has me legally by the balls for the sport of two children.

Speaker 3:          00:55:49       Yeah. There's no fucking reason for you to do that. They don't hold anything over you. They have no negotiating, nothing. Uh, the mother in law is in sit unless they try to keep your daughter from you. The mother-in-law's insisting that if I don't legally adopt him, I'm a scumbag who doesn't deserve to see him. And he was gone so far in so many words to say, I won't be seeing him. She's even getting my ex on board with this. Like I said, I really care for the kid. He's a good kid who will never had a father figure until I came into his life six years ago. What's my play here? Thanks. And Go fuck yourself. Uh, what you're seeing with these two fucking lunatics,

Speaker 1:          00:56:24       um, generation fucking psychos here, uh, is the tip of the fucking iceberg with these people. Okay? They don't give a shit about you. They're looking at you like an ATM machine and they're already fucking with you. They don't, they don't have that kid's best interest in mind. They think they do. They don't. They using him as a fucking negotiating tool. All right. I'm surprised they haven't said, well, we'll fucking go for full custody with your daughter and try to fuck with it. That'll probably be there next fucking move. And it's the thing with them, okay with them. It's the more you're in their lives, the worst it's going to get. Do not legally bound yourself to them whatsoever. And this is what I would do. Do not get emotional at all. Do not get into a fuck you. Fuck you. Fight with the mother in law. Do not get into a fuck you. Fuck you. Fight with your soon to be ex wife. You have leverage in that your ex wife, as much as she's, you know, going to divorce you here still cares about you. You guys still had a child together

Speaker 2:          00:57:36       and

Speaker 1:          00:57:38       you just have to just talk to her logically and just say, I'm not comfortable doing that. Um, but I'm going to continue to make payments and support and all that and help you out with your son and obviously our daughter. All right. Um,

Speaker 1:          00:57:56       and this pressure that you're, your mother-in-law is putting on, this is only going to make both of our lives miserable. So what you do is you, you, you divide and conquer there. Just say, I have no problem with you and the way that we get along. I don't think your in mother-in-law understands. And that's why she's applying this pressure. But that pressure is, it's going to be bad for us and it's going to be bad for our kids. Let's just continue going on like this. I love you son, and you know I'm going to continue to support him. That's as far as it goes. All right. And I totally comfortable with supporting them. I'm giving you my word, but I'm not, you know, I'm not doing the legal thing. I'm not doing it. And you just, that's it. That's it. And if they want to keep coming at you, I'm telling you right now, if you do think that, if, when you legally adopt that kid, do you honestly fucking think that that's going to be the end of the demands? What the fuck is the mother-in-law involved in this shit for anyways? Right there. That's a nightmare. That's a fucking nightmare situation. And so many married women have that fucking debt, ridiculously close relationship with their mom. You know what I mean? And it it to the point that it hurts the fucking relationship and God forbid it's as if a guy you keep bringing your mom to the fucking relationship with your wife. That's dead. That's a fucking rap. It's a fucking rap. But once again, guys

Speaker 3:          00:59:22       put up with that shit. We put up with that shit. We put up with them coming in and busting up our shit. Dude, you hold all of the fucking cards here. That's it. They don't have, they don't have, they don't have a dime. They, they're not even in the fucking game. You hold all the fucking cards. Do not do this. You don't have to do this. Just stay calm and keep reassuring your, your soon to be ex wife that you know you're doing what's best for the kids and what's best for you and what's best for the both of you guys and just keep saying, ah, this pressure that's your mother in law is putting on us is unnecessarily unnecessary. It's, it's, it's just we're good. Okay. I'm still like, if I was going to be vindictive, it would've happened by now. I'm still picking both of them up.

Speaker 3:          01:00:10       All right. There's no way I'm going to let anything happen to your son and there's no way I'm letting anything happened to our daughter. That's it. That's it. So tell your fucking mother to shut the fuck. I can't do that part. Don't do that part. All right, Harry girlfriend. No, Jesus. Here we go. Harry girlfriend. Dear red herring on a 25 year old guy of moderately good looks in mid level intelligence. Uh, this is both the, if that means you're actually a smart guy, people walk around thinking this smarter fucking dopes. Uh, this is both helped and hurt my game. I've had girlfriend, nobody who's like mildly intelligent, like thinks that that takes like a level of intelligence to understand that there's a lot of people way smarter than you. You know, people would just get like that fucking medium brain. Like they walk around, they think that the shit, you know what I mean?

Speaker 3:          01:01:04       They walk around, they make bold fucking statements and people list too, right? Like Donald Trump, that guy's, he's got a mid level brain. He's too stupid to realize what a fucking dope he is. And then people just listen to him. He's still, you become the Pied Piper of fucking morons. And next thing you know, you're there. Uh Oh God, what a fucking decision. That fucking idiot or that Goddam lunatic. Anyways, here we go. Ah, this is how, um, mid level intelligent, I've had girlfriends in the past, but most were just objects of lust instead of true connections. I met a new girl through a dating APP. Not Proud of that. Why? I wish that thing existed back in the day. It's like the fucking draft. All of a sudden you're fucking Bill Bella checking your Dick there. Uh, and things are great. She's beautiful, smart, and actually gets my sense of humor. That's why dating apps are great. You can cut through a lot of bullshit as far as I've heard or meet a serial killer. After a while of casual dating, we started to become more serious. She is a Brazilian descent and has some body here. Nothing crazy. Just arms and lower back type shit. Here's my question. Is there a subtle way I can tell her to lose the for or should I just stop being a cunt and be happy? Thanks. And Go fuck yourself. Um,

Speaker 3:          01:02:23       all right. How do you do this? Best case scenario is you're a little furry too. And then would you do is say, Hey, I'm going to go fucking get some of the fucking let her know hair taken off my back. You want to do a two for one? That's not gonna work. Don't say that. Um, oh Jesus Christ. She has someone on her lower back and where else? Oh, on her arm. So she just her arms.

Speaker 4:          01:02:57       Uh,

Speaker 3:          01:02:59       you know what I'm going to fucking to act like on. Who wants to be a millionaire? I'm going to fucking phone up. Not even phone a friend. I'm going to fucking Google this. How to tell your girlfriend she is too hairy. How to get out of a hairy situation. Five ways to get a girl to shave downtown. Oh Gosh. Can I say the worst? I, you know, I actually thought you know what that was on the Bro. bible.com. Hey Bro, how'd he tell a girl she has a bit of facial hair? My girlfriend has a lot of hair on her ass. How do I approach this? Okay, here we go. This is on reddit.

Speaker 4:          01:03:49       Uh,

Speaker 3:          01:03:53       you don't read. It's not going to have the fucking answer. I'm going to go with this one. The student room. How do I tell my girlfriend she's too Harry l this is another fucking shit, Ron. I'm dating a girl. Okay. We know what the deal is. How dare you dislike something that comes naturally. Oh God. These fucking broads. I swear to God. Hashtag yes all women stop and posing your fucking patriarchal standards on this poor girl. If you have nothing good to say, don't say anything at all. It's her body. Uh, gimme a fuck. And it what women do the second getting a fucking relationship with them. They're constantly trying to change you. If you don't like it, don't be with her. Don't make her feel insecure. If Jesus is all a Harry chicks, a chime in in, how would you like if she told you to shave your sweaty, hairy balls? I would say absolutely sweetheart. Why would I want to have hairy sweaty balls in your face if it's turned you off? The game plan here is to get in the mood. By all means. What do you want me to do? A, you could maybe remove your own Man Lady Garden that would create natural opportunity to discuss your lady friends, luxury and growth. That was kind of my suggestion.

Speaker 2:          01:05:05       Okay.

Speaker 4:          01:05:06       Uh,

Speaker 3:          01:05:06       just tell her seriously, why do you let people create stupid threats? Ah, Jesus. Uh, yeah, I don't, I don't, yeah, this is a hard one. Yeah, that's a really fucking difficult one. Cause you're talking about something, it's just weird thing that they can help, but they can also fix very easily. Although, yeah, it's Kinda hurts too. Right? According to the 40 year old virgin.

Speaker 2:          01:05:36       MMM.

Speaker 3:          01:05:38       Why don't you learn how to do it? Did she sleep on her stomach? Right. And then just when she's asleep, he just put it on her and then you just go home and then you as she sits up to scream, you just fake asleep. He goes, what the fuck was that man? I Dunno. I think you had a bad dream. And she's like, my back's killing me. Oh, well you sleeping on your front. Maybe you were putting pressure on your spine then, you know, I don't know.

Speaker 3:          01:06:31       They, you know what it is about women, they can sit down, they could sit down and just tell you. And as a guy, he just have to take it. You just have to fucking tell you this. It's constantly, I think that does that why we died before them. It's just, it's just a one way fucking street. Ah, dude. I don't know how to, I don't, I don't know what to tell you, man. That's a tough one. Listen, I love you. I'm crazy about, yeah, I think you're really attractive.

It's like, can you do the Brazilian wax to your fucking back?

Speaker 3:          01:07:21       Why don't you get her to get her, get her a tramp stamp. Right. So we'll have to shave it anyways and then you'll be like, ah, you know, you gotta keep it shaved this so people can always see it to that to get her an anchor tattoo on both forearms, like, or drag couple of dragons like bond Scott, I don't know what to tell you to do that. And I'll tell you, that's a rough one, you know? Um, I'll try to remember that one for Thursday when Nissan. All right. Hey Bill, is there any type of Gig you wouldn't do? Would you pref? Yeah, of course there was. Would you perform for the queen of England and all our stiff cohorts? Now, how about a room full of priests, a priest at the Vatican? Absolutely not. Not all this shit I've said about them. And then I'm in their country. That's a sovereign state Vatican City. Bonus question. What is the exact dollar amount it would take you to do a cruise ship? Well, I already, I did one a long time ago. No, I, there's no dollar amount. I, uh,

Speaker 1:          01:08:16       I don't have a lot of, uh,

Speaker 2:          01:08:18       okay.

Speaker 1:          01:08:19       And that really into stuff. I'm into no debt. So I've kept my, I've lived within my means and I have enough t shirts and shit and I can eat. And uh, you know, so no, I, I can make enough money on land. I don't need to do that. Um, there is no amount.

Speaker 1:          01:08:40       There really isn't. Uh, as of today, July 11th, 2016, what? The 10th one I'm doing it. Who knows? In the future, I dunno when I'm like 60, I imagine. Then you could talk me on a boat if you gave me, like bill will get, you could do one more fucking Gig. We're going to give you a fucking, you know, something's zillion dollars to do this gig and then you got to walk away from stand up. I might be so fucking tired at that point that I do it, but as of right now, 48 years old, a, there's no dollar amount that can get me on a fucking cruise ship.

Speaker 2:          01:09:12       MMM.

Speaker 1:          01:09:15       You know, what could a a benefit if there was some sort of benefit or some shit and it actually seemed legit. I'm a sucker for a fucking benefit, but like, you know, I don't care. I don't need to go on a fucking boat. I don't want to go on a boat and just be on this fucking thing with the crowd the entire time. And uh, you know, if you're happy and you know it, clap your hands. I bet on it. They fucking brutal. I worked with guy doing that and there was a juggler and a, you couldn't fucking say anything. You just had to sit there and act like the cruise was the greatest fucking thing you ever had been a part of. It just went against everything about being a comedian, you know, we're contrarians. Um, all right, so that's the podcast. Uh, people, if you want to write in and in, anybody have a hairy girlfriend out there and you had to say something or, or, or even better women have you there had to be something. Yeah, Guy, maybe he had a giant fucking something on the side of his fucking, I don't know what his head or some shit, you know?

Speaker 2:          01:10:13       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:10:13       It was wardee moly or some shit. You had to say something had halitosis.

Speaker 2:          01:10:23       I Dunno.

Speaker 1:          01:10:24       I think if a woman had a smelly vagina, I think it'd be easier to tell her that. Then she had a hairy back.

Speaker 2:          01:10:31       Uh,

Speaker 1:          01:10:34       how do you, how do you do, how did you just listen? You know, I think you're beautiful. You know, I think you're gorgeous and you know, you turn me on and everything, but I, I just, you know what's so funny? It's just how guys, you know, just our shit is not validated. You know, like if a woman didn't, you know, was turned off by something God for fucking bit. I mean, if you still climbed on top of her with your hairy back, I mean, I think you'd be charged with some sort of like, you know, I dunno, pubic raper bad pube break or some shit cops would show up and putting in some sort of choke hold and drag it out of the fucking house. And God knows if you ever see anybody again. Um, yeah. You know what, you me, I got to think about

Speaker 3:          01:11:14       that one. Um, all right, well, that's a podcast. The Monday morning podcasts. Go fuck yourselves. Enjoy your next couple of days. I'll check in on you on Thursday and maybe I'll have Nia helped me answer that question. All right. Uh, let's it go. Fuck yourself.
