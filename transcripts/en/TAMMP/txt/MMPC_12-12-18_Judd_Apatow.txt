Speaker 1:          00:00          All right. Hey, what's going on is bill burr and it's time for a special episode of the Monday morning podcast. It's not on Monday. It's not on Thursday. It's coming out, I guess what? Tuesday, Wednesday. We're going to put this out as soon as we can. I have a special guest here. You know, I don't do a lot of guests, so if I bring somebody in, they gotta be a heavy hitter. That's right. They got to be a mover, a shaker, a shot caller. We have the one and only John Apatow here. Pleasure to be here. How are you buddy? I like to be, or usually you're all by yourself just talking to the wall. Yes I am. And usually you're in the midst of producing was fascinates me. I tried to, uh, talk to you about this because a, I like to think I'm kind of a busy man too. How you manage to have movies, TV shows, standup special masterclass, a documentary on Garry Shandling, how they'll fuck management. Keep all like how big is the bolt and the, the war room?

Speaker 2:          00:57          It's all management technique. That's what you want to know. I'll tell you a good management technique. The staff of crashing is the room right now writing the fourth season. Third season comes out in January, but they're writing the fourth season and I'm here with you.

Speaker 1:          01:11          Yes, that's managed well. So how do you check in with that? How do I check it every day? Did they send you a draft and you just kind of keep it in bounds of where it needs to be or at season four? Is it sort of up and running?

Speaker 2:          01:24          Well, usually what it is is Pete and I, uh, and also the Judah, Mila and Oren who work on the show. We'll kick around a little bit what we think the season might be, right? We bring in writers for a month and we just kick it around very openly, like anything is on the table and I'll pop in and out of those meetings and, and then there's notes that I'll read the notes and then sit in for half a day and then take a day off and then pop back in. And usually that gives me some perspective. Because you've been in those rooms. There's a lot of Chinese food, there's a lot of danishes. He get tired. Lunch is huge. There's a lot of people talking about things that have nothing to do with the show for very long periods of time. Uh, and then at some point I'll sit with Pete and he will go through everything right and go, okay, which ideas do we like?

Speaker 1:          02:12          You know what my favorite thing is? Is the mental break. You taking the writer's room, it's like you're pitching, you're pitching, you're pitching, then you're fried. And like I always look around the room and I'll just see someone hasn't pitched him in it and that just sort of staring down at the ground for about 15, 20 minutes. And then they just come back and be like, yeah, all right. What if frank did that? If I can get, but you literally, you have to do it. And um, what I learned on f is for family though, is I didn't realize how fried you get yes. In the writer's room. And like my drinking went off the rails a little bit. It was was one little scotch and then it just became like three. So last season. At what time is

Speaker 2:          02:44          day though? Are you having your Scotch in the room?

Speaker 1:          02:47          Oh, not in the room. That was when I got home. When I got home I would literally just, you know, put on the fireplace, turn it on now cause you don't light a fire anymore, you just turn it on and then I would just sit there like uh, yeah. And it was getting to that shit. It was just like I need this at the end of the day. So in season three like I did this thing, I'll go, not only may not drink in this season, I'm actually gonna try to do the impossible, which is drop weight and just, which I did, how I packed a lunch. Like I was a second grader. So every day that they would be going out now I had like this keenwah being thing that I would always have. And then yeah, just fruit and nuts, you know, it would be my, my snacks or whatever.

Speaker 1:          03:27          Cause this whole reward, you want to reward yourself. You know, you get to work whatever, nine, 10 o'clock and all you think, oh morning is that they get 1230. The food's gonna lay hand. Oh yeah, the food's going to land. Then we could stop talking about this showing if this food and if everybody voted a place that you fucking hate. It's just like that is the longest day ever. But if you're going to like, you know, it's like a Friday and they picked an awesome like lunch place like d that can literally, you pitch better. But I liked that you are not in charge of that because the only area I will throw my weight around right is if they say, hey, we're going to eat here today. I'm very comfortable going, we are not going there today. Daddy needs this right now. There's definitely a, there's a, uh, there's also, there's a generation gap and that also goes with nutrition.

Speaker 1:          04:13          You know, so there's people like my show takes place in the 70s. So that's those people that grew up in the 70s and the other people who were born in the 80s. So there they're more likely to go to something a little more healthy than the old sort of John Wayne people in the room. I'm like, I'm not eating that shit. And some days there's a little bit of a mutiny, but it's not about, uh, the writers from here. I actually, they sent me, which was really cool. Thank you. You guys send me a link to the first episode of season three of crashing with the Great Pete Holmes. And, uh, just once again, it's like, like watching that show, it's like, I've, I've lived this, I've, I've, I don't want to give away what the episode is about, but I mean, and generally speaking, it's like Pete has now gotten to the point where he actually has his own place, which is awesome.

Speaker 1:          04:56          And he's mentoring a young man. Yes. Yabuki from, uh, a daily, it was on the daily show. Oh, okay. Yeah. Who's great and it's he, he finally feels cocky enough to give someone else advice. Yeah. Oh yeah. You have to sit and talk. Like he's in the mix. He's kind of feeling himself a little bit and as always, this business will humble you. So he ends up getting humbled in. It's like, uh, just the way the, the, uh, how you, when he gets humbled, I don't want to say it is the way it's written that uh, he then lashes out at this person that he kind of smoothed stuff over with. And that's just like the worst, especially with the woman. Then you get that whole, you are enjoying this, aren't you? You're enjoying that. I mean, I literally had that fight with my wife like two days ago. What was she enjoying then? I lost my temper. Yeah. And then she, you know, and then she gets, you know, like, you know how the deal is with women. Nothing is off bounds, but like you with you, you have to stay within the lines are, I'll, she'll never hear the end of it. So you know, she, you know, you know, she was driving the car all over the place, all over my life. Let

Speaker 2:          05:58          me know who I was. But you know, she was right about a lot of it. And, uh, that's a worst part is that they are right about a lot of it. No, but they're all so wrong. So I did this, this whole period now where women, like they went from nobody listening to them to now everything that they say is spun with gold is, it's, it's, it's, it's getting ridiculous. I was like, we have to be okay, let's, let's, you know, women are like, guys, a lot of them are just full of Shit, you know, as our men. So I mean that's the art of life is trying to figure out who actually has the information that you need, which is why when I talked to you, how to, you know, manage a shell, you have the goods with everything you've got going on here.

Speaker 2:          06:33          Um, well sometimes you know, the thing about it is that you do need someone who has the perspective to judge ideas and how things are going. So there's a process of generating maybe a thousand ideas for a show, but if you're burnt out from being part of that generation, it's hard for you to pick what works. Yeah. And so like at girls I, I was very involved in the writing, but I wouldn't go to the set because it was so well directed. There was no reason for me to be there. The footage always was great. And Lena and January graded monitoring the directors and directing themselves. At what point did you have confidence to be like, all right, this thing is cruising? Well, I don't think I ever felt like it was it w it was cruising, but I had confidence in if the script was good, they would shoot it great.

Speaker 2:          07:20          And then I can put all my energy into just reading the scripts to give them a, a person who could tell them if the script's worked, you know, so they were tired from shooting and writing and they're exhausted and I, I'm able to have a little more energy to just read and go on to page four. It's weird. Why did they say that? It's not tracking and it's, that's hard to do when you're in the thick of it and you're exhausted. And so there is a value to, you know, picking where you're helpful and where you're like, you don't need me here. I don't have to sit and look at over the director's shoulder. You're nailing it. Let me save that energy for the writing part. I hate to admit this, but actually enjoy being in the writer's room. Oh yeah. I was like kicking and scream and thinking about God, I'm a comedian.

Speaker 2:          08:03          I'm free. Why the fuck am I going to go back into the math class? So whatever I should say it. It's on days where it's working, when it's working and it's cruising and we're getting good notes, you know, uh, we always get good notes, but I mean, positive notes from Netflix, like we enjoy this, but then on the days where like, this doesn't really, there's too much of that. And then we go, all right, and then we try to fix it and then it's just not working. Those are the days where I feel like I'm back in high school and I'm just like, it's like, it's the clock broken. Like what, what, what are we doing here? So you're the teacher. That's the thing, you know, when you work on the show and you're not the teacher, like at the Larry Sanders show, if we did a table read and it wasn't working, then suddenly there is someone upset with you, right? And you are ashamed child that at the script and look up and you're, then you're like, how can I fix it? And, and there's almost a daddy or mommy character that you're disappointing if the show isn't working or if the isn't working. There's a lot of ways for it to be super unhealthy, but it is more fun. You're right when you're that person and you can treat people well and you have your own strong point of view, it's not as painful.

Speaker 1:          09:06          Well, I would say in my room it, Mike prices, he's the captain of the ship. So I'm the guy that's sorta chimes in and tries to like, I dunno, uh, keep it like certain things tethered to reality if it, if it starts getting a little too like absurd. But you know, you brought up Gary Shandling who like, you know, anybody who was even remotely in the comedy just, and I mean that guy is like on the Mount Rushmore there. And uh, I just remember, you know, I watched, you know, you know, this is the theme, the gallery show. I watched this first one, I watched everything. I used to watch this tonight show sets. I just always just thought the guy, he just always, it was funny when even like when I was in junior high, I was like in seventh grade I knew that his stuff was just funnier that it was, this is like a different level.

Speaker 1:          09:48          Like this guy is better than all of these other guys. And I was wondering what, like what was that like, you know, cause I, I really, I sent an email about that. Like I thought the Garry Shandling documentary that you did with that, that's my favorite thing you've done. And I have thank you, 40 year old virgin and all this stuff. But um, what was that like because you were friends with somebody like that? Um, you know, myself, I've lost a couple of friends and I know that certain things, it just gets like really emotional. What was the key, but I never delved into their life. To the level that, that you did with, with Gary, who was like a friend and a mentor to you. Like what was that process like? Like how long did it take you to, to, to, you know, cause that was on par with like, did you see that eagles documentary? I love that. It was like three hours long and it fell. He was 20 minutes. I got through like a cross country flight watching that. I felt like the Gary Shandling duck was like that. What was that like?

Speaker 2:          10:40          It was like the Eagles Doc. If, if Gary, uh, wasn't on coke. Yeah. Well you know, it's funny cause now that it's over and I've been, uh, you know, I finished at six or eight months ago, something like that. Looking back, it's almost like a fever dream that I even did it right because he died. I was really depressed and it threw me more than I thought because he was a constant presence of support and I didn't realize what an important beam he was in everything. And, and uh, and I thought, I think there's just a lesson that he wants to teach everybody. And I'll tell you a story that it kind of launched the documentary is that I went to Gary's cremation. And so Gary's cremation was very, I mean, people don't go to cremations. You're not supposed to go to cremation. When you saw him, like sliding the body in, well, kind of the CSUS Jud basically, basically, uh, how did you get tickets to that?

Speaker 2:          11:46          I mean, I only, I only tell this story because I think it's, it, it's helpful to people in their own lives is that, uh, you know, a friend put together a very small service. So if you can imagine there's only like eight people there and you know, oven basically and, and like for a Buddhist monks, right? So it takes the edge off a little bit. Like here, they're not freaking out yet. They would, they were fine with it. That's their whole religion. So we go to this place and it's in the valley and it's not that far from these offices and it's, you know, a crematorium. Is it part of a strip mall is like ramen noodles, getting a tax done, watching your friend get burned. Even worse, deeper in the valley where it's just next to a place that like, you know, makes glass bowls or something in an industrial area.

Speaker 2:          12:40          So we go there, it's clear no one's ever had a service in this space. This isn't what people do, right? So there's no like room to do it. We're literally in like the lobby of a place that looks like a sham business of some someplace. Right? And like what they're selling in the lobby, there's literally just like one desk and empty space. And did you make sure it was Gary underneath fucking we should a crash test dummy. That'll be 50 grand. Like what they were selling there. They had these little, these little pamphlets where you could take some of the ashes of your beloved and have them put into like a little glass figurine you could put on your table or like something you would wear itself, gone, gone. So we go, we go to this, this place, and, uh, we go into this little room and again, it's like a, couldn't be ratty are really, and they have, uh, a service, uh, which is very sweet and it's beautiful. [inaudible]

Speaker 2:          13:44          and moving and all of the ideas of, of Buddhism and the, and, uh, and then they take us in this room. Now the room with the crematorium, it's like the kitchen to a restaurant. It's just like a big room with a cement floor and like four or five. So they did a little service. They hit some little fucking gongs or something. Like what happened? Yeah, they did Buddhist prayers and they talked about Carrie's life and, uh, and, and what life is about, you know, you, you live, you die, you, you learn the lessons that you can, you try to be as loving and kindness. You can hopefully you, uh, you know, you grew and it was very sweet tea. That actually sounds cool. Now, did they believe in a heaven and hell? Buddhists people, here's what my issue, Buddhism is. As you get deeper and deeper into it, it heads to reincarnation.

Speaker 2:          14:36          I, I believe and I always get lost when things get too magical. I like something that's clear, like life is about being kind. And that's it. Like that's, that's as far as I usually can get. I use this script writer and you needed to land magical in any way. As soon as someone's reborn and goes to heaven or, hell, I'm, I've lost, I have trouble now. I'm not 100% closed, but I'm pretty close. Uh, but I do, I can get interested in ideas that are about how can we let go of our egos and be kind. That's all I need. Okay. So we have the service and it's, and it's, they bring into the other room moving and then we go in the other room and it's literally a table with a cardboard coffin. And then they say some more prayers. And then at some point they open up an oven, which looks like almost like a dishwasher in a restaurant.

Speaker 2:          15:34          And they roll it into flames already going or do they turn it on after they closed the door? There's a pilot light and uh, and then what did they stick? It's literally not that far from a pizza oven. Okay. And you know, they put, uh, the cardboard coffin, then they close, close it almost like if a dishwasher in a restaurant and then they ask who wants to push the button? Oh Jesus. And you know, they're saying that they have a bunch of fake buttons, like a firing squad. Like somebody gets to like young guy really blows his brains out. He had no one wants to know who, who pushed the button. You don't want to carry that. And then a friend of Gary's, you know, push the button and then suddenly you're here at fire up, you know, it's getting hotter than your normal pizza oven and the room gets hot.

Speaker 2:          16:28          And then it's like you smell something burning. Like it's like, you know, if there was like a fire at your neighbor's house and suddenly you like your chest hurts a little bit, then you realize it's Gary, they, it, there's no vent, I guess. I guess it maybe it was a place that needed more ventilation. No, I mean there is a vent. It's not like overpowering, like the room is all filled with smoke, but you know, do you realize like someday if you go on a fast to get rid of toxins in your body, part of that is Garry Shandling. Exactly. And that would sadden me. But, but that's what was crazy about it. So now I love Gary so much. I will never go on a fast and I breathed it. Wow. And so, so I'm, you know, watching this, crying my eyes out, just balling.

Speaker 2:          17:15          It's as intense as anything I've ever experienced. This is pretty heavy and I'm feeling it in my chest and I'm aware like that's Gary, we're breathing in Gary. And at first it, you know, pardon me, it made me laugh like, yeah, cause this is super creepy dude. You know, it's, it's creepy. It's kind of weirdly, uh, like the Gary always would make the joke like I'm inside you, you know, like there's like a sexual joke to be made there. And then I just thought God carry would find this so funny. All of us sitting here crying, watching them cremate his, he would think that this was fantastic like me here bawling my eyes out. Gary would look and just go like, that's right. That's what it is. That's what it is. And, and I thought in that moment, this is a lesson like having to look at that will change your life.

Speaker 2:          18:07          Having to be at the crematorium about, you know, what's important, what do we care about? How do we treat people? What do you want to do with your life? And I thought, Gary wanted me here. He wanted me to go through this hell in this freaking, you know, always this part of his like, no, he didn't ask for it, but I decided in like a spiritual level. I thought, this is it. Gary wants me to learn every freaking lesson to the point of his incineration. He wants me to look at in the eye and take from it whatever I can take to be a better person. And I think in that moment was the seed of how do I tell other people this lesson? Because I think in Gary's life he was trying to figure out how to talk about this stuff. And you know, it's very hard in comedy to do it without seeming really corny or weird.

Speaker 2:          18:54          You know, as soon as people start talking about their spirituality in a sincere way, we're all like, shut the fuck up. And it feels, you gotta be interviewed by Oprah and she has to bring it out of you and act like, well, she asked me exactly the only way to, that's the only cool way to do it. I mean, I had so many friends that tried to, and they always seemed odd. And I think Gary, when he did comedians in cars getting coffee, it was the first time he found a way to be really funny, but talk about some things that he believed in. And I think that was his goal near the end of his life. He was trying to figure out how to reinvent how he did stand up and get some of these ideas in and he hadn't quite cracked it. He was really into silence.

Speaker 2:          19:29          He loved not getting a laugh. He loved putting people through weird silences. And he would say to the crowd that that's where it all is. It's all in that silence. Right. And he didn't have a joke. He didn't even know what to do with it. He just knew in the room went dead contemplating is what they're doing. They're contemplating with what was just said. And so what I was working at his memorial service, I cut together four or five little mini docs about Gary and when I was making them I thought, oh yeah, there's a whole movie about Carrie about what he believed in and, and that's how it started. Well, it's incredible. And it just came out on Blu ray people out there and still have the blue ray players. You know, I still have a, I have a DVD VCR player, but my TV's too advanced and I can't hook it up to that self.

Speaker 2:          20:18          Anybody knows that there's some sort of adapter or some darn thing I can do to try and make that work. I would appreciate it. But it's a lot of shit cause you know, I, I, you know, finally became a parent. So I had to get my affairs in order. You know, it's a guy, you got to make sure everybody's going to be okay. You got the will, got to the point like I gave, I hooked my wife up so much like she has motive. Like if I die suddenly, um, I've had the conversation with my wife and the insurance agent. Have you done this conversation yet? Will you sit with an insurance agent about life insurance? Well, Judd lives to this age. You get this. If he, if he lives at this age, you get that and it's gambling. You're gambling on me. Die In paying against yourself. Like, ah,

Speaker 1:          21:00          died before you thought I was going to. Now you've got to give them all this money. But my wife wouldn't

Speaker 2:          21:04          by the extra insurance. Cause she said, I feel really weird, uh, you know, having any, you know, handicapping your death. And she was deeply upset at the conversation. That was like six or seven years ago and just the other day she's like, maybe we should get that insurance. Yeah, that's what happened.

Speaker 1:          21:25          That's after a while you and I want you to have kids and stuff. But like I, uh, you know, I went with the cremation thing. I think it's so stupid to stick yourself in the box and then there's like, you're that important that there's got to be like a headset I guess is for the living people have someplace to go. But I think now just with the world population, I mean the graveyards at some point, I mean they, I don't know if they're going to dig deeper if you're going to be underneath somebody else, but uh, I've had a lot of people go, well what did you still feel stuff? And it's just like, well then let's get it over with. Which friend of yours thinks she's still feel stuff. A lot of people are afraid of death. It's just the stuff that, you know, something I don't even know.

Speaker 1:          22:01          Cause I, I, my short term memory is bad, but a lot of people say that about the, about like, you know, if you get cremated, what if you still feel stuff? It's like, well, I'd rather just get it over with in a minute. I guess I die again somehow in that minute. But, uh, rather than laying there waiting for the worms to slowly work their fucking way in, burn it and toss it out of an airplane, I want to go, I want to, I wish I don't just probably isn't legal in this country, but I want to do it like the Viking way. Like, make a little ship. Sure. Send me out there. It gives people shoot some flaming arrows, you know, giving him, make it a little contest. It's like a burn it on the Ganges. Yeah, it's like a clay pigeon type of thing. But, um, anyways, uh, what else we got? We got a benefit coming up too that you're doing a, at the Grammercy for the Ronald McDonald House is one of the great charities out. They can go to Judd apatow.com/tour. That's January 15th. Uh, Graham is a Gramercy theater.

Speaker 2:          22:57          Yeah. In the, in New York and it's a Pete and John Malaney, Pete Holmes, Regina Spektor and some cast members from, uh, from crashing like Buki and Jamie Lee and me. And uh, yeah, it's where the Ronald Mcdonald's house, which is an monster lineup. John. Yeah. I'm

Speaker 1:          23:14          Laney, man. That guy's just, he's just a in New York, England, genius guy. Um, so, uh, all right. What else? What else do we, can we, uh, can we discuss it? We've, we've, we promoted, we've promoted your masterclass. I have a master and the presence of them. How do you get, I do like get the, somebody approached you with like, uh, with something like that. Like you want to just like, I could teach a master class on how not to read out loud, how to fuck things up, uh, how

Speaker 2:          23:45          to make your wife mad at you for three days in a row. Sure. I have that mastered. What was your, what was your masterclass? Well, I, I did it because my friend Jay Roach who directed Austin Powers, he directed my masterclass. So it's basically several days of talking to Jay Roach who's asking me questions. There's no crowd or anything like that. And not like a Ted talk or anything. No, it's just an, they just edit it, edit it up. And uh, and I think it came out really well. You know, the thing you probably know because you've worked with a lot of people and staff is so much of it is just inspiring people to work hard. People are so damn lazy, like people just don't put in the effort at all.

Speaker 1:          24:20          I told him, I told someone that the other day, I was like, look, you got to have a certain level of talent. But what separates people is just like, I mean the people who have like that work ethic and it's almost got to be like, and people in this business, I kind of workaholics, um, and like I've learned that with F is for family. So many people ain't want to go through it again. I was like, Oh yeah, yeah. I'm like, these people are fucking insane. Like they don't want to go home. Um, but the people that I saw like just really, really, really work. I don't want to name any names because then if I don't name names, people saying what he's saying, I'm fucking lazy. But I just, I saw a lot of people that weren't the guy. Yeah. But work their way, like into being the guy.

Speaker 1:          24:58          But like, you know, with you, it's got to feel good when somebody comes to you and asked you to teach your master class. I mean, you certainly have the body of work and all this stuff that you've done it because I, that's I think the last three times I've, I've talked to you, that is what I've asked you. How do you and my delegation of that Shit, because I still want to be a comedian and still, you know, and the only way to go still being good is you have to be out there doing it. But if, if, how do I, you know, but I also love doing the show and then also got to be a dad. Like how do, how, how the fuck do you balance all of it? So it's some of that in, in there, right?

Speaker 2:          25:31          Yeah, absolutely. And I think that like a lot of it is uh, that you're just pushing, pushing balls forward. So you may be on the road doing standup and you have a great idea for a movie and it's just making sure in some consistent way you're pushing it forward and making progress. Now you might finish it in three months, you might finish it in three years, but if you have four or five things going at the same time, that's really what it is, is, you know, I might get up in the morning and go from the moment I get up to lunch, I'm going to work with Pete and in the afternoon and I'm doing a movie p Davidson, I'm an old, I'm going to rewrite p Davidson. And then did you get to get burned out? Do you get frustrated? The Illusia Temby seem like a chill guy.

Speaker 2:          26:11          It's just like a, is this how you are? Or like you behind the scenes, you one of those guys throwing laptops like it doesn't work. We're going to stay here all night where I only get crazy on two issues. What, like two or three issues. One is if the food order is wrong, I just, I, I can't handle it. Like if they don't bring the salsa with the Burrito, like I so reward myself with the food that could go viral, that could go bad. You're, you're, uh, you're, you're flipping out and that's okay. That's, that's, that's understandable. My biggest of shame where I go, you really lost it are mainly around food. But the areas where I get crazy one is I used to, people would tell me I couldn't have my casting and that would always drive me crazy if I said, you know who the star of the show you be? It should be Jason Segel. And then Fox would go, no, that's where my head would explode.

Speaker 1:          27:04          And where would you explode on the phone to them? In your car to your windshield?

Speaker 2:          27:09          Every, every scenario. I mean, I, I'd be, I'd be screaming, I'd be in tears. I would be threatening. I'd have agents calling and I never won. As a result, it took me years to realize, oh, all my emotional reactions have never won me the fight. And then when I stopped behaving that way, I started winning more of those debates. But I would get so upset because to me the worst thing in the world is if you have an edit of a movie and someone forces you to change it and you've ruined your own movie due to someone. Is that happened? Well I, that's the one here. I just can't allow to happen now. I have had things change in the past that I look back at more. So, you know, a couple of decades ago where I did give in and now even right now, if I thought about that movie, I'd be like, Oh why did we cut that scene? They told us to cut that scene and there was a scene in

Speaker 1:          28:04          you failed three cause you were young and it just trying to get your foot in the door. Everybody always says that thing, you know, you just gotta let him get him, get you the first time, and then the next time you'll be able to write your own ticket. Now do you subscribe to that?

Speaker 2:          28:16          Well, I think it's true. Only in the sense that you can't win. You just don't have the power. Right. So we made this movie heavyweights and Paul Feig was in it and still are played the bad guy who was a summer camp for fat kids and it was, it was a Disney movie. And then when we finished it and see real directed it and wrote it with me, uh, it was just a little darker than any Disney movie you've ever seen. And it ended with was that was funny. It was funny. And not in the way that a lot of those movies are. Yeah. I'd still here at the end of the movie, he's lost his mind. He's the owner of this fat camp and he's like this like demented Tony Robbins guy and he's got a bow and Arrow and he's like threatening to kill all the children. Right. And Disney said, you know, you really can't have him like point pointing, bow and arrows from Chile and children were like three feet away. Right. And so we had to Riyadh at the sequence. That's the kind of stuff, I'll wake up at two in the morning and go, why did we cut out the god damn bow and Arrow sequence still eats at you it. Oh yeah. And I might have five of those. And so that's where I can

Speaker 1:          29:16          what point in your career where you're like, all right, all right Chad. Screaming at people flipping out during these moments isn't working. Yeah. Like how did you, cause I am like, my big Achilles' heel is, is uh, it's not, but it's funny. It's not at work. I don't flip out. Yeah. In comedy clubs, I don't, I've never flipped out at, uh, F as a family. I've raised, my voice of [inaudible] is crying. Wait, how do we fuck about, but I never like got to the point of light, you know, never had a big, you know, storm out fucking throwing shit. Never had one of those. But like it's more like at, at, at home. Yeah. I, I, uh, I, you know, I just, I flip out about just stupid shit. Like I fucking suck at these iPhones and laptops I get so I'm so frustrated because I don't like them. Technology doesn't fascinate me. It's not something I'm interested in. It's really, it's ruined the world. So, you know, anyways, it has it now. The other ways it hasn't met with medic medically is it's nice

Speaker 2:          30:14          when your kids are older and they don't look up at you for hours. You'll, you'll go, they ruin the world.

Speaker 1:          30:20          Yes. I, yeah, that aspect of it. But I definitely like, uh, I just don't like how yesterday I knew how to use this device and then now I don't, now I have to go through this fucking bullshit. It's just every time, you know, you move three feet ahead, they knock you back with the new updated system and then you can't, you can't opt out of not updating. It cause you to be able to keep your phone for years and there's just like, no, we're going to fill up this fucking phone until you have to bring it in and then we're going to take everything off it and sell it to some kid in the Philippines and you just feel like you're just part of this thing. And like that's the type of shit, like I'm trying to, uh, you know, and I'm failing miserably at it.

Speaker 2:          30:56          But explaining the flip out, is it a loans, the throwing it against the wall. Are you yelling at another person? Like what does it turn into?

Speaker 1:          31:05          I just literally like, my wife will be just totally chilling, watching TV and then I of where I'll just be like, you gotta be fucking kidding me. You fucking piece of shit. I flip out like that and like what? I don't know, cause I grew up with that. I didn't understand what it was doing to her as far as just really just having her be on edge. And uh, yeah. So I mean,

Speaker 2:          31:24          how does she tell you not to do it? What's her approach to telling you to chill out?

Speaker 1:          31:28          Oh man, she's just straightforward. She's straightforward. She said, she said some shit, I'm not going to, you know, this is too intimate detail, but she said some shit to me like two days ago that I will never forget. And I was like, wow,

Speaker 2:          31:42          well good. When you have a kid it changes everything because she knows you're about to do it in front of a child that understands it. So when they're little, they're babies and you can go in the other room, but at some point you just spend so much time with your kid that they will absorb it and then you go to, I like the way I move in the world cause I think my kid's going to copy it.

Speaker 1:          32:01          Yeah. So fortunately I am really on my best behavior for the most part around my kid. She's seen me flip out a few times, but I quickly tried to turn it in and do a joke. But, uh, it's something, yeah, I got to go to therapy dude. Cause I, I, I don't wanna cause she's getting to the point now where she's repeating stuff and I just don't, I don't want to, this is the deal. She's not going to be like me. I already know she's not going to be like me, uh, as far in a, in a good way. So I mean that's, that's kind of what, what does that say about me? Like my job as a dad is to make my kid not like me. Well, the one thing I think your half of me, but I don't want you to be me at all. I want you to be like your mom. Well they don't really have the damage of

Speaker 2:          32:39          us, you know. So that's something I've noticed is, you know, my kids are hilarious, but they're neurotic kids too, but they didn't go through some of the intense things and I went through that really builds how my mind works. But I'm sure they have their own, their own menu. No, I bet there's a whole new level of shit with just like social media didn't exist. So like what I liked about my childhood was one school was over, the ass kicking was over, whatever thing, humiliation. I could go home. It was fine. It didn't continue. The Mike Douglas show was on, you'd watch it, you'd heal. Yes. Yes. There wasn't this think tank of kids trying to, you know, getting all online and pile on you and the shit that they deal with. So, and they know when they're being excluded. So the biggest issue is because of Instagram, you're aware of what you've been invited to.

Speaker 2:          33:33          So when people are hanging out, you're like, oh, they didn't want me at this thing when I was a kid, I was excluded by everybody. I had one or two really good friends. But basically if I thought about it, if I think about it now, I was excluded from every possible social thing that was happening when it passed at the club. But I, but I didn't know it, you know, I just would go home every day and just watching the Dinah shore show and be fine and wait for my friends to get back from football. But now the kids know like, oh, those three girls went to the mall. Oh, those two are hanging out at this concert. And they feel bad. No. And then they take a picture, which is not an accurate depiction of what it's like. It's like, it's like this selling the movie of their life or anything.

Speaker 2:          34:14          So that's the, uh, that's the thing I get nervous with and that's been a source of, uh, you know, back and forth. Me and my wife is like, I don't like her watching TV and all of this shit and I don't like her eating junk food. And uh, you know, and she has more of like, like she wants a little bit of TV. She occasionally has Mcdonald's and six, like say I ain't, but you know, I mean, this is the fights you have because yeah, you, when you're married you're instantly deciding how much do I care about each thing and what, how far do I want to push my wife? Like in knocked up one of the scenes that I like, but it's a, it's an intense scene is Leslie sitting there and she's looking at a website that tells her where sexual predators live in the neighborhood and Paul comes in and he just keeps making jokes about it and she's really freaked out.

Speaker 2:          35:03          Like, do you know there's a guy like three, three streets over and Paul keeps making jokes. Well let's not go to his house on Halloween. And then finally she's like, that's what I would though I, then she finally says like, sometimes I just want to rip your fucking head off because you're so fucking stupid. And that really is what marriage is about. Is there, there are issues that you care about. Like how much McDonald's should the kitty. Now, when I was a kid, I swear to God, I hadn't Mcdonald's, I'm not kidding you six times a week. And I loved it. I ate it. My mom had no issue taking me there every single

Speaker 1:          35:38          time. We used to go out as a family, like it was fine dining. He got there, we had a big family, so it was five cheeseburgers, five small fries, five chocolate shakes, two big MACs, two large fries to coax. That was the order for years. And it was awesome every time. Yeah. Yeah. It was, it was an ISP and jealous. And when I got older, because I kept getting a cheeseburger and I was big enough to get a quarter pounder with cheese, but I was afraid to ask as you get shit. And I just, we looking at theirs and they would only like halfway through it with that little mouse trying to eat it. And I said, wolf mind down. But uh, yeah, I remember when I used to, when I was really young and I lived in the north shore of Boston, I remember there was a Mcdonald's and there was this train track that was right by, and you would throw some of your French fries to the seagulls and you get to see a train go by and he'd be sitting outside.

Speaker 1:          36:24          And it was like some of my fondest memories as a kid and um, you know, yeah, there was no, yeah. You know that they will roughly the same age. So it was just all a, you know, peanut butter and fluff and all these, these, these, these, and um, and there's some of this out about it. When did you even realize what Mcdonald's was bad and what, like how old were you when you were like, I guess I shouldn't eat that? Well, you knew fast food was bad, but he didn't know to the point like I make Mcdonald's, remember a few years ago they had a bolt, a bulletin board, a billboard just came out and it's like now with a 100% beef, which is obviously, well, what the fuck was it before the page? Did you watch that movie founder with Michael Keaton? Oh, you got to watch that.

Speaker 1:          37:07          Michael Keaton's amazing in that movie. And it's such a, it's such a well done movie about like all of that type of stuff. So, um, but then, you know, your wife says, I want to give her the good and some Mcdonald's and you're like, and they get lengthy. Awful. Now I have the police and I have the reverse with my wife. Used to be poison. I think now it's more like, it's a little more healthy right now. It might be just nothing blank, no positive anything. But my, my wife early in our relationship when I would get Mcdonald's would look at me like, what is wrong with you? Are you an adult? Like you eat this food? She was so disgusted. She shamed me to such an extent that I don't even sneak out and get it. Like she, she programmed me to be disgusted by the thing that made me so happy.

Speaker 1:          37:52          Yeah. My thing was when I was going to be healthy, I went to Wendy's cause Wendy's seemed like it was actually burger meat. Yeah. Probably wasn't either. No, it probably wasn't. Well, dude, I gotta tell you, man, it was, it's such a thrill to have, uh, someone like you come on on the show in like, and I really appreciate the advice both on this and an off that you've given me as far as like, how do you know, you know, keep it all kind of going without, without screwing it up. And I'm definitely gonna check out that masterclass that you were in. Everybody check out January 15th that the Grammercy, um, I want you want to say hotel Grammer seat theater.
