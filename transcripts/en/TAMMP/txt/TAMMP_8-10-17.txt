God, the fucking New Jersey man. I swear to God, swear there was just, you know what they'll do? They'll never be able to vacuum and scrub the fucking hair metal out of this state. It's just what went on out in this God damn part of the world in the 80s. I swear to God, fucking played like the A, I had one of these great travel days and then it sucked. You know, I uh, found a cheap ticket, got an exit row. There was nobody in the middle seat. Right? The person on the aisle was courteous. We had a fucking tailwind. One point I was watching us, we go on 603 miles an hour. I'm like, what are we on? The fucking Kong could always, um, it was great. So then we land, you know, I'm no longer with budget rental car. Fuck those guys. I don't know what happened with them. I've been meaning to like leave them for six years. There was a, there was something happened over the last five, six years and I have lose meaning to walk out on a typical of me. And when I'm in a bad relationship, it takes a good half a decade for me to get out of it. So, um,

Speaker 1:          00:01:53       You know, with them where they were like, oh, you, you didn't close your account. And I had to get back on the phone and talk to those fucking assholes. It's like, just close the fucking thing so you have to be on the phone. I got it, dude. I don't have time for this. He said, sir, the more you talk, and I just hung up on him. I was just, I could lead to the fucking leave it open. I don't give a shit.

Speaker 2:          00:02:11       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:02:12       Why you acting like I still have the car.

Speaker 1:          00:02:16       Sorry. Um, when am I gonna like react to things in a mature way? I just don't, I, every time I take the fucking bag, I freak out. I got into it with the Sklar brothers. I did their fucking podcast. Right. And both of them, you know, talk in sports, both of them agreeing with each other. And then one was in the, it was like, it was just like, it was like arguing with, with one person and Stereo.

Speaker 2:          00:02:39       Okay. And one of them,

Speaker 1:          00:02:43       Randy adjacent, they never reintroduced themselves either. They'll like fucking identical twins. They're always changing their facial hair. I literally, I've called each one of them buddy for fucking 15 years. Hey Buddy, what's going on? I used to know Randy because Randy had the facial hair. So my, my thing in my head was like rugged Randy. He's got the facial hair. Then they started fucking switching off with the goatees and, and I, and the fucking, uh, Don Mattingly Baseball fucking, uh, mustaches. I don't know who's who anymore. Right.

Speaker 3:          00:03:14       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:03:14       So you know, we're having a nice podcast. Everything's going good, and we'd brings up Tom Brady and he has to bring up fucking deflate gate and I fucking lost it. I fucking lost it. I just hate the gym or say like, he like one.

Speaker 3:          00:03:28       Yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:03:29       he successfully ran a fucking bullshit smear campaign that will follow that guy.

Speaker 3:          00:03:34       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:03:35       An innocent man for the rest of his fucking career.

Speaker 3:          00:03:39       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:03:39       You know what he should've done? He should've had performance enhancing drugs sent to his house in his wife name because evidently benches fitches flies away. That's no big deal. Unreal on fucking real. And then it was funny though, they're that cool though because afterwards I was so fucking annoyed.

Speaker 3:          00:03:59       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:03:59       By him just seeing it that way and like blaming Tom Brady for not getting out in front of this stupid witch hunt. Right. That I actually called him up. This is how much time I wasted my life being upset and caring about sports for whatever fucking reason. You know, I'd call him up and I start talking to them and it finds out like he didn't even know half the facts of the story.

Speaker 3:          00:04:24       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:04:24       So I was like, dude, that's like reprehensible few be going on in their trash and this guy and you don't even know that the fucking better say paid for that fucking dope. It wasn't all at that. Should I know this is all right. But he brought it back up again,

Speaker 3:          00:04:36       you know,

Speaker 1:          00:04:38       and uh, I got to give it up to him. He fucking manned up and went back on his podcast and actually apologize for not knowing a couple of those fucking things, but I just all you fucking, I'm telling you right now,

Speaker 3:          00:04:48       yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:04:49       It's just a bunch of fucking patriots haters at this point. If you're going to ignore fucking hearing aids and helmets, performance enhancing drugs, centi wife for you out in all of that just goes away. But this fucking deflated fucking cunt hair with the air out of a ball doesn't, then I eat. You are, you are in my world. You are just, you just, you just hate on the Patriots. All right. Now if you give everybody shit, okay. And every time they bring up these other guys' names, you go, oh, wait a minute. You mean the guy who's offensive line head, the hearing aids. You mean that guy, you're going to do that, then they're not going to fucking do that. You're not going to do it. And it happened in Indianapolis.

Speaker 3:          00:05:30       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:05:31       That doesn't matter. Those are simple people out there. They put their pants on one leg at a time. Hey Guy, I get it. It, yeah, fucking give a shit bag. Um, so anyways, my travels going great.

Speaker 3:          00:05:41       And um,

Speaker 1:          00:05:43       so I was actually upset at myself for getting that worked up

Speaker 3:          00:05:46       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:05:47       About something that I really thought I was over. You know what I mean? It was like seeing a chick he broke up with, he was like, you know, I'm finally ready to fucking move on. And then, you know, you run into in a, and she just says that one thing and you go right back to the fucking end of the relationship, fucking talking yourself in the bathroom. And she'd taken a shower, you know, just completely losing your shit while kind of watching yourself going like, dude, she's winning. Just shut up. She's winning. And you just, but you got to get it out of you.

Speaker 2:          00:06:17       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:06:19       So anyways, I was sitting on the plane, right? We get off the fucking plane

Speaker 2:          00:06:23       and, uh,

Speaker 1:          00:06:25       I drive out here to fucking Red Bank, New Jersey, and I show up

Speaker 1:          00:06:31       and I got my bags and it's like seven, I think it was seven 48 in the morning. I took a red eye, right? And I come walking in and the second I saw the lady behind the desk looks at me. I know my room's not going to be ready. And I come walking in and I'm like, Yay, I got a reservation. And she's already shaking your head. She's like, we don't have, it's seven 48 in the morning. I go, no, no, no. Uh, but I paid for the room overnight so I could come in early and she sits like, yeah, no you didn't. Yeah, we don't have that. And then my blood starts going up so I start going like, you mean to tell me that I have to and I almost fell asleep on the ride over here cause I couldn't really sleep on the plane.

Speaker 2:          00:07:09       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:07:11       I blood starts going up and I'm sitting there going like, are you mean to tell me I have to drive around red bank until like two, three o'clock in the afternoon? She's like, I can try to expedite. But I was able to calm myself down. I was like, you know what? I already got into it with the Sklar brothers. Why do I want to get involved with this fucking person? This nice person here, you know, she had, see she, she has nothing to do with these decisions. I fucked up. Somebody fucked up, but she didn't. Right. So I just said, I find, she goes, you want to drop off your bags? I say yes. I vaguely remember driving to a diner.

Speaker 2:          00:07:47       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:07:47       And getting some eggs benedict

Speaker 1:          00:07:50       looking at this guy, you know, who do you ever see those guys? They just slept. I Dunno. They just have bandaids all over him. Like just, they had like 20 tests. Just take my second. I saw the guy was like, this guy is not good. This guy's not gonna be around for a long time. You know what I mean? I was in like one of these Tony Soprano fucking, uh, you know, looked like that one. You know what? You don't let one where, uh, Jimmy, the gent comes walking out and he knocks on the, the guy's falling up their window. Let's go fuck hoes. They kicked me up all night. They look like one of those places and I just looking at this guy, why this guy is not going to be, he's not gonna be around for awhile.

Speaker 2:          00:08:25       Um, you know,

Speaker 1:          00:08:29       man, he was like, fuck it. And he was eating eggs and bacon. It's just like, oh, there you go. Go out the way you want to go out. Right. So I get back in the car and like, I don't know what did, what am I going to fuck do you do? So I just drove back to the hotel parking lot,

Speaker 1:          00:08:44       reclined the seat, crack the whip and just slept in the car. It was funny was every 40 minutes I wake up and I'd be sweating because the sun was coming up more and more in the car was getting hotter and hotter. So I'd have to turn the car on, roll the windows down a little more and then go back to sleep. And uh, I did that for about like from, I dunno, 30 in the morning to about a quarter to 12. I'm 25 years into my career and this, the road is always going to be the road. This is well, he's going to happen and uh, I got to tell you though, I feel great. I got a fucking really good three hours came in, checked in, grabbed my bags, hit the hotel gym, knocking out the podcast. Um, anyways. Yeah, you guys got to listen to that, that Sklar one cause it's really good. Those guys fucking know that shit man. They really know their shit when it comes to a fucking, uh, sports and everything. And I kept teasing them that they did not look athletic at all. You know when they would like trash and Michael Jordan saying he petty, he's petty and it's just like, you guys aren't going to be those guys are you? The last guy picked it, did gym class and then when there's somebody as great as Michael Jordan,

Speaker 4:          00:10:06       okay,

Speaker 1:          00:10:06       you, you, you just can't accept it. He's great. You still have to, who the fuck says Michael? Jordan's petty. Like you hung out with them. You Watch one speech, he brings up the guy,

Speaker 4:          00:10:19       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:10:19       That he beat out in high school to introduce him.

Speaker 1:          00:10:23       That makes him petty. You don't know him. What it really is is you see yourself in that guy given the intro to Mike. So now you got to look at him like he's like, he's an asshole or something. Give me a fucking break and then we'll do bug you guy who gave the, gave you oh really? Heavier. Hung out with them then shut up. And also all of them, they've, Jordan never walked into their studio, they would never call him petty. Their voices would go up nine octaves. They'd ask him to sign this form, there's a fucking forehead draw the Air Jordan thing right on there. They go down to a tattoo parlor and have it tattooed. So, uh, enough already. Um, so anyways, sorry, I'm, I'm literally gonna get worked up about that thing. Oh, so anyways, it bugged, it bugged him. A one of them, I don't know what if it was Randy adjacent. Alright. It Bud, one of them that I was saying, they weren't athletic, so he sends me a video of him and his culdesac shooting a basketball in slow motion from really far away and it goes in. And that was some sort of demonstration that he was athletic. I still haven't trashed him for it yet.

Speaker 4:          00:11:27       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:11:27       It's just like, dude, there was nobody garden you, it wasn't a game. You know, he's like, that was the second attempt. I hate those stupid fucking videos. There was one the other night where a guy's in a helicopter is in the Robinson 44 and he throws him fucking basketball out and it goes through the hoop. It's like if you, if he could do it consistently, if he did it on the first try. Yeah. That's impressive. That poor guy flying the helicopter. You point me to keep landing cause they kept collecting the basketballs and they fucking go back up. Then it finally goes through. Yeah. You know you do it enough times. Yeah. It's going to go in. Um, anyways, uh, so I'm going to try to eat like an angel. I've been doing really good. I The ball, Billy knows booze bag. You know when I went out Tuesday night cause it was Joe to Rose's birthday and I'll tell you right now, I'm on my liver is so happy. Joe's only turn 40 once. Oh Oh let me tell you,

Speaker 1:          00:12:28       I was so hung over the next day I woke up like laughing. It was like, it was, it was so pathetic. I felt so bad it wasn't, it wasn't even like, it would be redundant to actually feel bad at that point. And, uh, I actually got up, forced down half a glass of water and I went out and I worked out, hung over as shit, you know, stretching out the hammies my big dumb fucking head down towards my ankles, you know, stretching out my hands and my head was just going to Gush, Gush, Gush, you know. But I gotta tell you that's where it be in German. Irish comes in, cause you will plow fucking through anything. You know what I mean? Is that was, that was Versie with this Mediterranean blood, knowing how to live life and, you know, smell the roses. Eh, this, he would've called in sick to work if he got up a second before 2:00 AM I'm telling you, Paul Versey, he would have been moaning. You know what I mean? Like he just shattered his leg. Uh Oh did, we had a great time. We had a great time. We went to two. We went to this old school when the oldest restaurants in, um, and a Hollywood on Hollywood boulevard.

Speaker 1:          00:13:51       Got It. I got a great steak, uh, split it with Nia and Joe got this fucking prime rib that I'm telling you, dude was like, I know that people always say the Flintstones. It was fucking gigantic. And I looked at it and he goes, dude, you gotta try it man. This is amazing. I was like, wow. And I looked down and I swear to God, it felt like six minutes later and I looked up and he was like down to the last two bites. I mean, did they take the kids and animal 40 years old is no slowing them down. And then we ended up at the American Legion and um, yeah. And I don't remember much after that. I remember I, I got him a cake,

Speaker 1:          00:14:32       you know, that's said a bunch of horrible things about them on it. And next thing you know, I was sitting in something that sort of resembled a tree fort or like a band stand kind of thing outside in the parking lot with like nine other people that I don't even know where they came from. And we were all smoking cigars and then I did the Irish goodbye. Um, somebody called me an Uber and that was it. But you know what? I'm right back on it though. You know, every once in a while you know, you don't, you gotta, you gotta fucking slap you liver ramp, let it know who's boss. Okay. Then other than that, you know, you take, you take care of it. You know, I have an abusive relationship with my, with my liver, but, uh, anyways, I'm out here, uh, doing red bank count Basie, theater, theater, uh, let me know some good spots to eat out here.

Speaker 1:          00:15:17       If you guys know, um, I've never stayed out here, but I'm excited to be out here and not have to deal with the fucking traffic coming out of Manhattan and, um, I can't wait to do these fucking shows because once these things is a great theater and, uh, I'm really loving where my act is at. And then on Sunday night, all things, comedy network is producing its first standup special with Paul Versey. Forsee yeah, yeah, yeah. At the Tarrytown theater and beautiful Tarrytown, New York City.

I mean, it's like, um,

Speaker 1:          00:16:16       you know what it's like, it's, it's like how most non white people think white people live valley think all white people live. Um, it is really, really, really, really quaint. I made, it's just like, I mean, it's just see like I, where's the pumpkin patch? It's like shit like that, you know, homemade ice cream. Yeah. This everything, but those, what does those fucking creepy things the girls used to hold and they would skip around a little girls and the playground. Okay, here we go. Round the fucking day. The fuck could they wonder, was it called the Mayberry at the Mayberry Bush? No, they just, you know, that's back when they didn't let women do anything. So like that was their idea of playing. You just grab on this string and you guys skip around. Yeah. You know what I mean? Why we're fucking guys are playing sports. Trying to figure out each other's weaknesses. I guess women were doing that, but on a different level. Right. I bet she doesn't like her nose. I'm going to say something about that. Um, I'm sorry. I'm still, uh, I'm still fucking shit. What do you want from me? I slept on a fucking, I mean, you know what I, by the way, I don't even know what the fuck I slept in.

Um, anyways, how about those five of those red socks, Huh?

Speaker 4:          00:17:56       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:17:57       Just tearing through the bottom part of the fucking league. The real test comes this weekend when they play the ag right where we were with you. She'll be again. Now it isn't, it all ended in 2004 but it's still fun, right? The baby bombers first to fucking $200 million Red Sox, all the dealer that, you know what? I Bet America would be rooting for the Yankees. You know, they created all of this shit. You know, you know what the Yankees are? They're like, dude, fucking the bad influence. Older brother, you know who did well and like, you know, uh, preschool, elementary, right through middle school and then somewhere in high school just start, just went off the fucking rails. And then the red socks. I like the next brother who had the fucking try to outdo him. That's what we're doing. We went right over the cliff. Now spend it too and fucking million dollars. 200 million. God Damn Doll was the middle child, the fucking middle child. Um, but anyways, we went nine and one in the last 10 games were up for games on the Yankees over there. Thank you to the Tampa Bay devil rays. I'm still calling you the devil race instead of the race. Ray's Pizza,

Speaker 5:          00:19:12       Ray Romano. Come on, right.

Speaker 1:          00:19:16       What are you, you're the devil race. Um, that's gotta be one of the, like, that's one of another thing goes back to that Colin Kaepernick thing. Like, it's a fucking, it's just, it's a corporation is everybody tries to put race on it. At the end of the day it's a fucking corporation and that's what it is. All they have to do is look at the Tampa Bay devil rays. There was probably nine Jesus freaks that weren't going to buy a fucking devil rays tee shirt and God forbid they lose that fucking hundred and 60 bucks or whatever, whatever, whatever, 180 bucks or 20 bucks a whack, right? God forbid that that goes out the door. They take the fuck they took the devil right off it.

Speaker 1:          00:19:58       We're losing our a Jesus Freak, a fan base. You know, and I think that's what the NFL is doing with Colin Kaepernick. God forbid they lose the racist dollar. That's what it is. They are catering to the racist by not putting this guy on cause they don't want to lose cause a racist dollars are also green and that's all they give a shit about. Right. They don't give a fuck. Look at the fucking Goddamn Tigers. They're gonna fingerprint their own fucking fence. What do you think those tigers front office is going to do with that information? Where do you think they're going to sell that? Do you know what? This is the thing, most people, I swear to God, I hate to be this cynical, but they just, they just fucking go into life and they're looking for like someone else to fill the role of their parents. And that's why the micro chipping the fingerprints, all of that will be inevitable because there's so many people who should be walking around wearing a fucking diaper. I hate to say, but they do, you know,

Speaker 1:          00:21:05       oh, he's crying. Life fucked me over there. You know what? I'm going to start to sell it. I'm going to start selling adult size rattles as I sit here whining and crying about sports, I got a lot of fucking nerve. You know, that's one of the great things about me. I'm a God damn hypocrite. Hey, guess what? I got to, I got a, uh, I've got a Gopro for my birthday last year and I finally had Andrew come over and show me how to fucking get the thing going. I just saw the wires and the small printing. I just like, I'm never going to figure that out. I can't get it out of the case. I actually got this thing to film when I was flying, uh, you know, the helicopter and uh, I got all the shit that I needed and I just, I don't know. Oh, I know. I fucked up my back last year so I couldn't fly because my feet were going numb there. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:21:53       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:21:55       So anyways, I, let me, let me read a little bit of advertising. Can we try to gracefully get out of this? Um, I feel bad about that Sklar podcast cause I think they thought I really got upset. It's just, I don't think they know me well enough to be like, no, that's just kinda how the fuck I get when I talk about sports to somebody's bugging me in two seconds later,

Speaker 2:          00:22:11       you know, it's, it's gone. You know,

And why weren't they had a meeting to figure that out. So they do everything they can to make sure that drivers are happy on every trip. Lyft was the first to order in APP tipping. When you drive for lip, you keep 100% of the tips. Drivers had been paid over $200 million in tips since the feature was introduced. That's really great though. You know, that's like that Guy Papa John's pizza. I was watching that. Jay Leno, Jay Jay's garage, and that guy, uh, the guy who does the Papa John's pizzas, you know, he had to sell his car to keep his dad's bar going. He was making the pizza in the back in 1971 Camaro. Z 28 gold with the black stripes and he fucked 20 years, was looking for the car track down the exact fucking car. But he's talking about it like 30% of the profits he brings. He puts back into the business as far as like, you know, given bonuses to all of us employees. I don't know why more corporations don't do that.

Speaker 3:          00:25:41       You know,

Speaker 1:          00:25:42       why don't you do that? They then people are happy to work for you. And then when I walk into but order a pizza, I don't get some grumpy ass holes getting fucked over.

Speaker 3:          00:25:51       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:25:52       Who knows? I don't know why the same reason why they won't sign Colin Kaepernick. Uh, express pay lets drivers get paid almost instantly instead of waiting for weeks. Lyft has even taken the guesswork out of pickups. The new amp device uses color coding to help passengers find their drivers. You can earn hundreds of dollars a week plus tips what are and more money drive more. It's never been easier to give yourself a raise. It's a simple formula. Happy drivers mean happy passengers. Maybe that's why nine out of 10 Lyft rides get a perfect five star ratings.

Speaker 1:          00:30:36       Fucking Christ. All right, it's gone away. It's gone away. It's part of being old right there. You know, by the way, anytime you get a cramping, like if you ever bring your toes back towards you, you know, you stretch in the morning, she started pointing your toes, your face, and you've legs cramp up immediately. Just point your toes the other way. It goes right away.

Speaker 3:          00:30:56       All right?

Speaker 1:          00:30:58       You don't have to sit there going, fuck, fuck. You know, he kicks it down the hall thinking get died. Uh, there's no hidden fees and no commitments.

Now, from what I've been told, the reason why that is getting back to the, uh, the cramping in your legs. All right? If you go the other way is, is

Speaker 1:          00:31:27       it's sorta like a ying and a Yang. You know what I mean? The muscles on the front of your body versus the back of your body. Like I, my shoulders got fucked up cause I was doing pushups, I was doing curls out doing and all that, but I wasn't doing enough back exercises. So my shoulders started rolling forward. All right, there's a balance. So whatever the fuck you do, I don't know medically what happens, but if you, you do the exact opposite motion, when you get that cramp, it fucking whatever is tightening up, then release this. Now you go. And you know what, after I tried to explain it, you're no closer to understanding it. Okay? I'm all, by the way, I did the gym Jeffrey show this week. Uh, I'll put, I'll tweet out a link for that. Um, I had a great time on that. What a great interviewer he is. You know, I didn't know how that was going to go to fucking Comedians, you know, was shit that they want to say. I was, uh, I felt like I do when I'm on Conan. Conan is like an old school Johnny Carson guy where it's like if you're killing, he lets you go. He laughs at your jokes. He makes you look great. If you start struggling, he comes to the rescue,

Speaker 3:          00:32:30       right. And um,

Speaker 1:          00:32:33       Jim Jefferies was the exact same way. Old School fucking guy. So a highly recommend that show. Um, dude, he was killing, he was killing so hard, like even just doing like some stuff where he was just doing like a, hey, Seattle watched the show, blah, blah, blah, whatever you call those things. He was killing so hard when he was just messing those up. Like just constantly was killing that. I was standing backstage like laughing, thinking like, this guy doesn't need me, really doesn't need me as a guy. You appreciate him having a yard. But he really could have just done this by himself. He really is. Um, you know, when you go see Jim Jeffries, I mean, I'm, I'm not, I don't think I'm bullshitting when I would say that guy's probably cause everybody's top five, top three, you know, that's always arguable. You know, you can argue you to whoever you think is the best.

Speaker 1:          00:33:25       He's without a doubt. I would say top three in the fucking world. He's like one of the best comedians in the fucking world. It's, that's the real deal. So a checkout his show, please come out. There's still a few tickets left for a Paul [inaudible], a special and Gera. But bubba, Bubba, Bubba, bubba above the 33 minutes. Okay, please enjoy this music here. Um, I'm going to try out my GoPro. I'm very excited to try this thing out to see what comes about this. And um, I've been threatening to do a show of me driving around freaking out. I don't need, don't know if I need to put that out there anymore with me fucking freaking out. I do it enough on podcasts and shit, but uh, we'll see. We'll see where it goes. So enjoy this music as we transition into a Thursday afternoon podcasts from a Thursday from, I don't know when a joy it and uh, hey, shout out to Darren King and, and the unbelievable drumming that he did when he was with mute math and good luck to him and all of his future projects and good luck to mute math, um, on their upcoming tour.

Speaker 1:          00:34:34       Um, I forget the drama is named Dave Hutchinson or something like that. They got to replace Darren King, uh, mute mass new album is coming out in September. I've already preordered it. Very excited, very excited to see them on this tour. And very excited to see what Darren's going to be doing, um, with whatever his next project is. A, that's it. Okay. Thank you guys for listening. Have a great weekend. You concern, I'll, uh, I'll talk to you on Monday.

Speaker 4:          00:35:30       I Dunno.

Speaker 1:          00:35:31       All over the map. That's why like, you know, certain ways of looking at shit, like when people

Speaker 6:          00:35:38       talk about guns, like let's just make them what, let's just make them illegal as a no, we all have them. You know, like that's sort of like thought process is your, you're acting as though the world is a utopia and that there's not morons and that there's not, uh, people who say, I don't give a fuck what the rules are. You're totally not even taking into consideration sociopath's which is why that new fucking thing that Obama signed, that whole defense package where now they can just arrest people without a trial and put you in jail forever with, without a trial because they just think you're a fucking terrorist. You can't give people that level of power. I'm a fucking moron. And I know you can't do that. Historically, no one has ever handled that level of power. Well, anybody here want to go live in China and now we out there practicing your nun chucks wearing your wooden slippers and all of a sudden the van pulls up and you disappear and that's it.

Speaker 6:          00:36:34       Forever. You want to live there? Of course you don't. You want to live here where they can't fucking do it. Well, they can do it now. You know? They just put in a fucking order for a bunch of black fans. That's what I heard. According to Holy shit.com that's what's going down. I don't understand why stuff at that level that affects citizens to that level. Why we don't get to vote on it. Do you think it's because we'd say, Hey, you know what? Fuck that. Do you want me to stand like that is just a jump off point. Do you think like that's just how it's going to stall? As long as you're not a terrorist in there, you ain't got to fuck bro. You think it's just going to stop with that. That's not how you take away freedom. You don't just fucking do it all in one fell swoop.

Speaker 6:          00:37:18       It's incremental. It's just like when you're dating some fucking woman and you're not paying attention and she just gradually, every day it takes another foot of real estate. Next thing you know you're in goal line d going, how the fuck did I end up in this situation? We started at the 50 a little push, a little poll, right? Everything was fine. Seen all Europe against the Golan. The you think that they're just going to keep it with the terrorist thing, you know? You know they'll wait for a whole nother generation of babies to be born and they always grew up with government having that level of power and then they had something else to it. Then they had something else. Then that's it. You can't have it. Okay. If Tiger Woods can't handle the level of free pussy on a golf tour, how the fuck is our government going to handle a new defense package? Which basically gave them a mute button when you love to, hey, how would you handle that if you had that power, do you, how long before you just started abusing that? If you could just hit mute on anybody who ever disagreed with you and it just, and you could have them whisked away.

Speaker 6:          00:38:27       I mean that is the sociopath's wet dream. That's what that is. That is a fucking mute button, Mr Style and

Speaker 7:          00:38:36       don't you think that's it?

Speaker 6:          00:38:37       He hit mute. You're done. You're gone. See Ya. I think, I think it's fucking insane and I'm, the only thing that I get out of it is that I feel like I was proven correct that I don't think it matters at that level. Whether you vote Democrat or Republican Obama, the first black president ever, you would think this would be the most liberal a politician in the history of this country.

Speaker 3:          00:39:07       Okay.

Speaker 6:          00:39:07       Because of his background. You would think that he signed off on that shit. All right. I'm telling you, I don't know what happens when you become president, but I think they let you peek just enough behind the curtain and you there, there is

Speaker 7:          00:39:21       fucking agenda that we are moving towards because it does, I don't think it fucking matters. I really don't, which is why I always vote for the Ralph Nader, the fuck and Ron Paul, all those guys that all those fucking idiots go. Oh do cause you did that. You've ruined the election. Really? Did I?

Speaker 3:          00:39:44       Okay.

Speaker 7:          00:39:45       I feel like those guys wouldn't have signed shit like that. I feel like their track record shows that they would not sign shit like that.

Speaker 3:          00:39:52       Um, I, I don't know.

Speaker 6:          00:39:55       I have no, I imagine I'm going to get a ton of fucking emails I'm on with. Somebody was yelling at me one time saying that because I voted for Ralph Nader in 2000. That's why George W. Bush won and they just going on and on and on about it. And I was like, dude, I live in New York. Al Gore won my state. Okay. Do you understand that? So your whole fucking theory right now is out the window. I voted for Ralph Nader in New York and Al Gore still won the state. So go fuck yourself. What I'm trying to do, uh, missed a fucking red and blue tie here. I'm trying to fucking encourage more people like that devote. So mission accomplished. That's what I'm trying to fuck and have to vote to run,

Speaker 3:          00:40:39       you know.

Speaker 6:          00:40:41       Uncorruptible how far can you get if you're uncorruptible I would say that you can get to the uh, or whatever level politics is when you decide whether or not they should put a gazebo in the center of town. I think beat, once you get beyond that, you got it. You got to be a little dirty. Right. I love talking about this shit cause it just stirs people up, you know?

Speaker 7:          00:41:06       Um, you know, maybe you should all read a little more before the next time you took an ohm.

Speaker 6:          00:41:12       Really? What are you reading? What are you reading? What they give you? Is that what you're reading? Fuck head. Why you acting like you have clearance to the bottom floors of the fucking Pentagon? You're guessing? Just like I am. All right, Mr. Informed, I read the pamphlet, I don't buy a fucking word of it.

Speaker 3:          00:41:32       You know,

Speaker 7:          00:41:34       you can use coca cola to take rust off of metal. You can use it for that. You know, you understand that yet they're still able to sell it to us. Like it's refreshing. I don't know what that point meant either.

Speaker 8:          00:41:52       Okay.

Speaker 4:          00:42:49       Okay.

Speaker 7:          00:43:04       Hey, what's going on? It's bill burr and this is the Monday morning podcast for Monday, August the 10th 2009 that I'm actually doing on Tuesday, August the 11th, because a DHS wasn't enough hours in the day. Oh my God, I got south swamps. No, I did. I don't know what happened. I know what happened. I had a big audition for something and uh, I had to just keep doing the audition over and over again. And when I wasn't doing that, I was curled up in the fetal position. Go and please bill, don't fuck this up. This is a big opportunity. And fortunately I did not, whether they pick me a knot is out of my hands, but, um, and then I just said a bunch of other shit. Why does it sound like it's echoing in here? I Dunno. I'm trying a new recording level, uh, this week by the way, people, I don't know if the quality's going to suffer, but, um, I had a number of people and by a number, I mean like six, um, which I think is about one third of my listeners.

Speaker 7:          00:44:04       So it was big to me. Uh, we're saying that a, I needed to get more bandwidth or I needed to do something. Basically they couldn't download my, uh, my podcast off of iTunes or whatever. And somebody finally called it to my attention that I was recording at music level quality. So my files were huge and considering that I wasn't recording musical instruments that I could actually record at a lower and they would be smaller files thus easier to download. So I said, I know what I'm going to do. Okay. I'm going to fucking go find the owner's manual and I'm going to figure out how to do that. And, uh, even though I have a little file, it'll little fucking a big piece of Tupperware. Whatever the fuck you call it, big plastic bin that's going to be here 9,000 years from now. Um, I have all my owner's manuals for everything I ever bought except for my Olympus ls 10.

Speaker 7:          00:45:01       I don't know where the fuck it is. So I just went into menu and I put it on MP three and I'm recording at 128 fucking killer. What's a, what's a white's? Whatever the fuck you call him. I don't know what the, I don't know what it is. So I'm going to try it this week. So you guys give me a feedback, let me know how the quality sounds. Was it easier to download? Was it harder to download? Was it the same? Was it just a futile fucking attempt? Um, anyways, he almost hit a bad bit, right? They're like, why is it that you can find everything move of who you're looking for? Um, all right. I got a lot of stories for you. Why this week? Let's start off with, I had a, uh, you know, I had a nice district cremant this morning was somebody in particular and I realized in that fight that the secret to success is basically, I mean, I'm sure somebody is already written a book about this, but I don't read.

Speaker 7:          00:45:56       So I'm feeling like I'm breaking new ground here. The secret to success in life is the word yes and the word no. That is it. If you want to be a happy person, if somebody says, do you want to do this shit and you want to do it? Say yes, yes I do. And then if they're like, but do you want to do this shit? And you don't say, no, I don't. Now I know that sounds simple, but it's afterwards. That is the hard part. And I feel as the reason why so many people say yes when they mean no and vice a versa is because basically the fucking reaction of the other person, you have to just completely block out their reaction. You know? Do you want to do this? No, I don't. Usually when you say no negative, don't want to do it, the other person is just like, why?

Speaker 7:          00:46:56       Why don't you want to do it? I thought it'd be fun. I thought we could do it together. I thought it would be a choice of, well, why don't you want to do it? Because you asked me and the first fucking thing in me, wherever that voice in me said, no, I don't want to do it. So then I said no, right. I heard what you said, Glen, and I am going to fucking speak it out loud. So this other person, because they can't hear my inner voice. No, the answer is no. And then they always go, you're ridiculous. You just, you just being a jerk. You're being crazy. Really? Is that what my inner voice is a jerk? You know how many French I want to ask you guys is how many friendships in your life do you have right now where, uh, you can actually say, no, I don't want to do that shit.

Speaker 7:          00:47:45       And the other person's cool with it. You know, people will give you a little bit of grief but you gotta be careful because a lot of times there's a lot of concern out there and uh, how they deem somebody, a friend is basically that they do everything that they want them to do. You know, and then the second you start going, hey, you know, I really don't feel like doing that stuff, dude. You changed what the fucks with you. God, go fuck yourself. You're a cunt. All right. What do you, what do you think you're perfect and you always have the best idea. Go Fuck Yourself. I don't want to do what you want to do right now. You know, I just got a big God damn argument because uh, I want to flip to find, I went the fuck it was about as far as I was trying to tell me.

Speaker 7:          00:48:26       I never want to fucking do anything. I mean I've worn a door. Anything I want to do my Monday morning podcast you saying that's nothing. Okay. Cause if you are, I'll tell you, I got 18 listeners. You have to, you have to fucking talk to buddy. What was, that's all I'm saying. All right? Somebody asked you if you want to do something, if you want to do it, say yes. If you don't want to do with say now, okay and fuck their reaction, unless they can kick the shit out of you, at which point you say, yeah, I'd love to. And then you sort of mutter to yourself the rest of the evening, and then what you do is on the side, you start taking some martial art classes, either that or you call a moving company that can pack up all your shit and move it to another state while other person who can kick the shit out of you.

Speaker 7:          00:49:13       Is it work? That's how you do it. Okay? There's nothing wrong. I think the word coward is overused. Um, you know, and I think it's used by the person who wanted to kick the shit out of you, but you were smart enough not to be in the vicinity of them, to let them, you're know how you work, how you didn't let me fucking smash your face into your fucking ear. You Coward. Well, you know, Dude, uh, I listened to my inner voice. Men or voice did not want my nose over by my ear, so I decided to avoid it. Yes. You know, you are stronger than me. You can kick the shit out of me. Okay. But you know, that doesn't mean I'm not better at checkers. You know, there's something, this is a subject you can pick then I'm better at it than you, but it may, maybe fighting's not one of them.

Speaker 7:          00:50:03       Why does it? Oh, that's what it always comes down to with guys. You know, in the end I can beat the fuck out of you. So therefore I'm right. You know. Oh Jesus, I'm getting deep here. Isn't that how the world works? Mine is right. Isn't that what? Oh, is not how everybody's foreign policy works. You fucking seeing other country and they have some shit that you want. So what do you do? Do you say, hey, how's it going? How are you? Maybe do that beginning just so that you can get within fucking striking distance and then you grab him by the front of the a button down. You know, when you sort of lift them up off the ground, so part of their shirt is obscuring their view. So they don't see the overhand right coming. Isn't that what we do? Isn't it? I don't fucking know.

Speaker 7:          00:50:44       You know, I was watching our, the bill Maher show the other day and he was, uh, yesterday actually, and um, at the end of the show he was giving out these statistics and he was saying stuff like, uh, he's basically talking about how fucking stupid Americans are, which I'm really getting tired of that, you know, I'm not saying we're not fucking stupid, I'm just like, as compared to who, you know, I've, you know, I haven't traveled to a lot of places, but I've been to some places that were not flying the American flag and there's just as many fucking morons, you know, if everybody's smart, then there's no smart guys. You're just regular, you know what I mean? Jesus. Wow. Bill, that was fucking deep. Fuck you. Fuck you want from me? I'm just saying, you know what I mean? So anyways, here he's doing this poll.

Speaker 7:          00:51:33       Actually, I actually really liked his show. One of the things I love about Bill Maher is, uh, he's not really likable and he doesn't seem to give a fuck. And you know, I mean, yeah, I mean does that the kind of person you want to have over for dinner? Probably not, but, uh, that's a good recipe for getting a lot of pussy in life. Um, well we'll discuss that later. Um, plowing ahead here. So he starts doing all these polls and he's sitting there going, you know, 18% only 18% of Americans could name a new, Oh knew that there was two senators for every state and a only 11% could name who are, you know, so immediately that's supposed to make it seem like everybody's dumb. And my first thought was, okay, 18% can know that you get two senators per state, but I bet you know, a good 28% could explain the cover two defense.

Speaker 7:          00:52:32       You know, it just depends on what the fuck you're into. I like when people are really into something and you're not into it. And then they consider you stupid. Make granted we are talking about the people who determine how we live our lives. Actually they don't. That's the illusion. You know, it's the fucking bankers. Okay. They run everything, man. I'm telling, I'm not going to do that again this week and embarrass myself with my incredible lack of knowledge, but you know, whatever. I just don't think people are as fucking dumb as they're lazy, you know? But the way that they really just depict people out there, like people are just walking around with their fucking mouths hanging open, not realizing that they're drooling. All of the, all over the front of their Kenny Chesney shirt. And I, you know, Kenny Chesney is, I mean, I know he's a country singer. Who was that the one who was married to that chick who's fucking face squints up whenever she smiles. Yeah. And they were married for like three days ball dude. Is that who the fuck it is? Huh? I don't know. I can't stand country music. It's just depressing. It's depressing and it's Geeky

Speaker 7:          00:53:43       and everybody sings like they, they're in puberty. There you go. That was nice. Generalizations. Huh?

Speaker 9:          00:53:50       Ooh,

Speaker 7:          00:53:52       that shit. I can't fucking stay on that. And I don't like rednecks blind pride in being an American, you know, cause it always involves sticking a boot up somebody's ass or whatever the fuck. It's just like, why can't you be here and just be happy, you know, and watch to a fucking farming equipments. Try to pull in opposite directions as you fucking rare your head back and fucking scream at the moon. There's nothing wrong with that. Fucking nothing wrong with that. Why do you gotta be so God damn it? Why you gotta be like me and be angry? Huh? You Straw hat. It can't. All right. Uh, moving on. Um, so my dog, uh, is, she's in heat right now cause she hasn't been fixed and uh, yeah, it looks like a fucking crime scene here around here because she's a female and I'm going to leave it at that. And uh, she scheduled to be a mutilated later on this month.

Speaker 7:          00:54:57       That's really what it is. Mutilated. I'm gonna have my dog mutilated. I'm against it, but I, I got tired of arguing about it and, uh, you know, I don't, I don't understand why you have to have your dog. I just don't fucking get it. You know, I get it. But you know, if everybody did what Bob Barker said, there'd be no more dogs and cats within 15 years because they'd all be spayed or neutered, you know? And since, when does a leathery 90 year old know anything about fucking animals when his main Gig is to host a fucking game show? You know, I love how that fat fuck with the itchy beard, you know, he gets all shit for his, oh, this document I can never met Michael Moore can never remember people's fucking names. Is that the same guy who, who doesn't? Michael Moore looked like the son of that other fat dude with the itchy beard, but it, it's all white.

Speaker 7:          00:55:59       You know, he sorta, it looks like in a feminine Santa Claus and he wears those red glasses and he writes like Oscar jokes for, uh, uh, Billy crystal. God, I suck at names. Billy Crystal. You know, the guy I'm talking about doesn't, Michael Moore looked like the son of that fucking guy. Hey, doesn't this guy who I can't remember his fucking name look like the other guy who I can't remember his name. That was really brutal. I apologize for that. Let's get back to clear off. So clean. I was doing fucking great, but the only, I only have one problem with her. Um, the main problem with her is she does not like men. She doesn't like guys. Um, unless they come over, they come over to the house, you know, we bring them in and they sit down and she can kind of sniff them out. Then shit is cool.

Speaker 7:          00:56:43       But when she walks down the street, um, you know, when guys, second secondary is based in somebody's voice, she's such freaking out and a, I don't know how to stop her from doing it. I keep disciplining her, but she, she really blows me off. She blows me off with that. And squirrels, you know, she starts dragging me down the fucking street. I could literally water ski behind this Goddamn Dog. It's so strong. And, uh, I know went out to this breakfast place the other day and you know, this fucking old lady shows up with her husband who has osteoporosis. You know, if you don't know what that is, you have a see old people who look like they're fascinated with their feet. You know, that's fucking osteoporosis. So anyways, he's fucking comes walking in. So he looks at my dog who's totally chill and he just keeps staring at her in the eyes and then she rah Rah Rah Rah Rah Rah. And then she fucking jumped up at him. A fucking 90 year old man. Cleo, what's wrong with you

Speaker 6:          00:57:43       cleo? Come over here for a second. Did you could make your debut here on the Monday morning pocket. Come here. Come on, get off here. Is there a fucking reason? Come on, get up here. Come on. Is there a reason? Is there a reason why you fucking tried to kill a 90 year old man the other day? Huh? That's all you got to say. Fucking jackass. She was seen. He jumped right on off one after the God damn dude. Just sorta lunged. Just sorta lunch. This guy is probably a veteran of world war two. Right. And uh, then I brought it down and then the old Eddie goes is ad Pitbull Bay. They shouldn't be allowed around paper, you know, and I fucking let it go. Believe it or not. I did let it go. I didn't really say really yield fucking bat. How did you get here?

Speaker 6:          00:58:34       How'd you drive down the street? When did you get your fucking driver's license? Huh? Do they even have driver's license when you fucking cranked your first automobile? Huh? You're wrinkled up. Pruny little fucking Twat. I didn't say that. I just sat there. I had respect. I have respect for all people. I mean, I think that shit, I just don't say it. I just sat there. You know when you do that shit, when someone's yelling at you and you can't yell back at them, you don't look at them and you do that shit where your lips disappear. When you make that thing, you'll lips mouth is a straight line. You just sit there nodding, Hey Chad and bail out of our paper by at night. Right. Or I'd get around a goddamn right parking the car. And I just sat there nodding as everyone else was looking at her. And then it was funny as hell because my dog was totally chill until that evil old couple showed up, like on blaming them now. Right. So I have to, she tells me basically my dog should not be allowed around people, which is fucking true in a lot of ways. She walks around the corner and then there's just some cute little, I want to play Frisbee dog. And the second they came around the corner, that dog started freaking out.

Speaker 8:          00:59:35       Okay.

Speaker 6:          00:59:35       So you know, maybe it wasn't my dog. Cleo, can you do me a favor? Can you just not, if you're going to bite somebody, I'm going to have to go to court. Okay. And they're probably going to use this podcast as evidence. You know, God help me if they abuse his podcast, he knew what was going to happen and he called her an old cut. Now if you could do me a favor, hey, look at me Cleo. No, fuck you. So just don't make it somebody old. Give me a chance, just give me a chance to maybe win the court case.

Speaker 8:          01:00:14       Okay.

Speaker 6:          01:00:18       You liked that? That's what she does. Want to give her a good scratch. She starts fucking moment.

Speaker 8:          01:00:22       Ah,

Speaker 6:          01:00:25       what the fuck am I going to deal with you? How the hell did you show up in my life? You know what I like about you though? You don't ask me to do shit that I don't want to fucking do. And then when I say I don't want to do it, you don't act all fucking weird. Like I got a problem. So anyways, that was my week. That was my weekend. You know what? I went 20 days without drinking. And then I, last night I finally just said, you know, I actually got scared that eventually I was, I was gonna have a drink and, but I, I would have gone like 80 days and then I, I could never go on a run again. I've tried to be sober because I know I would never break if I ever went 80 days being sober, there's no fuck that would be like, you know, trying to beat Joe Dimaggio's hitting streak.

Speaker 6:          01:01:03       There's no fucking, it's like, why even try, you know? So I, I called it quits at 20, and I am ashamed at what I called it quits with. I went to this fucking bar and I ordered, went to order a blue moon because I'm a, I'm a, I'm a snobby cont, you know, give me a blue moon with little slice of orange in it and I'll sit here with my legs crossed, like I'm selling art. Right. That's what I wanted to do. And uh, they are like, oh wait, I have, when I have it here, we're all out all out. And I was like a corona. Yeah, we, yeah. No, now you don't, we don't, we don't have karate. We don't, not trying to here. All right, let me get you a list of bears. And they had their list of beers and then I ordered a Miller lite.

Speaker 6:          01:01:43       She's like, oh, hey Kai. Yeah, you're going to kill me. We just ran out of mail at high and I was like, bitch, what the fuck do you have here? I'm going to say, bitch. I looked down at the bar and I did sort of a fucking stupid smile and I was like, what beers do you have with your fucking content was underneath it. Which is ridiculous because I don't think she was in charge of ordering it. She's just in charge of, you know, selling it or whatever it serving it. That's the worst about having a public job where you get a job. Will you deal with the public is most of the Times it's not your fault. So not only do you have your job, the other part of your job is to get yelled at for shit that people above you did, you know?

Speaker 6:          01:02:28       So anyway, so I ordered a fucking Amstel light and it tasted like ass in out. It tasted like somebody rubbed their armpit on somebody's ass. That's what a time that didn't even fuck it. Make sense? It just, it didn't taste good. And I had one of those and then I went right back to fucking, I went back to coax. I know, I like it. I like being, I like going to bars and not fucking drinking. I cannot. I'm starting to enjoy it. And then watching everybody else get hammered and say dumb shit that they're going to have to apologize for. I think I've done that enough in life. I've apologized enough times. Have an eye. All right. And with that, I'm going to get onto some hyping some shit. This has been a damn good podcasts so far. I feel good. I'm well rested, Huh? Isn't that right? Cleo? You liked that?

Speaker 6:          01:03:19       Yeah. She fucking love set, Huh? Right on the rib cage. Um, put my dog in a headlock. You know I do that shit. Come in. It's almost like the rear naked choke. Just like doing it. Look at that Jesus Christ. Fucking size of your nipples. What kind of message are you trying to send out there? Huh? You little whore walking around trying to get some doggy Dick. I've seen you sniffing every fucking blade of grass. You ought to be ashamed of yourself. That's not how we raised you. Then again, you were down by the river for Awhile, Huh? And Yeah, you were definitely hungry, but you were reading, Huh? How did you get all those meals? Cleo?

Speaker 6:          01:03:59       How many Douggie Dick's. Did you have a new man? Right? That's fucking weird. All right. Ah, you don't, I didn't notice about dogs is um, their, their front legs, which are my world are the arms and the back legs. Uh, they bend the exact opposite as a humans. I've never noticed that before. You know? Well, I guess down towards the bottom they do. Now wait a minute. The front ones do. I'm an idiot. They've been the same way at the front. Ones do, but in the same way. All right, you got me on that one. So that's sorta like its wrist and elbow, but the back legs, that's what it is. They're fucking dare a, their knee, their knee joint goes the opposite way. In fact, your fucking look at that. Your, your Patella is behind your leg. You see this. This is why you can't get a job in the real world.

Speaker 6:          01:04:48       Cleo, your fucking knees are on the wrong side of your legs. You know that. Other than that, you don't have a shirt on. You're fucking nipples showing to the world and you get a job at the circus. You know, I'm not trying to be a dick here, but why don't you fucking kick him for some rent? Every once in a while. I've got to buy another big bag of fucking dog food. Look, you're just laying there like he can't hear me. You know what I'm talking about? Leave your fancy new collar. G last owners do that. I don't think so. This is an abusive relationship here. All right, let's move on here. Let's, let's talk about some shit that I have that I have going on. I don't know why I had to say that twice that I hit up, that I have. Oh, look at that.

Speaker 6:          01:05:27       I'm learning how to play. Shoot the thrill. Shoot to thrill the video tutorial. Anybody out there play a guitar? You want to a good youtube, uh, this, this Guy Solo Dallas. He's got all these fucking uh, ACDC songs. He shows you how to play a man. It's a, I dunno. And then you can be the hit at your next party. Such a fucking loser. All right, let's get back to what the hell I was talking about here. This is what I got coming up. You notice how it was a great podcast until I said it was a great podcast and now I'm not living up to it. Um, anyways, this is what I got coming up this week, Friday, Saturday and Sunday. I'm going to be at the punchline in Atlanta and I'm coming up in September. I'm going to be at the helium comedy club in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.

Speaker 6:          01:06:14       Uh, September 10th through the 12th. And I added a date. I added two dates. One is for all you California people. All right. And I really need you to show up for this one because the [inaudible] are basically paying me like fucking $5 in a new pair of shoe laces because they don't feel that I can draw out here in California because, uh, because I'm a light guy, I think, you know, not a lot of white guys out here. You know, that was my big mistake. I should've gone out laid in the sun. I just would've been all red. It would have thought it was a native American. They would've booked me in a fucking casino. Anyways, I'm gonna be at the, uh, the Improv in Ontario, California for four fucking days. September 17th, 18th, 19th, and 20th for the love of God could you and 48 of your closest fucking white, black, Mexican, Asian, whatever you can grab, please bring them out to those shows because it sucks, man.

Speaker 6:          01:07:20       I live out here in la. There's three clubs that I could be playing, you know, where I could actually not have to fucking jump in an airplane. I want to play Los Angeles area. I really would like to, but I really need you motherfuckers to show up because if you don't show up, I can't play out here any more because they offer me $5 in a new pair of shoe laces. Okay. And uh, I said, fuck it. I'll do it for that Gig and I'm going to show that I can draw out here so they can come out here, you know, and not to have to get on a plane every fucking week. All right. So I added that date. And then the other date that I added was I added a date and Seattle, Washington at one of my favorite clubs, giggles comedy club, uh, for December 10th, 11th, and the 12th.

Speaker 6:          01:08:06       And I scheduled that around a Seattle Seahawks home game mother fuckers. And when I go to that, that is going to be my 100th franchise that I've seen actually not won't be because I'm doing the champion problems, see the Phoenix Suns and I'm going to come in a day early for Seattle so I can go to Portland trails trailblazer's game because I have OCD. I have to go to all of them. Why do I have to go to all of them? I don't know why. I don't know why. That's why I do on the plane. I sat there and I check them off like the fucking rain, man. I'm a Weirdo. So anyways, when I go to all of those, I'll basically have Ben to everything out here, west of Denver, everything, all the way up Edmonton, all of that shit. I've been to all of them. And you know what?

Speaker 6:          01:08:49       It hasn't filled me up a bit. I'm still fucking empty. All right, that was sad. That was just sad. Let's get back to, uh, you know what? I gave you guys some homework last week. Uh, I told you to go out and go see the movie, the orphan because I wanted to make fun of that movie, but I didn't want to ruin it for you. So if you didn't go and see it, that's your own God damn fault. And you probably want to fast forward through the next four minutes of this podcast because I want to talk about this movie. It's a horror movie that I, uh, I actually loved. I loved it even though it kind of stunk. It was, it reminded me of a horror movies from the 1980s. And, uh, one of the things that, there was always the requirement of is that you had to have,

Speaker 4:          01:09:37       oh, do you hear that alarm?

Speaker 6:          01:09:39       If I told you what kind of car that was, it's like a fucking 1988 now it's not that, and it's probably like a 1991 Honda accord, a site, you know, it's the classic, nobody's going to steal that car. And every time a truck drives by or somebody says, I don't want to do it. And they punch the top of their bureau. It's sets the fucking alarm often that God damn car. And uh, I dunno. I think it's funny because it's far enough away where it's not annoying to me. But I know it's fucking driving somebody up. The wall is now, right Cleo. Huh? As you go to look at me and she puts her head back down, she doesn't give a fuck. All right, so that movie, the orphan, if you haven't seen it, if he driven by any sort of bus stop or anything, it's that one that has that really cycle look, an eight year old on it and it says, uh, there's something wrong with the, what the fuck is her name? It's not ama. It's one of those old person named Emma, not Elvira. Ah, Shit. See that's how my brain works. Now I'm fucked. What the fuck is that little twats name? There is something wrong.

Speaker 6:          01:10:46       Yeah. Christ, whatever it says there's something wrong with this fucking chick. Eight year old girl with an old person's name. Alright. So you go, you watch the fucking movie. Basically, she's an orphan. This couple comes down, they want to, you know, they want to adopt a kid for some fucking reason. So they picked this girl who is dressed like she's from the 18 hundreds, and she has like a piece of thread around her throat that she won't take off and on wrists have few times people try to remove it at the orphanage and she completely freaks out, sell the whole time she's been a fucking psycho. She's trying to kill their natural kids. And um, you know, their life was basically fine and then they get this kid and everything, you know, the fucking house catches on fire, all this fucked up stuff. But one of the requirements of old school horror movies is, is you have to have unbelievably stupid people in it.

Speaker 6:          01:11:39       And um, I actually, the, the white people in this movie were so fucking dumb. I almost got offended. I almost like wrote a letter. It's like they got this giant tree fort and the dude looks, he looks out the window and the fucking thing is engulfed in flames as his natural son is hanging from the tree trying not to fall, which he does and ends up in intensive fucking care. And the fucking wife is sitting there going like, I think there's something wrong with this fucking chick with the old person named that dresses like she's in the 18 hundreds and the kicker, she has a Transylvanian accent Ivonne to play the piano. What? I can't even fucking do it. She's just, it's like you're a psycho. Get the fuck out of my life. Right? Then she starts killing people. People start disappearing right and fucking left and they're sitting there, the cub, Whoa, what's going on?

Speaker 6:          01:12:36       She's big. So we, all right. So basically in the end, what you find out, what's wrong with the girl is that she's not eight years old. She's actually 33 she has, she has some sort of disease that makes her look like she's eight and she used to be in an insane asylum because she murdered her family and she escaped somehow from Germany. She somehow escaped the insane asylum, got herself in an orphanage with no fucking passport, no paperwork whatsoever, got herself into an orphanage in America and the kicker is she somehow went to a dentist who agreed to make her a full upper and a full lower denture of children's teeth, which she pulls out in the end as you're discovering that she's 33 years old and then there's little fucking dwarf middle-age psycho cunt comes in and somehow is able to stab to death and adult I, it was just the stupidest fucking thing I was.

Speaker 6:          01:13:48       It was great. It's just a fucking, and even though I told you everything basically that happens, it's still a fucking hilarious movie. It was where it's, somebody wrote this great email to me. They were so pissed that I told him to go see the movie. They said, I've never been absolutely terrified while laughing my ass off for 90 minutes in my entire life. And that is the experience of the orphan. It's just a fucking great stupid movie. I don't know, it just reminded me how it had all the cheesy lines. She's crawling out of the pond, Mami Save, you save me. And then she's like, for the last time I'm not your fucking mother. And then she kicks her right in her fucking 33 year old, eight 58 year old face and she goes back down to the bottom of the pond. And I guess that was supposed to be the applause break, which it would have got if it was still 1984 but whatever, it's, I know as much as I just trashed it, it still a good movie.

Speaker 6:          01:14:48       I felt bad for the actor playing the dad in the movie because I just pictured him in between takes trying to figure out how he could be that guy and just looking at the director going sell basically. My character's a fucking moron, right? So in this seed, I'm still a moron who can't put one and one together and get, um, maybe, you know, cause nothing caught on fire and no woman was murdered in my house before we got the fucking chick who sounds like she's doing a Dracula impression. Maybe I could put those two fucking numbers together and guests that it's, it's Ama or Ezra or whatever the fuck her fucking name. Is this something wrong with her? The fuck is it? I have to look it up. I got to get this orphan. Let me type this in. Clear. What the fuck was that psycho chick's name. Huh? Orphan. Showtimes. Uh, you motherfucker plot words. Keys.

Speaker 8:          01:15:49       Yeah.

Speaker 6:          01:15:50       Full cast and crew. Here we go. Here we go.

Speaker 6:          01:15:56       Anyway, reason there's something wrong with Esther. Had a fuck that I forget that Esther to cause a little white girl Esther. That's it. That's an old black woman name, isn't it Esther? Was that the name of it? Was that the name of Florida Evan's character or was that the name of the, of the ugly girl on a Sanford and son? It was aunt Esther. That was, yeah. And therefore because I saw one person who was black who had that name, therefore everybody see how I do that? I like to generalize everybody cause I'm a moron. All right, let's get back to the fucking podcast here. Um,

Speaker 7:          01:16:31       here we go. Here's some youtube videos. Did you guys can watch this weekend your cubicles instead of working? All right. Um, let me see here. What do we got here? All right, so I noticed a lot of them because the first one that I nominated was really violent. Most of these youtube videos that people are nominating involve somebody getting punched in the face. Like, here's one British director slammed into a table. This is, um, Twat on Twat crime just to let you know it's female versus female and um, it has a WWF quality to it. When the lady gets slammed, she puts her arms out like the way they do when wrestlers pretend to slam their heads off a table. Um, but for all of you who don't like violence, I have a couple of Nice ones. Here's one for you. Cute puppy whistle. Look up that one and tell me that won't melt your fucking cheerios if they're meltable.

Speaker 7:          01:17:29       Um, and there's another great one. This one, Jerry needs no help playing with his ball. I know that sounds like a porno, but I swear to God it's an adorable video. Jerry needs no help playing with his ball. Just write this down on a little post. It act like you're taking notes and looking at a spreadsheet. Um, here's one for the guys, a fat kid on a bicycle. Um, I challenge you to watch this and not fucking laugh your balls off. And it's great if he just, you know what's great is after the kid falls off, if you look really closely it, what happens is, is when he goes flying over the handlebars in his fucking meatball body lands, you haven't seen anybody's played. Sports has done this. She ever get tackled in football and your arms underneath you and your fucking elbow basically goes into your spleen, up under your liver and then fucking, you know, smashes into your heart.

Speaker 7:          01:18:24       That's basically what happens to this kid. And he makes, he makes the greatest. He made you want to hear the noise? Tell you what I'll play. They'll play the audio and I'm going to test your willpower that if you can actually hear the fucking audio to this and not watch it, you're definitely, you get you have, you have some serious fucking willpower. Let me type this in real quick. Fat, there's a lot of audio on this one. I had my dog. Fuck Kid. Wait a minute. What the fuck? I just messed that up. Fair kid on a bicycle. I'm sorry I can't type with one hand. Just bear with me children. Just bear with me. Just talk amongst yourselves. Do you ever have that when you teach her was going through a divorce and she'd start breaking down. Just talk amongst yourselves. Fat Kid on a sic code. Bam. Come on. Where the fuck is it? Oh, that's great. Bill, you gave me the wrong. Maybe it's fat kid falls. Ah, you fucking asshole bill fat. I wrote fat on a bicycle. That'd be disgusting ones. There's a bag of fat. All right. Fat Kid on a bicycle and I get the same videos.

Speaker 7:          01:19:49       Fat Kid fall on a jumping on a bike. Where is his mother fucker? I'm the worst. I swear to God. It's funny. You're not gonna be able to find now I have to fuck. Oh, there it is. Kid on a bicycle. I got it. Here we go. Listen to this audio. All right, here he comes. Here he comes. Here he comes.

Speaker 10:         01:20:19       Hello. Ah,

Speaker 7:          01:20:34       oh. That's the funniest fucking thing ever. And he's got big fat thighs. He's got these little booty shorts.

Speaker 2:          01:20:43       Ah

Speaker 7:          01:20:43       God. That's a fucking great one. There's nothing better that way is, it's so funny to watch somebody get hurt. I don't know why. Anyways, here's another one, and I know this, this one has a couple of your kid's ears here, but this one is called current smasher. C U. N. T. A. Smasher. And I know that sounds like, you know somebody just give somebody an uppercut to the baby maker. That's not what happens. Believe it or not, this is actually, it's a male stripper and I swear to God, I think it's Bobby blots, sir from rat. That's what it looks like. Um, it's, you might want to fast forward through some of it, but it's just fucking, it's hilarious. Um, it's gotta be from like 1988 just judging by the guy's fucking hair metal hair and he's spinning these knives around and it's just a classic why guys are not sexy and women or guys I think turn women on if they're like doing shit, you know, you come over, you know, you're fucking the of the cable guy and you're installing cable, you know, and you bend over and you'd Dickies.

Speaker 7:          01:21:52       I don't fucking know. You know what I mean? That's how women get turned on and they see some guy with a little yellow hard hat and he's up a telephone pole. Oh my God. He can fix stuff. I want to blow him. Right. I Dunno how they find a sexy, but I know it's not wearing a fucking leather jumpsuit spinning around kitchen knives. That really, I dunno, but you got to watch it. That's what, that's a great one. Um, and these are all recommended by people, by the way, other than fat kid on a bike. That's one of my favorite ones. Um, gay weatherman is a grace w great one. Uh, there's another one, worst blooper ever. And uh, then there's another good one, a British punch. Just look that up at some British dude who gets punched in the face. And his reaction is, um, stereotypical British where it's just really polite.

Speaker 7:          01:22:43       Where'd you go and do something like that? I came out to fuck he did. The guy gets punched in the face and he doesn't attack the other kid. He doesn't laugh. Hey, why did you go? I came with the F. I can't do fucking accents. I don't even know why. Check those out instead of working. That's what you can do this week. All right. Um, or if he gets sick of working. What are we up to here? 40 minutes. All right. I gotta wrap up. I have some, I have a computer question for you people. All right. I have a, I have the Mac book now. All the nerds are listening up. Alright. Perk in their ears up. I have a brand new Mac book brand. By brand new, I mean nonetheless, like fucking four months or whatever. And I got that thing where, you know, if I put my hand on the little square thing down there that I don't know what it's called.

Speaker 7:          01:23:27       You know the mousy area. I know if I, if I flick the cursor to the upper right hand, all the windows disappear. If I go down to the lower right, they separate, upper left makes it go black, lower left, uh, makes the four windows and you know, we can have something in all four windows. Um, but my question is, is what? I don't know how I do this, but every once in a while I do something on the mouse area accidentally. And what happens is, is I'll have two windows open and when I click on one of the windows, the other window goes exit stage right off of my thing. And then if I click the other one, then the, then it comes back while the other one goes exit stage left. And sometimes I want to look at both fucking windows. How do I make it stop doing that?

Speaker 7:          01:24:16       So I guess I want to know how do I make it do that and then how do I make it stop doing that because I want to stop yelling at my computer like it's a person. I hope I explained that correctly. And with that, let's move on to a revenge story. Remember that topic? All those great stories. Remember how like everybody had his story, uh, how they, you know, how you got revenge was basically you didn't confront the person. You basically fucked up some of their personal property and a lot of people sort of came to the conclusion that that really wasn't revenge as much as it was sort of a bitchy little move where here's a great revenge story done by a guy. This is a fucking great story. I wish I lived this story. All right, here we go. I grew up in Brooklyn, New York.

Speaker 7:          01:24:56       Uh, many years ago when I was in the sixth grade, I was 11 years old. There was a guy named PJ used to torment me all the time. He bullied me, bully me, and robbed me of my money. Every time he saw me. This lasted for about four years. As I became a teenager, he stopped trying to rob me, but he was, he still tried to intimidate me every chance he got. So one day in the summer we were playing five on five basketball and there was about 40 guys standing all around the court watching the game. I got the ball on a steel and the only guy back on defense was PJ. As I drove to the hoop, he jumped to block my shot and I dunked right in his face. The whole park exploded. Guys were running to the court yelling and laughing at PJ's.

Speaker 7:          01:25:39       Pj, the screams were so loud. My friends who lived a block away heard the noise and came running to the park to see what happened. The look on PJ's face was priceless. He was humiliated in front of just about everybody we mutually knew at that time. Um, I went on to play Division One college ball and had success, but nothing ever compared to that day. I remember like it was yesterday and it happened over 20 years ago. He never spoke or bothered me ever again after that day either though. That story is the shit, you know. Can you imagine Dunkin on some asshole is treating me like shit. You know what I thought it was and I'm going to go out on a limb here and get, you know at the risk of being called a racist again. I'm going to guess that that was a black guy.

Speaker 7:          01:26:25       Not too many white guys have a story of Holly got revenge, was they fucking stole a ball. Somebody jumped up to block their shot and they basically jumped over him and dunked on him. You know, I dunno. Maybe, I dunno. I'm just saying right. I mean I, I was in my white brain, what I was thinking was everyone was there at the basketball game and you're going to do the meatballs thing and pulled down his shorts. See that's what you have to do when you can't jump when you don't have that fucking option. Cause I don't care how many fucking, how many whatever, jump shots you throw him in somebody's face. It's not the same. It's not the same. That's like you just fucking attacked.

Speaker 4:          01:27:05       Okay.

Speaker 7:          01:27:05       I mean, I dunno. Getting dunked on, I mean that's, that's right up there with just sleep. She minds was just slapped his mother right in his face. I think that's fantastic. That's what I want to nominate. That is, that's the one of the best revenge stories ever because it wasn't sneaky. It wasn't bitchy. It was right in the dude's face and a, and it had the desired effect. The guy never fucked with them again. And I'm going to go out on a limb and say that this dude had the last laugh. So congratulations. Jesus Christ. That should be like one of those afterschool special movies. It really had a feel good ending to it and nobody really got hurt. So he just got put in their place. They should fucking film that story and play it around the holidays just to make people feel better. All right, let's get with questions here. Um, hey bill, I am, I'm a big fan of your comedy. We bitty, bitty, bitty. Thank you very much. Uh, I was looking for a,

Speaker 7:          01:27:58       what the fuck? I was looking to get some tickets to the DC improv show on October. Is curious about your thoughts. Oh, I was curious about your thoughts on the difference between the early and the late shows. I know when you're a pro you can kill whether it's the first, second or second show on any given night, but I was just wondering which performance do you prefer and why? And is the law the single show on Sunday, the most depressing Gig of the rung of the run. All right. You know, you, believe it or not, I get asked this question a lot of times when people go, hey man, I'm buying tickets to your show. I'm coming Friday. Which one do you think I should go to? The early one of the late one. And the reality is, um,

Speaker 7:          01:28:39       you never know. You never know. Like this past weekend I was working the comedy connection in Providence and I had great shows, but that one went the standard way where the early crowd was more sober and more receptive and the lay crowd was, uh, sort of drunk and not paying attention. Well, one of the nights it on the Friday night, it was like the red sox and Yankees were playing and I guess they went 13 innings or something like that. It was into extra innings. So half of the crowd they're face is glowing by half the crowd. I mean five fucking people, but that feels like half to crop. Their face is glowing because they're watching the pitch by pitch. Um, I mean who the fuck is into sports to that level? You know what I mean? Breaking ball outside till it, but you know, you're gonna fucking end and you don't even have that guy saying that.

Speaker 7:          01:29:32       But what happened? They were watching that shit but then you know what the fuck, but whatever. So they weren't paying attention. So the second show kind of sucked on that one. But um, when I was in Denver, I had a show where the early show they would drunk maniacs yelling out shit. It was still fun. Um, so yeah, dude, it's a crap shoot just like you. I have no idea either and I just sort of play off. Well, however people are doing it. But I got to admit, I ever, I have a really good crowd of people that comes out. And even when people yell shit out at me, like I'm, I don't like if someone's just trying to be a dick. But if I say something, someone has an opinion on it and they yell it out, you know, as long as it isn't every five seconds, like that really doesn't bother me.

Speaker 7:          01:30:13       I actually think it's one of the things that makes stand up a cool art that uh, you know, it's one of the few like public speaking things where like you, it's kind of accepted in a way that you can just yell, hey, you fucking suck. You know? I mean it happens to bands and that type of shit, but she can drown them out with your instruments. I Dunno. I Dunno. Fuck. I mean, you know, I'm basically, this is the only thing I've done in public, so I really don't know what the fuck I'm talking about. Um, let's move off to fucking listen. I want to say there was something about provenance. I wanted her to say, well that's out of my head now. Um, okay. This is how we've been ending a lot of these podcasts lately where all of a sudden people are sending me these really, uh, heavier questions.

Speaker 7:          01:31:00       This is sort of the, uh, the doctor bill section I think is what I'm going to call it because I'm not qualified no, that I'm not qualified to answer any of this shit. But, uh, this is another one of these death of a relative thing. So, uh, after we had the feel good story, God dammit, I should've read the revenge one after this one. But, uh, this one is sort of depressing, but not, not, I'm just going to shut up and read it. Okay. Bill, my bill, my mom's oldest sister died from cancer three weeks ago and wow. What an opening sentence and has one surviving sister, um, during the process of going through her things. All right, so let's slow down here because this gets confusing. So you have a mom and she had a sister die and she has one other surviving sisters.

Speaker 7:          01:31:46       So it's your mom and your aunt who's alive at this point and your other aunt died or aunt, whatever the fuck you from. Um, during the process or going through her things and settling her affairs. Quite a few interesting secrets have popped up for one. We thought my aunt never owned a car, but have since found out that she owned several over the last 20 years. Sounds like the beginning of one of those a and e murder things. They thought she was quiet. It didn't have any carers. Um, for second, um, we always thought after two divorces that she had sworn off men. Turns out, um, this gave her license to sample both sides of the fence. Any race we're fucking above. We were about chest deep and, and this one already, four sentences in, have I forgotten to mention that she was an avid collector of books.

Speaker 7:          01:32:36       Some might call it a obsessive compulsive. Needless to say, I have cited with OCD because she has five over 5,000 books in a one bedroom condo on the lake front here in Chicago. We have found college era photos of her half naked with a cigarette in one hand in various background items that would suggest early seventies era. Uh, mostly because the gigantic stereos with turntables and eight track slot. So, okay. Um, through this process, my mom's middle sister, I guess this is the surviving one and her two kids and families have distanced themselves from the, this estate settling process. While my mom and I have spent 80 plus man hours going through the Condo, my middle aunt and her family have consistently talked about how busy they are.

Speaker 2:          01:33:28       Uh,

Speaker 7:          01:33:29       um, and that they have all but said, we don't care how much you've done. And I, dude, you were a little vague here. Are they getting stuff from the will? I was a little confused with that. Um, but anyways, I realize, um,

Speaker 7:          01:33:44       there was a very complex set of emotions going on here. Perhaps their show of indifference is because they feel guilty about not seeing my dead aunt when she was alive. Perhaps they live in a nearly perfect world and don't want to be bothered. Perhaps they are unfeeling jackasses and don't care. It's hard to judge. I really want to tell them to go fuck themselves. And several, several contact with them once and for all, once the will is paid out. Okay. So evidently I get it. So they're entitled to some Shit and they're not helping out. Uh, but they are family and I was brought to respect family while they apparently were not, it pains me to know that they are blood relatives and that their mindset is indicative of my middle Anse upbringing of them.

Speaker 2:          01:34:26       MMM.

Speaker 7:          01:34:27       I guess that's just surviving aunt. Um, I feel loss and sorrow for losing my aunt to cat cancer, but I also feel loss and sorrow about losing my other aunt and her kids and families because they are not who I thought they were. Any advice you could give would be great. Add Dude, I don't know what to tell you.

Speaker 2:          01:34:44       MMM.

Speaker 7:          01:34:45       Yeah. It's fucked up that they're going to get some money out of this shit and they're not helping you go through her stuff.

Speaker 2:          01:34:51       MMM.

Speaker 7:          01:34:54       But, uh, I dunno dude. How often do you see these?

Speaker 4:          01:34:58       Yeah.

Speaker 7:          01:34:59       You know, I dunno, I kind of draw the line at your immediate family. If he's talking about aunts and cousins and that type of shit, if they're assholes, they're really, you know, like you ever think of how barely your cousins are part of your family tree? I mean, you basically have to go up the tree and then back down the tree, two limbs to get to him. So fuck them. They're out right now. Really held my cousins don't listen to this podcast and then your aunt. I mean, I dunno. I Dunno. It's, it's your aunt. Fuck them. Fuck them. Go with you got fuck them. Clear out the mortgage and then uh, yeah, fuck them.

Speaker 7:          01:35:43       I mean they sound, I mean, the way you've talked about on the kind of sound like assholes. I mean, what do you want to debate their house smells to the way you've described them. You want to go over into this smelly house, you know, to watch the Billy Bass that they bought with your dead ants. Money. Fuck them. Go with your gut. Fuck them. You know, at some point you, you, you could, I don't know. Do you want to have that confrontation? Yeah, I think the only weird thing of the cousins is not a weird thing. I don't think the fact that they're not involved is, is a weird thing because a lot of times, you know, people could be really separated. But like the weird thing is your aunt not giving a shit that your other aunt died because their sisters, that's just fucking bizarre to me. But, uh, who knows? Maybe a dead ant did something to her. He didn't know that she had 20 fucking cars. Maybe you should keep sifting through the pictures and uh, maybe you'll discover something. I don't know what, I don't know what, but I dunno what do that advice sucked. Okay. I'm not qualified for a

Speaker 4:          01:36:45       yeah.

Speaker 7:          01:36:45       You know, I don't know that level of stuff, but feel free to keep sending me stuff like that cause it must be fun to listen to me a squirm. Speaking of that. Um, here's some shit about, uh, you know, something, somebody sent me something great about banks trying to help me explain what the fuck I was trying to say last week, but really couldn't explain it in an intelligent way. And I lost the email because I, I didn't have any internet over the weekend and I had it on my blackberry. I got rid of it. But basically this guy was touching on some shit that I had heard before. That basically when you, if you take a thousand of your own dollars and you put it in a bank, believe it or not, the bank can legally loan that thousand dollars out to like nine different people. I don't mean nine people get a portion that totals up to a thousand. I mean nine people can get $1,000 loan off of the thousand dollars that you put in. So if you're sitting there going, well then didn't they just invent, um, $8,000 they just created out of thin air?

Speaker 4:          01:37:58       Yeah.

Speaker 7:          01:37:59       And um, I don't know if that's why our money really has no value. They just created out of thin air. And this guy was basically explaining that one of the reasons our money has value is basically the person who takes the loan, them promising to pay it back, gives it value. But uh, I dunno, I have no idea. I wish that there was some sort of uh,

Speaker 4:          01:38:28       yeah,

Speaker 7:          01:38:29       like home kit where you could make your own bank. You know what I mean? The same way people make their own fucking beer in the bathtub or they make lemonade this, you know, that'd be a great fight. Billy Mays was still alive. He could sell that shit. You know, I'm Billy Mays. Are you sick of putting your money in the banks and having a loan out to a budget? Can't you don't even pay it back. So then you fucking lose Hedrick. Dozy your own personal baggage. He basically showed you how to convert your garage into a brick. Fucking, I dunno what have some homeless guy that would be your security. You just have some homeless guy that smells so fucking bad. You know, granted all your money would smell, but like no one would go near. I don't know what. I don't know what to tell you, but I, I feel like an idiot every week taking my money and then putting it into a bank, but there's no other fucking options,

Speaker 4:          01:39:18       you know,

Speaker 7:          01:39:19       short of sticking it in my mattress,

Speaker 7:          01:39:23       you know, and then you make yourself a target, you know, hey, you see that skinny red at over there. It doesn't know how to fight a, he's got a fucking thousand dollars in his pillowcase. Hey guys. Hey, you want to play Frisbee? Let's get blasted in the face and not only am I out 1000 bucks, I ought to buy a new pillow because I noticed that's one thing about when people steal, they have to ruin your place too. They have to ransack it. They can't just reach into your pillow. It's wide open. Just reach in and take it. Not how I got to rip it off and fucking stab it up.

Speaker 4:          01:39:55       You know

Speaker 7:          01:39:57       something about putting on a cat suit that makes people extra destructive. All right. Anyways, that's the podcast for this week. I hope to see you guys out at my show. I am getting geared up for my special, I'm not drinking, I'm not boozing, so please don't tempt me when I'm out there, but if you want to show me your tits, that is fine and I will happily sign them. See, there's a balance to my life also. Um, please try to cut. If you're anywhere near Ontario, California, please come out to my show out there. I would really love to sell a bunch of tickets out there because, um, I don't have much of a presence here in the lower California area. I don't have anything in San Diego. I got nothing going on in the greater la area and I usually don't plead with people to this level to come to my shows, but I am right now. All right. I'm like fucking what's his face and that, that fucking Miller's crossing. Look into your heart. Look into you John. Turturro. What a great fucking movie that is. I finally saw that one the other day. Wasn't that a great, you guys want to hear cleo getting scratched one more time to hear what fucking ecstasy sounds like. No, I she won't do it. Here we go.

Speaker 8:          01:41:03       Yeah,

Speaker 7:          01:41:13       there you go. That wasn't as good as yellow ones. Whatever. Go Fuck Yourself. This is life. That's how it goes. All right. Now let me know how this works out. Is it a smaller file and all that type of shit? You guys have a good week and a, I will talk to you next Monday, although it will be a little bit later cause I am flying back from, from Atlanta on, uh, on Monday. So there you go.
