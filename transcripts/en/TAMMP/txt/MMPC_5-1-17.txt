Speaker 1:          00:00:01       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:00:02       Hey, what's going on? Is Bill Burn? It's time for the Monday morning podcast for Monday, May 1st, 2017 what's going on? How

Speaker 1:          00:00:12       you liked that echo? I am in my garage.

Speaker 2:          00:00:17       This is what it's come down to. It's like fucking a quarter to seven or 10 and seven in the morning. I got to go to the airport. My lovely daughter was sleeping. My wife is sleeping. There is no place in the house, so me to scream and yell. So I'm out here in the garage and oh by the way, in less than a mile, but an hour around eight o'clock.

Speaker 1:          00:00:36       There's people coming to my house cause I'm,

Speaker 2:          00:00:39       well, you know the gas line is, I dunno, 96 years fucking old.

Speaker 1:          00:00:46       It needs to be replaced because it's leaking all over the goddamn place. Um, that's always fun to have a baby in your hands. You set it down towards the floor and he kept to say things DYF like, um, do you smell gas? So I'm getting that taken care of today and uh, this is it. This is where my life is at. So I'm sitting here on my workout bench that uh, I can't use cause I fucked up my shoulder. It's gradually getting better. This is the longest, most nagging fucking injury ever to try to heal. But I'm almost there and um, this is how I'm going to do with people. This is how I'm going to celebrate. This is the 10 year anniversary of the Monday morning podcast. Can you believe that for 10 years I have been yapping to myself, you know, 10 years.

Speaker 1:          00:01:36       I have not been reading 10 years. I had been making up shit for 10 years. I've been saying shit that I thought was true cause I heard somebody say it in an airport. I've been doing that for 10 years. Um, I want to thank everybody who's been listening and I'm going to put a link to a post, whatever the fuck you guys say. It's, it's a thing that you click on and then it goes to the video that you want to watch. What will be the, um, the first Monday morning podcast ever, which I believe was about 90 seconds long. I'll give you a little history. I was over a Robert Kelly's apartment back. We still live right around the corner of each other when I was still living in New York City and it was over his house and he was just, you know, it was typical Bob. He was just like, hey, you should do a podcast gig. This isn't to May of 2007 one of the few things I've ever been at the beginning of podcasting and getting a special on Netflix. Those are the two things I was at the front. Like I remember,

Speaker 2:          00:02:39       you know, for my intro and comedy clubs, I would say a, they like, what do you want to say? Oh, say he's been on this, he's been on that. And you can see he might've seen his specials on Netflix and the host would say it and people would snicker.

Speaker 1:          00:02:52       Yeah,

Speaker 2:          00:02:52       they'd laugh in the crowd. They'd laugh at that credit. Well now look at it. Huh? Look at the feed the fucking world dominating.

Speaker 1:          00:03:01       You know these oil companies now to look at Netflix like, God damn, how the fuck did you do that without firing a shot? How the fuck did you do that? Right. So Netflix, Netflix, and podcasting, you know, if I was, if I was on a, an oil company, I would, uh, I said I would do, I would start coming up with some original content, you know what I mean? And just make the show so amazing, you know, that the stars would then go over to those countries and while everybody was fawning over the cast of the reboot of friends, I would then run around the corner and I would start stealing their oil. That's, that's how I would do it. You know, it's a lot less messy. You don't, there's excitement. Am I going to get caught? Right?

Speaker 3:          00:03:44       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:03:45       Um, anyways, back in the day, so I'm over Brava Kelly's apartment. He's like,

Speaker 4:          00:03:49       did he, you should do a podcast.

Speaker 1:          00:03:53       And I was like, what is a, what does a podcast

Speaker 4:          00:03:56       [inaudible] recording? It's another way to connect with your fears. Do, who knows?

Speaker 3:          00:04:04       Okay.

Speaker 4:          00:04:05       Now people listen to it. You do in the stress factory Tuesday to Sunday, dude.

Speaker 1:          00:04:13       And I'm literally just fucking around on it. And I actually, I called it, if you listen to my first podcast, he listened to the link. I actually said it. I said, ah, this is my podcast. I was basically repeating everything that Bobby was kinda yelling to me in the background. And um, and I called it, I said a and who knows, maybe this might lead to something mediocre. And you know what, it took me to taking me 10 years, but God damn it, I got there. Here I am sitting here and my fucking garage. This is not some sort of cool reverb that you listening to. This is me and my garage. Um, you know what's amazing though is I gotta tell you something. I don't know what it is. It's, I'm such a cliched guy. I fucking love the garage. The garage is the shit.

Speaker 1:          00:05:00       You know what I mean? It takes you back to being a single man when you barely had anything. Cause I have one of those fucking garages. By the way, I was not going to be the person that had the garage. Right. That like you. Yeah. Bye. Shit. And there's no more room for this shit in your house. And then you take some other shit that you used to like and you stick it in a box and then you stick it in the garage, right and gradually starts encroaching on the car and next thing you know, the car can't be in there and it just fucking fills all the way up. Well, you know what you're doing. You're slowly becoming a fucking hoarder. That's one of the saddest things. I actually, you know, I came at and understand whether it's sad or whether it's, um, you just taking responsibility for, for all the shit that you buy in your life. You know, I guess anybody could take it down to goodwill. Anybody can throw it in the trash take to the dump. It takes a real caring human being, a real caring human being to just sit there and [inaudible] and all that fucking shit. You bought your entire life. Every fucking newspaper, every tube of toothpaste, just sitting them suffocating in your own fucking carbon footprint.

Speaker 1:          00:06:23       You know, I just realized, you know, we shouldn't be looking down at hoarders. We should be looking at these people going like, Holy Shit, one human being, one human being can buy all of that shit and alive. It's not even a lifetime. They still live in, you know, you can have that many pets, fucking fish tags, newspapers and all of that crap. Um, I dunno, I would happen. I'm sitting there looking over right now. You know, my neat little fucking garage. I got like two different rooms. I got this old fucking mop. I don't even know where that thing came from. I think it came with the house, you know?

Speaker 3:          00:07:01       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:07:02       And I've been meaning to throw that thing up. Where does it end up?

Speaker 3:          00:07:06       Huh?

Speaker 1:          00:07:09       Fucking in some beavers house. Some stupid mop handles sticking through his little sucking thatch of a roof. All those things fast. By the way. I get those giant Goddamn teeth. Fucking horse teeth, dude. It's so they can cut through the back dude. Anyways, so it's been 10 years in. Um, I'm actually, you know, I had people on Twitter send in some of their favorite moments, which I'll be reading later if I could somehow get this fucking computer to work while I'm out here. Um, yeah. So anyways, let's get on with the podcast. So I didn't know if I even said it. Thank you guys for listening. Uh, throughout the years. Thank you to everybody who's booth advertised on the podcast, whether you liked the read or you didn't, whether you got upset and said that I'm never going to advertise again. Whatever it was, it was fun.

Speaker 1:          00:07:58       A lot of fun. So here's to the next 10 years, I'm still not going to read, right. I Dunno. Whatever. You know what I liked though? I'm a buck 76 right now. I do like that the way 176 pounds. So roughly the fucking way there was, I was probably a few pounds lighter, but I got to get down to it. I got to get down the end of the month, next month, my birthday, I want to be like one 71 71. Right. And you know what? I get down to that way. I get down to that way. Guess what? Then I'll be happy. Ah. Then it will fill the void. You know when I go on, I put my little fucking tiger woods golf shirt on even though I don't fucking golf.

Speaker 3:          00:08:36       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:08:38       Anyways. Is that fucking guy ever going to win another tournament? It really bugs me. Really fucking bothers me that there's a bunch of broads out there that think the reason why he never want to another fucking tournament was because of the bullshit of his personal life. Give me a fucking break. His body broke down. That's what the fuck happened. This guy's a champion.

Speaker 2:          00:08:56       Do you understand what the champion could do? Champion can block anything out. If you see these guys going up trying to get the fucking free throws, everybody just waving their hands, screaming a bunch of shit about the guy's wife. What does he do? Nothing but net. Nothing but fucking net. You know, sky can't handle. A little spat gets hit with a golf club. He jumps in his Escalade and he hits a fucking Rose Bush and all of a sudden, all of that talent goes away. I don't know. I don't buy it. I think the, and I think the reason why some women, some women look at me being a little measured in the next 10 years. Some women, the reason why I think they attributed to that is because I, you know, I think that they want to buy into that whole fucking thing. He's behind the like, man is a good woman.

Speaker 2:          00:09:42       You know what I mean? Which is so fucking stupid, right? Obviously if you have a happy fucking marriage, your life's going to be all right. But that's just another fucking, you know, everybody's always stealing credit. Are we set up as a Hollywood thing until you get into a relationship and it's, everybody's fucking sits there. Oh, now I'm laying down. There you go. Now the back's better. Now. The fucking back's better. I don't even want to talk about, um, to anybody wants a formula one race from Sochi in, uh, in Russia. It's such a weird name. So cheap. That sounds like a more like a, like a Chinese or Japanese. Vietnamese. So cheap. That does not sound like Russian dark evil. [inaudible] so ci, that sounds too happy to be Russian, but I have to tell you it was a fucking, that's a what? A gorgeous city that is.

Speaker 2:          00:10:33       Huh? You know what I mean? I mean, Russia scares the shit out of me. I grew up during the end of the Cold War, so I just figured you're going to go over there and the second, if you have any sort of a, I dunno, American Shit on, it's just, you know, I remember being in Finland being in this cap and it blew my mind how close I was to Russia. It's like, well I can't believe I'm this, you know, Far East into Europe. And I asked the guy if he'd ever been there and he started telling me about Moscow. It was, you know, a little dangerous after five, you know, and I'm deciding, I just did the math in my head. It's like, all right, this guy's saying it's a little dangerous. Finland beat Russia, Finland defeated fucking style. Okay. Style. And whose those fucking people ran over the Goddamn Nazi army with their Mercedes Benz fucking tanks. Right? The portion jeeps, I can't name one fucking Russian car. All right. Just the sheer will and toughness of those people, you know? Yeah. We read those stories and them fucking, they're running around in their socks in the middle of a Russian winter just running the fucking German army. Right back to Jeremy. You know? Or where else would the German people go back to? Well, I could have retreated back to Poland. God knows they fucking took that over, right?

Speaker 3:          00:11:58       Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:11:58       So I'm thinking, you know,

Speaker 3:          00:12:01       okay,

Speaker 2:          00:12:02       take a beat. These guys, Jesus Christ. What, how the fuck would they lose to Finland? You know, that's the championship match right there. That's Cleveland versus the warriors. Finland. I mean, I was looking at them like, all right, that's the fucking warriors verse. I Dunno the Phoenix Suns, but the, uh,

Speaker 3:          00:12:22       okay.

Speaker 2:          00:12:22       I Dunno, they fucking be the fucking kick their ass. But what sucked for them was at the end of the war when Germany lost, Italy fell and all that shit, when the axis powers loss, they were on the wrong side of the fucking table. So they went down with them. It was like a co op, you know what I mean? Like if you pay off your shares in the building, you're like, all right, I own my apartment. It's like, no you don't. You won't shares in this building. But if everybody else goes belly up, the whole fucking thing is done and then you lose your shares. You have to go back to renting your apartment or you have to fucking leave. That's what it was like. And that's what happened to them. They paid off their shares in the building in Italy and Germany went fucking bankrupt. And uh, next thing you know, that was it.

Speaker 2:          00:13:03       And they had the giveaways, like the southern part of their fucking country or some shit there to give away. Basically the stadium in which they won the game, they had to give that to them. I'm pretty sure that's what the fuck happened. So when he was subsequently go, and this is the, this is the DNA that this guy comes from and he's telling me that after five it gets a little fucking scary. These are the people that fucking, you know, looked old, Yosef Stalin in the fucking ice, you know, fucking kicked his ass. He be like around fucking cross country skis, cross country ski CPT sons of bitches and this guy's nervous. So it's just like wow,

Speaker 2:          00:13:40       it's gotta be a scary fucking place over there. And then I'm watching the f one race on some ci right. And it was fucking beautiful. It looked like a Ron Howard film starring Tom Hanks. You know, you had a beautiful city in the background. You had, you went into a forest and you had mountains, a little snow caps on top of it. It looked like a postcard. Like when they take a postcard of Los Angeles, you know, like once a year it's clear enough where you could take a picture of the downtown La Skyline and then see snow capped mountains in the background. Right. Cause they always say that, you know, you can snowboard in the morning and be surfing in the afternoon. And if you're in La, you're looking around going, where the fucking you snowboard. It's cause you can't see, he can see through all the fucking pollution. Um, so anyway, so I'm watching this goddamn race from Sochi, right?

Speaker 3:          00:14:35       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:14:35       And um, I got to tell you, F one f one figured it out so far. Four races in another really exciting race.

Speaker 3:          00:14:46       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:14:46       I don't know what happened. They made the tires 30% bigger and all of a sudden there's more fucking grip. The Dad would force all this shit that they talk about and it before every frigging race, I don't know what happened, but all I know and friary made better cars. Now all of a sudden it's a, at least she got two teams race and Ford is supposed to last year or was just a Nico and, uh, Lewis Hamilton. So anyways, congratulations. I hope I say, speaking of Finland, oh by say this guy's name, right? Mercedes Benz, a tier two driver, the upstart, the Tom Cruise and days of thunder, right? Uh, vault Valtteri bolt us. I hope I said that right. And he's like one of like nine finished drivers to everyone. A Formula One race. It congratulations him drove great race. Uh, Sebastian Vettel from Ferrari, second place, Kimi Raikkonen broken in Sydney is raking in Kimmy. So Cheeky Kimmy, Kimchi, Kimmy Reagan and for Ferrari came in third and then Lewis Hamilton came and forth. I can tell you right now, he wasn't happy. You know, he wasn't happy. That guy doesn't give a fuck if his car doesn't work. He doesn't get, he'll fucking run his own teammate off the fucking track.

Speaker 2:          00:16:01       That's what I, a little I know about that race. All I know is if he's not winning and his teammate can, when he doesn't give a fuck, he's not getting out of the way. You know, he just doesn't give a shit. Um, but then he also wins. So whatever. Uh, so I guess that puts, uh, the fuck's his name. I was fucking up. Sebastian Vettel isn't first place he's got, I think he's got two wins and two second places. So you get 25, 25, 18 and 18. So that's 50 and 3,686 points. And I think, uh, you know, I'm in the garage, dude. I don't know the fucking internet as far as I remember. I think Lewis Hamilton has one victory, two second places and a fourth.

Speaker 5:          00:16:44       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:16:45       So that's 25, 18 and 18. Oh Jesus Christ was at 61 36 and 25 slash 61 I'm going to say at 61 and he's got a fourth place. When you give for fourth place, like 15. I don't know. He's got like, I dunno, we'll say 76 some shit. I don't fucking know. All I know is it shaping up to be a great year and for whatever reason, even though I have German blood in me, uh, no Italian blood. I actually, I'm rooting for the fryer. It's just because last year was it got boring Mercedes one every fucking race. So it's good to see Ferrari back. Um, and by, by the way, shout out to force India.

Speaker 5:          00:17:23       Yeah,

Speaker 2:          00:17:23       I think they came in eighth and ninth. I was sixth and seventh. My fault for having the balls. They have pink cars out there or Fuchsia, whatever you want to call them.

Speaker 5:          00:17:32       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:17:32       You know, they'd been Mike, my uh, my other team like I want to see one of them win a race this year. I want to see a pink car when a fucking race. It's just funny to me. So anyways, I don't know where the next race is.

Speaker 1:          00:17:50       I would look it up. Usually if I'm not fucking laying on the floor of my God damned garage, I would know where the next uh, the next race was. I know there's probably a lot of you going like, Bill, what the fuck you getting into his, first of all, it's a great fucking sport. Second of law, it doesn't take a lot of time to watch. There was 52 laps. It's it, you can very easily add debt, you know, to whatever sports you watch. And I'm telling you even during the NBA and the NHL playoffs, cause I fucking watched everything. You know, I watched the Saint Louis Blues right this weekend. Watch them win and over time game to believe it was game two. I watch so much shit this weekend I watched, uh, the last two games, Anaheim versus Edmonton. Um, amazing to see Edmonton like all of a sudden looking like, wait a minute, these guys are going to be the western conference champions, the way they are applying and all of a sudden they get the old right there.

Speaker 1:          00:18:42       Fred from the fucking ducks in Edmonton, one of those weird series where the three games in and the home team has yet to win a lot of children going home crying during that series so far. And um, I hate to say this is a Bruins fan, but fucking Lou Cheech, he looks right in that uniform and I got to feel, and he's going to stay there for awhile. I don't know what kind of contract he's, I don't know, signed up there, but um, Jesus Christ, he's looking like the old blue cheese just to fucking force in nature. I remember he would like fucking bring it over the Blue Line and he sorta had control of it, but he didn't. And he sort of just be kicking it in and she wants somebody else's trying to like fucking stop them. You just give him a little fucking forearm. The guy would fall down, he'd pass it over version running score out.

Speaker 1:          00:19:27       And she's, I miss those days. Anyways. Uh, but watching that, of course I watched the Celtics fucking wizards. Ah, the old sports rivalry that most of the sports world does not realize is a fucking rivalry. These two teams hate each other, but you know the deal, it's all about the fucking golden state warriors. It's all about the Cleveland Cavaliers. And, um, so no one's really paying attention, right? No one's paying attention to these two fucking people. They know. It'd be like, you know, you've got the rolling stones and the Beatles and everybody says, oh my God, they're fucking amazing. And then meanwhile, Herman in the hermit's doesn't get along with the fucking partridge family. I don't think we're that bad.

Speaker 2:          00:20:09       I'd like to think that we're not that bad. But, um, anyways, so the first,

Speaker 1:          00:20:15       like if to give you a little bit of a background for whatever stupid reason, earlier this season, the wizards were like, we're going to dress all in black when we play you guys, cause it's going to be, it's going to be like a funeral. And I was like, Oh, J g h is that what you're going to do? And then what are we going to do now?

Speaker 2:          00:20:33       Try, are you going to try extra, not extra hard tonight? Fucking wizards, right? So even with that stupid little fashion that they made,

Speaker 1:          00:20:48       they still beat us. So, but not because they were black. They beat us because they scored more points. So anyways, so we're getting ready to go see them. Uh, we're getting ready to play them. And um, my buddy Josh, Adam Meyers from the goddamn comedy jam and from the comedy jam, they had to clean it up on a comedy central. We decided that we're going to go down to a cigar bar and we're going to watch the fucking game together. He's a big wizards fan and a, and he's a, she's a Shit Talker, right? So He's been talking shit, you know, cause I think they won the, uh, I think we beat them like once and they beat us like three times. I can't even remember. And he was talking all this shit and at one point they were ahead of us in like the rankings. They were number two, we went up a three or something like that. He was just talking all of this fucking shit. So the game starts to Goldbar bar doesn't open till 11 games.

Speaker 2:          00:21:39       It comes on at 10. So I'm sitting there watching the fucking first quarter they go up to, to nothing. Dennis, five to nothing. Seven and nothing. Nine to nothing. Fucking 12 to 16 and nothing in case you missed the game, you don't have fucking sports center or whatever. 16 to fucking nothing.

Speaker 5:          00:21:57       Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:21:57       To start the game, the game, it's over. If it's any sort of illegitimates I will legitimate sport. This game is over and I gotta be, I gotta be honest with you. I will never like 100% be able to believe that that basketball is not fixed.

Speaker 1:          00:22:15       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:22:15       I don't understand it. I don't understand how one team can spot another team's 16 points. You end the first quarter one teams on pace to score 120 points or some shit. And the other teams on pace to score 20 Ah, like 75 or some shit. Right.

Speaker 1:          00:22:33       Or whatever. 80 points or something. And some I just, it's always, it's a gable runs. Then out of nowhere they started like 16 to nothing and then we go on like a fucking 25 to eight runs and somehow the score's tied. Oh, we're up by like two what the half? I don't know. I went, I drove to pick him up and then we went over to the cigar bar. So there's a lot of Chit chat going on and by the end of the third quarter we were up by 15

Speaker 5:          00:23:04       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:23:04       We were down 16 nothing. 36 minutes of basketball later were up by 15 a 31 point fucking turnaround.

Speaker 5:          00:23:14       Okay,

Speaker 1:          00:23:14       thank you man. When the bills came back against the Houston Oilers, this basically that, that happens just about every other game in the NBA. I don't fucking get it. Well, it's a game of runs. It's a game. Is it? How does one team come out? Ice fucking cold. The other team can't miss. And then like,

Speaker 5:          00:23:35       okay,

Speaker 1:          00:23:36       like I've never had a set where I go on stage and it's just like I'm on and then all of a sudden I'm off and then I'm on again and then I'm off. That's what happens. Basketball. So we're up by 50 Josh is losing his fucking mind. He standing up, he's pacing, which is hilarious because it's a cigar bar is supposed to be like totally Chili's fucking pacing back and forth. He's slamming down fucking slices of pizza, you know like doing like stress eating and I'm just laughing. I was just going like Josh, it's the fucking NBA. This game's going to be like, now we're going to do the fourth quarter. And because the third quarter ended, the switch gets shut off and the other one gets flipped on and do what is going to be at fucking tie game. So what happens? Fourth quarter starts, the fucking Celtics can't score a bucket for like the first four minutes. And next thing you know, like the wizard to down by three and Josh Joshua sitting down again and I'm just laughing. It's like, how many fucking NBA Games do you have to watch?

Speaker 1:          00:24:35       Which you really do if you just want it, if you really get into the games and you feel like you're going to fucking die a thousand deaths, what you should really do is just watched the last two minutes. God knows that takes as much time as the first fucking 46 minutes. Just watched the last two minutes because it's going to be like a fucking three point game anyways. And, um, whatever the ebb and flow and then some other Celtics pulled away again. But, uh, I gotta tell you it's going to be a fucking brutal series [inaudible] series. And I think a Jae Crowder might get kicked out for one game. This can be some sort of physical altercation. I don't know what's going to happen, but looking into my fucking crystal ball, I don't know who it's going to be, but somebody's going to get fucking kicked out of the game.

Speaker 1:          00:25:16       Uh, get suspended for a game because he's fucking teams hate each other. And, um, you already started to see it happen a little bit in the first game. I just, they just don't like each other, but I gotta tell you some, I actually love that John Wall guy. I loved one, uh, uh, Josh, show me this fucking, uh, whatever the fuck Instagram picture or something like that. It gets a couple of years ago, they lost to the, uh, Atlanta, um, the fuck are they? The hawks, the Atlanta Hawks. Yeah. Saint Louis Hawks, the Atlanta Hawks, right? They lose two. And one of the guys on Atlanta, you know, they had a picture of them. Then the final seconds of winning

Speaker 2:          00:25:55       and John Wall has a real sad look on his face to do the posts of it's real happy. And then there's another Lana Hawk looking at John Wall laughing at him. And, uh, I guess John Walden, forget about this. So when they beat Atlanta, he posted a picture of him, you know, doing a crossover in the gout posted the picture fell on his fucking ass. I love people that hold grudges like that. I think that to be great, you have to be like that, which is why Eli Manning is such a fucking enigma.

Speaker 1:          00:26:23       You know what I mean? I swear to God, like if you saw that guy in the most

Speaker 2:          00:26:29       in the final two, two minute office of a Superbowl, his heart rate is the same is somebody at a fucking bake sale right outside of church. You know what I mean? Oh he thanks for coming out or how big your kids are getting. That's where his heart rate is.

Speaker 1:          00:26:44       You know, I swear to God they should just see it. All those dockers he's always wearing with the fucking sweater tucked into them. They should just make a uniform just to completely psych out the other team. If I was the giant side, he'd have like a special pair of football pants. They'd, they'd be the same colors. Dockers. He'd still have the pads and shit in it. But you know, some sort of dad jeans. So anyways, I think the Celtics was just going to go, uh, I think that's going to go seven and I think it's going to be fucking brutal. I think, uh, the wizards when the next one, and then I think we split down in DC, I think it's just going to go back and forth, back and forth, back and forth. Um, did that evenly matched and um, I dunno. I always forget the guy's name. That fucking Polish Transylvanian Dude, the white dude with a shaved head whose entire body is, is fucking hard as the top of his goddamn head. I mean, that guy looks like he could have played like fucking professionally, could have played like at least three different sports.

Speaker 1:          00:27:43       Fucking played spin, some gigantic fucking tight end. You know, he's there. His body, he's like fucking White Lebron. I know, I know. I've gone on a limb there, but I'm telling you that guy, he's a fucking beast. Who's joker with Josh coming? His Dad fucking grew up in eastern Europe. His Dad probably fucking beat him with one of those fireplace. Pokers all right. We're all laughing. I was sitting there going like that. That can't be the name. Okay. There's gotta be a different name for the four fire fireplace poker. I'm just saying what it does that can't be the name. And I looked it up and that's exactly what it's called.

Speaker 3:          00:28:18       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:28:18       Fireplace poker. That's the best they could come up with. They couldn't come up with some widget name, you know, even with like the ladies, they got that thing they put in their hair. Somebody came up. What's it called? That has called a Flowbee. Oh, what? Yeah. A Flowbee. The fuck is a Flowbee. I had something. You sticking your hair, it makes it to a couple of woopty dues. I don't know what I'm talking about. Let me do, um, let me, uh, let me read a little advertising here and then I'll talk about what a sad time it is to be a Washington DC fucking sports fan. Jesus Christ. All the fucking crying these Cleveland fans did. Did you ever see a city cry as much as say did? Oh, we show funky, miserable. I mean, maybe they did that in Boston back when we weren't, weren't fucking winning, but I always hated that shit over a long time ago. Espn did this whole, they wouldn't have some trial. Like who has the more miserable fucking sports fans? Cubs fans are red sox fans. I remember sitting at home laughing going, dude, I don't know. I don't know when this, you want to be more. Who the fuck wants to be the most miserable?

Speaker 3:          00:29:19       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:29:22       You know who those fucking the kind of person you don't want to run into in a goddamn bar. You know? Could you sit there and just talk about how life fucked him over? Sorry. Anyways, let me them read some of the, some of this advertising here. Oh my God. It's that time. It's that time of year when you can say, I got to get something for my mother

Speaker 2:          00:29:42       pro flowers. Everybody talk about how being a mom is often, often a thankless job and mother's Day is a chance to show your appreciation. Um, I think that's talked about enough, isn't it? It's always, you know, I want to see if they have that copy for father's day, that it's a fucking thankless job when we taste something right now. All right. Is is difficult a job is being a mother is you fucking babies are obsessed with you. My daughter barely looks at me. She just looked at me, she smiles like, Hey, there's that guy that I kind of know, but my wife walks in the room, she just like, she just follows her all around. Just is looking at it. I'm like, hey other parent or the parent over here, Yo, Yo. You know what I mean? You know like when you're at the, at the game and they're thrown free tee shirts into the crowd, right.

Speaker 2:          00:30:32       And you standing up and then there's a group of fucking hoe like hot chicks and shit. Like, like you're getting the tee shirt. It doesn't stop you though. You still stand up fucking flailing. Your arms never happens. Um, so evidently for some reason being a mom is a thankless job. Even though everybody always talks about how important the job is. There's not one presidential election that doesn't go by where they don't talk about it. Everybody's always saying, you know, mothers are saints and all of this type of shit.

All right, before I get into the questions here, let's talk about uh, the Washington sad sack. Washington DC sports fan. You know what I mean? After all this fucking shit about cubs fans, red sox fans, fans of Cleveland Sports. Meanwhile, look at fucking Washington DC.

Speaker 1:          00:42:45       They have nothing nationals. They went and Shit. The Redskins have been a fucking joke, a fucking joke for 25 fucking years. I know what you think will build. They want three fucking super bowls in the previous basically 10 11 years. Yeah, but you know something. They got some racist logo on the side. There was always something to take it away. You know what I mean? Where does thing ever, they had some black guy dressed up on the fucking native American head dress, maybe had some Indian blood in him. I have no idea. Native American blood. Whenever the fuck you supposed to say, you know the capital's how many times they go with the president's trophy get bounced out in the second round. They've won the case. They won the president's trophy three times since 2009 and every time they'd lost in the second round and they've dropped the first two fucking games and I was watching the end of this series at home against the Pittsburgh Penguins, the reptilian ice water in their veins.

Speaker 1:          00:43:38       Pittsburgh penguins who I'm telling you right now. I'll go in on and they're going to win this second Stanley Cup in a row. You heard it here. You heard it. Now you play it later and you will agree with me or you don't have a combatant fucking podcast again. No gift. Now I think they're just going to repeat. That's what it is. They're all dialed in. They got Phil Kessel, they got Crosby. They get so fucking day, got a fucking mock Andriy flour, whatever his fucking name is Theo fucking flurry, whatever the goaltenders name is, he doesn't give a shit. He's out there fucking doing the old fucking jazz hands stop and everything that's coming right mark on brief flurry, they got Jido this. They're just gonna overpower you. It's it. Or does Washington DC with the Capitol state rise up from the ashes in somehow figure out

Speaker 2:          00:44:31       a fucking way to win. Game three. I was watching the NHL network. This guy was going off going, this is the biggest fucking game in Washington capitols history and I agree. They got to do this. They got to this, and if they don't do this, they're going to blow up the whole fucking team. It's going to be sad. They don't have to start all over again.

Speaker 5:          00:44:51       Okay,

Speaker 2:          00:44:51       Jesus Christ. How do you not root for the capitals and game three? You got to do it. I'm going to be rooting for,

Speaker 5:          00:44:59       yeah

Speaker 2:          00:44:59       dude. Sidney Crosby. I tell I've been saying this for you. Sidney Crosby's backhand as more fucking velocity. They're most guys for his most guys wrist is in the league. It's fucking insane. Thank God you know something. God blessed his mother for raising him. Right? Cause I'll tell you right now with his backhand, thank God he knows how to treat a woman. Cause if he didn't Jesus Christ, he would make Oj looked like a fucking cub scout. All right, so game three is coming up. Definitely check that out. And a, and with that, here's some of the people's favorite Monday morning podcast moments. MMP Bowman's, that's what Andrew wrote. Oh we should have like the little big eyed smiling kids here. Um, Douche bag of the week. Brad, remember that? Um, don't care enough to find the link. But when Nia gave white people credit for creating the jug instrument, it was incredible.

Speaker 2:          00:45:53       Uh, that was funny. Oh then the classic member granny fucking water it poor best. It's probably still getting weird looks for those of you don't know a granny water was, this guy was playing some fucking game. It's kind of seemed like it was old maid, but a, you didn't want to like if you played the grantee water card, you fucked everybody else in the game. So it came as time to play it. And he's with his girlfriend and they're playing with the parents and out of nowhere, for whatever reason, he decides to give him the Monday morning podcast answer on the f word. And when he played the car, he just went granny fucking war and there was just dead silence.

Speaker 5:          00:46:32       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:46:32       And then he tried, tried to have to sit there and explain it to everybody. Uh, the, it's granny fucking water listener story from last year, I think. Uh, another one, greedy fucking water. The infamous Rosebowl story had me in stitches at work. That was the time when, uh, we got to put together a greatest hits. We really got to do that. That was the first rose bowl that we went to.

Speaker 5:          00:46:56       Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:46:56       When we stumbled in there and I fucking lost my balance. And there was an old woman in front of me and I had to like at my forum was in her back and she was kind of leaning forward and I was just sitting here going, oh, shy, sorry. And no one helped me up cause he was so horrified by the condition I was in. The only way for me to get up was I had to push off of her folded or and half. Oh God. I always get this weird feeling in my stomach whenever I don't have a, I hate that I did that, but I did.

Speaker 5:          00:47:26       Yeah,

Speaker 2:          00:47:27       I apologize. Whoever his grandmother that, but I made whatever. She's

Speaker 1:          00:47:30       a little more flexible, you know, she'll enjoy the last, you know, third of her life maybe. Um, not the person rose bowl story with Joe Barden. Nick, the old lady who kept getting angry and calling. Her husband had threatened you, mark. No, she wasn't an old lady. She was younger and that was the time she made fun and she made fun to Joe Barton. Nick's nose. Janie had a big nose and he just looked at her and said, you need to lose about 30 pounds before you talk to me, bitch. And I was just like, Oh God, all right, we're getting kicked out. And then she said, she's like, mark, did you hear what he said? Right. So the guy turns around to square off with Bartok. Bartok just looks at him and he used his big as a fucking Pittsburgh linebacker. So the guy takes one look at Bart, nick, and then starts fucking yelling at me and started threatening to throw me down on the field.

Speaker 1:          00:48:16       Uh, you fucking pussy. Yeah, you go right past Barton and can you go to old fucking bald carrot top. All right. I'm a new listener. He's a his his favorite moment. You asking Nia how she's so loud wearing slippers and she saying that's why she's angry with you. That's love. There you go. Um, all right, another one. You answered a question about a parrot like three years ago that it had me crying, laughing at my job. I got in trouble. I'll try to find it. I love how vague these are. This is just as vague. Um, oh, this person like the, for me, I just feel the Kardashians. The Kardashians could literally watch a baby starve to death and then then they would be crying, you know, fanning. They're fucking eyeliner so it doesn't, you know, smear going. Like for me, I just felt so sad because for me, um, it has to be that or the Colby 11th.

Speaker 1:          00:49:08       Oh God. Kelly Olynyk and those fucking Colby 11th is the worst thing I ever saw. A when you said Corey Feldman was the Lee Harvey Oswald of the robot, I had to pull over. I was laughing so hard. I don't even, it doesn't even make sense to me anymore. Um, anyways, let's see. Don't blow it. Keep it simple. Count your money. I don't even know what that is. Uh, when you did the ad for draft kings, one guy won $1,000. One guy's giving hand jobs for rent money or something like that. Oh yeah, that's right. I called that thing out for fucking being legalized gambling. Um, what else? TC? Come on. Frogs, dude. I called it barefoot pitches. There's too many to remember. I'm still working my way through the older ones, so this is really making me feel good that you guys remember all this shit. All right, here's another one. One of the best moments was when you told the story of going to the basketball game and they kept playing that everybody clap your hands. That's right. And it was all that crazy shit going on. Oh, everybody loves this. Read Old Zip, uh, nature's box. Yeah, I fucked that one up. I called. It

Speaker 1:          00:50:28       was, it was nature box was the name of it and I thought it was like possessive nature's box and I was like, you going down on Mother Nature? Needless to say, that was one and done read and full refund.

Speaker 3:          00:50:43       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:50:43       Um, some point we should put, I want to put together all the fucking one and done reads that I've had, um, under the clip. Didn't make a dime off those cans. All right. Um, oh, the Monday morning podcasts. Nia, did you, Maria, did you hear about Paula Abdul? She was like, I was like, she's a former backup dancer for the Lakers and now a big pop star. She thought she died. I did it better the first time. Anyways. Uh, when you told Nia about not checking out the funniest thing ever? Oh yeah. When I don't check out at hotels, um, I just walk out. I'm done. Done with you fucking people. Uh, when you compared Harry Truman to the guy from Shawshank, am I being obtuse or your last draft? Kings read. All right. The Charlie Murphy one. No. Yeah. Yeah. That was, uh, that was a sad one.

Speaker 1:          00:51:35       But it happy, happy memories. Uh, the Yoko Ono rant, strawberry poops. That's from the, uh, the Joe Rogan on it and read a, anytime you talk about cool cars, anytime you lean away from the mic and Yell Lane, uh, we're all humans. Some of us are good. Most of us are cons. Oh, the big tears. Big Tears. When Nia cried and, um, where were we? Italy. And I didn't know how to comfort her. I just kept going. I was hugging her and she was crying. She had like the biggest tears coming out of her eyes, like just fallen on my hands, like raindrops. I was like hugging him from behind, you know, she, she hit her head. That's why she bent down to pick something up and there was a shelf and she hit her head so fucking hard. My, my either my eyes like, just watered like, Holy Shit. I didn't know how to comfort us. So she was crying. It just, I just started reporting. But what was going on? I was just going, ah, that's just going big chairs. All right. As a stoner, I find your Auntie, we'd rans hilarious. I get so mad that I started hyperventilating. The lovely Nia, everybody eggs and not an, it's not me. It's near like Nancy, uh, Nia story about hitting her head in her big tears. Big Tears. All right. We said that one. Okay. Uh, you said ric flair wouldn't have come up that fast. I don't even know what that is. Colby 11. Why are you going to Indianapolis bail? Oh, that fucking freak from the plane.

Speaker 3:          00:53:02       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:53:04       Let me see. Friends trying to get the rat out of your new house story is an all time favorite. Anytime there's a zip all yeah. When we were renting that house, when I got the fucking kitchen redundant,

Speaker 3:          00:53:15       um, MMM

Speaker 1:          00:53:17       fucking zillion dollars I put in this house, I'm never going to get back. Uh, the one time you were talking about those two guys eating shit or riding the skateboard

Speaker 2:          00:53:26       and motorcycle, the skateboard or crashing is the funniest story you've ever told that needs to be an animal. Oh my God. They, we should animate. That is so right. At time I saw that fucking Guy Griffith park coming down and he wasn't dressed like a skateboarder and it was like seven 30 in the morning. You know, when I was walking my old dog Cleo, oh, I miss that dog. I'm going to see her again next month.

Speaker 2:          00:53:50       I just feel it like she's in college and I still always got a visitor. Look, I love that dog and I'm fucking going to be there someday when she takes her final breaths, I'm going to fucking be there. Um, anyways. Yeah. So I was walking my dog and this fucking guy came by like the biggest hill in Griffith park and he was just dressed in street clothes and it started wobbling all my God, a new fucking reference here, like in a moto GP, the tank slap when it starts fucking oscillate and you know, and all of a sudden they can't get it to stop. He started doing that shit and just like, I don't know, I'll try and find the clip because I was more vivid when I just saw it. It was one of the fucking most insane wipeouts. It easily could have taken over the agony of defeat, um, in wide world of sports.

Speaker 2:          00:54:35       Um, anyways. Um, what else? How many six year olds could you kill before they took you down? You know, I was actually thinking about animating that recently, but after all the fucking psycho horrible shit that's happened in the world since I did that used to be funny, you know, and that's the world we're living in. It's not funny anymore to me. All right, Doug Flutie heckling story about a friend who takes things too far. May Be cry laughing at the gym. No idea which episode that was. Oh yeah. That was a buddy of mine who didn't know how to talk shit.

Speaker 5:          00:55:05       Okay,

Speaker 2:          00:55:06       I'll tell you that one quickly. Uh, Doug Sudi came back playing for the bills and we're sitting in the end zone seats and um,

Speaker 2:          00:55:14       everybody's like heckling Doug Flutie gonyet killed image it. Hey Doug, you two small blah blah, blah, blah, blah. And my buddy wanted to get in and all the shit talk and uh, you know, go back to the CFL and everybody's just trashing him and my buddy doesn't know where the line is. And he also studied starters and out of nowhere he just goes, hey, hey, hey, hey Flutie. I hope you kid dies in everybody in the end zone who was hammered immediately sobered up just when like, ah, and everybody just sat shifts like, dude, what the fuck?

Speaker 2:          00:55:49       Fucking brutal. All right. Which also used to kind of be amusing to me until now I have a kid now I'm just kind of like, yeah, that really, he wasn't really funny either. Alright, Jason Marks. I don't know what that one is. Draftkings final read. And lastly, but not leastly don't wear different. No nowhere to find the link, but the one that introduced the great add Paul Versey where you guys debated time travel. Oh, that was a good one. That was a good one, man. All right, let me read, I got time here to read a couple of, uh, a couple of questions here for the week. All right. Military, uh, their bill of the Boar Bu Oh, Ari, I don't know what that means. I will see you podcasts all the time. I also from time to time, uh, appreciate your standup comedy.

Speaker 2:          00:56:38       Oh, that was a nice backhanded compliment. I listened to your podcast all the time and also from time to time, appreciate your standup comedy. You know, it's got a ride from time to time. He makes me smile. I am from New Hampshire and your video tour of Hampton beach was right on the money. I am writing to you about my best bud in the military. We are both in the service as we became friends. He confessed, he confessed that he's a virgin. At the age of 32 over the past two years since I've known the guy he refers to play video games and eat

Speaker 2:          00:57:10       dunkaroos then going out in public. Don't go rose. What the fuck are those? Um, he's an exceptionally funny kid and has no problem making good impression on strangers or even a lady. He just cannot reach women in a sexual way right now. He stationed in Europe in good shape, has a bad ass jobs, speaks French and is generally charismatic guy. He has every reason to be doubt drowning and ladies and can even use the foreign card. But as I check in with them, he still hasn't gotten out from behind the 60 inch plasma TV. I don't know what his problem is because he would always be bitching about wanting a girlfriend. I think he may be whacking it too much. Uh, the new echo epidemic. And another tidbit is that he will turn to heavy drinking, which actually helps to open them up. I can tell he's not satisfied being sick single and using alcohol, but will not take the initiative to break the cycle. I'm pissed because he's not using the golden opportunity to slay over there and he's just disrespecting and it's just disrespectful to the rest of us. That's fucking hilarious. Um, yeah man, he seems, I would say that he should probably go to therapy and work out whatever it is hang up is, because that could be a lot of shit that he's sitting on

Speaker 3:          00:58:25       and um,

Speaker 2:          00:58:28       yeah, that's sad. I feel bad for that guy. You know what I mean? It'd be one thing, like some people just naturally like the loners and asexual or whatever, and they don't want to be out there, but whatever his deal is, you know, be a sad thing. If somebody wanted to find love and they couldn't find love, that guy should be crushing it. If he could speak French and he can speak English like that. France, that's your whole fucking world over there. Even if you went to England and they don't give a fuck that you could speak English cause so today, but if you go, so bust out some French, Bam, you crushed in that. Yes. And he's a man in uniform through this guy. He's like fucking like three different porno fantasies for women.

Speaker 3:          00:59:08       Yeah,

Speaker 2:          00:59:09       he's got what? What is he going to do next? Start cleaning polls. Delivering pizzas. Yeah. There's no reason for it. I would tell you buddy that he, she should go talk to somebody about it, but it's kind of difficult if he's drowning himself at

Speaker 1:          00:59:22       booze and a, it's a delicate thing and it's very difficult to get somebody to go get help and I mean they have to want to do it themselves. So, um, but you've got Fred met cause you get, you actually give a shit. All right. Conspiracy theory. Sorry, I'm rushing through this. I'm coming up on an hour in these fucking gas line. People are going to be shown up soon. Conspiracy theory. Uh, Bill, what do you think of the flat earthers it's a growing movement of people who think we're being lied to about the shape of the earth. Do you think this is something you would have bought into in your earlier more intense conspiracy days? No, I wouldn't. You fucking cunt all you guys. This is what I hate about conspiracy theory. Conspiracy theory is everybody gets lumped into the, people think the moon is made out of cheese and that they're shape shifters and lizard people.

Speaker 1:          01:00:11       Okay. All I was saying is that the fucking Federal Reserve is a privately owned corporation, which is a fucking fact. Okay. I'll say things like, I don't think that the government or the corporations give a shit about the people in Iraq because I saw the way they treated these people in New Orleans. They don't give a fuck about them. They don't give a shit about those people over there. Okay, so I don't buy that. That's, that's the level that I go to. All right. I don't take it to this. This is what I would say to those fucking flat earth people. Okay. Okay. Let's just say the earth is flat then. Wouldn't all the ocean waters just run off the end of it? Why isn't that happening? How do you explain that? I would love to talk to a flat earth person, you know, and be like, well, why don't you guys do a startup and get yourself a little fucking rocket? Go up in the fucking air. It's like, have you ever Fuckin flown in a jet? You Jackass, you can look out the window and say, cl, you'd see the roundness of the earth.

Speaker 3:          01:01:11       MMM.

Speaker 1:          01:01:14       I Dunno, but you know what? I want to fucking watch videos of it. I want to hear what they think flat earthers are actually more ridiculous than people trying to exclude believe in like, uh, uh, creationism or whatever. Believe in Adam and Eve, Adam and Eve to white people that somehow created Asians and black people and all that type of shit. I don't fucking get all that. Well, actually, you know something. Yeah, I dumped, you know what I think I actually believe, believe what that type of shit. I actually think that a, I watched one of those Neil degrasse Tyson things and he said, you know, we actually came out of trees and I was just like, you know, what is fucked up is that is at least I can look at a tree. It'd be like, there it is. That is a trait. Can Walk over, I can touch it, I can climb on it. Um, it actually made more sense to me then. Um,

Speaker 3:          01:02:01       okay.

Speaker 1:          01:02:01       Then Adam and eve, I mean it's just, I don't know

Speaker 1:          01:02:05       if you put like Adam, if Adam and eve was a movie and then the tooth fairy was a movie, I mean I'd put them in the exact same category and I don't think that that's right. All right. Conspiracy theory. Oh, everywhere. I've already read that one. India, taking cash out of circulation. Oh, Jesus Christ. Bill just read an article about India and it freaked me out a little bit. Last November, India removed 86% of the country's cash from circulation. Most people are now using mobile payment options and the artists see, I don't know what that means. Also goes on to say the article, sorry, I got the laptop on the floor, but there was a TRC. I, the article also goes on to say that ATM machines at Bank cars would be obsolete as early as 2020 in India. Not having physical money and only using a phone for buying stuff really makes me uncomfortable.

Speaker 1:          01:02:54       Any thoughts? Yet? They're on their way to microchipping all of us. And once again, everybody's gonna think that's fucking crazy. You can go on the Internet, you can look at shitheads who work for corporations that are like proud of their fucking microchip and their level of security clearance that they have. No, they're going to phase out fucking everything. There's going to be cameras everywhere. You're going to be fucking microchipped and this is the thing, it's still not going to be enough control for them. They still won't feel comfortable that they had. That's how bad their fucking you over that. They need to have that level of fucking surveillance on you. That's how fucking weird they are. And they want to see what you talk about, what you jerk off to and all this shit that fits fucking beyond creepy. And I hate when something like that gets brought up on like the fucking news and all in the best the news anchor could do is kind of widen the eyes like okay, that's kind of a, that's going to be interesting. And then they immediately go to talk to us about some fucking old lady that, you know, just, you know, made her own jam or some shit. That's the feelgood story to get out of it. No, it's unbelievably fucking creepy. And um,

Speaker 1:          01:03:59       I dunno, I have no idea how to stop it. I have no idea how to, to fucking stop it because no matter what you do, people just sit there. Like, I watched this thing on, on the news and they showed a robot talking to a little five year old kid in the robot was going like if you put me in the closet, that would make me sad. And like the robot is preying on the fucking emotions of a five year old kid. Like that things should be illegal.

Speaker 3:          01:04:24       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:04:25       Like, do you realize how fucked up that I make us? We've always done that with products, preying on the emotions of kids, but to just see it in that level of raw form and just sit there and having this robot lying to a five year old, like it has fucking feelings. Um, I don't know. Does it mean it was everything seemed like it's just really sped up the we're just heading right over the fucking waterfall. That's, that's what I thinks. Gonna I dunno. That's what I believe anyways. Um, I actually, this is my theory. I believe that there's the upper 1% and that they are going to get us all microchipped and when they get sick of that shit there, they're going to dig in a sick. The robots on us, they going to take us all out and it eventually the robots will take over the upper 1% and um, and not in the way you think.

Speaker 1:          01:05:05       They're not going to kill him. They're just going to be like all looking like supermodels and human beings won't bang each other anymore cause it's going to be, it's to be way more difficult. You know what I mean? Be Way more fucking difficult to banging a real fucking human being and then there will just become extinct. All right. Overrated versus underrated. Overrated. Giving a shit bill. I just turned 35, six months ago and I realized how great life can be when you start to only care about shit that pertains to you. Oh, I thought that that doesn't to be like give a shit caring about your fellow man. This is completely for me. This is the other way. Um, I don't care about anything anymore. And my friends and family say they really enjoy my company more these days. I wasn't yoga or Tony Robbins. It wasn't yoga at Tony Robins. No disrespect to either of them. It was apathy. Uh, all right. Maybe that's what that fucking 32 year old virgin needs underrated. Waking up early. I've been waking up early for the last two years of my life has changed drastically. Everything I talk about doing, I actually do now and I'm in better shape than ever because of that. Hey, you know what? I'll throw another one. I'll throw a good fucking underrated out there. Sausage.

Speaker 1:          01:06:15       I got this great fucking a butcher, you know, a couple of towns over and I make the drive. I make the drive. That's how good this fucking butcher is. And when I go in there,

Speaker 2:          01:06:24       no, all I ever looked at was to steaks. I looked at the chops, you know, the fucking pork chops chicken. And occasionally I would fuck with the fish, but I blew right by the sausage. I was just, I don't know, I think just never was into it. You know, it's weird. I'll have sausage on pizza, I'll have it in an Omelet, but I never gave a fuck about it. So it was on the phone with the lovely Nia and you know, we'd been going there a lot and we were kind of running out of options. We'd done all the stake shit. We'd done the fucking pork chops. I don't fuck with veal though. There's no need. There's no need to do that to an animal. You know what I mean? Just let the thing run around and give it the old fucking right there, Fred. Um, anyways, so I was just like, I dunno, what do you want to get now? It's just, and I was just sort of, as I was talking to, I looked over at the sausages, right? Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:07:08       And there was one that looked like this fucking giant, like a black Porno Dick. Right? So I look at it and go, what the fuck is that? And it said it was short ribs, sausage with cheese. So I said, I go near these, got these fucking porno, Black Dick look and sausages here that say this short rib with cheese. She goes, get those right. And I don't know if that sounded delicious or just she's sick of being with me. But anyways, I got two of them. Right.

Speaker 2:          01:07:39       And this is really just become some big sexual thing. No, my wife did not have a threesome with them. We actually had them for dinner. Ah. So anyways, uh, we came home, cooked those fucking things up in the skillet, made some pasta and a little bit of fucking sauce for it. And uh, it was fucking delicious. And now I'm, now I'm all about it. Now I'm just thinking, once again, I want to on the big green egg, I want to learn how to fucking make a pizza, right? Maybe just cheat, get the fucking pizza dough. I can make it good enough sauce. I get some fresh cheese and I'll go down the street, get the fucking Pono Dick fucking sausage, right? Paula Lorena, Lorena Bobbitt, chop it up. Put It on the fucking, I'm sorry. You know what, underwriting, you know, it's difficult, underrated. Trying to talk about sausage and not going into the porn world. Um,

Speaker 1:          01:08:30       I mean, what do you want to do? Fucking lady looking at it? It's a giant fucking meat. All right. That's the podcast is a 10 year anniversary.
