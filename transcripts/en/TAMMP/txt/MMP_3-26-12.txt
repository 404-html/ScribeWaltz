Speaker 1:          00:00:01       Hey, what's going on? It's bill burn. It's the Monday morning fucking podcast for Monday, Monday, uh, March 26th. Um, I just had the breakfast of champions. People. I had a fucking, I had an egg always g a G. Hey lady. What you make Dag, take it easy. I hate a fucking egg over easy. I had a week English muffin sliced in half, so it's only one, but it counts as two. And then I finished it off with a slice of cheesecake. So I got salt and sugar pumping through my fucking veins. In other words, I am going to go like a madman for about eight minutes and then I'm going to crash me in. I don't feel like doing it anymore, man. Um, let's talk about, let's talk about what else we going to talk about. Bill, let's talk about your fucking life. I got a Goddamn crow. This is three weeks in a row with the fucking animals first.

Speaker 1:          00:01:01       The squirrels last week. It was a moth. This week we got it. We got it. I got a CHRO. I don't know if that built the fucking nest far as I know crows don't have ness. Am I wrong here? As far as my, my, uh, observance of birds to crows or the drifters, they just showed us like show up like Clint Eastwood used to in those cowboy movies and then all the other birds fucking scatter. And then they sit there with that little fucking hand rolled cigar bandanna around their fucking burden neck. Anyways, I guess the same way nobody knew that there was a mafia until Robert Kennedy told everybody that there was a mob. Um, I finally discovered the crows actually have never thought they just floated around having one night stands with sparrows, but evidently they have a fucking nest or this crow loves the tree right outside my window because every morning at like six 30 now there's fucking crow. I don't know what it's doing. I'm sound asleep. Right? I'm getting my beauty sleep. I'm a fucking ginger, right? My face is gonna crack up unless it, unless I make sure I get eight hours dunk my face and lotion every day. But I don't do that look like I was fishing for lobsters. Um, so every morning this fucking crow is outside my window. Just gone.

Speaker 1:          00:02:31       Like for fuck, I want to throw, I want to get up and it just fucking throw my iPhone at it. That's what I want to do. But I'm so fucking tired I can't move. So I just lay there and um, I dreamed that I'm doing it, that I walk up to the window and I lifted it up. Am I dream of wearing a wife beater? You know, cause anytime you're mad and you want to yell out your window, you have to, you have to have on a fucking wife beater. And I just fucking, I know how I stand back from the window so I can get some velocity and I just side on that thing right out and I hit that fucking thing right. And it's God damn beak, you know, not a headshot. It can still walk away from it every fucking morning.

Speaker 2:          00:03:15       Okay.

Speaker 3:          00:03:21       Of this morning. It didn't, it didn't. But I had a add some company and they were getting up at fucking, uh, four 30 in the fucking morning cause they had an early flight. And uh, you know, it's funny. So they got up and they said goodbye, so we said goodbye. All right, thanks. Thanks for visiting. We'll see you later. Right. So they leave and right as they start to go back asleep again, right, right around when this fucking crows going to start doing this. God Damn

Speaker 3:          00:03:50       like it's, it's tied to something and it's slowly being beaten with a fucking rubber hose. Right. The fucking bird makes no noise. So Billy boy is just sleeping away and what happens? My fucking phone makes a god goddamn noise. And it was the people who stayed with us texting me to let me know that they had missed their flight, you know? And I'm like, wow, that sucks. Lax is horrible. Send trying to go back to sleep. And then right as I fall asleep again, they send another text to be like, oh, we made it. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:04:22       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:04:23       You know that couldn't have waited til 9:00 AM you couldn't tell me about your exciting little trip to the fucking airport though. Texting me every five seconds. Oh my God, you should see the line down here. Stand. Then I'm asleep and he goes boom. Right my fucking ear. What does it do bill? It goes blue. I can't do the fucking noise. What am I Michael Winslow go rent one of the police academy movies and just say, just fantasize how he would have fucking done it. So, oh, I know it saved the sugars. Fucking hit me. The salt. I'm starting to crash. Having you guys just felt my energy, my energy started going down. It's kind of like back in the day when before iTunes when you actually bought albums and you heard a song on the radio and you fucking loved it and you were about three tracks in right now and you realize the song you heard on the radio was the only good one. That's what this podcast is going to be. This podcast is going to be like a Cinderella album. You know? Speaking of that, I have to download, shake me. I heard that the other day when I went to the fucking kings, uh,

Speaker 1:          00:05:25       Bruins, the kinks, Voca, the sugar is killing me. The kings fucking Bruins

Speaker 4:          00:05:31       and that song came out shake. Oh yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:05:39       I think that's all he says for five minutes. Shake me. Which I don't even understand what that meant. I think it's somehow it has to be, it's some sort of a sexual innuendo, but I don't know what that means is he liked her to walk up and rather than shake his hand, just grab his Dick. Hello. How are you? I'll be the woman fucking you this evening. Um, I dunno, but you know what? I'm going to download it. I've been downloading a lot of weird shit lately. I downloaded that Bob Dylan song tangled up in blue where he sings about every woman he ever banged. She was working in a fucking diner, an hour dealing with my hat. She said, son, it is, and as big and I fucking said, and I went down in the bud and tangled up in blue. Right. Every time you'd think it's fucking over.

Speaker 1:          00:06:31       Then I in a fucking girl named Susan bound side of the road. Ooh. She bent down to tie my shoes and a blue fucking alone. She wiped it off and looked at me. Then why did you fucking do dad 20 fucking minutes song, you know, tangled and you sit there and try to sing along with you guys. Hey, you know, you just, you just chime in the end. Every time. Tangled up in blue begging it. Bap Bap Purdue. Alright, I'm sorry that that last little dead. He was brought to you by cheesecake. Cheesecake. The breakfast of champions. I swear I'm going for in 2012 man tents. That's what I want. That's what the ladies are looking for, you know, and when I wear my wife beater and yell at that car when there'll be copping them ever. So shapely, you know, hey, if you get man tests, do you have a higher chance of getting breast cancer as a male?

Speaker 1:          00:07:26       Just started curiosity because I don't think you can get breast cancer as a male if you don't have man tits. It's like getting cancer of the air, you know, they don't exist. They're not there. Right. Okay. Who has no medical background. All right. Moving on. So I went to the fucking Bruins game, right man. This, this guy, uh, you know, uh, got me tickets, right? One of the guys they play pick up hockey with. Oh, by the way, pill, when you play pick up hockey, do you wear anything to protect your feet? As a matter of fact, I know I've been wearing skate fenders warm for the first time last week and an actual fucking game. I skated around in a public rink with them, you know, and uh, as opposed to my private rank that I have outback fucking idiot. I'm an idiot. I'm a fucking area.

Speaker 1:          00:08:15       So, um, I used them in a game and I took one off the foot and I didn't even feel it. And I was able to continue scaling out there at the mediocre level that I play that wonderful game. Skate fenders.com everybody go there and get yourself a pair. Stop being a fucking pussy. Stop being the person who doesn't want to go down to the rank and be the first guy wearing them a right. I went to the blues kings game and the Bruins a kings game this week. And why can't you just say, I went to the king's game when the back to back where they play the blues and the Bruins. I could have edited that together a little better. Don't you think? Um, and I saw a lot of guys out there wearing them. You know, and if it's good enough for them, why can't you wear, you don't want to get made fun of.

Speaker 1:          00:08:53       How old are you? All right, you're an accountant. You're not making it into the NHL. Okay? So go to escape fender.com. Type in Bill Burr, all one word, all lowercase. You get $5 off. Protect your fate. You know, how are you going to stand up when you're 80 on your porch and be good, right? If you've been taken pucks, see afoot. No fucking kids are going to take you seriously if he can't get up off your chair on the porch, all right? To go to escape fetter.com get yourself a pair. If you don't even play hockey, just put them on your loafers, shuffle around, shuffle around your kitchen, and then say everything you always wanted to say to your wife. And when she goes to stomp on your foot, you're not going to feel it. And she's going to get bone spurs. Okay? So anyway, so I went to the king's Bruins game.

Speaker 1:          00:09:42       That was a commercial, by the way. I went to the Bruins kings game and uh, so one of the guys I play hockey with, he woke me up with these tickets and they have like a club. This is how fucking La la is. It was a club. And in between periods, like you sit down and immediately everybody who sits down you, you have to, you walk in, they take your credit card and your license just fucking walk with that Shit, right? Then they got all these, these uh, almost hot waitresses walking around, you know what I mean? You don't want almost hot is that means your body is slamming and so is your face except into a wall.

Speaker 1:          00:10:28       It wasn't even that she wasn't good looking. She just was a cunt. You know the way all beautiful women, our account. Why cause it beautiful. Not all of them, but most of them. They got that fucking, I'm beautiful. Everybody wants to bang me. I don't even have to fucking try attitude. Right. This fucking won't this Horman she comes by once in the first period. Okay. So I walk by, I'm trying to understand, I'm showing a little empathy. I said, hey sweetheart, I had to go find her sweetheart with your midriff showing, you know, listen, I know you're busy, but if you get a chance, can you, can you swing by again? And she gives me this fucking look like I just asked her, I dunno to help me move or something. Hey, can you help me hang this picture? Like I said, that I didn't, I just said, hey, if you don't mind, could you do your fucking job more than once in the first peer in the next period.

Speaker 1:          00:11:21       But was funny. It was in between periods. Um, though it turns into like a dance club. Like they just start playing like all this fucking techno music. Alright. And or whatever the fuck that they play in all that, all that crap. It's, so they basically take every song and then they put that beat underneath it and I'm sitting behind me was um, what do you call a group of gay guys? Like I know like a, uh, like a bunch of cows is a herd and he gay listeners out there any twinkle toes can tell me, what do you call, just a pack of gay guys that look like a fucking j crew ad just sitting behind us. And one of them was lance bass lads bass. Was that the game looking younger than he did when he was in, in sync? So this is my question. When is somebody in the television, uh, um, or whatever in the beauty products saying, you know, they have like now they have like the UFC workout, they got the fucking, uh, the grapefruit 45 die there. He always got some fucking thing. What is, somebody's got to figure out what gay guys do. So they don't age. You know, Dick Clark somehow figured it out.

Speaker 2:          00:12:39       You know

Speaker 1:          00:12:42       it's guy and you like, cause I was looking at, I've gone, that's not lance bass personal is what's going. That's Lance Bass. I go, no it isn't. He still looks like he's fucking 22. That kid's got to be like 50 by now. And he wasn't, he was just you sitting there. I still don't think it was him. I thought it was like Wayne Gretzky Sun. That's what it looked like. You know you are Jesus Christ.

Speaker 1:          00:13:04       Wayne Gretzky looks like a straight lance bass. I never realized that. See that. That's why I do this podcast people. I do it. So I learned something. Um, Oh God, what do I got left here? I just, I, you know something, I haven't been on stage in like three fucking weeks and it's really affecting me. Look at me. I'm running out of, I don't have any comedy cardio anymore. I'm 13 minutes, 25 seconds in and I'm ready for this thing to be done. It's like I came out and I got fucking shelled and the first two winnings, you know, and the managers walking out of the dugout and I'm, I'm walking towards him. You know that that's when you know you suck is you don't even wait until the manager gets there. You start walking off the mound, you meet him at the first baseline, handed the ball.

Speaker 1:          00:13:46       Yay. Got It today. All right, I'm going to get my shoulder rub down in, uh, I don't know what I'm gonna have to rub one out cause there's no way I'm getting pussy after that performance. Um, you guys have the MLB channel. That's one of the great things. They actually haven't the NC 17 MLB late night and that way they make up all the players. You get to hear everything. I actually heard a guy in the twin say what? I just said, I just want to get busted for a plagiarism. You know, that's one of my ideas. That's why I can never get a t a TV show is my ideas never seem to fit into the room. Oh, Bill, you just such a fucking rebel, aren't you? I think I am. I think I'm pat myself on the back here now. You know where it is. I have great ideas, but they all are not conducive to a mass audience and children. I think that that's what the problem is. So if anybody can help me with this one, I have an idea.

Speaker 2:          00:14:38       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:14:39       Uh, for a new level of watching sports, it's NFL, NC 17 MLB, NC 17 NBA, NC 17, and you guessed it, a worldwide tennis, no, NHL NC 17. And basically you just Mike Up. Everybody. Okay. It's for adults only. And rather than hearing the people commentate the game, you actually just people, you just hear him cursing each other out as we go down the fucking court. Skate down the ice. You fucking cock suck out. Right. That's what I want to hear. I wanna hear that shit. Like when a manager goes up and just be like, you know, do you realize that you're supposed to be throwing strikes here? Well this is like the third fucking start in a row. You tubby shit out, but you do some sit ups. I know CC's fat, but it works for him. It's not working for you. Get the fuck Outta here.

Speaker 1:          00:15:32       Ah, Jesus Christ. Did we get any more Dominican's left? These fucking white guys can't pitch anymore and that'd be great. Or like with two players in the same team really fucking get into it. That will be great. But you know, it would suck, would be the, uh, the reporters. Cause then the reporters would hear all of it and they'd have even more bullshit soap opera crap to write about. You know, cause I don't want to, I know, I just want to listen to him shooting the shit and trashing each other. And uh, then afterwards I don't need them to be like, why did you call Tom Brady? You're fucking adware and dose. Like, I don't need to know why. I don't care. I just want to hear it, you know? I mean, we'll fucking times, cause I listened to these commentators don't tell you up paying manning I got to be taken.

Speaker 1:          00:16:21       Is that ere going to be too thin for my big fucking head? Well, my head move faster in the thin atmosphere. Um, speaking of which, is herm Edwards doing a parody of an ESPN analysts or is it, is he really, you know, are they putting something in his drink? I don't understand that guy. That's a guy who played the game for over 20 years. He coached it for like fucking 10, 15. It doesn't have anything to say is, is he somehow related to flavor? Flave I don't understand what that guy is doing on their channel. He starts like really slow and then out of nowhere he just yells and then looks at the other guy, a the patriots to play in the cults today. What do you think Khurram Edwards? Well, I tell you, you got two guys on either side of the ball that really know how to throw a raptor.

Speaker 1:          00:17:12       I'm going to be about Blah Blah and he fuck it. Looks off. What the fuck just happened? It's almost like he's gonna, he's, he's about ready to have some sort of epileptic fit and he's trying to get his fucking sentence out before his eyes rolled back and he falls off that share that, you know, they got at staples, even if it is ESPN, those corporate concert we're always trying to cut. They're always trying to cut corners, you know. All right bill. That went nowhere and it just came to a fucking screeching halt. I brought my car over to get it fixed today cause I was parked at a meter and somebody somehow, I don't know, they didn't side swipe, they didn't t bone it. It's almost like they just came in at a 45 degree angle and said I hate that front quarter panel. And they just slammed into it and a right at the last second when they thought they were going to drive it into my poor excuse for an engine block on that car. They just cut the wheel. Um, I don't know if it was a three point turn gone wrong. I don't know. Somebody should have done a three point turn and tried to do a one point Youi I have no idea how the fuck could have happened, but I brought, I just brought it over there to some guy named rusty who's fucking breath smell like cigarettes. He smoked in 1972

Speaker 1:          00:18:24       and then I walked over to fucking, uh, the rental car, place one over to ava. I wore red fucking blazer for hoping that will get me a discount and

Speaker 5:          00:18:35       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:18:36       I come walking out to the parking lot. They go like, okay, miss you bro. You chose a mid sized car. We have a fucking whatever the fuck. It wasn't a long day. I don't know what cards they were even called anymore. Right with, would that be to your liking? And I'm looking at this blue space ship and I'm like, uh, what else do you got actually sure. That's all we have in the midst. Then why did you just say is that to my liking? You will hope it. I'd be local. Yeah. Yeah it is. And then you could just continue. I just called your bluff their world series at [inaudible]. What else you got while we can I point here, you'd have to upgrade you an SUV. So I'm looking at this fucking car headlights and brake lights wrap all the way around like those Lance Armstrong glasses, you know, it's Blue Cube and uh, and I'm looking on the back and I'm like, is it a Honda? Is that what that age is? It's sort of a fucked up looking at age. Janetta was a Hyundai. I'm driving a Hyundai people and which from a Prius to a Hyundai, you know, and uh, my balls of completely pulled up inside my body, you know, Hyundai really ripped off Honda's h you know, they kind of turn it to the side a little bit to full old guys like me, you know, I don't fucking know fucking girls. I get winded, I can dry heave.

Speaker 1:          00:20:00       Um, let's, let's, let's, let's go into the, uh, the letters for this week. People. I, I really felt like this podcast was going to be great and I had all this shit to talk about and now I'm just feeling like I've run out of things to stay and it's scaring me. Anti car. Hey Bill, what are the drawbacks of having an antique car? I've always wanted a a 55 Chevy Bel Air. And hearing you talk about your truck has made me realize I should do it while I'm still young. Abso-Fucking-Lutely I got to tell you right now, there is no drawback to having an antique car. All right? If you just mentally except a few things, a, it's fucking old. B, you're going to have to do some things to it and see. You're going to feel like 1 million bucks when you drive down the street. Okay? There's a tradeoff for everything. All right? And um,

Speaker 1:          00:20:54       you definitely want to do it while you still young because you know you're going to get married, you can have kids and you know, your wife's going to be thinking about the kids going, is that safe? I don't think it's safe. You know that you're going to hear it, you know, through your mail ears. All you're going to hear is, are you having fun? I don't want you to have fun. I want your life to be miserable. And then you've got a call or something horrific name in front of your fucking kids and then that's going to be it, you know, and then you'll have your car, you'll be fucking living in it. Um, look, I, I, there's, you know what the drawback is? It depends on what you buy. If you buy something really like a,

Speaker 2:          00:21:36       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:21:37       I dunno, like rare that a lot of people don't have the drawback is trying to get parts. If you buy it like a Mustang or Camaro, there's evidently there's parts for days on those kinds of cars. And I also would think a Chevy bel air that's like, you're buying a classic, like a classic of the classics. So, you know, I mean I even think like a Bel aire is one of those cars that you can actually, if you have like 300 grand, if they'll just make you a brand new one. You know? Cause I know you can do that with like a stick of fucking 68 Camaro somewhere online. I saw that they'll just build you one, a brand new one. It costs like $170,000 for some stupid fucking reason. Um, it costs all that money.

Speaker 2:          00:22:20       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:22:20       You know, which I kind of look at that. That's like cds and when they came out and they was 17 bucks and eventually you're going to come down, they don't, um,

Speaker 2:          00:22:28       yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:22:29       to my laptop is fucked. I have to buy a new one. It's like all it's filled up.

Speaker 2:          00:22:34       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:22:35       Why I'm getting that little pinwheel. Why is it still doing that enough already?

Speaker 2:          00:22:40       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:22:41       Um, so no, there is no drawback to have an antique car unless you just buy a complete hunk of shit that had a, uh, a major accident and the guy's not honest about it. And then you got yourself a fucking lemon. That would be the drawbacks. So what I would do is find a friend of yours who's a fucking gearhead and they'll help you out. You know, like I, that's what I did with mine. And, um, once I got the okay from the dude and he said it was a solid vehicle than a,

Speaker 1:          00:23:14       I went ahead and I got it. Yeah, no, I was just thinking the other day I was actually took it out on the highway man and whoever the fuck had it before me, really baby Dick. I'm the fourth owner. But the first two owners had it from 68 to 2009. So I think that was a father son than somebody else bought it and the recession hit and they had to get rid of it. But it drives, like they change the oil every 3000 miles, which is a, a is a huge thing. So, um, I dunno what the fuck, what is this? The speed channel? Hey, bill baseball. Are we in for good baseball season? Uh, I have no idea. It seems as if somebody says, it seems as if the past few years have been terrible seasons with the expectation, with the exception of a few good playoff series, though I'm sure they wouldn't have been as exciting without the exaggerated rivalries since when is a cubs Padres series been monumental?

Speaker 1:          00:24:06       Maybe it's just me. I think the last time a cubs pod race season was Ma us series was monumental. Might have been the early eighties Tony Gwynn, Leon Durham, Bill Buck now, um, you know, somebody said they brought up bill Buckner to me the other day and they would just say, yeah, yeah, I saw this whole thing, how we had to move. He had to leave Boston after that and just like, I just don't understand that. The shock of that. Yeah. Yeah. You have to leave. Yeah. You fucked up a world series that people at that point, he'd been waiting 70 something years and you'll let it roll through your legs. Gee, did you have a difficult time?

Speaker 5:          00:24:43       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:24:44       Abdalla yelling at his kids too. Yeah. Yeah. I would assume that. I would assume that that was, that's what would happen. You've been to a game, you hear the shit that people yell. You hear the stuff that people say, what do you think you're special.

Speaker 1:          00:24:59       I don't fucking, I don't, you know, I'm not saying it's right by just, I don't understand the shock. That's like after nine 11 when Arabs were complaining that they were getting harassed at the airport. Yeah. Yeah. That's going to, I would think that that would happen the same way as if fucking 20 redheads went out and did some fucked up shit. I would expect to be getting some looks the next day. I'm not saying it's right, I don't condone it, but I wouldn't sit there dumbfounded going to move to Ireland and get with all the other fucking redheaded cons. You know, cause everyone was staring at me and Connecticut. I just fucking blows my mind every time they bring up shit like that.

Speaker 1:          00:25:41       Like that, that fucking kid there in Chicago. I mean a whole sad sack story about that fucking kid who reached out and touched the ball that was fucking in play or they had a shot at, you know, you only thing that confuses me about that story is why they didn't hunt down the other five fucking cunts around them who were also reaching up for the ball. That's the only way I will defend that guy. But other than that, you know when you, when you touch a ball that's playable and one of the athletes points that you like, what the fuck you got to? Why would you still sit there? You immediately, you've got to get the fuck out of there. Now I'm not saying that you should go on the radio and out the guy and say who the fuck he is. What I'm saying is my ex, my expectation for human behavior in a and a crowd is very, very low. You know, I mean, come on. How many people fucking have kids and you want to take him to a game and then you think about the last time you went to a game, you're like, hey, you know what? I'll wait till the kids a little bit older alum of let's try to extend his fucking childhood a little bit. Okay. People are assholes, you know,

Speaker 1:          00:26:57       that's why like,

Speaker 1:          00:27:00       I dunno, I've been all over the map politically, but it's why like, you know, certain ways of looking at shit, like when people talk about guns land, let's just make them, well, let's just make them illegal and then nobody will have them. You know, like that's sort of like thought process is you're, you're acting as though the world is a utopia and that there's not morons and that there's not, uh, people who say, I don't give a fuck what the rules are. You're totally not even taking into consideration paths, which is why that new fucking thing that Obama signed, that whole defense package where now they can just arrest people without a trial j and put you in jail forever with, without a trial because they just think you're a fucking terrorist. You can't give people that level of power. I'm a fucking moron. And I know you can't do that.

Speaker 1:          00:27:51       Historically, no one has ever handled that level of power. Well, anybody here want to go live in China now we out there practicing your nunchucks wearing your wooden slippers and all of a sudden a van pulls up and you disappear and that's it forever. You want to live there? Of course you don't. You want to live here where they can't fucking do it. Well, they can do it now. You know? They just put in a fucking order for a bunch of black fans. That's what I heard. According to Holy shit.com that's what's going down. I don't understand why stuff at that level that affects citizens to that level. Why we don't get to vote on it.

Speaker 1:          00:28:29       Do you think it's because we'd say, Hey, you know what? Fuck that. Do you want to stand like that is just a jump off point. Do you think like that's just how it's going to swell zone terrorist dinner. You ain't got to fuck bro. You think it's just going to stop with that. That's not how you take away freedom. You don't just fucking do it all at one fail swoop. It's incremental. It's just like when you're dating some fucking woman and you're not paying attention and she just gradually, every day takes another foot of real estate. Next thing you know you're in goal line d going, how the fuck did I end up in this situation? We started at the 50 little push, a little poll, right? Everything was fine. The casino Europe against the Golan, the you think that they're just going to keep it with the terrorist thing, you know? You know they'll wait for a whole nother generation of babies to be born and they always grew up with government having that level of power and then they had something else to it. Then they had something else. Then that's it. You can't have, okay, if tiger woods can't handle the level of free pussy on a golf tour, how the fuck is our government going to handle a new defense package, which basically gave them a mute button

Speaker 1:          00:29:39       when you love that, how would handle that if you had that power, do you, how long before you just started abusing that? If you could just hit mute on anybody who ever disagreed with you and it just, and you could have them whisked away. I mean that is just sociopath's wet dream. That's what that is. That is a fucking mute button, Mr Style. And don't you think that's it? He hit mute. You're done. You're gone. See Ya. I think, I think it's fucking insane and I'm, the only thing that I get out of it is that I feel like I was proven correct that I don't think it matters at that level. Whether you vote Democrat or Republican Obama, the first black president ever, you would think this would be the most liberal a politician in the history of this country because of his background. You would think that he signed off on that shit.

Speaker 2:          00:30:41       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:30:42       All right. I'm telling you, I don't know what happens when you become president, but I think they let you peek just enough behind the curtain and there was a fucking agenda that we are moving towards. Cause it does. I don't think it fucking matters. I really don't, which is why I always vote for the Ralph Nader. The fucking Ron Paul, all those guys that all those fucking idiots go, oh gosh, you did that. You've ruined the election. Really? Did I?

Speaker 2:          00:31:14       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:31:15       I feel like those guys wouldn't have signed shit like that. I feel like their track record shows that they would not sign shit like that. I, I dunno, I have no, I imagine I'm going to get a ton of fucking emails I'm on with somebody who was yelling at me one time saying that because I voted for Ralph Nader in 2000. That's why George W. Bush won. And they were just going on and on and on about it. And I was like, dude, I live in New York. Al Gore won my state. Okay, get a stand that, so your whole fucking theory right now is out the window. I voted for Ralph Nader in New York and Al Gore still won the state. So go fuck yourself. What I'm trying to do, uh, Mister fucking red and blue tie here, I'm trying to fucking encourage more people like that to vote. So mission accomplished. That's what I'm trying to fuck. You have to vote to run.

Speaker 2:          00:32:09       You know

Speaker 1:          00:32:11       uncorruptible how far can you get if you're uncorruptible I would say that you can get to the uh,

Speaker 2:          00:32:19       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:32:21       Whatever level politics is when you decide whether or not they should put a gazebo in the center of town. I think beat. Once you get beyond that, you got, you gotta be a little dirty. Right. I love talking about this shit cause it just stirs people up, you know? Oh you know, maybe you should all read a little before the next time you fucking own. Really. What are you reading? What do you written? What they give you? Is that what you read and fuck head. Why you acting like you have clearance to the bottom floors are the fucking Pentagon. You're guessing? Just like I am. All right, Mr informed I read the pamphlet. I know. Buy a fucking word of it. You know you can use coca cola to take rust off of metal. You can use it for that. You know, you understand that yet they're still able to sell it to us. Like it's refreshing. I don't know what that point meant either. I thought I had a point there. Fuck you. I'm full of sugar and salt. Them crashing right now. Crashing and burning. All right, let's get him on to some more shit here. Uh Oh, I have bill. We had for a good baseball season. I don't, I have no idea. All I know is I am not what the, come on man. Don't fucking do this to me. You fucking cunt.

Speaker 1:          00:33:42       I can't scroll down because I'm getting the pinwheel.

Speaker 1:          00:33:46       Oh Krista, it's time for a commercial. Everybody. amazon.com. Do you like this podcast? No. Well then fucking listen to another one who's left. All right. You guys liked this podcast. Well, thank you. I appreciate it. Um, if you would like to donate to this podcast, it's very easy.

There was the whalers goal song, the Amazon, a banner. You Click on that and then just go buy something. All right? It doesn't change the price. You don't have to put in any passwords, nothing. Just go to amazon.com through my website on the podcast page. You Click on the banner, you buy something, they'll kick me back a percentage and 10% of that will go to the wounded warriors project.

Speaker 1:          00:34:44       So with you going out and buying yourself a new Flowbee, maybe a pen and pencil set, maybe you get yourself a mountain bike because you decided you're finally going to get yourself in shape, right? And rather than just going for a walk, you feel you need to punish your body cause you grew up in the era of Ken Patera, right? Whatever you're going to do just now, when you buy that thing, a little bit of money goes to the Monday morning podcast and 10% of that money goes to help the troops. All right? Killed two birds with one stone. And you could walk down the street and say, you know what? I am a good person. So there you go. All right, let's try and find where these fucking come on. Where the hell of the questions here. And so my question, um, all right.

Speaker 1:          00:35:29       Oh, this is a question about Dave Grohl. Bill, I love the podcast. I wanted to see if you would go on a rant on my behalf. Um, first I would like to start up by saying that I'm a recording engineer and you being a drummer should be upset by this to, okay. He's already dragging me. And uh, during Dave Grohl Grammy Acceptance Speech, he said that their new album was special because they recorded it in his garage with a couple of microphones. Uh, most people would hear that and think that's pretty cool. But this really pisses me off. At what point does a four point $5 million recording studio stop being, uh, being a garage? I mean, it may say it's a garage on the blueprints, but it's not like their drummer is getting his sticks caught in a fishnet. Also, I attached a photo of the drum set that they use during the recording. I counted 13 microphones. That's a lot more than a couple. If it pisses you off at all. I would love to hear your thoughts about it on the podcast. Well look, I think what he was really doing was he was going off on auto tune. So in a roundabout way he, he's helping you out, isn't he?

Speaker 1:          00:36:41       Cause he did do it on a student in a, in a, in a studio. I think it was more ethnic. It was making fun of a auto too, wasn't he? And I'm really trying to give you an example. One of those umbrella Ella Ella a that shit. Right? Wasn't he just kind of making fun of that? He did do it in his garage, surf. At the end of the day, if they took those drums out, he could put one of his 47 cars in there. So technically it is still a garage. He should not have said a couple of microphones if you want to get conti. All right. But you know what? I bet he had an engineer in there, you know, I bet somebody's got some work out of that. I think he's on your team.

Speaker 1:          00:37:26       You know, I'm sorry you went to the wrong guy in this one. Being a drummer, Dave Grohl would basically have to be sacrificing babies before I ever gave them any shit because uh, I have a fan boy crush on him so I can't really trash them because in my twisted fucking narcissistic world, I think I actually have a chance of meeting him and maybe playing drums on one track on his next album. That's, that's the lofty area my ego lives in. You know what I should do one of these weeks, I should actually play drums for you guys or maybe guitar and you can hear a fucking awful I am and then he can trash me and feel better about yourselves. Isn't that fun? Does that make you feel good to watch somebody attempt something and then completely fail and then you get that, that, that, that warm feeling in your chest we you like, see that's what happens when you try. That's what happens when you go after your dreams. I knew I was right by choosing this job that was safe rather than fulfilling. Isn't that what you do fucking cunts? First of all, Mr Engineer, you are in a situation now where you could build your own fucking can't you with

Speaker 3:          00:38:36       like a laptop and a Frisbee. Why don't you start recording all these up and coming bands gets your foot in the fucking door and then as as they rise up, doe maybe they'll take you with them. I think there's an unbelievable fucking opportunity here right now for artists to take control of their fucking careers and not have to have these cons taken all your money, all that fucking behind the music, shit, all these things. You work hard, you recorded a special, you get in business with somebody and then you know,

Speaker 5:          00:39:07       okay,

Speaker 3:          00:39:08       I'm fucking, I'm waiting for money right now. People buy DVDs and I had some out. Doesn't get to me. Oh, we had, we had a hundred grand in whiteout expenses. Sorry Bill. Sorry. No money for you. We're keeping it all ourselves. Then eventually we go out of business and you're chasing a ghost. We all take a bonus out of the money that we owed you and a bunch of other fucking comedians we take off and then you're suing the corporation, which is not a person and nobody works here anymore. So well good luck to you. I understand what you're saying sir. I understand. Okay, let me give day grove a little bit of shit he made. Really did make it sound like, hey man, we just go like a bag of weed and cleared out the rakes in the fucking wheel barrow.

Speaker 6:          00:39:49       We made like an album man. And like that's all you really need to do man. Because like it's all about the music and like if you really believe in it, people can like feel it man. You know what I'm saying? I know he

Speaker 3:          00:40:02       did do that. It did do that. But at the end of the day he did record it at his house. You know, he should've said, I recorded it in what used to be my garage, but what is now the equivalent to recording at capital, and I'll tell you, all you got to be is a monster rock star who's been selling millions of albums for 20 years. And you could do it too. So you don't need autotune boys and girls despite the fact that it puts you right. You know, I read about some fucking, this little spazzy look a nerd and rolling stone who makes some sort of fucking music with, with a Macintosh. Um, which to me, I don't give a fuck is not, it is music, but it isn't. You know what I mean?

Speaker 5:          00:40:56       Okay.

Speaker 3:          00:40:57       This just, I, it's more like you are, it's like you're an editor. I would say it's, it's more like that. Like, I don't, I don't think that what you're doing, it's like you are making music, but you're, you're taking sounds in all this shit that you don't have the, have the ability to make, I guess that one guy that fat Gail made all those, those loops for Justin Timberlake and uh, and Jay Z, who's that guy who have it be pay, pay, pay, pay, pay, pay, pay, Yoda. It's hard to death that that guy, I guess that, yeah. Guy Is,

Speaker 1:          00:41:34       I saw him. He can actually play instruments and shit. Oh, well, you know what I'm, I'm painting with a broad brush here. People, I'm just saying I own, I was saying halfway through that I fucking got lost in, in the sugar of cheesecake at eight in the fucking morning. Um,

Speaker 2:          00:41:49       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:41:50       Was there a point? Oh yeah. I was reading about this fucking nerd, which by the way, people can, can, can nerds go back to being beaten for no fucking reason at all. You know, I, I really can't wait for the backlash on nerds. I've had it with them. I've had it with them and bracing the fact that they're awkward to, to the point of pretending to be awkward even when you're not, and just coming up to you and be and am awkward and then believing all the pressure of the conversation on you. You know, fucking 30, 35 years old walking around acting like some 14 year old on his first date.

Speaker 2:          00:42:28       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:42:30       You know what? Somebody has that this week. Where the hell is it? The overrated, underrated for the weeks, uh, overrated dorks they're taking over and they haven't even done anything cool to earn it. Fuck the office, Dude. I gotta be honest with you. I've been saying that for fucking years. My girl loves that show the office. All right. And I can't fucking watch it. All right. It's like, can somebody on that show be like, be aware of what they're saying when they're saying it instead of like afterwards, immediately afterwards, you know.

Speaker 2:          00:43:06       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:43:06       I, I did like their cartoons.

Speaker 2:          00:43:11       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:43:12       Fucking every goddamn one of those fucking shows. I can't, I can't get into the shit. I can't get into the ship because I'm gonna start trashing shit and then you can think straight across the board that I fucking like anybody in the alt scene. That's not fucking true. But

Speaker 2:          00:43:28       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:43:29       I think, I think the alternative comedy scene is like the hair metal scene in late 1989 all right. We're about a year away before never mind is going to come out and they're all going to be scurried. And I'm going to, I can't fucking wait because I'm just an old country redhead. No, I reside, I actually on, I do resent the, the alternative scene full for one reason only. And that's because that scene created a situation that it basically distilled all of the horror out of attempting to be a comedian. That's what I don't like about it. Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:44:14       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:44:15       No haggling, no drugs, no obnoxious behavior, no aggressiveness from every fucking reason that it takes balls to be a comedian. Every fucking reason why people who wanted to be a comic, but it never fucking did it. You've removed from that situation and you've

Speaker 3:          00:44:32       just created like this fucking comedy womb, you know, and, and on top of that, it's like you're performing to just this, this, it's like a radio station. It's not even a crowd. It's like, what did I go to fucking radio station? I only perform to hipsters ages 18 to 24 who were skinny fucking loose jeans and have black frame glasses. It's like, and then if they have to go down to a fucking comedy club, when they're jokes don't go over, they, they act like the, the crowd is dumb rather than, no, you, you're like a specialist. You like that guy who plays on the football team and only goes out is you like the long snapper. You know what I mean? You can only could play one fucking position and you turn around and you're blaming the fucking crowd. I Dunno dude. I just, it's, it's, and then on top of that, the amount of shots that over the fucking years

Speaker 1:          00:45:27       they've taken a club comics, like we're all a bunch of hacks over there, you know, talking about

Speaker 3:          00:45:32       plain food. Like they're above us. And then every fucking to, I got to talk to Bob and talked to Bobby Kelly about this shit on his podcast. Hopefully this week, cause we were talking about some of this shit. And anytime then what happens is right then you go to do some benefit or you going to do some sort of fucking comedy festival and then they put club comics and all comics together. And what happens? All those fucking, all comics go on early. You know, one in particular is always fucking trading up. He can't go on early enough despite the fact his face is all over the fucking posters. And then who's got a mop up in the end, two hours into the fucking show, a club comic, you know, uh, those fucking all comics and they're all fucking nice to you on those shows. He raises his real Dick van. You clicking really? Are you? Are you, they're nervous. Go on second, go on third and then fucking run out with your book bag. You can't, ah, the flood gates have opened. I've had it. I've had it with fucking nervous.

Speaker 1:          00:46:34       I've, I've, I've, I've fuck it. I get it. I get it. All right, you're into comic con. I get it. And if you're not into comic con, then you're fucking stupid. Is that basically what it is?

Speaker 3:          00:46:47       Cheesecake baby. It's the cheesecake. Just for the record. The old scene was started by club comics. All those guys, David Cross, Bob Odenkirk, Dana Gould, Mark Marin, beast, all of them,

Speaker 1:          00:47:02       all of them, they could perform in fucking, uh, an offtrack betting and they could have a great set.

Speaker 3:          00:47:11       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:47:13       But inadvertently I think, you know what they did, they're almost like rich people who have kids, you know, and they, they, they struggled up through all this shit, right? And then they just have these kids in their first car is like a Maserati and they wrap it around a pole and there's like no ramification. That's that. That is my overall generalization of my problem that I have with the AllSeen is, um,

Speaker 1:          00:47:36       it's, it's like, uh, it's like standup comedy while wearing like the training wheels and he never take them off. Okay, bill, we got it. You've, you've made, you've, you've, you've made your, your fucking one sided argument. Um, all right, there we go. That out against some fucking emails that aren't into it. I'm trying to be controversial this week and other overrated, chasing your dreams. Stay home. Jesus Christ. How many hugs did you not get, sir? Um, although that's funny. Uh, underrated, uh, watching a whole series on Netflix in three weeks. Is there anything, is there anything better than being able to skip commercials and weeks of waiting for Shit to happen? Who cares about spoilers? From what I understand, die hard. Fans of loss. Can't even explain the last episode. No spoilers there Jr is dead and I'll never go back and watch Dallas. Um,

Speaker 1:          00:48:30       I think it's good. It's good and bad because when, when you, uh, the anticipation of it coming out, you know, like when people had to wait for the next Beatles album, what are they going to do? How they're going to top the next one. And then you'd go out, you fucking stand in line to get it and you sit down and wait. It becomes like an event. Um, it's like having a slice of cake rather than eating the whole fucking cake. You know what I mean? So, but I do, I do know what you're saying. Um, and the whole fast forwarding through commercials and that type of thing, I actually, I do enjoy doing that. I do enjoy doing that. Even though I have commercials on my, I'm such a fucking hypocrite. It's ridiculous. And speaking to that, how about another commercial right now, what are we going to go with people?

Speaker 1:          00:49:13       What are we going to go with? What happens? You're heard me say stamps.com everybody. Hey this, this, this is something that we've all been going to our entire lives. Something called the post office. Okay. And we go down there with those crabby people. You know who they can't get fired unless the union boss says it's okay. Right. And that down, they're leaning on shovels. You asking for stamps am on break. And they sit there with their fucking chewing tobacco spitting into a spittoon. Right. Would it be great if you could just have your own little post office in your apartment in the garage like Dave Grohl right next to your drum set with the 52 microphones on? It. Would it be great if you could just totally,

Speaker 3:          00:49:52       you know, it'd be like if he could somehow have the DMV

Speaker 5:          00:49:55       okay

Speaker 1:          00:49:56       in your apartment and just take your own picture and make your own, damn, I

Speaker 3:          00:50:00       wouldn't that be great. They're not going to let you do it because it's all part of the new world order man. But you can have the post office in your house. Wouldn't that be fantastic? Would it be great to just be able to print out stamps? Said you could put on an envelope using your computer and a little piece of paper. Wouldn't it be phenomenal to have your own damn scale where you could weigh things? It'd be that's how much it weighs and here's the zip code. How much does that cost? Would it be wonderful to be able to do that completely naked at two in the morning while eating a pop tart? Well, with stamps.com you can do it. You can buy and print us postage official US postage as opposed to that bootleg stuff that's been out there. All right. Um, what's going on with my computer?

Speaker 3:          00:50:42       I got to get a new one. This one's full. Um, you can buy and print official US postage using your own computer and printer stand, stop. Chrom we'll give you a digital scale. Just plug it into you computer way. Your letter or a package. The exact amount of the postage will automatically appear on the screen. And I got to tell you, they're not lying there because I've done it. I had shipped DVDs to the four core as it is country and I am, he had to say, ask not what your scale could do for you. Uh, endorsement stamps.com is like having a postal expert right at my desk expert. I don't know about that. It's like having a postal guy right at your desk, except he doesn't have an attitude. How about that? There's never any guesswork. Um, and you never have to go to the post office.

What are we 53 minutes in, 53 minutes into this podcast and I'm going to try to upload and I'm not going to be able to cause my, my stupid thing is full, despite the fact that I've removed all pictures and put them onto an external hard drive. All right, where

Speaker 1:          00:53:26       are we? Male dance. Let's read this bill. Bit of a bit of a dilemma here for you. Oh, before I do this, why don't I give you guys emails cause a lot of you guys are like, Bill, I have things that I would like to be read in a bad way, in a second grade manner on the podcast. Where do I email you decide you can email me, you can email me@billatthemmpodcast.com. Don't forget that the all right bill at the [inaudible] podcast.com and MMP is all capitalized. All right, bill@themmpodcast.com and you can tell me to go fuck myself. You can ask me questions, you can ask advice, she can do whatever you want. Um, and that is, it built bit of a dilemma here for Ya. Uh, I'm an 18 year old male who's about to graduate from high school. Congratulations. Um, over the past few years I've been told I'm a really good dancer. Uh, not ballet or artsy stuff, but just good dance floor dancing. Oh my God, I'm going to take over the dance floor. Hey Angie, who watched me? You're John Travolta. This is great. Do you go out to the, uh, Staten Island Bridge and do headstands with your, with your buddy Bobby?

Speaker 1:          00:54:36       You know, if he didn't have an Afro, he never would have fell off that bridge. If you had it high and tight. Like all these Armenians out here, all, every Armenian looks like they know, uh, they, they know, um, um, MMA moose, last time you saw an our Armenian dude in his twenties or thirties, and he did not look like he could put you in an arm bar within two seconds if you want it to. If I were, if I was a Dana white and I was running the UFC at one point at this point, what they're up to like what? Like UFC 2006, you know, they're like, run it, they've run out of adjectives this time. It's really, really personal, right? Not Saying I'm not a fan, I'm a huge fucking fan. I'm just saying, you know, the way they have those things, like every other week, there's only so many, like, you know, redemption.

Speaker 1:          00:55:25       I mean, you've running out of words. Um, I'm such a fucking idiot. This is what I would do if I was dating white at some point I would have, you know, you know what I would, this is what I would branch off. And when they had those tough man competitions and they would have just people coming in, throwing haymakers, which is some of the best boxing ever is when you watch people who just aren't trained whatsoever and they just start, you know, cause somebody's going to connect, right? I think that they should have one week they should have the Armenians verse the Russians tough man competition, because I really think that that needs, it needs to be decided who is the tougher of the two, uh, cause up more now when it comes to white people. That's, that's who I got my money on. All right. That, those, those are the crips and the bloods of white people is the army and the Russians, all of them, they just have that vibe. Does something you just like. Yeah. I'm not fucking with that guy. Just really, I'm really not doing it anyways. Uh, not

Speaker 3:          00:56:24       a ballet or artsy stuff, but just ballroom dance in a full contention over here. Uh, I kind of think of think dancing is gay from an outside point of view. Um, I, I, it isn't, it really isn't, that's just how white people look at it. It's considered gay cause it involves like letting yourself go and actually admitting that you have emotions as a man, as a white male. Yeah. It's constant. Yeah, it is. It's considered gay. Um, as his crying, as is showing any sort of emotion as is not dying for no good God damn reason before you 56, um, oh, not dying. I should say. If you live to be 60, I believe amongst white men, that's also considered gay. Cause that means at some point you cried something out of your chest and you didn't have a heart attack. Um, anyways, he says, I think a dancing is gay from an outside point of view, but I'll be the first one to admit that I'm actually a pretty good dancer if I didn't think so, I wouldn't be out there doing it. Yeah. But Dude, you gotta be getting some, I'll fucking women love a guy who can dance, dude. If you can dance and you were in like a silk scarf, it's fucking over. It's going to be rain in Pussy. As far as my outside view, my freckled view from over in the bar trying to stand out from underneath those hot lights so I don't get burned. Uh, you know, red heads were the closest thing to vampires. You know, we have, we have none of the powers of vampires, but the sun affects us the same way.

Speaker 5:          00:57:58       Okay.

Speaker 3:          00:57:59       A friend of mine who was a female dancer keeps telling me I could make money doing it on commercials or music videos. Parentheses close on. Or You could go to fucking Broadway. It'd be like one of the five straight men who dances on Broadway and just tag every fucking lonely chick out there who's all stretched out. Just make sure you keep those shoes on. Dancers' feet are always fucked up. Uh, here's where it gets complicated. I plan on becoming a policeman.

Speaker 5:          00:58:29       Okay?

Speaker 3:          00:58:29       Oh Dude, this is, this is a no brainer. You need to dance it. Bachelorette parties dressed as a cop. All you need, dude, is that a fake uniform on a boombox and you're on your way to making money? Dude, you should fucking do that in a second. And then you write a book about it. I was a gyrate and cop for Bachelorette parties and you write a tell all book about how many fucking broads, who bought ready got married? You get married, sucked your Dick. You really need help on this one. I mean, I'm going to read the rest of it, but I think I've already come with a solution anyways. How is anyone supposed to take me seriously on the force? If there's a video going with me, pop and locking next to little Wayne at the same time, I'll, dude, you should fucking pull people over.

Speaker 5:          00:59:11       Yeah,

Speaker 3:          00:59:11       you should pull people over and fucking moon. Walk up to their car and just freak them out. Even if they were reaching for a gun, they'd be laughing too hard and they, they, they wouldn't shoot you. Then you could rest them and then you move. Next thing you know you're a commissioner, right? Nothing. Anyways, at the same time, I'm getting laid a lot because of it. Of course you are. I'm a seven on a scale of 10. I like this guy. He's honest and um, uh, and like having a jump shot. It's put me up to an eight five I'm bang and tense. I've always wanted to be a cop at the parks here. Seen better if I was able to make money doing it. Other than the dancing thing, I wouldn't just be getting Hummerus for letting gross moms off on speeding tickets. I could be bagging J lo. She's into dancers. Right? Thanks. Yeah, Dude. Apps a Fuckin lutely dude. You're basically saying, what should I do here?

Speaker 5:          01:00:06       Okay.

Speaker 3:          01:00:07       Should I bang j Lo's beat down at the club and make all this fucking money or should I take a job where I'm going to get shot at and not be appreciated?

Speaker 5:          01:00:17       Okay.

Speaker 3:          01:00:18       You know, I'll tell you every cop out there with dance, if they could, as opposed to being a cop, I don't care if they had like seven generations.

Speaker 5:          01:00:25       Yeah.

Speaker 3:          01:00:25       Dude, this is what I think of as far as like dancing. I think if I, if I,

Speaker 5:          01:00:32       yeah,

Speaker 3:          01:00:32       like compare it to being a comedian. Oh, the open mics would be getting a piece of cardboard and being on a subway platform, making money that way. And then

Speaker 5:          01:00:43       yeah,

Speaker 3:          01:00:43       when you move up to hosting a show that would be addressed as a cop and you fucking dance at Bachelorette parties. That's what you do on the side. That's like you fucking day job. That bullshit. And then during the day, I, yeah, I would try out for those. Fuck, I don't, do they make music videos anymore or fucking, uh, I dunno. I believe it or not, I don't know how to climb the ladder as a dancer. But dude, apps a Fuckin lutely if you can make money doing that shit.

Speaker 1:          01:01:13       And then what the great thing is, is once you get to a certain level to, to, uh, make more money, you don't want, you got some credibility. You can know, you always have the fall back where you can teach a class, they get, you can be like I danced for nine years and Chitty Chitty Bang Bang and fucking banged every fucking broad on there. And then you, if you'd like to not have, fuck the women in your cast while still not losing your job, come on down to Frankie's swapping, Dade Studio, whatever. Just you'll figure it out as you go in there. And um, yeah, absolutely. Absolute fucking Luli. I would definitely do it. You want to do it? He wouldn't taken the time, um, to write in. So your big fears, she'll be whatever. But everybody's big fear is like, what if I fucking go after this dream and I'm 30 and I'm sleeping on a Fuckin futon and it hasn't happened yet.

Speaker 1:          01:02:03       Well I've got to tell you something sir. I've been there. I was there at fucking 34. I was still sleeping on a Futon in a fucking studio apartment that they called a one bedroom cause they slammed a fucking wall in there and put a door on it. And then one day I was trying to bang the girl upstairs who had the fucking apartment right above me, and it was exact same unit and hers was a studio, but she had been there longer so they never slammed a wall in there. And I realized, Hey, wait a minute, I'm getting fucked. You know, I should go down there and try to get some money taken off of this. I should go down to the, uh, they're fucking me over rental board. But I didn't, I said, fucking just keep writing jokes, right. So whatever, oh, you gotta do, you just got to commit to this shit and uh, and then realize that, you know, sleep on the Futon when you're 30 is, is not the worst thing.

Speaker 1:          01:02:48       It isn't. You don't see, you know, it's worse than sleeping on futons at 30, sleeping in a king bed next to a fuck a woman you're not really love with, but for some reason married and he got a couple of kids and you've got a job that you fucking hate. Okay? You'll be laying there fantasizing about fucking sleeping on a, on a, on a, uh, on a futon there. There's no risk when you go after a dream, it's all fucking reward. It's all going to lead to something good. It always does. There's a tremendous amount of risk to playing it safe and uh, that leads to unbelievable levels of regret, which is something else. I've also experienced it because I'm an old mother fucker. Um, so that's it. That's the podcast for this week. Okay. If you want to dance, if you want to get stamps, I think I fucking covered everything.

Speaker 3:          01:07:37       Um, um, oh, here's one for you. You know something I was telling you what really bothered me was when Davy Jones died, just really fucking bothered me. Just really made me feel old. I'd love the monkeys. I thought they were hilarious. And I love their music. And you know what's funny is I was reading all this shit, the amount of crap that they got because they were a prefab. They called him the prefab for because it was just a TV show and they were basically, it was basically the Beatles meets, meets the, uh, the Marx brothers and all this shit that they went through. But I always find it funny when you go on Youtube and every music thing, you know, if you, if you go, when you look up

Speaker 1:          01:08:16       something and some sort of music that people respect it. Like what happened to music and people always trashing Justin Bieber going, what happened to music? I wish I was born back in the fucking day. Well, here's something that I read. Do you know what the height of the monkeys fame? They sold more albums than the Beatles and the rolling stones combined. All right. So it's always been that way. There's always been some fucking hottie going, oops. At dd to again at played with your part, right?

Speaker 2:          01:08:46       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:08:46       Shaking her fucking hips. It's always going to be that,

Speaker 2:          01:08:49       okay,

Speaker 1:          01:08:50       Barry Manilow that song, Mandy, you blah, and you bleed and you blue blue, and I wanna fuck you. Now, Mandy, right when Zeppelin was doing what the fuck they were doing, when a, when fucking black Sabbath was at the height of their powers, when they brought the devil to their fucking knees, right?

Speaker 1:          01:09:15       Or to his knees or whatever the fuck it is that there was people making fucking, I'm Henry the eighth die Yam. It's, it's always been like that. So please, if you go on Youtube, can you please stop writing what happened to music? Nothing has happened to it. All right? What's the matter? Does it take work to find the good music? You lazy costs. Go out and go find it. All right, that's the podcast for this week. Go fuck yourselves. Don't take any shit. I'll talk to you next week. And, uh, please keep up. Please keep emailing the, uh, the podcast because I can't, I can't do this thing with just me and cheesecake alone. All right? And I think that that's one to grow on.
