Speaker 1:          00:00:01       Is this on? Is this all right? Here we go. Hey, what's going on? It's bill burn. It's time for the Monday morning podcast for mine. Gay Monday? Yes. October. Uh, what's today? The 28th 29th the 30th it's going to be the 30th this is my first live. Whenever I'm sitting on, I'm at the very best it very metro sexual couch. This looks like a lot of guys blue. Other guys on this thing. This is, this is sort of the reverse w hotel. The way they have this thing like the w hotel. It just looks like everything's been just on and then a bunch of Yolo Douche has had a threesome. There is something this looks like. Is there like a gay chain of hotels that just caters to gay people?

Speaker 1:          00:00:48       You don't see, this is why this is going to be weird with the live crowd because to me that was no big deal. Everybody got real quiet. They're like, it's like that was a problem. Is he trashing gay people or why is he saying that there should be segregated hotels? No, I am not. Okay. I'm just saying that it would be nice if you could separate them from the general population in the hotels. Okay. That's what I'm running on. I'm going to out hate Trump and fucking, whenever the next stupid election is going to be, I'm going to out hate them. I'm just going to start calling him a pussy and I'm just going to fucking, I'm going to hate even more than him. Then I'm going to get elected and then I'll tear down whatever part of the wall he made, which I know is a hot button issue here in Arizona. Oh yeah. They should have the wall. Oh, they should. They shouldn't. Um, yeah, that's what I would run on a platform. I would run on a platform that gay people should have their own hotels.

Speaker 1:          00:01:46       I'm so sick of walking into lobby, seeing men holding hands with other men. It just started off on something bizarre like that, just so I can watch my opponent going, wait a minute. I never even thought about hating this. You know, why won't Hillary Clinton go away? Why can't you just understand that nobody likes her? She just fucking hanging around just like that fucking kid who just shows up. Nick, nobody tell her this a party and then she shows up. You know? You know what happened with her and no one ever poured blood on her at a fucking prom. That's what they should have done to finally fucking get rid of her. You know, she just keeps hanging around like she's a winner. You know? Did Jim Kelly hang around after losing four fucking super bowls? He didn't. He fucking disappeared. And every once in a while an NFL crew finds the fucking guy and goes, hey Jim, let's talk about your career.

Speaker 1:          00:02:42       Yeah, I don't want to, I really, I really don't want to. I did have a great career, but all you want to dwell on the negative. Oh my God. She says, she says she tries to me, you know, she's gonna fucking, she's going to take volume. You still can't hear it louder. All right. This was the dumbest for you guys listening at home who can hear this? Totally fine. There's like 500 people staring at me right now bitching that they can't hear it. So I'm holding a microphone with the yellow wind screen and a little fucking lapel mic. All right. As far as I can tell, only the foreigners for some reason can't fucking hear me. Everybody has some sort of Australia and x six

Speaker 1:          00:03:29       that's fucking people. Foreigners coming in. What the fuck did you come here for to tell us how fucked up our country is? I love when people come here and they said bitching about this country. It's just like, Dad, I don't do that. When they go to Australia, talking about how fucked up your country is that only around the edges? Is it livable? It's fucking unbelievable. If you can't see the ocean, you just completely, you're in no man's land. No Man's land. 200 of the most poisonous fucking snakes ever. Do I say that when I go to Australia? No, I don't. I just go, oh, look at the surf. Oh my God. It's gorgeous. Absolutely beautiful. Look at that sad Tanguy blowing into that giant horn. I bet he used to own this view way back in the day that his ancestors did.

Speaker 1:          00:04:17       What is the, what is the call on that? You know what I mean? I never understand that. When I was in fucking Canada, the rule was what they, what did they say? Like I, I called them the, uh, the natives, the natives of, of Canada, and they got all fucking offended. They said, we're called the originals. He, Reginald everything with Canada's, he original six, the original people, you know what I mean? The original recipe of whatever fucking syrup they're trying to sell you. You know what I mean? Tiny. Everybody loves Canada and like, they're a bunch of friendly people. They're not, they're all bunch of fucking racist sticky people. They're in a bad mood from yanking that SAP out of the fucking trees. And then what do they do? They kick all the indigenous people all the way up north, you know, to give him a perimeter between them and the polar bears. That's what happened. You know, you ever see any of these big Hollywood types talking about them? Meryl Streep? You know, I don't know why I picked her. I'm still pissed at her that she said the martial arts or not the arts. Oh really? What would you know about that? Oh, I get it. You wear a wig and you pretend to be other people. Like by all means, let me listen to you about social issues. You get your fucking God damn car to go back to your gated community.

Speaker 1:          00:05:34       When does she ever see minorities? Huh? When she's looks into the front seat of whoever's driving.

Speaker 2:          00:05:43       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:05:43       By all means, Merrill. Tell me, tell me what society is like from behind your gated community. Um, somebody told me today that it's, it's there, this legislation right now going through. I don't, where does it go through the government? Um, right now I'm thinking the school schoolhouse rock songs. Right now I'm just a bill. Yes. I'm only a bill and then it's off to the White House where there's something something and then it comes back to a bunch of white men and they vote to see if it will be a low, um, how I hope and pray. Normally I wouldn't sing in public, but I feel like I'm in my bedroom. I have plush furniture like this in my bedroom. We're going that one with the fucking overhang. Sorry. Did this go out again with the, sorry, sorry. I'm sorry to each and every one of you, especially the millennials. I'm sure you're fucking hurt about it and you're going to Hashtag some sort of me too. Me Too. I couldn't hear either. Me Too. Me Too. I also had something bad happen.

Speaker 2:          00:06:51       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:06:52       Hey, here's something you can say in this country. Three fucking meals a day may tow me to first world country. Me, Joe,

Speaker 1:          00:07:02       flatscreen TV, me, Joe, everybody dwelling on the negative is fucking feminist, man. I swear to God, I want to go to one of their events and just get up to that microphone and just be like, excuse me, can I, is there anything good about being a woman at any point during your day? Are you like, thank God I'm a woman, or I would have had to step in that muddy, that mud puddle, whatever the fuck I'm supposed to do. I'm supposed to take my fucking coat off, you know? Oh, a little more respect for these feminists when they care a little bit more about guys, jackets, you know, it's always a fucking issue that they care about. You know it. In the 70s we were forced to wear clogs in a lot of our mothers blew out their ACO. Sam gives a shit. I'll listen to a feminist, but not if she's white. You know what I mean? It's like, you know, I won't. Okay. At the end of the day, you were a white woman in the United States of America. What is the problem? Huh? Did someone take away your Ros√© for the afternoon? Did they shut down the fucking trolley down at the mall? What? What is happening in your world? No, seriously. All right. Look, if you live in some honey booboo lifestyle, right? You're living off the appellation. Somebody got rickets in Lyme disease, right?

Speaker 1:          00:08:24       Husband never wear a shirt. You know what I mean?

Speaker 1:          00:08:30       It is. Where's that long underwear with the trap drawer behind the back. You know what I mean? You know he's going out when he puts on his best overalls, right? Those guys have it right. Those guys know how to live out there. If you truly want to get along with the woman you've got to live on right off the Appalachian trail, you know you gotta be off the grid and you just have to have no television. Okay. And then you can slap her around you want and she's never going to know. This is just how it is. You know what I mean? If you have a dirt floor, like taking a beating, it's not the big, it just seems like party of life. It's like seamless. The worst thing we ever did for women is linoleum and like wall to wall carpet. Then we lost all of our power. Yeah, you've seen it. When Twitter first came out, women were just hashtagging whatever you say and now somebody is going to take a snippet of that. They put it on a fucking new show and then I'm going to get in trouble. Are you trying to say that women deserve to be beaten on dirt floors and at that point you just got to go with it. Just be like, yes, and I'm running for president and fucking 20, 20.

Speaker 1:          00:09:51       It don't even get me started with the gays in the hotels.

Speaker 2:          00:09:57       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:09:57       That's right. You run the most hateful fucking campaign ever, but you don't wear the confederate flag, but all of your suits, if you look quickly have all the colors of it. Alright. And then in the end you just totally flipped the whole thing. You flipped toll. Think you have an openly gay guy is a fucking, uh, like sit-com level gay, you know what I mean? Not like real gay, like TV, gay, you know what I mean?

Speaker 2:          00:10:27       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:10:28       TV, gay. It's kind of like when you watch wrestling, how they enhance their personalities. That's what they do with, with gay people. Bill on TV, they got to just go fucking through the roof with the SAS. You know what I mean? Rather than just having a coming out. Surprisingly, every once in a while, um, I don't know what I'm talking about. It feels like, what does this feel that come along of, I'm a doing up here. Oh, 10 minutes and 48 seconds. There you go. This is my world. This is my life. This is what I do. This couch is not, this couch is, feels like it was made out of old coats, like a couple of old tarps or some shit like that. I hate, I was trying to be plush. This was considered like right here. This was considered fancy in the 70s. If I could just get this lapel Mike up here. This, this, anytime there was a button that was sunk all the way in it to try and make this look plush. You know, even though it feels like fucking week old bread that you lay in on.

Speaker 2:          00:11:25       Yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:11:26       honey, all I want is the key. This is what I literally have to do. I have to fucking put the mic down here. It just won't clip on in any fucking area. That is acceptable. Now the people at home can't hear it probably cause I clipped it onto them. This was like the biggest lapel ever. There we go. She's just going to got a bumblebee thought was supposed to be like barely noticeable, isn't it? Um, all right. You know what? I don't give a fuck. Let's, let's read about some, let's up some Phoenix news here. Phoenix News, Ladies and gentlemen. Let's see what's going on.

Speaker 3:          00:11:59       Greater feed eggs. You know what this shows reminding me of. Do you guys remember when cheers went off the air at Jay Leno?

Speaker 2:          00:12:58       No.

See ladies, it goes both ways. Women also beat men.

Speaker 1:          00:14:06       You know what I mean? Can the kid walk? Is it big enough to make a fist? You know what I mean? There's no excuse to hit a woman. So if this kid was punching on her, you know, cause it wanted to breastfeed or some shit, then I think she had every right to just pick him up by his osh gosh bikash's or whatever. Push them right off that plastic pony. A Phoenix woman who's been, who has, who had been reported missing earlier this month along with a three year old boy. Now face is child abuse charges in a case. Court documents says, I'm not going to say her name, but I swear to God to first name books like Tequila. Uh, 21 was arrested Thursday on suspicion of one count of child abuse in connection with injuries to the toddler. Oh, shake it off. Investigation

Speaker 3:          00:14:52       said in a court dog, I'm to see how far into the beating of a child I can go. Just how quiet this crowd's going to get. Uh, the child was beaten on its birthday because it wasn't happy with the cake.

Speaker 3:          00:15:10       The suspect said, well, if he didn't like the cake, you're surely not going to like this lit candle. All right, I'm not reading the rest of this. I'm not reading the rest of this. This is too sad. I don't know what is wrong. I take this bag. This is fun. Make. Could you guys fucking really uncomfortable? I'm enjoying the shit out of this. Let's read some more sad news in Phoenix. Let's see how far down we can. By the way, you can feel the downtown here. It's about ready to blow up. I'm telling you, you got a great food area down the street. You got, uh, you got an arena. There's a cvs. C'Mon man, that you, I can feel it. I sense this and Cleveland and it turned around. I knew it was going to happen in Detroit. And who's kidding? Who Phoenix is the Detroit of the southwest. It is. You just never had a riot because you don't let African Americans in your state. That's what, yes, that's what it is. Who suits says no to a day off. You guys ought to be ashamed of yourselves. All right. What else? Okay. Local headlines. This is the one I'll, I'll end it with this here. I don't want to shit on you guys too much. All right. Uh, valley traffic closures. That's not exciting. Uh, thank you for backing that up, man. No, it isn't. I did not pay money to come out and listen to you to do the traffic report and I can listen to it on my am radio. Thank you very much.

Speaker 3:          00:16:39       County offers free dog adoptions to ease the crowding. All right, let's talk. Okay. We already got a fucking beat up kid. Let's talk about abused animals. Is My dog where in there? No, my dog lives in a house out here that I bought for it. So go fuck yourself.

Speaker 3:          00:17:01       What was happening is, is the amount of money that I was spending to board the dog was less than a mortgage out here. So I said fuck it. And I set up like a Hugh Hefner lease with my trainer. It's like, all right, as long as the dog's alive, you live here, rent free and you take care of it. And I come out and visit whenever I want. He's like, cool. I go when the dog dies, uh, then you know, you either buy the house so you leave it, you start renting it. He was like, cool. So you know damn well that dog's getting fucking sirloin every night. It's clear. The dog's name is Cleo and she barely remembers me now because she's getting treated so well and fucking house is nicer than my one in La. Um, so there you go, Mr. Guilt trip over there. Now let's talk about, let's talk about

Speaker 1:          00:17:50       this shit over here. Let's talk about what you guys do to dogs in this state. What is with this fucking advertising? Yeah. Am I on Netflix? What happened?

Speaker 2:          00:18:04       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:18:05       Coca Cola. We are so much more than colon. Yeah, you're fucking gum disease. Whereas Nia, she's right backstage. She'll be out in a minute. Tom fucking with you.

Speaker 1:          00:18:38       Anybody watching that Texas tech, Oklahoma Game. Jesus. It was like no fucking difference in that man. None whatsoever. Um, by the way, thank you to everybody here. Thank you. Thank you to everybody here. That is, that has come out to the all things, comedy, podcasts, a network, our first ever podcast festival. It's been a smashing success. Did you guys see when you walked in? We had them. We had Caddyshack playing outside. You can play that a corn hole fucking game. You can drink a bunch of beers. This is what it's all about. It's all about hanging out, getting fucked up, listening to morons who don't know how to read, do podcasts. That's what this entire thing is all about. All right. What do you guy huge still, what about those fucking Houston Astros going up two to one, two to one against the La Dodgers. I don't know who to root for in this one.

Speaker 1:          00:19:26       Cause you know I live in Los Angeles. You know, I know Houston just had that hurricane, but it's over, right? Everything dried up. Whose fans look all happy and dry when you watched the gay me almost so much to the point I was just going to look out nicest looks. What was all the fucking complaining about? Jesus Christ. It rains a little bit and everybody out in Houston starts losing their fucking minds. You know? Do you think one of them has ever sent a postcard to Seattle? Those poor people sit in rain, but like 360 days out of the fucking year, I will guarantee you not a fucking peep. Not a peep from Houston. Houston. Jesus. What is shady city? That is, Huh? NASA. How many people down there do you think? I bet that whole fucking Houston, that whole fucking hurricane. I bet it didn't even happen. I bet they just let some damn water go down there. And it was all only excuse to kill the last few people alive that, that were part of the fake lunar landing reenactment at NASA. So they got rid of them

Speaker 2:          00:20:36       and uh, what

Speaker 1:          00:20:37       else goes on in Houston? They got the clan right outside there that drags people to death, which I'm suppliers didn't get an applause break here in fucking Arizona. MMM,

Speaker 2:          00:20:52       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:20:52       There was one other thing. What the fuck was I talking about? I was talking about now, then they got Halliburton, Halliburton. That changed their fucking name. I know, I know. I know. We're over there to fucking, what are we doing over there? We're, we're, we're concerned about their freedom. We've got to get these Iraqis to be free. Um, oh, when it gets awkwardly silent here, um, oh, you know what I did. So anyways, I think I'm going to be, I think I'm gonna. I'm gonna tell you right now why the fucking Astros are going to win the world series. Okay? I'm going to tell you why it's going to happen. It has nothing to do with baseball. It has to do the fact with dead. Jason, lie ahead, is rooting for the Dodgers. He's here tonight. Jason [inaudible] head grew up in Cleveland. All right. He's fucked.

Speaker 1:          00:21:40       Okay. Like the second you come out of the womb, that curse of that city just engulfed him. And everywhere he goes, he's like the mush and a a Bronx tale. Just tear up your fucking tickets, la. It's over. You're not going to win another game. Um, no, I have no idea. I'm actually rooting that there's going to be a, there's going to be seven gapes. I hope it will be seven games. Give me something to do. Um, I don't know that there's going to be seven games. Do you know that there's going to be seven games, sir? Does somebody know? Oh, because of the money you had thinks it's all about the money. That's why it'll give. That's why I don't give to charities anymore. I'm done with fucking charities. Only give one fucking dime to Houston. Okay. Do you want to walk up to me up to your neck and water with a, I live in Houston hat. Then I'm going to give you money.

Speaker 2:          00:22:29       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:22:30       All right. But I'm not giving to any of these fucking things anymore because they're these fucking organizations. They keep the, I'm, I'm convinced that the most of them, they just, they just keep the fucking money. That's what's, anytime you see a tragedy, just know that there's a bunch of people going like, I can make a bunch of fucking money off of that Hashtag I care too. Right. And then you give them $20 you feel like you did your part. You know what I mean? How much money they think Trump collected before he went over there with those bounty paper towels. It just handed them out in Puerto Rico. He must've made a fucking killing. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:23:03       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:23:03       Probably spent the rest on hair plugs and fucking, I don't understand how he became a red head as he got older. I don't understand. He had brown hair.

Speaker 1:          00:23:13       Six, somebody transitioning like I don't get somebody like changes religions. Um, not all of this is gonna make sense everybody. You can't still can't fucking hear me. I don't know what to do. Should I stick this in my fucking mouth thing? Could you hear me all right. How's that? Is that good? Does this work? Is this working for both of you? Maybe if I clip this onto the, onto the microphone. Um, Jesus Christ. You know what this feels like right now. This feels like when I was in summer school and was just staring at the fucking clock like 23 minutes,

Speaker 3:          00:23:46       23 minutes. Jesus Christ. Why did I wear a sweatshirt out here?

Speaker 2:          00:23:52       MMM.

Speaker 3:          00:23:53       Oh, by the way, I got to do, I got to do a promotion. I got to do a promotion. I saw, I went to a movie premiere, uh, of the 30 for 30. The nature boy, ric flair is coming out.

Speaker 3:          00:24:08       I have to tell you this right now. Might be the best 30 for 30. I have a fucking saw. Um, it should be not it actually it is 90 minutes. It is 90 minutes. I thought it was only 30 minutes, so it was 90 minutes, sir. It wasn't your dream came true. See that everybody, I'm going to start a charity for this guy and a portion of the proceeds are going to go to towards him. The rest of them are going to go to me and a new fucking drum kit. I'll put his picture on the bass drum head each day. Thousands of people are dying of cancer and I want a boat. If you call this number,

Speaker 2:          00:24:53       Aye,

Speaker 3:          00:24:54       we can put a slight dent in it and I can get the boat of my fucking dreams and finally get rid of my wife and start living openly with my mistress. Please take the number down. The first 300 people that call in, we'll get a free tee shirt with a donation of over three times the cost to produce this tee shirt. No one will check to see if the t shirts were actually sent out. That's the move people. There's two fucking this three moves to making this country at this point. If you want to exist in the future one, you either grow weed in anticipation that it becomes legal at a federal level and you can get it out of your fucking state. Cause I know in Colorado they're, I guess they're drowning in the shit. They got more weed than they got hippies. They got more. Oh my God, I got to tell you that the dirtiest look and white people you're ever going to see in your life

Speaker 2:          00:25:54       are in Colorado.

Speaker 3:          00:25:57       I can't imagine being a minority in Colorado looking at the white people there. You gotta be thinking like, how the fuck are we working for these people? How were these people running? Shit. I mean, everybody just looks like they fell into a vat of put Chuli. Right. You know, are they always inner tubing and shit? They just live outside that just, I don't know that that's like in the Denver area, you know? Then you get out in the western part of the states and then, then it gets better. You know you got the Illuminati is in the rocky mountains, you know what I mean? They make sure it stays nice and cold up there. So the body of their first wife never, it never melts away. You know what I mean? That's what they keep doing it.

Speaker 2:          00:26:41       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:26:43       That's the code word. What you're going skiing with your third wife today? Yeah. We're going on the double black diamond. That's code for, I'm going to fucking steer into a tree. You know, that's what's going to happen when global warming really hits and all the snow melts up in fucking aspen and Vail. The amount of dead women that are going to be underneath there, the amount of first wives, the before I made my first million love, you know what I mean? When I was at the college level before I went pro, you know, I dunno. Sometimes I think you ought to be able to kill your first wife though

Speaker 2:          00:27:19       because

Speaker 1:          00:27:20       there's like too many people on the planet and then also could maybe like put them on their heels. Not saying you do it, but just the fact that she would know it was okay. I think from where I sit, whatever really positive effect on the relationship, I think the reality television viewing would go down.

Speaker 2:          00:27:43       MMM,

Speaker 1:          00:27:47       I should do these more because with you guys laughing, I won't get in trouble. You know what I mean? It's when I'm by myself and there's dead silence. It stops sounding like I'm fucking around. And it sounds more like, is this guy reading from his own manifesto?

Speaker 2:          00:28:05       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:28:08       Yeah. The audit come up with creative ways to get rid of people. I guess the optimal number, according to something that somebody sent me is 500 million people on this planet and we're up to 6.5 billion. So I think that there's, there's things that you could do, like a stop rescuing pitbulls. You should just set them free and let them wander the streets in packs and then everybody has a cyanide pill, you know? So if you get, you know, if he wants to be ripped apart by a pack of wild dogs, you can just eat it every once in a while. Or maybe you do that like, I dunno, like there's some sort of incentive for your family if you off yourself.

Speaker 1:          00:28:54       You know what I mean? And I figure if you off yourself, that's an even better way. Cause then they can like prepare rather than just have a bunch of carcasses on the side of the road that'll cause diseases, which is good. But after a certain point you're beat. But once we get under 500 million, now you just killing the chosen ones, the blue chips. Right. They should have like an NFL combine to find, you know, you gotta get your, like every country has to get their roster down to a, down to a number, right? Like you're allowed to have 100,000 people. You're not allowed to judge it by race, religion, sex, or anything like that. Right. And you just have the best of the best of race, sex, religion, all of that fucking shit that we care about. Right. You just have that

Speaker 3:          00:29:41       cruise ships now. No cruise ships. That's not going to work. Cause that's also an environmental disaster. I, I regret doing that bit on my last special. I never thought of all the oil that was gonna to

Speaker 1:          00:29:51       be seeping there. So my new one is that you just let him pull into port and then you just, you just mowed them all down.

Speaker 3:          00:30:10       They die happy with his silly hats and their flip flops.

Speaker 2:          00:30:17       MMM.

Speaker 3:          00:30:19       I know. None of that's right. This is, is in a time like this. Don't you think this should be more caring?

Speaker 1:          00:30:27       Yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:30:27       Somebody told me today that they're actually selling land on Mars. Can I somehow get in on that? Can I, I'll sell you the whole fucking planet for 15 grant. You can get out there and figure out there's no atmosphere. Then you're going to die. Oh, that's a shame. I mean, it's there. You can see it. Look right through the telescope. I sold you that. If you can get there and breathe, it's going to be all yours. It's going to be all yours.

Speaker 2:          00:30:57       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:31:01       That's the way you know something right there. That'd be the first wave of how you get rid of people. You Sell Land on Mars and anybody that goes to [inaudible]

Speaker 3:          00:31:08       buy it, you go, okay, you won. You got to be a little bit of land. Come down here to claim it. And then they walk into a room like Joe Pesci and good fellas, right? You put a gun to their head, you're like, Hey, wait a minute. What the fuck? It's like, well dude, you obviously don't want to be here. You'd rather go to Mars. It's too crowded. You know I'm going to send you to heaven, man. You can see all the planets.

Speaker 2:          00:31:32       All right?

Speaker 1:          00:31:38       I like when people wonder if there's, if there's life on other planets, you know what I mean? Like why would you, you know, who gives a shit if there is, you can't talk to them. They're too far away. You know it. What if they're smart enough to get here? Do you really want to wave your arms?

I decided to try out me undies because I love beep bill burrs, me undies. Jangle I smile every time he sings it. This reeks of being rewritten by the advertising. What kind of man says that? I just look out the window and smile.

Speaker 3:          00:39:19       Do you, do you just smile when you, I don't believe a word of this, although it's so easy to skip ads in a podcast. I always listened to bill's reads and I'm so glad me undies has stuck with did Al Gore right? This, it's, this is about as sincere as him. If I told you guys my theory on why Hilary keeps fucking losing, um, even though she only lost once, it's cause she has Mike Dukakis is charisma and she's isn't comfortable in her own skin is Al Gore. And you combine those two and what you have is a dope that loses to an even bigger dope. Um, Oh man, this is a Trump state. I can feel it. Oh yeah. Is he making it better for you? Oh, it's too late. It's too edit chance. You had a chance at a day off and you said no, this is the fucking candidate you've always been waiting for.

And that starts with a great pair of me undies, cradling the family jewels to get 20% off the best and softest underwear and socks you will ever own for free shipping and 100% satisfaction guarantee. Go to [inaudible] dot com slash bird. That's me undies.com/ [inaudible] all right. I started to hype something here. 40 minutes. Everybody just like that. Just like that 40 minutes that you'll never get back. Um, I thought he was going to be standing up.

Speaker 3:          00:40:59       I thought there was going to be more of a show. I thought there'd be show girls. Um, I saw I might as well stand up. It's so fucking hot in here. Um, oh, he's standing up. He's, he standing up. He wants the world to know that the fucking podcast. What do you mean speaking up? I got to fucking microphones here. How much more can I speak up, sir? Are they canceling each other out but the amplification or they both colyte no, you go. No, you go. We were both born in the 90s. I want to offend you with my yellow skin and your black skin.

Speaker 3:          00:41:40       I want to sit in this big chair cause it, I feel like I would think that I know something over here. Here we are. Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to another episode of masterpiece podcasting. Um, wow. This is weird. Now I got in here. There's a whole new sound in here. Um, I hate that I'm at the fucking old age where I have to cross my legs when I sit down. I don't know what happened. I remember as a kid, you just fucking sat down and I got to sit there constantly stretching out my fucking hip. This couch was supposed to be nailed down. Um, so I saw the premiere of the ric Flair, nature boy. Dude, I don't think I've ever fucking laughed that hard. I mean I have to go back to like a Richard Pryor special. That guy is arguably one of the funniest fucking human beings ever. And I have to tell you something. What I can commend about that guy in this nature, boy, 30 for 30 that you have to fucking see is he did not run from anything. He owned up to everything good or fucking bad. They were sitting there talking about like, you know him fucking around on his wife and he was just going yet you go, how long were you faithful for in your marriage? He just goes one day

Speaker 3:          00:42:53       and he was like, I couldn't do it. I couldn't do it. I came home and I spent a day with my family and I was like bored out of my mind. I was in hell and it was so fucking refreshing to hear a married guy talk about how badly he wants to continue fucking as many women as he possibly could right now. I know the laughs are going to go down because there's too many women here and every guy has to sit there and act like he was, you know, like probably thinking about it right fucking now. I don't know. But, uh, yeah. You talked about everything just being like just all the women he was with and then one point they cut back to his first wife where we calls number one.

Speaker 2:          00:43:40       Okay

Speaker 3:          00:43:40       though this guy is a fucking legend and she just cuts back to him and she's just like, yeah, Rick wasn't a family man. I was doubled over laughing and then, you know, it definitely has its sad points, but he doesn't run from it. You can say he's a bad father or if he's maybe like an alcoholic. I don't want to ruin too many of the lines, but he was just saying like, I don't know if I'm an alcoholic. I know I never tried to quit.

Speaker 2:          00:44:10       Okay.

Speaker 3:          00:44:10       It was just one fucking closing bit after another with this guy. It's like, I would close with that. I would close with that. I would close with that and he just kept going. He did tell this one story. I'm all twisted up on my 20 fucking microphone. He did tell this one story to the crowd that was there. He talked about how we, one night he was on the road and he was out partying and he goes, and I woke up with a couple of, I guess I woke up next to an alien, which is what he calls being like blackout drunk and just waking up next to some woman, you don't even know her fucking name. So he goes, I woke up and there was an alien alien on one side and an alien on the other. And I looked down at my Rolex was missing. So I waked the women up and I go, wow. Hey, where's my, where's my watch? And they go, you don't remember? They go, you don't remember? And he goes, no. He goes, yeah. Last night you through your watch into a bowl of spaghetti and you said, I got 15 of these fucking things.

Speaker 2:          00:45:18       Yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:45:18       This was just a throwaway story.

Speaker 3:          00:45:22       I mean, this is a comedy club. This is a packed house. I'm killing just remembering lines that he said, I'm telling you have to fucking watch this guy is, it's like I'm telling you, they ought to give him like the Mark Twain Award. They're always given it to like these, these fucking people, you know, I'm dealing with, they give it to some people that are funny, but then other times they just, you know, sometimes it's like that guy is not as funny as fucking ric flair. You've got to get him in there, you know? You know, they wouldn't know cause it's always like the, uh, the arts and mere Meryl Streep and Blah, blah, blah, blah. Get the fuck out of here. You don't, you think she could fucking be that good an actress after a couple of back body drops. Okay.

Speaker 3:          00:46:01       You think she could do the flare flop and kip that keep that period correct wig that she has on, I dunno why I'm trashing Meryl Streep. I have no idea why. You know why? Because she's always getting awards, you know? Yeah. Fuck her for doing such great work. It's the dumbest shit. You know, this business works. If you trash anybody, you, you inevitably you end up working for them. I can't tell you how many times that's, I'd haven't gotten a lot of acting work, but every time I've ever gotten acting work and I'm in the fucking hair and makeup, I always get to skip the hair part. Of course, I go over to the makeup side of the trailer. Inevitably somebody comes walking in, I'm like, Oh shit, I trashed that person. I hope they didn't hear that podcast. All right. Um, I think that was it. You guys want to listen to some reeds here for this week? Can you hear me? Is Everything fine? Is this, is this working? How has this been so far? If you guys enjoyed this, is this something I should do more of?

Speaker 2:          00:47:00       All right.

Speaker 3:          00:47:02       I've already have one guy. There's always going be one guy, boring. I didn't like it. All right. Uh, on Monday I discussed silkworms and how they take the spittle from a silk worm and that's how they make a silk shirt. Um, somebody goes silkworms, hey, you ugly red faced fucking Twat. You really think silk shirts are made from silk worms. Really? Jesus fucking Christ, Dude. Just think about it. Just think about that for a second. Bless your heart bill. But sweet. Fuck man. Get your act together and go fuck yourself. You know what's funny is I did and I still do until I was thinking like, wait, well how would they turn that spittle into thread? But I also used to think that a fucking, uh, I used to think a pony was just a little hoarse. I did and I remember these people down the street. They had, they had up, they had a, a little pony and I just remembered, I just remembered thinking of why won't, when is that thing going to fucking grow up and become a horse? And I finally, one day I asked my mother when I was like 15 and she just looked at me like, how did you come out of me?

Speaker 3:          00:48:19       What do I Google here? What is silk made out of? It's just going to say silk, but what? They shouldn't call it a fucking silk warm. Then what is silk made at? What is silk? Oh fuck you sir. This shit I know that you don't know. Okay. Oh, everybody likes to feel so God damned smart, Huh? What is silk made of?

Speaker 2:          00:48:45       Yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:48:46       This right here. If there's ever a hunger games, I'm definitely not gonna make it right here. The protein fiber of silk is comprised mainly of fibrin and is produced by certain insect larvae to form cocoons. All right. That was kind of right. The best known silk is obtained from the cocoons of the larva of the Mulberry Silkworm. Wait a minute. Was I right?

Speaker 2:          00:49:10       Yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:49:13       What the fuck? Well, it wasn't spitting it out. I thought it was basically a silkworm spiderweb. Why would a warm make a spiderweb bill? Maybe so. What's, I don't know.

Speaker 2:          00:49:26       MMM.

Speaker 3:          00:49:29       There's another way to make money off of suicidal sink. Silkworms each year, over 30,000 silkworms commit suicide. And I would like to buy a Tesla. So please send your money in. All right. Fat But fit, uh, Billy, no roles. Uh, a study just came out that speaks to everything you've said about being fat almost automatically. Meaning you're not healthy today. There are a lot of people who say you can be in good health while carrying fat, but that's just to soften the blow to people who can't lose the lard. All right. Anyways, thought I'd share. You're not as dumb as Naea says you are, but maybe still a bit of a moron. Just kidding. Go Fuck Yourself. I ain't no idea how much you guys laugh at these people shitting on me. I thought, I thought you were all sitting at home as offended as I was going. Hey, don't say that about bill. Bill was my podcast friend. Well, well, well, well I guess you get to see all your fucking friends are when you do something live.

Speaker 3:          00:50:48       All right. I don't know if this is how bad my short term memory's. I don't even know what the fuck I just said. I didn't want to just read that. You can be a fed. Yeah. Oh yeah, no. Yeah. You don't want to be fat. Like that's a big thing now to be fat and be proud of it, you know? And they talk about fat shaming and all that Shit. It's just like, you know, you should just ignore what everybody says and you should listen to your heart going for the love of God. Lose the weight. I'm going to conk out here.

Speaker 2:          00:51:14       Okay.

Speaker 3:          00:51:15       Ah, that was a cheap joke. That was an easy one. I set you up, you know, easy. I took you to the left and then I went, right. That's what I did. That was the old misdirection. You'll comedy crossover there. All right. Nestle cunts. Nestle cons. That's right. Oh yeah, they're the ones. They're the ones causing all the wars. Hey there, Billy in the mirror. A saw this article about Nestle that I thought might ruffle your feathers. Uh, the line, the byline says it all. Okay. Uh, this year, this year is Halloween confectionary. Oh, this is so great. I have people hit what the f what is a confectionary? It's a white, it's a candy store. What kind of an asshole calls it a confectionary.

Speaker 3:          00:52:08       You know what's funny? I got this acting gig right now, by the way. I got to promote the movie. You got to see it next to probably come out next year. It's called front row. Front runner Starts Hugh Jackman as Gary Hart. If you're old enough, you remember Gary Hart? Yeah, Gary Hart. We went a little ric flair on the road, right? He banged some woman and then all of a sudden he couldn't be president anymore and that's how, that's how Bush got in because this guy was a good looking guy and uh, all the ladies liked him. And that's all you need to do to win the presidency, right? You play the saxophone, you hit a jump shot, you know what I mean?

Speaker 3:          00:52:47       You do something like that and then everybody fucking loves you anyways, that's coming out.

When you say it into like a fucking, uh, you know, you're on a little, your little CB radio copy that. I get that, you know what I mean? But people say it to just other people. Now, just one person will be a, can you move that over there and the guy go copy that. It's like, why don't you just say, okay, it's a lot quicker. Can you move that? Okay, got it. Copy that. Those are the same kind of people that call a fucking

Speaker 3:          00:53:32       Hey, that's my, then that's called a callback. The guy just goes copy that. He was waiting for the end of the bit. See that? Now, how does he know about callbacks? How does he know? Because Netflix has released 30,000 standup specials this year. The creating a comedy special housing bubble over there.

Speaker 2:          00:53:54       MMM.

Speaker 3:          00:54:10       I'm going to freeze myself after I die. Don't they have that here? The cryogenics right next to the confectionary. Right. I'm going to freeze myself. So then when they figured out how to cure death, they can unfreeze me and I could do a bit of, I can do an hour long one man show on Netflix about what it's like to be in a 40 year coma. All right. Net, uh, Nestle, everybody. Um, by the way,F is for family. Please watch that on Netflix. Now that I've made fun of them. Just scroll. If he can't find it, just scroll left for like 20 minutes.

Speaker 2:          00:54:48       MMM.

Speaker 3:          00:54:49       Anyways, this year is Halloween. Confectionary will contain palm oil grown on land that should lawfully be habitat. Be Habit by, can't read this. H A. B. I t a t lawfully be habitat to orangutans. I was always a rang a tank like the drink orangutans, rhinos and clouded leopards. I don't know why. What the fuck that is? Uh, despite commitment to clean up supply chains, this is on top of them. Siphoning. Yeah. This is, this is, you know, a lot of times it's not me. This is the sentence. This is on top of them. Siphoning. I fucking screen just went. I'll just finally gonna make a point. This is on top of them siphoning. They do have water from national parks that you've spoken about. I guess they take water out of national parks where they had agreements with native American tribes that have since expired. A, what's it going to take to end Nestle's corruption?

Speaker 3:          00:55:50       Maybe you can take this up as your, cause the way the first lady's doe, um, this is how you stop that. What'd you'd have to do is have politicians, politicians have to start earning fuck you money rather than being grossly underpaid. The fact that, you know, as a podcast or comedian, an actor you can make almost as much, if not more money than the president of the United States is fucking pathetic. You know what I mean? They should have fuck you money the second you become president, that she'd just be like, like, you know, like a pitching machine that's just throw in one fucking heater over the place. Just be a bag of money the entire time you there.

Speaker 3:          00:56:31       So then when these guys go, Hey, can we siphon this fucking Outta here? You can be like, no, fuck you. Well, if you doubt, uh, we won't help you get reelected. I don't give a fuck. I got fuck you money. It probably wouldn't work. I don't know. Sometimes I have good ideas. Sometimes I don't. Um, so I guess, yeah, don't buy any Nestle crunch bars everybody and stay away from their bottled water and whatever else they make. Do they make thongs? Um, all right. Do you feel how the podcast just immediately fucking slowed down the second I started reading out loud. It's fucking unbelievable. Oh, why do I do this? Why do I do this to myself? What is the shame? Is it, cause I was raised Catholic. All right. Accidentally made two girls, my girlfriend. All right. I like this guy already. Hi William.

Speaker 3:          00:57:19       The bald big fan from Kenya. Oh, this is a second language. All right. Love the podcast andF is for family is amazing. That's amazing that you can watch it over there. Um, no, you should see, go on f go on the Internet. You can actually watch all these people. You know, you know whatF is for family? I feel like captures the frank character that's loosely based on my dad. You know which one I think does it the best is Mexico. You know, cause they got a lot of fucking same kind of people screaming and yelling, temper. You know what I mean? It just fucking works great. Um, some of that'll come off as racist, but it was supposed to be a compliment. Um, long story short, I have had a crush on two ladies in my college class for over four years. Jesus Christ. This guy moves slow, Huh?

Speaker 2:          00:58:11       Aye.

Speaker 3:          00:58:13       Now one of them is dying of ovarian cancer and I feel like it's too late. Ah, Geez. It's not that we care. We care in Phoenix. Huh? I bet you guys all pictured a white vagina.

Speaker 2:          00:58:31       Yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:58:32       Fucking act like you guys care how you can try to bully me into your fucking phony given a shit. They probably showed that hurricane and fucking Houston on comedy central out here. That's a little you people care guys are all about yourselves.

Speaker 2:          00:58:52       Yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:58:56       All right. All I, all right. I don't even know where I am and this, I don't know how you follow a white vagina next day. And I'm up for bids. A white vagina. Mika did Mika. I'm auctions for serial killers. It would just be like women's body parts. Oh, we're so offended. Oh fuck. All of you. I'll steer even harder into it. MMM. Did you hear that? They're going to start having Jeffrey Dahmer Day in Wisconsin. That's true. They have an all you can eat ms and all you can eat mystery meat day in Wisconsin. They're trying to change the perception that all they do is eat cheese up there. See, we done groaning because I'll keep fucking going on. All right, so this guy had a crush on these ladies for four fucking years. But since breaking up with my previous girlfriend three years ago, I decided to not get into another relationship. So the whole time you with this girl for three years, you had a crush on two other women for four years. I love this guy. He's a fucking mess. Um, all I did with these two girls was light flirting from time to time. What is light flirting and Kenya.

Speaker 2:          01:00:15       Um, what

Speaker 3:          01:00:19       I was going to do some starving Joe, you want a piece of bread just fucking with you. Ah, you're going to have it. Um, he's going to write back next, next week. Dear bill, we are not Somalia or Ethiopia. We actually have food in Kenya.

Speaker 2:          01:00:36       Okay.

Speaker 3:          01:00:36       Running water and skyscrapers.

Speaker 2:          01:00:40       MMM.

Speaker 3:          01:00:43       Anyways, all I did you all he did was flirt with one of them is the fun, friendly kind, but she's kind of loose parentheses, open relationship and sending nudes types. All right, so that's the one you bang. You fucking, you're double rapid, right? You double rapid and the other is conservative. The other is conservative. Introvert, Virgin. But I didn't really enjoy her company. All right. There's the one you have kids with. This is an easy one. Well, a few days ago it was my birthday and I had both of them. And you had both of them. You just going to stop there. You bank both of them. Well, she's not a virgin anymore now is she at both of them and some few friends over. This is his second language and I can't read for a party. I had a shitload of booze and was on, I'm going to guess right now the one that he thinks is loose held her alcohol and the Virgin Blue. Everyone at the party,

Speaker 2:          01:01:40       what I'm going with,

Speaker 3:          01:01:44       maybe I'd been in Hollywood too long, but this can't be linear. It has to make a left turn at some point to spin us into the second act. Okay, well, a few days ago it was my birthday and I, okay, and in both over I read, right, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. They came over. I had a shitload of booze and was on autopilot the whole time, but apparently I had the balls to ask the two ladies to be my girlfriend. All he was drunk.

Speaker 2:          01:02:13       Okay.

Speaker 3:          01:02:13       I don't believe this is a true story or did he watch some Kenyan version of the Brady bunch when Peter has two dates in one night up, a few days later I get a text from both of them asking whether I was serious about asking them out. I'm now in a huge dilemma of choosing between the two who I really like and the fact that I haven't been in a relationship in a while and basically forgot how to be in a relationship. Oh, shut the fuck up. You remember exactly how to be in a relationship. That's why you don't want to be in one.

Speaker 2:          01:02:47       Okay.

Speaker 3:          01:02:47       Any advice would be appreciated and uh, okay. And uh, Ooh, Jen denia which is Swahili for go fuck yourself.

Speaker 2:          01:03:01       MMM. Okay.

Speaker 3:          01:03:05       All right. Well I think, uh,

Speaker 2:          01:03:08       yeah,

Speaker 3:          01:03:09       I think you got to go with the whore. You know, if you don't want to be in a relationship, but you did say girlfriend.

Speaker 2:          01:03:19       MMM.

Speaker 3:          01:03:21       I would just own up to it. Just be, just be like, listen, I've been, I was totally shit faced when I sent that, but I have had a crush on you for four years. You always got to go with honesty with women guys go into it. You know, you always think you got to lie to him and all of that shit. You got to just, you just fucking lay your cards on the table. It's the best thing he could do. She, they won't get mad. They might get a little upset depending on what you say, you know, it depends on how graphic you get. Where do you see this going? I see you, uh, laying off the edge of my bed on your back with your head hanging off as I fuck your mouth while watching sports center.

Speaker 2:          01:04:02       Okay.

Speaker 3:          01:04:02       That might be a little too honest. You could just say, um, you know, just looking to have a good time. I would just go with the honesty. I would tell both of them,

Speaker 3:          01:04:18       dude, you should use the fact that you're not in a relationship right now. You get to hit the reset button and you just go total. Honestly, I would tell them exactly what the fuck happened to say. I had crushed on both of you for fucking food. I wouldn't have talked to both same time, but I would say I sent it to two different people and that's what I did. And then just wait to hear what they say. That's it. And if they don't like it, who gives a fuck? Take you and your honesty to the next situation of telling you, all right, that's the best way to handle the fucking thing. Uh, then, uh, I dunno, somehow you just tell them what's going on out. Christ. They get to tell the story. Here's a story for you. One time when I learned about honesty, I was in my fucking early to mid thirties and I was just sick alliance and I met this chick. She was like 22 years old. So we get back to my apartment. This lady's leaving right now. She can't bear to listen to this, right?

Speaker 2:          01:05:05       No.

Speaker 3:          01:05:08       So we get back to my apartment, you start making out and everything, and she goes, wait a minute. She goes like, when his second, she says, where's this going? And I said, nowhere. Oh, are you kidding me? I go, I'm like 50 years older than you. By the time you're 30, I'm going to be like 86 years old. All right, this is going to go nowhere. So whatever you want to do sexually, but you don't want to do with somebody that you like you do with me,

Speaker 2:          01:05:41       right?

Speaker 3:          01:05:42       And then you'll never have a midlife crisis because you got it out of your system. And you know what she said? She went all right. That was it.

Speaker 2:          01:05:53       Yeah.

Speaker 3:          01:05:55       They're not as prudish as you think they are. Don't be afraid. That's the number one thing you gotta. You gotta go with the fucking honesty.

Speaker 2:          01:06:04       Yeah.

Speaker 3:          01:06:04       Do you like me? No.

Speaker 3:          01:06:09       No. You don't have to be meat. You don't have to be me. I like you, but not like that. All right. Girlfriend loves my long hair. I don't. Oh, go fuck yourself. Jesus Christ. What are you gonna do next? Go Up to somebody with leukemia. My girlfriend loves my sick, free body, but I don't, I just love how you guys have this thing with disease. What is it with you guys and disease? Why does it make you so sad? It's mother nature trying to help us. They should close down all the pharmacies. Okay. And if you're lucky enough to be disease free, you live. That's what we need to do. Tough decisions have to be made.

Speaker 2:          01:06:52       MMM.

Speaker 3:          01:06:55       Okay. So I've been growing my hair out for a while.

Speaker 2:          01:07:00       MMM.

Speaker 3:          01:07:01       Since I enrolled in college. Oh two, that's the time to do it. Good for you. Grow your hair out. Livia Steven Seagal years in your 20s get by a sword. Sit there Indian style, meditating out on the fucking some sort of bluff or would I never went to college. Really? I never lived there. What do they call it out on the compound? The uh, the quad area, the grassy area. Just try to act interesting anyways and I'm about to graduate this upcoming spring. My girlfriend in a few friends convinced me to grow my hair out since they are all the hippie type. Ah, that's not the cool long hair. Skype probably goes to the University of Denver.

Speaker 3:          01:07:44       I don't consider myself a hippy at all, but that is the crew I run with since I have known most of them since back in high school and they are all close friends. A couple of them have long hair too. I was open to the idea since I've had short hair for most of my life before that the long hair turned out looking pretty good too. My girlfriend though loves the long hair on guys. A few days ago I told her passingly that I've been thinking about cutting it and she immediately seemed really concerned saying, I just don't think it would look good and, but I really how it is. And She just dating you for your hair, sir. But that she's only ever dated guys with longer hair. Dude, if you're looking to get out of this relationship, one quick trip to the fucking barber, this is the easiest breakup ever and you got to go hardcore. I'd get like a cop flat top

Speaker 2:          01:08:34       haircut,

Speaker 3:          01:08:38       detective mustache. This is the easiest breakup ever. Her concern kind of annoys me that she was saying that she would not be attracted to me in general if I, if I cut it to me it seemed pretty shallow considering we've been together for almost three years. Yeah, dude, she doesn't love you. She doesn't love you. Get your fucking haircut and get out of there. That's what I do. I'm pretty fed up with my long hair and everything that comes with it. Knots, hair trying, you know, getting in my eyes cause yeah, dude, you're, you're, you're, you learn something. You know you did something for her, not for fucking you. Right. You don't like it. You're telling you you don't like it. She says she's, she doesn't like the fact that you don't like it. It's all there sir. All right. This is what you do. You fucker. One more time and then you go get your haircut.

Speaker 2:          01:09:24       MMM.

Speaker 3:          01:09:25       I don't advise you doing that. That's mean. I just, I just needed a laugh.

Speaker 2:          01:09:30       MMM.

Speaker 3:          01:09:32       Okay. Here's the last one, everybody and then we'll meet. We'll be almost at the end of the podcast. Hour and 10 minutes. Just like that first ever live one. There you go.

Speaker 2:          01:09:42       All right

Speaker 3:          01:09:45       guys, lie on Tinder. Surprise. Hey. Oh Bill. I'm a 29 year old single lady living in Virginia. Uh, along with most other singles my age. It seems I've had to try out various dating sites and apps over the years, but haven't had any success cultivating anything more than a date here or there. I realize this, allow, my God, this is so fucking long.

Speaker 2:          01:10:13       Ah,

Speaker 3:          01:10:14       lady. Maybe if you got to the point you'd get a second date.

Speaker 2:          01:10:19       MMM.

Speaker 3:          01:10:20       That was a cheap shot. Admittedly, that was a cheap shot. I got anxiety and how long this was in rather than admitting to the fact that I don't like to read out loud. I blamed her. I'm sorry, and I'm sorry for your horrible social life. Let's continue. I realize a lot of this was likely due to the fact that I've been pretty overweight my entire adult life now and now I'm sad. However, the last year and a half I've managed to lose 112 pounds.

Speaker 2:          01:10:46       [inaudible]

Speaker 3:          01:10:49       that's fucking awesome. It took you a year and a half. Good for you. 112 pounds and counting. She's not done yet. She's like John Elway. She's getting the rings at the end of a career

Speaker 2:          01:11:02       and

Speaker 3:          01:11:06       the taking all that shit in the press. She's finally living up to her expectations. I love it. And counting and counting by changing my diet and literally running my tits off on the elliptical for an hour five times a week. That's fucking amazing. Good you. Anyways, last week on Tinder, I matched with a very cute 29 year old guy. Uh, he initiated the conversation. We had a great back and forth comparing what podcasts we listened to. I found out he actually lives in Ohio and was only traveling in my area for work for the next few days. All right. That's a red flag. And he's on Tinder. He's looking to get his dick sucked. All right. That's it. He doesn't want to know how many brothers and sisters you have. And what's your hobby? Oh, do you like to cook? Fantastic. Why don't you cook my balls in your mouth as I stroke my Dick over here? Uh, brutal honesty. Women like honesty. Anyways, I know I should have called it quits then. But finding out someone that had that can actually hold the conversation seems to be a real rarity these days. He asked me out to dinner, but because of my diet I had a, and wanting to be nice, I offered for him to come over for a home cooked healthy meal. Uh, when you didn't fill them into the backstory. Now he thinks he thinks he's getting anal.

Speaker 3:          01:12:28       This is how guys think, okay, we want this whole me too thing to end. Guys have to be honest about how they think. All right. He came over was just acute, was just as cute and person as in his pictures. The great conversation kept flowing. I can't believe you just met somebody on the Internet and invited them over to your fucking house. Please tell me you had a fucking pistol taped to the inside of your leg. The great conversation kept flowing in six hours later, we were making out. We both had to be up early. The next day he left with plans to hang out again the next day after work we did and ended up hooking up. He left Virginia the next day, but we continue to message pretty constantly over the next week with him initiating the conversation. Most of the time, I swear to God, this three paragraphs left and I want to apologize to each and every one of you. I want to have a benefit for all of your ears having to listen to me. Have to fucking read this. God Damn Lawn. Please call the number at the bottom of the screen and a portion of the proceeds will go to everybody's ear drums in this room. And also my dodge to door, a hemi pickup truck for 40 grand. Um, anyways, all seem to be going pretty great except the eight hour distance in between one another. Well, yeah. Okay.

Speaker 3:          01:13:56       Guys never looked at a globe. Uh, however, you know what? There's an I in Virginia, there's an I in Ohio. They must be pretty close. Don't alphabetize by a vowel in the middle of them or something. I'm all seem to be going pretty good. Okay. Except for the eight blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. Nothing really came. Okay. However, I just had a feeling something wasn't quite right, so I googled him. I guarantee you he has a family. Nothing really came up except his, I don't know what profile. Then a few lines down. I see an old wedding gift registry site with his name. I called it. Yeah. I swear to God I didn't read this before. You think this sounds bad out loud. You should hear when I read quietly and I just hear me stuttering in my brain,

Speaker 3:          01:14:48       I searched all the girls' names on the registry along with his last name on Facebook and Bingo all over this girl's profile or cute pictures of a sweet couple. The other half of which is the guy that was in, I was in bed with a week ago. The son of a bitch is married. What do I do here, Bill? Do I call the guy out on his shit and rip him a new one? Do I send his wife a message and tell her what he's doing? He travels. All the women are gone. Yeah, so the guys were like, no, no, no. Move on. Move on. He travels the majority of the time for work and I'm sure I'm not the first person he's done this to. He already deleted his Tinder profile and our text message have only been PG for the most part, so I don't have any concern, concrete proof to send her. I feel completely wretched. Wretched. W R e t c h e. D, ratchet. All right. That was right. Jesus Christ. Wretched. I thought this one you would like puking. Retching all right. Everybody's got a degree in the room.

Speaker 3:          01:16:07       I feel completely wretched and terrible. For the most part. I unknowingly played in this entire, I played into this entire situation. No, you didn't. Yeah, you didn't. Unknowingly, if this is like one of the oldest fucking stories on the Internet, also, any dating advice for me moving forward is also appreciated. Uh, thanks for the advice and congrats on that beautiful baby girl. He goes, oh, thank you very much. All right. Yay. Oh, Billy became a father. All right. First of all, I gotta be honest with you, you're kind of going Hillary Clinton on this thing where you're not taking any responsibility for this loss whatsoever. You're blaming him, you're calling him a piece of shit. You're of the electorial college, you're blaming the Sandinista rebels, everything

Speaker 3:          01:17:02       but you, okay? You went on Tinder. Tinder is a total hookups site. It's full of fucking scumbags, like, and then guess what? You met a fucking scumbag. So what I would take out of that is to not go on dating sites. And I would try, I don't know. I would join like a fucking sports league or some shit. Like Yo play some softball. I would try to do some hobby thing. I know that sounds like an old guy thing, but like, you know, the fucking Internet is the Internet now. If you want to go blow up this guy's life to make you feel better, I mean, you, you can also do that. I mean, I mean, I dunno what I do. I just, when I fuck up, I just go, I fucked up and I just, I, I walk away from it. I mean, if you wanted, if you want to do that, that's up to you. I don't fucking know. I mean, who knows? Maybe maybe his wife isn't blowing them, you know, let's try to blame as innocent wife now,

Speaker 2:          01:18:02       you know,

Speaker 3:          01:18:04       I just feel like in this age of hyper feminism, the way women always just stick up for other women, that guys need to start doing this. So I have to stick up for this complete piece of shit here. Um,

Speaker 3:          01:18:20       maybe, uh, maybe, you know, maybe it's just the love's gone and the relationship, they got the kids, he doesn't want to leave. He just wants to know what it likes to have fun again. And you, you were fun and he fucking, you know, it's kind of on you though, because the first night when you just hung out, all you gotta do is look at his wedding ring. And if he's wearing a ring, you'll see the indentation from it. I mean, you got to go a little bump up, bump up bomb. Right, ma'am? I don't know why I'm blaming for you, blaming you. I have no excuse for this fucking guy. Uh, I dunno. I mean, what about George Clooney in that movie where he's flying around in the planes and he showed up and that woman had a family, you know, did he say anything? He did. And what was it called? Up in the air. Right. And he was banging that woman and then he went to her house and he found out that she was married and he was like, oh fuck. He just walked away. That's what guys do think. We just, we just walk away. Women start pulling hedges out of the front yard. They start putting rabbits in the fucking stew and shit. Like, is that why we die sooner than they do? Cause we just hold that in our chest. The fucking pitch had a family and you just carry that around for the rest of your life. Women get to get it out.

Speaker 3:          01:19:53       We as the thing, if he has kids and shit, like maybe he's just going through a fucking phase that he's working it out. You're going to blow up that family and their dad's going to leave. And just, just so you know, this is going to be two kids with this guy has kids. Does he have kids?

Speaker 3:          01:20:12       I know personally I would just take the loss and I would move on. I would just go like, listen, I, I checked you out. I found out you're married you fucking piece of shit. And uh, because I'm a cool chick, I'm not going to call your fucking wife. Go Fuck you. See, I mean, he could do that or you could just, Oh, you can just say, I dunno. I Dunno. I Dunno what to tell you. I can't throw another guy under the bus like this. That's a, that's what you would do. There you go. Someone in the crowd. So that's what I would do. Keep losing weight and move the fuck on.

Speaker 4:          01:20:40       Yeah. Which you have to listen to what you have to do. Yeah. You know what? You got to look at that

Speaker 3:          01:20:47       guy. Like you got to look at that guy. Like when Columbus was sailing across the ocean, he didn't see land first. He saw branches. So he knew that something good was coming right. That he could exploit and cut their arms off when they didn't give enough gold. Okay. Allegedly, oh, I go new evidence shows that he was this, what was your fine, hi. Did somebody scrawl it into a fucking tree? Um, yeah. Just look at this guy. Okay. You're gonna have to, you know, you're going to take some losses on your way to a championship. Okay. You don't blow up the whole team and burn down the fucking arena. That's what you want to do. Just know this. Take it as a compliment. You lost so much weight. You were worth risking a house for.
