Speaker 1:          00:00:00       Hey, what's going on? It's bill burn. It's time for the Monday morning podcast for Monday, December 31st, 2018 case. You thought there was 32 days in December. This is the last day of 2018. What are you going to do with it? Are you going to theses the day? Seize the day, Aka cram too much shit into a 24 hour periods so you're fucking stressed out for the next day. That's how I do it. That's how I do it. Oh, by the way, guess what? I finally got that little fucking piece I needed for my, uh, for my headphones and it works great. And uh, as you see, I sat there and I fucking pitched about it for what? Six fucking felt like nine years.

Speaker 2:          00:00:45       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:00:45       I just ordered it on Amazon. It showed up, you know, some fucking eight year old put on a welding mass. He made it there. Then somebody else fluid on a fucking,

Speaker 2:          00:00:54       yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:00:55       What do you call those goddamn things that hover over your neighborhood? Drone.

Speaker 2:          00:01:00       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:01:01       Yeah. I Dunno. Anyways, happy new year to you. Happy New Year to you. You're going to get shit faced. Call an Uber or a Lyft. Um, I'm actually going to be going out tonight for the first time in a long time. We're going to be going up, going out with my, uh, my whole family, my family back east. We're just going to go out to dinner. Uh, it's cool being a dad, you know what I mean? Right. Then I'll go on and go booze and all that shit. He just fucking call two days before. Do you have a reservation at four in the afternoon? Four 30 the leg. Why? Yes. Yes we do. It's like any other day here at four or four 30 in the afternoon. However, you know, started at around seven. No, we don't. I'm completely booked and everything's going to be jacked up the a hole. So, uh, we're all gonna go out and have a, hopefully a pleasurable meal, enjoyable dinner and all that type of stuff. And then I go to the rose bowl the next day and then the following day gave me a ticket on an aero plane.

Speaker 2:          00:02:08       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:02:09       Gonna go fly to fucking eastern Europe. I'm going to go to Cologne, Germany, and then I'd start and I am ready baby. I put it at the time I did the fucking work. I was down in the comedy store every night, the last three nights and the ice house. You know, I fucked up a Thursday night. I fucking, I fucked up twice on my gigs this week, which I never do. I actually was headlining the ice house and I'd forgotten. I put in at the comedy store, some pulling into the comedy store at like nine o'clock and I just happened to look down at my phone and I see a Joe Rogan phone call and he was the one who told me to, you know, that they wanted to book me at the Ice House. Then I was like, oh fuck. And then I saw, I had a bunch of messages from the club owner and they called up. I was like, what time was I supposed to be on stage? He's like right now, 10 minutes ago. So I drove out there like a maniac. I finally learned how to use the supercharger in my car.

Speaker 2:          00:03:07       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:03:07       You know, so I was in a intense mode. Whatever the fuck they call it. Like I drove that car for fucking two years. Never using the supercharger cause I didn't know you had to push a button. I just start when I stepped on the gas, like the old days, it would just engage over there but it didn't. So uh, I finally learned how to use that thing and um, what is going on with these fucking wires? Why can't I get him ever? Not, we just, I'd have someone understand how this fucking happens every single time.

Speaker 2:          00:03:33       Every week,

Speaker 1:          00:03:35       every week. You know, it's weird. You could take a handful of wires and throw them on the ground and then once you pick one of them up, they all tied together. You know, it's so weird that you can do that with like wires, but you can't do it with snakes. If you throw them on the fucking ground and you just picked one of 'em up, they wouldn't be a bunch of them all tangled up in it. They all just fucking slither away.

Speaker 2:          00:03:57       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:03:57       That's what I'm saying is we need to start making wires the way the good lord makes the snakes. Um, anyways, so then I had to drive all the way back to the comedy store.

Speaker 2:          00:04:10       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:04:10       Because I was so fucking late at the ice house. I hung out and took pictures and sign shit. Do you know what to make up for that? Did the full hour. Then I went all the way back to the fucking comedy store. I got there, but like a quarter to 12 at night and I got to tell you, and I even gone up, you know, I never went up really late at the comedy store because I never got past there to go through that. And I went back to me, you know, I audition for Mitzi and she said I ain't, she didn't say anything. She left in the middle of my second. That's how fucking awful she thought I was. And she's probably right. Um, if I'm going to be mature about it. And then I just, I moved back to New York and I sorta did the late night thing in New York and I never got to do at the comedy store and that's probably the latest I've gone on there since I can remember.

Speaker 1:          00:04:56       And it was just a completely different animal. I went on in the main room and, and then also when the original room and in the main room I was on stage and I was thinking about Richard Pryor for some reason because I know that there's some older guys there told me how he used to work out his stuff late night there. And then when I went into the, or I was, you know, I just went up there and I had like this fucking set where it was just totally free refund set, all his shit. Didn't take any of it, just shit that I would, a few things, I remembered that now in my act, but like, and I remember hearing this story that Jim Carrey came up with fire Marshall Bill late night in the or at the comedy store and all that Shit. So it was really ended up being really cool.

Speaker 1:          00:05:36       And then I worked two shows Friday there to show Saturday and then last night I was running my hour in the main room and then I was running over to the whiskey because Steven Adler was playing. And um, I also had another spot in the AOR, but instead of just doing an hour, I did like an hour and 40 in the main room and I was going to be late for the Steven Adler show. So I was like, is it cool if I just don't do that spot? Because I didn't know that they advertise me in that room too. I thought they just advertise me in the main room, but they had also advertise me in the EOR. Had I known that I would've gone over there and done it. I just thought I had a spot and I, and I missed it because I was supposed to go off at 10 15 and by the time I got off stage in the main room, it was like 10 40.

Speaker 1:          00:06:15       I was like, I don't want to fuck it up over there, you know, for the other people. So anyways, long story short, I saw Steven Adler fucking great show at the whiskey and then I'm walking back to the store and I'm walking in front of the store and these four people are standing there like fucking two of them, one 30 in the morning going like, you've gotta be shitting me, you're going to go on now. I go, we talking about it was on in the main rooms, it could know you were in the Olr. We were sitting there for five hours. The whole crowd was fucking pissed off. So I, I dunno, I got to try to figure out how to fucking make that right. But I felt like a fucking asshole. So I took a picture with them and um, I dunno. I Dunno. I was thinking, why the fuck did I do that?

Speaker 1:          00:06:53       Cause then went over to the Adler thing and it started like, you know, 20 minutes later I would have had time to do it then I wouldn't have disappointed those people and now I feel like a fucking asshole. Um, but I haven't said that, you know, I, I, I basically did like seven sets in missed one. So what are you going to do? Uh, but dude, the fucking Adler appetite show, that thing was fucking great man. And I was just sitting there, the whole show. I was just watching Steven because I started listening, you know?

Speaker 2:          00:07:28       Yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:07:28       I dunno. I, I kinda tuned up my drums and I got some different heads and shit and they sound fucking killer and a then my drum teacher came over and he fined tuned it and now it just sounds fucking unbelievable. And uh, I was listening to just that appetite album again and I'm such a drum nerd. Do you realize that Steven Adler does not hit his rack Tom until like, like the fourth song, like halfway through the fourth song, he crushes that album just with a bass drum, snare and his floor. Tom, the only time we really hits the floor, Tom, is the breakdown during a welcome to the jungle out to get me as all just kick snare. Uh, no, I'm sorry. Uh, what's the next I would say to get me, it's uh, it's so easy is our kick snare

Speaker 1:          00:08:23       and what's the next one? Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, data that's on the other side. I don't fucking know. But anyway, so I was watching him and then when I watched him last night, the fill that I thought he was doing and one of those fucking songs a actually didn't do on the rack, he actually went from the snare over to the floor. So I actually think he goes maybe to, uh, Mr. Brown stone. Nobody even then that's a for Tom. But I remember seeing this whole fucking thing she does is born a lot of you guys. But uh, I remember seeing this whole fucking thing on that for awhile. He only had a three piece and it's just amazing how he's so style came out of being a broke musician and just crashing at people's places. He couldn't have a big drum kit if he wanted to. He started out for the Double Bass Kit. I remember reading in his book and then um, they got rid of that. You got rid of that somehow? Somebody said don't play the double bass just played a single bass drum assumption that long. It, it's like a Barnum thing. And then he was down to like just a floor.

Speaker 2:          00:09:25       Yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:09:26       kick and snare and just the, the amount of music that that guy got out of it. But uh,

Speaker 2:          00:09:31       yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:09:32       it was awesome. It was just do what a bunch of characters at the whiskey last night. Jesus Christ, there was this fucking guy there, right.

Speaker 1:          00:09:41       And I just, he, he looked and he looked like he was like in his fifties but he looked like he had a hard life. So he was probably like in his forties and he's just standing. All of a sudden the bouncer comes up and he just hit some like slaps him on the arm, like what the fuck? And then the guy kind of just is like, hey man, you know what I mean? It's cool, whatever. And the bounce, it just grabs them if fucking throws him out of the club is my buddy I was with went up and said, hey man, just started curiosity. What did that guy do? And I guess the guy had taken out his lighter and was fucking lighten the ass of the person in front of him like some other dude. So when the bouts hit, I'm like, what the fuck are you doing?

Speaker 1:          00:10:23       When he was making this gesture like yeah, it's kind of funny right in the punches. Just get the fuck outta here. You fucking lighten people on 40. What are you giving somebody have a hot foot, 50 years of fucking age. And my other buddy was with was laughing his ass off because so loud. I mean I could have just gone to him, but he was sitting there going like was laughing going, yeah, I saw the whole fucking thing. Like you didn't even try to hide it. It's a complete fucking asshole. Um, so anyways, uh, that's why I did it. My apologies to the people that came down to the, or last night. I feel I really feel fucking badly about that, man. I, I, I mean there's a hand, I don't know how many times in my life I've missed a spot. I would, I would think it's under 10 my entire fucking career.

Speaker 1:          00:11:09       Um, the first nine times nobody gave a fuck. Um, so my apologies. I hope that somehow I can make that up to you guys. Um, anyways, plowing ahead here. Uh, speaking of shows, we've added two more amazing comics. These guys are kids to me, but they're not, they're fucking dead. They're like legit. I'm just old as shit. Joe List. And Mark Norman had been added to the lineup for the seventh annual Patrice O'Neal comedy benefit. I had the privilege of working with both of them. Uh, Mark Norman. I worked at the West Side Comedy Club in New York City and Joe Lists, uh, when I did Gotham, uh, about a month ago, I got to work with both of them and, uh, just, just fucking like there they are like the next, um, just legit, legit, straight up fucking comedians and we'll be monster headliners. So come down and see them now. While you still can. Um, also on the show is, I've been mentioning Michelle Wolf, Chris Read Jim Gaffigan, uh, Gary Gulman, Rich Vos, sec the sounds big.

Speaker 1:          00:12:14       Jay Oakerson and myself. It's going to be a monster, monster, monster show and thanks to the Joe Rogan experience. Uh, we had 800 tickets to sell and now we're down to like 150. Um, so people can buy tickets@www.new York city. Oh, sorry. And why city center.org or on my website, which is [inaudible] dot com if you just click on the events or whatever the hell it is, road gigs or some shit like that. If you just click on that shit, you'll see, uh, the link right there. Um, all right, so they go speak in a rogue. And you know, I mentioned when I did his podcast how, uh, I took a sauna with them afterwards and he has like a legit sauna, you know, the ones would like to Kohl's and shit that you dumped the water on. So I felt so great after that. That was kind of Jones and for another one.

Speaker 1:          00:13:05       So I went to this fucking place, Audi, I'm not going to say the name cause I'm Kinda gonna like not shit on the place, but it's just more like I, it was a different kind of different kinds of sauna, um, where Joe's is the old school one that uh, that like, you know, the heat hits you from the outside and you sweat like that. I went to one of those infrared ones, the clear light fucking ones, which I realize is this whole debate on whether or not those things are healthy or not. And they say, yeah, you know, we checked out the fucking raise on this thing, it's fine. And then you're supposed to ask them, well, how did you measure those rays? Is there any radiation? Because they were like this thing, like he eats you from the inside is the way they described.

Speaker 1:          00:13:52       And I go, really? I go, I feel like I'm getting into a microwave and I got to tell you, I stayed in there for a fucking hour and when I came out I definitely felt better. But afterwards I didn't feel right. It just didn't feel right. It wasn't that same peaceful feeling that I had coming out of the other ones. So, uh, I didn't like the infrared ones, although I heard that some Hollywood starlets that just whereby him, I guess they use it for weight loss. And I will tell you, I came out to them. My stomach was definitely flattered, but I have these, I'm like, isn't that all water weight? You know, he'd go out and have one SAS Barilla there. Your fucking belly comes right back. Isn't, isn't that how it works? Um, but anyways, some, uh, going to go do this, this Europe tour, and I'm hoping to hit a couple of those places when I'm over there. Um, this is going to be an unprecedented road trip for me in that I won't be drinking. I don't even know that I'm going to smoke cigars because I had like fucking 90 over the past week, you know, catching up with end of the year. Hey, let's get a fucking to go. Um,

Speaker 1:          00:14:56       so I won't be smoking cigars. I got vitamins with me. I'm going to try to be hitting Saunas and fucking getting eight hours sleep. Uh, just cause it my fucking age, man. I can't be doing like city to city to city to city, 10 days, two shows almost every fucking night, you know? Oh my God, I was going to say this, but by the end of the tour I'm going to have a fucking cane. I saw a guy last night, it was people that have fucking chains and it's just like, dude, you don't need a fucking chain. This guy was like walking with his cane and he would take like three steps before you put the cane down. You know, it was like watching a point guard, dribbling the ball up the court. Were you just watching the whole time going? Like the guy's fucking traveling.

Speaker 1:          00:15:37       If you ever sat on an NBA game, like you fucking watch these guys, the bouncing the ball like so fucking high and he watched him. One, two, three bounce. One, two, three bounce. One, two, three pounds. One to bounce, one, two, three. It's just like, and she's supposed to, I mean that wasn't really a step and a half. I Dunno how it fucking works. I'm done. I'm done pitching about sports and the way it is nowadays. I've finally given into the fact that his, his change and speaking of which my patriots beat the New York jets, who I was impressed with their quarterback. I don't know if he's going to be the Guy Buddy. Uh, you know, you never know. It might be coaching, might be his line. I have no idea. But he made some good frozen, there was a lot of fucking heavy hits by their defense.

Speaker 1:          00:16:15       You know, they have an another rough year or whatever, but um, we handled them. We got a playoff spot. We got to buy for the nighttime nine years in a row we got to buy. But that fucking mother fucking stupid ass fucking Dolphin's game now. Now we're going to have to go through Casey. If we win our game and they win their game. Wait, we're gonna have to go through Kansas City. We have to try to beat those fucking guys again in their own goddamn building. And, um, I dunno, I don't, I don't, I just don't see that happening with the, I dunno, which weird this year we have actually have a really good running game it seems. Um, but it's hard to gauge because we were playing the jets and they were all banged up on defense. So I don't, I don't really know where the fuck we stand here, but, um, but who knows.

Speaker 1:          00:17:05       Kansas City, you know, they also have to win, which is not something that they've done in the post season for a long fucking time. But, uh, that my home's guys on a whole other level and I don't know that, you know, Paul Versey made up a great fucking point. I'm just saying that, you know, I don't, I think this is the first time Andy Reid has ever had a quarterback. I know we had done of and McNabb and all that shit. But I really think this smart homes guy, he has that, he seems to have that you almost have to be like not human at the end of the game where you just don't feel emotion.

Speaker 2:          00:17:44       You know,

Speaker 1:          00:17:50       Bruce, he basically said, all right, I don't like, cause I liked him that if he goes, this is the first time, you know, he had, he has got a guy like bombs. He didn't have a guy, you know.

Speaker 2:          00:18:01       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:18:01       You know, he was in Philadelphia and had a guy who puked in the fucking huddle or whatever. Um, which I don't know, that's probably overblown. Oh, who knows. He probably went to a party the night before, I'm sure fucking Ken Stabler puked in a couple of fucking huddles. Um, anyways, and uh, congratulations to the Cleveland browns and just a great season. And uh, I was really pulling for you guys yesterday just to see you have a winning season and all that shit. Um, I dunno, we'll say this is going to be a great post season. Of course I'm gonna be overseas and miss some of it and if my patriots aren't going to win at all, I almost want us to lose in the first round just so I can sit there and fucking enjoy it. I know I'm going to enjoy, uh, the NFC, um, playoffs just as far as like, you know, the saints have home field. I still don't think drew Brees has ever gotten the fuck him respect he deserves, he's one of those guys where he's going to have to win two to people for people to be oh yeah. But then again, Elis one, two, when they're treating him like a fucking stepchild. Um,

Speaker 1:          00:19:11       I dunno when the rams were just killing it the whole season and then they kind of had that little dip there and now they're kind of back. But they also played the 40 niners so I dunno. I Dunno. And then you got Seattle and they got Pete Carroll's a great fucking coach. Anything can happen and then Chicago has that great tea. This is going to be fucking fun. It's going to be fun. I always always kind of wondered too, like what Brady must feel like being this far into his goddamn career where he must feel like a, a fucking a townie at the bar and everybody else has kind of gotten on with their lives. Just looking around the locker room, like where the fuck is everybody that I used to know? They're all fucking gone and in like there's no quarterback left in the league that was playing when he started out. I mean, I almost think like,

Speaker 1:          00:20:02       I mean he makes fucking Eli and drew Brees look like youngsters. Um, kind of the way the rolling stones kept Aerosmith young for so long where they were able to kind of breeze through their forties, 50s and into their sixties, because the stones were always 10 years older than them. So everyone was always making the old jokes with, with them. So, um, I dunno, and for all you fucking, uh, Europe counts over there. I did watch Liverpool arsenal, I watched until it was three to one and then daddy duty took over. Bo Arsenal goes up one to nothing and I'm thinking, okay, you know, that fucking guy does his little dancey slides on his knees. And I'm like, Oh, here we go. Arsenal. I arsenals actually a team that I've fucking heard they must be, they must be one of the good fucking teams. And then, uh, the Liverpool guys, they just went right down the fucking field. Like fucking three minutes later, Bam, 90 seconds later, Bam, which you never see in fucking soccer, football, whatever the hell you call it. It's the same guy who are, you guys hadn't scored at all in the premier league? MMM. Just weak ass fucking defense.

Speaker 1:          00:21:15       The one we're most salad kind of fucking weaved his way through and then made that sick pass to put the third goal or something. When they showed the diff defense in slow motion, it looks lit. Literally looked like they were extras in a movie and mall was like the star that they had to make look good. So they would do in these halfhearted sort of, I don't know what, trying to get their foot in the way. It's like, don't they usually just fucking stick a clean right in the back of your fucking Achilles? I Dunno. I don't know shit about these Goddamn that God damn sport, but I have been watching or whatever. Um, all right. Let me read a little bit of advertising here. Um, what do we got here? This is, I'll simply safe everybody. Don't you want to be simply safe in 2019? Isn't that where you want to be? Simply safe? Uh, we all put off doing things we, we know we need to do. I mean, we know we need to do organize the garage or,

Speaker 2:          00:22:09       yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:22:09       please personalize your own ideas. Yeah. They literally trying to write this.

Speaker 2:          00:22:17       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:22:17       In my, my fucking, the way I speak, this is all written like this. We all put off things we know we need to do. I mean, we know we need to organize the garage.

Speaker 2:          00:22:29       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:22:29       But something always gets in the way. Funny how home security can be like that, you know? Well, what I need to organize, um, I dunno, I cleaned up my fucking drum room, change the head on all my drums, so you know what I actually do.

Speaker 2:          00:22:46       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:22:46       Moved all the drums out of there and I brought a little vacuum cleaner and they were, and I, all the fucking, all the fucking shavings and shit and broken drum sticks and all that from the, uh, from the drum sticks, vacuumed all of that shit up. And, um, yeah. I don't know what this has to do with safes, but that was definitely a personal story. Funny how some security can be like that. You know, it's a good idea, but there's always something holding you back. Well, now it's time to act because simply safe home security, extended holiday sale ends soon. Simply safe believes nothing should come between you and protecting your home. So they've gotten rid of the reasons not to get home security. There's no contract, no price markups from any middleman and no installation windows. Who has time for that? Who has time for that?

Speaker 1:          00:23:35       Most of them. Well, you're not going to do it. You can hire somebody to do it. I guess most importantly, their system is engineered to do one thing brilliantly protect. So if a storm takes out power, simply safe is ready. If an intruder cuts your phone line, simply safe is ready. If they destroy your keypad or a siren, simply safe. We'll get you the help you need. Maybe it's overkill. Maybe it's the last thing you want to think about this holiday. But with simply safe, you're always ready for anything. Just go to simply safe.com/burr and order January before January 8th to save with their extended holiday sale. That's simply safe.com/bar hi, simply safe.com/bar all right. Simply spelled s, I. M p. L. I. S. A. F. E has the eye instead of the why. You know like the way a hot chick spells her name, you know what I mean?

Speaker 2:          00:29:05       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:29:05       Now this is some shit that I would never do. I would never think to do. I would never think to join a country club. I don't golf. Um, although I watched this thing on tiger woods,

Speaker 2:          00:29:19       mmm.

Speaker 1:          00:29:21       Tiger Woods last night with some sort of fucking 30 for 30.

Speaker 2:          00:29:27       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:29:27       Basically on his return to finally winning, you know, his body was all broken down on all that shit and they came back and he won and other ratings went like through the roof and all that. It was just fucking awesome that she was back. And you know, when people love to watch greatness, if you love to watch greatness, that reflects more on you rather than the person that you fucking watching. Cause you just fucking pissed off about your own life. Why wouldn't you want to see somebody go out and be the greatest of all time? And anyways, um, so I went over there to smoke a cigar and um,

Speaker 2:          00:29:59       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:30:00       And I went over there. It was, it was a fucking utopia. Like I would literally join a country club and never play golf.

Speaker 2:          00:30:09       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:30:10       I went over there. They had all the NFL Games on, they had all this food, they were pouring booze the way I pour booze at home, I call it like a home poor. They were pouring in like that. Fortunately I wasn't drinking because I drove over there and that would have been a situation. It would have to look left my fucking car there. But, um, everybody just hanging out break and fucking balls. It was great. And I gotta be honest with you. It was nice,

Speaker 2:          00:30:36       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:30:37       As a guy to know that that still existed. It was just fun. You know, that's like one of those things that like feminists go after and it's just like we're not doing anything wrong. And then I hung out over there for like three hours hanging out with all the guys, everybody breaking balls, telling stories, watching the game, trying to fucking coach what was on the TV, smoking cigars, classic Guy Shit. And then I was done. And then I came home to my wife and I was psyched. And then it was around this female energy. It was perfect. It was like, dare I say balanced and um,

Speaker 2:          00:31:13       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:31:13       Do you know how this is this whole fucking weird thing going on right now, that if everybody is not included, meaning both sexes, that for some reason that means that there's something wrong about it. You know, I don't know. I don't fucking get it. Like, you know, a bunch of women going out to Brunch is great for them. They get to be around that. They totally vibe with that fucking energy. Then after a while, I imagine they, you know, go onto my fucking dumb guy. I'm with absence, makes the heart grow fonder, you know, and I understand to a certain level where there was just like, you know,

Speaker 1:          00:31:51       entities and business and schmoozing and all that that weren't letting, you know, forget about women but other races of people and all that, you know, I'm, I'm, you know, obviously not down with that. I think everybody ought to be able to go wherever the fuck they want to go as long as you're not a fucking jerk off, but I don't, but I draw the line at that thing where it's just everything has to have men and women mixed together. I think, uh, that a lot of shit should, but I, there's definitely they do it. They should just be some shit that's just for women. Oh, just for men. And even then just for men, you know, when you call you here, I, even, the way I worded that, I made sure they said just for women first before these fucking lunatics with, I don't know what the f I've been doing this bit right now, talking about, um, how these private schools work.

Speaker 2:          00:32:42       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:32:43       Now where you have to like audition your kids over there and they're trying to like get this perfect balance racially and, and, and gender and all of that. And it's just like, it's, it's like their heart is in the right place, but it just feels like this giant fucking

Speaker 2:          00:33:03       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:33:04       Like experiment, like some weird like Nazi shit. Like what are you doing? What the fuck are we, the kids just let them be kids and they, this is all gonna work out itself. They're trying to, like, they're trying to curate the, the painless childhood. I think that that's what they're going for. They're going to try to like have kids have, you know, a childhood without any pain. Um, which I guess then the theory is, is that then they would go out into the world.

Speaker 2:          00:33:37       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:33:37       And they wouldn't inflict any pain on anybody, but it's just like eventually, you know,

Speaker 2:          00:33:45       okay,

Speaker 1:          00:33:45       you got to go out in the real world and this is going to be pain. There's going to be disappointment, there's gonna be people stealing your shit, and you're going to have to know how to deal with that. And that's kind of like what school is. You learn how to stand up to bullies and all that. I'm not saying the kid should go to school and have a miserable fucking experiences, but like there is like a certain element of it that you got, you gotta let him fucking handle it themselves.

Speaker 2:          00:34:05       Right.

Speaker 1:          00:34:07       The only way that you could possibly,

Speaker 2:          00:34:11       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:34:11       I don't know how it would work. You would have to get rid of all the sociopaths in all the selfish fucking people in the world first. He would literally have to, and you'd have to kill them. This whole fucking thing that you're going to stick them on a fucking island. He ended, all they're gonna do is just fuck each other and make like fucking roided up sociopath's selfish people. And then eventually one of them is going to not to make a boat and then that's going to be yet, then they're going to come over and we're all going to be over here like, you know, puts you right in, take your right hand up, fucking singing the Hokey pokey and weren't going to get steamrolled. You like how I put myself not on the island. You like, I want that story. I was the fucking hero and I wasn't, I wasn't a selfish cunt. Like I wouldn't be over there. Um, I dunno. It is, it is weird. But, uh, I already know what I'm going to do. I'm going to, I'm going to, uh, get my daughter enrolled in some sort of like a,

Speaker 1:          00:35:05       you know, anti bully, Jujitsu fucking Shit, just so my daughter knows how to handle herself and then that's it. And then just make sure you don't abuse the skill set that you now have. And if anybody comes out, yeah. You know, you fucking handle it. It gives you confidence and then you don't have to spend your whole fucking childhood in this depressive fog of dreading going to school and shit. You know, and I think back as some of the periods I went through and some of this shit, some other kids that I picked on went through, I'd fucking, it was like, Oh man, that's, that's, that's why I'm surprised too that like teachers intervene a little bit more, not to the point that they're doing it now to the point that they're doing it now, where they're just fucking like a, it's almost like reverse Hitler where everyone is included, but they're also deciding like, who is the number one draft pick? There's still, you know, boxing out other people. It's weird. It's just a really fucking weird, I dunno, it's just such a weird God damn time. All right. That's, that's it. When my little fucking pontificating there. Let's, uh, let's do a little bit of the, uh, some of the reeds here for the week. Um, all right. What do we got here? Who as far as twos first? Um,

Speaker 2:          00:36:22       yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:36:23       All right. Good Times. Bad Times. How I learned. Hey Billy Bass drum balls. I learned good times, bad times when I was 12 or 13. You mother fucker. Thanks to my drum teacher. No, that's awesome man. He taught me, he'll doubt he taught me heel down technique. It showed me that the trick to getting those fast flutter kicks was to move your foot halfway down the pedal. Your heel should be completely off the pedal. Oh yeah. I've seen that. You just slide up and down. Uh, this counteracts the spring tension and helps you play faster at the expense of power. Oh, at the expense of power. All right. Eventually by doing this enough, you will be able to play those flutters without this. Uh,

Speaker 2:          00:37:09       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:37:09       Without this trek. Uh, it's like training wheels. If you play heal up, you should be able to make the swivel technique work. It's a valuable trick. I have tab up your sleeve and you don't lose any punch. I've included a link on how to do it if you aren't too sure. I also recommend playing cashmere is a warmup before jumping into good times, bad times. He does some slower flutter kicks that will loosen you up. I hope. Uh,

Speaker 2:          00:37:36       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:37:36       I hope I could help you on happy new year and go fuck yourself. Um, what I learned finally because I was doing it the wrong way, the first way I did it before I took any drum lessons. When I would do it, I would do this weird thing, what I would curl my toe down. Yeah. Push. And then almost like I was almost doing that slide, move with like my toes and I got plantar Fisher, I to my foot. My technique was so bad that my drum teacher was teaching me his technique and I didn't understand it. And then I didn't go in for a while and I learned it. I was almost doing like a reverse slide. Like I was, I was bringing my foot back and that was the slide. And then pushing forward down. Um,

Speaker 2:          00:38:19       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:38:20       So the first one was like, light was almost like an unaccented beat. So it was like, Duh, Duh, Duh, Duh, Duh, Duh. And then another time I was doing it, the first one was louder. It was like Duh, Duh, Duh, Duh, Duh, Duh. And it never sounded even so the way he just taught me, which is it was, has been a total game changer in like the last fucking three days I've been messing with this shit

Speaker 3:          00:38:45       is all right, I play a DW drum pedal. All right? So when you just play in a single, the Bali of, first of all, you sit back and he should be able to see your ankles a little bit. I was sitting too close, so my, my knee was directly above my foot and that was fucking with, you know, my technique and they was in the own past up to a certain tempo. It was getting in the way. So we had me move back, which felt really fucking weird at first and now it feels great. So basically if you were playing a single, you felt you're just, you know, lift your leg up and boom, come right down on the DW. But when you play, hang on, oh fuck. Hang on. She's coming in the island. All right. The lovely knee is here. Let me, I've got to finish, explain something here. How are you, you know, your shirt oddly matches the, uh, the windscreen there. Yeah. Um, so anyways, the windscreen that I use when I'm inside, so anyway, it's self, you're playing a single, you just lift your foot up and hot air, you're blowing and that's right.

Speaker 3:          00:39:47       You bring it right down on the DW, but then if you're going to play a double, all you do is you slide your foot back where you are right below the nine, I played the 9,000. So if you play the 5,000 right below the five and then you, you just bring your foot down like you're playing a single. So that first one is strong. Okay. Like a single. And then as, as you know, and you let the beat or come off the head and you catch the rebound as you slide it up and then they're both strong in both even. Um, and sound powerful. Yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:40:19       it was just a completely different thing. And what I ended up doing at a slow tempo was just play. Um, like in my time a dime, not playing 16th on the high hat, I was just playing dumb

Speaker 3:          00:40:32       boom Bopa debt, but bump up on debt, gone to the tech boom, boom, bump the tempo, something like that, whatever. So it makes sense to drummers. Okay,

Speaker 1:          00:40:44       sends to drama. So what's is key and that it was what I being played like the immigrant song is if you're playing singles and doubles, you get that muscle memory that if you play in a single, you just keep your foot up at the top of the pedal and then when you played the double you B, you're bringing it back. And what happens is your muscle memory is as you're playing, whatever the fuck you playing right before that first note of the double, your foot's already moving back into position and be the same thing if you're playing a double pedal where after what? Like when you first go from a single to a double pedal, that the fucking brain power that you have to use to move your left foot from the high hat over to the slave pedal if you play a double pedal is like fucking ridiculous. But then after awhile you just, your foot just knows to just sort of just slide, just to come over that, you know, literally four inches. But when you first start out, it's kind of the same. Things like that. All right, I'm done. Sorry

Speaker 4:          00:41:34       Nia, you literally just fucking glazed over. Like probably 80% of the people sit upon boom, boom gap. Now. Those were all single bull tap, boom, a wound, whatever. It's soundproof. It's something that I do. It's something you should have. Good. They sound it. You can't hear it. Can you hear it? No, I can't hear it from the house now. Yeah. Perfect. That's fucking perfect. So how are you, how was your Christmas? It was lovely. How's your Christmas? It was wonderful. How was your New Year? You're doing Christmas? Yes we did. Or Cutie Pie still doesn't get the whole concept. She was more into like opening the presence. She liked the opening and the ripping of the wrapping paper. But after that she was like done. Yes she was. She was like, no point has no present, no present. So that was that. So when I also love, what does she call the Christmas tree?

Speaker 4:          00:42:32       Mcmurtry momentary like Christmas tree. She was like, Mama, Mama, she's so manipulative already and now she knows how to get you, you know, cause she knows how desperate we are for her affection and her hugs and kisses. So she just uses that. They know that already, don't they? Yeah, absolutely. So it's like, you know, she'll ask for something that she knows she's not supposed to have and I'm like, no, you can't have that. The Sonata. And she'll wear me down. I'll be like, all right, you can have a little, she almost, you go mama, please Mama. Or She sees that I'm about to do it. I've given it. And she rushes over and gives me a kiss and a hug. So I was like, she just knows she knows what to do. So what's happening over here? On the old a podcast, they attract suit.

Speaker 4:          00:43:17       Um, oh, I'm loving this tracksuit, tracksuit, tracksuit, got bill all the, a couple of tracks suits for Christmas because it's just like what he likes to live in slash travel in. So you really never do what, what's verse he's been telling me to do forever. And I never had always had like track pants on and stuff at the airport and like a zip up. No, cause you know what happens is because I, I forget my wallet or phone, most of them don't have back pockets. That was that time I went to the airport and I missed my flight because I had my phone in my front pocket and I wasn't even thinking I didn't have my wallet and I didn't have my license. And then I had a flight fucking private that costs me a zillion dollars. That's, it was an afternoon gig. Yeah. So I get super paranoid and then I don't like, I don't like sweatpants when I fly because shit just slides out of your pockets and then your wallet goes underneath the seats if somebody has to find the fucking thing.

Speaker 4:          00:44:12       So, um, but other than that, they're great to fly in. So I just, you know something, I put it in the the hopefully, yes. See these don't have zipper pockets. Yes. So this is a very vulnerable, this is like the thing that the Gypsies over there and you're not supposed to say Gypsies by the way. I don't know what, see if that's no offense. I don't think so. I think you're, you're not supposed to say I got gypped anymore cause I think that's offensive. Um, Gypsies, Gypsies, but I actually like you're not supposed to call them. I don't know. Isn't there a TV show called like Gypsy nation or something? I Dunno. I think Gypsy's is fine. But maybe you associate them with like pick pocketing and being scammers or you mean like what happened to us when we were over there is rude and you're not supposed to say that.

Speaker 4:          00:45:07       You're not supposed to say what the fuck is happening. No. All right, well then fine. I don't need to get involved in this cause I'm going to fucking eastern Europe of right, exactly. Probably lay off the old gray, the harmful history of gypsy. This is on bitch media. So I don't think that this is going to be what is with all these fucking people asking for money. All right. Uh, as a Romanian woman, right, more often called by the racial slur gypsy, I didn't know that was a, that's a racial slur. Yeah. I, I feel like I learned that a couple of years ago, but I'm, but I watch TV networks, original Siri Gypsy with some trepidation. The show is a psychological thriller for the most part, without many thrills, but blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. He watched show that I watched two episodes and then for the show takes its inspiration from Stevie Nicks Song Gypsy about a free spirited woman who loves and disappears.

Speaker 4:          00:46:05       So to me that's what a gypsy was. A Gypsy was just the nomadic person. Like I didn't know any of this shit about pickpocket and all that shit. The mythos. So he said, oh, the gyms is of the Gypsy is a steward stereotype. The thief, the Fortune Teller, the free spirit, the seductress and the liar. And Jean hits all of them, rebranding them as characteristics of a wealthy white woman. Just trying to find herself. That's kind of true. Wait, what's that song? Gypsy was, man, what's that? What's that song that's from the said no, it's witchy woman. Oh, you're so racist against gypsy. You're throwing that word in. Wow. I'm not, no, I, you know, I tried to be sensitive to stuff like that.

Speaker 5:          00:46:54       Oh,

Speaker 4:          00:46:56       what is it now? It's witchy woman. Ooh. Where'd you

Speaker 5:          00:46:59       Ooh,

Speaker 4:          00:47:02       it's not gypsy. We'll see how you obviously know the lyrics more than I do. Well I think just for, you know, just don't call anybody a gypsy. Alright, I'll try it. If I have a Stevie nicks song, the Romanian people are an oppressed ethnic minority who's disparate roots date back to the 10th century, India and are currently in the midst of century long human rights crisis. See now it's interesting to me cause they

Speaker 1:          00:47:29       have their own country because of Romania. Right? Don't they? Isn't that their own country? I feel like everything that I'm saying is fucking offending somebody here. Probably who, who are who

Speaker 4:          00:47:39       passing them? Um, I don't know. I mean, I know Russia controlled a lot of that part. Can we blame them? The Russians, can we blame them? They're like, you can blame the Russians and it's okay. I don't know. Probably not long

Speaker 1:          00:47:55       when rights crisis, one part is one that is in part perpetuated by the stereotypes of the Gypsies yet almost no one but the, but the Roman themselves are pushing back on the series title slur, the writing to the network and producers are creating petition to change the show's title along with simple ignorance. Anti Romanian sentiment is so normalized that in 2017 a premiere streaming service can release a show that takes an actual racial slur and its title and no one bats an eyelash. Well, in defense of Netflix over here, Gypsy sort of a cool, hey man, like I'm not stuck in the matrix kind of thing like over here. It doesn't mean that

Speaker 4:          00:48:36       like I never thought like Gypsy yet was definitely fortune teller. It was us and then I then think of like a just a frisk, bearded hippy. I would like growing up, you hear like a gypsy person that someone who is, you know, yeah. Doing like scams and stuff. So you heard that I didn't even know I associated it with, and then we'll either go to Europe and people were like, be careful of the Gypsies, a Rabi let you know what I mean. And then I didn't know that Gypsies were an af actual ethnicity. Right. I just thought it was like a hippie. Anybody can be a fucking hippie man. And you get a tambourine and grow your fucking hair and smoke a little grass and all of a sudden the hippie and all this. Yeah. All of a sudden you're in the drum drum culture.

Speaker 4:          00:49:18       Right? That's not it. That's not inferior in a drum circle and hippie. But I'm no bro. No, no, no, no, no, no, no. But I'm saying, I thought Gypsy was like that. Well, I could, I could become a hippie if I've got some hair transplants and started smoking some weed man. And just did you know, wearing Birkenstocks. I could be considered a hippie. I didn't know that it was an ethnicity. Right. So we're learning something here. Wait, would you ever get one of those scalp Taiwan? Let you do it. One of those scalps what did they call it? Scalp transplants. Like the Tattoo Scalp. Oh yeah, no, it's, that's different than a scalp transplant off a murderer. And then I have even more of a temper. I can help transplant scouts or has flat, uh, yeah, I forgot what it's called. Anyway, someone else people don't follow on.

Speaker 4:          00:50:03       Instagram does it for people. Like it's a new thing that he started to do and he calls it like the scalp shop or something. And so I was watching a video of the process. It's not a new thing that's been around for a while. Oh, it has. I know it's a Tatsu. Yeah, I knew a guy that did it is a, it's permanent then. No, it actually fades. You supposed to keep your head out of the light. But what it looks like, it ends up looking like I have a full head of hair, but just tried to shape

Speaker 1:          00:50:28       a, decided to shave it down. It's not like a five o'clock shadow on your head. Yeah. But then what? This is what's weird to me. It's like now I got to shake my head every fucking day. A variety because that is going to be weird because then the stumbled, the real hair is going to be coming up and then the rest of the shit, I think you can go like a day or two before it starts looking stupid. Yeah, I know. I am not a, I am not a big believer in fucking with nature.

Speaker 4:          00:50:52       Okay. So if, if nature has matrix then letting you know,

Speaker 1:          00:50:57       play the hand that you're dealt and you, you play it to the best. Right. So I keep myself in shape. I grew the beard, I just shaved it off and you know, this is who I am talking about shaving your beard off the other day. And I was just like, why would you ever do that? Because I miss my face. Oh Jesus. Nia, you may be familiar, familiar with the word Jip, which means to cheat someone right as a gypsy would. It's a slur as obviously offensive as Jew down. And yet people still say it. Say what you down, you never heard that you grew up in Massachusetts for awhile? I mean I lived there until I was like sex. I grew up in Atlanta once you would think. Yeah,

Speaker 4:          00:51:41       yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:51:42       I know there, there are Jewish people, they got tails like they went to a whole other level down there and yet people still say in everyday and everyday combination. Imagine replacing Gypsy Gypsy as the show title with another ethnic slur. The show would never have been made and yet gypsy was made riding on the back of their romantic popularization of the world of fashion, beauty and social media. Yet that's how I view it.

Speaker 4:          00:52:06       No. So I guess I will stop saying gypsy. Yeah. And sobs. I will say Romanian we speak. Speaking of tails, cause you mentioned tales earlier. Did you see that video on Twitter?

Speaker 6:          00:52:22       Ooh,

Speaker 4:          00:52:24       Romanian woman? No. Did you see that video on Twitter of the raccoon? This is in Florida. Raccoon. You know Mike, one of my least favorite animals, like attacking a lizard, like one of those big fucking lizards and like, like chasing it through a parking lot. Oh my God, man. The heebie jeebies just thinking about it, chasing it through a parking lot and just like thinking it's like tea than to its neck and just holding it down and then like dragging it out of frame and then the person pans over to what looks like a snake flapping around and you're just like, what the fuck is going on? Then you realize it's the tail. It's the Lizard's tale that has somehow gotten like away from the lizards body and it's still flapping around on its own. It's the most spots of video. Everett's and I love nature video watching.

Speaker 4:          00:53:08       I fucking hate falls. It's so, I don't hate reptiles. Ooh, regret rub. Can you imagine calling your show reptiles a yes. Did I come in here to answer a question or no? No, no. I to see a raccoon verse Lizard. Yeah. Florida. Cause you know all that shit always happens. Oh yeah. Florida is fucking crazy. Raccoon kills a Guana and Guana. Oh Man, I like Iguanas AG. You're bound to get your heartbroken. Oh No. Oh yes. Oh I like, Rudolph was so brutal, Dude. What the fuck does Gordon Ramsay have to do with the goddamn lizard eat. Oh, I see. He's fixing these people's restaurant. That's hilarious. Do my favorite part about him going to his restaurants is when Gordon Ramsay starts gagging. Right. There's always something in the fucking freezer. No, it smells that bed when they have meat from like, yeah, 2002 when there, yeah. Oh my God. He one time, like he, I thought he was just acting and then the camera man almost puked. I was like, Oh wow, that's real. [inaudible]. Here we go. Oh No.

Speaker 7:          00:54:29       Oh No. He's going,

Speaker 4:          00:54:34       oh,

Speaker 7:          00:54:35       should I stop the fight?

Speaker 4:          00:54:37       No.

Speaker 7:          00:54:38       Yeah, he's dead. Let him go dog.

Speaker 4:          00:54:45       Where the fuck did that? God Damn

Speaker 7:          00:54:49       Holy.

Speaker 2:          00:54:50       It's on a basis,

Speaker 7:          00:54:53       please.

Speaker 2:          00:54:54       Sure.

Speaker 4:          00:54:57       Oh Jesus Christ. Let me ask you this question. Who Does? Nobody has an Iguana in flips a pet, so we just let that thing go. Hmm. Well, you just saw was how long I would last in prison. You know? I was really like that guy was saying that fucking lizard did not have a goddamn chance. Yeah. It's not natural to fucking Florida. Somebody got sick of feed nick grasshoppers and it, it is let it go and then it got eaten by a fuck. You might not lizard been like, what in the fuck is this thick? You would survive in prison based on your windows and your yeah. Well no because you like have so much anger inside of you that you would be able to channel it and you'd be able to like the funny like killer guy. He'll make you laugh but all he'll make you cry.

Speaker 4:          00:55:43       No, sorry. I was thinking I've learned from anybody in prison. It's just like some of the toughest fucking guys I haven't met. They were like, do not go in there acting like you're the toughest fucking guy cause you're not. Who has conversations like this? Like why do you even think about like how you would do in prison? Like are you, is there something that you need to tell me? No, it's just she just watched those things. They made some fucking option. Yeah. Can happen. I never think about that and everything about how would I do in prison. Even your privileged world. Oh here we go. Wait. But I want to say something about the, um, we'll try to say, oh wait, wait, wait. So that guy on the video was saying, oh, should I break up the fight? Should I stop it? And I said, no, I don't understand why people where people feel like they need to get like involved in nature and nature.

Speaker 4:          00:56:29       I was reading this article, I saw that. What do you mean? Because whoever, I probably fucking bought that Lizard to Florida was a white person on some levels. Guessing. Well, I'm just saying like sometimes you just have to let, I left this comment on New York, the New York magazine Instagram page, because they had a whole article about how seals are snorting eels, seals, sea lions are snorting eels as like this. They're like, they're young and they snore them. It's like for fun or something like that. And someone left a comment like, oh, I hope whoever took that picture, like put the camera down and like intervenes and like help that poor sea lion. And I was like, sometimes you've just got to let nature nature wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. This snorting, they're snorting yields. Wait, you have to Google as sea lions are snorting eels, like following like a line of coke.

Speaker 4:          00:57:18       Yes. And there's a picture of a snail with like a sea lion or the very satisfied look on his face with an eel up its nose. That's just what they're doing now. I don't know why, but someone was like, oh, somebody should intervene and pull it out and just let nature do what it's gonna do. Planking or like throwing the water bottle and having it land. Yeah, they were little Instagram. Yeah, that's exactly what scientists were saying. They like, it's a new thing that they just apparently are just doing for fun because they can do so it's like just let them smart. Like you don't have to get involved to like seal. Like why? What does, I dunno. I don't understand that impulse to intervene when nature is nature occurring, people are control freaks. It's one thing if you see iot attacking your cat or dog of course.

Speaker 4:          00:58:03       But I mean if it's, if it has sea lion and the eel or an Iguana and a flush of what you're saying, you're saying that a dog and a cat is more of an animal worth saving than a lizard or an eel. One of them is that his animals, racism, animal phobic. Speciesism you're wild a phobic. You don't like wild animals. No, I'm saying if they're in the wild and they're doing their thing, just let, let them do what they're going to do. Why do you need to get involved and like, oh, how do you decide whose side to beyond just because the iguanas losing, all of a sudden you're anti the raccoon like you know, go lighter skin. You pick the lighter skin analog. Okay. Repairing electronics. All right, so I'm not saying Gypsy anymore. My apologies to a Romanian people. Yeah, you don't have that screwed, but then that's saying offensive prostitutes. I'm going to say like boxes or something. No carpenters. All right on on. He screwed me. Hey, I've been a carpenter on repairing electronics. Hello Bill. You mentioned in a previous podcast that you like getting your electronics repaired and even knew a guy that did that. It's amazing with a quick youtube video, people can repair their own products. Well guess what apple

Speaker 1:          00:59:22       like always is that one company that likes to shit all over that they seize shipments with quality third parties, party parts from these repair shops because they want you to pay the 800 plus she would otherwise be saving. Wow. Trusted repair shops get third party parts illegal. But apple likes legally sorry, but apple likes to have customers hold them from these guys and make them pay obnoxious fees to receive the packages. When you have the time, take a look at this short video. You know, we should ask the pys. It goes too far. Are Our electronics are parents like our computers and stuff? We should ask them about that. You know what? We found a repairman who uh, just fixed our stove and it's fucking amazing. He, what did you say? He made that stuff is bad. He did. He took the whole thing apart.

Speaker 1:          01:00:14       So now we had, we had, we have a 10 year old Viking stove that is now 2018 it's basically a resto mod. If you were into cars, which is if you had an 1965 whatever, and on top it looks like 1965 oh wait, so it doesn't do, it doesn't do that anymore when I wish you wouldn't either. I don't have time to watch this, but I'm definitely going to watch this. It's called a, the name of this video is apple under fire for allegation of controversial business practices. Did you get this for the baby? Oh wait, is this yours? Oh yeah, I was going to give that the Bert Kreischer, I forgot that is a Florida state half shirt that I bought in 1981 or 82 and never wore it. I crop top. I never wore vintage Florida state crop top half shirt. Crop top. No, they'll call the half shirts back then.

Speaker 1:          01:01:05       You're going to give it to time for Chrysler? Yeah. Wow. Can he fit like an arm in here? No, I didn't realize it's a small, you know what?

Merry Christmas to you and yours and I hope you're having a lovely restful festive break. I just wanted to weigh in on your home saunas. Som Sana comments. I couldn't remember. I couldn't recommend getting one more. I live in west Wales and built a sauna three years ago. It's the perfect way to level your body and mind three times a week is perfect, but I generally do to, the best way I found is 15 minutes in the sauna to a cold shower out cold outdoor shower, three repeat steps one and two, three times and all. Uh, the level of chill I have afterwards can only otherwise be obtained by illegal means. It's awesome. I'm telling you any of this is going to help us if I get something like this. Looking forward to seeing you in Manchester.

Uh, and I'm thinking Liverpool's going to be the same way in all like all up to there. I'm not doing a new castle, I don't think, but I just feel like all up there is that type of shit where London is more like Manhattan, where it's all refined oils, real phones. Uh, thanks for bringing up my workweek and look after yourself. I would love to figure out a way to do this. I just don't have the room here. What's wrong with the steam though? That's different from, well, a sauna you can go way harder because with steam it's, it's, it's so wet. Like I mean is steam.

Speaker 1:          01:03:30       You can actually sit in a sauna it like close to 200 degrees and if you were in a sauna where it was just all, all on Asana, fucking steam. Yeah. Yeah. You literally be getting to the point where the water on you was getting close to starting to boil. You know, he could burn yourself. I never understood. This is, and this is also me speaking, just trying to remember repeating what people were talking about Saunas, but I am sold on them. Um, to the point.
