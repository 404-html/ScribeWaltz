Speaker 1:          00:00:01       Hey, what's going on? It's bill burn. It's the Monday morning podcasts from Monday, August 5th, 2013. How are you, how are you doing this morning? All of that. She has fantastic, this is going to be another subdued William Burr here on the Monday morning podcast. As you can tell, I wasn't able to find a fucking cord from my mixer. So, um, the lovely Nia is going to send me mine. Uh, so next, this will be the last week of this kind of stuff. So I've had difficulty trying to find basically everything here in New Orleans. For those of you just listening, I haven't listened for the past couple of weeks. I'm here in New Orleans. I'm doing the, uh, what do you call it? The final episode of Glee for this season. It's like some three hour extravaganza. So I have to be out here forever. And you know, like I mentioned, I am going to be shirtless in the cafeteria scene, so I've been trying to try to get healthy food out here, which is practically impossible. I haven't been able to find it. If there's any New Orleans people, I guess they don't say knowledge, by the way. I was told that the other night that they don't say that. That's just some Hollywood shit. And then, uh, I taught that person how to properly say Boston, B, a w Boston, not Boston. So we both had a laugh and then we ate some fried fucking oysters because everything's fried down here. You know, I go into Verizon, I need a new cell phone.

Speaker 1:          00:01:35       You know, they didn't have the entire thing. They just had the part you plug into your fucking computer. So unless I was going to walk around with my computer and then bring that plug, plugged that in and then plug the fucking cell phone into my computer, that was the only way for me to charge it when I was on the road. So I'm sitting there going like, you know, I'm becoming a top of shit here. And I have my big shirtless scene, you know, I'm singing a eight, six, seven, five, three Oh nine, Jenny. Uh, but the jazz it up a little bit, but uh,

Speaker 1:          00:02:11       anyway, so I find someplace to get a juice. And uh, even then the way they do the juice, you know, usually you use the apple, you use the fruit to give it a little zing so you can drink the fucking green shit. But they do it the opposite down here. It's apple juice and then they'll add like half a leaf of Kale in there. And I just kind of hop and yourself up on sugar. So, um, I actually, I do have a game plan dot people, um, after your wonderful suggestions where you like, Bill, why don't you watch that documentary fat sick and nearly dead? And I'm like, well, yeah, I've already watched those, you know, Food Inc and I watched

Speaker 2:          00:02:53       uh, uh,

Speaker 1:          00:02:56       Drylok [inaudible] fucking uh, Morgan Spurlock try like [inaudible] yeah, it's a famous percussionist from India.

Speaker 3:          00:03:05       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:03:07       I fucking, uh, I mean that's how you can say his name built. Just get to the point on right. The fuck was my point. Oh, Morgan Spurlock. Is that his name? I watched that. What? He Ate Mcdonald's for 30 fucking days in a row. And uh, I mean, you know what's great about that? You knew what you knew his body was going to be junk, but secretly haven't you always wanted to do that? Just say fuck it. Just blow your body out.

Speaker 3:          00:03:37       You know,

Speaker 1:          00:03:39       just deep I would, how much weight you actually could gain if you really put your mind to it.

Speaker 3:          00:03:44       You know,

Speaker 1:          00:03:46       this is what I do. I would start with a grand slam breakfast and then I have to take a nap cause I'm old. When you get older, by the way, when you eat really bad, you know, rather than just running outside like you do as a youngster, it takes a toll on you. He actually have to go lay down and try to sleep yourself back into some sort of balance. I don't know what put a, yeah, I'd probably start with that.

Speaker 3:          00:04:10       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:04:11       Lunchtime or would I do steak and cheese

Speaker 1:          00:04:15       so you know what it is? That kind of food itself fucks me up now. I can't even enjoy it anymore. That's what happens as you get older. It's like you fucking guts. I like some engine that your entire life you went down like two quarts of oil on and it just doesn't run as well as it used to. You know, back when you were younger, you could do fucking neutral drops and fucking be driving 40 miles an hour and just yanked the emergency brake. It cut the wheel and almost tip over your fucking Volkswagen Fox like my buddy did back in the day. You can't do that anymore as you get older, you know, so if you are older and every time you eat, you then have to immediately fall asleep. Uh, you're down a few courts.

Speaker 1:          00:05:01       It's time for a new, ain't want to put a synthetic in there. So anyway, so, um, I've been a, you know, days, I'm not working. I've been kind of bored. I know a lot of you guys already know what I'm working on here in la. Do you guys always go, Bill, why do you try to keep it such a big fucking secret? What you're doing? You can just go to your imdv page and figure out what you're doing. Well, do you ever think that that may be that that's the fucking method to my madness. See, if I just told you what I'm doing down here in New Orleans, you'd be Oh, humble brag or you'd give me shit. You know, easy their care. Don't forget where you came from, Ra.

Speaker 3:          00:05:39       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:05:41       So what I do is I deliberately act vague and then people send me, then they just got an IMD B and they ended up knowing more about what the fuck I'm doing. Then if I told you anyways, and then people send me emails like bill, in order to still be so vague, it's so easy to find out what you're doing. You're doing this, that blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. It's like, there you go. You're dumb. Fuck. That's exactly what I wanted. I wanted you to have the information. I tricked you. Okay. You're coming at me like you just solved the murder case. Like you're fucking Colombo and you're looking away with your crazy eye rubbing your forehead and I'm standing there flabbergasted here in a heartbeat under the floorboards. You got it ass backwards. That's why I'm fig. I want to give you something to do at work.

Speaker 4:          00:06:23       Well, is she going to do sit there and stare at your spreadsheets, figuring out how much fucking grapes costs in the next 20 minutes screaming by myself. I've actually been doing really well with my weight here. Oh, so anyway, so, uh, I finally give in and a, I'm like, all right, I'm not working today. I'm going to go, uh, I'm going to go, uh, yeah, I'm going to watch this fucking fat, sick and nearly dead. And I gotta tell you, man, it was awesome. I absolutely loved it. And, uh, I felt bad for trash and fat people on my podcast, my, my, uh, Billy shade, Billy shame to get back and get back into shape. You know, where I just make fun of the Fed is, um, I mean it was always done in jest, but I don't know if there's one guy that he runs it to that, uh, I don't know.

Speaker 4:          00:07:15       I felt bad for the dude, but anyway, so he goes on this juice fast. So, of course now I'm like obsessed with it, you know, just so I can get some of these fried clams and all this stuff, these po boy sandwiches. Just try to get these out of my system because I'm sick of having to take a nap every time I eat out here. Uh, so I think I'm going to buy a mini juicer and a bunch of Kale and that type of shit. Nah, juice it up and then just shove it down my fucking pie hole,

Speaker 1:          00:07:46       you know? And believe it or not, it fills you up. It fills you up. Do you get used to it? Then you start craving that and uh, and then the best part is you don't have to go to the gym. That's what it's really all about people. That's the number one reason to eat. Well, not so you live longer. It's so you don't have to go to the gym, you don't have to go to the gym and you've, you've clothes still fit. Right.

Speaker 3:          00:08:14       You know,

Speaker 1:          00:08:16       I don't know. It was funny. Somebody you ever, they actually sent me an email call. Bill. Do you have any idea how many times you say, you know, during a podcast and it was, it's just like, yes, of course I do. You know, how the fuck wouldn't I know that thick. I don't listen back to these things as I upload them to try to see if they're funny or not. You know, I got admit if I don't think they're funny, I shut them off really quickly, but they start going,

Speaker 3:          00:08:41       I like them.

Speaker 1:          00:08:43       But I do notice that I say it that, that, that much. But maybe can I have a catch phrase? No, that was actually not even a, but when it wasn't even on you. Now I'm in my own fucking head. I don't want to do that anyways. I'm still here at the hotel. I'm going to buy a juicer and uh, I just figured to two out of three meals a day,

Speaker 3:          00:09:07       I'm going to drink that shit. And uh,

Speaker 1:          00:09:11       yeah, when I come home I want to have an even bigger head.

Speaker 3:          00:09:15       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:09:16       I guess that's the way you can, I know you were, if you come back off the road and your head isn't three sizes bigger, does your girlfriend thank you? Cheated on her. Like what are you in such good shape for? But if you come back, it's like a fed booze hound. Oh, okay. He was faithful.

Speaker 3:          00:09:34       I don't know.

Speaker 1:          00:09:36       Anyway, so let's talk about, let's talk about Major League baseball. Something that I have not watched since 2010 when I just got sick of everybody, you know, testing positive for stuff, particularly people on my team. And uh, it was just like, yeah. You know, it just Kinda took all the, uh, the glory out of those championships and stuff that the red sox won. It did not take any glory away from beating the Yankees in 2004 though. It did not at all because, you know, they had just as many guys, if not some of the worst offenders. You know, I think Andy Pettit woulda got more shit if he wasn't into Jesus. Any, any major league baseball players listing. If you're listening to this and you're doing, if you're on the juice there, what I would do and you feel like the hounds are nipping at your heels. I would air quote find Jesus. You know it. Just start fucking write it on your glove. When you wave to the, when you wave to the camera. Jesus's love. Jesus saves Jesus is my homie. Yeah, I know. Whatever. Whatever the fuck else you say so that when you, uh,

Speaker 5:          00:10:45       okay,

Speaker 1:          00:10:46       you fuck up then you can just do like that stuff like those televangelists we just sit there crying. I have sinned against you and people seem to forgive you. So let's get to Alex Rodrigues up everybody buddy. Oh, by the way, if you'd like to know who's in first place in major league baseball, I actually looked it up. I had no idea. I mean, I knew the red sox were doing well. Um, the red sox, the Tigers and the Oakland age earned first place in the American league and then see if I can remember this. And National League, it's the A, is it the Braves? The Dodgers Dodgers are actually doing well. Making me eat kraut. Yeah. Cause I laughed at them last year when they were like, we were like, hey, we have $100 million worth the fucking players who want doing shit for us. And the Dodgers are like, well shit, we'll tag them. You don't like they're playing a different game over there. I don't know why you would do that but thank you for doing it. And you know what, thanks to you, it works for all of us. The Red Sox and Dodgers a buzzed in first place. And my squad, if I had been paid attention, the Pittsburgh pirates. Yeah, but you

Speaker 4:          00:11:53       know how he found out the pirates were in first place that was sitting in a bar. Yeah. Eating fried corn flakes, whatever the fuck they have down here. And um, they had on a game and oh well the pirates on pirates and cardinals, I really loved the National League for way back in the day. I used to like it because so many of the teams played on astro turf. And when I was a little kid, I thought that that was way cooler than playing on grass. Like now grass is way cooler than astroturf. ASTROTURF looks cheesy. But in the late seventies, early eighties, astroturf was the shit. You know, the whole infant field was astroturf except around the bags. And uh, it just seemed like a faster game. They were playing, hit and run. Guy Gets on first, you bought them over to second stealing bases and over in the American league it was all about, you know, people just standing there trying to smash the ball over the fence at back then home run hitters would, would hit like fucking two 78 if you hit to 80, that was considered like a, you know, you were a solid guy.

Speaker 6:          00:12:56       MMM.

Speaker 4:          00:12:58       I don't know, maybe you are now, but like they just didn't put up the numbers the way they, they did during the roid error action, obviously I should say. So anyways, I'm sitting there and I'm in and I'm like, oh, pirates, pirates and cardinals. This is like the old days, you know, and uh, I'm looking in the crowd and it seems like everybody's wearing a pirate ship.

Speaker 4:          00:13:23       And I'm just like, and the place looks like it's sold out. And I'm like, wait a minute, the pirates are selling out a game and I'm like, this must be a cardinals home game. And I look at their jerseys. What was weird was there, they're away. Jersey said cardinals. So then that made me feel like it was a home game cause I thought unless I saw it the wrong way, right. I misremembered it as politicians say, but I was under the impression that uh, uh, way baseball teams, when you're home you have the navy, a team like the red sox and you go on the way it says Boston, you know, you ride home, it says the Indians, you go on the road, it says Cleveland. So I guess you know, people who don't know shit about baseball know what city you're from. I have no idea. Uh, but anyways, it turned out that it was a pirate told game and it looked like it was sold out. So, uh, oh, that makes me excited. But haven't they, they've been doing that the last couple of years. You don't, my fandom of the pirates is from fucking, you know, just watch a baseball in the late seventies. And that we are family team was like one of my favorites at, uh, I rooted against the Orioles because the Orioles kicked the red sox ass in [inaudible] 79 with their unbelievable pitching staff.

Speaker 6:          00:14:36       MMM.

Speaker 4:          00:14:37       I would always root for the national league teams I guess because it was actually, it was really exciting to see them play because they didn't have,

Speaker 6:          00:14:46       uh,

Speaker 4:          00:14:47       there was no MLB package is like if you lived in Boston, you got was the red sox

Speaker 1:          00:14:52       game and then they would have the, uh, the game of the week.

Speaker 6:          00:14:56       And uh,

Speaker 1:          00:14:58       if you miss that, then you watch Mel Allen's this weekend baseball, which was the shit you said. Come on Saturday. Yeah, the nudes and it was bent. Dun, Dun, Dun Bat,

Speaker 2:          00:15:09       Bat, Bat, bat.

Speaker 6:          00:15:13       If the gun, then he came,

Speaker 1:          00:15:18       you'd come on wherever the fuck he would say. That was the, that was supposed to be the exciting theme song that started the show. And then they ended the show was something a little, uh, not uptempo to just let you know it was a beautiful game and they would just show it in slow motion and the sun,

Speaker 6:          00:15:35       Duh, Duh, Duh Duh Duh Duh Duh Duh Duh Duh Duh Duh Duh Duh Duh Duh Duh Duh Duh. [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          00:15:45       de de, De, De, De, De, De, De, De, De, De, De, de, De, de. Fucking people just do what all this amazing shit and like slow motion. And it was amazing about that song is, that's probably a 40 person orchestra. All right? There was no auto tune. There was no drum machine. There was no fucking one guy on a giant keyboard that can make all those songs. It was like 40 people getting paid, um, all working together, pointing it. Yeah. Other afterwards and going out and having a couple of Schlitz. Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:16:13       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:16:16       So anyways, um, fuck am I talking about here? Yeah. So I started watching baseball again. I haven't started watching baseball. Who's kidding who? But, um, I was psyched to see that the pirates server now first place and I'm actually happy for the Dodgers. Believe it or not, I have a tough time with the Dodgers because I was a huge fan of them when I was a kid because of the 77 and 78 world series when they played the, uh, the New York Yankees because I hated the Yankees and we can never beat him back then. Um, so I would root for the, for the Dodgers. And I remember feeling bad for Tommy John Because, uh, he lost in [inaudible] 77 or 78 with the Dodgers and then an 81, he went to the Yankees, which was unforgivable to me. And then the Yankees played the Dodgers again in the world series and then the Dodgers finally won. The guy went, oh, for fucking three poor bastard. And he had an operation named after him.

Speaker 6:          00:17:17       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:17:19       Him had Lou Gehrig. No one was an operation. Yellen was a disease. They Bell, why don't you shut the fuck up? All right, I will let, let me read you a little bit of advertising here. And then we'll get back. When I come back. I'm going to tease you a little here, people you gotta to talk about that whole a rod situation.

Speaker 6:          00:17:34       Uh,

Speaker 1:          00:17:35       here we go. All right. Dollar Shave Club. Everybody been talking about this for the last couple of weeks and I got to tell you a lot time ago, I used to do a bit about this in my act about why do they act like those disposable razors or some sort of gold bullion? Why are they locked behind that? The, the, the, that plastic glass. Why do they act like it's, it's this amazing thing. It's a little hunk of crap that shouldn't cost more than a buck,

Speaker 4:          00:18:02       right? Say we go, I did that, right?

Speaker 1:          00:18:06       But like seven, eight years ago, see what I did was, I just did a joke about it. These geniuses actually did something about it.

I'm like a, a number one draft pick bust when it comes to that shit. I'm not quite a bus, but no, about five, six years in the original team I was on, uh, drop me down to number three on the depth chat and now I got traded and I'm pulling back up over and fucking in Minnesota. But the first two went down and now getting in. All right, is this, this? Now skip Bayless. He's yelling about me saying that he doesn't think that I can actually read these fucking things without screwing it up. While Steven A. Smith Goes, blasphemy. Blasphemy. Uh, alright. Hey Rod, everybody.

Speaker 1:          00:21:23       It's my thing about this son of a bitch. This guy gets a lifetime ban and that somehow voids his contract. The Yankees are somehow able to get out of that contract. I swear to fucking God. You might as well just have the commissioner of baseball minus, well, just be Steinbrenner's son.

Speaker 3:          00:21:48       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:21:49       How much shit can the Yankees fucking get away with? Do you remember? The red sox wanted to get a rug. We had the deal in place. It baseball came in and was like, no, we had the deal was done at baseball, came in and said, no, that's bad for baseball. It's bad for baseball to have yet another big time free agent. Go to the red sox because that's what we were becoming the Yankees. Right.

Speaker 3:          00:22:15       And then

Speaker 1:          00:22:16       a rod goes to the Yankees, some health that wasn't bad for baseball to have two of the three best shortstops in the league at the time on the same team. One of them never to play shortstop again, to have to learn a new position at third base. If you remember, this is pre steroids and all that. So some of these names don't hold the weight they did back in the day, but they're infield was [inaudible] Jeter and a rod. And then there was talks that maybe they were going to sign, no mar to play second place, second base. I remember Jambi be like, dude, he was like, dude, that would be awesome. I just remember thinking like, how would that be awesome? What, where's the fucking fun in that? So what, anyways, we try to get a Rod. It's bad for baseball. The Yankees do it and they already had like fucking every goddamn free agent in the league at every position other than they are for fucking five core guys from their own, uh, uh, a farm team. And somehow that was okay.

Speaker 3:          00:23:16       All right.

Speaker 1:          00:23:17       And that was just a, an ongoing story in baseball. It was the red sox just never just, we couldn't win. No matter what we did, it blew up in our face. And even when we made moves and got a big guy, it was considered bad for baseball. You go back to the 70s we had rollie fingers signed him bad for baseball, you know, Yank that out. Reggie Jackson, can you, can we can the fucking Yankee sign him apps a fucking Luke Lee. I don't know what, I don't know what, what, what our pens look. But for some reason

Speaker 4:          00:23:46       they were bad for baseball. So anyways, for once after 86 years of flailing, you know the deal, somehow it worked in our favor. So I have thoroughly enjoyed,

Speaker 5:          00:23:58       okay.

Speaker 4:          00:23:58       Watching a rod flame out and in and watching the Yankees trying to get out of that contract and just not being able to get this $200 million albatross off from around their neck. I thoroughly fucking enjoyed it. They try to humiliate them. They've tea, they benched him during crucial moments and like the playoffs and a rod doesn't give a fuck. He just sits there like a fucking robot going, well you know, whatever's good for with tape, I don't go to shit. You know, just, just keep paying me. I don't give a fuck. And I completely enjoyed it. Ed, they still have another five years

Speaker 1:          00:24:36       of this nightmare. Five years, like $114 million. They got to give this, this matinee idol look in bust. And I have completely enjoyed every second of it. And um,

Speaker 1:          00:24:54       in my world is like, I got another five years. So just sorta, you know, I like, I watch a ton of baseball anymore, which is kind of sad. Uh, I gotta get back into it. Everybody, but I can't, I can't get back into it at the, the, the upper levels. I just can't, I can't watch these fucking, you know, juggernaut teams. I, I gotta, I gotta I gotta be watching Kansas City, you know, the Padres, the pirates, even though the pirates in the first place, but I don't think they have any major leaks. Science. I'm in major free agent signing. But anyways, so I thought I had another five years of this show to watch and now all of a sudden I'm worried that it's going to get canceled. I'll tell you right now, if, because of this suspension, the Yankees are somehow able to get out of this contract and saved themselves $114 million, which you sit down, but it's just a drop in the bucket.

Speaker 1:          00:25:45       The way they ass rape their fans. Every home game, they way they take every one of those poor Yankee fans with their pin stripe shirts and they're classic Yankee hats and they just bend them over the hot dog stand and just stick that pin stripe Dick Right up their ass. No loop. You know, I really feel bad for the total fucking ass raping that every, every Yankee fan takes when you go to the ballpark. I mean, if I was a Yankee Fan, I would not go to that new fucking, uh, beautiful baseball stadium slash growing up gaudy house. It's such a weird stadium. If you haven't been to it, you should definitely go. Uh, but I, I suggest eating a Thanksgiving dinner before you go there or you know, one of your kids will not be going to college. Um, but you go to that stadium is such a weird stadium where like, there's literally some breathtaking

Speaker 4:          00:26:44       views as you walk around that park and every time you like, oh my God, this is amazing. They really did it right. Then they'll just have, you know, some jackass like just some, some fucking look how much money we got. Just you don't know it is it, it's Kinda like this blend of, um,

Speaker 4:          00:27:07       I dunno. Like what, what's a great ballpark that they built that that's new, but it's all, I guess maybe the Jake when it first came out, it's kind of the perfect, it's a blend of, of uh, the beautiful new ones. They conjure up the old shit and like Dallas Cowboys stadium where if you never been to that, you got to go to that one just once. Just to see that absolutely fucking that I saw of a television that they have hanging up there. It's the dumbest thing I've ever seen in my life. I swear to God when I go to that stadium, I always think if Bobby Kelly designed a football stadium, this is exactly what it looked like.

Speaker 7:          00:27:47       Yeah. Look, I think the TV is, I don't have to go anyway, dude. I just sit here and watch it.

Speaker 3:          00:27:54       MMM.

Speaker 4:          00:27:57       Dallas Cowboy stadium is an absolute fucking abomination. And uh, and it's just because of that TV. Everything else is actually, it's beautiful. If you could just get that fucking TV, that TV, it's like a drunk at a holiday. Family gatherings, you know what I mean? No matter how good the food is, not how great it is to see everybody, all conversation, everything is drowned out by the fucking, the, that guy over there, you know, your uncle who keeps dabbling in the oxy, he's telling you that he's clean, but he is it, you know, that's what that fucking TV's like. So anyways, the hell am I saying here

Speaker 1:          00:28:39       as a fan of sports and my hatred of the New York Yankees, I'm really hoping that the Yankees feel like, oh, maybe we can get out of it. Maybe we can get out of it. And then they still can't. Knowing full well that in the long run it's not going to mean shit to them. $100 million doesn't mean shit to them. It's just annoying and that's basically all I can really hope for at this point. So, um, maybe I'll write some letters, I'll write some letters to the commissioner of baseball, tell them that I'm dying or something and that my bucket like bucket list or something. So something has to do with a rod. I just really want that, that I just want to be able to talk to him sometime while he's on the field. That's, that's my make a wish thing. I want to look into those Zombie robotic guys. Uh,

Speaker 4:          00:29:32       I like how he's actually pissed now says that he's being singled out. It's like, well you kind of made yourself a target with the steroids for the second time. You fucking jerk off. He really

Speaker 1:          00:29:42       is like a,

Speaker 1:          00:29:46       he has an inability to, to step outside of self and see how he's coming off and absolute jackass. And I can't think of a better person to beat, to be wearing the pin stripes and represent what that organization is all about. They're clean shaven, steroid abusers, unlike the Red Sox who, uh, I don't know what we look like. We, we look like we'll go into an Allman brothers concert. Uh, I'm just trying to get Yankee fans all day. Use Boyd too. All right, let's, let's plow ahead here. Have you buddy? Um, they held it out. You've got to talk about something. Yeah, I was, I going to bring up the, Oh, let's move on to this. Let's just keep the, uh, the sport thing going here. Oh, no, no, no. I remember what it is I owe. I owe an apology. This wasn't my fault, but I have to apologize on behalf of the theater that El Paso show got a rescheduled, as I mentioned, because of the active work I got down here in New Orleans, I was only able to do the first two dates of the red state tour.

So tickets are not on sale for that one yet. So there you go. Now, you know as much as I do about my schedule and once against sincerest apologies to anybody, any of the poor bastards that showed up for my shelf and El Paso. That was not to be, I don't know how that happened. Uh, so there you go. All right, back to the effect of the, uh, the podcast here. Everybody. So as mentioned, I'm down here in New Orleans. I've been making fun of the food, but, uh,

Speaker 1:          00:38:36       I've been having the best time in New Orleans as they say, if you can't have a good time down here, there's something wrong with you. And, uh, I went out the other night, I guess they shoot a lot of movies down here because it's really cheap. He gave him a great deal or whatever. And I had a buddy of mine who was shooting something else and he had just wrapped and he called me out. We went off, met up at this hotel and uh, just so you know what I, I'll actually, I usually don't name a name, but this will hype is movie. It was Craig Robinson who still, when they just wrapped on a hot tub time machine part too. And uh, Craig, just one, just one of those guys who's just, I dunno, unbelievably charismatic. Like I watched, I was watching that guy, that guy was having more goddamn fun in one night that I think I've ever had in my life. You know, just ease. There was a live band playing. He went up, he played piano, you know, singing and making everybody laugh. And then he fucking called me up to go do some standup. I of course was defensive, turned the crowd off and then I got offstage.

Speaker 1:          00:39:44       But later on that night when the band had left, uh, he went back up, started playing piano and I went up there and played some drums full of, I swear to go for like 45 minutes or like an hour and a,

Speaker 1:          00:40:01       it's probably the most fun I think I've had in a long, long time. And I was stone sober, didn't have a drop alcohol, you know, whenever I have an acting Gig, I tried to lay off the booze and Mike fucking giant head doesn't seem even bigger. No one wants to see that on the screen. So, um, I've been doing that, walking around, checking out the city, avoiding, what do you call it? At Bourbon Street, you know, I that just, I just don't like the date rapey sort of vibe on that street. So, uh, there is a laundromat that is on that, so it's kind of funny. I've been doing my laundry down that way. It just walking on that street like in broad day light after, you know, show your tits or whatever the fuck happened the night before. It's just a, if you ever walk by a strip club during the day, it's just really just, it's just not a good look.

Speaker 1:          00:40:54       It's just, I dunno what about it is at nighttime when you see those purple neon light bulbs and you're half in the bag or something, it actually looks like something appealing, but when you just see it in broad daylight, it's fucking brutal. So anyways, uh, I've actually been getting into like, you know, they've been talking about Lsu football down here in the saints, like every single day they're getting so fucking amped up for football. Um, I'm actually caught up in this excitement down here and uh, I saw that the saints have a preseason game Friday night and if you think I'm not going well, if I have

Speaker 4:          00:41:34       to work that night, obviously I'm not going, but if I don't have to, there's no fuck away. I'm not going because the super dome now that they redid it, it was already iconic. It's your OT is self to come down here and go to a game. It's, it's uh, it's beautiful. Which brings me to their basketball team. I don't know if you guys know this, but the New Orleans Hornets or no more than now called the, uh, New Orleans Pelicans.

Speaker 3:          00:42:00       Okay.

Speaker 4:          00:42:01       Just going to pause and let you take that in for a second. It's called, they're called the Pelicans,

Speaker 4:          00:42:08       which is arguably the worst fucking name of any God damn sports team. I, I'm going to motion, I'm going to make a suggestion here. Any new team at this point, do not name your team after an animal because evidently there's no good ones left. There's 122 fucking teams and I think just all the good, ferocious ones are taken unless you just want to go obscure and just start picking like names of like poisonous snakes and fucked up animals from different countries, which I dunno, why would you, why would you do that? You know, the New Orleans tie pants, you know, you wouldn't do that shift the Pelicans. So I looked up their logo and I'm like, if they made like a basketball net out of that bird's fucking double chin,

Speaker 3:          00:43:00       uh,

Speaker 4:          00:43:04       I dunno what I was going to do, but I looked it up. And you know what they did conveniently as they got rid of its double chin? Like it had like a facelift. So what I think they should do now, if they're going to go like that, if they're gonna sell horribly misrepresent that Bert not have it's giant fucking double Chin and somehow have this streamline chin, you know, uh, I, I think they should just, they should just put those fucking, you know, those lips, those plastic surgery lips that you GAF fuck. I am, I might even be remotely fucking funny on this Goddamn podcasts. Such a fucking handicap. I can't hear myself right now. I don't have my microphone. It's like my Kryptonite. Whatever. Make the fucking thing looked like a Kardashian. Kardashians, mom.

Speaker 4:          00:43:50       I'm actually, you know what? It's such a fucking, you know what I don't like about it? Date, they tried to make it look cool. It's like if you're going to be the Pelicans, just embrace it. And what you have to have is do, do the cartoony version of the Pelican right where it's got a cigar in his mouth and it's giving you the thumbs up with it's fucking wing. You know, he's got a fucking beer in one hand or something. That's the guards. It's just a Hawaiian shirt. If you're going to be the Pelicans, she got to do that. Stop trying to make that bird look cool. It's not cool. Is this iron been fucking rock and like death the entire time? It's not fucking cool. There's two logos that really fucked up the New Orleans Pelicans and then, uh,

Speaker 4:          00:44:37       the fucking Miami Dolphins who never should have changed. They shouldn't have changed their logo. It had been, it was always a kind of a Douchey logo, but had been around long enough and they'd done so many legendary things that you kind of like, you respected it. I mean, when I saw that logo, I thought about Don Shula. I thought about Larry's Onca, Jim kick, Bob Greasy, that whole era, Gary, oh, your premium or the fuck, his name is and I'm Gary at Premiere and that's why people used to go bald. You know, like fucking Lou grant was a dump of these chemicals on your head and having that whisper of grass on top of your head or I thought about Dan Marino.

Speaker 5:          00:45:23       Okay.

Speaker 4:          00:45:24       Mock duper Mark Clayton, all of that shit. That's what I thought about. And uh, for some fucking reason they decided to change it, which I think is a desperate move at this point. They're trying to make more money because now everybody has to go out and buy the new logo is never better. Look at the New England patriots. I think we have to like the ugliest fucking uniforms in the league, that awful silver with that, you know, whatever they call it. The Flying Elvis on the side. I hate it. I, I've never bought.

Speaker 5:          00:45:56       Okay.

Speaker 4:          00:45:57       Wow. I just realized that I've never bought anything with that logo on it. Never bought a jersey or anything. I've hated it from way back when drew Bledsoe first came and it was, it was more sky blue as opposed to the darker blue with that silver. I always just thought it was horrifically fucking ugly. Um, but the dolphins new logo, you know what the logo basically looks like. Do you know like when a corporation accidentally spills like nuclear waste into the water supply. So then they changed their name and they try to come up with like a, like a logo that makes it seem like they give a shit about the environment. Like BP did, you know BP went from this logo that looked like they drilled oil out of the fucking ground, like what they did and then sprayed it on baby birds and fucking sweatshop children.

Speaker 4:          00:46:47       Now they got that one. It's all green and yellow. Like you don't know if they plant corn or it just looks like grass and sunshine. That's what I feel like the new dolphins have done. Is that what you feel like bill, Bill, considering you're not that funny this week, why don't you just read some of the letters, said a continuing to just flail as you're riffing.

Speaker 1:          00:50:52       All right, Bill, this past weekend I went to Vegas to visit my brother and his buddy who currently reside there. They actually caught your most recent show in Vegas and had a phenomenal time. Oh, that's awesome. Thank you. Said I left last Thursday from Tampa and I soon I touched down in Vegas. I just received an out of nowhere texts from the girl that got away. I was shook this broad, used to live in Tampa about two and a half years ago, but she moved out to La to pursue her careers and actress. The two of us attended the University of Tampa a few years ago and had an on again off again relationship. Long story short, I was in a relationship with another girl. We went on break and I met this girl and was hooked. So anyways, her tech said, hey, where are you going to Vegas with? Because I'm going to be there this weekend to uh, my guess is that she had seen my social media.

Speaker 1:          00:51:39       She had been, my guess is that she had seen on my social media that I was going to be in Vegas. What I read the text. I was very surprised and pretty pumped because we hadn't talked in a long time and like I said, she was the one that got away. She's absolutely gorgeous and she also happens to be a really good person as well. Jesus Christ. People what could go wrong here? We hooked up in Vegas and it was amazing to see her. We all went out, did our thing and had one of the best weekends I've had in my life. I give you more details, but you know what happens in Vegas stays in Vegas. All right. You gave her the old Meat Hammer.

Speaker 4:          00:52:12       Wait, it be subtle. Anyways, the reason why I'm writing to you though is because on the plane, right back to Tampa, I was thinking about mine and this girl's relationship and all of our history and a pretty comical slash genius story came to mind about her. I know this is getting long, but I hope it's not as long and boring as that guide running to explain the fucking origins of Jimmy's a couple of weeks ago. Jesus Christ. Uh, but anyways, like I said, when I first met her, I was immediately attracted to her natural beauty, beauty, and her personality. She's one of these ladies who didn't have to wear makeup or do anything special to look sexy. However, one of the first weekends we spend vent

Speaker 1:          00:52:52       together, I wake up with her in bed. One morning I go to give her a kiss and I am, I am immediately troubled the way the morning sun was shining into the window on her face, expose something. I wasn't ready for that. Early in the morning, this broad has dark hair and for the first time I noticed she had some dark hair above her lip. I was really surprised. I didn't catch it before, but it wasn't a thick mustache or anything. It was just like the peach fuzz. A 12 year old boy has before he starts shaving. Regardless, I was taking, I was taken back and from that morning and from that point on that morning, it was all I could notice. Jesus, isn't it crazy how visual guys are?

Speaker 3:          00:53:39       That's it.

Speaker 4:          00:53:41       Take the most beautiful woman in the world. You put it, give a mustache. We can't. That's all we can say. It's like I'm kissing fucking Burt Reynolds here. All right, so when I went home, I had to devise a master plan, operation mustache removal. I liked this girl way too much and she was still very hot with the, even with the stash, but I needed a way to get rid of it because I wanted to help her out.

Speaker 1:          00:54:06       Also helping myself. All right. Now this is why I picked this one here. Listen to this guy. He's got a gorgeous fucking woman. Everything about her is perfect except she has a fucking mustache. Now. How the hell do you bring it up to somebody that you care about, that they have a mustache and his fucking turning you off. There's no way to do that without sabotaging the relationship or are really hurting the other person. The only way to do that is if you just completely don't give a shit about the other person. It just say, hey, you know, if there's any way you could, uh,

Speaker 3:          00:54:40       you know,

Speaker 1:          00:54:43       I don't even know how to fucking say, well, this is what he did and this was changes. He said, uh, since we just started seeing each other, I didn't want to come out and say, babe, Babe, you shaved today. Seemed a little self conscious. Edit is so I didn't want to tell her and embarrassed or anything like that. I needed a way to remove this stash without being involved. Hence, I did what needed to be done. Listen to this fucking brilliant conspiracy. I call it my trustworthy buddy who was playing hockey in Canada at the time and told him I needed him to do me a solid dude. I filled him in on the situation and he was willing to help me out since he had a weird random Canadian number at the time. I gave him my chick's number and told him to text her and simply say, you have a mustache. I ordered him to say nothing else and not to respond under any circumstances. He texted me back about 20 minutes later and said, mission complete, so this fucking lady, just to get you caught up in case you confused here with my reading,

Speaker 1:          00:55:49       she gets a random texts from a Canadian number out of nowhere that just says, you have a mustache.

Speaker 1:          00:55:58       I can't imagine your fucking stomach must've dropped. It's when he goes. Anyways, he goes. Later that night I met her at the bar and she was looking extraordinarily sexy. She seemed that she seemed to have a little pep in her step. I walked up to give her a kiss and I looked above her lip and the peach fuzz mustache was gone clean and soft as a baby's bottom. I was very happy how it played out. I helped myself up because that would have bothered me and I helped her become even sexier, best part being. She had no idea that I orchestrated that mission. I didn't have to talk about it, bring it to her attention and hurt her feelings or anything like that. I just had a broad with the cleanup or lip thought I'd share, go fuck yourself, dude. That is absolute genius. And now I just got paranoid cause I said, what's fucking school you went to and all that shit. I hope you don't get in trouble, but if you, somehow your woman is listening to this, a guy does something like that. Not because he's being a dick. It's because he cares for you.

Speaker 6:          00:56:56       And uh, we don't know how to,

Speaker 1:          00:57:01       we, we, we don't have those skills.

Speaker 3:          00:57:04       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:57:05       How do you tell somebody that there's no way to do it? I think what he did was genius. Nobody got fucking hurt. You felt great about yourself. He cared about you enough sweetheart in case you're listening. Then he came up with the plan that, you know, if he put it in another area, he could have like whacked JFK. So there you go. He came up with an enigma wrapped up in a rental, however that fuck that goes and uh, and you look even better. I would hope somebody would do that for me. All right, girlfriend and fantasy league. Hey Belle, love the podcast I'll put up. Thank you. I've been in a fantasy football league for 10 years. It was started by one of my best friends and has been the same 12 guys for a decade. I don't even know how bands have put, uh, I don't even know bands that have been together that long. So this year my buddy who started the league decided to boot out to lifelong members in favor of his girlfriend and the girlfriend of a friend of ours.

Speaker 6:          00:58:06       Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Wait.

Speaker 1:          00:58:10       Did those other two guys who got booted, did they do anything? I mean, if he was going to add the ladies, why did those other two guys have to leave?

Speaker 1:          00:58:22       Wow. All right. Okay, well I'm sucked into this story. He said, I immediately called bullshit and said point blank to his face is she wasn't sucking your Dick then she wouldn't be in the league. Uh, dude, that right there is a game changer. You can't say what if he marries this woman? Always. There's a, for you guys, always be careful what you say about the woman you're guy is with. Cause you never fucking know. You never know. And I'm sure there's some listeners that have stories and if you'd like to contribute them to the podcast where, uh, you know, it's even fucking worse is when your buddy, he says fucked up shit about the girl. You know about what a horse she is in bed and she's fucking brains out, but blah, blah, blah, blah, Blah and tells you all these, these details and then the jackass ends up falling forward and then he has to fucking break up with you because he's not going to break up with her because every time he looks at you, he thinks out. You know, he knows how this girl, my, my future wife Sucks my Dick. You know anyways, plowing ahead.

Speaker 5:          00:59:29       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:59:30       He's trying to defend this decision by saying she at least knows a little about sports, so this is awful. This guy wasn't raised right, man. This is just, this is fucking terrible. You said the fact of the matter is that she is from New York and knows who the jets are. That's the extent of her football knowledge. He thinks I'm overreacting, not overreacting. He didn't ask anybody else. You've had 12 for the last 10 years and he just removed two of the original band members

Speaker 1:          01:00:05       do. This isn't even funny. This is, this is really upsetting to me. He thinks I'm overreacting, but I think of it the same scenario. If you had, if you have one night a year to have a guy's night with your buddies and then you get to the bar, you see that your friend has invited his girlfriend to guys night. Exactly. Even told me that she, she's the one who asked if she could join, which obviously to me means he had no intentions of inviting her, but when he was backed into the corner, his ball shot up into his throat and he couldn't say no exactly. It's not just a fantasy league, but a clear indication that she's going to slowly start chipping away at everything else in the rest of his life. Exactly. In summation, is girlfriend

Speaker 4:          01:00:46       wanted in and he crumbled and said, yes. Am I reading too much into this? Am I overreacting? I'd like to know because he's getting pissed at me for being pissed at him. Absolutely not, sir. Everything that I was going to tell you, you already know and you wrote in this email. Okay? You ran down the mats, you went off the little fucking springy board. Do you hit the fucking hobby horse? You dead. Your little fucking Mary Lou lit and flip and you stuck the landing. You get a perfect 10 on that one, sir. You are 100% right. You know what you want. My move would be, I would start my own fantasy league. All right? And I would invite everybody else in that fucking league. Well, I wouldn't do that cause that's, that's a chick move. Make people decide,

Speaker 5:          01:01:32       okay,

Speaker 4:          01:01:32       oh, this is what I, I wouldn't be as harsh with him and just be like, no, do what you did was absolute bullshit. And I guarantee you, I would tell him that she's going to start chipping away at your life. You balls are up in your throat. Um, but that's going to end your friendship with them. But here's the deal, dude. There are other fantasy football leagues to join. All right? And that, that's one of those ugly things about that chapter of guys lives after college. You know, when you went to grade school together or you met them and call up guys and college or whatever, but you guys have this unbelievable bond, like you went to fucking war together. Um, if one of your

Speaker 1:          01:02:20       friends is a policy,

Speaker 1:          01:02:25       you know, he has a, he has a chance of meeting somebody who's going to splinter that group. You know, and this isn't an anti woman thing, this is more like an anti pussy guy kind of thing where raw, you know there are controlling, suffocating people on both sides. Men and women. And I know that this women listening and they've, one of their best girlfriend started dating some fucking overbearing, insecure Douche bag guy and the first thing they do is they cut them off from their friends and then it's the coworkers, then the friends and then their family, they stick them under a fucking little glass or something. So, uh, yeah, you know what dude? Get up divorced. The sad thing is is you're going to lose a couple of friends sometimes that happens and a, you just have to be content about it and

Speaker 1:          01:03:16       you know, and I think it's really important for men and women to have men only and women only social events that they can go to once a week or a couple times a month and just hang out with the fellows or hang out with the ladies. It just, whatever. I think it's really, really healthy. It's gives you something to look forward to. It gives you a place where you could just vent about your, anything you fucking want in, in a group of people, that 100% is going to understand and you don't have to worry about hurting anybody's feelings or offending on anybody. I think it's true. It's really, really fucking healthy. And this guy's fucking with that. And uh, and he didn't put it to a vote. What does he, the Grand Poobah this shit.

Speaker 5:          01:04:03       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:04:04       I Dunno. There's so many ways you can go with that. The spending, depending on how much you want to stir up the pot, you guys should put it to the vault. This would be great. Put it to a vote. Do we have this be like you're Arab spring, but with a fantasy football league and just felt that cunt out and then you become the dictator and you move into the palace. How about debt? Whatever. Dude, you're 100% right. I would just, I would choose my words a little more carefully. Um, don't say that he didn't have the balls. Just say, listen, this was something that we did together for 12 years and uh, I'm really disappointed and shocked that you made this big a move and remove two other members and didn't include anybody else in it. I don't think that it was done right and I think we should put this to a vote. That's what we should do. And if he gets mad and he starts yelling, don't lose your cool. Just keep stating your opinion calmly and you know, if he's going to be a bitch about it, let it be a bitch about it. And I would actually, for your own health,

Speaker 1:          01:05:10       does she all the things she knows is the jet. She's going to be like, wait a minute. Who is that? I have, I got, I got, I don't know anything I had, she still tried to do that.

Speaker 4:          01:05:18       You know that thing where women try to act like they're dumb because they think it's cute. You know what I would do, sir? I would just put your losses just fucking with,

Speaker 4:          01:05:30       I don't know. The more you think about it, the more noisy I'm getting in. Just ruined my fucking day and I'm not even in it. I didn't like fantasy football. All right. Bank or cuts. All right, Billy boy. Uh, so have you heard about these greedy cunts at Goldman Sachs? That was kind of a national story. What do they do? Something else? You said they cornered a large share of the market in aluminum and then bet it on the futures of a lumen with the price going up. Sounds illegal. It is. But of course those stupid fucking cuts found a loophole in the law. The loophole is that 25 tons of aluminum is supposed to leave the warehouse every day. However, the law does it specify where it had to go. So they would just send it to another warehouse of, there isn't technically, it didn't leave the warehouse and the New York Times article, they interviewed people who previously worked at these warehouses. They would jokingly send each other messages and say, Hey, get hey, get the shipment of aluminum. But really they were just transferring it to an adjacent warehouse. Uh, I, I, this is, I don't even get what the fuck's going on here. Of course Goldman Sachs has recently posted it's largest quarter profit of over 2 billion.

Speaker 4:          01:06:38       When can we take these bankers out into the street and just shoot them all? Joking aside, this shit is insider trading and they should be prosecuted, but we know that won't happen. A PS, no, you're busy for a while. But when are you coming back to Atlanta? Uh, I actually don't know. I don't know when I'm coming back to Atlanta. You know what? That's one of those things I should have read that 20 times in a row and learned what exactly is going on. I think this is basically how they get away with it is that there's too many people like myself that don't even understand what was going on there. All that stuff, betting on futures. I don't even understand what any of that means. I was just in the stock market long enough to realize like, hey, I don't know what the fuck's going. I'm, I'm S. I basically felt like I was standing at a crap table. Uh, I put my money on a crap table in it and I wasn't even in the casino. You know, I was in a different state and then I was calling somebody else up going, hey, how's the game going? You know, I saw a couple of stats at the bottom with the screen and I can't even read them.

Speaker 4:          01:07:46       I don't even know if the games even being played. That's what I can't get past about everybody listening to this podcast. You don't, you don't have any of the money that you earn every week. You don't have any of it.

Speaker 4:          01:08:05       You ever think about that? It's a number on a piece of paper. You take it to the bag and then they stick that number in your ATM that occasionally you go to the ATM and they give you a piece of paper that is only worth something because everybody says it's worth something, but you really have nothing of value. What you have is the piece of paper that's a part of the life so that that is the genius of all of this shit and into penalties and fees and taxes and all that crap. They get you even further removed or you have to invest it. You know? Why do I have to fucking invest? You can't, I don't know. You don't get anything. You don't get anything of fucking value. The only thing that has value is the lie. And as long as the lie continues, I mean, isn't this the month? Where are we going to raise the debt ceiling every fucking year? Eventually that wave's going to crash.

Speaker 3:          01:08:57       MMM.

Speaker 4:          01:09:01       I Dunno. I hope when the wave crashes that all races and all economic levels somehow put down their differences and they all come together and we just start walking towards gated communities.

Speaker 3:          01:09:14       All right. There you go.

Speaker 4:          01:09:18       How much are you stealing that you have to live behind a gated community there. They're sitting there acting like they're, they're afraid that we're going to steal their shit. It's like you got your shit by stealing from us. All right. And our k sorry. All right. What am I going here? The next one. Low Libido girlfriend.

Speaker 3:          01:09:41       Okay.

Speaker 4:          01:09:42       Uh, all right. Hey Bill. I've been with my current girlfriend for two years and we've had our ups and downs, ups and downs relationship wise, but even at the lowest points we still get back together. Okay. Is there a reason you get back together? Is it because you actually love this girl or he just lonely and don't want to go through the pain of a breakup? A, the problem is at this point and the relationship, it seems like I'm the only one interested in sex. Maybe it's just a man thing or how long we've been dating, but she's in her 20s and I'm 31 and we have the sex life of a middle aged, married couple once a month or once every three weeks at best. She generally responds to my advances with this interest or at worst annoyance. Do you think there is any ways to change this or we just not sexually compatible? Go Fuck Yourself? Well, my gut tells me the relationship is over and it's been over. Um, oh, you said ups and downs. You didn't say that you broke up. I ran into that. Um,

Speaker 3:          01:10:44       okay.

Speaker 4:          01:10:45       Yeah. You need to sit down and talk to her and just say, listen, I just want to talk about her sex life. I feel like it's almost nonexistent and when I try to get something going with you, I feel like you're a, like I just completely turn you off. You know? Did I do something?

Speaker 1:          01:11:12       And if in general you just not into me anymore, just let me know cause I'm 31 at, uh, I should probably try and find someone who finds me remotely attractive when you think so. It was kind of what I'm looking for in life. Somebody who actually gives a flying fuck then of shaking my dick in their face.

Speaker 5:          01:11:30       Huh?

Speaker 1:          01:11:31       See like right there. I look at you just look down. Just a mere mention of me shaking my cock and your feet. No, sorry. Yeah, that's what I would do.

Speaker 5:          01:11:40       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:11:41       You think there's any change of this? Are we just not sexually compatible? Yeah, this is all like all relationship shit. His communication. He kept a sit down for what you want to communicate. Relationship. What I've learned, the best thing to do is sit down with yourself first. All right. Driving in the car, get all the yelling out. Scream at the windshield.

Speaker 8:          01:12:01       Yeah. Well what the fuck? I'm sitting there, I went over to your broad, he talked to you.

Speaker 1:          01:12:07       Yeah. You don't just scream and get it all up and then when you get all of that out, then you just do some self analysis and he, you try to break down the anger. It'd be like, what am I really upset about?

Speaker 5:          01:12:18       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:12:18       You know, what do I feel right now? I feel like I'm not being heard. I feel this. I feel that. And then she, then he had to have this game plan. Okay. Even if you've got to make like a setlist, like a fucking comedian and you just write down what you feeling and the points that you want to get out.

Speaker 1:          01:12:37       Draw a smiley face at the end of it to remind yourself to not get angry because you're going to start the conversation. This works for both men and women. You're going to start the conversation. So the other person is caught off guard, so they didn't get a chance to scream at the windshield. So they might start screaming at you. So your point, your main thing is not to join in and have the whole thing escalate. You just want to be heard. All right? So if you in an adult way, just tell them what you're feeling without insulting them. It's always good for the relationship. Even if the relationship fucking comes to an end,

Speaker 5:          01:13:16       uh,

Speaker 1:          01:13:17       you're just pressing fast forward through a bunch of pain. So there you go. So I would just sit down with them and just say, yeah, I just feel like I repulse you to the point that I'm

Speaker 5:          01:13:27       okay.

Speaker 1:          01:13:28       You know, I feel hesitant to even even trying to make a move on you. What's the deal? You know? See how that works out. All right. Road, head accident. Hey Bill, I took my lady out to a nice steakhouse for our anniversary. We had an awesome night. The food was expensive, but fucking great. We pigged out and after it was all over, we left. We then went and seen a movie. I don't know if that's a Typo, sir, but I fucking, I know guys like you. We went out, we had all this meal and we went out. We seen a movie

Speaker 4:          01:14:12       and at two hours to let our stomachs settle. I'm surprised you didn't fall asleep. I would have felt if I had a giant steak dinner, I woulda got the itis. Anyways. Then after we left the theater, we locked eyes in the car and we immediately wanted to fuck Jesus. Dude, you're killing it. Steak, dinner, movies. Now you're going to, you know, you've got a woman who wants to jump on your deck. God bless you, America. Uh, so I threw the neon into tribe in Florida towards home. However, she had the amazing idea to give me some road head before we got home. Being in Dota. I had my dick out before she even got situated. Of course, after a while of her doing this, she started to gag being a dude. I was thinking, oh yeah, she can't even handle this dick. Jesus Christ. This guy's spare no detail. Sorry ladies. Uh, despite the fact that she had never gagged before, oh, sorry, I missed the, the self deprecating tag there. He said, I was thinking she can't handle this dick, despite the fact she had never gagged before. Before I knew it. Oh No.

Speaker 3:          01:15:15       Okay.

Speaker 4:          01:15:15       All right. If you're squeamish, people just shut it off now. He goes, I felt a wet sensation on my balls. As I looked down, I noticed that she had thrown up all over my dick balls and general crotch area. Sorry.

Speaker 3:          01:15:37       Wow.

Speaker 4:          01:15:38       Here's the bullshit. She was mad at me. What the fuck? She was so upset and embarrassed. That's what it is right there, sir. About about it that she hasn't come over in two weeks. Why is she pissed? She isn't the one that had the cleanest stake dad. Right. All right. Tell me what to do.

Speaker 3:          01:16:02       MMM.

Speaker 4:          01:16:04       I gotta tell you this. She's being really immature. She's embarrassed. She's embarrassed, and she's not being mature about this. Where, I mean, it was a mutual thing. It's not like you grabbed her by the back of the head, just slammed her head down there. You know, she was all about it. In fact, if I, if I remember before, I can get that nightmare visual out of my head. It was her idea. Right? We wanted to fuck whoever. She had the amazing idea to get me some head, oh, she's a trooper. You know, this is what I would do. Send her a card in the mail.

Speaker 3:          01:16:50       All right.

Speaker 4:          01:16:53       And just, just tell it that, you know, you miss her. I, you don't viewer any differently or anything and just, just, just write something nice and yeah, I'd really like to, uh, take you out for an ice cream. Maybe if you do throw it up all of my Dick and balls later. I think it'd be kind of a soothing, you know, this is summertime months and that criteria can get a little hot. So I wouldn't mind a little mint chocolate chip around the pubes there. Right. We leave out the last part,

Speaker 3:          01:17:23       but

Speaker 4:          01:17:26       I have just sent her a nice car. I wouldn't even bring up the incident. Just send her a nice car. Something cute. Nothing silly, nothing fucking overly loving. Just something in the middle. You know what sir? I think we actually found a new niche for hallmark. They got to have one where there was something sexually weird happened and the other person is embarrassed at the other person. Doesn't judge him and wants him back. You could have those cards. Let's see if I can come up with one here that actually bribes.

Speaker 3:          01:18:03       Uh,
