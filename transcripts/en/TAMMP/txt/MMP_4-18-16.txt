Speaker 1:          00:00:01       Hey, what's going on is bill burn is time for the Monday morning podcast for Monday, April 18th, 2016 what's going on, dude? Hawaii. Um, I don't know. I don't even know why. I don't even know where to start on this fucker one. Um, how do you begin? This one is still be sensitive, sensitive. There's so many sensitive stories out there. Everyone there is when there's feelings, they're uninformed or you tried to approach this, um, this fucking lay down at the zoo in Palm Beach, Florida. Rest his soul got attacked and killed, got mauled a by a fucking tiger, sometimes referred to as the tiger whisper, Yadda, Yadda, Yadda, Yadda, Yadda, Yadda, Yadda, and all that fucking shit. These, I don't know what it is about people who fall in love with wild animals. There's nothing you can do to cure it. It's fucking, it doesn't give a fuck about you. It's not a dog, you know, fallen in love with a wild animal. It's like falling in love with a stripper.

Speaker 1:          00:01:23       Yeah. It's just not gonna end. Well, it's not gonna end well, fucking unbelievable. Then there's another story. This fucking scout leader, it takes a bunch of boy scouts, takes a bunch of children into the fucking woods. He goes into a cave and there's a fucking bear in there, fill the whole story's always an amazing that the boy scouts kept their fucking cool. That guy knew. The scout leader knew that he pulled his shirt up over his face and then curled up into the fetal position, which I guess is the international bear signal like, hey man, I don't want any part of this man. And then the bear loss interest in walked away. But at no point during all of this does anybody say, hey, the fuck are you bringing a bunch of kids around with his bears just walking around. It's bad enough if you take your kids to the fucking zoo, the amount of times these God damn things get loose.

Speaker 1:          00:02:21       Or at the very least, some fatty is going to walk up to some polar bear cage. Go over the fucking thing and stand there, you know, and then get fucking snatched by this thing. And what is she saying? What for you to fucking blow your brains out. You Dope. Right. So I'm not saying the lady who died in Florida was a dope. I'm just saying that, um, I don't know. You Insert yourself into this situation and there's no good way to insert yourself into a mauling to death by tiger cause you knew what that means. There was also, they always just say malt. You know, like it came up like, like some prisons shit and just stuck you with the shank. It didn't, it fucking crushed your neck and then it started feeding on your energy. That's fucking brutal.

Speaker 2:          00:03:08       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:03:10       Hang on a second. Nia. Yeah. Okay. What are you doing? You coming in? No. All right. Did you lock me in?

Speaker 2:          00:03:21       No.

Speaker 1:          00:03:25       Okay. Sorry. She just goes, she freaking me out. They're like, well I got these new locks on the door. I thought she was locking the door. It's still early here and I just woke her up so she's going to be a little grumpy. Nia, you want to come in on the podcast? Let me know. Oh, that's silence spoke volumes. You know, I'll tell you right now, getting married is kind of like a falling in love with a wild animal.

Speaker 2:          00:03:50       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:03:51       You know as much as you love them, don't get too close to the fucking end. Close. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:03:57       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:03:57       Um, yeah. Let me get back to it. Why the fuck would you take a bunch of kids out like no. At no point does anybody addressed at this guy took a bunch of fucking children out to where there's bears and then they watched him get fucking mauled for half a second before he took his Izod Aggie and yanked it over his head. That's what you're supposed to do. How have I been on the earth this long and not known that that's what you do when you run into the bear? Is it because I'm not in scouting or is it because most people are smart enough to not be around bears? To not reenact the fucking scene from the Leonardo Dicaprio movie? What was it called, the ray content? I don't even, what the fuck it is. The revelent, the irrelevant, whatever the fuck it was called.

Speaker 1:          00:04:38       I hate when they take some big word that already exist and just makes you feel like it's like, did they make that word up? And it's like, no, that word is existed. The revenant, right. That word is existed your entire life. Just you and everybody you know is too dumb to walk around and use it on a daily basis and yeah, that's, it's a sad feeling. Just sad fucking feeling. Um, I forget what I was looking. Oh yeah. What to do if a bear attack shoe, I can tell you right now, this is going to be 99.9% white people looking the shit up.

Speaker 2:          00:05:14       Yes.

Speaker 1:          00:05:14       Where the dubs that go out there, I hate to do def jam material, but it's fucking true.

Speaker 2:          00:05:20       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:05:21       Jesus fucking Christ 2016 and he get mauled by a grizzly bear. There's no excuse for that. And you know how, you know, hallmark, does it make a card? Fourth Day you go, you can go through all of that whole sympathy section. Sorry for your loss. Sorry. You got this disease. Sorry, I was a Douche yesterday. There's no, wow. Fucking sorry. You got mauled by a bear. They don't because it happens so, so little. So few times. There's no reason for it. They should really make one of those and make it even better. It should like rhyme. I hate to look, I hate to stay on your face. Got Mauled by a bear. I'm really fucking sorry. Uh, I know something about a trolley. Go Fuck Yourself. I hope you feel better. Tension all zookeepers out there. Uh, those are not your friends. Uh, and they don't want to be there. And I think a lot of them realize the situation. They're not just sitting there fucking waiting for you to give him another fucking pile of Cube steaks. They're sitting there, even if they were born in captivity, I guaran fucking tee you that they are sitting there with this strange feeling that there has to be more than this.

Speaker 1:          00:06:38       Look at me to look. I mean, if you're a fucking tiger, even you're a tiger born into captivity, right? You're rolling around with somebody dressed in a safari outfit. Okay. And you bond with that person like it's your fucking mother. Right. It's some fucking point.

Speaker 2:          00:06:52       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:06:53       It's some point, you know, just your ego alone with all those people showing up just to look at you taking your picture. This no weed, no. There's no way to keep you four feet on the ground, you know, and not be like, dude, uh, why am I in a cage right now when everybody's coming up? You know, all I do is lay around every day and these people can't get enough looking at me. I mean, man, I, I'm the fucking Shit, you know? And you just start, you ego just goes fucking crate lane. Then you start looking like, you know, I don't know, you'd start testing. They come in a little bit, you give him a little growl, you see it in their face and they get some broom handle and get back and back, right? You just Sorta, you know, first time with your park test the strength of that.

Speaker 2:          00:07:37       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:07:38       Fucking little broom handle. Like, dude, I could snap that thing. This guy's fucking shoulders, guys, a pussy, what? They're doing, tiger pushup. And then one day you just like, you know what? As much as I'm enjoying this fucking raw meat. I have it every day and I need to switch up the Diet, you know? Oh, but I mall you and a usually a belt is some dental floss.

Speaker 1:          00:08:04       I know, I know what you're thinking right now. You probably think it build. This is really fucking insensitive. Well you know what, this is how I deal with sad shit. I joke around about it cause I don't feel like they get about everybody that loved that woman that now can never see her again. So I mean what am I supposed to do? And then also I like to feel that I'm being responsible by giving you some tips on how not to a, yeah. You know, you don't get good mauled to death by a bear. I just don't understand that. Like what's so fucking funny about these goddamn scouts, it's like why didn't he just go in the woods? You don't have to go into the Goddamn wilderness. No, fuck brings a bunch of kids out there. I'll tell you, it brings a bunch of kids out there, kind of guy that goes on, just walks into a fucking cave, gets mauled by a fucking bitch. Who the fuck walks into a cave in the middle of the forest? What kind of it? I mean, I'm not in scouting. I never was. I can't start a fire without a match. But I can tell you right now, my general instincts say is that says that you know,

Speaker 2:          00:09:03       okay,

Speaker 1:          00:09:04       there's no apartment buildings out in the fucking forest. Okay, so a cave is like, that's like a townhouse in Brooklyn. You know? Definitely people have to fucking digging holes in the Goddamn ground, curling up to hibernate and that. Here's a fucking cave. All right, so you think everybody who lives out there, that's like fucking, that's like Beverly hills level property. So who's going to get it? The strongest sick is craziest motherfucker out there and that's a bear. You know, you're not going to walk in there and there's going to be a little fox in there like it isn't. It's going to be some fucking, it's going to be the king of the forest. Which is a bear as far as I know. Although I did see a mountain lion give it a couple of fucking, you know, Pernell Whitaker is, you know, memo fast. That guy was, they would just fucking right on top of his head and the bear just sat there and taking, you know, he had like the head movement of light of late Mike Tyson rather than early and he just took a few and then he just sorta started running away was a sad day, you know?

Speaker 1:          00:10:06       Um, anyways, just imagine if you ran into a badger or a fucking wolverine. Those lunatics.

Speaker 2:          00:10:15       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:10:15       Badges and Wolverine still like the Irish and the Scottish of the fuck at forest. You know what I mean?

Speaker 2:          00:10:22       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:10:22       Those things don't even quit. Even, even if they're losing it, they just got that. I don't give a fuck, you know, blood all over the face. They're not stopping. They're going to keep coming. Just like the Irish and the Scottish fucking loaded ticks. You don't want any part, any part of that? Well, you know, I don't know oil. You know what? I never even look to say Kate impairing counters and back country. If you encounter a bear on the trail or in your campsite. Yeah. Cause you're cooking food basically the dinner bell of anything. But then fucking,

Speaker 2:          00:10:55       yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:10:56       Oh my God. Look at this size of this fucking bear. Oh, there's a lady fucking walk in and there's a bear in the background. Guess what color she is. All right. Be Safe and bear habitat. Oh God. This is the first sentence. The level, I mean, as dumb as I, uh, the level of dopes that have to become to this website. Listen to this. Just the first sentence. It's normal. It's normal to, I said normal. It's normal to be frightened when you encounter a bear. That's how this, this is, this is the jump off point. The reality is that most encounters with bears rarely, rarely lead to aggressive behavior. And attacks are even rarer. Yeah. They go sucking into the forest. I mean it happens, but generally is, here's a great lie. They're actually more afraid of you then you are of them. Yeah. And what do they do when they get, when they're afraid.

Speaker 2:          00:11:53       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:11:54       They either take off running or they fucking mall you to death. I think though, a, you know, here's a bonus. The threat is gone and now I have a midday snack. A remember it? Most bears preferred to avoid contact with humans. That's hilarious. They're like the champion that doesn't want to fight. You know, just trying to hold on to the belt back pedal in the entire time until your corner. The fucking thing in any bear you do see is probably just as frightened as you are there. It is every fucking,

Speaker 2:          00:12:24       yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:12:24       You know what it is that bears don't have access to a mirror.

Speaker 1:          00:12:32       They're living in their heads. You know, they're out there by themselves, you know, talking to themselves account man. You know, I'd love to find a cave or some shit, man. Right? And all of a sudden, so they finally find it. Nobody else is in here. You can fucking chill out, put an l shaped couch over here, get a flat screen. And all of a sudden this fucking guy comes walking in and his God damn shorts. You know what he's thinking? He's thinking to catch a predator. He's probably seen that show too. He comes as fucking pedophile. The bear thinks he's going to get fucked in the ass. And next thing you know he's on top of this guy or I and a fucking dude stodge Yank and his shirt over his head. And then the bears like, what the fuck? Sky's a bottom. You know, I thought this guy was trying to rape me.

Speaker 1:          00:13:12       Now all of a sudden he's acting like we'll make it love here. And he's been all submissive. This is fucking weird in me out. What if he tells his friends the bears all homophobic and then he kills him and why? You know what? And there's a bunch of little kids watching it. All right? And that's what camping is. And I think, you know what? I have to haven't worked that out right there. I think scouring should be illegal. You know what I mean? We want to get there. Well first of all, you know, dressed in those little boys up like little French maid's, you know, the will scarfs running around. I mean it's just a, yeah. Wonder why he got all the sexual predators, sex predators, sexual predators. I don't. A sexual chocolate, um, anyways, remained as composed as possible and follow these simple guidelines. Whenever you're in bear country, soon you will, you two will have more composure when citing a bear because you know what to do a scream bloody murder and running the other direction. And actually it's the exact opposite of what you want to do. You want to remain calm and take a step towards the beer that shows a level of confidence.

Speaker 2:          00:14:12       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:14:12       Fucking dope. All right. First one, avoid. Avoid, avoid. Yeah. Light by staying in civilization, the best way to prevent an unpleasant and unpleasant bear encounter is to avoid them all together. Bears usually avoid people and most people don't even know when they, they've come close to a bear. Exactly. To ensure a surprise or an to ensure a surprise or unpleasant encounter with the bear doesn't occur. Avoid moving through bear habitats silently and alone traveling groups. The larger the better. And make lots of noise by talking or singing and put the iPod and pay attention to your surroundings. Ah, Jesus Christ. I don't know about that.

Speaker 1:          00:14:59       What if the bears having a slow fucking couple of days and is hungry and you start seeing, oh, I'm saying I get it. The ranger school Beto Beto Zip, Betty Doe, Dad, Zip, Ada, you know, in the bear starts sticking you like, you know what? I think it's worth the risk. Even though I'm scared. I think I could take that fucking hundred 40 pounds. Dope. All right. When it happens, she how they wrote down. Instead it, when you're getting mauled by the bear and you feel its breadth in his fucking incisors ripping at your neck when it happens. That's another way of saying that, uh, remain calm and ready. Your bear spray or other deterrent, what is it? Your underarm hair, uh, stay together. If you're in a group, you will appear larger and more intimidating. If you stick together, try to figure out whether the bear is a grizzly or a black bear. Hey, that thing running that is 40 miles an hour. If you had a dog that's over fucking over trying to figure out whether the bears, uh, grizzly or a black bear. As you will see below grizzly bears and black bears tend to behave differently in a given situation. So it helps to know which species you're dealing with as it's running. After you give me a fucking break, I just click here to see the difference.

Speaker 2:          00:16:14       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:16:15       Bears at a distance, dude. It's a fucking bear.

Speaker 2:          00:16:19       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:16:19       Look at these fucking things.

Speaker 2:          00:16:23       Okay

Speaker 1:          00:16:24       Dude. The fact that one of these things could pick up Lawrence Taylor at the height of his fucking career and throw him through the uprights. You

Speaker 2:          00:16:33       okay?

Speaker 1:          00:16:33       Get bear smart societies. These fucking people like I don't get it. I mean there has to be, why can't you just go out in your backyard? Just set up a tent. I mean you, you are still outside. As long as you don't go inside, you are camping.

Speaker 2:          00:16:47       Okay?

Speaker 1:          00:16:47       It's not the same thing, man. I got to get out there with his bears. I know what to do. Right? If it's a black bear, black bear, they usually lead with the left. You know what I mean? The traditional put a grizzlies, a south park, so it's going to be a little bit weird. They definitely have a reach advantage considering when they stand up. They're about eight feet tall. So what you want to do is you want to stay outside his wheelhouse. Okay. And you want, you want to circle away from his power pantry. You want to circle to your left, staying away. The grizzlies want to load up that left that go for the big shot. They try to steal around. I don't know. Sorry. My am I beating this to death here? I'm just, there's no fucking reason. There's no reason to get killed by a tiger in the United States of America. They don't live here. They're only one place there at the fucking zoo at uh, you know they're in cages self.

Speaker 1:          00:17:47       At some point you went into the fucking thing. You did. You just see, I don't know. Oh my God. What is the fucking thought when you get yanked in the second Uga? Oh No, it's got to be it. Oh No. Make it quick. I mean, just shit that would go through your head. I'm sorry. This is getting fucking morbid. Um, so anyways, my condolences to the, uh, friends of families or the lady down there in Florida and my condolences to the, uh, the guy with the members only jacket that he yanked up over his fucking head. Uh, you know, good on you, sir. I hope you, I wish you more luck as you bring children into the fucking woods.

Speaker 1:          00:18:27       Fucking idiot. What is it about putting on a fucking uniform that all of a sudden you think you know something? I just don't get it. Oh, I am. You know, I have all my badges on my shirt. I had been trained for, he's a jolly good, fair. That's where they should be singly. This the thing that, you know, we're never going to see you again. Music right before you go into the woods, just to fucking reminds you of what you're walking into. Um, anyways, so, hey, um, the official, finally the official Lau, um, I'm allowed to finally say it. F is for family has been picked up for a second season. Um, I actually got the news back in January, but for whatever reason, the way Netflix promote stuff, which I would never question considering they're dominating the universe. They wanted to wait until last Friday.

Speaker 1:          00:19:23       So it is now official. Uh, we are working right now. That's the stuff I've been alluding to that, uh, I've been working on. And um, uh, what was I gonna say? Uh, actually this weekend I was writing an episode so I missed all the fucking hockey I saw. The series that I'm watching is Saint Louis first, the Black Hawks. And when I saw game too, I threw in the fucking towel. I was like, that's it. He gave a game to the Black Hawk. She cannot give a game to the hawks. You know, you had your foot on their fucking neck. He had the gall, the goal was fucking called back or whatever. I can't remember what happened to gold got called back, right. Or terrorists, ankles goal got called back and then it's just like, that coach should have gone down the bench. No, let down. No let down. Right. What do they do?

Speaker 1:          00:20:14       They go out there that pissed terrorist Sanko takes a stupid fucking penalty. The Blackhawks score the goal and they steal the fucking game and I was just like, and I was texting my buddy. I was like, that right there is why the Blackhawks win every fucking year in St Louis loses every fucking year. Whatever. The Blackhawks have that ability to remain calm when they're down Saint Louis for my whole fucking life has never had that right. The right after I said all of that shit. What are they doing? Game three I didn't see the game. I just looked at the highlights. You know they fucking took three quick penalties in the first period. Chicago scored on the first, on the first one. If I was watching that game, I'd be like, here we go, here we go. Chicago is going to win like the next for the next four to five and they didn't give him digging.

Speaker 1:          00:20:58       Even Saint Louis Seal right there. Fred St Louis came back, tied it up one one. Chicago scores a goal in the second period, two to one. They're going into the third period in Chicago. This is always said, you know, it's over for the blues. It's always been that way since I don't know how long it's been going on forever now. Like the Blackhawks will give my whole life to mean shit. They went through a nice drug to, but like the new black hawks, like this series is over and fucking Saint Louis came back, tied it up to two and then went ahead three, two with like six minutes left and a so a big congratulations to a the St Louis Blues, that huge fucking victory. And I can't wait to see the next game cause I know the Blackhawks and act in it and I just got to go out like that.

Speaker 1:          00:21:44       Right. You know, they're going to tie it up. They're going to go into St Louis. This might go a, I don't know, may go seven. I'm hoping for seven. You know, I don't give a shit, but I'm, I'm pulling for Saint Louis. I think they're my team over Dallas. Just because, you know, Dallas was the north stars, right? They've only been Dallas stars for like, what, like 20 years. Eh. You know, I mean those people down there, but they have a bunch of cowboys who's kid too, you know, they getting plastic surgery yet. How they got their oil welding whites wearing too much makeup. I mean the different Dallas, the big D, it's a football town to football state. I love the fucking stars. I love the people on the stars. But like I also like their fucking college. They got Celtic colors. I like to, I still like to stars, but you know, I think, I don't think it's time for the blues. They've been around since 67. They never won shit. So that's the team I'm pulling for GPL. How you not for the Boston Bruins because we didn't make the playlists.

Speaker 1:          00:22:40       Um, but who would've thought a Blackhawks sit down two games to one to the blues and the Kings are down o two to the San Jose sharks. Um, and actually a buddy of mine who writes onF is for family before this all started. He goes, I don't give a fuck. He goes, the Stanley Cup goes through Chicago or la. And that's what everybody was saying. Now, granted we're only a couple of games in here and granted the kings are playing the sharks and, and you know, the sharks are like the San Diego chargers if they were skates, you know, every year coming out having this wonderful fucking regular season and then they go in the playoffs and they just shit the bed. So we'll seek, they were up two games to none. Um, I think game for if you haven't been watching as Tuesday night, uh, the Black Hawks first, the blue. So I would definitely be checking that out. And um, I think that's it. I think that's all I had on hockey. Right? My Celtics, I watched them lose game one, but I'm just so psyched. They're in the fucking playoffs and now they're a young team. They should have won the game. They should have been able to close it out, but they didn't, but they hung in there. They got high that just a little young.

Speaker 2:          00:23:49       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:23:49       They just got to learn how to fucking a filler that hopefully, you know what, what I'm getting, I'm hoping, I'm hoping that we get Kevin Durant. He would be a great fucking Celtic. Uh, whether he does that or not, I mean, there's always someplace, uh, you know, what's this? This is the most crucial time and I, since I can remember for the Los Angeles Lakers with Colby just fucking retired. Okay. Their owner fucking died to now they got the sun.

Speaker 2:          00:24:21       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:24:22       Fuck head that he is sorry that it had nothing to do with the Lakers. I was just quoting. What movie was that? And then your son Fuck head that is left. Is drivers less true romance. Um,

Speaker 2:          00:24:36       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:24:36       Yeah. They have to make something happen. They got to throw their fucking money around. I don't know. They don't have the coach. They don't have it. This could be for the first time. You realize that the Lakers have one more fucking championships since 1970 than any other team in any other major sports.

Speaker 2:          00:24:50       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:24:53       So I got to respect what they've done more so than what anybody else has done prior to that. Because prior to that was the 23 skidoo years. Where did the shit was in fucking basically black and white, you know, segregated leagues. The Stanley Cup was the size of a shot glass, you know, the Celtics used to when that would be like fucking five white guys against five white guys or maybe five against four white guys. And then Bill Russell was out there. You know what I mean? It's just, it's just a completely different time, you know? Um,

Speaker 2:          00:25:24       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:25:25       I Dunno. We'll see. So anyways, let me do a little bit of advertising here. Sorry, my brain's all over the place and I just still can't get over how fucking people get mauled 20 1620 fucking 16 I mean to get mauled to death by a fucking tiger in 2016 it's, it's like,

Speaker 2:          00:25:45       okay,

Speaker 1:          00:25:46       I don't I to take a, I think the probability of getting run over by a stage coach is, is just as probable like helping people gain on, I got to look that up. Death by stage coach is, you know, this can be somebody, some wow. Which show in Oklahoma fell off the chuck wagon. Okay. You know, what's going to be a guy too, man killed under stage coach. Let's see if we get to see we're getting did you mean man killed under stage? Coach? One word. I guess I did. Unsettling events. Stagecoach robberies, police id man killed in Stowe crash.

Speaker 2:          00:26:28       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:26:29       Fatal crash on stagecoach road, 72 year old man was killed Sunday morning after a crash in West Lake township. I know, authority said.

Speaker 2:          00:26:40       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:26:41       A vehicle traveling northbound on coach Rowe job, I guess it doesn't happen and whatever. Somebody get kicked by a horse or something stupid. Something that should be happening during this time, but why can't you just admit that you are wrong? All right, I was wrong. It's more probable to get mauled to death by a tiger.

They stick it in the trunk, they sent it to you. You keep what you want. You take everything else you don't want. You throw it back in the fucking trunk and you send it back to them and that's it, and they don't send you any more shit until you ask them to because it's not a subscription service. All right.

Speaker 1:          00:33:47       I mean, that sounds like an episode of law and order. Boop, boop, boop, boop. Ooh. Like what the fuck were you doing out with the, with all of those kids? I found a, um, all right. My gym got delayed by some bullshit, you know, not some bullshit, just some shit. And I'm just like, now do it. Right. They're like, we can do it this way or we can do it the right way. I might do it the right way. So, um, I have not been working out and I've been eating like shit because I'm just like, well, the second the gyms there, I'm going to fucking go like a madman. But, uh, Jim is taking longer than I thought and uh, you know, oh, Billy started it looked like some overcooked mashed potatoes and I'm not liking, I'm not liking it one bit. Um, all right, let's, let's do some reads here.

Speaker 1:          00:34:31       Let's do some reads. Oh, you know what, I didn't talk about any of the other playoff series. Did I? I think you of the other NHL once the, uh, the filthy flyers it down to Oh to the Washington capitals and uh, they are, they are the perennial favorites to the, uh, the eastern conference. Uh, c real quick. Tampa Bay lightning leads Detroit to one Detroit one the last one. They fucking red backs up against the ropes. Big victory there. Islanders over Florida, two games to one. Nashville's up two games to none of a fucking Anaheim. Oh, this sucks. Bad. Fucking the kings and the ducks are going to get knocked out. No playoff hockey for oh fucking freckles out here. Dallas is up two games to none. Um, I'm completely in the dark with all of this bullshit cause I'm going to be in a writer's room.

Speaker 1:          00:35:18       I'm in, in the writer's room for the next olds, 18 weeks total to write the uh, the second season. And uh, believe it or not, I'm actually finding that I love being in the writer's room. I thought it was something that I was not going to enjoy because of the freedom that it has as a comedian, but it turns out I really like writing scripts and I like writing dialogue and all of that Shit and uh, we're having a great time and I think you guys hopefully are going to enjoy it. So now your next question should be built. How many episodes did they give you? A 10 10 episodes for season two. And when is it going to be at? When is it going to come out? Probably this time next year. It's animation. That's how long it takes. Um, I think they're saying may of next year is when it comes out, unfortunately. But uh, that's how it works. But it's going to be worth the wait. But I hope that now that we're kind of going, that once we do this, when we can immediately go into season three, I don't know how it fucking works. I guess that wouldn't make sense. They got to see how many people watch season two.

Speaker 2:          00:36:14       I Dunno.

Speaker 1:          00:36:16       I think by the time we finished season five, I'll be 60. That's what I'm guessing. All right, let's do some questions here for the week. Uh, come to Prague, come to Prague. Um, I'd like to go cry. Hey Billy wing nut. Just so you know, we started using your songs at circle time. Circle time is every morning at nine 15 after yoga. Is it his songs and words and learning English. All the kids singing our check kids please come to Prague. The fuck is circle time sounds oddly filthy. Uh, circle time.

Speaker 2:          00:36:56       Prague,

Speaker 1:          00:36:59       Prague, link, linguistics circle homepage,

Speaker 1:          00:37:06       the fuck. And I didn't know what that means. I can't tell you this. So I've stuck with the French have 51 fucking days and now it's starting to just be in my head. I still can't speak it. Well, if somebody is speaking it, I, I pick out a few words, but like reading it, I'm crushing it. Reading, I read, I transcribed this whole fucking article about the pope saying that, you know, as much as the Catholic church has been against condoms, there are certain instances, you know, that they don't think it's bad to use them. Um, you know, especially preventing, um,

Speaker 1:          00:37:42       the spread of HIV, aids, whatever, you know, and they said something about, you know, unprotected sex with male prostitutes. I think that that's what it said. I couldn't tell if it was that or men going to prostitutes. I couldn't quite get the translation. So, uh, I'm sticking with it. And, um, cause on dual lingo to a fee, if you do a hundred days in a row, they give you a couple of trinkets, whatever the fuck that means. So I'm, I'm over the hump of Brian Downhill now. And, um, I dunno, I just think I'm really doing it. Not only did I want to learn how to do it, but I just think it's funny. If someone is dumb as me becomes completely fluent in French and then that gives me the opportunity to go to France or go to Montreal and act like the dumb American and then listen to what they're saying about me and then just fucking hit him over the head with some fucking, I can't say perfect French, but like fluent French just watched their fucking, the little fucking pocket squares get all fucking in a bunch.

Speaker 1:          00:38:40       That's why I'm doing it. I'm doing it. I was going to take, I don't know how long it's going to take me, just I want to have that moment just once in my life or I could just sit there and have somebody trashing me in a different language and they don't know that I can hear everything. I understand everything that they're saying just so I can look at him and then fucking come back and I'm like, dude, DVD. But did they basically saying like, I know exactly what the fuck did you said? Right. I'm all right. Sorry. Most people want to learn it so they can communicate. Not me, not me. I want to do it so I can have an argument on the other side of the world. What does that say about me? All right. A cooking question. Do your Billy the butter basting bitch.

Speaker 2:          00:39:18       Ah, that was

Speaker 1:          00:39:19       a good, oh, say there you go. There you go. Something original. I liked that. Made fun of my cooking. You kept the alliteration going. You called me a bitch in the it. I give that one four stars. Four stars. All right. Uh, anyways, uh, I am a huge fan and I blah, blah, blah, Blah Blah and Yada, Yada, Yada. My question is, thank you for blowing through all that. My question is, you used to talk about cooking all of the time, but now you're rarely do what gives. Did you stop cooking? Uh, if not, what have you made lately? Please make more cooking videos. Like the pie crust one you made. I need something new to choke off too. Thanks. And Go fuck yourself. Um, yeah, I haven't been cooking. I've, um, when I, uh, when we write these episodes for Apis for family, I'm so fucking relieved.

Speaker 1:          00:40:07       I can finally talk about this shit. Um, it consumes my life. I mean, I basically, I go in at 10 30 every morning. There's usually some other bullshit I have to do. So I'm usually there by 10 in the morning and then we fucking write all day till about seven. And by the end of it, I just come home. I Pour Scotch, I stare at the wall, I fall asleep, my dog wakes me up at seven. I take her for a walk, I come home, I have breakfast, I try to bang out a podcast and maybe do a little bit of French, and then I go right back to work. So I don't have time to fucking do anything. Um, you know, I should do, I should start using blue apron. You know, Michelle, Mark Marin, he actually cooked a meal on it. It looked fucking delicious. Um, but I, uh, I should really start doing something like that because I have, I been eating like a sort of in a good way and sort of bad way.

Speaker 1:          00:41:00       I had the best mother fucking Burger I've ever had in Los Angeles and that is saying something and if you'd like to know where to go the next time you see me when you're in Los Angeles, if you ask me, I will tell you where the places, but I'm not saying it on a podcast because I hate when Anthony Bordain does that and this is cool fucking spot. And then he makes it, he makes it fucking, you know, every Tom, Dick and Harry's got to go out there and then it comes under new management. The whole thing gets fucked up. So, or even if I'm out on the road from on the road, just yell it out during my shelf. You, Hey, Barb is flawed. You are now like, you know, you bought a ticket, I'll tell you. Then he listened to this podcast for free. You don't get the information.

Speaker 1:          00:41:43       Oh, is it delicious? The fries were okay. The soda was, you know, they had the Mexican fucking coke and the fan to orange with the real sugar and credible, credible tasting that's west where this country is right now, Coca Cola is made better in Mexico than it is in the United States. What does that say about us? You know, and as Donald Trump, Hillary Clinton or fucking Bernie Sanders even approach that at any point during the this, this campaign they might have. Lord knows I'm not watching. All right? So I'm no where I last left. I was trying to learn how to make Gnocchi and I failed miserably. And my own wife, the woman who's supposed to love me unconditionally, sickness and health and good times and in bad. And when I made Gnocchi, it was a bad time. And what did she do? Did she stick by me? Did she say it's okay and rub my head? Nope. You know what she said? She leaned over and she goes, hey. And I was like, what? She got right mayor and she goes, you should make pasta anymore.

Speaker 1:          00:42:43       She said, you shouldn't make pasta anymore. You know, maybe she knows me well enough to know that when somebody says something like that to me, that just makes me go, all right, I'm going to fucking master this shit. You know? I mean, it's not like, you know, somebody says you shouldn't sing anymore. Well, you should dance anymore. I mean, I understand that. I mean, I fucking, there's just certain things, but I mean, cooking, it's just one of those things. So you just do it. You'll learn. He can learn how to do it. Like all these fucking people on the food network, they don't have any, they don't have any talent. It's just, they just, you know, they didn't have any friends and they just fucking, you know, they started off making cereal and then they just kept progressing. I'm kidding. I know it's an art form, right?

Speaker 1:          00:43:24       To fucking relax. Okay. Put your apron back on and go fucking make a souffle. All right. So, um, yeah, so I'm kind of stuck on that. But the next time I go to New York, I met somebody, um, and met somebody. It's very special. I met somebody in New York, uh, a chef at this Italian restaurant. He told me, he's like the real deal, like right off the boats and anytime you come to New York he goes, I'll show you how to make pasta from scratch, blah blah blah blah, because I took a pasta making class and uh, uh, they were supposed to then email a bunch of shit to help you out and they never had any follow through. And then I waited too long to try it again. And I finally, I kind of forgot some of the tricks. So, um, that's where I met with the cooking thing.

Speaker 1:          00:44:07       And, and as far as making like the cooking videos, I did the pie crusting cause that was another thing. I just thought it was funny. Someone like me knows how to do something like that, but like I can't cook better than most of the people out there, so I don't understand the point of it. Um, maybe if I, if I learn how to make Gnocchi, I'll teach you guys how to do it, but I'll have to do it for a long time before I feel like confident enough to make a video. Maybe if I fuck it up, it'll be funny. I have no idea. All right, let's, let's keep reading here, shall we? Okay. All right. Garden. Do we topsoil, one of my favorite things you use to talk about was your garden and your steps towards getting off the grid. My question is do you still have a garden and are you still taking steps to get off yourself off the grid? Um, I mean I have a lemon and a lime tree so I'll never get scurvy.

Speaker 2:          00:44:56       MMM,

Speaker 1:          00:44:59       no, I just, the level of like commitment that that takes and you have to have like a fucking hen house and shit. You know, I don't, I don't have time to become Mr. Green jeans and then what do I have to have a hen house guy? I have to have the chicken guy.

Speaker 2:          00:45:14       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:45:14       You know what I mean? It's like as you accumulate shit, then you have to get the something guy, right.

Speaker 2:          00:45:21       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:45:22       Yeah. You buy a fucking house. She immediately, you'd have a plumber, you got to have a fucking electrician, you know, you've got to have a, basically a handyman. Okay. Then what? Then you have a garden and you got to have a fucking landscape or gardening guy because you're too busy doing whatever you do for a fucking crook, a living. You get a pool, you need the pool guy, you know, you get a dog, you got the fucking dog guy, the vet guy, all of that shit. It's just more money flying out of your fucking wallet. And, um, I am very envious of people that have their own gardens and that type of shit. But, uh, I, you know, I have my little piece of fucking

Speaker 1:          00:46:00       La out here, which is not much. We all live on top of each. I'm literally looking out my window right now and I see the roof of the person's house next to me and that's just basically how it works, you know? And I look out the back, I look out my back window and I see the apartment buildings, the back of the apartment buildings from the street over. It's really not a place to plant some turnips, although I wish there was. And I don't think that could really get away with like having fucking chickens and shit. Some rooster crowing every morning cause uh, the noise ordinance is noise is not supposed to leave your property. Although most people the second they turn on their stereo, they break that fucking thing. But um, I would love to do it. I'd love to get solar panels and be off the grid, but she really can't be, still have to give them a little bit of money.

Speaker 1:          00:46:46       I forget. I don't know how it works, but they have some, so I know how it works. The president makes 400 grand a year, so he, they go, yeah listen, fuck, oh he want the second term, make this a law. We should make it a lot. Right. Next thing you know, it's a lot cause there's people live in the middle of nowhere. The electric company finds him and then they like, they show him and like you have to give us money every month, which is, I just don't understand how that is legal that goes around so many things that this country is allegedly about. Someone would force you. I understand taxes. So like, yeah dude, you want to live here? You've got to kick in for the puddles. I get that. But you have to buy power from this fucking noise. Don't fuck off. But that's not how it works. It's not how it works. If you guys know how to do it, if you how to get off the grid, by all mean not because I want to be off the grid. No, cause I give a fuck that I give money to the power companies. I just, you know when the shit hits the fan, I would like to be that beacon of light that all the zombies run too. Right?

Speaker 1:          00:47:44       He's still got a flat screen. Um, alright. Girlfriends. Wait. Oh Jesus. Here we go. Dear Bill, I'm a 21 year old guy and my girlfriend is 20 we've been taped. We've been talking for about six months now and we just recently decided to make it official. Now here's the part where I need your expert advice. Oh Jesus. How should I go about telling her? I think she needs to lose weight. She's not a fat ass by no means, but she could lose a few pounds. Now. I sound now I sound like an ass. I know. I sound like an Asshole, I think is what he's supposed to say.

Speaker 2:          00:48:17       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:48:18       Yeah, I know I sound like an asshole, but I care about her and want to see her be more confident. Thanks for the help. I enjoyed the show in Long Beach. Um,

Speaker 2:          00:48:30       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:48:30       How do you say she could lose it there? There is no way. Uh, what I would do is I would get yourself in great shape.

Speaker 2:          00:48:37       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:48:37       And start getting her into hiking with you and like, uh, you know, but you can't make somebody work out. You can't make somebody get in shape. They either want to do it or they don't. And um, you know, that's like a major, major, major fucking

Speaker 2:          00:48:53       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:48:54       You know, you tell telling a woman she needs to lose a few pounds, just like that. That's, that's the female equivalent of them saying to you like, you know, your Dick could be a little bit

Speaker 2:          00:49:03       beggar.

Speaker 1:          00:49:06       It's devastating. Um,

Speaker 2:          00:49:09       yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:49:10       I wouldn't say it to her, but uh, you know, you also got to think, you know, at 20 if they could lose, if they're already getting out of shape at 20 years of age, you know,

Speaker 2:          00:49:21       okay,

Speaker 1:          00:49:21       then what? Then they have a couple of kids that going to be a fucking house. I mean, that's just something you get, you gotta be honest about if someone doesn't take care of themselves, you know, and this works both ways too late ladies. Like if you're with some guy and he's in his twenties and he's sitting there and he's already getting Mantech, it's, it's not going to get better. And you got to sit there in, in and really just be like, how much do I love this person? Because I'm going to watch them slowly eat themselves to death. Cause that's what you're doing. And unfortunately, um, you chicken start coming home to roost in your forties, whatever the fuck you did, whenever you will start to go off the rails at 16 or 17 with drinking, drugging, eating or whatever, right around when you get to your forties is when the first like, like God damn that happened to him. I thought that was some old man shit. And you're like, oh wait, we're in our forties because you'll still feel like you're in your 20 self.

Speaker 2:          00:50:18       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:50:21       I Dunno. I would go a positive route. I would just tell her how I would tell her, uh, oh, we tell her how good she looked at me. That's just fucking, I don't, there's no way to do it that that is, there's no, that's a fortress in, there's no door in. You know what I mean? There's no door in on that one. You just have to just, if you're going to say it, if he just fucking say it, then you're really risking hurting her really bad. You know what I mean? Um, any who wants to do you don't, you don't want to fucking do that. You know? I wonder if women ever feel that way about guys. Like if there's anything like this, like, you know what? You just can't say that to a guy because that will hurt them too much. Do they ever think shit like that? I think shit like that with women. There's just certain things you just, you just don't fucking say like, what does it all I'm going to do is hurt her in ruiner for the next person when she fucking eventually comes to her senses and dumps me. Um, and then you'll be that, you know what this guy said to me one time,

Speaker 2:          00:51:22       yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:51:23       we were going into a weapon and I ordered a double cheeseburger. Any interrupted? He said, no, no, no. She wants to single,

Speaker 2:          00:51:35       you know, being that guy.

Speaker 1:          00:51:39       Um, no, I don't know. I don't know what to tell you. I can't tell you this though. I feel like when you are, you know, aside from just all wanting it to yourself to try to stay in shape, when you were in a relationship with someone, did just fucking let yourself go and just become a fat fuck. And you know, do you just not have the consideration that somebody is sort of obligated to have sex with you to just try and remotely keep yourself looking halfway decent? It's really a selfish fucking thing, you know? But we live in the age of, um, a lot of times the victim is, is the, is not as is considered like the antagonizer. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:52:19       You know what I mean?

Speaker 1:          00:52:21       I would never do that to me. I wouldn't ever just fucking put on a hundred fucking pounds, just come waddling into the fucking bedroom, you know, rollover on top of her since she would be completely grossed out. And every woman listening to this probably just went picture that me a hundred pounds heavier, naked, sweating on my upper lip. Crawling into fucking bed. Yeah, exactly. Isn't that disgusting? Well, that, that's a two way street sweetheart. You know, we don't want to see you come fucking waddling in under the room. You know, your hips taken out the fucking door jam. You know what I mean? It's just, it's not a, it's not fair to you, the person,

Speaker 1:          00:53:05       you know, when you really look at it and nobody understands that more than gay guys. I would say that gay guys have the most respect for the fact that someone's going to hook up with them. You know what I mean? I wonder if that pound for pound in the best fucking shape than anybody else or is it because they're trying to attract guys and they know guys are, I can't even say that shallow cause they always say that guy's a shallow when it comes to that. We are, but like you fucking hold up something shiny. A woman's like, I didn't want that. You know, they're just as bad. Right. Oh Christ. I'm all over the map. All right. On trial for a joke. All right, Bill, did you hear about the entertainer who might get prosecuted for his poem that trashed ahead of State? Oh, what country?

Speaker 1:          00:53:51       Uh, they're calling him a comic, but I think maybe Europe's version of a comic, not the traditional standup ball. Depends on where you go in Europe. Europe is a, uh, you know, it's not the biggest continent, but that's all. It's a long fucking trip from Paris over to Moscow. I think Moscow was technically still in Europe, isn't, I know the west coast of Russia is now, he sucked getting into the eastern Europe and you know, I mean they, they still had vampires out there. So you can only imagine how that would affect the artist standup comedy. I don't know what I'm talking about. All right. And Angela Merkel gave the go ahead to the Turkish prime minister to make an inquiry, which basically means put on trial all because of a stupid poem. Thoughts. I hate when people do that. Thoughts. Hmm. Talk about that. Um, yeah, it lists a bunch of countries that are just getting their first taste of standup comic.

Speaker 1:          00:54:47       It's comedy and they are going through their Lenny Bruce years. Um, which is what happens that happened. Lenny Bruce, he was put on trial, he was arrested for obscenity and all of that type of stuff. This is what happens. And once the government realizes that it's just jokes and that a standup comic doing an hour on jokes is not going to cause a revolution and that they can relax and continue to fuck over their own countrymen and sleep well at night doing it, then they usually ease up on it. And, uh, people are allowed to, you know, do stand up comedy. Like what's funny now is what's happening is there's this new, you know, sort of, I dunno what you would call it, Lenny Bruce time, but it's just more through people in the crowd. Dope. But it's not the government anymore, so it's really no big deal.

Speaker 1:          00:55:40       It's just, you know, people with agendas and websites and shit like that, you know, clickbait, clickbait people. Right. All right. Boyfriend wants to have sex with other girls. Um, I wonder if there's a way to basically support that person. Angela Merkel, can I help pay for the lawyer kick in, you know, all the comics around the world. Take fucking throw 20 bucks at it and uh, they could tie it up in the Turkish courts. Can that happen? I don't fucking know. Oh, you know what, I'm going to look that up. I'm glad you brought that to my attention. I know that there was some somebody in in Canada, the same thing happen and it's one of those things where it's like you want to talk about it, but you also don't want to feed that fucking beast and give all, all types of a notoriety. But then you're also going, well that's a fellow comic going through that Shit. There's gotta be a way in a stealth way to hopefully put that fire up. Um, you know, when I was in India, the podcast I did, the guys over there, they were going through some shit because they had a row, they did a roast and everything was fine. Everybody laughed and then they put it up on youtube and you know, there's like 40 million different religions there and somebody complained and

Speaker 2:          00:56:49       you know,

Speaker 1:          00:56:51       they were in a, definitely a, a, what's the word I should use? They were in a, they weren't a situation over there when I, you know, which is hilarious. Then a pluck of walking down the street with them. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:57:02       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:57:04       Like, how am I going to get fucking arrested because I'm with you guys. You know what's fucked up? I only spent 24 hours in India and I already miss it. I really want to go back. I had such a good time in the 24 hours despite the fact I had to get a piece of paper to leave, which was really fucking creepy. But um,

Speaker 2:          00:57:20       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:57:21       And that was weird and I, I didn't, I didn't know what I was thought I was going to think when I went there, but I felt an odd connection when I went there. Um, which is one of the coolest things when you travel. Like when you, you go every place you go to, it's going to be great when you actually go to a place. Like why is this fucking place feeling like, uh, like feeling like, oh like a home. Like I relate to these people more so than a lot of countries I've been to. I was over there going like, God, that guy reminds me of rich foss maybe cause I hung out with a bunch of comics. I had no idea. Anyways, boyfriend wants to have sex with other girls. Hi Bill. Hi Bill. Um, my boyfriend and I had been together for over two years. Recently we had broken up for a little less than a month, but we started talking again. We broke up because of though he loves me and wants to be with me. [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          00:58:12       he still wants to have sex with other girls. Our sex life isn't a problem because we fuck on a daily basis. Most of the twice a day she was supposed to write time. She was supposed to write time most of the time, twice a day. And he always says on the best people ever slash we'll have, he also believes that there is a very slim possibility that there might be something better for him and then he wants to experience other people before possibly spending the rest of his life with me. He's 25 years old, so he is pretty scared about staying with one person for the rest of his life. We are both not ready for marriage or that type of relationship, but I feel that ending a two and a half year relationship over his urges isn't the right thing. Especially since he still loves me and wants to be with me.

Speaker 1:          00:58:55       He's pretty unhappy, but he knows that being with other people won't help because he will feel the exact same way as he does. Now. He tells me that they, I am amazing and beautiful and he wants to have a perfect relationship, so I don't understand why he wants to leave that for something that is most likely going to be shittier. I can't go through another breakup with him because it was horrible. Uh, while we were broken up, he did have sex with one girl and talk multiple girls, but he didn't feel any better and he was still unhappy without me, please help. I don't know what to do and maybe this can help them as well. Thanks a bunch. Ah, well first of all, I'm not a fucking relationship expert, but a, first of all, I've got to give him Kudos for just being honest, saying that this is what I want to do.

Speaker 1:          00:59:40       Um, well I'll talk to you cause he, you, he didn't write it. So I would just say that, um, unfortunately this is where he is at 25 and um, you are not. So if he wants to fucking go out and do whatever the fuck he wants to do, you know, let them and then I think you should get on with your life. But I don't think it's healthy for you to have him keep, keep calling you during this time when he's out there fucking other people but still fucking with your emotions. So I think you let them go and let them go do whatever the fuck he wants to do and, but there's, you don't have any contact with them. Um, that might be a guy thing where you, you need some sort of closure, Assam Shit and gradually talk and then talk less and less and less. I don't know. I'm a fucking psycho when it comes to that shit. So that's what I would do. Um, I would say at this point, what he's doing is he's trying to do what's right for him. So you have to do what's right for you. Um,

Speaker 1:          01:00:45       he's putting himself first and his wants first, so you should do the same thing and there's nothing wrong with what he's doing. Um, he could have fucking lied and said that he didn't have urges and then gone and fucked around and you know, I don't, no matter what, he was going to end up hurting yet, but he did it. He did it. He did it the right way. He told you he broke up with you and um,

Speaker 2:          01:01:10       okay.

Speaker 1:          01:01:10       Yeah, he's got to go figure some shit out. But I don't think he needs to be calling you up and talking to you after a month and getting your heart going again and giving you hope.

Speaker 3:          01:01:20       But I don't know where they want to do, but I do love you. But

Speaker 1:          01:01:23       yeah, go fuck yourself with your wishy washy shit. All right. You know.

Speaker 2:          01:01:29       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:01:30       You're beautiful. You're young. You got your whole life ahead of Ya. You know, fuck them.

Speaker 1:          01:01:37       Just fucking, I dunno. Why don't you have a little you time over the next two to three months, see where you're at. Make a little list, figuring out what you want out of life. You know, who knows, who knows? Maybe he'll come back to you and be like, you know, and it sucked and you want to take them back. Maybe you won't, but a, I think you need to focus on yourself and not him. That's a, that's what I would do. Um, cause you didn't pull the trigger. He did. So there's no guilt on your end, but um, it's a shitty thing to do to do that to somebody and then come back like a month later and can drag you through that hell all over again, but then not get back with you and make some sort of a commitment to just go back and be like,

Speaker 3:          01:02:16       Ooh, you know, hooked up with one person. I still miss you.

Speaker 1:          01:02:20       You know, cause then you're going to be like, yeah. So what does that mean? Does that mean he loves me? And you got to sit there playing that mental tennis, fuck all that. Fuck all that. Yeah. Right. They're wishy washy. We'll see ya.

Speaker 1:          01:02:33       Just tell him what you need. You need, yeah, 100% commitment. That's it. You're either in it or you're out of it. I respect you. The fact that you're honest, but you know, I know I don't need you fucking hemming and hawing every fucking four weeks dragging me back down to that emotional pit. I'm done. Get on with your life. That's what I would do, you know, as fucking jackass. And then the second you're getting on with your life, he won't want to lose you and then he'll come back and just so we won't lose one of those fucking guys. That's what I'm thinking. Um,

Speaker 2:          01:03:04       okay.

Speaker 1:          01:03:04       Yeah, I would, I would get on with your life. That's what I would do. I hope that's good advice. I had no idea. All right, that's the podcast for this week. Thank you guys for listening and thank you to everybody from the bottom of my hat who watched the first season of f is for family. Uh, we're really going to try to outdo what we did in the first season and, uh, try and make them as funny as possible. All right. That's it. Go fuck yourselves. And I'll check an audio on Thursday. See Him.
