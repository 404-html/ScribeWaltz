Speaker 1:          00:00:02       Hey, what's going on is bill burn? It's time for the Monday morning podcast for Monday, July 16th, 2018 what's going on? How was, yeah, how you doing? It's Sunday afternoon when I'm recording this, so I'm still in Seattle, Washington. I've yet to do by shows up here. I'm imagining that they're going to go pretty well. Um, I was in Portland, Oregon last night. Jesus Christ. Great shows, amazing people coming out. You know, even though I tease them a little bit, you know, I was making fun of some of the people in Portland. Do you know what I like? What really amazes me about this generation, or actually maybe like the, I guess the past 10 years, it's just the amount of shit that guys do in their twenties and that like if I did it back in my twenties I would get the shit kicked out of me. It's really unbelievable. Is it bill, how about an example? I'll give you an example. I was coming over from Portland airport, by the way, the first time I've ever landed here or ever landed important one I should say, where it was actually just sunny and beautiful. Like I believe my first aborted landing I ever had.

Speaker 2:          00:01:18       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:01:20       Wasn't Portland, Oregon. It was fucking raining and the guy was coming in, there was all this wind shear and then he just fucking went up and around again and we were all like, dude, what the fuck? And I'm this old guy who was just like, you don't take as many chances as you need many times as you need or whatever. It's like, just get this bucket thing on the ground. Everybody kind of left. So this was the first time that was way back when I was working fucking happy. It's comedy club down the street. Um, which is a really interesting gig cause the guy who ran it back in the day, you know, he would paper the entire room, which means he would give the show a way. So you go in and on a Tuesday and the place would be packed with people who, you know, one, a comedy show, you know what I mean? So it was weird. It was like doing this giant office party and you do one Tuesday, one Wednesday, one Thursday to Friday, three Saturday and then one on Sunday. And uh, but the cool thing is I got to hang in Portland all week, check out all these cool places to eat and now, um, I kind of dip in and dip out. But that's that, that's an old story.

Speaker 1:          00:02:27       So anyway, so getting back to what the fuck I saw it driving from the airport from Oregon, from Oregon, from Portland airport over into my fucking hotel. I swear to God, I saw two guys in their 20s on a bicycle, built for two. And then behind the guy, those two guys was another guy. Do you remember those cars when you were a kid? If he had like a toy car, you got it, got in it right? It's made all let them metal and then you pedaled it. Yeah. This guy had an adult version of that car. I'm riding behind the two guys on a bicycle built for two. Now this might seem harsh and I might seem old school, but shouldn't they be getting the shit kicked out of them? I know in a perfect world they should be able to do whatever makes them happy. But there's just something about that VA [inaudible] where you're so begging for attention.

Speaker 2:          00:03:26       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:03:26       You know what I mean? You just can't get on a bicycle. It's gotta be a bicycle built for two. It's gotta be a little toy car and you're a fucking adult in it with your God damn hipster beard. Like, I dunno, I'm really disappointed with the bullies in the millennial generation. You know, you're, you're letting a lot of stuff slide. Is he advocating bullying something?

Speaker 2:          00:03:51       Yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:03:51       a fucking spit ball. Anything. I mean, I, I just, I was in the middle of the pack when I was in school. I got bullied and I bullied some kids. You know, I was right in the fucking bill. You know, I was background. I wasn't cool. I wasn't a nerd. I was just one of those people that filled out your class picture. That's all the fuck I was, you know? And I just felt like this pressure, like that somebody is not doing the job needs to get done.

Speaker 2:          00:04:20       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:04:20       I felt like sticking my head out the window, like fucking ogre in that goddamn movie and just be like, just something. I mean, how as an adult are you supposed to sit there and talking to another adult with a waxed mustache and never fucking bring it up?

Speaker 2:          00:04:44       You know, I, I don't know

Speaker 1:          00:04:48       that shit. I Dunno. It's, it's really is like, it's like how

Speaker 2:          00:04:53       okay

Speaker 1:          00:04:54       bored are you as a fucking person that you have to like become like a character. Like you go back and you watch a beer commercial from the late seventies, early eighties, and then you just decide that you're going to dress like that guy, but she's still going to be your douchey self, but you're going to have, you know, his mustache and Hairdo and tee shirt. It's really fucking weird. I don't know.

Speaker 2:          00:05:21       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:05:21       I Dunno. Just the shit that bothers me. Um, I'm having sort of a anger relapse. I was doing so well and the other day I snapped in the car when this fucking person just, you know, took them like nine tries to parallel park and if actually felt weird to yell in the car, cause I hadn't in a good three weeks. So I tried to get an in check, but I think I let the fucking genie out of the bottle. So I need to uh, sit down and work on myself again. Because today when we were flying from Portland up to Seattle,

Speaker 2:          00:05:57       you know, we were boarding

Speaker 1:          00:05:58       the plane

Speaker 3:          00:05:59       and um,

Speaker 1:          00:06:02       I was in the first group, you know, after people in the military, people with disabilities, people with kids, people with dogs that make them feel like it's okay to fly. Uh, people with acne problems. Like I don't know how many fucking groups around now before group one boards, group one is really like group 26 at this point, right? You know, it's blue shirt Fridays. Anybody with a blue shirt can now board anyway, so,

Speaker 2:          00:06:32       okay,

Speaker 1:          00:06:32       we walked out onto the tarmac to board, right? And I see this woman in front of me, he has stopped, you know, it's like when these deals where you walk outside to get on the plane and there's this little zigzag sorta ramp, you have to walk up and she stopped while this flight attendant is helping this other woman up there. So I'm thinking in my head, well you know, she didn't tell me to stop so I'm going to walk around this lady, I was kind of being a Douche and I went to walk around her and she fucking stuck her hand out like that. She told me to wait, she kinda like hit me with their hands. She did like the mother thing and she was like

Speaker 3:          00:07:06       old,

Speaker 1:          00:07:08       like white hair and shit and like the shit that went through my fucking head, not initially when she hit me, I was just surprised like what the fuck? She just hit me.

Speaker 3:          00:07:19       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:07:21       Oh my God. The level that I judged her.

Speaker 2:          00:07:24       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:07:25       I was like, is that how you got up in the first class? You fucking competitive cont you know? Meanwhile, I was going to walk around her and I knew I was supposed to wait and I was being a Douche. I just kept playing it over my head that I just wished I walked right through her little fucking stiff arm that she gave me. And um, I ended up sitting behind her on the plane and in my, my, in my, my brain's telling me to hit the back of her chair to rattle her head a little bit, but you know, the, the, the rest of my brain's going through it. It's an old woman. Why are you letting her get to you like this? And then when we landed, I was thinking like, she's not married, just no fucking way any guys putting up with her. And then it looked and she had a wedding ring and it was just like, uh, the fuck is wrong with some somewhat getting off the plane now we'll walk down one of those ramps. And I was actually laughing at myself because I knew I was going to have to pass her and get into the airport before her,

Speaker 1:          00:08:17       you know, just to somehow make up for that fucking moment. Right. How fucking stupid is that? And then I do it. I turned around and glance and look at her. She doesn't even know that I exist and I wasted all of that energy. You know? It probably took probably, I don't know, 40 seconds off my life with that level of just, you know, it was like legit hate. Like I hate this person. I mean, I don't like, so she, she fucking touch me, you know, what am I, what are you supposed to do it? You don't want me to just say, Hey d yell at some Old Lady. Get your fucking hands off me lady. Ah, do it again. You'll never make another batch of cookies. I mean, what, what exactly am I supposed to be doing there? I just, you know, I created that whole situation and I've really, if I'm honest, looking back, I knew that she was flying first class, so she was probably on some level of lunatic and I, and a control freak. And I kind of knew that if I went around her, it was going to bugger. I just did not anticipate her giving me the flare chop when I tried to go pastor. So I kinda got what I deserved. Oh Man.

Speaker 1:          00:09:41       I can't believe how upset I let that get me and I created the whole fucking thing. I really am a pathetic human being, but um, you know, it makes for a good story. You know, it helps fill up a podcast sitting here in the hotel room. Right. Oh, by the way. So I'm at, I'm in the airport, we know before this lady gave me the flare chop and, uh, the World Cup final is like happening and I'm taping it at home. And it is so not a big deal in this airport that I can actually walk in public. Well, the super bowl of the world is being played and no one's, there's no spoiler alert. Nothing. No one had it on. It wasn't on, on any TV. I didn't see anybody watching the fucking game on their phone. If I didn't go on Instagram, I wouldn't even know who won this fucking insane.

Speaker 1:          00:10:32       But anyways, I guess France one. All right. Congratulations. What do they say? I Lay, lay, lay blue, right. I Layla blue, congratulations to France and congratulations to Croatia. A country of what? 4.1 million people according to Pete Davidson and his Instagram page, um, that they got that far was fucking incredible. Um, and I knew I was going to be happy with either person winning and I obviously love France and, uh, Croatia was the underdog, so I was rooting for them, but I did not see the game. I heard there was an own goal, you know, fortunately he didn't do that in South America, so I think he has a chance when it gets back to his hometown, but, uh, they lost by two goals anyways. What the fuck are you going to do? But I did not see it. But, um, I did in this world club become a soccer fan and I've gone from not giving a fuck to wanting to Google where the next World Cup is going to be so I can actually go. Um, and I'll go there with 40 other Americans if our team makes it and will cheer them on until they lose in the first fucking round or whatever the fuck happens. Um, so anyways, I'm up here in Seattle, Portland, and Seattle. Well, you know, two of my favorite cities. What are your favorite cities? Oh, glad you asked a Portland, Seattle.

Speaker 1:          00:11:53       I say Seattle over Portland, you know?

Speaker 3:          00:12:00       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:12:00       They're both nice. Portland just has a little more of a hipster Douche factor, you know, it was sort of a tie. And then when I saw that guy in the bice, the two guys in the bicycle built for two with the kid with the Kitty car behind it, I says, I was like, I fucking can't. All right. You know, and then you come to Seattle and you got the new world order, hippies. I mean, there's a lot up here to kind of be annoyed with, but a beautiful cities, lush land, all kinds of water. And that's just amazing up here. Um, San Francisco, Los Angeles.

Speaker 2:          00:12:33       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:12:34       Milwaukee, Minneapolis, Chattanooga, Tennessee. These are my favorites.

Speaker 3:          00:12:41       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:12:45       Obviously I'm from Boston.

Speaker 3:          00:12:48       Uh,

Speaker 1:          00:12:49       Cleveland, Detroit, Buffalo, Pittsburgh.

Speaker 3:          00:12:54       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:12:56       I think that's it. The rest of the towns can all go fuck himself. Kidding. Tulsa, Oklahoma. What's, what's my favorite one in Texas? I'm going there in two weeks. I'm going to fucking Houston, Texas in July as a redheaded bald male. The fuck was I thinking? Houston. Dallas, San Antonio. Austin college station.

Speaker 2:          00:13:27       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:13:28       I Dunno. It's, they're all kind of the same.

Speaker 2:          00:13:31       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:13:31       It's flat. This, the most shiny is new pickup trucks you've ever seen in your life. I've never seen so many shiny brand new pickup trucks in my four door pickup trucks in my life. They looked like they just, they just got taken right off the showroom floor.

Speaker 3:          00:13:50       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:13:52       Can you hear my stomach growl? And by the way, I'm having a steak dinner tonight, so I just ate light like an hour and a half ago. I had a soup and a salad, fucking old bastard. Um, by the way, I'm up to 70 pounds on the lat pull down machine. Ah, you liked that? The fucking rotator cup is a rehab and a person helped me out, told me I need to get up to about 120 pounds on that thing and I have to do it really slowly so I don't fucking blow up my shoulder again. I've got one 20 then I can attempt to do for pull ups and I'm back in the game cause I have a bet with Versie that when I'm 70, I'll be able to do 10 of them and uh, that's not going to be a fucking problem.

Speaker 2:          00:14:33       Yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:14:33       that's what I'm saying. It's 50. We'll see. That's a long 20 years man. And I'll tell you all depends on how I do it. You know, if I live my life the way I did last month, I won't be able to do to pull ups. I don't even know if I'll be around to do pull ups. If I live my life the way I'm living at this month, you know, I might do 15 I'm crushing it. This month was 16 days in, Oh, freckles hasn't had a drop of booze, said shutting it down. I shut it down for a month. Give yourself a good fucking month then ease myself back into my binge drinking. I can't tell you this though. I have never caught a fucking cold like this cold that I caught in Minneapolis and into a whatever the fuck I went after that to Troy Jesus Christ. This thing has been lingering. I caught it on like June 30th and I was sick for a week and now it's just been lingering like, uh, I dunno. I don't know if I need to lay off dairy or something to get the last little bit out of it. Last night I was on stage and I started like cough in my throat was getting all fucking dry. I Dunno. I'm sure you guys out there, none of whom are doctors all have a fucking reason why. You know, maybe I'm just an old bastard.

Speaker 1:          00:15:59       Speaking of that, speaking of being an old bastard, I put the TV on and this hotel, this hotel is really fucking annoying. You know, like I wanted to order room service and a sec. Where's the menu? Where's the menu? I can't find the menu. So I called them up, they got the men used on the TV sound like, okay, all right, well I'm not going to get upset, you know, but getting up to upset lately, let's just, this is the way the kids do it nowadays. Let's do that. And I go on there, right? And you know God damn well that the fucking thing is on the TV cause it cause they want you to solve. They want you to order through the fucking TV. So they have that information. What's his name? Who is he? How old is he? What food does he eat? We've gathered all of this fucking information. What kind of porn? Oh does he watch? Did he rent a movie? All of this fucking inflammation, that dimension that probably watching you through that little fucking camera on the TV too. And then they just bundle it all together and they sell it. So I didn't know where to throw the TV I called instead that probably got something connected to the phone. It's just funny. It's fucking unbelievable. I would, can you imagine if you actually read the file,

Speaker 2:          00:17:07       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:17:07       You know on yourself that these corporations have like the amount of fucking information that they have about you. And if they actually kept the video cause they'd been, they've gotten busted watching people in the, in their fucking houses, watching people in their houses watching TV. What if you're banging your wife,

Speaker 2:          00:17:27       you know?

Speaker 1:          00:17:30       Well if you're walking around fucking butt ass naked, what do they do? This is it. How is that legal? It's unfucking real man, these fucking nerds and making robots that you can fuck the down there. Fucking them at the factory trying them out before they sell it to us. You've got these other fucking nerds, they're in the goddamn watching your fucking, your wife and there's barely a ripple, barely a fucking ripple. But as a comedian, if you send out a fucking tweet that steps on somebody's toes, all of a sudden you ended it just like this big fucking dustup. If I ever get in trouble for a fucking Twitter or anything like that's going to be my defense. Hey, hey, hey, hey guys, guys, guys, I'm not fucking a robot. Okay? I'm not bundling your information, watching your bang and your spouse through your fucking TV. Let's have some priorities. Huh Ladies?

Speaker 2:          00:18:26       I'm sorry.

Speaker 1:          00:18:31       Getting all fucking amped up here again.

Speaker 2:          00:18:33       You know? Uh, all right.

Speaker 1:          00:18:38       So anyways, so I get it. I put it on the TV to try to find the fucking menu on this TV itself. Like the only way you can like change the channels, you have to go back to guide and then goes to, I mean, I came, I can't even figure out the fucking TV.

Speaker 2:          00:18:51       Okay,

Speaker 1:          00:18:51       this is why I hate technology and why it felt like somewhere in the 90s they just should have stopped. Quality of life was good enough, you know? But this shit where it's just like I always equated to reading. It's like I learned how to read. I didn't have to relearn how to fucking read every six months. But like with computers and TV and shit, that's what it's like. It's like, Hey, I know how to turn on a TV. I know how to operate a TV. And then the next day, oh wait, no, I don't.

Speaker 2:          00:19:21       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:19:22       Now I have to waste time. Relearning something that it'd be like every time you've got your fucking car, you didn't have to, every six months. Now you don't know how to drive. You have to learn how to fucking drive again. We get a bill. You don't like technology? No, I liked it. I liked it to a point, you know, central air conditioning, you know, modern medicine and that type of shit. But I mean, we were, we were all fucking good right up until, I mean, what did they really cured? And the last fucking 20 years, people still die of cancer. People still go bald, you know? Uh, you know, people still get hammer toes.

Speaker 2:          00:19:56       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:19:56       Actually they can fix hammertoes right. Stop hammertoes boo Doo Doo Doo. Right. They can fix those fucking things, can't they?

Speaker 2:          00:20:02       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:20:04       Anyway, so I get into the fucking hotel here and I saw this hilarious ad for this shit called age ageless, ageless male,

Speaker 2:          00:20:14       you know,

Speaker 1:          00:20:15       and then like, Hey, what'd you get over the age of 40 your testosterone levels go down and be, yeah, cause you're too old to fuck.

Speaker 2:          00:20:23       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:20:24       Cause no one wants to see you with your shirt off cause you fucking old and now people are taking these goddamn young pills.

Speaker 2:          00:20:32       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:20:33       You know you want to fuck right into your eighties. You want your Dick to stand at attention. You want your balls to support the troops.

Speaker 2:          00:20:42       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:20:42       Get this fucking ageless male. All these fucking morons pumping all this extra. Isn't that how you lose your fucking hair? Isn't like a testosterone issue. Like you have too much in there. That's going to be fucking hilarious. All these guys going for abs that had a nice set of hair, then they're going to go fucking balls. Now they've got to get the fucking hair plugs. It just never ends. I bet the guys who make hair plugs also make ageless male, you know, and they, and they've gotten all the bald guys that gave a fuck enough to get hair plugs. So kind of like, you know, you reached that saturation point like remember Crocs, it's just they ran out of Douche bags to find, to buy those things, which by the way, man, I've been like I told you getting rid of a bunch of shit

Speaker 2:          00:21:31       and um,

Speaker 1:          00:21:34       that's all I see stuff as. No, I just look at it like that shit. I'm just gonna have to throw out one day,

Speaker 2:          00:21:41       you know,

Speaker 1:          00:21:42       we walked through the airport deed Delray, who fucking murdered last night murder. You hear me? Murder.

Speaker 2:          00:21:51       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:21:51       He was pointing out some store at the airport that sells records and all this shit. He's like, man, he's like, dude, that starchy hills, you know, detox. He fucking kills man. People go in there and I just looked in, there I go, that is just a bunch of shit I'm going to have to throw out one day.

Speaker 2:          00:22:07       Okay,

Speaker 1:          00:22:07       I'm done dude. I'm not taking anything, you know. Well, I did that show like last week, uh, at the Hooters upstairs in the big room. When I left, they tried to get me a fucking hat and a t shirt. Say I'm all set. Thank you

Speaker 2:          00:22:24       all good.

Speaker 1:          00:22:26       Don't need that lane around the fucking house. I got so many God damn jackets. I don't know how the fuck I have enough fucking jackets. I could close every homeless person. That's roughly my size in Los Angeles. The amount of jackets I have. And um, does anybody in, is there a coat drive? It's fucking July.

Speaker 1:          00:35:23       He's a great university city with an awesome history, which we know interests you. It used to be called Breslau and it was one of the Nazi strongholds at the end of World War II. You can Google fet Sung Breslow or CG of Breslov for some of the insane backstory. I will definitely be doing that. Uh, in fact, the Nazis evacuated the city as the allies were approaching, they evacuated the citizens to Dresden, Germany, where they were mostly all killed in allied firebombing. Yeah, in Dresden. Yeah. Oh yeah. Yeah. Whoever lost World War II was going to be tried for war crimes. Um, there was all kinds of evil done in that. Also, this is one of the cities where the solidarity movement started in 1980 which contributed to the collapse of communism. Oh, I remember that guy. That guy with the big mustache.

Speaker 1:          00:36:20       He, he got you guys all mobilized over there. I forget the guy's name. Plus there were like 400 dwarf statues hidden all around the city. Weird but cool.

Speaker 1:          00:40:30       SECC has nobody's going to the movies anymore, so they're trying to make back the fucking budget of the movie. Um, I actually worked on a movie this week.

Speaker 2:          00:40:41       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:40:41       Written by and directed by the one and only Steve Byrne. You got me a couple of days on his movie. An old freckles went down there and, uh, I played a cunt, so it wasn't much of a stretch. I wasn't really acting. I just sort of did what the fuck I normally do. Um, anyways, do you want, the great thing about not drinking is aside waking up fresh as a goddamn daisy. I mean, my freckles glow when I wake up when I'm not drinking is

Speaker 2:          00:41:16       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:41:16       I got on the plane and I landed and I went down and I worked out.

Speaker 2:          00:41:20       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:41:21       And then took a fucking steam and I'm knocking out my podcast here. I would not have done this. Granted, I don't have any crazy stories about going into bars and shit, which of feeds the podcast, you know, but at some point I just have to make a decision here. You know, am I going to wake up sober with a less funny podcast or am I going to keep boozing and continue to crush the podcast game? No kidding. Um, I actually have no idea where my podcast is in the overall I, all these fucking people that do podcasts like I'm the number one fucking, but they been like, everybody's fucking number one. Everybody has a million fucking downloads. I don't want to get it. How can everybody be number one, everybody's in the fucking top 10. Then I had this guy on as a guest and it put me in the top down and fucking active.

Speaker 1:          00:42:20       Um, anyways, what the fuck was, I just look it up. I want to look up that shit about the fucking Nazis to World War II. The, the, the fucking crimes against the shit that you read. Like the shit that American troops to, I read this fucking thing and this guy shot this Japanese soldier and like eat the guy couldn't like fucking move. I don't know if he's like paralyzing. He had gold teeth and the dude was still alive and the fucking guy took a knife out, was digging the gold teeth out of the guy's mouth while he was alive. And the dude was screaming in agony and the other, another American soldier went up and just shot the guy like Jesus Christ put him out of his fucking misery.

Speaker 1:          00:43:05       Crazy. You know what I mean? But everybody makes movies and everybody on one side is fucking evil and everybody else, dude, you can't, you can't be involved in that shit with the people go fucking nuts. You know? Especially all it is is just, I would think that once like hook out mad I got at that fucking old lady who gave me the flare chop. Now imagine if I was man enough to join the armed services, right? Armed Forces, whatever the fuck you call him. And I'm out there on patrol and I see one of my friends get killed. Like what kind of fucking moody you going to be in after that? You know, it's fucking insane and I swear to God, the more I watched the discovery channel and the more I watched chimpanzees behavior, I swear to God, just watch those fuckers. Watch what the fuck they do to each other.

Speaker 1:          00:43:58       I watch what they do to other monkeys and shit. I'm telling you telling you this, that's what we are. Whenever I watched shit on TV, I put send these for years. I just always think of this fucking documentary that I watched these chimpanzees and like 10 of them ganged up on the southern chimp. They fucking fuck this thing up. Did horrible things, agonizing things to this monkey killed it. Then afterwards they were all fucking amped up and it was like they were all talking shit about what they did in the fight. So whatever. I watch shit on TV and I see like, you know, Trump talk in this shit or that fat fuck there in Korea run in his fucking, I swear to God, he looks like a giant piece of fucking you. Every Toros Sushi. It's like from the softest part of the tuna, like melts in your mouth. Like God helped that guy. If he's ever in a plane crash that lands in a snowy mountain and they got to start eating people because that guy is going to be a prime cut. It's all fucking marbled. You know, he's the boss's son. He's never done shit.

Speaker 2:          00:45:02       You know,

Speaker 1:          00:45:05       isn't it funny that he walks around that army outfit and he's like fat?

Speaker 2:          00:45:10       You know?

Speaker 1:          00:45:11       Was that when you go to the, you know, those fat people that always wear workout clothes, that old joke. Um, anyways, here we go. Let's read another one here. Uh, Africa, a Billy freckled fuck. Longtime Fan. Love your work, blah, blah, blah. Listen, I know you're planning on touring eastern Europe next year we got another one. Uh, but how about a tour of South Africa? At some point, if you and the lovely Nia ever managed to make your way to this side of the world, please don't hesitate to contact. Also, always know, always wanting to know if you are friends with Bryan Cranston or not do to your time together on breaking bad. Thanks so much. And Go fuck yourself. Ps when he going to be on Kona. Again, a lot of questions. All right, let's start with Africa. I love to go over there and I could tell you this right now.

Speaker 1:          00:45:57       There's no way I would go on one of those fucking safaris in that open car. As those lines walk up looking at you. I know they, they, they say that like those lions, like they look at the car and the person all is like one giant thing. So that's why they don't just don't jump up and just yank somebody off to truck. Well one of these days, one of those lines is going to figure it out and they're going to yank somebody off the truck and it ain't gonna be fucking me. I can tell you that right now. Do you ever see that fucking video? Is that uh, that poor woman as an Asian family, she didn't want to, she was driving through the safari. She didn't want to drive and she got out and walked around the car and I'm telling you, man, this tiger comes into frame frame and grabs her and yanks. Like I couldn't Yank

Speaker 2:          00:46:52       like

Speaker 1:          00:46:53       dish rag out of frame faster than this thing. Took this 115 pound woman out of the frame and then like her son or something that didn't know what to do in this fucking hero ran over there and then he ended up getting killed. And the other is mom got like mall or something. It was fucking brutal. Fucking brutal. So I know you probably laugh and go and film, you know, we have cities over here. It's not just a bunch of Lions and tigers fucking walking around. I know, but I'm just saying the touristy thing to go go over there. Your, you basically your zoo is the jungle. Unless I'm crazy.

Speaker 2:          00:47:30       I Dunno. Anyways. Um, what was the other thing I always wanted to know? If you are friends with Brian Crane? I'm friendly with him.

Speaker 1:          00:47:38       The few times I've run into him. Have I run into him since breaking bad? I don't think I have during breaking bad, I ran into him at a party with a mutual friend.

Speaker 2:          00:47:49       Um, yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:47:54       And I don't remember ever, I don't ever remember us coming to blows. So I would say that we are very friendly, but we, uh, we don't hang if that's what your question is. Um, what am I going to be on Conan? And again, I don't know, hopefully soon. I fucking love Conan. I love South Africa and in love. Bryan Cranston. Me. He went three for three here. All right. The crazies.

Speaker 2:          00:48:17       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:48:17       Uh, the crazies. Hey Bill, the crazy little thing about you getting called the Republican Douche is that I see just as many people on reddit and Twitter accusing you of being a liberal softy. Yes. And all of that is, is, is just more evidence of what a contact him. All right. What? I'm in La, I make fun of Hilary. What? I'm in a red state. I make fun of Trump, you know, I don't understand being in front of a group of people and just saying what they already think. Like where is the fun in that? Say The opposite of what they think and make them mad and see if you can get them to stay. Right. Anyways, it seems like people just attack and focus on only one thing they care about. As you always say, as you always say, I love you, congratulate on Royal Albert Hall. It's my dream to play trumpet there. Thanks. To go fuck yourself. I hope that dream comes true. Yeah. Um, yeah, I've been accused of,

Speaker 2:          00:49:20       yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:49:22       It all depends on what, what the argument is. Yeah. I think, um, yeah, I've been called a red pill eating Republican. I've been called a liberal liberal, a charge snowflake, cut cold, all of that shit. And I've been called a centrist. I love the centrist one. Like, isn't that the smart one? Well you kinda in the middle. You lean a little bit. I lean left. I think I do. Anyway. So it all depends on who the fuck I'm talking to. It depends on how far left you are. Um, how far right you are. You probably think I leaned way left. I don't know. But a centrist did. Somebody like, I don't know. I can be swayed. You know, you present a good fucking argument.

Speaker 2:          00:50:14       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:50:15       You know, take a guy like Ted Nugent. I don't agree with a lot of this shit that that guy says, but he does. He does say Shit on occasion. I'm like that. I agree with, I just don't write people off 100%,

Speaker 3:          00:50:29       you know?

Speaker 1:          00:50:31       And I also don't think that I have all the fucking answers. So if that makes me, I don't know what the fuck that makes me. He says centrist. Do you realize how fucking Douchey that is? That adults literally have to like it come up with a label? Everything.

Speaker 1:          00:50:51       What that really means is you don't think the way I think and I can't fucking handle it. So I'm going to come up with a word that is going to have some sort of negative connotation. And I think you're so weak as a person that it will affect, I don't give a fuck what I really don't give a shit. You're a centrist. Am I? Okay. All right. You're a liberal snowflake. Yeah. Okay. All right. You're a Trump supporter for, how can I find five? There you go. Now go yell about that to somebody at work.

Speaker 3:          00:51:22       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:51:24       Anyways, documentary about origin of soccer. Oh, by the way, I learned more about that World Cup trophy. Somebody sent me this thing on Twitter. Okay, so there's one World Cup trophy.

Speaker 2:          00:51:37       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:51:38       And you're not allowed to have it because it's worth like 20 million bucks. So if you win it you, they actually give you a replica of it. This is what this person was trying to tell me. I don't know if any of this is true. And then somebody else told me that if you win like three of them, you actually get to keep the fucking thing in Brazil cast one and then they had to make another one now rather than just telling you guys shit that I've heard. I could actually look up World Cup trophy.

Speaker 2:          00:52:06       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:52:07       Which I can't believe how small it is.

Speaker 2:          00:52:10       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:52:11       It's ridiculous. World Cup, trophy history. Here we go. Ah Right. And I'm going to click on it. Let me do what everybody does. When you search something.

Speaker 3:          00:52:20       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:52:21       On the fucking Internet is you just take the first, what the fuck is this thing? Where the hell did this? Just take me. Have you noticed now? Like they just gives you one option. You know they're paying, people are paying for that. Look at this. It keeps taking me the same fucking site. World Cup trophy, his story search, Google, come on.

Speaker 2:          00:52:52       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:52:53       Keeps taking me this fucking website. I'm not going to name the name of it. Look at that. It just fucking kicked me off. You fucking cons. How much did they pay? I can only go to U World Cup trophy and a triple trophy history search. Google. There we go. All right.

Speaker 1:          00:53:21       It was a fucking glitch or something. The World Cup is a gold trophy. Oh, it's actually made out of gold. Ours is fake shit and wonders are so big. Like the Stanley Cup is made out of fucking aluminum. Stainless steel maybe, uh, is a gold trophy that is awarded to the winners of the FIFA World Cup associated bumper. Bubba. Since the advent of the World Cup in 1932, trophies have been used. The jewels rimet trophy from 1930 to 1970 and the FIFA World Cup trophy from 1974 to present day. The first trophy originally named victory bell later renamed in honor of Fifer President Jules Rimet, or is that use remat? I have no idea. Was made of gold plated, sterling silver and Lapis Lazuli Zuli, whatever the fuck that is as depicted and depicted Nike, the, the Greek goddess of victory. Oh, is that what the sneaker company has? I didn't know that.

Speaker 2:          00:54:27       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:54:28       Wait, let's do a quick little aside here.

Speaker 2:          00:54:32       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:54:32       In ancient Greek mythology,

Speaker 2:          00:54:34       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:54:35       Nick was a goddess who personified victory. Her Roman equivalent was Victoria. She was variously described as the daughter of the titan upon the gods. This system, uh, uh, I, I have no idea. I had no fucking idea. Look at that. Learning something that'd be even bill can learn something. Anyways, Brazil won the trophy outright in 1970 prompting the, the commissioning of the replacement. Well, why did it, how did they win it outright? They just want it so many times like, hey, just give to these fuckers with second carton it across the world. The original Jules room at trophy was stolen in 1983 and never recovered. What? Yeah, there's only one pro that's a drug. Lord, something fucking Pablo Escobar had that or something. The subsequent trophy called the fight for World Cup trophy was introduced in 1974 made an 18 carat gold.

Speaker 2:          00:55:35       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:55:35       With is something basis, Dan. Okay, now wait a second. Wait a second.

Speaker 2:          00:55:40       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:55:40       World Cup trophy stolen. Maybe it wasn't so fucking small. They couldn't have stuck it under their shirt. The theft of the jewels rimet trophy. It was stolen in 1966 prior to the 1966 world cup. The trophy was later recovered. One man, I thought they said they didn't get it. One man, Steve Cook, a Barista was convicted for being involved, but other possible culprits is still a no. You can't tell me that guy's not a fucking legend.

Speaker 2:          00:56:14       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:56:15       Trophy place in a, how come that hasn't been made into a movie? Some sort of fucking comedy. What was he some jerk off from a sports bar. The football associated received the cylinders. It's a theft. On the March 20th Sunday, March 20th when the guards began a noon circuit around 1220 they noticed that someone had forced open the display case and the rear doors of the building and stolen the trophy. The wooden bar that held the trophy that held the door closed was lying on the floor. That's all they had to stop them. These removed the screws and the bolts that held the other side of the door.

Speaker 2:          00:56:52       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:56:52       They went to Home Depot and bought some screwdrivers in, stole the biggest sports trophy in the fucking world. What is simple time? They had removed the pad lock from the back of the display case, taking the trophy and left the way they came. None of the guards had seen or heard anything suspicious though. One of them reported that he had seen a strange man by the public telephone when he had visited the laboratory on the first floor is those guys were fucking offer Scotland Yard took control of the case and gave it to the flying squad. The flying squad?

Speaker 2:          00:57:26       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:57:28       What the fuck is that? Sounds like a musical. The flying squad also known as the robbery squad is a bunch is a branch of this.

Speaker 2:          00:57:37       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:57:38       The serious and organized crime command did an eight year old name all this shit with London's metropolitan police raw. Is this serious? It's not the, it's not the frivolous crime command. This is this serious and organized crime squad purpose is to investigate commercial armed and unarmed robbery is along with the prevention investigators. Who gives a fuck. Sounds like they have uniforms.

Speaker 2:          00:58:08       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:58:10       Oh, then somebody, oh, that's somebody. Actually they ransom for the fucking thing. On March 21st Joe Mirrors the chairman and the football section received an anonymous phone call. The unknown man said that mirrors would receive a parcel at Chelsea football club. The next day the parcels delivered to mirror his home. It contained the removable lining from the top of the trophy and a ransom note that demanded 15,000 pounds in $1 a one in five pound notes. The letter stated that the FAA, the FAA should place a code coded, add, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

Speaker 2:          00:58:50       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:58:51       Uh, despite the warnings that mirrors contacted the police detective Charles Buggy of the flying squad and gave the trophy lining and the letter to him, police told mirrors to place an ad and contacted a bank, created a false ransom payment out of bundles of ordinary paper with real money only at the top and the bottom, which replaced in a suitcase to police officers were to act as mirrors, assistance and handing over the money and went to Home Depot. Okay, so mirrors was suffering from an asthma attack. So his wife answered instead and gave the phone to assist it. Mcphee, oh, McPhee Jackson was nervous, but finally agreed to arrange a switch and told fee to come to all you fucking moron. And then he got caught. But it isn't that something. You see that you'll learn something every god Damn Day, don't ya? What a fucking dope.

Speaker 2:          00:59:51       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:59:51       It should have just kept the God damn thing.

Speaker 1:          00:59:54       Then you can't, what are you gonna show your friends? They're going to fucking open their mouths trying to get laid. All right. Um, anyways, documentary about the origin of soccer. Hey Bill, you're talking about the origin of soccer last podcasting, and I want to give you a recommendation to watch wild in the streets. It's the re the origin of all football, including rugby, soccer, and your football. It is lit literally a type of rugby played by an entire town, north versus south. The entire city is the field they play on. Well worth the watch, especially for sports fan. I found it on Amazon fire slash fire TV. Have a good day. All right, I'll try to check that out. Lastly, but not leastly classic movies.

Speaker 1:          01:00:35       Dear Billy dollars. After he talked about La Mons last month, I decided to watch the movie. I really loved it. I never knew I needed to drive through Europe till I saw that movie. I'm 22 and the first thing I noticed was how differently it was pays compared to the schizophrenia stuff I grew up with. It was very calming in a way. I was wondering if you could recommend any good movies from that era. I'm going to keep watching McQueen movies, but I was hoping you could give more titles from the era so I don't burn out.

Speaker 2:          01:01:03       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:01:03       All of, all of his at once. Um, you can't go wrong with Steve McQueen. You can't go wrong with Paul Newman. Um, obviously Paul Newman, you got to, I would watch the hustler.

Speaker 3:          01:01:16       MMM.

Speaker 1:          01:01:37       And for those of you, before you go see the rock movie, go watch the towering inferno. If you watch the towering inferno and then you watch die hard, I think you'll see those two are combined when they sold that movie, this the new rock movie as I feel like it's those two movies combined.

Speaker 3:          01:01:56       MMM.

Speaker 1:          01:01:59       Wow. I haven't thought about movies in a minute. What else did I like from back then I liked all the clinics. Would Spaghetti Westerns, loved Charles Bronson, anything with Lee Marvin and it, uh, the dirty dozen bridge on the river. Kwai Kelly's

Speaker 2:          01:02:20       heroes.

Speaker 1:          01:02:23       MMM. The greatest scape, speaking of which, do you know when I did Steve Burns movie, the character that I'm playing at one point is potting golf balls in his office and somebody connected with the movie was friends with the James Garner estate. Speaking of the greatest scape and the [inaudible] was James Garner, scold potter and I, it was fucking unbelievable. Cause you know, I always watch me TV and the Rockford files is one of my favorite shows of all time. And I love it even more than I did when I was a kid because I never understood

Speaker 2:          01:03:08       like,

Speaker 1:          01:03:09       I think losers too harsh a word, but like how much this guy was struggling in life. He lived in a, on a trailer on the beach. He had the Firebird, he didn't have the money for the trans-am. Okay. And he couldn't sustain a relationship. I mean the guy was a mess. He didn't like to fight. I mean it was just fucking funny as hell.

Speaker 2:          01:03:30       MMM.

Speaker 1:          01:03:33       It's another one that I love, but I am right now I'm just burning through that 77 sunset strip with Efram Zimbalist Jr. I just can't get enough of that show. Um,

Speaker 1:          01:03:45       it's just, it's that classic shit where anytime a woman comes on screen, they play that fucking saxophone music man. It's just fucking hilarious. F from smoking and like every other scene. And I, and his drink is a, he likes an old fashioned ry. And, uh, like back then when they were building a character, like they had, they have their drink and they had to have a car and Efren symbolist his character in 77 sunset strip is, uh, he favors afford thunder bird convertible and he big, and I even wa I've only seen season six, so I think that was in 1963 or 64 Thunderbird convertible. But I went online and I watched the intro to all the different seasons and, um, he seems to have late fifties ones because it ran from like 57 and 63. It was like six seasons or something like that. So it'd be cool if I'm watching it and he gets a new Thunderbird every year convertible. Um, and once again, the restaurant, uh, this office that he's coming out of his Dean Martin's Dino's that old restaurant that he had and, um, which was on la Cienega. It was on sunset boulevard at the corner of last Anegada on the southwest side of the street.
