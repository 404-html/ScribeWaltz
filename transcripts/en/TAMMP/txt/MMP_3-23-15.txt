Speaker 1:          00:00:01       Hey, what's going on? Oh, hey, it's bill burn. It's the Monday morning podcast for Monday, Monday, March 23rd, 2015. How's it going? How are you doing? Hopefully, hopefully you're hearing this thing on time, if not sooner. Last week I, um, I recorded the thing on Sunday. Then of course I brought the wrong fucking why so I couldn't upload it right. And then fucking I do my Thursday one. My Internet just sucks in my, I don't know what's going on, like in my neighborhood. Right. They don't want, you know, when they put those trees up, it looks like a weird looking tree, but she can't really tell unless you look at it and it gives you good internet. All in my neighborhood, they don't want that. We know one kid in a fixed, the Chegg, we did the Winch Cape and your neighborhood. Right? So we don't have one of those.

Speaker 1:          00:00:56       So my internet sucks a big bag of dicks. So what I have to do now, it just keeps getting worse by the week. And, um, I don't know if this is part of some other bullshit, some big conglomerates buying up bandwidth and all this shit where they try to squeeze me down the fucking little porthole. They want me to go down. I don't even know if that's under the same category. That's just some shit that I heard walking by a TV in an airport. All right. So don't hold me to that. Um, all I know is now whenever I do my fucking podcast, what I have to do is I then have to jump in the car after I uploaded and then drive down to a local Starbucks and I got to stand there, you know, eating a Muffin, waiting for the fucking thing to upload. Actually, I'm not, I don't need an I not eating a muffin. Alright. Oh, Billy Gym rat, Huh? Oh, Billy squat face.

Speaker 1:          00:01:54       I'm going to the gym now for fucking two weeks. And um, you know, I fucked up yesterday. A buddy of mine's parents were in town. We went to this Greek restaurant like a fucking horse. And uh, you know, it's just, it's just fucking my age. You just can't do that. You can't deny that negates two days of working out. But uh, I'm still going to the gym. I'm holding steady. I was at, I was one 77.8 starting off at one 84. I dropped seven pounds almost of fucking lot more like six pounds. And uh, I'm not stopping and I'm going to keep saying this because if I don't tell you guys this, you won't hold it to me. Hold with me. You won't hold me to it. I got to get down to a buck 62 the last time. Oh, whatever. Fucking waited. His wife finally have a flat stomach or, you know what I mean? What I've always said, all right, there's standing up flat stomach, there's lying down flat stomach, and then the ultimate shape is sitting down flat stomach, right?

Speaker 1:          00:02:57       The ultimate truth is when you sit down and you look down, that's, that's the fucking shape. Your rent. And I got to tell you, I don't like it. I don't like it at all. So you wouldn't know by my coughing. I haven't had a cigar in a fucking month. And I like it. I think I'm done with them for awhile. I'm going to, I'm a smoke one new years, my birthday and then like that big college game I go to every year and then that's fucking it. You know what I mean? I had this fucking cough for like a few weeks, you know, it was some sort of throat infection, but I mentioned to the guy that I smoked cigars and he took his little fucking mirror and he was looking at the side of my tongue for cancerous lesions that immediately I'm just like, what am I doing? What am I an asshole?

Speaker 1:          00:03:36       What do I get off smoking a cigar? Like I just figured out the fucking economy, you know, like I just, uh, you know, carved a path towards world peace. I have, all I did was come up with more hateful, hurtful, misinterpreted material. That's all I've done. I don't deserve a cigar. Um, so anyways, I've been going to the gym. I've just decided that going to the gym is part of my day. All right. It's not a part of my day that I like, I don't like the gym, you know, you know fucking sign they had on today. Remember that song? Y'All ready for this? Bap, bap, bap, bap. Not a fucker thing. Y'All ready for this? I'm going to start seeing my stupid a dubstep shit. I fucked as it go. Y'All ready for this Dan? Nana, Nan Nan and I can't remember how it goes. It's like it always pleases fucking awful keyboard and then it stops at some, Duke asks you, are Y'all ready for this?

Speaker 1:          00:04:31       You know, we play dad, they played Herbie Hancock. They'll brocket, which you know, I actually appreciate that song, but I mean, I just don't understand why the music has to be so bad. So anyways, I was going to the gym and I'm walking to my car. I'm just muttering like, I don't want to do this. I don't want to do this. I don't want to do this. And it turned into, I don't want to do this. I don't want to do this. I don't want to do this. But the second I do this, it's over. All right, second, I'm done. It's over. That's what I just kept saying. I don't want to do this. I don't want to do this. I don't want to do this. But the second it's done, it's over and I'm fucking walking up the steps to my gym outage and I knew people fucking walking out of the gym too.

Speaker 1:          00:05:11       I'm so jealous of them that they had done, you know, and people coming out of the gym, they were in a good mood. They hold the fucking door for you and shit. Big Smile. Hey Ho. Hey Pete, you work it out on right people fucking dragging ass walking into the gym. They fucking opened. They don't even look back at you. They do everything with slam the fucking door in your face, right. Then you walk up to the counter and he said, little spunky perky little chick day with their fucking pony tails pretending she doesn't realize that she's of dressed like a whore. You know, like something you'd order. You know what I mean? What's with the fucking whore theme here? You know, I can't just show up with the hair like an adult. Okay. This is how much? Eight the gym. I'm actually taking it out on this person and she probably didn't look like that at all, right? I just fucking hate it. And then you go over to the map, you're going to go stretch out. And what happens every time you go over there, some content is fucking and by con male or female has sweated on the fucking map and didn't even wipe it up. And even if they did wipe it up, you see that. You're like, well what the fuck am I laying on here? Right. I should know wore shorts. Gross. So, um,

Speaker 2:          00:06:20       I dunno, but I haven't been in the gym a while, but the gym etiquette, I don't know what the fuck happened. You know the deal, like if you're using a machine, you use it, then you stand up, right? You sort of walk around a little bit in case somebody else wants to use it. I was doing legs today, legs and edge, right? This fucking asshole. I do a set of the things, you know, you're sitting down, you bring your fucking feed up whenever you call those things. And then I go over to do the ones where you're doing the back of your legs. And then I do the squat machine. I'm going back again to the first one. It's called doin a little cycle there, right? One, two, three. The quote was called BDP, right? You got fucking three of them.

Speaker 1:          00:06:54       And I go back to the first one and this is fucking jerk off finishes his set. And then he's just sitting there staring down at his fucking iPhone, you know, and I didn't say anything because the last time that happened, I said to this lady, I said, Hey, can I work in? She's like, oh ha. And then say, I got my earbuds. I'm like, can I work as set in? And she's like, I only have two more. And she just puts it back in. Ah, I wanted to give her a fucking flare chop. Right. Right over the top of her fucking breast assists, which you can't do that. Get through that. Now they're out of the house. They got jobs, they can vote. It's fucking over. Um, there was a time when they weren't even allowed to Jim's. Um,

Speaker 2:          00:07:37       I don't know what he's, I don't understand that person. I don't understand the person that's still uses the fucking stair master. This fucking guy gets on. Right. And you know those people, when they get on the stairmaster and they stand on it, what happens is the fucking thing starts going down to the ground. That's when you supposed to step, step up onto the other one. They let it go all the way down to the brown ground with both legs. And then he'd just go meet me like little step, little step, little step, little step. They're not doing anything. And then they're just fucking like clinging to the top of the machine. Like they have boat capsized and they're waiting. They're waiting for their turn to get yanked into the coast guard chopper. Right. It's just so, and they'll fucking beyond the thing hanging on it for like 20 minutes. And it's like, dude, you didn't do anything

Speaker 1:          00:08:19       other than make your arms go to sleep. Oh I, I'm lashing out everyday everybody cause I fucking can't stand it. I'm so fucking mad at myself that I've gotten myself into this fucking position that I'm going to have to go there for like two and a half months just to, just to be acceptable looking. I'm telling you, dude, you eat your way in and out of the gym, man. I swear to God. Oh, belly fat face did a fucking number, man, the holidays and then that fucking world tour actually did well on the world tour. I was fucking hitting the, uh, that was hitting the gyms. I could just make a huge difference. And then I went to New York and it was just a fucking shit show. You know what I mean? You know, you get drunk. All pizza tastes good when you're drunk, you don't give a fuck. Right. Go to those goddamned Delis, get a bacon, egg and cheese had fucking two in the morning. Oh, that's good, Bill. There you go. We think that's going on right to your fucking man titty. A freckled can't. So I did that for, I dunno. I Dunno. I don't even know how long it started in November, right before Thanksgiving I started, you know, you just start shifting around in your chair and you feel it. Ah, you're putting on a little weight there, Bill. When are you going to do it?

Speaker 3:          00:09:31       Hello? Go the gym or want more. Fritos.

Speaker 1:          00:09:35       I was stuck in it. The sugar, salt addiction and had me when I was writing on F is for family. We have Frito Fridays. We get a big giant bag and these fucking awesome sandwiches. And it was great. It was great until now. Now that I'm on the elliptical, so, um, I actually go into the gym and this is, I actually to get an hour's worth the cardio. If you're a Stephen Adler fan, you can listen to basically, um, I list, I don't know if I already told you this. Well, this is what I do when I have to knock out an hour of cardio. Um, obviously the towel goes over the timer because I don't want to fucking look at it. And I put on civil war, the only track that Steven played drums on in the use your illusion albums. And then I just listened appetite from front to back and I basically look at it this way.

Speaker 1:          00:10:29       He got an hour, right? Break it down to 15 minute quarters like a game civil war into fucking welcome to the jungle. And then somewhere in a, it's so easy. You got your first 15 minutes cause civil wars along fucking song. All right, it's like seven minutes Assam Shit. What we've got here. All right. And then you figure your next three, which are a night train. It's so easy. And Mr Brownstone, that takes you almost up to a half hour and all depends on when you press play, then you're into paradise city. My Michelle to the Games have forward then paradise city, my Michelle and think about you. All right. Then you'll get coming up on 45 minutes. You're in the final fucking stretch. Then all it is is a sweet child. You crazy. Uh, what's the other one? Anything goes and then you'll warm down is a rocket queen and you fucking done.

Speaker 1:          00:11:33       That's all I do and I'm getting sick of that cause I keep fucking doing that every God damn day and um, I'll just have to sweat. You got to have like a classic album that you just like everything wired a fucking wire and the musicians in the band didn't put out some bullshit 40 minute album. They actually put out a good like 50 minutes of music and um, I dunno at that point you're throwing one of the fucking song and you're good to go. My born you with this shit. Well that's how fucking bought am at the God Damn Gym. What's it with these meatheads that walk around the garlic, a gallon of fucking water. Then they never sweating either. They walk around, they got that tape handle on it walking around like a fucking ape. Right.

Speaker 2:          00:12:16       Is that what they're going to drink all day? I don't understand why they're doing that. Although I do appreciate the beautiful Leis and the spin class when I walked by with a little half shirts on, that's kind of Nice. Before I walk into the misery, the fucking gym, no one I'm doing chest that day and there's no fucking way. The Bay, Oh, you know, it was another fucking country move is the guy who uses the bench for the bench press to do like ab work and tricep dips and then he just fucking sits there and this,

Speaker 4:          00:12:46       yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:12:47       everybody goes for the fucking weight bench. Nobody does squats. You know what I mean? Go do your fucking ab work on the squat machine. You can't. Right. All right. That's it. I'm done bitching.

Speaker 4:          00:12:56       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:12:56       All right. And then we'd go, Jesus fucking Christ. Oh, Bill. Why did you do this to yourself?

Speaker 2:          00:13:02       You know, it's funny when you, as I put on weight too, I always go and putting on weight and putting on weight, and then I don't want to get on the scale because I don't want to fucking see what I already know. But if I just get on the scale the second I felt it, I'd feel disgusted halfway down the road instead of being all the way down the fucking road.

Speaker 1:          00:13:18       So anyways, that's it. I'm done. I'm done. Fucking done. Fucking rag and at this point, um,

Speaker 4:          00:13:27       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:13:28       Oh mean that fucking hand sanitizers always out at the fucking gym heads. He's Christ. I'm not a gym guy. I just don't fucking like are they going to want to just file that fucking guy watching Duke uh, San Diego state right now and that oca for whatever his name is. He did that power Saul thing where he dunks the ball, first of all, he's like nine feet tall. So it's like me Dunkin on a nerf hoop and he dunks the ball after a fast break. And, and what does he do after he dunks the ball? He does that stupid Yellen. Yeah.

Speaker 4:          00:13:55       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:13:57       I think you ought to get teed up for that technical foul for being a Douche. What are you doing? Quit acting like you're in fucking brave heart. It just, it drives me up the fight. I don't know.

Speaker 4:          00:14:10       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:14:10       They never did that. When I was a kid, Larry Bird would fucking hit a three pointer to win the game and I though stick his, you know his index finger in the air like, yeah, there you go. Number one. It's over. He just back pedaled down the accordion.

Speaker 4:          00:14:22       Ah, okay.

Speaker 1:          00:14:25       Like he says, you know, half man, half fucking, I dunno. We'll the beast. Is that the right animal? Oh Jesus. This is all the misery of you're listening to a sore old man who realizes he has another two and a half months of fucking work in the gym and he's ready to quit right now and go get himself a cupcake.

Speaker 1:          00:14:53       By the way, I'm going to hand to the Greeks, man, they've got great food, don't they? But I will tell you this, they cannot make a dessert to save their fucking lives. Oh fuck you with the honey. Jesus Christ. Why don't you just take a honeycomb and roll it in flour and throw it at me? It's just, it just tastes like ass. It's like they take wallpaper and they layer it up with honey in the middle of it. That's what fucking Buck Lavaca is a via however the fuck you say everything else though. Outstanding. Maybe that's where I need to live. Maybe I should go move to Greece. I'd never get dessert. Not Cause I don't want it. It's because they don't make a good dessert. And then I would be cutting those calories out. Then I could finish my dinner and after I was done dinner and they'd be like, do you want, do you want dessert? I'd be like, no. When they go, no, no. I don't know when they walk away and go like, I just did something amazing.

Speaker 4:          00:15:44       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:15:44       Does that work for you? Well, I don't give a fuck. It works for me. What's with your attitude this week? Huh? What happened to you? What'd you do this weekend that makes you feel so God damn important? Did you fill out your brackets? Um, so anyways, chases Christ. You know what this is, is I have so much shit I have to fucking do today and uh, and study for my fucking examine the bubble guys. I'm in a bubble. I don't know when I'm taking the test, but a for the helicopter license. But uh, I am in the bubble right now on testing every day that e six B is my fucking bitch right now. It's my bitch. I that thing I fucking couldn't stay in that little stupid computer thing with the God damn wheel. And after a while, once you start figuring out, you really appreciate the genius of whoever it is that came up with that thing. I'll tell you, whoever came up with that thing, if he did it while TV existed, that's one of the smartest human beings that ever lived, you know?

Speaker 4:          00:16:42       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:16:42       I'm going to go out on a limb and I'm going to say a man is the person that came up with that. And the only reason why it wasn't a woman was because of you fill in the blank. You fill in the blank with the excuse.

Speaker 4:          00:16:54       Okay?

Speaker 1:          00:16:54       Because we're not allowed to play with paper during that decade.

Speaker 4:          00:16:59       Okay?

Speaker 1:          00:17:01       This has nothing to do with sexism. This has to do with me. I fucking hate going to the gym. Don't let go into jail. I don't want to do this. I don't want to do this second. I get it done. It's fucking over. Um, anyways, what else? Jesus Christ my Bruins. A fucking rip in my hat out right now, you know. Right when I thought they were putting it back together. We've got the capital's, we got Ottawa, we got big games and we just fucking lose all of them. I haven't even seen the auto a game. I was working that night and I just, I, you know, I followed the Bruins on my phone and I just kept seeing how anytime there's 10 goals in a game as a pretty insane game, I have it on. I have a DV Ad, I'm going to watch it as much as it's going to kill me, but even last night we fucking lost and over time to the fucking, uh, Florida panthers in Ottawa one against and now like, I don't know, I mean

Speaker 2:          00:17:52       Stan exam, but we're like the AC by the skinning skin of our teeth. Um, I dunno. Oh Shit. Were playing Tampa Bay right now or coming up? You got a fucking, Tampa Bay is tough too. Ah, cool. My kindle, we don't, we don't have it this year. I thought we were getting hard. I thought we were going to be right. Bruins face lightning with one point lead for second wild card in the east. Jesus Christ.

Speaker 2:          00:18:23       I still think the winter comes from the West. What do you guys think? Still think that better. Um, speaking of hockey, I was hanging out with Joe Barton, Nick Rosebowl tailgate legend Joe Barton neck and um, he said gun to his head, he was picking the Blackhawks and he said maybe Saint Louis Blues. I don't want to misquote him, but, uh, if you want to hear the best hockey show that I know of a, you got to listen to his, uh, his puck off podcasts, Joe Barton, nick, uh, it's one of my favorites. And even though he'd fucking rip the Bruins apart, I couldn't argue with a lot of what he was saying. But, um, I think this week, rumor has it and he might be going at his own Pittsburgh Penguins, so we'll see what happens with that. But, uh, but anyways, this is the Monday morning podcast.

Well though, I'll tell you, you're going to hide a good 25 pounds of fucking absolute shit with a fucking button down shirt. You know that. Well, that's what I used to say. It was your, you're in sport coach shape, buttoned down, shirt, shape, tee shirts, shape, wifebeater shape, no shirt shape. And then the ultimate is no shirts sitting down in shape. That's right there. That is the deep be in shape pyramid. All right. Now and right now I am somewhere between, I'm like buttoned down, shirt shape. Um, I'll tell you, you really want to discuss yourself,

Speaker 2:          00:26:44       you know, cause you really gotta be disgusted with yourself before you finally work out. I find this is what you should do. Stand shirtless in the mirror, looking at yourself with a pair of dad jeans in suspenders. Okay. And, uh, the level discussed you'll have for yourself, you'll be dragging your ass to the fucking gym. Like I, I am. Um, and I, I apologize for how country and be in this week. Um, anyways, um, I'm heading back east, coming up here in a little bit and um, that's just one. If it's this, it's still snowing in New York. Is it melting or their ice dams? Is the world ending back there?

Speaker 5:          00:27:25       MMM.

Speaker 2:          00:27:28       I have no fucking idea. I hadn't back. They're coming back to as soon. I just gotta hit the gym for the rest of this fucking week and then I'll go to New York next week and everything will be fine and I'll be back there with all the fucking animals that I used to drink with and eat pizza late at night with. And I'm just going to have to fucking somehow plow through that shit. But anyways, you don't want to hear about that shit. Why don't we, why don't we go fucking take a quick look at some, uh, some world news, some quarreled news, some news from the quarreled. Um, yeah, it's always, I never go to a u s uh, new sites. I try to stay away from those fucking things cause I always hear all that shit anyways, if I don't hear it on the news, I hear comedians talking about it. So I like going to fucking Algebra. Xera I like checking out. See what Al's talking about. Son of Ukraine's ex president drowns in a Russian lake. The youngest son of Ukraine's, former president Viktor Yanukovych.

Speaker 2:          00:28:29       You're know fit. What a fucking great name you'll Milkovich Vick. Viktor Yanukovych sounds like a fucking hall of fame. Defensemen. Um, has died after his vehicle, punched through the ice near the Russian Mongolian border. The fuck was he doing all the way over there and associate of the deposed precedent set. I'll depose the guy got booted. What did he do? Did he stick a cigar? And somebody taught on Sun set on Sunday that the 33 year old victor, Ian, you know Kovich who had the same name as his father was driving at the time of his death. Russian authorities have not identified a driver who died on Friday when a mini bus carrying six people smashed on thin ice on Lake Baikal or confirm reports that it was your Nocca bitches son. The five passengers survived. Wait a minute. Are you talking about this guy was driving a bus? How the fuck are you, the son of the president, you're driving a bus carrying six people. He must've been the rebel of the family. You know, it didn't want to follow in his dad's footsteps and fuck this.

Speaker 5:          00:29:35       Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:29:36       I'm going to go drive the fucking hurts shuttle just north of Mongolia. Is that what he did?

Speaker 1:          00:29:43       Jesus Christ. What a fucking way to go. I'll tell you what I will never always amaze me is when fucking Ted Kennedy went into that Damn Lake. You know what I mean? You'd think the weight of his giant head alone. I mean that guy's head is like a, was like a safe, I saw that guy shook his hand one time. Um, it's a long story right after I shook Bill Clinton's hand, I was standing, um,

Speaker 1:          00:30:06       we're standing on the side of the road in Boston and a buddy of mine wanted to go down and see it. He's like, all the presidents coming down, let's go look at the fucking motorcade. Me and this other fucking friend of mine who was a total pothead and we could give a shit. We were bleary eyed. We went down there and uh, Clinton came down the street and he just wanted to see the motorcade. And right as he was coming to drive by us, the motor came dipped down this fucking alley. And then we're looking at a buddy going, yeah, that was great, dude. They fucking made a left turn. And I, we didn't see it and I got Nada and i's going in there and make a speech or probably being there for like an hour. I'm going to go get a slice of pizza. You guys want anything?

Speaker 1:          00:30:43       We were like, Nah, we're good, we're good. So the dude who wants to see the motorcade goes off to go see if get a fucking slice of pizza. Me and the pod had a fucking standing there not giving a shit. All of a sudden the crowd starts going nuts, right? Going fucking crazy. And the secret service guys were behind this police get barricades. Tell everybody, put their hands up, keep your hands up all day and job. We can ship. Keep your hands up. They're like freaking out. And all of a sudden he comes all slick Willie walking up the fucking street high five and people while the, the, the wellies limo is driving slowly along next to him with the fucking door open and walking right behind him was fucking Ted Kennedy. So a I high five Bill Clinton when he was president before Monica Lewinsky. This is his first term, right? Soft hands. Soft like fucking, I dunno what creepy. Soft fucking hands. Little hands. Little soft. Fucking baby grows hands. But he did have long piano flame playing fingers. It was not a good experience. It was getting who I didn't want to be there. Right. And then Ted Kennedy can want to high five him and the sheer size, the sheer mass of the guy's head. I literally went, whoa.

Speaker 1:          00:31:59       You couldn't fucking believe the fact that get that guy, his head was so big, he never should have had a full head of hair just other than this, the sheer like surface area of it that just, even if he had a full head of hair, it's not going to be a full head, but that fucking head.

Speaker 4:          00:32:15       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:32:15       I'll tell you right now. Thank God that guy didn't go bald, man. Jesus Christ, that would have been us. That would have been something to look at. Um, so I shook his fucking hand and Jesus Christ, he just looked like, you know,

Speaker 4:          00:32:27       yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:32:28       I know he was sober at that point, but that guy, that guy lived a fucking, he, I'll tell you know the rough one. You know, fucking lost three of his brothers, the thing that happened to his sister and the whole fuck crazy. And he goes in the lake, he killed somebody. Oh my God. Can you imagine his fucking wife sleeping next to him? How much does that guy talking to sleep? Hi You, I had nothing to do with that. Huh? I came in on the drag. Huh? Jack it down. Get down. Um, yeah, that's brutal. Anyways, so then Bill Clinton jumps in his fucking car. Ted Kennedy jumps in with them and they just fucking take off and everybody's like, no, never just sort of walks away. And then like all of that took maybe like 17 seconds

Speaker 1:          00:33:16       and then everybody was gone and the whole fucking thing was over. It was like, it never happened. And then we turn around and it comes, my buddy coming up the street, biting into a slice of pizza and navigate, he bites in and then he like stopped mid bite and he looks around and he goes, ah, fuck. He's like, did I miss it? He goes, did I miss it? And I go, yeah. And I go, uh, I shook his hand, just watch go. He came walking up the street. I, I shook his head and my buddy goes, no, you didn't. And then he looks over, I look over and there's my pot had friend whose like galloping in a circle and he's just jumping up and down as he's galloping and he's going, okay. I shook it twice. I shook it twice. Ah, you could have seen the look on that dude's face. He was so fucking disappointed. We didn't even tell them about Ted Kennedy.

Speaker 5:          00:34:21       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:34:22       Anyways, so there's that story. There's that story for you.

Speaker 5:          00:34:28       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:34:29       So anyways, baseball season is starting up. I'm wondering what my red sox are going to do this year. They went out and they spent a bunch of fucking money. Yankees haven't spent any money, man, they're in a weird place right now.

Speaker 5:          00:34:40       Um, but

Speaker 1:          00:34:42       I'm excited for baseball this year. I hope it goes the way it did last year. I'd like to see more Baltimore, Tampa, Kansas City, maybe Cleveland,

Speaker 1:          00:34:54       you know, Milwaukee. I liked all those, all those fucking teams. You know what I mean? I like, uh, I like seeing like, you know, I like to see the Padres do something. Somebody different, you know, I like what the Dodgers did last year too, but um, you know, it's Kinda hard to be a fan of a team that goes out and blows, spends all the fucking money. I know it's legal and that type of shit, but it's just the way that they run that league. They should do it more like football, which I hope they're doing. And I hope last year was not like this anomaly. Did I say that right? I lost confidence as I was saying. That's why I went. Anomaly anomaly. Um Oh good, good. All the Guy Clark Kellogg is going to act out a basketball shot. Thank God. Oh, here we go. Yeah, do it. And your wing tips. Now it comes the other guy.

Speaker 2:          00:35:38       Now what you want to do is pivot here. Now you see if you do that, that's called a travel.

Speaker 5:          00:35:44       Okay?

Speaker 1:          00:35:44       Like this. Does anybody learn the game of basketball right here? Like you don't, fuck did I just say the game of basketball? Like a Michael Jordan?

Speaker 5:          00:35:51       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:35:54       Oh Jesus Christ. Why do they do this? Who? The person that came up with this like, you know, let's get half a football field in here and have these old guys get down to there. Three point stance. Hey, low. Well why can't we do that with basketball? That's what I love about hockey. They don't, they can't do it when they go out there with street hockey sticks.

Speaker 5:          00:36:12       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:36:14       It's so dumb. Why do they wear suits too, by the way? They're fucking pro athletes. Okay. Just get them there in their sweat pants and t shirts.

Dear Bill, I'm a 27 year old. Yeah. And I work in a warehouse in Philly. Hey, good for you. I used to work in warehousing.

Speaker 4:          00:41:24       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:41:24       It's one of my favorite fucking jobs I ever had and I always said that if I wasn't going to get older and I wasn't, I wasn't

Speaker 1:          00:41:30       going to turn 30 someday. Um, I would have stayed there forever because it was such a fun fucking job. Whose physical? You got a good workout in. Everybody that worked in the warehouse was either a class clown, a struggling musician, uh, a fucking drug addict. It was, everybody was a character out there and they were all fucking, yeah,

Speaker 2:          00:41:51       hilarious. I loved, I never understood wanting to get into the carpet area and get yourself a little Michael J. Fox, you know, what was that? Sick commies, family ties, dressing up like him with your Goddamn loafers, you know, acting like you're in there making decisions. The decisions have been made for you. You know, you go in, you sit in your little half a fucking office and you and you act accordingly. Um, he says, I, she says I work in a warehouse in Philly and involves some manual labor and I like it. It's just part time. Um, as I'm getting my master's in English, they like, what are you working at a ups that was the big thing back then. $8 an hour to fucking work harder than you'll ever work and your life on loading those trucks fucking thing heavy as 70 boxes and then you have like an entire exhaust system that job's a motherfucker. I'm the guys in the warehouse, so cool. But they always act like I'm going to rat them to HR if I hear them make jokes about women, et cetera. What can I say to end this? Any advice? Um, well, first of all, your cool if you don't mind that they do it.

Speaker 1:          00:43:02       Do you have to understand, um, that's the climate right now is that if you make any sort of any joke, if you say anything about women other than, you know, we'll, I'll tell you it's a damn shame that more women don't, blah, blah, blah. If you say anything about women, the way you say hello to him and he, all they have to do is just say that you're making them uncomfortable. Um, and next thing you know, they're losing their job and then they have this fucking creepy sex thing on their fucking resume, sexual harassment or some shit like that. So, uh, I dunno if I hear them make any jokes about, well, what can I say to end this? Any advice? Um, you know what? I wouldn't get involved in it.

Speaker 4:          00:43:49       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:43:49       I wouldn't get, I don't know why you want to get involved in it. I don't know why you want to open that Pandora's box. No Pun intended. Just stay away from it. All right? Don't, you're going to get them in trouble or worst case scenario, you're going to be one of those people. Oh, I'm totally cool then. And then uh oh well I'm not with that. How could you say that? And then you go, actually yeah, go to HR. And I'm not saying you're one of these women, but you are a woman. So you know what I'm talking about. All right. Talking about the old bait and switch with the hoo ha there. So stay away.

Speaker 1:          00:44:25       Don't go fucking, you know, don't go over there. Bite in the apple. All right. The parameters have been set by a bunch of fucking people. Bitch moaning and complaining and people adhere to those rules. So every one of those guys by you opening the doors saying, guys, I don't care if you fucking talk about women in a derogatory way. You're opening a door for all of them to get fired. So it seems to me that you want to be one of the guys and you want to be cool. So if you want to do that, then just fucking respect the fact that they're respecting you and don't pick at that scab because you're going to get it demond trouble. All right. They go, um, well too. That makes me a god. It makes me wish I was still in my twenties. Again, there was nothing better than that.

Speaker 1:          00:45:16       You worked in the warehouse all day and once a week you played softball against some other fucking warehouse. And at the end of the game, UAVs the best. We used to go to this fucking, uh, you know, a Massachusetts like every other town just has like, you know, they have placed that claims, they have the best bar pizza. So it would almost be like a small pizza that you get at some chain thing. And, um, we had the place where, where I was at, which I'm not going to say the name of, cause I don't want fucking bunch of people going there. So when I go there, I got to stand in line. But, um, we used to go to the original location. It's since changed in, of course people bitched and moaned. Okay Dude, all the original flavors in those old, on your oven. Right. You know, um, it's like, no, it isn't. All your memories are there. Your grandfather took you there and you're sad. So now you can say the pizza doesn't taste as good. They fucking literally moved like 20 fucking minutes down the street. All right, grow up. Not even that. It's like a fucking six minute drive. So anyways, we used to go there afterwards and uh, oh it's the fucking best. You worked all day, you played softball and he just slam like fucking six beers, eat a pizza

Speaker 1:          00:46:28       and then drive home. Cause it was the fucking eighties, you know, drive home buzzed, which was stupid, but you know, and a pass out, wake up and do it all over again.

Speaker 5:          00:46:40       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:46:42       I always enjoy, I enjoy manual labor jobs that are inside. I was, I did not enjoy manual labor outside just because I would get sunburned like a motherfucker. But, um, I did like driving around what people when they will plow a plowing, plowing driveways and going out and shoveling snow. But a, you really fuck up your back. That's how Larry Bird, same thing. Larry Bird blacktop, his parent's driveway. And you know, that little stupid little stick fucking handle thing that's built for a guy my size. He was like six, 10.

Speaker 5:          00:47:15       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:47:15       Bent over at the fucking waste doing that. His back was never the same. But uh, whenever I hear that Shit, I don't know. It makes me happy that I have a job where I don't have to

Speaker 1:          00:47:25       fucking lifted anything. You know, it's funny, I was making fun of Bill Clinton's fucking soft hands. I have soft hands. The only cows is, I have on my hands at this point is from doing pull ups. Oh, Billy soft dance. All right. Uh, repeat television. Hey Bill. I watched TV like every other American and citizen of the world. I watch a lot of Seinfeld and Simpson reruns. I was wondering what shows you wrote shoes, what shows you're a, you're able to watch over and over again. Also what shows could you watch as a kid that were before your time? Oh, what I, that I, I was not mature enough to watch over groundbreaking. Um, last a great question. Let's see what shows can I watch over and over and over again? The Simpsons, you already said them.

Speaker 5:          00:48:17       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:48:20       Let's see. You know what it is, there's not a lot of them because I really got into sports, you know, in my teens. So they were, I used to watch family ties. I would watch, um, I would watch cheers. I tried to watch the Cosby show, but I couldn't stand his wife on the show when she would do that. Stupid joke was she knew we'll clear it's going to do this and then clear the clear. My hated the thing. And then I hated that overly cutesy shit he would do with the kids. Like it was a Jello commercial. And, um, but I did like the show when I would actually give it a fucking chance. I liked the show. Um,

Speaker 1:          00:49:06       but I, I dunno, I just, there was just, they was such a goody goody f it was like the fucking Brady bunch. I just can't get into that shit. You know, it means it's good. He good. He, his family ties was, I at least liked it. Michael J. Fox character was kind of a dick. He was like a Republican, which I thought was different, you know. And that was probably another awful one. I can't remember, I would say, but the shit that I actually go back and watch, um, it's just all shit from my childhood. Um, I like, I'll watch an episode of chips now. I love watching ships whenever it comes on because I live in la now, so I try to guess which highway they're on, what, which one they're filming.

Speaker 4:          00:49:43       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:49:44       Um, which one they're filming on. I'll watch Charlie's angels. I guess that was ahead of my time. I will watch Charlie's angels.

Speaker 5:          00:49:52       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:49:53       Beretta, which was considered really violent swat. The rookies, $6 million man. Um, those were all the show. Happy days. I spoke to one corn ball, one that I watched and then I would watch reruns of the monkeys. I saw every episode of the monkeys, every episode of the Brady Bunch. Uh, and then I watched all the Westerns, bonanza, big valley. What's the one with the, the guy would fucking the rifle man. Stupid son used to always call him Paul. He used to drive me nuts. Fucking do with cry like every fucking three episodes. I couldn't stand him. Batman.

Speaker 4:          00:50:35       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:50:36       Jesus Christ. I've wasted a lot of fucking time, didn't I? Yeah, mostly shit back then. But then in the 90s, I started doing standup in like 1992. So I never even really saw Seinfeld. I just remember hearing about it. By 93, it blew up and everyone was talking about him was on the cover of rolling stone and shit. But I didn't really watch it until it came into reruns because then it came on during a time where I could actually see it. Um, what do I watch now? I watch archer, uh, I watch last man on earth.

Speaker 1:          00:51:16       I Dunno now in the TV watching is different now. So He'd go on Netflix and you're like Binge Watch. Like I still haven't started better call Saul. And I know that, you know, maybe next week when I go on the road I'm going to watch the pilot episode in the second one, I have every other one tape. What happened to me was that show started when I was overseas and I forgot to set my fucking DVF. So, uh, I got to get caught up in that old Joey roses is in it. Joe Doe, Rosa where the SOM Dan and there's something, something. So a lot of people have been asking me, hey bill, are you going to be on better call Saul? And this is what I'll tell you if you guys keep watching. I have a good feeling that eventually, cause it's a prequel, the closer he gets to meet and Walter White at some point I might drop at my character might come back. That's all I know. Okay. I'm not in the writer's room. I have no idea. So, uh, if you could, if you could keep watching it, I'd appreciate it. Listen to me is, I haven't even started. I'm starting this week. All right. That's my promise to you and I'm going to keep,

Speaker 6:          00:52:18       no, I did.

Speaker 2:          00:52:19       Um, all right, thanks. And Go fuck yourself. All right. Camping. Hey Bill, you ever do any serious or casual camping? Is that something you think you could do you, but is that something you think you could Nia into? You mean talk Nia into, um, I've gone on some field trips as a kid and recently with friends and I'm trying to help my girlfriend to go. She's hesitant. I assured her it would be warm weather, camping, that'd be swimming and smores and all that, all that stuff. Thoughts on camping. Um, and whether a chick should just relax for a weekend without a curling iron. Go Fuck Yourself. Uh, always one. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:53:00       Say that. Um, the y camp, no, I respect it.

Speaker 1:          00:53:05       But, um, I think I went camping once. I told this story before I met this chicken at college and she's like, we were going camping and I was like, well, I want to hook up with the ASL. Yeah, I'll go. And, uh, I don't know what happened. I seen all, I'm out there, I'm like, fucking 30. I'm hanging with these college kids. And I was like, what the fuck am I doing out here? We got hammered and nothing ended up happening. And I think I puked in a tent, which means I did puke in a tent, but I'm embarrassed. So even years later, I had to say, I think I puked in a tent.

Speaker 2:          00:53:33       Um, so that's my experience.

Speaker 1:          00:53:40       Um, I don't know. On my bucket list is getting mauled is not on my bucket list, so I'm not into like, I would go camping if I had, uh, a fucking glock in a rifle. I would do that, but I don't like that shit where I'm sleeping in a tent and then a bear comes up and smells my food or something and then looks at the tent and can smell me and not the tent. And me become like a fruit roll up or a burrito. Oh, Billy burrito. And that thing just starts biting my head. Fuck that. Fuck that. Um, but I do respect people that actually go out there and, um,

Speaker 1:          00:54:15       no out of fucking rough it and live off the land. You know what you state of the art tense in your fucking heated socks. But as far as your girlfriend not wanting to go, uh, why maker? Why maker? She's going to be miserable, which is going to make you miserable. Why don't you just have that be the thing that you do that's just separate time from her absence makes the heart grow fonder and then you guys come back together. Why don't you, why don't you just do that instead of trying to, trying to talk her into that shit. And I would never try to talk my wife into that stuff. Uh, I've asked her a couple times and she has no fucking desire on any level. She's a city girl. She does not want to go fucking being a tent. You want to rent a house by a lake, you know, with windows and doors and a fireplace. She's all about it. But you know, as far as like going out there eating beans with a knife out of a fucking can yet. No, she's not into that. All right, let's read the last couple of advertisers here and then we'll wrap up the thing here. Um,
