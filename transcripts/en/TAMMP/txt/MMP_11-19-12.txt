Speaker 1:          00:00:00       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:00:01       Hey, what's going on? It's bill burr and it's the Monday morning podcast from Monday, November 19th, 2012. Uh, what's going on? How I am my, in my apartment in New York City and I think I am as well. Mike as I've ever been. I bought some new device. The one that I, uh, actually Ari Shaffir showed me when I did his skeptic tank podcast and um, I don't know how to shut off the external microphone. So I'm using a microphone. Like I'm fucking Michael Douglas. I got on my headphones, I got two more stereo. Like if you can't fucking hear me this week, if somebody says, Ooh, pool kiss was too quiet. All right, maybe you need to

Speaker 3:          00:00:42       go get miracle ear. Do they still sell that miracle ear? Ketia like fucking grow an ear outside of the body at this point yet they like grow one in a petri dish. There's not what they're working on right now. I mean, if they can grow the outside at this point. Yeah, that was years ago, years ago. They showed that on like the local news right after some old lady. You know who's made jam for the last 70 years just fucking died. Or they usually do that in the end. No, they wouldn't. No, she died. They do it earlier, but if she was still alive, just be like a jab for 70 years while she's still going. Wow. Mike. I bet that was some wonderful jam. The offset was we'll fuck later. Um,

Speaker 3:          00:01:31       anyways, um, if this is too loud, if this is fucked up, it's just going to be this one week. I just got to go find some tech person. I'm probably tomorrow morning. By the time you're listening to this, um, I'm going to be doing the opie and Anthony Show, uh, uh, tomorrow morning and I'm going to talk to dog. Oh, Danny boy, the lights are calling or whatever. I'm going to, no, I really should know the words to that, you know, does anybody know the fucking words to that? You know, doesn't everybody just know, oh, Danny boy. Whoa. Right. That's like knowing the second verse to like, God bless America. No, not that one. It's one of those songs, one of those songs. Everybody's just saying, sings the first, first one of those patriotic songs, and then you never hear the second verse. So now we're, and we're, it looks at the lyrics to the second verse and then when they finally look at it, that's the most sexist, racist shit ever. You know, and then they do something about it on TV. Should we get, uh, the racial slur out of the second verse or is it part of the American fabric? You know, and then everybody on CNBC and Msl the liberal sit there. Go ahead.

Speaker 2:          00:02:43       Definitely have to get rid of it. We should trash white people in the first, first to make up for what, seven second verse. And then everybody on Fox News just

Speaker 3:          00:02:52       goes, you know, I don't see what the problem is. They relate. They say that we're doing each other. I have a red tie on,

Speaker 2:          00:03:00       you know, who watches since who still fucking watches that shit and just thinks that any of those people have a fucking flying, I didn't know what the expression is to have any idea what they're talking about. Do you realize how much is going on in the world and then what are you doing? What are those guys do other than just sit there and just wait for the fucking, the teleprompter thing to come on or the incoming news. They still have that old technology with that thing types forward and backward. It's coming in, you know, incoming news over an England according to this computer that some fucking person wrote into 6,000 fucking miles away. Evidently this happened. I don't believe any of it. I mean I believe it. I believe a lot more of it now that I travel. That's one of the greatest things about traveling.

Speaker 2:          00:03:53       When you actually see big band, you're like, wow, it really exists. This wasn't just meet up. You don't have to like that paranoid thought that maybe your town or maybe like just state, depending on how much you've traveled, like that's all there is and then you'd be just kept going. You would actually run into that, like that fucking atmosphere that you can't like walk through. Do you ever have thoughts about that? Well I have and I'm not going to be, I'm not going to may be made to feel that I'm less than you cause you didn't. Okay. Before you start judging me during this holiday week, what are you guys doing for the holidays? You haven't some Turkey, some fucking beef Jerky, white people with the mashed potatoes, black plague people with the fucking sweet potatoes, right? Jewish people. Do you guys sit with you? Don't sit this one out. You guys set out Christmas. You guys have Chinese food, right? So at least we could do give you that one holiday. Jewish people hook you up in September. You barely even have to work in that fucking month. Thanks to those people. Um, I should have given them a shout out. Shout a late shout out to Jewish people in September. Thank you for those two or three Mondays. I always forget if it's two, three. I know it's one

Speaker 2:          00:05:07       that the month, right? Labor, Labor, Labor Day. I miss this day, flag day and then there's a Horatio Sanz Day. What the fuck is it called? Yom Kippor Yom Kippur. I don't know what it is, but thank you for all those Mondays I've had off or is it a Tuesday? I don't know. I don't, what the fuck is, I don't know what it is, but this might, at least my world. My business shuts the fuck down on those days. And I've never said thanks. So during the week of thanksgiving, thank God, um, I kept getting, giving thanks to Jewish people in those two, three, one seven Mondays that I have off. And uh, you know, there's only fork. Go Fuck Yourself. I'm in September. All right. So anyways, I worked at the germline and center for the performing

Speaker 3:          00:05:58       on Saturday night and uh, had a great time. Paul Versey went up and fucking leveled the place. It fucking asshole. I'm going to lose another opener. Already lost Joe to Rosa. You know, he took off to the, the richer fields of headlining. Right? I can't get that bachelor to open for me anymore. He sees too big of a superstar. But you know, I caught him in the dip, the teenagers sensation, I call him between his, his, um, his initial success when he was a, and I think he first broke on dance fever. I can't remember what. And then when disco was out, he had a rough time and a lot of people don't know this, uh, to Rosa was actually offered John Travolta's part in pulp fiction and he turned it down cause uh, you know, he was still, um, what are we saying? The business Joe was suffering from exhaustion during that period and he had to go away.

Speaker 3:          00:06:55       So whatever. Now he's back to headline and add a, so now first he's opening for me. So I'm like, all right, you know, I can get some miles out of this kid. This fucking assholes killing so hard. They're not doing just the regular clapping in the end of it, they will like whistling the links to the next level of, of, of, of killing. If someone takes the effort to just not sit there and you know, clapping that fucking hammer, they got to actually bring their dirty fingers to their mouth. They probably went to the bathroom. They don't give a shit about the bacteria. Right.

Speaker 4:          00:07:26       Okay.

Speaker 3:          00:07:26       And they actually, what's so for you, when I hear that I, I got, I got maybe another eight months. So if you want to see the legendary tandem of Paul Versey and myself on the road, you better come soon because it's fucking assholes killing. So anyways, we were at, at uh, what does it southern Connecticut University. Did I say it right? I don't know why. Um,

Speaker 2:          00:07:50       it was open to the public. So it was a college Gig, but it wasn't really a college kid. We were actually at the John Lennon and center for the performing arts that was on that campus. And it was mainly, you know, uh, people who had already graduated college, uh, which made me feel comfortable actually means for us. We were both nervous cause you know, he's 10 years younger than I am and I'm actually sitting there going like, okay. And then incoming freshmen was born in 1994. Fuck me, I was already doing comedy two years, two fucking years. What am I going to talk to this person about? You know what, what, what I, I haven't done a college gig in years. I don't know. People say you should do them to keep you at your,

Speaker 3:          00:08:29       yeah. I was actually talking to someone about this the other day, like how you stay relevant as a performer. As you, you can't, once you start selling tickets and you have a fan base, you can't just do those shows. You have to keep going down to the comedy club where it's a 100 people who just showed up that night and could give a flying fuck who you are and whether you're funny or not, and then you can stay current, but if you just get your crowd and you just keep performing to them as you get older, they get older and then one day they start fucking dying or something and then that's it. You're standing out there and this old fucking guy in a wrinkled brown suit. It's terrible. There's fucking business that the back nine is brutal. The back now, he was brutal. That's why I'm fucking, I got to do something.

Speaker 4:          00:09:14       Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:09:14       I got to get my two pistols and learn how to hunt and freeze and elk. Okay. Come see my act. I'll explain the rest of that. But anyways, what was really interesting was this, um, the John and center for the performing arts was, um, a stone's throw from Yale University. No, I've never been there. I've been to have, I've done a show at Princeton Dat myth and I've walked by the one here that's in New York. I forget what it's called, on the way to some lady's apartment back in the day when I was a stud back in the day, way back in the late nineties, when all Billy red face first came to the fucking city,

Speaker 3:          00:10:02       right. Look, and like Richie Cunningham, how I ever got laid back then was just fine. I had to get on a stage and fucking jumped around. I had to, what else was I going to do? Sit there and looking like a fucking puppet. Um, anyways, but I've never, I never been to Yale. I know I drove by, I had no idea where it was at. Every dental he gets in new haven, Connecticut. And, uh, believe me, I've heard some shit about Connecticut. You know what I mean? I definitely have, I know there's a lot of a blue blood money. They're blue blood but blood money and I know that there's a, Oh fuck. You don't have to just reminded me of, I finally figured out a way to work in the so called white man into my act. I was walking my dog. God Damn it. Somebody send me a tweet. Just write the so called white man and let me, I'll just have to think about that way. The fucker would go in. God Damn. And I was going to do it last night. Fuck. Um, anyways, so I've heard a lot of shit about Connecticut.

Speaker 3:          00:11:07       That's, you know, there's a, you know, I'll let JP Morgan money, the blue bloods, the guys, you know who, who like they, their kids haven't worked for fucking generations, haven't worked since like their, their, their initial, uh, since that meeting on Devil's island. They haven't fucking work is some Klan members higher level, no southern accents, you know, pushing the ponds around. I've heard about that. I've heard that there's a mix of patriots and giants fans. And then I heard that there was, uh, some rough areas of high Flynn. I definitely heard that, but I never heard about new haven, so I dunno, I figured it's, it's an ivy league campus. I figure it's got to be cool to walk around or whatever. So anyways, I'm like, you know what, I know that the Yale bulldogs play in an old stadium just like, yeah, I want to go look at it.

Speaker 3:          00:11:58       So I looked it up on Wikipedia and said the Yale Bowl they're claiming is actually the original bowl in this country and that all the other bowls looked at that ball and said, wow, we want to build one to one. That's how you got the Rose Bowl, the fucking cotton bowl and all those other bolts. And that's, and then from that they took the name bowl for the bowl games cause they all played in those fucking stadiums. And then from there the Superbowl took the bull name from that. So it all goes back to this. So I'm like, well, fuck me, I got to go see this thing. So I look on my map.

Speaker 4:          00:12:26       Okay,

Speaker 3:          00:12:27       my little Google maps. I see it's a mile and a half away. I hate going to the fucking gym, right? I had my banana and apple for breakfast. I'll go fucking full of fiber. I'll go take a walk down to the Yale Bowl, go check this motherfuck around. It's a mile and a half away. I'm in an Ivy League, I'm on an Ivy League campus. This, this, how can I go wrong? Right. I got about two blocks in. This is an amazing thing where you suddenly as a white person, realize that you're walking into the hood. There's those subtle signs, you know that make you nervous. First thing you see is a probably a check cashing place. You know what I mean? A funeral home, Baptist church, you know, less white people. You start going fuck. And I'm thinking, well, it's only a mile and a half away. How bad can it fucking get plus this during the day?

Speaker 4:          00:13:17       Okay,

Speaker 3:          00:13:17       do I never had a problem during the day? During the day? The regular people. It's at night right around seven o'clock. I've always said when that second shift comes out, the hustlers, the zombies and all that fucking shit, that's what you don't want to be there. But uh, you know, you might catch a couple of those guys coming home late, you know what I mean? So I'm fucking walking through their Ed a, I've got to admit, I got about six blocks in and I was waiting. I felt like I was in an episode of the wire. Like I was waiting for Omar a hill to come walking by with his fucking gun. It was crazy. I also figured out why black people walk so slow when they were walking down the street. I get it because when you walk slow, you look like you're not nervous. Okay. If you're walking fast like I was, you look like either a, a narc or a fucking victim. He love, he, he's scared.

Speaker 4:          00:14:06       Okay.

Speaker 3:          00:14:06       People just was staring. I don't know, just my fucking red face. I think I'm, I really freaked out a lot of people cause there was nothing, nobody down there that looked like me. So I finally got through all this fucking shit and I get down to the Yale bowl cause I want to look at this thing they get is going to look like the one at [inaudible]. Right. That's basically a rip off of uh, what does that place over there in Italy?

Speaker 4:          00:14:29       Yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:14:30       Yeah. The place where they threw all the Christians to the lions and that fat guy who was balding and he'd do the thumbs up, thumbs down, wasn't punches pilot. He took out the Hippie Julius Caesar. Who the fuck was it? The Roman Colosseum. So I thought it was going to look like that. So I show up to this thing. It's dug into the fucking ground. All I can see as these entrances and that have gates in front of him and above them is just grasp. I couldn't see a fucking thing. So then I had to turn around and I had to walk right back from the hood and I was way less nervous the second time because I knew with each step I was getting closer to my hotel. It's weird how that works. Then I started looking around and people looked a lot more friendlier cause that was a lot less nervous. And you know what? I think that's one to grow on.

Speaker 3:          00:15:19       And you know what's funny is I actually want to go to war, uh, Harvard Yale game in a, at the Yale Bowl. I want to do that because I started thinking about how many future presidents sat in the Yale bowl or at least candidates. You know what I mean? George W. Bush was in there as was that other fucking guy that ran against him in 2004 John Kerry. You know what I mean? They might've done keg stands together. So I just want to look at drunk kids out there and be like, maybe someday that's going to be my guy who was allegedly my leader, you know? Then maybe then the Harvard Yale game, when they're not giving each other shit and throwing their hankies at each other. I can actually hear you know, about the next, the Illuminati meeting. Hey, you know, I'm always bitching about the population problem and how they never fucking bring it up in the presidential campaigns. You know what? I think they bring it up. I think they bring it up on that. That Bilderberg group gets together. I think they talk about the real problems, you know, when they all get together and be like, hi, what is the most, what is the easiest way to get 7 billion down to 500 million? You know what I mean? Is I sit there like fucking lobsters and shit.

Speaker 3:          00:16:32       Then who fucking serves him? I bet that, I bet when you, when you're a waiter for them, when you come walking into that, that group, when you bring in whatever their fucking escargo and all that shit, I bet they all just shut the fuck up the second you come in or they pulled down some different map and if you accidentally see something like that you're never heard from again.

Speaker 4:          00:16:57       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:16:57       Am I slowly losing my mind? I don't fucking know. Anyways, this is the Monday morning podcast everybody. And uh, as you know, as I stated numerous times, um, I've started a podcast network. We're just a mom and pop store at this point. Like I said, eventually we're going to be blogging, putting up video, but it's called all things, comedy.com. And uh, it's sort of a co op like what? I live here in New York, uh, live in here in New York and um,

Speaker 4:          00:17:22       okay.

Speaker 2:          00:17:23       You know, we kind of, it's, you know, by Adis for artists. So we're trying to, we're trying to do, uh, you know what's funny about this whole all things comedy is I was just going to say like, we're going to try and have like this whole hippie commune thing and I just saw this whole thing on Jones town, so hopefully we don't all like fucking drink the Koolaid,

Speaker 3:          00:17:39       but, um, anyways, we've got it to new podcasts. Um, we're adding the naughty room and the, uh, the bone zone, um, which are absolutely fucking, yeah,

Speaker 2:          00:17:51       hilarious podcasts and we'll probably take away listenership from mine, but I'm okay with that. You know what I mean? Fuck, I'm actually, Brendan Walsh is one of my favorite. Uh, can I even say up and coming will probably, cause you guys don't know who he is, but he's been around for awhile. I shot a failed pilot pilot with him a long time ago. We improv'd so this whole, uh, this whole scene to get and just had a great time, you know what I mean? Just to fucking, there's nothing better than when you're with somebody who knows their fucking funny cause then they don't jump all of your shit and then you can relax and he can actually play off each other. It's when you fucking get into scene and there's some content that just tries to fucking box you out.

Speaker 3:          00:18:28       Me, me, me, me, me, me, me. And you start treating it like a lamp. That's when it's not fun. All right. Anyways, so let's get on with this. What the fuck am I going to talk about this week? How, how far into this thing am I, what am I, what am I, what am I, 18 minutes in my fucking hot ass God damn apartment. I told you guys a long time ago when my apartment is so hot and it's not cause I'm in it. Hey, uh,

Speaker 2:          00:18:56       it's because somebody in this building, either their kid got sick or they got sick. I don't know if there's still sick, but evidently, unless it's fucking 90 degrees in here, they're going to get sick again. So everybody in the building has stuff fucking suffer instead of these fucking dickheads just buying a God damn space here. They just cranked it. I saw what is dragging up my floors.

Speaker 3:          00:19:24       I swear to God. I could see I could catch fucking malaria in my apartment. Just disgusting. So anyways,

Speaker 3:          00:19:32       the fuck was I going to talk about, did you guys watch any football this week? Did you watch you watch the Patriots scored 59 fucking points against the colts, but I got to tell you something. How great does Andrew Luck Look? You know, I knew we throw, I know we throw a couple of pics sixes, but whatever. He's a rookie that's going to happen. And he didn't have this, this freaked out look on his face. He threw a pick six things like fuck, you know, like that guys is going to be a, I'm not saying anything you don't already know. And uh, Kudos to the Indianapolis Colts. Huh? Did they play that at the end of Peyton manning? They played that out perfectly. You know, they probably knew we had another two, three years. But what are the odds you're going to, you're going to go from Peyton manning to a guy.

Speaker 3:          00:20:16       He's good. As Andrew Luck. Do you realize how, what a, what a smart move that was. That's like in those cartoons when someone's fallen down the cliff and the phone booth and right before it crashes, they step out. That's basically what they did, you know, in the short run. Yeah, they fucked themselves, I guess. You know, Peyton starting to click with the Broncos. I like the Broncos to possibly go to the Superbowl going out on a fucking Lynn. There is every other team is injured. Um, not really. I'm, I'm joking about going out on a limb, but um, you know, I know it was, what was it, 59 to 24 gives a fuck that kid that kid could throw in that kick in play. And, uh, I really hope the Patriots, I can't even get myself to say this cause it's my quarterback so I won't even say it out loud, but at some point the person with that cute little dimple in his chin, it's not going to be quarterback anymore for the Patriots. And I hope we're lucky enough to go from that jewel guys. Good as Andrew Luck. That is the shit that's, it's very rare that that happens. I would probably say the greatest one that I ever saw was the 40 niners going from Joe Montana to Steve Young. Other than that, uh,

Speaker 3:          00:21:31       not even the dolphins, they went from Bob Greasy to like dawn struck before Dan Marino came in and then Dan Marino, his career ended and then they haven't had anybody, Joey Harrington from the lions will fuck have they had,

Speaker 4:          00:21:48       okay.

Speaker 3:          00:21:49       Chad Pennington from the jets. I always thought that that guy could play and just could never stay healthy. I mean the fucking jets went from Joe Nemeth to nobody. This still waiting for the next Joe Nemeth. That's how amazing it is and how much you fucking freak out when you, when you get the real deal. I guess the Patriots went from drew Bledsoe to Tom Brady, you know, and I know Bledsoe gets a lot of shit, but I mean that guy was a, he was up there, right? He's got the fucking yeah, to prove it.

Speaker 3:          00:22:23       No, it's fights fucking unreal because the cowboys cowboys went Roger Stolle back then they had that long low. Then Troy Aikman came in and now they're in another, they're in like a fucking 20 year. Well now wait, how long did it trade? Mentally he played the like a 2000 maybe. And there's still waiting. Although Tony Romo was not as bad. He's not as bad as people say. Bill, you're going to make any of this fucking funny. You just going to sit here and talk about how you remember quarterbacks I write. I write already. Um, could you hear that? Could you fucking hit up Jesus Christ, another person telling me they lost the house in a storm. Holy fucking shit. All right. There's another thing to give. Thanks for that. That didn't happen to me. God dammit. Um,

Speaker 4:          00:23:12       okay.

Speaker 3:          00:23:13       You know what the great thing about being a comedian is all you can actually do a bunch of benefits and, uh, I've actually gotten some offers out on the west coast to do some, I gotta, I gotta jump on one of those. I got to jump on one of those. But the funding or what the fuck's going on? You don't, you realize I don't even watch the news anymore. I'm just so fed up with it. I don't know if I'm fed up with it or I'm so out of my fucking mind. They can't even relate to it anymore. I just sit there, y'all on TV and that's fucking Paul shared. You know, I don't fucking know. You know, let, let's get, let's get to a, God damn. I'm just get to a fucking, oh, how about a big shout out to the, they're actually thinking

Speaker 2:          00:23:46       about taking a couple of weeks off. It just can't come to a fucking agreement. So they're going to take a couple of weeks off. You know what I'm going to do? I, I've, I'm, I'm done with them. I'm fucking done with them. You know, every sports fan says that and then they get all excited when they come back to fuck them. I'm bi, I'm getting the NBA League pass. I've actually been watching the Celtics for the first time in forever were actually younger and a, I liked the way we're playing. I liked the way we're playing and I like every fucking team in the league, including the neck. Just as long as they beat the Lakers. That's it. I'm old school. I don't give a shit. I don't give a fuck about the heat. There's still an expansion team to me. Oh good for you. With your two little banners, you know, I hope you get some more banners when the air conditioner is turned on and it starts waving. It dries out all the fucking botox around court side. How about that? How do you like that? That's fucking creepy ass town that Miami is, I'll tell you for as much shit.

Speaker 3:          00:24:46       It's Hollywood gets for the old guy with the trophy wife. You've never seen it until you go down to Miami beach and you see these motherfuckers 60 fucking 65 years old, 58 maybe at the youngest with their linen on linen matching outfit and those Brown fucking loafers, no sandals that look like that face mask or that guy in the giants whose just sick of having people poke them in the face. So he basically has a durable cage on his face though. Those kinds of sandals, those rich guys sandals probably made an Evana kind of sandals. Those guys, 65 fucking years old balls hanging down the side of their linen pants inside leg. Of course it's not get disgusting, right? And, and they're sitting there with like some fucking 19 year old.

Speaker 4:          00:25:36       Okay.

Speaker 3:          00:25:36       Was unreal. Just fucking unreal. It's just disgusting, disgusting thing that's going on down there. You know what? They got enough money to cover it up. How was that legal? Once you're of legal age that you can be 58 with a fucking 19 year old climate on a fucking 19 year old, right? She's into all this new music. You don't know. You're sitting there putting on fucking a Glenn Miller Moonlight serenade, anything. What the fuck it is? It's, they feel like they're in the little rascals movie. Extras, disgusting

Speaker 2:          00:26:16       and awesome. All at the same time. Just depending on what side of the ball you're wrong. Let's be honest. So anyways, yeah, I'm becoming a big hoop fan. I actually watched some of the Knicks game today with the Paul Versey. And what about the fucking next seven and one? Go listen to Paul's fucking podcast. He's going to be freaking out about that. Tell you the next kid. Um, he still says kid and Yab. Boy when he fucking text, he's really starting to show his age, but only in this texting. All right, here we go. Some, uh, some questions for the week. Hey Bill, how do I tell my wife I'm an atheist bill. I have the greatest wife in the world and we have two wonderful daughters. This is starting off like a horror movie. You know what I mean? How it's always like nice. There's always like leaves falling in a Gazebo, but there's just that hint of creepy music. I at least to do that back in the 80s, when they couldn't just depend on special effects, they actually had to build suspense. That's how this is looking at this guy. He has a great, here's a great, he has the greatest wife in the world. Everybody, and he has two wonderful daughters. Uh, there's a problem though, Don Don, uh, she is a devout Christian.

Speaker 2:          00:27:27       All right, do you, why are you acting like you just met her, you fucking married her.

Speaker 2:          00:27:31       And he goes and I finally decided that I don't believe in any of it. Oh, that's why. Oh, we'll do welcome to enlightenment. You know, you can't throw it all out the window, but you know, the seven deadly sins, the 10 commandments, all that shit makes sense. But all that other stuff, you know, burning Bush, talking to a bath, it's walking on a fucking lake. I mean, come on. I mean, how are we adults here or what, you know, you have to throw your first baby over a cliff to show that you love me. Hey, I was just fucking with you. You passed to tell what the, what is that?

Speaker 4:          00:28:07       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:28:07       Booming voice coming from the clouds ghetto. I just don't buy it. Something's coming back like for the love of God. What, what, what is it waiting for? You know what I mean? Is Jesus like Thurman Thomas Trying to find his fucking helmet during the Superbowl? Is that, what's that? What's going on here? Um, that's too Thurman Thomas references two weeks in a row you find another fucking podcast that does it. Three weeks in a row of God. It, you should stop listening to this one. Um, anyways, he says, I finally decided that I don't believe in any of it. I thought about telling her the old joke. We're both atheists. I just believe in one less God. Then you do a, but she wouldn't find that funny at all. She is okay. She, she's, she is okay for now going to church without me because I work nights, but I have a feeling that when the kids get a little older that I will have to become more involved. Should I tell her now or just let it be and hope that it never comes up. Well, I have to tell you, sir, if you do in fact have the greatest wife in the world, she'll accept you for who you are. And if you're an atheist and you don't believe in the stuff that she believes in,

Speaker 4:          00:29:23       yeah,

Speaker 2:          00:29:23       then you know, there you go. This is what I would do. Let her, let her take him to church. I Dunno what to do. You don't be funny. What if you took up needlepoint? Okay. And when you went to church, you just did needle point with your legs crossed in the most feminine way possible.

Speaker 3:          00:29:42       Maybe that's the way you do it. Like some passive aggressive way that you so embarrassed, the most wonderful way from the world that she asked you not to come.

Speaker 2:          00:29:51       You know

Speaker 3:          00:29:54       what? If you do like a needle point that just is like little atheistic sayings and you make pillows and when they have like the church drive, like the bake sale and they wash your car, you sell, you sell the pillows that you, so during the mass, Oh, you know what? And they say Jesus is Lord. But it's almost like, like one of those pink Floyd songs that if you, if you play it, I don't know if you listened to some, they got like hidden messages or something or maybe they never did. Maybe just these Jesus freaks did, that's going to really freak them out.

Speaker 2:          00:30:24       Okay.

Speaker 3:          00:30:24       It may have like subtle messages and like the outskirts of the pillow about this is all a bunch of bullshit

Speaker 2:          00:30:32       and uh, you don't believe in pedophilia, you know? Oh Jesus, I'll get me some fucking emails. Okay. Um, anyways, what are the asks? Should I tell her now or just let it be and hope that it never comes up? Um, you're basically saying, should I, should I man up and be who I am or should I stick my head in the sand? Okay. That's that. Those are your two options. So I am going to throw this back at you, sir. What kind of man do you want to be? Do you want to be the kind of man that sticks his head in the fucking sand when there's, there's a confrontation or do you want to be that guy who just sits down and just says, listen sweetheart, I tried. I just don't, I don't believe it. Okay. And I think it's great that you believe it. If you want to go down there and sing the songs, shake some hands, close your eyes, right? Make a pledge for Jesus. Whatever the hell you want to do. You go down there and you do that. All right? It's like watching football. I like doing it. You don't, you don't, you're not into it. You know I don't, I don't make you watch football, do I? I don't do that. You know why? Cause I'm the greatest husband in the world. Why don't you try that?

Speaker 2:          00:31:41       Just ask her. Listen, wait. Does she know,

Speaker 4:          00:31:46       okay.

Speaker 2:          00:31:47       She all right. She knows that you're not going, ah, Jesus. You know what, you might want to give her a little Jesus juice and uh, get a little liquored up. I don't, I don't want to, you know, what do you got? You got to tell her

Speaker 2:          00:32:04       you don't, I don't like how you're deliberately working. I feel like you've deliberately working late on Sundays or early on Sundays. Whenever the hell she goes. So you, so you can just avoid this. You're avoiding ships are, and this is a snowball. All right? A snowball, a Jesus and it's rolling right down towards you. And at some point it's good. It's going to grow all over you. You know? And there's going to be some fucking creep church like that priest on the fucking soprano's that's going to come over and fucking hold your hand when you're out there doing the, yeah, you're a little job there. All right. So I say, you just tell them, just say, I just look, just be, don't be a Douche. Just say I totally respect. I mean I'm fucking around cause they don't make this shift funny. I don't care if you believe in that shit.

Speaker 2:          00:32:43       God bless you. You know, you know what, I hope you're right so you can laugh at me. Um, and we all die. Um, and so it really, I'm going to hell for the rest of my fucked for the rest of my life. You don't think that's a little overkill? I think the Rockefeller laws of fucking bad anyways. Um, yeah, just say, look, I respect that you were under that type of stuff and listen, you know what I do? Who gives a fuck? Somebody took you to church. Somebody took you to church and you after a while realize that you didn't believe in it. So if she wants to take the kids to church, just let her take him to church. But your wife has to be okay with the fact that they, they say gay have them. You don't go down and pray. Do they hippie? You can say, cause I don't believe in that stuff. I don't think it happened. Okay. And a couple of years you'll understand what I mean when I tell you about all saint nick, when they tell you the real story, you know, there you go. Santa Claus for adults every Sunday. All right, Bill, do I go for it? A belly fat face? Uh, love the podcast, but be boo, I need your opinion on something. So like a typical douchebag. I always joke with my wife about having butts, sex.

Speaker 2:          00:34:07       He goes, just because it makes you uncomfortable. Dude. Blood sex is one of the funniest fucking words ever because it's, it's, it's uh, but sex, it's it, it's really fucking, it almost, you know, it's almost a sound effect of you pulling out, but sex, you know, or going in. That's disgusting. I'm so much more disgusting on this thing that I am in my regular pocket. I'm in my regular act, but a yeah, buts, but sex, it's really like blunt force kind of trauma there. Can you hear every time I shift on the couch so fucking well, Mike Tier, um, he goes anyways. The other day she offered to try it. If I quit saying fuck and using the Lord's name in vain for a month. Honestly, I never thought about trying it except in high school with the chick using the anal virgin loophole. Should I go for it? Thanks. And Go fuck yourself. Um, no, no you shouldn't. Okay. And not because I'm some purist and I'm saying you shouldn't bang your wife in the ass. Okay. That's your legal property. You can do with it what you want. Yeah.

Speaker 4:          00:35:24       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:35:24       I'm just fucking with you. No you shouldn't. You know why you shouldn't cause you have to do some sort of fucking parlor trick. Hey, if you jump through these fucking three hoops, you know, then you can have a cookie. Go Fuck Yourself.

Speaker 4:          00:35:39       Okay?

Speaker 2:          00:35:40       Go Fuck Yourself. See, it's too late to say that. You know, if, if you to, if you don't put your shoes on the rug, maybe you can put the pepper. Yeah. You know what?

Speaker 3:          00:35:52       Maybe if you paid for the NFL package, I'll let you ride me about that. Why do they always act like what they have is so much better than what the fuck you have. You know why? Cause we're weaker when like the fat guy who can't resist a cookie and they're sitting over there written fucking salad laughing at us. You know what you need to do, sir? You need to get in control your Dick, you gotta get your fucking Dick and check, okay? This is the one thing for you and for everybody else. Lists every other guy listening to this. Don't ever do a fucking party trick for a sexual favor. Go Fuck Yourself. All right? I'm not a God damn chimp. That's what he got through. Just rub one out. Rub One out, and then you're not going to give a shit.

Speaker 2:          00:36:35       You don't what she should've said if she said it, if the second she said she'll, she'll offer to try it. See right there. All that means is you're not going to say fuck for a month and you're not going to say, God Damn Jesus Christ. It's God Damn fucking Dean, Jesus Christ. It doesn't work. You're not be able to say that for a month, just so you can sit there and for fucking eight eighth of a second, because she goes, Whoa, and then that's it. And then you're going to go g Christ, right? And then she's going to sit there and be like, oh, see you just going to go back to saying that. You know, I thought it was really nice that you didn't say that to like a whole math, right, and now you're fucking in that. You know what it is. It's like you gave, you gave up, you gave up that real estate.

Speaker 2:          00:37:22       Okay. Just like the native Americans, just like the Mexicans. When you lost Texas, you know what you have to do. You know what Mexicans have to do to get that fucking thing back. Do you realize the level of bloodshed that they have to fucking did to ever get that back? Okay. This is the same thing in the fucking, this is the Louisiana purchase right here. You never get it back. If you fucking sit there and act like a goddamn point extra for a month and don't talk like how you normally talk, just so you can just basically a knock on the door of her butthole to have. Right.

Speaker 2:          00:38:01       I love how you have to do the entire thing that she wants. Just so she can attempt to maybe do what you want. See what's you see what happened? All right, now you get a pass on this one, cause this is your first time at the Rodeo. So you missed it this time, but the next time she does some shit like that, I'll use this one as an example. I'll let you do that if you know, if you just try and do not say fuck and use the Lord's name in vain for a month, you don't. You should have said, you should have said, sweetheart, I love you, but fuck that. Okay. And get out of the way that God, MTV and in a weird way, she'd respect your more cheap, respect you more. You know what, dude? You ought to be able to finish your way into that.

Speaker 2:          00:38:50       Fucking move into that, that, that, that act at this point. All right? You gotta be able to talk your way into it. You ought to be able to make her want to do it at this point. All right. Stop looking for the fucking pass interference call. Sit and get the first down. Why don't you fucking earn it? Unlike half the fucking quarterbacks in the league these days. All right. Okay. Sorry. That was tough love. But you needed it. Did she did everything but make you put a fucking red nose on, um, pink boxing gloves. Jesus Christ felt I was watching the boxing match between Adrian Broner and Antonio Demarco and they both have pink gloves. Broner is wearing pink shorts. It's fucking November 18th. I don't know if you were into boxing. Well, the way I try to pronounce their names, you can tell them that. You know what it is. I love boxing, but uh, it's on Saturday nights and I'm always working, so I miss it.

Speaker 4:          00:39:39       MMM.

Speaker 2:          00:39:43       Jimmy Dore, the great Jimmy door. He always orders the fights and he always, you know, once every 10 fights, I'm in town and I'll try and go over there and watch him. He's a big, big fight fan and a phenomenal comic. One of my favorites. All right. Um, he says, I don't know if you're into boxing, but I know that if you watch this match, you would have been furious. I'm not, I, you know, I don't give a shit. I just, it's,

Speaker 2:          00:40:05       I just think, you know, you could just see the writing on the wall with all this pinch shit. Eventually there's going to be a real sports segment or there's going to be a 60 minutes segment. I'm calling it right now, like Paul Versey that there's going to be some big fucking thing about how much goddamn money these corporations made off of, off of um, all this pink stuff that they made off of this horrific disease. You know what I mean? At five hour energy. A portion of the proceeds. Yeah. How, how, how much of a portion, how much of the portion goes to fighting breast cancer and how much goes to you and your fucking yacht? Huh? They had tassels on your fucking shoes. You don't, you don't, I love about that pink. It's just a raising awareness. Why don't you fucking tell us how not to get it. You know, from what I've been reading lately is what you want to do is you want to eat some of the, uh, some of the power foods there. You don't like Kale.

Speaker 3:          00:41:06       Lot of those leafy Greens, Bok Choy and all that type of things. Their fill a fucking nutrients and they actually help repair yourselves before they go all the way over into a cancerous cell. Can you believe I have the fucking balls to talk about something? This medical? Do you realize I'm just sitting here? Then I got three quarters away through that sentence before I actually realized like, wow, I am in way over my fucking head. I don't even own a lab coat.

Speaker 2:          00:41:30       I've just been reading that book, uh, um, eat for life and I got to tell you, dude,

Speaker 2:          00:41:37       I actually unbelieving in this because I've tried. I did the ABS diet. I've done all those fucking diets, the pie protein, low carbs. I've done all of that shit. And every time I was on those, I always had cravings. Like, fuck I miss bread. Fuck, I want ice cream. Fuck. So what they should call those diets, you know? But this thing here, fill it up with Fiba. It's been ridiculous. It's actually easy to do. I have a banana for breakfast. Then I wait like an hour and then I have an apple. Then I'm good to lunch and I sit down and I have a giant fucking salad and it fills me up. I feel great. Throw some beans on there and I'm good. I got to tell you something.

Speaker 2:          00:42:21       You eat like that. You'll never be constipated. Ever eat like a rabbit. You will shit like a horse. Trust me. Trust me. If you see those shows, the one that was at that fucking lady, you are what you eat for your meal in, in a meal out. I was like, what? What are you talking about? I ate three meals a day. You're gonna tell me I'm going to fucking, you know, fucking, uh, at the end of the night, I got a six spot posting up a six. The triple double a fucking shitting. You're telling me that that's going to happen. I'm telling you, if you fucking eat like that, it's gonna happen. It's gonna happen. I don't know. I don't know what the fuck I'm talking about, but uh, I, I have, I've actually for once I'm starting to read up on nutrition and, uh, I don't know, give, give that book a read. Let me know what you think. By the way, there's no advertising on the podcast this week. None whatsoever. I'll tell you why at some point. Um, all right, Bill, how much weight do I need to lose to be fuckable?

Speaker 2:          00:43:20       Oh, Jesus. Uh, all right. Just saying that your Europe decent looks. Here we go. Dear Bill, a big fan of yours. Go Fuck Yourself. That was perfect. Look, compliment and an upper cut. I liked it. He goes, I'm a fat ass. I'm six one and used to weigh 400 pounds as of January, 2010 I've lost weight with little effort on my part and now weigh 337 pounds. Basically, I lost weight by giving up soda, adopting a one animal prob product, meal philosophy, and exercising two to three days a week at the gym. Congratulations, dude. That's awesome. I've got a charge out of that. That's great. You're attorney itself around. Good for you. He goes, I currently work at Satan's asshole Walmart. Uh, I will talk about them in another email. Oh, do buy it by all means. By all means. Hey Al, you people who work with for these giant corporations, if you're seeing some CD shit, by all means send it to me. I'd love to read the stories or if you're actually doing some good shit and you want to bring down my paranoia a little bit, I'll read the good shit too. All did good shit. Fucking Douche. Uh, my with them doesn't allow me to get much exercise and this time a year or so increasing my exercise, Aina possible eight possible till January. This question is for the lovely Nia.

Speaker 2:          00:44:44       Well, she's not here right now and I fucked you guys over last week cause I didn't have time to do, uh, uh, Neil Ogg anyways. Uh, he says, how much, how much weight would I have to lose to be fuckable? I got a John Goodman, Patton Oswald like potato face and want to trash pat and I didn't know you were gonna say that. Um, sorry. Pam, one of the best fucking comics out there. Absolute beast. There we go. Sorry, I don't read these till they read them. My apologies. Here's the link to my Facebook picture with my skinny brother. Let her see her. Remember I am lazy. I want the bare minimum to be fuckable way. I got to go with this one now. Here we are in faith. Jesus Christ. Dude. All right, hang on a second. Let's look at this here. There's your brother. All right. To, how much weight do you have to lose?

Speaker 2:          00:45:39       All right. The first thing you've got to do is get some contacts. All right. Lose those glasses. I like how you're dressed. You got a nice suit on. I would say ya get, you win the game. What'd you say? Three 37 [inaudible] you know I gotta tell you something new, but if you get down to two 75, you get down to two 75. Yeah, you six one two 75 year. You football weight, you'd be fine to 75. You could carry that and then just keep going and get down to like two 30. You'd be good. I'd keep rocking the suits. I'd lose the glasses. Or you know what I would do if you, if you'd like, if you don't like context, get a, uh, get a hipper more, uh, you know, I'm judging Europe. You're fucking souffle kind of glasses. You know those, those, that they were on TV, you could turn it around.

Speaker 2:          00:46:26       You're right there. Dude. You're within 50 fucking pounds. But a, I wouldn't use the holidays as an excuse not to lose weight. Dude. Just, um, you know what? Here's one for you. Get that fucking book. Um, uh, eat to live. Get that book, eat to live. Just read the first hundred pages of it. You'll get the gist of it. And I'm just telling you, you start turning yourself around. You start losing fucking weight without even having to go to the gym. All right? Uh, he said, remember, I am lazy. I want the bare minimum to be fuckable. Dude, you know, something you got going for you as you've got a great sense of humor too. You get down to two 75 all right? And you're funny and you're a warm guy and you wear a suit. I'm telling you it's going to start happening for you. All right? And you send me the fucking email about Walmart and when you start getting late, I want to know what the number was. All right? Okay. Where are we now? How many fucking minutes on 47 minutes. Jesus Christ and coming up short this week. Uh, overrated, underrated, overrated. Making the bed. Throughout my entire life, I've noticed I've not once voluntary, voluntarily made the bed. I see it as a pointless, trivial tasks that makes it serves no other purpose, but to please other people with OCD by giving them a sense of completion. Why spend even more

Speaker 2:          00:47:49       then a minute of my day to fix something? I'm going to mess up in 14 hours anyway. If I did my math correctly, people spend an average of 81 days worth of time making the bed in their life. Kim Kardashians. Marriage lasted shorter than that. What a waste of time. If you, if you're living alone, do cause there's tight. Be any smaller here. If you're living alone, you're, you're made out to believe. Making the bed is unnecessary. Must do thing right next to showering and brushing your teeth. Who am I trying to impress? If nobody else is around, even if people around to see it, what does it matter? It's not like I don't have a clean house. Does making my bed alone really determined my cleanliness to others? What's next? Tying our shoes after taking them off. That's actually a good analogy. Perhaps organizing our trash before throwing it away.

Speaker 2:          00:48:36       It's just ridiculous. You know what? I get a lot of that. But you know something? Coming home to a bed that's making also make you feel good. And also who knows? You go out to Applebees just to go out and get yourself some Mozzarella sticks, right? And all of a sudden you, you'll hook up with some shit. You bring her home. I'm telling you, she's like, what am I doing with this strange guy? Is fucking apartment. Smells may be a little weird. I'm telling you a messed up bed can be a deal breaker. Girls look at a messed up bed, they'd probably think you're fucking just all over everything or banged another broaden there and next thing you know she's got a half a foot out the door, you know. But I, I do see, I do see what you're saying and I don't want to make the bed, but I gotta tell you when I do make the bed, when I do come at night and the bed is made, I, it actually makes me feel good.

Speaker 4:          00:49:20       You know

Speaker 2:          00:49:22       how many times have you lost something in the bed? Is Cell phones under a pillow, right? You lose your shoe horn. Some other fucking thing that nobody uses anymore. Um, youtube, Bam of fans. Oh, I got to see this. I didn't even watch this youtube video of the week.

Speaker 2:          00:49:40       I want to see this. Is it a bunch of hot chicks with that? Great fucking, this video is no longer available due to copyright claim. Ah, fucking crap bar to bar stool sports was going to have that. They're like always on the cutting edge of all this sports stuff that you wanted. I, you know what, I have that guy as a guest way back in the day. Um, so anyways, where the fuck am I going to be coming up 50 minutes and watch me chill somehow kill 50 minutes. Why do I feel like I'm required to give you an hour? You know, wait a minute. You're working as short week. You're only working til Wednesday. Why don't I got to put in a full fucking hour, you know, you know why? Cause I'm a solid fucking guy. I'm not a solid guy and just have a fucking need to be liked. That's what it is. I'm going to be at the, um, at the, uh, the Improv in Bray California. You see if I can get to my fucking website, this, what the hell am I get to my fucking website here.

Speaker 3:          00:51:05       I got more than enough. You know, I was afraid because I retired the Steve jobs bit cause I did it on

Speaker 2:          00:51:09       the uh, night at too many stairs. Did you guys watch that clip that I send you a like a clip of that? Um, did I send a link to that I should say? MMM.

Too many stars just go on youtube search that night at too many starts with the fuck is my stomach door now. Too many stars, uh, Bill Burn. You'll find it on youtube. And, uh, I never, I got to thank Robert Smuggle cause he's,

Speaker 3:          00:51:48       he fought for that sec because there were some people that were nervous cause I was trashed and Steve Jobs and on that network apple advertises, which is a logical, that's one of those corporate decisions that doesn't bother me. I understand that. I'm fucking with their money.

Speaker 2:          00:52:03       But uh,

Speaker 3:          00:52:05       Robert Speigel really stuck up for me on that one flock for this set. So, uh, if you see it and you'll like it, he's the reason why listen to my stomach.

Speaker 2:          00:52:13       If we'll do it and you hear it, come on, I'm to have to break it down really quickly. Um, oh, you know what I'm doing this week.

Speaker 3:          00:52:22       I'm going to my 25 year fucking high school reunion. I to get it down there at the time. Did you hear her? Gramma I'm on my 25 year fucking high school reunion. I haven't been to any of them yet cause I felt like a loser. Um,

Speaker 3:          00:52:39       you know what I mean? So I'm actually gonna go back there with a couple of my old drinking buddies and I'm really looking forward to seeing everybody there. And I'm just hoping that I'm, I'm able to have, uh, you know, I really chose a different road, you know, most of the people obviously that I know, including the guys I'm going with, they got married, they had kids, you know, they got the House with the picket fence, they did that type of shit. And, uh, so I'm just hoping that it's not going to be like, so you're a comedian. Oh, that's awesome. All right. And then everybody's just going to talk about their kids and, and we sitting there with my fucking hands in my pockets, like, yeah. So, ah, you know what? I think I left something in my rented Geo, you know, it's pretty confident. Move on. I'm showing up in a fucking rented economy car. Do you know, I met some Douche one time, this fucking lady and she had gone, she had grown up in my town. I, she was a little bit older and, uh, I met her at one of my shows

Speaker 3:          00:53:38       and she was talking about how she had recently gone to a high school reunion and just was talking about how pathetic everybody in her class was and how, um, she only stayed there for two hours before she left and went back to the Ritz Carlton in downtown Boston before boarding her United flight back to Colorado. I'll never forget that she used all the names of every corporation that she was involved in, the Ritz Carlton in Boston, Boarding night, United Airlines flight, you know, and it was, it was fucked up because as far as I can tell from talking to her, all she didn't life was marry a rich guy.

Speaker 1:          00:54:16       You know,

Speaker 3:          00:54:18       she's sitting there looking down on these fucking people. It's just, you know, United Airlines. I liked how she said that, like it was the fucking conquered going to back to Paris. I don't know. I just hope it's not, I don't think it can be like that. I actually came up with a really cool grade. It was crazy. The grade above me and the grade below me where, uh, they wa everybody might and my high school were, were cool, but they will psychos the grade above me and the grade below me, they just fought like they will fucking maniacs every weekend there was some bench clearing brawl and a party, somebody gets a bottle smashed over the fucking head. That was like lawsuits. There was a dude in the grade above me. You want to talk about party tricks? His thing was he would eat a light bulb and he'd be just sitting there eating it with his gums bleeding and be smiling. It's blood in between his teeth like fucking maniac. Okay, I need combat that. It's fucking nuts. But my grade was mellow. We would just be like, what was cool about my grade was when you know, suburban shit, everyone would end up going drinking in the woods and everybody had their click. And with each year the clicks just sort of started, you know, you know, coming together like a virus, but in a good way. And by the end of it, everybody was kinda hanging out with each other.

Speaker 1:          00:55:43       You know,

Speaker 3:          00:55:45       we go up, we used to go to this play, this industrial park that wasn't not developed yet and we would go down there and there was a bunch of burned out cars back in the day when you could just burn cars for fucking insurance

Speaker 1:          00:55:56       and uh,

Speaker 3:          00:55:59       and nobody would do it. You know, there was no fucking, I don't know, it just seemed that they didn't even investigate it. Yeah. I got a fucking had is 74 pinto. Yeah. I can't believe somebody stole it either. Had, it's unbelievable. Then they give you money. Insurance fraud was really easy back then and that, and the during those days. But anyways, we used to drink down there

Speaker 1:          00:56:21       and uh,

Speaker 3:          00:56:23       that's fine. That's all we would do. We would just, everyone could come down in your cars and you see some of these headlights come in and then everyone will be like, is that a cop is a cop. And there was always the people, the experts recognizing the silhouette of the car and like the, uh, the square headlights back then, it was the, uh, the crown Vic and an 85 crown Vic that had a very unique look to it. And that was an aerodynamic at all and you could just tell and everyone would fucking scro hide the beers. All the bullshit we were drinking. So, uh,

Speaker 2:          00:56:54       I dunno. So I, I haven't gone to any of the, uh, the union said from a feeling like a loser. And then I will say I kind of a paranoia where I so liked everybody in my grade. I didn't want to come back and see somebody's not doing well. I didn't want to see somebody with the fucking gallbladder problem or somebody divorced or just somebody you know, want, I want to remember everybody, the way I remembered them. Everybody in my grade was fucking hilarious. They had that light in there. I know you're there at the end. Their whole fucking lives ahead of them. So, um, I guess that's the thing that I'm the most nervous about. I just want, I want to go back and see like happy people, you know.

Speaker 1:          00:57:31       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:57:31       I don't want to see somebody fucked up their back and now they can't work and their fucking jobs fucking with them. I'm just really hoping that that's going to be, you know, this is the ups and downs in life, but I'm really hoping that that's going to be to a fucking minimum, a minimal, a minimum. You don't have mine nuts. Do you guys, actually, you don't, you guys have any high school reunion stories? I want to hear him. Some good ones, some nightmare ones, uh, and that type of shit just to, you know, keep the podcast rolling here and maybe a different direction at some point. Um, anyways, that's all I got. I could really fucking hang in here for another fucking round and take a couple of concussions that are going to fucking catch up with me later on in life. I don't want to do that. Lead the cops on a, um,

Speaker 1:          00:58:14       okay.

Speaker 2:          00:58:14       A police chase or some fucking thing, whatever. Oh by the way, before we're playing the dirty stinking jets this week, uh, the very quiet jets, I guess somebody was shitting all over the jets this year. I kid shit on the jets. They've had so many fucking injuries. I think it's actually amazing that they're a, the [inaudible] six and a, what's his face? Rex Ryan hasn't been talking shit and there's something funny about seeing him and uh, that guy there raw Tony Serono with his witness protection hat and glasses. I know his ice got something going on with the Zionist. Why are you going to wear, this is just something funny about them. I was watching the game today before we switched over to the next and I saw the two of them standing there like high fiving and hugging each other after a touchdown. And I just started laughing. I said, diversity.

Speaker 2:          00:58:58       I go, they look like two fucking guys who were just about ready to walk into a casino. You know, those guys that walk into a casino still haven't learned the lesson that they're going to lose. They come in like rubbing their hands like they got a system. That's what they look like. They looked like two guys. They weren't like a buddy movie and you'd fucking roof for himself. Uh, I dunno. I Dunno. I've kind of lost my heat when someone's not talking shit anymore. I don't give a fuck. Is that weird? I Dunno. Go Fuck Yourself. So that's a podcast for this week. Okay. Um, Nhl, I'm sorry, I waited to damn near December. I need another sport, um, to offset when football's not on. So I don't know what to tell you. I'm getting the League pass. Um, I don't think you should take two weeks off.

Speaker 2:          00:59:45       And you know what people out there who blaming the players. It's not the player's fault. This is a lockout. This is the owners. The owners are basically saying that we don't agree with what we agreed with two already a couple of years earlier. That's such a fucking, like, it's such a, it's so, so what the self, the players really don't have an agreement unless the agreement totally works out for the owners. That, is that what it is? You know what I mean? This is what the NFL owners did last year. Oh wait a minute, that agreement that we agreed to, we don't agree with anymore. So we're taking our stadiums and going home and unless you agree to our fucking demands, I dunno, I side with the players on this one and I really hope that they uh, that they could work it out cause I'm, I miss it. I was watching this thing on Hbo.

Speaker 2:          01:00:31       They were running this thing on the uh, I know this is fucked up cause I keep leaning back and coming forward to help this as a mess with the recording too much. But I um, I watched this thing on the broad street bullies and a, I have a love hate even though it was before my time. I have a love hate for that whole, that whole fucking team just because I always loved the fighting cause that's what was going on when I got into hockey. But it also, you know, that style of play really set the game back for a long, long fucking time to, to the point that people to this day when they criticized hockey and when you listen to them talk about it, you would think it was the mid seventies, early eighties. Like they don't even fucking watch it. And uh, I dunno. Do you ever see that whole thing about when the Russians came over here to play the NHL?

Speaker 2:          01:01:21       He basically, I guess it would plan for exhibition games and everybody knew that they were the shit. It's Canada's game and uh, you know, the Cold War was in full effect and it was basically like, um, we wanted to beat these guys. You know, it was like saying that capitalism was right and communism was wrong. So the Russians came in and played three top teams and beat all of them. So it was down to the flyers to beat them and the flyers, to their credit, that coach actually came up with the system, which seemed like the lock of the trap and they just fucking, they slowed them down and the Russians couldn't figure it out. And once they had that goal and they started playing flyer hockey, which is why I really feel where they made their fucking mistake, they shouldn't have done that. They should've just beat him straight up.

Speaker 2:          01:02:08       But basically they started throwing elbows to the face is slash and Adam and doing all this type of ship. And the final one was some fucking guy in the fly escapes out of the penalty box and just fucking elbows. This guy right in the face and the guy goes down and it's not that he did it, it was that there was no call. So then the Russian guy calls his players off the ice and says, all right, fuck it. That's it. We're going home. And I then they will show him the flyers and the guys going, so you quit, you take your players off the ice, like this guy a posting. It's like now he's not a pussy. Okay. It's like we fucking played you straight up and we beat you three fucking times in a row. We're better than you. Even if you win tonight.

Speaker 2:          01:02:53       We won three out of four and we proved that we were, we were better during that time. The Russian team was fucking better. So the only way you can fucking beat him is to basically cheat in play dirty. I think it was fucked up, but, but the Russians came back out and they ended up losing them. Uh, I dunno, I don't want to be on American here, but I gotta side with the Russians on that one. I think it was fucked up. So I imagine I'm going to hear from a bunch of fucking angry flyer fans, but I've never liked that shit. I've never liked it. I don't mind a goon fight and the fucking goon, but I never liked that shit in hockey where it was just like, all right, let's do some all Samuelson shit. I'm not as good as you. Uh, maybe I'll just jump on your fucking knee.

Speaker 2:          01:03:34       And then for some reason they then they do that day happy a halo, but it moves on your thing. Who Love Them. I never got into that, but I think it's bullshit. But I do respect of the, the flyers to a certain extent and their fan base. But I, I thought that that one was fucked up. He should have, he had the game plan. You can, she should have just beat him straight up. All right. I had to put that one to bed. I already give you my opinion on a fucking game that happened 37 fucking years ago. All right. That's the podcast I would that I went over an hour during the holiday week. Sticks it everybody have a wonderful thanksgiving. Uh, you know, try to get along with your relatives. Don't take the bait, okay? You can't change the past. You can't change them. All right? All you can do is change the future by, uh, by what you create. Okay? So they, you'd go, man, that's the most hippie thing I've ever fucking said. And trying to be a little more positive. All right, that's it. Go fuck yourselves. I'll talk to you next week.
