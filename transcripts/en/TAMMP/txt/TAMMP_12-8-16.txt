Speaker 1:          00:00:00       Dunes, Amazon, Amazon, and then, um, they're going to do something with a Promo Code. If you put promo called Baron, you got it for five bucks on my website. Do I, do I have that? You want me to just say what is that thing? The whole fucking thing. Just a little bit. Okay. Jesus Christ. All right, we're ready to go. Alright. Hey, what's going on? It's bill bird is time for the Thursday afternoon. Just before Friday. Monday morning podcast. Dan, just checking in on. Yeah, just checking in on. You probably think of what Jesus, Bill, you went a little fast on that one. You usually fucking stretch it out a little bit longer. What, do you have a special guest in the studio or something? Why? Yes, yes I do. I have, uh, the Great Jim Florentine in studio here who has a, a new stand up special coming out that will be available on iTunes and Amazon called a simple man, ladies and gentlemen, New Jersey Zone, Jim Florentine and filmed the New Jersey of course, and filmed in New Jersey. So how does the, the, the, uh, the royalty of New Jersey, it's got to go Bruce Springsteen, Jon Bon Jovi, Jim Florentine, maybe Artie Lange, no, rich boss, rich foss.

Speaker 1:          00:01:14       How did I forget rich? The Duke of fucking Trenton, whatever the hell he lives. South Plainfield I heard is that he had put out a CD I heard was fucking great. Yeah. And he's the guys pumping them out like a maniac. I think that's a great thing. And uh, I love that you put it on Amazon and I think the more specialists in more areas so nobody gets too much power, if you know what I mean. There absolutely. That's got a good deal somewhere and he's like, fuck you, you're not owning it, you know, and all that stuff. So I liked the new model that's coming out and basically to own your stuff, you don't, that's what I'm hearing through the music industry. Like if you own Spotify and all those other streaming sites, basically enough to pay some big royalties coming soon in like two, three years, just like satellite radio before they weren't paying shit.

Speaker 1:          00:01:57       They putting all the comedy bits won't get a dime. Then all of a sudden when they merged, the governments are, well, you have to start paying royalties. They passed along to the consumer and now you get nice checks from sound exchange through because of the satellite radio, Internet, radio, and now the streaming sites to Spotify is, all of those are gonna have to start paying it about two years. So if you own your shit fucking time, I know. So if you own your master, if you own the master and then you also do, you know, you're a performer, you get double checks. I swear I saw a thing one time, uh, there was, what was that, that documentary and that heavy metal band that just, they came to la like the week before Nirvana's album came out. Uh, nevermind that just, you know, as, as, as the, the, the, the, the legend goes, that was the album that destroyed the whole thing rather than 50,000 bands.

Speaker 1:          00:02:40       I'll sing the same fucking song. Um, so that failed. And then they moved back to like Indiana or wherever the fuck they were from. And hair metal still survived another three years. Then they tried to get into grunge and all this shit. And then they were just old and they never really made it. And they made this documentary in at one point towards the end, the, the biggest lesson in all of it. One of the, the, um, the members said, he goes, what I've learned, he goes, your better to have 100% ownership and just sell 20,000 copies, then you are to have no ownership and sell like 20 million copies, you'll actually make more money if you own it. That's how bad they are. They fucking rip you off. They just, they, they rip, you know, they've, you know, all of that shit all the way back to the blues guys and all that, you know, every fucking artists, they just, they, uh, that's what, that's what happens.

Speaker 1:          00:03:30       So, and then also, yeah. And also like those eighties videos with the, you know the go feed with the hot chick in it and they were, you know, dance around on stage and doing whatever those videos will like a half million to $1 million to budgets on those. So that came right off the top of any money they sold. Oh yeah. The record company put that money up. So just to make a go. And it was the same video as the guys performing onstage and it was a hot check and he starts out in black and white, black. And so when the rest of the band kicks in and all of a sudden it was in color, it was the ballot, they look tired. You know it was Bon Jovi on the boss. He looked tired cause he was looking at the window and drive and know who is the first w Bon Jovi cause you do also do that metal show.

Speaker 1:          00:04:09       So that was [inaudible] 86 when that album came out, a video was maybe 87 somewhere around there. I think New Jersey was his big record came out like 84 85 bond at. That's slippery when wet. How old was slippery when wet was probably, I think 84 now. That was like 85 86 okay. Yeah, somewhere around there. And then New Jersey came out after it up. Slippery when wet as you give love a bad name. Yeah. Wanted dead or alive. All of that shit. They start the, I'm tired on the tour bus journey. Did member journey with uh, Steve Perry had that bad mustache and faithfully oh yeah. Yeah. Remember he had the mustache? Yeah. That, so that was, that started the original tire. I'm tired. I'm on tour and I'm exhausted. What about when he was at that San Francisco giant game? They started playing the journey song and all he had to do was smile and wave and then he acted like somebody, he acted like someone who is just a fan of the band rather than the guy singing it.

Speaker 1:          00:05:04       And he just, he just went over the fucking top with it. And it was, I just felt like it was a moment that, I don't know if he's not selling tickets or whatever. It's like he should just played that cool. And he tried to be too regular and then everybody just eviscerated him on the fucking Internet. Did you ever see that? Yeah. Oh yeah. Cause I've seen him at giant. I'm a big giant fan, so I'll go out there and I've seen him a game. So he goes to like every game when his kids, he can't hit those notes anymore, so he knows I'm just laying low. Let the Asian guy take over and do it. You know, he's just collecting the royalties off of go. Yeah. So he doesn't need to do any of that stuff. He doesn't care. Yeah, he, he's, he could have been back in journey 10 years ago, but he's just like, I come on, I'm not going to barass myself. That's a smart move. So I'll just do it once at a baseball game. Yeah. Like, yeah, like Robert Plant, Robert Plant knows he ain't, ain't, no he hasn't. He knows he's not going to hit those notes. You don't have to tune down to la. He sounded great in 2007 I know he sounded amazing. You know what they got offered $14 million for two two hour shows a thing in the desert. What was the thing? If you

Speaker 2:          00:05:58       like a couple months ago, you've got 14 million for two two hour shows and Robert Plant started to everybody else's app when it's like of course, and he said no. Yeah, I think he bought a bunch of apartment buildings is what he did. So he's making all this fucking money. That's what I heard. Yeah. I heard he's a really good businessman, but why can't he just come out and go, look, this isn't going to be like 1976 I'm not going to be able to hit all the notes, but I'm going to go hang on. My friends were going to jam, have a good time and don't expect much Elijah if you've thrown, I have to be honest with you. I think he's protecting the legacy of the band by not doing it. I mean, I think they did that last one. I don't think. I don't think they could do it better than they did it in oh seven.

Speaker 2:          00:06:36       And he's always said, if you, if you're just, you know, if this is just a money grab Ben there, done that. What did he say? I'm just an old hippie, blah blah blah. Like he just doesn't see the reason to do it. Now what I would do if I was, the rest of them I'd get, I'd get, uh, Jason Bonham on drums, John Paul Jones and Jimmy page and I would do a journey did and who gives a fuck while they tried to do that after too, you know, first of all, Jay page and plant don't get along at all. Like when they were rehearsing for that 2007 show, which Jason, I'm told to show, told the story on that metal show when it was on, they were at each other's throats, page and plant. They just don't like each other. I think it's more a plant, you know.

Speaker 2:          00:07:13       So after that they were hoping they were going to do a reunion and plants said once again, nope, I'm not doing what it. So they actually audition Steven Tyler, Sammy Hagar. That's right. And Myles Kennedy had the Gig Miles's from all to bridge and slash or solos thing, and he had the Gig and they were ready to deal with it. And then they just said, you know what? We can't, we, let's just put it to the side. We can't do that. We're not going to sell us as led. Zepplin oh my God. So it was called, but Myles Kennedy out of nowhere, it got that Gig. But it did, uh, Steven Tyler, my hearing.

Speaker 3:          00:07:41       Then in my headphones, I'll see la, should we be concerned about the alarm? Is it a fire? I'll run out there. And how do you know what it is? Oh, oh, oh.

Speaker 2:          00:07:57       One of these times it's going to be an actual, it's like when you were in, when you're in a club and you hit, hit it on a hot chick and you hear the alarm go. He's like, I don't give a shit. I ain't leaving by Labor. Does nine guys read it? Everybody to take my spot. So I don't know if there's a fire up one of those nine just pulled it to absolutely to get me away from her. So I understand plants thing where he doesn't want to do it. He's like I'm not, I don't want to do it from the guys probably worth 300 million so he doesn't need to do at this point. You just wish it was a fan? Maybe just a few shows. Yeah, cause you know what I like when, when, when Jason played in 2007 I thought he was finally himself where he was like, he didn't feel like he had to do what his dad did, but he, he, he was thrown in the teeth through in so much shit.

Speaker 2:          00:08:41       A lot of it was some stuff that his dad did live, but like he, his personality was on it. I thought he really fucking owned it on that one. So I was kind of psyched to see them go around. It's probably better. It's probably better that they don't do it because you know it didn't work well. I remember that live aid when they had the two fucking drummers and shit. And that was only five years after they had played. But I heard Paige was so fucking upset that he didn't play guitar for a while after bond died. Like to the point he had to tried to record, remember how to fucking play. Um, that's right. Cause then the story was um, Paul Rogers came over one day and was just hanging like three, four years later and said, hey dude, you can pick up their guitar.

Speaker 2:          00:09:16       Let's see if we can write some songs. And they started the firm after that. Yeah. So why doesn't he just fucking, why don't you just come up with a new name and just still do Zeplin shit plays some firms stuff. That fucking Jimmy page product project with John Paul Jones and fucking, I know what Jason, well member when memoir now page was so pissed off at uh, at Robert Plant that had got David Coverdale and did the Coverdell page. They did one album cause governor Chris Robinson, they went out with him. Yeah. Robert Plant hated David Coverdale cause he thought he was a led Zeppelin, you know, just so Robert Plant clone, he looked like him. Sounded like, um, and then pages. So I'm going to get your arch enemy and we're going to start her own band. What do you think of that? Well yeah, I think that'll do a lot of damage, but yeah, it did.

Speaker 2:          00:09:54       It definitely didn't help the guy 10 years younger. They can still hit the fucking notes. Well van Halen pulled it off cause remember Sammy and Dave did that toward a Sammy Hagar, David Lee Roth tore together. They hated each other cause of Van Halen weren't talking to either. And then right after that tour it, I got back with Sammy. So I guess Fannie Allen's like, what are they? They're selling out arenas. We should be doing this. And they put Sammy back in the van Sammie's back in the van now? No, no, this is a while ago. But Sammy and Dave cause to van Halen brothers would just blowing them off. They go, okay, let's the two old singers of Van Halen and let's do a tour together. And they do a tour and they hated each other, that whole tour because Sammy and Dave hated each other. They hated each other since day one, but they just did it for the tour and they were supposed to like rotate headline in every night and Sam was trying to blow them off the stage and, and Dave was, and it was all the egos and all this shit. So I would think Sammy would win though. Did he win? Probably, but Dave was still a voice of Van Halen. I'd rather hear you know, and love again. And you know, Main Street then is this love?

Speaker 1:          00:10:51       Yeah. I always thought Sammy Hagar, you, when you look at his, I was just talking about this in my last podcast. Um, this is such like fucking white guys in their forties talking. Um, I always thought he shouldn't had fucking joined the band. There was no upside where it was like, you're not going to follow Dave. You're not going to be like, uh, you just, it's just one of those things like, why would you, why would you go there? It was like Steve Young going, I have to fucking Joe Montana, no matter what the fuck he did, he was always going to be not Joe Montana. And even though he y one, one a get the monkey off my back or whatever, I thought he should have just stayed with his own fucking band. Man. That guy was incredible for live and all that. I liked the direction of his solo shit before that is this love. And they're the keyboards and they were all walking around in the fucking flesh colored, uh, flashdance suits, whatever the hell they were wearing.

Speaker 2:          00:11:42       Yeah. Um, you know, he um, he had a great solo career before joining. I know we really didn't have to, I don't think he really thought it was going to take off. I don't know what I just said. Let's start, start jamming. And then by van actually got bigger

Speaker 1:          00:11:54       at that point they sold more records, which Sammy, but that was the MTV days, more like Dave was like the last of the, you know, Panama and jump and stuff like that. But then when van Halen, like 86 is when they put their first one, I would, would a Sammy there had all the videos and stuff like that so that I sold a lot more records. And Dave, all right, let's, let's try to bring this back into like this century. I want to do something fucking hilarious. It hit me the other night. So a buddy of mine passed away, right? We're at that age, people fucking die. And uh, so we, we did a, uh, a benefit for them. So I got all these fucking comics together. There was a guy I did stand up with from 90 to 99. This Guy Pete come and just a great guy. And then he became a writer and did all these wonderful things and unfortunately had a heart attack and died.

Speaker 1:          00:12:37       So I got all of his buddies from fucking back in the day, you know, like Austin, Boston, guys like, you know, some guys who are like not doing standup really anymore. And we all fucking came out was hilarious. We're all standing around fucking dad jeans and bad hairlines and shit. And I'm looking around going like, wow man, we have fucking old before the show us just like Jesus Christ. This crowd looks kind of young. I hope this is going to go out right in the fucking, it went perfect. Perfect night. Uh, except for one fucking dude, but he was on some medication and he was drinking bud lights. He repeated a couple of jokes. It was fucking hilarious. He, he had, he had one guy at a tough set. So I was on stage and um, I've, I was making fun of fat actresses complaining and Shit.

Speaker 1:          00:13:18       And then I was just going to be, look at me, I'm fucking among bald, redheaded male. You don't think there's a glass ceiling on the parts I can get out here and shit like that. Right. So at the end of my set, I'm doing the meet and greet and this guy came up to me, didn't even want to like picture or anything. He had one of those before and after fucking hair club for men cards, I guess he did it. He goes, dude, he goes, I could get you your hair back if you want it. And it was the club that the guy was like bald like me and then had like the fucking, oh, really? I was just like, I said to too. I'm like, no man, I'm good. And he kept fucking showed it to me. I, if I was just like, dude, I like, I go, I liked the way I look.

Speaker 1:          00:13:51       I don't need that wavy shit. Right. And he just fucking put his head down. He walked out like a scolded child. I felt like a fucking asshole. They, I don't need that fucking well, what you, at some point you're like, yeah, thanks man, but I'm good. You know, like you, you give them that, but then when they keep pounding away, well, it's one of those six dude, I had hair at one point in time. I saw it. It got me okay. I think I always said if I was going to be the next Brad Pitt, it would've happened before. Like I had to wait till you were 48 Oh, if you only had fucking hair. It's like, no dude, it's, it's, it's a wrap. Yeah. And then you can't put it on now. Everybody knows. You know, you had to do it in that transition stage where you were losing a little, but, and I was like, did he do something with his hair?

Speaker 1:          00:14:26       You can't do this. So many guys, there was so many guys hanging off the fucking ledge and all of a sudden pulled themselves back up like this. So many fucking guys. I just, I never, uh, I just didn't give a shit like this, this certain point of like, you just gotta you know, just, you just play the hand you're dealt, you're going to look way fucking better. Although some people that I know, they got some really good ones, but, um, I just don't, I don't know. I, I don't get, dude, I wouldn't even do that laser eye surgery. Yeah, I won't do that either. I'm waiting til like 100%. You're fine. Yeah, exactly. There's a couple cases of guys foggy and he can't see, and, and then they say, if you're over fucking 45, it only lasts for this amount of years. And then what?

Speaker 1:          00:15:07       You're going to do it again? Fuck that. I know when they're operating on your eyes. Yeah. Fuck it. Fucking sitting there looking at it as it doing it that that's too much. So, but you did the right thing with that guy, you said, Nah, I'm good. And then he kept pounding away. Some guy wanted it laughed. I thought it was right. It was fucking hilarious. And then when you say, dude, I'm good, I'm good, I'm good. Walked away. I was just like, dude, I don't need that wavy shit because it's always the guy with the wavy fucking hair. It's never anybody with like looking like those guys and that was it. Always this, they never have that Beatles hair cut. It's always the fucking wavy. It was just like, yeah dude, I'm good. And then just kind of put his, that had happened to me.

Speaker 1:          00:15:41       Some guy wanted me to do it on Ohio thing like this Ohio state. I'm not a big college football fan when I do all age. Ah, yeah, yeah. I was doing a Gig and he's like, dude, my friend's going to snapchat this. Can you do this with me? I go, no. Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. I'll go, first of all, you're on fucking snapchat and you're, you're like 40 years old. You shouldn't be on snapchat. And second like, I'm not doing that. That's fucking corny. He's like, come on man. I go, no, I'm not. I'm not doing it. I'll take a picture with you. I'll do whatever, but I'm not the one all h I all know it gets weird with that shit. Like there was someone in the line last night, like I had like eight people back and he's facetimeing with his friend and he's got his friend's head pointing at me.

Speaker 1:          00:16:16       I'm like, I'm looking at this person from like 30 yards away on the phone looking at me and I just kept yelling to the guy, just go and sorry, I'm not going to talk to that guy fucking phone on. And he wasn't listening to it. I was like, can you tell that psycho back there with his friend on the phone? I am not. I'm not. It's bad enough when somebody just hands you a fucking phone. Hey, can you say hello to my fainted fucking, you know what I started doing? I just, I just did. I just channeled Patrice. I would just start hanging up on them. I just go right. Just hang it up. I had a relative of mine will kept doing it go. He used to, I used to call it, he's calling, you know, it's one of these guys I've talked to like once or twice a year.

Speaker 1:          00:16:51       Hey Bill, how you doing? Blah Blah. Hey, you know what I mean? Are you home telling you remember someone selling? He would just hand the phone to them and the person on the other end, it didn't want to talk to me either. Right. And it was just the worst fucking thing. So I would go, I don't do that. Don't do it without any, would hand it to me and the, hey. And then I just finally, I just started fucking hanging up and it just stopped it and he would, he got so fucking mad at me. It was just like, dude, I'm asking you not to fucking do this and you're still doing it. You're leaving me no choice here. And then he tried it. Oh, what do you think you too. You too good for that. Yeah, you are too. Everybody's too good for them. I want to talk to a complete fucking stranger who doesn't want to talk to you on a phone.

Speaker 1:          00:17:28       People used to do it to me like, hey, say hello, my friend. I'm like, Hey, how you doing? This isn't Jim Florence and I'm a yeah, it is. He goes, what are you doing in St Louis? Like I'm doing a Gig. There's no way. There's no way you were saying. I'm like, all right. I go, I'm not going to argue with you here. Take the phone to phone back. I'm not arguing with and go to my website. I'm at the fucking funny ball and whatever gives a shit. No, it never, uh, it never fucking ends well, but um, anyways, how's your, uh, I know your team. Don't tell me the dolphins had just went to the Dolphin Raven game last week in Baltimore. They got their ass kicked to have ravens are always tough, man. They did. The dolphins never played good against physical teams. Never. They just didn't, not a physical team, you know, and it can push it around.

Speaker 1:          00:18:09       They got that in Dhamaka soother. Yeah, he's good because he gets double and triple team. Then other guys can get sacks, but I just, they're just not a good physical team. They just, uh, you know, Tana Hill, they had some guys out in the offensive line, disliked. They're seven and five, so I can't complain. I didn't think that back. Good. Yeah. This new coach, I think he's pretty good. What are the bills that bills are six and six? Love it. They're out there. They cannot make the playoffs. You got to go lease tenant six, 11 and five and just to get a wildcard this year. So there are, I want to again go back to being a defensive coordinator. He get a Superbowl ring. No, I know. He's just, he's got too much of an ego and he's got his brother there. What it is, as well as making fun.

Speaker 1:          00:18:46       You know, in New Orleans, they didn't let me do what I wanted to do. Really. You had the worst defense, you know, in the history of the NFL for two years in a row and you're trashing him on the way out. That's a good thing to do. Yeah. He's only made, he's, yeah, he's been a coach for like 12 years. Rob Ryan hit one of his teams, made the playoffs once and they got knocked out. The first game was New Orleans against Seattle a couple of years ago. Other than that, never even made a playoff. Did Rob has been a head coach? No, he's never but a defensive coordinator. Cowboys. He's with the Raiders. He's been all over the place. Yeah. And I think, I think rex does most of the heavy lifting when it, cause he always has good defenses and then, but now we actually has a decent quarterback. He just doesn't have anybody to fucking throw to and tie Rod Taylor, you cannot sack that guy.

Speaker 1:          00:19:26       It's unbelievable. He's fucking amazing. I know. Constantly getting out of the way. Um, but you know, and then the dolphins gift that they gave us a Mario Williams, Mario Williams, uh, they got released and he's terrible. I don't know what happened then I'd do it. He's on Miami now. He's got like two tackles the whole year. So buffalo new to get rid of him. Uh, but yeah, Buffalo's out again. It'll be 17 years, no playoffs. But they're bad or they're better than than they were. And Rex goes in and just sells, as you know, does is all bullshit, you know what I mean? Like I'm not here to lose. Really? Wow. I didn't go there to kisses. Kisses rings. Yeah. I'm, I'm, I'm here to make the playoffs. Oh, that's good. Good, good to know. You know I love this week was Brian Cashman set after the Red Sox, I guess sign some deals with something he said.

Speaker 1:          00:20:10       He just went, wow. He goes to like the Golden State warriors and I fucking died laughing like, dude, they'll fucking talk about the, well, how would that expression to pot calling the kettle black? You fucking assholes. You invented that shit. How the fuck you going to sit there and say it? Like he should have been like, wow, those guys are ripping us off just cause the last few years. Well, it's basically since George Steinbrenner died. Yeah. The Sun's way more conservative and is trying to do it with the farm system, which I respect and I love. But Brian Cashman was part of that of course, a fees like a fucking free agency war criminal. And now he's fucking wagging his finger at the fucking red sox for doing what the, that what they did. Now having said that, I, it's the thing that turned me off about baseball and I felt the red sox in oh seven became the Yankees, you know, when they signed all those people.

Speaker 1:          00:21:00       So it's been difficult for me to get back into it. But I guess, but also you gotta realize yesterday the Yang, the Yankees sign Chatman to close or four years, 86 million for, for a closer. And w w where did he play again? Remember he was with the, um, the reds. He was with the Yankees last year. They traded him at the trading deadline that the cubs won the world series where he throws 105 miles an hour. He went to the cubs. He was a free age and Yankees just resigned. I'm going back four years, 86 million. He was there, but he was one of the guys though who? Chapman. He Chapman was originally with the reds. He got in some trouble off the field and the Yankees got 'em for half a season trade. And I'm that a cubs and reds. What kind of trouble does somebody get into it? You fucking trade away 105 mile an hour pitcher.

Speaker 1:          00:21:46       I know. He just didn't die. He didn't exude the uh, the what, what we like to give to our fell. What did they say? The, the persona of our team. We have a code. We have a code here in Cincinnati. Why don't you throw it out the fucking window? The guy still 105 miles an hour. Exactly. Let him do what he wants. He's going to grab some titties. A fucking nuts. Hooters. You know, it's funny, as I was saying that, I was like [inaudible] now that going to be a thing, you know the fucking Internet now was he advocating social south? You know that happens now if you little fuck oh yeah, absolutely. You have this, this like I didn't look into special. I film like a little over a year ago or year and a half actually. It's been and this stuff on there. I led a look back cause I was trying to trying to do a trail and I'm like, Holy Shit.

Speaker 1:          00:22:29       I said that. I go, it's probably what I said a year and a half ago. It was like, I can't believe he said that. Right. And how quickly it could wait. Where did you film it? In a George Street playhouse in New Brunswick, New Jersey. It's right down the street from the stress factory. He was going to say, yeah, it's like a 600 theat the seat theater. It was Vinnie upset Navine health center of any help promote it. I had to get them at work. A man and when his beak. Yeah, absolutely. Because if any runs that town, that fucking guy and he was going to do a set, he was going to open the show and do 10 minutes to warm up the crowd. Of course he was late and he didn't. Uh, so yeah, I'm sorry. Goals, that would have been like video. I'm trying to have a good special here.

Speaker 1:          00:23:06       I know I had a backup just in case, so, but yeah, so I cut Vinnie and on a, basically they sold tickets to the stress factory, so, oh, that's cool. Yeah. So you kept everything. Yeah. We're friends. We've, we started comedy back together years ago. What year did you guys start? I started in 91. I started in [inaudible] 92. So he started in 91, too. Ah, yeah. Yeah. 91. And he was probably already married with like 19 kids. Yeah, he had already, he was married with three kids. He owned a Flores. He was a fucking maniac. I was booking like this open mic thing on a Monday night, a strip club. I remember when I, when I met him in the mid nineties, he was such an angry man. He was, you could feel it off of him. It was, he was going through that, that first, uh, first go around and uh, then the, he's just become the exact opposite.

Speaker 1:          00:23:53       Now he's like, fucking Santa Claus. It, he used to just be like in the 90s, dude. And, and I, I was an angry, fucked up dude. So I, every once in a while I would meet someone who matched my anger or surpassed it. And I was always just like, I, and I'm not gonna fuck with that guy. Like I have, I, we have a running joke mean oop, uh, from opie and Anthony and a whatever the fuck they calling it now. Um, he, uh, we recognize both of us were like this fucking level of anger and just how everybody got thrown under the bus on that show. And eventually it was arguing. I had a big army with Patrice on that show. And, uh, I just, we both had, I think he was the one who brought it up. He's like, to the first time I met you, I sense this fucking anger.

Speaker 1:          00:24:29       And he was like, I'm going to stay away from that. I was like, I do not see what the fuck I was. Because if you, if you listen to the a is show, you'll never find a clip of us. Will it be everybody trashed and everybody, we never lob one at each other. I don't know what, there was just something about the guy, I'm like, this guy is a skies like he, he might be even angrier than I am. So I just completely stayed away. No, that's a, that's a good move. No, Vinny was very angry. I remember it as a comic because Vinny had the comedy club like in 94 he had the stress factor was, it was another little spot. So at a hotel or whatever, and my friend, this Guy Eric and manic local comic ago, he's, he books it. Go give them your card and he goes, Hey, I'm a comedian.

Speaker 1:          00:25:07       I lived in New Jersey cause I love to do you call it, here's my card. And when he goes to Chicago, he goes, yeah. And it was a nice card at, as a headshot on it. Vinny just ripped it up right in front of them. We just walked away. Why? And then he just stopped and then he came back and thought it was funny. And then the other dude was so pissed at them. He's like, what a fucking asshole. You know, Shit like that. And that's just the way Vinnie was just a component. The only boss, he was just fucking around. That's hilarious. I don't know if he was or not. He just, but yeah, he was, he was angry. That's why I liked them. I loved, you know, I love the angry dudes. Well, you know, when the first time I did, uh, the stress factory, I worked with a already Fletcher.

Speaker 1:          00:25:41       Remember him? Yeah. He's, he's still a friend of mine. He tells everybody we are. So I, uh, he's in Florida now. Yeah, he's in Florida. So we worked together and you know, of course I didn't draw anybody, like Vinny was giving me a shot and I made fun of the club and I was just no name comic. And I think it, cause he, I didn't realize he built most of it at the time. Now it's a really nice club. I remember when he first opened it. I mean it was, it was, uh, it was a dump. So I fucking made fun of it. And, uh, but I, I still killed and making fun of the club was killing and all that. And then I remember he called my manager at the time just being like, yeah, you know, you didn't get the job done. He didn't get the job done and he fucking wouldn't, he didn't work me for like seven years after that.

Speaker 1:          00:26:22       And uh, I don't think he fucking worked me until after opie and Anthony maybe a little before that. He started to work me. Was that what it was in the hotel because he used to have it in a hotel before we moved it to the same, I helped paint that place when he moved it over there. I was there when it, when it was, he couldn't have been over them one too. Two, three fucking years. He had the creepy bicycle hanging from the fucking ceiling and that stage was fucked up. It was, it was, I can't, I can't remember, but it was, it was a dump. But then what happened over the years? Then he redid the floor, he got the smoke eater and all of a sudden it was amazing. It went from like this fucking d level room to now like that's a play.

Speaker 1:          00:27:03       I love that place. Yeah. That's one of my favorite clubs. Vinnie probably wishes I got to that part sooner in that fucking story. Cause he's primary calling. You're fucking trash and a club on the God damn podcast or whatever he has. He is normal now. Like he's on the committee. He was running for council and as town and stuff like that. Yeah, he's, he's um, he's evolved. Yeah. That's funny though. This when you get to be our age, like the one of two things happens. Either you fucking evolve, you chill out and you learn how to like enjoy life or you are literally the exact same fucking person you were. When, when, whenever I see people either, either way they become dads or whatever, they just changed. They've mellowed, they're not as angry, they're happy, blah, blah, blah. Or they literally the exact same fucking person they were when I met him in the 90s.

Speaker 1:          00:27:51       Yeah. And you don't want to be that guy. I know that like when I got married and had a kid and move to the suburbs, I'm like man, I'm going to be tough and that talk to neighbors and hang out with them and talk fucking, you know, school districts. And then I got to go basketball camp and sit next to them at chuck e cheese and I love doing that. I love how my more normal neighbors, we walk our kids to the bus stop every day we hang up, I go over there, they come over my house. It's fucking great. I love being around other parents and stuff like that. I thought I was just going to be a nightmare. I wish I knew when I was younger than that. That was uh, you know that that actually I would think helps your comedy because I always thought like, you know, when we were coming up, you just sell my God, get married and have a kid.

Speaker 1:          00:28:28       That's it. It's all, yeah, your career's over it. You're not going to make it. That's what always cracks me up when they talk about like the pressure, like women have it becoming pregnant. Like, if like, how do I keep the career and blah, blah, blah, blah, and, and I understand that in the real world. But like in show business, I think everybody, man or woman, if you're on the performance side, it's just like that. I, I'm, I'm fucking done. I like, you just feel like I have to be at a certain level of selling tickets for my wife to still believe in me. Because if you still like, you know, not selling tickets, they're going to be like, you're doing this comedy thing on the weekend. I need, I need a solid paycheck. I need to know that there's money coming in. Like I, you know, how many fucking guys did you see though, that that kid just fucking took him right down to the mat?

Speaker 1:          00:29:12       A ton, man. You know, I always, when I first started, I remember Ray Romano was married with two kids at the time. Like how can he juggle both? I never knew how he could do that. Yeah. I'm like, how could it be funny and have a family life and shit like that. And I always thought, there's no way I can have that. I probably would have screwed it up in my twenties and thirties once I got into my forties I'm like, all right, I could do it. Absolutely would have fucked it up. I would have been a fucking lunatic. And uh, you know, I think there's a reason I waited so, so, I mean, most of it was fear, but a lot of it was I was a fucking lunatic. Yeah. Same Way. Same with, I'm like, I'm going to screw this up. I'm gonna fuck some girl on the road I shouldn't be doing.

Speaker 1:          00:29:45       You know what I mean? As you get older, like that's, it doesn't even, you know, it's not even part of the equation. When you have a bad set, you take it home with you. Oh, absolutely. Yeah. Maybe if you know me fucking doing the dishes all the time, I know if I would've just got, if you would allow me to take a nap and I had to watch a kid, you know how to work that night, yell out shit. So No, when I look back to all the fucking shit that I went through, the I really did not have to go through. And, uh, that's what verse he cracks me up. You know, Paul Versey. Yeah, yeah. Like I just was like, dude, where the fuck were you? I wish there was a version of you might, maybe there wasn't. I just didn't pay attention. Like he has the most fucking normal life.

Speaker 1:          00:30:22       Like, and then he just goes on the road, you know, as a comedian. Then he comes home like completely fucking normal and like, he's like an 80 year old man and like a 35 year old body and like it, like I, he has like comics over and they always say that like younger comics, like his fucking age always going over there like, oh my wow, dude. So you just like, you know, you got a wife, couple of kids and see she's cool with you going out and uh, he's like, yeah, yeah, that was doing standup when I met her and Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. So I always think of like whenever I look at the way I always tell him, you know, cause uh, I always go, dude, you're fucking doing it right. No, absolutely doing it. You, you did it. He's doing it.

Speaker 1:          00:30:56       Like that's the way Ray Romano did. Ray Romano, who got married at the regular age, started a family at the regular fucking age and all of that and uh, still hit. And you know, it's great to, was he, he got 'em he got in before Seinfeld hit that big payday on the syndication. Cause I have a theory that after they had to pay Seinfeld, that Hollywood all got together and was like, how the fuck do we owe a stand up comedian? Half a billion dollars? How does this deal work? Never give this deal out again. Well Ray Romano is still has it. Well he's the last one cause that was it. Nobody ever got the, I don't think anybody's gotten it created by, it was a combination of the creative by a performer, a producer and a writer. Checky pull those four fucking checks off the same goddamn show. And then there wasn't the, the influence of the Internet and video games and all this shit.

Speaker 1:          00:31:52       You know, I've been making fun of that stupid, those fucking virtual reality. It's that thing. You put the phone up to the glasses and the level with which people are freaking out. Like, Oh, I go, oh, like, like you don't know you're still in your living room. Right. I fucking hate that's right up there with the people when they're blindfolded and they're uh, they're feeding them all of garden and they, they'll, when they can't tell, oh my God, it's so decadent. It's like olive garden. It's like a seventh grader can make pasta like that. Yeah. And the only people that eat it all of garden, it's right outside of a hotel and you have no choice. It's business people. You don't have a car and you'd have to walk through. And I was broke. I used to, and I loved it because they kept bringing the bread and would just fill you up slowly.

Speaker 1:          00:32:35       My bread, I fucking love that. I know I gotta. I gotta wait until eats it a club eight o'clock. So if I eat it too, I'll fill up til eight. And then I get a free meal at the club. It was a long time. That was a class he plays to bring a date for me. They had wine. Yeah. You know, come on. Even another glass of wine. Here we go. Angel Hair, pasta, watching your weight. So when uh, when does this special come up? Friday, December 9th. Friday, December 9th, which is tomorrow. Um, I guess, I don't know. Now. It tastes way people listen to podcasts and uh, we're going to have a look. Do we have a link that I can, um, text out here? Do we have anything? Bueller? Okay. It is, can I have it so I can say it? Jesus Christ. I know we didn't play in this, so this isn't on you.

Speaker 1:          00:33:19       I'm just saying. All right, this is, this is the level of professionalism that I have on my, uh, my podcast. Well, you got, you got any road date? Is there anything you want to plug coming up? Um, now just, I'm doing a stand in New York City, New Year's Eve. Nice. Yeah. I love that club. Yeah. That's a fucking great cloud. That's great. It's kind of, it's like the seller 2.0 yeah. Just go down there man. It's like, you know, sometimes there's 10 people on a Thursday, which is fucking beautiful. I love that. Yeah. And just do what you know and just record your sets and work it out. And so I loved it. So I love playing that place. And, and Bennington is going to host at night. Ron Bennington. He's doing standup again. Yeah. So he's a host at nine years. I didn't even know he did stand up.

Speaker 1:          00:33:57       I guess he did it back in the day. I guess he had a club down in Florida when he was on, I don't know, I don't remember this, but that's what we're were saying. And then I did this thing with Bobby Kelly called creeps were kids. It was made a bunch of the comics. We had kids and we did a whole show on Bennington hosted and did stand up on it a couple of months ago. It creeps with kids grades for kids. Yeah. He wants to take that around the country. He, uh, I did one of his Ron Bennington, whatever the fuck he call you on mass and it was going to say exposed. It just flashed the crown. Yeah. He's a fucking great interviewer and all, all of that. I had no idea you did stand up. I would love to see because he's funny. He's fucking hell. He's great man.

Speaker 1:          00:34:32       Ron in Fez did. They don't do that shit anymore. I don't know. Feds just um, basically just quit. Or he did the Robert Plant. Yeah, he just said, you know, we peaked. He had done, he had his 14 million or whatever the fuck he had. Yeah. So Ron does it with his daughter. Oh, all right. I got to get back east, dude. I don't even, I don't even know what's going on anymore. Yeah, it's, it's every, every week. It's something different. Opie's on in the afternoon. Now Jim's on in the morning, which Sam Roberts and Opie and Anthony are talking again. I know, I see. I'm wondering now is if they ever do like if they ever have, you know, like the rock and roll hall of fame, how backstage, how weird it must be with those bands that had all the problems and then they got to walk out together. Like if there's ever like a radio hall of fame at some point they got to bring opie and Anthony.

Speaker 1:          00:35:15       Jimmy I know. So they all got to be there. Uh, I'll hope when they get back together. I think enough time has gone. I don't know if enough time has gone by, but uh, you know, I dunno. I think they will at some point. You know, I think he, I think I'll be an Anthony at least. Well and then hopefully Jim, hopefully you'll be to trio back. Why can't they do like the Mike and the mechanics thing? We, you just go out, you fucking do a couple of solo records. Then you reform is genesis. I know. I guess that doesn't work with radio. You're going to kind of, you can't just do little fucking, hey, we're going to be opening an Anthony for six months and then we're doing that. I'm going to do my side project. I never had a good head for business.

Speaker 1:          00:35:52       How did you deal with the election? Were you one of those people crying when you sell a Hillary didn't break through that final glass ceiling? No, not at all. Did you watch it at all? I watch it. Yeah. I fell asleep like around like one 30 and then I was down at Disney world, my kid, and then everyone was crying the next day at Disney. You know, what am I going to tell my kids? I, I want him to, Mike woke up, I go, Trump won. He goes, okay. That's what I told them. Yeah, I don't, uh, this always happens. It always happens. Like I remember after, after Bush, it was just, fuck anybody wearing a red tie was everybody in and all the blue guys came in. Right. Same Bullshit happens, right? Same fucking bullshit. They forgive the banks still got Guantanamo. We're not end the fucking war.

Speaker 1:          00:36:37       Beauvoir no, none of the fucking bankers go to jail. And then it's like, hey, it's still blue guy, ty fault. Nothing but red tie. Like, like this is going to be, I have to tell you was fucking hilarious. Was out of all the celebrities and it was so many of them just, you know, um, campaigning, which is so fucked up to me cause I'm old enough to remember what you didn't tell anybody who you voted for. And I think that they actually hurt the camp. Uh, it's just so weird. Like why would I listen to, to an actor, tell me, I know Jay z, like even if I'm a Jay z Fan, am I going to fit well? Who's he voted for? Okay, I'll vote for him. Like he pays attention. They ain't fucking guy trying to keep his fucking billion dollar business going. Like he has the fucking time.

Speaker 1:          00:37:24       I don't have the time and I'm not doing shit right. I don't have time to keep up on it. So, but the funny one I just saw it recently was Scott Bail, who I love, um, the, the most like, you know, make America great again. I just loved how vague it was. Let's make America great again. It's so, he goes out, I guess at the Republican National Convention, Scott fucking bales there. Why to match whoever the fuck are the blue blue guys have. So he goes out there, this is what he said. He goes, we're here not only to make America great again, but more importantly, make America America again. And he got a fucking applause break. Like what the fuck is? Yeah, what does that mean? Let's make toast toast again. What does that mean? Don't put butter on it. Just just toast to thing and like, what the fuck does that mean?

Speaker 1:          00:38:17       Now you can read all the way into it. That means like, let's make it all for fucking white people only again, which is far as I can tell. It really still kind of is for as much as much as the people on the red red tide site are complaining, it's still pretty great for fucking white people. I don't, I don't know what their problem is. I think it's other white people with all different types of ties working in banks fucking them over. And for some reason they, I don't know what they think. It's a taxi driver. I have no fucking idea. But like make America America again. Yeah, it's, it's ridiculous. You know, the Hillary stuff, you know, people are like, how can women voted for Trump? Like why would a woman vote for Trump? I have to, all that stuff came out of grabbing the posting and all that stuff.

Speaker 1:          00:38:59       It's like, okay, every girl that voted for fucking Trump knows four guys that talk exactly like him. They've known him since high school. They don't have since gray. And He, and they're over every Sunday for football. They were over for Thanksgiving and they go, no new year's Eve party. They all know that guy. They don't hate them. They still hang around with them. How I felt until all those women came forward. And I was like, Oh, I maybe the Hillary campaign paid him until that one's, the one lady goes, um, you know, he started hitting on a corner and started hitting on it and she goes, come on, get real, get real. Cause he's so fucking old, which is hilarious. It's just exactly like what kind of fantasy you live in that I'm so pathetic. I'd hook up with a fucking skeleton like you. So she goes, get real.

Speaker 1:          00:39:42       And then she goes, he, then he had his hands in his pocket or something to thrusted as generalists toward me and said, get re and was just so fucking the detail of it. I was in the car, my wife and I was like, oh my, I was like, that happened. That definitely fucking happen. Oh yeah, yeah. He's been doing that stuff for a long time and, but whatever. But the women had no problem with what Trump said, all of that stuff. He said, you know, grabbing the pussy, it was a pig. He did all of that and none of them. That didn't factor anyone's decision. Or like I know six creeps just like that. That's the same way I think my husband talks that way. But I feel like if you're a woman in your pussy isn't going to be near enough Trump to be grabbed.

Speaker 1:          00:40:22       If he's going to give you a tax cut, I think you're going to go with it. Like I know, I don't know. Proof people do what's good for them. That's absolutely vote. Like I would sit there, hey, this guy's people yelling Edward at the rally. I, yeah. You know, I'm not into that, but, but, but Hillary, blah blah. So it's like, it's like, so you don't care. Like, like most white people do not give a shit about racism because it doesn't affect them. You know what I mean? Yup. That's the kind of thing that I would love to say back in the day on Opie and Anthony. Then they would talk about like, you know, uh, affirmative action. You know, these white chairs can you in the fuck school. It's like, dude, if you can't beat out the inner city kid who probably had fucking Shitty or books 20 times, you shouldn't be fucking go in there.

Speaker 1:          00:41:00       That's like when people are out here, they'll run into a bad club owner out here. We like fucking La is not working out for me. It's like, dude, if you can't get, if you don't make it in this business, cause a one fucking club owner or something like that, then I mean Wa yeah. Who gives a shit about that? Yeah. It's just like it does this, this is a Zillion fucking clubs is a zillion doors to get through. If you're just going to let give this one person all of this fucking power. It's that same thing like, you know in the city, there's a law in New York City is 11 clubs that do comedy every night. I tell young, calm, so it would just get in one or two. It doesn't, don't worry about the other nine and then eventually we'll get them. And who cares?

Speaker 1:          00:41:31       That danger fields said you're not in a room who's right for that room and nobody knows nobody. Nobody's right forever. I'm don't take that personally. Go with the go work at the fucking stand or stand up New York, you'll do better there. Anyway, I did a pop in spot there about a year ago at Dangerfield and it was like, it was literally like no time had gone by in that. Nothing had changed. Their UB obviously different faces shower. He was still a way to there as far as I know, and I fucking went up in front of this crowd and just fucking ate it. Ate it like I was a fucking three years into the business. Just went up there. They finally fixed the sound. Do you remember at that club, the fucking reverb? REVERB was cranked up? Yes. So fucking high for like fucking eight years and there was this little mixer up there and it was awesome.

Speaker 1:          00:42:17       He had to do was just fucking fade something up or down or turn a knob and nobody did it for eight years. I just remember whenever, if you did a bit that was loud and it bombed, how they would be that fucking echo. Like when Dean Martin would sing at Capitol records, it had like that fucking echo thing going on and it made it like, it's almost like a bomb twice cause they got to hear the echo of whatever they just, they didn't fucking laugh at. But uh, dude, I haven't done the clubs back then and so, uh, I've been out here for a while. Well that room was, you know, they don't tell you what the cover charges. You know, a kid comes in 22 years old when his girlfriend, some chick, he's trying to bang. Yeah, let's go to Dangerfield Rodney Dangerfield yet. And they, oh yeah, come on in, come on, sit down, sit down the cover charges like $19.

Speaker 1:          00:43:00       This is like in 1995 like 19 ahead and the drinks are like $19 and it's a two drink minimum. So you know, you're the comedians up. Then all of a sudden he's like, Oh let's get out of it. It's socks cause nobody's laughing. You were in a pitch pitch black dark, you can't see a fucking thing in front of you. And then a kid, the 19 year old kid that's trying to bang, this chick gets a check for like $102. He's been in the club for 30 minutes. Wow. 100 today. And you just hear screaming in the back though. You got to pay what? I didn't know it cost $19 again at $19. They don't tell you when nothing's posted. Oh God. And then they do, you know if you're going to a great club though, it's a great class. A little laid out. I don't want to shit on all these.

Speaker 1:          00:43:35       No, no, no, no, no. It's, it's, it is for a comp and especially in New York City where you could actually do 30, 25 to 30 minutes, you can't do it at a most of the clubs. Well Jim Norton was the guy that got us all in there. He all, you got to all of us on opiate Anthony and he got all of us to do danger fields before that because he was, um, he was one of those few, well I guess cause he was a Jersey guy, but I was like, somebody that's New York comics, we're just content to just do, you know the New York clubs, you know the comic strip and that was it. And do their 20 minutes and it's just like, dude, don't you want to expand this? At some point you're gonna have to do back then, remember it was 45 minutes to close, then it became an hour and now you gotta do like an hour plus. But back when we started out as the opener did like 10, eight to 10 brought up the feature, who did 20 and then a or 25 maybe 25 maybe a half at the most. And then the headliner did 45 that was your show. 90 minutes. So it's, yeah, it's 1530 45 and I remember thinking, Oh my God, I don't fuck do you do 45 minutes? How do you get that? Last 15 minutes together. Now it's like you gotta you gotta do like a fucking hour and 10 minutes, hour and 15.

Speaker 4:          00:44:43       Uh, um,

Speaker 1:          00:44:46       what's his face last night? Uh, Jesus Christ. I'm getting so old. It just spaced on his fucking name. The guy from black flag,

Speaker 1:          00:44:54       Henry Rollins, Rollins, he's the one who spoke spoken word thing. I got to stop fucking talking to myself. I've got to go to those headpieces cause I really think it's fucking with my memory. Henry Rollins, right? I fucking went to see that guy do debt, dude. He does like two and a half hours and it's just like he and he's like, it's fucking unbelievable. And he's intense, right? The whole two, whenever that whole fucking at the time it was funny. Droves. It goes. I was with Jerome, I'm like this fucking guy, dude. He comes out, it's like when they go, ladies and gentlemen, please welcome Henry Rollins. They barely get the s of Rollins and he's fucking out there, right? And he comes walking out and he does this bow and his fists are clenched and then he takes the mic out of the mic stand and he's such rapid the cord around his fucking head.

Speaker 1:          00:45:35       It was just, it was, it was the guy was fucking amazing. And um, I made two rows. I laughed my ass off cause cause we were watching the guys, God, Jesus Christ, the guys go fucking intense. And he goes like, yeah dude and he's stone sober. I was like, Yo, I gotta tell you something. I don't think I've ever seen a guy who needs a drink more than this guy this fucking like and he doesn't take on water. Like he doesn't take a break. I heard like he won't even reach for water during his set. I'm telling you it was like just full on for two is yeah, it was like a, I'm trying to think of a band. Yeah, I guess it would be like if you'd never heard of ACDC, you know, they don't play any ballads and if there was no talking between songs and it was all coal out of rosy, right back and forth, or even like raging against the machine who doesn't talk when they were, they were just, I've been to a million old shows and it's just pure.

Speaker 1:          00:46:24       No, they don't talk and I just go one the one song to another, to another, to another. That's another band that their singer won't do it. No, he won't do it. There's so many of those fucking band. There's millions and millions of dollars on the table for them to do like festivals over in Europe or the 80,000 people and do a tour to states and the guy just won't do it. Well, here's, this is the thing. If you're in a band, okay, and you start seeing your lead singer, like reading a real estate book or something on business, you've got to burn that fucking thing because he's going to invest his money wisely and then he's not going to need to do it. And then you're going to be fucked. I just can't imagine like,

Speaker 4:          00:47:05       mmm,

Speaker 1:          00:47:06       I can't in, first of all, I can't imagine the pressure of the lead singer where it's like, what if, what if the drummer fucked up and it doesn't have his Goddamn, it doesn't have money. And it's just like you could just go do a fucking tour just to help him out. You got the pressure of him going, come on man, I'm going to lose my fucking house. Him and his, and he'd be like, during the 90s we made enough money. You never shed at work again. Well I was bad with money. Yeah, well that's just do three kings,

Speaker 2:          00:47:31       that's the thing, which is mostly what journey. They all invest their money and that's why Steven Perry has a lot of money. They were like the first rock band real really like put their money away and had good financial planning and stuff. So they didn't have to do that. They didn't do anything for a while until I got the Asian singer. They had another guy in every four, but they didn't have to do it. Um, but yeah, a lot of bands like, but this guy in rage against machine, he just, they have a, they have a band meeting once a year. He doesn't even have a cell phone. They have to like call somebody to call somebody. It's almost like when they were, you know, like trying to find bin Ladin he shows off. They talk about rage against the machine and you want to put this remaster I whatever.

Speaker 2:          00:48:06       Yeah, okay to hang for a couple hours. And he goes, oh, I'll see you guys. And then you don't see them for a year when I like looked as about 80 million on the table. If we do about 50 dates. Nah Man, I'm good. I'm all right. Jesus. Well, well supposedly supposedly the rumor what guns and roses they got back together, you know, slash going through a divorce and I don't even know if it's final yet, but he had no prenup. Married for 20 years in La with two kids. He was going to lose more than 50% of his money. And supposedly the cut is axle gets 50, uh slash gets 25 and duff gets 25 and slash we'll pay his other guys in the band. UFC Still Guy Richie forward us, he's got his drummer and all that does he read the keyboard at that comes out of axles money.

Speaker 2:          00:48:49       But supposedly what I heard is a doff is given some of his money to slash cause Duff's made so many good investments has so much money that he's like dude are you going to need it? Cause he's trying to pay this divorce off of whatever the money is gonna have to pay it. Tufts actually given slash some of the money and that's one of the main reasons they got back together. The axle never likes slash his wife. So as soon as they got married 20 years ago, whatever that everything fell apart. As soon as they broke up they started talking again and they've got the band back together. But supposedly duff has given a cut to slash to help him out. Jesus Christ, 20 years. California is a mother, 20 years and no prenup to kids.

Speaker 1:          00:49:28       How does it work? Like if you got married in California, but then you move to, to Washington and then if it falls apart there, do you then go by the laws of the state that you got married in or the state you're in there? I don't know. I don't know how that works. Yeah, dude, it's, did you see what happened in the beautiful woman there on, uh, you know the two gay guys, the guy of Al Al Bundy from married with children. Uh, what the fuck's the name of that show? Alternative lifestyles. Mato Mato family. Family. Yeah. That fucking show. Did you, did you see what's what she's going through? No, she was with some guy and they were gonna do that fucking in vitro, so I don't know. And he's Oh yeah. And he's so in for the embryos named him. Dude, if that was my son, I'd be like, you fucking piece of shit.

Speaker 1:          00:50:14       Get a fucking job, get a fucking job through that is dead. Is the conti hust bitchy as fucking thing. I've seen somebody doing a long fucking, he named the embryos people do me you fucking piece of shit. You think of it as a waitress in Hooters? Would it be then when us, no, he just knows she has money and he wants child support and he wants child support. That happened to something like my wife was telling me that happened to some other woman, same font. I think fucking things like, dude, that is just like, yeah, that a woman from the view, the black chick from the view that quit. What's your name? A star Jones. Was it? She did. She had a baby with this dude or whatever like that. Star Jones was the one who fucking got a stomach stapled and it was like, Nah, I just been doing cardio. Yeah, grapefruit. Yeah, I had, I was our, yeah. Oh, so she's at a number of, but she had the other chick who was the other one. Rosie O'donnell then called the route was like, now you lang, you fucking get it. Yeah, you got it stapled.

Speaker 1:          00:51:16       You know what's amazing, rex? Ryan's getting fat again. Like how do you, how you fucking push that band right off. He said that his brother ever since his brother got in town that did squat and they keep it, they can't stop eating. That was as cues 20 heart, his brother after, you know, it's funny like, yeah, if you move to buffalo, you're in trouble. There's no healthy place to eat. Yeah. I think that was it duff, is it Duffy's? Duffys the anchor bar and did the two places that claim that they invented the winks. Yeah, there's debt. Those two, if he goes to Minnesota and they got those juicy Lucy's, you know the Burgers, we put the fucking cheese in the middle of it. There's a lot of tough cities. New York. You could actually eat healthy though. You know he has rex Ryan. If he's not going to fucking, if he's going to stay skinny needs to coach a team in like self-involved cities only.

Speaker 1:          00:52:01       Yeah. Like if he was the La Rams, rams, rams, giants and jets, he be good. San Diego, San Diego. That's a, yeah, yeah, yeah. He'd meet some that might fuck up his marriage. So this is so many beautiful, cool chicks down there. You might have a fucking problem. You know, they're all walking around in sandals. He's into fee, you know, you walking around with no shirt on and shit, you know, so. All right, we're gonna, we're gonna wrap up here. Do it. It's always so great to see. I'm so proud, man. You've got this special coming out once again called a simple man. Simple man. Simple man. You can see it starting tomorrow, December 9th, 2016 if you listen to this 20 year and the years in the fucking future, um, iTunes in on Amazon and uh, was taped in New Jersey. And uh, you said you taped it how long ago? Like a year and a half ago.

Speaker 1:          00:52:49       It was about a year and a half. I'll see. You already got your new hour. You Ready? I'm ready. I'm ready. Don't want an f in about a month, dude. I'm not. Mine's coming out in January. I taped it in October and I've just been sitting around waiting for this kid to show up. So, uh, oh. And the ones that kid to the floodgates are going to open. I know. Hundred. Hey, you haven't been changing a diaper. What's up with that? I don't want to be the front and you won't be there. I thought I was going to be to cause all my friends, like, Oh men, you and I have a kid. You're not gonna be doing kid jokes. You start tucking my shirt in and wear a sport coat. You know when you go on stage, the dad shit with the fucking gap jeans. Yeah. Well that's the thing. When you first, you know, the first six months is hairy man has no sleep. Everyone's

Speaker 2:          00:53:26       cranky. You're up every two hours. You'd have to take shifts or whatever like that and you just got to make sure you're almost like don't put on that extra that dad weight in the beginning. Yeah, no, I'm actually trying, I'm trying to drop a bunch of weight before the kid gets there just because we'll put them, we're going to be so exhausted. If you, whatever your work out is, you're going to fuck that I'm taking a nap. Yeah. Well, that's why I think I'm not working on the road until February, but once I'm in February, in February, I would like to, uh, you know, just start going back out again because I figure I'll have my hour together by then enough to actually have somebody paid to see me do standup again. And um, the game plan is to, uh, you know, do my, I still do my two weekends a month, so I figured I'll just go out and just sleep when I'm on the road, do my show, go back, go to sleep and that, that'll be my thing.

Speaker 2:          00:54:14       And then with my wife, I'm just going to one day a week, I'm going to give it like a fucking spa day where she just goes and fucking probably sleeps during the massage or whatever. I just, I feel like my big thing is that I keep her fucking chill and happy the best I can then that that'll get through this. Absolutely. Yeah. That's what I did. I'd slept on the road. I did all my work on the road to how old's your son now? He's six. He just turned six. Six. Yeah. Fuck of the year's going. Holy Shit. Six years old and when he plays drums and stuff, he's played drums. He sings. He's going in the recording studio and next week that would cut two songs as if he's got two originals ones called evil pumpkin because he had a dream about a pumpkin and you already wrote the lyrics forward and let me, let me want the heaven is a ballad because he was a Motorhead fan.

Speaker 2:          00:55:00       He never got to meet Lemmy, so he sings about it. He's a, he's a, he's insane. Jesus Christ. Dude. You're raising them, right? Oh yeah. Taking them a dolphin games. He's been to three games already this year, is that right? Oh yeah. He loves it. Dolphins game. Oh, I turned them down in Miami twice. We went to a ravens game last week down in Baltimore. He almost meant Marino. He's Big Marino Fang, some friends, we'll Marino. So we're trying to get on the field. We code it and so he's like, you got to meet you. I'm like, luck. Yeah. He already met Ozzy. He's pissed and he hasn't met Angus Young. Oh my God. That's a tough one to pull off. I don't know if I can do, he can't get rid of Nero's ACDC guys. Brian Johnson when he was in a band you could, but that's tough to get.

Speaker 2:          00:55:36       We had um, a once on that metal show. I met him once and that's good. Brian Johnson at all an Angus. Wow. Yeah, Angus was on. How was that? It was great. Right when black ice come out. That was like a 2008 we first started doing the show. Yeah. And I ran into you at the forum. Yeah, we went to the show. Yeah. Uh, I'm a huge ACDC fan. What would they like? I know Brian's cool as well. First of all, my son saw ACDC with Brian Johnson and axle, so he's seen him with two different singers, which is great. And He loved both of them. Well, axle did a great job. He did an amazing job. I saw it twice in one week. It was so good. You know, what's amazing about, about axles voices to fact that he was a hermit and didn't tour forever.

Speaker 2:          00:56:12       He still has it. It's amazing how that guy, I give him the comeback player of the year between guns and roses doing two and a half hour shows and, and pulling off the bond. Scott and the Brian Johnson ACDC stuff. He's like, I hate supposedly he, he had uh, you know, he just realized all these guys die and David Bowie, you know, everywhere all these rock stars dying. He's like, what am I doing seriously at this point, let me just let me go back out there. Let's get the band back together and go have fun, play stadiums. And then went and then he was a huge ACDC fan at Bon Scott Fan. I was his favorite band growing up. He actually made the call, he called them and said, hey, if you guys need any help, just let me know. And they go will come down and audition and next thing you know, he had the Gig.

Speaker 2:          00:56:48       Wow. And the bonds got shitty. They were pulling out like the stuff they haven't done in years. If you want blood, you got it. They were doing live. Oh did they live wire killer shit. Yeah. Cause they hadn't played that since bond died. Yeah. And they did problem child the last night. I sold it last night at a tour, cliff Williams retired to bass player and they played problem child on the encore to go, we haven't done this. When we rehearsed it a couple times they're going to just did the prophet tired from the day I retire from the band. It was his last show in September. He, I think he got that, he's really close with Brian and I think Brian got the shaft, you know what I mean? And they lit both live down in Florida. They hang out in pubs, they drank and shit like that.

Speaker 2:          00:57:26       And it felt like Ah, you know when I'm out man cause it's just Angus left in a band. Like what are you going to do now? Oh God. So who, who do they get through replace him that nobody, cause the tour just ended. So I didn't know what, you know, they'll just hibernate for a couple of years. So the band right now is Chris Slade, Malcolm Young's brother Angus, axel, axel and no bass players. Yeah. So Angus is the only one, the original guy in the band. So they can't come back. They have to use axle. They can't come back. We're like a tribute singer from Texas, you know, and an appetite for destruction band. They ain't no way. They're not going to do arenas. Um, man. So he stuck with it. He had to come back. What happened? Brian? Brian, he's hearing God. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. I know.

Speaker 2:          00:58:13       Well, you know, looking at 68 years old, he can only do two shows a week. Angus wanted to do four or five. You don't want to sit in a hotel. You got a crew of like 300 people. It's expensive to be out on the road and I can just wants to play, you know, every other night. Brian can only do it two nights. Did you know it's a physical show to do one, two and a half hours. It's the singers. The big thing. You can play guitar. Angus l does fucking flop around on the floor and shit. The guys that, he's like 61 61 yeah. Yeah. And he's still, he's still still weighs 96 pounds and still, I know he never drank or did drugs back in the day. Used to drink milkshakes and shit just out and burn them off. Smoke four packs of cigarettes a day.

Speaker 2:          00:58:48       Yeah, that was his vice, Huh? Fuck. So I don't know what's going on but, but Brian based, so as soon as they found out something as almost like a marriage, you know, you're married like 30 years and all of a sudden you know, you see your wife was talking to an old boyfriend on Facebook. That's it. We're divorced. See, something's going on. Like they were just, I think I liked, they were looking for an excuse to let Bryan goal because anger Angus still wants to do it is Sangha [inaudible] all the money that's out there, he could play till he's 70 years old. He could still run around. So Brian was basically winding down. So he's like, all right, I got to get him out somehow. Get somebody else in and continue this. What they really should have done. Just said, Brian said, hey, I'm going to, I'm going to retire after it is, and then, you know, good luck to, those guys are going to get a new lead singer and they're gonna carry on.

Speaker 2:          00:59:30       The fans would have bought that, but there are a lot of them aren't buying it. There was a lot of tickets, like they were only doing about 10,000 people. Like a lot of people returned to tickets. Like, fuck that you guys fucked over Brian Johnson. I don't give a shit who's singing? We're not coming to see the band. So who knows what they're going to do now that, cause you know Jim Rowers to one who broke that brewer hung out with Brian Johnson like a week after the shit went down and basically went on his podcast and said, Brian's like, they fucked me. I said, I have a hearing problem. The next thing I know, I hear on the news that the tour is off and I'm out at a band and two days later they shipped all my shit to my house. Like a ups or a bail.

Speaker 2:          01:00:02       You U haul truck shows up with all my equipment. Is that true? I, yeah. Well that's what he told. Borrower and brewer talked about it and Brian had a back off. No, no, it didn't go down like that, but you know it did. He just said, look, I got to hear him problem. I'm just telling you that it's, it's eventually going to be a bigger problem, but you know, whatever. We have 10 shows left. Obviously I'm going to do one, but I got to figure this shit out and they just said the next day, all right, he's out of the band. Goodbye. He's retiring. He can't play anymore. Jesus, that makes me happy. I'm a comedian, you know? I know. Just on us to deal with that. Just to us, that level of shit. All right, well that's the Thursday afternoon podcast. I got to read some advertising here.

Speaker 2:          01:00:38       I will not make you sit through listening to me. I don't care, man. But if you go to Jim florentine.com put the Promo Code [inaudible], you'll get it for five bucks to special. If you don't, if you don't go to iTunes, there's a sort of doing that. Okay, well shit. Guess what I'm doing when I get home? Well I'm going to lamaze class. The last fucking one we didn't get into that I'd fucking out. I did want to know is birthing natural birthing classes. You know what, we went to it like an infant infant care thing and I, you know, they taught us how to change a diaper and shit. Like, so like I, you know, I had younger brothers and sisters so I knew how to do it, but then like a, you know, I just hadn't done in a while. So that one actually was just like, oh yeah, okay.

Speaker 2:          01:01:19       It's good to teach how to ramp the kid up and that shit. Okay, I get this. But that fucking, this is the last one to dude, I'll tell you this, this is the last one. And uh, I wish it was a pub right across the fucking street, cause I would go out and celebrate that this fucking class. I mean the ladies Nice who teaches it? Everybody in the class and nice, but he's just a fucking waste. It's what the fuck are we doing?

Speaker 6:          01:14:12       [inaudible]

Speaker 7:          01:14:49       right. It's one of those deals every year. There's that Douche. Then there's always the Doshi west to try and top everybody's stories. You know, you can be sitting there with the fucking astronaut each somehow try to top them or correct them.

Speaker 6:          01:15:08       Okay.

Speaker 7:          01:15:08       Well, actually I thought, uh, according to, uh, you know, when, I don't know what video games, some fucking astronaut video game that Douche played, he'd actually try to question a real artist who even knows an astronaut at this point, aren't they all dead?

Speaker 6:          01:15:22       Okay?

Speaker 7:          01:15:23       Did the people who are on the space shuttle where they consider it astronauts because I didn't consider them astronauts. You're not an astronaut if you're in a plane. Okay. And I know it's a big one and I know it's got rockets on it initially. All right?

Speaker 6:          01:15:41       Okay.

Speaker 7:          01:15:41       But all I know is that the astronauts that I grew up on with, we're fucking, they were at the top of a missile. That's what day did, you didn't stare that fucking thing. I mean how they got back, they had a little capsule. Think he just leaned to one side. You kept rolling back towards the earth hoping you'd reenter. Right then the parachutes came out and they couldn't fucking find you. Cause all we had was binoculars. You know, where is he? I don't see you. All right. Hang on the star, not, they ain't not, not the star board. Right. And you're fucking sitting there in the water, clinging to a sting ray. If you lucky, you landed on an island and then you met a genie who called your master, but for some reason you never fucked her. But other than that, that's what an astronaut was even didn't flying a fucking plane, you know, Wheaton spaghettios or whatever the fuck they did. And then land and get towed to the gate by a fucking Toyota Tundra. All right. That's not an astronaut. To me, that's a very impressive pilot. Very impressed. You went a lot higher than the jumbo jet. I flew to Syracuse. Sin Hat's off to you, sir.

Speaker 6:          01:16:55       [inaudible]

Speaker 7:          01:17:32       your thoughts do. My question is in here somewhere. I am nowhere near a conspiracy freak or anything like that, but I do admit I get a hard on for any documentary on that secret military base in Nevada that is called area 51 the government is suppose, well, I mean believe in aliens. Like I don't know that. That's really not that crazy. You know, you think like how big the fucking universes. There's just life on one planet, no life anywhere else. Despite the fact that they see evidence of water on Mars at some point. You know, I'm telling you guys, we're not that special.

Speaker 7:          01:18:19       If you're God and you made the whole university the, I'm just going to sit back, watch in one fucking planet. Maybe that's why the earth is so fucked up. I don't think he's been watching us for the last couple of thousand. He wasn't last time he reached out. Reach out, reach out. All right. When's the last time he fucking did that was the last time he fucking was in a burning Bush going, hey, hey, you there, you there with the long fucking Kirby stick next to the sheep. Come over here. Come over to the burning Bush. You know, when was the last time we did that? I think he's been watching another earth. I'm flipping through the channels, you know, can imagine how clear his fucking, how big do you think God's flat screen TV is? How clear is that picture? I bet even if you make it to heaven, you know, you don't even get to see it. Like he comes out of his office and he tried to peek in real quick and like the human eye, you can just, it's just too much of a fucking glare. Right. Um, so anyways. Yeah and if you believe in aliens, I mean, I mean, I don't know that, that, that we can reach one another.

Speaker 7:          01:19:26       You know, that whole flying saucer fucking over shit. I mean, how long can you go with, with artificial breathe, you know, some sort of atmosphere in there. It was like on Star Trek. I mean they just had this limitless supply of fucking oxygen.

Speaker 8:          01:19:42       Oh

Speaker 7:          01:19:46       well just fucking flying through space.

Speaker 7:          01:19:51       Now look at them. They landed on a lot of planets that at oxygen they would just land on these planets and they just had oxygen. I think what they did was they opened the day, landed the star ship enterprise and they just opened the windows and they got some more oxygen and then they flew away. Right. Isn't that how it works? Anyways? Um, the government supposedly is housing and researching crashed Ufo goes and uses deadly force to keep regular people out. Do you have any opinion on the subject? I think I just said, I mean, I don't fuck do I think they actually have the bodies of aliens? Um,

Speaker 7:          01:20:30       did you realize like the level of secrecy you would have to have if you actually had that shit? That would be like one of the things before they went in the room. It's like, okay, we're going to let you in this room and you got to understand when you go in this room, the doors closing and you're never getting out because you're going to see some fucking shit in here that I don't give a fuck. You're not. If you have one shot a Nyquil, you're, you're going to be blabbering about it. You can't do it. So I, I don't, I don't know. I don't fucking know. Um, anyways, he goes, what your bullshit meter say? I think there's way too much of a veil of secrecy around the place to think otherwise. I used to know someone who was a career air force pilot. Whenever the subject of that base or those mysterious for flights, serious lights over Phoenix scene in 1997 came up.

Speaker 7:          01:21:19       He completely removed himself from the conversation. Uh, those mysterious lights, I don't even know what you're talking about for all you know, they're just testing some psycho fucking weaponry, you know, were looking for when the new Yankee stadium came out and like, oh, eight or oh nine and they will, like, we'd have 2013 technology. All right. If those fucking morons that run that place can have shit that we're not going to have, you know, they can be four or five years ahead of us. Can you imagine what the government is? I mean, they got to have shit from like, I dunno, 2014 I have no fucking idea. I Dunno. Anyways, he says quite frankly, the evenings lapse would end right after the topic was brought up. I believe in life outside of our universe to think that we human and Oliver's in habit and so the only life anywhere is just plain ignorant.

Speaker 7:          01:22:11       I 100% agree with that. Uh, I'm sure you've heard stories about President Nixon secretly showing you fos and aliens to his favorite comedian Jackie Gleason. Uhh, that's a complete crock of shit. Uh, what would you like? He's going to do that. All right. Now I'm know I'm not supposed to show you the Arrow when we call. It was a bad Nixon impression right there. Um, what would happen if you were shown some stuff like that? I imagine I would immediately be microchipped or shot in the back of the fucking head. Would you tell about it? I would want to know about that. That if I actually found out about that, it would blow my fucking mind. I, you know what it is? Look maybe that maybe your Air Force Guy Buddy that has seen some, because I would say that like all converse. No, but you know what, he laughs right up until that moment. If he wasn't laughing at all throughout all your conversation, then I would, I would believe it more because I know if I knew some shit like that.

Speaker 6:          01:23:17       Okay.

Speaker 7:          01:23:17       And then I would sit there and listening to people talking about God and Holy Shit that we believe down here that didn't include aliens. I would, I would feel like a fucking alien.

Speaker 6:          01:23:27       Okay.

Speaker 7:          01:23:28       Cause that would be like, ah, yeah, we're just a speck of dust. They are people and there's all this other stuff out there and uh, yeah, I mean it would drive me nuts after awhile. Um, yeah. No, I'm not cut out for that fucking, uh, the kind of secrets I can keep our like, uh,

Speaker 6:          01:23:47       you know,

Speaker 7:          01:23:49       you know, it stays in the locker room kind of shit.

Speaker 6:          01:23:52       You know what I mean?

Speaker 7:          01:23:53       You live your life or you want to fucking live your life, you know, and until like if you're a look, if you porn shit into the water supply, you know, if you're dealing with stuff like that, if you fucking vandalizing the neighborhood I live in, then go fuck yourself. All right. But you know the other bullshit, I looked the other way, but if the, if I knew there was fucking aliens, yeah, no does look up to fucking stupid. There's no way they would tell it to me. If I was in the air force. How far into the air force you think I would get? Do you think I'd get anywhere beyond the guy with the two sticks guide in the fucking plane and

Speaker 6:          01:24:30       no. Okay. [inaudible]

Speaker 7:          01:25:06       Hey, what's up? It's a bill.

Speaker 9:          01:25:09       Um, and this is the Monday morning podcast. Hey, what's up? This is build bar, you know, like, it's going to be somebody else. On my own, my space page. Would you guys be disappointed if I did that? If I suddenly got an assistant, you know, the fuck would get an assistant for a podcast. All right, this is the deal. This is the Monday morning podcast. If you're new to my page, I do one of these every single Monday. People send me questions, they send me lists of stuff that they feel is overrated or underrated. They correct me when they feel that I say fucked up shit. And sometimes the, that causes an argument between listeners and um, yeah, so it's going to be a very subdued bill burr on this podcast. And you notice my voice is a little bit lower than it usually is that a lot of screaming, yelling this weekend at Caroline's comedy.

Speaker 9:          01:26:04       And uh, I'm going to go see ACDC tonight at the La Forum and then tomorrow morning I have to get up early because I'm shooting something. So I got this weird thing where I'm going to ACDC but I can't start screaming and yelling, you know, so I don't know what I'm going to do. What am I doing? They stopped playing the Jack. Am I going to lip sync? I'll do it like Brittany Spears and I'll put my fucking finger up to my ear and act like I'm trying to hit that note. You know? Um, I have a fucking crazy week and, um, I'm at the age now where I'm going to start drinking tea with a little bit of honey in it before every one of my shows because I don't what happens when I get tired. I start yelling from my throat rather from down below where it's supposed to be coming from.

Speaker 9:          01:26:55       And I fucking shred my voice a little bit. So, um, I really hope you're not new to my podcast because that was one of the fucking most boring minutes of my podcast, I think in the history of my podcasts as credible. Why don't you fucking dropped the energy through the God damn floor and let us hear about your medical problems. It was really fucking awful. But, um, yeah, so I got a huge week. I'm going to go see. Yeah, ACDC. And then later on, you know, I'm shooting some bullshit this week. And then after that, uh, I'm going on a vacation, I'm going on, I'm going to go see some hockey games up in Canada. Friday night I'm going to the Calgary cannot gang a catholic connect deep fucking calvary flames came and I think they're playing the Canucks, right? Or whereas Edmonton playing the Canucks, oh, Calgary's playing Florida.

Speaker 9:          01:27:44       Then I'm seeing, uh, Edmonton versus Vancouver and Edmonton Ed Northlands coliseum. And then I go over to fucking Vancouver. And um, if you're from up there and if you're from Alberta or the, uh, British Columbia and you can recommend some bars for me to hit before or after the games, let me know. Um, and uh, if you know some convenient hotels, that won't rape me because I've yet to get a fucking hotel. Typical fucking guy. I got the tickets first and then I'm dealing with all sorts of food and hotel shit later, which means basically I'll get to the airport and I'll be like, oh, what the fuck am I staying? Oh, there's a super rate. I'm sorry. There were all booked up. What do you mean you were all booked up? He had the fucking Alberta rough riders of whatever fucking CFL team that I've never heard of is in town playing for the Grey Cup.

Speaker 9:          01:28:41       I really don't know shit about Canada. My biggest, the only thing I don't like about this trip was I was hoping to drive from Edmonton over to Vancouver, but I just, it would just take forever because you've got to go through those mountains. But I wanted to go through them. I want to see, you know, uh, what toothless rednecks look like in a what mountain men looked like in, in uh, Canada. And then, you know, when you go to shit like that, she ended up seeing an animal you never seen before and the fucking freaks you out. You feel like Magellan or some shit. Like I'm on one time I was driving through Wyoming and I don't know what these animals are, but they look like good sales antelopes they look like some shit you'd see on the Serengeti. And I saw one and I started freaking freaking out by myself, screaming, pointing at it as I was driving by screaming, what the fuck is that like something or something was going to like the universe was going to answer me.

Speaker 9:          01:29:33       I just go, what the fuck is that? What the fuck? And I looked over at the guy, you know, I was kind of passing and he wasn't even looking at it. And I'm like, why? You know, he's not even excited about do with that fucking thing. What does that thing? And then I went over the hill and then there was a whole herd of them and I was like, oh, that's why that guy's not excited. These are like dead pigeons. He doesn't give a fuck. You probably annoyed by him. He's probably stepped in this shit at some point. His life maybe even fell down at the bus stop. First Day of school sneakers and have a clean again. He got a bad nickname. It comes old. Uh, you know, Allie fucking antelope, shit, you know, some sort of alliteration that remont red fucking went along with whatever kind of animal that once, you know, and then that name just sticks and it actually affects the level of policy that you're going to get, you know?

Speaker 9:          01:30:20       And he always told himself, I'm getting the fuck out of this state, man. I'm getting the fuck out of this state. How the hell am I going to get laid with antelope? Shit is a fucking nickname. You know, it's not going to happen. I need to go south. I need to go to Greeley, Colorado. And even if I'm called fucking antelope shit, the smell from that slaughterhouse down there, nobody's going to care. Nobody that greatly. And it Kenny Colorado listeners, this is the Shit I learned on the, on. I go on the road in Greeley, Colorado, they have this huge slaughterhouse up there and uh, it lingers in the air and some days when they killed too many fucking, they slaughter too many. Uh, whatever the fuck they, I guess steer. Um, people actually call up, they call bad smell days and then they call up the the slaughterhouse and said, Hey, can you, can you fucking lay off?

Speaker 9:          01:31:13       Can you lay off to slaughter a little bit? And I don't know what they do with the count. Like one Mississippi, maybe they choke out of pheasant. Speaking of stairs, I was in New York City last week and Oh, and if you don't know where to steer is a steer is a, I believe it's a bowl with no balls and something else I learned when I was driving on the road. I'm like, all right, that's a cow. That's a bowl. What the fuck is that? Someone's like a steer. I'm like, what the fuck has this stare? And they told me, he said that's a bold, doesn't know his balls. And unlike what, why is that? And I think it had to do something with hamburgers.

Speaker 9:          01:31:49       I think that's what it is. I think that's how they make beef. They have both fuck cows. I'm going to be wrong here. I think the bowls fuck the cows. And then they used the cows give birth and it's either a cow or a bull, but you know, if they want to make the bowl, the hamburger meat or steak, you know, they cut his balls off and he just stands around like, oh great, you know, like that fucking unfunny caveman and those Geico commercials, those Geico commercials don't even make sense anymore. He's like, oh, I get it. You know something, something. But I get it and he walks away. It's like, you know what dude? I don't get it. I don't get it. I don't get the whole fucking thing. I don't get how there's some hot chick giving you attention. And then she has a Geico key chain and you, you can't handle that.

Speaker 9:          01:32:39       I can save if you're a woman, that would be a deal breaker because you'd have control over your fucking pussy. But if you're a guy you don't have control over your Dick. So you know what I mean? She could actually do wearing a fuck cavemen. I hate fucking cavemen tee shirt, but if she wasn't wearing a bra, it'd be like, all right, well, you know, simple equation. I'll just bend her over and I'll hate fucker. So anyway, so I'm in a New York City, I'm in New York and all somebody asked me that day after you say something funny, what is that clicking noise? I Dunno if I'm just on a bad phone. It's probably me laughing. I don't think it sounds like clicking noises. Um, anyways, Jesus Christ's they'll get to the fucking point. So I'm in New York City and I'm working Carolines and a buddy of mine, uh, always goes to the steak steakhouse, Smith and Lewinsky.

Speaker 9:          01:33:28       Uh, Willinsky some 49th and third is like, yeah, there's a guy that works up there. He's a big fanny stuff. You should come by and you know, I'm like, fuck yeah, definitely. I'll go up there. You know, I love going to steak houses. That's one of the few places you can actually feel like a man. It's like old school, you know, you fucking, it's like classy. You're not like a, it's not like that hacky shit. You know what I mean? Like, you know, these punks who sit there and they watch a couple of rat pack videos, then they go out and they buy themselves a suit and they start walking around thinking that they're recreating the rat pack when there's just something too glossy about the way they're doing it. You know, I don't know if it's their manicured eyebrows or wherever the fuck guys are doing nowadays, but they did.

Speaker 9:          01:34:14       They can't fucking pull it off. But when you're going into those, those steak houses that had been there for awhile, they got a lot of waiters who've been there forever. So they organically bring that vibe and you raise up to their level, you know what I mean? To come to the table. They have the females order first, that old school class. Classy Shit. You know, I dunno. I like it. So anyway, so like fucking go in there and you guys, if you've been listening to my podcast, you know, whenever I get sick, I, uh, imitate that guy. Um, a ray Winston from, uh, when stone or whatever from fucking sexy beast, my favorite movie ever. You know, the beginning of the movie where he's like, Eh, I'm sweating roasted bacon boiling. It's like a sauna. That bullshit. I fucking loved that movie as my favorite movie.

Speaker 9:          01:35:07       So I'm in this fucking steak house and I look over and I'm looking at this fucking guy and I can tell he's somebody, but he's got these big, I'm a producer glasses on. I thought it was Mickey worked for half a fucking second cause I'm real bad at that shit. And uh, and with like, you know my girl and a couple other people and they look over, they go, that's fucking, that's your boy there from the movie that's fucking now wedding. And I don't know what happened. A little hung over, sorry. He goes out to have a cigarette or a fag is they call an ace fucking standing out there and he's out there with fucking teddy bass. Mr. Black Magic. Fucking what's his face? He and Mccallum. Is that his name? I'm so bad with, I'm watching that movie fucking 900 times. I stole another God damn names.

Speaker 9:          01:35:54       He's standing there and the director, all his shit. And, uh, I was like, you gotta be fucking kidding me. So my buddies, like, we gotta go out there and we got to get them, we got to get a picture with them. And I'm like, Nah, man, I'm not going to bug those guys. I saw him. That's enough for me. I see him, I'm not going to bug them. And he's like, dude, you fucking kidding me. You fucking kidding me. That's not like it's, it's fucking, uh, Ashton Kutcher. Those are real fucking, you know, great actors. The guy was in the fucking depart. It stopped being a Douche. Let's go. So I said fuck. And I went out there and they ended up being in a hot shit and they were, I guess there's another sexy beast coming out. I Dunno. They will fucking cool as hell.

Speaker 9:          01:36:35       And uh, I don't know. I'm going to post the picture on it at some point up on my website, but I got to meet like half the cast from sexy beast and I ate a steak. You know what I mean? Fucking doesn't get any better than that. It's like one of those old Milwaukee brew commercials and now, right. There's no other fucking those commercials when it doesn't get any better than this or was that Bush, you know, it doesn't get any better than this. You know, we're a bunch of guys. There's no broads around. We're sitting in the woods. How could I not get any better than that? Well, because basically I think we've gotten enough pussy in our lives and now we just find females irritating. That's the only way I could ever make any sense out of that commercial. Cause other than that, you're outside.

Speaker 9:          01:37:16       You shouldn't in the woods in this mosquitoes. And uh, she there with five guys, you know, one of them you didn't want to come along, but someone else liked them. Yeah. Which is probably why you're drinking. All right, let's get one with the questions for this week. The subdued podcasts, the easy listening podcast here and now behave. I'm paying for your meal. All right, question number one, Bill. If you've died in some fucked up, but still really funny way if you died in some relief and some fucked up, but really funny way. How long do you think it would be before your other comedian friends would start busting your balls either in own standup act? So just in public, even though that would be kind of comfy. How long til that fucking too soon period was over? Well, if I'm dead, I don't think that they would be able to break my balls, but I know what you mean.

Speaker 9:          01:38:09       Um, I would say pretty much after a day and a half, someone would make the first joke and a then it would just be open season because then the other comics would try to top what the other comic said. And, uh, I dunno, outsiders would view that as insensitive, but I've always been fascinated how people don't realize that, you know, comedians always have a joke no matter what the tragedy is and they think it's because comedians are insensitive assholes. I mean, there is an element of truth to that, but I'm making a joke when something bad happened is also a way, uh, it's like a defensive mechanism where you like, oh my God, I'm feeling sad. I don't want to feel this feeling. And then you just say something ridiculous. Everybody laughs. It gets rid of the tension. You know, it's not, they don't give a fuck, but, uh, sometimes they don't.

Speaker 9:          01:39:01       And I got to have made, if I did die in a really stupid way, uh, I would be disappointed if people didn't, uh, you know, trashed me till the end of the time at Jesus Christ. What? I'm trying to think of a stupid waste of die and I don't want to do that for fucking chinks of myself. All right. Question number two, pay bill. I've been wanting to get into standup since I was 20 years old. I've been a huge pussy for the past three years, so I've just been writing jokes and not performing them because I'm too scared to go through with it. Eventually I'm gonna man up and do it. But now I have the problem of having a three year stockpile of jokes. How do I decide which ones to do for my five minutes at the stress factory? Um, I don't know. I would tick, you know, some shit euro recently cause I figure you've been writing for three years. You probably just getting better at it. And plus if you're doing topical material, I don't think anybody gives a shit about, uh, I dunno what was topical three years ago? 2008 minus 2005. Oh, what's up with John? Kerry is guy's face. He's lugging it to fuck a peak. [inaudible]

Speaker 9:          01:40:22       this guy knows what I'm talking about. Asking you back me up now to just fucking don't put that pressure on yourself. Just write five minutes to ship that you think is funny the first time you go on stage. I always tell this to people has nothing to do with how good or bad you do. It's just all about having the balls to go up there when they call your name, worry about what the fuck you're doing. You know, after you've done it two, three times, you know what I mean? Then start to, you know, cause you know you're literally, you just jump in the deep end. He just tried to swim to the side. You know, just make it to the end of his set it. Don't worry about it. Don't worry about it seriously too and just always know the worst you bomb, the better the story is.

Speaker 9:          01:41:02       That's it. When comedians sit around, we don't tell stories about killing me talk. We sit around talking about the night we ate our balls in front of a, I dunno, a bunch of navy seals that have corporate party on a battleship or some dumb shit. I don't fuck it. You'll be fine. You'll be fine. Just grabbed the mic and fucking talk about what you think is funny and if you'd bombs, just make fun of yourself and then tell people to go fuck themselves and say thank you. Good night. That's my first set advice. All right, number three. Hey Bill. Lately I haven't been flexing a ton of girth and the flux autometer and my house keeps going off. I think this is a vaguely sort of a Dick joke here. Any tips for keeping my girth more stealth when I flex it? Maybe a stealth flex or flex silencer.

Speaker 9:          01:41:51       Any idea if these products exist? So do you have any other tips so that I can flex more quietly? I'm just trying to flex my girth more stealth, you know? Yeah, absolutely. Well, you've got to stop wearing those fucking, you know, Joey Ramone genes where people know exactly how excited you are. You know, I would go more with some a 50 cent, what does he rough rider or whatever the fuck his policies called. Yeah. It just gets your, get some different genes. Yes. Stop back like you were in the strokes, you know, fucking loosen up your genes and you can have a full on fucking woody and no one's ever going to know. Definitely do not wear sweat pants and a or a short shorts. You know, sitting down also helps, especially if you're at a desk. Other than that you and your girth and run your own. All right. You see that she knew my podcast. She liked the wide variety of questions.

Speaker 9:          01:42:48       Anyways, question number four. Hey Bill, do you think the media has ever treated Donovan Donovan McNabb fairly. I mean, the guys put up great stats over the years and led his team to, for NFC championships and won Superbowl. It every year he gets bashed for something. Why does the media go after the idiots of the league? Why doesn't immediate go after the idiots of the league instead of players who stay out of trouble? Uh, I don't know. You know what? I honestly don't know. I didn't know Donovan Mad got more shit than usual. I know that fat Jack Ass from the radio trashed him that one time. And I know tio gave him shit, but I always looked at Donovan that he was a, he's a professional, handle this shit. Well never throws a temper tantrum and uh, I dunno, it might have to do with, uh, Philly fans. You know, they got that, they got that short fuse.

Speaker 9:          01:43:43       I Dunno, you know, something. I don't know. I never looked at Dunham McNabb like he was treated unfairly and no, I guess, uh, he just had a couple of really high profile douchebags give him shit and a really bad way and uh, you know, he handled it well. He never really lashed out back. He just was like, Hey, you know, that's what they're, so what they're doing. I'm going to go get some soup. You know? I don't know. That was the worst fucking answer have I have, I have no idea. I don't fucking know. I have no idea. But thank you for asking. Thank you for thinking. I actually could answer that question intelligently and thank you for exposing me on how fucking ignorant I am on the whole Donovan McNabb crisis. Okay. Question number five. Hey Bill, I've been listening to your podcast for about half, half year now.

Speaker 9:          01:44:30       Bout it should say a half, about a half a year. Now. I don't think you've ever addressed this. Okay. What does that jerk off? Oh, this is the question. What is, what does that jerk off slash rapid tapping noise you make just after you met? Make a salient point or a particularly funny joke. For some reason that sound grates on me. Like somebody raking their teeth on a blackboard. You know, I never listened to my podcast. I think it's just me laughing and I have a shitty cell phone so maybe it doesn't pick it up right? I don't have no fucking idea. What? I'm sorry. A grates on you. Like somebody's raking their teeth on a blackboard. Jesus Christ. Fucking brutal image. All right, now I'm self conscious. I won't ever laugh again during my podcasts. Is that what you do? Huh? You know, you walk around miserable and you tried to suck the joy out other people's lives. You know, I think it's time you might want to sit down in the mirror and you know, take a little stock in yourself. All right, question number six. I don't know what it is. Dude. I have no idea and I'm not going to look into it, so I don't know what to tell you. Um, question number six. Hey belt. First off, great job in the podcast. I think it's cool that you're using this technology to spread more predictable mediocrity.

Speaker 9:          01:45:45       Oh Jesus Christ. I'm getting trashed. Let me read that again so you guys can enjoy that pounding. That was funny. All right. First off, great job in the podcast. I think it's cool that you use technology to spread more predictable mediocrity than would have been ever been possible 10 years ago. Guilty as charged fucking son of a bitch. Second question second. Here's the question. When should I shave my head? I note that you have dealt with the old receding hairline by trying your damn this to look like Billy Corgan. Jesus Christ. I'm getting roasted here. I suffer from the same affliction and my plan is to sort of keep cutting it shorter and shorter until eventually take it to the scalp. My hairline is about three and a half inches from my eyebrows now and I'm using the number four God on the clippers. Any suggestion? I think he got the right idea.

Speaker 9:          01:46:37       You know what, and I applaud you for man and up not doing that. Rogaine crap. You know? Or having some hair yanked out of the back of your scalp and stapled on top of your fucking head, you know, man up like fucking telly Savalas you know, I dunno. I Dunno. I Dunno what to tell you. Yeah. As it gets shorter and shorter, you just keep cutting it down. I don't know why guys go through all that. I, you know, I've actually heard when people get hair plugs, it can actually still continue to fall out and I eat now you can't shave your head because you've got this Frankenstein scar in the back of your head. This guy I know who will remain nameless, he recently got a hair transplant. I never knew what the fucking difference between hair plugs and a hair transplant, but evidently a hair transplant, they literally cut a swag one inch long on the back of your head and take all that hair out.

Speaker 9:          01:47:34       And that's what they use to put on top of your head. And I guess the skin on your scouts a little bit loose. So then what they do with, now that you got that one inch, um, stretch your skin. Now the back of your head, they basically then push the skin together and then they sew it shut. And uh, I don't know about you, but that sounds pretty fucking terrific when you can basically shave your head and about three, I don't know, three minutes she'd done silver and people look at you like, what the fuck for two minutes. And then they can't remember you the other way unless you have a half hour HBO special that reoccurs every fucking six months. Um, okay. Anyways, this is the rest of it. He says, I've been listening to you since you first parents on our own Hay and I got to see you live in Houston.

Speaker 9:          01:48:23       Atlanta. I liked your comedy and I'm pulling for you to blow up even bigger next time in your Atlanta. If you still want to know how to use a shotgun, I'll teach you what I know. Apps, the fucking lovely. See that guy's odd shit. See that guy's an old school guy and see what he did. He broke my balls. Gimme a couple of good jabs to the face and he slaps me on the back. Hey, just fucking with you. I like your comedy. Let me teach you how to shoot a gun right there. I bet that guy eats in a steak house. All right, question number seven a bell. I've been listening to your podcasts ever since you did a show at Embry riddle, that shitty little aviation school in Arizona. I like that place. I liked it. I was fascinated by the level of intelligence that you guys actually, literally, you literally had rocket science to there.

Speaker 9:          01:49:11       Right? And you guys knew, understood about fucking arrows, space science, technology fucking thing. I don't know what it was. I was blown away by. Um, God, I'm a moron. All right. Um, you've mentioned that you're a big sports fan and that you have the NHL package as a fellow hockey fan. Do you feel the national coverage that pro hockey gets is fair? I see highlights on sports center that lasts about 30 seconds. They'd rather talk about dumb, pointless shit like tls comments after a game and talk about it for 30 minutes. So show pro bowling or women's college volleyball and, and give you a pro hockey. I'm more than a minute of their time. What, what's the deal with that? Um, all right, there's a lot of questions in there. Um, let's see. Let's get back to these. Do I feel the national coverage that pro hockey gets is fair?

Speaker 9:          01:50:01       Um, yeah, I do. Because I think hockey is a rogue sport and I like it like that. I, I liked that it's not at the same level of disgusting exposure that hockey, baseball and basketball are at. Um, because I think that those three sports suffer from them just trying to cross pollinate and cross promote and just make people who aren't into sports watch sports and people who watch sports and don't give a fuck about the Jonas brothers watched the Jonas brothers play at halftime or Brittany Spears or any of that other shit or those dumb TV shows they try to promote during the games. Just trying to have that orgy of horse shit that they always try to do. I can't stand that shit. So I liked it. Nobody likes hockey. I really like it. And I liked the, um, I like that people don't get why people fight in hockey.

Speaker 9:          01:50:59       Um, I love all of that shit. I just think it's a great fucking game and I think it deserves to be up in Canada and in the north northern part of this country and people who give the get it, watch it and those who don't can ask their same little faggy questions of, you know, I ain't just so you know, the fighting and the fighting is so fucking great. Every other sports there's such an unbelievable level of shit talking that you can get away with. Cause the second people start throwing punches, you'll hold teammate jumps in. You know what I mean? It was like back in the day, if you had to fight some kid after school and you knew you were going to get your ass kicked, the best move you could make was start swinging in the hallways because the teachers were going to run out and break it up before anything ever happened.

Speaker 9:          01:51:45       And by then you're down the office and they say, if you guys fight again, we're going to fucking expel you. And now you've got your out. That's what those other three sports are. You know what I mean? You have a seat. The basketball players try to fight. They throw punches like they're trying to throw somebody out from the fucking warning track of three rivers stadium. They throw like that dead Dave Parker overhand right. I saw shat through that. He threw eat, fucking eat through it. Like I'm in a long time ago, said Damon Wayans imitating a big black girl fighting. And that's the way Shaq threw a punch. He fucking, it was pathetic and he missed the guy. Any fucking missed them. Um, you know, I love hockey. If you're a cunt, you get the shit kicked out of you and the guy only has to sit down for five minutes for the simple fact that he beat up a con.

Speaker 9:          01:52:33       You know, I don't understand why it's so difficult to understand. You know, there's boxing. Boxing is a sport and that is fighting and um, hockey, part of the sport is fighting. That's a part of the sport. If you don't like it, watch diving or something else. All right. I totally got off track there. Um, why do I do? Um, and also, you know, something I liked the, I think ESPN doesn't show it because they lost their contract with the NHL, so they're kind of pissed about it. So they're like, fine, we're trying to have our little new world order monopoly on all sports and you don't want to play ball, so fuck you. We won't show your highlights. So instead they show nine hours of poker. Is there anybody really watching that anymore? That shit was literally fascinating for like the first six months and then, you know, now I don't give a shit, you know, until this stupid nicknames and their little fucking stupid glasses they call them snake has, he's out of Arizona and he weren't fucking, I don't give a shit, you know, ed moneymaker, whatever the fuck they call themselves.

Speaker 9:          01:53:40       It's gay. It's really gates horrifically out of shape people. And I don't give a fuck if the river cards coming. Um, so there you go there. To answer your question, I don't know. I don't know. Yeah. And Hl. We'll never get it's NHL gets the level of exposure is fucking deserves. They've tried everything to get people into it. They remember that when they had that little gay little fucking flame coming out of the back of the puck for people who couldn't see it, that didn't work. They tried everything and they should just accept the fact that they are, you know, just just be able to fuck you are stop trying to be fucking something for everybody. You know those other sports. I mean the NFL is annoying. I don't like on the NFL, they're trying to fucking deliberately make me get a dish because it keeps showing cool games on Thursdays and they won't show it to me.

Speaker 9:          01:54:33       And let's say you have a dish, you know, I don't, I don't respond to terrorism just like this country. I do not respond to it. They'll fuck yourself. Sticking with cable. Question Eight. Well what is this? The last question too, by the way, it's getting kind of long hitter. What is your opinion on the Christmas specials? On TV? My wife is like, let's watch some Christmas specials. Well, I guess I'm supposed to do my girl voice said my wife is like, let's let some Christmas special. I can't fucking stand them all. I want to shoot Santa Rudolph and Tim Allen in the fucking head, but I don't, but I don't say that cause I want to stay married also. What is your favorite hockey rink? Hockey memory. I'm a big hockey fan. Love the podcasts. Um, all right. What is my opinion of Christmas specials? Um, I haven't watched them in 20 years and I'm watching them Michelle, cause I'm trying to get into the spirit and I'm actually enjoying him.

Speaker 9:          01:55:23       Son of them are better than others. Um, I liked the one where Burl Ives sinks have a Holly jolly Christmas as the snowman. Um, I like that shit. I actually decorated my apartment. I went all out this year, so I don't, I don't mind them, but if it depends on how annoying your wife is every, if every five seconds she's like, then yeah, that would, that would annoy the shit out of me. I know. I don't know, Dude. I don't know what to tell you. Just fucking, you know what he'd do? This is what you do. He said, yeah, let's get into the Christmas spirit. You get some eggnog and you put a bunch of booze in it and then you'll start equating the Christmas specials with boozing and not having to listen to your wife. And uh, maybe you'll start looking forward to them. You know, they'll probably start, you know, watching the great pumpkin in October. Okay. Oh wait, there was one other fucking question I didn't get to. Somebody sent me a really good question about the hype on Britney Spears. Where the fuck can I put that?

Speaker 9:          01:56:30       What's going on here? All right. Let me read some old rate on the under and I got to find this last question real quick. All right. Overweight if number one. Um, I know if you knew one of my podcast people send me their list of shit that they feel is overrated and their list of shit that they think is underrated. Alright. Overrated. The bcs standings. Every year people complain and beg for a playoff system. Not even our president. Now, even our plight president, Alexis, we should have a playoff system. Do you ever think these rich pricks will allow it to happen? Um, no and I don't think they should have a playoff system. Um, just for the simple fact that you can blow out your knee and end your career and they're basically playing for free other than bullshit money that they get from a college boosters.

Speaker 9:          01:57:15       Is that what they call them? No, I don't think they should play more games. I liked that everybody gets all pissed at the end of the fucking year. There's 9,000 fucking teams. What do you want? They do the best they can. It works for me. I don't care when I liked it. Someone's always pissed in the end as a nice level of controversy. I think they kind of have a playoff system with bcs. They just need to expand it to 14. That's all. And if anybody complains after that, they, you know, they can go fuck themselves. They go, problem solved. Um, actually I'm going to the Rose Bowl, this shift, not bragging, but I'm going to write up the fucking street now to NFL overtime, uh, first and thinks this is overrated. How is it exciting scene teams when it with the field goal in overtime? How bad of a reader in my, I'm like, how is it exciting seeing teens, what it with a field goal trying to read this most smoother.

Speaker 9:          01:58:06       How is it exciting seeing teams when it with the field golden over time or even tie like the eagles verse the Bangles. Uh, they should take a lesson from college football and make their overtime just like there, it would be a lot more exciting. Um, um, I don't know. I liked that they're different. I really don't have a problem. I don't have a problem with college football or pro football. I just have a problem with the fucking NFL trying to make me buy a dish. But, um, I guess it would be more exciting if they could have half a field and they just keep going at it. Um, I dunno. I just think it gets back to that thing again. Now you're dealing with even older football players and they could get the shit kicked out of them and blow out there. Fucking the, I have no idea.

Speaker 9:          01:58:50       You guys are really asking me a lot of fucking, not too difficult questions, but for some reason I can't fucking answer them this week. I'll wait a second. Wearing God's name was this question. This guy sent me, God dammit. You know what? I can basically paraphrase it. This kid was asking me, Oh this guy, this gentleman who was female, I can't remember who wrote it, was basically saying, what's with all this talk about Brittany Spears coming back. People are actually really buying into it. I don't understand what the big deal is. People were saying she's crazy. Just cause you shave your head, it doesn't mean you fucking crazy. So I dunno. What do you think? It's like a big media ploy. I have no idea. All I know is that I, when I think somebody is music sucks, I don't care about their comeback. You know, kind of like Madonna.

Speaker 9:          01:59:45       Madonna has a couple of the tunes. But other than that, you know, I, I don't understand what the big deal is just, I mean, granted you gotta give her credit every five years. She comes up with a new way to fucking dress like a horse. You got to give her that. Um, but I really think it's time for her to, uh, you know, put some more clothes on than I talk about that last week. What have I happened to? Elegance. You know what I mean? Blake, women in their forties and 50s can, can, can be beautiful, but not if they dress like they're 18. Same thing with guys that just comes that point where you've got to stop wearing your how Colgan fucking wife beater. You know, at that point, you know, you know, you got your fucking flabby grandmother arms. It's just not going to work out.

Speaker 9:          02:00:35       People in their forties and 50s need to wear more clothes. They need to look classy. That's what you in your class a year, you're older, you're wiser. You know what I mean? You can't fucking sit there. Uh, it's weird cause Madonna is in great shape, but like this is still 50. You're a shredded 50 year old, put on some fucking pants. Jesus Christ. Get a skirt down to your knees. At least, you know, I, I don't understand it. And like, uh, now that I'm on the subject, the plastic surgery, I saw an interview the other day with her, you know, it's just, I don't know. What did she do to her fucking face? It was like you looked normal and I don't get that. Like you, you look your age. Okay. You look, you looked 48 two years ago and now two years later, now you look like a, a 33 year old alien.

Speaker 9:          02:01:30       I mean, I mean, is that, what the fuck? I don't know. That's basically they don't have it down yet. I don't know. A few people have noticed, you know, with the plastic you want to get a tummy tuck or get your ankles and large to whatever the fuck people are doing. Any of that shit below the neck. I guess I can kind of understand it. But if the face they don't have to face down, I didn't think they have the other shit down. It's just that when I talked to somebody, I don't stare at their fucking stomach, you know? But if they're wearing a half shirt and that's where that fucking mouth was, I would be looking at the stomach going, Oh god, why did they do that? I don't fucking know. So basically what I think about the Brittany Spears thing, I honestly, I don't give a shit.

Speaker 9:          02:02:12       I don't give a shit. I don't give a shit about, you know, people who basically, you know, you want to run with no underwear on. Yeah. Now the Paparazzi falls you around. But even then, I don't even believe that. I think you fucking called them and let them, let them know, hey, I don't make God, I'm going down to Starbucks and I maybe forgot my panties. I like, I like the fucking Paparazzi gets this credit, like, like they have like this Pentagon ability, you know what I mean? Like they're tracking her on her cell phone. Did Not, there were a bunch of fucking, I don't know what the fuck they are, but I'm not buying it. Oh, you know what isn't as convenient. Here's a telephone call. And let's just, when I was going to end the podcast. All right, well, thanks for listening and I will talk to you guys next week. Have a great week.

Speaker 6:          02:02:55       And, uh, so [inaudible].
