Speaker 1:          00:00:02       Hey, what's going on is bill burr and it's the Monday morning podcast for Monday, April 1st, 2013 that's right everybody, it's April fool's day. Holy Shit. Is this podcast going to be wacky? Is he going to pull a prank? Is He pranking us right now? Is that his voice? I would tell you guys how much I fucking hate this day. You know what I mean? Back when I was in the Matrix and I actually had a day job and I was a productive member of society, you know, and I actually used to sit there and I'd go to fucking work every God damn day and every once in a while at the end of the day they'd say some shit like, ah, you know, we'd appreciate it. It's not mandatory, but we would appreciate it if you guys could hang around for a couple minutes after five today we'd like to talk about a summary of our productivity goals in the upcoming quarter. And I would actually hang out going, I got to do this. I, I gotta I gotta I gotta put on, I, uh, I got to put on a, you know, I've gotta be a team player here and I would sit there and listen to these fucking suits, you know,

Speaker 1:          00:01:19       talking about a, you know, unloading trucks or whatever the fuck they were talking about it. Oh, that is interesting. All that's great. Oh, are we going to upgrade to the electronic fucking Pallet Jacks, Pallet Jacks? And we said Palliate Jackson is like fucking 25 years. We were all excited. Wow. They really give a shit about us now. They know. They just worried they're going to get sued because the fucking coke had just blew out his God damn back. You know? And then they're like, well, what if everybody blows out their backs? How do we avoid debt? What is going to be cheaper paying their workman's comp or actually getting them the proper equipment? Um, so anyways, this stupid fucking April fool's jokes, right? I say hate those fucking God damned. You know, what I hated about it was half the people who would get you, they weren't funny and they their, this is their idea.

Speaker 1:          00:02:13       You know, it'd be like, they'd be like, you be like, Hey, do you know where the pens are? Yeah, they're in there. They're right in that drawer. And then you opened, they're like, hey bro, ah, actually this one over here, I just got, um, I got him with an April fool, Ya know? And You wonder why officers get shot up, you know, just what it is. It's not because a sociopath's it's not because of, um, um, um, relaxed gun control laws. It's not because any of that shit, it's because of some stupid April fool's joke that someone won't let go. And the talking shit about it still in June, you know? And then somebody just finally snaps and they come in there and they mowed out a bunch of people and it's considered a tragedy. And it is, unless you're into the environment and you look at it a different way and you're like, well, you know, as tragic as everything that just happened is day's going to be a whole lot, a whole lot less people drop and doses in that building that will end up in the water supply. Do you know I went to the grocery store the other day, people, oh yeah, I'm not a vampire. I need food and I fucking walk. I'm walking in there and there's some fucking green peace guy with a clipboard and he's singing like R and B shit.

Speaker 2:          00:03:43       And

Speaker 1:          00:03:44       I didn't want to hit him. I just had to get away from him. Like it was literally effecting how I was walking. He was just singing. He was, I dunno what, like he was trying to audition and save the environment all at the same fucking time. He was singing some song and at one point he went like, Whoa Dude, that fucking that R and B, you know, let me hold this note like I'm getting tickled. I'm sorry folks. I did a benefit in a fucking mind this weekend and I'm a little fucking, I'm a little, I'm a little,

Speaker 2:          00:04:21       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:04:21       Oh, I feel like fucking shit people. I caught one of these, one of these super Coles. Did you guys have it? Did you get a chance to listen to me? Last week on the Joe Rogan experience, I might've mentioned that I was starting to get sick. That was the day when I did Joe Rogan's podcast and I forgot that the guy does an 18 hour podcast. You know, I'm thinking like, all right, I'll go over there. They'll be done in about 90 minutes. I'll come back here, get myself a little bit of Robitussin, chase it with a little bit of Nyquil, do a line of blow, you know, fucking stare down the cold, wide awake and then that'll be it. And no, that's not what happened. I did a three and a half hour podcasts with Rogan. Yo, what's amazing about two Rogan's podcast is three and a half fucking hours long and it feels like 20 minutes,

Speaker 2:          00:05:09       you know,

Speaker 1:          00:05:12       until he gets to the last 20 minutes. Then he just like, dude, I can't fucking talk anymore. And he may just think about Rogen is if, I think if you didn't bring it up that you were three and a half hours in, he would do another three and a half hours. Um, but I had a great time on that one and um, I sounded extra dumb on that because Rogan actually reads, you know, I sound dumb enough when I'm just by myself, but when I'm actually on a podcast with somebody who's actually a well read guy, you know, my level of stupidity really gets fucking exposed to an even higher level. So, um,

Speaker 2:          00:05:51       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:05:52       Anyways. Yeah, I've been sick for like four fucking days. I didn't actually then take any and I didn't take any cold medicine because every fucking cold medicine I looked at said may do permanent liver damage. So it was like, all right, well let's do the math here. I either go fucking two, three days of hell and then I'm fine or I fucking pussy out of three days of hell in the trade off is permanent fucking liver damage. Right. How fucking dumb would that be? You know, if you take cold medicine, you're a fucking pussy is basically what I'm saying. Nah, that's not true. That's not true. Cause you know what, I don't have to fucking go to work. You guys do. And how many sick days can really use, especially if you're a woman, you know,

Speaker 1:          00:06:41       if you get knocked up and you're already, how many days did they give you for that? It's so fucking pathetic in this country that like you ever see, I don't know other countries like how much time you get off and then people like, yeah, but they pay like fucking, you know, nine 90% taxes in that country. Yes. So what at least they get something for their fucking taxes. What the fuck are we getting in this country? Oh, I got my two by four out of the angry voter. Everybody. Um, despite the fact that I was as sick as I was, I was sick as a dog man. I, uh,

Speaker 1:          00:07:21       I still got the windows tinted on my car. I got a couple of things done. You know what's funny was, ah, the lovely, beautiful and talented Nia was actually leaving town on Wednesday and came back yesterday and I got sick literally Tuesday night and I was sick the whole fucking time. I was so fucking excited that, you know, that like excited she was going to be leaving and I was just excited that, you know, she wasn't going to be here, you know, match madness, you know, watch the fucking basketball and have the fellas over, right. Fucking barbecue, drink some beers, right? I was going to have a great time, great fucking time. And then I got this God damn tsunami of a fucking cold and a dude. It really wiped me out.

Speaker 3:          00:08:13       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:08:14       Two days. I was just laying on the couch. It's going, really, are you fucking key? This is a cold. This is what, this is what a cold is in 2013, dude, my fucking hair hurt. I thought it was because I was dehydrated. Just started sucking down water and all it did was make me gag. You know, it hurts to move my eyes. I can't move my eyes, man. Um, was it was fucking brutal. So I toughed it out and I still got, I got the windows tinted. Oh, my car. And uh, that was hilarious. And went down there, I went to this fucking place where it's like, do you guys like tint windows and also torture people in the back room? You know, one of those really shady, I didn't go down to the dealership because I knew they were going to charge me like fucking 500 bucks to have the official Toyota of tint on the windows. I'm like, fuck this, let me just get this guy to do it for a buck and a quarter. Um,

Speaker 3:          00:09:09       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:09:10       So I go in there, right. And then obviously English as a second language for this guy, you know, and um,

Speaker 3:          00:09:17       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:09:18       I'm sure I could've had my pick of women to, if I actually went into that back room. It just seemed like one of those things, I just felt like I was in the second season of the wire, you know, like there was going to be some big cargo tin with a bunch of dead hookers in it in the back. But anyways, that's none of my business. I'm just here to get my windows tinted on my fucking hybrid. So, uh, I say to the guy, a guide, I want the back windows as dark as I can possibly get them, cause my dog rides back there and she's always pen to beat the fucking band. I'd like her to be cooler. And then up front, you know, the darker side can get. And then I was like, wait a minute, wait, we're waiting. Might Go, you know, my girl Kinda stinks it drive. And so I don't want it so dark that she can't see other cars. And he laughs, you know, this fucking eastern European black market fucking laugh. And he goes, all right, we'll do the 35% and then we'll do the UV rays up front. And I'm like, great. So

Speaker 1:          00:10:16       yeah, Yada a, he does them enough. They, they, they look fucking phenomenal.

Speaker 3:          00:10:21       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:10:21       So I'm recovering the next fucking two more days of this bullshit, right? I finally come around yesterday and a, I'm feeling good and I know knee is on the way home. So what do I do? I fucking clean up the Goddamn House.

Speaker 3:          00:10:37       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:10:38       That's a big thing you have to do when you fucking woman leaves town. When she comes back, the place has to look even fucking better. It has to look fucking great. And there's got to be food in the fridge. Okay. Why? Because out of respect, no out of love. No.

Speaker 3:          00:10:59       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:10:59       The why would you do it, bill? I'll tell you why. Because you can't fucking,

Speaker 3:          00:11:04       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:11:05       You can't give them that fucking power that they feel like you're an absolute fucking moron.

Speaker 3:          00:11:11       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:11:12       If they're not there, you know, they stuck feeling that after a while, because you know, when you fucking live with somebody, like a woman, they basically decide where everything goes. That's like shit that you both use and you're a guy and you don't give a fuck. Right? So every fucking time you gotta be like, yeah, where's the salad spool? Where the fuck is this? Where the fuck is that? And then they get to be like the fucking chick on a, on a sitcom. Right? Well, my husband, he's a fucking moron, right? So I didn't want to have her that I didn't want her to have that fucking victory. I vacuumed. I did have the, took the trash out at everything. Just looking fucking spotless.

Speaker 3:          00:11:53       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:11:53       You going to come home? Look at me like I'm a fucking moron.

Speaker 3:          00:11:57       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:11:57       Well honey, the place looks great. Yeah, I met you when I was 36. I know how to make toast. All right. Get over yourself. I was actually cleaning up so well was like, she's gonna think I cheated on her or something. This is like, this is getting fucking ridiculous. What'd you vacuum for you getting rid of the fucking straight pubis is, uh, this is the Monday morning podcast. Everybody. Um, now that would have been, that would have said if I actually cheated on her, what a fucking piece of shit, first of all. And then second of all, like, um, I would have a sex addiction if I actually did that because of how fucking sick, sick I was. You know, if I should bagged one of those fucking eastern European horrors that I know we're locked in the back of that tinted out fucking place. Um, you know, it's funny. It was, we, she gets home. All right? And within, within an hour we get where we were in a fight because I told the story about getting the windows tinted like an asshole. I wasn't even thinking and I mentioned to the fact that I said she wasn't the greatest driver and I heard her feelings.

Speaker 3:          00:13:04       Okay,

Speaker 1:          00:13:05       you said that you don't think I'm a good driver.

Speaker 3:          00:13:09       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:13:09       Oh Jesus Christ. And that's one of those ones where you just got to be like, okay, ah, Bill, you're an idiot. Why did you say that? You know, I'm still pissed that she got pissed about that.

Speaker 3:          00:13:21       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:13:21       You know, that would be like if she told one of her friends that I'm not a good dancer, and then I was like, you told her go to. Yeah, Bill, you suck. Suck it dancing. You know Jesus fucking Christ.

Speaker 3:          00:13:38       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:13:39       I was fucking kills me about fucking women. It's like they, they, even when they know they stink at something, if you say they stick at something, they get, they get all fucking offended. You said the truth. Well why? Why would you say what's actually happening? You know?

Speaker 3:          00:13:59       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:14:00       Terrible fucking dancer. I think maybe I could in another life I could have been a good dancer, but all like happy emotions were beaten out of me by the time I was fucking four years old. So, you know, just dancing. I mean,

Speaker 3:          00:14:12       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:14:13       I can't, I don't, it's not even in me.

Speaker 3:          00:14:17       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:14:17       That whole fucking whatever that gift is, when, whenever that is, whenever the dancing does just fucking sprinkled on you. That was not sprinkled on me in any way, shape or fucking for, you know, even the music lessons to angry music except for Bruno Mars. Every once in a while I got it. I got a little, I don't, that's not true. Wait a minute bill. Come on. Who else she got in there? Night Ranger. Hey, did you see these fucking, uh, these guys want to blow us up. Now. You know what?

Speaker 1:          00:17:55       North Korea and how they made make this promo video and it's basically about them launching their own space. Shuttles is North Korea and dude, I'm assuming, right? And he's sitting there dreaming and they had the instrumental of, we are the world in the background, right? We owe the womb. We are the children. This fucking North Korean space shuttle is flying around, you know, fried around the globe. Korea is unified. And, um,

Speaker 2:          00:18:26       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:18:27       You know, and it ends with a city that looks like New York, which is on fire after some sort of missile attack, you know? But I guess they say, and it looks like the evil doers did themselves in, they don't take responsibility for doing it, but I guess, you know, I don't know. Evidently that was caused for big concern. Not In my world though, even though la I guess is one of the first ones they want to attack. I don't give a fuck.

Speaker 2:          00:18:54       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:18:54       Is that going to make you happy? They have fucking all fucking fat face their fat face part too. You know, I could see why were annoying.

Speaker 2:          00:19:07       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:19:08       I mean, we got in the middle of their fight over there way back in the day. Should a minded our own business, let them Duke it out, whoever wins wins. But we didn't leave stuck a fucking noses in over there and now they don't like us old. What will we do during the fucking, uh, civil war if all of a sudden a Korea came over here and was like, Hey, we side with these guys other side. Why don't you settle down after a while. Be like, hey, why don't you guys get the fuck out of here. Let us solve our own fucking problems. I get it. You know, I just don't want her to stand what North Korea has, what their fascination is with having a fat dictator. They, oh, they like a real pudgy fucking, uh, like on medication, like bloated face kind of fucking dictator. That's their thing.

Speaker 1:          00:20:03       I don't, I'm not worried about it. I would be more worried if they were going to try and blow up San Francisco because I'm in Los Angeles. Okay. If you're going to fucking shoot a goddamn nuclear weapon at this country, by all means do it at the city that I'm in because I don't want to survive it. All right? Best way you want to be, by the way, all these fucking people trying to come up with these underground places to go, that's not what you want to be. You want to be right with a fucking Kona that missile hits. That's what you want to be. Just get vaporized. You have no idea. You don't even know what's coming. Sitting there watching sports in a bad, bad at it. It over. You know you don't want to be on the outskirts like in Scottsdale fucking Arizona with one side of your fucking face melted off and then walking around for four days for wheat thins. You want to do that. You have some fucking agonizing like 18 day death. Fuck that. I want to be vaporized.

Speaker 2:          00:21:09       You know?

Speaker 1:          00:21:12       Why did you ever see a bunch of bugs and he hit him with some raid. That fucker one that takes the direct hit. That thing is done in two seconds. But the other ones that do when that little fucking Angus young running on the ground during a guitar solo fucking move. Those are the ones you don't want to be

Speaker 2:          00:21:27       right.

Speaker 1:          00:21:31       I Dunno, I don't give a fuck about North Korea and that worried about those guys. All right. You want to fucking start some shit? Go ahead. All right. Start some fucking shit.

Speaker 2:          00:21:45       What are they going to do?

Speaker 1:          00:21:48       Like what, what exactly is that? They're, they're fucking game plan. You can update it. It's so like not even a throw. Okay, you're going to, what? You're going to take out two cities. We have enough shit to fucking blow up the entire world like 9 million times. So you're going to take out Los Angeles, right? And then, then you know what? You're not going to have any movies to watch.

Speaker 1:          00:22:11       You ever think about that? North Korea, God knows your dad loved watching all our fucking movies. You're going to have none of that shit, right? You're going to have half the fucking divas that you're going to, that you're going to hire to perform at your fucking New Year's party. Like Beyonce. They're not going to be there. Isn't Beyonce one of the ones that perform for some fucking mass murdering psychopath? Was it her? I had a fuck enough. I'll throw her name out. You know, I'll take her name off and I'll say it was, uh, uh, boost face there from the voice. The one that likes to get dirty. What's her name? Christina Applegate gag. Yulara. Yeah, you go. Was it her? She's another one. She does that R and B singing [inaudible] and fucking point everywhere. Fucking voice is going. Seems like she's sitting on a giant vibrator. Um, she's just said, fuck it.

Speaker 2:          00:23:13       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:23:13       You know what? I sat with her and she just said to hell with it. I don't give a fuck.

Speaker 2:          00:23:17       You know,

Speaker 1:          00:23:20       I'm just going to be almost in shape and you guys can just fucking do. I had a kid, I like having a glass of wine around four in the afternoon. Go Fuck Yourself. I'm an I like, I really respect that she doesn't care. You know? Like if she was a dude, she'd be one of those guys who couldn't wear a tie because it, it just fucking, she can't breathe at that point.

Speaker 2:          00:23:42       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:23:42       She would she dress like Dana White? Um, all right. I didn't know what the fuck I'm talking about here. Have you guys see that? They get to have these new smell of visions, real smellovision TV unveiled by Japanese team, and it's not an April fool, is what it says. Tokyo team advent as smelling screen that makes, smells emanate from the spot on the screen showing their corresponding object. It works by feeding odors from sublimating gel pallets appellate's into air strikes. It's sublimating. That doesn't sound right. Like I don't think I pronounced that correctly. Whatever gel pellets into air streams that can be directed to specific spots on the screen. So what are you going to have? Like a bunch of pellets.

Speaker 3:          00:24:40       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:24:41       For every state that just, it's not going to work. You know what? The sad thing about this stupid fucking thing is, is this at the development promises to make advertisement for fried chicken or fresh coffee even more appealing. You know who's going to get this fucking thing? I swear to God, Bobby Kelly [inaudible]

Speaker 4:          00:24:58       good. I got the new smell of Asian kid, dude. I'm watching the food network. I was fucking drilling. Did the guy's making a fucking lobster souffle? I could fucking smell the fucking beach dude.

Speaker 1:          00:25:16       You know it. He'll buy it right when it comes out. So we can be the first guy and is blocked the habit. It'll cost him 15 grand and then in like fucking four years, they're going to be selling for like 600 bucks.

Speaker 3:          00:25:30       Yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:25:31       that's, that's the one of the things about being at the forefront of technology when you just have to be the first Douche bag on your block. You know, I gotta I have to have him on this podcast because I really, I really want to talk to him about that. Like what, what is that?

Speaker 3:          00:25:48       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:25:49       Cause I see it it like, it like fills him up. When I used to be in New York City and he would get some new gadget, he couldn't fucking wait to come down to the cellar. It stick of some phony reason to pull out his new shiny thing. Just dying for somebody to be like, oh is that the new fucking shiny fucking fuzzy 1000 and then either

Speaker 4:          00:26:12       they need a big N. Oh, why? Yes. Yes it is. Go check it. It charges my iPhone bum. You opened this over here. Flap. I got all my dates Zoe.

Speaker 1:          00:26:28       That motherfucker has had everything fucking everything. I like 15 years ago when he's still at his noodle hair, he fucking had anything that had a stylist at palm pilot. He had everything he had that I lived with them, he had that and he had bags. He, those were the two things that he was fucking into. And you know what I was into eating bland food and staring at the wall. So who fucking one who wanted that one? I would say Bobby. Um, all right, let's get to some fucking, uh, some God damn questions for this fucking week here. By the way, I dunno if I brought this up yet cause I've had it start this podcast a couple of times because I had a coughing fit. Uh, um, obviously the fastest, most Speedy's recovery possible for Kevin Ware of the, uh, of Louisville. Jesus Christ. That was one of the, that's one of the worst things I've ever seen. And um,

Speaker 2:          00:27:33       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:27:33       Yeah. And if you haven't seen it, you know what just it's killing me is I know there's going to be a bunch of people upload that fucking video and then Douche, we'll have to make jokes in that type of thing. But what a tough mother fucker Skype basically he broke, I don't know if it was a compound fracture. If it was, if it was both bones or whatever, but I know at least one of them, you know, was coming through the fucking skin and he's still laying in there telling everybody to win the fucking game. Jesus Christ.

Speaker 2:          00:28:05       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:28:05       That wouldn't have been me. I would've been crying like a fucking girl and saying, you know, games, I would have used up all our time out. Right.

Speaker 2:          00:28:15       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:28:16       And I could give a fuck about the game at that point. I would be screaming. I would've been like, Nancy Kerrigan.

Speaker 5:          00:28:22       Why?

Speaker 1:          00:28:25       Why? Oh, that's one of my favorite clips of all time. Because you know what I love? I love that she acted exactly how I would have acted. Everybody wants to act like they're going to be the hey win one for the gipper. And you know what? Most of us got that Nancy Kerrigan gene, you know, we're just going to start crying and be like, why me?

Speaker 2:          00:28:55       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:28:59       That really was, that was right up there as far as like, you know, she'd obviously never gotten her ass kicked in her life. The fact that she couldn't even wrap her fucking head around, you know, if she had gotten her ass kicked a couple of times, she, at least, what is she, why me would have been downgraded to dude. What the fuck? Oh my God. Right?

Speaker 5:          00:29:26       Why? Why?

Speaker 1:          00:29:29       Um, I don't even know where the fuck I was going with that. Oh, sorry guys. This fucking podcast sucks this week. I, I'm, I'm, I'm all right. I admit it. It this week. I'm fucking, I'm still sick. But you know, yesterday's yesterday's fucking last week's was a great one. Okay. So give me a little bit of slack here. Company a little slide for quite shit. Can you do that? Um, right. Oh, by the way, you know something, um, a couple of weeks ago I mentioned to the fact that, um, I don't get the, you know, the Premiere League as far as their, their soccer over there where their jerseys can be just so the colors is so dry, a dramatically different. Like you'll be watching a team and they're red and white and then next week they're wearing black and yellow. And it's like, what the fuck? And, uh, this guy wrote and he said, uh, in the premier league colors Shange

Speaker 3:          00:30:23       uh,

Speaker 1:          00:30:25       for example, Arsenal play man United, they both wear red and white. So the way team changes colors. That's why they changed the team cause I guess, and it's kind of weird that they're in the same league and guys can have the same colors, you know, which is starting to happen in American sports. Like however, the Toronto Maple leafs sued the Tampa Bay lightning for their new fucking jerseys, yet, you know, they're slowly moving in on your fucking territory and I don't know why you're not saying anything. Um, all right. Anyways, Bill, your workout routine. A bill, I'd like 95% of Americans on your shows. You look like what I think most people would look like should look like in terms of fitness. Uh, you see what he did there? He gave me a nice big compliment as he fucking trash. 95% of America. It's not 95%. It's a good fucking 65% of their kids. Um, do you follow a specific routine? Thanks. Um, well, right now I'm fucking horrible shape. I put them fucking 10 pounds. But this is the thing, I never let it get beyond this. You know, I never let it get beyond like a little bit of fucking

Speaker 1:          00:31:42       like 10 pounds and then I just take it off. That's basically what I do. I hike with my dog and um, and I, I use my own body weight.

Speaker 1:          00:31:54       I use my whole body weight because I find that that that makes you more cut rather than puffy. If you fucking lift weights and Shit, you get, you just start over, develop in like five different groups of muscles and a, you start walking around looking like a midget bouncer. At least I do. So I you a climbing rope. I have a peg board and I have a, a pull up and dip station. Uh, because I am a firm believer that you need to be able to move your own body, you know, and I used to do yoga fucking years and years ago, but um, I dunno, I just can't get myself to go to the classes. Those fucking mats are all dirty and shit. Even if you bring your own mat, that's just the level of and bare feet, it's just fucking disgusting. And uh, you know, and then also the chicks and they're so fucking ridiculous looking that at least out here in la, um, you know, the whole mental aspect of the thing is out the fucking window cause he's supposed to be like, you know, also calming your mind and I'm not calming my mind. My mind is fucking going. So, um,

Speaker 1:          00:33:09       yeah, that's what it is. And I try not to eat like an asshole and now that I'm ever advanced age can be 45 years old. I try to eat a fucking giant salad every day and a is while fighting that, what are you a fig fucking voice in my head. But um, as much as people sit there and they say that that's bird food and that type of thing, eat a giant salad every day and I'm telling you, yeah, you're going to be right as rain. All right.

Speaker 1:          00:33:39       I'm telling you, if you don't eat a salad every day and you read and fucking a bunch of meat and that type of thing, I swear to God trying to take his shit is like fucking, it's not a fun experience. You have a giant salad every day. It's not a problem. That's, you know what? That was true but disgusting. But I don't give a fuck. There you go. So that's what I do. Um, all right. Cooking Billy boy our day. What are some of your favorite things to cook in the kitchen? I was never much of a cook until I realized it's super easy. Um, well you must have a gift then. What do you mean super easy? What are you making eggs over easy? Yeah, that's easy. But he immune, you're actually, you know, doing some of that food network stuff. I don't think it's super easy.

Speaker 1:          00:34:29       Second, you've got to have like a, an ice bath bath to like blanche some shit, you know. Anyways. Uh, or caramelizing shit. You just got to experiment and think the basics through the food network mentioned a website called my fridge, food.com that tells you what you can make with the ingredients in your house. I accidentally learned how to make teriyaki sauce and Pumpkin pie because of what I've had, what I had in my place. That's actually an interesting, you mentioned once you made ribs. Have you mastered anything? What's your go to? Um, if I mastered anything, uh, the fuck can I do? Uh, I don't know. I don't know. I, I'm one of those people every once, once every eight months I throw down and I cook and I make a fucking great meal.

Speaker 3:          00:35:18       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:35:21       Through it. I'll make you a spaghetti sauce if you like a sweeter one that has some molasses in it and it will literally make you punch your fucking wife in the face repeatedly. Just fucking, just drawn back with each shoe, just areas. You bite down, you're letting it fuck you. Let your hands go. You know, you're free. That's how good. This just spaghetti sauces. I can make you little lasagna meat based of course. Uh, to do that. I can do all of that shit. I can make you some fucking short ribs there. Yeah, I can fucking cook. If I gave a fuck if I really wanted to, I could get really good at cooking. I'm actually, I'm really good at baking. I think I tell a nice story. I don't like this shit. I don't like being, I don't like these two fucking questions here where I'm talking positively about myself.

Speaker 1:          00:36:10       You know why? Because there's absolutely no humor in it. All right, let's get back to the fucking grip strength. You know why you need grip strength in case you're ever in a fucking house fire and you need to climb down the Goddamn gutters. All you need to go up to the roof and then take a running leap to the house next to it and you're gonna come up short and you're going to fucking grab something over there or maybe a fucking tree branch. That's what you need. Grip Strength Four. All right. I guess if you lift weights and you ever get sucked into a sinkhole, you can fucking lift your house. Safia I dunno what, all right. As far as cooking, I don't think cooking, senna, cooking, the whole thing is, is you got to have all these, you know, if you really want to throw down, it's that initial startup costs.

Speaker 1:          00:36:56       It's like when you first learned how to fix a car, it's not going to be cheaper than taking it to somewhere else because you're going to have to fucking, not only by the parts, you're gonna have to buy all the tools. Um, so I dunno, have I mastered anything? Yeah, I can make a fucking pie. I can make cakes. I get big. I can grill. I'm not the greatest griller. I got to admit, I get very impatient with growing. I know I'm supposed to have like the caveman shit and want to be standing out there over the fucking fire. I'm, I'm really not a into that. I used to work in a restaurant and I worked in the ski grill and they had the big fucking chef hat and all that type of shit and I made great burgers and shrimp Rochelle and chicken sandwiches and that shit.

Speaker 1:          00:37:38       I know how to do it. I can mock up the meat, I can fucking cook. I just don't, I'm just, I have to be into it and I get into it and I'm psycho into it for like three weeks and then I'm just not, I don't give a fuck after awhile. Um, cause I have fucking add, you know, basically standup comedy is the only thing I ever stuck with. So hence it's the only thing I remember I'm really good at. I can play drums, okay. Can play a little guitar, they can make a couple of dishes and uh, I can shoot the shit about the weather at a party. And then pretty much that, other than that, I'm done. Um, underrated the Bible, the Bible. All right. Uh, well, Jesus, here we go. That's the risk of pissing you off. I'm writing to say that the Bible is underrated.

Speaker 1:          00:38:28       That doesn't piss me off. I mean, it's a hell of a story, you know? Uh, really all religious texts are underrated and I can't blame anyone for underrating religion since religion is a lot of, uh, speculative crap. Um, no, I think the basis of all religions are the way you should live life. Like the 10 commandments is like common sense, the seven deadly sins. I love that shit. It's that. It's that once you start being like, you know, he, he loves us best and you don't believe what we're saying. So, uh, you're infidels and now we have to kill you or we have to have a crusade or we have to torture you until you're into what the fuck were into or were making so much money off this horse shit. We have to look the other way. Well, some of us are fucking children. You know that, that's where I, I, I, I make my departure,

Speaker 2:          00:39:24       you know,

Speaker 1:          00:39:25       or you're constantly telling me that, that this thing is fucking mad at me because of flawed despite that's the way you fucking made me. Like that's never made sense to me.

Speaker 2:          00:39:36       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:39:39       Or like if there's a god that, you know, he makes somebody like a sociopath.

Speaker 2:          00:39:44       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:39:45       It's sociopath is basically a broken human being. Like they didn't get all the parts

Speaker 2:          00:39:51       and

Speaker 1:          00:39:53       it's like, not even, it's not even their fault that, that, that, that they're born that way, that they don't feel anything.

Speaker 2:          00:40:02       All right.

Speaker 1:          00:40:05       That's not that that person's going to hell because they were born fucked up, you know? Now I'm not saying I have sympathy for sociopath. I think they should be hunted down and fucking shot in the street like rabid dogs. But I'm just saying as far as the, uh, are you going to have an a hell?

Speaker 1:          00:40:24       I mean, isn't that like on, on the manufacturer? I've always equated it to that. Like, you know, it'd be like if you built, built a piece of shit car, like you fucked up, you fucked it up when you built it and then you get mad at it because it doesn't run right. You know? So that, that's my thing. So you know, if humor into the Bible, I don't give a fuck. Anyway. I want to bring up the book of job. Huh? Look at that. I said it right. I didn't say job job rich reads as a tale of cruelty because God and the devil got together to put job through the wringer. Do you know bad? I would love to read the book of Job and actually be able to read more than two paragraphs without sitting there going, what the fuck are they talking about?

Speaker 1:          00:41:10       Uh, I think most people religious and otherwise miss an important point throughout the text. Job's friends went half cocked saying that Joe must have, must have done something to deserve what was happening to him. Sounds like the type of thing a lady would say, not at sounds a type of thing like a religious nut would say to me. Uh, at the end God became angry with job's friends from making this assumption and made them do sacrifices just for being smart as shit heads. Um, so the Bible has all kinds of moral concepts that have barely survived into the modern era. Probably thanks to all the linguistic mangling well, thank God you're there to figure it all out. Uh, job demonstrates that the burden of proof falls upon the accuser. It's even part of our justice system, but nobody gives it the importance it deserves. Especially Christians. If there's a god, he definitely pissed. He's definitely pissed at, you know who? No, I don't. I don't know. I was totally with you until you put it all on the Christians. But now I think that which we jury the Jewish or Muslim or fucking,

Speaker 2:          00:42:27       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:42:27       I Dunno. Is there something else?

Speaker 2:          00:42:30       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:42:31       Who are those people who pray to the trees? Hippies. Is that a religion? Huh? Dirty hippies?

Speaker 2:          00:42:42       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:42:43       Et cetera. Religion.

Speaker 2:          00:42:44       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:42:45       Hindu, not Hindu. Hari Krishna. Hari Krishna is just dirty hippies who shaved their heads or am I thinking of that Charles Manson movie for the Manson family? I'll shave their heads. I don't fucking know. I don't know what your point was. Surf. It made me want to read the book of Joe, but I know what's going to happen. I'll start to read it and then as B, and then God said it thought to you with the hallway and the the seventh son of the fucking he BD Hamadie who? And it's just like, all right. You know?

Speaker 2:          00:43:16       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:43:16       Why don't they give a, I'm sure there is. I'm sure there's an updated version of it where they actually write it in a more, um, modern English.

Speaker 2:          00:43:26       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:43:27       Like the band. All right. Bill wife left.

Speaker 2:          00:43:30       Okay,

Speaker 1:          00:43:31       Bill. So I got a text from my wife a couple of weeks ago saying she had taken her dog and her things left and we're getting a divorce.

Speaker 2:          00:43:40       Wow.

Speaker 1:          00:43:43       She gave you a text message, you know, that's kind of the way to do it.

Speaker 2:          00:43:50       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:43:50       In a selfish way, you know. Do you know, I know somebody who did that. I knew somebody who was in a fucking relationship forever.

Speaker 2:          00:44:03       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:44:04       And I guess they just didn't know how to get out of it. So here's an option for people out there, men and women. And so this has nothing to do with you. This just reminded me of this. So this fucking guy,

Speaker 2:          00:44:17       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:44:17       Is uh, is woman went on a cruise, I went on to some sort of wine tasting thing or whatever and he, I guess he knew that she was going on this trip. So before she left, he already found another apartment, signed a lease and all that type of shit. So she leaves, I mean she was leaving for like two, three days. He had another buddy of mine went over there. They packed up all his shit and fucking moved it out to this new place.

Speaker 2:          00:45:02       And then,

Speaker 1:          00:45:04       you know, he just lived in that place until the day she was coming back. He came back to the apartment, she comes home and immediately sees half the shit is gone. And he just dropped the bomb like that and said, listen, you know, we need to talk. I'm not fucking happy. And what I tell you, this fucking woman flip the fuck out. Flipped the fuck out. Like what? Absolutely fucking ballistic.

Speaker 2:          00:45:40       And,

Speaker 1:          00:45:44       and I always wanted to ask her why, what was it that made you flip out? Would you, would you have flipped out less?

Speaker 3:          00:45:54       Yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:45:54       cause she, she didn't even go into the, the surprise of what, Oh my God, crying, uh, blood went immediately to anger and I think it was because he was already out.

Speaker 3:          00:46:08       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:46:09       And there wasn't going to be any sort of closure. Slash I can torture you. It'd be a total cunt to you. Like he sidestepped all of that. It just made this clean ass fucking break. You know Dennis Miller, that's the news. And I am out of here. That's what I thought what he did it. And

Speaker 1:          00:46:39       I dunno why. I always smile when I think, cause that's the thing, you know, if you're going to break up a woman, you just know. I mean, I mean, I never had a breakup with a girl I was living with. I can't imagine that fucking hell and this person. I mean that, that's one way to do it. Um, so if you are stuck in a relationship and you don't know how to fucking bring it up, you just don't know how to do it. That's one way to do it. Because when they come home and you're sitting there, but you all your shit isn't there. Uh, that's, that's the conversation has been

Speaker 2:          00:47:11       God.

Speaker 1:          00:47:15       Fuck. Anyways, so getting back to this poor bastard, he goes, harass Chanel was that, she always hated me. Oh my God. Forget the eight instances of cheating, three posts, marriages that I, three post-marriage that I tolerated just because is as good of a reason for her to leave as any, wait a minute back up here. Wait a minute, dude. She cheated on you ate fucking times five times before he got married. I mean to what? Come on man. You didn't see this coming. All right, I'm going to save judgment here. Uh, he said forget about the aids instances of cheating, three post marriages that I tolerated the he price and quote just because is as good of reason for her to leave as any, uh, here's where you pummel me, but she was my mom's, but she was at my mom's bedside with my mom and I when my mom died. Okay. I didn't realize, dude, you didn't write this well. I didn't realize to her that nothing, I didn't realize to her that was nothing but her way in. I didn't realize that to her. I don't know. What did she went to that, that, that was her way into your life? In my grief. I didn't notice she went full Andy.

Speaker 3:          00:48:58       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:48:59       Do frame just chipping away at my sense of self so she would fuck around. So when she would fuck around, I thought, well no person in the world. We'll hang on to me. So this is better than being alone. Fuck it. I'll do. Come on man. She and I had been together for nine years, married three. My problem is that as a 26 year old birthday was yesterday, none of my friends can relate. And my thousand yard stare, oh can relate. And my thousand yard stare at the bar just seems to be harsh. Seems to harsh there. Hipster PBR buzz. Dude, this is the most difficult fucking thing I've ever tried to read. Um, dude, you're like 26 years old. Get the fuck out of this thing. Go to the gym. Is that your problem? Huh? You got a little dull around the fucking middle that said to read up on nutrition gets get some fucking self esteem, man. This is ridiculous.

Speaker 1:          00:50:07       Is fucking cunt. You know why she hated you? She's probably one of the reasons she hates she's cause you're not sticking up for yourself. This fucking dude. Yeah. You know what? I'm not gonna yell at, you've already been through the fucking ringer with this one. I'm sorry you ran into something like this. I'm sorry. I don't know who the fuck you are. Your male role model was when you were growing up, didn't build you up more. They obviously didn't fucking raise you. Right? And now you've got to do it. Okay? You got to build yourself up, man. You can't fucking, you can't fucking have something like this going on. You like William h Macy in fucking a boogie nights. You going eventually fucking shoot her in the driveway, fucking your friends and then go blow your brains out. You don't want to be that guy. Fuck this woman. He goes, I've tried to get back out there with some people I know, but when they tried, when they tell their stories from college, all I think is, I wonder if John McCain gets this mad when people his age tells stories about Woodstock.

Speaker 3:          00:51:05       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:51:06       All right. Now where do we make the leap there? What their pussy stories and you're pissed because you missed out on that.

Speaker 1:          00:51:15       Uh, I'm lost. I'm optimistic as for the most part, my life is much better by friends think I'm exaggerating because they saw us together and my response is that people saw Elizabeth smart out in public too and she wasn't and she wasn't fine either. What the hell do I do? The last time I was single, texting didn't exist. I couldn't drink legally. I've lived with my parents. I lived with my parents. Uh, you got the 0.3 examples ago, but I keep typing. I thought maybe as a comic when you started going into the road and didn't know people everywhere, it may have been a similar vibe. Yeah, Dude. Like you're, you're starting from ground zero. You're totally beat down.

Speaker 3:          00:52:01       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:52:02       You're 26 years old talking about like you're 50, you know, you're fine. All right. Oh wait. So you went there for fucking, what'd you say? Eight or nine years? Let's do the math here.

Speaker 3:          00:52:17       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:52:18       Tastes my wife of Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. Eight instances. I'll see you there for nine years. So you got together with this girl when he was 17. He was still, you were a baby. All right. I get it, I get it. And you stayed with this girl and you never cheated on her. She cheated on you. And all those years of college when you should've got you game together, how to talk to women, but blah blah blah blah blah. Yeah, dude, that's easy. You can, you can make up ground real quickly here. You're only 26 years old. Um,

Speaker 1:          00:52:51       you just gotta. You just gotta get yourself out there now. I mean, I wouldn't suggest just going out to bars. Look, if you want to fuck a woman, go out to a bar. Do that. If you want to meet somebody nice, then I would, I would be, I would definitely look elsewhere. Uh, do you have any hobbies? Do you like sports? I would join some sort of a fucking, what the fuck is the word? What's the word? When they lead guys and women play together. You know, I joined some shit like that. Take a fucking cooking class. It's just something, you know, something where the, where the good girls go to, you know, but you know, if you just want to go out and get laid, who gives a fuck? You, what you gotta do is you got to get over being, getting rejected. Just go out to a bar, just talk some shit.

Speaker 1:          00:53:44       You know, don't go out and get plastered and use that as your fucking courage. Just go out there and just talk some shit, you know, and just go out there and just say, all right, I'm going to die. I'm going to say, what's up to 10 different women tonight? All right? Or if that's too overwhelming, make it five or four. All right? No more, no less than four. All right? All right. With no, no pressure on the results. Just go out there and just fucking strike up a conversation. See how long you can keep it going and, and just, you know, whatever, you're going to be nervous, you're going to give a fuck. But with each one, you're going to give a shit less. And the less you give a fuck, the more relaxed you are going to be. The funny you're going to be, the more you're going to attract them.

Speaker 1:          00:54:31       It's, it's literally when you give a fuck, when you give a fuck, you scaring them away. When you care, you know you'll be fine, all right? But it's, you got to grow up and stop and brace in this fucking this depressive shit because it's also gonna make you an angry cunt and you're going to fucking hate women and you're gonna push your friends away in the end up being alone. All right? Unfortunately you fucking, you wasted nine years of your life with some cunt and he got fucking married, okay? But it wasn't a waste because now you know what you don't want. All right? So that's it. But for the love of God, do not get into another goddamn relationship. You got to make a pact with yourself. You're not going to go from a nine year, one, three year marriage to fucking jump in into something else.

Speaker 1:          00:55:25       You gotta stay single and figuring out what the fuck you want. You might not want it. You might want to like not even go out to fucking bars for awhile. You know, let's go to the gym. Hit it like a fucking mad man. You know it. Fucking figure out what you will, what you're looking for and then where it should be and then go in that direction. Do that. All right? Not Everybody's going to be the guy who goes out and bags of fucking a hundred women who gives a fuck. All right. At the end of it, if you find fucking love and you find the person he's supposed to be with you, one. Okay, so, uh, whatever, there's my fucking 2 cents. Did I say the F word enough? Um, alright. From fucking Croatia, which is in fucking Europe. Look at this guy breaking my balls from the other side of the planet.

Speaker 1:          00:56:14       All right, I'll get right to it. Recently, my luck with the ladies changed for the better. Good for you sir. I realized how different men are from women and it started using that to my advantage. Both sir. The last person. Please listen to this guy. Uh, I'm 23 and in college I started college three years older. So I am in class with 19 to 20 year olds. Pretty much. They are all ladies. Not a single one of them is, Eh, is annoying. I get along with all of them. But there is this one, Christina who acts like she's the only one with problems. Okay, well there's always going to be a bad one in there. Uh, we talked a couple of times, even when out on a date she seemed interested but very distant. Uh, the date was very tense. Unlike all the other dates I can handle.

Speaker 1:          00:57:07       Oh, Jesus. You guys really killed me this week. Unlike all the other dates, I can handle someone manly. At least I am. Cool. So everything goes relatively smoothly. I'm going to cut you some slack circus. This is a fucking second language. This is amazing. Um, this date was as, as stiff as Jay Leno. I hated it. Uh, so we didn't talk for a couple of days after the Hora date. Uh, my dad, my bad for not knowing, not talking to her. I know. No it isn't. He had a bad day. Don't call her back. You didn't have good time. Why would you pursue it? Uh, anyways, then we started talking again and some vibes are going on, but we only saw each other in class. Then we started talking some deep shit over Facebook as 20 year olds do and I realize we don't get each other. We just don't understand one another.

Speaker 1:          00:57:59       All right, so walk away. She has a little circle of friends and a lot of guys come on to her, but she's like very into ourself and shit. Okay. I know her self centered feelings are natural or her age, but I am a little bit older but she's like, now no one understands me. She's really a baby yet, dude, you have this all figured out. He goes, we don't understand each other at all. It's like, we mean the same thing but awkwardly argue over the choice of the words we use. Man, I really want a banger. She smiled. I was going to say, she has to be beautiful. He said she's smoking hot. In the meantime, I am all over the other ladies. Uh, but I'm really restless about this one. I like her, but she will break me if I get too much into her. Alica we started speaking like Ivan Drago. Um, so the gist of my pussy ass letter is how do I bang her now after the shitty date and awkward Facebook arguments? Uh, God damn. I just realized she's cutting my balls off when I talked to her. I must get my shit together if I want to fuck her, but I still don't really know how to do it. Shit. Okay. Uh, all right. What are we going to do? Um,

Speaker 3:          00:59:24       yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:59:25       All right. How the fuck do we undo what the fuck was already done? What would I do? Uh, I would fucking,

Speaker 2:          00:59:35       you know what I would do?

Speaker 1:          00:59:37       I would just charm the shit out of her and I would come in in a fucking great mood. Even if you're not in a great mood just coming to class,

Speaker 2:          00:59:44       you know,

Speaker 1:          00:59:46       is it, I'm giving you the fucking demoed speech from fast times at Ridgemont high get, Oh, you just kept walking in like, your fucking life is great.

Speaker 2:          00:59:56       You know,

Speaker 1:          00:59:58       she's going to be like, oh my God. He's like, I'm not like talking to him. And he's like having a good time. Does that like mean I'm not pretty anymore? Like that'll fuck with her fucking the world revolves around me that you can actually, now that you've been sucked into her world, you could still actually have a great fucking day.

Speaker 2:          01:00:15       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:00:16       Without needing her fucking, uh, attention or anything. Yeah. Just walk in there like your life's to shit and when you see or be really friendly, hey, why are you giving her a nice big hug? And that'd be fucking flirting with all the other fucking women that'll make her fucking jealous. I mean, he's basically, you're going to have to play a fucking gay with a fucking cunt like this, which is really a lot of work.

Speaker 2:          01:00:39       MMM.

Speaker 1:          01:00:41       And it sounds like you, you like, you sound like you're kind of the male version of her, you know, she kinda didn't let you fucking hit it. So now you're kind of getting wrapped up in this fucking Twat. You don't even want, your ego wants it. You want to fucking bag or you know what you should do, sir. It's just fucking walk away. That's what you do. Walk away and go bag something else. And when she actually fucking cubs at, you'd be like, why didn't you call me anymore? Just be like, Eh, no vibe between us.

Speaker 2:          01:01:08       There really isn't.

Speaker 1:          01:01:10       You know, you're beautiful, but the conversations too awkward and I find that you're just really self centered. You're really into yourself. And uh, I find it annoying, you know, if you tell him that you've probably going to be closer to the fucking pussy than you are going the other way. Why don't you call me? Oh sorry, I've been busy. You just act like a fucking loser. Don't do that. All right.

Speaker 3:          01:01:35       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:01:35       You get this one by walking away from this one. That's, that's, that's my gut feeling. All right, sir. You know what you do, you just walk in class, you'd take your Dick out, you put it right on a fucking desk. Could just go and, you know, really, can we just stop already? And then when the teacher's like, excuse me, fucking the checklists, Avaya Ne, whatever the fuck her name is. All right, sick. I used to play for the, uh, for the Lakers. Who's fucking over there? Christ. I'm sorry guys. This podcast stunk. Just take your dick out and shake it in her face.
