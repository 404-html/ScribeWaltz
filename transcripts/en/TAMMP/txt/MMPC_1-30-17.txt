Speaker 1:          00:00:00       Hmm.

Speaker 2:          00:00:01       Hey, what's going on? It's bill burr and it is time for the Monday morning podcast from Monday, January 30th, 2017 what's going on? How are Ya? Um, as you can tell by my, my little slightly more relaxed tone, my kid's asleep downstairs so I, I can't scream. I can't yell, I can't rant and rave. Oh, I can do those things, but I have to do it in a controlled manner. Um, that's what I have to do, you know, cause the, the dynamics of the house changed a little bit and I know what you think is so, Bill, does that mean the dynamic is you'll probably catch, is going to change a little bit? Yeah, just a little bit, but nothing crazy. You know, like listen to me right now, you would have no idea that right before I got on this podcast, I just meditated. I meditated for 10 minutes, I shut it down.

Speaker 2:          00:00:45       Let's focus on the sounds in the room now. Gently let those go away and focus on your breathing. I did that 10 minutes. I guess it's helping me out. Um, you know, I had one, one meltdown this week. I was trying to figure out how to put the fucking car seat into the car and I swear to God, dude, like the level, the level that they have overdesigned those things is insane. I swear to God, I hope auto racing, they should put those fucking drivers and car seats and then nothing would ever happen to them. I couldn't figure out how to get this effing thing in there. And I did I just say Effient. Yeah. I'm trying to learn how to, uh, the kids influence. It's coming in. I've been cracking me up by doing it going, hey, quit talking s and just, you know, abbreviate incarceration to her.

Speaker 2:          00:01:35       It's hilarious because all she's ever heard we do is just, you know, curse my brains out. And I was making a laugh last night because we were laying in bed when we watching wheel of fortune with a beautiful baby between us. And I was just doing what I always do. I was trashing all the contestants and all and everything on there. Read, uh, you know, I to say about the wheel of fortune, man, dead dare fucking some stingy cons on that show. When I give it comes down to the, to the Dang whoever that one of the three, that one when they go over and then you try to win some big money to get him for one big hit for like 50 or 60 grand, those puzzles, they, they're practically impossible. And the clues throw you off.

Speaker 1:          00:02:23       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:02:23       They had one, they said a phrase,

Speaker 1:          00:02:27       okay,

Speaker 2:          00:02:27       they go, this is a phrase, we'll give you these letters. And of course, you know, none of them show up. Right? Then you pick some in a few of those show up. This was the phrase, our first voyage.

Speaker 1:          00:02:39       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:02:40       That's a phrase. I mean technically it's a phrase, but if you're going to say it's a phrase that should be something like, like to me a phrase, it's somewhere between, you know, an expression and a, you know, just some random shit. Right? That's a phrase.

Speaker 1:          00:03:00       Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:03:00       Does that make any sense? Like an expression, a, a, you know, fucking stitch in time saves nine. Is that an expression? Instead of Soliloquy. I don't know what that is. Okay. But I know that's not a phrase, that's something else, but I don't know what that is. But a phrase is Jared, some calm eight check please.

Speaker 1:          00:03:17       Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:03:18       You know, don't fucking touch that. I don't know. I can't think of a good one. But you know what I mean? Our first voyage is afraid. Technically it's a phrase Pat Sajak. I never realized they, they always fuck the person over. They tried to limit the r s and t's in it because they know everybody's gonna.

Speaker 1:          00:03:35       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:03:36       Gonna guess those ones, I don't know. And he always pulls the car down so, and they give you like eight seconds to solve it. You don't get it in. Then he always pulls out some ridiculous amount of money. Oh, that was for going to be for 90 grand. Very stingy. But what do you expect? Cause I remember back in the day they are, when they had the shittiest prizes on that show, it's almost like they didn't want you to be happy when you left. So as much as I'm a joy in that show, I don't know. I'm starting to just getting ready to move on to a new game show. Um, Jesus Christ in my fucking tired. I don't know how the hell I'm going to get through this hour. Um,

Speaker 2:          00:04:13       cause then I got to run over. I'm doing Conan O'brien tonight. Everybody please tune in to hide my standup special that comes out tomorrow on Netflix, my fifth one called walk your way up. I know what you think of bill. Why don't you call it walk your way out. Well, if you'll watch the show, you'll understand how about that. But if you guys could, um, you know, social media, the whole thing up and uh, just let people know to check the thing out so the dream continues. Um, I would really appreciate it. Um, I'm very proud of this one. I hope, I hope you guys like it too. I had a great time doing it and we shot at this beautiful venue called the Ryman, which is the original place where they shut the grand ole Opry. Then a couple of floorboards left from the original, um, stage. So when you walk on those, those are the same ones that Elvis Johnny Cash. Yeah. You know a bunch of other white guys and fucking Minnie Pearl who walked down. Hank Williams, Hank Williams jr I acquire you have Jeremy and jr

Speaker 2:          00:05:14       um, I told you guys I've got satellite radio finally in my car, if they're all those years of being on it, on the opie and Anthony show way back in the day, XM satellite radio, way back in the day. I never had it and I didn't realize how fucking great it is. And I've actually gotten a little bit into country music, but it's sad. Um, Willie Nelson roadhouse channel. I like the old stuff and the new shit. I just don't fucking, I just don't, I don't get it. I'm not into it at all. It's gotta be somebody. There's no fucking way you can have an entire genre of music and not have anybody today doing it. Well, um, but who knows. So I haven't done shit this week. People, I don't have any jokes. I don't even know what the fuck to talk to you about. Been watching Celtics and Bruins Shit. I was so tired the other day, my daughter was crying. Um, my wife was holding my, my daughter and I walked over with the pacifier to try to quiet the kid. And I literally walked up and tried to put it in my, my, my, uh, my wife's mouth. She laughed thinking I was fucking around when I was like, oh sorry. Sorry. Because when I walked over she was talking and I'll always thinking was make that noise stop. And I tried to stick it in her mouth. Um, so anyways, so I'm starting to understand why so many parents are so are so conti.

Speaker 1:          00:06:33       Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:06:33       To people who either don't have kids or they're about to have kids and they, they, I dunno if they're not nice people, they really aren't. And I'm gonna try not to be that person. I'm not going to resent someone who, who doesn't have kids because they have free time that I no longer have. That's such a fucking, I dunno, it's a weird thing, you know, when you have a kid cause you get to experience this new level of love and then you also get to see this other side of people just like, ah, they would just fucking, I dunno. I don't know. I ran into yet another person. I'm like, dude, you can have no free time either. I have no freak type of pocket door. I went to a drum lessons Saturday and I went to the Nhl all star game on Sunday. You know what the rest of my time was fucking, you know, daily with the kid, but I'm still doing shit.

Speaker 1:          00:07:21       Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:07:23       You know what's up? I think a lot of fucking people, they didn't do shit before they had a kid. They don't have a fucking hobby. They don't have anything that they're passionate about. I don't know what it is, but they're miserable. Cons. I got to get away from him. You know, I just had a buddy of mine say, hey, congratulations. I, I'm thinking about having a kid, you know, next year. I just said, that's great. It's your experience. Don't talk to parents. They're not saying people, myself included, just, you know, it's going to be great. Have a good time. Be Nice if people did that. Huh? But why would you do that? Why would you do that when you can't get somebody you're fucking resentment out on a completely innocent person. When I'm going to start bitching about this shit, uh, I think I've made my point. So anyways, I'm selling more shit. Oh, I'm selling more shit. Everything's on the chopping block. Um,

Speaker 1:          00:08:19       okay.

Speaker 2:          00:08:19       I got that John Bonham drum kit that I have that 71 Ludwig green sparkle. And I'm actually toying with the idea of selling that fucking thing because I, um,

Speaker 1:          00:08:29       okay.

Speaker 2:          00:08:29       It's just too fucking big for me. It's not comfortable playing it. The symbols. I don't even like the sound of them. It's not my sound. And I did, I did the stupid fucking thing that every weekend warrior want to be hobbyists musician does. I'm going to buy Eddie van Halen Guitar. Then I'll play like Eddie van Halen. No, you won't. You'll just be a dose with an Eddie Halen Guitar who is an Eddie van Halen. So I made that mistake. So I'm actually thinking about, um, actually I toyed with the idea, but then I, I went in and I looked at the drums and it's so beautiful. I don't know if I can fucking do it, but, um, I dunno. I would rather get a drum kit that may be set up for fucking how I'm built. I swear to God, I played that thing out on the comedy jam twice and I to go from the rack Tom to the floor, Tom said 26 inch bass drum. It's so you gotta take like a taxi to go from the rack or just the way I'm built. So to get to the fucking, from the rack to the floor, I always go via the snare just to give me that extra split second just to get over the fucking thing.

Speaker 2:          00:09:43       I don't know how this Barnum guy did it, but you know, it's not working for me. So, um, I'm thinking of getting rid of that and uh, and going out and buy maybe like a Gretsch or something like that with like a 22 inch kick instead of a 26 and have a 14 inch floor Thomas that I have and that has a rack. Tom, I think that I always like the 14th floor I noticed is some fucking nerdy drum shit. But um, yeah I think I want to do that and get them out of the fucking house. I'll fuck a final fucking studio space for like a couple hundred bucks a month. Now I just have a brand new kit cause that's the only thing that stops me from setting that thing up cause it's a vintage kid. I'm like Oh my God, when somebody steals it, it's irreplaceable.

Speaker 2:          00:10:22       But if I buy a brand new one, brand new symbols, get a little bit insurance, you know, 50 bucks a month, I walk in there one day somebody steals it adds just fucking get another one. Cause there's still making them, I'm trying to get out of their disease of like an old shit. I love old shit. But then you get it and it just becomes this fucking thing when it breaks. Oh my God, how the fuck am I going to try and find the parts for it? They come up on my body guard and the big dude from, uh, from m power. What is your major malfunction with the fuck was that called full metal jacket? Remember that guy? He played the, uh, the dude who protect the kid from meatballs anyways, he had a fucking motorcycle. There was some little piece of the carburetor, they couldn't fucking fight.

Speaker 2:          00:11:03       So of course because it's a Hollywood movie, you know, because it's a Hollywood movie, you know, they go into a junk yard and the little nerdy kid finds it, you know, and then that's they're the little bonding moment. I would tell you guys how much I hate that when I watch, um, TVs and movies, TVS, TV shows and movies. I hate the fucking convenience of how everything fucking works out. Um, I also, like two nights ago I was doing stand up at the comedy store and I was talking shit about being a white dude. You know, cause it's funny cause you're not allowed to do it. You know, every other group of people could be proud of their accomplishments. But we can't wait to this camp because of all the horrific shit that we've done. Wipes out any sort of accomplishment. So jokingly saying like, you know, we did this as a dad, we went to the moon and then this woman yells out here,

Speaker 3:          00:11:55       figures go see hidden figures. I'm just saying, you know, I cannot stand people that go see a Hollywood movie and think that they just read a history book.

Speaker 2:          00:12:10       It's, it's just fucking like, and then they think they're informed. It's like you're not informed. You watched a movie. I told you guys that shit. Do you know their movie sully? When that thing came out, they wanted to make the copilot

Speaker 3:          00:12:24       an alcoholic just to raise the stakes. And the real guy who's really alive and still flies had to like threatened to sue or something. It'd be like, guys, he can't fucking put that out there about me. I'm not an alcoholic. I have a career in commercial aviation. You can't start floating it out to the world, then I'm a fucking alcoholic. And then they were like, oh, all right.

Speaker 2:          00:12:47       So that's all I'm saying. Okay. I'm not saying that there weren't some people doing some math and all that. Just don't fucking, my only thing about that, this is myself included, don't fucking come after me when you've never, you never heard of those people and all you did was go out and go see the fucking movie and start coming to me like you, like you went to fucking graduate school. So I had formed with that. I probably went too hard. You know, I brought up that guy who fucking, you know, that dude who figured out that when you're out in outer space, then if you perspire that your, your sweat would boil and you would literally boil and your own sweat. So that his space suit was literally like a giant radiator. Some dude figured out that that would happen. Figured out that that would fucking happen before we even went out there. You know? Where's that guy's movie? Huh?

Speaker 3:          00:13:36       Well, where is it?

Speaker 2:          00:13:40       Oh, Jesus Christ. What else? Um, so yes, I went to the NHL All star game. Um, three on three is crazy format. I think you know that going in the right direction because everybody knows that all star games are mind numbingly boring. The baseball ones pretty good. Basically I would say baseball's the best all star game. The NBA All star Game I guess is sort of fun cause everyone, nobody is going to play d and everybody's going to dunk. So it's a little interesting. But I'd say the baseball wants the best. So the NHL is trying to figure out, you know, a format on how to make, there's competitive and people to give a shit. So they take like all four divisions and I can only, I didn't even understand the format. He played like five minutes, then you played another five minutes and then two other divisions came out and you played five and five and then the winter, those two then played in the finals. I don't know how to fucking thing worked. Um, where'd you play? Two 10 minute periods. I was at the game and I couldn't figure out what was going on. And it was, it was unbelievably quiet when he was in there. They should have played the first five minutes, five on five

Speaker 3:          00:14:49       and then the next one, you know something. There's no way to make an all

Speaker 2:          00:14:52       star game exciting. That's just basically it. Cause you know what though, they just have too much to loose back. I'd be no sub at Ben when they all start games are great. We're back in the day when professional athletes also had like off season, day jobs.

Speaker 1:          00:15:07       Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:15:08       Like he played for the Cleveland browns from September till the end of December. And then the rest of the year you were like pouring concrete. Like those lunatics, they gotten shaped by, you know, being the Jackhammer guy on a road crew. Um, I bet then then they had some good games because then there was probably the pride of like our conferences better than your conference and Blah Blah Blah Blah Blah. But uh, there's just too much money at stake. But, um, it was still fun to go down there and see all that type of stuff. But, um, and that's was part of my nerd, you know, fandom thing that I have. I've now been to every all star game except for the baseball one. So now of course with my fucking OCD, I have to, I don't even know what I'm going for.

Speaker 1:          00:15:54       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:15:54       Going to all of these fucking games at this point. But um, I dunno, you know what's cool about it is it keeps me going to different places.

Speaker 1:          00:16:03       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:16:03       You know, cause at some point I want to go to that. Uh, I've been to one golfing major in, in order to go to all four. The first three are not difficult. Well the US Open and the PGA or not difficult. You can get fucking Texas. The fucking us open at golf. I mean they just animals.

Speaker 2:          00:16:20       Yeah. When you watch that golf tournament and you hear those people screaming and yelling, it sounds like the third show. It's some shit fucking comedy club on a Saturday night, just a bunch of drunks and then I can a police anybody cause they want to make their money off selling a booze. Um, the masters is the hard one because they don't sell tickets. And here's a heads up on that. The first time I did it, you have, you get like these badges that are given to the members and they're not supposed to sell them, but they all do. And everybody kind of looks the other way, right? So then you go to these brokers that have these badges, you pay way too much fucking money for them and you show up at somebody's fucking house. This is what happened to me.

Speaker 1:          00:16:59       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:17:00       And, uh, the first time I did it, I went with two people and we, we lucked out and we got the badges mean Versie we went in 2010. Then a few years later we went to go again and I brought five fucking people to the same people's house and they said, ah, there was a mix up with the badges and then the lady who was going to pay us just fucking goes, I'll be right back to go get them. And She just fucking left. And that's the last time we saw. And then the husband just waited us out on the front yard and uh, and I was just out the money and they completely fucked us over and I lost a ton of money as did a number of other people. And we were talking about trying to remember, we were standing outside the house just waiting for them.

Speaker 2:          00:17:44       The neighbors came walking by going like, God or they screw you out of the badges. Yeah, they did that a few before. And, um, you know, just started having fantasies about burning down their fucking house and all of that type of shit. And then, um, I dunno, I just Kinda let it go. And you know, it's funny is every time I let it go, like fully just let it go and just be like, you know what, I did get to go to it. Part of buying scalp tickets is every once a while you get fucked over. It happened me at a ravens game one time. Um, I ended up buying some tickets that were stolen season tickets and they kicked me out of the fucking stadium and then I had to buy another pair of scalp tickets to get back in. I mean it's, it happens, but what's funny about that? Um,

Speaker 4:          00:18:31       okay,

Speaker 2:          00:18:32       the one I get fucked over at the, uh, the masters and I bought, I bought five of those fucking things. So I was out a lot of money. What was funny about that is every time I go to let it go, cause I remember him saying, the guy said, dude, if you don't give him money back, I'm going to suit. I'm going to sue you and blah, blah, said all this stuff. And then the guy, little Elmer Fudd looking fucking dude, just get who you are. You near Gichon mood back in with his fucking, there's other fucking fat. Fuck.

Speaker 2:          00:19:03       I was going, well, well how much money you got your pocket from the other ones give me that money and he gives you ain't give me that money. Come get it. Let's see. You try, right? It was like one of those moments and there was like five of us and we could all beat the shit out of the guy. But you know what's gonna Happen? You're gonna beat the shit out of him. Okay, then we're not going to get them money. We're going to go to jail. They're going to sue us for assault. There's just no way to win. The only way to win a fight, once she passed like high scorch, once you become an adult, the only way to win a fucking fight is you have no money and you have nothing to lose and you're homeless. That's the only way to win it because then you're going to get arrested and you're going to go to jail and at least now you've got a place to stay for the night, get some meals.

Speaker 2:          00:19:48       You don't have to beg for food other than that you're going to fucking loose. Cause I sat there and kept trying to do the math going how the fuck, you know, having those violent things and you know, I'm sure there's a fucking tire iron in the car. If I smashed both these guys over the fucking heads. What's APP, which I'm not going to do. I've never done anything even remotely that violent, but you're so fucking mad. Where are you getting fucked out of money? You start having these fantasies and just cause it makes you feel better. I'm just thinking of caving in the side of their fucking heads. I just kept trying to do the math on how we would get away and you just can't do it anymore. You know, back in the day you could do that. You could jump on your horse and fucking right away it was over. You know, it wasn't some minor with the cell phone fucking camera and you've horse had a license plate on his fucking tail and you were screwed. You had done, um, you know, somebody following you what the fucking drone and there was just no way. Um, there was no to do it other than

Speaker 2:          00:20:48       just take my loss and then I was going to cook, quadruple it. And um, and God knows what else, you know, and the kind of people that would do to us what they did to us. I was like, what would they do in a court of law if I was actually guilty of doing something to them? You know what I mean? So I let go of it. I said, fuck it. It's a loss. Who gives a shit? We'll make it up. We'll come back at some other time. We'll go, go again. Fuck it. And every time I would go to let go of it, you know, start to let go of, would start to let go of it. Fucking Paul Versey. Okay. The half Sicilian part of him who can never forget anything like that would call me up. And just get me fucking off. He kept me all riled up again.

Speaker 2:          00:21:35       I'd be like, Paul, you've got to stop doing. Then he would sit there calling me up like he's Sammy the bull. If Sammy didn't fucking sell out and I'm fucking the other guy there, what does it, what are the Teflon don there almost sit Giuliani, um, Gotti, John Gotti, and he would call me up just telling me what he was going to do to that guy's house. And of course he did door, hey, he's not going to do it. He's married, he's got two kids. But he would call it a call me up and I would get me going again. He did this for fucking years now it's just a joke now. It's just like once a year he'll call me up and be like, hey dude, not for nothing. But I thought about this again the other day. I was thinking, not even fucking saying anything to you and just going down there and then just calling you up and being like, hey bill, it's done. It's done. And I go, yeah. And right there, right. That you'd call me up and then you'd say something over the phone. And because it's not illegal now to listen to people's phone calls right there, we would get caught. You have to weed, you would have to do, Paul is, you would have to go down and do it. Know that you did it

Speaker 2:          00:22:42       and then not say anything to me ever until one day maybe we were out to fucking see in international waters. And then even then we'd have to go to back to the back of the boat when the engines were on. You'd have to put your hand over your fucking mouth, like fucking Joe Pesci and Deniro and casino. And then you could tell me, oh by the way, I burned down that guy's fucking house. MMM. So many. I mean, how the fuck I got onto that, that store. I don't think I ever told you guys that story cause I was so fucking mad about it for years. Um, oh, I know what I'm talking about is just talking about going to all these different games. Um, so be beware of that. If you ever go to the masters, unless you have a really good hook up, if you just going to buy from a a regular person, try to keep it at two.

Speaker 2:          00:23:25       Because what happened, because we were a group of five and they didn't have enough badges, uh, they decided like, we're going to have one group fucking pissed at us rather than having, you know, you know, three groups of two fucking pissed off guy.

Um, all right.

Speaker 2:          00:34:47       Oh, you know what? I didn't bring up. I've been watching of course, been watching him. The Celtics and the Bruins and all that Bruins had a big victory against the penguins before the all star break. Granted, Malkin wasn't playing, but it was still, we had played a great game and uh, I have to go down to nothing, if I remember correctly. And then the Celtics had been playing great and a big win against the bucks. Um, the fuck did they beat right before that? I watched like every one of them I really enjoy. I can't believe I'm back into NBA hoop. Um, okay, let me get to, um, let's get to some of the reeds here for this week. Uh, oh, Superbowls celebrations there. Billy bloodhound after. Don't ever tell you guys how much I love a bloodhound.

Speaker 2:          00:35:31       Ah, the fuck that amount of dogs that I fucking love. But I love that dog. You know, they just got that chilling out vibe. Any you gotta love a house cause all you have to do is go and they do it with you. That's it. That's all I need. That's all I was looking for this Valentine's Day. Okay ladies, if you really love your husband or your boyfriend, right? Just get, get them a bloodhound. Do you know? And then you can be as crazy as you want to fucking be. And all he has to do is just every once in a while be hanging out with his dog when you're not around, you know, he just looks over him. Hey Buddy, buddy.

Speaker 4:          00:36:09       Right.

Speaker 2:          00:36:11       It does it with them and it just makes you feel good. Maybe it's just me. I don't know. I heard you mentioned bloodhounds last week. I know you're not looking to get a dog anytime soon, but when you do definitely consider a bloodhound. They're unbelievably unbelievable with real young kids. I've had to, uh, with both my kids. Anyways, my question is if you ever have been to a Superbowl that's they're great with kids. That's good to know. Um, by the way, I keep getting updates with cleo. She's doing great. She's loving her new family and everything's awesome with her. And uh, I might do a show at some point in the vicinity of the new people that have the dog just to visit and say hello. I Dunno if I should do that or not. I don't know if it'll fuck the dog up or a, I feel just make me sad all over again.

Speaker 2:          00:36:59       I don't know what, but I still, you know what the fuck I just look at like, that's one of my kids and she's gone off to college and every once in a while I check in. How about that? Anyways, my question is, have you ever been to a super bowl or hung around for the week before? Seeing what all the action is like? Uh, my friend asked me if I wanted to go this year, but I'd rather watch it at home. I like to watch sports alone. Loved you. One cowherd. Go pats. Um, all right, here's the deal. Uh, I have been to two bowls. I went to the, uh, the Patriots when we played the Green Bay packers. Remember that? And Brett fat fucking through that touchdown pass and then took his helmet off and ran like half the fucking football field. Cause his agent told him to do that and give us a big astronauts smile when you do it right.

Speaker 4:          00:37:52       MMM.

Speaker 2:          00:37:55       That was cool. Just to be like the first time you go to a super bowl, if you ever lucky enough to go to one, there is that thing that you can't believe you're right. The thing that basically most of the United States is watching that you're there. Um, and I remember going down there, it was, uh, it was in New Orleans and, uh, and it was just all the patriots fans were a bunch of drunks. And then of course the Wisconsin fans who are the same level of drunks, but there's just something about Wisconsin, like the Midwest, there's a certain level of common decency, decency, I don't know what it is. I Dunno if they just don't go as hard. It's weird times you see him though,

Speaker 3:          00:38:36       then they're more animals than east coast people. But you know, it's, it's a, it's an ugly thing, you know? Uh, east coast sports fans were lunatics. So we're all up there screaming and yelling on one of those balconies. Fucking hammered down on Bourbon Street. Right. And, uh, John Kerry walked by and everybody was yelling that John Kay, John Kay, what do you think about the pages? Blah, blah, blah. And he just looked up and he had this big phony smile. Like, I, this is like an act out. You're not going to get it. But you know, you know that stupid like old school, like, you know, let's go get him. And you liked sort of like do the, the, you make a fist, right? And You Kinda, you kinda act like youth, you know, maybe throwing a baseball to home plate. You're like, yeah, they kind of do one of those, well he did it.

Speaker 3:          00:39:23       He did it like slow motion. He made the fist, he paused and he just went and they kind of throw it like that really slow. It was so fucking weird. He was so detached from his own body and I'm convinced now after I saw Bill Clinton do it, that they just know people are, uh, taking pictures of them so that they don't even give a fuck about interacting with you. It's all about what you look like in the paper. That was that time. I told you a long story, but I ended up Bill Clinton when he was still president. This is pre getting impeached and all that shit. He came down to Boston and uh, one of my friends wanted to go down and see the motorcade. I didn't want to fucking go. My buddy didn't want to go. He convinces us to fucking go. He's going to buy lunch three guy, five fucking right.

Speaker 3:          00:40:08       So we fucking go down there. He's all excited. He just wants to see the motorcade go by cause he'd saw swatch so much of that JFK shit. Um, you know, he just wanted to see a motorcade and that's like a big deal to see the presidential motorcade. I can admit that was pretty exciting to see. So they start coming down the street and right before they get to us, we're like, finally, here it comes. He's going to see the motorcade drive by then we get all fucking go home. You can buy us lunch. Right. Right before they got to us, they made a right turn to go into this alley right before they got to us, like, you know, probably like 50 yards up and like, oh you gotta be fucking kidding me. And this dude was so into like no one politics. He was just going like, oh don't worry, he's just going to go in there.

Speaker 3:          00:40:46       It's a woman's college. He usually speaks on average from 50 to 65 minutes. I'll go run and get us some, you know, a couple slices of pizza, whatever. So we go fine. So he fucking takes off and we're standing there and all of a sudden the secret service starts walking down the street telling everybody we were up against those little police little sorts things. Sounds get your hands up. He ends up in the morning. Kade starts driving w who's walking down the street? Fucking Bill Clinton with Ted Kennedy and somebody else. Ted Kennedy was first. I think I already told this story dude. His fucking head, I swear to God was the size of like a fucking safe. I've never seen a head that big of my life. Like I literally went to like, yeah, both your hands up so the secret service could see your hand and it was just sorta high fiving people.

Speaker 3:          00:41:33       Um, can I say walk by remembering that Bill Clinton comes by and every time like, oh to President Bill Clinton and he wasn't saying anything. He just had both his hands up. He was slowly walking and just imagine smiling with your mouth open. Like yeah, like you were doing that. But your face was just frozen. He was just walking past all of us doing that and everybody was yelling to him. Everybody was saying stuff and he did not say anything to anybody. He just had that Ah, fucking look on this face with both his hands up. He looked like a fucking crazy person. But then the next day, the front page of the paper, you see the guy and he's on the front page of paper like Ah, and it looked like we were all having a great time. I thought there was something wrong with them. Also, I will tell you right now, dude, these softest fucking hands of any guy ever, ever, he has not done a fucking days work of manual labor in his life, baby stuff.

Speaker 3:          00:42:30       Now that I have a daughter, baby soft fucking hands. That's how it gets the ladies. That's what it is. He puts one of those soft baby hands on your shoulders. It takes out a cigar and it is game set match. So anyways, he fucking does this shit. Then they jumped in the car and then they fucking leave. Everybody's freaking out and then then it's just over and people just start to walk away and leave. Okay. All of this took less than like 38 seconds. Okay. Because the secret service was not going to have to present and exposed to the public for that long. Um, so anyways, he jumps in the car, they leave everybody's like, like high off of, Oh my God, I shook the president's hand. Hoe Pig was Ted Kennedy's head. That takes about a minute for people to be like, what the fuck? And then people just start walking away and then like 15 seconds after that, my buddy comes walking up, the dude who wanted to see all of it and he just sees everybody has left.

Speaker 3:          00:43:32       I remember he was biting into a slice of pizza and he kind of stopped his bike and he just looks over and he goes, I missed it, didn't I? And I just looked at him and I felt bad. I was like, I shook his hand and he goes, no, you didn't. And then my buddy was a total pothead, was galloping around sideways, like in a circle, just screaming. I said, ah, that was such a fucking sad quiet ride home. And we would try not to fucking laugh. We just started laughing after awhile and he just refused to believe it. But the details we had, he knew that it was fucking true. And then the next day in the paper he saw, cause we saying like, dude, he wasn't saying anything. I'll never forget that. He just was like, ah, but without like that said noise he should have been making, but he wasn't making that noise. He just had his mouth open with his fucking hands up in the next day. In the paper though, he looked like a champ. The man looked like a champ. All right. Um, Jesus, I was a long way to go.

Speaker 2:          00:44:32       What was I talking about the first time I went to Superbowl? Yeah. So we went to it and uh, Bill Parcells fucked us over that year cause that was his whole fucking stupid thing like you will be cooked to do you get a little bit below the groceries because what's his face? Robert Kraft overruled him and said you should take Terry Glenn.

Speaker 4:          00:44:49       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:44:49       And fucking bill Parcells ego couldn't fucking handle that. Right. And then he proceeds to tell the team that he's leaving and then he put his fucking house up for sale before we even played the Goddamn game was one of the most selfish things. If that's true, that's the no, that's the room of what the fuck happened. And then, you know what kills me? He fucking goes to coach every place else. He goes to coach. Who does he bring along with them? Terry Glenn.

Speaker 4:          00:45:12       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:45:13       Unreal. Unreal. But whatever. Um, let's plow ahead here. Uh Oh. And then the second time I went, I went to the Patriots versus the ramps and we won that game obviously. And uh, when it last second and then I was just like, you know what, every time the Patriots go, I'm going to go to the super bowl. So the next time we played, which was either against the panthers or the eagles, I can't remember. I think the panthers, um, I was going to go, but the next day, um, I had like a six or 7:00 AM call time to do that Chappelle show, sketch a world series at dice

Speaker 2:          00:45:52       as the first time I met Charlene Murphy and all those guys. And so there was no way I could go and I was, you know, it was all upset like, Oh man, I'm going to miss the game and blah blah blah. But I got to tell you that Sunday night when the game was over and in, the Patriots won, you know, and I was sitting on my futon and my fucking poor excuse for a one bedroom in New York City. I remember when the game was over. I've watched it with a couple of friends and they were leaving, the game was over and I still had like two grand in my pocket cause that's basically back then what you were looking at drop and like if you could get tickets, we'd like 1500 bucks plus the hotel and all the travel and everything was gonna be another 500 bucks.

Speaker 2:          00:46:31       The end of the game when I still had two grand in my pocket, I was just like, yeah, you know what? This is better. I went, I saw him lose. I know what that feels like. I went, I saw him when I saw him when their first one in the last play. It's never going to get better than that. I'll go again some day when I have a kid. So some day my daughter, if she wants to go, I'll take her. But um, um, if you've never been, I would definitely go to, it's worth going one time. But you know, I was kind of all set back. This is back when I still just had the regular square TV. Forget about the flat screen now with the surround sound and all that shit. I don't know. Plus, I don't know. I just like watching the game rather than a, you know, I don't like everybody. All that shit talk and when your team loses or if you win, watching your fans talking shit to other people, it's just like we didn't have anything to fuck it. Do it, do with it, right? We, they got lucky or we get fucked. What are you going to do? All right. Paranoia or legit worry. Um, okay. Uh, hey. Hey, Bill. Birla check.

Speaker 3:          00:47:30       Uh, congratulations on your new baby. Huge fan of the podcast. I'm a 30 year old naturalized citizen who immigrated from South Korea when I was 10 as an immigrant and now a proud American. Um, I'm writing to you in regards to the current state of messy affairs going on at the White House. Why do you guys ask me this shit? You know, I'm just a comedian, or am I, I'm going to solve this problem. Do you still think that hill dog would have been just as bad as our current president? Uh, with Trump's reaction? I'm not so sure anymore. Hillary might've been corrupt, as you mentioned in your previous podcast, but I believe she would not have taken such a radical, brash action based on intolerance and hatred.

Speaker 4:          00:48:16       Yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:48:16       I'm not to that level, but they're going to keep the war's going. You haven't noticed cycle. Obama said he was going to end the wars. He was going to shut down Guantanamo. None of them did it.

Speaker 4:          00:48:25       Yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:48:25       They're not going to do it or I can't get into this type of shit. I look, if you believe that, that this government, the governments act on what is right for people, you know, rather than money. Everybody, everybody passed a certain level moves on money. That's it. Same thing in my business. Okay. Why don't they make better movies? Because they want to make money. Why? There's so many cliches, whether there's so many shitty wants. It's the same fucking thing. Um, do I think Hillary would do something like that? No, I do not. I don't think that she would do something like that, which you do a bunch of other evil things. My point in all of that shit, okay. When the amount of shit that Trump got during the election about being evil in a horrible fucking person, I never disputed any of that. But everybody was acting like Hillary was a good person.

Speaker 3:          00:49:16       I say to that she wasn't, and I was trying to get people to look at other options, which nobody's going to do because they just go, oh, that's a waste of a vote because you're not going to win anyway. So my thing with the American voters is you get exactly what you fucking deserve. If you don't have the balls to not fucking to do, not vote for the, the, the representative of the Republican and the Democrats who've been fucking you over since the day you've been born. And try to get outside of this and try to pick somebody from a different fucking party that actually wants to call out bankers and calls out a corporate corruption and deregulation and pharmaceutical companies and fucking, uh, genetically altered food. All of that shit that never gets fucking brought up with the fucking, the two guys who were, you know, the man or the woman or the two guys usually that are in the fucking, the, the showdown between the Republican and Democrat. You get what you fucking deserve. So this whole fucking thing now, because Trump's such a colossal fuck up, which everybody already knew. Okay. Um, for you now look at Hillary being like, well, you know, it's like you're looking two serial killers and Hilary Barry's the bodies, you know, fucking under a house and Trump leaves him out in the fucking street. Therefore you'd rather have Hillary. I mean, if that's, I don't know.

Speaker 1:          00:50:39       Okay.

Speaker 3:          00:50:39       But I, I can honestly tell you, you know, just my own feelings that she's not a good person. Trump is not a good person there too, horribly selfish fucking people. And I think a lot of people got caught up in the fact that with Hillary's fucking genitalia and the whole thought of, Oh my God, if there's a woman president, what does that mean for fucking women? It's just like every president in my lifetime has been a guy. What does that meant for me as a guy? Nothing. It doesn't mean anything like that. That's like that disease in my business. When you're a struggling artist and then all of a sudden you get a manager, an agent, you start thinking, when I could put my feet up, I don't have to work anymore. Yeah, you do. You're always gonna have to work. You know why? Because nobody gives a fuck about you.

Speaker 3:          00:51:21       And I hate to be so fucking bleak, but it's the truth. Nobody gives a shit. What Trump is doing is fucking horrible. It's not surprising. It isn't. In a weird way. It's actually causing a bunch of people to rally and push back against him. He's so fucking radical that I don't think he's going to survive. He's going to do a bunch of fucked up shit to like the midterm elections and he's going to be so fucking on a hand that people just going to run all the way to the other side of the boat. That's what always happens the same way after eight years of Bush, oh, let's all now let's all run over to the guys with the blue ties and the Blue Bras and you still get fucked, and then everybody runs over to the other side. So whatever. I'm trying not to be preachy here, but like you kind of get what you deserve.

Speaker 3:          00:52:01       If you're going to go through the insanity of continuing to vote for whoever the Democrats or the Republicans are going to give you at that level, and you're not gonna, you're not gonna start at least voting for these other people to encourage more people to run outside of those two fucking parties. Other than that, I don't know what to tell you. All right. I'm done ranting here. Anyways. He said, I remember on Conan you said everything will be the same under Trump. I really hope to God that you are right, dude. You know something. I'm getting so much shit for that Conan thing. You know something. Next time there's an election like that, you go on the day after the fucking thing and try to find some sort of a fucking angle,

Speaker 3:          00:52:41       you know, like it's my fault the day after the election that I say that, that Trump gets in. Okay. Everything has been the same under Trump. For a guy like me and for most fucking people, if you're Muslim, yeah, you're fucked. That absolutely fucking changed. Okay. But they were not showing those people. They were showing a bunch of white women crying. That's what the fuck they were showing. You know? And then they go, oh, the fucking planned parenthood and all of that type of shit. I mean, I don't, I don't fucking know. I mean like, I think people fucking hate Trump and for whatever reason they want to yell at a comedian. So continue to yell at me. You know, I told you they were both pieces of shit, but you know, after the election, I don't know. I just thought a lot of the screaming and yelling and fucking crying was, was a little much.

Speaker 4:          00:53:32       Yeah,

Speaker 3:          00:53:32       it was a little fucking much. I understand you disappoint but crying. It's just one so fucking pathetic. All right.

Speaker 4:          00:53:40       Okay.

Speaker 3:          00:53:41       You don't like the guy do what the fuck he can to fight back against them. You don't just fucking breakdown crying like somebody took your toy away. I Dunno. Maybe I'm too fucking not on a cynical.

Speaker 4:          00:53:53       MMM.

Speaker 3:          00:53:54       But I've gotten so many tweets you really don't get, yeah, you get a bug to shit change when Obama came in, but did it really fucking change, you know what I mean? Cause I guess for me actually true change what they would tell me. Where exactly do my federal income taxes go? Where does that go? If it goes to the fucking IRS and they are not, they are a private corporation of bankers. They are not connected to the government. Where does that fucking money go? Do the people at the upper echelon of the fucking Federal Reserve, do they actually even bother paying taxes considering they're paying themselves? There's a nationwide heroin epidemic that people are saying was created by the pharmaceutical companies, was not even fucking brought up.

Speaker 4:          00:54:45       Okay?

Speaker 3:          00:54:45       They genetically altered our food, which is evidently so fucked up. They got to try to force other countries to do it and they're fighting back against them because they don't want it. Inevitably, it's so fucked up that these people, they don't even want to be forced to label food is genetically altered cause they know people aren't going to buy it. There's all of that shit, all of that shit. Not only did not change under a president with a blue fucking tie,

Speaker 2:          00:55:11       it continued to get worse. So now when a guy like Trump does something so, so obvious, now everybody's all, oh my God, this guy's out of his fucking mind. Like this last guy. I mean, I'm not saying Obama is a bad fucking guy, but like it wasn't he just continuing on with the fucking warmongering and all of that shit. Am I out of my mind? Maybe I'm out of my mind. I don't know. See, I don't know bill. Maybe I'm paranoid, overreacting, just like those crazy liberal fucks out there, but I really do feel worried. It's one of those gut feelings that simmer deep down into your soul. I mean, come on. Even Gorbachev just said the world is preparing for war.

Speaker 4:          00:55:50       Okay?

Speaker 2:          00:55:51       Yeah, absolutely. But I don't think that's because of Donald Trump.

Speaker 4:          00:55:55       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:55:55       I just think he's yet another guy.

Speaker 4:          00:55:58       And if

Speaker 2:          00:56:00       they say the world,

Speaker 4:          00:56:02       okay,

Speaker 2:          00:56:02       the world is not Donald Trump. It's a bunch of fucking people.

Speaker 4:          00:56:07       Okay?

Speaker 2:          00:56:07       You know what it really is? I don't. I don't give into fucking hissy fits. You don't think clearly. You're breaking down crying and just screaming that the fucking sky is falling, falling. Then you're not going to make any rational decisions. There's a of groups that

Speaker 3:          00:56:24       are going to help out those people's at the airport that you can give money too. You can do shit like that and you can give money to them and you can pray to God that they're actually gonna use it on him and not use expense accounts and go out and buy themselves a fucking corvette. So I don't have any answers, but I will say this to people. You got to stop looking,

Speaker 2:          00:56:45       you know?

Speaker 4:          00:56:46       Okay.

Speaker 3:          00:56:46       I Dunno. I Dunno. I Dunno what it is about standup Comedians, but we, for some reason, our get our feet held to the fire more so than people who are actually in the governmental positions. Um,

Speaker 4:          00:56:58       okay.

Speaker 3:          00:56:58       You know, you want to get mad at me because of what the fuck I said on the day after the fucking election on Conan, by all means do that. But, you know, I bet there was how many of those fucking women at that women's fucking rally, how many of them you think actually voted? You know what I mean? All it is fucking outrage. Where were you on election day? I mean, there's been, there's been people who've got busted bitching about Trump. They didn't even fucking vote, you know, but, uh, whatever, give me shit because I joked around when it was like a fucking funeral out here in Hollywood. I was just trying to calm people down. I just see, you know, you see a bunch of adults crying on television. Yeah, it's unsettling.

Speaker 4:          00:57:46       Okay,

Speaker 3:          00:57:47       this is what it thinks that it happened. I think this guy is going to go fucking sideways and then he's going to go sideways. The midterm elections, what's going to happen? He says, just going to get a bunch of fucking Democrats in there to maybe level this guy out. But in the meantime they'll keep deregulate, deregulating the banks and all of that other shit. And in the end of the day, guys like Trump will be able to build a golf course in a fucking pipeline under and over any native American land that they want to. That's what the fuck they want to do. Peep, they're so rich, they find the government to be in

Speaker 2:          00:58:16       nuisance. That's what the fuck you're dealing with. And um, I don't know if that's what I think. All right, so there you go. And once again, I don't read or pay attention, so fuck off. Uh, and God bless the United States of America. All right, advice from a new fellow dead. Hey Billy boy, congrats to you. And the lovely Nia on the new baby. My wife and I welcomed our first son about five weeks ago. People would try to give you too much advice early on, but I've discovered the only secret, uh, you need to know about babies is that snap suck in zippers. Rule baby's shit all damn day a. See you're taking onesies on and off all day. He don't need the added frustration of fumbling with dozens of snaps to get a one C's. So get onesies with zippers and that's all you really need to know. Congrats. And go again and go fuck yourself. That's a great one. That's actually great. I'm going to use that because I dealt with snaps all last night. Um, all right, selfish girl friend advice. Hey Bill, you're gruff.

Speaker 4:          00:59:19       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:59:19       Hey Bill, you gruff ginger Bollix

Speaker 3:          00:59:22       I love the podcast. Brutally honest. It's great. You're like, whoa. Anyway, I got a girl who most of the time is great. Uh, she's really hard, really smart, really fun. They always start this way, but every so often she just seems totally fucking selfish. Most of the time. I totally mile her Meyer, her ethics slash morals important. Right? Yeah. So she's human. Most of the time she's cool and every once in a while she's just got this thing you don't like. Well, we celebrated our third anniversary yesterday, by the way. I'm 28, she's 27. We went out to a Sushi restaurant for a bit of a celebration. It gets time to pay the bill. And I say, I'll pay in cash if she transfers me her half. Oh God, Dude. He goes, from that moment on, on the night was all silent treatment till we started arguing. Then it went back to silence till we went to sleep. Yeah. Cause that's that weird thing where it's like you're celebrating your anniversary, but for some reason you have to pay. Um, yeah. That's where all the feminism goes out the fucking window right there. That's always a great sleep when there's an unresolved issue. Uh, I'm not even a big believer in the guy just paying,

Speaker 3:          01:00:36       I'm not a big believer in the guy just paying the bill, but okay. On special occasions it's done. It's the done thing. So I'll go along with it. But I didn't this time because the week before my laptop fucked up and I had to sacrifice my TV, my camera's stuff and media center stuff. I love to make enough cash to get a decent replacement so I can work slash keep applying for new jobs. Also, I've been between jobs and money's a bit tight right now. In short, it's not been a great week. You'd think she'd be a bit understanding about it given the circumstances, but no. Hey, you'll make an all decent points here. Anyways, we had a fight about it. Um, when quiet again, then we did what we do sometimes and just let it go rather than either ups or either of us having to apologize.

Speaker 3:          01:01:22       Oh, that's not good. She says the argument was me not treating her like a lady. I see. This is his fucking, I dunno, this is this thing that you can't win as a guy, you know, they want to be treated just like a guy when it's something good is at stake. But when a bill comes, like I'm a lady, I say it was about, it was not about me paying for everything. I'm up til the bill. We were having a great time. I was psyched about a call for a great job I had gotten earlier. She was psyched for me. Then she throws a fucking moody, like a fucking infant who's toys been taken away because I want to split the bill. I don't know, maybe I'm insane. My friend says it was a school boy error. I don't think we're kids in a bit, in a bit of grownup consideration called for this situation. But anyways, have at me, if I'm being a moron, give me both barrels. Um, dude, uh, all of this shit

Speaker 2:          01:02:20       that you said to me, you need to say to her. I mean, minus the fuck's in some of the other stuff. Culinary child. I wouldn't do any of that, but um,

Speaker 4:          01:02:29       okay.

Speaker 2:          01:02:29       You know, your relationship is going to be a lot easier if you start communicating. So, um,

Speaker 4:          01:02:34       yeah,

Speaker 2:          01:02:35       maybe you could a preface it with, hey, you know, I know we're celebrating our anniversary. I know I'm supposed to pay as a guy, but I'm kinda tight. Can you blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. I Dunno.

Speaker 4:          01:02:45       Okay.

Speaker 2:          01:02:45       I know I just,

Speaker 4:          01:02:47       okay.

Speaker 2:          01:02:47       I don't, I don't get all of that shit wear. Why the guy has to pay. It's your relationship and the woman never pays. You know, if you notice all the advertising, hey, Valentine's Day's coming up. It's all about what the guy has to get the woman.

Speaker 4:          01:03:03       MMM.

Speaker 2:          01:03:05       That's something you don't hear what the fucking woman's March. Just basically how the male female relationship is set up is that the guy should just be constantly showering her with money and gifts because she had the decency to, uh, you know, spend her time with you. It's like her time has value. Yours does not, you know, I don't get it. It's like, Hey, I can be fucking doing other things too, rather than the ones you've talking about your day. Same as you've got to listen to me.

Speaker 3:          01:03:37       It's not our works. Anyways, cigar recommendation. Hey, they're a freckle tits. I had been sober and more importantly off the cigarettes for over a month now. Graduations to celebrate this, I decided to treat myself to a nice cigar while I watched your new stand up special on the 31st. Any recommendations on a good smoke? Thanks. And Go fuck yourself. Um,

Speaker 4:          01:03:55       okay.

Speaker 3:          01:03:56       Well if you're off cigarettes, I don't know why he'd smoke a cigar, but if you're going to, then you don't have access to a Cuban cigar. Um,

Speaker 4:          01:04:05       okay.

Speaker 2:          01:04:05       I like those.

Speaker 4:          01:04:08       Okay.

Speaker 2:          01:04:08       The Aurora emeralds.

Speaker 4:          01:04:10       Okay.

Speaker 2:          01:04:11       And I like, uh, this, um, the Davidoff Nicaraguan adverse, he turned me on to and the Casa Magna, the, uh, the torpedo one's got the two bands, I forget which one it's called. I like those ones, but I kind of quit smoking to be honest with you. I think I'm done with it. I might have the occasional fucking cigar, but uh, you know, now that I'm getting life insurance and it's just like, all right, I got to get this nicotine out of my system. So I can pass the fucking test and everything. When I saw the difference in rates, just even being a passive smoker, I was just like, wow. Uh, they obviously know that this means this shit's gonna fucking kill you. So it was kind of like, who am I fooling here if I just cleaned myself up? So I think I'm kind of done. Like, I'll smoke a cigar. I'm okay.

Speaker 4:          01:04:55       Okay.

Speaker 2:          01:04:56       I don't know. I'll smoke a cigar. What you suppose towards an actual moment

Speaker 3:          01:05:01       as opposed to just being like, ah, man, I always smoked cigars and now I'm kind of feeling that itch to smoke when saw smoke one. But anyways, I got to get running here. I gotta go do Conan. I'll say some more shit probably about politics. And then you guys can now give me shit. Like I'm the one fucking running things. I told you a long time ago. I don't read a that's it. Go fuck yourselves and I'll check in on you on Thursday. Bye.
