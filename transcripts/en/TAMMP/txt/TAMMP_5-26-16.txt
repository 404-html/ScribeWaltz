Go over there. You know, stare at you. Pasty constancy. Where my freckles came from. That's what I'm doing. Oh, I can't wait. I cannot fucking wait. You know we are knee deep neck deep into writing this season. We've got the table read here and a couple hours for episode five, episode five, um, and we do six, seven, eight in June and then nine and 10 in July. And then we fucking edit them for the next 10 months, not even 10 months, whatever. For the next six months we'll be adding in all this fucking shit and we'll basically have them and then they'll come out may of next year and you guys will sit down with a six pack of beer and you'll burn through them in about three hours and a like where the to the next one. And you know what, we'll make you some more cause we're having a great time, but I'm not going to lie to you. Um, it has become my life and I don't know what the fuck's going on at all. I know that Donald Trump was here yesterday, um, having a rally down in fucking Anaheim, um,

Speaker 1:          00:04:39       which I thought was pretty perfect for him to be head down towards Orange County with whatever the fuck it is on his head to talk to a bunch of people that, you know, whatever the fuck they did to their face. You know, I swear to God, Hollywood gets such good, so much shit for like, you know, like everybody out here has plastic surgery. I'm not saying they don't, but at least it's decent. Jesus Christ, you go down a fucking orange county with all those real housewives and those Wa Bruce Jenner looking dudes. You know what I mean? Remember Bruce was still Bruce Bevan when Caitlin was still Bruce and uh, the dude had his eyes done, you know, and the nose and all that. They all had like, those fucking, I think at did bit about that. My Act, I got, we'll have the Bruce Jenner eyes and I used to, I thought it was bullshit. I was, you know,

Speaker 1:          00:05:24       you know, my wife would watch the real housewives of a housewives of Orange County. I'd be like, all right. They picked the six biggest psycho couples. They could find people down here. Don't look like this. And then I went down to Irvine. I was playing the Improv and I walked around the mall and I was like, wait a minute, wait a minute. These fucking people at the, I don't know what they're doing out here. I think when you get into warmer client climates and people have to wear less clothes, they really start doing the plastic surgery shit. You know what I mean? All you guys in those winter climates, you can hide in your puffy coats, you know, sport coat, buttoned down shirt. I'll never forget that. When I used to work in a warehouse when I was a young lad, full head of hair, fucking abs, the whole thing.

Speaker 1:          00:06:09       Half as many freckles, you know, sunny outlook on life. Oh, it was a long time ago. I remember once a year we'd have the company picnic and all these fucking suits who look like they were in at least halfway decent shape. They'd showed up. They show up at t shirts and Holy Shit, Jesus Christ, the fucking rolls just fucking spilling up, pushing out the fuck tee shirts. It was horrific. I just remember looking at these people going, this guy's wearing the company this time I'm taking orders from this tub of shit. And they could feel it too. It could feel it. Um, it felt the eyes looking at him. Shame. You can shame people. Good fat, shame people back in 88, 89. Not Anymore. Not Anymore. Now I'm, now I'm the problem. Right. It's not their fucking 8,000 calories a day. You know, it's what happened to them when they were six.

Speaker 1:          00:07:00       That's why they're written fucking ice cream with candy bars in it. I'm sorry. Anyways, let's plow ahead here. Yes. So I have absolutely no idea what the fuck is going on at anywhere, at anytime. Anything. All I know is I'm in a fucking writers from now evidently meet me in St Louis. Louis meet me at the fair. Evidently my Saint Louis Blues loss last night, you know, they came back, they tied it up for games. There's two games to two. And that's the last game I saw. Cause I've been stuck in this fucking room and I forgot to tape the last couple of times. Um, you know, cause we, you know, we had one every once in a while, you just have a fucking a story and you're trying to do it. Everybody's got 15,000 notes. You know, this isn't tracking. It's not on the page. I don't think we earned this.

Speaker 1:          00:07:50       What's the motivation? You've got to raise the stakes. And for those of you not in the business, that means you're not going to see anybody you love for the next 48 hours. So I missed everything. Evidently, according to people on Twitter, the sharks gave the blues, the old right there, Fred, and gained five and six sit down and shut the fuck up. My condolences to blues fans. Um, I know you wanted more, but a great season. You know, you're beat the fucking blues. You beat the fucking stars and then you lost it. The fucking sharks. All right. And I believe it was meatloaf who said to add a three. Sorry. Um, yeah, it's, that's fucking brutal, man. Especially when you get that deep into the playoffs and then it's just fucking over and then you just sit in there and like, now what do I do while you live in Saint Louis? This is what you do. You go to a cardinals game and you'll watch the rams pack up and leave your city, and this is what you should do. Rather than crying in your fucking Peyton Manning, partially owned beer. Um, what you should do is, uh, you guys ought to fucking talk to the Arizona cardinals. Tell him to come back, you know? I mean, that's what I would do. Oh, what's your bill? No, I wouldn't, I wouldn't even know how to begin. I wouldn't know how to begin to go about doing something like that.

Speaker 4:          00:09:11       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:09:12       Yeah. I mean, I would have no idea how to, I have no idea how to go about anything. I'm one of those fucking guys, you know what you should do. You should fucking do this. So yeah, how do you, how do you do that? And I'm like, I'm like, I'm like Donald Trump, except I'm not running for president and I'll build a fucking wall between here and Mexico. I'm going to make Mexico pay for it. Oh yeah. How are you gonna do that, Donald? Ah, the fucking guy. Can you fucking believe that? That, I mean, it's fun. It's, it's

Speaker 1:          00:09:42       Ben and Hillary Clinton. I cannot believe people are going to fucking vote for either one of them. I just cannot fucking believe it. Unfucking believable. They'll vote for Hillary Clinton. They'll put her in fucking office and then bitch, that nothing changed. How many fucking yeah, times. Remember that Shit. We're going to fuck it. We got a new guy. We got hope. It's going to end the war. Close down. Guantanamo Bay. It's a nothing fucking chair. Nothing changed. It's exact fucking shape. Dig. And he got this fucking jerk off. Who's just, Oh, he just says this. No matter what. You bring up a Donald. What's up with your shirt? This is the best shirt. I have the best shirts. I'll have the best shirts of any president ever. And this a fucking zillion people losing their fucking minds going, this guy, this guy's going to turn it around. I guess.

Speaker 1:          00:10:36       He said the other day, you took a physical, he's 69 years old. And he said, the doctor said he had the, I have these set, I had the, I have the best body, the best body of any 69 year old he's ever seen. Like how do you not see like, you know what he's like, remember that guy who wrote the twist Karma. Let's do the twist, right? And the next summary comes out, hey, write another hit song. Uh, twist again, luck. We're dead last summer. It's the same fucking song. The guy actually breff reference back. Like, you know, do you remember when I wrote the same song? It was a year ago. Um, the fuck was that guy's name. I know it wasn't Charlie Pride Chubby checker. You know what's worse about anytime you bring up Chubby Checker, then somebody always has to tell you the story of how he got his name. Well, you know, there was fats, Domino's. They said fats. Gebbie domino checker. Yes. Everybody's heard that story. We all saw Dick Clark tell that story and then everybody told it in the fucking bars. You can't. Um, anyways, so. Oh, I haven't given you guys the update on my side. I had a uh, oh, sorry. Um, I think I found the cure for it.

Speaker 3:          00:11:57       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:11:59       I have not sat down for more than fucking, I dunno, six seconds for the last like 48 hours and it seems to be doing wonders for me. That's the hardest thing about having Sattik. Although one I drive to the fucking office and come back. Um, I basically stand up in the writer's room and when I'm sick of standing, I just laid down on the floor like one of those fucking animals at the airport. Some of the pictures you guys are sending me to a fucking hilarious. This guy sent me one with this guy was like, you know, they have the row of chairs. He was sleeping underneath them, like perpendicular to them. So he had his legs, his ass in his lower back were underneath the chair laying on his front. And then he was like holding onto like his hooded sweatshirt that he was using as a pillow. He had that all wrapped with his head on the side. Like a, like a little kid sleeping with the stuffed animals.

Speaker 3:          00:12:56       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:12:58       I mean like how long is your flight been delayed that you, you just lost that much?

Speaker 3:          00:13:04       I Dunno.

Speaker 1:          00:13:05       Respect for yourself that you're going to fucking late. I mean, it was kitten who, I mean, I get on a plane every once in a while. It's a long fucking flight. You know, you might kick your shoes off, you got your socks on and you keep your socks on top of your shoe. She might do something like that for a minute. Provided your feet don't fucking stink. Provided you took a shower that day. You got on some fucking fairly new socks and a fairly new pair of sneakers. It's not the wrong with that, but Jesus Christ and he started walking around the fucking plane going into the bathroom animals. So anyways, anyways, let me, let me, uh, let me get back to the sports here. So the blues are knocked out, the sharks have made their first final, um, the calves kicked the fuck out of the, the, the raptors as far as I know. And I've only, you know, like I said, I just watch highlights of this shit. Dumb ass fucking move was the raptors to start doing the a wagging the finger. Why would you do that? You know, hey, we're finally starting to win here. Why don't we a piss off the calves and get them more motivated? They only have Lebron fucking James, you know, um, and Okc is in the process of raping the, uh,

Speaker 3:          00:14:19       yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:14:20       the fuck are they? The California seals who they play in Golden State Warriors.

Speaker 3:          00:14:25       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:14:27       Jesus Christ. And I've missed all of it. And I don't know anybody on any fucking team. I mean other than the stars, I know those guys. So I'm going to shut up about it, but I am, tonight I'm going to tape game seven of the pens lightening. And I'm also gonna take the, uh, the OKC game cause I want to see if they're going to close out the warriors.

Speaker 3:          00:14:45       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:14:47       And then, you know, you know, it's funny, all you need to do is just watch highlights and you could, you could still host a show. You know,

Speaker 5:          00:14:52       I got to tell you right now, formal on whoever makes the finals in the east, let's say Cleveland wins. I'll tell you a form of Cleveland Cavaliers or you got to be concerned with do to durable Oklahoma Sturdy, considering they beat the Spurs, they beat the warriors, it'll to perennial favorites taught the worst. Um,

Speaker 1:          00:15:12       that's amazing. The shit that they're doing out there. I wish I was watching it and I didn't, so I'm going to shut up about it all right before it, it's any more excruciating to all you cons out there. Um, yeah. So we're sitting there out right in the fucking show and there's all these Goddamn fucking like storm troopers driving up and down the street. If you see those, those fucking lunatics, cops like this, the riot gear, once you know that you, you'd think you'd only see them, you'd think you'd only see them in like countries where they have like a dictator, you know, with a truck is driving down the street and they're standing on the outside of it, holding onto it like just, just way, way over the top. Like what the fuck? I've thought I lived in a democracy. What the fuck is that? Uh, they were driving over to like Jimmy Kimmel because Trump was going to go over there and say that he was the greatest panel guests ever. Um,

Speaker 4:          00:16:11       yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:16:12       and they're fucking driving over there like lunatics. One of the biggest bullshit things ever is that in this country you're allowed to protest. It's such bullshit. You're not, you show up to protest, you standing there with your sign and then the cops come down and they beat the shit out of you. That's basically what happens. Or you file for a permit and they tell you where you can protest and it's down the street and an up over a fucking hill. And if we even remotely raise your voice, you get a Billy club to the face. And that's pretty much every single fucking country out there that considers itself a democracy. Now, the ones that have a fucking dictator, you're not even allowed to do it. They just come out and they shoot you. So I guess, you know, compared to getting shot, it's fucking unbuilt. I just don't fucking get it. Why, what is wrong with a bunch of people chanting with signs? I'm not talking about the people start jumping on cop cars, cause those are the guys that they always show. But even if you don't do that, they just come down and they beat the fuck out of you. Um, I'd hate to have that job as a cop.

Speaker 1:          00:17:20       It's gotta be so weird driving down there going like, wait a minute. These are fellow Americans. They're protesting. This is the sign of a healthy democracy. And then you got your guy, what are tear you to slam a club on their fucking head. You know, you're going to ask me. Ha Ha. Um,

Speaker 1:          00:17:40       but they had like all these fucking trucks and she, they were just flying up and down the fucking street, you know, and then they'll put it on the news and there'll eight people that were flipping the fuck out and that's all they're going to show. And then the other thousand that's showed up and were just short a standing there and they're all going to get defined by them. You know, it works well. I guess I'm doing that to the cops. Right. Defining them by all the ones that beat the fuck out of him. That's what I like to do. People, I'd like to make a point and then I like to just completely fucking destroy everything that I said. You know what, this, this podcast just be, just, just be called the, I have no answers. I have arguments, but I have no answers.

I'm just, I'm on, I'm on Twitter and up, whatever reason, I'm just fucking looking at shit. And I put my phone on silence and I turned all the volume down cause knee is sleeping next to me. And then there was a video and I clicked on it and I thought because everything was off that I could just fucking watch it with the sound down. You know, I was watching all those things for people. Somebody falls down and they put it to a song, you know, and there was somebody doing like those fucking, you know, a burnout spinning around and shit and fucking slammed into this guy.

And then I hit another one, like an ass hole, wasn't thinking, I just wanted to see what happened to this person. And she fucking sat up and she literally did the Ralph Kramden, she just goes out the fucking door and I wanted to start laughing, but I knew she was going to get mad at me and then she just went back to sleep and I didn't leave.

Read for a number five next week we write all week. We don't have a table read and then three weeks in a row we do episode six, seven, eight week off just writing, no table read. And then nine 10 and then I'm fucking done in the writer's room and maybe my fucking ass over here can fucking stop sending an electric jolts down my fucking leg laying down to the room. Now I feel like fucking like some Howard Hughes without the money.

Speaker 1:          00:29:09       This fucking wolf man nails. You know, I saw somebody the other day when I was in the airport and they were playing classical guitar, you know what I mean? And it sounded beautiful. But the only thing that sucks about playing classical guitars, you got to grow your nails like a fucking wolf man. You know one on one of your hands and it's all good when you sit and down playing guitar. But the second you put your guitar down, you know, you just, it looks fucking gross. And I had on my mind and I guess that's no reason to stop because a instruments, you always have to pay the price for like trumpet trumpets, one of them, you know?

Speaker 4:          00:29:46       Okay,

Speaker 1:          00:29:47       start playing the trumpet. You get that fucking Callus on your, on your, on your lip. You know, it's one of my favorite instruments ever. I love the fucking trumpet, but I would never play it, play it because I wasn't willing to pay the price. And plus I knew I would only be okay at it. Who wants to be okay with it. Fucking trumpet, callous. Um, not this guy. I'll tell you that right now. All right, now here we go. I'm going to give you my predictions for all the games, sixes and sevens out there. And a, you can take all of these predictions to the bank and they won't give you shit for him cause I haven't watched any of these series. Um, the goal of the Golden State Warriors will,

Speaker 4:          00:30:29       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:30:30       When

Speaker 1:          00:30:33       the next Guy Willie, I dunno, I didn't see the game. All I know is everybody said the exact same thing. I'll tell you, this team is a lot longer and a lot more towel to the near used to seeing. Everybody did a version of that. I guess they're long and they're talented and uh, the warriors haven't seen anything like this even though they played Oklahoma during the regular season, but I don't think they were looking at them. All right. The uh, Tampa Bay lightning will win game seven tonight. All right, so I feel like I'm o for two are ready. And what else did we got? The calves. Oh, the calves are one and the next one, that fucking series is over. You don't fucking wag your finger and fucking Lebron James face or any of his teammates are. Yeah. To your fucking mind, you know all these fucking actors running around bulking up, putting on their fucking underoos, playing these superheroes, right.

Speaker 1:          00:31:28       And all these fucking nerds going down to fucking checkout. Who could fucking be when the Hawk or captain America. And what about Thor? Well he's calling, he's stupid. He just says a hat and a hammer, you know, if you cut his hair is fucking hammer breaks all this fucking bullshit, you know? And then you get these fucking comic con [inaudible] who actually dress like superheroes for real and walk around and try and stop crime. You know what I mean? Cause they just so want the superheroes to be real. Well just go to a cavs game. You stupid cunt and watch Lebron James. Okay. Lebron James could grab Batman and Robin in one fucking hand. Throw him through a plate glass window and he'd still get the end one if someone was hanging off his other fucking arm. Okay. Just go buy a ticket and sit down like a fucking gentleman stopped standing in line with fucking 50 people dress like Chewbacca and an an aqua man down in San Diego. Whatever the fuck you go. Cause he can sit down and talk to the cast of a, I don't fucking and one of those God damn shows. What does, what does, what does, uh, what does a car, I guess mine's a comic con show hot now that I think about it. Jesus. I hope they don't play that audio. If we ever do that show, well maybe they, what are they going to do?

Speaker 1:          00:32:47       Throw some of their rough action figures still in the box at me. You know why it's worth more if it's still in the box. Ah, I can't say why. I can't say ah, you know why it was fucking Weirdos. Cause you know it hasn't been anywhere disgusting. Um, happy red nose day. What is this here? A people send me this. Twitter is for kids. You red nose. Fucko so he just told me what the red nose thing is for. He goes, it's, it's for kids. Oh. Is that what it's for? It's for kids. All that explains it. I Dunno why I'm such a Douche, but I fucking cannot stand. I can't fucking stand when a bunch of celebrities get behind a fucking cause and there's a fucking ribbon or a God damn nose and they, I don't know why. I just, it drives, I know it's a good cause behind the cause, but I fucking hate it. And then everybody's going to find their own unique way to have the nose on their face. How they're going to fucking hold it. It's just, it just drives me up the fucking wall. That and famous people telling me who to vote for.

Speaker 4:          00:34:02       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:34:02       Oh, you know what? I didn't know who to vote for. And then you told me. I mean, I guess I bitch about it, but I'm not telling you who to vote for. I don't fucking know, like, make a fucking 20 minute video. Here's why you should vote for fucking Freddy. Fuckface you know, we're running out of water. Ah, shut up. Um, you know what's funny about what I just said? I could literally just stare in the mirror and say that to myself. And a lot of ways, right. I never tell you who to vote for. I just make fun of the people you do vote forth. That's what I do. You want some comb over orange haired cont why don't you just vote for me instead of Donald Trump? The fuck is wrong with you. I have the greatest podcast ever.

Speaker 4:          00:34:48       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:34:49       Nobody tells a shit joke like me.

Speaker 4:          00:34:52       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:34:52       This club owner told me after it, 40 years of running a club, he's never seen shit jokes like my shit jokes. Um, speaking of which, I'm actually doing a of both. Where the fuck you want to vote for? I don't give a fuck. It's not going to change anything. We're a bunch of animals and we're doomed to destroy each other. So, you know, get yourself a dog and a hobby, you know, find somebody you like, treat them nice. Said a, that'd be great. They'll stay with you and when the whole thing goes down, you'll have someone to hug.

Speaker 4:          00:35:21       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:35:22       Jason. Um, anyways, I did that. Made me lose my complete train of thought. Oh, tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight. Hello. Um, what was Phil Collins Thinking in the 80s? Jesus Christ. He's such a great musician of the worst fucking songs. After, after raw [inaudible], um, then all of a sudden he was doing, you can't hurry love after. You can't hurry love. Then you did that song easy lover was decent and then it just went off the fucking rails. It's a studio.

Speaker 6:          00:36:00       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:36:00       And that one where he was yelling at you, you know, telling us to think twice because it's another day for you. A mean paradise. You know, when you see a homeless person, it's like, hey, fuck head. You know, the way I'm living compared to the way you're living. You don't need to look at a homeless guy. Just look at me. She felt lucky. When you look at me, you don't have to go all the way down to that level. Do you? You're fucking castle. Um, tonight I'm going to be down at the comedy still, uh, uh, doing a benefit for kids. That's another one, but I won't be wearing a red nose. Uh, but I will be jumping around like a fucking clown. This is for, uh, you know what? I don't know what it's for. It's for sick kids in hospitals. I have no idea. All I know is whoever put it together. Uh, I don't know. I trust them. Steve Simone. I trust the guy. So I figured, you know, I figure it's on the up and up. Who knows? I don't fucking, I don't pretend to know things. Um, hey, is anybody out there who listens to this? Are you one of those fucking riot police guys that rides on the outside of the truck? And when you do it as much as your adrenaline is going up, do you ever just think of how fucking ridiculous it is?

Speaker 6:          00:37:12       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:37:13       You know, like what are we doing here? We got to get over to Jimmy Kimmel. Donald Trump is there, um, what's going to happen? Uh, all right. And I think, I, I think I pissed off enough people with this one. All right, go. Um, I have a great weekend you cunts and I will talk to you on that

Speaker 6:          00:37:31       Monday. And like I said, you can take all of those predictions to the bank, but I don't think [inaudible]

Speaker 7:          00:39:07       hey, what's going on? It's bill burr.

Speaker 8:          00:39:09       Yeah. Isn't that exciting? It's the, it's the Monday morning podcast. How are you? Thanks for coming to my page and thank you for listening and thank to it's Memorial Day. So here we go. Something Nice. Thank you to all the men and women who are serving this country right now. Sweating our asses off over there in Iraq. Uh, I don't know what you're supposed to say today. Do you say Happy Memorial Day? I don't think you do. It doesn't seem, uh, fitting. I Dunno what I'm trying to see if there's a memorial day parade out here in La and it's the, if so, where would it be? You know what I mean? And you, well, Memorial Day parade is a very, uh, serious thing. So I can't picture the parade going down sunset honoring the fallen men and women who've served this country is the parade goes by the fucking saddle ranch, you know, is two whores and watching some shithead write a fake horse.

Speaker 8:          00:40:11       You know what I mean? I just don't know where they will have it out here. I'm really not up on the parades out here in la since I moved out here. I know they had the gay pride parade and all that's an Halloween. Um, that one's always hilarious and confusing. I've never understood the gay pride parade. You know, they spend fucking 51 weeks out of the year trying to be like, look, we're normal. We're just born this way. Okay. For the love of God. Stop tying as defense posts in Wyoming. All right, we're not against God. We just wired this way. You know? And then they, they had the gay pride parade and you'd think they'd come down the street, you know, try and look a little bit respectable. What happens? Everybody's coming down the street with a Dick and the hand, they got fucking, I just don't get it.

Speaker 8:          00:41:01       You know, it's just a Goddamn free for all the fucking spectacle. I definitely recommend seeing if you ever want to just, uh, if you ever wanted to see what 300 would look like, if that's what it looks like. It looks like that movie 300 with dildos cause everybody's shredded. I don't know what gate. Why is it a gay guy put out like a fucking exercise video? You know what I mean? It's always these, these uh, he's half of fat guys who actually heterosexual and that we standing on a beach, nobody is more shredded that then those, those gay dudes, I don't know what it is. There are, there are weights in those deldot's is that what it is? Dhea, Dhea fucking bloom to the wall and you do pull ups for something. Oh, speaking of that shit, I know a few weeks ago I was talking about, you know, wanting to get in shape and uh, I actually, I, I, you know some about that [inaudible] x system and a couple of people said it was bullshit ever.

Speaker 8:          00:42:07       The people said that they'd liked it. All I know is like, you know, 200 bucks in like 58 DVDs. I was like a time life series, you know, on how to get abs or something. And it was just a, it was too overwhelming. And I go on the road too much. So I found the solution. I, uh, went online and I bought some, uh, I bought rings, you know, those rings with a gymnast. Shoes. I'm going to put up a chin up bar today and I swear to God by the end of the year I'm going to learn how to do a fucking iron cross. And, uh, I just watched that gymnastic shit and I'd missed, nobody is more shredded than those dudes. And there's something I like about being able to lift your own body weight. You know what I mean? That, you know, if you can like climb up a fucking building, I think that's way better than being able to bench press a car.

Speaker 8:          00:43:00       Maybe it depends on the situation that you're in. You know, some fat fucks sitting on your chest going, what are you going to do? Well, what are you gonna do? But we do, we're gonna do like, I guess then if you could bench 400 pounds, that would be like a good thing. But, uh, I dunno. House fire, you being chased by somebody. If you go up the fucking building like Spiderman. I think that, I think that that's uh, I have to think that, that, that's always better. That'd be a cool thing. Jesus Christ. They can't get it out bill. I'm like, I think, I think I did it. They did that they thought you said, I thought you said you wanted one spider. Um, yeah. So we'll see if I can get you the website. Here is what this is. This is what this podcast is becoming. It's becoming me informing you on the fucking whacked out shit that I do. All right. This is the training rings is where I went to and uh, www.training rings.com and check it out, man. I want to be able to do one of those muscle ups. You know what? I'm gonna start wearing really tight tee shirts on a on stage and then I'll be ready for the gay pride parade. I brought it full circle.

Speaker 8:          00:44:13       All right, before I get into the podcast, those of you who are on our new to my podcast, I basically, I do one of these every week and, uh, people send me advice. Sometimes people ask me advice, people send me questions. I try to ask for them, answer them. I mean, the best of my ability. Um, I dunno, and you know, I don't read, I just sorta start talking. So don't really listen to me. Just I hope I make you laugh or some shit and I hype upcoming shit that I have like this week. Um, May 24th, I have a real busy week this week, May 24th, um, the next installment of the uninformed show with bill and Joe to Rosa, my radio show, our radio show, me and Joe that we do on Xm two o two was going to be this Saturday night, May 24th, uh, on Xm two o two from 9:00 PM to 12 midnight.

Speaker 8:          00:45:09       Uh, I'm going to be a Caroline's comedy club this week, but it's going to be weird. I'm going to be there Thursday, not on Friday, Saturday and Sunday. Why aren't you going to be there on, on Friday bill? Um, because I have to fly back to la because I'm doing standup on an award show. Oh my God. Are you going to be doing standup at the Oscars now? I'm going to be doing stand up at the Spike TV awards show. I don't know. I never heard of it either. But, uh, I'm actually Kinda, I dunno, like psyched. I never got to do an award show, so, uh, I'll let you guys know when and when, uh, when that's going to be and a usual that that part of the podcast sucks. Whenever I hype what I have coming up, I don't know. The whole thing starts to grind to a halt.

Speaker 8:          00:46:02       I Dunno. And then I never have half the fucking information. It's ridiculous. So, uh, all right, before I get into my, my rent for the week, uh, I actually, because it is memorial day and I actually got a really cool email from somebody who's over there. I don't know if they're in the army or the marines. I'm assuming it's one of those two branches because they're uh, the appear to be on the ground over there. It says, I hope to get back to the states and come to see you sometime. A quick story and it was on a mission the other day and I picked up the radio and called to my lead truck and said, is that Pesto in your egg? The other tactical commander said it's fair. I guess it was a little bit of humor for us. Good stuff. Talk to you later bill.

Speaker 8:          00:46:44       How fucking cool is that? Huh? Somebody is talking over them. Falucia sweeping out the houses or whatever the hell you do. You know to what? A couple of my jokes. That was one of the coolest emails. I have a god and a, actually you have the name of the guy who sent me that. So when you, when you get back safe, I'm going to hook you up at a show. All the rest of you constant listening to this. Don't start sending me emails pretending that you're over there just so I can give you a couple of free tickets next time I placed slap ease and fucking Omaha, Nebraska. I right. That's bad Karma. That's bad fucking Karma. All right. All right. Here's my fucking rant for the week or eight people and I'm going to try to remain calm throughout this without losing my shit cause I think it's a very important thing that a lot of people are dealing with.

Speaker 8:          00:47:34       And I'd much rather try to get the information out and they may in a nice calm way. That way my message will be heard and I won't and I won't seem like a psycho. All right. Forget about the fact that I talked to myself for half an hour if you become these fucking things. Okay. So last week I was flying to New York to do the HBO show, a down and dirty with Jim Norton. I was very excited to do it. Anytime he gets to do HBO is a comedian is a big thing, a big, big thing. You know, I was psyched to see Jim. Jim's the first guy from my graduating class of Comedians to get a high profile standup Gig like that. So it was really cool. You know, I was anticipating seeing him in the show, Yada Yada, Yada. All that stuff. Okay. I get a first class round trip ticket from fucking lax.

Speaker 8:          00:48:31       Nope, don't swear. Don't swear bill. Keep it nice. I get a first round FirstClass roundtrip ticket. Okay. Counting to 10 here from lax to new work. Okay. I don't know if you guys are flown first class. I do it every once in a while when I get get a fucking TV show. I don't do it on a regular basis because I did that for one month and I got an $8,000 credit card bill and I said, you know what? I don't think coaches that that. So now I got a free round trip, first class ticket. Did I make that point yet? I think I did. So before I get on the plane, I haven't eaten, but I'm thinking that doesn't matter. I have a first class round, fifth ticket. I am going to be wined and dined from lax all the way to Newark, New Jersey. I'm going to have fucking whine and dine. That's what I'm going to have. Probably get a foot massage, you know, little hot towel. Maybe a quick little, how you doing, you know, first class. And we sit there and look down on the people as they're getting into the back of the plane. I can like, I'm running some big successful business, you know, so I get on the plane, I'm starving. Oh boy. Oh boy. I'm going to get something to eat.

Speaker 8:          00:49:51       Get on. They hand me the menu. Okay. And one is I got two choices. I can either get an omelet with potatoes, some fruit, I think a muffin and some orange juice or cereal. And I'm like, wow, that's sort of a limited menu. Who the fuck would get cereal? I'm going with the Omelet. Who the fuck wouldn't get a Vegan? All right, you got me. But most, you know, generally speaking, everybody's going to get the x. So I go and I read the final line of the menu and in it says, please accept our apologies if your selection is not available. And I was like, what the fuck is about to happen here? What do you mean please accept our apologies if your selection is not available. This is first fucking class. All right. That shit happens back in coach. When you sit in row 38 F, you know, then they run out of eggs.

Speaker 8:          00:50:59       They run out of the eggs in the back where they got people's fucking stacked up like cordwood. You know, is that even a word? A quarter. Quarter Wood? Isn't it an amount of wood? I don't fucking know. That's a question for you guys. What does it, is that a quarter would I cleared land one day and I heard that expression and I just used it and I know what the fuck it is. They got people jam packed in the back of the Goddamn airplane. That's where you run on x. You don't run out of fucking eggs and first class. See, I'm flipping out. Take it down bill. Make sure your message is heard. Okay. So I'm sitting there, I started the front of first class, there's like five rows, I'm in row four. I'm doing the math and they're going through and you know what? Nobody's picking the Siri of course, the nok. Why would you pick cereal when you can get an Omelet? All right.

Speaker 8:          00:51:50       Needless to say, they get to my route and they say, what would you like Mr. Byrd? And I said, I would like the Omelet, sir. And they say, Ooh, I'm sorry. Um, we're out the eggs. And I go, what do you mean you're out of eggs? And yeah, everybody ordered eggs in the gay were added eggs. And I go, what do you have left knowing full well what they had left. And he goes, uh, we have cereal and a Bagel. And I looked at the guy and I said, dude, I paid for a first class ticket, which I didn't. Of course I didn't got for free, but I don't give a fuck or I don't want to make a point here. I got to go for big air. I said, I paid for first class ticket, I'm not eating cereal. And the guy was like, I know, I know.

Speaker 8:          00:52:40       Um, I know you're right. We don't think it's right, but this is just how they do it. And I'm like, what do you mean this is how you do it? I go, there's like 12 people here at first class. How do you run out of eggs? This is first class. I'm not eating cereal. And the guy goes well on, on odd flights. We start at the front of first class and unevens we started the back row of first class and it's like, dude, it's fucking first class. It shouldn't be a problem. I want fucking eggs. And he's like, wait, I didn't say fuck. And I go, I want eggs. And he's like, well, all we have is cereal. I'm sorry sir. And I just said, you know what? I don't want anything. Right. Just started pounding. I'm sitting there fuming stomach is growling. I got a six hour flight, I'm starving to death and the widest Goddamn airplane seat I've ever sat in my life. So like two minutes goes by and I swear to God the fucking flight attendant comes back and he goes, um, I just talked to the pilot, the captain of the airplane and he said he already ate so you can have his eggs. And I was like, why? He goes to the pilot said you can have is eggs. I'm like, I don't want his fucking eggs.

Speaker 8:          00:53:57       I don't want this fucking eggs. I want my ex. This is first class. It should be enough fucking eggs for me. Alright. And the God, the peace of pilot, he should get eggs, fucking pancakes and waffles. Whatever the fuck he wants. I don't want that. I don't want my pilot upfront fucking stop, you know, passing out all light headed and shit cause he didn't get any fucking eggs.

Speaker 8:          00:54:22       It was ridiculous man. I mean how much fucking money do you have to mix? This is American Airlines, by the way. This is American Airlines. This is how fucking tight they are. And they're trying to blame it on these fucking fuel prices. Oh by the way, I ended up taking the eggs cause that was so god damn hungry. And then I felt bad. I'm sitting there eating and feeling guilty like I meet the pilot's eggs and then the other side I'm feeling like a sell out cause I'm thinking like maybe they're thinking they're going to give me these eggs and I'm not going to fucking fire off a damn letter on their website, which I did. It's fucking unreal. American Airlines are the biggest fucking cunt of an airplane in an airline. Do you remember what I remixed their song a few weeks ago. Remember that

Speaker 8:          00:55:10       for those of you who didn't, that was my new thing. Cause I'm sick of these God damn corporations and they're fucking, they're happy jingles as this screwing you over every single day. So I remix this song. They didn't win a little something like that kid, Eh, fuck it. Yes. I did that as a joke two weeks ago and I swear to God, I've never been more right in my life. Or the next day I get off the Goddamn plane bitch. Then I find out they're going to charge $15 for your first carry on. Now you first started the first bag that you've check and they keep blaming it on fuel prices. How the price fuel keeps going up. And I'm telling you right now as a passenger, if you believe that shit, I don't know what to tell you. They make money off of misery. Okay? Nine 11 they made money. Okay? I'm sure is their expenses go up 20% whatever. But you know, they don't just raise a 20 they raise a 25 and that's the same thing with this fucking fueled.

Speaker 8:          00:56:19       This is my question. All right, who's going to start it? Okay. I'm not starting it, but I swear to God, if anybody out there starts at, I'm going to follow. Okay. There has to be some sort of fucking push back because I don't know what's going on with these fucking, these got the incorporations they used to be, the customer's always right and somehow in my lifetime it's going to, you know, fuck you and your mother customer. That's the vibe. You know when I went to fly back my round trip, first class ticket, I show up, my fucking flight is canceled. And rather than flying first class nonstop from Newark to lax, I was now flying coach to Dallas and then FirstClass from Dallas to lax and, and there was no voucher. They're like, yeah, we're not offering anything. It's like six months ago I would've got a blow job if you fucked me this bed. And she's just like, Nah, Nah. Then they're not offering anything. You got to call the one 800 number and then I call the one 800 number. They're like, no, you have to talk to the person that's dead. I'm like, can't I just talked to the person at the desk, the hung up cause I said, so then I had to call back and in the end of it all they gave me was 150 bucks, which buy like one third of a coach ticket. But once again, I won't get any fucking eggs.

Speaker 8:          00:57:43       So all I'm asking is who's going to start it? Who's going to start the fucking, you know, what we need? We need like a fucking, uh, what's Charles Bronson's name and those death wish movies, Paul Kurzy. We need a fucking the airline version of that. Jesus Christ. I mean, who the fuck wants to pay $15 for their first bag that they check? Everybody knows that's bullshit. Nobody wants to do it, but we're all going to do it because we're all just by ourselves twisting in the wind, okay? But if we all showed up the first day, June 15th, or that promotion, whenever the fuck it is and you show up at the airport with angry faces and tortures, like we're going to go try and get Frankenstein guarantee and none of us has to pay 15 bucks. Okay? I'm not trying to incite a riot here. I'm just saying somebody start passing out the two by fours.

Speaker 8:          00:58:33       I'm down with it, all right? I'm not going to lead it because I procrastinate and everybody knows, you know, they always chop off the heads of the body falls. Okay? If I learned anything from the 1960s black, white male seem, if you fuck with the deal, you have a comfortable ride in your future. All right? But some good things do happen. So fuck, I'm so pissed right now. If fucking believe that the pilots eggs, actually the pilot, can you fucking believe that 30 years ago. But God damn stewardesses, they didn't. It was, first of all, they were all hot. That's the one thing. Okay. It was a goddamn glamorous job. All right? You had a one in 10 chance of hooking up with one of the hottest stewardesses. That's why people used to wear suits. You wanted to look through. It was like a nightclub.

Speaker 8:          00:59:23       Everyone was oozing. People were smoking. You were having a Goddamn party in the fucking sky. Here's the one for you. You know what? First class used to be, this is the greatest story I ever heard as far as the first class. This is what it used to be as compared to my fucking out of eggs. First Class experience. Pan Am Airlines. I'm dating myself here. All right. Pan Am when used to fly to uh, I think it was John F. Kennedy airport. I read about this shit on the Internet, right? So it's gotta be true. Um, first of all, the metlife building that's right above grand central station used to be the Pan Am building. So when you use the fly first class to JFK airport, you got off first class and you, you didn't go to a fucking town car and sit and God damn traffic on the lie or wherever the fuck you go through the midtown tunnel and take an hour and a half, which ruins the first class experience.

Speaker 8:          01:00:15       You got off the fucking plane at JFK airport. They put you on a helicopter, swear to God. They put you on a helicopter and they flew you to the top of the Pan Am building. You got off drinks. We're waiting probably more broad with those scarves tied around their necks like fucking Dick Cavett you get another blow job. Then you took the fucking elevator down to the first floor, jumped in a cab, you went to your hotel pre herpes. Pre-Aids here's some penicillin. Have a good fucking time. All right. That was first class back then. Then, uh, something happened where the, the wind, something happened with a wind, tipped over a helicopter and the blades went flying down to the street and shot somebody in half. Okay. But that's beside the point. I really did happen by the way. I forget who had shopped and half, but he was a son of somebody.

Speaker 8:          01:01:06       Somebody's obscurely famous, you know, like the guy who invented the bookmark or something. All Jesus Christ. Some fucking winded after that story. Um, which brings me to my, uh, president of advice that somebody gave me this week. Um, know, taking naps can really help me out when I get too negative and agitated. But this can be hard for you since you fly so much. Running and lifting weights also helps me out too. Well, thank you for that advice. Uh, I don't know. I think the running and lifting weights would help me out as you can tell with my rage issues. But, uh, taking naps, I can't do it. Like, uh, I dunno. My brain wakes me up. I don't know how to shut it off. So if anybody out there knows how I can shut this fucking thing off. All right, I'm really worked up here.

Speaker 8:          01:02:00       All right, here's a, here's some advice. Somebody, this is how, this is a question I get like every week people will always give me this from they 50 people say I'm funny. How do I become a comedian? Um, I must get asked this like 10 times a week. This is what you do. Fight five minutes of Shit that you think is funny. Sign up for an open mic when they call your name. Go up there. Hang on for dear life. Spit out as much of it as you can remember tape you said go home, listen to it. Keep the jokes that work. Got To get rid of the ones that didn't and then write some more jokes to take place. Take the place of the ones that didn't work and then you sign up for another open mic. You repeat the process and you just keep doing that. And then eventually you build, enact. And next thing you know, you're a comedian flying first class to a dream TV gig without any fucking eggs. I don't know you get x, but we're going to give you the guilt trip. You can have the pilots egg. He'll just sit up there and be hungry. What the fuck?

Speaker 7:          01:02:59       Okay,

Speaker 8:          01:02:59       it's podcasts I'm sensing is getting a little long here. Let me get onto the questions and I'll get out of here and you guys can get on with your memorial days. Okay. Question number one. You've always seen dimension sports in your rack. That was wondering if you were involved in any fantasy sports leagues. No, I am not fantasy sports leagues have for Geeks. I fucking, I can't stand them. They have ruined sports. Talk in a bar. People aren't, aren't like affiliated with fucking teams anymore. You Bring, oh my God. You see liking salon. Really? Really? What else do you have on your fantasy team? Huh? A girlfriend. Somebody who satisfies you sexually. What else do you have a dream job? We not fucking walled in by a cubicle. No, I don't play fantasy sports leaks. Uh, actually, you know what? I don't really know much about them.

Speaker 8:          01:03:49       I find that sports takes, they take, it takes up too much of my time anyways, so I don't watch pregame. I'm not in fantasy sports leagues. I don't watch post games. I don't listen to any of those fucking ranting raving lunatics that ESPN has now. Anybody on ESPN for some reason listens to these things. Why is every show become two people screaming at each other? And why do you guys hype things up to such a ridiculous fucking level that it never, you know what I mean? Like patriots was six and out. They're like, it just the greatest team ever.

Speaker 7:          01:04:25       Okay.

Speaker 8:          01:04:25       Yeah, yeah, yeah. I guess they are. I mean, let's completely ignore the fact that the cults were 13 and eight. Oh two years earlier. Let's, let's declare them the Glitz. Ask if they're the greatest team ever when there's still fucking 20 games left in the season. You dumb cunts. All right. Um, number two, uh, Bill, which end of your comedy crowds spectrum do you prefer to put up with the Douche bag frat guys who drank so much? They decided to try and heckle you after your show while you're signing cds? Oh yeah. I know who this is. That happened me in Chicago. Okay. Um, or the older men who came to the show with their wives that are afraid to laugh at your jokes because they want to get laid that night. Um,

Speaker 7:          01:05:10       okay.

Speaker 8:          01:05:11       I definitely prefer the, the, the older guys who don't laugh cause they want to get laid by their wife that night. Um, because if I pick up on it, it usually ends up being a, a much funny situation cause I can see, I can make the woman's somehow feel guilty for doing what she's doing. I guess. I Dunno, riff on it. That's more fun. But as far and the heckling you after the show, cause he didn't have the balls to do it during the show. It's just sad and it always makes me feel like that person actually wanted to be a comedian. They just never had the balls to do it. And I'm watching the death of a dream. Um Wow. That was dark. Okay. Question number three is a he slash she a bad comedian. If they try to talk to the audience. I have noticed in the last few years the worst comics, so the ones that base their comedy comedy on, hi, where are you from so they can goof on the audience.

Speaker 8:          01:06:06       Uh, wait a minute. Fucking seem ws so they can goof on. The audience are the worst comic smelt. That wasn't me. That was him. He wrote a bad sentence there. Even the last time I saw you in southern California, the Improv, the two people before you kept trying to find ways to make fun of the people in the audience as a comic. Do you think that this is a sign that they are a bad comic? I would think it would turn everyone else off because they are too worried about being talked to. Next one time I was watching a taping of Frazier in La and 90% of the people got up because the comic in the stands with us kept ripping on everyone. Right? First of all, let's fucking hilarious. The guy doing the audience warmup was in between takes of Frazier was just going, what are you guys, a bunch of fucking Douche bags and 90% of the crowd left.

Speaker 8:          01:06:57       Um, I don't want to be a country here, but uh, I dunno about 90% been like, just like 30%. I would think if 90% of the studio audience walked out at some point somebody with a clipboard and a headset would have walked over to the comic and when would have been like, hey dude, why don't you fucking tone it down a little bit? Okay. Kelsey Grammer's getting a little pissed because 90% of the crowd has left. Can you stop calling calling them cunts? You know, I know what you're saying though. What do I think as far as people working with the, on the audience? I definitely know what you mean. There's definitely guys who don't have enough jokes. So then they go, hey, where are you from? What do you do? What would that job sucks. Um, but then there's other guys I see fuck with the crowd and they're brilliant at it.

Speaker 8:          01:07:44       I would just basically say, if you don't have any material and you suck at playing to the crowd, then yeah, you suck at it, then you suck as a comic. Absolutely. But if you're good at it and that's your thing, I don't think there's anything wrong with it. Jesus Christ. I answered that like Hillary Clinton. Well, I think it could be a good thing and a bad thing now, whenever it just fucking elect me. All right. Has she given up yet? Jesus Christ, she's like one of the fucking, she just won't tap out. She's like one of the Gracies. They've got like a fucking arm bend, Ben Dolly back. I still think I'm doing good. I think I'm going to win.

Speaker 8:          01:08:25       I'll take some. That's the one thing I've learned about this election. I have learned that I completely do not give a shit about race. I really don't. Black, white, Puerto Rican. I don't give a fuck. If you make sense, I will vote for you. Right. So my hatred of women, whooo. It's fucking unreal. I don't hate women. It's just that fucking voice. Good Lord. And you know, they, they got to bring it down. The problem is, is women, they raise their voice up because they try to do what the guys do. Guys, when they raised their voice, it has a commanding sound to it. Women, when they raise their voice up, they sound like a fucking Segal. So she needs to do is deliver her speeches and a middle range, maybe even drop it down to a whisper a little bit. And I swear to God, that's where the female voice has power, medium voice to a whisper. It can make your dick hard. You know, you fix hard. I Dunno. You're not thinking clearly you're going to fucking vote for, but when you're, when you're fucking way up there, people are not going to hear your message.

Speaker 8:          01:09:39       I talk more shit on this fucking thing. All right, the last question. Here we go, then I'm gonna be Outta here. Question number four. Bill, you spoke about us, uh, going home with you. You know, hearing you, what all, this is last week's podcast. When I parked my car in the garage and all that. Yeah, we heard you walk up the steps, close the garage door, which made me think, uh, what's your take on stockers, celebrity stockers, if you will? Uh, she like insulting me, their celebrity starkers if you will, celebrity in quotes. It's God knows, I love the ATS doesn't count as being a celebrity, which it doesn't. You're right. Okay. Um, celebrity stalkers if you will. Have you ever had one? If you did, would you be flattered or freak the fuck out? Uh, okay. Um, uh, no. Yeah, obviously who the fuck wants to be stopped?

Speaker 8:          01:10:30       You know what I mean? I don't really, I mean, I wouldn't want to be stalked by the hottest chick on the planet. That's how frightening stockers are. Because no matter how good looking the a, they have that crazed, um, yeah, I always think of that, that, that fatal attraction then I'm not going to be ignored. Michael, whatever his fucking character's name was right then you know what he should done. Whenever, whenever I see that movie fatal attraction, she's like, I'm not going to be ignored. And she sort of leans her head down a little bit. I always wanted him to just hit her with like a fucking, just a right cross from a fucked up angle. Like, uh, like Roy Jones member used to throw the punches from those weird angles. Maybe do like that little rooster hop and just fucking crack. You know, there, there's your attention.

Speaker 8:          01:11:16       Oh, look at me. I'm like dice clay the end of this fucking thing. Why am I gonna get this? This is just brutal. Why? Why am I lashing out of women here in the end of this? This is, this is dumb. Okay. Uh, just cause I'm not going to vote for Hillary Clinton doesn't mean I hate all women. I just hate the sound of the female voice in the high register. I think that that's what it is. Anyways, let me finish answering this question and then I'll get the fuck outta here. Um, yeah, that is, but that is my thing. Yet stockers freaked me the fuck out. Um, I don't mind people who are really, you know, come out to a show. I've had a couple people come onto to show it may tee shirts and that kind of thing. And they act a little zany. That doesn't bug me, but you know, later on that night I don't, you know, rolled over in bed and all of a sudden they're hovering outside my hotel window. Yeah, that would obviously freak me out. Um, yeah, I don't think anybody finds that flattering can. Okay. I'm taking a very serious tone now all of a sudden and I'm starting to get scared. Okay. You happy? That's what your question did to me.

Speaker 8:          01:12:18       I'm going to go put on my chin up bar. Okay. That's what I'm doing. And I'm actually going to buy a piece of rope down at the hardware store. Then I'm going to hang from the fucking thing and a, I'm going to be able to fucking climb up that son of a bitch and I will you think and we'll bill if the fucking, I mean, what are you gonna get? Like six feet of rope? No, this is what you do. You do get that amount of rope, but you're fuck actually you get more cause you want to be able to tie it up, but you sit on the floor. Okay. Would you legs straight out l shape and then you pull yourself up just with the arms. And I'm telling you if you can fucking do that. My goal is by November two fucking glue 10 likes stance and put them on top of each other.

Speaker 8:          01:12:58       And that's how I'm going to end my shows. I need a hook people. Okay, I'm going to climb right up the fucking thing right out the roof. Get on a helicopter by one of those old Pan Am ones and fly the fuck out of the Gig. And that's how I'm going to end it every fucking time. I'm do a big dramatic way, right as I go to the ceiling of the funny bone. Alright, and that's it. There you go. That's the podcast for the week. Please. Uh, please keep sending me the questions. Please keep back in the or giving me advice or whatever. And uh, I will talk to you guys next week. Everybody have a great week. I'm a Caroline's this week on Thursday, Saturday and Sunday. Friday I'm flying back to La Cause I have to do a stand up on the spike TV awards show. Um, next weekend, the following weekend, there'll be at good night's comedy club in North Carolina.

Speaker 8:          01:13:48       Uh, later on that month, the 19th through the 21st, I'll be at the punchline and a Atlanta, Georgia, Atlanta, and uh, I dunno what the fuck I'm going to be after that, I just put up a of Miami, Florida date.
