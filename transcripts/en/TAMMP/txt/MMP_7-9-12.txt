Speaker 1:          00:01:39       I um, let, let's, let's, let's, let's bring it down a little bit. Let's bring the tone down a little bit. Let's just ease it on in, you know, you sitting there, right? Coming down from the sugar rush from that fucking Curley's shouldn't Eaton uh, they had bear claw, right? Well, what else did you have a what? Do you have the thing at the airport? What do they got there? The big fucking, uh, you know, we look like, it looks like a diabetic. Took a shit. What do they call a Cinnabon?

Speaker 1:          00:02:07       A lot of people don't know that. That's, that's where they, that's where they get their dough from. As a, when a real fat person takes a shit, they, that's when you, that's when you know you have to lose weight is when you just shit a Cinnabon and you didn't, you knew you didn't eat one. It's not like it went straight to your system. Okay. It's, that is just an amalgam of that is the waste of what you ate that day. You know, something. I is it my goal to lose every female on this podcast, any fee remote female listener. It's almost like this subconscious self self sabotage. Two minutes, 40 seconds into this fucking thing. And you know, I got to put that visual out there. You know, I probably lost not only all of the women, I lost some guys who were like in touch with their feelings. Anybody's a remotely a human

Speaker 3:          00:03:00       being. So now, now it's just a, now it's just us. It's just a sociopath's. Let's just let them slowly co, you know, file out of the room. I thought it was going to be something different. I did too. I like sweets. I don't shit set up month. Sorry. I said the f word. Um, my fucking dog, Cleo, I want your life, you know, what is your biggest decision? What room am I going to lay down and go down and fucking go to sleep? Sleeping. Is that what it is? You've got a fucking spider web on my, uh, uh, the remanence of a spider web. I can't figure out I'll all the spiders in my house like me or they don't like me, you know, cause I kind of let them be when it gets a little ridiculous, you know, the size of the spider webs.

Speaker 3:          00:03:50       Cause I figured that they're here for a reason. That must mean I have other bugs here and they're going to kill him. So like I look at them like they're my like insect police squad, you know, and I'm the rich guy is, isn't that what the uh, uh, what do you call them? The fucking policemen? ARF. Isn't that why they initially came about was to protect the rich people's stuff just in case everybody working farm was like, hey ya, how much does that vase worth? Their fucking, what's a rich guy's name? Hg fucking cunt face. They help that we had those names back then. Not The cunt face part, but they always had the initials. Right. You know, Hg Rockefeller, Jd Rockefeller, you know JP Morgan, JP, it ain't fair man. I don't care if with kitchen put my shooter got out. Right. And they all talk like Edward G. Robinson for some reason, 30 years before even fucking was famous.

Speaker 3:          00:04:49       C'Mon pill, get your shit together. Um, I have a sugar rush right now. I had fucking spaghetti again. Bet At four times his fucking week. That's what happens when all your recipes that you got from your parents or for like 10 people, you know, and it's just you and your God damn dog. Whatever you make and you know, you make sketti you're going to eat and that for fucking two weeks, I got fucking octopus coming out my fucking nose here. Um, that was the soprano's version of a Tony Montana case. You were wondering that knee is out of town again this week. You know, I think she's slowly breaking up with me via vacations, you know, just sort of easing me into what it's going to be like when she's not here. And I got to tell you I'm doing fine. You know, I can't fucking do the laundry. I can't make spaghetti 10 times in a week. I don't need you.

Speaker 3:          00:05:44       Yeah. Jesus. What'd you do with your weekend bill? Well, I had too much to drink Friday night and I'm back on the wagon, you know, back on the fucking wagon. I don't think this is an old Jimmy, that old joke where they say, uh, I'm not an alcoholic. I just drink like one a that, that's me. You know what I mean? I'm one of those guys, if I'm going to have a pizza, I'm going to eat the whole fucking thing. All right, let's save some for later and maybe having it for breakfast and then talk about sports on ESPN. All right. And they have a show called cold pizza with skip Bayless was, uh, always losing his shit about something. Do you guys buy, do you guys buy that guy? Do by his outrage? Um, you know what I mean? I think his outrage is about as believable is ice cubes, anger.

Speaker 3:          00:06:41       Ice Cube has had the exact same scowl on his face from Nwa all the way to these cores like commercials. It is the exact, he is the exact same look on his face when he was talking about the man as he does when beer bottles take over his studio. You know, maybe he's just straight across the board. Angry. God knows I can relate to that, but there's certain people after a while you gotta be like, Dude, you got to have another emotion in there, don't you skip Bayless is another guy. I don't give a fuck if you said, hey, you need air to breathe. He would somehow argue the other side, put his eyebrows up near his fucking game show host hair that he has. You know, is that his hair? It's gotta be his hair. Either that or he went to like, he got a, do they make weaves for white guys?

Speaker 3:          00:07:35       You know, if they made weaves a white guys, everybody would want skip Bayless is here. I get it. If it came in some sort of a, some sort of red, I'd get one. I get one in a second. I'd be hot at some of the, you know, that's why I never get a fucking toupee, you know, just sitting there with your full head of fucking here, just slapped on there like a shingle scalps sweating underneath it. You know, what the fuck am I do with, you know, and then one at night I come home and I take it off and I just look at me, just look at the landing strip on top of my head, right where, where, you know, the rest of my face got sun and then this, I got this blind. You know what I would, I would look like the globe, you know, on top of my head would be like the North Pole, you know, my chest would be the south pole and then my face would be the tropics. And that basically it, I mean that's basically the climates, you know, my nose would be some sort of mountain range coming down from fucking Alaska. Why do you guys listen to this stupid podcasts? Um, anyway, so, oh, I didn't tell you this. I got to fucking, I gotta I gotta I bought one of those, those giant eggs

Speaker 1:          00:08:56       to fucking Bobby Q. I bought one the ugliest fucking sin, but they are the shit. This is not an advertising. This is a Freebie. Alright. People over at the big green egg in case you sell half of one, um, I love the goddamn thing. It looks like an unripe avocado. It's one of the ugliest things you've ever seen in your life. Okay. But they got a couple of gaskets. They got a seal here. It's a seal here and you run it up the alley. Um, oh, I made some burgers and dogs. That's what I did first. And then there was this barbecue place that was going out of business or relocating. I Dunno what was happening, but all I know was all their shit was, was half off. So I went down there and I got the thing for fucking ribs, right? Not Baby Becky to the fucking, the good ones, you know, you just lay the fuck are right over there. Okay. Doing ribs isn't even that hard. They'll just fucking Douche you see on, uh, on, on the food channel, talking about all the shit that they do when they sit sitting there with their little fucking based or hey, well what do you do? You slather it with some shit that this tastes good. You stick it in the fucking thing

Speaker 1:          00:10:07       and then you come back four hours later and he'd go, oh, would you look at debt? Oh, which you look at debt falling right off the boat, right? And then they eat it and then they always tell you it's good. Well, of course you're going to say that it's your fucking cooking show.

Speaker 1:          00:10:20       Have you ever seen on a cooking show? A guy took a bite and was like, ah, God damn it, I overcooked it, dried that shit out. Well, you know, you win some, you lose some, come on back next week folks, maybe I won't cook the shit out of this salmon. They never say that. They always eat you. You know, it's like, and they always eat it too when they're like running out of time. So before they, they, he'd take half a bite and they go, ah, ah, ah, I wish you could take, you didn't even fucking show it. You know what that's like? That's in, in uh, in the acting profession. I learned this one, I did glee. That's called playing the end of the scene.

Speaker 2:          00:10:57       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:10:57       You know what I mean? Like if you, you know, if you read like you, you're all seen, you know, you have to audition for, right? And it's basically your, your character walks into a rental car place. She's supposed to have a fucking rental car. They don't have it. And then you flip out and you yell, right? And in the end there's a big fucking yelling bullshit, right? And the inexperienced actor comes in already fucking amped up. And it's like, why you already amped up. You'll walk in and expect in the fucking car to be there. You wouldn't already be mad. You're playing the end of the scene. That's what those cons do on the food network, because they're running out of time. Oh fucking Susie mother and hips there, whatever the fuck her name is, who I said I'd like to bang her before she highlighted her hair and did the whole fucking j Lo thing was she toned down her fucking Brunette Ish.

Speaker 1:          00:11:42       Look on her face. You know what I mean? Uh, what's her name? Rachel Ray. Rachel Ray did the exact same make over that fucking j. Lo did both of were uh, were, were Brunette Brown eyes, big bushy fucking eyebrows. They did the same goddamn thing. They fucking, they thin that shit out. They throw with a little, throw a little sun in their hair. All right? Then all of a sudden, Oh wow, look, you jumped off the page. You know, you don't want to do an over correction though. You don't want to over correct Brunette. If you over correct Brunette, you go right past blonde and into red head and then that's a slippery slope into albino and you're not getting, no one's going to see your fucking movie or watch you make some French dip. All right. So I'm not making fun of the profession that, that's a very delicate process to take someone who has brown too much brown, you know, and they got to lighten them up and the eyebrow hair area. But what I always think because I'm a fucking pervert is it's like all right.

Speaker 2:          00:12:44       Yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:12:45       you fucking, you know, you dialed in the sun up top. What happened down bottom. You know what I mean? Cause if your eyebrows and that fucking bushy, what in God's name is going down, they're going on down there and you and the slacks area. Did you get that highlight? Is that going to match? You know, am I going to see who you really are when you're draws? Hit the floor sweetheart.

Speaker 3:          00:13:10       Oh, Jesus Christ. Um, well that was a fun first fucking 15 minutes, wasn't it? How? Oh Hey, guess who's advertising this? This, this week? Guess who's back? It's our old friends at pro flowers. Remember them way back on Mother's Day? Mema them I on Valentine's Day. Well now they're hitting us up every month. They want you to buy flowers every month. And I know what you're thinking. What the fuck would I do that for? I don't know, but it's up to me is the pitch man that I have to some, they have to somehow come up with an angle. I got to come up with an angle here. This is what you gotta do. Okay. And I actually do this. Okay. So this is coming from my heart, not from the wallet. All right. This isn't the magic bullet here. This is coming straight up. All right? Didn't make a right turn down on my ass, right in my wallet. It didn't. Okay. Um, every once in a while.

Speaker 2:          00:14:09       Okay.

Speaker 3:          00:14:10       Every once in awhile I'll wait. Cleo, shifting, shifting Ed, she stretching and then that's it. She didn't get up. Um, you look like a little pig. You know that little wild boar, Cleo,

Speaker 1:          00:14:26       no size on you. Do you do squats when I'm not looking? Is that what you're so tired from all the time? Anyways, portfolio is everybody. It's July 4th. You could've given some to Uncle Sam last week, but it's too late for that now. Uh, is that the original goatee by the way? Uncle Sam. Uncle Sam looks like an old retired like NBA player from the 70s, but somehow he's white. By then,

Speaker 3:          00:14:53       by then Whitey was, was getting pushed out of the League, wasn't he? Um, all right, let's get back to the advertising here. Uh, proflowers. Proflowers it's July, it's July. You know what? This is what you got it. You were in a relationship every once in a while, just out of nowhere. You've got to give him some flowers, you know? Okay. You know, is it ever a wrong time to give your mother some flowers? Are you going to go visit them? Do you have a mother in law who just looks at you? Like, why did you marry my daughter? You know,

Speaker 3:          00:15:22       give her some flowers. Maybe she'll lighten up. Either way. If you get a big enough arrangement, you have to look at his stupid face across the team. Uh, the table when you sit down to eat. You know, if you don't like somebody, what better way to block this stupid face than to go out and get a bunch ofFlowers@proflowers.com. Just click on the microphone in the upper right hand corner. You'd type in the Password Berbee you U R and they'll get the vase, they'll stick him in the water and they'll send it to that person. Love them or not send them flowers. And that's the end. And the dismount. Oh, speaking and the dismount. You know, I was telling you that I was starting to put on weight again. Oh, Billy fat again. You know, Billy McPhatter again. Um, and I decided that I was going to halt that and I was going to turn this bus around and tried to get myself back in shape. And uh, I've been doing all, all bodyweight stuff, climbing the rope. I'm doing the pull up some during the day. I'm doing, uh, what else you got there? Whatever. I don't do chin ups though.

Speaker 4:          00:16:35       Yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:16:35       Chin ups or are for girls. Pull ups are for men. All right. In fact, I remember when, when Demi Moore played that chick who got her head buzz down Gi Jane, right? She wasn't doing shit up. She was doing pull ups cause she was a marine. Right. I think that wasn't the message of that movie. What was the message of that movie? Other than men are horrific. What is the guy version of that movie? Like, like hot dog. And when those, those tits and ass movies they used to make when you first got cable, but ski bunnies in the same premise and now they're on the beach and they'd always be chicks like just taking their tops off. Like that happens, you know, maybe it happens on the French Riviera, I dunno. But then they got hairy armpits. This is always something to balance it out. People, it's the ying and the Yang, you know? Um, I just completely forgot what I was talking about. I was talking about pullups. That's right. So, so I don't know if you guys, Melissa, how long have you listened to podcasts? I F I fucked up my abdomen on the right side. Uh, about

Speaker 1:          00:17:50       five years ago, I was at a Pittsburgh pirates game. I was one of the field and I was there and I was drunk as always, alcohol, always playing a role. And I was drunk. I was drunk, Bill. Um, and I was with Paul Versey who said,

Speaker 5:          00:18:05       yeah, I fucking called. Yeah, look at the bridge. I said, it ice when they make this ballpark. I said, you know what they're gonna do. They're gonna have it where you could see the bridge from the, from, from home plate. Looking right out there it is. I call it, you're not taking this one away from me. You're not taking, I called it. Oh, look at the bridge. Um, by the lightweight, I love when you

Speaker 1:          00:18:34       guys send me tweets or twitters or whatever the fuck you call up when, uh, whenever Robinson can know does something and you make fun of mercy. That always makes me laugh. Like Quinoa had a double Versie called it.

Speaker 5:          00:18:46       He called, he called it, I'll Paul Versey. Do you want to be the guy who calls it? Well, all you need is my dude. I called it system number one fucking call everything. Think about it. If you call everything, eventually something that you said will happen, Dan, what you do is you yell about it, you continue to yell about it hopefully until everybody forgets everything else that you called. That did not happen.

Speaker 4:          00:19:15       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:19:16       You know it is at this point, the fact that virgin, he still talks about his call, that Robinson Cano was going to be a hall of fame. He watched him like fucking three weeks and said this guy's going to be a hall of famer evidently. Okay. Which is absolutely asinine. Okay. Unless you like Ted Williams, unless you're really a guy in baseball, you can, you can look at those things. All right. Versus one of those guys. He wants to be the guy who said it first. So he just says shit first. You know, like if he was on the prices right, there's no way he would pass the first showcase. He wouldn't, he would bid on it cause he wouldn't want that other person to bid before he did. That's what he would do. Did that make any sense? I don't give a shit.

Speaker 4:          00:19:55       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:19:58       So anyways, I've been working out this, what the fuck I'm trying to talk about. So this is how I fucked up my app abdomen. All right. I was um, I was at the, what, $10 with this other comic Doug's in. Yay. I was with Paul Versey

Speaker 5:          00:20:11       don't, I don't what I said.

Speaker 1:          00:20:14       Um, and myself and I think Doug's brother, right? We were all having a good time drinking some beers, right? We're all talking shit is old guys do. And next thing you know, I'm trying to show them that I can go into the pike position. Hammered. All right? So I put my fucking hand on one sheet and then on what another seat, lift myself up and then I bring my legs straight out in front of me like I had been doing, but I'm old. I didn't stretch. I don't know what happened. Right? And then later on the night, I remember being drunk. It's somebody, we were skipping rope on a sidewalk and it had like a 45 degree fucking angle across from this place where a bunch of drunks were getting food. I feel the life of me. I don't know where we got the fucking jump rope. I don't know where we got it.

Speaker 1:          00:21:04       I think somebody there had it from the gym and then that's what it became. That's probably when it became cars. I actually fucking went into the pipe position so then they will, I could fucking skip rope. Typical guy. Shit. All right. And I know this bugs the ladies, but you know something. That's why there's air conditioning. Okay. That's why, because of that shit, because that's how we're geared. I can do this while I can do this, while I can do that fucking better. Right. And next thing you know, you got wall to wall carpeting. All right, so shut your face and make me a sandwich. Um, anyways, so the next morning I wake up and I don't, it feels, it felt like somebody took some sort of medieval, like if that Freddy Kruger glove dipped it in fire and then fucking raped right down the right side of me. So for years I've been babying it. Finally at one time I went and I got, I got a Roth I believe, which is a really deep fucking massage. It was really weird. It was a the only person I found, although I was kidding who the first person I found, I just clicked on that.

Speaker 2:          00:22:10       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:22:11       Um, I went to that, that person's place and I went there and ended up being a guy doing it and it was really fucking weird. It was just weird. I was like, we'd done yet not on it. We still got more. You got to do the other side, but I think that's all right. Um, did it help? I don't fucking know. So, you know what I finally just said, I finally said, um, I found is that, is that homophobia by the way? That I will only go to a girl to get a fucking massage unless I'm really hurt, you know, if I'm really fucking hurt and I'm just so fucking like time I jacked up my shoulder, I just don't give a shit and just like, just make the pain go away. Is that homophobic? You know,

Speaker 1:          00:22:52       I bet if a woman did, it was like, you know, I, I don't want, well, she would say, I only want a girl. All right, so I'm a little homophobic. Go fuck yourselves. I got issues. Um, so anyways, so I finally, I finally just said, you know what, why don't I just try pushing through the paint? When do I stop being such a fucking pussy? Just push through the pain. So you know, you know those, uh, those little wheels with the handles on them. I just started doing that. I do 10 reps a day. I wouldn't go too far in, in like a week. The whole pain's gone and gone away. She know me. I can't be like, oh, fuck it now. Now I feel good. Is that good enough for bill? No. Now I'm on youtube trying to learn how to do the human flag.

Speaker 1:          00:23:32       It fucking 44 years old. I'm literally going down the street to a stop sign doing my little, the little side things, trying to build up the strike for what? For what purpose bill? You know, you got your health, you, you, your core feels good again. Why are you going to go down there and just blow something else out? You're a fucking moron. You know, you're gonna be right back on a table getting massaged by a dude. Um, all right, whatever. It's what the fuck I do. So this weekend a knee has been away and uh, so anyway, I got this big green fucking egg thing and uh, I got the, the, the uh, Dee Dee, Dee Dee, Dee Dee Dee Dee, the table that came with it. And uh, that took like a fucking month by the way, to get that thing. You know, I got, I got the table where the egg sits in it cause I hate that shit when you fucking barbecue and they give you that little, those two little, it looks like those trays that you know, that you have like an airplane and you just set them down a both sides. And that's supposed to take your whole fucking, you know, all the meat. And then where do I hang the fucking spatula? I don't need that shit. All right. That guy, he's going to die in jail. I don't need that shit. Okay. Ain't happening to me. Hey, you stopped dealing in that shit. Um, you know something? I watched Goodfellas the other day and I think, uh,

Speaker 1:          00:24:53       I think what the fuck's his name now? I, I'm starting to like him the best in that movie. To Fuck's his name. Pauly Paul Sorvino. I love that. I love that fucking thing. When he told him not to deal drugs and he's telling him how that guy's gonna die in jail. Okay. Then it happened in me and stupid sweaty piece of shit and re hill, the fucking rat, by the way. I didn't get one when the real Henry Hill died. Why people like, they kind of confuse their love of that movie and kind of forgot that this guy ratted out all his friends, you know, if, I mean, if that movie's accurate, right? I mean, I know he ratted out his friends, but I don't know if that's the exact reason why I did. Was it because he was fucking dealing drugs? Was there a guy saying, don't do it. Am I going to keep asking questions? So anyways, I get this table for this fucking thing and uh, you know, it comes, comes here like a newborn baby. It's fucking naked, right? It's got new phone and it's not staying, just got nothing on it, right? So I gotta I gotta deal with all that bullshit. I've been doing that the whole fucking weekend and doing it the right way too. By the way.

Speaker 1:          00:26:06       I stand on top and the bottom. I know a lot of your weekend warriors. Yay. You're like, fuck that. I ain't doing that. Nobody looks under their door. What if any water gets on there prior to the fucking table? The whole thing's going to be underground and underwater. Well, go fuck yourself. I did the whole thing, two coats on Friday, on Saturday, and then today I did the fucking the varnish and uh, I gotta tell you, man, that's a bitch of a job. It's just tedious.

Speaker 2:          00:26:36       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:26:36       Fucking tedious. Especially if you do the underneath too. I'm sitting there laying on my back, like fucking funds a rally, you know,

Speaker 3:          00:26:44       just fucking lay in there. I've working on this shit. And, uh,

Speaker 3:          00:26:49       I got to tell you a lot of times I was going to tap out and just be like, you know what? I'm not going to do this the right way. I'm just going to do this stuff the fuck headway and I didn't and I was happy. I was proud of myself. And you know what? I'm going to show it to Nia and I'm telling you, I, if she fucking says, why did you pick the heck? Why did she do this? Right? I'm going to take what's left of that fucking stain and I'm going to dump it over. I would never do that.

Speaker 3:          00:27:16       You know what? I'll do it to myself and become the martyr and then we'll see what she has to say. So anyways, I got this fucking egg and I'm going to make ribs and all this shit is somehow still be able to do the human flag as I, as I'm going to fucking, I don't know what I'm going to do. I'm going to buy like a fucking bison off of Ebay and freeze that son of a bitch and cook it slow, Cook it for the rest of the summer and that's going to be it. I'm going to get fat, girls going to get fat, my dog's going to get fat and uh, I'm going to have a whole new hour of material and when a tub of Shit I am, that's how great that thing is. Um, all right, let's plow ahead with the podcast. Everybody, if you're new to the podcast and you would like to send me an email, if there's a topic you'd like me to discuss, go off on it for year.

Speaker 3:          00:28:02       Possibly. You want to give me shit? You're probably saying bill, where the fuck do I do that? You go to bill at the [inaudible] podcast.com. That's where you email me, bill at the capital m, capital m, capital P odcast.com. All right, that's it. And a, Oh, before I get into this shit, um, I'm going to be in Washington DC tomorrow night. Uh, not too. All right. Tuesday night at the DC Improv's celebrating their 30 years in the business by telling my Dick and shit jokes. And then this weekend I will be at Hampton Beach in New Hampshire. Hampton Beach Ballroom Casino. One of my favorite venues that I do. Uh, led Zeppelin played there. One of the few small venues that they played on their quick little tea party tour that they did before they just blew up. Um, and then I'll be at the Newport Yachting Center in Newport, Rhode Island. I know that sounds fancy, but I swear to God it's an air condition tent in a parking lot.

Speaker 3:          00:28:59       You know, when you walk out the tent, you can see a bunch of yachts, but I'm not on one. It sounds good though. All right. Okay. Here we go. First one, first one out of the gate. Validations. Son's mother is a nut job. This is coming from my nut job. That's an east coast dual. She's a fucking nutjob up. Um, all right, dear Billy. Boy did I just fuck this thing up? Come on, come on. I need life here. Here we go. All right, dear Billy. Boy, a couple months ago, I split up with my son's mother. Uh, we weren't married, so I basically packed my shit up and my son's stuff and moved out. We hadn't been getting, we hadn't been getting along for a while because she didn't help me out with our son and was texting all the time.

Speaker 3:          00:29:44       That's what she was doing. She was texting all the time as she's probably talking to the other guy. She's probably fucking, I'm sorry. Didn't mean to put that out there. Um, the night before I moved out, I received a text talking about treating her better than I did. I asked to see her phone and she wouldn't let me. So I moved out the next day and she spent the night with some dude that same night I moved out yet. Dude, let me tell you something right now. If your girl isn't paying attention to you and she's texting all the time, she's talking to the Dick that she's riding. Okay. So unless yours is vibrating, she ain't texted you. All right? No. Okay. Um, anyways, next night, the next night, this guy started living with her.

Speaker 3:          00:30:30       Jesus Christ. Yeah. So she had a full on relationship going on the side. Uh, so we were pretty much through but a couple of weeks later it was mother's Day and she told me what my son wanted me to get her. Uh, my son is two years old and doesn't really talk a whole lot. So she was telling me what she wanted. I told you to go fuck herself because I wasn't getting her shit. There you go. Good for you. Uh, she told me that she was still the mother of my child and I should get her something. Jesus Christ is this people who use that kind of guilt, who you actually use, like the children. The fuck is wrong with you. Anyways. Also, I had paid the rent right before I moved out and when I found out this guy was staring, staying there the night I moved out, I cancelled the rent check and also got my name off the lease.

Speaker 3:          00:31:19       Oh, there's a nice one too to the fucking jaw bone. Uh, I know I did the right thing. Please tell me that you agree that this chick is fucked up in the head too. Oh, and since I moved out, she sees our son one or two days a week tops. Uh, so to me, she's a shitty mother who didn't deserve it. Deserve a gift. Go Fuck yourself ps when he come into the Kansas City area. All right. Uh, well granted, I just heard your side of the story, but uh, yeah, sounds like the way the picture you're painting there, sir. Absolutely.

Speaker 3:          00:31:55       Look, the fact that the day you move out, she bangs another guy and then the other person moves in. I mean, I think he got it good. I think you got it. Good. That's a, that was nothing but victory in there as far as I see. You didn't marry or you didn't love her. You're knocked her up, you toughed it out. He tried to do the right thing. There was no love there to sustain it in the end. And in the end she was doing what she wanted to do. She was trying to find love somewhere else and she's probably a little relieved that you're gone. Um, I will tell you this self, the fact that you have a kid with her and she's going to be in your life for at least another 16 years until this kid's 18 years old so she could make your life really fucking miserable. Don't ask me how. I don't know. They find a way. It's what they do. So, uh,

Speaker 3:          00:32:42       you know that this one, you're right. If she gives you shit, just be like, listen, I move out and that night you bang another guy and the next day you know the guy moved in. Okay, I can do the math. Am I really supposed to sit here and believe that you didn't have a relationship going on while we were still together and then you want me to go out and buy you a a fucking Flowbee. Rarely is that what you're telling me? Well screaming into your content cause on that list, Jesus. Bill, come on. I'm surprise we're getting a divorce. All right, here's a new story. All right. Hey Bill, I know you have, you aren't a therapist but I think I just want to talk to anyone at this point. So here it goes. I've been married for just under four years to my wife who I dated for four years prior to marriage.

Speaker 3:          00:33:25       I love being married and have said that to anyone that asks. Since day one, we own a nice house together. We have three dogs, pit bulls, too. Good man. And both make a decent living. I share everything in my life with my wife. Uh, when something makes me happy, she knows when I'm upset about something. I tell her, uh, throughout the course of our relationship about once a year she would suddenly without warning say she she was unhappy and has been for months. Oh God. Here we go. Uh, she says she has discussions with their mom who loves me and is the sweetest woman alive and close friends about the things that make her unhappy by, I never hear a word about it until it boils over and she floors me with how unhappy she is. Oh, that's not fair.

Speaker 3:          00:34:12       All right. We tried to work it out though. Make changes. She would act like it was okay while it bottling it up again once, once the lid goes on. The bottle. There is no opening and again, each and every time she calls the unhappiness state of the Union meeting and to session. I've always been completely honest as saying that I'm very happy with her. I love our jokes and honesty and honestly enjoy spending time at Baba Baba Jesus Christ to get to the fucking point. All right, last Wednesday, here we go. We had a good night together. We went out for dinner and ice cream and laughed at about, ah, Ba, ba Ba ba. So I thought I'd come home the following night in general, great mood. She told me she had talked to her mom and a friend and that they recommend that she talked to me. I was confused, Eh, most shit about not being unhappy.

Speaker 2:          00:35:02       Okay.

Speaker 3:          00:35:02       Uh, anyways, I wanted anything to make her happy, but she told me she didn't think there was anything. It was very emotional as she finally mustered up the courage to say that we might need to get separated. I was floored and not in an almond asshole husband that sits around drinks beer and watches football with his buddy way. I love my wife. We have free. Okay Dude. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Uh, so the following day, after much reluctance, I get her to agree to try marriage counseling so we can work out our happiness. Do it. I'm not giving you shit that this is, you're pouring your heart out cause this shit just happen. I understand. But for the of the listeners, I got to fly through this. Uh, I get to agree with her. I get to, I get it. Okay. So the following day, it's like Lord of the rings here, after much reluctance I get her to agree to try marriage counseling so we can work out her unhappiness.

Speaker 3:          00:35:53       I was willing to do anything at this point. I immediately scheduled an appointment with the counselor and it was looking forward to having someone neutral for us to talk to. Later that night we were laying in bed and I asked her if there was someone else in her life. She said, no. Yeah Dude. Oh Jesus. Oh Jesus. Uh, Jesus, here we go. We just went over the waterfall folks or where we, you know, it is not all in this story. We were hearing the waterfall and we've just looked at the other person in the raft with a panicked look on her face for that split second before we tried to desperately. But futilely try and paddle the fucking thing over to the God goddamn coast. Okay, here we go. We're going over. I got a feeling we're going over. Um, she said no, there's no one else in my life. I asked her if she's ever been unfaithful and our relationship relationship and she adamantly said no again. Then she turned out the light and laid down to sleep five minutes later and she sat up and turn the light on. Oh fuck. She told me she just lied to me and said that she had messed around with someone a year into our marriage. And he writes in capital letters, what period? The period fuck period. I probed her to tell me what messing around was as got to at least be a blowjob.

Speaker 3:          00:37:13       Ha Ha, ah, fucking whore. Um, and after a minute of me guessing her silence told me that she went

Speaker 5:          00:37:22       down on a guy she works with. Swear to God. I hadn't read this. Oh, if I was [inaudible] right now, you heard me. You heard me

Speaker 3:          00:37:34       fucking creep. I was furious and hurt. Then furious again. She cried and cried and said she was sorry. We cried together. Dude, you're a bigger man than me. While I tried to wrap my head around how she could possibly have done that to me, I've had casual flirting with people over the years, but to act on something physically with someone other than your spouse's, completely disgusting. To me, the worst part is I love this woman more than anyone. She's been my og. Here we go again and he's going to be a best friend for the last eight years. She knows everything about me. I want to hate her and make her sleep at her parents' house until we divorced. But all I want to do is be near her again. Yeah, dude, that's because,

Speaker 3:          00:38:16       yeah, dude, she, she was in a hurry up offense. That's what happened here. So now your scamper and trying to figure out what the fuck is going on. And she, you know, she has the next three plays that she just called in the huddle. That's why this, this is why it sucks to be you right now. Um, one of my close friends tells me what I know is the right thing. He goes, let it go. Don't bother with cloud ceiling. What else has she done that you don't know about how he never trust her again? Bill's it possible for me to forgive my wife. Am I wasting my time?

Speaker 4:          00:38:46       Okay.

Speaker 3:          00:38:47       Um, also I find out who this guy is and I really wish I hadn't had to, of course, all I wanted to do was show up at the job, beat the shit out of him. Like Ed Norton, Pete's the blonde, pretty boy up and fight club. He writes, I wanted to destroy something beautiful. My other thought is since this guy also cheated on his girlfriend who was still with,

Speaker 4:          00:39:07       mmm.

Speaker 3:          00:39:09       My, he did it with my wife. I'd threatened to tell his girlfriend what he'd done but not actually do it. Yeah. You don't want to do that that way. He live in fear of coming home and her knowing everything because I told her or he would try to beat me to it, admit to it, hopefully ending his relationship and getting terminal cancer and aids, terminal cancer and aids. And you know what? You're still being a gentlemen. I still think that you're, you're handling this with class wishing terminal cancer and AIDS on this guy. Um, I know you don't give a shit. Of course I give a shit, but not occupying. Ah, but I've got to occupy my mind. So I thought I, I, I do it here. Yeah. Do, why would you think I don't give a shit? You know, I mean, I'm not a friend of yours, but you know what I mean. Give me a fucking break. This is horrific. Um, all right. Your first question bills it possible for me to forget my wife. Uh, eventually you're going to have to, uh, and

Speaker 1:          00:40:04       or you're going to go on a fucking tear and you're going to meet some really damaged fucking women and they're going to reinforce everything that you've now found out about your wife. See, can't do that. You're going to go on a fucking, uh, hate fuck pussy spree. That is, yeah. You don't want to do that. Um, he said, am I wasting my time? Yeah, dude, it's over. She's not happy. She's not good at communicating. Um, she puts a lid on it, you know, until it boils over. This is the deal, dude. You know what? I, this is going to kill you. All right, let's go with the positive. You don't have any kids with her. Okay? You can just walk away.

Speaker 1:          00:40:51       Okay. We had a prop and there was a, there's nothing we can do. So he didn't make it. Did you just fucking walk away? Just walk away. It's over. All right. Um, that's a good thing. All right. One thing. You've had a bunch of kids with this fucking, this person who for whatever reason, couldn't say that they will. I don't think that she wanted you to wanting to fucking marry you. I think she ignores her feelings. She's actually having a fucking breakthrough right now while stomping all over your fucking heart. All right, well I dunno. I Dunno. I Dunno. Fuck her. Give me a break, dude. You fucking, you loved her with your heart. You say a mother's a sweetheart. You got dogs. You like communicating dude. You know something your like the fucking guy. You're the guy. My girl wants me to be. Every fucking woman wants a guy like that. You know guy who actually wants to be married guy who actually comes home and communicates, you know a guy who gets along with the mom and all that type of shit. You're a family man. All right. Unfortunately, you know you met the wrong person, so forget that dude.

Speaker 3:          00:42:02       All right. Forget it. Forget it. Fuck that. Fuck that. It's over. Walk away.

Speaker 2:          00:42:09       Yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:42:09       Walk. Walk away, Dude. Gimme a fuck by. You know what you talking about there? You're talking about like the, the amount of fucking shit she asked to go through before she even learned how to just communicate or fucking emotions and the frustration of that's going to meet every once in a while she's gonna blow somebody at work. Are you wasting your time apps? A fuckin lutely. Okay. Apps a Fuckin lutely. And as far as like going there and trying to fuck over that other guy, that other guy is, he's already, you don't need to fuck him over. He's fucking himself over. He's living it. He's living a life of misery. That life is miserable to fuck around with the person that you with, with somebody else. That is a miserable life.

Speaker 1:          00:42:55       You know, I dunno. I think it's something that a lot of guys do, myself included back in the day in my twenties going into thirties trying to fuck them, you know, figure myself out. I lived that life, that whole fucking double. It's horrible. It's a fucking horrible thing. Then in the end I ended up alone and I heard a lot of people and I was a complete piece of shit. So, and believe me, dude, it was a miserable and ended up me with me on a fucking futon. So, um,

Speaker 2:          00:43:26       yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:43:26       yeah. Do you, you're, you know, don't become a piece of shit now. Don't judge other women like that. Just fuck it. You know? Yeah. Get out of it, get out of it and just know that it's going to be a fucking a, I dunno, it's going to be a hundred yards of pain that you never fucking dealt with in your life and you just got to go through it. And um,

Speaker 3:          00:43:52       I would say the next time you get with somebody, uh, make, you know you're going to get serious with somebody who make God damn sure that they know how to fucking communicate because that's a, that's a scary thing to get with a woman who doesn't, how to communicate because that's something that they're supposed to teach us how to do. You know, in a way they make you better because you're like, oh, I can just say, uh, no, I don't feel like doing that without fucking punched in the wall. You know, they do that set up, sell you down. If you get with some psycho and she can't settle you down. I mean, she's a, she's damaged goods. All right, here we go. Next one. It's just these things just keep getting deeper. Asexual, just from a plant or something. Dear billion, uh, this is a bit of change from the emails you usually get, but I hope you can help me out anyways.

Speaker 3:          00:44:38       I'm a 26 year old guy. Completely normal in every way except for one. I'm asexual. For your listeners who don't know what that means, it means I don't feel any sexual dot desires at all. I never have. Take a moment to wrap your head around that one. I think I'm going to need more than a moment. Dude. Let me ask you this. What do you do with all your free time? You know, how many fucking languages can you speak? You want to think about that? How much fucking shit you would get done if you weren't chasing it all the God damn time. All right. Uh, but believe it or not, I do have a girlfriend. Uh, we've been together for four years. So what do you do to get aroused? Think about like when it's over. I'm really being a Dick Right now. I'm sorry.

Speaker 3:          00:45:21       Um, and he goes in. Before that we were friends for about another five years. We both helped each other through some rough shit and eventually decided that we wanted it to be more than friends. She's the first girl I've ever known who made me wish I wasn't a sexual, she knew all about it when we started dating. So there were no surprises. In fact, she's been really cool. We joked about it a lot. And when we did have sex, which was once or twice a month, I did everything I could to make it good for his is like fascinating. So like what are you thinking of,

Speaker 2:          00:45:54       you know,

Speaker 3:          00:45:56       three more minutes and she should be happy. Row, row, row your boat gently down the street. Uh, but lately things have been different. It wasn't a sudden change, but something I just noticed recently, she doesn't joke around about sex as much as she used to. And we now have sex once every two or three months. Our emotional bond is still as strong as ever. In fact, just last week we were talking about marriage by, I have a feeling my gut that she might be fucking another guy. I know her well enough to know that having sex four times a year is nowhere near enough for her. The thing is, it wouldn't bother me if she was fucking someone else. I know she has needs that I can't fulfill. So I'd be willing to have a pinch hitter come in and get the job done for me. Jesus. Talk about a fucking 180 from the last story. Um,

Speaker 3:          00:46:44       I just, sorry, I had to pause and do the math and just make sure that I didn't say that the wrong number sometimes. Yeah, it was a total three 60. Now that was a one 80. Um, I just wanted, I just want to know about it. I've, I've wanted to ask her about it, but I'm worried about what will happen if I'm wrong. What should I do? I love this girl that get death and I never forgive myself if I fuck up a good thing we have together. A dude that's outside my totally outside my bounds. I don't know what to tell you. I would, I would start going to therapy alone first and then possibly bring her in. But, um, you know, that's a,

Speaker 2:          00:47:22       yeah,

Speaker 3:          00:47:22       I don't know. I don't know anything about, I don't know anything about being a sexual, um, so that, that would

Speaker 2:          00:47:30       be my advice. You know, if you want to fix that problem and that type of thing. But I dunno, I feel like I've let you down, dude. I'm sorry, but I'm not gonna sit here and fucking run my Yap. Like I, I mean, I don't know what the fuck I'm talking about to begin with. I definitely don't know who I'm talking about with that. I would, I would go get some fucking therapy. It just say, I don't know what it is. I don't fucking, nothing gets me going. Um, and then hopefully you, you go to some asexual specialist. Jesus. I'm the worst. Sorry, I let you down. I'll give you a podcast magnet next time. I see. All right. 27 year old Virgin Jesus Christ. Uh, hey Billy, I love to hear your humorous take on my pathetic situation. First of all, dude, let's work on your self esteem.

Speaker 2:          00:48:16       All right? You're already shitting all over yourself. Um, all right. Hey, watch this guy. Watch him shit all over himself. I'm a 27 year old virgin. Oh, ggs. Uhh, that's what he wrote. Now your first question is going to be, how the fuck did that happen? Well, to protect myself, I'd actually preserve, prefer to keep my background is quite as possible. Hey, I'm not trying to get you to rat yourself out. Here's what I can say. I come from a rich town inhabited by obnoxious [inaudible]. I was always the weird kid and very socially awkward people hated me no matter how nice I was, Jesus Christ. Dude, are you like a superhero that's like the exact same background of like every fucking superhero movie, isn't it? It's probably cause nerds, right? Those movies because they don't have to fight and all of a sudden you're like, what am I knew how to fly? What if I could fly? There was a guy who can save me. Um, then they draw it and then nerds line up around the block to go see it. Did he see you spank him in? Yes. It's exactly like the other ones. Um, I was always the weird kid and very socially awkward people hated me no matter how nice I was. And eventually I came to hate myself and still do.

Speaker 3:          00:49:23       I called it dude, I fucking called it. Uh, he's shitting all over himself. Eventually it was discovered that I most likely have a mild case of Asperger's syndrome, which is a mild form of autism, which is way out of my league. Are you guys trying to make me look dumb? I thought I did that. I achieved that by how awful I read out loud.

Speaker 3:          00:49:45       Here we go. That causes social ineptitude and Quirky personality traits. Well I would go find a hooker with Asperger's. That's the first thing I would do. You get the Fucking v off my back. Definitely wear a condom. See that's where my advice is going to be coming from. You guys. You have some weird conversation in some ironic vehicle. Um, at least discovering this made me more of self aware and I've been able to clean up my act over the last few years, but I still have a lot of social anxiety, shyness, and very few friends. On the flip side, I'm actually pretty decent looking, have a decent job in a laboratory. These are fucking, he's going to get bit by something radioactive and he's going to become a superhero. Uh, and I'm a certified commercial pilot and do volunteer work dude. Like you know something, if, if I was in the FBI, like so many fucking red flags just went up there. Uh, okay. That's the set up now. Now for the question first, what the fuck would you do if you were in my situation? I told you I'd get a hooker with Asperger's syndrome and you guys could just bond

Speaker 3:          00:50:54       over that. Uh, I don't know. Let me, let me, let me read all your questions. I'm obviously kidding him off. I'm trying to find a hook with Asperger's syndrome, right? You couldn't find one that would be like needle in a haystack, which you'd have to do is go to an escort service and request that personally.

Speaker 4:          00:51:08       Um, I would think

Speaker 3:          00:51:12       I'm looking for 36, 24 36 with Asperger

Speaker 3:          00:51:18       hair color does not matter. Yes, I can hold a next if, if eventually everything I ever do make it anywhere with a chick. Should I tell her up front about my status? I had this conversation a few weeks ago with a friend who has a lot of romantic experience and she said it would be extremely obvious that I'm new to the game and that withholding that information could itself be detrimental. But I also know that if I do tell a chicken 27 year old virgin, she will demand an explanation before going any further and it will send up red flags for the most. What do you do, Bill? Thanks for doing your awesome podcast and go fuck yourself. All right. This is what I would do.

Speaker 4:          00:51:57       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:51:58       I would just start hitting on every check that fucking interest me and I would be just totally honest.

Speaker 4:          00:52:05       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:52:05       Tell him, tell her what your, your, uh, your situation is. And, uh, you know,

Speaker 1:          00:52:12       if she doesn't accept it, then fucker let her walk and then you don't have to deal with any of the bullshit you didn't know. You just, you just fast forward through a three year fucking horrific relationship. Um, I would just be up front with people. I wouldn't open it with Ai. You have beautiful eyes and I have Asperger. I wouldn't do that, you know? Um, I will work on my self esteem. I wouldn't talk shit. You just, you shit on yourself right out of the gate. I mean, obviously, I know you're going to do that. When you said you were 27 year old virgin and, and you probably going to go that route,

Speaker 4:          00:52:42       but uh,

Speaker 1:          00:52:44       think good thoughts about yourself, man. I know that's kind of like simple, but I, you know, you gotta like,

Speaker 4:          00:52:49       okay,

Speaker 1:          00:52:50       you got to amp yourself up a little bit. Go out there and you know, you don't have to go find the check he your dreams, but just go out. You don't get to tell some girl you got fucking Asperger's syndrome. You don't, why don't you just do that with somebody that you're really interested in, but it's just want to go out and get laid. Just go out there, start hitting on chicks, turning into a game so you don't have to deal with the pain of the rejection. Just be like, all right, I don't have the balls to take the next step. Whatever that step is. Peeling yourself off the fucking wall. Striking up a conversation. Just saying hello to a pretty girl. She walks down the street. Just try to get over fucking hurdle and give you permit yourself permission to suck and you just, you gradually build it up. It's like learn how to play guitar. You're not going to pick it up and immediately be able to play all your songs. You learn a couple of fucking cords, you know? Then your fingers hurt, right? And you get frustrated, but you keep coming back and eventually you can fucking play. Pussy is no different.

Speaker 1:          00:53:47       That's what I would do. Put The ass burger on the back burner. Who knows? Do it. Maybe not as fucked up as you think you were socially. You know what I mean? Maybe you've got a sense of humor under there. I think you do your shit on yourself in a funny way. You know, spin it around that way. Do you have any interests? Go, go to a, go to a fucking, I don't know. Whatever, you know, do you fly kites? Go to some flying the kite.

Speaker 3:          00:54:09       Good venture. There's gotta be some woman there also likes to Kate. I know that was an overly simplified thing by, that's what I would do. All right.

Speaker 3:          00:54:18       And then when you go to like a hookup with somebody, uh, they, you know, edgy yet. Tell him if he stopped and you're not, don't know what you're doing to watch a couple of fucking pornos, you know, you'll get the idea. Actually no, don't do that. Don't do that. Cause then you'll suck and start slapping them around. You don't do that. I know what to tell you, dude. I get buy some books. I say go buy some, buy some books in that data that, that part of the bookstore that you know, if bookstores exist anymore going gone line has got to be plenty of information. I bet if you literally looked up finger banging technique is you looked how to kiss. I bet this is going to be reams of fucking information.

Speaker 2:          00:54:59       Okay.

Speaker 3:          00:55:00       I've never done that cause I never had to. Oh, just kidding. Of course I had. Do you think of that? I didn't wish that fucking information was around way back in the day when he had no id, just practice kissing your fucking pillow and tried to overhear conversations in the fucking high school cafeteria and try to figure out what people were talking about. That's all I could do. You, you have the whole world at your fingertips, you know, so when you're done in the laboratory working with radioactive shit before you get bit by something you don't want you to go on and get late before you learn how to fly. All right. All right. Personal dilemma. Hey Bill.

Speaker 1:          00:55:37       Hey Bill. Hey Bill. Read my fucking letter. I got some problem. Oh look who's up.

Speaker 3:          00:55:46       Look who woke up. What's up buddy? How are you? You want to go outside when we make my dog howl. This is Cleo.

Speaker 2:          00:56:01       You won't go outside.

Speaker 3:          00:56:04       Cleo. She's dancing around Cleo. Cleo,

Speaker 3:          00:56:15       do you? I tried to go low. Cleo, come here. Cleo. Ah, you fucking, you know I feel right and I feel like I'm that bugs bunny cartoon when that bullfrog is singing. How my baby hell am I on a, you know, and now you guys are here so she won't do it. Cleal now she's licking herself. I'm not gonna fucking be able to top that. All right, personal dilemma. Hey Bill, a few days ago, a good friend of mine lost her dad in a motorcycle accident. Jesus Christ. Is there any ray of sunshine at the end of these? We started off, let, let's, let's just rewind here. Let's see where the fuck we were. How we got to this point. All right. Start it off. Validation. My son's in that job that was kind of, oh, whatever surprise, we're getting a divorce. I blew somebody at work. Holy Shit. That we go asexual, fucking whipped that around and then we can hit the 27 year old virgin now.

Speaker 3:          00:57:09       Now we're talking about death. Okay. And none of this am I qualified to talk about, um, bill a few days ago, a good friend of my lost her dad in a motorcycle accident. It's obviously an incredible emotional time for her and her mother, much younger brother and rest of the family, her dead. This is such an awful joke. Did they tear? That sticks his stick figure like picture off the back of the SUV. Sorry, I had to lighten it up. I had to lighten it up. I'm sorry. All right. Her Dad loves his motorcycles and we'd take it across the continent with his body and his wife and he had his kids on dirt bikes since they were young. Everyone is giving all the support they can and will continue to do so in time. Uh, during this tough time about bar last week, my buddy and I both bought our first motorcycles and I've been really excited to get it out on the road. We both pulled over 15 grand into it. Not only our bikes, but Ryan and gear and two courses. Obviously this is pretty bad timing and we can't cancel or reschedule the first course or else we both give a grant to these dicks for nothing. The course is next weekend and we're not sure whether or not we should go under the circumstances.

Speaker 2:          00:58:27       Okay.

Speaker 3:          00:58:27       It's a funeral falls within that weekend. It's obviously more important, but if not, should,

Speaker 2:          00:58:34       yeah,

Speaker 3:          00:58:34       we take the course.

Speaker 2:          00:58:37       Okay.

Speaker 3:          00:58:37       I told her about the bike and do this is fucking hilarious. This is fucking hilarious.

Speaker 2:          00:58:44       Yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:58:45       This guy is trying to act like he really cares about this guy and he's trying to weigh whether I go take my funds are really course or go to the fucking funeral. I thought the stick figure was a bad joke. Now I don't feel bad about it. All right. I told her about the bike and courses before the accident, so hiding it really isn't an option. I don't think she would want us anywhere near a bike after this. Uh, okay. I see what you're doing. All right. A strike that. Strike what I just said. I've been close with this girl for a while and I don't want to do anything that might make the situation work. Where's my buddy and I both know this sounds incredibly fucking selfish and if we had the option even rescheduled, we would have done it, but a grant to a student as a lot of money and we don't want to give it to these pricks. I love how these guys are pricks how they fix these. Then that practice, they have a business, they said what? It was up front. They didn't Jack it up. You paid it for them. You're trying to make them out to be the bad guys here, but we also don't want to offend and make her and maybe make a fender and maybe make things worse if that's even possible at this point. What should we do? Thanks

Speaker 1:          00:59:47       stowed. You want to go to this fucking course and the worst way you give a shit you care, but you don't want to lose your fucking money.

Speaker 4:          00:59:58       MMM.

Speaker 1:          01:00:01       Yeah. I mean 1000 bucks is 1000 bucks. I don't know what to tell you. You got to answer that one on your own dope, but you want to go, you definitely want to go on. There was a way for you to go and not go to the funeral without getting in trouble. You would fucking do it in a second. And it has nothing to do with those fucking pricks with their business.

Speaker 4:          01:00:20       MMM.

Speaker 1:          01:00:23       All right. You know who's kitten? Whoa, dude. Steve with all the fucking dancing and skipping around there. You want to fucking go learn how to ride a motorcycle. You have $15,000 motorcycle. All right. With the [inaudible], Punky Tuscadero outfit, you want to go put that on? Is there a way for you to fucking go to the course and then come back? Dude, this is what you do. You go take the course that day. All right. And hopefully the funeral's at night and right is the service starts. You're, you come flying back on your bike and then attribute to that guy who died in a motorcycle. You come through right through the fucking church doors on the motorcycle and when everybody fucking gas, if you just yell out,

Speaker 4:          01:01:06       yeah,

Speaker 5:          01:01:06       you want a water. He died doing what he loved and I brought my bike and I went to that class because I knew he would want me to do that. Look at me that way.

Speaker 1:          01:01:22       All right. Continue on with the service. That's what you do.

Speaker 3:          01:01:25       All right. That's my advice. If you're going to fucking do it, cause I know you want to do it. What's your wrestling with right now, sir? Is the selfish cunt within you. And I'm not judging you. I am. I'm relating. Good luck. Alright, Matt chicks. Oh wait, I haven't done any advertising this week. All right, here we go. Here we go.

I just let it flow right through me. All right. Smart chicks. Bill, you're an American hero. Lead talking to May for what if I did? I, I uh, I must know somebody at the American hero awards. Nepotism. Uh, my dad started it so he just gave me one. I'm smart chicks, smack chicks. My girlfriend dumped me because she could sniff out my bs before even realized it smelled. She was definitely smarter than me because after I was through pouting about being dumped, I realized she was right. That's very mature. You know, you're not that dumb. There's a lot of smart guys, you know, they can't do, they think Albert Einstein would do that. Some chick who's smarter than him, he could fucking handle that with his Phil Spector haircut before Phil Spector.

Speaker 3:          01:07:14       Tom Selleck, mustache. All right, so here's my question. How do I make smart chicks dumber. Thanks for you help. Don't go fuck yourself. Fuck others. Okay. Um, this guy's a wise ass. I like, how do you make smart chicks dumber? Um, all right, this is what is what you'd

Speaker 1:          01:07:34       do. I don't care who they are. They got to have some sort of physical thing that you can tell it there that they're sensitive about. Okay. Maybe they have little arms like that little hot Italian chicken on the food network. You know, every time she goes to reach something like her arms are always totally straight or else she can't get it yet. She somehow like five foot two. That's what you do. You just look for something. Okay. And then you focus on that. Anytime she starts being smarter, you bring up her little arms, you know, you bough, you gradually destroy her spirit. That's how you do it. Now, do you want to do that? I hope you don't because if you do, then seriously go fuck yourself. Oh, sorry. Anyways, let's go dilemmas bill. Would you rather gain a three pack a day smoking habit or have to wear a dress for the rest of your life?

Speaker 2:          01:08:30       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:08:31       Oh, I take a dress all day long.

Speaker 1:          01:08:35       I'd take all fucking day long. I would get some fucking, a fruity smell and shampoo to wash what's left of my Hayek and uh, I'd wear, I'd wear down the street. You know what I would do? What? I would start hanging out in coffee houses and act like I played guitar and I'd probably get more ass than I ever did as opposed to fucking three pack a day. Smoking habit. There's no fire. I want to do that. Then what? Die earlier. I'll be at my desk bed going out, dress still be alive. Uh, the Bruins still at first place. Fuck. I know that. Got To win it again. Uh, would you rather have a third nipple in the center of your chest or a third testicle? Oh, without question. I take the third ball all day long. Who the fuck's going to see it? You know, and then a fair, we get kicked in the balls. I got one that can get out of the way. So maybe it can like somehow offset the pain of one and only feels like, like when lance gets kicked in the balls. Does that make any sense?

Speaker 2:          01:09:28       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:09:29       I mean, I dunno when, when is a girl really gonna what is it girl? Really even look at your boss. You know, it's funny. I could have three balls and my girl would know. You know, I know. Notice that course you're dead and it's all fucking inflated and not inflate it and shift in and it's, it's like, uh, I don't know what it is. It's like a ball sec. I don't even know what the fuck is in there. Yeah, it's throw another one in there. I don't give a shit as opposed to having that third one sitting there looking like a late model Ford 1948 Ford, it was at the, uh, no, what was that guy? That Tim Robbins, that car Tim Robbins made in that movie. Tucker. Look at like the front end at one of those Tucker's, yeah. I'm not doing that.

Speaker 1:          01:10:13       Having a third headlight. No fucking way. No Way. There's not enough makeup to cover that up, but you know, whatever, throw something else in my ball bag. Hey, you know what I say about my ball bag? The more the merrier. And he liked that. All right. And what that, that's the podcast for this week. Everybody up nice and early, it's able to be downloaded perfectly. What could you think about bitching about next? Who knows? Please visit me on Twitter. I'm almost up to 100,000 followers, you know, and I think once I get to 100,000 that's going to be critical mass. And that's when I can really start hitting you guys with my conspiracy theories and, and possibly start getting a little momentum, you know? Um, that's it. Okay. This week everybody, I'm going to be at the DC Improv. It's already sold out, but I'm going to bring it up just so I can tell you that it's sold out.

Speaker 1:          01:11:04       You know like when they have a poster up on the wall and they just stamped, sold out on, it's like, well the why you still advertising it to rub it in that I'm not going. That is exactly what I'm doing. I'm at the DCM prop down. I'm out there to celebrate, celebrate their fucking a 30th anniversary. It's one of my favorite clubs of all time. You know? There's some special ones out there, ones that I dreamed of playing and that is one of them. How do you like that endorsement? People at the DC Improv. I love him so much and we'll be there in a Tuesday. Oh Jesus. You know what? I just try to overly cross my leg over the top of the arm rest here and I just crushed one of my balls for a second, you know? Why do you think that just happened?

Speaker 1:          01:11:45       Do you think my house is haunted? Do you think there was maybe somebody who used to live here named Ulysses who was killed by a bunch of fucking mean neighborhood kids because they found out he had three balls and now I finally brought it up and I unleashed him. You know what? I think I'm going to call ghost hunter as cause it's the grace, the ghost of three ball Larry. And you know what's funny about that fucking ridiculous Goddamn show is they would actually show up to film it. You know? You know I want to do it. I want to film them filming my place and catch them when they throw that rock down the hall big. Oh, what the fuck was that? Did you still saw a door? I definitely felt something. You know that show is, it's like a bunch of Paul versus chasing ghosts. All right. You want, you want to hit the biggest, the biggest fucking scam ever, and this is such a big fight between me and Nia all the time, is the use of the fucking dishwasher. I think the dishwasher is one of the biggest scams other than the Federal Reserve. It goes Federal Reserve,

Speaker 1:          01:12:54       ice cubes, anger, and then the dishwasher.

Speaker 4:          01:13:01       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:13:01       And you can throw, skip Bayless in there somewhere. His, his screaming and yelling somewhere. You can throw it in there somewhere. I don't give a fuck. Um, you know, it's all, it's all up to personal opinion. The dishwasher, it doesn't fucking wash dishes. And I know this is a Seinfeld thing.

Speaker 6:          01:13:16       Why?

Speaker 1:          01:13:19       Yeah.

Speaker 6:          01:13:20       Did you call it the what?

Speaker 1:          01:13:23       Um, yeah, it doesn't, it doesn't, the dishwasher does not scrub the dishes.

Speaker 1:          01:13:32       It basically like you have to take a piss and there's a skid mark and the toilet and you just start pinging on it. That's what a dishwasher does, you know? So basically if the food has been there long enough, it's not coming off. All right. And My lady will fucking put dishes in there and they'll stay in there for fucking days. And then she runs it and it gets, it gets most of it done, you know? And then I go out to make myself an egg and there's fucking dinner from fucking three nights ago, a couple of like skid marks in the toilet, Lasagna, skid marks on the fucking plates. It drives me nuts. I had a hissy fit. Everybody,

Speaker 5:          01:14:13       okay? I literally, I had a hissy fit, I'll even call it that. If you saw it, you would have laughed your asses off. Cause I was here by myself cursing and screaming when I couldn't figure out why we didn't have any fucking forks, where are the forks? And then I finally was like, you know what, I bet during the goddamned dishwasher. And I went over and opened dishwasher and it was like fucking 10 plates in there. All with this shit that you couldn't get off yet. I didn't have to hire one of those fucking guys who paints cars at this point to come over here with that sand blaster to get the shit off. And uh, you know, I don't know. I'm, I'm, I'm talking too much about the ship, but the dish dishwasher is completely, it's a scam. It doesn't fucking work. And for some reason it adds value to your house. When people show up, does it have a dish? Oh honey, they have that thing that doesn't really work.

Speaker 1:          01:15:01       You know? Ah, Jesus, your bill, you know it's, you're an hour and 15 minutes in. You gave them their fucking money's worth. Do you really need to end it with your goofy little riff about dishwashers? Do you think other people never used them and realize that they don't quite fucking work? You stupid cunt. All right, that's the podcast. Go fuck yourselves. We'll talk to you next week.
