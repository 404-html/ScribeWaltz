That sounded really creepy. Um, hey, what's going on? I have been running around all day. Podcast is a little bit late. I was actually doing Joe Rogan's monster podcast. Um, and uh, we had a great time. Talked a little bit about flying in a helicopter earlier this week and uh, and then he got me all sold on buying a fucking sauna. Yeah. Joe, Joe, Joe. Fuck. It tells you something like, all right, this guy, you know, he's probably read up on it, whatever. He was like, people who do this four times a fucking week, you know, live a long time or some shit. And I'm just thinking like, well, I'm an old dad. Oh,

Speaker 3:          00:01:03       I don't care.

Speaker 2:          00:01:04       Oh Man. Old Dad Joe,

Speaker 3:          00:01:07       make me come too far away.

Speaker 2:          00:01:11       It's going to be me in five years. Oh yeah, you can job doing to cad. Um, so I have to, uh, make sure I take care of myself. So, uh, Billy's got some growing up to do. All right. Been abusing alcohol for a while. Now I take the bottle out, I slept around a let them know who's boss. Um, and I got to fucking grow up. You need, you need to call up. He had to take a little bit spanky Philly, they fucking say that all the time. You and sneaky, a little bit of responsibility. Uh, I've never in my life understood that expression. You need a little bit of responsibility. They'll pick like the most immature fucking person ever and tell them you need some responsibility and you're like this fucking guy. No, this guy does not need to be in charge of anything. He's a fucking moron. Because they had that whole idea of, oh, well, once you have a kid and then you have, you know, you're, you're gonna have to, you know, change your ways. Yeah. Unless you're a fucking idiot and everything this person is doing is demonstrating that they're a fucking moron and you're telling them to go out there, procreate with somebody.

Speaker 2:          00:02:31       You know what you need is no responsibility. You need a fucking playpen is what you need there. Bucko my new year's resolution is I'm going to, um, I'm going to fix it. I'm going to fix this little phone, a headphone Jack. I literally sit here with my thumb on the button like a terrorist. You know what I mean? Like I lift it off it, you know, my mom, my way to fucking Evan 70 broads in my life. I know it's a hacky joke. The more you're married that just you just like, Oh God. Um, anyway, um, all beeble oh, bill burr is fucking slowing down, man. In a good way. You know, I'm off the sauce. Who knows? File log, but I'm off the fucking sauce and I'm actually reading a book. I swear to God. I mean, granted, it's a sports book. Does that even count?

Speaker 2:          00:03:25       It's about, uh, Bob Cousy and Bill Russell's relationship. When I did the heard somebody over there gave it to me believe this is where I got it. And um, you know, one of the things that always bothered me, you know, something I always got meant to get around to was to know all the Celtics retired numbers. And now that I've read the book, I finally, I think I am, I'm down. I swear to God I'm not looking at anything. All right. Number one is Walter Brown. He was the original owner of the Celtics. Number two is red are back. The great coach. They consider a number two, he got number two because he's the second most important person in the Celtics history I guess. Cause number one is the original owner. Then it's Dennis Johnson. Number three, Bill Russell, number six. Why do I, why do I need to know this? Jo Jo white on the great basketball names? No, but 10 and then it's Bob Cousy at 14. Tommy Heinsohn is 15 some guys, Tom Sanders is 1617.

Speaker 3:          00:04:28       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:04:28       Eighteens Dave Cowens 19 is fucking Don Nelson. 21 is Bill Sharman.

Speaker 2:          00:04:37       22 was Ed Mccauley 20 three's Frank Ramsey. 24, Sam Jones, 25. Casey Jones. All right, now it's not, now it's easy. 31 said Vic cornbread, Maxwell 32 is Mikael 33 bird 35. Reggie Lewis, double zero is fucking Robert Parish. Then there's another guy just says his name cause he also wore the number at 18 and didn't want to retire it. And the Dave Collins got it. So I don't know his fucking name. So that's not bad. That's not bad. Um, so now my know that and what does that get me? Next time I get into an argument with my wife now, but watch Walter Brown now, but two's red are back. Can you do this?

Speaker 3:          00:05:16       Oh Dad,

Speaker 2:          00:05:18       I'm an old dad. I said, get off of that now I need a nap. Um, anyways, so after I did Joe's podcast, he's like, he's got like did that flotation salt tank thing in there. And I'm like, dude, I don't know if like if I went in that fucking thing for like an hour,

Speaker 1:          00:05:40       like

Speaker 2:          00:05:41       I always wondered what those things will like those isolation tanks. I mean that looks fucking wild. They just closed that door. And you're in there floating in pitch black, like you're floating through space like Sandra Bullock in that movie. Right. Where the other guy there was never going to get married and then he did George Clooney. Right. May just sort of floated off into space that I could never get my shit together. You go back to the bucket spacecraft, I'm just going to float away that movie. I feel like you'd feel like that, you know, if I ever get a role where I get to play an astronaut, that that's, that's to be how I'm going to prepare for the role. But what did you do to prepare for a role to play an astronaut? Well, I kept my Boston accent and I just went to an isolation tank and just laid there in a bathing suit.

Speaker 2:          00:06:32       Do you think it helped? You know, but it gave me something to say in this interview. Um, anyway, so he had a sauna there, which I'm totally sold on now. We went there, we tried to be in there for like a fucking half hour. He could do it. I couldn't, I, I made like there was eight minutes left, 10 minutes left. I made 20 minutes. It was like 200 fucking degrees in there. That's what he was saying. Like, how the fuck is it? 200 degrees now. It doesn't water boil at like 212 degrees or some shit, a hundred degrees Celsius. Um, I guess those scientists can get harder cause it's not like it because it's a dry heat. I have no idea on all. I know. I was just like, all right, 10 minutes left. He goes, come on and tough it out. I'm like, all right. And then 10 minutes later I'm like, how much time's left? And he's like eight minutes. And I'm like, fuck. And it at like five minutes I laid down and he's like, all right dude. He knew I was too stubborn so he fucking opened the door and then I was fine. He goes, you almost made it. It's like, I think I did all right. I don't think I need to go any further than that, but uh, I felt fucking great. I felt peaceful. I felt calm.

Speaker 1:          00:07:41       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:07:42       I didn't feel like yelling at anybody or walking around being a fucking emotional lunatic that's just wears people out. Um, so whatever. I'll see. They makes little two person ones. I want to make it fit it in my fucking little ass garage. Yeah, no, that would be great.

Speaker 1:          00:08:02       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:08:03       You know, anytime you have a disagreement with your spouse, right? You just go into the sauna at the rule is you go in there for half hour and then when you come up then you talk about it. Hey Man, like you left your shoes in the hall, man. Oh, I'm sorry man. It's okay. It's not, it doesn't really, but I didn't know why it bothered me 31 minutes ago, but it did. But that's, you know what, you can put your shoes wherever you want. Ah, thank you. I appreciate that. I don't know what the fuck I'm talking about. So anyways, um, I get not only do I have all my Christmas shopping done, I got, um, I got it all wrapped except for when I bought my, my daughter this book, uh, the Grinch stole Christmas. I bought that on the road. And I just, I forgot I had it, I tucked it away in the drawer because I knew if she saw it and she'd be like, book, book, read, read. Yeah. Um, so I just have to wrap that. Then I think I'm done. I'm think I'm done. And I think for once my super smart wife hasn't figured out what anything that I'm going to get her,

Speaker 1:          00:09:12       you know,

Speaker 2:          00:09:14       that was really covert about the shit. Snuck it around. I just, I brought everything into the garage this year. Right. Sorry. What the fuck was that? You don't shit where you open your mouth and you just make a fucking noise. Did you just hear that? Sounded like there was a ferret that was like some, something in the back of my throat while I continued to talk. Sound like a little cat. Did you hit her? You know, do you realize like bag, if I did that back in like the fucking 1700 state, they'd be like drowning me thinking I was a witch. I was like possessed or right. A fucking tapeworm or something.

Speaker 2:          00:09:48       Jesus Christ. Some of these fucking broads on, on social media. Thinking they're not being heard. How do you think the the fucking people felt back then? Well, if you have to compare ourselves to the Salem witch trial, aren't you really proving our point? That was the hedge clippers trim in the bush there. Um, they broke. Anyways, I'm plowing ahead here. Uh, by the way, I've keep promoted this on, on Joe Rogan to I the Patrice O'Neal comedy benefit. It's still promoting. That is February, Tuesday, February 19th, 2019. Get your ass to the fucking city. All right, come on down. Great benefit. Big J. Oh, Chris. Michelle Wealth Rich Vos. Good cipher sounds myself has going. It's going to be a cavalcade of comedy, but the best stand up comedian I ever saw my life, all proceeds go to benefit all the people that he's taken care of, his family. Well, you know, all that and it's been a very successful thing. We keep his name alive and whatnot. Um,

Speaker 1:          00:11:04       okay.

Speaker 2:          00:11:05       All right with that. You know what? I actually got to watch a Bruins game the other night by can't watch most of it. I watch most of it. And then, uh, being a dad comes in, you know, I saw, uh, the first two periods of the Bruins, four to nothing win over the Canadians. You know, we were up two to nothing and I missed the fourth period. Third period. Sorry. And uh, you know, one of my friends

Speaker 2:          00:11:28       from Montreal comedy festival texts me, cause you watching this game, and I knew it was the third period and I was like, well, I go, I'm assuming you guys tied it up if you fucking called me. And to his credit, he didn't. He texted me, he, to his credit, he didn't. The man did not. We played fucking great. Then I saw the highlights at last fucker, Marshawn golden number for, they're little big bank bull all around the horn. Everybody it, all those little frenchies with Dave fucking crying into their little handcuff chest with this silly socks. Oh, I love it. Going into their building, four to nothing. So the private plane tonight, I have no idea, but I gotta go, I gotta go on site for fucking supper. I still call it supper back in the day. That's what we call sit down for September. Your mother would ring the fucking dinner bell and everybody would come running in like cattle, right? I'll fucking filthy for being outside there. It was chipped beef on toast. Uh, chicken, Alec. Kig.

Speaker 2:          00:12:31       You know, I don't think a king eats like this. Um, so let's plow ahead here. Uh, it's Liverpool. My fucking, my fucking adopted God damn team. My almost fucking miss this game. They're playing all my God. They're playing the wolves. Jesus fucking Christ, not the wolves. How the fuck is that a professional franchise? You've got some stupid Jersey with like a w on it. We get it. You know, you couldn't write the whole thing. They can't afford to have the o l v e s on there, right? Does that he spelled or was it w o l. F s. Wolf's. I Dunno. They'd say everything different over the old Oregano oil. Oregano. You know, what else do they say? Tomato over a Gyno. Uh, all the spices they say differently. What's it? Rose Marie? No, that's not the one with the flex time. They see the same way. There's another one. There's another one that was just the ones Basel or Rogano Basel two mottoes. And you just want to be like, stop doing that. You want to say that they're wrong, but they did it first. So they were right. Why the fuck did we switch? We switched all the accents on everything and I believe that was a fuck you right to England

Speaker 2:          00:13:50       after we kicked their fucking red coated asses all the way back to their island, all the way back.

Speaker 1:          00:13:57       Right.

Speaker 2:          00:13:59       And I just think that our little rebellion was not only are we kicking you out of the country that you first fucking occupied and took over. Not only will we can send you the genocide that you started, right. We're gonna, we're gonna change the accent on the English language.

Speaker 1:          00:14:17       Right.

Speaker 2:          00:14:20       Do you say, uh, automobile? We're going to say automobile. I don't know if we do that. I have no idea. Um, anyways, uh, fuck was that I am up. Goddamn noise is not, I don't know if I'm going crazy or what. I will tell you what's driving me fucking crazy is this year I thought it was being a smart guy. Oh, who's just to, as a tough guy, he was a smart guy, right? I went out and I bought a Christmas tree like when was still November.

Speaker 1:          00:14:53       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:14:54       You know, so now I'm watering this thing and I got a missed it every God damn morning to make sure it, it's not all brown and dead. By the time fucking Christmas comes along, our wreath is on the, on the front door is already dying. You know that my wife went all out. You know what I mean? Like great mothers do. She went all out, but I got more goddamn shit. I'm running around, you know I, I'm the water boy. I've got a water rate. I missed it. I'm talking to it. No, you look good. You look good. Now you're going to be one of the trees that lives after Christmas. You don't just lying to them like a fucking dirt bag. Right? So I didn't have a lot of time the other day and I'm running around the fucking kitchen table and we got this stupid fucking potted plant that literally has a concrete plant plant or whatever the, the fucking house that the roots are in, whatever you call it. Right. And that was on the floor because of the Christmas decorations on the table. And I ran around the table and just punted that thing, concrete fucking block with my, my pinky toe on my left foot and Jesus fucking Christ.

Speaker 2:          00:15:58       It was like Barney the dinosaur purple within two hours and it was like a half of my foot by foot look like I got run over by a car. Now, you know, obviously I did some damage, but most of it has to be my, it, most of it is my complexion, you know, being uh, a a fucking, you know, redhead, I'm borderline like transparent. Like I'm always getting marks on my body and like late at night, like I go to bed and my wife would be like, what does that, what does that on? Yeah. What is, you know, fucking kilohm mark on my side. Did you get into a fight with an alley cat? Huh? No, I think I uh, think I leaned up against the refrigerator. I Dunno. What the fuck happened. And then when, you know what's weird is if you hurt yourself and you don't remember what happened, you press down on it and then you're like, oh, and he takes you right back to that moment. Oh, that's right. That's fucking ride. Yeah, it was, I was at the, the fucking poster. Oh, by the way, Jesus Christ, I went to the post office. I was trying to get all my fucking gifts out and uh, you can not fucking go there.

Speaker 2:          00:17:09       The only way you can fucking go there is if you have everything done. I went there, I needed a box and I needed to, and then I need the fucking, the peanuts or whatever to put it in there. So what I was, whatever I was going to put in there was going to slide around and break and I need to tape to close the box. It should just like, it's just that last chopper out of Vietnam I in and I was happy that I went down there. I found somebody to help me out. You know, I got the box, I got the tape, and then they said they had nothing to put in there to make sure my gifts to my nephews and nieces wouldn't fucking slide around. And I, I just, I just, I said, fuck it. I said, all right, thank you. I sent the tape down and put the box where it belonged. I walked out like a gentleman while I fucking, I went a little Tourette's underneath God damn fucking well, what the fuck do you have? Fucking boxes and tape, but you don't have the, the last inquiry, the most important ingredient.

Speaker 2:          00:18:06       Well, the last piece of the puzzle, I should say, the box is probably the most important. Agree. Well then you have to tape. I mean, they work together like a great comedy team, dare I say, right? Like Bob hope and bing Crosby. They, the guys who evidently created the fucking the buddy movie, you know, which has now been hijacked by all these females and all these movies and acting like they're breaking ground. It's like you just doing the shit. We already did this. Nothing new here ladies. You know, why don't you reinvent the buddy fucking movie before I got to listen to your call on each other. A bunch of fucking heroes. What do you think about that? Hey, uh, this is the thing that fascinated me because I was reading the Celtics Book and some of the fucking teams that they were playing, like, you know, playing Syracuse and Rochester stuff I had heard about before. But um,

Speaker 1:          00:18:55       okay.

Speaker 2:          00:18:56       When they were talking, what the fuck is this? They were talking about playing like the, uh, what are now the Atlanta Hawks and I knew that they were in Saint Louis, but I didn't realize that they were in Milwaukee before that. All right, let's see here. At Atlanta Hawks. Yeah, they were, it, this is, this is their, their history. They were the buffalo bisons

Speaker 1:          00:19:23       yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:19:24       Then for one season and then they moved, or maybe a half a season. Then they moved to the tri cities in Iowa, which are now the quad cities, I believe. And they became the Tri city black hawks.

Speaker 2:          00:19:37       Then they may move to Milwaukee in 1951 and became the Milwaukee Hawks. Then in 1955, they moved to St Louis and became the Saint Louis Hawks. And then in 1968 they moved to uh, Atlanta and became the Atlanta Hawks. And they'd been there for 50 years. But they've moved five times. And I always thought the Sacramento Kings, which I can't remember if they were the Cincinnati royals and then the Kansas City kings and then the Sacramento Kings. I couldn't remember. Hang on a second. Let me get to this, cause I got, I got this fucking website here that has all the franchises that moved, if I can get it to work here, please, please. Is People listening? National Hockey League, where the fuck is the NBA? Oh Jesus Christ. Come on national basketball. So she, the Tri city hawks, Blackhawks played their home games in Moline and rock island, Illinois and Davenport, Iowa moved to Milwaukee, became the hawks, then in 55 then we'll just St Louis. Okay. And then the Detroit Pistons with Fort Wayne Pistons till 1957 Rochester royals moved to Cincinnati.

Speaker 1:          00:20:54       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:20:54       And then where the fuck did they go from there?

Speaker 1:          00:20:57       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:20:58       Cause this goes year by year. So all day became the Sacramento Kings. Yeah, they were the raw Rochester's Seagram's. What the fuck is that?

Speaker 1:          00:21:07       Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:21:07       Anyways, Rob Chester pros and they became the Rochester royals, then they move Cincinnati royals, Kansas City slash Almaha kings, Kansas City Kings, Sacramento Kings. And then I think the Syracuse team moved to San Diego and became the San Diego Clippers. Where the fuck is it? The Syracuse nationals moved to Philadelphia and became the 76 is, okay. So who became the La Clippers? The San Diego Clippers. Oh, the buffalo Braves moved to San Diego and became the clippers. That's what it is. Oh No, it's the Rochester royals. I don't know. I'm a fucking nerd. I love that shit. Then I go online and see if I can find a tri cities black hawks tee shirt. Like they ever fucking sold one of those. I bet it's a minor league hockey team now. Tri City.

Speaker 1:          00:22:02       Come on,

Speaker 2:          00:22:03       come on bill. You can write it. Black Hawks t shirt. Here we go. Somebody makes it, you know somebody makes it. Mitchell and ness. Chicago Blackhawks, Tri city, black hawks. There it is. Everyone would like myself would think, oh, is that where the Chicago Black Hawks first played? And they'd be like, oh no, no, no. That's not, that's not the case. All dead. MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:22:34       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:22:35       Damn. They got the, they got the dude. He's just see them all the fucking kid. If they got it where and it was like 21 fucking years old. Similar designs. Look at this. They got all the old ones here anyways. Trust the process. Yeah. Boy, I didn't want to know who the fuck said that. Uh Oh. There's a cool Lebron one where they make his beard like the state of California. Do you realize if the Lakers don't win it this year, this will be the first decade. They haven't won a fucking championship since the fucking 1960s seventies eighties nineties two thousands they went for decades in a row. Celtics won 50 60 seventies eighties

Speaker 1:          00:23:17       okay.

Speaker 2:          00:23:17       Well it went for decades, right? It was seventies eighties nineties 2004 Oh yeah. No one's ever done five. No one's ever done five. Can you see, can you tell him? I'll fucking talked out from Rogan's podcast. We did like fucking two and a half hours. I'm sitting here wondering what the hell to talk about. I could, I could read some advertising.

Speaker 1:          00:23:35       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:23:35       I could read some advertising. By the way, I'm not farting continually. I'm just sitting in a leather chair. I just realized

Speaker 4:          00:40:21       Christmas fucking trees all be Dolby. See, that's the fucking song I was trying to remember from last week and I want to thank all the podcast listeners for letting me know that that was Andy Williams. Happy holiday slash the holiday sick season. It's not until the second verse where he goes, Whoop de Doo and Hump Day dot. Bad. Stick up a sock, but buck and crazy twat and you don't see it exactly how I said it. And then they had those fucking women in the background. Uber Dooby, dooby Ba boom. You telling me you couldn't write a fucking song back then? I mean, Jesus Christ. Maybe because it's so simple. It sounds so simple that you think you could do it. I don't know. So anyways, it is. Oh fuck. Why did I play that? And I want to be singing at the whole God damn podcast again. I don't like to repeat myself least not on purpose.

Speaker 4:          00:41:16       What's going on? It's bill burr. It is the Monday morning podcast for Monday, uh, December 20th. Oh my God. Only five more days till Christmas. I only have half. Shut up. You fucking, yeah. All right. I'm not even this angry week. I'm just trying to figure out how I'm going to situate myself on the bed. I don't want to put my laptop in my lap. You know what I made? Why would you, why won't you put it in your lip? It's called the lip dupe. Um, this is why, because it gives off radiation. And I liked my balls. I think the Illuminati came up with the laptop, you know, and they know we're too stupid to stick it exactly where they want us to put it so they can find out the fucking heard. So they go, you know, with their evil voices, whether we just collected laptop, we call it didn't let up these put it in their lap and they fucking die.

Speaker 4:          00:42:09       The infidels, that was half Arab, half Italian. So make sure I get notes from both of you. Um, yes it is December 20th. I just came off of a fabulous week out in Bray, California and I want to tell you guys something. If you're ever in a situation where you have a lot of vacation time and you just like, fuck, where the hell can I go? You know, you only go around once in this world, where can I go to vacation to summer is not one rich people say we live in the city and we somewhere out in the Hamptons. I'd love to summer somewhere. Would that be awesome? Jesus Christ. How much fucking money do you have to have? They have two homes. This is where I live during the year. And then I summer we spend a linters down and boom Bados doing what? Visiting the fucking money that you're not paying tax taxes on.

Speaker 4:          00:43:09       You know, I don't give a fuck. I didn't know what I'm talking about here. I was on to something there and then I completely lost it because I thought I wasn't recording here. Um, oh, I know. I was out in Bray California this weekend and I got to tell you, I had a miserable experience the last couple of times that went there. And the only reason why it was miserable is because nobody showed up. And Lo and behold, this time I came out there and the fucking place was packed all weekend and I had one of the best weekends of, uh, of 2010. So I want to thank everybody who came out to my shows, uh, out at the Improv in Bray California. Actually had some people from La came out and a, I had like 12 Mexicans, different Mexican fans coming up saying you have some Latino fence.

Speaker 4:          00:43:57       Okay, hang in there. We will spread the word out to Ontario. So I want to thank you guys. Grassiness Julie word. I know moo chose grassiness Rosetta stone. I'm a Rio. Um, that's how you thank you very much. And yellow. That's my only Spanish words. Ay. Caramba yeah, Shit like that, that I've seen in like cartoons when I was a kid. Um, so anyways, I don't know what the fuck to talk about this week because uh, I am technically, I'm on vacation. Like Axel Foley had Beverly Hills Cop. I'm not investigating anything. I'm out here in La with my Mumford fucking sweatshirt. You know what I realized? I just realized this podcast is going to suck. You know why I have too much other shit on my mind because as much as I'm mocking people who haven't started this shopping, I'm one of those people. I haven't started it yet.

Speaker 4:          00:44:52       And it really fucked up because I did like six weekends in a row. So I just focused on the roadwork and I did not deal with the fact that I haven't done any sort of Christmas shopping yet. So now I have to go out there today it's fucking raining. I've been in this weather since I went to Seattle right after Thanksgiving and I'm ready to blow my fucking brains out and went to Seattle and I also went to San Francisco. It all those fucking assholes would just like, oh you bring, you bring the bed where the with you? You know, I don't, I don't know. It was, it was great last week. So you know what, considering I bought the droid phone. Does anybody know how to shut that off? [inaudible] every time you turn it on my phone says that I brought the droid incredible. And every time I turn it on, first of all it takes 10 minutes for it to turn on.

Speaker 4:          00:45:40       And then about, you know, eight minutes in it goes drilling mud and I don't think there's a way to shut it off. That's one of those fucking advertising things. Make It nice and loud and obnoxious. So everyone around we'll hear it and be like, Ooh, I want my phone to do that. All right. I'm still waiting for that. Like I hope that phone does not take over as much as I love it cause uh, I fly too much, you know, and at the end of the flights when it's okay to turn your cell phones back on, I don't want to hear like draw, draw, draw, draw void on the fucking plane, put, you know, I'm going to, um, but anyways, yeah, I haven't, I haven't started any of my Christmas shopping and uh, I don't want to be that Douche just goes out and gets the gift certificates. You know that, you know that person, you go out, you buy him something thoughtful. What are they into? A, what did I hear? A mention that they wanted or something like that. And you put a lot of thought and you drive around now that isn't right. Drive over here that isn't right. Bam. And then you find it, they're like, ah man, thanks a lot. Right.

Speaker 4:          00:46:46       And they give you like a fucking, yeah. You waiting to see what they got you right. Do you put some thought in? Do you feel this way about me too? And what do they do? They hand you a gift certificate to the fucking olive garden. You know, it's like you fucking asshole. How, you know, I drove all over fucking town and you just, you just, and not even a good restaurant. That's an, that's another thing too. Um, if somebody gives you a gift certificate to a restaurant, don't fucking go. Don't even fucking go. All right. What sort of respectable restaurant gives out gift certificates? You know what I mean? That's, that's just like one step above fast food. You know what Douche bag of the week is? Anybody who goes out and does Christmas shop and it just gets a bunch of fucking gift certificates. Hey you go, you fucking figure out what you want is some money.

Speaker 4:          00:47:39       Why don't you just come in and take a fucking handful of cash and throw it on the floor, like have some goddamn whore and watched me crawl around on my hands and knees picking it up. You know, like I just gave you a bad lap dance, but you got enough money to not bitch to management. Hey, you'll have the really, that's what I get is have fucking hundred. Don't spend it all in one place. All right, you fucking cheap bastards. I'm talking to you and you and you just gotta be at least three people on this podcast that do that shit. You fucking tight fucks. Right? And then what do you do? You gather up all your nice gifts that people put thought into and you just, you know, walk out of the house. You know, you don't give a fuck, right? Fuck it. Right.

Speaker 4:          00:48:27       It's just the drinking water. We can pour the shit in there. Well that kept me the corner office. I swear to God, if somebody gets me a fucking gift certificate this weekend, I'm going to do some of the not, this is Christmas this weekend. Five days away. Yeah, it'd be Saturday. I'm going to take that fucking thing. Oh, thanks a lot. And I'm going to slice the juggler like James Bond level, fucking paper cut and just watch that blood right off the side of the fucking neck. All right, so you learned something about me. You already knew I was an angry son of a bitch, but I hate gift certificates. I can't stand them. I would rather get an ugly sweater from an older relative then. Then, then a fucking gift certificate. That's just, you know, he did. That's just the fucking tap out. You know shorty, man, it'd be really busy. Oh really? Oh, I've been laying in a hammock all year. You Lazy. Fuck no, you don't give a shit.

Speaker 4:          00:49:28       Why am I such a fucking Dick? Somebody I knew every year would get me a fucking gift certificate and you know, I should have just gave it right back to them. I never did. I always gave him a nice gift thinking, Nah, you're gonna, you're going to notice, right? Nothing. Nothing. Oh, we shit. All right. There you go. This your first ran for the week to them. Make you feel better. I'd like to hear the why. Why do I have, why don't have a podcast where I give thanks. I give thanks to everyone who came out to my shows this year. You know, I give thanks to the universe for allowing me to fuck up enough in my personal life to bless me with an a new hour of material. I've got to tell you, man, my fucking act is right where I needed to be. And, uh, my next Gig is until, uh, the weekend, I believe of January 13th.

Speaker 4:          00:50:20       Um, I'm going to be in Atlantic city with a, this is the show. Jim Norton put this thing together. It's Jim Norton, myself, Jim Breuer, and David tell all on one show. All right, the Miami Heat, the Mount Rushmore, if you will, of a, of standup, a standup comedy. I can't see Mount Rushmore. That'd be all time. Great. So let's go with Miami Heat. All right, let's go with that. How about we say that? So anyways, that's my next show. So I have this weird thing where I'm off for like a month, but I also have to stay sharp. So my girls all excited that I have a month off and I'm actually doing a show tonight and I was trying to tell her that I, I have to stay sharp, you know, I got to stay on my toes. I can't just sit around fucking roasted chestnuts. Does anybody do that anymore? That anybody ever had a chestnuts?

Speaker 4:          00:51:14       Chestnuts roasting on an open fire, Jack Frost nipping at your news. There's no internet or fucking cell phones, so we have to talk to one another. Um, all right. What, you know, something, something I mentioned, they're actually tied into something that somebody was talking about. Oh, they were talking about die hard fans. I'm talking about sports here. Somebody said a bill, just like the Yankees, the Celtics purchased the last championship with Kevin Garnett. I love when people do half ass research. You know, didn't you forget a couple other guys that we also bought? Um, it's not, it's not even the purchasing of Garnette that bothers me. It's the delusion Boston's fans have when they cheer for Garnette that motherfucker kissed the shamrock in the center of the court. Like it was his homecoming, like he was from Boston. Like he yearned for playing for that team and Boston's fans ate that shit up.

Speaker 4:          00:52:13       Totally bought into that shit. Uh, when in actuality it was just another purchase for a championship. How do you feel knowing your fellow Bostonians got duped? Uh, the bowl shifts fan base I see in Boston makes me want to puke in my soup. And it happens in a bunch of other cities to, uh, sorry, I, I can't read out loud and I'm also reading this at a fucking angle. Let's get some fucking stomach cancer here. Put the laptop here. Uh, where was, where was I, I you have die hard fans for all your teens, but they're few and far in between few and far between service. How you say that? Uh, then you have just a bunch of stragglers who suddenly come out of the woodwork when their teams on top. I live in New York and now in La, in the past eight years I've noticed an influx influx of pats, fans and both of those cities.

Speaker 4:          00:53:01       All of a sudden everyone is proud to be a patriots fan. Uh, where were these fucks in the 90s? Same goes for Laker fans. Where would those assholes with the flag on the car asked uh, with the flag in the car? Assholes in the 90s explained this to me, Bill and go ahead and shit on as many front running New Yorkers, Los Angelenos in Miami, schmucks all you like. Yeah. Yeah. Dude. You're basically explaining uh, yeah, that's how it works. Yeah. Where were all the Yankee fans in the 80s exactly. You can't say where were all the patriots fans in the 90s because once we got bill Parcells, everybody jumped on board. And then when Pete Carroll came in after parcels fucked us that fat fuck that fat fuck Egomaniac who never won a championship without bill Belicheck as his defensive coordinator. Who is you will be to cook to do, do you go, there'll be buy the groceries.

Speaker 4:          00:53:55       He says that right before our Superbowl puts his fucking house up for sale. What a cunt fucking were overrated bill. Parcells if you want your uniforms changed and you want to make it to the playoffs, he's your guy. But if you want to win the Super Bowl, you got, you better have bill Bella check on your staff. All right, yet I yeah, you Bandwagon Fence Bandwagon fans are, are uh, the majority of the fan base. There's no reason to build stadiums as big as they are. If they're actually talking about diehard fans, you'd only need like a one level, you know, you could have those old school like high school stadiums, you know, with a wind whip through the end zones. Uh, yeah, absolutely. That's, everybody is guilty of that. And, um, basketball, I hate to say it has followed what the, uh, what baseball has been doing, where you just sort try to buy the, buy the championship every year and it's really a free agency. I guess it's kind of the player's fault. You know what it was, it was an overcorrection. It was before free agency, you know, the owners were like the owner in, um, what does that call the perfect stallion? What the fuck's that? I can never mean Robert Redford movie, the natural perfect stallion. How the fuck did I get?

Speaker 4:          00:55:14       I can't remember. Shit. I can never remember the names of actors in movies. So I just, whatever the first thing I think of, I just fucking throw it out there. Uh, the natural, yeah, the owners were like that. They totally fucking owns you. And um, that's why the fucking white sox through the world series in 1919, that's what opened the door to that is they were getting so underpaid and they were scumbag pieces of shit. Those two fucking thanks. Um, so that free agency came around and now there's been like a total overcorrection. Um, and the players are seem to be completely in control and they can just all pile on one fucking team. I don't know. I don't like it. I don't like it. Yeah. The Celtics bought the championship. Abso-Fucking-Lutely uh, but you know, it's one of those deals. What are they supposed to do?

Speaker 4:          00:56:01       That's what the, the Lakers were buying them too. You know, what are we supposed to do? Sit back and watch them by all these fucking championships and we're not supposed to go out and purchase one. You know, Coby Brian sitting out there can't win shit. So they buy him Shaq and Phil Jackson. Fucking Gary Payton, Robert Henri fucking Malone. Who else? I don't watch hoop. Every time I turn it on, there's another fucking guy, the guy who beat up the crowd, Ron, our test, that guy. What? What, what, what the fuck are the Celtics supposed to do? You know, it'd be nice if they all sat down and just said, look, this is fucking stupid. Let's go back to the way it was. But I just think that that's the way it is. So anyways, yeah, they just pile on. I think Garnette kiss the floor because he was sick of playing in Minnesota and he knew we finally had a chance to, uh, to win a championship after be in the fucking guy for all those years out there in Minnesota and always coming up short.

Speaker 4:          00:57:03       So I don't know. I don't fucking, I don't know. I don't know shit about basketball, but yeah, you're basically yet diehard fans, diehard fans hang in there. But uh, I even think diehard fans of full of Shit, there's a couple that will actually sit there. Come on man. You're going to be honest with you. I'm a die hard fan. Your team is going to end 14. You're actually sitting down watching that shit. You know, sometimes you such a die hard fan, you can't go. You can't watch, you know, I didn't watch the Celtics. I went to a Celtics game the year before. We bought all those guys to win a championship. We played the Toronto Raptors. I had like court side fucking seats and I almost fell asleep and it was just sad looking at the parquet floor and looking at the shamrock and just seeing it was, it was, you know, it was hard to watch.

Speaker 4:          00:57:51       That doesn't mean I don't love the Celtics, but you know, sometimes you got to look away and you know what, you fucking cunt, you do the same thing. Stuck. Act like you're all high and mighty. You just hate the Patriots and you're sick of seeing them. Be honest with yourself. All you sports fans, who the fuck ever saw anybody in a sports bar with the New Orleans Saints Jersey on ever 30 years of watching football? I never fucking saw it. And then last year there's like a whole gang of them going, who dat? Who Dat? Who Dat? They going to beat them saints. It's like, where the fuck did you guys come from? The sates were borderline. They will like an expansion franchise for like 40 years. They couldn't even afford a kicker with two whole feet. They had a kicker with one and a half fucking feet. That's, that's, that's how fucking broke those guys were, you know, then they brought that football out there with the helium in there so they could have a feel good story.

Speaker 4:          00:58:56       Oh, by the way, um, did you see how the jets, when they got busted for cheating, that fucking fag on the jets go with the Patriots are doing it to that right there is known as a pulling a Coby when you do that shit. That's called the shack fucks around on his wife too. You know when you're down at the police dude, you don't ever do that. All right. When you get busted for some shit, you go into mister blonde mode, you shut your fucking mouth and you'd do your God damn time. You don't start dragging other people in. It was so passive aggressive. I'm not trying to get anybody in trouble. I've just, you know, if you just look at the tape, I mean it's all there, which was such a stupid, there's no rule against lining up people there. You can stand on the sideline, you can all stand there doing hand stands if you want.

Speaker 4:          00:59:50       That's not what he got busted for your green cunt. He got busted for sticking your fucking knee out evidently on purpose. How wrong was, I tried to be nice last week and I defended that Douche and it turns out, uh, I dunno. I like how they tried to act like that was his decision and his decision alone. That guy actually, he shut that guy. The strength and conditioning coach. That guy a solid guy. Cause he just, he took, he took the blame for that one. The strength and conditioning coach. He the only guy, he's, he's the guy like as far as moneymakers, he's just above a fucking cheerleader and he's saying like, he's on the sideline. Hey listen guys, everybody fucking line up the private over there. They're blaming the private, you know, give me a fucking break. But I think sticking his knee out was definitely his decision.

Speaker 4:          01:00:43       But as far as lining up on, on, on the side, I don't give a fuck. So I love it. So the jets cheated and this week the panthers had somebody get up and drills, drill, someone coming down the sidelines. See this is what it's all coming out. I love it. After all these years of people saying the Patriots and cheaters like no one else is doing it. Like the Yankees weren't all taken fucking roids [inaudible] along with the fucking red. Everybody cheats. You guys watch that 30 for 30 on Smu and how the entire southwest conference football was played.

Speaker 4:          01:01:16       I hate to say it during the week of Christmas, but there's no Santa Claus. Everybody fucking cheats. Everybody Cheats Booboo, booboo. What song is that? Remember that from fucking sesame street. Everybody sleeps and they'd show like turtles sleeping and you'd sit there almost tearing up, not even knowing what the fuck you were crying about. You know, cause you already knew it. You could sense it even as a six year old that the world was going to be full of a bunch of selfish cons. Hey, you know something? I have a video for you this week. How many fucking agonizing minutes am I into this podcast? 22 fucking minutes. Jesus Christ. I gotta be honest with you people sometimes this podcast is easy and other times I feel like I'm shoveling. What snow. And uh, this is one of these times I feel like I'm shoveling. What fucking snow? Uh, I'm sick of talking about football.

Speaker 4:          01:02:06       I can't talk about it any fucking more. Uh, thank you to a Green Bay, Wisconsin though I do want to say thank you for that Christmas gift for allowing us to win that game that we shouldn't have one yesterday. And do you guys realize, actually bet the Patriots after telling you guys all given 14 and a half fucking points, I bought into the hype. You know what a moron all year. I've been saying, I hate our fucking difference. Our defense, let's up 24 to 30 points every fucking game. We have two good weeks in a row. I even said last week on the podcast, you think I'm buying into this shit. Like we're going to win a super bowl. You don't just play two good games in a row and fucking wipe out 11 bad ones. And after say an all of that, what do I do? I fucking bet the Patriots because they're fucking quarterback was out.

Speaker 4:          01:02:54       And I'm a fan of Lsu. I don't ever remember that guy fucking doing anything. You know what it was that guy played at Lsu right before started watching college football. But my experience of watching Lsu is they have fucking, uh, they always have two quarterbacks, a white dude and a black dude. And they should, they just sorta, I don't know what they though. They just a, they just switch them off and it's not the same guys every, every fucking year. They got a new white dude, new black dude, and they just, uh, put the white guy in there. I used too fucking white. Look at, I'm taking that sec sick. The black guy in there. Jesus Christ. He won't stand in the pocket. Get the white guy back in there. I'll tell you if they could somehow Amalga just stick those two guys together. Add it probably wouldn't work. I know it worked for Paul Mccartney and Michael Jackson when they sang that fucking song. Was that one of the worst songs ever? Wait a minute. Was that him who sang? Ebony and ivory. Okay. That was them, right. I was thinking of Eddie Murphy and he made it. Stevie wonder and Frank Sinatra. That was the sketch. Yeah. Was that one of the worst fucking songs ever?

Speaker 4:          01:04:04       Ebony and a movie. Somebody looked at the piano and just came up with that corn ball shit. You know what I mean? It's like, yeah, we all want everybody to get along, but do you have to try to make us throw up in the process? Okay. Why is happy shit so nauseated? Can anybody explain that to me during the week of fucking Christmas, you know? Okay. What is it about watching like a kid trip and fall and start crying and then looking for his mother? What is it about that that's so fucking funny. Okay. You know when they get up and they're crying so bad that they're not even making any noise. Yeah. It just fucking makes me laugh. You know, watching my dog gets so excited that it wants to go outside and, and it goes to make us quick. You know, fucking Barry Sanders cut and its legs front legs go up from underneath them and I hear him hit his jaw off the floor,

Speaker 4:          01:05:12       gets up and fucking does that little Harlem shake to try to, it's just fucking funny. I don't know what it is. Maybe because I grew up watching the three stooges. I don't know why, but watching, uh, watching people fuck up makes me smile. What is wrong with me? I really am destined to be alone. Um, all right, speaking of Christmas, um, last week I made the mistake of, I told you I bought a different kind of Christmas tree for the holiday season. Whoop de Doo be Doo. Um, I dunno, the past couple of years just to, just to, you know, for, for new listeners this week, you know, I don't know what happened. I just, I at last couple of years I went there and I looked at these Christmas trees and they would like, they will like symmetrical and there would be like, you know, six inches a tree trunk and then they'd have like these perfectly level branches.

Speaker 4:          01:06:04       I just thought they look bad ass like that Japanese gardens sorta zen look and shit. And I loved it and I thought that, you know, I thought, you know, I knew I was going to get shit, but I thought at least a couple of people would come out of the woodwork and dare to break fucking tradition. Let's read some of these, uh, these uplifting comments here. Uh, Bill, this guy tried to write day yum and he spelled damn yum, da m y u m damn yum bill. That is Charlie Brown's tree. Looks more like an anorexic Lohan then thrown. All Right, Nice Tree Dick. And he see, this is what it's like. You guys want to get into entertainment. This is what you get all week. This is pretty much the tone. Every once in a while, a great special. I loved it. But other than that, that tree makes the peanuts crew look like ballers.

Speaker 4:          01:07:00       I would rather decorate my coat rack then that's Skank shrub Jesus Christ. Somebody wrote, this is the soundtrack to that tree. I don't get Internet in this fucking room for some reason, so I can't click on that. Uh, looks like a used up toilet brush. Uh, it looks like the tree, the tree, the three stooges would have thrown other picture up when you throw the lights on it. Oh look at that. And I liked that one. That's a twofer. Made Fun of the fucking tree and made fun of my bare walls. Um, yeah. People, you got a glimpse of how I live my life. This is why I'm debt free. I enjoy enjoying your credit card debt. You can't, I know how to live.

Speaker 4:          01:07:44       I buy a Christmas tree. I can actually afford. All right. Uh, yeah, you probably should have got the other tree. What are you a fag? I like it. I wanted a Charlie Brown tree. I was going to buy a real tree and cut off half the branches. So it was like Charlie Brown tree and my girl went out and bought one herself so she could say it's hers and I can't cut it up. Okay. It's like I was kind of like kind of on my side. So what does that 20 against one for me? Looks like a cell phone tower in disguise.

Speaker 4:          01:08:16       Jesus. I'm getting killed here. All right. Uh, let me see something. Everybody's just going, Charlie Brown on me here. What do we got? Do it. I was generally excited to see your tree. Where did you pick it out? What'd you pick it out? Champ. Fucking Afghanistan. And it actually looks like something that would grow out of the soil in Hiroshima. No, seriously. I'm Grad. Glad you're going out of the ordinary with the tree this year. Good. Good for you. But I had no idea trees could get hepatitis. Merry Christmas. Oh look who's here. Nia. Everybody is agreeing with you. You want to come on the podcast? Wait a second, let me, uh, let me get your mic up here. Here you go. Hi. Hang on, hang on, hang on. Let me make sure you're real good. Just talking Christmas, everybody. There you go. Talk a little more. All right, happy holidays.

Speaker 4:          01:09:09       All right. Um, would you like to hear some of these comments? They all agree with you about the tree, about the tree of the holiday season. Boy, uh, maybe I should have known what to expect when you scribed the tree, but I didn't expect that. No offense, but that just looks awful, man. I have to admit that that one hurts more than, than people who, somebody said it looked like a cell phone tower. Like those ones are actually funny. This guy that that was, that one came from the heart. That would really was a, well, I'm a fucking termite and even I wouldn't take a shit on that fucked up tree. Jesus.

Speaker 4:          01:09:48       Wow. Sweet tree. Not, oh yeah. No. You know what that is? That's like from a fucking anthrax fan who's like fucking 48 now and has three kids. That's from like a Wayne's world. Then they always used to say that not the first time I saw not was anthrax. That guy had it shaved into his chest. The word, not an OT. Yeah, the guy who then eventually shaved his head. You know those guys who go bald, they're always like Harry, like apes, the guy, the guy who was on that, that VH one show where they had the super group. Oh, uh, yeah, aunt. He had the long beard. Yeah, the long beard, but just the long beard. Yeah, I know who you're talking about. I forget what his name is. That meant when I shaved my head because I'm losing my hair and you maybe you should fucking a girl that you loved the shame and love it when you had this shaved head.

Speaker 4:          01:10:36       I say bring it back. Well, I think nature is going to bring it back for me, but well, it's good to know that you still look good. Well he knows I can't do the fucking Rogaine Propecia shit. I just can't. I, I just know. I know how it works in life. You don't get your cake and eat it. Nature's going to get ya. You want to keep your fucking hair. Okay. Why don't we just fucking take a shot to your goddamn liver. Those people are gonna lose their livers. You know, they're full heads of hair. What did I walk into here? I thought we were talking about the tree. The anorexic tray. Yes. So if you've done any Christmas shopping, let's do quick little interview. I get the people all caught up with you. Have you? Uh, look at that tree. I think the tree looks fucking cool as hell.

Speaker 4:          01:11:17       It's not the Charlie Brown tree. You fucking asshole. Wait a minute. The symmetrical to Charlie Brown tree was all brown. Look, all you guys, you have to take a picture of the tree now that it's decorated though, because I think there's a debate. It looks like a fucking fucking Broadway singer with aids because it's all glitter and skinny. What a lot of them died of that. Oh, they do? They do dress flashy. You need to stop like, well, I'm not saying that. I agree with that. I'm saying that that's what they would write out for everything offensive. They, I'm not saying I agree with it. It's just how it is. Fucking dirt bag. Oh, I saw that movie and the band played on. Right. I don't remember any guys friends. I don't mind any guys driving garbage trucks holding their other garbage truck boyfriend rocking them slowly. It's not only gay people who can't. I know it's that. It's that and truck drivers. Let's move on. It's Christmas so I know it is. No, let's talk about aids and let's talk [inaudible] I play now. Come on. This is fucking hilarious. I never saw me. It was a long time ago. I know how the car did the song go? I don't know. There was a song. Yeah.

Speaker 4:          01:12:34       Where are you asking me about Christmas shopping? Wasn't it about San Francisco? Isn't that where they basically don't know and Harvey milk came in and then that other guy shot him in the head or is that a different milk milk. Oh you want to Sean Penn. Can I show you the most? I can't even, I won't even show this to cause I love you too much. Somebody sent me a youtube video. You guys have ever stopped you showing me horrific pain. This is why you don't get affection. I try to be. I did. I tried to give it to you and you slap it down. Look at that. What's, what do we, what do I got to replay? What just happened there? I said I'd love to show this to you and, but it hurts you to, uh, you know, I'd love you to whatever the fuck.

Speaker 4:          01:13:12       Nice thing I just said he don't even remember. Anyway, it's two seconds ago, but I meant it. All right. There's a movie called Feast. This is going to be on the [inaudible] podcast where you guys feel free to go on their trash. My fucking Christmas tree. I like it. I'm sticking. But you know what this is like, this is like the new kid who comes to school and you guys all pick on him and I befriend him cause I'm stronger. I can step outside the group. Look at me. I'm the hero. It's just a tree and I'll fuck you. All right. The movie, there's a movie called a feast. Yeah. Have you ever heard of that movie? Okay. I don't know what's going on. I can't, I don't want to, oh, that's my phone. What is your cell phone sound like? The tornado drill from the 50.

Speaker 4:          01:13:56       It's cause you know what is this? No, there's no good ring tones. You know what? Go Go, go get the a, you know what? I'll let my podcast listeners decide the rink. Tom, go grab my phone if you don't mind. All right. All right. And I'm going to describe this fucking thing while while you're up. Okay. There's this, this, this movie out there. Feast that I have to rent. I don't know what's going on, but there is a woman tied down and this beast that looks like a little person that was a skinned alive basically comes out of nowhere. And Fox, this woman in the mouth and finishes there. I said it, I said it and it happened so fast. I didn't even think that it was real. And uh, I dunno. That's when I have to ask. It's like you're not really trying to scare me.

Speaker 4:          01:14:47       You're just trying to either gross me out or make me fucking laugh. But if you really want to get grossed out, um, here's another youtube video of the week. Somebody sent one in. I only got like two minutes into this thing and I had to shut it off. Human cryogenics. All right, so if you guys, you know, isn't that funny? I told her to go pick up my phone. She goes and answers it and now I was talking to the person, you know, what would you broads be doing if you weren't running? You fucking yaps. You know I, it's like I don't understand. They just, they just have to be talking.

Speaker 4:          01:15:25       All right, whatever. So human cryogenics, red sox fans, we're all familiar with that. You know what I mean? Ted Williams head, I believe is upside down sitting on a tuna can and they accidentally broke his nose. I'm talking about Ted Williams. They froze. Do you believe in a pick up the microphone. Oh God, you're going to be eaten on the podcast. You know, I think this is good that you're on the podcast. It's, it's, you know, it's the holidays. It should, it should be family here, but some people, some people don't like my Christmas tree to look. First of all, the Internet is like a, you know, like when you hang up those lights to track bugs, Zap them. That's what the Internet is for. [inaudible] you know what I mean? They, yeah, they just gravitate towards it. All these miserable fucks who have all the power in the world to change their life and live the wonderful life that we're living on this fucking bed without a headboard.

Speaker 4:          01:16:21       I've been trying, you know, somebody trashed us because we don't have, we don't have any pictures on the wall. I'm trying to teach people how to live a minimalist debt free life. First of all, we don't need pictures on the wall. We have a picture on the wall that bill hates. We have the live pictures get way too fucking intimate but women. But we have a picture above the fucking bed of it. Looks like. I thought you've talked about this venture. You have. I talked about it. All right, well I already brought it up. Yeah. It's like every time I look up there's another deer. Can't see it and it's staring right into the fucking Lens. It's not black and white. It's not in color. It's Sorta in that Blair witch look. It's kind of a Sepia town. I fucking hate it. And you know something.

Speaker 4:          01:17:02       I know you hate him. Yeah. And I, whoa. I almost fell in between seats. We need a headboard. How much just fell off the back of the bed. But I'd like personally like to point out the fact that you went out and just bought that fucking photo. Yup, I did. And hung it. Right. Look at that. And you just hung it right over the bed? Yeah. How can we didn't ask me about it? I don't know. I just thought it would be nice. Really. What if I get a poster of fucking Larry Bird? He played for the Celtics and he used to do this thing where he would always wipe the sweat off the side of his feet. So I'm going to get that. So it looks like one of his fucking blonde balls is going to fall out of my shorts and I'm going to hang that over the bed.

Speaker 4:          01:17:38       I don't want to see how fucking long that lasts. Um, I just wanted to say that we have a mantle and there's pictures all over the mantle of all of our fans. Those are the pictures we have. You know what this is? This is hilarious how innocent you are with the Internet. What do you mean you don't defend your position? All you do doing now is prolonging the arguments and now they'll do like really do, why don't you put a picture up of him if you have them? Cause they just want more material to trash you, but they haven't even seen our apartment. Who are they to say anything? Exactly. I'm not, I'm just saying what you're doing is, it's like what? Someone trashes you fucking white. You're legs are, I know. It's great. I just take them out in a job interview and I get it.

Speaker 4:          01:18:21       So He'd go, you just agree. Absolutely. Whatever. Yeah, I'm horrible. I look like a puppet. Absolutely. You're 100% and it kills it. That's what Madonna's done. You're a fucking whore. I know. You want to see my twat. Check out my new book. I got it all over there. I got a close up. Didn't she take an a in that book? She took a close up of her fucking hoo ha. I don't think so. Yeah, she did. I think she was fully nude, but there wasn't a closeup I that wasn't that book. No, the sex book. What book was that? I don't know. I don't think he was a little red wagon.

Speaker 4:          01:18:55       What was the last book that I read? That book was, uh, my, I think was my favorite work by Madonna and I thought it was their most honest work. You know who's standing out there on the street looking like a fucking prostitute. Exactly. Exactly. She looked good. She looked phenomenal. She looked really good and still banged that fucking cougar. You know what I hate? You know what I love is that she's gotten all their varicose veins. Fucking minutes stuff. I was just going to talk about that, cause she's, everyone always talks about her arms are so veiny. It's so gross. But you know what? Madonna works out every day and that's blood pumping through those veins. You can see life. That's what those veins are. It's very inspirational. Yeah. She, you know, she's like, she's like somebody who, you know, she's no, you know what she's like, she's like Clint Eastwood in that movie.

Speaker 4:          01:19:43       Gran Torino. Torino. Yeah. I'd never been named the car, the grant and the grand jury duty year fresh. I know that. Oh, I forget to get off my lawn. Is that, what's the word? I can't remember. Yeah, but then I would say all racist Shit, which people won't get that. I'm making fun of the movie and I'll think I believe it. Well that's what he, that's what he did in the movie. He was racist anyway around. Oh yeah. Cause it's a Hollywood movie. Wow. Because it's a holiday movie. Listen. Yes. Grant Torino that, that's, that's how she's treated like the way he treated that car. That's where she's treating a body. Her body is like in fucking mint condition. It is, you know, and all the rest of us, what do we do? We fucking back into a car and I'll worry about it. Slammed into a tree.

Speaker 4:          01:20:28       That's how we treat our bodies. Doesn't settle for second. Yeah. She's out there wax in it. Oil Balls to the wall, not the whole fucking old school shit this week. So, uh, yes. I did go Christmas shopping to answer your dude, go Christmas shopping. I have a little bit. What did you get me? I'm not telling you what the surprise you'll find out on your shirt. You know what sucks about being a guy is the last time you get a good gift is I think when you're 11, the second you turn 12, you start becoming an adult. Maybe he gets to Mike Electronic Shit. You know, you just go into that, that phase. We get shirts and uh, uh, organizers. This is a place to put your wallet, Your Keys. I actually fucking love that. You know, that's really unnecessary.

That was when we were talking about our social security numbers that are seven, nine, eight, four. That was what I thought. I you brought it up. I'm trying to get you to stop talking about it. Fine. All right, let me see if I've got a question here that you can actually answer or you can add to. I don't think I have anything. You know what? This fucking podcast. Oh Shit.

He like has like, he's, he works out too much. Like he actually, you know the cuts people want when they get abs, he has them on either side of his forehead.

Speaker 4:          01:23:36       His head is shredded, he's in great shape. CVDS are no fucking kids. So she sits there and she starts telling me how his Biz DVDs are hard and all that. I was like, fuck that guy. I can do that Goddamn DVD. I'll be fine. Typical man. Right. And then what happens? I go to stretch before I do it because I'm 42 years old and you're like, oh, you don't need to stretch you as this whole at thing. And He fucking didn't. And I ended up screwing up my foot again. They're stretching in the beginning. Yeah, that's bullshit. He didn't didn't into any stretches for your back. Nothing. Nothing to stretch out your feet. And then the guy has the fucking fucking jumping. I got Bill Walton feed at this point. I can't do that. God Damn Video. Bill Walton. Bill Walton was a big fucking redhead who smoked weed in college and hung around John Wooden.

Speaker 4:          01:24:23       And then all he does is try to, like John Wooden was, was this amazing coach who gave you all this life advice and he's trying to be John Wooden junior always giving out advice, always telling those stories. And he has this awful fucking voice that's like, it comes from the center of his head and goes out as fucking broken nose. I mean, ugh. Fucking redheaded Frankenstein. Well in the midst of that workout when there was all that stuff going on with the back, I was like, why don't you stop and just kind of do an alternate version of it and you wouldn't do it because you're a typical man and you have to see like, I can do anything. You know what? I just love that you say a typical man, lump us all in and then give me shit when I talk about all the broads.

Speaker 4:          01:25:12       You've always done that. I always have done that and I don't have a problem with you saying that guys are hard headed because we are. We're fucking morons and you guys goes, you guys are psychos. All right. We're emotional but doesn't mean I don't like you. The key buzz fucking Bandana. What do you think about that? Oh, t buys right from that fucking, what's the name of that group now was going to sound like, how long is it going to take you to get the name of that bill? Never remembers the name. Crazy sexy. Cool. Was the name of their album. Don't go chase. I thought they were saying don't go Jason waterfalls. And I didn't know what that meant. I was like is that some sort of hip hop slang? Who's Jason?

I know what they said. Why do you have that thing under your uh, your left eye or so she had something on her fucking face and she said, cause I is right. And I was like, Oh put a count, you know right there or cause she's dead. I'm not supposed to say that. When she was alive, she probably wasn't difficult to be in a relationship with. Wasn't she the one who burned down that guy's fucking house? Yes. She didn't go to jail because she has a vagina. She went to jail. Are you done? Went to jail for that. How long? I don't know. Exactly. Internet and look it up instead of just one of those things where you end up being wrong.

Speaker 4:          01:26:51       Well you ended up being wrong and you're proven wrong, so you just fucking gorilla your way through it like you just said. Yeah, that's what I'm saying. She did go to jail bell. Look it up. I'm not going to look. They forced her ass to go to Rehab because she was an alcoholic on top of it anyway, with the, why are you saying it like she's some sort of a victim? She burned out so he please keep them Mike in front of your mouth. He didn't say that she was a victim. I did not say that he gave her the out cause she was an alcoholic. No, I didn't. Yeah, you guys, you guys are always every the whole, your whole fucking life. You just giving excuses. That's why you guys, that's why you can't do as many pushups as a guy has nothing to do with your mothering hips.

Speaker 4:          01:27:29       It has to do with the fact that you fucking get to tee off 20 yards in front of me and still get the gift, the same fucking score.

Do you have anything that you want to say before I dismiss you? Happy holidays. Everyone. Be Good to each other. Okay. I get your oatmeal and get out. Get Out. That's it. Near everybody that lovely Nia coming on the podcast once every fucking six weeks. Get out of here you go. And she's leaving. All right, there you go. So that's a podcast for this week. People, I know, it kind of sucked. I know. Some of it was Kinda nice spot. Ah, that's it. Oh, you know something. What I, I keep meaning to fucking talk about on this God damn podcast is I started, somebody sent me something, uh, about the fucking, what the hell did I do to my damn computer? Let it go. Let go of my fucking cord. Are you fucking kidding me? Get Out.

Speaker 4:          01:34:09       Hang on a second. People fucking court is stuck in there. Whatever. People keep sending me this shit about. A one person did send me about the Liverpool soccer club and the premier league and evidently these American dudes bought it and said that they were going to buy a buy, a brand new stadium. They were going to do all this type of shit and they didn't do it. And somebody sent me this great video of all these English people just from their heart's telling these American guys to fucking sell the Goddamn team and to fuck off. And it was awesome. And this is the same team that the owners of the red sox then went in and bought and I started looking at the premiere league and like three or four the teams are owned by, uh, by Americans, specifically from the United States. All right. Because we're all from North America over here.

Speaker 4:          01:35:02       Uh, and I, I can't believe how fucking annoying that would be. You don't have a bunch of English guys came over and bought my team and said that they were going to do a bunch of stuff and they fucked it up. I would be beyond pissed. Um, so I don't know. Sorry about that. England. I don't know why the fuck we did that. It's nice to know where buying something. Consider gyp. Japan's come over here and they, they fucking bought up everything over the last 20 years. Didn't they? Don't they own our roads? You know, what are you going to do with them? Close them off. Do you have enough people to do that? I don't think you do. Um, so yeah, send me some more information on it. Cause I'd like to talk about the premier league and also I'm wondering in Ireland, is that a seven nation rugby league or whatever the fuck it is?

Speaker 4:          01:35:44       Is that starting up again? Cause I watched that last year in March when I went over there and a rugby is the shit and a unlike professional football, which they're just turning into the biggest pussy sport ever. Isn't it enough that we were, that they have to wear pink for the entire fucking month of October. You know, now you can't tackle people. The amount of quarterbacks out there that are getting like Joe Montana fucking stats because they're drive was kept alive because a defensive person had the audacity to tackle someone his age. He's just fucking be on me. And uh, I got nothing left people. I'm not going to lie to you. This podcast was fucking over before it started. I have too much shit I have to do. All right. I remember the first year I did this podcast, I actually took two weeks off. I took two weeks off.

Speaker 4:          01:36:32       So, you know, whatever it was dressed down fucking Monday. I came in. I did what I could. All right. That's it. That's it for the, uh, for the podcast for this year. Everybody right now we got one more for this year and next weeks. I promise you. I promise you it will be just as bad as this one if not fucking worse. Cause I'm on vacation. I'm not required to make you laugh, but I want to thank everybody. Seriously. Everybody who came out to see my shows this year, um, I had a great time and I actually, oh wait. You know, I know what I'm doing. I'm missing underrated. Overrated. How the fuck could I do that? Underrated. Overrated. This week real quick. Uh, overrated. Both the jets and the Patriots. Being a dolphin fan, born and raised in Miami. I'm sick. I'm sick and tired of these two faggot teams dominating the AFC east for the past decade.

Speaker 4:          01:37:25       Well, it's really been the patriots. It was very nice of you to throw the jets in there. I think the jets have one. Like what? One division in the last fucking 10 years. Um, so I get it. Were overrated because your team sucks. Um, hey, did you like how while the former Dolphin won the game for the jets yesterday? Have bet you enjoyed that. Huh? I hope you get a sunburn on your ass. You fucking cunt. All right. Underrated the bills being a dolphin fan, born and raised in Miami. Like you already said, I love the bills for always keeping the dolphins in the hunt for the playoffs every year, the past decade and a half. All right. That guy was just being a dick, so I have to respect that. Alright. Underrated. Michael Vick. He does sports announcer voice, uh, Michael Vick, Michael Vick. What are one of the things you have to understand about Michael Vick?

Speaker 4:          01:38:07       Is Michael Vick the MV S P of this season? Bob, because he's my MVP. He's making fun of me talking about how that's all they say. Michael via. What can you say about Michael Vick? Well, well, Jim, Michael Vick, um, you know what? I have to admit I was fucking wrong about that guy. I was wrong, but I was also writing. Okay. Because the same reason I fucking fell for it by the Patriots playing good defense for two weeks in a row and then actually gave up 14 and a half points, ignoring the fact that they only played well for two fucking weeks in a row. You can't say that a guy's the best dude, the fucking lead. Cause he lights up the Redskins and fucking three weeks later John Kitna lights up the fucking Redskins. All right. But yesterday, what happened in that game? I mean that was unreal.

Speaker 4:          01:38:51       I think he went back to old school, Michael Vick, he just started fucking running down the field like a God damn water bug. But uh, I was wrong about that guy. Um, it's way, it's funny, he can't say he's in, he's in like a League of his own as far as like what the fuck he's doing. Cause I've never seen anybody do that shit at his position. And I'd say that he's going to change the position, but I don't know the Dilla Neb ever been another person as talented as that fucking guy at that position. Um, I dunno. So anyways, he says, uh, Bill, sorry, you have to go through another week of that shit of everybody saying Michael Vick. But every time I hear them talk about thick after a big wing, no matter, no matter what I remember about your rant against the announcers about the announcer's saying his name over and over again.

Speaker 4:          01:39:37       Um, I say he's still underrated because he broke two NFL records in the last two weeks, but still can't get any solid respect. Ah, dude. I think he's getting his solid respect. The fact that they're, they're saying that he might be the MVP of the league and he's coming off an 18 month stint in Leavenworth for torturing dogs to death. You know what I mean? I definitely, for when someone plays the fucking race card, I always listened to it because I, you know, I traveled the road and I know what people are like having talked to them, there's just, people are fucking, they're awful. The fucking awful. But this is the one time where it's like, dude, you know, you're tortured dogs to death. You drowned them, your shot him. I mean straight up, straight across the fucking board, you know, you can't expect people to 100% Embracia after you do some shit like that even though you more than paid the fucking price.

Speaker 4:          01:40:32       But I'd rather be you than one of those fucking dogs. So anyways, he said, I say underrated because he broke two NFL records in the last two weeks, but still can't get any solid respect. Honestly. As much as I hate Tom Brady, he is the real MVP so far. But people are still hesitant. I don't know who the real MVP is, but Tom Brady's having his best fucking year. Um, all right, this is a good one here. Yukon women's team, 88 win streak, overrated. The audacity of these media pricks to compare the Yukon's woman's team to the UCLA team, by the way, which was cheating by the way, with how they got all their prospects. For all you people who trashed the Patriots and act like all you're fucking winning is because you're just such smart fucking human beings. I want, I'm not going to get involved and I'm not gonna open that fucking can of worms, but John wouldn't, uh, as my buddy said yesterday was the king of looking the other way when the boosters got involved.

Speaker 4:          01:41:32       Okay, let's leave it at that. All right. Of course, it's a major accomplishment, but as is typical with everything, male versus female related, people cannot put things into perspective when it comes to females. The woman's Yukon teams, 88 wins is in no way, shape or form as impressive as the UCLA teams. 88 whims wins. I'll put it to you like this. I used to play little league football and got MVP three times in a row and co MVP once, however, Tom Brady has won the NFL MVP, I think once or twice, I have a longer MVP streak than Tom Brady, but who's MVPs are more respectable and impressive. That's right. Mine. Just kidding. Of course his are, um, all right. I get that. But, uh, do, but you're a guy and you could play in the NFL, but you weren't good enough. So that's the difference I guess.

Speaker 4:          01:42:38       Um, as far as, I would say that they're the Ucla, the Ucla of women's basketball. How about that? You got to say that because they are going up against the best females out there and they have one 88 in a row. So I would say it like that, but to come to put it up there with Uclas. Yeah, the men's, I definitely think that's bullshit. That's just the classic, uh, you know, it's like them wearing pink in the NFL. It's just did you just appeasing them? That's all the fuck you're doing. You know? Then I really just compare breast cancers to like appeasing somebody. I really should just stop talking, but I'm just going to keep going here. Um, yeah. As far as sports accomplishments go, I don't think females mean as much as men's just because we're better at it than you are, you know?

Speaker 4:          01:43:25       And we just have better hand eye coordination. Just generally speaking, we're just better at, you know, the amount of guys that if you go, hey, think quick catch and you just throw him a stapler, they're going to catch it. And the amount of women who would just take it off the face and habit, Landon, their cleavage. It's, you can't even compare it, you know, let's debate that next week. I don't think females are as good athletes as guys are. I just don't, I don't think they are. I don't think that they have that killer instinct. No. Unless they're there. They're chemically wired like a guy and they have as much testosterone. I don't think it's going to be a problem. I'm just saying this to Piss people off so I don't have to work hard next week. Uh, I think that's it. I'll do, I got some, uh, youtube videos, you know, if ever I was going to edit a fucking podcast, it should be fucking this one.

Speaker 4:          01:44:13       This one is just Jesus, whatever. Last week's was great. This is what I am at, but you know, this is a let down week for me. All right, youtube, check this one out. This is one of the creepiest ones I've seen. And, uh, it's called the liar card. This is a card you can put in your phone and for people, you know, so when you're, you're, if people are ducking your calls, that will show up as somebody else's phone call. You can disguise your voice to sound like a woman or a man. And uh, yeah, I guess you could find out where they are in case you know. I don't know what, there's another good one. Our Danny Woodhead, you know the fucking Allpro for the fucking New England patriots, right? Danny Woodhead as Modell's employees selling his own Reebok Jersey. He stands in a Modell's selling his own Jersey in New England and nobody recognizes him.

Speaker 4:          01:44:59       Uh, now the youtube and these will all be up on the [inaudible] podcast. A the cliff Lee signing did not make the boss happy. This is actually a total rip off video of a video that a yes Canadiens fan made. Um, or someone who hated the Canadians a year ago. Uh, they just took this footage of somebody playing Hitler and a movie flipping out. Um, just know that it is a rip off, but it's funny, I guess. Uh, what else do I have here? I think that's it. Is that it? That is it. All right. All those videos will be up there. I apologize for the Charpie podcast. They can't all be great hour and five minutes. And by the way, there's some maniac out. They're transcribing my podcasts and Mark Marin's. Okay. And I think Adam Carolla's and uh, how about a round of applause for that fucking trooper actually sat down and was reading, I read like three minutes of my podcast. The guy gets like every fucking word. God bless Ya. You, ah, that is it. That's the podcast for this week. You guys all have a merry Christmas. Happy Kwanzaa. Happy Hanukkah. Happy fuck the holidays. If that's how you are. Okay.

Speaker 5:          01:46:07       Have a good week. Don't take any shit that's it. And Go fuck yourself. [inaudible].
