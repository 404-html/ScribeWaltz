I'm out here in Texas, you know, came in and did Austin bunch of hippy liberals down there with the, that track colored flag, if you know what I mean. All the codes though, the Crayola box. Um, then we did Houston and hour in Dallas. I am with the one and only the pride of trend. The best looking guy on long island. Uh, ladies and gentlemen, Dude, I called it Mr. Paul Versey himself. What's up man? Tell you what's up as a new CD. Yes. Said is dropping. I believe that's all the rappers and the kids say hopping in less than 24 hours. Yes. And it's called night at the stand. Yes. Because it was taped live at the stand at this stand. Yeah, we'll do it live.

Speaker 1:          00:01:09       I didn't want to do live, everyone's like live at this, live at that. And I was like, you know, I'm just gonna stick to Knight. Knight. It's a stamp. What did she do pre recorded pre recorded at the Smith that Stan, you know what was only like three, three comics. So I don't even think I would get that joke. I a pre recorded wasn't it? Me Mean he's making fun of it saying like, oh you liked that little piece that the uh, the piece of Shit TV's on. That's a little art deco. Yeah. And the TV is way too small for that piece. It's unbelievable. That's like a toupee. If I had a little yeah, but a small to pay at my giant Charlie Brown had, that's what the fuck would look like. That TV over there. Me and [inaudible] had been going to a Texas. Um, I got here Sunday night and Monday.

Speaker 1:          00:01:49       Right. So as people know last week after my, my 72 day run, I think I came up a couple hours short of 72 hours. But uh, I did 72 day cleanse because somebody told me it takes 72 days to cleanse your liver. And somebody told me on Twitter it goes to it. It's 72 hours. She fucking dope. I heard was 40 days, so I don't know. Yeah, everyone's knowing that Jesus walked through the somebody who was like 40 days is when your liver is fully recovered. Now 40 days is Noah's Ark with the, with the, uh, with the shrubs. I wonder why I fucking now and the yaks, you know, you know me dude. I do not, I don't drink for two, three days and I'm like, I'm good. Let's go. Right. Yeah. Cigars. I didn't, I didn't see me. So let's, let's back up here. Okay. Those are what we just did was we threw out all a bunch of numbers.

Speaker 1:          00:02:32       We've got to figure out what these mean, right? 40 days. Yeah. That was a Moses 40 days and 40 nights he wandered around. Was it Abraham? I bill and he led the Jews out of the forest desert and find freedom. And I do. I was one of those, cause I didn't go to CCD. I didn't, you know, my father always hard and I always argue it's going to rain for 40 days and 40 nights duty. Only thing I know about Noah's Ark because he took a bunch of animals on a ship. How much fucking was going on that ship? He's got a male and a female. It's fun and it's been a nightmare on that ship shit everywhere. Animal Shit. And they never see that out of all the stories. I didn't know, it just came out like, did you ever see, you ever hear how Joe Rogan's bid on that? Joe Actually took the time, which is why I love his act. He actually took the time to research, which I never do. How many species? That's just just what we know. How many species are on the planet. Really? Yeah. I'd say it was, it was well into the millions and he would've had to have two of each and he had a guy like, I'm not going to do it. It just ended with this moron guy just going like, oh big ones. That fucking boat.

Speaker 1:          00:03:42       Just completely, it's one of those religious arguments that the other person would just say, you're going to go to hell. I'm praying for you. Cause they, they would have no way to, there's no robot that, that it's what anyways, Paul, you know you're a tough guy for me to hang out with, cause I get along with you so well and had a, you'd like to smoke and drink and go to the fucking I hop and all that and got, dammit. That's what we've been doing it. But let's just back up for a second. You, you are a very big influence. You're a bad influence to do them. You're a bad influence. You put this on me know, because I see him here to promote your album and you're going to do this to me now I do it. You're one of those guys where as soon as you go, yeah, like when I know you're in, it's fucking, dude.

Speaker 1:          00:04:21       You're hard to keep up with. Here's the thing about bill, when you drink with bill, when he really wants to drink, it's just, it's never a no. Yeah. And do you want to do another shot? And you just go, you get that look. Yeah. And once you do that, dude, I woke up, I miss my kids. I woke up, it woke up, my wife was ready to fucking divorce me dude, because, oh that's right. You kind of make, you just kept going and I was like, I'm not saying no to when I'm in. And we were hammered first period of the game. We went to the first one that we were drinking. We were particularly pint vodka is that dude did. That was the night you got to to do George Stephanopoulos. George Stephanopoulos can. It was fucking Jeff Gordon. Oh, that's right. You were a good friend.

Speaker 1:          00:05:02       You Go Virginia. I am not letting you drive. You cannot drive it. You know it's going to put, you were so afraid of your wife's taking your head off dude. You are like movie drunk and I said Paul, just lay down here for a couple hours at least get even, I can't let you drive there. Just sit down. Smash cut. My phone's going off. I look at seven Oh nine I was supposed to be an hour north to get my kids and my wife's going whereby I don't even want to get it was, it was, it was bad. You know, where have you been with the phone and then dude, I did. You saw it though. You did. Is He did do is, yeah. You took some mustard off for fastball. I did, yeah. I sent her a cute text. Yeah. Yeah. Put the blame on me.

Speaker 1:          00:05:38       Yeah. I told her I was a good son and my friend help me out. He took muster up for fastball. He had to look out for it. That was like that guy last night when I got into that with that lady in the crowd and we were really getting into that whole debate about the wage gap and then I looked over and I saw the guy she was with their husband or something. I felt so bad. I was like, oh my. I was like, oh I was just like, I heard you say that and I was laughing. Yeah, that's great. I was like, you got to drive home with her and she's going to act like you said it. And I just would say, and I, I tried to take a little, I felt bad for that guy cause he was sitting there and staring at me like, dude, like really?

Speaker 1:          00:06:11       I heard you say, listen, the ride home going to suck. But it's, it's me, not him. He didn't say any of it. That's right. And I said to, it's just to let you know, while I was saying that he was shaking his head going, wow, I don't agree with this. I did what? I could really shake his hand. Now of course he didn't. Right. Well I hope he's not listening to this coffee. Then I was trying to somehow, you know, I felt bad. I felt like I did a Colby Bryan, you know, Shaq does it too. You know what I mean? It's dry. When the fuck am I dragging him enough fucking guys that are scared of their women. It's fucking a disgrace, isn't it? It is. Unless you dating like Rhonda Rousey or somebody would think I would be scared of Ronda Rousey winning respect. I was, what's enough?

Speaker 1:          00:06:48       I was a Ronda Rousey. I'm be like, dude, I gotta get home. Rhonda said, be home by 11 I ain't fucking with the snow due. My buddy interviewed her and she has that thing where she's like, she did that thing where she was like, listen, I eat hot links with extra. She goes, it was great. She goes, I eat hot links with the extra hot sauce and blue cheese. And she goes, and if you're a man and you do ranch and not blue cheese, I'm done with you. She goes chunky blue cheese. And that's what I'm saying. Okay. So then he goes no repetitive back to you to put her in her place. I think it's just, you know, walk in software out to who? Fuck that Pussy Shit. I know she does it, but I'm just saying, you know, we all were guys where you're going to piss her off and you know, it'd be funny, a guy who starts to step up to her and as soon as he sees that fucking neck flare up, he's like, I have kids.

Speaker 1:          00:07:32       So here I going to go through, I wanted to do a bit imitating, like dating her. I just knew my body couldn't take it because I was going to be imitated getting the argument and I was going to flip over the stool. You know like she does the arm bar thing. Joe Rogan was backstage at the comedy store trying to show me how to do it without hurting myself and I'm just like, dude, I'm not going to do this every fucking night. It would be fucking hilarious. And I was going to be in the arm bar, just call real mature.

Speaker 1:          00:08:00       Then when she goes for the chunk of steel, that panic yet when you can't breathe there would have been fucking hilarious, but it was just the level of pain that I was going to have to go through to do it. It might be something I might, I'll wing when now they've kind of said the whole dirty your clothes and shit, but just like, yeah, if she was actually like abusive, just you know what it might be. We fucking brutal. Oh my God. Yeah. She's a tough chick man. She's awesome. I love her fights. I was saying, cause you're a big box and god, you were talking about how guys are actually saying she's the first, let's go home and let's watch the site. The first female, pretty much athlete that I've ever seen. God, the guys are like, we're going home. Look where we're getting the rousy fight.

Speaker 1:          00:08:39       Like that doesn't ever happen before. It never fucking happened before we was that Laila Ali, Leila Ali was like the boxing champion. She was great. She fucking, she kicked the shit out of everybody. But it wasn't like a, like Rousey's just, you know, she just goes in there like fucking like fuck Tom Hardy did in the shit and then to warrior. Remember that? Do you remember that? Do you remember that? Uh, that fight Tyson had, where he knocked that guy out to skinny guy who thinks he looks old now. He looked like he was in that movie carwash. Oh, well Mitch Mitch, Blood Green. He had that fucking Afro Leftover on the 70s. Yeah, right. And he fucking, when he got back up and Tyson came running up, it looked like he was like Dave Parker trying to throw it in from the warning track except what was it? Overhand right. And the guy just kind of like try to turn his head sideways.

Speaker 1:          00:09:25       I saw a fight on ESPN and it's actually on one of those, a great knock out videos on youtube with this woman did this to this to this other woman dude. And I thought she fucking killed her and that was probably the best. Like I actually tried to keep up with whoever that fighter was like I'm gonna Watch this woman fight again. Cause you know I never seen a woman with this kind of punching power until, you know, Rhonda came along like that kind of dominance suit, this big goofy white girl. Right. And she, she just fucking, she hit her, knocked her out. Like it was the full shot cold dude. It was one of those things to grafting and start counting. He was just waving and the girls stood over her, Jesus and, and fucking like pelvic pump or something. That was the only thing.

Speaker 1:          00:10:09       What was that about her, the fight was just like, Yo, you know, you might've killed a man, go easy, go to your neutral corner, standing over doing like she did everything. But you know that then that shit that people do now where you're knocked out in the street and someone takes that cell phone picture like fucking two inches from your face. She did everything but that uh, um, but yeah, there hasn't been, um, it hasn't been anyone like us. So, uh, I dunno. I Dunno how boxing, boxing, boxing stinks. And I used to be, you know me, I used to talk shit about you. US, I'll be the first who, a minute I just talk shit about UFC. I'm like, fuck that. I want to see dudes barefoot. It's just a blood bath. I got to tell you that they, they're already getting, when they were in the guard looked like they were ready to have sex.

Speaker 1:          00:10:45       I'm fucking riveted now by that card to the fights before rousing that night. It was unbelievable. Yeah. Fucking guy's face was just like a fight. It was like a faucet of blood comes out and he's just, a fight is fucking unbelievable. It's if it, oh, there was a couple of great ones, dude. It was blood all over that undercard hell yeah. There was a couple like, I don't know how to fuck you. Dig Heads fucking wide open. I was shy, dude. You when Dude, let me go get stitched up and I'm going to go get my real estate license. Ah, dude. Then the guy's nose was so broken that he still fought with it and then he got hit so hard with it already broken and they had to stop. But it was fucking brutal, man. I don't know. It didn't say, oh, what the fuck are we debating on the way up here where we said it'd be a good podcast.

Speaker 1:          00:11:28       Oh, we can't talk about that. God dammit so much shit. And you just can't talk about me, man. What the fuck are you talking about? Oh yeah, the one thing to the other thing. Yeah. Yeah. It's not buck the land I wanted to buy. I was on the way up there. Yeah, I mean fucking Alaris so we're driving up between Houston and Dallas and this big sign it says 648 or 680 acres.com so I go, I go look up that website. I don't know what is 680 acres cost in Texas. Yup. And uh, it came out to a little more than it was like 3,508 was 3,500 Acre Times 681 which is the accurate number. And it came out to be like a two point $3 million. I'll just highway land land right across the highway. No, it wasn't all the way down. I thought it went in to do, went in a little bit, but there was another highway on the other side, right?

Speaker 1:          00:12:12       35 came on the other side and I'll 35 away over. Oh I don't know how deep it went in, but I was saying like, dude, that's unbelievable and you will live in Paul's analogy. Cause I was just like, dude, if you buy 10 acres in Texas, it's 35 grand, but 10 fucking acres, 600 to seven acres, that's a town. That's a small fucking town. You can be mayor. I want to buy that and start my own fucking town. Right. And you would go in like, uh, no, no, no, no dude. You know, it's what I wanted to fucking highway. I mean, what were you going to do with, you know, my thing is like guys out here in Texas, like Cuban and these fucking billionaires, they know that's out here. They know what's available and it's like for 2.3 which is a drop in the fucking bucket, they're probably like, no, what am I gonna do with that?

Speaker 1:          00:12:54       It's off the interstate. Somebody wants to go to a strip mall. I get a little fucking Dallas, that's all. I'm just going to go on a fucking daily, you know, far away Dallas's for most people. First of all, I'm not acting like I could just afford to do that. I was, I was just trying to see how much land costs out here. Then I was acting like I could afford that. And then he's gone into your logic was, well, Mark Cuban didn't buy it, so it's fucking bullshit. It's like, Mark Cuban didn't buy a lot of shit right now. I know. I didn't know I began, you know, then you got to worry about the environmental people. You got to put up fucking rest stops. I'd rather you know what you do. Here's what you do. You buy a strip mall that's already exists and you put the best stores in there and that's all you gotta.

Speaker 1:          00:13:29       Then you gotta get rid of the old guy with the shoe store. The fuck do you do that? You get to evict people. Uh, you know, you gotta be Harley. He had a right get it to get into commercial real estate. You got to be fucking heartless. Yeah, you do. It was the wood Brown. Oh, here's another argument we got into it. Let's talk about, let's put talking about sports cars now. Phil's argument. Here's your argument. I called you up the other day and we were talking and I go, dude, a fucking, you know, you said due to Ferrari or a Lamborghini, he's just fucking Douchey. That's a jerk off. And I go, it's not, I go, it's fucking gangster. And you go, no, because it looks good in the showroom. No absolute 100% from top to bottom. That is a fucking jerk off car.

Speaker 1:          00:14:12       And I'll tell you why. I've never seen anybody do, listen, my thing, if you take it from the showroom, you drive it home, right? And then for the most part, you just put it on a trailer and you drive it down to the track and you're going around like fucking like Steve McQueen. You coolest shit. But if you fucking drive that thing down the street to the grocery store to get some bananas and pull in right next to a fucking Prius, you're a jerk off. But that's the Prius has guy's fault. No punishing this fucking guy cause he's crushing it. No, the fight. Don't know I'm not. I'm saying what kind of a fucking Paul, you're going to drive this $200,000 card down the fucking street with pot holes and all that shit. The Amish, that suspension just alone. I met front little fucking sin hits the ground.

Speaker 1:          00:14:55       I get it. But Dude, I'm doing fact that someone like me in a Prius can rear end you and then make that face that, Ooh, sorry. Face that you just had 180 grand. I'm telling you Paul, it's a fucking jerk off. I'm telling you right now, dude, if I have $50 million on fucking pulling up in a Lamborghini Diablo to fucking a Carvel, I don't give a fuck who sitting academically as Europe car. Now it's not. I'm not a jerk off. I'm a fuck. Cause you'd be a jerk off enjoying the fruits of my labor. Do it. And this is a thing to pull. You would crash that car because you wouldn't learn how to fucking drive like one hour, one hour, one hour, one hour. You have it wrapped around a fucking tree. Nah, you did a curve. Do these all these videos on youtube. Dude, I'm not, I'm not saying that I could handle that fuck at two to five and got that car.

Speaker 1:          00:15:35       I would take it to a track and I would hire a guy going, dude, teach me how to drive this thing. You can't go from a Camry to something that goes for miles an hour. All right? I think the, you're not going to spin out and let me ask you this. What car is enough for the street where, where is your line get drawn? Where as far as elegant a lot of money. What do you think is not what she would have to be on a Saturday? The Porsche level around the house, anything go beyond like the run the hundred thousand dollars. Do I even think some of those fucking those, those, those 200 day, you gotta look a $200,000 car and you drive down the street, your fucking chair cough. You know, I don't know dude. I just feel like you are earning Shannon. I'm not saying you didn't earn it.

Speaker 1:          00:16:14       I'm not saying he's the guy with the yacht. A journal. If, if every other boats of fishing boat and he's got this fucking thing that he's out. Nobody takes it out in the ocean. He fucking pulls into the south of France. He's got fucking superman. He's not just pulling into car Belk sort of talking about right now. If you get it, you have to get the hard top cause you get the convertible, the convertible's a chicken, 100% agree. You can't have any charitable, yeah, it's a chicken. It's a chip card. Unless you got one of the older ones. The older ones that what? The convertible that are fucking cool. But I like to be tops, but he stops man. He tops. She got all of the skin. I mean it's just, you know, that's like me. Like I see a beer fun. My pasty freckles.

Speaker 1:          00:16:53       I don't even want to do it. I got to go up to it. Yeah. Canyons and Greeks. You get tee tops. It's fucking over. Oh yeah. I love white cars. The older I get, the more Italian. I love what you don't like what? No, I did a bit sane people who drive white cars as scumbags, like cars, like BMW, Mercedes. Oh yeah, they've all dirt on me, Dude. I'm a black car guy. A black is the color. I think blacks are color and give a fuck. People like guy, it gets dirty. Fuck that guy. Man gets a black car. We need a fucking blue green. I mean I get it, but for me it's gotta be black. If I got a Ferrari tomorrow, it's black. You're going to get black and I could get the classic red. Nah, that's chill. That weird fucking Christie Brinkley in fucking Dan, Dan and then a fuck that I, I haven't settled is I love Ferrari's.

Speaker 1:          00:17:39       Obviously. I think they were an absolute fucking work of art, but I think the only two places they look good or in the show room or on the track. Well, what about driving down the street? What about a hold on a second. What a corvette looks like. Not a street car either and it's a fucking rocket. I would, but I put that in the realm of like getting yourself like a Porsche nine 11 or whatever. One of those. Alright. Alright. Yeah, that's about as fun as far as you can go as far as you could go as a vet. Then you'd say, dude, you have buy like a really nice suit and brush up and get you get an a Cadillac. Hey, you're all fucking nerve. You can't even enjoy it. People texting while driving and you're riding down the street and like 300 grand you'd drive and basically their house down the fucking street.

Speaker 1:          00:18:18       Yeah. Somebody is going to hit you. Yeah. Now that you know the, the, I like your point about the potholes to especially like in New York City and stuff like to do it fucking as a reason to drive a Ferrari down a fucking regular street is so people can be like, wow, look at all the money that guy has. That's the only fucking reason you think that though. Do you think some guy's just fucked in the cockpit of those fucking things? If no, tell down to the fucking track. You can go 180 miles an hour. Do when you have a smile on your face. Did that Sunday you'd smile smiling on Thursday to an upward. Three more days, three more days. I'm going to get to do it again. Yes dude. You don't buy a 200 to 200 fucking mile an hour car to get on a highway where the speed limit is 55 it's just fucking stupid. And then on top of that, they snow plowed and all this shit that they didn't fuck the thing up. Some giant 18 wheelers rubber off their fucking dude. I got tires laying in the road. I got to tell you though, there was a guy by me, he's got a white for white or black Ferrari. He drives it on a nice Sunday afternoon around the neighborhood. It's fucking crazy. Let's be amazing. And he gets it up to 40 miles an hour.

Speaker 1:          00:19:21       No, I know, I know, I hear. I hear your point. But I would never punish myself cause everybody else can't afford it. No, you, you're missing the point. I'm not begrudging that somebody has it for the 50th fucking time. I'm just saying put it on a trailer, take it down to the track and really drive the fucking thing, you know? I know, but I'm not fucking waiting. I just want to dry. Want a fucking go out. Why you won't go [inaudible] I want to feel it. Yeah, yeah. Till my wife. Come on sweetheart. Let's go. Fucking lets you know that's, it's stupid. At that point you might as well get a corvette. Save yourself a couple hundred grand because you don't, you're going to be able to drive just as fast. I'd be like, sweet. Do you haven't see those? Do you ever see those videos when they show the Lamborghinis and the Ferrari's driving through the country fucking roads?

Speaker 1:          00:20:01       Yeah, and they're fucking doing like a buck 80 and all that type of shit too. That's for the commercial shoot. I guarantee you they got people out there with leaf blowers and they smooth that hold. It was like in the day when you were, when roller, uh, roller skate wins. Skate boarding first came out and some assholes. Ah, go sweep the drive. I don't want to see because one little fucking level, you see a flying. Yeah, dude, you can't go 180 miles an hour down the street with like tree branches and shit in the fucking wrong. You're going to go, if you're going to die, we've got to find out how many people didn't buy him a year. I want to know that and look at, look at them. I'm not going to name the fucking things, but there was that guy in the MMA, he fucking died in one and there was a guy from all those, uh, fast and furious and those supercars dude.

Speaker 1:          00:20:42       And that was a professional driver driving that Betty hit his stick. Yeah, but here's the thing, dude, you can't be going 130 miles an hour. I don't give a fuck dude. Like, I mean rest their souls and everything, but that's tracking. There was a box at the track. Yeah, but even going that fast at a track, if you're not a fucking qualified to do it like globe do. Could you imagine if somebody gave me a thing of Dominique got to track. It's like talking to a wall here. I said I would buy the fucking thing. I go down to the track and I have somebody teach me how to drive it. Yes. What I would do, I don't know dude. I would just, you'd go out and you go see the next fucking, I'd go out and visible. I would go, I would want one sort of valley it down at the fucking showcase.

Speaker 1:          00:21:16       Cinema Sticky gummy bear hints is work apart. I have total, I think they were absolutely gorgeous. Works of fucking art and dude, it would be like, and to drive it down the street, we'd be like buying the Mona Lisa and hanging it up in a cabana. That is an air condition son getting on it and shit. It's just fucking ridiculous. Uh, yeah. Now my kids would fucking ruined it too. Could you imagine? You know, you drive down the street and they're just paving the road for a couple of days. They have the manhole covers up a little bit higher. Uh, you know, all of a sudden you turned down that street. Uh, yeah. You know, I get it. I get it. Just say it. You're make a point.

Speaker 1:          00:22:01       That's why I love the corvette, because the corvette is the perfect, it's a, it's a fucking supercar, but it's still enough of a street car. You know, it's, these still look stupid. If you go those puddles of fuck you up to an event. Absolutely. Yeah. Apps, the fucking movie, Dude. I mean, you can get into a corvette for like 60 grand, 50 grand, 60 grand. You're in there. He can get a fucking insane one for like 90 or 100. Yeah, Dude. Yeah, that's about it. You can go out there three and a thousand dollar car. I would have sound of that fucking cave in the quarter panel. Yeah, but what, just a sound above, oh, that would be sick. Ah, yeah, but in, in the frost, you wouldn't feel frustration. He could never get out of second gear. I'd be a fucking dope and I get a ticket the first time of the fucking highway I was, as I'm talking right now, you'd fucking peel around a corner and you would go right up on the curb.

Speaker 1:          00:22:50       Fucking oil pan. Plus they pull it up to a comedy club and then on the way home at night, I'd fucking ended up going to a buck 20 getting a ticket. My wife would fucking kill me. I'd get like set 12 points in my life. I always ever doing a one 20 in a Lamborghini or Ferrari and the cop came up like, what's the, what's the right? What do you mean for that Ferrari? What's do you mean dope? Look what I'm driving on the door. What the fuck? He was like, you don't do that and you want car. Every time you turn the lights, you have a call. We'd have the fuck Outta here. Sketch. What are you doing? We need to come down. It's a supercar. Yeah. He caught me sneaking over those chicks and cannonball run. You'd have to fucking hope it's a gay cop unbutton a couple of years fucking button downs.

You're feeling good about the packers?

Speaker 1:          00:31:29       Uh, I I'd say at the NFC is completely weakened. I think that I'm Russell Wilson and you're fucking loud stadium jerk offs. The Seahawks, I feel like they, uh, they're not the same team. The 49 are actually though. They started slow last year. Yeah. I mean they got Sham Canceler Kam Chancellor back at safety, so that's going to help them. But it's still, I don't think they're the same team. San Francisco, 40 niners not the same team. I could tell you my New York football giants, as much as I hate to say it, they're not the same team. Cowboys Lost Romo. That's a huge hit at the time to press the panic button in New York. Uh, not yet. But you know, then we'll see what happens with Dallas Eagles are not shift Kelly and eagles there. Their little fucking plan hasn't worked. The only my guy, Sam Bradford's, my guy, I still believe in him.

So they don't need to pump in all that extra crowd noise. Right. I've got to throw that in. You know, if we're going to get out. I don't, but I don't blame me. Um, but I do it. I thought Andrew Luck was going to be there. Started out real bad this year, dude.

Speaker 1:          00:32:48       So I don't know. And you guys with the fucking shit. I should've known better every time. I think the Patriots are going to, not that I thought they were going to take us, but fucking with that deflate gate. Brady's like fuck you. Seven touchdowns, two games. I mean, it's a joke. It's a fucking joke, dude. Yeah. They'll come up with something. Jim would say, we'll come up with some other ticky tack Horse Shit to say. That's why we beat them by 50 fucking points. Yeah. Yeah. He's a baby. He's, yeah, but let's look what's going to happen. I mean, look at Brady's doing already to having people learn, but it's early having people learn to push a patriots. Yeah, just keep, let them do it. It's great. He's offended. Then they get the US against them. It solidifies the team. It's fantastic. I'll do, one of the funniest things was when you guys, after that fucking spygate when you guys went into buffalo and it was like the night for the guy that was paralyzed.

Speaker 1:          00:33:33       It should, they have them on the big screen to you guys won like 55 to 10 or so. It was so crazy. And they as Bella check, cause he was so defiant after spike, it has check. They're like, why are you going for it on fourth down near the goal line when you're up 21 points. And he goes, you know, it's only three touchdowns. Like he just fucking, he was oh yeah, he doesn't give a fuck dude. Yeah he does. He definitely does not. Well a unfortunately. Dude, we got to wrap this up so fucking quickly. Uh, you've been crushing it, Paul, with the new stuff on stage. No thank you. I mean you'd be at best stuff. You just keep getting better. I appreciate it man. You know, I knowing the level of applause you get before I go. Well, you know, you don't get open or applause.

Speaker 1:          00:34:08       Uh, if I appreciate it man. Well Dude, I have been fortunate enough. Let me make you uncomfortable now. I've been fortunate enough, that's the whole idea. Why a compliment, by the way, by the way, I just got to save. You guys are coming out to Dallas or Toronto bar is full of San Antonio level. They last night I literally was like, how are these people not tired? Judge the fucking act out the new bit with the, I don't know. I get into it. Let people come and see.

Oh No. Yeah, yeah. I'll come home and cook them horns. Thank God the net play at Tcu to see good.

Speaker 1:          00:34:47       Come on. Frogs come out. Frogs. Yeah. And they show up when they dress. Like they were born with silver spoons in their mouths. So immediately they're just annoying. I'm sure the nice piece people, but they fucking were like these blue dress like jr Ewing. Remember that showed Dallas. Yeah. Way Back in the day. Yeah. It's like that minus the hat and they have these dumb shoe. I found the Texas longhorn fans when we went to the red river rivalry. I've found them fine. They were cool when they do the horn thing. I felt way better than Allah. Vans were cool too. Yeah. Alabadle the fans. Clay, the Texas a and m fans who, cool. You didn't like Alabama fans because the kid was in a low for, and then we got into that. I almost got into that fight with that kid. Oh, I can't deal with, I can't deal with that.

Speaker 1:          00:35:25       Uh, that fucking like that Jorge rate. Look at a game. Fuck you. My Dad's the a fucking head of the division and about to fucking chick that jerk, the guy off in a real quick, I don't want, there was a chick and she was at a fucking football game and she will look out for a guy. What happened was her boyfriend went to go get beers in, his guy was sitting there and he kind of put his hand on her leg and she said, I was really creeped out, but I kinda liked it. So she didn't look at them and apparently she jerked him off until he finished. Right when the guy came out, she was never kind of creeped out. She's covering her fucking ass. So she sent a letter kind of game does that other guy has, she said a letter out and she goes, hey, if you know who I am, I was the girl sitting next to you and this and that.

Speaker 1:          00:36:07       And I kind of liked it and I want to and I'm reaching out and like fucking tried to reach out to them. And like, right when the guy fucking busted in his pants, she fucking, the guy boyfriend came back with peers. Could you fucking imagine? Wait a minute. Yeah, dude, did he at least have a winter coat to the people doing, sitting right behind? They don't notice it until I got a bunch of fucking animals at a game. She probably just had the fucking hand. They're doing it. You know what I mean? It's fucking crazy. And she fucking like reached out to the guy. He fucking imagine that. But we're, well, we're lucky. We're lucky.

Speaker 1:          00:36:36       Here's the last thing I'll say. I know we got to go. The one thing that, and this is not against, you know, I mean, I love my wife too, you know, he is hilarious. I sorta got any story about women or anything within two seconds. You just gonna be like, you know, he's actually right now not to do it. Do. That's a great sooner. I love my wife. Okay. I love my dude. Great for what you want to stay. But the fucking thing that irks the shit out of me is where the lucky he sold. Oh my God, what? What are you doing without her? He's so lucky. Won't he do it out or how have I driven? That's I said, how have I driven not going into accidents? How have I not gotten pulled over? How lucky you know what in the back of their heads, the what they're trying to do.

Speaker 1:          00:37:12       Paul, when are they lucky? He's a fucking great guy. They can't do that. Why? Yeah, they can't get no, because we have so many options. Paul, you understand that? Do you understand that when like you know we get later on in life, you get divorced at 50 Paul. Okay. With what you're doing and everything, you got a shot. It's still fucking tagging the 30th 32 Sam, once they hit a certain age, they get ready to, are you going to bang a 50 year old woman? No. And you just went through a Rolodex of famous women uterus sitting there. God, I fucking do this. Yeah. This is how we're wired. I think. I know and I think I even really even know what I just said there, but it sounded really dumb, I think. I just think women, I just think women think men are lucky.

Speaker 1:          00:37:55       I just think they put themselves higher, dude. Sometimes I think it's really fucking selfish. I think you know, it'd be great. When's the last time anybody's wife listening to this podcast right now? When's the last time anybody's wife grabbed your fucking hand look in the eyes and said, you know something? I'm so fucking lucky to have somebody like you. You know what? I'm so lucky. It doesn't, it doesn't fucking happen. No. That usually happens if once you give them the cold shoulder cause you're onto whatever game that they're fucking planes true. Then they come back, they're like cats, same fucking thing. The cat's been all country around the house. She just be conceded that, that thing right back and all of a sudden they're fucking weaving in and out of your legs. It's exact same fucking thing. If you're nice to them, Kimmy. Yeah, but yeah, they just fucking look at you like a piece of shit and I love, I love, I love when you, when people go, what would you do without her?

Speaker 1:          00:38:37       You know what he'd be doing without, you know exactly what I would be living in some studio now. He'd be living at some studio, like a bachelor with a fucking, oh, he'd be awful. You know what he would be do you saved him? What, what would you be doing? What would I be doing? I think, I think I would be smart enough at this age to know not to buy a leather couch cause I hate in the summertime, the sound of the back of your legs getting off of it. You've got to always make sure the acs at a certain level, so it still go with like this type of material for a fucking guy would have that. I would have all the fucking sports packages, right? I build a drum room already know what I do. I think, give me a fucking, why would I do to listen to my wife?

Speaker 1:          00:39:14       My wife would indulge in drinking and smoking and all my hobbies. That's, that's what would be like my wife has been amazing to me and she's fucking great. But I, and she's helped me with a lot of things. Um, I think I would smoke. I think I'd smoke a lot more than I do because I smoke cigars a lot and I'd think I'd smoke more. You had to be smoking life force third. You're an animal. Yeah, Dude. I, I think I smoked for cigars the first two days of the tour. I tried to smoke too with you and the next flight and the next day, dude, I, I felt like I had stood behind a bus. Yeah. I can't believe I smoked one the next day with you just because you were doing it. I was like, dude, I didn't even enjoy it. No. I think my wife has definitely made me calm down with some things.

Speaker 1:          00:39:51       I would drink a lot more. I'd probably be a lie. I'd probably be out of shape more. I mean, I'm not in great shape, but I think if I was alone, you know, it was hilarious. We went too hard. Uh, like we always do the first couple of days, now we were supposed to go to a movie on a relaxing day off and we go, you know what, let's go get Tex Mex for lunch and we'll just have a 10 hour elbow seat, black matte, and then we'll go see black mass smash cut two hours later. You know, I did the movie. I know, fuck the movie. We're doing shots at Don Julio fucking Tequila and were drinking all fucking night. You sitting at a sports bar and they had like, they had baseball on the Yankee game was on, they had some soccer on the name of the replay and then they had this just like fails like youtube fail.

Speaker 1:          00:40:29       People fall into choices and shit. And I was just the first part, I'm going to leave this to go see a movie. Oh yeah, we've got those tacos. I'm still going to go see black mass without a doubt. But I mean I'm, yeah, and I want to see, I want to see it too. It's been good. But we were good last night. We were gonna let you know. The funny thing about you last night where like I don't give a fuck what anybody says, dude, I'm going home. Listen, I don't care. You know, if you want to go. And I was like, no, I'm with you too dude. I'm tired too. And then all of a sudden in between shows, she just got you. Just give me that look and I know you're gonna you know what that means. And they got and he goes, Oh boy, second wind.

Speaker 1:          00:40:56       Oh yeah, no. Once I go out and have a good show and I feel great, I want you want to go out and you have a couple of parts. Well fortunately, and unfortunately I got a lot of friends here in Dallas, so I don't know how good I'm going to be tonight, but I will tell you this, when a, once I get to this one, when I get off the road, uh, I gotta get back on it because, cause what, some students took me three months to get in shape and I sorta got fucking three weeks. I'll give it all back. So I got to make sure Jesus Christ what the are in here. Well thank you for having me. Yes, no worries Paul versus these albums tomorrow drops tomorrow. I had to stand now available on iTunes and a band camp and a soon to be on Amazon and Spotify and thank you to all things records for doing the right thing, all things comedy. But the record label is all things record, so thank you. Prerecorded life, Paul Verses. All right, let's see.

Speaker 3:          00:42:17       Um, this is what I did this week. People, I came home and uh, I don't know what the fuck I was supposed to do, but I walked into my bathroom and I saw that I had a leaky faucet immediately I got excited because I was like, oh my God. I was like, oh my God, there is a problem. All right, this is a problem and I know how to fix it. I know how to fix that motherfucker. All I do is I unscrew that little thing that the faucet handle pops right off and then right underneath it set thing that looks like a fucking spark plug. Right? Pull that thing out, this little Washer, you take it out, you stick a new one in Bam. And you reverse the process. I've done it, I've done it like five times since I've been in this apartment. And by five I probably mean to, but we're going to say five.

Speaker 2:          00:43:08       Okay.

Speaker 3:          00:43:08       Reality was probably too, but I feel like I've done it like five times. So I walk in there, bring in my little toolbox, like a fair, I bring in and that little red one little fire engine, red toolbox. And I come walking in, you know, looking like the puppet that I look like and I open it up, right? Grab my Allen wrenches, unscrew that little fucking thing. And here I am. It took the screw up. I did everything right. I put the towel right up, down in the sink, right over the, uh, the drain mouth, so I wouldn't lose it down there. I put the screw white where I knew it was going to be right in the little area where I brushed my teeth. Everything's going well so far. All systems go.

Speaker 3:          00:43:50       So I unscrew the fucking thing right? Everything's good. And I go to take the handle off. Lo and behold, it won't come off. Seems a little fussy. So I, I start jiggling it a little bit. I started tugging at it. I go, wait a minute, Bill, wait a minute, let's not break anything and turn this easy. Repair into something bigger. So what do I do? I go on to youtube already getting embarrassed going, I already know how to fix this fucking thing. I was going to show off that I know how to do this. So my girl could be like, oh my God, you're so, you're funny and you're handy, right? And it would just fill up my ego. So I go on the fucking youtube how to a leaky faucet. And every motherfucker on there, they're on scrolling a little screw. The handled pops right off and they're onto the job. So I'm like, son of a bitch, maybe there's some sort of a gunk in there. So I started tugging it a little fucking harder. And in the back of my head, it keeps going. Don't do this, it's going to break. Don't do this.

Speaker 3:          00:44:52       I start looking at it going, did I, did I take a wrench out or was there something else I had to fucking unscrew it. I just can't figure it out. And finally what happens? I lose my temper and I go, I'm yanking this mother fucker rough, right? What happens? Snap the God damn handle. Snap the fucking thing off. Like halfway down, part of the threads are in there. It's this old vintage fucking faucet handle. So I had this simple God damn job. Oh, halfway through. I called my fucking dad to death to figure out how to do it and I was already pissed. Which is funny. Isn't that funny? When he calls somebody at midway through a job, you know, he's just hanging out. He's a psycho. Hello Mike. Yet bill, I'm trying to fix the fucking faucet and he's just like Jesus. Easy, easy. You know, you just hit the ground running, screaming at him. Oh I, you know what you want to do? Their bill is, yeah, you want to, why you want to unscrew? And I'm like, I fucking did that already. I already did that. I tried to do it. When he go out and jiggle it, I jiggled it,

Speaker 3:          00:45:58       you know? And I yelled at him so much, he started getting mad and he's like, well, fucking call a plumber. I'm like, I'm not going to fucking call a plumber. I'm a goddamn leaky fucking faucet. And he was like, well, I don't know what to tell you. I said, fine, I'll call you later. He goes, all right, goodbye. You know? So that was the upside of it. I got a little father, son, quality time, quality time in there. So what do I do? I say, fuck this. I got gotta, I got a God damn screwdriver and trying to force the whole time I'm going one step that I miss. What did I do? Did I just push this up here? Sorry about that. I'm like, what's step that I just fucking miss? So as you know, was always my temper does mean, and what do I do?

Speaker 3:          00:46:39       I fucking Yank this thing off. It snaps off and now I still have a leaky faucet and I have half a God damn handle. So, of course, you know, the male ego, I can't say anything to my girl, right? I just fucking walk out, head down to feet. I look, you know what I look like. I look like fucking Peyton manning in the third quarter of a playoff game. I got that Peyton face, you know, I ended my chin strap and I'm already looking for somebody to throw her under the bus to blame it on, right. I start blaming my landlord because he likes everything all fucking old rather than just, you know, putting the blame on my shoulders and being a fucking leader. So like I said, I walk out of there. That's the only thing I was missing was a Peyton Manning Jersey. As I walk out my stupid sweaty forehead and I just walk out and I wait for Nia to it, right?

Speaker 3:          00:47:31       And she comes in and she knows I've been flipping out. She heard me yell at my dad about a Washer, you know, stupid fuck another three minutes of my life, I'll never get back because of my dumb ass temper. And uh, she goes in and immediately comes out. She's like, what happened to the sink was are you like, are you halfway through the job? Nope. It's done sweetie. Still leaks and now there's half a handle. Anything else you need me to go take care of? Here I am the man about the house. So, um, anyways, so I've gone on, I've gone on Ebay, I've gone everywhere. I'm trying to find, it's not a really unique, a faucet handle. It's just an older one. And out of respect for the guy who owns this place, I want to get a new one. Does anybody, any podcast listener and my loss and in the Los Angeles area know where I can find?

Speaker 3:          00:48:28       Do they have all the Zeros? Is there a Fred Sanford House out here that just so I have a bunch of old faucet handles? That's what I need to know. Uh, I have pictures of my damaged faucet handle up on the, uh, the MLM, podcast.com, the official fan page of the Monday morning podcast. And once again, it's www.themmpodcast.com. People seem to be having problems sometimes finding it and uh, anybody out there that knows how to fucking do it. If you could look at it and tell me where I went wrong, even took a picture of the goddamn screw where I unscrewed it. What else would be holding it in? I don't understand it. Obviously you don't understand it, Bill. You fucking broke it. So, uh, I'm embarrassed. I'm embarrassed. It's one of the first things I learned how to do and plumbing and I was beyond excited.

Speaker 3:          00:49:17       I probably talked about it three years ago on the podcast. For those of you searching in the archives, um, I don't want to have this, this is a lot, but what kills me about that is that is a microcosm of my life. It's like there's an obstacle. I learned how to defeat it and then I walk away and I completely forget everything that I've learned. And then fucking six months later, I'm in the same situation. I lose my temper and the thing blows up in my face. And uh, you know, I'm 43 years old. So who's kidding who, when did you say I'm beyond the halfway point in my life? You've got to think that. I mean, 86 years, you know, that's long enough for a curse. Everybody. Um, I think I'm going to make it into my nineties that I want to hear everybody talking about my temper and how it's causing high blood pressure. Go Fuck Yourself. I go for hikes. That's how I even the salary level it off.

Speaker 4:          00:50:46       Yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:51:01       We've got, oh, let's do it. One one up. Why don't we do the rest of the youtube videos for this week. We got some great ones. That will be@themmpodcast.com. Please remember to type in the, we'll have all these youtube videos right there for you so you can just sit there surfing the net. All right. This is a great one. Texas man gets a $330,000 home for $16. This, this is one of the greatest stories I've ever seen. This guy found a loophole. Basically, the guy who owned the house declared bankruptcy. He took off. Then the bank had it and I can't remember. I only watched the video once. There's something about this, this loophole in Texas where if a house is abandoned for a certain period of time, you can file this form. It costs 16 bucks and you can claim the house. And this is what this guy did, right?

Speaker 3:          00:51:59       It gets better. Everybody on the block is pissed because they paid like 330 $350,000 for their fucking houses. Houses, sorry. At this guy comes in, he pays $16 for a house. So it brings the value of their house down. So they want him out of there. Not only for that reason, but I'm also guessing cause it's a black dude and they're all white. Just I'm telling you, it's like when I watched this, I'm like, this is the greatest beginning. It's like a pilot episode for the greatest fucking Sitcom ever. Like the amount of characters that you could have. It's a fucking TV show. So basically what this guy has to do, he has to stay there for three years and and that the people on the, you got to watch this video that his neighbors that trying to get them for everything, they're like, well we just think he should pay for his house like everybody else.

Speaker 3:          00:52:54       It's like, you know what? What? What sort of a team player are you? Just because what you signed yourself into indentured servitude to these piece of shit bankers. One Guy, one guy gets out of it. It doesn't have to become a fucking slave to these assholes and you can't be happy for him because he found a loophole because he did his homework. If you read a body, you could have owned two houses, you could have sold your house and then moved into the other one for 16 bucks. Quit hating on the guy. I think it's the greatest thing ever considering these backers took this bailout money. They don't eat. They don't, not only do they not know where, they don't know where it is, the can't say where it is or who even got it. And the, the breaking this guys, that was like a billion trillion fucking dollars would have this guy 330 grand. You're mad at that guy. He's a fucking genius. You know what I would do if I lived on that block? I would give that guy a fucking Goddamn, I don't know what I would make them a Bundt cake. Whatever the fuck you supposed to do, I'd welcome them to the neighborhood.

Speaker 2:          00:54:00       Okay.

Speaker 3:          00:54:01       Aye. Aye. And I'd be like, listen to, can you do me a favor? Can you read some more documents? And if you come up with some other shit, I would love if you could find a loophole that somehow affects my life. Like, like there's the, the totally overlooking this guy's talent. You know, you know what's funny about that guy, that black dude and moved into that thing. If he was actually on TV screaming about how I bought a house for $60 half the people on the fucking street would call the one 800 number in order his God damn book. You know? And then if it turns out to be a scam,

Speaker 2:          00:54:41       okay,

Speaker 3:          00:54:41       you'll never see the guy again, right? The guy is on your block. He's right there. Go over it.

Speaker 4:          00:54:47       Learn from them. All right, here we go.

Speaker 3:          00:55:15       Hey, Bill. I met with this girl for a year and a half. We broke up for about a month recently, and this month she dated another guy from April to May. This. Okay. That's plenty of time. Um, to do the deed. Sometime around the beginning of May, she started texting me and calling, begging for me back. She told me she didn't want, she didn't do anything with this other and she wasn't thinking when she said Yes to going out with them. Also, she told me in this month of being together that they didn't do anything sexually. All Jesus, he said that himself. I like how this man thinks. Uh, we've been back together for about a month now and we recently have signed a one year lease on an apartment together. Oh Gosh. Uh, about a week ago she told me that she did have sex with this other guy multiple times. Oh, Jj says this. I'm just reading word for word what he wrote here and she thinks she may have gotten an STD from him, so that's the only reason why she came clean.

Speaker 3:          00:56:20       Oh Jesus did I mention that me and her are 19 and the other guy is 32 you know, dude, you're 19 I can see how this happened to you. She failed to mention this to me too and failed to mention that she thinks she has an STD before we had sex multiple times. Bear back when we got back together. I don't know what to do. I'm stuck in a one year lease with a whore and I might have an STD. What do I do? Sorry. This is long. This is what you do. You stop having sex with that woman immediately. You and your relationship with her immediately you go out and you get tested immediately. I bet you don't even have it. I bet you don't. Okay. If you've got herpes, it's going to show up. Right? I'm going to shut the fuck up because I don't really know too much.

Speaker 3:          00:57:08       If you got gonorrhea or you got syphilis, it's you have, you have fucking urines going to hurt. Something's going to happen. All right. Um, I think what happened was she got back together with you and then somewhere she lied saying that, um, she didn't have sex with this guy and then all of a sudden she, something happened. Did you got HPV? I Dunno. What the fuck something award a soar. Something popped up and she said, Holy Shit. She went to the doctor and found out she got an STD. All right. So now she has to fucking tell you. Okay. Because, uh, Jesus Christ, this is such a fucking mess. This is such a mess because you know what this girl is, she's too young to be, to be like, uh,

Speaker 3:          00:58:00       she's afraid to be alone. The second you break up, she goes out with somebody else and not just goes out and bang somebody. She goes out and has like a fucking relationship with this guy. All right? Then immediately runs back to you and then signed a one year lease so she can fucking feel safe. And now she's with you. And now she drops this bomb on you. This is what you do. I don't know if he can get out of the lease. Is your landlord a guy? If he is, have a face to face with them after you get tested and tell him that. And maybe you'll luck out and just say, dude, can you do me a solid? Can you do me a solid? The very least, if you can't let me out, can you let her out? I don't want to live with this girl for the love of God. Maybe you can get out that way. If not, you know, I say you walk, do get yourself tested. You know, get yourself tested and then fucking walk. All right? But this is such a fucking harsh lesson to learn. You just don't have unprotected sex. You just don't.

Speaker 2:          00:59:11       Okay.

Speaker 3:          00:59:12       You just don't and you don't sleep with. I know you didn't know she was a whore, but just in general, you just don't fucking do it. You just do it.

Speaker 3:          00:59:22       Just don't do it. All right? Just, just don't do it. All right. That's a fucking horrific story. I hope it works out good for you. Um, you saying you might have an STD, so I'm guessing you're doing the typical guy thing where you're not going to the doctor immediately. Go to the doctor, get yourself tested. All right, drop to your knees and thank God when it comes back negative, which is what I'm thinking it's going to happen and everybody on the podcast, how about we all say a collective prayer? All Jesus for this kid. All right, let it come back negative. Let it come back clean dude, and just get on with your fucking life. All right? Please tell me this. Horror is paying rent. Jesus Christ. I mean Jesus Christ. Jesus Christ. Then you got to [inaudible]. Now you're gonna have to fucking break up with her and then you'll live in in the same place. Oh my God. What a nightmare. Then he got to meet other girls.

Speaker 3:          01:00:19       Fuck that dude. It's only a year. Your Life. You're only 19. Jesus Christ. A lot more worse things can happen. All right, I'm sending you positive vibes. It's coming back. Negatives, have a fucking talk with, with the least guy. Tell him you're fucking shovel his driveway every time it snows until 2018 or something. Just let me Outta here. I gotta get Outta here. I gotta get Outta here. All right, please. For the love of God, let me out and uh, and, and have at it with her, but whatever you do, wear a condom. All right. Good luck to you, sir.
