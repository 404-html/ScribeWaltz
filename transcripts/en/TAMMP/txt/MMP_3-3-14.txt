Speaker 1:          00:00:01       Hey, what's going on? It's bill burr and this is the Monday morning podcast for Monday match third 2014. I am recording. I'm recording live as I always do. Um, live to tape here. Live to digital, whatever the fuck it is. I'm here in Toronto, Ontario. And that person yawning in the background like a fucking old man. I was his New Jersey. The Pride of New Jersey, Paul Versey. What's going on brother? That's up math. It's going on. How are you enjoying, uh, how will you join enjoying a so well, you know dude, the food right? We were talking about the food here has been, whenever you heard me say, I got to tell you, put New York aside. Cause you know, I'm a big New York food guy. I mean the food here has been knocking out of the Park Mattson been incredible. Yeah. And Moncton and a in Halifax. We uh, one of them was that, that Ale house place.

Speaker 1:          00:00:59       Um, oh, the first place we went to the pelvic triangle triangle. Yeah. Yeah. We went over there for lunch. Well, first of all, let's just back up for a second. One thing I did want to bring up was what's been fucking hilarious is Paul Versey going through Canada, eastern fucking Canada. We're literally, we're driving to Moncton and Halifax. I've never seen this in my life. Like instead of a school crossing, they literally had that same yellow sign with the fucking Moose on it. Yeah, I've never seen that. Okay, so typical Paul Versey typical fucking New Yorker. You just go places and that never done this guy has been trying to order an Arnold Palmer everywhere we've gone. Yeah. And what's funny is you've gone from saying confidently, can I have an Arnold Palmer to now you're just describing the ingredients. It just does stare. They started off like, can I get an Arnold Palmer?

Speaker 1:          00:01:57       And they would be like, what? And He'd be like, I did that. And it'd be like an Arnold Palmer. I'm sorry, I don't know. You know a ice tea lemonade, Arnold Palmer. And they're like, no we don't. I have that. You got to an ice tea. No, we don't have that either. So then the next time you ordered it, um, they're like, oh, what do you want for this? And then we go to Halifax and you ordered it this way. You Go, yeah, you got Arnold Palmer, you know. Oh, well Palmer. So I was squinting my eyes like to yet lemonade thing. You did that and then downstairs in Toronto you just go, yeah. I was wondering, um, do you have lemonade and ice tea? And you could maybe put those together and they're like, yeah, no, no, we don't. We don't know. I, I'm, I'm over three.

Speaker 1:          00:02:43       I'm all for three with the, all of the power. So if you know that as I do, why don't you order a stand? Makita has probably some sort of fucking drink up here and they absolutely, of course we do. Yeah. I'm just, I give up. It's just going to be lemonade or ice tea from now. I just fucking hilarious. You have ordered everywhere the first time when you said, do you have an Arnold Palmer? They like, well, yeah, yeah, mostly lemonade and then just a splash of ice tea. And I'm like, all right, you hang out with law ahead. Cause that's how law had, well he gets more lemonade too. Yeah, that's actually, that's the one knock I'll give Canada. That's the food's been great, but not having lemonade. It's unacceptable. Fucking a letting and not have lemonade because it's sub zero up here. That's like some, some summertime shit.

Speaker 1:          00:03:25       Oh, lemonade lemonade's year round lemonade. It's incredible. I'm not saying it's not good fall. Yeah. With the first lady. Did you see your face when you, do you have stock in the lemonade? Do you like, but lemonade is year round. Let me make wonderful kid up the kid in a hell no. The, the, the girl in mocked and I go, can I get an Arnold Palmer? And she lived, she froze up and she goes, UN UN Arnold. And that's when I realized, dude, you're out of the country, man. You got to, yeah. And then you kinda just smirked and put your head down. [inaudible] I knew you were like, this is going to be a disaster. Like they don't even golf up here. They don't have golf up here. If you notice there's no golf courses. Yeah, I guess it was a little crazy hilarious. We drove by one the other day.

Speaker 1:          00:04:03       People golf up here like they know who tiger woods. No they do. But it's just funny that I use an American golfer as a drink thinking that some kid and in a waitress would know and an American golfer from like the 60s, that would be like somebody from Canada go into like South Carolina in ordering a rocket. We showered 19 year old Canadian waitress. Oh I bought the little stuck up. Ah Shit. Get the fucking airport this morning in Halifax had in like the one, the one jerk we've met in Canada. How nice to the people in eastern Kansas. It's, it's beyond are unbelievable. They're over the top. Nice. Uh, they've been great and I agree with you. You know what you said something and I didn't say it cause I thought you were going to be like, you know, fucking Versie complaining, but she, you know, I, I you ordered a juice and then I ordered one and I asked, how's the root beer?

Speaker 1:          00:04:49       I mean, how's the ginger one member? I go, how's the Ginger Hammer? And she just Kinda just goes, she goes, she's looked at me, Derek. She goes, I don't like ginger, so you know, I don't like it, but if you like Jennifer and I was out right then I was out when she said that. Yeah, no, she didn't. She went and immediately detects thing and I just started thinking, oh, she must ain't even see your text. Uh, she wasn't at one point. She's one of those board hot chicks. She's working at the fucking airport. She's done. Yeah, it's over. She looks in the mirror, she goes, I'm better than this, but I can't figure out a way out yet, you know? Yeah. I mean, there's gotta be addicted, jump on or or, or something. Right. She's probably going to, what? She's probably going to start fucking stripping out there in eastern Canada. What's a good name for a titty bar? And he's can Canada Caribou, clam shack, whatever.

Speaker 1:          00:05:40       But dude, it was, you will fucking hilarious when we go. Well, we first, first of all, I flew into, I flew into a Halifax Moncton first night, Moncton, um, which is Mon C. T. O. N. I finally can fucking spell it. I hope I did it right though. From La, right? Yeah. And this fucking, you want to talk about having tourettes I land in Montreal. All right. And I don't know if I mentioned it last week, but I actually brought my hockey stuff. I brought my hockey bag with my fucking funny, my book, because I set up a bunch of ammo. I tweeted that I was, I wanted to play when I was up here. So all these people, you know, come here, play, come here, play. And everybody's going, hey, I got stuff you can use stuff. Don't worry. We'll buy it. We'll buy you a new Jaque. And I'm like, that's fucking disgusting.

Speaker 1:          00:06:31       I'm going to lug my shit up here. Right? So I'm thinking all you gotta worry about is I'm going to drag it out of the car at lax as stick it on one of those little fucking $2 things, right. Wheel it to some guy. He takes it and then I'm done. And then when I land in Moncton, I just fucking throw it on another one. It's, it's not going to be that big a deal. It's, it's annoying, but it's not that big a fucking deal. So what happens? I get to Montreal, right? There's no cart anywhere. I'm fucking, I got the hockey bag on top of my wheelie bag and I got my computer shift all my mixer and the podcasts looking like a complete asshole and in Montreal, right? Oh No, no way in Montreal. The switch you have to do. I figured I, I'd, you know, I'd land in Montreal.

Speaker 1:          00:07:13       I go through customs and then I jump on a fucking plane. You got to claim your fucking bags. Uh, I dunno why. I was like, I guess it's like, do you think I assembled a fucking bomb when I was on the plane? So I had a claim, both those two asshole bags then drag them back over to someplace else. Right, and that part wasn't too bad. That's still sucks. No, it's that. No, but then I got back upstairs. I had to go back through security again. It's like, did I assemble a fucking gun on the plane? Now he, they admitted that to me there that, it's funny you said that because I said when I had the connection, because I flew from New York to Montreal and Montreal and I said to the guy who I don't have to go. He goes and I said he was really cool to teach the the, I guess Tsa, I don't know.

Speaker 1:          00:07:54       But he goes, he goes, yeah. He goes, our systems kind of screwed up here that we don't have it right here yet. That's what he said. Oh. He said, no. He said that. He was like, and I was like, Oh yeah, cause it doesn't matter. What am I going to do from, from the Tsa guy was cool with me too. When I went there, I actually had the paperwork. What are you doing up here? I go, I'm doing stand up. And he goes, yeah, the paper and gave it to him. He goes, he just goes, great. I wish everybody was like this cause I'm doing just for laughs. Suggest for lapse is like the comedy thing of his. So they know exactly what you're supposed to have. So it was so nice to come to this country and not lie. Cause I always lie when I get it.

Speaker 1:          00:08:24       What are you doing here? I'm visiting friends. Yeah. Where do they live? Near the stadium I got. So I always do that because I don't want to deal with, cause I, you know, I never have the right paperwork that happened to me when I was fucking going into Scotland. I downloaded everything and God knows, you know, I'm fucking it up, but I'm blaming my, my reps, you guys didn't show me the right stuff. Yeah, we did. We sent it three times. So I always lie when I go into a country, I'd just say I'm visiting friends. It's weird when you're by yourself, but if you say you're visiting friends, um, and then they go, where do they live? And all you need is a fucking address. But I had that backfire because I came up with a comic. I would, I came up to do the comedy nest up there.

Speaker 1:          00:09:04       Jim Bo's room and uh, you know, I probably should mention as an act, it's fine. It's this rule man. It don't matter if they're going to see the warm socks, right? No, it's a great room. It's actually when you did a festival, you work out there and stuff. But uh, we went there, we went there to me, what a host. We went there and uh, we went there and they go, what are you doing here? And a comic. I'm with ghost. You just, just let me, I'll just, you know, we're telling you all have visited friends for the weekend and they go, yeah, all right. Just wait here. Came back, got the websites online, saw that we were working at the club and you're fucking, how did they sat that called him and said, next time you're not getting it. Don't lie. Figure that out. Typed in the name bullshit.

Speaker 1:          00:09:45       Well, I swear to God, why don't you guys said it's not just oh, typed and typed in the name and then saw it and goes, Huh. That's pretty all you know, because anytime it's so fucking annoying, can't get away with anything anymore. I mean, Jesus Christ back in the day you had to do some Peter Falk Shit, but I gotta just tell you, listen to this and I just not adding up for a second. Do you mind just standing? I mean, I might be crazy, but they did it. It's something, they look at your shoes and they could figure it out. You will fucking line. And now they just say they have the answers to the test. Paul, we're coming to your country and enjoy ourselves. You know that went the fuck. It's like, you know, Hey Paul, God forbid you come to Canada and they don't squeeze a couple of Nicola.

Speaker 1:          00:10:20       You know what? Fuck these people thought I was having a good time. You know why I'm bringing my American when I was just, you're lucky you bringing my dick jokes up to your fucking frozen Tundra. So anyways, so I land the night before, um, land the night before anyways, and uh, in Moncton. And then the next day, uh, a buddy of mine that I met at the Mario Lemieux things, uh, camp said, if you have a fucking come up here, I'll, you know, I'll take you out. And uh, went up and played the middle of the day. Dude, I've never done that on the road. Played, played a pickup game, a hockey, right. Right. In a course I was, I was such a fucking nonfactor in the game as I always am. I can skate. Okay, now you could skate. Good man. I could skate good compared to you, but I'm not compared to a fucking Canadian.

Speaker 1:          00:11:08       I can't, no, dude, I you, you're fucking, I got to just talk. I don't want it. Let me, let me finish real quick, just real quick just to tell the people listening. So I was such a nonfactor second to last, you know, time I'm out on the ice. I actually blocked the shot just so I would somehow have some positive thing in one shift and I took it right off the toe. Dude, you showed you my toe. I'm going to put a post, a picture of it by my hotel was purple. Now part of that's because I'm a redhead and I got an alabaster feet here so it really shows up with your Greek skin. I don't think you'd notice it as much, but dude, it's like, like they should for in medical school, like if they ever just want to show like, you know what do call it, a contusion or a bruise, whatever the fuck they want to call.

Speaker 1:          00:11:56       They should punch a redhead because all the detailed comes out man. Well, no, you're pale white. So when you were like, I got to show you the tow yesterday house, he's like, let me first, let me just, I'll, I'll look at it but let me eat. But uh, no, I just, I can, horrific brass. Wanted to tell your listeners that the size of bills hockey bag is so funny that like you travel with this, you know, we're, we're out here. Hockey bags are just in general, a gigantic, you have that. Like you brought the equipment like you care that much. And I love that. I love that. Cause you got to do it to have fun. I mean no, this is a thing too. I have the number, some old school podcast listeners. Remember I used to advertise skate fenders on my, Oh, is that right on my podcast.

Speaker 1:          00:12:41       And as he's, you know, it's one of the few places you don't have protection if you get hit by the fucking puck. Um, if you were in the whole bird cage thing is, is on your feet. And this guy did a study where like all these, like how many manpower games, you know, um, how much manpower you lost per game in the Nhl due to foot injuries and people getting hit with the puck. So we came up with these things, scape fenders and uh, they basically fit right on the side of the plastic thing. And I just, I brought him and I psyched myself up going, I don't give a fuck. I'm a comedian. I can't be limping around on stage. I'm not trying to get anywhere in this sport and just having fun. I'm wearing these things. And I got there and I fucking gave into peer pressure.

Speaker 1:          00:13:20       I'm like, nobody else has them on. I've never even seen anybody with, I guess some people in the Nhl where him, so I don't, where the fuck are things? I've never taken a shot like that off my foot ever. Did it hurt when it happened or did it hurt after? Like it was weird. It hurt like hell and then all of a sudden it felt really warm and it actually felt kind of good. Yeah, I finished my shift and then I fucking sat down and then I was thinking like, is this thing going to make me limp? Fortunately I haven't went, but uh, you know, my, I could bend it and everything. It's fine. It's just, it's Barney the dinosaur. Purple Gross. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. That's fucking bad. So I wouldn't have worn them either. I would have done what you did if I saw nobody with the guards. I'm, I'm not put this fucking box analysis. Yeah. And then on top of that I was in another country, so it's like, oh these, it was pussy Americans. They fucking come up dead dress like Lindy rough.

Speaker 1:          00:14:09       Um, that's funny man. Hang on a second. I actually for should have said fucking off Samuelson. He used to wear the most fucking peds. I just remember long time ago Fred Cusack. So we gave Lindy referred cheap shot and on the Bruins and it's an even, it was such a fucking cheap shot that even the color commentator had to be like, wow, you know, that was kind of cheap. And then Frey Cusick goes, well you have to hit him. He's so well protected. So anyways, we're up here and I'm trying to see how much time we're doing cause I got to know when to fucking read. Yeah. I got to read a little bit advertising here. Um, well when, when, when we come back from the advertising, I'm going to talk to a, we're going to talk about Paul Versey actually bought a pair of skates up here. Uh Oh yeah. All right. Hang on a second. Hang on, hang on, hang

Speaker 1:          00:19:06       Oh. So anyways, hey, I got, I got to do it. I called it this week. Oh yeah. What was it say going to mean Shit to you? Cause it's not sports, but it's a different thing. It was a drummer. I've been telling people for years to watch this guy, Mike Johnson's, uh, Mike johnston.com Mike's lessons.com. Sorry. Um, his drum lessons. He was just, he was the best guy right out of the gate when Youtube started. He just immediately had the best, like most informative, explained it the best, played the best as far as the instructors. The guy was just head and shoulders above everybody. And I've been telling people to go to this guy's, you know, website and sign up for his lessons and all that. And this month he's on the cover. Oh, modern drummer magazine. They've never had, they've never had a drum instructor on the cover.

Speaker 1:          00:19:50       That's a good camp. I called it ever that you go look at that Paul. It's not just with sports. That's a good dude. I called it and is even better. So I get the issue and I, uh, you know, I, I of course, you know, opened it to read the whole article on it. And as I'm going through, I see this other article and I'm looking at this guy's face go, and I know that fucking guy. Who was that? And it was sandy genero now sandy genero taught at the, uh, he's laughing about something else he taught at or it's still teaches at the drummer collective. And I took lessons for him like 10 years ago. Big Time Yankee Fan. I was taking lessons with them. My Oldest Sandy Gennaro would you say? I Dunno, I dunno how old he is, Paul. You don't do that in show business.

Speaker 1:          00:20:28       He looks phenomenal and he plays even better. He's a great guy, despite the fact that he's a Yankee Fan. So I used to take lessons from him this not long ago. It was like I was taking lessons with them with Don Zimmer tried to attack Pedro Martinez and he grabbed fucking dawn by his head and just use this momentum. The ground. He did not push that man. That's still fucking, that's still a little, what was his, what was he supposed to do? Paul? Just step out of the way, you know, and then what guy by his head and then what he puts, she pushed him down on the nice soft grass. Did you ever see that grass, that grass at Fenway park is a blend of Kentucky blue grass. What would you have? Argentina. Green. What would you have done if Paul Zimmer, we'll, I'll, I'll do, I'll do the bit that I was doing back in the day and I used to do this in New York and it would kill front of Yankee fans.

Speaker 1:          00:21:18       All right. I'll say, Oh man, you see what Pedro did to Don Zimmer and that'd be a Booboo, and I was, I would say that it was a red sox fan and this is how I explained it. I said, look, went don Zimmer ran at him. He had three options, either one runaway and then he's the pussy that ran away from an 80 year old man to punch the guy in the face, which you're not going to do that because then you punched an old guy or three, grab him by his Macy, Dave head and just sorta guide them down to the ground. You saw him afterwards. Yeah, on simmer was crying saying he shouldn't have done it. He lost his composure. Now he did lose his composure. That was, he looked like a of old bulldog. If you took his chew toy. Yeah, that was bad.

Speaker 1:          00:22:07       You know what the whole thing was bad because Don Zimmer, he's basically, you know from the top of his head to his toes, his baseball. Did he get, he got married. How cool is his wife? Like he got married like at a baseball park. Like they were walking like all the players were standing there with bats making like an arch and he would walk in underneath it. So that was the bad thing. But you know his legacy after that many years though is the Pedro Martinez. It is. It's throwing. No, but they've, I mean they talk about it. You can't let it Don Zimmer without thinking that I do. Cause he also, he coached us, he played on the bumps that want it and 55 you know, Paul's, you know your history. I don't know if you know your sports history. You always give me shit. Well, I was born in 68 how the fuck would I not, how would I know the 55 Brooklyn Dodgers?

Speaker 1:          00:22:55       How would I know that? I, you know, I'm one of those guys that I guess I just cared after. I just cared when I was able to watch selfish. Yeah. Anyways, so I read through and I see Sandy Gennaro. I'm like, Holy Shit, this is the guy I used to take lessons with. He's such a great guy. He's the first guy that showed me a technique to try to do some of that. Those bottom triplets. Just a fucking great guy. Um, journeymen drummer, who's, he's played with everybody. He's fucking play with every, his first group he started off with the lead singer was Michael Bolton. It was like a rock group. I forget what they words wisely. Yeah. They got some of their videos up there and, uh, and then he became like a hired gun, uh, pat Travers band. Cindy Lopper, the monkeys, like all that pops. He's done.

Speaker 1:          00:23:42       Pat Benatar was a Pat Benatar, Joan Jett. I can't remember. He's got a bunch of great stories or whatever. So, um, so anyways, so I'm like, Oh, Fuck Sandy. Gennaro. I gotta, I gotta watch some of his videos. So I look it up and I find this fucking video that I sent you. This is why Paul is laughing. When I brought up Sandy Generra because sandy is from Staten Island and this, this guy interviewing him from Staten Island. I gotta, I gotta put this video up there because when I have to, when I think of a stereotypical New Yorker Dude, it sounded like too, is that kid Bobby a on an SNL, Bobby Moynihan, this like right in his wheelhouse, like this is a character he would do and that was all excited. He was so excited to meet Sandy Gennaro. This is how he does the interview. He goes, oh my God, I'm standing in Santee genero this guy, he's played with everybody.

Speaker 1:          00:24:35       Sandy to tell us about some of the interviews, get he ends his question going, Gad, get everything he said. So when you were like coming up in rock, you know when rock and roll and who, which drummers really influenced you again, guy. Yeah, I think he only said it once, but I was like, when I saw that, I was like, Bobby Moynihan would take that little little thing and we would turn that until I told you Monaghan did guy Fieri. I got to see the diner's dives and whenever, yeah, that's it. He's got the hair spiked back and he was like at the chin hair and he does the whole, you got this guy and he's got the enthusiasm. That's my favorite thing that Bobby did was when he was doing, they were showing the different kind of drunk people at, at the concert. Oh neat.

Speaker 1:          00:25:21       Did the drunk point and guy and they started playing the song ants marching, that dat, Dat, Dat, Dat, dat, Dat, dat. He was doing it then when he's drunk and he was like pointing towards the stage. It's a fucking visual. You've got to see him do it. And you know, it's funny as I've been to a zillion concerts and seeing that guy and I never really thought about it, but when he did it, I fucking died laughing going like I've, I've seen that guy a zillion times. So anyways, so there you go Paul. That's my big, my big, my big weekend in my, my hobby there. The drum world. I got to uh, well I came into your little hot, you got me into this hockey thing this week, man. To you fucking buying those skates was the funniest shit ever. It was like my wife trying to find a pair of shoes.

Speaker 1:          00:26:00       This fucking guy tried on like you supposed to, well first of all, only Canada has a, has a selection and a wall like that. We go into the, and that was a shit one two cause they said the best one was down in Halifax. That was a shit one. Well they would, shit is fucked. You know what it was, it was a shit time to go in because it was, it's almost spring. It's fucking hilarious. It's like minus 30 out here and it's like springtime for them. They had a wall top to bottom, every brand and it was $700 skates there. There was $700, $300. And I'm like, look, I haven't been on skates and I'm 11 years old. So I'm thinking I'm going to go in and get like $60 and you kinda like you kinda you. I hope my wife doesn't listen to this.

Speaker 1:          00:26:38       I spent a little money. Uh, but she goes, I fucking with dude, whatever. I'm kidding. I'm, I'm that one. I'm afraid my wife, right? Yeah. Yeah. The support your Freddy away if that's okay. You don't have to back pedal line. No, but listen, it is kind of crazy to spend money on skates when you haven't done it, you know, in, in how many years and then you're going, listen, you're good. You got, you got, you could, you didn't like peer pressured me into it, but you just go, those are good. They'll last forever. And in my mind I'm like, I'm going to have these for 20 years. So then I was like, get me this, get me this pair. And they didn't have my size. And then I finally got these and you were giving me shit saying I was being a diva, trying to get a pair of ice skates.

Speaker 1:          00:27:11       But one thing he and I had to literally walk away because I'm one of those people, Paul, like the second I finished a meal, I get up and I leave and I've been working on doing that. I don't know if you've noticed on this tour that I've actually sit there like, dude, I'm scattered brain. Like I'm already, I'm like finishing my last bite. Stacy says I get up and leave and she goes, can we enjoy this? Our water? Can we just enjoy the rest of this? And I, but I like to sit to now. Oh okay. Yeah. Yeah. So I'm trying not to do that shit. So I'm seeing you just keep like, like some wine connoisseur keeps sending these fucking skates back. So I literally, and I'm, and I want to get down to Halifax because I got something that's another place where I can skate. Cause my old things, I'm not going to booze. I'm going to skate on this fucking thing. I'm actually going to lose weight for once and not become Billy fat face on the fucking road. You could do that having a couple of drinks, but we'll talk about that. A hilarious, Paul's trying to twist my arm. I've, I've got, I've got, I got 35 days in pork. I'm, I'm 53 today. Okay. I haven't hit my wife in seven weeks and you're going to have to go back to the drink.

Speaker 1:          00:28:16       We can't not how so anyways, so I literally, I'm walking up acting like I'm checking the car to make sure nobody in unbelievably friendly Canada is going to steal that. Well either you go first, you go out, we're going to go check the car and then you go, no, the car is fine. You even said no, the car's fine. And then when the third pair, when I had to change the third paragraph, I'm going to check the car. It's always a deal. So I come walking back in and I'm literally just going, all right, stay calm, stay calm, don't lose your shit. Don't pressure this guy, he's buying skates. He's going to fuck up his feet if he buys the wrong ones. Don't be a selfish Dick Cause you want to drive down to Halifax. Who I now, so I come walking in there and you have on another pair of skates and I'm thinking like, okay, he looks pretty happy.

Speaker 1:          00:29:00       I'm like, I'm like, how do they feel Paul? And you're like, you know the right ones. Good. But the left one is there's something that's pushing against my toe. It's kind of there was pushing against my toe, but he even felt it. And he went in and he said they're all like that. And he goes, they're all like that. And he goes, put your heel back there. You've got to slam your heel down and then tight, tight right around your ankle and your toes. Your toes supposed to be feathering the end. There we were. That's what he said. Don't let your toes for how excited where we walk in. Because also that was then we'd drive down to Halifax. I'm driving fucking versing nuts cause I'm doing, what did I do on like 140 kilometers? Who speed 140 kilometers in? Uh, what kilometer zone was it?

Speaker 1:          00:29:36       I don't know. But you were speeding and it was snowing out and we even saw a truck fish till you were scaring the shit out of me. Oh yeah. There's always a guy in a pickup who fucking goes off the road always in pickup because I've got four wheel drive, no worry about it. And he went right off pay you at one point. I got you fish tail one at one time and I go, man, you gotta. Yeah, that wasn't me. That was the snow. That was dumb when I just said, yeah, that's way not supposed to be speed and you fucking idiot. You even said you. I could feel your nervous as I was scared, man. Now you have a way. When I'm driving too fast, you have a way about you. You sit in this fucking way where you don't grab your leg, right, but you put your hand on the side, that's fovea leg in you. All your fingers are all spread apart. Like you're getting ready to fucking squeeze the material and I pants pants on an airplane to like, it's going to matter like the grip or my hand is going to stop.

Speaker 1:          00:30:29       I slowed down to about 120 kilometers. You, you were like in a row. You were, you were in a rush to get to hell because the public skate was at four o'clock and then we had two shows. So we show up down in Halifax, right? Get another fucking unbelievable meal. Unbelievable fucking fit. And it wasn't even the best place. Now let me tell you something, since it was, the fucking hotel place was incredible. Let me tell you something right now. If you guys are ever in Halifax and you, and you stay at the Atlantica Halifax, it was the best. What one wants the Atlantic? It was the Atlanta, Atlanta in Halifax. It was the best fucking seafood chowder I've ever had in my life, in my life. I couldn't believe what I was eating. I couldn't believe it. I was eating. I told you, I said if my dad ever bit as he'd start crying.

Speaker 1:          00:31:13       So he, yeah. And I, I had scallops or something like that was an unbelievably fresh, right. So, ah, so then we'd go down to the, the, the, the front desk and I go, yeah, we wanted to escape. I'm waiting for them to laugh at US thing. I, yeah, I go where? How do you drive? There they go. It's right over there. He can walk to, it was right there pointing across the fucking go there with thinking it's going to be an indoor rink. It's sleeting outside, not sleeping. It was more no one. Right. So we fucking walk down there and all of a sudden I just see in the distance out in this field is fucking Zamboni driving around and I'm going, Paul, I think it's a, I think it's outside. And you're like, no, no, no, no. It's inside, it's inside. And I'm like, I don't think that guys like fucking doing donuts with that thing.

Speaker 1:          00:31:51       I was in denial about it. I go, maybe there's one next to it inside. I know you didn't have gloves or anything. It's fucking hilarious. So we go down there and says giant oval. Yeah. Giant House. Cool though. Man. I just wish it wasn't snowing cause the ice stumps like a race track. It wasn't like a big open rank. Yes. It was like you go around, it was like it like in the Olympics, the speed skating thing, it was fucking unreal. I was nervous so I was nervous because like, you know when you go inside with a rink, I could fall into the boards, I could skate into the boards of grab it and then I knew that there was nothing. So that's why he's supposed to skate on the outside. That's what he said, skate on the outside because they had the railing and I felt good.

Speaker 1:          00:32:25       But uh, I was joking last night on stage I go, I go burrs one of these guys, you know, he's not admitting he's good. I go to me, can I go? He was spinning around like Dorothy fucking Hamill out there. I picked it up though, right? Yeah you did. You did grab by the first, your first time out there you are great. I told you I was glad I didn't have a helmet because I felt, I was like, don't crack your head. Don't crack your head. And if I had a helmet I might be like, well I spent, I spent $80 on a helmet. You know what, you're going to use it right now. It's been good so far. So I got a, I got a couple more games lined up a pickup games, which is the shit. Um, well I'll watch it. I mean I'll, I'll, I'll, I'll go skate in the corner like that, you know, I'm the one.

Speaker 1:          00:33:06       Yeah. You know, go watch me fucking play hockey with people who actually know how to play and you'll see that whole Dorothy Hamill, uh, idea that you have of me is going to be out the fucking window fall on my face. What would happen if you gave me a stick and I had to concentrate on a puck? Be a nightmare. Well at least you probably wouldn't fall down as much. You didn't fall down at all. But then if you've got the stick that kind of helps you stay up. Yeah, I got him admit it's weird skating without a stick. Oh. Like, I don't have confidence skating backwards without a stick to something about it. I'm just used to that. Yeah. I don't know why. And having all my stuff on. So if I fall down, I know bruise like Mike, Mike, my toe. You know how bad a fucking, how about that guy who was dressed nice.

Speaker 1:          00:33:49       Oh, the guy looked like he was going out to the club. Guy looked like he was going to a wedding reception. He was so good at skating. Oh, he looked like he was going, he had like nice pants on and he was just whipping around there. He wasn't sweating it off. No, probably it went right to the club got blown and that fucking left showed up to the club holding them. Exactly. Hey, by the way, that we, uh, we want to thank everybody who came out to the show so far on this tour. A, we're having a great fucking time up here. And, uh, even the New York or Paul Versey, he's saying that he loves Canada. We're having a great time up here. Um, a lot of people make fun of this country. I don't know why I like them. You know what I like about these guys is Russia's going into the Ukraine and you can, you know, and they can sit here and shake their heads like, wow, we don't approve of that, but they're not going to be like, you know, Canada never really has gotten involved.

Speaker 1:          00:34:35       Right. Canada has never been one to get involved on how well they'll, we drag them into our fucking message. Like a bunch of their guys have gotten, I've gotten killed over and the Middle East, if you watched the hockey night in Canada, Don Cherry shows him all the time. It's fucking brutal. Yeah, it was. They actually show him, we don't show him down there because after they all the college kids protested Vietnam and you know, they'd figure it out. Well don't show this shit on the news. So they just, you know, and then this rag him, that's funny. They're like the neighbor that like is laid back and doesn't want to go out to the club and we're like, no, just, yeah, no. Starting to fight. We start a fight like right Paul White Canada. You think that too, right? Yeah. I mean Kinda, I don't know if we had to resort to violence. Yeah. So anyways, uh, how far into this thing am I? Can I get in with the, uh, the questions here? What do we have any other stories? Were about 35 minutes then. Hang on one second. I appreciate you doing this fucking video. I mean, video the fucking podcast here because, uh, telling you, man, I fucked up my,

Speaker 1:          00:35:39       Oh, this road rage yelling last weekend. I fucked it up. So I'm trying to avoid here. Um, all right, let's get into the questions here for this week.

Speaker 3:          00:35:49       Uh,

Speaker 1:          00:35:50       alcohol and cardiac health. All right, so here it is. So, so far. So by the way, this is a perfect topic. It is, isn't it? Yes. It's a pleasant topic because, well, this is the lungs and the longest have hung out with you without absolutely destroying my liver. No, I was just on the phone. My wife and I said, stays. Not one drop of alcohol, not one gene. She believed, you know, she goes, yeah. And I go and I go, not only that, I had seven fucking salads,

Speaker 4:          00:36:14       I said I've eaten seven salads, I've eaten seven salads and I've had not one drink alcohol. I haven't had a cigar. I have been an angel. But you know what? The buck stops here. Okay, I'm telling you right now, devil is tossed one of the greatest lines. One of the greatest lines ever said. We were out, we were smoking a cigar without booze. Zoe weren't, no we weren't. We weren't. We were, we were driving out to the fucking Gig and Long Island, we've always before the cigar, we're driving out to a giggle long tent. We had the, uh, the, the Westbury music fair. And, and we're sitting and we're talking about how we haven't drank and we're talking about cigars. And a bill starts the sentence with this. He goes, but poor man, I gotta tell Ya. And I'm thinking the next thing out of his mouth, I feel great. I don't want to drink anymore. And he just goes, I gotta tell you, man.

Speaker 3:          00:37:02       Okay,

Speaker 4:          00:37:03       the devil inside of me is tossing and turning. And I said, that is a fucking movie line. I said, Scorsese, fucking terantin. I'll have to hear that. The devil inside devil tossing and turning. You know the devil tossing and turning. Ah, great. Lion Brewery. Like I said yesterday, I go are two devils are in some room right now. Just going, what the fuck? Let us out.

Speaker 1:          00:37:28       We've had, we've basically been up here on a kind of a mandate is what we've been doing so far. It's been fucking ridiculous. Reading Salad. I'm going to bed at like fun, gone a better only drinking water. I'm drinking water like it. It's just, you know, you know it was hilarious was when we went into that bar after in in Moncton nightmare. Like how hammered those people got. Oh my God. And seeing how drunk I know and I don't judge them because I look and go, that's what I do. But you never get locked. I've done that. Oh No, no. They were friendly. Drunk. They were friendly. Draw people touching you shoulder. No, I don't like that. No, no, no. I yell. I can yet like there's a point where I get drunk. I'm a, I'm a happy drunk but if I get drunk in this, somebody that just, I dunno what they just fucking, no, you turn it to bleacher creature fan when you get like really that supporting. Yeah, you're a yeller. Hello?

Speaker 4:          00:38:25       Like you yell, he does every syllable at the Alabama Lsu gets the dream ends tonight and all of these like Crimson people who were wearing dockers and like are looking at them going, what is he talking about? I didn't know what there was. I didn't know the sec was like that. I thought they will fucking, I didn't realize it was such like, no, you said something about someone's, they're so quiet at one time you cause you never, you never sent it to bear. But one time you, you said something about someone's like a mother but you didn't say about someone's direct mother. You were just like Jesus. No, you were like, fathers are good now you said something about that like, but not like direct and one guy just goes, well like they just looked at you like that. There were so horrified there was so horrified. It was so funny. And then, and then the time you, you actually made me embarrassed and blush almost when you, what you did to the kicker of the Miami Dolphins, that Guy Carpenter last year. Like, I'm, I'm sitting there, I'm sitting there. I'm the comic. I get, I think things are funny. I'm drinking and you're just relentless.

Speaker 5:          00:39:25       Hey, carpet, carpet there.

Speaker 4:          00:39:28       Everyone was at the Cincinnati Bangles gaming. Everyone's looking at bill and I'm leaning away from him and value

Speaker 5:          00:39:34       carpenter. You're a liability carpenter. Yeah. That field goal kicker. Get your real estate license and you had half the people laughing

Speaker 4:          00:39:42       and I'm going, bill is fucking, it made the Bengals fan said, get on that guy carpenter. He said, he said yeah. And it was a close game. So, you know, no, they were all into it, but I was like, oh my God. He was the chairman for the home team. He's going in.

Speaker 1:          00:39:55       Oh, that's too bad. I say, that's why I gotta be honest with you. Like I, uh, I'm liking, like live in like this. I'm going to fuck it up tonight. Tonight, we're actually in Toronto and we're going to the maple leaf's game. Um, and I've been trying to explain to Paul what an absolute honor and privilege it is to somehow score may believe tickets because I have hookups. Um, like literally NHL Office, I blogged for them so they still know a couple of people over there and I never hit him up for tickets or whatever. But like the maple leafs are the only ones they don't give a fuck. Like they just like, yeah, no, there's no tickets. No. Somebody told me, have you been to a cat? Have you been to a hockey game in Canada before? And I said No. And they go, it's another, it's a whole other level.

Speaker 1:          00:40:43       Oh, it's awesome. Like it's fucking awesome. They go not really. And they, they, they obviously it's their game. They know the game. They won the men's and women's gold. Oh we talked yesterday. Being in Canada lets me know when a son and father escaped together. It's like the equivalent of a father and son throwing the ball in the backyard, playing baseball. Like, you know, I've never seen a store that has that many hockey skates. Like everything has, hockey was that oval thing. I've never seen anything like that. That was all, I thought that was the coolest fucking thing ever. Like I always like, like that's the kind of shit. Like if I have a move back east, I would build that in my bag. I would build a backyard hockey ranked. There's no fucking way. I wouldn't goddamn global warming by the time I fucking do it. I'm not going to be able to have to fucking live in the Yukon to do it. Um, all right, let's do, uh, let's do some, uh, some questions here for this week. Uh, ALC. Yeah, this right. And that's what set this whole thing off. Alcohol and cardiac health.

Speaker 1:          00:41:34       Hey, Billy cream tits insult me every week. This is the worst thing that they like me, uh, for a couple of years in a row during lent, I abstained from alcohol. It sucked, but it felt good to challenge myself. I did this because all my life, I've always heard that total abstinence, abstinence is the best health. However, recent research has shown that moderate drinkers actually have reduced risk for coronary heart disease up to 29% lower than total abstainers. Although researchers aren't clear as to why it's food for thought. If I were you, if I were you, I would have a damn drink. If, if you want one. I know it's tough sometimes to drink in moderation. I simply try hard to not binge anymore. Having said that, you are probably healthier having the occasional cocktail rather than the occasional cigar. Uh, you might actually live longer. Loved the show, have fun in Canada, come back to the bay area and go fuck yourself. Um, that's not a new study. That's a study that they've been saying forever that you know, one glass of wine is supposed to be good. And I agree with that 100%. That's the carrot cake we had. You know, that's the carrot cake. You got to do it. You got to do it, you know, because then you binge. Are you going to explain to the listeners with the carrot cake was

Speaker 4:          00:42:48       oh yeah. So sorry. So I'm like talking to, you know, the carrot cake was when we went to that place, when we had that ridiculous lunch and mocked in the first day we were there. And, um, I asked for the Arnold pulses and when we went skating together, no, no, no. This is what we had carrot cake together. This the spinner trip, dude, there's no fucking ridiculous. I'm starting to become this guy that needs a dessert with the next SIG free and Roy, no, you're not like this. You're not a coffee dessert guy. But as I'm getting older, I don't know what it is, but after I eat a good meal, I need a piece of chocolate or something. My Dad was the same way. So we go to this bar, we eat this great food, and I saw angled triangle thing and I say to the lead trying to, and I said, look, let you know, do you have something?

Speaker 4:          00:43:28       And she goes, well, we got this carrot cake and I'm at an Irish pub. And I'm like, you know what? Everything was great. I bet you this is great. This is delicious. So I go, all right, bring the carrot cake over. She gives a big piece. I go, Bill, you want half of this thing? I don't want any adult thing. He goes, sure, we bite this fucking thing and I'm going. And then afterwards you go, yeah man, we were really healthy except for the carrot cake and that, that question is right. That question is 100% right. You

Speaker 1:          00:43:49       got to do it, dude. How about the fact that it was homemade? It was deleted desserts. A homemade, sorry, that's my fucking phone. It's delicious. And I, she's come on, come on enough. I'm sorry. Yeah. So I agree with the occasional, you know, the wine a day, a couple of drinks. Look, if we go out and have three to four cocktails tonight, okay, just stay clean and next thing, you know what I mean? No, I don't know what you mean because I do that and then the next time I go on a nice little run I'm not drinking is like two, three years later because I just, you know, you can't, you can't, you don't have a couple of new in this tour is over. Go back on the thing. I mean that hasn't been my pattern. I enjoy it Paul. And what? I'm at a point now where I haven't done it in a while, so now I'm kind of enjoying not doing it and I'm afraid to go back to doing that now cause I'm not, cause I'm literally an alcoholic just because of all the extra fucking bullshit that comes along with it.

Speaker 1:          00:44:46       What you do, although whatever, who's, well, I'm not, I'm not gonna fucking dwell on this shit anymore because I know I'm going to go back to drinking. So what the fuck [inaudible] against the gars dude, I gotta tell you something right now. A Segarra week is not bad for you. I'm going, I'm going to say as a cigar weeks and up fee. And you can say that without doing any research. I love it. No, no, no. That's 52 cigars a year. It's a joke. What does that, well, I'm not inhaling anything. I'm going to do what you're putting into your mouth. Right. And then I wash my mouth that it's like, it's like 10 cigarettes for your mouth. That that study's horseshit. It's not a study. My dentist said it to me. Oh, okay. So then the taste is kind of in the medical field. I mean he, maybe he knows a doctor.

Speaker 1:          00:45:22       Where can somebody say not inhaling a cigar is like smoking 10 cigarettes. No, no, no, no. He said for your mouth. He's saying you're not, it's not bad for your lungs. Look to Michael Douglas was a big time cigar smoker and that guy, he had throat cancer. He had that Paul, you're putting fucking smoke in your mouth. But I mean sports a nigger, they say smokes like four a day every day of his life. He's fine. You know, I told you, that's why I think you got to do it for a while. That Guy Hamo in Boston. Oh my God. Showed you the picture of him. This guy designed it was this guy designed a cigar jewelry. Was it north end? Is that Boston? Yes. Yeah. So the north end of Boston now only has the, only has the only cigar bar lounge in Boston now because they closed the other one.

Speaker 1:          00:46:05       So it's the north end and it's a great place. And He, the mayor of Boston was in there. All these politicians were in there. It was hysterical. And that the owner has the fake Tan and Pinky rings. And how you don't hate it, he's kissing, you know, he's kissing guys on the cheek like, and it's so funny how he and Glenn, thank you guys. Thank you guys for coming out. Did you, did you enjoy? So yeah, I to go, oh, come, this is the place you come to this place. And then he's got this little friend named Hama and he goes and I go, hey, what's that man? Is that hey, they sell jewelry here. It's my, it's my, it's my, uh, you know, I don't own, I just own this here. And he had cigar cufflinks. He had a cigar. Everything was cigar. He had a cigar ring and it was a diamond ash tray with, uh, with, uh, a white gold cigar on it in a Red Ruby to indicate the lit that it was lit and the cigar and I go use when he goes, everything's, I'm not, I'm not joking or trying to be fun.

Speaker 1:          00:46:55       He goes every month I was there with the matter reason. My brother, he goes, everything's a guard. He said to the three things you'd like to go to my kids plussy [inaudible] and it was the funniest and he was dead serious. And he goes, he goes four to five, minimum day, six minimum because I smoked nine a day bill, he pulled out the sixth, one of the night, his, I go, how am I going to do, how many is that for you? He goes, this fix, right? I swear to God it was a size of a fucking cucumber and he's just smoking it and he's going, you want, you want to $80 a stick. You want it. This is the best is to vest. I saw a guy outside of firehouse on eighth avenue when I was in New York. I walked by and I know I smelled this ago.

Speaker 1:          00:47:35       I always get to turn my head like, God, Jesus Christ. It's good. Let me get to the point. It's like here in high heels on the floor, you just have to look, you know, and now when I smell the cigar, I got to look to see like look at the band to see what the stuff, I looked, this guy, it looked like he was smoking a pickle brown. It was like he could, he couldn't put it between his two fingers. He had a hold it like serious, like a fun. I never seen anything like it. Wow. Fucking, I even know how he lit it to fireman. It's fucking elite. Probably lit it at his last fire and like I said, like a house had to be on fire so we could actually like this fucking thick. I would seek to those guys are bad. I would think that those guys have a problem.

Speaker 1:          00:48:13       He's probably thinking I'm fighting fires and breathe in this shit in any ways that God knows to. Would you come up to a building, God knows what's in it, what's on fire or what, what was deemed safe? Yeah, just don't light it on fire cause immediate, all that computer shit, plastics and all that stuff becomes carcinogens, doesn't it? The second it starts in the air. What's the most about Jesus? I Dunno. What's the most of guys you ever had a day? Have you ever had two or three in a day? I've had two back to back and then somebody said to me one time, I said, hey, you want to have another one? And he goes, you know, I never found the second set guard to be better than the first one. And it's just like, you know, that's a good point. So I always kind of keep it in that too, but you know, I smoked them dude off.

Speaker 1:          00:48:56       Like I smoke them all the way down to my fingers. Yeah, well no, I thought I was telling somebody that's strong. One that we had in New York. I said when birth first lit, the strong one, he goes, Oh man, this is strong. And I'm thinking since I've been smoke, cause you know when law had was in town, Lloyd goes versus you got five and two days like you've got to calm down. I was going so I thought you actually handled that one better. You got it down to the thing. I couldn't handle it. I'm like two years old. Yeah. I felt like I was hot. No. Once I got it going, I I you got it down to the, you got it down under the thunder, this stuff. But I wasn't, I wasn't huffin aren't at the way I use. A lot of that was burning.

Speaker 1:          00:49:29       So I kind of, I got along longer time out of it. But when I went to light that thing, dude, like I swear to God, if I had a couple of scotches in me, I probably would have puked. I felt like I was sucking on the tailpipe of a car. It's not like it didn't, it didn't have a good flavor. It was just, it was like a week, 10 years. It was like, it was like you're eating a piece of cake that just know. It was like Paul, it was like putting smoke in your fucking mouth. You know, it's bad for you. It's just 52 times a year. I stand by in a bus. It's delicious though. It is. It is. And we're going to do it. Hey, you know, my, uh, my wife recently diagnosed me with having fucking aid. She's told me forever that I have add and I never bought into it and she finally went to the website and she read all the things dude.

Speaker 1:          00:50:11       And it was just like, they might as well just had a picture of me sitting there not listening to somebody's focusing. It's on some ant walking across the table, um, before looking at something else. Do you have that problem? I think a lot of, a lot of myself and a lot of my comedian friends have that. Yeah. I think it's an, do you think that that's why we think in bits rather than script? I think it's because I think our minds constantly are going, you know, our minds are constantly going, whether it's trying to be creative, whether it's thinking of this, whether it's being upset, we're just, we can't concentrate what I was a student. I would say we're no different than anybody else who's scatterbrained, which is funny. Scatterbrained maybe. You know what I mean? Yeah. It may cause they always try to attribute, like they had something recently where they tried to say that, uh, you know, they did some study.

Speaker 1:          00:51:04       You know who the, nobody knows who the fuck did it was starting to say that, uh, you know, they interviewed all these Comedians, you know, for this study to figure out what makes comedians funny. Now immediately I'm thinking any comedian worth anything is not going to be participating in that fucking thing. Or if the new one that's struggling, they'll participate and they're going to give bullshit answers just to make their friend laugh for themselves left. Right. So they came up with this whole thing that, you know, comedians are all sociopaths or some fucking, oh, I saw it. I didn't like it. That's ridiculous. They, it is because I'm not saying there aren't comedians who are sociopaths, but there's firemen, there's mother's Day, there's all kinds of people that as does leaders of the world who are sociopaths. It just what it is is the, I think it's people who aren't funny.

Speaker 1:          00:51:54       Only somebody who was not funny would try to figure out do that. Why the fuck something's funny? Absolutely. Like I wouldn't even know. I wouldn't even like when you were talking about that guy at the Yankee game who kept yelling out, they had this commercial where it was a bunch of Yankee fans. You was saying that had spelled out Yankees across their chest and they were wrong. Yeah, and they were hammered or whatever. Right. Or they just were wrong. They were just in not organized where it said Yankee. So it's an ant ski and ski. So this guy at the game and a time, anytime there was a lull in the game, wouldn't it? No, it would. It would. There'll be a lull in the game and he would go, Hey, what the hell is that ski? And everybody would just start laughing and he knew when to do it.

Speaker 1:          00:52:36       Yes. Like that guy, he had it and now that guy was not a comedian, but he had that comic timing when there was a lull on the game, he knew it wasn't important time in the game. He knew probably wouldn't if there was a TV time out. Yep. You know, and he wanted to keep the excitement going in people's focus like that you just did. It's like when I look at people who can like just fucking play an instrument, unbelievably played by ear, you know? Um, that's obviously just a hobby for me. So I have a tremendous amount of respect for people who could do that shit. But like they could never just break down that. He was like, would you just sit there and be like, no, look what makes this guy be able to play the guitar like that. It's just like this.

Speaker 1:          00:53:17       They're good at it. It's an envious nerd who can't do it. That's what it is. It's somebody who wished maybe, maybe they wish they could do comedy, but the fact that somebody would do a study, comedians are all sociopaths. That person never picked up a microphone once in their life and maybe they, maybe they had an issue with a comedian. No, I'm not saying that. I'm not a sociopath, but you, you know, you're a family man. You got two kids. Listen, you seem all right. Listen, I use psychopath. Comedians might be narcissistic. Sociopath. I looked up the definition of sociopath. Okay. There was like 11 things or something like that that you could add to. Let's look this up. Go it up right now. One thing I know for a fact, antisocial parents is one of them. Okay? Parents, but like, I mean, antisocial, the world's out to get, you know, we're not going over there.

Speaker 1:          00:53:57       Hey, think this of us. We're not going over. All right, check, check one for me. What? My parents were like, Hey, can I go on this field trip? Nah, Christ had a patient in the other day. He went on a field trip and he fell off the bus. He's gone. He's gone. There's nothing you can do about it. That was where my first jokes I did in my attic. Whatever you wanted to do. My Dad had a patient in the other day and the kid died from it. Oh, that's funny. Yeah. He didn't want to drive. It's over to do it on my dad. My Dad would now by look at it. It's fucking hilarious. I wouldn't do it either with one kid. Forget about Evan fucking all the ones he yet. Hang on a sec. How the spot associate with sociopath, uh, sorry. With the bed. Mike here.

Speaker 1:          00:54:38       Sociopath. Um, uh, traits which I misspelled. Sculpt traps. How do identify as sociopath telling signs and be, oh, what the fuck? Why won't this work? Come on, man. My Dad used to say people what? He'd disagree with that they were crazy. There we go. Crazy. They crazy. He's a sociopath. All right, here we go. What is it? Sociopath. That gives a fuck. Common traits. All right. The common characteristics and personality traits of sociopaths are based on the criteria used by clinicians who use the Dsm map. That what? That, don't they realize morons want to read this? I don't give a shit. Just make a list. Yeah. They should be just a list there. This should dumb it down. Right. One of the most common personality characteristics, sociopath is their grandiose sense of self entitlement. Now I don't have that and I go the other way. Um, sociopath off also often display a lack of remorse.

Speaker 1:          00:55:39       Yep. And most have a very manipulative personality covered by superficial charm. Um, Jesus, I know a couple of those suit. I know a couple of these guys too. All right. Now wait a minute. So I'm not no dude, you're a narcissist who has add. Yeah, I wouldn't be that. Yeah, I would go with that. That's yeah, I would totally go with that. Dude. That's hit shit. That's hit men. I don't have, I don't have a sense of self entitlement. No. Dude, I hit me and blow someone's brains out and goes eat a sandwich. That's a sociopath. He gets mad that he got blood on his shirt, right? Yeah. That was, that was that thing in Goodfellas wins. I'm sorry about your floor. That's, that's it. That's what it is. I didn't want to get blood on the floor cause sociopaths. All right. Friendships and romantic partners are often frequently disregarded and replaced when the relationship no longer suits their self centered needs.

Speaker 1:          00:56:34       The emotions of associates. Nobody even like the guy. I was just thinking about Bob being a sociopath. Um, he doesn't have that. Well I guess can you have like most of it and then be a sociopath? What do you think their doctor Versie not doctor Versie I talked to by not doctor [inaudible]. No, I think what's it called? I think that it's the remorse thing and I definitely think it's the first thing you said. The sense of entitlement. Like this is the cool one here. Look at this one. Jesus Christ. Cool. Like in like a Reptilian, scary way. The emotions of a sociopath may appear to be sincere on the surface, cleverly disguised by super superficial charm and feigned interest. Jesus Christ. That was me and every class classroom I ever was in sitting there acting like you were interested so they wouldn't fucking calling you. Many sociopath's use manipulative measures to draw others to them. Chronic lying as a characteristic of nearly all sociopath's, recklessness and aggressive behaviors are other characteristics as well as impulsivity. A lack of remorse. He already said that or what is generally term conscience is typical for sociopath. Sky's repeating himself. The combination of at least three of the common sociopath characteristics paints a pretty good description of the common sociopath. Um, I dunno, I actually lost interest halfway fucking through that. All right.

Speaker 1:          00:57:58       They did. They, I didn't, it wasn't even trying to be funny that came out of my mouth. Then I realized that just did that again. Well y'all, well, why don't you look up to look up a narcissist, see the difference? Because narcissist is a selfishness, but it's almost like a good guy. Yeah, but dude, I'm, I'm a Gemini so I have like, I can be really like, I mean I think my son's a gem and a Lucas, mainly a narcissist, but then I could be like really considerate and generous. Dude, Lucas, my son Lucas is a gem and nine he's got, when you look at what a gem, a Geminis traits, sorry dude, he's, he's every one of them. She says Christ when he taken out the crystal ball. All right, hang on a sec. I love how I brought up fucking crystal ball. I love how I brought up Geminis and then you start talking about signs and then I act like you brought it up. Oh, all right. Hey, how do you spell narcissist? Go on Paul. Let's show our dummy. R N A R narcissus. Narcissus. I was saying an Ar, maybe what? Ca Maybe I would've gone with that if the right spelling didn't come up. Narcissistic traits or BBL Scott behaviors. Nice assistive behaviors. All right, cool. Narcissists have remorse.

Speaker 1:          00:59:13       Absolutely. Yeah, I think so. They feel bad. They suck. Oh, here we go. I find I found one that's dumbed down red flags of being a narcissist. Here we go, Dad, dad,

Speaker 4:          00:59:27       go ahead.

Speaker 1:          00:59:28       All right. All right. You feel on edge around this person, but you still want to, but you still want them to like you. What is this?

Speaker 3:          00:59:39       Okay,

Speaker 1:          00:59:40       wait, so let me, if I gotta figure, what the fuck. Who is you in this? So what's the difference about this list? Well for one, it's specifically about relationship, but it's also about you. Each point requires interest section and self awareness. Because if you want to spot toxic people, you cannot focus entirely on their behavior. That's only half the battle. Oh, that's pretty cool. He wants to also come to recognize the looming red flags in your own heart. All right, so this is saying if you're in a relationship with a narcissist, it, they don't have a list, then I'll just go, Hey Paul, I'm trying to make it easy here at 30 lists, like 30 things, nothing.

Speaker 1:          01:00:19       Um, well maybe we can actually use our brains. It just figured this out here with, okay, you feel on edge around this person, but you still want them to like you to use his sex as a tool for control. CREEPO that's sick. Plasters, your Facebook page with compliments, flattery songs and poems. They text you dozens if not hundreds of times per day. You come to rely on this over communication as a source of confidence. Wow. Oh, so they give it to you then they take it away. You're not texting me four times a day. Did I do something wrong then I was up there doing. Yeah, I'm not that. No. I can't spell enough words to text more than 30 times a day. All right. Quickly declares you their soul mate. I don't do that. Compares you to everyone else in their life. You just like my mother, uh, lies me, my uncle Petey lies and excuses. Why isn't excuses? That's everybody. No, no startle response. I, you know, what the fuck can you just have a one for dumb people? All right. Here we go. Red Flag, narcissistic behaviors. Jesus Christ. Look at the bitches fucking picture on this. Holy Shit. Is this about her? She gonna tell me.

Speaker 3:          01:01:38       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:01:40       Extreme infatuation with one self, self centered expects to be recognized as superior.

Speaker 4:          01:01:47       All right, now you're getting warm was at you. Now you're getting warm. No, I don't. I don't want to be sure.

Speaker 1:          01:01:53       Period. I mean, you know, extreme infatuations with one's self. Self Center expects to be recognized and just pictures. Somebody combing their main in the, with a mirror, uh, is preoccupied with fantasies of unlimited power, success, brilliance, beauty or ideal. Love sees himself as special. Do this.

Speaker 1:          01:02:20       It should only have to affiliate. Oh Shit. This is a good one. It's a great one. Sees himself as special and it should only have to affiliate with others of the similar stature. I should be friends with that. Obama, I can't believe we hasn't called me yet. That's fucking funny man. Vantage of others takes advantage of others to achieve his needs. Demonstrates as an ugly one. The other one's a funny one. It was one takes advantage of others to achieve his needs. I don't like that one and that other shit. Just staring in the mirror thing and you should be friends with everybody. It was big. Demonstrates a constant need for admiration or approval. Uh, you know, my dad used to, we'd be upstairs shaving. Yeah, it was sort of a joke, but he wasn't joking, but he was, it was funny. We'd be downstairs eating breakfast to south to be up there getting ready for work and he'd be shaving in the mirror.

Speaker 1:          01:03:17       And then when he finished you just hand me, be like, go look, it's a batch. And My mother would always laugh and shake her head, but I think that's more, she just liked a confident guy or something like that. So thank you. That sounds kind of like a gel. Like a habit. It's a joke. Yeah. Yeah. He's played, he's saying it out loud, but I actually I do that makes me laugh all the time. I'll do it. I'll do that. Right. Um, I'll just be like, God damn it. I'm a good looking guy. I'll just do it. Yeah, I'll shut up, right? Yeah. There we go. That'll be a reason a texted me. What a fucking ugly bastard I am. Like, I don't know that already. Fuck yourself. Um, demonstrates a constant need for admiration or approval. Exaggerates personal achievements while minimizing those. That's fucking hilarious.

Speaker 1:          01:04:01       I want to be around this guy. I'll tell you, you know, it's great. It's great the way you came up with a game plan, but it's just good the way I was cheering crowd. Oh Dude. I got this chant going. I tell you, I could see it in Tom Brady's face. He knew, he knew by what I was doing in the crowd. Yeah. And then he tries to knock the other guys changing. He keep, keep calling. He called an audible, you know, which I wouldn't have done. I would've stuck with the play and then no, but then it says he diminishes the other guy. The guys chant was all right, but I got more of them going. Yeah, I got it. And that guy came up to me at the end of the game was just like gray. I don't usually say this, but you were amazing.

Speaker 1:          01:04:45       You go with this list is great. You know why this is is because this reminds me of so many guys that I used to hang out with and gamble with and all that type of shit. Like all these guys, like this is a brutal, if you're a narcissist, you walked into a fuck casino. It's fucking brutal. Cause you're gonna walk in thinking you're James Bond and you have this system and you're going to take the whole fucking house down. Yeah. I gotta tell you there's nothing funnier than that one that you read that said that they think they're superior, so they should only be hanging out with people that are superior. That it's so fucking funny and hilarious. Yeah. Oh, um, all right. Is convinced that he slash she is unique. Yeah. I liked how that just suggests. That just takes it, we're all special. This websites like, no, you're not, feels entitled to special treatment and that rules frequently don't apply to him. Um, I don't have the first half, but I have the second house I have, I have problems with authority. I definitely do.

Speaker 6:          01:05:37       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:05:37       I told you that story right where I didn't if I told you that fucking story, right? Oh yeah. I didn't get caught either. My proposed love and marriage within only a few weeks might I'll may propose love and marriage with only with, but then only a few weeks of starting a relationship that definitely wasn't me.

Speaker 1:          01:05:56       Very charismatic and charming at first, but can quickly switch from doctor [inaudible]. Hi, this is fucking ladies. These are all just the same thing over and over again. Oh wait, panics. Cries, begs and becomes emotional. If he anticipates an end to a relationship, that's not, I swear to God, I'll pay attention to you more. I was wrong. What do you want me to show you? I was wrong. May Harass or stock you if you do break up. Oh, cause he wants to be the one who breaks up or she quick to anger or feeling salted or slided rages with anger or inflicts the Silent Treatment went upset. A Ding, Ding, ding, Ding, Ding. I got that quick to anger. I got that. I wouldn't stock somebody denies he slash she has issues to work to work on. That's fucking sees himself or herself as nearly perfect.

Speaker 1:          01:06:50       I fucking love this guy. What are you talking about? He talk already. That's so funny. Maybe you want to work on yourself. Adapt around me. Drives recklessly in a way too fast. Exaggerate this exaggerates the truth or blatantly lies. Dude, I want to be around this guy and just listening to him tell stories. This is the funniest shit. Rarely treats anyone with respect or kindness. Does it exist? College doesn't acknowledge or respect others' boundaries. Always wants to be in control. May drink and drive regularly. Yeah. Cause he doesn't give a fuck about other people. His slash her need for attention, time and space and matter. Um,

Speaker 6:          01:07:35       okay.

Speaker 1:          01:07:35       Oh, his need for ty for attention, time and space matter. Yours. Your needs do not. Um, let me just read one more of these before this gets boring. Uses sex as a weapon through withholding, controlling, or being overly demanding. I said socket, the best dick ever doesn't appear to have a conscious, does not take criticism well and becomes easily defensive as easily hurt and insulted Jesus Christ. That's what, that was a fucking hilarious list. Oh really funny. I love that is funny though. Huh? Sees themselves as superior and should

Speaker 2:          01:08:16       only be hanging around superior beings. That's all right. Let me, let me read. I got to do a little, I got to do the other fucking, uh,

Speaker 6:          01:13:38       Okay,

Speaker 2:          01:13:38       let's go. Let's go here. Time travel.

Speaker 6:          01:13:41       MMM.

Speaker 2:          01:13:43       Time travel. Billy thrills. Um, if you could travel to any time period period prior to 1900 but you were forced to live out your life there and you couldn't come back to the present, where would you choose to go? Keep in mind anything before 1900 means everyone probably smells and dies it 40 years of age. That's not true. Not if you have money. You live long. Ben Franklin look for a long time and he was a fucking booze bag out there. Flying. Is Kate in the rain?

Speaker 1:          01:14:12       Did he live long? Yeah. Yeah. He lived to like be like 70. Oh Wow. Yeah. And he went out there with this kite in the rain and he was fucking shit faced. So he got his house keys tied to the thing. That's the real story of how we discovered electricity was fucking hammered you serious? Yeah, he was out of his fucking mind. And if he was actually stone sober, he probably would have died because he would attend stuff when he got electrocuted. But cause he was drunk, he was all relaxed like hey man. And he just rolled down the hill, landed on his ball. That's actually how he went bald. He went down the hill, like one of the lightning struck, they hit the Keenan boobs. It's off his head off. What new studies have shown all of this. Oh, I thought it was just fucking male pattern baldness. No, that's he got elected. No, like 30% of people, this is the worst thing they never talk about. If you get struck by lightning like you Amit, that blows off that top part. You serious? Yeah. And it doesn't come back either. It wouldn't make a difference with me, but that's why Mike Michael Bolton does that cherry. He does that charity thing for a, don't tell me he does a charity for people that get struck by lightening. Got their hair blown.

Speaker 4:          01:15:26       I can't believe you believe in this shit. I'm just making all this up. The fucking top of the head. You know it doesn't, but does he have a charity,

Speaker 1:          01:15:33       Michael Boat? Yeah. Yeah, but not for that. No. Oh, I fucking committed to that. I did. All right,

Speaker 4:          01:15:40       let's continue.

Speaker 1:          01:15:47       Dude, that was getting so deep. I couldn't keep a straight face. I'm like, there's no way he's believing this one. All right, this one, get it down the hill. I said, that's how he went bald. And they go, no, no, wait, here's a better life. You still like really? Is that what happened? Jesus Christ. Paul, what's the world coming to? All right Paul, if you could live any time period before 1900 anywhere. Anytime. Oh Man. Where would you go? I don't know.

Speaker 4:          01:16:14       I would go somewhere where there was a war, but wait, but in the question, can I take things from present?

Speaker 3:          01:16:20       Okay,

Speaker 1:          01:16:21       well, let's see. You could time travel to any period. 1900

Speaker 4:          01:16:25       so what the fuck would you bring here? The second you pulled anything out, they think you were a witch and they kill you. What I'm saying is I would go to there with like shit that they don't have now. That's what I'm saying. Like in a war though, and I fucking just lace. Like if I took a side, you know, you go with a couple uzis or a fucking machine gun. He just fucking lady. You wouldn't, you'd be a fucking God forever. It'd be a hero. You know? You'd be like, you'd be God, what are you gonna do? You're just going to walk out in the field and use Nike fucking sweatshirt. It Jordan's. Yeah, just walk out dress like this. And they would be like, you know when they were packing muskets and doing the whole thing and I'd be like, no, not all guys. I got this what year? What year? I just fucking, and they would be like, oh my God, but just be the fucking man forever. That'd be the man forever. You imagine that?

Speaker 1:          01:17:06       Yeah. I'm trying to wrap my head around where they're not completely freaked out by you. You're going to go first of all, first of all, what year are you going back to? Well, he said why? He said prior 1900 yeah. So what year are you going back to the pack and Musket? So what are we talking here? Well, there was a couple of one there. Oh, what is it like 18 like 1817 1870s right. Well by 1870s they had like the Winchesters and those repeating rifles and that they actually had their first machine gun in the civil war, I believe Spanish American. Anyways, we had the little frank, if you fucking mowed them down, I go before that time then. So you're talking like I, if I was you I would go early 18 hundreds okay. So I'd go early 18 hundreds yup. And I would bring some sort of, who are you going to mow down?

Speaker 1:          01:17:54       Um, what if you went in the French and Indian war and you actually found on the side of the Indians what year was just mowed down? A bunch of French people, whichever side. I decided to choose, like when I got there and they saw that I showed up from a time machine, right. One group's going to be nicer to me right now. They're all going to be completely freaked out by you. There's going to be to you as a threat and you'll probably have to turn your Uzi on them. Then you'd have to steal their clothes and then try to fucking do an accent. I would choose a side of the people that were the nicest, warmest to me when I got there, and then I would fucking become their savior. Nobody's going to be nice to Paul. You understand that? If I did it, they would rewrite the book on me.

Speaker 1:          01:18:35       They would. They would be a mythical I, they would kill you. No, I would, they would kill you, Paul. They would kill you. They would tell Steve what happened to Jesus. No, they would. What happened to Jesus? They got crucified. Okay. So yeah, but you're going to run out of bullets. So now, but I'm just in the question. It doesn't specify like what I'm coming with. I'm going to go prepare. How big is this fucking time machine? No, no, no, no. I'm going to go with like a bunch of clips and a couple of Uzis. Okay. And they're gonna write fucking stories about me being be mass murdering psycho from the fucking future. And it go some mythical wearing lazy, close, lazy at the close though. Some Italian do front of you or they're not even know what New York is. Oh, actually maybe the other [inaudible] yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:19:19       Do you, you're not listening. You Paul. This is the key. They wouldn't all kill me, but Paul is saying, I'm here to help. Listen, listen, I got, I came to this, I can't listen to what I would tell him. Okay. And then you tell him what you'd say. I say, look, I came from the future to help you. This machine brought me here to help you. I'm going to solve your problems. And then I would fuck a pull out. Okay. And let me ask you this, wealth live this. Let's do this. Let's say fucking after this tour, you can't sleep one night and you look out your back yard and you see this fucking thing appear out of nowhere and this guy gets out and starts walking towards your fucking house from a time machine and let's just say you have a shotgun and this guy walks up.

Speaker 1:          01:19:58       He goes, no, no. Hey, listen, listen, Paul Paul and he's wearing these weird workout clothes from 300 years in the future. Listen, I'm here to help you. I'm here to do things that you're going to like. You're going to fucking trust this guy. I don't know because I was sleeping in my bed and and I'm not. I'm talking about I want to show up into a conflict. I want to show up to the moment of a conflict and fucking take a side and when it, I want to win the game for the team. This is what I'm saying. It's a very narcissistic behavior here, Paul. You know, you think he's just going to show up on a battlefield. They're going to be like our brain show up and you fucking walk out of this thing with yet, but he's sweatshirt and a fucking Uzi and the, no, the, the union army and the rebels are not like one of them is going to win.

Speaker 1:          01:20:41       One of them's going to embrace you. Yeah. One of those groups are losing fathers and sons and I go, I got this fuck the musket and I just fucking, I just fucking lays out an army. They're going to look at me like, dude, this guy, where are they going to do? They're going to go that we've been saved this. Once they realize you are mortal, they would fucking, probably they would. They would take your weapons is what they would do. How they getting to you? Is He from me? If they're fucking packing a musket and they have knives because what are you talking and Paul, because you're going to have your fucking back to him.

Speaker 1:          01:21:13       If he's shooting at the other guy, Paul, you know what they're going to do. They're going to probably at nice to you. This would be okay. And then what they're going to do is they're going to try to figure out where the fuck you came from. They're good immediately confiscate your fucking time machine and they're going to try to see if they can duplicate it. Salts weight so they can run the fucking world. How are they going to confiscate the time machine from me when I'm the one with the ammo? I'm the one with the semiautomatic weapons. I'm the one who's just say, well, are they going to do, what are they going to do? Paul is, they're gonna fucking put an all points bulletin out on every fucking Goddamn tree out there wanted sweatpant guy from the future. This man alone has been in this time zone is error for fucking 20 minutes and it's already killed 600 feet.

Speaker 1:          01:22:05       No, but here's the thing. The question was where would you go and if you couldn't come back, if I survived this all did you, did you, did you see? Did forget about, I know you didn't read anything in history. Let's just, let's just talk. Okay. Yeah. World War II. There's muskets in 1870 fuck packs and the guns, I mean in 1870. I just laughed. So hard to see in dots. No. Um, world war two I read about, I read about shit. You literally sound like you sitting on a stoop right now. I know stuff. God, what was the question?

Speaker 1:          01:22:40       I was going to ask him. I was going to talk about people in history, but how about let's just, we'll go with movies. All right. Right. You saw there will be blood. Yes. Okay. That's based off like the robber barons, uh, of, of the fucking, you know, 17, 1800. The uh, the people you've got involved in oil rig, the railroad guys, the Rockefellers, the Vanderbilts, the fucking people who like fucking at all. Yeah. Yeah. They came over here. Right. They fucking got it. You know, they just, it was wide open. You could do whatever the fuck you want and they, they did it right. All right. This is funny. I've made fun of you for being stupid. I can't even explain this. These guys, the JP Morgans and all these types of fuck guys. When you show up with this machine where they can fucking change the past, they can change the fucking future.

Speaker 1:          01:23:33       These sociopath psychos are not going to let you, Paul Versey. Once they fucking sit down and they talk to you, Paul, take day. See where the fuck you're at. They will pretend to be friends with you and when the second you set down you your Uzi to have a little bit of mutton with them at the villa for us today with cut you ear to ear. Oh No, no. First of all, I'm too fucking street smart to ever put my o down and let them find, start fucking drinking tea and crumpets with these. I don't like how you think you're street smart and every fucking error like you know what the signs are in 1812 you think I'm going to leave my fucking Uzi down when nobody's got one that's gold to those people. That's, that's, that's, that's ends, that's ends problems. I would never do that.

Speaker 1:          01:24:16       So you going to become friends with these people? Always having a gun trained on them. That's what you're telling me. I said, how about this? This is what I could also do. I could get there in my time machine and I could befriend one person and I could let them know that I'm here to help them if they need and tell them what I could do. And then maybe they can say, hey listen, when we get into, you know, when the rebels come, I've got a guy, you know what, I wasn't listening. I was thinking about what I was going to do. All right, well what would you do this, what I would go back to once in 1900, I would go back and keep in mind anything before eight, prior to 1900, I would go back to 1899. Okay. Cause I want the most up to date and medical fucking shit available for when I come down with polio.

Speaker 1:          01:24:58       Whatever bullshit that's going to hit me. Um, I would, I would do is I would try out and make a major league baseball team and I would fucking destroy them with my, uh, with my knowledge of nutrition, my a hundred 120 years in the future. If my knowledge of nutrition, you know what I would do, I would take some PE days back with me before they even know how to test for it and I would fucking roid up fucking just give I, Bruce and I would try out for the Boston Red Sox and we would win it for every fucking year, right through the twenties. That's a great idea. And that's what I would do. But you'd have to go back with sterile. Yeah. You'd have to go back. You'd have to convince these people that you're going to inject. Still don't think I could hit a curve ball. Huh? I still don't think I could hit a fucking curve ball, but I just figured if I went back to the fucking, I couldn't make them. I couldn't make a major league baseball team in the 19 hundreds but I think I could make one in the 1890 so just I would have me go back. When did it start? 1880 join the fucking Phillies. I wouldn't want them to win a championship, but who I want what? Whenever the one of the fucking red sox come around, there was the first, see the red sox came around in what the and the 18 early 19 hundreds

Speaker 3:          01:26:08       okay.

Speaker 1:          01:26:08       I'd like to play whenever they, they built Fenway in 1912 I would just like to come up to bat. God dammit. I couldn't do it so I'd have to go back, but I'm my age now. I'd be too fucking old by then.

Speaker 3:          01:26:21       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:26:21       Fuck him. He can still kill it though. This is what I would do. I become totally fluid in the Latin and a, I would fucking go back and I'd watch a game at the Roman Colosseum. That's fine. I'm trying to sports related, I would just take my chances with, I would just go with the heavy artillery. I would be, I would be a defense. I would be, you know, I'm going to Ronald Reagan route, just spend it, all of them, all the money on defense. I would hope that they would utilize me that way as an asset military wise. You know, dude, you're out of your mind dude. Why? Like just me going back thinking that I could fucking make a team. Cause I looked at Benton, those 1890s like did, they were like softball teams, so just hadn't ringers there. That's, you know, all those guys didn't stretch do, but you know, you just went up to your neck in a wild west days.

Speaker 1:          01:27:07       They fucking went outside and they went back to back and then 10 paces. I fucking get rid of that man. I'm talking about, I have everything. I'm an ass. Don't have anything. Paul, what you have is a gun and bullets. You have the best gun, right? With the best bullets. But you're ignoring the fact that an entire army is going to go after you, that they're not going to allow, they're not going to allow you. They wouldn't allow you to take power. By the way, for the way that you seize power. As you assimilate and you work your way up through the ranks and then you have a you, you and you strike when the time is right. That's how you try and start your own shoe. Come in, they're all rogue and I was like, listen, I have better shit than you guys could ever dream of having, but don't worry.

Speaker 1:          01:27:59       I'm your friend. These fucking paranoid assholes, these control freaks, this, they want that you could not live. They would be smearing you in in the the, the paper with every fucking day. Just talking about this reminds me of that shoe or a big of a threat than the savages that need to be clear. They, they, they would, they would put you above getting rid of native Americans at that point. You would have to be eliminated, but not before they found out how took apart the gun to figure out how it works. Tortured you for all the fucking, um, knowledge that you had an and grilled you about that time machine to figure out if you built it or you just fucking used it. So what if I lied to him and I said I could get more of this. I got a time machine. Nobody knows where it is, but I could go back and get more of this like, so if they knew that I could, I could, you know what I mean?

Speaker 1:          01:28:45       If I lied on that, that's the best. That's the best move. You've said out of all of this scenario where maybe you know, you, you could do a play on their greed and their desire to have more. That's actually a smart fucking move. But if you just think that you're just going to show up with your fucking cigar and your Uzi and come walking out on a battlefield, do this sketch, I'll just want to do this and just change the course of history depending on who was nicer to you. What if the Germans were nice view and World War Two. I mean, you know they had nice uniforms. Paul, you're going to sign with them. It would. How funny would it be? Just watching me going there with air maxes on Nike Air Max is honest, the Gar and it's the white chair and I'm like, listen, sit down.

Speaker 1:          01:29:26       I got a gun that could solve it and I just show the guy I would love to. I would fucking love to see the looks on their faces and then all of a sudden they rebelled against me. I think if, I think if you actually, if you actually went out there and you mowed down the whole other side with what you had. Yeah, that was my original. That's what I would think that if I was on the, on my side. Are you on your side? Yeah. I would slowly be backing away as you were doing it and then I would slip into the woods and fucking run away is what I would do. I would get the fuck away from you because I don't pull. You understand what the fuck I'm seeing.

Speaker 1:          01:30:04       Okay. You can show up in your space close with your fucking ray gun. I mean, it's just like I'm out of there. I'm fucking out of there. I'm going to leave and if you come towards me, I'm going to shoot. I mean, if a fucking alien landed and I had a gun, fuck his ray guns. Fuck all that bullshit. If it starts coming towards me, I got to shoot at it. If that happened, I'd be living in the biggest house in the 18th so I'd have all the women would be fine. I would be the fucking Jesus there. They would fucking draw pictures. Do you know what it is, Paul? This is your own little narcissistic head trip and that's the exact thing that would bring you down. You know something? I think that this is a great answer to your listener. As questionable. You're acting. You aren't in love about all of this, Paul. You're acting like you know how to make a fucking Uzi. No, I'm saying what time machine you're going to bring one. So he did was bring it and they're going to figure it out because the scientists back then were just as brilliant as a scientist. Now they just don't have the information that the ones do today. So they would immediately break down your fucking what you are that you're a stand up comedian.

Speaker 1:          01:31:06       That's what they would do. Well, what are you going to do, Paul? What are you gonna do for food? You're going to Uzi at deer. Okay. And then do you know how to start a fire without some wood prominent ticket? You know how to do that? Yeah. How do you do it? You know how to start a fire without matches. Yeah, I mean I've seen it done. I've watched it on TV. I've seen it on the fucking, I've seen it on youtube. I did. I fucking see it on youtube when we ran a matches at the house one time. I swear to God, I was watching a clip. Yeah, I've watched it too. Yeah, the guy sat down, yet he gets to the driest, whatever they call it, the grass or the dry fucking Paul. I'm gonna tell you this right now. If you can make, if you could start a fire and twist the thing, right? If you could start a fire tonight. All right, we'll go to the Toronto Central Park. If you could start a fight, a fight, a fire, I'll give you all the money. I'm going to make it on this tour with don't watch the youtube video again. I want to see you start this fucking far. Okay. And if you don't some wood or is down, if you don't, then you have to walk into the fucking, into the Lake Ontario with the Jordan Song 30 and shit. Well that's the point I want. You don't want you to stop.

Speaker 1:          01:32:13       You're hilarious. You're like, yeah, you did see it. Wow. All right, let's go with baby names named Jesus Christ. This is becoming a long one here. Um, all right, baby names. Uh, dear Billy trimester. My wife and I are expecting our first child. We don't know whether it's a boy or a girl, but we're starting to talk about names. My inclination is to go with the name that's not trendy, but not super common. Like Mike, she's whoever wrote this. I like, uh, but part of me is like, Eh, fuck it named the Kid Hendricks or wolf, something he can take to the playground and build a reputation around, uh, what would be your strategy? Oh, you're the parent. Paul, what do you think? Uh, what she said about the whole mic thing is exactly what me and Stacy said. You know what he said? Well, what he said, um, my, uh, when my wife was pregnant with Lucas, you know, I didn't want, I just didn't want George Mike, you know, Joey Anthony, I just didn't want that.

Speaker 1:          01:33:13       You know, I wanted something different and uh, I agree. I mean, wolf and Hendrix is a little much, you know, calling your kid wolf, he's going to get fucked. You know that they mean it's, it's, it's a bad ass name. But if he's not bad ass, it's fucked. Like, if he's in percent IOM or if he's a fucking, his name is wolf. Yeah, no, you can't have a singer named Wolf, you know, fucking it becomes an opera star. He had the fucking Wolf Gang Fun. Um, I like that though. I don't like super common, but I don't like, you know, you know what, what's her name? Gwyneth Paltrow. Apple or fuck cocoa or something crazy. So I think it's something respectful, really nice, you know? Uh, yeah, but the thing is you got to make sure you pick the right one where you know, like, I remember for a minute, remember those, those Dylan Dakota years, everybody was naming and the kid said, bullshit.

Speaker 1:          01:34:04       Takota fucking Tanner. Tanner. It was a little bad one. What was what Tom Tyler and I don't know if Tyler's Tyler is fine. Tyler's all right. But uh, how about one of those? We didn't get Bryce. I hate, I hate to be once that me too. I don't like him. No. Yeah, me too. Oh, I am one. I'm a mainstream one. I don't mind bill Bob that bullshit. But like I, it was like, who the fuck does that? Like the name like they have like, or Roger Clemens, you know, named all his kids began with a k because he strikes everybody out there talking about sociopath. We'll fucking narcissist. Right. Everything Oldie Kyle. Yeah. Everything. Everything had to do with K. Yeah.

Speaker 6:          01:34:48       Cunt. Um,

Speaker 1:          01:34:53       um, anyways. Yeah. I Dunno. I Dunno why we, you know, we actually, uh, I've talked about that type of shit. I don't know, man. I don't, that's, that's a tough one. I know somebody who'd be selfish cause it's not about you and those Hollywood people that name the fucking names. It's about them. It's about them.
