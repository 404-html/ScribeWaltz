Speaker 1:          00:00:01       Hey, what's going on? It's bill bird. It's the Monday morning podcasts for Monday, September 9th, uh, 2013. Is that what year it is? 2013. Absolutely it is. Um, how's it going? How are you? Did you have a good week? I'm fucking out of it cause I had to get up at five o'clock this morning and I had to do a bunch of phones for our upcoming shows, you know, answering all the questions. Some good, some bad, some repetitive, but you know, it's what you do as a professional. The answer him every time, like it's the first time. So, ah, how do you, well, how do you come up with your material? The is itself, the egg. Do you write every day or is it more spur of the moment? What? Strike what strikes you as funny and then you got to go into it. Wow.

Speaker 1:          00:00:56       Fucking, you know, fucking teardrop coming out of your eye. But um, whatever, whatever. So here I am. I'm fucking groggy. You knows. You know what sucks is, I used to be a morning person. I really did. But granted, I also used to go to bed at like fucking nine 30 10 o'clock at night because when I was a young fella, a little lad with orange hair running around the playground, try nice to get the shit kicked out of me whilst bullying people smaller than me. That's how you did it back then, right? You beat the shit out of me. I can't beat the shit out of you. I have this awful feeling. Oh, I'll take it out on that little kid over there smaller than me. That's the way it was done. It was the 70s there wasn't social networking. Okay. People couldn't get all get on and be like, Hey, sign this petition man and let's end the bullying.

Speaker 1:          00:01:45       It wasn't, you just had to go to school everyday and you fucking took it and no local news reporter came down and I didn't get to go on the fucking TV with my stupid freckled face, you know, lower bottom lip quivering. As I tell the story of somebody who beat the shit out of me, nobody cared. All right, that was it. So anyways, now I'm in this fucking business so I'm not a morning person. I used to have a paper route. Everybody, I get up at the crack of fucking dawn, you know, jump on a bicycle, be pitch black out in the wintertime, freezing my fucking small balls off, prepubescent, prepubescent, and he said that word fucking balls off, you know, nostrils sticking together and nobody gave a shit. This is, this is back when a child did that job that nowadays an adult has to do the job either because the dollar is so fucking weak or because that Chris Hanson has everybody so paranoid that there's some pervert with his dick out behind every goddamn tree out there.

Speaker 1:          00:02:45       That's why you got fat kids. Right? Did I do a bit about this back of my fucking earlier standup days. I can't even remember. I'm so tired right now. But yeah, we still do that shit. Parents didn't hover over, children didn't have play dates, none of that shit. What it was, was your mom fed you and then there would be, you know, she'd gets Sickey of bright around when like the game show started coming on and then she would just open the door and just be like, you kids need to go outside, go outside. And you just go outside. And there was other kids that were also banished to God's side and then you'd link up.

Speaker 2:          00:03:20       Hmm.

Speaker 1:          00:03:20       And then you just went about your business. You fought your tide kids to trees you to fireworks. Adam, you, you played with matches you through shit and people's pools. You vandalized a new house that was being built, you know, sweet, innocent, fun like huck Finn and Tom Sawyer. That's what the fuck you did. But uh, those days are all gone to it. Keep kids inside and you feed them and you get a big and fat. That's what you do. Well, that was the bidder. You get them so fat that they're unfuckable. Right.

Speaker 1:          00:03:51       It's not what it was. I can't remember what if there's a pervert is into fat kids. You know, it was a lot of holes in my jokes this week. People. I'm not gonna lie to you. Um, so anyways, I hope you guys had to go wake up. Is it that NFL football's back that, that, that, that photo photo? Would you do put you do? Um, I actually went to the, uh, the Denver Broncos. Who the hell do they play? The Ravens? So I get into this big tex battle with Paul Versey Paul verse. He's going like, dude, it's a lock. Take Denver given 10 points. It's a lot, dude. I called it and all this type of shit, right? Typical VRC. And I'm sitting there going like, Paul, it's the first week of the season. Nothing's a fucking lock. You have no idea. Okay. You're throwing a fucking yacht and you throw in a boat into the ocean.

Speaker 1:          00:04:40       All right? Is that if you an expression. Um, but I like it. Okay. If you can't do the math on that, I can't fucking help you. All right. Anyways, so he's telling me it's a fucking lock it up. Just going like, you know, 10 points. I know ed reads not there. I know Ray Lewis isn't there. They still got a defense. They still got Joe Flacco, they got ray rice. I mean, ray rice can eat up a lot of God damn clock. And as good as Peyton manning is, if he doesn't have the ball, what the fuck's he going to do? So, uh, I, and another thing that bugged me was everyone on ESPN was picks picking the Broncos ball versus picking the Broncos. Everybody I know was saying the Broncos are going to kill him. Like this fucking team wasn't just in the Superbowl last year, beaten the 40 niners getting 10 points.

Speaker 1:          00:05:28       So I said, fuck it. I think the ravens are going to win. We're not, when I think that they're there, they're going to cover. And uh, the first half when exactly how I said it was going to go, ray rice was running all over the place. She went up the fucking clock. Joe Flacco never looked good, but he was looking good enough. Defense had a big hit right in the beginning, eh? Uh, thanks. [inaudible] right. And then, uh, the second half Cape, and it was just, it was over. Broncos are like, all right, we can't run a, let's go into a hurry up offense. Joe Flacco looks like he hasn't thrown a fucking ball since the last he threw in the super bowl. He's got his big contract, he got married, let's say we a blitz them every other play and see how he deals with this shit and they fucking didn't make any adjustments.

Speaker 1:          00:06:17       And I sat there watching one of the greatest quarterbacks of all time have one of the greatest performances of all time and I could not enjoy it. Just sitting there and knowing that Paul Versey was going to be right and I was going to be wrong. And I was literally sitting there fuming for like 24 fucking hours that the fucking ravens had no answer to the Broncos halftime adjustments. The fact that I was fucking sitting there with Paul Versey, I mean with, with Jason Law head going like, don't, the Broncos can't run the ball. They should just fucking throw it now and throw it to the sidelines because he's fucking picking them apart. It's exactly what the fuck they did.

Speaker 1:          00:06:58       I thought what's his face was going to settle down. Jesus Christ. Joe Flacco, I finally believe in the guy, never believed in the guy. I know it's only one week, but he looked fucking horrific. So I'm not saying he's going to be horrific all year, but, uh, anyways, long story short, I had a great time and I really should have enjoyed watching Peyton manning throw for seven touchdowns cause that was a legendary performance in any era, even with the new rules of passing where you just supposed to escort the fucking a receiver down the field and get out of the way when the quarterback under throws him and shit, it was still an unbelievable performance. And I was actually had great seats and a, he threw a couple of fucking balls. Like they looked like they were coming at our seats and you know, the receiver came back and caught him. He just got to see the speed of the NFL and how fucking accurate manning was. It was amazing to watch it if I wasn't such a fucking grumpy cunt, uh, during the game.

Speaker 3:          00:07:53       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:07:55       And I gotta tell you, I actually enjoyed, uh, watching the patriots trying to figure out what we're going to do now on offense. Now that Gronk has hurt and Hernandez is looking at some serious jail time.

Speaker 3:          00:08:09       Uh,

Speaker 1:          00:08:11       I dunno, I actually enjoyed watching them play the fucking bills. I got to see a whole other level. That's what it's going to be this year. It's going to be a watching Brady do what he does best, which is make people around him even better. And that's what the truly great ones can do,

Speaker 3:          00:08:30       you know?

Speaker 1:          00:08:32       And that's why I have issues with some people that they say are great, but they're just individually great. They don't make people a better around them. In fact, they borderline annoy people around them. Koby Bryant. Um, but you know, I'm not going to name names, so, uh, I don't know. We shall see. This is going to be a tough season

Speaker 1:          00:08:53       for I think the Patriots. I don't know. I don't how good we're going to be. The sheer it is. It is early on, but uh, but I'm all right with this is when you actually become a true fan when your team is in a fucking lock and a, I liked that that quarterback that the bills had ega manual. I liked effect. Is that his last name? I can't even remember. But the fact that the guy can fucking run, but uh, he didn't seem like he only ran as a latch as the last, like ditch. Like I just got to fucking run. He seemed like he tried to use his speed more to stay in the pocket and thrill. So a, they look pretty God damn good to me. And that's it for my boring ass football talk. How'd you like that everybody? How about a funny story bill? All right. Hop out the fact that I have a bruise on my back the size of a fucking softball.

Speaker 1:          00:09:38       How'd you get that bill? Well, I decided to go hiking in the rocky mountains and the beautiful state of Colorado. I went up there with Rosebowl legend Jason Law had, you know, we went up there like we were on a second date. Let's go on a hike. Do you like hiking too? I'm so excited. So we decided to go on this fucking hike and I'm nervous going into the rocky mountains cause I, I'm thinking they got bear, you know, fucking l Barracuda, whatever the fuck they got up and there, you know what I mean? This is the real deal. This isn't like the fucking Hollywood hills out here where, you know, I'm going to run into fucking Kevin Bacon before I run into any sort of fuck. You know, I'm going to run into fucking Louie depalma before I run into even a bobcat out here. That's all it is. Maybe Lee majors visa in a bad mood. Maybe you'll fucking throw something at me. That's the worst I have to worry about out here. These are the fuck can rocky mountains. All right. These are the mountains that they create cause light with. This is the real deal.

Speaker 1:          00:10:43       So, um, we're going in there, you know, with nothing but fucking, you know, our workout clothes, I have no weapon on me. Everything is telling me this is fucking stupid.

Speaker 4:          00:10:54       And, uh,

Speaker 1:          00:10:57       we're in boulder, Colorado, which I'm telling you, man, boulder, Colorado, arguably the best, the most in shape people I've ever seen in my fucking life.

Speaker 4:          00:11:07       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:11:07       We were sitting there walking up this, this, this hiking trail and we're all, you know this, pardon me? I'm fucking nervous cause I haven't gone up there. I'm with somebody who hasn't gone up here. This has all the makings of one of those readers digest. I almost fucking died stories that they have in there. And all of a sudden his fucking lady, she had to be in her late fifties, comes running down the trail. People not walking, running, wearing those sneakers that look like feet that are fucking annoying. But you have to look at them with this spring in her step.

Speaker 4:          00:11:40       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:11:41       Like Walter Payton running on the balls of her feet came running by barely breaking a sweat. Big Smile, fucking glow interface. Hadn't let life beat her down or anything. It was unbelievable.

Speaker 1:          00:11:56       And I'm like me and Jay, but at that point we'd been in, we'd been in, um, in boulder for like three days. We did the show at the boulder theater, did two shows. There were fucking awesome, uh, unbelievable crowds, great theater, a part of the Billy red state tour, the rescheduled one. And everybody showed up and it was awesome. Uh, the next day we went to the Broncos game and then this was the morning we were going to drive down to Colorado Springs. We were like, well, we got to work off all the booze. We drank at the Broncos game, so we decided to go on this fucking hike. All right. All right, I'm back on track here. So we go into the, into the wilderness with no weapons or anything. And you know, I'm nervous. I mean that lady run it by made me feel good, but for half a second, I'm like, cause she running from a mountain lion because people where I'm from in their, in their early thirties can't run that fast.

Speaker 1:          00:12:46       So we go up the hill and it's just amazing. It's fucking amazing. Like it's so beautiful. You're like whispering like, oh my God, look at those fucking, I don't really have a view like that type of shit. Right. But I'm also nervous, like, uh, I just got this feeling like, I don't know, like I just don't want to get my face ripped off. I mean, call me weird. Call me a coward. I don't give a shit. Getting mauled is not on my bucket list. Okay. That just sounds so much worse than getting stabbed and shot because it like get you need stabbed and shot from the, unless you get riddled or stabbed multiple times, for the most part, you have a wound, but it's in one area, one of your limbs, hearts, the other three can still use you get mauled. That is just an all encompass encompassing. Like it's like you went through a paper shredder. Alright, I don't need that. So,

Speaker 3:          00:13:41       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:13:41       We're, we're about half hour into the hike and I'm like, wow. I'm a half hour into the rocky mountains with no fucking weapon. And my guide is a fellow standup comedian. So we decided to sit down on these rocks. I'm like, let's sit down. Just take a break because we're fucking winded because we're middle aged guys, we're out of shape and we're a mile high in Denver or whatever folder. So we sit down on these rocks and I'm like nervous looking around making sure there's nothing deciding to fucking pounce on me. And all of a sudden I hear a car drive by and I'm like, what the fuck? And like a hundred yards away, there's like a road.

Speaker 1:          00:14:24       And then I looked over another 20 feet and there was like a picnic table. So I have a deli, there's fucking trail we were going on. This isn't like some deep forest shit like we pulled off the road. Evidently we could've just kept driving and gone all the way up to the top. So in the trail were on crosses the road a couple of times. So we're totally fine for the most part. So I see the picnic table and I pointed it to Jason. We just start fucking laughing cause was sitting down on these rocks like Lewis and Clark and we're in the middle of nowhere and we're, we're, we're fucking, we're right there. We're in the middle of silvers. Civilization. Long story short, we get all the way up to the top.

Speaker 4:          00:15:02       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:15:02       Um, we're standing on these rocks were looking down, actually looking down into, why was it Findlay stadium, whatever, with uh, the buffaloes play absolutely gorgeous, was so high up, we could see the Denver, the skyline in Denver. It was fucking awesome. So we start walking back and uh, we're coming down the trail and it's really loose kind of dirt and we keep slipping, but we're all right. You know, we keep regaining our balance. At one point, La had slips to the point where I thought he was going down and then he was able to recover. You know, he was an athlete and I said, I said, hey, go. That was nice. You can see you, you know, you played hoop yet, you've got an athletic background. I said, had you been Joe de Rosa? Um, I'd be carrying it down off the mountain. And we were sitting there laughing at Joe. Right? Cause that's the kind of friend I am. I throw my friends under the bus when they're not there to defend themselves. So,

Speaker 4:          00:15:54       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:15:54       When you know, Karma comes back and bites me in the ass like a fucking minute later, I'm standing there taking a picture of something and I go and I take a step or two, dude, and I'm telling you, it's like somebody took my legs out. I didn't even know what happened. I just fell and I landed on a rock. Like first of all, my, my elbow scraped first on my right arm and it pushed my, it like hyper extended. Like I almost snapped my fucking humorous and all I was doing was falling from a standing position down to the ground in the dirt. But they just happened to be this fucking rock there. Um, and I almost, and I think I would have broke it, but fortunately the rest of my body hit the, the other part of the rock basically. Just imagine jumping up in the air. So you're horizontal and then just landing on the rock with like a baseball size part of your back. Dude, I wish I could recreate the, the fucking noise I made.

Speaker 4:          00:16:57       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:17:00       And I, that was it. I was just down and I was down for like a good 10 seconds, you know, like when when somebody gets knocked out or knocked down when that boxing and they kind of sit back up at four seconds, but they wait until the nine and a half seconds.

Speaker 4:          00:17:15       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:17:15       Mark to fucking stand back up. That's what I did and lie. I was going like, dude, you are right. You are right. And I kept saying, yeah and I wasn't. And uh, so I start walking down the hill and um, I'm kind of laughing because I feel like a fucking idiot. But laughing at this point hurts because I guess you use those muscles in your back Ed. Uh, I dunno. About 30 seconds later la heads going, yeah dude, I can see blood coming through your fucking tee shirt at a, yeah, it was gross by the time I got down to the bottom, like my fucking tee shirt was like stuck to my back and uh, you know, but it wasn't bleeding profile. It was more like the cut was more like a scrape because after I landed on the Rock, I then slid down it.

Speaker 1:          00:18:08       So I lifted up my shirt and I go, how bad is it? And I knew it was going to be bad cause I knew what I did. And not to mention I'm a pasty fucking redhead and we don't bruise. We look like, you know where somebody with pigment would look like they had a bad bruise. We look like we got bitten by like a fucking Maaco Shark. That's basically what I look like. Um, and uh, you know, I shook it off, went to the pharmacy, got some Neosporin, slapped it on my elbow, left it off the back, figured it back was fine. And then I went and I got a salad and that was my fucking Denver Story. How was that? So, uh, my back has been killing me the last couple of days and a, it's weird when I, the only time it hurts is when I go to stand up and I got to make a noise.

Speaker 1:          00:18:53       I'll make the noise for you here. Let me see if I can get it. It hurts. Oh, of course. Now it doesn't hurt. I think I did it. I freed it up. All right. That was a big, that was like Geraldo looking into that safe. Sorry about that. Um, anyways, let's get to some fucking advertising for this week. Every one.

Speaker 1:          00:22:13       You know, I touched on there, I mentioned some of that serious stuff about them. Uh, so theoria are you Syria? Um, I mentioned that, uh, you know, what's the deal there? That they got a little, uh, against some shit there for gas and their own people. I don't understand that whole thing of if you don't sign a treaty saying that you're not going to guess other people or I guess maybe they did. I tried to figure out whether they did or not and I got onto this colored map of the world where they had people who signed it, people who signed it and said to hell with it and people who never signed it and then people who sort of signed it and there was all these colors and these graphs. I can't figure out if they signed it or not, but let's just say for the sake of the argument that they went to the Geneva protocol in 1949 and they decided that they were going to sign that thing and they weren't going to gas people.

Speaker 1:          00:23:06       Now as far as how it's written, isn't it written that basically you're not going to get, you don't guess our people and we won't guess your people, but is, is there anything in there that says you can't gas your own people? We're not saying you can, you should do it, but those are your people. Right? Like if I go out and buy myself a new outfit, you know, to show off my thick. Yeah, there's nothing preventing me. Says I can't go out and go jump in a mud puddle. Right. This is my fucking clothes. Now, if I take those clothes off and then throw them in some old lady's face now, now there's a problem. But if I just roll around in that mud puddle, I'm just doing damage to myself, aren't I?

Speaker 1:          00:23:47       I don't fucking know how dumb do I sound right now? Well, you know when you're done tow, fuck you. It's a legitimate question. I don't understand why you can't gas people. He can't do that. But you can fucking firebomb cities and you can straight people. You know you can do area bombing. Oops. Did that land on a nursery with babies? Why can you do that? You know what it is? I think it's too easy. I get it. Chemical weaponry. That's like the PE Dee of of mass murder. All right. No, just send. That's what it is. Being able to gas people, that's like everybody gets their own ribbon. Okay. You know what, I worked at out, you don't need to write in, but if you want to write in, I'd love to talk about it. Something fucking different as you see that, that story ESPN had that they ran with, I guess very little facts at least according to the very pissed off woman that I wrote, I read her little article about it. They were trying to claim that Bobby Riggs through that match against Billie Jean King. I'm showing my age here. I mean, I don't remember when this shit happened, but back in the 70s, they had the battle of the sexes and Bobby Riggs, a former champion, 55 fucking years old, plays Billie Jean King 29, the number one seated woman's player in the world at the time. And uh, he played her and he lost. And evidently that was some sort of big thing for women that a woman in her prime could beat an old man at Tennessee.

Speaker 1:          00:25:17       So now somebody was trying to claim that was fixed. It sounded like bullshit that he threw the match because the saying that I guess he played the number two woman in the world and beat her handily. But there's a big difference between number two and number one as you saw yesterday with a Serena and uh, what's her face that she played? They fucking battled for the first two sets and then Serena just took over. It was like, fuck this. You know, it's so fucking hilarious about Serena Williams is when she's playing tennis. I swear to God, it's just raw. Like she doesn't make too many noises, but she just looks like I would duck if she hit the ball. You know, it's like a fucking linebacker out there. Right. But then the second she wins the match, she turns into a girl again, like, oh my God, she, if it's like our one hand up and starts waving, jumping up and down, really girly, like, but when she's playing the game, I swear to God, it's like she could fucking kill somebody. So she's playing this other lady and I'm telling you, they were playing like dude's,

Speaker 1:          00:26:20       there was some volleys to couple times. They went to the net, but pretty much they would just at the baseline, just power shots, fucking home run hits. I'll tell you, I was watching the packers 40 niners and I started flipping over just to see, you know, I mean, how often do you get to see a legend? Plain. I mean, she went, she just want her 18th major I think so she's closing in on Steffi Graf and then after Steffi Graf, is that Australian broad? I forget her name. I know the guy. What is it? Not Stan Smith. Rod Laver. He's won the most of any guy. The fuck's her name, Margaret or meg. She's got some one of those old people fucking m names, so she's closing in on her. So I wanted to watch a little bit of that and it was a fucking great match. I had a fuck that I get on with this, but whatever that is, you know that that's always bugged me.

Speaker 1:          00:27:10       That Bobby Riggs thing, when Billie Jean beat Bobby Riggs, like that proves something. See Women in the prime of their life are just as good as men whose Dick's don't really work anymore and are in the early stages of prostate cancer. They can beat us at badminton, a faster game of badminton. So I dunno, so some, some woman wrote this article, you know, it doesn't matter whether it was fixed or not, it doesn't matter any more. Like the problem with women is they actually give a shit what guys say, you gotta be like, guys, if you really want to become free of men, this is what you have to do. Two things. You have to stop giving a fuck what we say. You have to talk down to us more. And then what you have to do is you have to start your own shit. The problem with women, how many my pissing off right now is you keep trying to join our shit.

Speaker 1:          00:28:10       You know, we have a gym, we have the water buffaloes club and there's no women allowed. You should be like, great, get the fuck out of the house. Go down there the same way we would do you think we give a fuck that you'd have a women's only gym? Go down there, do a double session, get the fuck Outta, I don't care. Especially now with all these great ways of tape and TV, you can watch all these fucking games by all means. You know, beat it. Beat it. Right? You don't just get Outta here, you guys, you got to start having that fucking attitude because that's, that's, that's the genius of guys is we act like we don't give a fuck about you but we till, but we act like we don't and we act like what we're going to go do. We're excited about it.

Speaker 1:          00:28:59       And you guys drink that Koolaid and you actually think what we're doing is exciting. So you want to become a part of it. You want to join a dump gyms, right? You want to join a fucking golf clubs because you think there's something going on that you think you're actually missing out on something you're not. She punches stupid guys walking around scratching at Dick's. Every other fucking sentence. Why would you want to be around them? I don't want to be up on a bunch of women, like I don't even know what you guys talk about. To me, it sounds like a bunch of birds fighting over a French fry. I don't want to listen to that shit. All right. I love art. Like I'm berating a guys out of fucking nowhere. I thought, I thought I was beyond this in my life. Evidently I'm not. Um, all right, let's plow ahead here. Everybody. You know what? I did this this week. I really watched the offensive line of the New England patriots. That's what I did. And uh,

Speaker 1:          00:29:53       I actually liked what I saw it, man. I thought they were protected time really well. And I think if you're a true, if you're a true football fan, if you're to true your team, you should know your offensive line to the point where you're actually recognize them when they go down the street. You know, if you actually know what who, what Ryan Wendell looks like, where Dan Klein, Lee Logan Mankins, nobody knows these fucking guys need sold my AA. Not, they've seen the fucking names where, cause you never hear him. You know why? Because they never get busted for holding Sebastian Vollmer. Right. I actually paid attention to the offensive line this week was the first time in 30 years of watching football, 35 fucking years. I actually noticed in the huddle how they're lined up, how the offensive line is lined up, where they just turn right around there, right in position. And it's like, of course they are bill you dumb. Fuck the clock is ticking. What do you think? They just all go into the huddle all willy nilly. Is that because you never played organized football? I played for a few weeks. I actually played for a few weeks. This is kind of a sad story. And then Darryl Stingley got paralyzed and my parents got freaked out and they, they, uh,

Speaker 1:          00:31:04       actually I've got to tell you, uh, you know, they had the foresight to see what I was doing in my brain playing football and they also saw my athletic abilities. So it's just like, you know, they were like, he's already kind of dumb and, uh, he's not the most athletic person, so why would we want them to sit here smashing his head to another third graders head? Let's have him play baseball game. Hey about those red sox. Huh? God dammit. I wish I was watching baseball this year. You know, excited. I would be, I'm not going to lie to you. I'm going to jump on the band wagon come October. I always watch October baseball. Anyways. I love it. Like, I don't know if they have extra microphones or whatever, but there's just the sounds of the ballpark is better. But uh, you know, take it three out of four from the Yankees.

Speaker 1:          00:31:49       That's pretty fucking impressive. And I, and I really am kind of amazed at the fact that that trade with the Dodgers worked out for both teams. That's so rare and a blockbuster trade that it works for both people that should have been like great for one team and horrific for the other or as certain as such for both teams. Like that's what usually happens in a blockbuster trade. Either works for nobody. I bill, you just said it. You don't need to repeat it, but very rare does it work out for football teams? I don't know why those superstars started playing for the Dodgers, but I'm glad they did. I've always liked the Dodgers and uh, I'm glad that we, uh, saved a bunch of fucking money in whoever the hell we have on our team. He's evidently playing fucking great. Could I say evidently one more fucking time this podcast? Um, evidently I can shoot, uh, let's plow ahead here. Uh, oh, I was watching some greater youtube videos last night. Um, I've become obsessed. Let me see. I don't even know his fucking name is great. I've become obsessed with them. I don't even know his fucking name. Where the hell is it? A for God's sakes,

Speaker 1:          00:33:07       what the fuck is this guy's name? You know what? I just, this is, this is why right here. I at some point need to bring somebody else into the fucking fault so I can actually,

Speaker 2:          00:33:22       okay,

Speaker 1:          00:33:22       where is it? Here we go. Put this on here and then we hit mute. So enough to pay any money for the fucking song.

Speaker 2:          00:33:31       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:33:31       With a, God dammit all there it is. I become obsessed with this drummer, raw James Gadson. He basically, a lot of people, if you're a bill withers fan, I highly recommend downloading us. Still still bill. That's incredible fucking album. Bill withers is one of the greatest singers of all time and I also think unbelievably underrated as a singer. And uh, he's got this killer drummer James Gadson and just, I don't know, that guy just doesn't get the attention he deserves. So long story short, I started, you know, youtube and him and watching him play does not a lot of stuff on them. There's a lot of, uh, videos and shit of interviews with them and that led me to one of those great youtube runs. Well, you don't end up on a slap fight. You actually stuck to learn stuff. And I came across this other drummer,

Speaker 2:          00:34:24       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:34:24       Like Fred, Fred Bellow of, I don't know how to say his fucking name, which led me to this concert film

Speaker 1:          00:34:33       and Otis rush singing, I can't quit. You baby. Um, that led Zeppelin raids did a remake of called, I can't quit you babe, as opposed to I can't quit you baby. So that's how they switched it up. And then that's why they never paid Otis rush until they settled out of court. I don't know if that's true, if they had to settle out of court with them. I know they had to do that a couple of times. But uh, Otis Rush, one of the greatest live singers I ever heard and he plays guitar lefthanded and he doesn't string it. He plays a right hand and guitar upside down and did not string it the other way. He just plays it upside down strong, right handed. And the only other guy I knew who did that was, uh, was Dick Dale. I didn't know there was someone else who did it, but he's fucking unbelievable. I'm going to send you a link to this concert concert film, uh, the podcast this week cause you really should see it. It should know about this guy, a case you don't know about them. And, uh, and also I want to know what concert does, is if anybody has any information on it and how somehow I can watch the whole concert because it's crazy. It starts with, you know,

Speaker 1:          00:35:42       this older black dude who's like playing like Boogie woogie piano and he see he's part of that generation and then it kind of leads into these guys who were more R and B guys and it's right before a,

Speaker 2:          00:35:53       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:35:54       I Dunno, it seems, it's like right around that time, right as James Brown was coming out or whatever. But it's just a great period where people can actually play music and shit, play instruments and sing live. It's fucking awesome. And then the, they're playing performing of course, to this horrific white crowd that is just sitting there like their entire lives have been mapped out in front of them and they made no decisions and they have no passion in life. I don't know what it is. It's fucking embarrassing, but it's incredible concert footage. All right. I'm done. Run in my fucking mouth. Let's go to, uh, let's go to some of your questions and information this week. Uh, I got a ton of shit last week by saying a port, a pork shoulder was actually the ass of the pig. I guess it actually is the shoulder. I guess a Christmas Ham is the ass or you can eat it on thanksgiving. Just say Ha. Ham is the ass of the pig. So this guy says, Bill, I love your podcast. I'm a former butcher and I wanted to correct you on your smoke shoulder comment on yesterday's podcast. A pork shoulder is the front shoulder on a pig. The confusing part is they are also called pork butts. It's not the, but the butter. The pig is the ham. Hope this helps. Um, blah, blah, blah. Well, you know, what can you write back? Why do they call it a, but then

Speaker 1:          00:37:09       I have no idea why. Why do they call it that? All I know is it's fucking delicious. As is the acid. The pig. I eat the whole fucking pig. Wherever the fuck the Bacon is,

Speaker 1:          00:37:21       you know, that'd be, do they have classes like that? Do they have a class that teaches you how to butcher an animal in case you know, whenever the dollar collapses and I'm out there, I mean, I know how to shoot a bow and arrow. Now I know how to fucking gut a fish pretty well, but I'd like to know how to fucking shoot a wild pig. Hey, fuck this. I'm on the Billy red state tour people. I'm coming out to El Paso. I'm coming out to San Antonio. If anybody out there it goes wild boar hunting. I want to do that shit. I want to do it, but I don't want to fucking kill one just for the sake of killing it. All right? I want to fucking kill it. Clean it, do the whole fucking thing. You make me do all of this shit. Uh, I know animal lovers out there probably don't like it.

Speaker 1:          00:38:02       I'm, I'm doing it not to do it all the fucking time. I want to have that skill. All right? Basically, I'm slowly, I want to become macgyver. I want to not firing on to shoot a fish with a bow and arrow sort of. Okay. I know what a loaded gun and shoot it sort of, I got some vegetables growing and Rhonda, my house Kinda. So if I know how to take down a fucking pig, got that fucking thing, it's got to translate to a god damn deer. Right. Sort of the same shit I would think.

Speaker 2:          00:38:34       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:38:34       Then all I to do was get a helicopter

Speaker 2:          00:38:36       license and I'm good to go. I know how to ride a motorcycle now. You see what I'm saying? So you got fucking, if he have a helicopter that like what I love about the helicopter is you just go right up. You can escape so easily. It's almost like you literally know how to fly. We're like, you know, with an airplane you need that run and start, you know. Oh fucking though. But anyway, so somebody who wants to take me wild boar hunting, I would fucking do that. And as second I go down to ll bean and show of my brand new, I'm going hunting shit, looking like fucking, you know, like those old Vietnam movies when you first get there and you buckle your Chin strap to your helmet. And then all of grizzled veteran veterans tell you not to do it. Cuts the concussive force of the shells is gonna blow your fucking head off. That type of stuff. But what are you talking about? I don't know. I want to shoot a pig,

Speaker 1:          00:39:27       you know, fucking great. That would be, take that fucker down. Wait. Alright. Take that fucker down. Clean it. Bring the fucking meat home and then smoke it on my fucking grill. How much of a man I would feel like how much cowardice I could fucking push down that I have the pussy. Pardon me would really be shut down and I wouldn't have to listen to those voices in my head. And for a few minutes I could actually act like I was actually a stud.

Speaker 2:          00:39:55       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:39:56       Hey, fuck you. I have my dreams, you know. All right. Whatever. 40 minutes. Then here we go. This time to read some, some of your letters. Uh, seriously. Fuck your American sports. Another positive email here. Hi Bill. Big Fan. Got Tickets to see you in London in December. I got to take a time out here. Ah, the response to a, some of my shows, pretty much all of them over there has been unbelievable in Europe. And I can't thank you guys enough. Uh, we added a show in London, added a show in Helsinki. How crazy is that? And some promoter and Astonia just asked me to add, I'm not going to be able to do it this time, but I'm doing it next time. And uh, it's been unbelievable. So, uh, I'm really, really excited to go over there. I'm going to and this time rather than just go in there and landing and, uh, you know, being a Zombie during the day, I'm coming over like three, three, four days early to, uh, get acclimated. I'm going to actually go to Italy. I haven't decided where yet, but, uh, I'm just going to go there and eat

Speaker 2:          00:41:05       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:41:05       And, uh, I'm going to try and see an opera when I'm there and some old opera house. I don't have too much time to go there.

Speaker 1:          00:41:14       I don't think I want to go to Rome and go to the see the Roman Colosseum. I feel like that's going to times square. That's what I've learned in my travel. You like, you go to New Orleans, I guess you have to see Bourbon Street, but you really don't want to be down there. That's just a bunch of drunk tourists which you want to go down is uh, you know, you know what, I'm not going to tell you the cool places to go. You gotta go there and talk to the locals cause I don't want to fuck up the locals. Good places to go. It's kind of like, you know, I stayed at one of the greatest fucking hotels I've ever stayed at when I was in Colorado and uh, I'm not going to tell you guys where it is because I don't want to ruin it. If you just by dumb luck discover it is fucking amazing. We stayed at this place if for dinner we had lamb, an elk, and uh, and was this quiet town off the beaten path and they had this little fucking bar that we went to.

Speaker 1:          00:42:16       We're like, the bartender wasn't even behind the bar. She was over in the middle of shooting pool. One of those kinds of things. And for the first time in my life, like country music made sense. I finally realized, I knew Willie Nelson was good. I didn't know he was that good. All right. And I went up to the fucking jukebox and I just started every fucking legendary country guy that I knew. You know, I throw in a couple of fucking rock songs or whatever, but you know, Merle Haggard, all these guys and I, and I wouldn't pick, they'd have their greatest hits. I wouldn't go off that. I go off, I pick a different album then pick like the third track rather than the first track. Cause they usually lead with the radio hit. I wanted to hear something different dude. And I fucking loved it. So, uh, but then when it was weird, I got to La and I tried to download some Willie Nelson and didn't feel the same way, you know, so I'm going to download some fucking, some of that shit for my drive from El Paso to San Antonio this week.

Speaker 1:          00:43:14       Uh, play in El Paso on Thursday and then San Antonio on Friday. Uh, there's still some tickets left in El Paso. I mean they picked a really big place because, uh, it was either play a little place, there was data, they didn't have the middle ground one. So we just picked a big place. I don't know if they're going to close out the balcony, whatever, but there's definitely tickets left. Um, but then after that I drive down to San Antonio, listen to this fucking amazing week. And then Saturday I'm hanging around and I'm going, me and oversee of going on. A couple of other buddies were going to go to the, uh, Texas a and M Alabama game, going to go see Johnny football go up against one of the great fucking

Speaker 1:          00:43:57       college football teams. I mean that the run that Alabama's on his fucking insane being an Lsu fan and fucking annoys the shit out of me. But, uh, you can't not appreciate it. So we're going to go to that game and that's going to be our week. So, uh, anyways, so I'm trying to do more of that type of stuff when I do the road. And as a comic it's great because you get excited to go on the road when you plan shit like that and it, if you're excited, you don't dry up, you just don't start hating your act and you don't end up like just saying fuck it and hosting a game show, not to say there's anything with that. And not to say that I would never host a game, show them that might become a point my fucking career where I just can't do it anymore.

Speaker 1:          00:44:38       And I'll go on and I'll fucking host card sharks. The dope card sharks with bill burr all a bit higher. You got arrest all of it. Here we go. And that can be fun. You know what's great about being a game show host? You know you got a fucking fat ass fucking house with an in ground pool and at that point who gives a shit, right? And every fucking woman who comes on the show, they fucking, they, they, they, I don't know. They make you feel special. Oh my God. I watch his show every day. Fucking kiss you on the cheek, or you can be a pervert like Richard Dawson and kiss him on the mouth. Man. Uh, who knows? I might do that. When I get a little older, I still got some fight me. All right. This business hasn't dragged me in the boat yet. I'm on the hook without a doubt. They're reeling me in, but I'm not on the boat yet. They haven't, they haven't fucking club me yet. So, um, yeah, so that's my thing. I'm going to go to fucking Italy and I'm going to go see an opera. Bring a little fucking handkerchief there and hope I actually, it moves me rather than sitting there going like,

Speaker 5:          00:45:42       dude, I don't get what they're talking about. Why? See, so fat dude, that skinny chick would never hook up with that fat guy.

Speaker 1:          00:45:49       I don't want to be that dude. So anyways, let's get to the question here. Uh, I'm in the UK, I listen to your podcast and I hear the names of these little teams and games that you have, uh, that you have there. So last night I'm going to bed and um, I've been slowly growing this tiny amount of gambling money, just small change, just so just for fun. And I thought I'd drop it on him. I drop it on a banker that was played while I slept and then I have a little bit of interest in the morning. Okay. This guy. So I like this guy. He's, he's doing his little train spotting slang here and I'm trying to figure it out. Drop it on a bank or, I mean, do you want to put money on the game so you putting up money on a game overseas and while you're asleep and you're going to wake up and see if you made any money or not. Wow. Dude, you just took gambling to a whole of year of fucking international gambler dude. You have like a fucking white Tuxedo that you get up and put on like Roger Moore.

Speaker 3:          00:46:46       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:46:47       That's kind of fucking fun.

Speaker 3:          00:46:49       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:46:50       That's actually, you know, for people to have a serious gambling problem, they probably didn't need to know that because the only time of serious gamblers, not gambling is probably when he's going to sleep. This mother Fucker is sin. So God damn DP figured out a way though it, I commend you and I also feel bad for you, sir. That's fucking amazing. So anyways, he goes, I went to my bookmakers, but bookmakers site inside the Yankees being the Red Sox, eight to three, they were giving odds on the Red Sox, nine to one in a two horse race and a one to 100 on the Yankees. So I put the equivalent of $30 on the Yankees and thought, ah fuck, it's an extra 30 cents I'll have in the morning. So wait a, you can bet on a game that's already going. So it's eight to three two, why wouldn't you take in the fucking, oh, you did take the Yankees, right? Wait, the Yankees were being the red sox. Eight to three I got, oh, I'm dumb people. I get to work this out. They were giving odds on the red sox nine to one. Okay, so you got to put up 900 bucks to make a hundred at that point or $9 to make one bill. They took out the Zeros, they tried to make it easy for you. And then the Yankees, you throw down a dollar, you can make a hundred

Speaker 1:          00:48:03       so you said fuck it. There's no way the Yankees are going to lose.

Speaker 1:          00:48:09       And let's see, you could have made 30 cents. You put down what? 300 bucks? Is that how it works? What'd you put down? Three, three bucks. You put down three bucks. It's cheap. Fuck your bitch in about three bucks a fucker. What's going on in this? So anyways, he said, what? What the fuck? Sort of Mickey Mouse Bullshit team or the Yankees to fuck that up so bad. It's brutal. Losing 30 well 30 bucks, losing 30 bucks trying to win 30 cents do the math doesn't oh yeah, that's right. That's right. Yeah. Okay, great. 30 cents. Imagine I could be fighting in a war alongside you guys with a bag of live hand grenades on my back. Yeah, dude, I don't know how you made the lept from the leap from fucking, uh, that game to fighting in a war.

Speaker 2:          00:48:59       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:49:00       I don't know what kind of fucking asshole goes to sleep trying to make 30 cents serves your right. Your cheap fucker. You should have bet the under dog. Oh wait, you did? No you didn't. You bet the favorite. Well, you know what your deal is, you guys overseas, all you know is the Yankees the same way over here. All we know is a, what the fuck are they a man United? That's the only team we know. I mean, I know some of the arsenal, uh, or arsenal, I don't know Liverpool, but I don't know what they're called. I just know man United, Manchester United. That's all I fucking know. And you know what? I don't like them cause this shit's over here and they're like the fucking, I dunno. I don't want, I don't like the team that everybody likes, you know, fucked him. So I'm sorry sir.

Speaker 1:          00:49:45       I'm sorry. You lost $30 trying to make 30 cents. Would that even by a half a fucking cup of tea or whatever the fuck you going to do over there by your one chip for your fish and chip fucking breakfast. Um, anyways, but either way, dude, thanks for buying tickets to the uh, the London show. Uh, like I said, it really is humbling to have that. If I can use that fucking phrase without getting trashed, it really is that people over there give a shit and want to come out. So I hope I'm funny. I'm all right. Ken Burns. Dear Billy boy, I heard you talking about the Ken Burns documentary recently and why don't you turn on, turn you on to one of his documentaries that I've yet to see but I hear is great. Um, and for those of you have been listening the past few weeks, I've been slowly, when I have the time getting through a Ken Burns the war, it's all about World War II.

Speaker 1:          00:50:35       I think I'm through five episodes. It's a seven part series and it is absolutely fucking incredible. The footage. I think a lot of the footage, like they wouldn't show for the longest time, like the really shows the, uh, it's, it's not a propaganda film. Put it that way. It's, it's an absolutely astounding thing to watch. It's so amazing. It's actually caused me to, I'm starting to read, not only read but read about the war and for dummy like me to actually want to go out and start reading books. Um, although I had to take a break because it was so fucking heavy, some of the shit, uh, than, uh, right now I'm reading a, that guy from ministry and reading his autobiography and if you want to feel better about some of the choices you've made in life, like maybe you think I'm a piece of shit.

Speaker 1:          00:51:27       I did this, I did that. I partied too much. You got to read this guy's book. You're going to feel like you don't have any sort of substance abuse problem. I'm not shitting on the guy. The guy's a fucking genius. Um, and I'm totally late to the party when it comes to great music from the 80s. I listened to so much shit music in the 80s, and uh, I completely missed out on all this amazing stuff that was going on. Ministry being one of them. And what's funny is the song that I liked the best, he hates and says he hates it because the people who like it or like people who were into metal, uh, it's Stigmata I fucking love it. And I like it because it sounds like a metal song with all this in a industrial shit. Don't, I don't even know anything about it. He would cringe if he heard any of this, but I actually had to put the book down and started laughing cause he totally called me out as I'm reading the book. Uh, he used to say no, there was just a throwaway song. But anyways, it's on this album called the land of rape and honey, which is an avid, it was a, I guess as a fucking classic and I never heard anything about it because I was listening to Motley Crue theater of pain when that came out.

Speaker 1:          00:52:39       Um, so anyways, so he says, let me get back to this. So he says, Ken Burns has another great documentary. By the way, I'm watching all, I'm watching all of Ken Burns' documentaries, uh, on Netflix. Uh, I've, I'm doing civil war next, but this guy's actually suggesting, uh, he's, uh, there's a new one called prohibition. He goes, I haven't seen it yet because I'm in the middle of a book about prohibition, but I find the whole subject fascinating, not only because it talks about how the majority of the working class were drunks, but it gets all into the politics and cultural issues associated with drinking back in the day and how the breweries changed America. Also, Merck also, there are many similarities to the whole weed movement we see nowadays. Uh, did you ever find yourself in a dry county or a state where you can't find a beer in the grocery store with some of our alcohol related laws can be traced back to prohibition and the crazy shit that caused it are drunk and forefathers.

Speaker 1:          00:53:36       Uh, you know, it's funny, dude, you're just like me. You spent, you spelled fore fathers, f, O, u, R as in one, two, three, four. Isn't it for free? I don't know. Fuck it now. Uh, our drunken forefathers would get out of their industrial jobs at the end of the day. Look to decompress a bit and stay in pubs all night. Soon enough, these guys started bringing home STDs to their wives and banging all the horrors that also stayed in the pubs all night. Their wives started getting upset and fast forward a bit and then you have prohibition. Some guys just ruined it for everyone really. Well, I knew it kind of came out of the church. Uh, I didn't know that. I just heard somebody say that and I took it as law. Um, thanks for the heads up and thanks to everybody. Seriously when you guys write in yet, actually, yeah, I know we fuck around a lot of this thing, but when you have something there that will actually make you a more informed person or actually it's a great piece of entertainment.

Hairy situation here that did something he shouldn't have done and he's waiting for the other shoe to drop or a, he hooked up with a beautiful girl who's going, oh, natural rail.

Speaker 1:          00:57:48       Old Age. All right. Hey Bill. Funny show. Great. That's what he'd just started with. No punctuation whatsoever whatsoever. Hey, Bill. Funny show. Great. All right. Maybe this guy's from overseas or maybe he's down south and you can make it thereby land. Who knows? He goes, I have a question for your mm. Podcasts. My girlfriend, who I've lived with for the last seven years is starting to constantly ask me to shave my chest. Oh, I went the other way. Oh, you went the other way? Um, I'm pretty hairy, but not fucking Chewbacca Harry. Just mainly my chest. This is not a problem, but sometimes she won't have sex with me until I do. Whoa. All right. That's, that's a, okay. That's red flag number one for me.

Speaker 3:          00:58:35       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:58:37       Unless you're, you're not perceptive as to, uh, how Harry your chest is a, it can take over an hour to properly to do properly. And sometimes I can't be fucked after a hard day's work, so I just rub one out. I know times change because in the 70s, Harry was sexy, but now every pop stars dying to look more like a woman. I swear Justin Bieber is prettier than half the women. I Bang. What do you think? Um, yeah, that whole manscape looked I guess is supposed to be in. I have no idea. But um, I find it odd.

Speaker 3:          00:59:15       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:59:15       I don't find it odd that you're, you're girlfriend is asking to uh, you know, maybe trim down your chest a little bit, but the fact that she won't even have sex with you, um, I dunno what happened.

Speaker 3:          00:59:32       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:59:32       Did some pervert with the fucking full full chest of hair fucking lay down on top of her and do something to her. Like that's kind of weird to me. Like how do you think she would feel if you were like, Hey, can you a, I dunno, trim up here or there or I literally can't have sex with you. That's kind of fucked up. She's really making you jump through some hoops there. Um, so you're either way hairier than you're letting on. I get women being grossed out by back here, you know, especially those guys who have it like up on their shoulders and then they just have like the two patches just above the kidney and just below the shoulder blade. This, those two, like they got, I dunno, like they got hugged by someone who jerked off too much.

Speaker 1:          01:00:22       Um, I would sit down with her and just be like, listen, I'm not going to say I'm not going to fucking shape my chest, but it's kind of weird to me that if I don't, you don't even find me sexually attractive. I mean, what do you, are you having sex with my chest or you end to me. I mean, I could see if this is a one night stand, you're like, listen, I'm into this. I'm not into that. Do this, do this. And for the love of God, shut the fuck up. All right. And you have your little grocery list on how you need, what you need me to do to get you there. I get that. But if I'm in a fucking relationship with you, you know, that's, that's kind of a, but you know, you didn't really even ask that. I don't even know what the fuck he asked me. Um,

Speaker 3:          01:01:02       okay.

Speaker 1:          01:01:03       It takes you an hour to do it. Don't they have like those fucking things you can just kind of, I know that's weird. That's fucking weird to me. I would, I would do, that would be my biggest concern. I would be asking her like what? You can't even have sex with me? I know what I understand on your face because some women have sensitive skin, you know, and when you know, if you're on top of her missionary style hood, you know, pumping away, if you're out of shape, you land your head right down next.

Speaker 1:          01:01:38       You can get a little razor burn other side of the face. I understand that if you have like, you have like a beard, if you have whiskers, I I fucking get that shit. Can I just do that again and I'm not going to do it. Cause some people that it might hurt your fucking ears. Um, I understand that. But chest hair, why don't you, why don't you come up with like a, a compromise. Be like, all right, how bout if my chest is to Harry, we still bang. I just do it. Doggy style. I promise. After I get to where I need to go, I won't collapse down on top of you making you feel like, you know, Burt Reynolds just got out of the pool and is using you to towel off. I won't do that. Okay. Maybe you could do or just sit down with her and just be like, listen, I'm not trying to be a dick here.

Speaker 1:          01:02:23       What is your issue with Harry Chess? And uh, cause it's, you know, I, you know, it's funny, I'm getting more weirded out by it by then. You are, I'm probably putting bad ideas and he had, so I'm just going to shut the fuck up. I'm all right. Military history. Ah, this is a great one. Hey, grateful read. Ah, I love it. Just when you think they've run out of creative ways. Ah, that's a good one. Uh, the past couple of shows you mentioned you enjoy reading about World War II. Just wanted to give you a couple of recommendations. First I'd like to mention, uh, Oh, before he gets going. I, I read that book a fly boys, which I swear to God is not about boy bands. It was by, I forget who wrote it. Uh, Jesus Christ on the worst, the same day I did flags of our fathers, um, wrote the same thing. Anyways, the past couple of shows you mentioned blah, blah, Blah books on World War II. Going to give you a couple of recommendations. First I'd like to mention Dan Carlin's part podcast, hardcore history. I'm telling you it's right up your alley, dude. Good call. I'm listening to that. He's covered many aspects of history from the bronze age to the relatively modern age. If he can make the bronze age, which I don't even know what that is.

Speaker 3:          01:03:38       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:03:38       Like, uh, I, I can't deal with it. You know, you'll leave people I can really read about.

Speaker 3:          01:03:46       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:03:46       From way back in the day, which is basically anything before cowboys and Indians is you have to be a mass murdering psychopath. Like I can read about these, the inquisitions, uh, or the inquisition. I don't fucking know if it's plural or not. I agreed about that. Gaviscon oh, I could read about, um, Attila the hun.

Speaker 3:          01:04:08       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:04:08       You know, basically the original scarfaces I could read about those guys. And, uh, but other shit, you know, ancient medieval history and the fucking Lilliputians we're going up against the fucking, uh, Persian empire. I don't, fuck, I, I dunno, I can't deal with that shit. Um, so if he can make that interesting, I, I dunno, maybe I could listen to enough of it and actually sound intelligent. Who knows. So anyways, he says, uh, but I suggest is series ghosts ghosts of the the what does that asked front? It's the mind blowing, but little talked about conflict between the Russians and the Germans. Yeah, they really do skip over that. Um, in fact a lot of few people don't live in this country. A lot of what they talk about when World War II, they do talk about Pearl Harbor, which set the whole thing off, but there's very, they don't talk even about the Japanese that much. It kind of Pearl Harbor. Uh, they were winning at first battle of midway and then we're dropping the two fucking bombs and that's it. And then you watch jaws and you hear about the Indianapolis right signature and may go into water. Dad, [inaudible] all we eat away to go home. And that's how you learn. Right? But they mainly talk about fighting the Germans and mainly d day.

Speaker 2:          01:05:29       Hmm.

Speaker 1:          01:05:29       Basically from France going right into German concentration camp, Schindler's list. All right. Hitler killed himself in the bunker game set match, wipe your hands of it all right. Then we're immediately into the Cold War. But they also ignore, you know, fighting the Germans in, in Africa, uh, fighting the Italians in Italy there and how we went about it and all this stuff that happened. And uh,

Speaker 2:          01:05:56       yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:05:57       And then they certainly don't talk about all we hear about the, the Russians is basically they just retreated and they drew them in and then when the winter came, they just mercilessly hacked them to death all the way back to fucking Berlin. That's all we hear. I didn't know that they were just, first of all, as they were retreating, they were blowing up their own bridges and dams and just,

Speaker 2:          01:06:20       yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:06:21       Scorched scorched earth thing that they did, literally destroyed their own fucking country. So there was nothing there for the Germans. It was fucking brilliant. And absolutely fucking ruthless. I would love, you know what, that's something I'm going to do on the rug. Thank you very much. What a wonderful suggestion. As I got to there. Do you know what's great about those? Both of those will make me more informed and hopefully a better person. Look at you guys paying it forward. Maybe I can give somebody some good advice there. Well, let me just continue here since incidentally I discovered your podcast because of him. He was a guest on the Joe Rogan experience and I started listening to Joe Rogan regularly, which led me to your glorious show. Oh, isn't that great? Yeah. Rogin has done a lot for me. He really has, when he hyped that, um, that Yoko Ono thing I did, that thing was like a year old and then he talked about it and then that was it.

Speaker 1:          01:07:13       There was like a zillion people, he's like the, he has like Oprah Winfrey level power, like were more than Oprah Winfrey said, hey man, I don't think you should be eating red meat anymore. And all of Texas declared war on her because she had that level of power. That's what Rogan is. It like the podcast world. If that fucking guy says, hey, check out this thing, all of a sudden like it gets a million hits. So, uh, I got to do something for him. What, what, what do you, what do you get? What'd you get for Joe Rogan? I should buy him a new pair of Mitts, you know, by him as his fucking vitamins for the week. Some sort of workout shit, not ana. He has all of that stuff. I got to go against the grain with Joe Rogan. What should I, you know, I'd buy him a nice son.

Speaker 1:          01:07:58       Had, you know, really thoughtful gift like Joe, I know you have everything that involves choking somebody out or ending their life if they fuck with you on any level. You know, Bob on a nice sun had, has anybody done anything to help keep the sun out of that wonderful man's eyes? I don't think they have. And I think he's comfortable enough with himself that he could accept the unbelievably awkward, intimate moment of me handing them that hat. You know what? Next time I do is fucking podcast. I'm bringing them a nice sun hat. You know, I don't know. He might have a convertible. Who knows? Is there such a thing as a sun hat? This is sun dress. Then I just invent a new fucking hat. There you go. People right there. Look at me creating a whole new business, creating jobs here at the Monday morning podcast.

Speaker 1:          01:08:52       Either way. Listen to the Joe Rogan experience and when you're done doing that, by the way, uh, me and Al Madrigal and some other, a wonderful people have started the all things comedy network. If you like this podcast, if you'd like to have a nice, incredible, wide variety of podcasts, listen to, I suggest that you go to the all things comedy podcast network and uh, have listened Harlan Williams, Tom Papa, a baron Vaughn. Tom Said Gara wow. With the fucking, uh, we got all kinds of people. Your mom's house podcast there where you'd think I would have them in front of me. Minivan men. There's all kinds of great one Harlan's highway. All right, here we go from a lady higher bill. Hi a kid, uh, lady listener here. I have two questions in one email. I hope that's alright with you will. Absolutely. I'm just like that a woman actually is listening to this podcast and wants to contribute.

Speaker 1:          01:09:48       I've been asking you guys borderline begging you, you know, to get out of the kitchen, figure out how a computer works and send me an email. But she just, you know, you're too busy making a sandwich for the man in your life, which is what you're supposed to do, you know. But you know, every once in a while, don't be afraid of the computer ladies. Um, all right, lady. Listen. Okay, the two questions, the first one is about marriage. I'm just wondering how do you feel about it? I'm only 18 and seeing what it is doing to my parents recently is making me not open to the idea in the future. Um, all right, well this is the thing, just because your parents don't seem to have a happy marriage, it doesn't mean that you can't. All right. I think, uh, if you go into to being married, married for the right reasons, and if you're, uh, you're mature enough, which I've never have been and I've been a fucking complete piece of shit with women and all that type of stuff and I've been an APP is your 20s are coming up.

Speaker 1:          01:10:54       Um, you know, as your 20s are coming up, you know, you're going to meet some people that you're going to look at and that you're going to feel like you have a heart attack and don't fucking walk away from the go up to that person. Just because your parents may be haven't found true love doesn't mean you can't. Eh, you know, you can find true love. And then if you work at it and you do the things you're supposed to do, what you'll learn naturally as you get older, you can have a great time. You know? Is there anything better than seeing like two old people sitting together and you can see they still have that connection and they got to, they literally enjoy life together. What I wish I knew when I was younger, how important that was. You know, I'm finally starting to see it through all of my fucking horrific mistakes that I've made in that category. But like a

Speaker 4:          01:11:44       mmm.

Speaker 1:          01:11:45       I think you should be open to it. You should be open to your 18 you should be open to things. I'm not saying drug use and being promiscuous and that type of thing. Smartsheet. I mean, uh, finding love. You should definitely be open to not happy, particularly your parents. And you're like, well, this just seems like a lot of work to just be miserable.

Speaker 4:          01:12:10       MMM.

Speaker 1:          01:12:12       That doesn't mean you have to be miserable. All right, there you go. So there's just, that's your first one. All right. My second question she says is about how and when one should introduce a significant other to parents.

Speaker 4:          01:12:24       MMM.

Speaker 1:          01:12:26       Just to give you more information. My boyfriend's 21 and in the last year of college we've been together for about a year and five months. All right. That's some scary math there depending on what state you're in. Uh, every time I am going to hang out with him or have a sleep over at his house, I've been making up an excuse. Like I'm going to a concert that ends really late going to stay with a friend. I can't seem to work up the nerve to tell either my mom or dad. I am more worried about my dad because he's a fucking big mouth. The whole family would know by the end of the night when he's drinking on weekends. He likes to bring up conversations just to work on people's nerves in the house. I don't want my boyfriend to be the topic in the House for my dad to get on my nerves with. So do I just go with the, if it ain't broke, don't fix it route and keep making shitty excuses until they either find out on their own or I move out of the house or do I just work up some balls here and tell them that I have a boyfriend? Well they're gonna find out eventually and when they find out you're not going to have control over the situation. So, um,

Speaker 4:          01:13:36       okay.

Speaker 1:          01:13:36       I kind of got lost there. We you, you make up excuses to your parents or to your boyfriend. Let me go back here. Micro. Second question is Alba.

Speaker 4:          01:13:46       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:13:47       How do I introduce my boyfriend and my parents? Okay. Every time I'm going to hang out with him with sleep over his house, I've been making up an excuse. Oh, okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Uh, this is what I would do. They are probably the more you say I'm going to another concert that's going to end like they're going to figure it out. How do you introduce

Speaker 1:          01:14:06       your parents? Uh, do your boyfriend. I would just, I would do this. I wouldn't say shit to your parents other than I have a boyfriend now and I want to introduce him to you guys and I would leave it at that because your parents are your parents and they're going to behave how they behave. And then what I would do is I would give a pregame speech to, uh, to your boyfriend and be like, look, I love my parents. They're a little bit nuts. And this is the thing too. You're probably going to overreact, you know, like the fear you have of what they're going to do is going to be so much bigger probably than what they're actually going to do. It's because they're your parents. You want their approval and you fucking hate them all at the same and it's going to be like just walking into a store like, hello sir, can I help you?

Speaker 1:          01:14:57       Yes. I like that shirt. There you go. That'll be nine 95. Thank you. Goodbye. It's going to be at that level a little bit more. Um, it's just going to be nice. They just going to be exchanging niceties. Okay. That's what I'm predicting is going to happen. And then what's going to happen is when he, when your boyfriend leaves, he's going to tell you how nice your parents are because why wouldn't you? And then that's probably going to know you want some level cause you're gonna be like, no, they're fucking assholes. You haven't had to live with them. So don't do that to him either. Um, I would take control of the situation and just introduce him.

Speaker 4:          01:15:31       MMM.

Speaker 1:          01:15:33       And if they ask how long you've been seeing him, you know, when you first say, I want you to introduce, I want it to introduce my boyfriend to you. And if they asked how long you've been seeing him, I don't know your dad's drinks. And he says, Shit, you might want to lie about that. I Dunno, I'll fuck him if he does. Don't lie to them. Say about a year and five months. And if they say, well why have you brought him around? Just be like, well dad, cause you have a tendency to get drunk and talk about everybody's business in a row is really, uh, made me nervous. That's why I didn't, you can't fuck with the truth.

Speaker 4:          01:16:06       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:16:06       What's he going to say to that? I don't get drunk and say all that type of shit. I guess he could be in denial.

Speaker 1:          01:16:15       I don't know. At some point, you know what you have to do. You got to like you, you got to man up or woman up and you just have to live your fucking life and you just have to understand that yeah, your parents are your parents to fucking awesome, but they're just people and you just really have to, uh, in a, in a healthy weight, not give a fuck what they think anymore in a healthy way. Okay. I don't mean like, like I said, go out and start doing drugs and being a fucking idiot. You should always care about not bringing shame to your family name, but like as far as that other stuff, like I wanted you to be a doctor, but you're going to fucking, I dunno. Open your own bakery. The, I'm so disappointed. Well, be disappointed. Okay. Cause I don't want to fucking sit there vacuum and out somebody's ass or looking at somebody's toes or working on a brain.
