Talking to you from the road. Don't you know, I'm sorry. I'm in the middle of nowhere, man. I'm in fucking Chattanooga, Tennessee and I haven't seen shit. I haven't seen shit here yet. I ain't seen shit air yet. Um, I'm in the middle of the southern tour here. Uh, traveling on the bus, fueling up next to truckers. It's a whole other world, man. Whole other worlds, those truck drivers, you know, but you know what? I only saw one real fat one or sell one fatty, you know, one big guy was just like, dude, you need to, you need to start jogging some laps around your truck, man, that's gotta be the hardest fucking job to stay in shape. Holy Shit.

Speaker 2:          00:00:53       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:00:54       So one guy has fucking sitting there. He's got a dog in there, you know, how the fuck do you make any time when you've got a dog? I mean, do you get to fucking pull over every couple hours, right? I guess you got to get gas anyways. I think they had to take a shit.

Speaker 3:          00:01:07       You know,

Speaker 1:          00:01:11       it's like you just fucking pull it over. It's a goddamn 18 wheeler oh 18. Um, anyways, this is the Monday morning podcast. This is going to be a fucked up one cause I'm an a silly ass mood and I have no idea what's going on in the world right now. I know that there was some refugees that floated over on some little boat, not a little boat lake, 700 people. Uh, God, I fucking hate those stories. They always skip the part to where they go. There's some bodies being seen. They didn't never talk about all that. Quint from Jaws Shit, the amount that we're treading water and got eaten by sharks. Dude, you know bad. A country has to be for you to fucking

Speaker 2:          00:01:49       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:01:49       Take your chances doing that. This or you wouldn't get me up front of fucking lake. I, I don't, I do not fuck with I go into poles. I will in a pool all goddamn day. Fuck that. I wouldn't go on a pond.

Speaker 3:          00:02:08       Fuck that.

Speaker 1:          00:02:10       Goddamn people trying to cross the Mediterranean Sea. I don't even know where they were coming from. Jesus Christ. Now, how do you it as a dictator, dead point d d how do you not know at that point? Like, Hey, maybe I, uh, maybe I should ease up a little bit on the people here. They're fucking, they're trying to cross the Mediterranean on a Goddamn Hooptie

Speaker 1:          00:02:35       will fucking boogie boards and shit. At that point, you got to know, you know, it even if you didn't give a shit about them, you'd have to be thinking like, um, I think there's going to be an attempt made on my life pretty soon. You know, considering 700 people just died. You figured they got to have a bunch of people that loved him, right? It's eight, three people loved all those people. There's 2100 people that want to fucking kill me extra today as a dictator. Um, you know, probably help affect, she looked to see which one it was the only dictator I knew when that got beaten to death by shit from auto zone. Remember that Guy Kadafi he got beaten to death with like fucking car batteries and antennas walking around with half his fucking uniform on and I was a travesty, you know what I mean?

Speaker 1:          00:03:22       That was like worse than seeing Emmitt Smith playing for the Arizona cardinals and all that. You know, like when you just see like a me versus you talk about that. Patrick knew Patrick Ewing when he played for like Orlando. Just seeing him in that uniform, seeing Kadafi walking around with half his boy scout uniform on begging for his life. Like I was a fan. But you know, it's like, Gee, you got an, you know, you gotta know when to get out of show business and that, that includes being a dictator. You gotta know, you gotta be able to feel it. You gotta be sitting there going, all right, people are leaving this country w and shit boats just to get away from me. How much longer are they going to put up? Put up with me? How, how much longer can I, can I keep the facade going that I can beat everybody's ass one on one here in this country?

Speaker 1:          00:04:11       You know what I mean? I Dunno man. Hang on a sec. Let me find it. Can we at least have the decency for the victims to know where that went, where it went? You know, that's terrible. That's terrible that that happened to them. But I gotta tell you it's good for the baby seals. You know what I mean? Cause that's 700 less people eating fish now and they actually fed fish. What they did was tremendous. You know, if you guys seen that story, it's like there's like baby seals washing up on the ocean. I'm going on the ocean washing up on the beach just cause they're starving to death because the oceans are so fished out. This is probably a bad thing to bring up. You know, when he's sitting there reading this thing, alright, London rescue grabbed scrambled. Why? I want this stock fucking thing. Let me select it. There we go. All right, where did this happen? It's being reported from London Mediterranean, uh, crossing Europe to Europe from Africa. Okay. All right.

Speaker 2:          00:05:05       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:05:05       More than 17 vessels. We're searching for the survivors. Uh, my God, 70 miles off the coast of Libya now, Olivia, and as in that where Kadafi used to fucking cut all his hits and he used to record out there.

Speaker 2:          00:05:20       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:05:21       All the, you know, the fucking teen idols sensation out there. I gotta look this up here. Libya. Libby, a dictator. D a Tor dictator. Who Do you got? Who Do you got on more? Sadat. Momar. Kadafi.

Speaker 2:          00:05:39       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:05:40       And I fucked. Do you take shit from a guy named Momar? You have to do it. Moma. I said no, fuck him. He never looked like he was a bad ass daddy. He just always looked like a, he just thought that was just bad casting. I'm going to go dominant. Votech guy. Worst like most unintimidating like fucking dictator ever. He just look at his face. I don't know what he looks. He just looks like a, you know, he looked like to me was a, what's his face? Oh Christ. What's his name? Bobby. Uh, AH, fuck. I'm the worst. I got to get off the road. The fuck is his name.

Speaker 1:          00:06:20       Oh Jesus. It's the perfect fucking analogy too. It's going to tour it. I'll remember it. I'll remember it by the end of this. Um, anyways, I'm just saying the guy's face. He looks, you know what it is. He looks like this guy that I know that I can't remember his fucking name. This is going off the rails over here. Um, all right. Anyway, so we're on the, we're on the southern tour here. We did a, we did Savannah the first night and uh, just a great crowd, beautiful city and um, you know the usual shit. We go up, me and me in a fucking lie ahead. We flew out on the 17th, because we're coming from the west coast and we show up. You know, we don't have a Wii. We don't have a vehicle with staying out by the airport. So we're nowhere near downtown Savannah.

Speaker 1:          00:07:05       I didn't see anything in Savannah. I didn't see old town. I didn't see shit. I always wanted to go there. I never even got to it cause we was staying way out by the airport and the bus hadn't shown up yet. Right. So we say to the lady downstairs, right? First of all, they fucking check and she takes my driver's license. And as always, just starts typing shit in. I go, what are you doing? She goes, I'm typing in your home address. And it's just like, for what? Well, just in case you leave something, while if I leave something of value, I'll call you guys. I'll notice. And then I'll call you guys. And then you guys, of course, we'll say you couldn't find it because it was of a v. It was a value. The housekeeper that you're not paying shit is going to keep it.

Speaker 1:          00:07:44       There's no reason for you to fucking take my home address. You just going to sell it to somebody else to make a little bit of money. So today I went to go check in the hotel and she takes my fucking driver's license. She goes, type in. I said, what are you doing? She goes, I'm typing in your home address. And I go, uh, I don't want you to do to do that. She goes, you don't want me to do that? I said, yes, I don't want you to do that. She goes, okay, how about just a zip code? And I said No. And she said, okay. So that's what I learned today. It's fucking optional. Fucking assholes. This fucking take your Id. Just telling these people to just start fucking typing your God damn address in there. What the fuck he get doing? Renting a room. Here's my credit card. Here's my id saying that's my credit card now fuck off and give me a room. You got to know where I lived. Huh? You fucking Weirdos telling you people don't do that. Don't do that. Cause they uploaded onto their shit and then, and then it's just, it's just out there. And next thing you know, I don't know what if you're lucky, you just getting spammed by a red roof inn getting shit sent to you directly.

Speaker 1:          00:08:59       You're really unlucky. I don't know what happens. Some of these fucking steal your identity. Somebody shows up at your fucking, I mean, either way it's rude and it's completely fucking unnecessary and a, and I'll tell you right now, I'll tell you right now, this, this, this freckled face cunt is a, is against it. 100%. 100%. Um, so anyways, so we say to the lady downstairs at the, uh, at the hotel where like, so, uh, you know, we walk in, right? I see la had, had sees me, we obviously know we're going to start drinking immediately. And I ask, you know, we walk in his hotel bar still open. She's like, no, now it isn't a jazz closed. I'm sorry. You want me to go make you some? You're down south. We're really polite. And I was like, no, that's all right. You don't have to make it some is there a bar nearby? And she goes, yeah, there's one on her and her hair straight. And I'm like, all right, can you walk there from there? She's a, Oh no, Nah, y'all, y'all. Y'All can't walk here from, Hey, you can't walk or it's too far again, why you all get attacked by a wild cat or something? And I was just like, all right, well let me look this fucking thing up. And I looked it up. It was like, it was like a fucking barely a mile away.

Speaker 1:          00:10:14       Yeah. It's like, what do you eat? Meat, you can fucking walk. So we fucking walk over there. We literally walk half the half a mile of the walk was getting out of the Goddamn fucking hotel area and then we just took down the streets. We see lights, we see civilization. Ah, you can't walk down. I mean you could do it, but I mean, I don't know what, what happened to you? So we go all the way down. She didn't even talk like that. I just like the southern accent and fucking annoying people from where I'm touring. So we fucking head all the way down there. We ended up walking to this bar. Is this a little band in there? Guy On guitar and a guy playing drums that both killing it, singing all this shit from the 90s. Fucking tremendous. We'll fucking drinking right now. You get shocked was they'd go given the shots at Jamison and glasses that they had just taken out of the dishwasher.

Speaker 1:          00:11:08       So the glass was off. Those was between warm and kind of hot was gross. It was making me sick to my stomach, but I can't drink. Um, and I don't know what happened. We just sat there laughing our asses off. We were watching some sort of, some, some game. I don't even know what the fuck we were watching. And next thing you know, I really, I looked up and we were the only two people left in the place and we were too drunk to fucking walk back. We didn't want to. So, uh, this, the dude at the bar, this gay dude who was wearing a kilt for whatever fucking reason, I think, cause it was an Irish bar, he gave us a ride home.

Speaker 1:          00:11:48       So that's how it started. It was a great guy. He came walking over and he just took off fucking beers, put them in paper cups and he does let us drink it. That last little mile on the way home. And then I walked in to the hotel and I said to the lady, you know, hey it, can you still order room service? Is there any way we can order some servers up to the room, some, some service room service stuff. He's like, ah Nah, Nah, I can't just clouds clouds. I'm salary. I'll you want me mama go hostile and go kill a fathom. Fari I'll cook it out. I'll brand it how deep frack manky some dumplings. And we like, Nah, Nah, that's cool. That's cool. And I went over and I bought a bag of fucking potato chips and went upstairs and laid in bed drunk in, ate a bag of chips and fell asleep.

Speaker 1:          00:12:32       That's how the tour started. Remember I told you guys I was going to try to not put on any weight. That's how it started. That's what set the fucking tone right. Then the next day the Goddam bus pulls up, right? The bus pulls up and we see that thing and it's just, I don't know. We've been actually been doing pretty good though as far as, um, you know, I went out and I got a, I got some cereal, I've got corn checks, right? I get some bananas. So that's my breakfast. And then I got some Turkey, did all of this in Walmart. So God knows what level of quality this shit actually is. Oh my God, dude, you go into a Walmart. Holy Shit. You cannot believe the loss of hope and those fucking people's eyes. This fucking lady, this fucking lady, when I went up to the Deli, I mean, I was just like, hey, how you doing?

Speaker 1:          00:13:22       I'm fucking turning on the charm. I have what's going on? How I, and she just fucking looking at me. She's like, what do you want? Just like, uh, can I get a, uh, pounded that smoked Turkey police? She's Zadie. It as like a, you know, didn't come in. You real hi. Hey, how you doing? And some of you just fucking hits you with your attitude and you immediately got to adjust all the way down to them. You know, it's like the way I lost out on the negotiations last week on the rug, you know? And um, so I go from, hey, how's it going? [inaudible] uh, yeah, we'll have some, uh, helps them Turkey. She's like that it, that it, that's what she said that it, and I was like, uh,

Speaker 4:          00:14:03       yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:14:03       I can't get like, you know, 15 slices of cheese,

Speaker 1:          00:14:07       you know, white Cheddar, white American. Whenever he got, she's like, Yep, she fucking goes over and just cuts it up. And like, I can't even tell you the way she like handed it to me. Well, just sort of looking off into the distance down the isles, you know, and uh, it was just, you know, so now, you know, I'm shaking it off, right. I'm getting some fucking condiments for the sandwiches, pickles that got my mustard and I get it. I get down to the booze, I realized I don't have any hard stuff. So I throw in a six, a fucking blue moon, whatever. That's the best they got here and this fucking assholes have the nerve on a Sunday to not let me buy a six pack of beer. The lady took it away from me. I had it on a little conveyor belt and she's fucking, you know, boop boop corn checks boob, right? Half Gallon of 2% milk. Everything's going fine and then she goes, she goes, I can't let you have this and took it away from me and set it on the other side of the register. Like I was going to lunge after it or something. I can't let you have this. It's before 1230 on a Sunday and I was just, I a second. We fucking adults here. You already, I'll do

Speaker 1:          00:15:23       the way they fucking treat their employees there. How bad, how poorly Walmart treats their fucking employees. They're going to have the nerve to not let people drink before noon. They should be letting those people drink on the job. I was fucking miserable. They treat those damn people. How do I know they treat them miserably? I don't know. I just heard they have, they won't give me my beer. So now I'm trashing up. That's what I'm doing. I'll tell you, they got some fucking clothes in there though. They got some decent clothes. You know, if you just adjust your ego down a little bit, they got some decent clothes and Walmart, like you could make it work. You don't feel it gives you, maybe if he just fucking spend a little more money on your pants, then I know. You know what? You got it. This is what you gotta do.

Speaker 1:          00:16:08       If you're going to fucking go cheap on something, you can't do anything near eye level. You can't, you can't get away with a cheap shirt. You know what I mean? You just got to buy in real nice shirt. Then the rest of it can look like shit, but you have to be charismatic to keep people looking you in the eye because the second you start losing their intention, you're their attention, you know? And they started looking down at the guy like guy, Guy, what am I looking at this motherfuck why am I talking to him? Right. They're going to see your shoes and it's going to be over. I think it'd be like this motherfucker shops at Walmart. He goes down to Wally world. Shit, we all do. We all go down there to buy fucking an eight pound box of fucking weedies. We all do that shit. But this guy actually goes down there and buy the shirts and I know what you're saying right now bill, why are you making fun of people who can't afford to shop any place else other than Walmart? And there's a simple answer to that. They're not in the room with me right now. Okay. They can't do me any harm and I am unbelievably tough on my podcast. A fucking trash. Anybody. Um,

Speaker 2:          00:17:12       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:17:13       My dream is, is that people who wear Walmart clothes climb over the walls of gated community someday and they just start murdering bankers and heads of corporations. Okay. And then in the fight everybody dies. So then you weed out your mouth breathing racist. Okay. And their spawn. And then you get rid of the guys up top and then once you got in the middle is a bunch of regular fucking people don't want to get fucked with. They're willing to get up, go down the street, you know, sell some apples, come home. Right. That's what I do in my dream world. I have no idea what I'm talking about. How much bullshit that I just throw it. Yes, that was good. 18 minutes of your life, you're never getting that back. How do you feel you're getting through the traffic? When he listening to this? I'm open.

Speaker 1:          00:18:01       I'm open. The volumes fine. And in the last couple of weeks, every once in a while the volume gets bad. It sounds fine to me. Did I just spell Libya? L Y. Bia? I think I did lie BF. Who's that guy from Labia? I don't know who he is. He ain't from here. Oddly. We should mom. But you're in a fair on, on my own. Battle Nail, nail nail. Um, all right. Let's get this a little bit of advertising for this week. Oh, by the way, I got to talk to you guys about Blake Griffin. I like Blake Griffin. I enjoy watching the guy play basketball, but it is impossible for me to do that when I'm sitting next to fucking Paul Versey or Jason Law had they fucking trashed thing. No matter what the guy does it matter what he does. He fucking dunks on somebody. Yeah, the guy got there late. That was more the past.

Speaker 1:          00:18:45       I did it on some second string guy. Chris Paul does something. They're fucking jerking off. I'm not saying Blake Griffin's as good as is Chris Paul, but I mean, you know the man is wildly entertaining. He is electrifying. He fucking has dunked on everybody in the Goddamn League. Get off his back. They're acting like he's Joe Barry Carroll out there like they wasted a bunch of fucking money. That guy, he, he's helping to put the clippers on the map. You could fucking walk up to a clippers game before that guy came out. He didn't give a shit about that. Dairy is miles guy doing the fucking antenna thing. That's the closest they ever came to. Anybody given a fuck about them. Right. Billy Crystal deserves a god Damn Sports Medal of honor for the amount of games that he has sat through. That guy said, fuck the Lakers and everybody else who goes down.

Speaker 1:          00:19:37       I'm going with the clippers guys go and he's contrary. You know, by the way, did I mention, I did you guys, we have you guys been watching the comedian jet fucking great show and the pilot episode, that pilot episode where they're trying to get that show off the ground the way they did that. That's pretty much almost exactly just the, the, the conversations putting two guys together that don't want to be together, but they were, they were, their careers are at, they kind of have to be a half baked fucking concept of bad fucking meeting. You talking to your manager, you need guts saying don't do it. You end up fucking doing it. I mean, the way they executed that in the pilot was just, it was off the charts tenant 10 out of 10, as far as old freckles is concerned. But anyways, Billy crystal has been going to these clippers games.

Speaker 1:          00:20:24       I remember I went, I went to a, um, a clippers games that they have the old La sports arena. He was there, the black dude from a different world. Remember the guy who wore the glasses probably had some weird name for his character that fucking killed his career, like cockroach. You know, anytime you get one of those names, you're fucking done, right Dougie. Not Dougie. He actually got out of it. Jesus Christ. How the fuck do you pull out of the mud Dougie? Um, Urkel you fucked cockroach. You fucked. It's another one. Screech. Get done. If anybody is getting into the act of game, I will tell you this right now. If you fucking do, turn it down. If your character just has a nickname, you're fucked. You fucked. Unless you have the, the, the talent to start writing your own shit and producing your own shit.

Speaker 1:          00:21:21       Then you can get out of it. You can get out of it, but your whole fucking life you'd done right. My out of my mind. Oh, go fuck yourself. I don't know. I don't know what I'm saying here. Anyways, so anyways, so I go to the La sports arena and it was Allen Iverson's rookie year and I went down there, um, to watch a game and biggie smalls was in the crowd and that was the trip within like five days. He was dead on that trip and I fucking walked right by him and he sorta had like these security guys around, but he's just sort of standing there hanging out. And I remember that thinking like, wow, I guess that whole East Coast West thing is a west coast thing is over. But anyways, Billy crystal was there, um, the fuck am I talking about? I don't get it back.

Speaker 1:          00:22:03       So last night we were at the bar and I'm sitting there trying to enjoy the game and we got into this fucking, we got to like three of the loudest sports arguments. I just remember seeing the bartenders and Knoxville just sitting there laughing at us is we're screaming at each other about shit that they didn't even care about. I remember one point, this guy came up, he had a red sox shirt on. And first he just goes, he goes, how you'll red sox fan down here? And the guy goes, I'm from Boston. And then, you know, fuck the Yankees. And then they get in this big fight and then in the end versus going, you know, what the fuck you guys yelling at me for? It's like, firstly, you started with the guy. And he goes, no, I didn't. He walked up to me and said, hey, fuck the Yankees.

Speaker 1:          00:22:40       It's like, Paul, you're not wearing anything that says Yankees on it. You started with Tim, this guy's wearing a red sox. Teesha and he'd gone, I did. You know that level drunk you are where you just fucking, you ignore everything, all types of logic. Um, so all I'm trying to do is enjoy it. And the, the fucking assholes, they won't get off Blake Griffin's back when we met him, I had, in my mind, they're going, ah, we're not saying, we're not saying he's not a perennial all star. We're not saying that you know, he, he's not a, he's not a good player. We're just saying that he should be doing more. It's like, I don't know. What you just listed was pretty fucking impressive, wasn't it? I don't know. Fucking know. All right, let's, let's, let's do a little bit of a, still a little bit of advertising media.

Speaker 1:          00:29:25       Run for your law. Anyways, let's get back to the shit. I'll tell you this right now, man and I, one of the most depressing places I've ever been to is the u s airway terminal connecting out of Charlotte, North Carolina. I was taking the red eye in. Oh my God. The fucking humanity that I saw. Oh my God. People just sitting there, you know, guy comes in with the, I'd been smoking fucking cigarettes my whole life. You know what? The tubes up his nose carrying an oxygen tank. Somebody else sitting there, you know, with a plate of Nachos,

Speaker 1:          00:30:03       right? And right now, lap, beautiful girl just sitting there killing herself, just eaten poison. Everybody just poisoning themselves. It was like a fight. There was like this, like this mass suicide that was going on as I sat there and the term or not, nobody making a fucking quality choice. Everybody just choosing misery in the future. I don't even get me started with the fucking shoes. I was really as, I was like going, wow man, this is this, this is flying to Savannah. Then I realized like, Nah, you know, some of them are going to other places. It was really depressing, you know, that's how that days, you know, it was coming to a close, but then you know the wonders of the road. Next thing you know, I walk to a bar and I'm with Jay and I'm getting a ride home from a gay guy in a kilt. I mean, you know, you always hold out hope that it's going to turn around

Speaker 1:          00:30:58       if he's listening, thank you for the ride and thank you for putting the beer in the fucking paper cups. It was, it was tremendous. What a night, right? Oh, so we ended up going, we ended up going out to this speakeasy. Right. You know, which is, you know, it's just a fame thing right now. The key, we met these two fucking women. They work for like the uh, Savannah PD or whatever. So now we'll get you in, right? So we all fucking head over there and was sitting in this bar then making some good drinks and everything. And I wish I had these two ladies on the podcast because I was just grilling them. I was like, what is, what is the fucking weirdest? I go, don't tell me any of the sad ones when people are calling the cops. Give me the weird ones. The weirdest one. This one woman told me it was, somebody said that their neighbor was jerking off and they could smell the semen. And she goes, Oh, you know, okay, so what do you mean? Like is he standing in the window? Can you see him? She goes, no, I can't see them, but I can smell it. I can smell it through the walls.

Speaker 1:          00:32:06       They had to send somebody over there. So when he goes, all right, you could smell it. I got to tell you, ma'am, I don't want to start an argument here, but I cannot smell any ges. You know, I think you have a wonderful home here and uh, maybe you ought to get some medication. Um, but anyways, uh, so thank you to everybody who came out to Savannah, by the way. And everybody who came out to Knoxville, the fucking theater I played in Knoxville, I think rightly said, Ralphie may did a special there and I can see why it's one of most beautiful theaters I've ever been to. It was, um, the Tennessee theater built in 1927 or 28. You know, just this unbelievably gorgeous place where you used to go down to watch movies. You know, I swear to God, if I could be alive back in the day, like I think I would go back to when they first built a lot of these theaters that I played in just to watch movies.

Speaker 1:          00:33:00       No one, everybody gets dressed up and it's like a real big fucking deal. And they had this giant Wurlitzer organ and I forgot to look for the thing and find out where it was. They got it refurbished, send it out to some maniac in Reno that redid the whole God damn thing. He's like a, he's like the guy, I guess if you're going to have you fucking giant Wurlitzer organ redone. And um, the crowd was, uh, was phenomenal. You know, it was hilarious was we were fucking, uh, on the way. Their law had such a big basketball fan. He wanted to fuck and he wanted to do, he wanted to go see like the Tennessee volunteers trophy case. See Pat Summit, you know, trophies like women's basketball. That's like how psycho into fucking basketball he is. And uh, he ended up, he ended up doing this pat summit joke on the bus that had us die and laughing but like verse, he goes, Dude, you got to do that on stage.

Speaker 1:          00:34:02       And I said, Jay, don't do that on stage. Don't do that on stage. This is like their fucking, this is like their female Jesus, you don't do that. Don't do it. Dementia joke on there. And then what's his verse? He goes, he should do it. So I said, all right, do it tonight. Okay. And I go in, if it fucking bombs, all you got to do to save it is just, it was basically a, you know, she's got dementia. It's like, well, if you saw that much women's basketball over the years, you know, you'd want to forget about it to write a silly joke as silly joke. But if you say it in Knoxville, it's going to be a problem. Or if there's some current who blogs, they'll, they'll fucking flip out about it. And the, where my grandfather has dementia and you made me sad Monday morning podcast tee shirt, right?

Speaker 1:          00:34:45       And then, then all of a sudden there'll be a controversy, right? Fucking baby seals starving to death, washing up on the fucking sand. They're going to fucking give a shit about a joke. Somebody told Knoxville. So anyways, so he was supposed to go out, he was supposed to go out there and just do the fucking joke. And if it bombed, I go. Just say, Hey, I gotta be honest with you. You know, for, as he said, don't do it. But first he said, do it. Bert said, don't do it. I learned something here next time, listen to the headline or something cute like that. So he guts to go doing it and he does that shit first. Go on. I don't know, I'd said this joke on the bus and that are now, I don't know if I should say. And the crowds, like God said, like he totally got him into it and it bugged me because then it ended up working and then he said verse, he's right.

Speaker 1:          00:35:32       It's like now you, well, once you did the fucking UNICEF speech before the joke, you know, you almost questioning that goddamn comedy manhood about whether they're going to laugh about it or not. But uh, anyways, I'm just breaking that balls. Where, when a good time out here. So, hey, Chattanooga people, if you listen to this today, let us know what there is to do out here. I never been here. This is fucking cool. This tour, because I've only ever been in Nashville. And, um, we actually drove up from Savannah on the bus and it was so beautiful. One point going through some of these, um, national parks. I was actually sitting up front for like John Madden on my way to green bay for a game or something. I was sitting up there absolutely eastern Tennessee, south east of Knoxville, fucking God's country. I'm telling you, Tony, if you can just deal with them, fucking hillbillies out there and you know, every once in a while somebody is going to, they are going to be coming for you. You know, I don't know what goes on out there. Um, I could never get me to live out there. She's a city girl. You know what I mean? The way I get nervous on a subway, she gets nervous when she sees the woods. So, uh, you know the deal, you know who's going to make her more miserable? She's gonna make me more miserable. She went, so we stay in the fucking city, stay in a city, in a state where we are going to be out of water in a year.

Speaker 1:          00:36:53       How funny is it that I just put it in an immaculate bathroom at my house, spent all my fucking money on it. Didn't spare any expense we'll put was already probably not going to make my money back because they're just going to look at it as square footage anyways. And I added no square footage to my fucking house.

Speaker 3:          00:37:14       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:37:16       But at least I had this great fucking shower, you know? And now we're going to be out of water. And once again, nobody seems to be a alarmed by it. Nobody seems to be talking about it. Like what? What exactly is going on? You know, population seals washing up fucking running out of water. Everybody just stay in the course. I think that's the game plan. I think that is the game plan. You just fucking act like everything is fine. And then one day you just take that asteroid to the face and it's over. Maybe that's the way to do it. I'm starting to give into it, you know, fuck it. You know, y'all, I can't do anything about it, but fuck. He call you don't go home. Do you go kill yourself? Pick, put it on a spit. You won't dig a hole. We don't cook a picked day.

Speaker 1:          00:38:09       I want to go to a fucking pig pickin down here. Oh, by the way, uh, when we go to New Orleans, a, the Pelicans are playing, the fucking warriors come out and play. I think we're going to try and go to the game. We've got a day off down there. How fucking cool is that? Um, but anyways, I absolutely love Knoxville man. Um, and I have to get back there again. The crowd was awesome. I have got to get back there for a game. Um, and I was asking him what game to go to and everybody was go, you know, go to the Tennessee, Georgia game. Uh, they play Oklahoma next year. That'll be a good game. And then this fucking old time I came up to me and he's like, game you want to go to is the Alabama game. And I was just like, right there.

Speaker 1:          00:38:50       All right, that's the game we're going to go to. Why wouldn't I go to it? That might be my goal. I'm going to go to what every sec team when they play Alabama and root against Alabama because it's just, it's just so much fun to root against those fucking guys and screamed. The dream ends tonight. You know why bill, why do you give a shit about it? I really don't. I just like being a cunt. I'm telling you guys, I'm going to retire and I'm going to buy a house in Alabama. That's my game plan. That is my exit strategy. You know, God willing, we still have water. When I retire, somehow in La and my house is actually worth something and it hasn't turned to dust, I am then going to go out. I'm going to buy me a spread. Maybe eastern Tennessee,

Speaker 1:          00:39:33       you know, it'd be far enough inland that those fucking hurricanes will slow down. You know, maybe every once in a while there's a micro burst and the trees lay down. But I'm inside. I'm a nice brick house. Brick House. All right, let's get to some of the questions here. Uh, um, for this week. Oh, by the way, um, for the, for the Thursday, Thursday afternoon, Monday morning podcast. Just before Friday. Um, if you would like, do you know stuff that you want me to talk about? Articles for me to read, videos, questions, any of that shit. You do it through Twitter and have the Hashtag t a m m p tango Alpha Mike, Mike, Papa. Sorry. Anyways, I'm just Hashtag or is that, and I'll fucking scroll through at two seconds before he start and you'll get to listen to me read out loud. All right. Factory made diamonds. Okay, bill, this is a followup from Thursday clip where you answered a question about real diamonds versus fake ones and whether or not women should be cool with the factory made ones. Uh, please ask listeners to go back and check it out if they haven't already. All right, we'll go back and listen to that. I guess it was last week. I don't even remember talking about this shit. Uh, a a big Billy dildo. I was listening to your clip.

Speaker 3:          00:40:50       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:40:52       You replayed on the just checking it. Oh, well from last week. Oh, that's why, because it was what? It was a throwback clip from last Thursday's. Just checking in on your Thursday afternoon, just before Friday, Monday morning podcast. Um, he said, I know what this magical stone is.

Speaker 3:          00:41:09       Okay,

Speaker 1:          00:41:10       all right. I'll tell you the name, but you can choose to skip over it if you want. If you don't want the secret to get out, it's called a, I can't even say it. Moist Sinai.

Speaker 1:          00:41:22       M. O. I. S. S. A. N. I. T. E. It's not actually an exact diamond replica, but it looks identical to everyone that isn't trained to know difference. The good news is that your secret amongst amongst dudes can be safe. The only way to tell the difference is if you take it to a jeweler to figure it out. If it's a dude, they're not going to fucking rat you out. If it's a check, well then you've got a wildcard aren't your hands, but there's nothing you can do at that point. I just know I'll do metal work in jewelry stores are also cons because they're going to want, because they're going to be like, oh yeah, he bought you a fake one. And because they know that the woman's going to go home and fucking loser shit and the guy is going to come back with his tail between his legs bringing the God damn bag of cash to buy a real one.

Speaker 1:          00:42:08       Um, I'm going say, okay, so I can't, I can't even pronounce it moist, Moist Sinai. Um, he wrote it all basically in lowercase letters, so I don't know where to accent that word. It's m o, I s s a N. I t. E for guys who need to buy their woman in an engagement ring. But you don't want to blow a bunch of money on diamonds, just get them one of this and they'll never know. That's actually a great thing too, to see if he got a gold digging whore. She actually goes down and checks it out, like immediately to see what it's worth. Sexy. You already fucking leaving me. What are you doing here? Right. Um, all right. He said, I just bought one for my girl last week. Actually I looked up the exact diamond equivalent and it was between 6,500 to seven grand just for the diamond.

Speaker 1:          00:42:53       I paid 750 bucks. The best news is that my girl is totally on board with this idea and her idea was to pocket the extra to go on a bad ass honeymoon. Yeah, absolutely. And then if somebody fucking goes, you know, gimme a fucking diamond ring or your life, you just give it to me, go Christ, that's fucking brilliant. Uh, you know what? You should have counterfeit cash in your wallet to just walk around everything fake. I love this. By the way, you know, made up that thing about spending three months salary on a ring. The fucking diamond companies, of course they did. They had a whole marketing campaign around it, so they're really fucking you over on, on top of the fact that they have a fucking monopoly so they can charge whatever the fuck they want for real diamonds. It's a total sham.

Speaker 1:          00:43:43       Anyways, just wanted to spread the word and let other dudes know that there is an alternative that makes both the girl and your bank account happy. Go Fuck Yourself. You know what, the more I hear about all of this stuff, best thing ever, it's gotta be real estate. You know what I mean? You can walk up to it, you can touch it, you can live in it. Obviously if you've got a building on it that's just gotta be the way to go. You know, fucking stock market. I have shares in this. Oh yeah, where are they? You got them in your pocket. You know, I am a firm believer of um, investing shit that you could just end shit that you could walk up and touch. But now with the diamonds, I dunno, that's the whole diamond gain. Now, if you, if you buy into the diamond game now, you have to that the, the people at the top, the evil doers actually, uh, keep that monopoly.

Speaker 1:          00:44:37       Cause if they don't and you get free enterprise going on there, then then what do you have if you get like sprint starts digging for diamonds, right? Nokia and all these other cons. And then what happens? You've got to, you got to shit storm on your hands. I swear to God people, I'm going to buy an apartment building. I'm going to become a slum Lord. That's what I'm doing. I'm going to buy apartment buildings, fixed them up, read them out to people, and then I'm going to slowly back out of this business. I want to retire the way Sinatra did the first time. That's my goal. I don't know if I'll be able to do it, but I would love the way he did it. He's singing this song and he just goes, excuse me while I disappear, was the final loan line of the science of Jesus Christ the final line of the song, the final long and assign the final line of the song.

Speaker 1:          00:45:26       There we go. And um, it's for that pet. So joke, look at me. I'm already losing my mind here. Um, and he just stepped out of the spotlight dis that if he, if he fucking left that way. Come on man, that's even better than if Jordan left after he hit that shot against Utah. I know I've already talked about this, but I am obsessed with how to get out of his business now as I've hit the middle part of my career, I feel 23 years ago, I was 23 at 20 almost 24 23 years from now, I'm going to be 70 just like that. Boom. Fucking over. What am I going to be doing? Huh? 70 years old, you read the religion at that point they put you out to pasture in fucking Vegas or you're on cruise ships, but either way, either way, they're like, let's do you just stay right here, their grandpa and we'll bring the people to you. Fuck that.

Speaker 4:          00:46:21       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:46:22       Fucked up. I'm going to buy a bunch. I'm going to become a slum Lord.

Speaker 1:          00:46:28       I'm going to buy a bunch of fucking apartment buildings in the middle of nowhere and I'm going to buy a white on white suit, put on some weight, and just look like boss Hog, right? A redheaded fucking boss Hog and I'm going to walk around a white hat, you know, and a big cigar that I never liked. That's what I'm going to do. There's actually some people that you know who ended up great fucking retirement out of this business. The smothers brothers and what they told me you were at the Orleans casino, both of those guys, they started their own a winery and a, they have their own vineyard and all that type of stuff, and they got that thing going up where it was making enough money to, you know what's so cool about them? When they retired, they didn't even tell people they were retiring. They just did their last show and they just left

Speaker 1:          00:47:18       total fucking class act, no begging, no hat and the hand, they'll fucking cry and no being broke. They had their money. They had a good fucking time. They were done with. They left and now they're sitting on a fucking vineyard. Jesus Christ. You fucking tell somebody, let me ask you this. What's your guys game plant? If you weigh, what's your fantasy? My fantasy is that I somehow fucking, I dunno, have enough money in real estate rental properties or something. I don't know. I'm just spit balling here, right? That you're actually making as much in rent as you were doing your job. So then you can quit your job and just seamlessly walk over to that. You can just be like, yeah, I'm not working anymore. You know, you got all your building's paid for. You got all your things rented. Everybody's cool. I know this isn't going to happen. This is a fantasy. And then the check just comes in, right? You fucking, you go live the middle of fucking nowhere where it's cheap as hell. No property tax, no nothing. Get a giant ass fucking TV. All the sports packages, right?

Speaker 1:          00:48:29       Get yourself a fucking book on, uh, on how to eat Vegan or some shit. So you stay in shape telling you and then every night you just get shit. Be fucking tremendous. Tremendous. That's what I want to do. I got to do it like that. I can't be like these athletes that I see that go around fucking acting like jerk off sell whole career. Then they're like, oh fuck, I'm in my final contract. What am I going to deal with? And they just keep playing and playing and playing. Fucking try on half the fucking jerseys in the league. That ain't going to be making, you know, just like Paulie in Goodfellas, that guy's going to die in jail. Okay. Then ain't going to me. They ain't gonna be me. Hey, smarten up. Right. I hope that didn't hurt here. It's like it just did mine. All right.

Speaker 1:          00:49:19       Let me, uh, get onto the next thing here. Um, alright. Ditched Bio lady. All right. A dear old Billy freckles. I had a date tonight with a lady and the plan was to go get dinner and then see it concert. She was really cool and we went out to a good restaurant near my apartment. Dinner went well. I was making her laugh, et cetera. And after I paid the check, I told her I had to use the bathroom. She said she would, she wait right outside the restaurant. So I went in and did my thing, but when I came out I couldn't find her. I had only taken a piss. So it's not like I was taking a long time in the bathroom. I called her and it went straight to voicemail. Then I waited around and texted her and she said that she had to leave because her friend's boyfriend had just broken up with her and that she needed to go back to the apartment right away.

Speaker 1:          00:50:12       Uh, Jesus Christ really? And she couldn't wait to say goodbye to you. I asked her if she couldn't have at least told me before she left and she said she was sorry. We both have tickets to go see a concert next week, which we had planned a before we planned, but I think it's just going to be really awkward and I don't want to do, uh, and I don't know what to do because I'm pretty sure she just ditch me. I would love to hear your Boston accent. Give me some advice. Thanks. And Go fuck yourself. Um, yeah, you either got discharge. She's unbelievably fucking rude. But yeah, you can't hit your wagon to, this is no way. There's no way you're putting a baby in that the fuck you have a baby. You know, when all of a sudden you know, she squirts it out and you're like, oh my God, look at it honey.

Speaker 3:          00:50:57       She fucking takes off again. Yeah, you can't have that.

Speaker 1:          00:51:02       She's, she, she, I dunno. I don't know what her fucking deal is, but why, what all I need to do right now, right now. Okay. You and this woman, it's fucking over.

Speaker 3:          00:51:10       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:51:11       And your be your best hope if you still want a Banger, is to stick by your guns that you, that you don't put up with the shit that it's fucking over and just be a matter of fact. Just say no. That was really rude. And I was also very immature. If you weren't having a good time, he should have just said something. Um, there, no, no, no. My girl fan boy. And then, and then on top of that, you lie to me. I mean, I'm actually glad that all of this happened because I was able to see you know, that you're not the kind of person that I would want to be in a relationship with.

Speaker 3:          00:51:39       You know, that fucks with them. Wait a minute.

Speaker 1:          00:51:43       He's not mesmerized by my pussy anymore.

Speaker 3:          00:51:46       Right.

Speaker 1:          00:51:48       Next thing you know, she's riding. Yeah. These are all just fantasies. People. I don't know if there's any of this shit's true. Um, all right, so wait, does she have one ticket and you have one ticket?

Speaker 3:          00:51:57       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:51:58       I Dunno. I Dunno what the math is on a ticky said, we both have tickets to go to the show. Well, here's the deal. If you have both the tickets,

Speaker 3:          00:52:05       okay,

Speaker 1:          00:52:05       then you just take somebody else.

Speaker 3:          00:52:08       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:52:10       Yeah. And I don't even think you'll, you don't think you over a phone call either, do you? Or maybe you do. Yeah, maybe do. I would just call him. Just say, yeah, listen, I'm taking somebody's, ah, no, no, no. Don't do that. If she has the tickets, sell, tell it. If you keep them,

Speaker 3:          00:52:26       keep them. Yeah. I don't know.

Speaker 1:          00:52:31       This thing is over, dude. You don't need me. You know what the deal is? It's fucking over.

Speaker 3:          00:52:38       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:52:38       I gotta be honest. It's fucking hilarious that she just left. I've done that. I did that when I was young and immature. I did that one time. I met this woman and she wanted to go out and go see this band. And so we went out there and

Speaker 1:          00:52:53       next thing you know, she was up on the stage dancing while the band was playing, pointing at the crowd as if she was in the band. And um, I didn't have the emotional maturity to wait till she got off the stage to be like, uh, yeah. I don't know what that was. It seemed like you were enjoying it, but, um, it, uh, you know, I'm going to go and, you know, I, I just left and I'll tell you this, I regret doing that because I think it was really mean of me to do that to her, if that's how she likes having a good time and likes going up there and dancing in front of a band that she's in and you know, in front of a group that she's not in pointing at the crowd is if she wrote the song, if that's what the fuck she likes to do, then, you know,

Speaker 4:          00:53:41       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:53:42       I guess, you know, I should have let her do that. I was, uh, the very least, they should have been a man enough to fucking walk away. So, um, trying to think is anybody. Yeah, I've had a woman do that to me too. I don't want more. One time was totally into me. It was over. It was a lay up. She was going to bang me and I went up and I had a bad set and I got off and she was gone. I bombed so bad that a woman who was willing to have sex with me thought better of it. And this is the best part. It was a festival and it was only a 15 minutes set.

Speaker 4:          00:54:20       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:54:20       In 15 minutes.

Speaker 4:          00:54:22       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:54:24       15 and I have to think that halfway through my set, because I got off stage, she was gone. So about seven minutes in, she did a one 80 and just fucking walked out. So it came back to me. Oh, it always comes back to you. All right. Crime that pays your bill. If you could get away with any, with a major crime, which would, uh, which would you be more proud of? A bank heist and art, robbery and assassination of an evil world leader. Oh, assassination all day long. That was the first thing I thought of. That was the first thing I thought of that if you went to like the last supper of every dose, making people's lives miserable, you know, pretending like, you know, they don't have, they know those people who buy up patents, so we can't get, um, energy, electricity and gas and all that shit easier. People who just fucking get in the way of that progress, rape the environment, fuck over poor people, all of those, they all go to the same meal.

Speaker 4:          00:55:22       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:55:22       All right. And you just fucking, I dunno, Yoga and like some photo or some shit with one of those guns that they have on like a fucking, I dunno, you ever see that one? That was an Argo when they went down the runway and they had that machine gun on that fucking jeep, whatever and m 60 southern people are tearing their fucking heroin right now cause they know exactly what I was like, Hey, I'm sick day made an f 60 16 years. It's an AMD 60, 80 this point buddy. Um, and you just fucking mow them down. You just mow him down and it's old and then all of a sudden, and then what bill, then who's going to run us? Cause I know it's not going to be me. Then somehow decent people all take those jobs and make the right decisions and everybody's fucking chill and there's enough for everybody and everybody can relax. Okay.

Speaker 4:          00:56:08       All right.

Speaker 1:          00:56:10       That's what I would do. Um, I would never do an art robbery because I don't have an appreciation for a lot of it, especially if it's just a bunch of scribbles, you know, if it looks like a sleeve tattoo or yeah, somebody kind of call it in your arm there, buddy. I can kind of see a bird spider web. I don't know what else is there. Um, a bank heist. I don't want to do that because, uh, that fucks with regular people's money, you know, art, robbery, then, you know, next scene or Butler's out of a job. Yeah. I probably shouldn't have said that. I had assassinated evil word leader probably put me on some fucking list, you know, just added to the fucking audio that they have been the fucking basement of the Pentagon. Um, it all, it all ends up. Y'All end up, you know, you just end up in a worker camp. I think that's how it goes from here on out. All right. Roll the dice. Dear bill and my wife has a friend who we've known for a long time and it happens to be very attractive. Let me read this again. My wife's.

Speaker 4:          00:57:10       Yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:57:10       my wife's, you have more than one wife here, buddy. My wife has a friend who we've known for a long time. It happens to be very attractive. Okay, so you've already rubbed one out to her, possibly thought about or why you're banging your wife. Okay. The other day over a couple of drinks with my wife, she admits that she wants to experience a threesome and she wants it to be with us. Oh, Jesus.

Speaker 5:          00:57:35       No.

Speaker 1:          00:57:39       Oh my God. Here we go. Here we go. Jesus, we should have closed with this question. This, this is a close bid right here. When my wife first tells me this, you can imagine my excitement, but then she adds the kicker, her friend while confessing, um, her desire for threesome ads that she has genital herpes bump on. Wow. I did not see that left turn coming, but she swears that it is dormant and we're not at risk. Well, how do you think she got it?

Speaker 4:          00:58:15       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:58:17       Oh, that's such a stupid thing to say. Maybe she fucks him guy. Well, you know, you always have to fucking, you know, look out for the women in these, maybe she fucks him. Douchebags scum bag guy. Like you've seen their fucking dig on a billboard out in La. It, it says, do you trust him? And there's a guy laying there with his shift, the look on his face with this woman looking at him, HIV positive, you know, type of thing. Well they would never have a billboard. Do you trust her?

Speaker 1:          00:58:41       It's unfucking believable. Like you know, I saw to time one of these magazines, right where it says, uh, you know, reasons women cheat top 10 reasons women cheat in the top eight out of 10 was were because of Gat was was something that guy was doing. It's fucking unbelievable. Anyways, plowing ahead. I am close to your age. So I asked you, do you roll the dice and go for it knowing that this may be your last shot of the threesome or do you play it safe and politely declined the offer? Thanks and go fuck yourself in parentheses with protection. Uh, no dude, you can't. You can't do that. You cannot do that because right now you're going to have a fucking threesome. All right? Even if you did, it's going to make it weird between you and your wife. It just is. As much as you're going to try to be cool, it's, it's, you know, you'll be cool with it.

Speaker 1:          00:59:28       She won't be on some level. She won't be, you fucking moaned a little too much with the other one. It's going to be a fucking shit show. All right? And then on top of that, you're on, or you're going to be reminded once a goddamn month that you did it. Fuck that. Fuck Carla. That all right. This is the deal. All right? If your wife is willing to fucking do it, that, why don't you do it with somebody who's a, you know what I mean? Who doesn't have any prior convictions here? All right. Get somebody with a clean slate and, um, but um, I dunno, I'm sort of a firm believer that you can't do that with your wife. You do that with somebody that you're not going to be married to. I just think, uh, you know, I don't know. You ever see that shit when people like fucking drink too much water and they die cause like the, the, the walls of their cells like burst open. Like that's what I think happens when you have a threesome with your wife and somebody else. And it's basically the lining to your relationship. It's fucking, it's split. It's done, it's over. Right. And then it becomes, then her next thing is going to be like, well, let's do it again this time. Can we do it with a guy and a, well now I want to do what a fucking guy because there's nothing in it for me. You know what I mean?

Speaker 1:          01:00:46       What the fuck? Well, there was nothing if fuck you, you enjoy the women can enjoy other women, you know, and you get into that, well that's a double fucking standard. I go, suck a dick already. Leave me out of it. I'll be downstairs. You know, you just, you just walking into that whole fucking world.

Speaker 4:          01:01:03       MMM Jesus Christ.

Speaker 1:          01:01:06       But you know, you gotta give it up to this woman for just being totally upfront. Gee, I mean that, look, there's something going on. The fact that you're excited by this and not shocked and that your wife is willing to do it. All right? You guys all seem like this is all pretty loosey Goosey here. I Dunno dude. Even with protection, they see you can still get it, dude. Fuck that. I don't know. I, I wouldn't do it. I would politely decline and then ask for references if she hasn't anybody she knows that doesn't have herpes as wants to do it. I don't, I don't know what to tell you here, buddy. Um,

Speaker 4:          01:01:47       okay.

Speaker 1:          01:01:48       I would say don't listen to your Dick. What would you tell a friend of yours if they were in that position?

Speaker 4:          01:01:57       Oh my God.

Speaker 1:          01:01:59       I guess the question I haven't asked is how hot is this woman? Is it worth the risk? I don't know. You don't want it is I, I just, I can't get beyond like, what is the conversation afterwards? Okay. You Guys Bang. First of all, do not bang in your own fucking house. Okay? You want to walk away from that crime scene. You understand? All right? But then you gotta be thinking like, okay, then you get in the car now. Fuck that. You got to have that, you know that awkward goodbye. Oh my God. Yeah, that was, that was fun. Hopefully it went well. Hopefully you don't get so excited, sir. That you fucking, uh, you know, you get a false start there. Right. Let's just hope the whole fucking thing goes well. And then he got, he got that ride home in the car. Yeah. You both get in there. You're both trying to make you don't want is, you don't know what to say. So you just making noises like sitting down and like, Heh, putting on the radio. He looked like a yeah. Got a new Costco down here. Huh? You know, God knows where the fuck her head's at.

Speaker 1:          01:03:13       I'll tell you this right now. There's no fucking way. She's not going to ask some questions. So you know, like what are you thinking right now? Oh, I would, we normally think and I'm thinking, fuck, you don't even start this shit. This is the thing. I think you have to have that conversation beforehand. If you're going to do it, you gotta say to your wife, all right, here's the deal. We're going to do this shit, but no being fucking weird afterwards. All right, none of this did you like it? And he lent jai hair my then meet and none of that. That's all off the table. All right, then what are you then? Then she's sitting on it and then you know what she do? Then she'll start crying.

Speaker 6:          01:03:57       You know, I know.

Speaker 1:          01:04:02       I'm just presenting the worst case scenario or even worse. She fucking loves it and wants to do it all the time. And then that just leads to just, ah, it's just going to lead the other shit. It's gonna lead the other shit. I Dunno. I Dunno. Who knows? It could be fun, could be fun. I just presented all the hazards that could possibly happen. Who knows? Man, you can fucking go do it. Bang, Bang, bomb. You guys never fucking talk about it again. You get to check that off the list. You know, you stare at your Dick for a good 30 to 60 days. Nothing looks funny down there. And you know what? You got away with it. Just like Woody Allen and crime and punishment, right? You just sort of get away with it. Who knows? Maybe it happens, I don't know. All right?

Let's wrap this thing up here with the final question. Um, I know what you guys do. Have you been watching hockey? Yes, I have. Yes, I have. Uh, I've been watching the Ottawa Montreal series, of course, rooting against Montreal, um, Ottawa or giving them a way tougher series. Then I thought they were going to, they played great. They just, um, Montreal is just fucking relentless, relentless. I can't even talk. I'm so fucking out of it's God damn late nights. Um, they've just been so fucking relentless and,

Speaker 3:          01:07:59       uh, I dunno, man.

Speaker 1:          01:08:04       They had to win. Obviously they had to win the last game three zero. I don't see Montreal losing four straight, although if they do,

Speaker 3:          01:08:11       mmm.

Speaker 1:          01:08:14       I will book, what can I do next week on the podcast? If they somehow lose four games in a row,

Speaker 3:          01:08:19       I don't know what I'd do.

Speaker 1:          01:08:22       It would just be the greatest thing ever. I wouldn't, I would truly enjoy it, but then I would get nervous because we did that. We blew up three games to none lead against March, uh, against the flyers and then the neck. Very next year we won the Stanley Cup. So I hope that doesn't happen. I hope they don't lose four in a row.

Speaker 1:          01:08:39       Do I? I don't fucking know. What am I talking about? All right. Mother herb. Dear Billy Bong rip. Um, Monday is four 20, and I know the Thursday podcast is now designated towards good vibes, man. While the Monday morning remains your bleak outlook on humanity, it really does. However, in the spirit of the holiday, can you please tell us something crunchy about yourself? I don't even know what that means. Perhaps a time when you connected with nature or saw the human race is won or in the least tell about a song or movie you saw. Hi. That was awesome. I love you. Love Nia. This guy wrote this when he was high. Love both of you guys, man. Um, I do. I always seen the human race's one. I've always seen it. That's why it's so fucking depressing to watch the concert, the top do what they're doing. That's why my fantasy is to take all of 'em out and then people who are actually responsible going and do the job. When they fix the world and I don't have to do anything after I'm done pulling the trigger and my life is totally easy. Maybe that's selfish. I don't know what it is. Maybe I'm an idealist. You want me to tell you something crunchy about myself? It's not enough to, you know that I make pies,

Speaker 3:          01:09:51       Huh? From scratch.

Speaker 4:          01:09:57       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:09:57       All right. You know what? I have a lemon and lime tree in my front yard.

Speaker 3:          01:10:02       All right.

Speaker 1:          01:10:04       And I get excited when I walk out there and I get to pick them off the tree, you know? And then I bring them in the house and I go, you know what? I'm going to make a key lime pie out of this.

Speaker 1:          01:10:14       And then I come back later when I realized that I forgot to tell my wife and she's fucking used the limes that I needed. See, it's still going to go back to something bleak, you know? Cause that's what's like physics. There's a, there's the balance man. You know what I mean? Man. It's like, you know when life gives you lemons, you, your wife's can eat a man and it's just, you just gotta be all right with Ted man. He's got to look down at your toes, wiggle Amenia sandals, and just kind of wait for the other ones to grow, man. You know? Um, how was that? Was that fine? Was that okay? We're in something crunchy by me. How about the fact that I'm going out to all these tertiary cities? Yes. I just did use that word. Did I pronounce it correctly? I don't think so. How about that? How about I liked going out and fucking hanging out with the people afterwards. I actually enjoy people on a one to one basis if they're not conscious. Right. I, you know what? You got me, sir. I think you stumped me. I don't know that I have anything crunchy.

Speaker 3:          01:11:10       No. Sorry. I tried.

Speaker 1:          01:11:14       What do you want from me baby seals washing up on the fucking beach has killed me this week. Is that crunchy enough for you? Okay.

Speaker 4:          01:11:23       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:11:23       It's made me not eat fish the whole fucking week. I think I might be done with fish. I'm done eating animals that we can't grow, you know, breed or whatever. Even then, I think it's, I don't know, I go back and forth with, if it makes me a piece of shit, if I eat fucking animals or if you know, they would have gotten eaten anyway. What the fuck would a cow we doin if we didn't have a fence around it? It would be walking around like a big slow dope and it'll get, you know, there'd be a fucking mountain lion around his neck within two seconds.

Speaker 1:          01:11:56       Just hang in there slowly suffocating the thing. Well, we got the decency. They have that ceiling gun hover over its head and knock them out so you can get yourself a prime god damn ribs. I know there's a lot of questions. I liked that angle, man. Try to draw it. The crunchy side of me that made me really uncomfortable. There was a nice feeling. Everyone's so why you got to get out of your comfort zone? All right, that's the podcast for this week. Go fuck yourselves. I'll check in on you on Thursday. And, uh, you know what, I'm rooting for the Tampa Bay lightening because they have been hab killers. God knows the Bruins weren't. So that is my adoptive team. I haven't watched a second of the fucking capital's islanders series that seems like it's going to be a great one. And I'm loving that the islanders in their last year in that building, uh, are going out like champs here, you know, going down, swinging. If I got the time, the Games keep coming on the east coast ones when I have shows. So I'm in central time now. Maybe I can watch the first period of, uh, what does it, I guess it's game for. All right. That's it. That's the podcast. Go fuck yourselves. I'll talk to you next week.
