Speaker 1:          00:00:01       Hey, what's going on? It's bill burn. It's the Monday morning podcasts for Monday, August 26th, 2013 what he is saying, hey fuck, oh, how are ya? How's it going? Holy Shit. Where did the summer go? You know, I always make fun of that. I always make fun of people go, Oh my God, can you believe it's already August? Um, I worked my ass off to summer, so the summer did fly by. I can't believe it. I didn't get the layout or anything and he'd get the Tan myself up and they get to read myself up at all. You know? Did you guys lay out Dick? Get a little skin cancer? Um, I am finally.

Speaker 2:          00:00:44       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:00:44       I'm finally back in Los Angeles after spending a month in New Orleans. Uh, had a great fucking time down there and did it with a on a great note. You know, I settled my differences with the city. I finally said, you know what? You win. I'm going to have some of your fried fucking food. And um, I ended up going, I went bow fishing out in the buy you a fucking bow. And Arrow, right? I got myself a six pack of Bud talls. This is America, few people overseas right now for you people over there, I don't know what we did to you and know what we're doing to you right now, what we're gonna do to you in the future that's going to make you fucking passively aggressive, aggressively attack the great game of American football. You know, cause you won't get to the real core of the issue that you don't like our foreign policy. And by our, I mean me, because I sit in on those meetings, I'm making the calls, you know, and all you fucking cunts over there who got cake every week, every week I'm getting these fucking emails that people still shit and acting like NFL football players aren't tough compared to rugby because they wear helmets. Do you realize how fucking dumb that is?

Speaker 2:          00:01:57       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:01:57       That's like saying, well you know, so basically if you're in a car you can drive it into a tree and you won't get hurt because you're in a car. Is that what you're telling me? Huh? With all your portly fucking white guys waddling around out there putting shoulders into chess. Okay? It's not what we're talking about here. We're not talking about a bunch of pasty fucking white dudes running around who can't even write a fucking five second 40

Speaker 1:          00:02:27       that's not what we're talking about at all. All right? We're talking about a game that is played at his size and speed that is not seen overseas. It just doesn't. You know why? Because you're not big enough. You're not fast enough. And you know why that is. Cause you never went to a country that was bigger and stronger and force them to come over here and do all the hard shit. See what you guys did was you fucking went to where they lived and you tried to fucking build a castle over there. Stupid, stupid fucking move. Or what happened? You lost all of it. So what do you do now? Do you own up to it and just say, you know what, America's better at pressing the world right now than we are now.

Speaker 3:          00:03:14       Okay?

Speaker 1:          00:03:14       You don't man up and say that. You send me Cunty fucking emails about a Goddamn game. I've told you from the very beginning, rugby plays is the toughest sons of bitches. You know the tough, you know, great fucking game. I really enjoy it.

Speaker 3:          00:03:30       Okay,

Speaker 1:          00:03:32       well let's not pretend then of Leon let right now rolled off the fucking couch and decide to run down the fucking pitch and some short shorts that, you know, those guys wouldn't be falling over on their backs. They would, I'm sorry. It's bigger. It's stronger. Faster.

Speaker 3:          00:03:50       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:03:51       Hence, you know, and then you put a helmet on. Now you've got a weapon. That's all it is. It protects your skull, but you fucking brains going. What do you think they are? That fucking thing. And next thing you know, you're on the roof of your house when you're 40 years old shooting at mall cops. That's what happens to our retired players. What do you guys do?

Speaker 3:          00:04:08       Huh?

Speaker 1:          00:04:10       Fucking get your ears fixed.

Speaker 3:          00:04:13       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:04:14       Finally get that Wedgie taken out of your ass. I don't know what you do. Wait, when you retire as a rugby player. I'm sorry people. I'm a little grumpy right now.

Speaker 3:          00:04:26       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:04:26       All right. Um, I finished my, uh, my acting Gig, my big song and dance number down there. I'd like to thank Mike binder. They've given me a shot on that thing. Um,

Speaker 3:          00:04:39       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:04:40       And the second I was done.

Speaker 3:          00:04:42       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:04:43       I ended up going up to Boston before I came home because I had a Gig at the, uh, the MGM.

Speaker 3:          00:04:50       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:04:50       Mgm Casino there in Connecticut, not in Las Vegas. I played the one in Connecticut, which is like going to the University of Miami, Ohio. No kidding. It was a great gig and I want to thank everybody who showed up and everything and I was in a fucking grumpy mood when I came out on that one.

Speaker 3:          00:05:10       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:05:11       I started shitting on Paul Versey. I was going off on the traffic. I've just, I just, I just really needed to go home and have a fudge it call, you know, some conference. I don't know what the fuck I need and I'm still all wound up.

Speaker 3:          00:05:24       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:05:25       Ah, fuck. Where the hell did this fucking year ago? I got to tell you this, I lost my shit. I know. I started to tell someone, Oh, both fish and I'll get back to that. Remind me, remind me to get back to the bow fishing thing. Um,

Speaker 3:          00:05:42       yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:05:42       I forgot what the fuck I was just going to talk about the, the traffic.

Speaker 3:          00:05:47       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:05:47       My fucking brain moves in a straight line of very slow but it fucking line. But it is a straight line. If I miss the exit, it just keeps going and I can't, I can't turn. Um,

Speaker 2:          00:06:00       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:06:00       See it made me fucking forget the traffic.

Speaker 2:          00:06:03       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:06:03       I lost my shit like three fucking times when I was up in Boston. All right. I fucking hate that city now. I love it. I love the sports teams, but I hate that fucking city because you land in it and the first thing you go, you drive into is that big dig, which is the biggest fucking scam I did ever perpetrated when it comes to fucking transportation. Jesus. Talk my way out of that one, didn't I? I didn't know where to go with that. How the fuck do you shit on a highway? These fucking assholes. They just took everything. They put it on the ground. They made it all one lane. Everything's fucking one lane.

Speaker 1:          00:06:44       I don't know if there were anticipating some, some plague or something. I don't know what. But that thing like this should just be like model t's out. Oh God. Driving around that fucking thing. They didn't add any lanes. Every time I go in there, the whole fucking thing. Shut down. They got the Ted Williams tunnel. You know what they should have outside the head. Ted, Ted Williams tunnel. They should have his head upside down on a tuna can, you know, like made out of concrete and tribute to and then sell his family that we're going to fucking leave that up there until you give that man the proper burial that he fucking deserves.

Speaker 2:          00:07:18       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:07:19       So anyways, you're going to fucking teddy ballgame tunnel and there is enough room for like five fucking lanes and there's only two. And then there's this, this, I don't know what this bike lane for the obese, what is the fucking e? It's never opened. And then the other one always has cones on it. Sorry. I've gone there like three times his fucking year. And no matter what time I drive in and that this fucking traffic because of that Shit, oh, I'm in a mood. I am in a mood people, I admit it.

Speaker 2:          00:07:49       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:07:49       And here's another thing. I'm driving down to my Gig, going down to the fucking MGM thing there. Mgm Miami, Ohio Gig that I had and I'm fucking two 30 on a Friday afternoon, should be wide open bumper to bumper, fucking traffic, you know, bumper to bumper, fucking traffic. And I, it got to the point, I literally wanted to roll down the window and just an ask the guy next to me, just be like, where the fuck are you going? Don't you have a job? Are you also a comedian? You know, are you, do you work the fucking night shift? Please tell me you're actually driving a job and you're not just out here to be out here. Fucking come back from the MGM thing. I get myself for fucking hours to get up to Logan Airport. No, three hours to get up to fucking Logan Airport. So I'd have a two hour fucking window to get to my goddamn plane and I and I ended up getting in bumper to bumper traffic. The second I get near the South Shore Plaza bumper to fucking bumper traffic. It's like 1230 in the afternoon on a Saturday. And where the, where the fuck,

Speaker 2:          00:08:56       what of those fucking idiots sat in traffic Monday through Friday? Did are they, do they like sitting in traffic?

Speaker 1:          00:09:05       It actually made me look up the population. I was like his is the population exploding in this country because I didn't think it was, we were doing that bed. I started doing the road hardcore around 97 98 we had about 267 million people would just say to 68 okay. Before I get some country email from somebody who works from the Census and now we're up to 313.9 so we'll call that three 14 all right. So what's said no, Jesus is going to do some math. That's 32 million plus 14 million. That's 46 million people spread out over 50 states. I don't fucking know if that's the problem with white boy. I'll tell you, they're all out on the highway. It's almost worth being president, you know, just so you don't have to sit and fucking traffic. It's almost worth just becoming an absolute yes men and signing off on shit like spying on American people, being able to put American citizens, citizens in jail indefinitely without a fucking trial just because you think they're a fucking terrorist. It's almost worth doing that. You know, Jesse, you don't have to sit in the traffic. Maybe I'll just get like a helicopter license. I'll get one of those little two seater once, you know, basically the smart car of uh, air travel

Speaker 3:          00:10:20       did. They, did they,

Speaker 1:          00:10:24       there's a lot of flat fucking things out there that you can land on structures and what are people going to do if you land on their roof and just repelled down, willing to call a tow truck. Hey, you can't leave it to, I just did. We'll be back at 20 minutes. You don't even know who the fuck the call about this. We're going to call the cops. You got to stay in here with your hands on your hips there. That is a helicopter, you know. Well fucking keep it. I don't give a shit. I'll get another one. All right. Costs me 400 bucks. Look at it.

Speaker 3:          00:11:02       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:11:04       And I'm sorry, this is just all, this is what being away from your shit for a month, dusty. And then you come home and you have a mountain of junk mail. You know, I realized that my mail, nobody sends me anything nice. I don't get one fucking, hey, just thinking about, yeah, I guess that's emails now, you know, back in the day when somebody would just, you know, cause you couldn't call him, had to have some fucking jerk off. Right? A pony with the Goddamn, I didn't ride a pony. Rode a horse. Why did they call it the Pony Express? And I would tell you guys, when I was a kid, I thought a pony was a little horse. And eventually it grew into a horse. So he's fucking people down the street at a pony. It was ridiculous. He had it tied up to the back of their house. I don't think they had a fence. Fucking, I'll maybe the little bit of offense listening, just stood there.

Speaker 3:          00:11:56       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:11:56       With drive and buy the thing for years. And I finally looked over at my mother. I'm just like, I'm like one of one, does that pony going to turn into a horse? She just sort of looked at me, you know, I didn't realize that look when I was a kid, but I realize it now where's, she just was like,

Speaker 3:          00:12:13       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:12:14       She was literally looking at me like, who did I meet with that, that d that came out of me and just asked me that.

Speaker 3:          00:12:27       Oh Shit.

Speaker 1:          00:12:29       Anyways, so I want to thank everybody who came out to, uh, the MGM and, uh, Connecticut, wherever the Hell I was fucking beautiful out there. That's the one thing I do like. And then one thing I really do miss about living out here in La is a, I miss all those trees and the lakes. I love that shit.

Speaker 3:          00:12:49       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:12:50       You know, I'm gonna be one of those douchebags at fucking sells his house here in the city and just goes out and gets a ranch kid. Even fucking change a light bulb by the whole outfit, you know?

Speaker 3:          00:13:02       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:13:02       Big stupid cowboy, handsome chaps getting in and out in and out of my prayers, you know? No, I can drive my old truck. That's what I do now. Before I went in town to get provisions, I just roll around in the dark to make it look like I was actually out doing something.

Speaker 3:          00:13:19       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:13:22       Oh Christ. Um, anyways, oh, you know what? Let's, let's bang out lumps, bang out a little fucking a shit. Wait, no, Nada. You know what? I started talking about the bowl fishing. Let's, let's finish it. So my last night there, I get invited out to go fishing and uh, I was just like, yeah, I'll fucking do that. Shoot fish with a bow and arrow. I have, I don't know how to do that, but I would like to know how to do it. Why not? Right? So we fucking go out there. It's like a group of, uh, four and we meet these guys at a gas station. You got to get a fishing license and all this shit. And uh, you know, I got a six pack of Budweiser. I mean, you're getting on a boat. I mean, you have to, where I'm from, you have to do that. If you're getting on a boat, you have to have a six pack of something and you've got to drink it or else you're an asshole. So I got it. And one of the guys is like, dude, you're going to have a weapon.

Speaker 3:          00:14:23       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:14:23       It's like, yeah, well I'm not gonna be pointing it at you or me pointed at the fish. Let's, let's try to make this a little sporting here. You know?

Speaker 1:          00:14:33       Good. It's not like I'm taking a stick like Tom Hanks in that fucking movie. What he talked to the soccer ball cast away. Well, sad, right? Did we went out on this fan vote? Yay. Nay. All the way out in the fucking buy you, it was terrifying. It was fucking to second we got out there was, because we did it at night. It was a full moon was the shit, you know what I kept thinking of, you know that movie southern comfort with powers booth. That's what I thought about and I've felt good that I was thinking about that. Not Deliverance cause I feel like that's Hacky at this point. You know, one fat pasty dude gets banged in the ass in the woods and nobody can remember southern comfort after that. It's fucking ridiculous. I think it's high time that stops. All right. So anyways, um,

Speaker 2:          00:15:19       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:15:19       It was, it was, it was amazing. Basically when you both fish, I don't know, I don't know where to even begin this shit. The guy had like a flashlight, one of these born in the by you guys and he go right there, right there, right there, right there to the bone arrows trying to shoot some fish. That was this fucking chilling out.

Speaker 3:          00:15:40       And uh,

Speaker 1:          00:15:42       basically what you do is, is you shoot wherever you, wherever the fish looks like it is, you shoot like five inches below it because it's an illusion man. Cause a little water. So it took a little bit of time to get to use that. So what I did was I started aiming it all these small fish just bring in the bow up cause I realized I was just shooting, I wasn't aiming, I was just kind of shooting in the general direction. I kept missing. So I was practicing on the little fish. I didn't shoot at him. I would just bring it up just to get the muscle memory and a, I did all right. I hit, I hit three and about, um, three hours average, like one an hour. It was a lot of looking for them. I'm not going to lie yet, so I wasn't that bad, but I missed a lot. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:16:25       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:16:27       But I got three including one. We fucking pull this thing in and it was, uh, had an alligator face and the back look like an eel is call an alligator gar. The thing looked beyond evil, look like a fucking dinosaur. And we got in a boat and they're like, all right, watch out. Watch your feet. Don't let it bite you. Don't let it bite you and all that shit. And he's like, dude, you got to get a picture with that. You got blood on your face. It looks fucking awesome. Everybody's saying all this shit. You know, I got to tell you, you tap into that inner fucking caveman. Cause when I went out there, I immediately had this sinking feeling like I can't go back to fucking the village without bringing home something to eat that's still in me. And the village was my fucking hotel room where I have room service.

Speaker 1:          00:17:12       It was fucking stupid. But I literally felt that I don't want to be the guy that doesn't fucking get something. So anyways, it's now feeling like a fucking man, cause I killed this God damn thing. And uh, I dunno. So I'm like, all right, so what do we do where, you know, we killed a bunch of fish and I asked the guy, go, can you, you guys are going to, you know, clean these things. You put the fucking meet on ice or some shit and ship it to me and the guys just like, yeah, no,

Speaker 3:          00:17:39       Nah.

Speaker 1:          00:17:45       So then I was like, well, what the fuck would you Saudia killin shit. And it just kind of bugged me. Oh No. What's going on here? How come I'm not getting any readings here?

Speaker 2:          00:17:56       Yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:17:56       I think it's recording. What the fuck is going on with my mixer? Oh, was it just saying it's really loud. What is this? What is this? Come on. Come on. Talk to me. Talk to me. What's wrong with my mixer at Jesus Christ? Now I gotta I gotta shut this off. I'm going to splice this together. You're not going to notice, but I gotta make sure I'm recording here. Hang on.

Speaker 1:          00:18:19       All right, so it was recording and I'm, what the fuck's going on with the mixer? What did I do? What did I do too? It gives a shit. So anyway, so yeah, so at that point I was like, all right, well I killed three of these things. The other two that I shut, they will fucking beautiful. Really thick. And I was like, you know, if I'm going to kill these things, I want to fucking eat it. I just want to be putting holes in shit. But I anyways, the, I guess that alligator Gar think can survive out of the water for a couple hours. So we were able to put that one back or they said they were going to, so I don't know. That's the only part I didn't like. Other than that, it was fucking great and uh, yeah, it felt like it was in like a Mad Max movie. Thoroughly enjoy it. Just next time I do it, I only want to kill like one, you know, or killed like two or three and then fucking

Speaker 2:          00:19:05       okay,

Speaker 1:          00:19:05       clean up, take it in, fucking eat it for the week.

Speaker 1:          00:19:09       Does that make sense? That's how it made me feel bad was I went home and I looked up the alligator Gar and I was waiting for it to be out of the most vicious fucking alligator eel this side of the fucking Mississippi, Yada Yada. And they did, it was just like, yeah, it's kind of, it's very docile if it sees you, it's shy and swims away. I was like, Oh man, I shot a fucking nerd, an ugly nerd fish with an arrow. And I judged it because of its face. Like it was evil, you know? I don't know.

Speaker 2:          00:19:42       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:19:42       The people I went with, they also hunt wild pigs. That's, that's something else I could shoot. I could shoot a fucking pig dear. I couldn't do that. Who's kidding? Who? If I was starving I could do it.

Speaker 2:          00:19:54       You know,

Speaker 1:          00:19:55       she would have fucking cat if I was hungry. Hungry enough. Does anything I learned from reading that fucking book fly boys and no, that's not about a boy band.

Speaker 2:          00:20:05       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:20:06       You know what's up Brooklyn? We are flow. I'm sorry, I saw the vms were on tonight. What's the deal with venues? I know a lot of people say this, but doesn't MTV have a lot of fucking balls? They don't show videos, but they still have their video music awards. You know, I know that's completely hacky, but like I actually saw some of the videos, I'm like, he's a fucking great videos. I wish they would show them. Where can I see these? How do I know this music is out? Where do I go now? Can anybody help me? Oh, Kenya. Um, all right, let's do a little bit of advertising here for this week, everybody. All right. Dollar Shave Club. Darla, there are so many things in the world that irritate me. Traffic at two 30 in the afternoon on a Saturday or a Friday. You know, stewardesses who just love talking on that microphone. We want to thank you for flying. American Airlines are flying time two days, three hours, 22 minutes and 18 seconds. He's going to be a time different. Shut up lady.

Speaker 1:          00:21:17       Um, when so many things can irritate you. Why add razors to the list that doesn't make any sense, does it? It's time to stop milking your razor blade. Everybody I know with brand name razors, you're used to paying outrageous prices and exhausting those raises until they start to look like rusty soda cans and start carving up your face there. It's time to move on. Move on to a better world. Dollar Shave Club delivers amazing quality blades to your door for just a few bucks a month. Everybody never think about it again.

Speaker 4:          00:26:46       yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:26:47       the powers that be shit over there in Syria, Damascus, whatever the fuck it is for possible using chemical weapons.

Speaker 4:          00:26:55       I Dunno,

Speaker 1:          00:26:56       some of the Shit we've done. We got a lot of fucking nerve.

Speaker 4:          00:27:00       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:27:00       Is this thing recording? What is with my God damn electronics this week? And I know, you know what bells stop blaming the technology. Why don't you man up? Um, yeah, you gotta read this book. It's really just balanced and it just shows the fucking horrific shit that basically the, uh, the the Americans did and the Japanese did to each other. And then also the unbelievable heroic stuff that they did. The whole God damn thing, every color of the rainbow. Um, I don't know how to talk about it without fucking ruining the book.

Speaker 4:          00:27:36       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:27:38       I Dunno, it, it just, uh, I can tell you one fucking stories can help. Douchebags aren't going to read it. If you listen to this podcast is no way you read. I'll tell you one quick story. All right. This will probably take two minutes. If you want to fucking fast forward. They're going into bond. This god Damn Island shaped like a horse shoe, right? And the thing is, is what? They're bombing.

Speaker 1:          00:28:00       All right. He's right in the, uh, like, you know, you know what a horse shoe looks like, right? Sure. We all do. We all have a fucking crazy uncle. It has a horse, don't you? Or a pony. All right. The bottom of the horse shoe, not the two ends with a luck runs out if he's hanging upside down right there. Like you're going around the going around the corner, right, right down there. What part of the Horse Shoe was that called? You know, it's funny. People do crossword puzzles. Know what that part of the horse shoes called.

Speaker 1:          00:28:24       Anyways, that part down there, like if you're pouring water into a way where would gather we got it Phil. That's where the fucking radio station was. And they had to basically fly right into it. All right. But on the sides, that's where the mountains were. They were actually above where the airplanes will, they'll just, the mountains on the sides were so high up and these guys had to come and so low that the antiaircraft fire was coming down on them and these guys had to have the fucking balls. 20 years old, 1920 years old to fly in there and just be like, well, they're not going to get me. The other guys got to get it and no one full. Well that if they got caught, they were going to get fucking tortured and just, they basically told them to keep one in the chamber.

Speaker 1:          00:29:06       It just fucking blow your brains out because if these guys catch you after the Shit you've done, um, you know, because once, once, once, once airplanes got involved, uh, I guess way more civilian started to get killed. And I know that sounds obvious, but like I never really thought about that. I thought back in the day like the revolutionary wars. I mean, I thought people just, you know, just indiscriminately raped and pillaged and went all the way around. I guess she could, but uh, you had to be a man about it, you know? Yeah. He kicked open the door, you know, kill a couple of males and then tackle somebody in a house coat, you know, all kinds of scratches. Do you face? I mean, yeah, you fucking got, you got dirty, you got dirty back in the day. Then all of a sudden the advent of the air, Ariel, Ariel type plane there, right. This does this sound as dumb as it sounds to me out loud. They fuckin you could just fly over, you know.

Speaker 4:          00:29:59       Okay,

Speaker 1:          00:29:59       you're trying to hit a warehouse yet a house. You blow up a couple of babies and stupid, they fucking hated these pilots. They thought they were cow, that, that thought they would devils and uh, so they didn't want to get caught or whatever. So this fucking guy is flying in antiaircraft fire comes in the flack as what they call it, fleck. That's what I call my boss would give me shit for not unloading a truck quick enough. That's what I called flack. At 20 years of age, these guys had such big balls, that's what they call people trying to shoot down the fucking airplane they were in. So it's basically like softball size holes that go on through this guy's fucking wings and he loses it and he goes into his spin. So he tells the two guys in the back that they got to bail out to, he's got to do this move where he brings up like the, the the fucking flap on the right wing and then something with the Rodrigo.

Speaker 1:          00:30:55       They basically causes the plane to kind of go sideways and it gives these guys a chance to open the door in the back because if they couldn't, the air pressure would like hold it tight. So the guys doing this move as the front of his plane is on fire and the flames a lap and at his feet he's doing this maneuver so his buddies can get out and it works. Both his buddies jump out and now the fucking plane, it's almost going to hit the goddamn water. It's in a flat spin. This guy takes off his seatbelt, he's still fighting it. You take the seatbelt off, that's the last thing you get out. And at the last second he catches it and he comes out of the spin raw and goes up and then he looks back, seen as two buddies fucking landing in the water and they're going to swim and get taken prisoner by the Japanese. And the guy was completely

Speaker 4:          00:31:43       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:31:43       You couldn't eat. Unconsolable landed on the aircraft carrier was just balling. Just all he could say over and over again was I took my seatbelt off, meaning I was going to bail out. It was just, you know, it's just fucking, I, I butchered that story. Just imagine someone who could actually write, telling you that story. It's a fucking unbelievable book. It'll make you a better person when you read it. And, um, Jesus Christ, I, I think I'm going to read a whole bunch of books on World War Two, no spin and in and, and like the, uh, the part of the war. I wanted to say specifically the Pacific Ocean and I just don't feel those words go, go together well.

Speaker 4:          00:32:26       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:32:27       Particularly the Pacific Ocean part of it, cause I, all that shit. Okinawa. He would g might, I don't know where any of that shit was. They had a map and everything. You don't dummy like me. Actually it was, it was really,

Speaker 4:          00:32:39       if

Speaker 1:          00:32:40       it's all going to be a book like that where they show the dirt on both sides. That's the kind of shit that I like.

Speaker 3:          00:32:45       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:32:46       Just fire bombing cities. This is fucking unreal.

Speaker 3:          00:32:52       You know,

Speaker 1:          00:32:53       you basically on both sides in a war, if she got war criminals and then whoever wins gets to prosecute the other one going, how could you be such a piece of shit? And everybody kind of did the same shit.

Speaker 3:          00:33:06       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:33:07       That's what I was saying. The bow and arrows with the babies basically when shit goes down, like babies die. It's unavoidable. Does this make any sense? It's this fucking horrific. I'm like 300 pages down this fucking road and you guys haven't read the book yet, so you probably looking at me like I'm a maniac. Why the fuck is it so hot in here?

Speaker 3:          00:33:27       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:33:29       Anyways, hopefully I'm able to get this podcast up on time. You know, last week I recorded it on time and there was something going on with the God damn recording. Wow. Who's kidding? Who? You know what that something was? It was me. So I actually recorded it on Sunday and still couldn't get it up until fucking Monday afternoon. I'm the worst. All right. What have we talked about? Oh yeah. So I started reading up on all this, this stuff about the, uh, the, the war with the Japanese and shit. And I didn't realize, do you know that was like three guys, three Japanese soldiers that didn't surrender until 1974. One of them wasn't aware that the war wasn't over. We'll call him a bill. That's some shit I would have done. Uh, the other, other two guys knew the war was over, but they will, like, I'm not fucking standard down until the, the fucking Grand Poobah tells me too, cause that's what I was told when I went. They just were like, Dudley do right's these fucking maniacs.

Speaker 3:          00:34:26       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:34:26       Stayed in the woods for an extra 30 years in their uniform. Their guns still work. They still in ammunition. Well of course you did. The fucking war is over. And every once in a while they'd run it, some local fishermen and they take shots at them, local fishermen. It was just like, come on man, let it go, man. It's over. They would drop leaflets in there and they were reading them and they thought it was a trick.

Speaker 3:          00:34:53       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:34:54       Oh my God. Just sitting out there fucking eat and squirrels for 30 goddamn years. Yeah. Best friends like are they gonna fucking Huh.

Speaker 3:          00:35:03       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:35:03       What, what, what'd you be friends without there?

Speaker 3:          00:35:06       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:35:07       I don't know. I'll give you the link to that shit before it just butcher it anymore. Um, if anybody else knows any really good books about World War II where it's really balanced.

Speaker 3:          00:35:16       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:35:17       Cause I read a few, I read this one. That was great. Uh, I read the rape and Nan King along time ago. I read this Hiroshima diary about this guy who was in that city when the bomb hit.

Speaker 3:          00:35:29       Uh,

Speaker 1:          00:35:31       I ran another one. I like those first part. Like people who were there. I read one one time about

Speaker 1:          00:35:39       this Jewish kid who was on the run with his dad. It's a classic too. I forgot what the fuck was called. I'm such an idiot. But at one point he was kind of looking at his dad and he was just like, just die already. Cause he was, I dunno, it was slowing them down or something. He has his guilt about that. She was fucking unreal. Actually. It's Kinda depressing when you think about it, but I'm out too. It gives a shit. Hey, I got all caught up and breaking bed. I didn't have AMC my hotel. So why I came here just binge watched all fucking three of them. Jesus Christ. Is that the greatest fucking show ever? I don't want to over hype it, but uh,

Speaker 4:          00:36:15       yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:36:16       fucking insane. I'm not going to talk about, I know I shouldn't. I should have said right out of the back then. I'm not going to say anything that happens in them, but um, I didn't think anything was going to beat the wire. I guess I put them on par because the wire, just the size of the subject. And how many different angles they hit it from. But as far as keeping your stomach and absolute fucking nuts, uh, I don't know if I ever saw a show like, like this one man. Um, it's kind of funny cause I always have like quick little scenes of him and that's all they would ever give me is just like the little scene. So I don't know what, I don't know what's going on, which is kind of perfect because my character doesn't need to know, doesn't need to know what is going on and wouldn't know. Right. Saw would just call me up and say, just fucking do this. And I'd be like, all right. So I always end up watching the episodes. I'm like, oh, that's what the fuck that was for. Um, that happened this week. All right. So anyways, hey, I'll put the red sox are coming out to la, beat the fucking dog. Just, I would've loved to go into a game down there and, and not war any red sock shit because fucking la fans are such fucking psychopaths. Well, maybe they actually, maybe they wouldn't have beaten me because I wasn't there with my children.

Speaker 1:          00:37:43       Fucking pieces of shit. Good God Almighty. You know I wanna know what the fuck you want to know what happened out here. I don't get it. I don't get why that's that extra level, that gang bang or vibe is out here. There's gangs every fucking city.

Speaker 4:          00:38:01       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:38:02       Are these like in la? I like these. The only our southern California is just say, cause I felt that vibe at a charges game too. Like is this like the only part of the country where gang or into like sports too.

Speaker 4:          00:38:16       You know,

Speaker 1:          00:38:18       you think he gets some hard, looks at a fucking next, game it down everybody's, they're having a good time.

Speaker 4:          00:38:23       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:38:24       I don't understand it. They're going to have something to do with neck tattoos. Why don't you get the neck tattoo? I say it was fucked up when I was in New Orleans. I saw two guys face tattoos and I couldn't believe how uh,

Speaker 2:          00:38:41       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:38:41       Unshocking they were at this point. I've seen so many people with face tattoos at this point. This guy literally had one right in the middle of his forehead and it wasn't a good one. You know, Jesus Christ. I thought I was dedicated to being a comedian or whatever. You put a tattoo on your face. I mean that you've limited yourself to I get either working in a tattoo parlor or doing just illegal shit.

Speaker 1:          00:39:10       Right. That's kind of a good way, you know, if you ever think that you don't, you don't, you don't have the balls to stop following the heard. Just get a nice, you know what? Don't do it. Don't, don't do it. I don't want to suggest to you get a fucking face tattoo. Please don't do that. Can you? Can you please not do that. Um, did I mention I was at the University of Cincinnati last night, Saturday night by the time he gets it. So it'll be two nights ago. I want to thank everybody for having me out there. What a fucking beautiful school that is.

Speaker 2:          00:39:37       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:39:38       Absolutely gorgeous man. I love those. Those, they have like the perfect size football stadium and it's like built down in it, so into the campus. You know, she come walking by and it's really open. Like you can just walk right into it. Um, had that same vibe. Like when I went down to Florida state, I like the students can like, you know, run the stairs if they want to. I love that shit. I hate when you go to those places and they got the stadiums like all locked up. Um, I was surprised when I went to Boise.

Speaker 2:          00:40:07       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:40:08       You know, when I was trying to look at the blue turf, I saw a little bit of it that, that the whole stadium was just locked up like that. I think it boys, he's a cool place. Right.

Speaker 1:          00:40:16       What are you worried about the meth heads coming in, stealing the aluminum benches? Is that what it is? It probably is. I don't know. Oh, by the way, I want to thank rolling Stone magazine for putting me on the cover this month. It finally happened for me. That was a, a big moment, my career. Oh, we'll definitely have a link. I know a lot of people don't read magazines at this point, so it's not a big deal, but it's a big deal to me. Finally being on the cover of rolling stone. Um, actually I don't, I have no idea who that kid is, but if fucking freaked me out when I saw it. Um, all right. What am I talking about here? What do I got here? What am I going to go to the, uh, as the straight up it was for you to fucking read one of these things here.

Speaker 1:          00:41:01       Why don't we do that? Why don't we read a little fucking letter full moon. Mr. Barr, you mentioned something about the full moon in last week's podcast and I would cause the strange behavior. I worked in an emergency room for three to five years and when I started working there, I thought that theory was bullshit. You actually said both. I don't want to make this guy sound crass. He goes, I now know, I now know what to be true. Every month during the week of the full moon, we get a surge of patients other than the plethora of fatties that clog our department. He spelled it plethora. Uh, we get Weirdos, example, a one legged schizophrenia man with a suitcase of knives in a butane torch. I don't even, I don't even know why.

Speaker 4:          00:41:50       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:41:50       Other than the other than the Weirdos though, we have a lot of really sick patients come in. There are more strokes, heart attacks and other serious health related issues. I have recently heard a theory on why this is from another healthcare professional. Well thank God you went in this direction buddy. Cause I thought half a fucking second. You were going to put this in my lap. All right. Cause I have no clue about any of this shit. Um, all right. What do we got here? He goes, I, I to take a lot of what I hear is fact. All right. The theory is the theory is this, even our blood has its own tide.

Speaker 4:          00:42:27       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:42:28       Jd says Christ, why don't I read up on science? This is like better than any fucking movie. Just the truth.

Speaker 4:          00:42:34       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:42:35       What do you mean it has its own tide

Speaker 1:          00:42:39       when it goes out as does that when I get lightheaded, is that what you're talking about? Uh, he goes, this may be minuscule. I love that you're spelling all these words wrong and you fucking work in an emergency room. Uh, but the lunar pole on our bloodstream can cause a person with health slash heart problems to be at a higher risk for stroke slash heart attack. It can also cause behavioral changes because of the change in our bodily function and our body function. Whether this is true or not, I cannot deny three and a half years of dealing with hell every week. The full moon appears. Thanks for the free imitate entertainment and the lefts. So that's really interesting. So like,

Speaker 4:          00:43:19       yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:43:19       if that's true. So when there's a full moon, that's like a, when societies like menstruating, that's our once a month.

Speaker 4:          00:43:28       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:43:29       Like everybody just acts like a fucking maniac, a one legged schizophrenia with a suitcase full of knives and a butane torch. Jesus Christ. Doesn't that sound? That sounds like, what the fuck was that movie Mickey Rourke was in that? Look like a cartoon, but it wasn't. Jessica Alba had the chaps on and she was a stripper. But you, she still looked like you could have her as a girlfriend. And then there was that guy with the yellow head and the red eyes for some reason. Remind me of the guy who played Beretta. Do you know I saw him when I was out here. I saw Robert Blake. That's a hell of a thing. Ryan to a guy or fucking killed somebody.

Speaker 4:          00:44:08       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:44:09       What did he get off? I Dunno. He fucking did it. Jesus Christ. You're going to do a spaghetti Freddy's. You know, you got to take a piss and all of a sudden you girlfriends shot in the head and nobody saw anything and you found her. C'Mon. C'Mon Beretta for reals. Come on. Um, alright. Wisconsin's a rod. Yo Billy red face. Love the, and I would love to paint another picture of the AE rod story. Alright. My version is with no, Ryan Braun. I live in Wisconsin where Aaron Rodgers and the Green Bay packers are basically a gift from God. I am a Chicago bears fan, so I think basically, so I think they're all cunts. Sorry, I'm really reading worse than usual. Um, all right. Brian who also got popped for PDS had opened two restaurants with Aaron Rogers called the eight to 1208 12 [inaudible] bar and grill since they were both named Mvp and their respective sports.

Speaker 1:          00:45:07       And I'm gathering that his number is eight. Is He a baseball player? I don't watch baseball. Uh, when the news broke about Braun getting suspended, Wisconsin was enraged. Not so much that he was cheating or being the bad image to kids or whatever. These parents who want to blame mother the others for the kids' lack of luster or athletic skills, but because he lied to Aaron Rodgers, that's fucking awesome. They're Wisconsin has some great sports fans and I love the fact that their, their fan base owns a part of the team. I where the fuck that works, even though you know, none of them are allowed in the board meeting. It's probably just by name only. And some day they'll realize how bad they got fleeced. Um, anyways, in the past month or so when it came to the news reporting, the reporting, this story, local NBC, ABC, Fox and CBS affiliates, within 10 seconds into the story, they talk about lying to Aaron Rodgers when interviewing fans about it. All they talk about is, I can't believe he would lie to us and even lie to Aaron. Like everyone knows each other on a personal level. People need to quit talking, taking professional sports too seriously and taking it personally, especially when they are multimillionaires. Line to other multimillionaires. Google search some of this to get a laugh at how brainwashed sports fans in my state are come to show Milwaukee during the football season to see for herself. I've been up there. It's fucking great. Thanks. And Go fuck yourself. Um,

Speaker 1:          00:46:36       well look, I mean he, how did he lie to Aaron?

Speaker 4:          00:46:40       Yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:46:41       they got in business together. You know, it's not like he got on their football team and then he said, well, you know, I'd like you to join the packers as long as your steroid free. They opened a business together. I don't give a fuck what you do. Just don't steal from the register. That would be more lying to Aaron Rogers, right? Or do you think he actually sat down and said, well listen, I have a great image. You know, last thing I needed to be doing is hitching my wagon to some guy who's then going to be a, a, you know, you know, fucking hookers and uh, uh, but somebody stick a needle in his death. I, you know what? I've never opened a business as you can tell. I don't know. I don't know how the interview process goes, but I don't, yeah, I don't feel like he'd lied to Erin.

Speaker 4:          00:47:27       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:47:27       MMM. Maybe. Maybe they actually came up with this. Maybe this is a good cop, bad cop thing that don't with this other guy plays the bad guy. And then Erin sits at the bar looking all dejected and the cheese heads walked by and then they come in and they buy more fucking Mozzarella sticks. You know that that could happen. Right? I don't fucking know who gives a shit. You know what the fucking thing is? And I'm telling you, I'm pulling a Paul Versey and I said this three years ago, within 20 years, everybody's going to be on steroids. Everyone's going to be on Hgh, okay? We're all going to be on it. They're going to fucking get it to the same way we'd is gradually becoming legal. That's what's going to happen with roids. All right? And now how also if you smoke weed now, if you have a vaporizer, you just basically inhaling just the shit that gets you high. All right? So it's doing way less damaged to sitting down drinking a bunch of Budweiser like I did on that fan bulb out in the fucking buy you. They're going to do that with roids. Back in the day, you did some fucking Roids, right? You ball shrunk up and you went and you punched a horse in the fucking face.

Speaker 1:          00:48:41       That's what happened. And now they're, they're way more mellow. Although fuck Jerry Rameys kids snapped. I Dunno. Jesus Christ. That's another fucking Boston story.

Speaker 1:          00:48:53       You don't want to, when all these, all these, uh, stories came out, all this shit that's happened recently, how was actually thinking? Well, you know, this is the balance. We had such an unbelievable decade. It has to balance it out. You know, with all this horrible shit happened and now and it's like now wait a minute now it was nothing but horror. So with those championships that made us even, so now there's some horrible shit common these last couple of years. So you know what that means. We're going to win some more championships coming up. That's how I look at it. Oh, by the way, any San Francisco 49 fans listening to this, how do you feel about all fucking capper, nick out there fucking on the cover of every magazine. Half naked with his fucking ass in the air showing off his tattoos and his abs doing commercials and all that type of shit. You'd think he won the fucking super bowl. Have you seen one God damn commercial with Joe Flacco? Huh? Have you? I haven't as a football fan. I don't like when that shit happens. I'll tell you right now, once Tom Brady started experimenting with his haircuts, you walking around with Doug's going to fashion shows. I don't know. We have one 1 cents. Doesn't that sound like some typical moron shit that you'd hear on Sports Talk Radio? Lorena car I had when I was in Boston was tuned to sports talk radio and I, I can't fucking listen to it.

Speaker 1:          00:50:14       It's just a dumb, I was, I put it on and they were criticizing big papi saying he's a selfish player and all it's classic Boston fucking morons sports where it's just inevitable. They're gonna eat their own. You mean the guy who fucking helped was one of the main factors in ending that curse. The 86 year curse of the Babe, all of that fucking horse shit. That guy should be able to shit in the street for the rest of his fucking life. Not even 10 years later. You're already saying that the guys selfish. Shame on you. Boston sports talk radio. Shame on you. All right, let's get back to the podcast here. Sorry guys. Um, so I'm actually predicting, Nah, you guys might have a little bit of a hangover there in San Francisco. You coach is putting on weight, right? Filling out those dockers more and more every week.

Speaker 1:          00:51:08       Trying to will his people to win. Actually, I think Catherine is going to do great, but I always get nervous with quarterbacks who run around like that. Eventually those linebackers, they get sick of that shit and a, they get an open shot at you and they, uh, next thing you know, you're bleeding into your lungs. Um, advice for a skinny guy. All right, here we go. A day a Billy boy first till that first time. Long time. Thanks for all the last there. No worries. All right. It's great that you're helping out those who are overweight by shaming them. Is that what you're saying? I've helped out a couple of, I've probably had other people have their face in a bucket of KFC right now. Uh, but if I may, I'd like to ask for advice for a guy who's a little on the thin side of the spectrum. I'm tall, six foot seven and weight around 155 160 pounds. Dude, I can't fucking help you. You six, seven one five. I weighed one 55 and high school and I swear to God, I looked like I was going to get blown down the street.

Speaker 2:          00:52:06       Yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:52:06       Jesus Christ, Dude.

Speaker 2:          00:52:09       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:52:09       Even though I eat quite a bit any regularly.

Speaker 2:          00:52:13       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:52:13       I even also have protein slash meal supplement drinks in between though. Don't fucking drank those things. I don't know shit about no, but don't drink those. Thanks. That's fucking powder thing that comes into that. That breaking bad fucking oil drum. Don't, don't do that dude.

Speaker 2:          00:52:32       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:52:33       All those supplements and all that type of shit. Don't fucking do that. All right. Just accept who you are. We all want to look up a little bit better. All right. Believe me. Trust me on this one. You're going to fill out all right. It happens whether you want it or not. So enjoy the fact that you can kind of eat whatever the fuck you want to, but I, I, my gut tells me to, I don't fuck around with shit like that, that creatine and that, that fucking muscle milk stuff and all that shit. You turn it around the back. You can't even pronounce half the shit that's in it. There's no fucking way that that stuff's good for you. There's no way that that thing, it's going to be better for you than sitting down eating a nice grass fed fucking steak there. Um, granted, I don't know shit about nutrition, but I'm also not a fucking moron.

Speaker 3:          00:53:24       Okay. Right.

Speaker 1:          00:53:26       Anyways, he goes, my siblings are just as tall as I am and they are not been like me. I'm also 23. Is that metabolism dude, I'm not a doctor. I don't know. Well, I pass this stage. I don't know. I am somewhat comfortable with myself and I have a smoke and girlfriend of five years. Well, go fuck yourself then to come on. Who loves me for who I am, but wouldn't mind a few pounds. Oh, wait a minute. She bring it up. Should I binge on Pasta? Thanks bill. I bought the raises because of you, while I helped the razors workout for you. Jesus Christ do with your height. You probably need to order them twice. Um, now dude, listen, listen, listen, listen. You gotta be who the fuck you are. All right. Would you ever say to your girl like, Hey, you know, I'd like it if you lost a few. He can't. You know, I dunno if she just made one comment and forgot she even said it or she, she's literally given you a body image. But I'll tell you, do one of the greatest things you can ever do in life is except yourself. All right? And I'm not saying like, Hey, you know, I'm doing something unhealthy to myself and I accept it. I don't mean that. I mean like, except what the fuck you look like and uh, and, and, and just,

Speaker 3:          00:54:39       you know,

Speaker 1:          00:54:41       just be a good shit and it, everything falls into place. You don't need to go out there and drink muscle milk and he fucking angel hair pasta, you know, set your alarm and get up at three in the morning and go eat that shit. You're 23 years old. You're supposed to be in good shape. All right. Okay. So you're a little fucking underwear. Who gives a fuck? Dude? You know, you're built like you built like snoop Dogg, he seems to be doing fine,

Speaker 3:          00:55:06       you know? Um,

Speaker 1:          00:55:10       I, I would, I would not try to gain any weight. I wouldn't try to lose any weight. I would just just keep doing what you're doing. All right. You're a guy, you're six foot seven, you weigh about 160 pounds at 23 and you have a smoking hot girlfriend and loves you for who you are. And she made one fucking comment about putting a few more pounds off by this. Let, let that, let that go right by you. I wouldn't even worry about that. All right. You're a good man. You'll, you'll look how you're supposed to look. All right. Put that fucking powdered nuclear waste away. I don't know what the fuck that shit does. The kidneys or your liver or whatever. But uh,

Speaker 3:          00:55:45       no.

Speaker 1:          00:55:46       When the ingredients look like the last name of Russian hockey players, you know, or the fucking Swedes, I think the Swedes got the most difficult names. That's, that's a good time to fucking, you know,

Speaker 1:          00:55:57       the only time to eat shit like that is if you're orbiting the earth. Other than that, you know, go to a farmer's market like a God damn human being. All right. Organizing porn. Uh, bill on a recent podcast, you complained about the difficulty of searching porn on the road. Did I? I thought I was talking about how I wanted to stop watching porn. I might've said that on a podcast and in the past and you just listened to it. I don't fucking know. But recently I've been trying to down on it, I've been trying to watch an only on Sundays and that's not a slap to the face to whoever created all of this shit. It's just, you know, Sunday's a day arrest and I like to be totally relaxed. If I can open up to you guys a little bit. I'm sorry. All right.

Speaker 1:          00:56:44       Anyways, he says as I also have a job that requires me to travel a lot. I know all too well. The frustration of unreliable Internet connections and the sheer amount of time wasted on searching for the perfect porn video. So let me tell you about a little trick I recently discovered paying for porn. I know paying for pouring feels counterintuitive, but it's worth it. Um, here's what you do. Well, this is the reason why and I'll pay for porn is because I don't want my credit card on the porn site. And then if they double swipe it, I don't want to have to call the credit card company saying that, you know, you just Dotcom fucking double swiped my credit card and I'm really upset by it. Or no, even worse, they call me up, you know, you know, did you a fucking, I don't know. I can't even come up with a good fucking did you? Uh, ass bag 9,000. Did you fucking rent that? No. Did you rent fucking scumbag on the ass bag returns? Yeah. Yeah, I ordered that one. No, I'm kidding. I'm not into. Amanda does get everybody the German kind or the, or like the shit that scat man Crothers did I ever tell you how much I hate to sketch thing?

Speaker 1:          00:57:59       I'll tell you one of the worst get singers of all the time would be fucking Frank Sinatra at the risk of pissing off all the Italian Americans, his scat singing at the end of strangers in the night.

Speaker 5:          00:58:10       Doobie Doobie. Do Toby di Di da Di da Da.

Speaker 3:          00:58:18       Yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:58:19       he sounded like Joe Piscopo doing him before Joe even did it. Right. Anyways, let's go back to this shit. So let me tell you what I learned. A little tricky thing. Uh, paying for porn. I know paying for porn feels counterintuitive, but it's worth it. Here's what you do. Find a site that has the kind of content that you're looking for. Make sure that the site allows for downloading and isn't just streaming only. This is key. Download all your favorite videos to an external hard drive. Ah, Jesus Christ. Do it. And then what the FBI kicks open the fucking door and make sure you cancel your membership before you're 30 days is up or else they'll charge you again. Once you've done all that, you'll have a drive full of high quality porn that you can keep forever and you don't even need an internet connection to watch it. Jesus Christ, this guy might have some figured out here between the external hard drive that's 50 to $100 and a one month subscription, 25 to 30 you're looking at about 80 to $100 initial initial setup. Do that. Math doesn't work out. You're looking at 75 to $130 all right. You kind of fucking alligator on both ends of it. Whatever. I suck at math, so no, actually I don't suck at that kind of math. I suck at the kind that, you know, once you have to learn how to build a bridge, you know, once there was shapes and there was these paragraphs, right, you had to memorize.

Speaker 3:          00:59:40       Yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:59:41       I haven't did okay in Algebra. If I wasn't such a jerk off, it could have fucking got the c minus and not have to go to summer school. But that's a whole another fucking thing. Also, I trashed the, for the, uh, my teacher had a speech impediment, so I used to make fun of them. That was stupid. So when I kind of had a 69, he didn't give me the 70, and he fucked my summer. Um, anyways, where am I? You're looking at about $8,000 initial investment, but think of, think of all the time and frustration you'll save by not having to deal with surfing for porn on the road. It's changed the way I travel.

Speaker 3:          01:00:16       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:00:18       Dude, you sound like you just bought the ultimate like neck pillow, pillow, however the fuck you say that word, by the way. I fucking hate those things. Yeah. I hate you fucking walk around the airport and those fucking douchebags have those neck, neck pillows are already around the neck. I always just want to punch him right in the nose because he already was like, they have that neck brace on a fucking lazy. Are you? Do. You can't hold your head up when you're walking around. Sorry. Um, anyways, Bill, thanks for the free hours of entertainment. They've gotten me through countless boring flights and cab rides. Well, dude, so now if I fight, download, my favorite ones were the ones who is, when I find one that I really like, I always forget the name of it and then I can't find it. And then I try to search like these, I try to come up with words that describe what I watched and that never comes up. Like the search engine, all these sites stinks. So maybe that's a reason to do it.

Speaker 3:          01:01:11       Uh,

Speaker 1:          01:01:13       and also if I want people to pay for my fucking DVDs, shouldn't I be paying these porn stars? How would I be in a hypocrite? God, it, I think, I think I've convinced myself through youtube trying to convince me. People, I think it's high time. I'll come. Lars did our fall. Rick didn't speak out about that. Well, I guess it wasn't happening to them back in the day that Jesus, I don't even, what the fuck I'm talking about here. Um, all right. Overrated. Underrated for the week. Everybody guys using the term slut to refer to his male friend. That's overrated. As in what? As in what up slut. Oh, Jesus. Guys say that to each other. That sounds terrible. He said a kid I hadn't talked to in awhile, whom I was supposed to meet up with in New York City dropped this on me, and not only did I tell him I didn't want to hang out. I told him I wanted to connect my knuckles to his teeth in a way that would send them across time square.

Speaker 3:          01:02:17       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:02:18       Oh yeah, it's bad. What ups luck. That doesn't sound that, that sounds like something one white frat guy would say to another white Frat guy, you know, and then do some bastardized version of some my gangster side. Right.

Speaker 4:          01:02:34       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:02:34       I got, I got a, I have an underrated for you, everybody watching reruns of Tj Hooker.

Speaker 4:          01:02:42       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:02:43       Tj Hooker. He's arguably the worst acting.

Speaker 4:          01:02:47       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:02:48       Ever. On any show that ever happened or at the very least I would put it up there. All right. Well, let's say you had the march madness of worst TV shows. All right, that anybody ever acted on TJ hooker without a doubt would be a number one seed in, in one of the regions without, they would be like Duke.

Speaker 4:          01:03:11       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:03:12       It's fucking horrific. First of all was the episode I saw him and the Armenian dude or whatever the fuck his name is, who's pretending to be Italian. Uh, Romano. They get separated and they're on walkie talkies and somebody shooting at Tj Hooker and Romano is going in into these call and Tj Hooker. And I don't know why he's not saying Tj, he just, he's just going hooker and then they'd show fucking TJ hooker with his fucking awful to pay. We're half the show. It doesn't even match his fucking side parts. More gun play, more gun play. And they cut back to Romano again and he's goes hooker and then fucking captain Kirk, any chance she gets to fondle and get cheap fields on Heather Locklear. He does it. He rescued her one time and he was literally like caressing her face just for like fucking the final like 90 seconds of the show was just rubbing the side of her face. And you can tell she's like a young actress and she doesn't know how to say in between. Takes like, Hey, do you want to do me a favor and maybe just have your hand on my shoulder just for a second. Yeah, because it's, I just don't feel like your character and my character. That's how you talk your way out of somebody doing something awareness scene and she doesn't know how to do it.

Speaker 4:          01:04:31       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:04:32       Just imagine them running around and Larry Bird short shorts because they do that also. And Captain Kirk is sucking in his fucking stomach. What happened? Don't, don't, don't, don't listen to this here. Just sit down and watch it. If you can find it on your right and your cable. I'm telling you, unbelievably underrated. Uh, by the way, by the way, my tickets came, my tickets came for fucking Texas a and M uh, Alabama college station. Me, dude, I called it Paul Versey and uh, two of my other buddies outside of the business are going to go to the game and uh, we're taking some fucking a, I'm doing a couple of gigs.

I've never, I never been to either one of those, either one of those states, states, either one of those cities in that state. So I feel like at this point when I perform in those two, I've hit them all right. I've been to Dallas, Houston, Austin, San Antonio, El Paso. The fuck else is there. I went to a game at the cotton bowl. Right. I'm going to go see Texas A and. M. Who else? I gotta see, I gotta see Texas Tech. I got to see the longhorns at some point, but I went to the Red River game, so I saw them. I saw him play Oklahoma.

I got it. It's big. We're in Texas. I get it. Um, yeah. Oh yeah. By the way. You know what? Um, now that I'm done with my, my, my fucking, my glee shoot there. Now I told you what it was, it's called black and white comes out next year. I'm not going to bore you with it because a, it's not going to come out until next year, but when it does, oh golly. Gee, I'm a, I'm a hopefully get out of the director Mike binder who's a, one of my favorite comics when I was growing up. I hope they'll get them on the podcast here. All right, hang on a second. Let me go to my website here.

So hopefully if this goes well, I'm going to start doing that with some other guys I'd like to work with. You know, I'd like to do, I'd like to work with other fucking headline is that I love and I never get to see cause they're always out headline and write.

Speaker 1:          01:07:27       I'd like to do that with a couple others and just do them, you know, and then just do shows in the middle of fucking nowhere. Um, all right, so here we go.
