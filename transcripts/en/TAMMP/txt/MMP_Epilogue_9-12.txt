Speaker 1:          00:02          Hey, what's going on? It's bill burr and a, this isn't the Monday morning podcast. This is the special, the epilogue from last week's Monday morning podcast where yours truly the wonderful host of this show that even say truly yours, truly promise that. Um, I was going to have Nia answer the question, the provocative question. Um, the fuck list. So first of all, let's welcome the lovely Nia to the epilogue. How are you? I'm great. Thanks for having me. Well, I thank you Nia. That was very professional. What was that all about? Why was that so professional at? No, I do. Why you did something when you were away. That was very guilty of, hello bill. How are you person? I am something when I was away, when I was old snack. Okay. Get your promo out. When I was in London shooting the pilot that I wrote, produced and directed for a possible travel show, I didn't, I didn't ran it and I didn't direct it, but I did produce in house debt. I'll take a compliment.

Speaker 1:          01:03          Yeah, it's a travel. I travel show pilot. Okay. Then I did with two friends. It was amazing all about the, uh, what the black experience in different parts of Europe are like racist, starting with London. What if I went over? But if I went to Europe and did the white experience, why don't you, I'll start in Germany. What's stopping you? Yeah. Um, political incorrectness. See vites experience. You don't need your papers. He was so lights. You need no papers. Um, all right, the fuck list. Here's the question. Bill. Uh, I wake up at my girlfriend's house. She leaves for work. I love this guy. He gets right into it. I can't find my socks. They bagged. Um, she says I have, I have some. Just use mine in leaves. All right. Now, first of all, why is this feet the same size of hers?

Speaker 1:          01:59          Who wants success? Stretchy. Look at your socks. Strike where little colorful ankle socks, like girlies socks that most girls do. Most girls do. But I mean, maybe she has for those, those bitches we saw last night in the crossfit thing. Why are they bitches? Just because I've got to get you going here. Oh, we watched that on ESP or awesome. These girls were ripped cry. These girls rate crime cornerbacks with titties. That's what they look like. That girl that won that, that one round we saw it didn't look like that. She looked really sexy show. No, no up top. Up Top. She looked like a roid it up. Who said that girl you watch on a, Oh my God, I ate too much. Helped me. The biggest loser. Oh my God.

Speaker 1:          02:47          I got to find it in my brain. Jillian, she looked like, but then she had regular girly legs and she had a nice little button and she know she had a great figure and she looks amazing. She was doing those muscle ups that's going to make your, your shoulders and shit really bag. But she didn't look right about. Yeah, he's just looking muscular number one. Dennis Rodman wore the wedding dress. That's what she would look like. Um, no, I'm kidding. She was uh, I dunno. Oddly sexy yet frightened. That's only cause you know, she could kick here. Oh absolutely. Anybody could kick my ass. I have the worst hand dyed coordination ever drunk people. That's what I have. I have heart. Yeah, I have that classic cut. I ain't going down. Hit me over the head with a hubcap will keep coming at you. But I swear to God, I took some martial arts classes.

Speaker 1:          03:41          I literally, they were saying what punch was coming and I would still get hit by it. I just can't, I just can't. I know you took martial arts class. I took martial arts class the way somebody comes up and look, I did stand up a couple of times and then considers himself a comedian. I'm, no, I went down, it's a karate for a month and I don't remember anything. No. I went to a Jujitsu class and it was like literally like literally fighting and it was pilot season and I'm sitting there going like, what am I doing down here? All right, I'm fucking, I was already in my mid thirties. I don't give a shit how old you are by the time you're in your mid thirties, somebody can come in with, with a fucking the mailbox and just smash it over your head. You'd done, I just did that for all the psycho competitive guys out there.

Speaker 1:          04:25          Um, all right, the fuck list. Uh, why didn't you just fucking sign me out for no goddamn reason. Fucking thing. You believe the timing of that, right. As I go back to it. So where were we though? Oh, he was, he was a barber. He put under or fucking sometimes I we get, we would get our socks. Smith step, the like gym socks. So it is possible. No, no, no. But the second I want to put them on and went halfway up my foot, I think these are yours with this guy. It's a viable option for him to walk around all day with his fucking lady. All right. Um, I wake up later and I looked, I looked for the sock drawer. Top drawer, right. Dropped or right is what he's saying. And I find this list with about 20 to 30 names on it. Oh.

Speaker 1:          05:13          And this guy brought this up and he goes in, my name is near the bottom. I missed that the first time I read it. So thank you. Good. A good looking out there on Twitter. Um, some of check marks on them. It's Cetera. That's okay. I asked her about it a while and while she was initially up, it's upset. It turns out to be her fuck list. She made it after we got together with some friends drunk one night. She then admitted to being somewhat of a whore. Her words, not mine before we met, but assures me that she hasn't done anything since she met me with anyone else. I do believe her but I totally blew up on her and we haven't been talking for a few days. I also look a bit creepy as to why I went through her drawer. Uh, it Wa it wasn't an envelope.

Speaker 1:          05:59          I need help. I need help on this one was snooping around. No, but this is the thing. You are a creep from snooping until you find something cause then you have the APP. Well we'll maybe see, I knew I should have looked. I just felt something. You could just be a total straight up creep looking just cause you're a creep. But if you find something you can get out of it. So when he goes, I need help on this one. Do I apologize? She already has. Do I just say fuck it and forget about it? What's knee his take on this? Now this is something I want to add in here that I missed the first time he said his name was near the bottom. It doesn't mean that this list is in chronological order. I know, I'm just saying, but it also could be.

Speaker 1:          06:40          It could be or it could not be. Sometimes it's just like in the order in which you just remember. Well then shouldn't she say his name first? If she even remotely gave a fuck. Oh, is she was drunk with her friend. It's not like she's, she's going for accuracy here. What are you fucking Matlock? You have like every defense fence for this person. All right, cool. Let's, let's say you are take, I'm going to shut the fuck up. Isn't that why I'm here? Yeah. Thank you very much. But I'm here to always be an asshole. But um, there's something slightly creepy and mildly psychotic about making fuck list. However, a lot of girls have done them. I've certainly done them. It's just a thing that you do because you've got this voice in the back of your head saying you made them leave with, who was it?

Speaker 1:          07:24          You know? It's just, I've never even done that. I just go on my head. I go a fucking cam. Cathy, Susie, fucking that chick with a Jello shot. Well, girls let to make lists. We like, we like writing things down like to journal and why is that what it is? So it's not really in like a a fucking horror thing. It's just like you're going to the Navajo as she, and she means she was, had went through a slutty face on a Horay flays phase. She should get the terminology right unless she was in fact of what's the difference between a slutty phase in a hoary face is someone who just likes to sleep around and sleep with a lot of different people and have a good time. A whore is someone who is fucking people to get something out of it. That's a horse. That's the difference. Wow. That's what I think. Yeah. I actually, I don't think I can argue with that assumption of who worry about being a slut. There's something funny about being a whore.

Speaker 2:          08:17          Okay.

Speaker 1:          08:18          All right. I just got lost in that one. Yeah, it got deep. Uh, but you know what I think, I think you should let it go. I mean, it wasn't an envelope. Come on, leave it alone. But he saw it and he's, he's right to feel he's right to feel a certain kind of way about it because if I found, wait a mail list or notebook or whatever it is, you have all of your cock in an envelope to me, seems like it's a work in progress. If she scribbled it down on a cocktail Napkin and then threw it away, or even it was crumpled up in her genes, as they say in my, that's Spanish for genes. Genes. That's the way they say it. And I was fucking saying it back to it going geed and they kept saying, I was saying genes wrong and you're a Rosetta stone.

Speaker 1:          09:04          He's the guy. That would be the funniest thing that you've done the cm. You know what? When I'm bilingual, you wake me, I'm going to bilingual, I'm gonna give, I'm gonna become filthy bilingual and you wait till the shit that I'm saying that you don't even fucking understand when we're in the wreck. I look nothing to it. Of course should do with your fuck list. All right. Wait a minute. The fact that the fact that it's in an envelope, right? It's in a fucking envelope. It's just keeping it private and keep out. Yeah, because it was so, this is what I'm really, you're going to call that a document.

Speaker 1:          09:41          Your Dick w nine form the fuck outta here. To me, this girl is, she's not done fucking yet. Okay. This, this is and what's the deal with some of them have checkmarked. Some of them don't. That's either a performance thing. Yes. Look at that face. You can't see the face you just made. That's either a performance thing. That could be a lot of things. That could be, these are the ones that really put it on me up the ass. These will be the ones that I really liked. These are really the ones, the ones I like blue, whatever. Who knows? Did she not have a, um, a guide at the bottom? Did he check for that while he was snooping around? They look for the fucking, you know, bibliography to go back to cross reference with those check marks mean stay out of the drawer and the private notes.

Speaker 1:          10:26          Creepo wait a minute. No, he went on the drawer to get socks. I get it. Can I just say something though? What? Uh, I don't know that if a woman, it really has the right to tell a guy not to snoop. Why is that? Because of your guys' history. But then again, wait a minute. Wait, am I three of what? I'm just snooping you guys all do it. All right. But then, but, but that kills my argument because that would be like a, then I should have no right to give you shit for fucking around because guys do it too. So that, that, that argument's stuck. All right. So I think so what, so what do you think is, what should this guy do? Should he apologize? Should what is, should he apologize and let it go? Move on. How exactly she apologized. Said, listen, I'm sorry.

Speaker 1:          11:09          I went to get a pair of your Chris Everett shock and I found your fuck list and then I got upset about it. Yeah, I'm sorry. And like blew up at you about it cause she up. By the way, why isn't my name is that guy brilliantly mentioned. Why isn't my name at the bottom of the or the top of the list? It's not chronologically. You're just throwing down names. Maybe. Maybe she started off being like, okay, who was the first guy? And then she went down the list and then she got things got thrown in there. It doesn't matter. It doesn't matter. She's with him now. So stop focusing on the you. Can I ask you a question? Isn't it weird that she just has this like a fucking serial killer as like this trophy? That's why. That's why I said it's weird and mildly psychotic that she has a fucking list.

Speaker 1:          11:53          We, but a lot of girls do it. I have done it. It's one of those things that you do. So you're sharing, you're weird and mildly psychotic. You speaking out of both sides of your mouth here. I'm not, I'm not. You don't think it's weird and mildly psychotic to do that? Yes. I admit, but then you're saying put up a lot of women do it with a lot of people do something. It doesn't, it doesn't it become mainstream and not be be psychotic? I guess so. I mean maybe it's more normal than you think, but it's, it's a little weird to, I mean, unless you're trying to trace back like an STD or something like that then, but people do it all the time. That's another reason for possibly the check thing. I wasn't itching with him.

Speaker 1:          12:31          No. He should just be like, listen, I'm sorry I freaked out. Let's just move on. You know what I mean? Like if there's a bigger issue, what should she said? She's already apologized to him. He said, what would you, what do you think? I'm sorry. I think she said fuck list. Yeah, I was drunk with my girlfriend. We made a little list and I'm, I'm, I'm sorry. I, she admitted that would make somebody feel uncomfortable if she found it. She would feel fucked up about it. I would feel fucked up, but I wouldn't want my girl being out there with all her friends.

Speaker 3:          12:59          Man, I fucked this guy. I sucked his dick.

Speaker 1:          13:03          So guys and girls they sleep with and then I come walking. Yeah, but it's different. Why? Why? I'll tell you why. Why didn't you just say it like that? Why? I'll tell you why. First of all, physically we're doing the fucking, Oh God, this fucking argument. Yeah. Yeah. And secondly, a guy has a right to brag about getting laid because for us it's a fucking skill. You can go out any night of the week and walk into a bar and be like, hey, who fucking wants it? Yes. That's exactly what we can do. You could get a fucking, you could get a three on one on a God damn fucking pool table if you want it to a guy. I don't give a fuck what he looks like unless he's a fucking movie star and they're just throwing themselves at him and then even then they're going to try to get fucking knocked up.

Speaker 1:          13:53          Take the old Turkey based or to the use condom and then fucking, you know that move the NBA move. Huh? I don't know that. You don't know that move. You don't have that on your fucking lawyer. I know. The reason, the reason why a woman is a whore, it's this. I still a bit about it. It's like a fat guy eating an ice cream in public where he's like, oh cool, I'll go to, if you do it, nobody cares when I do so Google wouldn't fit. Fuck, because it's gluttonous. It's gluttonous. Your guys' pursuit of sex takes absolutely no skill whatsoever other than other than four, and I'll say it again. The only thing you have to worry about is which one's the rapist. Once you, once you get, once you get past that, it's just a field, the dicks. Maybe that's why you have guys make lists.

Speaker 3:          14:49          Whoa, whoa. Dang.

Speaker 1:          14:54          You're an idiot. Idiot. That was, listen, a lot of my show, very ignorant. A lot of my shit is deliberately ignorant, but there's a nice point in there somewhere, which is what? Like a little little rose booboo. Um, we know where my point is. My point is the reason why we don't fucking respect the fact that you guys go out and do it is because it takes no skill. Because guys will fuck anything that moves basically. Okay. You want even, but even the fact that we will fuck everything. Anything that moves, we still got to fucking do a little tap dance before. Yeah, look at you. [inaudible] I'm old enough to realize when you get that look on your face, even if I'm making a great point, you don't want to fucking hear you already have your mind made up. You know what it is. You don't have a comeback to this other than to sit there with your stupid eyebrows doing whatever they're doing right now.

Speaker 1:          15:43          It is true. You know, you don't, you remember that time when I was trying to explain to you, this is a great story. I'm going to tell them and tell the podcast people this because I'm so sick of looking at your funny story. One time were in a bar, right? And we were talking about whatever, what it was like to be a guy and all that shit. And I was sitting there telling her, you know, to, to get laid, you know you got to have fucking, oh you said, you know guys. Oh my God. They used to just say the dumbest things to me. That's what you said. I said rarely. I go, let's flip the tables. Let's pretend I'm in control and you were over there. Oh boy. Come make them to hit on me and you want to talk about bombing. So she sitting there just with her fucking nonexistent game.

Speaker 1:          16:27          Like, Hey, I theory gencon had drinking your glass there and I love games and I was being a total fucking jerk to you. And at one point you go, you just be, you just making this difficult on purpose. And what did I say? I said, welcome to my world. I say, and the whole bar ware Uno, uno, you start high fiving the birds. That's what should have happened. If I was miked up that what happened? Oh Shit. Z now you're doing is mopping the great point that I made because you know your rock dog, you fucking plot throw it. It's difficult, isn't it? When I was being a fucking jerk, thinking, isn't that the craziest feeling? Like what the fuck do I say? How do I get into this? That's what guys have to learn how to do. You guys don't have to do that.

Speaker 1:          17:13          All you have to do is come there to know how to flirt. I get what? Come there with half your titties, hanging out and sit there like the hats is fucking slowly putting a straw in your mouth. No suggest things. A whole like seductive technique. You know? It's like being charming and funny and sexy. Putting your hand on his forearm for just a second and then taking it away. And this isn't some like fucking cosmo list of how to get a guy interested in you. I'm just saying that wasn't a cosmo loose. That was, that was, that is something that I learned. That's something, that's something I learned. What putting your this girl one time when we finally fucking hooked up, you know, I as always, I was stunned that it happened and then she was like, fucking a, what did she say? How did you not know? I liked, you know, it's like we can have a fucking say. Then she goes, I put my hand on, she goes, I put my hand on your arm. And like that to her was a sign of, yeah, I want to have sex with you. Well know that that's true, but she liked me that she was interested in. Okay. Like the physical contact thing. Okay. I guess so you seem pretty confident when you were hitting on me. US because I had been bombing for years.

Speaker 4:          18:22          Okay.

Speaker 1:          18:23          No, I got, yeah, you get to, you get to the point. We don't give a shit. If I had to do it now, ah, forget it. It'd be like taking five years or six years off of fucking standup. Yeah. I mean, I feel like my flirtation dimension, I'm old and balding like that. That doesn't help either, but I am making some money. I am making some money so that that trumps a lot of shit. That's like me wearing a little hoary dress. If you come fucking walking in with

Speaker 4:          18:46          money, what do you mean at, first of all, I'm making money now. It's not like you're walking around dripping in diamonds and Rolex watches and stuff and driving. You know a Porsche where you read, I have money. You're walking in there and I go out of 50 Boston's sports related. CSUS, I you have. Okay. When your socks pulled up and your old man shorty like, like you look like the fucking little league. Okay. You're not exactly the screaming sexy money guy. Okay, so this whole idea, oh, I make money now. So now the pitches, the bitches be loving name. No one knows you having money. Okay, seriously.

Speaker 1:          19:31          Well maybe that's my little whore repelling. There you go. Dress

Speaker 4:          19:34          little league coach.

Speaker 1:          19:38          If you have money and you want to keep it, that's what you do. And then every once in a while you go out and I, I wouldn't even know what to wear. I would watch an old r Kelly video. Am I supposed to have like not have it, have a tie on, but have some sort of chain with my face on it? Is that what it's supposed to do? I don't know. One of these days, needy. I'm going to, I'm going to go down to fucking Hollywood boulevard or sunset. We're all those whores or walking around

Speaker 4:          20:01          wrestling. You keep threatening. You're going to go down. You're going to go down to the w hotel. That's what it is. You're going to go down Martha, the Debbie

Speaker 1:          20:09          and have it all these young girls asked me where the bathroom is.

Speaker 4:          20:12          Right.

Speaker 1:          20:15          I don't work here. I'm actually here to intermingle with the opposite sex. No, listen to. I act my fucking age. All right. I'm not, even if you were to fucking dumped me, there's no, I wouldn't go down to the fucking w. What would you do? I'd go none of the wine bar where all that dusty divorce pussies. I just, except my lot in life.

Speaker 4:          20:38          Oh, can we talk about how there's no woman a cougar? And I said it's, they're not cougars if they're the same age as you. Oh

Speaker 1:          20:47          No, she, she wasn't hitting on me. What do you mean who was she was a nun when she hitting on somebody young. Who are we talking about?

Speaker 4:          20:55          You said to me, Oh, we were out the other night and the is the cougars came up and talked to us and I said, oh, girls and all they were up. I said, they're not cougars. If they say, do you realize a female cougars are your age? The ones they call cougars are your, I don't judge them by their rate. So for you to say Cougar is Mason, no science. Those are your peers.

Speaker 1:          21:15          I don't judge them by their age. So then why'd you call him cougars? Cougars allowed age. The lack of elasticity. Fucking they're dead. Titties were like when they pull their pants up, like the titties were behind their belt. Okay. They will fall. They were a mess. You, you know, I'm like, one of them was actually cool and the uh, she was cool. She was actually like hot for her age and still fucking working out. But she was like beyond the expiration dates, you've actually said, hey, you look good. She goes, thank you. Thank you for noticing the fucking attitude you would like him to have 25 years earlier. Right. So she was cool. The other one was a mess. I told you she kicked me in the fucking leg. No. Yeah, like three times. Right in the Shin. Cause I made fun of her because she was just an obnoxious that Kay, we're thing over here.

Speaker 1:          22:06          I was hanging down. I'm not gonna mention the person's name, but I've ran into a comedian and we were sitting down and they came walking by man. So comedians, you know, we fucking made fun of. Next thing you know, they're sitting down and it was, it was horrific. The second they sat down. So the one was cool, the other one was an asshole. What did I say to her? I didn't comment on our age that did something. And she had these big, those big stupid fucking platform horse shoes on that they're all wearing now. Right. And she fucking kicked me with his like hit him with a block of wood and for some reason it didn't hurt. She hit me like three fucking times and I just kept laughing at her and then security came over. The whole thing took like 90 seconds. She had that, that's not a cigarette and ges for fucking India.

Speaker 1:          22:52          It is, it is what it is. Come on. She came up, she was in that window. Nini, she came up, it was just herpes. That's when she came up. I think if she, if she had like a CB that would be her handle. Um, oh, one of the last thing I want to, I want to ask you just to get you going again. Yesterday we went to, we got some barbecue. Yes. Um, and we would drive it back and there was the name of this store called peekaboo. Peekaboo. I want to do with that store is, and I go, it's probably kids clothes and then you're like, yeah it is kid clothes. And then I said, what if it was closed for those people who are full grown adults but want to act like babies before you go off on them? There's this group of people, Opie and Anthony exposed me to this. Uh, they would show him that where they fucking a, it's, they were adults and they don't want to grow up and their mothers like 60 or 70 and they're like 35 in a playpen wearing a diaper guy.

Speaker 4:          23:54          I go, I can't, oh my God, stop. Stop. I can't, I can't deal with that. What's wrong with that? I refused to ever be okay with that lifestyle and I'm a very tolerant person if it was your son, but I no, no, no, no. It's not going to be my son. What if I find that whole thing? So repellent, pretend I'm your and you're wearing a diaper and you want me to breastfeed you and rocky back and forth and have you put or whatever. Mark, breastfeed and all that shit. No, get up. Get a fucking job. You'll Weirdo. So grows and no, I refuse. I refuse to be okay with the adult baby. Trend, but if he had a job,

Speaker 1:          24:37          he had a job, but he, that's when, that's just how he rolled when he was in the house, like he chilled and he just wanted to come out of the couch and lay in your lap and have you like tickle his tummy? No, I mean, as he played with the mobile,

Speaker 4:          24:50          fine, people can do whatever they want in their free time and if they're not imposing it on other people, I guess that's their right. I mean, I know what to do that. How many guys when you accept somebody, but I don't accept it. I don't, I mean, I have to say though, people should do whatever they want to do, but I just find it's so creepy and just wrong to be crawling around and cab. Whoa, Whoa, whoa. What would you do? Fucking weird.

Speaker 1:          25:15          What would you do? Your son, he, you know, he, he took shop class, he thought was going to be a carpenter, but the only reason why I did it was so he could build himself a giant crick and then he was in there one day, came home. It's like Eddie standing there standing up in the crib wearing a diaper and a shirt that doesn't quite meet his diaper. Oh, with his hands on either side of the rails going

Speaker 4:          25:33          no. Am Abby had, oh, I wouldn't be okay with that. Be like with a beard, right. Is there, there's, there is a problem and we need to get you help because why? Why is this your escape like by acting like a baby? I don't know. Nope. Nope. Nope, nope. Nope. Not into it. Don't like it. Don't want to see it.

Speaker 1:          25:55          What if, what if he went to, I got help and everything was totally fine but the only side effect was he still wore, he wore an adult feety pajamas onesy and it was baby

Speaker 4:          26:06          blue. I can live with that. I suppose what I just, you know the sound that a, once he makes on hardwood floors, adults acting like babies is weird to me. It's just like, I don't like girls who like to be like these little girl princess is all the time where they're like obsessed with a hello kitty and they want to like be a princess and like ponies and cupcakes and this like that, that you know, making yourself a child like a,

Speaker 1:          26:30          yeah, most of them are according to the doctor drew show, they got molested and then you just sort of stopped there. Like whatever age they're acting like they're at something chromatic happened to them. Oh, well I know the age old. Don't know about that. I just mean like,

Speaker 4:          26:44          no, that was actually what was actually when I did his show up. Girls would call and be like, Lna Raping Jackie, Jackie, me. Like, like what happened to me yesterday? Okay, we're almost up to a half hour. This was only supposed to be like 10 minutes. Okay, well really quickly doing an entirely different pocket, but really quickly, remember I said yesterday I went into that store and, and that you don't shut up the, I saw that little white fluffy dog, one of those little tiny white curly fluffy dogs running around. I was like, oh, how cute. And the girl in the shop goes, that's waffles. And I went, oh, waffles. Okay cute. And she call icon that cause he looks like a waffle and I she stress out waffle like that. Yeah. While Paul and I looked at the dog and I looked at her and I said, is that what a waffle looks like to you?

Speaker 4:          27:30          And she goes, well now I just be like, he reminds me of a waffle. Like he really more looks like a sheep or a lamb, but I call them muffles and I just walked away because I can't deal with that because I just feel like you're trying to be like this cute little nonsensical girl. And it's like, why do you feel the need to like dumb yourself down like that? It's like girls need to be held to a higher standard than that and not try to like cute their way into things or change their voice when they're asking for tea. Yeah. Ernie, sorry, can I make it, I'm so sorry. Can I like it? Like an ice tea thing is like don't do that. Don't feel like you have to be a baby to get what you want, or that's what I say. Put Your titties away. Not Standing yet. It's just being a fully formed adults being an adult. Okay. We're going to end right now. Can you just please do, do her saying waffles again? Wow. Fucking horrific. All right. There you go. There's the answer to your question and thanks for the guy on our Twitter.
