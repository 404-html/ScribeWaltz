You know what sucks about the fucking NFL? I never thought I would say this. This fucking parody think I swear to God, every, any team can beat any team. See it die like a thousand deaths every Sunday. Remember back in the day, you know, if your team was good, you had those teams. You could just kick the shit out of four of them a year. It just seems every week. Now you're in a fucking dog fight.

Speaker 2:          00:01:15       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:01:16       You know. Did you guys ever see the original one? I swear to God. Is it me or is it fucking nine hours long? It takes them like three hours before they even get to Nipsey Russell.

Speaker 1:          00:01:26       come on in. Ease on down. Why don't you fucking run down the road? I'm sorry. That's such a bad joke when it's too fucking long. Um, who the fuck pitch to Redo that thing? I don't even get and why do you put it out now? That's not a holiday movie.

Speaker 2:          00:01:43       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:01:43       Why don't they just keep them like the old, what's do you know? I'm taping Rudolph the red nose. Rob Babo Rudolph the red nose reindeer. That classic one from um,

Speaker 1:          00:01:57       well it would have back in the fucking day. I'm going to watch it, you know, Tuesday night it comes on. Get myself into the fucking holiday spirit. I can't have the TV on do a podcast cause I'm just keep talking about you guys want to watch TV with me. I just saw this new ray Liotta um, Jennifer Lopez movie or TV show. I don't know what it was. It was just coming out, I thought was gonna be one of those commercials were Ray Liotta just stares at somebody because they're not drinking vodka. I just want the other person to be like frank. No, I make the, I'm sorry. I love fucking Goodfellas, but this is my drink.

Speaker 2:          00:02:32       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:02:32       What's going on with you man? What's, what's with the fucking looks relaxed. I get it. You can kick the shit out of me.

Speaker 2:          00:02:39       You know,

Speaker 1:          00:02:41       he's just laughing at their fucking manhood. He's disgusted with him. He's just dusted. It's actually an amazing piece of acting because he never says anything. He just fucking looks at him and he's just see, just see the generational gap. He can just see him going. Your entire generation is a bunch of fucking pussies.

Speaker 2:          00:03:02       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:03:03       Just with one fuck. He just gives him that one. Fuck it, look, and next thing you know, of course they got the guy sitting over there with like an umbrella drink. I don't think I've ever sat in a bar in anybody's ever fucking looked at me cause what I was drinking, I guess I've gotten shit for it.

Speaker 2:          00:03:16       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:03:16       You know, but that was just back when I lived in the Boston area. They'll come on, you fucking do was shot. Um, God driving into, we're all driving, only arrest, making fucking excuses. Um, anyway, so you know, and that, that fucking horrific Sunday night football song comes on, you know the little cutie pie there in her glitter outfit cause she's in show Biz. Right. So you got to have some glitter on. It's all this special effects shit. Um, I don't know if it's me or what is, isn't that song just a complete fucking rip off of Joan jets? I hate myself for loving you.

Speaker 2:          00:03:56       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:03:57       When they get to the whole fucking, you know, I, I love my for watching football, isn't it? How it goes. I think I know what they say. I always fast forward through it. I've never liked that song. I liked it back when it was an orchestra. You know when you had somebody like John Williams, you had some great composer come up with a piece of music that I could actually move you emotionally. And then somewhere along the line they went to Hank Williams jr and he took his hit song. All my rowdy friends are coming over tonight, you know, don't blame Hank Williams jr it's not his fault. Okay? His Dad obviously banged somebody who had no musical talent whatsoever. And so the best Hank Williams jr could ever be is half Hank Williams Sr. But you know, sometimes you get a little more, you know, you get a little more one than the other. So rather than him singing and what the fuck did Hank Williams sick? You cheat and heart my loan. Some truck. I don't know what the fuck he saying, but all I know is that guy like drank himself to death, but he was only like, wow, I got to look this up. How fucking old was that guy? That guy looks like he's fucking 60

Speaker 2:          00:05:17       yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:05:17       he drank himself to death. [inaudible] I gotta look this up. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. You know, this is the kind of, this is what happens. This is what happens when you fucker just run your God damn mouth. Hank Williams, Hank Williams, Hank that he was, he was the original frank the tank, but he was Hank 1923 to 1953 he was fucking 30 years old.

Speaker 2:          00:05:40       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:05:40       You know, he, that's a, you know, as, as sad as that. Is that as a hell of an accomplishment to drink yourself to death by 30 I mean anybody can, Oh d am I that, you know, but I mean to literally to put it in the fucking hours that the amount of hours that it to drink yourself to death and only 30 years. I mean, you've got to figure the guy didn't have his first shot of booze.

Speaker 2:          00:06:04       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:06:05       I'll even give out. Get say 13 he had his first fucking drink. A Bose.

Speaker 2:          00:06:11       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:06:11       And within 17 years guys fucking dead.

Speaker 2:          00:06:16       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:06:17       That's amazing. I remember a long time ago watching some fucking show or something that was saying the body was actually designed to live 150 years, optimal conditions, you know, basically if they treated you like a fucking classic car that had been at a body off restoration and they just sort of floated you around and never drove you or anything like that. Right. Like you could live, you know, breathing perfect air, eating perfectly and all that. You'd live for 150 years. Um, which that made sense to me because every time when those people used to come and give the cancer talks about cigarettes, it'd be like every time you smoke a cigarette you take five minutes off of your life, there's 20 cigarettes in a pack. So that's a lie. That's a hundred minutes. So you just took almost two hours of your life away. So I was sitting there, you know, doing my dumb Masco. Well, Jesus Christ, you'd be fucking dead by the time you 30 cause I was counting down from like 80 I guess their count down for one 50 or maybe they just lying and they're trying to scare the shit out of you and they don't think some freckled cutting. The crowd's going to try to actually do some math. I don't know. All I'm saying.

Speaker 2:          00:07:24       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:07:24       As you got to give it up to Hank Williams, you know,

Speaker 2:          00:07:28       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:07:28       Drinking himself to death, you know. Ah, you know the first third, the first third is cirrhosis is fucking fun. After a while it's not fun anymore, but you know, a lot of things aren't fun after awhile, you know?

Speaker 2:          00:07:41       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:07:41       Being a parent isn't fun. After a while you see it on their faces. Once they get to ask the little bundle of joy once he's done say acute cute things, once they'd done being cute, you know, like they step on an ant and they say, hey wait, what? Go Guy dead it identical. Yeah,

Speaker 3:          00:07:58       go. Did you say I taste, she just said I did it. Killed it. Oh, that's adorable.

Speaker 1:          00:08:05       All right. The little things kids say once they get past that and they start rolling their fucking eyes. Yeah. You know, you're just like, yeah, I'm fucking over this shit.

Speaker 1:          00:08:16       That's right. Parenting is like cirrhosis of the liver. Look at Bob Costas with this fucking smart looking coat and his goddamn scarf guy always look sharp. You gotta give it up to them. Um, my, I'm the only person who wins too when they talked about what was wrong with Peyton Manning's foot plantar Fisher writers, which I've actually had, um, from improper technique playing drums. I didn't know how to get, I was trying to do those John bottom triplet fucking things from good times, bad times. And I think I was just using my big toe to try and make it happen. So it was arching my foot. I don't know what the fuck happened. I woke up the next day. I thought someone was stabbing in the foot, but, uh, Peyton actually it's basically this, I don't even know what it is. I had it. I don't even know what the fuck it is.

Speaker 1:          00:09:04       I thought it was a tendon that runs along the Archie of thought. I Dunno where to after I saw the drawing then I didn't know what the fuck it was. But it goes from your heel to like, uh, like when you get your Bunyan there, you know if you get hammertoes stop hammertoes dual due to too. If you get a hammer toes, right. That part that sticks out. Anyways, the part near the heel they say is tearing away from the bone. What the fuck I'm done. I am fucking done. At that point I might, well part of my body is tearing away from the bone. I just stopped doing standup. If my fucking arm from leaning on the mic stead is something in my elbow started Terry, that I would just be a podcast and that would be it. My voice would crack and I would cry.

Speaker 1:          00:09:51       So that looks like we're going to be losing Peyton manning and Coby Bryan in the same fucking year. Two monsters of their game. Do you guys see kobies poem? My wife read it to me. I actually, even as a Celtics fan, I was a little sad. Then I also, I had to chuckle that he wrote this whole poem, this whole Ode to basketball and, and not once did he ever mentioned coaches or teammates and I was kinda thinking like, you know what ads? That's why he never passed the ball dead. He, he's still one of the greats, but Jesus Christ. How about a shout out to fucking shack? At least his ass, you know, remember that. How does my ass taste? I'm sorry. Well let, let's, let's get, let's get back. Let's get back on track here. What was I talking about? I was talking about Plantar Fisher. Itis is, I would know, I was talking about how, um, the, the hook of that Thursday night fucking song, the Sunday night football song, they got to get you into it, right?

Speaker 1:          00:10:48       Cause you're not into you cause you're not into football evidently. So they've got to have some lay come out in a little sparkly dress, throw a couple of looks to the camera. Like, you know what? I blow you fewer here. I'd fucking blow. Yeah. She's got to give you those looks Thursday night football is his mouth tits, right? They do. That can break free of the things that you do. It's the same fucking sock and full life of me. You know, I think Joan Jett or is she had to go after the fucking NFL. Why not? They went after Tom Brady. Why can't they go after fucking Joan jet? Do you know? I got an a big argument with this fucking friend of mine right through right now. I think he said can't talk, but he just was, you know, he was being, he was being at what?

Speaker 1:          00:11:33       I've never run into a whiny giant fan. New York giant fan. I love giant fans. They never bitched. They never whine. They just fucking beat my team. I got to respect that. He was fucking, he was still whining about the giants losing to the Patriots two weeks ago. It's like, dude, you went to and Oh and the fucking super bowl against this. Why don't give a fuck about a game in November? You know who won? They could wield, she wouldn't look good. Cause when you go to go to [inaudible] they wouldn't cared. But he caught it. Yeah, I agree with you. Okay. I thought Dez Bryant caught that fucking ball. I don't understand what you got to fucking do these days for them to call it a catch. It's a weird fucking rule. Okay. So he started going in on how the Patriots cheat and I'll let fucking whiny horse shit. And he tried to say that the Patriots win. This is the best one I've heard so far. The Patriots where 90% of coin tosses,

Speaker 1:          00:12:24       which I think that's the number I always pull out of my ass when I want to win an argument. That's the percentage I always go with 90%. Okay. If 90% of people out there with rarely fucking blue, blue, blue, right. So he tried to tell me that 90% of the fucking time we, when the coin toss it's like, okay, so what are we doing there? Yeah. Are we somehow sneaking a fucking different quarter in there? Like, it's, it's just unfucking. And he continued on with the whole, the Patriots watched the rams final fucking a walkthrough before the super bowl, even though the ESPN detracted it and said that was a complete horse shit lie. Of course they'd attracted at 1230 in the morning. You know, they talked about it for five years at nine o'clock in the morning on sports center. And then when they find out that they were perpetuating a lie, they then know, oh, sorry about that.

Speaker 1:          00:13:12       It fucking 1230. So, um, I dunno, I finally got him to come around. I finally got him to come around. It's just like, look, okay, if you want to see the guilty of gamesmanship, absolutely do they fucking, you know, try to get away with shit if they could get away with it. Yeah, but so does everybody. They just don't fucking, when all the Superbowls, you know, it's unfucking believable what other teams have done and there's like no fucking problem. Like, I'll tell you right now that fucking, do you guys see that, that Redskins play where, uh, Kirk cousins, they hike the ball and the ball flew out of his fucking hands and he asks the Ref way, did you get this ball? Cause he thought there was something slick on it and they go, you got it from your own sideline. If that happened during a patriots game and the other quarterback said that we would have lost a draft pick somehow they would have fucking put his you.

Speaker 1:          00:14:05       Is it possible that maybe date day Greece the fucking bled. Somebody sneak over, dress like a red skin and grease stop the balls. Um, you know what I mean? I don't, I, I've gone through this a Zillion fucking times, but uh, you know, I, I don't know. It's unbelievable that, that piece of shit, Jim or say and that piece of Shit fucking, uh, I can't remember his name, man. Eric Mann. Jeanie have affectively tarred and feathered. They, the Patriots that will, that will be brought up for them for the rest of fucking time. Air Pressure in stealing signs is what they're fucking guilty of, right. That's it. These are the teams have to fucking deep edge tested positive for steroids. They're building stadiums that make their fucking fan base sound loud is fucking hilarious. Oh, that's the pumping fucking crowd noise. It added five, five. Don't worry about it. Don't worry about it. Jesus fucking Christ. We still signs for one fucking game. One game. It was illegal. Then they did it every game.

Speaker 2:          00:15:19       Okay,

Speaker 1:          00:15:20       unreal. I'll have to have that debate for the rest of the time. It was only illegal for that one game that we did it and got caught. If we did it the year before, the year before, it wasn't fucking illegal. Then I'll use stupid cuts out there. Who think all you have to do is just film the other coach and then you know what they're going to do. You dumb fuck. She got a, you'd have to take that and line it up with their plays. Watch it at halftime and then try to memorize as much as you can. If you're lucky, maybe on two plays, you know what the fuck they're doing.

Speaker 2:          00:15:48       You know what I mean?

Speaker 1:          00:15:50       I mean, the teams sit there and they watch game film every fucking week looking at their formations and all of that shit. How was that legal? He couldn't do that back in the fucking thirties right? He fucking just sitting there. I guess you could. If you get what camera? Some guy in those fucking jockey parents and just sit there role in the film. How was watching game film legal? That's gear considered. Then you're a good student, but if you try to steal their signs, then you're a cunt. I don't, I don't get it. I don't get it, but I'm never going to defend that. The Patriots don't try to fucking bend the rules in their favor, but I won't go so far as to say that everybody else in the league doesn't also fucking do it. This whole fucking horse, you know what they sound like? They sound like Republicans when they talk about America, when they go, America was founded on, everybody's got a shut and they completely ignored genocide and slavery. Right. That's what other football fence sound like to me when they, when they try to act like we're the only ones who fucking Dick around with the rules.

Speaker 1:          00:16:59       Oh Jesus Christ. He just landed on Brady, the Brady rule in effect, personal foul hit, and Tom Brady, I love that man. He's got a cute little bud, 15 yards first down. I love it. I love it. I love it. It's called the Brady rule. You know, even still, it's the money rule. They call it the Brady rule. That actually suggests that the NFL on some fucking level gives a fuck about a Tom Brady. If they don't, they give a fuck about the money he makes. You know what I mean? It's like fucking Lance Armstrong. All right. After all the bullshit after he gets fucking cod there, everybody gets on their high horse. That's disgusting. That's not what the Tour de France is about and all that fucking shit. Let me ask you this. All those constant made, all of that fucking when he met, when he wants seven in a row and people who didn't give a fuck about bike racing, tuned in and watched, and they could charge more money for advertising.

Speaker 1:          00:17:58       Okay. During that whole time, did they give the money back? All the fucking money they made all those owners that made all that money off all those fucking guys doing steroids, you know, hitting a ball over the fucking God damn freeway made all that money. Oh, we're going to clean up the game. Oh yeah, you're going to give away all that dirty money. You made you fucking cons. Like you didn't know they were doing roids that shitty. If you manage to an Applebee's in, in half of your staff was on steroids when you wouldn't, you wouldn't fucking notice at some point when you walk in, when you go in and to go get a fresh sack of fucking potatoes, you wouldn't walk in on somebody inject and somebody else in the fucking buttocks. Just out of just being there every fucking day. You know what's going on. I ever tell you that time when I used to work at that fucking is holding all fucking day and they let it got Brady Dank doesn't end itself. Love fell you motherfucker.

Speaker 4:          00:18:54       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:18:55       We got away with holding on that one.

Speaker 1:          00:18:58       Jesus Christ. Anyways, I used to work in this fucking, um, I used to work in this restaurant. It was called the sable cafe and Cary North Carolina back in like 87, 88. Uh, why did I just say that now I'm going to say all this fucking horrific shit about it was a fun job. And uh, there was some activities that were going on in the back room who gives a fuck? It was almost 30 years ago anyway, so I worked in this fucking place and um, I used to work on a mesquite grill and I had this big chef hat, like I knew what the fuck I was doing and the place was gradually going out of business. One of the managers had a major cocaine program, but a lot of people did. It was the 80s. It wasn't really, it was just becoming a problem, you know? That's right around was cocaine, the big lie, you know what I mean? So this guy used to steal from the registry, do a little fucking toot. Right. And you know, you know if the fucking the guy, if that guy fucking running shit

Speaker 4:          00:19:55       yeah

Speaker 1:          00:19:56       is on drugs and I mean it just trickles statement guys sent in the example. So you know, I remember I used to work like the fucking dinner shift one night and it's just fancy fucking restaurant and buy fancy. I mean this carpeting, this cloth napkins and they had a giant fish tank. All right. That was fancy for fucking Cary, North Carolina, you know, and it was fucking asshole. So he's giving me shit for being a Yankee, you know, affect carry back then stood for concentrated area of relocated Yankees. That's what these say like, you know, you don't, you don't care. Stands for, you know what that stands for. I know buddy. What does it stand for? Concentrated area. Relocated. Yank. I fucking hate the draw. Play. Yukon's has the draw play ever will. It's never fucking worked.

Speaker 1:          00:20:43       The draw play, eh. Okay. May, it must've worked at some point. Keep running the fucking thing. I think that's what you've just decided that you're going to punt. It'd be like, all right, you know what? Let's just not give the ball over right here. Let's just, uh, you know, just wait a second. It never, it never fucking works. It's weird how the draw play doesn't work, but somebody fucking basically doing the same thing. But if they go out for a pass, it always works or it works more times than not. You know what I mean? Like, so did the, did the uh, delayed screened

Speaker 2:          00:21:16       right

Speaker 1:          00:21:18       when you got the line gap rackers coming up the gap. Ah, Jesus Christ. What are we doing? Yeah. Fucking crazy. Anyways, I gotta be honest with you, with all the interest we got, I think if we replay Carolina Panthers right now, um, the only reason we, if we would win would be we would just out coach him out of fucking experience. But I think Carolina, it looks like they look like world beaters to me.

Speaker 2:          00:21:42       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:21:44       I Dunno. How fucked up is it that the red skins are fucking five and six and they're in first place. You know what I mean? Like I think seven and nine could win that division.

Speaker 2:          00:21:55       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:21:55       You know, I'll tell you what's going to be brutal is watching the New York media drive, Tom Kauflan out of town. That's going to be fucking unreal. Like he doesn't, not a coach. You know, it's not his problem that one of his best defensive players maimed himself. You know what I mean? That whole fucking thing he had to deal with. I mean, I don't know. I don't, I mean, the fucking guy's a winner, man. He, he came to BC immediately, turned it around after the, the, the, the Doug Flutie hangover. All of a sudden we became, we were winners again. I have to pick now left. He went to Jacksonville. He always got the Jacksonville Jaguars to the fucking super bowl. He fucking goes to the Goddamn New York giants. They went to super bowls beating the undefeated patriots. 18 and off

Speaker 1:          00:22:42       guy has one fucking bed. I guarantee it. They're going to fucking stay. Going to send them out of town is, you know, one of my buddies thinks this because of his wind burned face. I've never seen a guy who needs fucking lotion more in my life. Like I think that that's his next move before he, if he gets run out of town, you know, and he just needs a break from football. They should do that thing, you know, like if you go and bald and they just go, Eh, not only the fucking Douche bag and the commercial, I'm also a client. Right. He should do that with like fucking, uh,

He just seemed like they were feeling each other out to see what they were going to do and, and just that, the whole fucking thing, every fucking line, every deep defensive unit that goal tenders, all of that shit. It just, it was incredible the way that they play. Do you know that was, there was only two penalties. The whole, it was two penalties in the first period. That was it. Um, Chicago went up to nothing and then the king score two and the third and then came back and won in overtime by the way, three on three. Even if you fucking hate hockey, there's, there's nothing to hate about three on three hockey and overtime. It's fucking unbelievable. Just end to end action every five seconds. It seemed like he was seeing a two on one or a breakaway and um, ah, the lovely Nia.

And it's like a real subway now. Like there's all kinds of fucking vandalism on it and shit. I remember when, you know, when I first moved out here in 2007, you went down there. It was just like,

Speaker 4:          00:43:57       okay,

Speaker 1:          00:43:58       you went down that subway. It's like, wow, this is what

Speaker 1:          00:44:02       The world would look like if there was a like a massive plague. Yeah, yeah. Let them turn the corner and get a first down and a touchdown. There you go. Great defense guys. Where to go? Yeah. Fucking Christ second. Um, anyways, I was thinking like, this is must be what the world's going to be like after a giant play gets right. And then we start all over again and we still know how to do shit right. We still have some reason the scientists fucking survive. Oh fuck. Some other scientists survived. That would be the ultimate thing if the scientist survives. So you like, you had the same amount of people on the planet that, um, that existed, you know, when we were just running around in caves and shit.

Speaker 2:          00:44:45       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:45:11       Oh yeah, they'll a little always. I'm just thinking, you know, get a little less attention. Just one year. I would love to be treated like the Indianapolis Colts. You know what I mean? Well, your owner could literally be abusing drugs and fucking around with everyone, you know? And nobody gives a shit heavy. Tremendous. Just live in that quiet time out there. Wouldn't that be nice? All I think it would be. You know, I also think it'd be nice if I could get some fucking questions over here. I don't know what else I'm supposed to do with myself. Well, what am I up to here for 45 fucking minutes and me running my Yap and trying to read out loud. This is getting ridiculous. You guys won't listen to me. Send a text. This is pathetic. You know, I'm gonna start my fucking Christmas shopping. I know.

Speaker 1:          00:45:52       I was going to say, so I fucking came back on the, I know I'm all over the place. Fuck you. It's how my brain works. So I'm on the fucking subway. I get off and I meet Jay law had it this fucking bar. And it's just one of these cool fucking bars they're not a lot of people know about. But enough people know about that. It stays open. You could fuck a chill out in there, man. He could have a good time. And it was perfect. It was a perfect old man fucking bar. I apologize for yawning if I'm making you tired at work. Um, and everything's going good. And then out of nowhere, this cool bar, they started having karaoke and all these fucking nerds are going up there and just go and just go in full out singing, horrific saying it, dancing, just absolutely awful. Just a horrible display of communication was going on. And it was annoying the shit out of me cause I just wanted a peanut quiet place. Ah, drinking. Why am I young? And all of the places drinking of fucking, you know, a bear or something. I just want to be a nice quiet fucking place. Right. And um,

Speaker 2:          00:47:01       the fucking

Speaker 1:          00:47:03       halfway through them singing and dance is everything. I actually fucking tap la head and I go, I go look at them, look at them, law ahead, look at them. I go, that's what's heckling you on Twitter right now. Look at, I'm trying to dance. Look at these fucking animals. Trying to sing. Look at them. These are the people. These are the, that blog.

Speaker 1:          00:47:31       These are the people that get offended. Oh, look at colors. What? That mail, Michael's bald rock and the scarves. I never understand why they have the scar or they, are they inside or are they outside? They always make them look like they got the window open. I had to, I need to take a nap. What the fuck just happened? You know what it is. I'm getting sleepy waiting for these fucking rage to come over here. Um, you know, I'm interviewing Pete Corey Ellie this week, uh, for the Thursday afternoon, just before Friday, Monday morning podcast where I check in on you. And uh, he has a new special out on showtime. I believe. This is one of my favorite comics that, uh, not enough people know about. Um, great storyteller. And I've known him. I've known this guy for 20 fucking years. Back when we used to, um, I worked in New York comedy club together, late night spots and all that. Who the fuck is that guy? Brady keeps throwing to the Anti Gronk. Who is that guy?

Speaker 4:          00:48:25       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:48:26       Oh yeah. We get a pass interference. Ah, he comes up first. Loss of the year. Oh, well what the fuck are you going to do anyways? Um, you know what? I'm gonna hit pause again. I'm going to wait for these things. I swear to God. This is, this is the most fucked up podcast I've ever done. I'm going to wait for these, these, I'm coming back reading people going to prepare your right now. All right, I'll be back. Well, you know, if the technology help you back in a second, right?

Speaker 4:          00:48:48       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:48:49       All right, I'm back. I don't know if that's right word that I say. All right. I'm back because it didn't seem like I left with the fucking editing. Right. Shut up bill. We get it. He hit pause. Um, I can't find it. I guess. I don't remember. My reads aren't coming through this week, so I'm just going to fucking pick some shit out here as I go from old email. Somebody sent me something because I mentioned that I went to chipotle and they had all these signs on the wall about how, Hey, we don't put any shit in our food, which may be fucking weirded out. Like, well, you shouldn't, but I guess so many people do. I don't know. So I thought, you know, made them seem shady to me. Right? By the way, it's 2117 at this point in my world. All for fuck sakes.

Speaker 1:          00:49:30       He gotta catch that is behind him though. Um, anyways. Yeah. It says, Hey, bill, just want to drop you a line about chipotle a, which you've mentioned on Thursdays podcast. Check out this recent article in La Times. Chipotle is being harassed by a bogus consumer watchdog group that is actually funded by restaurant alcohol, tobacco in energy companies. They are spending millions of dollars harassed and companies that do or say anything, which goes against the interest of their clients. Chipotle, a stance against antibiotics in meat has apparently incurred their wrath. Uh, this firm is engaged in a very public ad campaign smearing chipotle ace. So I think probably this think this probably has something to do with all of the sides you saw in chipotle a the other day touting their product and what they do differently. Thanks for the podcast. Go Fuck Yourself. So I clicked on the link there and um,

Speaker 1:          00:50:25       and it says, why is it nonprofit shill for business interest attacking chipotle? So as the US Department of Health, and you mean human services says that if you're being pushed around by a bully, walk away and stay away. Don't fight backs. Chipola has taken this message to heart. Evidently they're not fighting these guys. Chris Arnold is spokesman for the Burrito chain, told me Chipola has no plans to tangle with the food industry front group that has run a series of ads critical of the company's health claims. Uh, the guy says, Chris says this is a smear campaign, but we've chosen to take the high road position. Most recent ad appeared last week in the New York Post. It said, chipolte lay is scaring the public and tricking people. And to thinking that change meat is healthier because it's quote antibiotic Free Blahblahblahblah so allegedly this is just some, this is a group that's pretending to be a watchdog group, but it's actually, you know, a spokesman for probably corporations that put antibiotics in their fucking food. Um,

Speaker 2:          00:51:26       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:51:27       And all of this other shit. Jesus, Tom Brady is just acting like a fucking lunatic one. Are they going to throw a flag and a guy? I know he's got seniority, but even as a patriots fan, what is, yeah, he's, you know, he's fucking flipping out.

Speaker 2:          00:51:43       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:51:43       Yeah, he's losing his cool. Okay. Like Tommy, Tommy, get the fuck outta here. Okay. You're the face of the Goddamn leak. We, we can't give you a fucking Gronk seems frustrated. Oh, are the Broncos cheating? God, it's all right. That's okay. Are they, are they doing little fucking underhanded tech days to get an advantage? That's okay. You're in Denver. It's fine. It's fine. No cheating. No underhanded shit there. Tom Brady, throw a date out of fucking, what the fuck? Boy, this doesn't seem like it's our night now. It does it 2117. Now it's fourth and 15. I don't like it. I'm already drinking already. Good. I heard you got a beer here. So anyways, these fucking guys, I guess. Um, I don't understand how these groups are legal. Just had been around for years where,

Speaker 2:          00:52:30       okay,

Speaker 1:          00:52:31       you can put together a fake group. Like Rick Berman, executive director of the center acknowledged that the organization is funded by part, by food and beverages company. Um, he declined to name any of the contributors and he and the guy goes, it doesn't matter who pays as long as what I'm saying is truthful and I'm telling the truth. What a crock of shit. Um, you know what? I guess so who knows? I don't even know what to believe now. I guess now I'll go to fucking Chipola. Yeah, I don't fucking know. I, oh, what is it a belief? I mean, if you're going to have fucking, you don't understand this genetically altered salmon now. Like why? Like why were we allowed to vote on that? Why don't they put that to the people? Why is that the fucking center? Oh, that's right. Cause they got them all paid off right now. It works. Jesus Christ. Do I have to hit pause again? I do got to find another letter. This is like fucking a, this is like what podcasting in the 18 hundreds must've been that been like, right. I got a bad feeling. We're going to lose his fucking game. I built to the Patriots. Help you pay your bills. Oh, but I mean, you know.

Speaker 4:          00:53:40       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:53:41       Did the football team of my city be back in a minute? All right, so I guess there's going to be no reads this weekend. I don't know what to fucking tell you. I don't know where the fuck they are, but I'm not waiting around all night. All right. There's four minutes left. We had off the ball and a fucking Taggle is again right at the line of scrimmage. Um, some of my drum teacher got me into tears for fears this week. I couldn't stand them in the 80s. I just hated the guy's face. You know, he, the way he sort of launched his face at the fucking camera as he sang.

Speaker 6:          00:54:15       Well, go to Ma.

Speaker 1:          00:54:30       Right. And I just couldn't get past if fucking face. So first day out. So he fucking three and a half minutes left, come on Patriots, hang in there, get a fork and vehicle vehicle over there. Um, that's still won't help us that way. I feel go put out up by fucking seven points. I like it. So anyways, um, he goes, listen to this, uh, tears for fears and I was like, oh, like, oh my God. Tears for fears. Every, every body wants to rule the world and fight. You know how many times I've heard that fucking song? Like now I don't mind tears for fears because it reminds me of the 80s when I was young, had a full head of hair my whole life in front of me. You know, you know, my pants were all puffy. I was lifting weights every day, but only the upper body.

Speaker 4:          00:55:17       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:55:17       The way you supposed to, oh no, to Gronk just get hurt. And he took it. Oh No. Oh No. Oh No, no. Oh No. Ah, fuck dude. Everybody who's even remotely good on the team, his heart now, except Brady. I shouldn't have just said that. Oh Jesus. Oh, they just went to commercial. Just went black. Ah, fuck. Anyways. Um, so he says, listen to this tears for fears. You know, everybody wants to rule the world. I might get the fuck, you know, so I'm listening to it for years. I never heard what was going on with the high hat. You know, the guy's playing triplets, but he's, he's playing them in groups of two. He accents every other one.

Speaker 1:          00:56:06       Listen to it. I always thought was just dumped on the talk. I thought it was sad. I didn't know like the high I was going to get, get, get, get, get, get, get, get, get, get right. Only drummers understand what I'm talking about, right Juan. And uh, it's kind of like a, the way you, when you first learned how to jerk off, like, you know, you just try and dat, Dat, dat, Dat, dat. It's the same fucking thing except he threw it on the high end. But anyways, there's a point in the story that maybe you guys can relate to this, the most fucked up podcasts, um, that I've done is he then played the song about the ladies at some fucking song about women set them free and quit fucking around with them or whatever the hell it is. Where is it? I downloaded the song, but this is sick ass fucking Phil.

Speaker 2:          00:56:50       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:56:50       Towards the end of the song. And, uh, my drum teacher showed it to me. You know, if it goes over the bar line comes out on the end of one. It's fucking unreal. And who is it? Who is it on drums? Phil Collins.

Speaker 2:          00:57:06       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:57:07       And I go, you gotta be kidding me? People on my podcast is shitting on Phil Collins talking about, you know how we sucks this sad look at Gronk. He's down a fuck. This is bad. They keep saying how he sucks in all that, you know, and he was going, you, we talk about, this guy's a fucking monster. Hear this shit. He didn't, uh, was it brand x? Oh No, we got hit right in the fucking knee. Um, all of that type of stuff. Um, Oh God, that's bad our guys, I'm sorry I'm watching them. I'll never do this again. This is like fucking ridiculous that I'm doing this at the same time. Um, but anyways, I'm covering my eyes cause I don't want to fucking see his leg knee wiggle like that again. This is, this is why people hate Phil Collins.

Speaker 2:          00:57:57       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:57:58       All right. It's because they don't take the time to act like this is a guy. He's such a fucking talent that he actually

Speaker 2:          00:58:06       yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:58:07       blank and he could go to Berkeley, play drums. I mean I know he's had health problems but at the height of his popularity and the height of his skills, I should say before he got hurt, like that guy could fucking force health. I'm looking at Gronk for, for his health got fucked up. I'm sorry guys. This fucking guy would have like, like musicians at Barkley with their jaws on the fucking ground. All right. And they're into all his prog rock shit. But then he was so good, he could actually fucking write songs that made 14 year old girls dance around like Molly Ringwald and breakfast club. And the problem is, is your average jackass, classy bronco fans clapping right there, class act right there. The fucking year average jackass isn't going to listen to the, to the prog rock stuff. So all they're going to listen to his studio and all that. I remember in the 80s, I fucking hated Phil Collins. Mid Eighties. I couldn't stand the guy. And then when I started playing drums and I started paying attention to who was drawing on what,

Speaker 1:          00:59:05       I was like, wow, this guy dropped on the tears for fear things. He drums for this in the 80s. Robert Plant, Eric Clapton Zeplin got together, he played with them. Um, if he really, I don't think that they would be bringing this guy along. What'd Ya? So I would say listen to, uh, some of his oldest shit. That's all I'm saying. I, you know what, I'm going to put a clip up of him just fucking playing, uh, just playing drums and uh, people probably still say that he sucks, but I think he's the shit. Um, but anyways, um, can I bail now guys? Can I just say that? That's the podcasts. I'm sorry I didn't have the fucking materials I need it, but I got a, uh, I got an early day tomorrow. I'm starting to get ready hyping the F is for family by the way. I'm getting great feedback on that. And uh, I just wish it would come out already. And uh, we got a premiere coming up out here in la, which I'm really excited and nervous about. Um, is this weird feeling

Speaker 1:          01:00:05       when you watch something that you did and it's being shown on a screen and you can't fix it and it's just going to be played. It freaks me the fuck out because I'm used to performing live and if it's going Shitty, I can speed up, I can slow down this, this, I can make at least try to make some adjustments. But like if you're in something and it's not working with the crowd, you just got to sit there and write it out. And um, you know, it's a, it's a helpless feeling. So I'm excited about that night, but I'm also nervous, but I'm going to be coming back east to do some, uh, to do some press and then I come out here and do a few more than I go to the premiere. But, uh, once again, it comes out December 18th. Uh, also as I mentioned, thank you to everybody who went and bought Felicia Collins new, a blues album off of iTunes.

Speaker 1:          01:00:54       Uh, what else? They would want to have all of the great stocking stuffer for 2015. His tickets to the, uh, the fourth annual Patrice O'neil comedy benefit, um, that's going to be going down Tuesday, January 26. Did I say go and down? I think I did. You know why? Cause I was trying to focus on what I was saying here and not the fact that we just had a punt. The fucking ball away again, um, makes a great gift. It's obviously in remembrance of, um, one of the great friends I ever had in life. And, uh, I was talking to his mom the other day and it reminded me of, uh, so fucking Patrice O'Neal story. He called me up one time, right. This is back when we were both still living at home with our parents.

Speaker 2:          01:01:42       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:01:43       And I pick up the phone, he's like, Bill, he goes, what are you doing as like, I'm not doing anything? He goes, yeah, let's go up to the, uh, the square one mall.

Speaker 2:          01:01:54       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:01:55       And I'm like, all right, where's that? And he's like, it's up near Saga, sub near the, uh, the cow loon. And um, I go, all right, why the fuck would I go? What do we have to go up there for it? He goes, well, you know, they, they, I, I need to get a mop.

Speaker 2:          01:02:11       Okay,

Speaker 1:          01:02:12       I got you needed a mopey goes. Yeah. And granted, this fucking mall is like, dislike three miles between where Patrice lived and where I lived. And he wants to go all the way out of his fucking way to go up to this God damn mouth.

Speaker 2:          01:02:26       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:02:27       And I like what the fuck kind of mall but kind of mop do they have at this square one mall and he's like, oh he goes one of them square one mall mops motherfucker. And he starts flipping out on me. So I go, all right. I just finally got it out of him. He wanted to go up there cause it was right when they first put cheese in the fucking crushed a pizza and he wanted to try it out. He started laughing when I finally got it out, he goes, I got to try it. I got to see what it's all about. So we drove up in the middle of the fucking day, sitting in traffic on route one to buy a fucking mop and so he could try stuffed crust pizza. I don't know why I told you that. I'm just trying, I'm trying to fill up the fucking hour here. If I'd done an hour, is it mercifully over g? You guys saw my Kryptonite right here, man. If I don't fucking,

Speaker 2:          01:03:22       yeah,

Speaker 1:          01:03:22       if I don't have any questions, what do I do for that last half an hour? I have no idea. In order to realize is how few people email me and give a fuck everything on there was just bullshit about uh, it was either spam or it was shit about a f is for family, one of the other, you got to do this, you got to do that or a, it's just a bunch of horse shit. I, I I thought I could scroll through a couple pages. I could find something I guess cause you guys send them to the other email and I don't even know how to get to it. Oh, is that what you think bill? All right. That's been the Monday morning podcast. This is a completely fucked up one. I apologize profusely for this awful free podcast. All right. Before you guys start blogging about it and you're telling me that you're offended.

Speaker 1:          01:04:04       Um, anyways, hey, if anybody sees that movie creed, let me know if it's good enough cause I actually want to see that. Uh, on two levels. One, uh, I'm a big fan of Sylvester Stallone and to, uh, I need to get back in shape. So I figured whoever's playing, you know, still owns always in shape. Even it's 70 fucking 70. He's still in shape. Oh, how about the fucking Bruins, by the way, when in five in a row? Is that what happened? I think they did. All right. That's the podcast. Go fuck yourselves. Uh, Pete Corey, Ellie this Thursday, and thank you once again to a Joe Rogan for me on the Joe Rogan experience to help me promote the F is for family. I really appreciate it. All right. Go fuck yourselves. We'll talk to you next week.
