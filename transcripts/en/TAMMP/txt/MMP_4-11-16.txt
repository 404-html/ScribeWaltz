Speaker 1:          00:00:02       Hey, what's going on? Is Bill Burn? It's time for the Monday morning podcast for Monday, April 11th, April 11th, 2016 what's going on? I worry. Yeah, it's a, it's Sunday night to Sunday evening. I'm in the house all by myself. Uh, the lovely Nia had some business meeting or some shit she had to go to. Um, it's show business. I know what you're saying. You guys all live in the normal world. You're thinking like, wait, my wife says she's got a business meeting on a Sunday night at fucking yeah. Surpass a certain hour. That means she's out there banging somebody. I know. That's what you think. But I'm in show business so it's totally normal for them to go out that way. What the fuck happened to the high hat over here? I told you I got my little fucking practice set up there. What the fuck is maybe Cleo was playing it when I wasn't here anyways.

Speaker 1:          00:00:59       Any she um, yeah, so she's out. So I'm going to try to knock this out cause uh, I gotta be at work on Monday for something. For some reason, I still can't say whether what it is or what's going on. Hopefully. Uh, so yeah, you know what it is. You know what it is. Maybe you don't know what it is. Maybe you don't listen to every week, but you know what it is. So I gotta be at work on Monday and uh, oh, Billy fucking, uh, clean living ever since I got back from Canada. Oh, Canada, you punch a freeze and cuts. I got just got back from there. And, uh, I kind of realized that when I go on the road with the fellows, we act like we're on some sort of bachelor party. I don't know what it is, minus the fucking who is everything else.

Speaker 1:          00:01:48       Uh, we basically, uh, you know, we booze and we smoked cigars and that thing and it's just, yeah, it takes a lot out of me and I got a bunch of shit I gotta do. So I kind of need to be clearheaded as opposed to the usual, you know, usually when I got nothing going on in my life. I mean I can fucking, you are going to have a few. Right. And I can wake up the next morning like fucking eggs or something. Right. I can be in that mindset, but uh, as of right now, I can't, so, um, I have not done anything. Haven't touch shit. I haven't fucking, I haven't drank, I haven't smoked a meeting pretty good. Uh, even laying off the internet porn, I mean it's just fucking over actually got this time magazine that was about Internet porn and how it's like fucking people up, you know, especially like kids, you know, when they first like just the shit, the Schmooze kitten home, this shit you can see on the fucking Internet. I can't believe nobody's stepped in. I'm not saying somebody should step in, but, um, you know, I gotta tell you if, if, if they knew what the fuck the Internet was going to be when it was, whenever Al Gore was inventing it back the eighties.

Speaker 1:          00:03:02       Um, I'll never said that. I said that I was at, I was involved in the email chain, whatever the fuck he said. That fucking guy.

Speaker 1:          00:03:12       Remember when his campaign was over, man, when he was dancing around and all sweaty and all that shit and how he just looked like he was so fucking relieved that it was over. Um, what a thing to go through running for president. I just saw a clip, a Hillary Clinton. I have not been paying attention at all, but Jesus Christ, what the fuck happened to her? She looks like Earl fucking weaver. She's like Earl weaver. She was doing something right. She was standing in some black church, right? Baptist church. I'm going to assume you know, I don't think it was a Jewish synagogue there. Whatever the fuck they could temple she's or there's green shoots. You just like yelling the shit she was going to do. That's the only time a politician goes near the black community is when they're running. They fucking, they swing by the church.

Speaker 1:          00:03:59       They make a whole bunch of promises and then they get in the fucking limo and they go, let's get the fuck outta here. Fuck out of dodge. Then they go over, they do a town meeting, talk to all the lunch pail Louise. Right. Then if they, if there's even those people left in this country, if you fucking make anything, they get over there and they say roll up their sleeves. That's when you know they're talking to the working man. They take off their sport coat and they roll up the sleeves, you know, like they going to build something rather than just go out there and say the exact same bullshit. They just said the Baptist church with more of a fucking lunch pail swing do it right. And the whole fucking thing. It's just gross. I don't know anybody sits there and watch that shit, but um,

Speaker 2:          00:04:44       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:04:45       The latest thing that I become fascinated with is I completely leave whatever the fuck I was just talking about. I'll come back to it. The clean living thing, who wants to listen about clean living? It's the most boring shit ever, you know? Anyways. Um,

Speaker 2:          00:04:59       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:04:59       I become fascinated with how super rich people,

Speaker 2:          00:05:04       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:05:05       Avoid paying taxes.

Speaker 1:          00:05:07       Just fucking fascinating. It's one of those things, you know, it's like you got to respect it on just certain level. It's just the brilliance of it. And then there's a certain level of balls that that takes because you're fucking with your freedom anytime you fucking with taxes, you know what I mean? Fucking what the government, anytime you get doing that, I mean, you know, why is it that, I don't know. What the fuck is that a federal thing? I guess if you're not paying your federal income tax yet, Bill, that would probably be a federal crime. I Dunno. I always hear you got to cross state borders. Do you get to like not pay taxes and then leave your state before it becomes federal? I don't know. I don't know these things. But anyways, um, just the balls in it takes and the, uh, I dunno, I don't like people physically, other people, that type of crime. But when there's something like robbing banks or tax evasion or even a good old fashioned fucking scam, if there's like a, like an amazing level of thought behind it on some level, you got to respect it. I think, you know what I mean? Like I remember a long time ago there was some fucking guy, he figured out how to rob parking meters.

Speaker 1:          00:06:30       Yeah, they were allegedly, it was impossible to do. So this guy figured out how to fucking do it. It's amazing. And he did this shit. This is back in like the 80s or some shit. This guy figured out how to do it. So it was way, way, way easier to not have everybody breathing down your fucking throat. You know, people will be having eggs watching you fucking robbing a parking meter. They didn't have a fucking smart phone on them. They just be sitting there going, it's fucking got guy. Just is that Guy Robin and parking meter.

Speaker 1:          00:07:02       Oh his shit. The fuck. See that? Everybody see that? That was it. That's all in fucking happened rather than some dope shit. And they're filming you and you were arrested before you even get home. All right. And then the fucking local newscasters, they always got to do some sort of fucking bad pun. You know what I mean? I'll tell you, this guy's life is freedom is now going to change. You know, they do that. Some are, they get away with that and I'm like fucking newspapers. Like they can have the biggest fucking puns ever. And everybody thinks it's great. You know? I don't know. I, I can't even think of one right now. Yeah. But uh, whatever, you know, you sit at home and you think about it, you said you're a fucking cubicle instead of doing your goddamn work, you think of one. So anyways, this fucking guy figured out how to do this shit.

Speaker 1:          00:07:52       Um, and of course the parking meter gods were beside themselves. You know what I mean? It was like one of those Scifi movies. We're like the titanic movie land. Not even God can sick it. That's so they will like, not even God could get the fucking quarters out of this meter. This may, right. That's, they were talking all kinds of shit to this fucking guy figured out how to do it and you'd think you'd like a high whatever, man. You too. Well, what the fuck are you going to do with that? We'll do this fucking meters all over the city. So this guy, anytime you wanted a drink, if you wanted a fucking sandwich, he, his guy, he had it perfect.

Speaker 1:          00:08:27       It was like his own ATM machine before ATM machines, he just walk up, bank bank, boom. He had a sack of fucking quarters. You go down to the bank, you go here, can I get one? Some of the rolly fucking things there, right? Yeah, sure. They don't give a shit. Nobody gave a fuck back then. Nobody was paying attention. They were trying to pay attention but not not to that type of shit. So this guy would roll the fucking quarters, you know, roles enough quarters. Next thing you know, he gets himself out of how the fuck you get all those quarters down to a car dealership. I have no fucking idea. Although I talked to some drug dealers about how they fucking, um, or a guy of new drug dealers. Let's be honest at bill, let's not act like that news guy saying that you were in the war and then you were in a chopper, Assam Shit next to the chopper and you didn't really fucking see it.

Speaker 1:          00:09:11       Okay. You took a fucking helicopter tour one time. You weren't even in Iraq. Whatever the fuck he said, I don't pay attention to shit. So anyways, I was talking to this guy and basically how back in the day when drug dealers was still driving around and flashy cars, cause when I heard nowadays they, they don't even want to track that level of attention. Um, how it used to be was anything, any cash deal that was over 10 grand grant had to be fucking reported. So what these drug dealers would do was they would go out and they buy a car worth nine grand for cash and then they drive it around for like a fucking week. And then they traded in for a car was 16 grant, maybe get seven for theirs and then they throw another fucking night at the other car. Now they got a $16,000 car.

Speaker 1:          00:09:56       I drive around for a little bit. You fucking trade it in or $23,000 car. They give you a fifth whatever and so on and so forth til you trade your way all the way up to whatever fucking car you want it. Um, it just, I just look at that shit. It's like, I mean, that's not the, the deepest thing, but that's the way my brain would work. I'd be like, well, it goes so good. I drive a piece of shit. Then what's the point of dealing drugs? Right? Or I just say, fuck it. I'm buying a Ferrari and I'm want to drive it until they catch me fucking three weeks later. Um, by the way, the Ferrari I like is the Ferrari California. That's the old man. Once the fucking gt, the grand touring one, right. I don't know. You ride around in some Batmobile, just gimme one that's shaped like a fucking Jaguar from back in the day, you know, or maybe a Toyota supra, those fucking things from the 80s.

Speaker 1:          00:10:53       I remember this sky loaned me his, well, he used my truck to move and I, Brandon, I'd beat the shit out of his car and he'd beat the fuck out of my truck and we both got a cars back and he's smelling rubber and I'm seeing all kinds of scratches all over my truck. And we just, Eh, it's kind of a fair deal, right? And then we both got arrested for drinking and drive it months later. But that's a completely different story. I know. I'm all over the map. I'm doing this late night and I don't want to be doing it right now, but I got shit to do in the morning. So anyways, it's fucking guy. You know, if he had half a fucking brain, what you do is you keep your day job, right? Keep your fucking day job, and then, you know, for anything miscellaneous, she gets to go to the parking meters, right?

Speaker 1:          00:11:36       And what you do is you start storing up on the quarters. Then every once in a while, right? You just start, you start washing the money with you fucking cat. I know what you do. You fucking, you go into stores and stuff, who gives a fuck? Right? You just use it to get yourself a better TV. But what is this dope do? He gets fucking greedy. I didn't even buy a fucking story goes. All I know is he just started hitting every fucking God damn parking meter around. And next thing you know he's sitting on like a fucking $2 million in quarters and he ended up getting busted. But there was a part of it. I liked the guy, you know. So anyways, this gets me to the super rich on how you know all that shit about the Panama papers and all that type of stuff.

Speaker 1:          00:12:17       I was talking to another friend of mine who's a fucking lawyer and I was like, how does that work? Like how do you get your money out of the country? And then once it's out of the country, how do you make sure nobody steals it? Like what happened to Johnny Depp's character and blow? And then once you have it out of the country, how do you get it back in without just getting taxed all over again? A busted and he said, basically this is it. And he broke the whole fucking thing down. All right. Or as far as I know, he broken aspect of it down. I know all you guys are sitting in right now going, Oh gee, she's going to try to explain to him, I'm going to try to explain some shit that was just explained to me and I don't really know what the fuck I'm talking about.

Speaker 1:          00:12:58       So let's get rid of one myth right out of the gate. I remember a long time ago, a friend of mine had a fucking landscaping business and he already had a truck and he went out and he bought this giant fucking, you know, one of those things with the dual wheels on the back and this fucking giant Bedley you put cattle in it, right? And I was like, holy fuck man, how much is that thing costs? And you know, it was like the 80s it cost like 25 grand, which was a lot of fucking money back then. Right? Um, for a truck, you know, it's like 10 grand more than you pay the 25 30 grand or some shit. Right? I was like, Holy Shit Man, you can afford that. And he was like, yeah, it's a write off. That's what a lot of dope safe. And they, they, it is a write off, but what they think is, is that they can write $30,000 off of their taxes, which you can't.

Speaker 1:          00:13:41       What you can do is you can write off, it's a write off as far as that 30 grand that you just spent in that truck is untakeable all right, it's sitting in whatever you made that money you made 30 grand. If it's just sitting there and you don't put it back into play as far as reinvesting into your business, the government will tax you at the end of the year. You know, on that 30 grand. And let's say you're in like a fucking a whatever, 20% tax bracket that you'd, you'd have to give the government fucking six grant. Right? That's it. So the people more on steak, oh, I get to write 33 in the end of the year. If I owed 40 grand in taxes and I bought a $30,000 truck, I get to take $30,000 off on my taxes. You wouldn't, you just be able to knock off six grand, right?

Speaker 1:          00:14:33       You're not even knocking it off. You just not getting taxed on that. Does that make sense? Probably doesn't cause I explained it. So anyways, when you have your own business, what you're trying to do is you're trying to come up with as many fucking writeoffs as you possibly can't. Many expenses, everything you possibly can to lower your, your basic, your, uh, whatever your income as far as what is going to be taxable. So say you made fucking a hundred grand. All right? Your gross to a hundred grand. The net is what you're left with after your expenses, you try to fucking come up with as many God expenses as you can to get that hundred grand is far down as zero as possible. Ideally you wouldn't want to pay any fucking taxes as far as these people look. But the bottom line is you can only do it so much and if you write off too much, the IRS is going to show up and be like, what's this fucking, you know, 60 grand for fucking cheeseburgers, blah, blah, blah. You tried to write off, you need going to get busted. All right? So what these fucking super rich people do is, the first thing they do is they get the fucking money out of the, out of the, out of the country

Speaker 1:          00:15:48       because the IRS has jurisdiction doesn't go beyond the borders. So what they do is they just create a company that doesn't exist. It just, it's just on paper, right? So say you make $100 million, right? What you do is you go to a country that doesn't give a shit about America and let you use it as a tax shelter. You just come up with some incorporated thing, like who gives a fuck ink, right? And then you just have that company bill, your company, a consulting fee for $100 million or whatever, the whatever of the hundred billion, 30 40 50 whatever. You don't want to pay taxes on whatever you, whatever. And then you write a check to that company that doesn't exist. That's really you. And then you send it out. So now it's out of the fucking country.

Speaker 3:          00:16:34       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:16:35       And then what they do is they open up like 10 other, these fucking shell companies and they have those other companies build the first company. And then the third one bills, the second one, the fourth 1 billion. It's just got the monies fucking gone. Now the IRS could come in and you'll be like, what the fuck did you pay somebody? $100 million consulting fee. And then you're telling me,

Speaker 3:          00:16:54       okay,

Speaker 1:          00:16:55       you paid somebody

Speaker 1:          00:16:57       $100 million as a consulting fee. And then you just look at him and go, yes. And evidently there's nothing they can fucking do about it. So then I was out. I go, all right, so now it's out of the country and then this, it's in this other country. How the fuck do you protect it? And they, and he goes, well you those countries where these tax shelters are there in on the scab. So you just kicked them 10% of the hundred million, you give him 10 his fucking whatever you can negotiate. We'll just make it easy. Here's 10 million bucks. So what I, you know, I'll give you 10 million rather than the, given the government fucking 50 55 60 million at a 100 million, I'm still fucking up 45 million. All right. So then I was like, all right, so now how do you get the money back? Because if you know you bring the money back is to the bank, they're going to consider that earned income. Like where the fuck did you get it? And this guy was like, they, they bring it back into the country in the form of a loan.

Speaker 4:          00:17:58       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:17:59       Loans aren't taxable, right? Like, if you get a fucking loan cause you already paying interest on it and everything, they don't tax you. So they just bring it back in the form of a loan, whatever the fuck you want to do. I want to buy a $10 million house. You have this Shell company that's 10 times removed from the one that you paid for the consulting fee. Right. And they can't follow the paper trail because it's in a different country. Right. You just bring it back into the country in the form of a loan.

Speaker 4:          00:18:21       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:18:23       And then you go buy a fucking house. And I guess, I don't know, you pretend to make payments on the loan is forgiven by this shell company. That's still you. I know. I just glossed over that and if anybody has more information on it, I find it absolutely fascinating. There's all, there's other ones, they just pretend that that's their main business, um, that shell companies. So they just act like it's doing the, I don't know that that's, that's as far as I can remember that what he told me and I found that shit absolutely fucking fascinating because at the end of the fucking day, as far as what they're doing, I know they're fucking over you and me because you know, the school systems go down the shitter because they don't have enough money. There's a lot of potholes is all kinds of stuff. You can't take care of your homeless people. You can't build another gleaming structure for a fucking sports team. Whatever the fuck it is.

Speaker 4:          00:19:15       Uh,

Speaker 1:          00:19:17       the end of the day is fucked up is that, is these people who are criminals, they're stealing from other criminals. As far as my, uh, conspiracy theory goes to the IRS. It's just a bunch of fucking crux. Anyway, so I made they, it's kind of fascinating watching these two giant powerful entities fuck with each other, you know, meanwhile,

Speaker 4:          00:19:42       yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:19:44       When the cross hairs, you're in the crosshairs and we're all paying Elvis taxes and that goes Hillary Clinton's screaming and some Baptist church. Is she talking about that shit? Because she is it, because when you bring the fucking money back in, you just don't bring it in and go out by yourself. You fucking Ferrari California. What you do is, I mean, you do do that, but what else should, what you also do is you walk around with nice water cash and you go, oh, hey, chief of police. Oh, look at that Birdie over there. And as he looks over your stuff, a fucking wad of cash in his pocket, you know, and then I'll, oh, is it an election year? Yeah. Let me get a take 2 million on Trump. Give me 2.5 on Hillary and a fuck it. Give me 500 grand. A Bernie Sanders. What do you mean he's not taking any money from guys?

Speaker 1:          00:20:30       Like make, oh, is that right? Oh, well, you know, whatever. He won't get it. And if he does, uh, you know, I'll give 3 million to, well, you know, silence. That's what the fuck they do. And that's, and that's how they, they, you know, I don't know. I'm convinced of that. I'm convinced as far as like standup comedy goes, you know why they're always giving a shit is because a standup comedians just organized. Okay. And we donated to the campaigns of people running for two, the democratic and the Republican parties. Right. And then we bought a little ad time on CNN and on Fox News and all these major networks. If we did that, you'd never see another comedian getting in trouble for doing a fucking Caitlyn Jenner joke anyways. If anybody has any more information on that or they can talk about, I, I don't like if it's really dry, I just like, um, I'm fascinated with people that do shit like that. And then they go to bed, no one what the fuck they're doing. And they got to be thinking at some point, like the wolves gotta be coming to the door at some point. Hang on one second. I got to answer this.

Speaker 1:          00:21:42       All right. So I'm back. Of course. I completely forget what the fuck out where I ended off. Um, but what I really learned when I was, you know, listening to this lawyer telling me all this shit, um, oh, I know I seen the balls at that takes to go to bed at night knowing one at any point. Like, all of a sudden the fucking feds are gonna kick in your fucking door. But I think that these guys are like the smarter ones. And when you watch like American greed, what I noticed when I watched them, all of their fuckery was within the borders of the United States, which you just, I mean, if you, I guess if you're too dumb to know, you don't realize you're not going to get away with it forever. But like, once I, um, after talking to this guy, it just seems like anybody who just tries to have their entire illegal entity within the borders of one country is, uh, you're just on borrowed time. So I think when you watch American greed, what you're really seeing is, is the hacks of, uh, you know, you always see these fucking idiots. They buy a house, they get all these fucking cars and they have some strippers come over. Oh my fucking laptop. Oh, that was a laptop hitting hardboard floors. Come on. Come on baby. Come on. Come around. You're all right. Hang in there and help us on the way.

Speaker 4:          00:22:59       Fuck yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:23:01       Ah, you fucking motherfucker. Steve Jobs is laughing somewhere right now. He's laughing at me cause I got to give him money and he also know this can be another little kids. Get to put it together. All right. It's saved. It's saved. Um,

Speaker 4:          00:23:14       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:23:15       So anyways, uh, let's read a little bit of fucking Ad Shit here before my screen goes dark.

Speaker 1:          00:23:22       Hang on a second. I find that shit. I find it, um, I find all that stuff fucking amazing. It's really, really interesting.

Speaker 1:          00:28:20       All right. Um, oh Jesus. Oh Jesus. I got to bring it up. My Boston Bruins, unfortunately. Um, after a big, big win over the Detroit Red Wings, uh, got beat down by Ottawa, six to one and a, we're out of it. You know, it's funny, we'd beat Detroit the game before and then because we lost Detroit, get in and do you know, there was actually a certain amount of fucking red wing fence that we're actually talking shit, the smart ones were going, hey, thanks for losing. And then the other ones look good fucking 26 years in a row. We've been in the playoffs. Yeah, it's impressive. But this year you backed in like a bitch. You went in. As far as, I don't know what you fuck. I mean, because it team that you couldn't even beat when it counts two days before, you know who fucking manhandled you. I don't know what you're excited about.

Speaker 1:          00:29:14       You know, you like the fat chick who got, you know, fucking ass to the Prob, you know, you're all exceeded. She just wanted to be there. Who's getting know you're there for the fucking buffet and then you go and home crying. That's what I'm predicting for Detroit. Your makeup's going to be running by game three of the first series. I'm fucking with you. I have no hate for anybody that's in the playoffs this year. Uh, I think I'm going to one. And I've always liked Detroit. Um, cause when I was growing up they never won shit. Yeah. Big thing is they had one it since 1955 with Gordie Howe and um, they weren't in the middle of a 40 year drought. Um, before they got a team around Eisenman and Nah, man, that was what great times watching hockey, that fucking avalanche Redwings fucking rivalry. That was the best.

Speaker 1:          00:30:04       It was the first time when I lived in La and the games came home at five and I totally got back into hockey and you get all this original six oh, is to burst up. Sorry. Buchard Yada here. So, um, so this year I think in the east, uh, I'm gonna, I'm gonna, I'm gonna root for two fucking teams this year in the east and the West. Uh, the, I'm rooting for the capitals to push through to get to the finals and a, as much as I liked the kings and the black hawks, just to switch it up, I'd love to see the Dallas stars or a, the St Louis Blues, you know, somebody different, you know, Saint Louis Blues who's kidnapped fans have been waiting for fucking ever. They have been in the league. They're part of the expansion six that came in 1967. All right. The NHL was a 16 league. Um, before that, right after the depression, there was a lot of people that I didn't realize this either. There was a, there was a bunch of other teams, not a bunch, but there was like fleece for other fucking teams are something that all folded after the, the, uh, the depression and the six that survived and became known as the original six. Um, so in 1967 sixteenths came in. Can you name off the top of my head? Let's see. There was the flyers. The penguins.

Speaker 2:          00:31:26       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:31:26       The North Stars. Oh, Jesus. The California golden seals.

Speaker 1:          00:31:37       Ah Man. I used to know this off the top of my head. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Capital's didn't come in until the early seventies. Fuck. Make St Louis Blues. Jesus Christ. It just brought them up. One more. One more. Was it a Seattle team? Cleveland Barons. It's with the fucking golden seals became, didn't they? All the fucking La kinks. Yeah, the La Kings way. The fuck out there. And that was funny when for the Golden Seals, like folded or to Cleveland, they went to Cleveland. Just like the dreams of all the sports fans there. They did. They just fucking died. A slow, miserable death. And I'm like, that franchise just died out. Nobody bought it and went nowhere. It just went to Cleveland and fucking died. So for the longest time, the only game in town I'll fucking west was the king's every fucking road trip they had was like at least a three, four hour fucking Denver didn't have a team.

Speaker 1:          00:32:40       Vancouver didn't have a team. Edmonton, Calgary, they had nothing. They were just out there by themselves, you know, basically fucking whatever actresses couldn't bang. A Los Angeles dodger are an la ramp. That's basically, they got sloppy thirds. That's what was going on. So anyways, yeah, we lost. So, uh, graduations to the flyers and the fucking red wings. There was two spots left, t three teams vying for it. And uh, we didn't get in and like clockwork, the day after, we don't get in. What Boston sports writer who doesn't watch hockey do you think piled on immediately? And I as always calls for the wrong head to be chopped off. Good old Dan Shaughnessy the noodle headed [inaudible] himself. Who doesn't watch hockey, doesn't like hockey chimes in, something's gotta be done. It's time based on what Dan, all the hockey. You never fucking watch. Hello Julian. This was actually one of his finest coaching performances of the year of, I mean, of his career. They traded the entire fucking team away.

Speaker 1:          00:33:54       Basically they treat it was what they got rid of over the last few years. Tyler's Sagan, um, Johnny Boyd Shuck Doggie fucking fresh. They're fucking Milan. Lou Cheecha was just, I was like, we got nothing. We got nothing left. I now know looking Marshawn, we got Bergie was still had shower shower's older now, but basically coos can do anybody fucking watches hockey. Looked at the Bruins who was like, you know what, this is a rebuilding year and all the way up to like mid March. Clo Julian had this, this rebuilding year team was the third seat. Everybody was bunched together. We hit a bad patch, you know, went out West tough fucking run. We lost some games and next thing you know, we were fighting for the playoff lives as they say. And we didn't win. I mean, I mean, I don't know if you get, I would get, if anybody's heads going to get chopped off, you chop the head off whoever made all those fucking trades. But you know the bottom line is the guy who made the first half of those already got his head chopped off and then you got, was it Michael O'connell? You've got to give this guy a chance,

Speaker 1:          00:35:02       right? You can't just go one and done a fucked up with deputy. They just cave Clo Julian of fucking watch. We're having the most Vic, the most wins ever have any Bruins coach. He got us our first fucking Stanley Cup in like, what was it? Almost 40 years and then what? A couple of years later, he doesn't, not a coach hockey anymore.

Speaker 2:          00:35:25       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:35:25       Why is it time Dan Shaughnessy why is it time? Cause it's too early in the baseball season. He got nothing to write about his guys forever calling for somebodies head. You know what Dan, you don't want to take, it's time for you to do. It's time for you to stop writing about hockey or maybe watching maybe fucking five games at a goddamn season. Unfuckable fuck that guy. I swear to God at the end of the day, I think he's from New York City. The way he just tries to pull apart fucking teams. It's unbelievable. You know what I mean? He's like somebody with some mob guys Goumarre that they ended up having a whack, cause she can't keep her fucking mouth shut. Oh Jesus. Pillco wheezy on the guy's just trying to sell. So fuckin pay bus. Um, I don't really hate Dan Shaughnessy. I don't know the guy, but I can tell you right now, uh, he's one of the few people that looks less athletic than me anyways. Any who as I as I was talking about earlier, um, I've been doing the whole fucking clean living thing since I got back from a yet another lost bachelor party. Weekend Slash standup dates run with, uh, with my buddies. Yeah.

Speaker 4:          00:36:37       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:36:39       First he and Bart. Nick and a, so this whole week, no booze, no porn, no cigars, nothing. I got the cigar. I think I got that thing on, on fucking lockdown.

Speaker 4:          00:36:51       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:36:52       I don't have them in my house. I think about do, I don't think about doing it as much and I only had one cigar in March and I'm gonna try to just have one this month, although, um,

Speaker 4:          00:37:04       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:37:05       Yeah. Look, I'm thinking about only having one and then I'm also thinking about having a fucking cigar night over here. I might do that because I have like fucking,

Speaker 4:          00:37:15       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:37:15       I Dunno about 10 cigar friends. Unless you smoke cigars, you don't know what that means. But it's just people that call a, I'm going to smoke. You want to come by, right. So all of a sudden I have 10 opportunities a month. People call me a, come on man, come by and smoke and smoke. And next thing you know you smoked in like seven, eight, nine, 10 of them. So I'm going to invite all of them over to my house the same fucking night and I'll smoke one cigar with all 10 of them rather than smoking one each with 10 individuals. How does that math work? Right? Then I'll create a shell company. Um,

Speaker 4:          00:37:47       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:37:48       So anyways, so I bought this time magazine on watch an Internet porn and how it's fucking up kids like the, you know, the amount of shit that they see before they even get their first fucking hand job. It turns them into light, these fucking sociopath. And I got to admit reading some of the articles, like I could relate to a lot of the shit that was going on. So I'm really just going to fucking going to try to stop that cold Turkey. You know, I got to stop looking at that shit. Fuck, I'm sorry. See this clean lists. What clean live does free at 10 30 at night. I'm fucking Yani all ready to go to bed right now. Get my fucking jam jams and here and here. I am supposed to be there for you. You guys are sitting there at work. The last fucking thing you need. You probably already had a doughnut. You're going to sick a sugar crash here in a minute. And here I am, young in a on Ya. Um,

Speaker 4:          00:38:39       so

Speaker 1:          00:38:40       what else can I talk about here? Oh yeah, clean living. If you try and have some clean living, do not watch the Lemmy documentary, which I just watched for the second time. Um, makes you want to have a couple of drinks cause you like, look how long that guy fucking lift all this shit that he did. You know.

Speaker 1:          00:38:59       Fuck you're good. All right, 39 minutes in. I could do the last 21 minutes here without yachting. Here we go. Here we go. All right. Um, by the way, I don't for a people out there, uh, you know, I mentioned some of the helicopter shit. I did. I did. I tell you I finally did that, that Solo flight that I wanted to do from long beach and I, I went through the Bravo airspace with the plane's taking off over you. You know, at lax, came right around, looked at the house, flew over the fucking house that they, uh, the horses head from Godfather right down sunset over to El Monte and then back to, um, oh, I did tell you that because that's when I saw the old guy fall off the fucking scooter. I'm sorry. I thought, I didn't think that I told you that one. I was just thinking about that shit the other day. Of course my fucking headphones go out and what they would have fucking, I knew it. I fucking knew it. I knew that was gonna happen. Um, so anyways, I was at the comedy store on Saturday night and I was trying out this, uh, this new chunk that I've been fucking with for the last couple of months. And I finally got it down. I said it, it's perfect as I could say it. Of course I didn't, I didn't fucking know I didn't tape. Of course I didn't tape. Why would I take that would've been the smart thing to do, but whatever I said it, so I'll get it, I'll get it back. And, um,

Speaker 1:          00:40:24       I felt fucking great about it. And then today I got text messages from two different comedians telling me that they love the new shit that I was doing. It, it just, I just made my fucking day. So I'm really excited about, uh, getting that shit together because I want to do another special this year. And, um, I got some stuff on my act. That's funny, but I just feel like the topics have been done before so much try to like, you know, you know, push that shit to the wayside. Maybe that'll just be on the, some of those topics. We'll just be on like the, uh, when I released the vinyl of the Madison Square Garden Show, I'll just keep them on that one. There'll be some extra jokes that won't be the same material. I don't know. I'm just excited about the, uh, the next few months, how that Shit's going to turn out.

Speaker 1:          00:41:12       But, uh, before we get into the questions this week, everybody, I have to give a shout out to rogue fitness, whoever dental was listening to the podcast. I was breaking that balls. You know, I'm making a gym. I'm paying somebody to build a gym for me out my garage, a little gym there in the back. And I got all my shit through rogue fitness. They just had the best shit out there. And I was just joking with them that, uh, you know, how dare you not send me Free Shit. I didn't even ask him for it. He just immediately came to the podcast breaking the fucking balls and they listened to the one where there was me and Nia, Nia told me to get the regular looking weights, just the ones that look like iron or whatever. And I wanted the, I wanted the color for once and she thought that they were corny.

Speaker 1:          00:41:52       So all of a sudden I just got this shipment of these colorful weights and I was laughing going, Oh man, I must have fucked it up. I got the colorful ones. So I wrote them trying to ask how to send it back and they said no, we listened to the podcast and they sent me some free weight and they sent me a tee shirts. I, you know, rogue fitness. I was fucking around. You didn't have to do that. You guys are solid man. And I'm, I can't wait to uh, you know, use your, your equipment cause it's, you know, it's great. Made in the USA. All good stuff. Oh look who's here. The busy body. The lovely Nia. Did you get some Thai food? Yes. Did you grab a mic or do you want to eat? Do you want to eat? I got another, uh, 17 minutes here. 17 minutes to Mike's were in the closet. Oh, why don't you, why don't you sit down and help me through with the questions.

Speaker 1:          00:42:45       Why do I hook it up? Cause I am, I am a, I'm actively doing the podcast right now actively. Oh, Jesus. You know, if he going to be in a mood like that. Oh Geez. Is What's that? You just walked out on me anyways. All right, well I'm going to start reading the first one then. You don't care. All right. Oh, by the way, you know something, I was taking my dog out for a walk today. You know, we were walking up into the park there and this is before she puked and I decided to turn around and come home. She started nowhere. She started yakking. Uh, made me feel bad. I was like, Jesus, I hope it wasn't something I did. It wasn't hot out or anything. Um, another Yale has a very sensitive stomach. Well, another fucking group of people come up the second they get to the end of the park, they just fucking don't say what park.

Speaker 1:          00:43:41       They go to the fucking park and they fucking take the leashes off the fucking dogs come right up to my dog. And they're like, yeah, no worries. Don't worry. She's friendly, she's friendly. It's like, my dog isn't my dog. My dog is ignores other dogs. It chills and then we're like, when you are bugging my dog, it doesn't go. It never has the, hey, can you do me a favor? Can you knock it off? It immediately just grabs you. Like, remember Friday the 13th when Jason was under the Cot and grabbed that dude's head and reached up, I guess it was the chicken, the first one. I met a dog tonight who just didn't like anybody and I've, but I realized quickly what it was his owner was holding him and anytime anyone came towards the honor, like, oh, hey, oh, what a cute dog. The dog was stark rally and I, and it's so funny because he said to one of the people, oh, pet him. And I'm like, no, your dog isn't, doesn't want to be pet.

Speaker 5:          00:44:32       It growls at everybody. And I think the dog was protecting the owner. So anytime, you know, like I said, anyone that came towards him, he started growling, but right. He was so clueless that he was like, oh he's fine, just pet him. And I'm like no, no, you can't pet the dog. If it's ground at people. I cannot judge him. Our dogs, a psycho dog went to bite me like it actually kind of like put, it's the, its walked across the fucking Bro. I went over and it put its, it's put my finger in between its teeth and didn't chomp down. But it was, I was yes, but it was a biting behavior. So a little dog man with little dogs with people. They'd be riding around in convertibles, you know, like a corvette or some shit. All right, let's, let's leave in 11 minutes. All right. So can you want to do one, one question? Yeah, let's do it.

Speaker 1:          00:45:23       All right, job. Hey Billy. Baret um, I, we're, I'm working part time job and I have a problem. Let me see if there's a relationship one here.

Speaker 5:          00:45:32       Why can't old boyfriend, can I not be involved in the the job one? Well, I just feel like I always give the guy advice. Well, maybe it's time to shake it up a little bit less. So it's trying to do, have you given some lady advice on some relationship? Huh?

Speaker 1:          00:45:50       Oh God. Are you going to go on a feminist rant here? You know women can answer other fucking questions too, you know? Yeah. All right, let's get another question that doesn't have to do with relationships. Hey, you know, I'm trying to give you a nice softball here in front of the lob it over the fucking place. A fucking softball. Anything Person Rolling your head? Here we go. When all reality show me there. All right. I'm working a part time job and I have a problem related to it. All right. The job is I work at a fucking ice cream. It's at an ice cream place in my town and the second time I worked there a while back, I had a godawful shift. I didn't have all the kinks of the job worked yet and I was working with someone I didn't know, which made me more nervous. The night quickly became, uh, you know this word Koffka esque parade. Who's calm? Who's that?

Speaker 5:          00:46:44       Oh No, he's a writer. Is he a philosopher?

Speaker 1:          00:46:49       I'm going to have a particular political view. I think he died in a boating accident.

Speaker 5:          00:46:53       Whatever. Mommy, Inez. Kafkaesque. Joseph Kafka. I think he's a one of those. He's like a philosopher. J Lo no, four. She goes on tour. I'm not going to lie and say I know exactly. Who can we Google it though? I really feel like it's a Joseph Kafka.

Speaker 1:          00:47:12       We just read the fucking question. Oh, right. Okay. The night quickly became a Kafka as parade of a horrific errors. I screwed up, orders, stock things wrong, et Cetera, and by the end of the night, my coworker was audibly and visibly disgusted with me and she should have been

Speaker 5:          00:47:29       John's Kafka. Okay. Sorry. Chairman. Language writer of novels and short stories. Who is? Oh my God. He died the day after my birthday and therein lies the tragedy. All right. Here we go. All right. Put down your phone. Try to align what car I was going to say. It's surreal. I was right. Yes. I'm not entertaining. Sorry. Entertaining for people. Kafka ask elements often appear in existential works, but the term has transcended the literary realm to apply to real life occurrences in situations that are in comprehensively complex, bizarre or a logical where we go Franz Kafka. All right. Okay. Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:48:17       All right. So the ladies or the lady is, was upset with him and he's saying, you know, audibly and visibly disgusted with me and she should have been okay. She's in college and I'm in high school so luckily I never had to work with her again after the summer was over and she went back to her classes. But even as recently as spring break, I've heard she's still talking shit about me.

Speaker 5:          00:48:40       Yeah. Oh, you heard this all the way back. She's at some college. How did you hear that? Yeah, they were all on the Facebook. Um, oh Grandpa, I love saying the Huh?

Do you care what she thinks is that bad now?

Speaker 5:          00:51:46       Yes. What is spiking has to do with it. Does have confidence in yourself and do the job. Also, this is, this is a high school person that's writing in.

Speaker 1:          00:51:56       This is somebody who's making ice cream cones and he's scared out of his mind about some woman who is not easy and he's not even fucking, he doesn't want to ask her out. What is the problem? She's going to yell at you about the way you put the fucking

Speaker 5:          00:52:07       cherries or something because as a job and he's in, you know, worried about how he's going to perceive you. Remember what it was like to be at that age where you know every little thing you know means disaster and the bigger picture. Oh, so is he, cause it's just a job a little bit. Yeah. I think you're worried a little too much about nothing. Just do your job, do your thing, don't even worry about it. And there's plenty of other jobs out there by the way, and he should just be totally, yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:52:35       Cocky. Which she comes in.

Speaker 5:          00:52:37       What up bitch? Yeah, I'm sure that'll go over real well. Float. Do [inaudible] kiss with the little piece side? No, no honey. Yeah. Ice Cream had to decide

Speaker 1:          00:52:55       we pussy or nothing. Jesus Christ pushing all the chips. And this is the world series of poker. All right. Hey there, Billy boy. I'm on. I'm a new listener to your podcast, but a long time fan of you stand up. I was wondering if you could help me out with it. A dilemma I'm facing. So my weed dealer put the moves on me. My last time I was at her place. Uh, nothing came of it, but I could tell she was trying to get me to fucker until now. I thought it was weird that she began to me pot for practically. Yeah, nothing. Wow. She's cool. And I've hung out with her at her place many times to just smoke weed, just, just as well. I'm single, so I have no problem getting some strange pussy that falls into my lap. The problem is that she's a very heavy, broad, and completely unattractive. Oh, Gigi Age. But she sells the best weed in the area. Dude, this is fucking, this has all the makings of the great first 10 pages of a script. We've established who the characters are. Oh yeah. Now we've got the Rabo super far with this premise.

Speaker 3:          00:54:03       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:54:04       Oh God. You know what? You know what I love. You know what I love to do? You know that guy can help it. You know that guys just want to fuck you. Women know that you use it to your advantage to get shit. And then when we admit that that's what we want to do. You look though, oh my God, I really, someone would tell a story about a guy who was getting thrown pussy left and right and doesn't know what to do with it. And it's like a coming of age and I'm sure he's also fighting with his friends a little bit about like, what dorm are you going to stay in? And it's just hilarious.

Speaker 3:          00:54:35       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:54:35       He's got this heavy broad that he's not attracted to. Who's this fucking weed dealer? Yeah. She's got the best weed. Yeah. Knows he wants, she wants to fuck them. What was the rest of the story? Does he want it? This is a fuck. Come on. Seth Rogan would crush this.

Speaker 3:          00:54:50       Hmm.

Speaker 1:          00:54:52       Ah, you are in it. You know what? You're hungry. You're like him. When that snickers commercial, I don't know who you are, where Seth Rogan would write a phenomenal transcendent script that Jonah Hill would act out and it would just be like, wow, is this what it's like? What is wrong with you?

Speaker 3:          00:55:09       Huh?

Speaker 1:          00:55:10       I like all of those people and I like those movies. You don't like hot tub, Chubby and awkward and not know what to do with your life. Oh, what are you? Why are you being a jerk? I don't know. You're being a jerk, right? Yeah. You're hungry. I am being a little bit of a generic, apologized to Seth Rogan. I'm also okay. Yeah, you are. You're a little out of sorts here. Okay. All right. You let you burn burning bridges in this town, Sweetie. Let me tell you something. Those bridges don't come back, but she sells the best weed in the area I don't want. All right? I don't want to not fucker and then ever cut me off, but at the same time I feel that I, if I do fucker then I'm no better than an addicted crack whore doing a line off some fat guy's Dick. Maybe. Uh, so guess what, when it comes down to what do I fuck my ugly drug dealer for? [inaudible] oh my God. What do I just question or do I just find a new dealer was super urban. Pay More money. Thanks. Hope all is well with you ginger. Fuck. Cause she had ginger. Fuck. Um,

Speaker 3:          00:56:17       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:56:18       Have you ever heard the expression don't shit where you eat?

Speaker 3:          00:56:21       Yeah. Don't fuck your weed dealer.

Speaker 5:          00:56:24       Yeah. Don't just don't fucker. This is a business relationship. Keep it business like lie and started talking about how we as a girlfriend. No, just buy weed from her and like just let it be business. Yes. Stop Smoking with them. And also like, I mean maybe she's desperate for your cock, but maybe you're like reading into it. She might be trying to fuck you and the next dude, so she's, she's, she's a drug dealer. She's hustling. She's hustling for like customers. She's hustling for Dick. Like don't get excited. You know you're not the only one bra. So you think, yeah, but she's given

Speaker 1:          00:57:00       away for next to nothing. If she does that, she's not gonna make any money.

Speaker 5:          00:57:04       True. She's making it another way is, I dunno, I feel like just don't fuck your weed dealer. That just sounds like a disaster written all over it or get yourself a really good connect. Now have that in your back pocket. So if you do decide that the only reason why you would fuck your weed dealer is if you actually want to fuck her. Not because you're so desperate for the best we'd ever have. You really had the best weed and like your entire city. Probably not so calm down. Don't matter dealer. Uh Huh.

Speaker 1:          00:57:35       I mean, you know, you kind of enter the habit. You're not just going, hey, can I get a hit off that when you fucking go in there week after week to the point that the [inaudible]

Speaker 5:          00:57:43       weed dealers are a dime a dozen though, there's, it's not like a specialty, but just say this fucking chick is the vcs buying so much weed off. If she's developing feelings for, she's not, he might be cute. Jesus, you might have a little crush, but like it's not that. It's, my point is it's not that serious. Don't fuck your weed dealer unless you want to have a problem with your weed dealer and you didn't want to cheat. You don't want to have a problem. Trust me. We dealer wants to fuck one of her customers. Course. I completely believe it. I'm just saying just don't, don't go there. It's not worth it. That's my bottom line. She's usually not this grumpy. You guys all right. The grumpy old boyfriend, texts wife.

Speaker 1:          00:58:27       Oh, Billy cheese balls. Where'd that come from? I don't know. It just fucking make up names for me. Oh, okay. All right. Very happily married for 25 years to the hottest wife and mother of our three sons. She's in spectacular shape and beautiful while on vacation in palm springs.

Speaker 5:          00:58:42       Bang. Right. Just scape herself in shape. Yeah. We're visual animals. We're visual animals. I know

Speaker 1:          00:58:54       there's a reason why all those gay guys are walking around with six packs because they know what they're trying to attract.

Speaker 5:          00:59:00       Yeah. Don't bring the gaze into this. Do you think all those gay guys wanting to go to the gym that much? They have to.

Speaker 1:          00:59:07       If they don't, that's the end of the Dick Train and they know it. They know it. All right. So anyways, uh, while on vacation in Palm Springs, I caught a glimpse of her phone screen and saw a text from PB. Pb was asking, how's the weather? So I asked her who PB is after a little persuasion. She replied, it's Dave. Dave is a boyfriend from her high school years and he is a former fiance. This is awful. She promised it was nothing. I asked if they had seen each other underneath a different name though. Yeah. That's pretty suspect when you have the presence name saved under an alias. The B was PB mean. Wait, there's a penis. Brilliant. Brilliant Penis. She's dyslexic. Penis, Babe. Penis, Pussy Banger. Maybe. I'm sure it's something between the three. It was a capital p and then a lowercase B. I don't know why he did it. All right. If you guys have any suggestions what PB would stand for? Come on. What social media is all about? It goes, uh, she promised it was nothing. I asked if, if they had seen each other or slept together. She said, no, I believe her.

Speaker 1:          01:00:41       Okay. Oh, Jesus. It's a pharmacy up fiance. Does he mean now? I guess now or maybe. I just want to believe her. She is otherwise a very honest person. Well, I sent Dave a text and here's what I said. Oh, beautiful. I'm only going to say this once. You're nothing but a sleazy cock sucker. You've crossed the line of decency. Go Fuck Yourself. Or better yet go choke to death on some poor. Something that he's Dick. Wait, what? So it's a, it's a homophobic. He was upset. Okay. Never communicate with my wife, capital letters ever. If you pursuer in any way, I'll cut your dick off with a rusty saw blade and shove it down your throat. I hope you're getting the message here. His reply understood. This is the less text name and numbered deleted. My question to you is, was I harsh enough with team and I'm not sure what to do with Bob. My wife, she deleted him from our context and she said she has no need to ever communicate with him again. What are your thoughts?

Speaker 3:          01:01:52       Wow,

Speaker 1:          01:01:54       I think you need to let it be then. I mean I that was, I have to say that was masterful. All that text that he sent to PB, Aka Dave. I think he got the message with that one now. What do you think? Uh, so do you think she banged him? No, she was probably sending, flirting, borderline inappropriate text messages.

Speaker 5:          01:02:21       No ebay years. Those beautiful the day I took you to prom. Like that type of shit.

Speaker 1:          01:02:27       Why are you, why we went on the left side than that? I don't fucking know. I, the recent Bill Barr?

Speaker 5:          01:02:36       Probably what it said some like that's what you're making because you know how you are. You probably would've said some inappropriate shit over text. I mean that's what, yeah. Is that what texting is? It's what is, how do I, how do I, how do I get to the texting to us? Well, lose weight. How texting works. All right. Advice from a, for a fellow ginger. Oh, moving right. Moving right along. Right along fellow ginger from Finland

Speaker 1:          01:03:05       here. I have a decision to make and would appreciate some advice from a wise and experienced man like you. Ever since I was a kid. Oh, you've just every fucking thing. Ever since I was a kid, I've wanted to be an airline pilot. I'm 19 years old and I'm graduating from high school in December. Yes. Here we finish high school later.

Speaker 5:          01:03:27       I was just going to say, is that when they graduate from high school and Finland? Yeah. Then you

Speaker 1:          01:03:32       guys in Mirka. Alright. I've, I have till the end of the year to decide what I want to study. I've always had a plan after high school. I would want to, uh, go to a flight academy and become a pilot. But now I've started to question if that's what I really want to do for a living living. I mean an airline pilot is an incredible job, absolutely love flying and we get to travel a bunch of seal kinds of amazing places, et Cetera. Plus I would get to the sun every day without burning my Nordic ultra pasty, pasty skin. Um, the captain makes six figures, which is plenty enough for me since I'm not into money. My only problem with being a pilot is that I would never be completely free, meaning that for the rest of my life working for some other douchebag, uh, would, would decide for me when I can come to work and where I can fly.

Speaker 1:          01:04:24       The idea of being tied up to a company and having some con making all the decisions for me scares the shit out of me when I'm older. I want to be able to do things on an impulse without asking permission from, uh, some capital letters, other men also pilots. But you're just over there taking pictures of shit. And you, um, also pilots spent a lot of time away from home and someday when I start a family and have kids, I want to spend as much time as possible with them. So that could be a problem as well. Flying planes for living would be a dream job, but we'd get in the way of my other dream of being completely my own man and free. What do you think? Should I go study something else? No. What you should do is still be into the aviation thing.

Speaker 1:          01:05:05       You just figure out a way to do what you want to do within aviation. Okay. I will equate it to the job that I have. I am a standup comedian, which opens up all these doors into the entertainment world, which a lot of them you think you want to run through until you get to the other side. And then you realize what you're talking about is like, holy fuck, I thought I had the world by the balls. If I got this, I thought I would be the pimp. And then you realize that you're actually the whore. So you have to, um, what I would do if I was you is I would still go to flight school. I would learn how to fly. And then what I would do is rather than going flying for some commercial airline, there's gotta be some other cool shit that you can do, like flying for site, seeing tours.

Speaker 1:          01:05:52       You're not into money, right? Maybe you do that. Maybe you ended up having that business and other people fly for you and you get to fly around. Um, what other jobs are they? There's fighting forest fires and you know, you do that and like helicopters and planes and that type of shit. Yeah. Um, listen, just by being a pilot already, you got some sort of renegade spirit in your, so I'm sure there's plenty of fucking jobs that you can get in aviation. I think it pretty much any job there's, there's a way to be in the matrix and then there's a way to be outside. Like, you know, he's a renegade, that one, you know, don't get tied down with that guy. You can definitely do it. Right. What do you think? Yeah. So he should still be a pilot to do you love to fly.

Speaker 1:          01:06:40       It's what you want to do. Um, but you know, there's, there's all kinds of shit you can fly for fucking airline. Make your money and then leave and then go do something else. Like start your own business. I Dunno, you're laughing at me right now. He's 19. He's got the whole worry he's got, he's got the world by the fucking short hairs and all. Sounds it all sounds good. I was listening to a podcast from wild back then. You were shitting on the NFL having games in London. He said those games a huge things for us. European football fans. And believe it or not, there are tons of football fans here in Europe. Uh, the Games always sell out and I fell. Football sells out there. Who knows? All right, here's new. Who, whose, here's the last one. I'm stuttering here. Okay. Guess what? I just time traveled in the podcast.

Speaker 1:          01:07:26       Let me give you a second to just wrap your head around this because I know it's always weird when this happens.

The last question that I actually did with the lovely Nia and now we're fucking wage gap myth. Uh Oh, did this spark a debate a deal? Dear Billy Baru, I was one of the fortunate and audience members of your epic terrorist performance.

Speaker 1:          01:12:57       You crushed it. My opinion. Thank you very much. He said the wage gap statistic. Um, he said I wanted to bunk a myth for you. The wage gap statistic. You know, this is thing right now that they say that a woman gets paid less 79 cents less to do the exact same job is a guy which, you know, my opinion is fucked up. The job should pay what should pay. Right? So this guy says the wage gap statistic that you hear about all the time is simply the average earnings of men and women working full time. It does not take into account different job positions, hours worked, or different jobs. It has nothing to do with the same work. It has nothing to do with discrimination. In 1963, the supreme court passed the equal pay act, which makes it illegal to pay different wages for the same job.

Speaker 1:          01:13:41       If you still don't buy that, then consider this. If a company could legally play pay women less money, do you think those greedy Kuntz would ever hire a man? Some decent points there. Uh, once I pulled this wage gap threat thread, a whole bunch of other feminists myths started to unravel, but I just wanted to shine a light on this topic. Well, okay, lets you know, I'll have to look all of that up. I never looked up the equal pay act, but um, if they're still able to make the numbers work then wouldn't that say, did guys get the better high paying jobs then done then does it become that? I'm just asking. All right. Um, that's what I would guess. So why don't know. Evidently, I have some readings to do and I think a lot of feminists do too, that just jump on the bandwagon and I'll look up the equal pay act.

Speaker 4:          01:14:30       MMM.

Speaker 1:          01:14:32       I don't know who the fuck knows. I mean, one of the dumbest fucking ways to get somebody to listen to your goddamn opinion is to just sit there and be like, you got it better than us. You're life is fucking easy. That immediately puts the other side going, like, you know, an f fuck you. Fuck you and your procedure. You know, my fucking life. Cz, I just dealt with this, this, this, and this. You know, it just puts people into that mindset.

Speaker 4:          01:14:53       MMM.

Speaker 1:          01:14:55       I Dunno if that whole fucking yelling and screaming and shit. You know, believe me as a yeller and Screamer, I know it doesn't make people listen to you. It just makes you, people just go, oh my God, I want to get away from this person, or that person's a fucking lunatic. That's been my experience trying to convey ideas since I was a little orange, had a child.

Speaker 4:          01:15:17       MMM.

Speaker 1:          01:15:18       I don't know what's going on. Okay. At the end of the day, people should, the job should pay what the job pays and the best person should get it, but sadly that is never going to happen because there's always going to be the boss's son. There's always going to be the hot chick. There's always going to be the racist, the homophobe, the person who comes in with a southern accent, you're up north or vice versa, and somebody mentally still fighting the war. I think southern people are stupid. You can't. The only way to take the human element out of it is to gradually, slowly but surely dumbed down, human beings make everything automated and you slowly replaced them with free thinking robots, which is basically what's going to happen. By free thinking. I mean they agree with the upper 1% and not even the upper 1% the upper 1% of the 1% that doesn't even show up, you know?

Speaker 4:          01:16:09       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:16:09       There's a lot of, remember all the blue blood money and everybody kind of knew how much money they had and now they all say that, oh they gave away a lot. You know, the rocker fellows or you know, they're, they're fortunate is, and what it's worth, they use to be the Vanderbilts that are only worth like $75 million. Now. I mean, that's, I don't know, there's all these stories out there that there's families that are so fucking big and powerful. They are above any sort of borders and they fucking, you know, when they traveled by yacht, it's only like, it's like their little navy and they just, I love conspiracy theory and they just float around. They pull up to the dock and the comp countries just come out and give them bags of gold and then they just disappear. It's like waterworld except you know, without the, uh, you know, I don't know if they still have all the amenities cause the world hasn't flooded over yet. Does that make any sense? You know, I think that's as good a spot to stop sending.

Speaker 1:          01:17:04       Uh, my apologies for a fucking up the podcast this week. Um, you guys have a nice couple of fucking days and can I end on some more drum nerd shit. I told you my, uh, drum teachers taking me through, um, that sting album, 10 summers tales of, of that has the great Vinnie call Uda on it and how they played in all these odd times, but they wanted to imply for four time and he finally taught me on that seven days, which is in five, which I love. Uh, he finally wrote out what he was doing on the high hat, which is basically he's playing that it's four, four against five. He's playing five underneath, but he's implying four in the high yet and a off to all these fucking years of trying to figure out how to do it. He finally, he just wrote out one line of it and now it makes sense.

Speaker 1:          01:17:50       Um, to me, and it's basically on the high hat. I just still count and five, but you just count, you know, underneath it. If you listen to what you're counting. One, two, three, four, five, one, two, three, four, five. [inaudible]. One Dent that fucking shit. But on top, how it works for me is you just, you just, I still counted five. I just, you're thrown in. He counted is like eighth notes. So one and two and three and four and five and one and two and three and four and five. And the first time through Ux sent one, three and five and the second time through you accent too in four. Try that. That's the way I've been doing it. Now granted, this is massively filtered down from a professional drummer to a standup comedian who cannot read out loud. Um, all right, that's it. Go fuck yourselves. I'll talk to you on Thursday. L check yet.
