Speaker 1:          00:00:01       Hey, what's going on? It's bill burr and it's the Monday morning podcast from Monday.

Speaker 2:          00:00:07       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:00:09       What is it? June 18th, 2010. Yeah, I know. I know. I know. I before you even fucking start. I know. I know. It's Tuesday the 19th. I know.

Speaker 2:          00:00:24       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:00:24       Okay. What's the matter? You don't know what happened? Don't you follow me on Twitter? Um, I apologize for being a day late, sort of, you know, I apologize. That date to go really doesn't give a shit or just banged your sister. Oh, I didn't know. Oh, that was your sister dude. I didn't see a full like fucking six months. She changed all right.

Speaker 2:          00:00:48       MMM,

Speaker 1:          00:00:50       no, I was doing, I was doing a show in Chicago, Chicago and uh, you know, got out late and everything and not, I didn't bring any of my shit with me, so I was already going to do a halfassed one. As far as the sound. I was just going to record it on my iPhone man. And, um, and then, I don't know, I ended up fucking going out until like four 30 in the morning and then my flight was at 12th. So you do the math. Okay. I'm sorry. I partied last, uh, Sunday night. Like, you know, like me and my friends successfully robbed a casino, you know, like in the end of sexy beast, you know, when they robbed it successful and everybody's laughing in a fucking, you know, whatever, some sort of old pub or steakhouse, cigars, the whole damn thing. Just, I was having a great time. I'm going, I ain't gonna lie to you. I completely forgot that I had to do the podcast completely. 100% for God.

Speaker 2:          00:01:52       You know.

Speaker 1:          00:01:54       Sorry, it's not my fault. I've been jet setting.

Speaker 1:          00:02:01       No, I had a great weekend. I started off in San Jose. I'm not trying to make you guys jealous in San Jose, California right there. You guys ought to just shut this whole podcast off just out of pure envy. You know, I don't know if you guys are fans of the price is right, but many times during the showcase showdown, uh, one of the, the will, the final gifts to make one of those housewives soccer moms lose their mind is an all expense paid trip to San Jose, California. Granted, it is the first showcase. It's not the second one. Second one I think is to Fresno.

Speaker 2:          00:02:34       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:02:36       Yeah. Went to San Jose and a, it's slowly getting better. Ooh, job. Things are going to get easier. San Jose slowly turning it around. Every time I come there it's a little less scary, or at least it feels a little less weird, you know? And then like Saturday is the weirdest day when you work San Jose because San Jose is one of those classic cities where,

Speaker 3:          00:03:00       um, you know, there's all kinds of people until the end of the workday. And the second the workday ends like around five, everybody just gets the fuck out of town and then all of a sudden you can't, you can't even get a God damn dinner anywhere. Everything's closed. Everybody's such close and like going in those old fucking westerns when some bad ass is coming to town and everybody's pulling down their curtains closed for business. That's basically what it feels like. Um, but during the day, there's people walking around to beautiful city. They got a little Choo Choo train that goes up and down the driveway, you know, and, um, it's just for people who've never been to San Jose, the people that I feel bad for that is sitting somewhere in a job that they don't like dreaming of going to San Jose, California, a little pictures of Sj as j town or whatever the fuck they call it.

Speaker 3:          00:03:51       All around your little office cubicle. Maybe, maybe your workstation out in the warehouse, maybe, maybe, maybe you drive for a living. You got those up on the dashboard, you know, ways pounded down, um, Saturdays, the weirdest day because nobody comes in even during the day. So you're walking around the city with skyscrapers and there's literally nobody there. You feel like you're in the fucking walking dead. It's the only way to describe it. But, uh, but then at the Improv, the shows were packed out. So I want to thank everyone who came down. Um, I worked with Kevin Shea, Kevin Shay, if you guys haven't seen him, he's fucking hilarious. Totally original and hope you guys realize that by the way. And I don't bring any fucking cupcakes on the road. You know, some headliners, you know, they'll go out and they go out with some, some fucking weak person in front of them just so they look even better.

Speaker 3:          00:04:47       That's not the way I do it. All right? I actually bring out somebody who's funny. We'd be pat myself on the back now. You know what it is. I can't stand, I can't stand watch. I can't withstand working with somebody. Sucks. That's what it really is. It really has nothing to do with the crowd. All right, let's get to the truth to this day. You Go, it does. I can't, you know, because when they, when somebody sucks and having to listen to that act five times during the fucking week, um, I can't even tell you what the hell it does to you. And then they always end up closing on the same fucking bit. And I dunno. And the bits awful and it's killing because they're, I don't know. I don't know doing something. I don't know what the fuck it is. Some sort of standup trick and it makes me hate them. So what I do is I, I try to bury myself in the bowels of the clubs so I don't have to hear a word of their act. But no matter how much I do that, I still have to listen to the last minute of their, if their final joke cause I have to be ready to go on. So that's the real reason why I do it. All right, so there you go. So this is the fucking podcast. It is a day late. Um, and is always like, don't

Speaker 1:          00:05:58       have enough fucking hours in the day. I should just brought the stupid God damn mics are on the road. Where the fuck I didn't want to do it cause it was too heavy fucking pussy. Um, anyways, hey, I flew back from Chicago and I watched that, that John Carter from Mars movie or whatever the hell it's called, and he says, I'm John Carter from Virginia like 90 times. And it was actually Psi Phi. And I know recently on the Joe Rogan experience, I made fun of all those Scifi movies. You know, if you're stuck on a plane, it's not a bad movie, you know, you know what kills me is they always got to do that shit in those fucking, those Scifi movies where they always have to throw in those fucking awful invented words when somebody's arguing, everybody's speaking English, you know, speak in the goddamned king's English. You understand what everybody's saying?

Speaker 1:          00:06:49       I mean, if you went back 300 years in this fucking country, you wouldn't know what half the people were talking about with all day. He, this and that and fucking go with and come with. It's like, it'd be like reading the Bible. I can't make fucking heads and tails, tails of it. You know, read the Bible. It's like, am I still supposed to be going left to right here? Do I go left right to left cause it does, it makes, um, they always have those dumb lines. Like the gods of off guard will not have this. They go out of the way to like invent one word. What did the name of Marsupial is going on in here? They had one of those and I actually just fucking threw my headphones down. Then the Douche sit next to me looked over at me like what the fuck is your problem?

Speaker 1:          00:07:31       And I need you guys to come up with a name for this phenomenon. You ever been standing in a uh, in an airport terminal and there's some douche talking really loud on his cell phone. Of course you have. We all have, right? Which is big does giant too. There's a fat black dude from England, so he sounds like he's in, you know, lock stock in a smoking barrels, whatever the fuck it's called. And he's a tub of Shit, which is making me laugh cause everybody in Europe acts like they're fucking smart and in shape. You know, he looked like the fucking dude on a, you know, you know what he looked like?

Speaker 1:          00:08:11       You know that show, the Cleveland Brown show, you know his son. It's exactly what he looked like. He didn't talk like him, but he had the fucking round glasses, the whole God damn thing. That's what the fuck he looked like. And he's talk and he's fucking, he's fees, American fat. He Chicago fat. All right. But he's European so he still has to wear those tight fucking jeans. I Dunno why, I dunno what it is about Europe and fucking suffocate and your balls. But Europeans just, their genes cannot be fucking tight. They just cannot be fucking tight enough. They have, they have to fucking frame their package that God damn units look like fucking Han Solo's face when he gets frozen in that little piece of fucking carbon or whatever the fuck it was. Um, anyways, so he's running his stupid Yap. Yeah. Mike going over to Mel bone after that, going to go back over to fucking who gives a fuck, right.

Speaker 1:          00:09:08       Just talk and talk and talk and big stupid Chicago Bear fucking gut. You know, you know, when you get the creases on the side, you could stick mail in there. He's got those on the side, right? Offensive Lineman, fat. You know, he's got great footwork, dope, but look at his fucking belly and he says, run in his Goddamn Yap. You know, so I walk away from the guy, but he's one of these guys who takes a little stroll when he walked. So he keeps fucking walking over into my little area, right? So I'm like, Eh, you know, Bill, come out. Just fucking, don't be this. Don't be fucking screaming and yelling. Just fucking relax. And uh, what is the name of this phenomenon? I start loading the fucking plane. I get on the plane. He comes at fucking Douche, right? Still talking. Yeah, my yeah. Yeah. Good Day mate.

Speaker 1:          00:09:56       Yeah, yeah. All fucking bullshit. I know. Good day mates from fucking Australia before I get shit from fucking people from England. Y'all sound the same to me, right? So he comes walking up the aisle, he still running his fucking Yap and I'm just going out. Jesus Christ. All right. Only off, listen to this guy for another five, four, three, until he goes by and the motherfuckers in my row, what are the arts? You know, what are the fucking odds? God Damn 70 fucking rose. Not only is he in my row, he's sitting right next to me and he stays on the phone the whole fucking time. Yeah. Night. Yeah. Now, now teddy bears, watch intellij. Is this Stan right? The whole fucking time. Why he's waving. I'm not swearing the whole fucking time. Sit next to me running his god Damn Yap at this fat fucking stomach and the crease in the side.

Speaker 1:          00:10:46       And um, it's the only, this is the only a, the only props I will give this guys is, you know, he never seen, never said hello. We didn't speak the whole flight. I loved it. I loved that he was in as self involved is I. Um, and uh, last thing I wanted to hear, I would, last thing I wanted to do was start talking to him cause he already annoyed the shit out of me. And I know from experience that if I'm going to talk to somebody from another country, at some point they're going to shit on the United States. That's something that they like to do while calling us the ignorant Americans traveling around the world. You know, all knees and elbows, those motherfuckers come over here and it's just, you can't talk to him for more than fucking five minutes before they, they, they shit on America and I don't want to fucking understand it. You know? I would never do that. The only, the only way I would do that is if I was on stage in another country, just just for the fucking ridiculousness of it to start making fun of their fucking country. But if I was sitting on a plane, I would just be talking to you. You have a beautiful country, blah, blah, blah. I be a decent fucking guy.

Speaker 1:          00:11:56       Ah, fuck. Ah, Jesus Christ. The hell was I just going to [inaudible] remembered something in the middle of that. The hell was I talking about? Hang on a second. Let me think about this. Oh yeah, I remember what it was. Did I tell this story like fucking four months ago,

Speaker 1:          00:12:16       uh, pulled my big ass truck into this small spot, but there was nobody on the other side of me and I was fine right when I came out, somebody had pulled in and it was really tight as far as like on either side of my truck. And then I didn't have a lot of space to back out. So it was his fucking problem. I keep trying to back, you know, back out, come back in, back out, like inch my way. And so this fucking guy starts helping me out. I think he was from England and he's like, uh, you know, next time, why don't you do the UNAMERICAN thing in back in I fucking I.

Speaker 4:          00:12:46       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:12:46       It's like you can't even help me out of the spot without fucking nitpicking you fucking cunt. You know what? I'll listen to it from Australia, but England, the, the amount of shit that is going on in the world still because of those comments, the fact that they actually fucking give, he had the balls to give the United States shit the very least be like, hey, welcome to the party. Welcome. You guys are slowly catching up to us historically as the biggest fucking oppressive Douche bags on the planet. You want to come at me like that? Absolutely. But if you're gonna fucking come at me like you didn't do all this other bullshit out there, the fucking caste system in India and all that fucking crap. The shit that happened in Rwanda, you know,

Speaker 1:          00:13:30       that's all. I've got. Two examples. I don't know anything else. The Falkland Islands at Jesus, the ignorant Americans strikes again, but you know what I'm saying? If I actually read, I could fucking bury you guys in this argument. All right. With your jolly rancher flag, whatever the fuck you call it. Um, all right, thank God I don't have a gig coming up in England after that little thing, you know. Oh Jesus. I go, Oh gee, I've got a ton of shit for my fucking comments about, um, about hair metal last week. You know, dude, I wasn't saying it was all bad, but come on, this is what I should say. Okay. Look, disco music wasn't all bad.

Speaker 4:          00:14:15       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:14:16       Okay. The freak. Come on. You really think that's a bad fucking song you do? Oh, really? In what? In every rose has it's thorn is better. You want to go back and forth? Little tit for tat here. Fucking the frig blows any of those heavy metal ballads away. All right. I'm not saying Van Halen with David Lee Roth was to shit. All right. It's kind of like the Red Sox with Theo Epstein and Tito and all that. Now that they blew it up, we're going to be fucked. Who else? What else was great in the, there was a lot good fucking shit, but there was, I'm just, you know what the fuck I'm talking about?

Speaker 5:          00:14:55       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:14:56       Gimme an R, r o, c.K and what do you got rock and what are you going to do? Rock? You really? Can you come up with a disco song worse than that? That's your challenge for this weekend. If you can. I will shut the fuck up about this cause I'm not saying it was all bad. I'm not saying I didn't like iron maiden. I didn't say that. I didn't say that. I didn't like Metallica, which I actually didn't in the 80s. I thought that it was too hard. It was too hard for me. Okay. I had to stay in my borderline hair metal, little bit of Glam and uh oh, he's wearing jeans on stage. He's, he's breeze bringing it back. Little fucking music box that I was in. I missed out on a lot of good shit. All that new wave shit. Some of that stuff was good. Some of the talking head stuff early on, that was stuff was all good. I missed out on all of them, you know.

Speaker 5:          00:15:53       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:15:53       I liked their mainstream shit burning down the house. That's all I listened to. Um, let me see here. If I can get, Oh, what the hell is it? Let me see if I can get any, any comments of people telling me all these people giving me shit for my podcast being late.

Speaker 5:          00:16:12       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:16:12       The fuck dude. Hurry up with my free entertainment. Somebody drew a picture of a big Dick. That's nice.

Speaker 5:          00:16:20       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:16:21       MMM. Stop jerking off and give us the fucking podcast for fuck sakes. By the way, happy birthday. See what I do this. This is my crowd. This is what I facilitate. Oh, Jesus Christ. I can't find it anymore.

Speaker 5:          00:16:37       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:16:38       Look for all you fucking metal heads out there, all right. I wasn't saying, you know what the fuck I'm talking about. Okay. You can't tell me that you don't watch some of those old videos in it and, and, and they're not fucking, I'm like, I'm not. You know what? I'm not, I'm not letting you suck me back into this argument again. All right. I said what? I had to say. Okay. There's a lot of motley Crue shit. I did like some of the shit didn't hold up so much.

Speaker 5:          00:17:04       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:17:05       Do when that theater pain tour, when they will go fucking coming onstage looking like they sold Mary Kay cosmetics. I mean, come on, I get it. His fucking drum set when fucking all the way around. But come on, you can't tell me that even they don't look at it. You know what? Look at the fucking cover of theater of pain. Okay. I want you to hold that up and then think about my argument and then still tell me to go fuck myself. All right. And if you can pull that off, I will. All right, I will fuck off. All right. So anyways, you're listening to the Monday morning podcast. Everybody. I do one of these every single week. If you're, if you're new to the, uh, the podcast is what I do. I shit on things then people shit back on me. And then maybe in the end of it we, uh, we learned something. We have learned shit on this podcast. I haven't, we,

Speaker 5:          00:17:57       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:17:57       We've learned that debt sitting in a cubicle is not something that you dreamed up as a child and that you eventually want to get out of it. We've learned that I can't be funny without saying fuck and content. Every other word you guys. Uh, what else?

Speaker 5:          00:18:11       Yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:18:11       you know that I'm going to hell or I'm going into the ground one or the other, depending on whether you're religious or not. And you've also learned that there's no reason to go to the post office. Oh, he's slipping in a commercial.

Speaker 5:          00:18:24       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:18:25       Hey, listen, if you see, if you're still going to the post office, you're probably still listening to a theater of pain on cassette tape.

Speaker 1:          00:18:37       What stamps.com you ask, are you new to my podcast? And you haven't heard this commercial 40,000 times. This is what stamps.com with stamps.com is this wonderful websites that eliminates you ever having to go to the post office again. Okay? Think about all the things that happened when you go to the post office, the homeless guy holding the door. Like you can't open it yourself. Okay? And maybe you're a liberal and you want to give him some, you're going to give him some money, okay. But you know damn well you're not going to touch his hands. So you got to do that little throw. You've gotta do a little throat. You know what I do is I always try to throw it right at their fucking breast plate, right. Their chest and that way they can kind of do like a basket catch. That's what I do, you know, because I've tried to do the drop and thing.

Speaker 1:          00:19:20       They hand is so callous. It just fucking, it bounces right off of it. It's like you throw it against the fucking concrete and it falls in the ground and then they're crawling around trying to fucking pick up a quarter and you feel bad. You know? I would say about that time I gave that homeless guy some change as I was walking out of standup New York or the upper west side in New York City, I gave him some change. And, uh, as I was walking away, I just heard, fuck yeah. And I hear it, hear the sound of my change being thrown up with a fucking sidewalk. It was an angry drunk, you know, when he had his standards, it's like, give me some cash. Oh, go fuck yourself. And, um, I remember half the day I get mad and I think I laughed my ass off.

Speaker 1:          00:20:08       No, I think I got mad because I was by myself. So then it just kind of was him against me so I got upset. But if I've, I've, I was with somebody else, I would have had the left cause they would have been laughing at me anyway. stamps.com everybody, if you still go to the post office to send out letters and packages, the truth is you're wasting your time.

I'm always saying he's a bass, but I just like, I don't hear any, I don't know. It just, it doesn't get me. All right. So anyway, I got a lot of balls. Make Fun of the guy. You know, I can play more with one hand than I could dot four limbs and falling down a of stairs.

Did I use Tom fires the mean mean guy damn thing. Pick the bubble. Pappadeaux MMM. I didn't know. I just never gotten into that shit. Plus every time I would almost get into this shit, like just something else, they would do that. What would annoy me. I was watching, I was reading some sports article one time and they interviewed Getty, Getty Lee and a, evidently he's a blue Jay fan and they were playing the red sox and he sh he made fun of Red Sox fans and I was just, that was just a further fuck this guy. Um, I dunno dude. Uh, I like bottom better. I like guys like Steve Jordan. They don't play nearly as much, but a lot of those guys, it's very few of those guys that got of those giant fucking drum sets that are, um,

Speaker 5:          00:24:57       yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:24:57       that really blow me away. I actually, you know who I liked his, uh, Simon Phillips, he sat in with the WHO, um, on that tour I went to in 1989, you know, thinking I was seeing the WHO and then years later fucking pea towns and goes when they had a new tour. Yeah. That, that last toll mate, that wasn't the WHO, that, that was the who on ice. And that always pissed me off. It's like, really, we didn't say that when I was buying the fucking tickets. You can't, why don't you go do some more research on child pornography? Oh, Jesus. Bill.

Speaker 2:          00:25:28       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:25:31       But he's fucking was unreal on that. And uh,

Speaker 5:          00:25:36       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:25:37       I Dunno, I just recently just came across one of his Solos and, uh, it's not something that if you're a younger drummer, you're going to enjoy because you're going to find the beginnings boring as he builds his way up to it. But it's a, I don't know, it has a beginning, middle, and an end to the solo, which is I think really fucking hard to do on drums. And like I said, a lot of those guys where they go, who's that? Who's that other guy? Uh, played with like dream theater. A lot of guys go nuts about him and Thomas Lang, like, uh, those guys are incredible fucking players. But after awhile I just, it's just, everything's played at like 90 million miles an hour and a, it gets fucking, it all starts to sound the same. That's the thing about speed. After a while, it all fucking sounds to say, which is the genius of an Eddie van Halen to me, because Eddie van Halen could play that fast yet still could give me the chills because he still had some sort of feeling and soul underneath it. And by the time the 80s came around, everybody learned to do is tap on shit. And then it just became, who can play at the fastest? And it was like an auctioneer, a guitar after a while. And I just, I'd never fucking the fucking foot fucking 20 minutes

Speaker 1:          00:26:52       was that at every solo in the fucking eighties. Every concert you went to, they'd be like, then they fucking slow it down, it

Speaker 2:          00:26:58       big, Eh, Eh, Eh, Eh, Eh, Eh, Eh, eh.

Speaker 1:          00:27:05       And then they look at the crowd that the you like and he's basically doing the same lick over and over and over again. He was just speeding it up and slowing it down. Um, and I think half the drum solos with the same thing, they'd slow it all the way down to just like, you know, hits on the stair of drum,

Speaker 2:          00:27:23       Duh Duh, Duh. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:27:28       And then you'd stand up, put your fist in the air and everyone would go nuts. And then you would sit down and you would just slowly speed it up again. And then somebody would come out skipping around and fucking kick their foot in the air, and then they'd go back into the sock. Right. Oh, and the women dress like whores. It was such a great fucking time. It really was. And I got, I, you know, I really never thought that. I would see girls dress more skanky than they did back then, you know, with the fucking ripped up pantyhose fishnet shit. It was just, it was phenomenal with the flash dance influenced. So the fucking thing was always fallen off this shoulder, half a titty hanging out. It was just, it was phenomenal man. And uh, I dunno, going out and fucking San Jose, like the St these girls, I swear to go with the fucking hookers shoes. It's phenomenal. But, uh, do we want to think about San Jose on Friday and Saturday nights? There is enough police presence there. It's like they're anticipating a fucking riot. It's unreal. There's like,

Speaker 1:          00:28:37       they, they have everything short of like the helmets and the shields. Like, I don't know what the fuck happened. And every time I start thinking like, Oh yeah, San Jose is not a bad fucking place. You come out there on a Friday or Saturday night and there's like, there's like 40 cops on every block it seems. Um, not in case something happens. It's, it's a vibe is more when something happens and you just feel like the later you're out. He just like, oh, this is really fucking stupid. I need to go back in. I need to jump on that little electric train that only go six blocks and get back to my hotel. Hey, by the way, they had something out there called June teeth that I never heard of. Can somebody please explain to me somebody of African American heritage? What exactly that is? Somebody said that's when slaves were freed June teeth. Why is it June? Teenth why isn't it like one specific day or did they fucking drag it out between June 13th and June 19th? You know, is one last little fuck you like. All right, we're going to free up some time in the teeth.

Speaker 1:          00:29:39       Hey Mr. White man. Fucking uh, June 13th. What do you say? Can I go now? Uh, while maybe tomorrow. Just trying to get another four or five days out of you. Is that what happened? I don't fucking know. Um, all alright. Fantasy beer league. Hey Bill, you're starting a beer league hockey team and you can pick any NHL or past or present the NHL hockey player wouldn't necessarily be in the prime of his career, but something close. Who Do you pick? I think the inclination is to take someone like Mario Lemieux but I think that'd get boring as shit after a while. Yeah, and you probably fucking get mad. When I yanked on his Jersey and threatened to retire, um, he goes, I think I'd go with someone like Rick Takut. He can still dominate your league and you can imagine drinking beers with them afterwards. Exactly. You answered your own question. This is exactly why I would get, I get fucking a,

Speaker 2:          00:30:35       yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:30:35       Who's that guy? Jesus. I'm so bad with the names. The second season ends, I can't remember anybody's name. Who's The fucking guy? He's on the rangers and said that everybody gets my sloppy seconds. Somebody like him, somebody who can play and is funny.

Speaker 2:          00:30:53       You know,

Speaker 1:          00:30:55       I, I, you know something. What about Carsello? I was soccer. Cilla could actually play. That guy can actually play the game, can score goals and he could beat the shit out of people, which he did. So, you know, he's got great fucking stories and he looks like he drinks. I would definitely pick somebody like that. The last thing I would do was get like as Sidney Crosby,

Speaker 2:          00:31:14       you know,

Speaker 1:          00:31:16       he just doesn't seem like you'd have a pass the puck and a, you know, when I accidentally tripped him, if I ever got anywhere near him because God knows I'd be like good trying to get the puck, I would accidentally trip m and uh, you know, if he didn't get the call or even he got the call, he just get up and we'd do that shit where he was shaking his head but not looking at me with his fucking a rosy lips.

Speaker 2:          00:31:41       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:31:41       Yeah. I think I, maybe I go old school. I, you know, Rick Middleton was always a favorite of mine. Nifty Mamie him maybe a Jay Miller, some old school, tough guys. Uh, Bob Probert, God rest his soul if he was still around. I get guys like that and maybe some goons or something like that. Uh, all right. I need some advice. Spill going for it. Going for it. Oh Geez. Here we go. Going forward. This is some guy in from the 80 she's going to go forward. That was one of the worst fucking expressions ever in the ADC. Remember that? And it bottomed out in that rocky movie in rocky three or maybe that started it all when a clubber Lang gotten his faces like, oh bless you up. And then Rocky's like, go for it. And that was supposed to be like this big moment. Like he's not scared anymore. Go for it. Did everybody that part of the 80s, everybody in the early to mid eight and promoter, like the early eighties and all those fucking movies, everybody dress like they were on their way to an aerobics class.

Speaker 1:          00:32:49       I, in fact, I think still just the just alone. Did he have on leg warmers during part of his workouts in those movies? I can't remember. Um, dear bill, dear bill, um, since I was 12 years old, I've been playing blues music professionally around the Colorado and a front range area. What the fuck is the front range area? Is that Wyoming Bomba data, but data? Um, I've made good money. What kind of gigs did you get in the front range area? Every year? I played blues music on Hitler's birthday for this area in group slash meth lab in fucking Casper, Wyoming. Um, I've made good money and lots of friends on the way this year. I even made it to the finals at the International Blues Challenge. Needless to say, I've been blessed so far in life. Yeah, you must be a fucking beast if you can do that. He says, not bad for a 16 year old.

Speaker 1:          00:33:48       Go Fuck Yourself. You know, that's awesome. For a 16 year old, Jesus Christ, I wasn't doing shit. They only I was doing was flunking every class in high school. And, um, I had my driver's light. I got my driver's license to second, I turned 16. This the second I was eligible and I took it on a, I actually took my, uh, had the balls to take it with a stick shift. It was a 78 Chevette for speed. And they only reason why I say I had the balls. Every car and my family, we always had stick shifts. I don't know why. You know, it was funny. We had, we had manual transmission, but uh, there wasn't a sports car to be found.

Speaker 1:          00:34:32       Uh, anyways, here's my problem. Ever since I was eight years old and saw a reservoir dogs, I wanted to write and direct movies. Now this isn't a choice between my two two passions. I do plan on doing both for the rest of my life, but with the screenplay competition, I have little hope for. Um, why do you have a little hope in a screenplay competition? They have shit like that, don't they? What are you saying? You're not good, good, good at it. I don't know, Bill, why don't you read the rest of it? You'll figure it out. Um, a screenplay competition I have little help hope for. Oh, I see. No, those do exist, dude. I don't know where they are, but they do exist. I remember Matt Damon, uh, uh, Ben Affleck had that project. Greenlight, they're there. There's always people doing stuff like that. I can't say always, but there is shit like that.

Speaker 1:          00:35:20       Anyways, at dad that's recovering from a car accident. Sorry to hear that. And a mom working to keep our family in a home. I have no idea how to start making my first feature film. Now you're probably thinking you're 16. Um, no I'm not. I'm thinking you're ahead of the game this good. Uh, but I have no money for the high school like go to anymore. And being in the blues world for so long, I know that tomorrow I will wake up and be 43 wondering if I accomplished everything I wanted to. Uh, being a 16 year old blue blues musician who is most likely isn't going to get a high school diploma and wants to make movies. Jesus Christ. Dude, first thing I'll tell you is you gotta you gotta fucking, you've got to put a little sunshine in your thoughts. They're uh, they're a youngster. Uh, uh, stop listening to that fucking blues music making you just depressed. Once you listen to a little hair metal, it's happy. Um, anyways, I'm pretty lost. It's scary because I'm at the place where the things you do now affect your future. Any advice on how to keep positive as I try and become a filmmaker would be greatly appreciated. Thanks. And sorry for writing so fucking much. Yeah, Dude, you, uh, first of all, you're acting like you're 86 and not 16. All right? You're 16. You're way ahead of the fucking game.

Speaker 2:          00:36:37       All right.

Speaker 1:          00:36:39       When I was 14, I was going to go to Notre Dame and beat, become a lawyer. By the time I was 16, I was thinking, well, maybe I'll learn a trade. All right? That's how quickly I fucking, you know, went off the rails. Now has a bunch of people in trades. So what? I'm a moron if I can make the lab. No, you're a fucking genius because you can make a lip or whatever the flower, the fuck that went. Um, this is how you know how you learned to make movies, dude. You just go ahead and you fucking make one.

Speaker 2:          00:37:07       All right?

Speaker 1:          00:37:09       This is the deal. You don't have any fucking money. All right? So you could make enough money like just playing music with a goddamn bucket in front of you in downtown Denver. Save up and get an iPhone if you don't already have one.

Speaker 2:          00:37:27       All right?

Speaker 1:          00:37:29       You got an iPhone, you can fucking shoot some video then uploaded on and just, you know, do it for nothing uploaded on the computer, a friend's computer, whoever you making the movie with. Um, you just, that's the way to learn how to do shit. That's the advice I'll give you. Just go out and you do shit and a in and every time you think a negative thought that say an, I can't do this. You have to fucking mentally beat the shit out of that thought. And you have to really become conscious to have as to what your brain is telling you.

Speaker 2:          00:38:01       You know,

Speaker 1:          00:38:02       because you seem like you're in your very early on, so I don't think it's going to be that deep of a groove, but your brain is like catastrophizing. Okay. Everything you're thinking of doing somehow it, it ends with you slamming into a brick wall. All right? And if you think that way you become paralyzed and you can't, you can't step forward but you really, your heart wants to step forward but you can't cause your brain keeps fucking showing you that brick wall. So what's that going to happen is your fucking heart is to be waking you up in the middle of the night thinking thoughts like what the fuck are you doing? What the fuck are you doing? And then you, then you know you, you're going to start drinking and it's going to be or whatever the fuck something bad. It's not going to be good because I'm going to be good. Then it can become miserable. And then you can see somebody young one day who isn't in their way and you're actually going to try to discourage them, which is going to make you feel like a piece of shit. So,

Speaker 2:          00:38:57       mmm.

Speaker 1:          00:38:58       The biggest thing I would work on it is you just have to really,

Speaker 1:          00:39:03       you have to be conscious of when your brain's telling you you can't do something. You 16 fucking years old, okay? You got the whole, the whole, your whole world, the whole fucking life in front of you. And, uh, you know, you can start making a movie tomorrow and, and this is the great thing too. You have just give yourself the permission to suck. It's your first one. It's supposed to suck. All right? I had no idea how to do stand up. I just signed up for an open mic and I went on fucking stage and I hung on for dear life. And you know what? I sucked and I sucked for a while, but every time I sucked a little bit less and that's how you got to do it. And I had all that negative shit going on in my head. And, um, I bought those fucking books on how to think positive, which was hilarious with my negative mind is just as I'm reading it, uh, wanting to absorb it, I'm also ripping it apart saying this is bullshit. But, um,

Speaker 1:          00:39:55       I dunno, I, unless you're like clinically depressed, just negative thought is just a habit you can get out of. And that's kind of what I found. And you just have to be conscious of it. And uh, you know, it's really just a choice. You know, you just think a negative thought and you're like, all right, there's a negative thought. Step back, look at it and be like, Oh, do I want to fucking, you know, tie myself to that thing and have it pulled me all the way down to the ground, or am I going to say, you know what, fuck that thought and think something positive. No, I'm gonna make, I'm gonna, I'm gonna make a movie. What I would do if I was you is I would, I would just be thinking about guys like Tarantino or spike Lee or a, uh, Kevin Smith. Any of these guys who just were like, fuck it, I'm gonna make a movie. And they just went out and did it. And next thing you know that they, they had a career. Those guys can do what you can do. That's just focus on them.

Speaker 2:          00:40:49       Um, yeah, that's what I do. Fuck it.

Speaker 1:          00:40:55       You know, I'm a balding redhead in his fucking business who has a nerve to try to go and audition for movies every week. What a fuck do I get off doing that? Who wants to see that on screen? You know, but what do I think of people still want to see at Harris? They don't care. So fucking, I'm going to look at Ed Harris. I'm not going to fucking be focusing on all these washboard middled full head, a fucking hair run for president looking fucking jaws. Like I kill myself.

Speaker 1:          00:41:24       Jesus Christ. Now I'm starting to depress me. That's what I would do. You want to make a movie? You Go fucking make a movie. That's what you, that's what I would do. I don't why you feel like you're not going to finish high school. You could do that. You know you can do it. You know there's gotta be a way that you can get a high school diploma. What? What if you have to transfer you gotta fucking transfer to a new school that's cheaper. So what? You come in, all of a sudden you're the new guy. Hey, who the fuck is this guy? Right? You come in like fucking clinics. What? All of a sudden you getting blown by some chick because she thinks you're mysterious because you have a different area code. It can happen just you know, I was going to say by a trench coat, but that's probably not good to do in Colorado.

Speaker 1:          00:42:02       Was it? Oh, that was a bad one. Sorry. You know what I mean? This, you got to think positive. All right? If you keep thinking negative, that shit's going to happen. If you think positive and you do the work, that's the critical part. You'll be fine. And thus ends my little self-help afterschool special here. Right. All right. Don't write to them. Don't, don't keep taking that shit. I want to hear a few from you in six months going, hey, actually made the movie, it didn't come out that bad. You're going to learn a bunch of Shit, you know, believe me and the, and that's the kind of thing also that never ends. I'm still learning shit. Every time I go and tape a special, there's always something. Ah, fuck. You know, the first time when I did, why do I do this? It was the first time I was ever the guy calling the shots and I forgot to tell them that I needed a clock.

Speaker 1:          00:42:47       I just assumed that it was going to be there. And I went out and there was no clock. There was no way to tell how long. I didn't know what time I went out and, um, ended up being a little bit of a cluster fuck at the end of it. Um, so then the next time I did a special, I had a fucking clock, you know, and uh, you know, I, I just did another special, I learned something on that and I, and I was like, what the fuck? When am I going to have this thing down? There's always going to be obstacles. It's just a, it's just basically how it is. All right, so there we go. Now how about, what do you say if I can find it? A little bit of advertising at this point? Um, game, fly.com everybody, do you like playing video games?

Speaker 1:          00:43:31       Well good. I have a great website for your game, fly.com right now you can try the new Max Payne three ghost recon or the special ops game.

Speaker 1:          00:46:13       All it does is wear out your index joint just a little bit more by having to click two more times. That's all it does. So maybe someday when you're 90 and you go to point at some kid, I shed get off my property and your finger locks, you can blame me. Okay. But until then, you'll be, you'll be, you'll be helping out my podcasts and more importantly, you'll be supporting the troops. And I got to tell you, it's awesome. It's all, it's been a great thing. You know, I've been, I've been able to, uh, send out a check to the wounded warriors project, which makes me feel great. It's just a great cause and, uh, I've been doing it. It just been rounded up to the nearest hundred anyways, and I'm actually thinking about, given, you know, even more than that. Um, God, Oh, come on. How do you, how do you beat that project? You know? All right. That's it. All right, let's move on here. Um, advice. Don't take shit from anybody. Question Mark. Bill, sometimes you and your podcast with go fuck yourselves and don't take shit from anyone. Well, let me tell you my story. Back in November, a cop pulled me over, roughed me up, was a huge asshole and wrote up every rinky dinky ticket he could.

Speaker 2:          00:47:25       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:47:26       Now, okay, now wait a minute. What happened? You were just down the street and this guy just pulled you over. I need a little bit of the backstory. Here was this guy, did you know, did he get into a big fight with his wife and then took it out on you? Or we did you say something wise to the guy and he said, all right, I'm not in the fucking mood anyways, let's see if we could figure it out here at the end of the altercation. I shook his hand. Look him straight in the eyes and gave him that look that says, I will see you in court asshole. I showed up in court this Monday to defend myself. My plan was to stand before that asshole and having him explain his actions to me in a court of law. Add, dude, this ain't gonna work out unless she had a witness. I wanted to ask him. Even then, that doesn't work out. I wanted to ask them if twisting my arm so much that I couldn't use it for a few days was justified. I want to ask him why he decided that me five, six 175 pounds was a threat to him. Six foot to six foot three 250 that he need to hit me from behind. Um,

Speaker 1:          00:48:30       don't call me an Asshole, but I'm not 100% buy in this story because you didn't say what happened

Speaker 1:          00:48:36       before this. This guy just did this. Is this guy like the fucking worst cop ever? I don't know. Here we go. I wanted to, I wanted to know why he needed to demean me while I was handcuffed in the back of the paddy wagon. I then wanted to ask him how many excessive force complaints he had against him. The answer is four. Oh Shit. So I'm wrong here. I wanted to ask him how his marriage ended. His ex wife has a restraining order against him for domestic violence. All right. I tap out. You're right. You're right. Sorry. Uh, I wanted to ask him what part of protect and serve did he not understand? I want it to end the questioning with him explaining how he got caught on a cell phone camera assaulting a motorist. You can look up the video on youtube under Milwaukee Police Lambo driver l a m. B o driver. Here's what sucks in Milwaukee. If the cop that wrote you the ticket dis doesn't show up in court, your case is dismissed and you don't have to pay anything. We'll guess. Guess why I told you that the piece of shit didn't show up in court. Aww, that's awful. I need advice too. I let this

Speaker 1:          00:49:43       all be water under the bridge or do I take this fucker down? I really want justice, but I don't want to be beaten by other cops. What should I do? Um, well I think you just a shed some light Milwaukee police, lambo driver. All my listeners will probably look up and watch that. Um, now this guy sounds like a dangerous guy. Look, you know, this is, this is what I would do if I was going to try to take this dude down. What I would do is, you know what the local news loves doing now. They love showing like youtube videos and they love talking about Twitter and all that type of stuff because they're desperately trying to get the kids and people because they're losing

Speaker 3:          00:50:28       all this viewership to a, to the Internet. So the fact that you, you have this controversial thing, you have this fucked up law and you have a youtube video of this guy, um, that makes, that's like one of those perfect little pieces, you know, coming up next Milwaukee police officer or a little out of line, check out the youtube video that everybody's been talking about all the Lord at. Yeah, I mean, you could go that way. Uh, but yeah, I mean you, you'd taken a a, you're definitely going to take a fucking risk. Um, you know, so you can heal. Rodney King died this week and that brought up that whole video and all that type of shit. And I know, you know, the guy just pulled over. That's what you supposed to do. I know. I mean, they look at who's kitten know Rodney King was going to get beat down no matter what. I mean, if you've run from the fucking cops, I don't give a fuck who you are. You got to get beat down. But if you get back up, you charge him a couple of times absent fucking loopy. But you know, there's gotta be a way to take a guy down without giving them 12 fucking skull fractures. You know what I'm saying? It's a fighter. No, it was, uh, it's, it's, it's

Speaker 5:          00:51:38       okay.

Speaker 3:          00:51:39       It's a fucking thankless job and then it's a really dangerous job. If, if the wrong kind of person gets a, gets the job, why did my phone just go off? Oh, that's right. I got to do that ship. So, um, I don't know. Personally, I can't, I can't ever watch that Rodney King thing again. That's like fucking, it's the most brutal thing ever. And actually when you watch that, now you go, thank God they got fucking a,

Speaker 5:          00:52:06       okay.

Speaker 3:          00:52:06       What do you call those things? Taser. What did he, what did we clear? What do you call those things? What do they call those things? They just, uh, they Zappia did you guys ever see that one? Um, that one where they, the cop.

Speaker 5:          00:52:22       Okay.

Speaker 3:          00:52:22       What the fuck do you call those things? He got tased. He got fucking, is it a taser? Cleo? Why am I so dumb? Ah, fucking love this dog. You know that Cleo, um, underrated having a dog. It's the best fucking thing ever. Anyways, this I I to get you this youtube video now that it brought it up, it's uh, it's basically they're doing a demonstration of one of those fucking things. Whatever the fuck you call them that I just can't think of. Why do I keep saying it's a taser? I know it's not a he is it a taser? He got tazed I can't fuck it. I, my brain is mush. So anyways, there's one cop gonna Zap another cop to uh, demonstrate it to the class and look, man, I don't give a fuck how much of a man you are. You get fucking Zap with electricity. You're going to make a noise. Most guys go like fucking go down. Uh, uh, this guy fucking shoots it at the guy and this sounds like he's like ending an opera.

Speaker 1:          00:53:28       He gets tased. He's like just fucking drunk. He does literally something like that

Speaker 3:          00:53:37       and drops. And I just love how the cop was shoot. Some tries to act like he just didn't scream out like a little fucking girl, man. It's hilarious. But, um, but getting back to that, yeah, dude, that's, that's a serious, um, that's a serious thing. And you and you, you know, if this guy really is as bad as you're saying,

Speaker 2:          00:53:57       you know,

Speaker 3:          00:53:59       the right thing is not to let it go. The right thing is to try and shed some light on it and hopefully that they can get this guy off the force because he's given decent cops a bad name. They go, so, but your, your worries are definitely a, you know, valid.

Speaker 1:          00:54:18       I mean, considering none of those cops during the Rodney King, none of them got fucking, they got, they got off. If you can get off doing that, I mean, Jesus Christ, you know, that dude who shot that kid on that platform and in Oakland, that was fucking brutal. He's like, oh, I thought it was my, uh, thought it was my house keys. I didn't realize it was my gun and he fucking got away with that. I'm not trashing cops, I'm just saying, not saying they're all fucking bad, but I'm just saying, I mean it's, it's practically fucking impossible.

Speaker 2:          00:54:49       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:54:50       It literally, even if you have video, I think you have to have the combination of having video and then you have to be, you have to be a certain level of a wealth and influence

Speaker 3:          00:55:04       because if you're broke, you know, I don't think that they're, that, you know, you, there's no way they're just going to be like, yeah, go fuck yourself. You're done. You know? And then when you add racism into it, I mean, you're pretty much, it's pretty much game set match, which is fucking unfortunate. So, um, I don't know. I'm talking about society way beyond my fucking intellect. So I'm going to tap out here already trashed fucking hair metal and I'm would have fucking angry, a psycho cops mad at me. And then other people fucking think, I dunno. I don't know what the fuck. Okay. Response to having kids. My kid is turning me into a queer.

Speaker 3:          00:55:45       Okay. Hey Bill, I listened to the latest podcast like I always do. I heard that you heard you start to make a crack about having kids, then catch yourself and say, I hear it. I hear it's the greatest thing ever though. Uh, I'm a total hard ass attitude attitude wise. At least I'm not a tough guy. Bully piece of shit. Um, all right, so you're, you're a ball bureau ball breaking wise ass like me. So anyways, I'll make this short so you can read something more interesting. I crack jokes, listened to rock music and watch sports nonstop, but my newborn son is querying me. If he gives me one more cute looker giggle, it'll probably start a path to a wardrobe of visors, khaki shorts, braided leather belts, and penny loafers with no socks. I bet in a few years I'll probably raise the pitch of my voice and at the end of every, at the end of every question I ask him.

Speaker 3:          00:56:43       Um, well that's good. That gives me hope. You sound like an angry walled off emotional psycho. And uh, this kid's making you giggle. Honestly, sir, when was the last time he giggled? You know, that's when, you know, you had a fucked up childhood is he actually legitimately giggle and then it makes you hate yourself and then you actually, even when you're by yourself, if you giggled, you actually get embarrassed. You literally to the point your face gets a little flush. Uh, like that's how much shame you carry for actually having any sort of opinion on any sort of emotion that isn't just straight up. Go Fuck Yourself. Well, let's go ahead, man. I'm happy for you. Um, I hope, I hope that happens to be someday. I hope I'm, I'm, I'm a,

Speaker 4:          00:57:26       you know,

Speaker 3:          00:57:29       I dunno, mature enough at some point to ever have a kid, a dilemma, a bill. What would you choose to either have sex with any woman in the world? Nia wouldn't mind.

Speaker 4:          00:57:42       Okay.

Speaker 3:          00:57:42       I wouldn't care if she gave a shit. If I, my choice of any fucking woman in the world just to do it one time. Uh, that wouldn't be worth it. It wouldn't be worth it to lose Nia. But, but my Dick would override that wisdom in the moment. Um, or to have access to the truth about any government secret in history. What would you do? All right, well, how would I know any government secret in history? What would they know that I knew it, and then they'd start tracking me down and then I'd have to be like fucking Jason Bourne for the rest of my life. Never getting to sleep more than five seconds between concussions. Um, all right. First of all, if I could have sex with any woman in the world, who would it be?

Speaker 4:          00:58:29       Okay.

Speaker 3:          00:58:29       Uh, let's see here. We got the k you got, you got your major groups. I think you've got four major groups. You have famous, you have celebrity women. Yeah.

Speaker 4:          00:58:44       MMM.

Speaker 3:          00:58:47       You have, uh, like celebrities, like movie stars. Then you have, you have a rockstar chicks, sports checks, and then he got chicks from your past. You know, some teacher you always wanted to bang any woman in the world, you're going to go back. But she has to be as hot as she was. Oh, this is a dilemma. Oh, by the way, the other day I was at a comedy club in that, that a pink was dad was actually in the crowd and uh, I didn't go up or anybody, she walked by it just fucking, absolutely

Speaker 3:          00:59:28       like slumped against the wall. Beautiful. Absolutely fucking gorgeous. Um, I'm telling you some of the, like, those fucking like super famous people, like they don't even look real when they walk by. They just liked it. That genetics, like, I don't know what happened, but I'm just like, Jesus fucking Christ, you know? I mean, I knew she was good looking, right? I've seen the videos, but everybody looks good and videos, you know, and then half the time you seem it fucking real life. I'll tell you this right now. If you ever see pink, she does not disappoint. Fucking just write down the checklist. Absolutely fucking gorgeous. You know, beautiful fucking dress. That was sexy, but not slutty. She had the fucking tattoos, but not too many of them. Fucking, just absolutely a fucking gorgeous. I felt like I was in second grade. Um, you know, like when a beautiful girl walks by you like up the bid the day you'd have, you don't even know what to say. Um, all right. So let's get back to it. So if I could bag any woman in the fucking world. Well, there's two kinds of women. There's the woman that you, you're fucking is absolutely gorgeous and makes you believe in an afterlife. And then there's the other girl you want to bang just to shut her the fuck

Speaker 6:          01:00:44       Guthrie.

Speaker 3:          01:00:50       You know what I mean? Like I bet there's a lot of liberals out there that want to just bang and culture, just stick their dick right in her fucking mouth. You know what I mean? But not like a totally malicious way. Just really put one on her. Was She just fucking losing it and you know, making noises in bed that she didn't even know she could make and uh, you know, and make her be able to make those noises even though she knows that you voted for Obama. You know, there's that kind of fucking right. And then there's the other one where you just want to fucking, uh, you know, run down the beach, hand in hand with some girl, at least in my world, that's the only, those are the only two. What would I do? You know what? I would choose a, I would choose sex with any woman in the world because, um, that government learning a government secret, I've actually done that on a certain level. And it just, it's like being in show business is when you're like, wouldn't it be cool to meet this person? And then you meet them and they're like the biggest fucking asshole ever. Or they, uh, I don't know. They just like, they just do something that

Speaker 5:          01:02:08       okay.

Speaker 3:          01:02:08       Just, it just blows your whole fucking image. It's, it's, it's the wizard of Oz thing where you, you don't want it, you don't want to peek around the corner. You don't want it. You don't want to peek around the corner. So what I would do is, uh,

Speaker 4:          01:02:20       okay.

Speaker 3:          01:02:21       I would definitely, I would, I would, I would, I would have sex with some and, and you know what, it would have to be somebody famous. And, uh, then out of respect for Nia, I would have to be a, just to shut them the fuck up kind of woman. Although I would love to run down the beach, you know, why can't I have that? Why can't I have happiness?

Speaker 4:          01:02:47       Yeah.

Speaker 3:          01:02:47       All right, let's, let's pick one. One of each. All right.

Speaker 4:          01:02:54       Yeah.

Speaker 3:          01:02:54       Is there any girl I just wanted was a shut the fuck up.

Speaker 4:          01:02:59       Yeah.

Speaker 3:          01:03:00       I would say back in the day it would have been Madonna, but like, she would just, she was like beyond the noise. She was so fucking annoying. She was like, I would just want to get out of the room. You know what I mean? He always watches that blonde ambition tour and there's nothing more nauseated than watching somebody who's surrounded by yes men. You know what I mean? They're just completely fucking obnoxious. Everything they say, everyone's hanging all over every word and they just laughing at everything. Like that's, you know, something. That's one thing that I have learned in this business is, uh, a major red flag is somebody who has an entourage. If you have an entourage, like a,

Speaker 3:          01:03:39       I dunno, I've already, I, I automatically judge you as like, all right, this person is, uh, is not somebody I'm going to want to fucking be around because the only way I'm going to be able to do exist is this. I assimilate into your entourage and when you tell the joke that isn't funny, I can't be like, I can't look at you like that joke sucks. I have to fucking do like what they're doing, you know, laugh my ass off because you're paying for my hotel room with the fuck Outta here. Right. That and, and people who don't hang out with peers, you don't, maybe they don't have an entourage, but everybody, they hang out with his fucking like 10 years behind them in this business. Then that's another, that's another red flag because then nobody's calling you out on your shit. Right. That's, that's how I look at it.

Speaker 3:          01:04:22       How did I get to that with this shit? You know what, I'm going to have to get back to you on this one. You know, I'm a fucking 44 year old guy, so I don't really sit, you know, when I was younger, I had my, my, I'll go back in the day, my list. Okay. When I was a kid, uh, the bionic woman, all three Charlie's angels, uh, Farah, I wanted to bang, I had lust for her, Kate Jackson. I would marry and Jaclyn Smith get out. What's your fault for stand in between the two of them you're going down to? But you know, I didn't need Jaclyn Smith because I already had the Brunette with, with fucking, uh, Kate Jax. Um, then who else? Who else in the 80s?

Speaker 4:          01:05:14       Okay.

Speaker 3:          01:05:14       I like what's her face, the replacement for Shelley long. Uh, who was in the look who's talking, she came on had that horse, smokey foresee fucking smokey voice, whatever the fuck you thought to say. It's supposed to sound way more sexier than that. Uh, she had nice fucking curves. Got a little out of control there after a while. But uh, you know, um, she still has nice hair. I got to tell you,

Speaker 2:          01:05:40       uh, who else?

Speaker 3:          01:05:44       You know what's weird? Florence Henderson, when she had the worst mullet haircut always turned me on more than when she had that awful fucking, oh, Marsha. Marsha Brady, when she fucking had the little short skirts on.

Speaker 5:          01:05:59       Okay.

Speaker 3:          01:06:00       Fucking a Janet Jackson when she was on a different strokes.

Speaker 2:          01:06:07       Who else?

Speaker 3:          01:06:09       Agile as it goes on for fucking ever. I just can't remember anymore. He's never Cindy Lopper I could tell you that she didn't seem like some spazz little fucking boy to me. Yeah. And then that fucking haircut that she had was, she fucking had like a tic Tac toe board on the side of her head. That just really freaked me out.

Speaker 2:          01:06:36       MMM.

Speaker 3:          01:06:37       Not that I was totally against that here cook. Cause I thought that chicken bow wow. I thought she was hot.

Speaker 2:          01:06:42       MMM.

Speaker 3:          01:06:47       Ooh, fuck else. Did I like Lita Ford. Oh my God. That I like her. I think I might've somebody back dead. I can't fucking remember.

Speaker 2:          01:06:59       MMM.

Speaker 3:          01:07:02       Anyways. Is that the podcast? Can I end on possibly liking Lita Ford? All right. If you had to bang any of the runaways, who would your bank?

Speaker 5:          01:07:11       Uh,

Speaker 3:          01:07:13       I would've said Pat Benatar cause she was the hardest. But just, you know, knowing that she didn't really want to do it, you know, I be to that, that would be awful.

Speaker 3:          01:07:24       And we can tag team and other chick with her. I don't fucking know. All right. Listen, this is, I got shit to do. This is the podcast for this week.
