Speaker 1:          00:00:00       Hey, what's going on? Is Bill Burn? It's time for the Monday morning podcast for Monday, October 15, 2018 what's going on? How I yeah, you hear the echo, echo, echo. I am in New York City, everybody. I am, uh, here for the next two, three days. I'm doing a bunch of press to promote my show at Madison Square Garden. No, November 7th of this same year of our Lord and the Chinese chicken, whatever, the fucking Chinese, whatever. Is it, is it the year of the Monkey? It was the year I was born. I was born the year of the monkey. You know, I find that very offensive. I am not a monkey. Yeah. Yeah. I'm a dancing monkey. I was born in the Chinese New Year of the dancing monkey,

Speaker 2:          00:00:45       uh,

Speaker 1:          00:00:47       Shanghai Shit joke. I'm trying to do a little ration right there. I did my work. Um, anyways, what's, I've, could I be having a better sports weekend?

Speaker 3:          00:00:58       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:00:58       I mean, I've got to tell you, if I'll feel poor, I gotta be pretty fucking happy. We'll put [inaudible] on the boob too. Um, you would think,

Speaker 3:          00:01:09       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:01:09       You would think that I would be excited last night that my new England patriots.

Speaker 3:          00:01:14       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:01:15       That I would be excited that they knocked off the undefeated Kansas city chiefs. Okay. Now obviously I am happy that we won the fucking game, but if somebody is going to sit there and tell me that that's what a football game is going to look like in the future. I don't even know what that was like watching two people playing Madden football in what? It reminded me of the Superbowl last year where there was just no defense and you know who likes shit like that? People who aren't fans of the fucking game.

Speaker 2:          00:01:48       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:01:48       I, I just, you know Tyree kill everybody. How many, how many fucking times cause he get to, was he going to catch your fucking ball? It was like that when Tom Brady goes down, leads us down like he always fucking does for the go ahead score.

Speaker 2:          00:02:06       All right.

Speaker 1:          00:02:09       Tyreek hill number 10 and you're fucking playbook and your program have a fucking accountant who doesn't watch sports would be like, hey, you know, I don't want to come off like a know it all. I barely watched this game, but I'm going to say you might want to cover that number 10 guy.

Speaker 3:          00:02:31       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:02:32       Oh, it comes up to like fucking the guy goes up untouched, running across the middle of a fucking NFL defense on fucking touched. Tra La la catches the fucking ball.

Speaker 3:          00:02:53       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:02:53       I Dunno, I was in a sports bar. Was it 60, 70, 80 fucking yards untouched.

Speaker 4:          00:03:01       Who would've thought,

Speaker 3:          00:03:03       okay,

Speaker 4:          00:03:04       that Patrick show time, my hope was going to go to fucking the guy he'd been going to who had been killing you the whole fucking Gig. I understand that the guy beats you. I understand that. I guess how bad, see, I understand that, but to basically not even cover the guy

Speaker 4:          00:03:24       devil. I mean, I would expect to see some play like that and central park watching a couple of Wall Street's psychopaths played fucking touch football there was pathetic. It was fucking pathetic. All right. Having said that. Um, I love Patrick, my homes. I'm sold on the guy now. All right. I don't crown somebody king in September of their first fucking year as a starter, but yes. Yes. Fucking amazing. Just an amazing beast of a fucking player. Having said that, I don't know what in the, I don't know what the fuck is going on. Dude, that fucking guy in the Kansas city chiefs where they're trying to suggest that he had Tom Brady for a and he's like, Oh, don't hurt the quarterback, and then he fucking, he runs in for a touchdown. It's just like I, you know, I understand. I guess because of the, the, the, the concussions in the longterm effects. I guess I have to adjust how I watched the game and when it comes to quarterback, who's kitten heel? All right. Those are the hot chicks. Okay. They're not paying a cover. They're not buying a drink. You know, they're going to be sitting there looking at their fucking Instagram bored out of their fucking minds because they get every day. That's what a quarterback is going to be. All right.

Speaker 1:          00:04:45       Depending on what they're doing for the league because those are the ones that, you know, bring in the money. But that, you know,

Speaker 3:          00:04:53       I don't know.

Speaker 1:          00:04:55       It's fun to watch all of that offense. But like watching that, watching a guy,

Speaker 3:          00:05:01       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:05:01       Sack a quarterback and then unsat camp because he doesn't want to get in trouble. And then seeing that same guy who runs worse than me, score a touchdown I guess was fun because I was a patriots fan. But as a fan of football, I mean, I don't know, I guess, oh no, I don't want them.

Speaker 3:          00:05:17       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:05:18       I remember a long time ago I watched an NFL films and this is before, you know.

Speaker 3:          00:05:23       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:05:24       They started overly protecting quarterbacks and you know, leading with your shoulder, which I think is a good, who's good? No. All right. Not the project overly protecting the quarterbacks. I don't like that at all.

Speaker 3:          00:05:34       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:05:37       But I remember seeing this old school football game, he and he played in the 1950s or forties and they asked him what you thought about today's NFL. And this was like in the 90s, and he just was talking through his teeth. He's like a wood look, she'll football game the day you bugging you gave you, they give him his fucking, his head almost exploded steam coming out of his ears. And I was just going like, what the fuck is wrong with this guy? And now that I am old enough to seeing the game change as much as it has, I feel like I'm turning into that guy a pill. What'd you think about your teen beat? And the chief says nay. Good. Are you going to come a Guy Rick Hale? Like I'm fucking

Speaker 3:          00:06:18       okay

Speaker 1:          00:06:19       dude. I was in this sports bar and the whole game it was just people screaming. Oh my God. Oh my God. Oh my God. It was like they were watching an eight year old tried to land a jumbo jet was the energy in the fucking room. But you know, which I guess is great. Oh, by the way, epic fucking sports bar guy.

Speaker 3:          00:06:41       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:06:41       I really learned how much people hate the fucking patriots with, uh, the fucking they hatred. This guy had to, he literally got, he got thrown out of the bar, like he was fucking Earl weaver. It was like, I swear to God, I was like watching a baseball manager get objected. He got thrown out of a sports bar, not for fighting because how much he was yelling at the fucking TV, like completely lost.

Speaker 3:          00:07:16       Yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:07:16       his composure. I saw so much of me in this guy, but it's like I do it in private. I do it when I'm driving a car or when I'm at home with my wife, which is why, you know, she fucking, you know, it doesn't like me.

Speaker 2:          00:07:32       Mmm

Speaker 1:          00:07:34       No, she likes me, but I mean I'm tough to live with this fucking guy was like when the Cino patriots what went up big, right, 24 to whatever, you know, when the chief started coming back, this guy, like, he just fucking lost it. He like the whole night was fucking hilarious cause I went in there with a friend of mine and we were uh, we will meet and another buddy of mine

Speaker 2:          00:08:01       and uh,

Speaker 1:          00:08:04       I was texting him going, hey man, we're almost here. All right, well, you know, we're pulling up. And he's like, cool, cool. Right. So I go in there, I don't see him. So I'm like, Oh shit, that's weird. I can't believe I fucking beat this guy here. So we grabbed a table when we yeah, but you know, we got one other guide comments. We grabbed the four top and was sitting there

Speaker 2:          00:08:21       and uh,

Speaker 1:          00:08:24       the Patriots scored a touchdown and I just hear this fucking guy just be like, yeah, that's what I'm talking about. America, like just being an idiot. And I'm like, who the fuck is that jackass? I look down, it's my buddy that I'm supposed to be fucking hanging out with. So me and my friend, we laughed and get a shit. We go over there certainly. So we sit down. So that's the first clue that there was going to be this lunacy. So at that point we'd gone up like 24 to like fucking three or six or something like that. It was like, wow, man. Then mopping the floor with these guys, this is crazy. Right? And all of a sudden

Speaker 4:          00:08:56       the chief start coming back. It's like 24, 13, 24 twenties. And this fucking guy down the end of the bar man. And uh, he looked like he was older than me, you know, but at this point, at my age, I probably was fucking five to seven years old in this guy. Right. But, um, but I'm going to Hollywood, so I take care of myself. I drink plenty of water. I use lotions. This fucking guy was agent like that fucking quint in, uh, in jaws. Right? So he's down, you know, when the chief scored this the first time she's called, he's like, yeah, all right. You know, and then when they scored the second time,

Speaker 1:          00:09:32       he just started yelling like, that's right. That's right. It's 2018. This is the new, this is the new NFL. It's fucking over for you and it's over for you. And he was yelling about the Patriots. He was so sick of them winning dude, I'm telling you. And then the Patriots of course come back and match it. And you know, we've got a couple of paths in a Ferris calls and this fucking guy who's losing his shit and just getting madder and madder and it's, it started off where he would yell about the play and then yell about it for three minutes. And then hs was five minutes set myth and then he was just yelling at the fucking TV and he had just completely lost all composure. Um, and the Patriots went up by seven again and they look like they were pulling away. He missed the whole end of the fucking game. I just wish she was like it was getting,

Speaker 3:          00:10:24       yeah.

Speaker 4:          00:10:25       You know, the old me would have engaged with this guy, you know, cause I was having a couple of pops, but I was kind of like a, you know, older and wiser. You know, when the chiefs went up by three points and he was learning, he was screaming, this is a new rule, blah, blah, blah. I did one point, one point yelled down, I went regular season because he was starting to annoy me. And then he just completely, like I said, he was just yelling like, I mean they see the only thing was missing was this guy. Like just if they had a home plate on the bar room floor and he could have just pushed the dirt all over it. I mean he, he completely fucking lost it.

Speaker 3:          00:11:11       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:11:12       And we just got back fucking rapper reason that fucking Pittsburgh game. I have some good mother fucker fucking Porsche, but everybody in here knows it. He said that everybody in here knows it and I was just, I was like, yeah. I was just like, is that what I look like? I asked fucking this guy, but he took it to a next and like the next level, you know what I mean? What you thought, like, you know, it was like I was fucking Michael Jordan of losing my shit.

Speaker 3:          00:11:49       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:11:50       You know? And then along comes Coby Brian like, oh wow. I thought it was not a good comparison cause he wasn't better.

Speaker 3:          00:11:57       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:11:58       I don't know. Dan Marino. Right. And then everybody, that's not a good comparison because Dan Marino would've thrown for 6,000. I didn't know what happened. Yo, you're fucking hall of Famer. You put up all these fucking number, like no one's ever going to catch this guy. And then all of a sudden you see yourself get taught. You're like, wow, man, records really are meant to be broken. Even the ones no one wants to break. So I guess they had been warning the guy.

Speaker 3:          00:12:23       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:12:23       Because it got to the point where it was kind of like, uh, he basically turned everybody into the bar into like his kid and he was the dad driving the car and everybody was just sort of be looking around like who dad's really getting worked up today. Huh. And he was with this woman and she was just smiling, looking at down at the bar. I mean, she couldn't have been with them. She would have, she would have been mortified,

Speaker 4:          00:12:53       I dunno. Or She's just the biggest st ever. And she just, what I like, I like a passionate fellow. So anyways, the bouncer comes in and literally just have some on the shoulders like you have to go. And he put his jacket on. He didn't resist on any level, but he never stopped yelling.

Speaker 3:          00:13:14       Okay.

Speaker 4:          00:13:15       And screamed the whole way out of the bar. It was like, it was literally like performance art

Speaker 3:          00:13:22       and,

Speaker 4:          00:13:24       and everybody in the bar just had like such, like a funny attitude towards it. Like, um, there was no, uh, none of that fucking shit that goes on today where that triggered me and this is a safe space. It was none of that. People were just laughing.

Speaker 3:          00:13:41       Okay.

Speaker 4:          00:13:42       Just watching like one of the most epic fucking frustrated sports fans I've ever seen. I mean, I actually started, I did, I just tried to start the slow clap when he was being escorted out. You know, I just felt like the guy, he deserved a round of applause. I haven't, I don't, I've never seen anybody like, you know, back in the day they came up with something in the 70s.

Speaker 3:          00:14:10       Okay.

Speaker 4:          00:14:10       Because people were, uh,

Speaker 3:          00:14:13       yeah,

Speaker 4:          00:14:14       we're, we're throwing shit at their TVs and they were breaking them while they were watching television.

Speaker 1:          00:14:19       So somebody invented like this thing, it looked like a brick, but it was soft and you could throw it, but you know, eventually that went away because the satisfaction is this sound of glass shattering.

Speaker 3:          00:14:34       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:14:35       You know, of breaking the thing.

Speaker 3:          00:14:42       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:14:42       That's making you up that either, you know, it's not working for you speaking as a person with a temper. Right.

Speaker 3:          00:14:50       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:14:51       You want to, you

Speaker 2:          00:14:52       want, you want the inanimate object to pay. MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:14:57       Which is why I remember a long time ago when this actor, I'm not going to say his fucking name, whatever,

Speaker 2:          00:15:05       but

Speaker 1:          00:15:07       he was trying to call this quaff and the fucking phone wasn't working and he called down to the hotel, the front desk and they couldn't help him.

Speaker 3:          00:15:16       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:15:17       Make it work. So he ripped it out of the wall and he went downstairs and he threw it. He threw the phone at the fucking guy. You know, the guy got a little cut on his head and shit. But I gotta be honest with you, like as much as he shouldn't have done that, I can't imagine the release that that must've been how satisfied he literally took the thing that wasn't working any through it at the person that couldn't help him make it work. I mean that is just like, you know, two for two. Right. But that's like a, that's like pitching a perfect game in anger.

Speaker 2:          00:15:54       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:15:56       So anyways, hats off to that fucking guy. Hats off to Patrick, my homes, he's a fucking amazing cheese. Have a great fucking team. But like, you know,

Speaker 2:          00:16:07       mmm.

Speaker 1:          00:16:10       I don't know how anybody thinks either one of those teams is going to win the fucking super bowl. You can't do, they both lit up 40 invoice it 40 and 43 points.

Speaker 3:          00:16:21       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:16:21       And everybody's, I remember seeing that back in the fucking day. Like that was how the adult, the dolphins, never one when they had Dan Marino, cause they had no fucking defense. It was just like, all right dad, you know, we're going to give up 35 38 points. Do you got 40 and yet again today, he had to go out and score fucking 40 points so we can win by two or three. Um, and those teams never won super bowls. And to this fucking day he gets shit for it. Like they blamed the one guy who wasn't a problem.

Speaker 3:          00:16:54       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:16:55       They blamed the fucking guy that got him to as far as they can

Speaker 4:          00:16:58       fucking goal before they would run into a fucking great defense, which would, you know, knock down whatever Dan was going to do by seven to 10 points. But his shit defense would still give up the fucking 35 38 points and then they'd lose. And then in real Dan Marino can win the big one. You know, fucking Joe Montana couldn't win the big one with those fucking differences.

Speaker 2:          00:17:21       MMM.

Speaker 4:          00:17:23       I mean, how many times you got to watch sports defense wins championships. Okay. I don't know what the fuck everybody's so excited about last night's God damn game. Watching two teams giving up 40.0 I can't wait to come play off toe player player. Right. Um, anyways, so,

Speaker 3:          00:17:41       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:17:41       Meanwhile on a TV screen right next to it.

Speaker 4:          00:17:46       It was the red sox and the Astros. Now I was out doing, so I missed like

Speaker 1:          00:17:50       the first half of the game I kicked by the time I came in, it was five to four. Um, I don't know how price looked or whatever. I got to go read some shit on it. But um, I think he left at five four. So I believe if if, uh, Kimbro hadn't let that run in to make it seven to five, I used to know how this works. I think he would have got the victory. So if that is the case, then he kinda got screwed out of a, out of a win last night. Um, but I got to tell you the Astros fucking lettuce up off the mat because obviously going up to Oh is huge. But the thing was they beat sale.

Speaker 3:          00:18:31       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:18:32       And that's what the Yankees had to do. They had to beat sale because then you get the price and price has not one in October. So you basically get yourself to fucking wins. And for the Yankees, they got the first two, one a three that they needed. And even with the Astros, if he went in the first two fucking gags, the other team has to win

Speaker 4:          00:18:48       for the next five and you just have to go to a three c. It's all about the mouth. So, um,

Speaker 4:          00:18:58       you know, I did not have high hopes for how we were going to look a against the Astros and how game one went down was, well, how I thought the series was going to go down. But after watching last night I was like, alright, you know, this is the fucking Sylvester Stallone. Yeah, it's so bad. It's so bad. Um, but they are an incredible fucking team. Um, so we shall see, hey, who's that bearded guy with the Bob Stanley body that we have in a middle relief. That guy's been doing all right. When I saw him, I had flashbacks to 1986 with Bob Stanley running out of the bullpen. I mean, that fucking guy, I swear to God, like he had like a cop body. Like it's a stereotypical like, like bad cop. I don't meet crooked cop. I mean like, you know,

Speaker 3:          00:19:52       yeah.

Speaker 4:          00:19:53       Just, you know, you just keep, every year you just order a bigger uniform, you know, one of those fucking guys and then just coming, running out, you know, this skinny fucking legs and his flabby fucking, I mean, how are you like a professional athlete and then you can't take your shirt off at the pool. You know, it's just fucking unbelievable to me. That's basically the body that gay had. So all muffin top Johnson, whoever the fuck we have on coming out in a middle relief, that guy is, he's just been asis, these big fucking asis and uh, Kimbrell just, you know, you die a thousand fucking deaths with that guy. He's just like, he's going to let in at least one run is what I've just come to expect. And um,

Speaker 3:          00:20:38       okay.

Speaker 4:          00:20:39       The shit that I say when he out of this mother Fucker, this fucking Cook, I'm son of a bar. You follow? Yeah, of course. Of course. You're walked up, right. Um,

Speaker 1:          00:20:48       I have the second he gets in the game, I stand up and I just start pacing. Um,

Speaker 1:          00:21:20       Of the Patriots just fucking getting all the calls and all the shit that you say about all the, all the fucking great teams. I've fucking been there. And it was just to watch it. It was, I really learned a lot about myself.

Speaker 2:          00:21:35       MMM,

Speaker 3:          00:21:37       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:21:38       It's very rare that you see two exciting games like that. And then somebody's behavior is at the same level. I mean, all three of them were, uh, were asis, but, uh,

Speaker 3:          00:21:49       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:21:49       Jesus Christ is Emma homes kid. Good. My God.

Speaker 3:          00:21:53       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:21:53       I wish that Monday night guy didn't fucking hype them up so much and make me a fucking contrarion like tap into that shit. He's like, can you just let me watch and be great? And then I can say he's great rather than you spoon feeding what I'm supposed to beat them. I hope you realize what you just saw. All right buddy. Dial it down.

Speaker 3:          00:22:12       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:22:13       It reminds me of like when that woman with the Yankees.

Speaker 3:          00:22:16       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:22:17       The Roger Clemens called Roger. Roger Clemens. Oh my goodness gracious.

Speaker 2:          00:22:23       What is,

Speaker 1:          00:22:27       um, both of them should be, they'd be doing wrestling.

Speaker 2:          00:22:30       Um, by the way, um,

Speaker 1:          00:22:36       I want to thank everyone that came out in Saginaw, Michigan. First of all, I landed at the airport and I swung by the old address, uh, where my great grandparents lived. They had a house in my great grandfather, uh, evidently dug the basement by hand.

Speaker 3:          00:22:51       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:22:52       Stubborn German guy. Right. And I don't buy, by the way, I don't know how the fuck do you do that without your house falling down into the hall.

Speaker 3:          00:23:00       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:23:01       I would imagine you'd have to start in the middle of the room, work your way out, and then pick one side. You know, and as you started to do it, you have to put something underneath the fucking foundation because I wouldn't feel safe going within two feet of whatever dirt the fucking foundation was sitting on. I don't know how the fuck he do that.

Speaker 3:          00:23:22       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:23:22       But my buddy was laugh because we, so we showed up to where the house

Speaker 3:          00:23:26       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:23:26       Was supposed to be the address and there was no house there anymore. That was in fact a lot of in that area, you know, the houses, obviously my great, great grandparents lived there a hundred fucking years ago. So, um,

Speaker 3:          00:23:38       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:23:38       The house is no longer there. It's now like it was knocked down. They put up something new. It was just like an empty lot. And my buddy was joke being like, well, you know, your grandfather dug a basement here. Maybe that's why the house isn't here anymore. But, um, I gotta tell you, man, that theater that I played in the sound in that theater was incredible. It's just, um, it was such a live theater. It was, it was incredible. I was like, well, how can you get, this is another one. He can take the fucking special in here. And the crowd was awesome. And um, you know, I was teasing him about fucking, you know, being farmers and all of that dumb shit that I do. And uh, you know, we were going to try it. We would drive and right down to Ann Arbor for the University of Michigan, Wisconsin Badger game the next day and we meet somebody in a bar and all of that shit, by the way.

Speaker 1:          00:24:34       Yes. Sober October is just out the window for me. It's not happening. All right, I'm having a bad year. Um, next year, next year I'll win the title. So anyways, uh, I was saying in my head, all right, I usually do like upwards of 90 minutes. I'll probably do like an hour and 15 jump in the car and we'll get the fuck outta here. Blah, blah, blah, Blah and all that shit. And I had such a good time. I ended up doing like an hour, 30 an hour, 35. Um, ended up going out doing like the meet and greet thing. And, uh, but it's still all worked out because we found this bar that was open till two in the morning. And me and my buddies, you know, for Z, Bart, nick and our two other buddies, uh, that we go to the games with every year, we would have in such a good fucking time. Just laughing. It's like the most laughs I've had on a weekend. Just laughing our fucking asses off, just breaking each other's balls and we were just having such a good time and we were so excited about the game the next day, you know, like all this, like the people that work there, they just start liking you. Um, then they were coming over and you know,

Speaker 4:          00:25:45       next thing you know the bar is closed and like, all right, what does it just go downstairs? Cause there was a downstairs area so we don't get in trouble. And then we stayed down there until like fucking four in the morning. So thank God it was a seven 30 game. So the next day we fucking wake up and um, we go out to go with some meat before we head over to the tailgate. When I mentioned meeting a bunch of other friends, you know, some of my relatives and all that shit to tailgate before we go into the fucking big house. Right. This is my weekend.

Speaker 1:          00:26:18       Ridiculous. Right? So we go out to this place to get something to eat, man. I'll tell you like, why did I tell you everything was just okay. It was all almost like that almost tasted good. You know how long it took for the food to get out. They didn't clear off any of the fucking plates. It was so fucking funny like this. It was just one of the worst run places I've been to in a long time. And like I remember at one point we, um, I just saw this random, you know, personal work, then go by and I just say, excuse me, can we get our, uh, can we get our check? She's like, ah, you're going to have to ask your server. And I don't know who that is.

Speaker 3:          00:27:04       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:27:05       And I'm looking at it like, well go fucking find out.

Speaker 3:          00:27:10       And then

Speaker 1:          00:27:12       do you know, of course she doesn't. They finally see our server and to do that. And then she said comes out and she goes, excuse me, the people over there trying to say that you're somebody, are you somebody? Are you, are you bill Maher is what she said, which was so fucking perfect cause the food, all the food was almost good.

Speaker 3:          00:27:30       And then

Speaker 1:          00:27:32       she almost recognized me and almost got my name right. So we were fucking crying, laughing,

Speaker 3:          00:27:38       okay.

Speaker 4:          00:27:39       About how they just kept almost. And then she goes, what is your name? And I go, Michael,

Speaker 3:          00:27:46       okay.

Speaker 4:          00:27:46       And she goes, Michael, who? And it goes stray hand.

Speaker 3:          00:27:50       Okay.

Speaker 4:          00:27:50       And then afterwards I go, none. And I am, I go, actually Bill Burr, Bill Maher does. And she goes, all right. She goes, so who was the guy you said you were? I said, Michael Strain. And he goes, I used to play for the New York giants. Now he does one of those morning talk shows. And she goes, Oh, what? So like you think that, you know, because I work in a sports bar that you just got to say like a sports process name that's kind of stereotypical isn't it? And I looked at her like Isaiah got Mike getting like me to do right now. Like what the fuck kind of energy is that? You know, that that part was like fucking annoying to me.

Speaker 3:          00:28:28       Like,

Speaker 4:          00:28:29       like how fucking fully yourself are you, you know? Do you think that's all I am as a person? It's like I don't even fucking know yet.

Speaker 4:          00:28:36       The only reason why he said straight hands, cause I didn't think there'd be a follow up question to Michael. And that was the first name I thought of. Um, anyway, so I did stand up last night at Gotham comedy club and I was having a great time until I started making fun of women and then everybody just fucking pulls back. It's one of my issues with fucking doing standup in New York City now is everybody's so air quote woke. It's like, it's like doing stand up at a fucking woman's college. I feel like I'm performing in front of old people on a cruise ship and you look at them and they're like half my age and they're borderline fanning themselves and you're just looking at him like, guys, I'm 50. You should be shocking me. I'm telling you this fucking generation, it's not millennials, it's the generation. You know, what does it see? Whatever the fuck they call these fucking people that like the level of midlife crisis that these people are going to have. It's just, it's just going to be off the fucking, it's going to be off the fucking rails. So anyways, um, after crying laughing the night before we were in this place, the colon at the, almost something, or rather crying, laughing, it just how poorly run the fucking thing was. Right. Um,

Speaker 4:          00:29:49       them, we're out in the parking lot. We're trying to decide, all right, are we going to Uber over there? You know, cause Uber is just taking forever to call or whatever. And so we finally decided we're going to Uber.

Speaker 3:          00:29:58       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:29:58       And we just started singing this Bruce Bruce Springsteen song, just trashing each other.

Speaker 3:          00:30:06       Okay.

Speaker 4:          00:30:07       Uh, you know that it,

Speaker 1:          00:30:09       oh, we just kept doing that. It would make it fun of Barton it cause he was driving, Joe can't see shit. He's like farsighted so he could see the fucking big house from Saginaw, but he couldn't see the car fucking two feet in front of them. And we're driving in, it's raining out and first he's in the back seat like

Speaker 3:          00:30:28       okay,

Speaker 1:          00:30:28       well a quiver in his voice the entire fucking time. And I've resigned myself to the fact that we're going to die. And Paul was mad at me that I didn't get as upset as he was. It's just like, dude, we're doing 80 miles an hour with the guy who can't see in the rain. So,

Speaker 3:          00:30:43       okay,

Speaker 1:          00:30:43       what am I Jack Ryan? Am I going to fucking reach over and grab the wheel? It's like we're, we're, we're either going to live or die, you know, we're not walking away with severe injuries. This is going to be a fireball death.

Speaker 3:          00:30:55       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:30:58       So we just was singing,

Speaker 3:          00:31:01       okay,

Speaker 1:          00:31:01       I can't move. So those Joe bought nick, he can't see shit changing blades in the rain. I can't even do it anymore. Right.

Speaker 4:          00:31:10       Fucking shredded my voice doing it, just trashing each other and it just went all around pulverize z and the whole fucking thing. And then they say one about me and we're just drinking in this parking lot laughing

Speaker 4:          00:31:27       like the whole weekend was, it just was one nonstop fucking laugh. Then we get to the tailgate and my buddies are on this golf course and I have the Uber dropped us off on the other side of the golf course. We had to walk like 10 fairways and you know the ball breaking started by the second hole. And I'm like, I think it's over the next till. Yeah, but all it's telling me the next silly, where the fuck are we? You know, I don't know. I believe it was a Magellan reference. I can't even remember him. We just fucking laughing. Right. And we finally ended up finding, um, finding the tailgate with throwing the football around,

Speaker 4:          00:32:07       but playing that bean bag toss game or whatever, that one of the guys there, he made his own, he built it from hand and then he had in the hole, he had it lit. He had like lights around the hole on the inside. It was just like to a whole other level and it got really fucking competitive and Farzeen this dude al that we go with, they would like to, to best, I'm like, you guys are the Dream Team. You've got to take down the dentist. Cause this kid who was a dentist was the go fucking built the thing himself. Um, corn hall I believe is what the fucking games called. And it got to the point, everyone was just so fucking into it, right? And uh, I sucked at it. Like I just kept going for the whole, I never got one to just, I didn't that you gotta have like that Robert Parish foul shot, rts shit.

Speaker 4:          00:32:53       So anyways, um, was standing there with plain and all of a sudden this fucking guy, you know, people kept walking between his throwing and we know we will take an a time letting people pass. And one guy, I swear to God, it looked like the dude from fucking radio head, he just comes walking up and he's fucking hammered real slowly. And then they tried to grab one of the bags out of my buddies' hands and he, you know, he's sort of a Midwest guy. So the, the, you know this guys, they got like a long fuse Midwest people, but you know when they snap, forget about it cause they're like had to pick up tractors when they were kids so they fucking squeeze you to death. So he kind of chills out and they got the east coast short fuse. So I just didn't like it cause he wasn't saying anything and he was just staring that kid down.

Speaker 4:          00:33:35       So I just looked at him as a 50 year old man at a tailgate. I looked at him and I said, the fuck is your problem. Like, like I'm going to roll around on the grass with this guy with my fucked up shoulder and my 50 year old Barney, right? Not even, not even thinking, oh, I've been PNID accident, have your bill. You're half a century old. Keep your fucking mouth shut and drink your role in rock. But I didn't. So what the fuck is your problem? So he's walking away and he's staring at me and I'm fucking staring at him and I'm like going, ah, I'm about where you get into a fight. Why? Uh, I got a kid, like, what am I doing? But like, I'm not going to fucking look away from this fucking guy because as much as some thinking that I fucking hate this kid, right?

Speaker 4:          00:34:21       So he's staring at me, staring at me, and then all of a sudden you can, he won't stop staring as he's kind of walking away and he's just, as he's getting into a distance of like, all right, I think he's just going to bluff his way out of this. He fucking walks into an empty chair of somebody else's tailgate. And when I tell you it took like nine seconds for this guy to slowly, it was like somebody chopped down a redwood, how long it took for him to fall and all the tailgates cause they were kind of watching it. The whole thing transpire. Uh, the like three tailgates as this guy falls, everyone were like, oh, hit the ground and everybody's dying laughing. And then he stands up and he's still staring at me. Like you ever see a drunk guy fall down, but he doesn't spill any part of his beverage. That's what he was doing. But with like a stare down, he had a cigarette is what he had and he fucking hits the ground and he's still staring him that Radiohead with one fucking I more open than the other one. And then he puts his cigarette in his mouth and as he's getting up, he's still staring at me and he grabs the chair and for half a second I'm like, this fucking Luna is going to throw this chair at me.

Speaker 1:          00:35:38       And he just stood the fucking thing up and then looked at everybody and did a giant wave. Like it was the end of the performance. And I want to say he got an applause break and he walked away. So now we're all once again crying, laughing.

Speaker 3:          00:35:54       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:35:55       Fucking crying, laughing. Just having the best time ever. Then we ended up, we ended up going into the game.

Speaker 3:          00:36:04       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:36:05       You know, I'm a couple of heaters in here, so this is when it becomes like the slideshow, right? We're at the tail gate shall change. Now we're getting checked by security. Um, so we're fucking going into the big house and I'm telling my buddies, I'm like, dude, it's not going to look like anything. As you're walking up to it, like two thirds of it, they dug it into the ground. It's when you go in there and you see the fucking magnitude of this fucking place, it's going to be unreal. So we walked in there and one of my buddies, I don't know how he did it, but you know, you know, there's no booze in there. He snuck in entire fifth of crown royal. I mean like,

Speaker 3:          00:36:43       okay,

Speaker 1:          00:36:44       like the one Keith Richards would take a swig out of,

Speaker 1:          00:36:49       um, sit down and he just pulls it up and the people behind us laughed. It was so fucking ridiculous that he got it in. They would just laugh. They're like cheeses. They started laughing and we just shared it with everyone around us. So then we were sort of like surround, it was like when you play chess and you build a castle. We did that with drunk people around us and it was fucking cold out. And um, then we just kept everybody warm and just proceed then and then, oh, then then the fucking pregame things started. I'm trying to find the video. They have James Earl Jones do it and they're like, we all though Michigan moval reach, we've won more games, the college football team, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. And then at one point he goes, we bow to no one. And we would just laugh and like, I do it.

Speaker 1:          00:37:45       I'm ready to run through a fucking wall. Um, and then the wolverines came running out. We was sitting right on the 50 yard line, like 12 rows up. We weren't too low that, you know, you lose like depth of perception. You know, we would sit and perfectly and they all just come fucking running out on one whole side of 100,000 people's is screaming God and on the other side would go. It was fucking just got chills and um, and then the game started and fucking Michigan had their way with them. Thank God. Uh, cause I did not want to see them loose, you know, and would have ruined the experience. I always root for the fucking whole team, you know, unless Lsu is play. Um, and then the game was great. I mean it sucked if you were badger fans cause it kind of just had their way with them but it was such a fucking like

Speaker 3:          00:38:40       okay

Speaker 1:          00:38:40       an amazing experience and the amount of laughs that we had, I really think like we were all sitting there talking go. I think that was the best one. I, I'm a, I'm calling it right now. We're going to have a hangover one next year where like last year where we went, we went to Lsu, Florida gators, and it was just so, uh, fucking hot out that it was, it was almost impossible to enjoy yourself. It was, it was, it was fucking ridiculous. So I think next year we're going to try to go to Clemson. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:39:13       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:39:16       I think we're going to try to go to Clemson or something like that and, uh, we're going to try to knock out all those ones that are in like hurricane, you know, part of the world just so, uh, you know, with global warming and all of that shit, we want to try to knock those up before those stadiums are under water. It's so sad, but when he can't do anything but laugh about it, right. Um, oh, I got a Texas person back, uh, be there. I'll be there around 1215. There we go. There we go. Um, all right, plowing it. Let's, let me do a couple of reads here.

Speaker 1:          00:42:12       Um, talk about your experience or the experience of someone you know who is trying to quit smoking. Well, I never really, I mean I smoked cigars, but I never did the cigarette. The cigarette thing is the hard thing. Um, and evidently it's harder to quit than kicking heroin. So, and um, that's all I know. The zero quick kit is a three tiered approach that includes prescription medication, nicotine, gum, and continued support through a mobile app. Here's how it works. Go to quit with xero.com to start your online doctor visit. After your five minute visit, a physician will then determine if you're eligible to use the quick kit. If you're eligible, the doctor will prescribe your medication in the quick kit will be shipped directly to your door. Zero costs less than what the average smoker spends on cigarettes and less than other quittings options go to quit.

Speaker 1:          00:43:09       Would xero.com/pir and for a limited time, my listeners can get their first month of the quit kit to stop smoking for just $37. That's quit with zero.com/burr quit with xero.com/bar that's like another fucking thing where you just realize that it really is all about money.

And just, I mean, they literally killed people that fucking mass mass murderers, mass fucking murders. You tell me what isis would do different with tobacco. They probably try to kill you a little quicker. Those dumb fucks, they'd probably put some fucking explosives in it and they only kill a few people and then get caught. Um, yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:44:06       But you know what I'm telling you, all you need to do to go from being a terrorist to an upstanding us citizen is just donate to a politician's campaign and then you'll, you're, you're in the clear, that's all you got to do.

All right, let's get into some of the questions here for the week. All right. Sociopath island. You'll Billy one punch. Checkout psychopaths. It's an animated show about the same idea you had last week throwing all this psychos on an island.

Speaker 2:          00:47:56       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:47:57       Hey. You know what, man, I got a phone. I actually just watched the, uh, I watched the clip of that. I think I'm going to get into that show. Um, as far as I can tell, cause there's no talking or anything, there's no dialogue in it. It looks like there's a group of people who aren't sociopaths and for some reason they have to go to associate psycho island in fucking maybe rescue somebody. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:48:18       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:48:20       I Dunno. But it's definitely interesting and it's always, uh, I came up with a great idea that not only did somebody else already have, they've already developed it. Um, that happens to me all the time. And the worst case of it was a time when I wanted to do a parody of a drum instructional video and someone's like, somebody already did that. I was like, you gotta be fucking kidding me, Fred. Armisen. All right, dude. You called it DNA. Uh, Yo belt. Listening to the throwback last week. And you mentioned how even if you don't bank online, your shit is online anyway. So that was 2010. Now you're coming down on ancestry DNA test and I think history is going to repeat itself. This article basically says that even if you don't send your DNA into the Internet, they will be able to deduce all of your DNA Info anyways. Yeah, they need like 6 million people. They're halfway there. All felons, you know, have to give up their fucking DNA. And then all these fucking mouth breathe in fucking morons who just trust people are sending in their fucking saliva to the fucking Internet. It's so stupid. The article says once the registry reached 3 million off, I, okay, I was wrong. There'll be able to identify the people who haven't sent in their DNA currently there at the 1 million mark. Dude, you called it. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:49:39       And it's like what are they going to do with it? Like the, the fact that you're going to sit there and you're going to depend on all of these fucking people to do the right thing. I mean, look, look what's going on. Like everybody knows what the fuck is going on in the world right now, but she can't really talk about it because they got the game. So sewed up that you're viewed as like a sociopath or fucking UNAMERICAN. If you even remotely criticize what the fucking people who are making tons of money off of other people's misery, R and d, they're just going to have you, it's going to be game set. Fucking match.

Speaker 2:          00:50:09       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:50:11       And I'm not even gonna read that article because it's going to be so fucking depressing because people are just, they're just gonna keep doing it.

Speaker 2:          00:50:17       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:50:20       Yeah. It's just going to be like,

Speaker 2:          00:50:24       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:50:24       I think it, it all ties into, uh, how people that are in control, if they're doing wrong things, it makes you paranoid and you can not have enough information on people. And then also there's no fucking way that these people, when they go to those Bilderberg fucking meetings, there is no fucking way that they are not having hardcore,

Speaker 1:          00:50:50       you know, I need to go to the hotel bar after this and fucking drink this meeting off talks about the population problem and climate change. There's no fucking way that, that, that they're not talking about that shit. How the fuck they're going to handle it and how they're going to survive and who else they're going to determine it's going to survive and that God has put us in power. We have to make these tough decisions. Um, which I mean, I like, I have a solution on how to, you could fucking solve those problems, but you know, I don't know. So I think they're trying to get as much information so they don't, you know, I think once they get everybody microchipped uh, then that's when they're going to start fucking thin in the herd and they need to do it quick.

Speaker 1:          00:51:38       And this right here, this train of thought is why I don't watch the fucking news because that's everything that's going on in everything that they're showing. That's what I can't even watch the weather channel anymore. I'm just like, dude, this is like, this is, this is a fucking done deal here. This is over. Um, anyways, buying a car. Hey, let's get back to some fucking bread and circus here. Buying a car. Dear Billy Ball boy, uh, a bill first. I just first, uh, just wanted to say thank you for your show you put on in Springfield. It was fantastic and definitely would love to see come back sometime. I had a great time to thank you. I always listened to the podcast on my bus ride to school. Anyways, I am a sophomore in high school and I just received my permit. Ah, good for you man.

Speaker 1:          00:52:19       That's a big day. I have a job and I'm saving up for a car. I was wondering what your first car ever was and what kind of car would be good for a first timer like me and what should I look for when buying a car that would be beneficial. Thanks to go fuck yourself. I had a 1983 Ford ranger, four cylinder, five speed overdrive, a black vinyl seats, fire engine red. Um, the long bed, there was enough two wheel drive, nothing cool about it. Um, but it only at 19,000 miles on when I bought it. So it was definitely reliable. I paid five grand for it. Um, I went out and got alone and with the job. So you know, I got alone, I established credit and that type of shit. Still remember my, my, it was Danvers savings bank, one cone and street Danvers mass, something, something, something. And I'm, my payment was $138 and 63 cents. I still fucking remember that. So if I was you, um, you're obviously going to buy a used car.

Speaker 3:          00:53:22       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:53:22       I mean, I always loved the Honda's and the Toyota's back in the day because those engines would just last forever. I don't know what they're doing now, but I remember I, I got some acting work and it made some money, but I've always been a frugal son of a bitch. So rather than buying a new car in like the late nineties, I bought a 1988 Honda accord LX five speed, four to a five speed. And I fucking loved that car. It had a hundred thousand miles on it when I drove it. And that fucking thing could cruise at a hundred miles an hour. Still no fucking problem. It was such a well built car. So if I was going to go used, you know, you gotta be, you gotta be careful with whatever the flashy cars are. Like when I was a kid, everybody would try to go out and buy the Burt Reynolds fucking trans.

Speaker 1:          00:54:09       And with the screaming chicken of the flaming Eagle, whatever the fuck they called it on the hood. And you just had to know that those cars were, they would driven like a sports car, fucking burnouts and neutral drops and all this shit that people use to do, try and do the gym Rockford back in an up and whip in the fucking front end around. So, um, I dunno. And I also liked having a four door car cause I used to like hanging out with my friends. Everybody could pile in and uh, you know, all depends on what you're looking for. But I would definitely, I would get something that, uh, is, is uh, that has the reputation of lasting rather than, I dunno. I mean you do want something kind of cool try. If you can blend both those worlds, something kind of cool looking, but also it's going to last.

Speaker 1:          00:55:00       I would get something like that. Um, and you know, if you have to take out a little bit of a loan, you know, you already got a job that's fucking cool. You established credit, um, you pay the fucker rough. And, uh, then you know, then you're into that world, right? Learn about money and all of that shit. All right. Halloween costumes. Um, oh, I gotta wrap this up quick here because I got to get running here. All dear Billy Billy's dear Dr. Billy Stein, I have a two year old daughter. Oh, congratulations as well. And I'm starting to remember all this fun stuff we do this autumn season, jumping piles, Aleve, watch Halloween movies and tried to scare the shit out of ourselves by running through the woods at night. I don't think I've ever heard you recall any favorite Halloween costumes for Halloween memories. The you and Nia have any place plans to dress up your daughter.

Speaker 1:          00:55:51       Also, if you had a professional costume and makeup team, what would you go for as Halloween at this point in your life? Um, ps, nothing goes better with the cigar than apple cider. Nothing really. Rarely. Well, it just so happens I know somebody who makes apple cider who also happens to be one of my favorite drummers of all time. Tim Alexander from Primus. He has his own a site or what the fuck is it called again? He just fucking ask me if I wanted some too, when I told them I can't, I'm fucking in sober October, which I was. And now I'm not. Let's see. Tim Owl eggs and they're cider. The shit is, I mean if you're into, if you're into fucking site or man. Okay. Herb site or.com.

Speaker 2:          00:56:45       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:56:47       What do we got here? Here we go. Yeah, it's called heard cider. It's hard. Our herb site or is a craft cider produced by world renowned drummer, Tim Herb Alexander and his wife Sharma created their first batch of cider in their garage in the fall of 2016. Yeah, dude, he gave me some of that stuff. It's fucking delicious. And then I brought me, give me like a whole case of it. So I brought it down to the comedy store and gave it out to see a bunch of comics and everyone's just like kind of fucking went nuts for it. So anyways, um, let's get back to the Halloween stuff.

Speaker 5:          00:57:18       Um, mum, mum, mum, mum.

Speaker 1:          00:57:23       Uh, okay. What are you asking me? Do I have any plans to dress up? Yeah, I mean, I usually dress up like John Bonham or a fucking, you know,

Speaker 4:          00:57:33       maybe I was going to go with Vinnie Paul this year, you know, just as he passed away this year or something like that. And as far as our daughter, my wife was talking, she was going to dress, dress her up like Bruno Mars because our daughter has like curly hair. She's so fucking cute. It's ridiculous. But uh, at the last second she went to the costume place and she got us all like matching like skeleton costumes, which I thought was a little hacky going out as, as, uh, when she told me the idea, but then I saw him, they're really fucking cool and it's going to look cute. You know, we're having a, um, Nia does the kid Halloween party every year, so we have a bunch of kids come over. So I guess I couldn't dress up like something too scary. And I guess if I dressed up like John Bonam or Vinnie Paul, they wouldn't know who it was. And it probably just looked like a scary fucking guy. Um,

Speaker 2:          00:58:23       okay.

Speaker 4:          00:58:24       So anyways, um,

Speaker 4:          00:58:28       did I answer your question? I don't even fucking know. I'm just thinking about smoking a scar. Drink at some fucking apple cider. Them are underrated. Uh, going to things by yourself. A No girls, no friends, no family, no problem. Hey there, Billy freckled glutes. My whole life I had this dilemma regarding going to events or social gatherings alone. I've even had friends say that I, if you eat alone at a restaurant or Mcdonald's or something that's social suicide. Well, no one ever told me that I love going to ship on myself. Uh, this can be really debilitating, especially if your work schedule sucks. You live in a town or a million other reasons. But I figured I've been thinking well, but I finally figured it out. Who cares half the time that you could, that you do have a group to go to something with people, flake, want to change plans, times, cetera.

Speaker 4:          00:59:21       If there's an event you really want to go to, you have to think about yourself and just go, even if you are by yourself. And I write this as, I'm a little nervous wanting to go to see a comedy show tonight that I have to drive a bit to that's out of the way and go there alone. Well, I'll be honest with you, I just don't sit up front. If you go to a comedy show alone, but other than that, there's no problem with it. And then, you know, usually meet people. You know, I used to go to shit by myself all the time, baseball games, football games, all of that shit. I wouldn't talk to anybody because I was a fucking lunatic. Anyways, I say this because I say this constantly having to deal with the issue, uh, including your tours. Some very good friends dropped out of going to your show show.

Speaker 4:          01:00:07       Well, I don't blame them. I just feel like for me it puts you in this spot of, oh, now I just can't go. And your instinct is that you getting that experience is impossible and your instinct is that you are getting that experience is impossible. We'll fuck that. You might as well go because if you think of it and that way you will miss out on a thousand bill birth, special sporting events, holidays. And before you know it, you're, you're at the end of your road and have all these piled up regrets. Forget about the stigma of Solo attending things. Live your life and have fun. Did you guys hear my stomach growl in there? Try not to eat like a fucking asshole here. Um, and that's all you have to say. That's all I have to say about that. Can't wait for you to see what the guidance you ranty bastard. Go Fuck Yourself. Thanks for the laugh. Inspiration. And one more time. Go Fuck Yourself. Yeah, you've got, if you want to go, go. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:01:04       Just because someone else can't go. I mean, what are they, what are they, the the fucking dictator of what you go to. Absolutely. Go to use by yourself and then chat up a couple of ladies. Who were you here with? Ah, I came by myself. It's actually like a fucking strong move. All my friends slaked and I was like, fuck it. I'm going to go. I'm show me somebody nice and look at it. I ran into you and then your red,

Speaker 4:          01:01:25       right?

Speaker 1:          01:01:26       Go on a fire. My baby got a hold. It's hard going to have an afternoon. I came to this shit all by myself and now I'm talking to you. Would you like to see my deck? Hey, I was just fucking around. Please don't lead to me age. Sorry. Um, anyways, would you like to see my Dick? I asked fucking permission. Why you flip out? Please don't put that on Twitter. Uh, sorry. I'm losing my fucking mind. You don't want to realize too, I'm in my fucking this fucking apartment here and, and people. Yeah. People are gonna

Speaker 4:          01:02:04       be hearing me down the hall singing about me to stuff and I don't want to trigger anybody. All right. Dash had. All right, go red sox. Go Patriots. Patrick bulbs is the real deal. I miss defense in the NFL. Um, that's all I have to say. Go fuck yourselves and I'll check in on you on Thursday.
