Speaker 1:          00:00:00       Hey, what's going on is bill burns time for the Monday morning podcast from Monday, June 11th, 2018 what's going on? How are you? How's everybody doing? I'm a fucking old man. It's 50 year old. Oh, I remember when podcasting started back in 2005 I just wanted to throw that out there cause I know there's going to be a bunch of fucking podcast people going.

Speaker 2:          00:00:30       It's been in Japan since 1968 and I stood my poor care seats for use before using [inaudible] steel. We're mind is you get these many, many kids as you wish judge on who gives a fuck.com I actually look at the numbers every week and I feel that my podcast [inaudible] you and change it. I'm, I'm providing

Speaker 1:          00:00:54       computer. We shut the fuck up. I love people. Look at their fucking podcast numbers. If you noticed, everybody seems to be in the type town, everybody, you know it's like five talked about this before. It's like a, it's like back when I used to do college gigs, every college I went to somehow they figured out a way to fudge the numbers that they were number one in something. You know the number one a fucking school for mathematics, the number one school for engineering's doesn't that have mathematics and it, I don't know. Right. And then we're just so you get down to a community college and they'd be the, the number one community college, uh, you know, with fucking the best deal with triple a or some shit. I don't know. Some other were number one or something. You got to hang your hat on something.

Speaker 1:          00:01:37       If you're a college to try and get people to go there. If I, if I was a dean, did they have deans at like community colleges? I would just, I would go on fucking TV and say, listen, why the fuck would you go for years when you can only pay two years? You know, you want to go to Harvard, fine. All you have to go, it's your junior and senior year. Go your freshman and sophomore year over us over us. We are number one in being fucking 10 times less per year than Harvard. You got the grades, you know you're in. Come on down. Teach us dummies, my dumb students, how to wear fucking loafers with those socks, whatever the fuck it is you smart people do, do your freshman and sophomore year here translate, translate, fucking transfer over to Harvard and there you go. And you can graduate from Harvard wide, a dad, Yardi, judge, [inaudible], JJ or whatever they're fucking school song is what is this school?

Speaker 1:          00:02:42       So my dad is rich and AH, did real bad in school but he has money. So, um, for gain here. Now let's say that's the stereotype. That's not true. I knew, I knew a I one kid in my high school, he got into Harvard and he did it with fucking grades and no social life. He made the sacrifice. The rest of us didn't want to do it. You know, like that little fable there with the fucking ants saving all the food and the other animals like, hey man, I'm just jumping around and having a good bucket time. You know, you know who wrote that story? I bet somebody who couldn't fucking, who was really socially awkward at a party. So he was looking at the fucking, was it a rabbit tortoise and the hare? That's not the story. I don't know what it is, but it's, you know, you know people who are outgoing, they get fucking annoyed by people who are outgoing, who are out there having a good time, talking some shit, hooking up, right.

Speaker 1:          00:03:43       Singing songs. They in the life of the party, they stand on the side and the fucking wall and they write scripts, you know, so that's why now I don't know what the fuck happened back in the day. Used to have cool people and movies. Now it'd be cool. Person has this underlying insecurity that they're trying to overcompensate for. That's all right or shit, I think, you know what I mean? Some people just are the life of the party. So anyways, now that I'm a senior citizen, I banged out 54 pushups on my birthday, a boy, and then immediately just fucking collapsed onto the cap it and was like out of breath. Like, I ran 54 flights of stairs, but I did it, man. I did it. I don't know what it means. It's still means I'm 50, but it made me feel pretty good about myself.

Speaker 1:          00:04:39       Um, I had a great birthday. I want to thank my lovely wife. Um, she surprised me with tickets to the French Open, Roland Gals, Valenzuela Tulay mooned um, we fucking, we went there and I got to see, uh, what the fucks his is his name that he's the only one left. He just won his 11th Raphael Nay Dow. That's right. I'm not the biggest fucking tennis guy. And I knew that he had won this thing a couple of times. I didn't realize he'd already won the fucking French Open. He had already won it 10 times and I saw him when his 11th. And what's really interesting is that guy, um, he wanted oh five oh six, oh seven oh eight and then federal one oh nine. Then he went in in 10, 11, 12, 13 and 14. So he wanted four years in a row, Mr Year. And then when it five years in a row and then two years, 15 and 16, he didn't win it. So people probably all thought, all right, his run is over. He's one of the greats of all time, but now that he's older, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. And he fucking comes back last year and this year to go back to back again, winning 11 and I was talking to somebody last night, we were trying to say how, what, how, what do you compare that to in a different sport?

Speaker 1:          00:06:08       You know, you can't really say it's like winning an NBA championship because there's only one of those where with tennis majors, this is for, so it's like they have four sort of super bowls. So we kind of said, I guess you'd have to go to golf, compare it to golfers were, um, you know, there's four majors in that sport. I don't fucking know. It was kind of saying, well, maybe it's like Lebron going to the NBA finals eight, nine years in a row. And it's like, well, no, because this guy actually won the thing. Um, I can't believe people give Lebron's shit after losing to, they, people forget so quickly. You know how ridiculous it was that Kevin Durant went to the warriors and then the, you know, and then he wins a championship. People like, what the fuck? And then you just kind of say, oh, this is how it is.

Speaker 1:          00:07:00       It's just how it is. Like when they first put a little fucking TVs in the back of a cab and people like get these things the fuck out of there, then making me car sick, then I got high and then later on they just put them back in and get, and nobody said, Oh yeah, I guess this is just how, I guess this is just how it is. Right. Um, all right. Uh, I dunno what the fuck I was going with that tennis golf major shit. But I mean, just the fact that this guy won 11 in a row and I basically got to see on my birthday the greatest, um, I guess you'd have to say the greatest player ever on clay. I got to see him. I got to see the fucking Wayne Gretzky, the Bobby will, uh, uh, tennis and uh, he was playing this other kid and he broke him his first game of both sets and the kid had a bunch of unforced errors and uh, you know, you could see he kept back to the guy lost it seemed like he was a kid and he just had to go there, experience it, lose, make a bunch of unforced errors for the next time when he comes back.

Speaker 1:          00:08:06       And in the end right, an English dude comes out of won the French Open. Uh, I dunno that from the way he was talking, it was like late fifties, early sixties. And he came out to say a bunch of great shit about Raphael and they doubt. And then when he talked about the other kid, he was just like, go and, you know, we would have liked to see more. We would like to say more tennis said. I'm sure he's a little disappointed in his game today as with the rest of us. And everybody's just sitting there going like, dude, you didn't need to fucking say that. I couldn't tell if the guy was nervous. He just sort of talked himself into a corner and he meant to say, um, he has nothing to be disappointed about. I don't know what I'm trying to give them the benefit of the doubt, but everyone's just kind of sitting there like, Eh, I kind of, uh, kind put a fucking damper on things [inaudible] done here. Right. Sorry, I've got the bootleg recorded here, um, which I have on my stomach too. So if you start hearing grumbling, I apologize. Um, anyways, um,

Speaker 1:          00:09:10       I was able to watch gang, uh, was it game three of the NBA finals when I was in London at about two in the morning, I was able to watch and I was able to watch, oh my God, the fucking Washington capitals.

Speaker 3:          00:09:27       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:09:27       Win The Stanley Cup through Josh. Adam Meyers. Cause I couldn't get it on my phone cause I couldn't remember my password from fucking, um, you know, my cable company. I could have just gone on to NBC sports and just sat there and watched it. But my, my daughter and my wife were sleeping so I was laying a bed. What in bed? Wide awake with the lights out.

Speaker 3:          00:09:49       Yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:09:49       just hitting refresh on my phone, looking at the score. And uh, when there was a few minutes left, I text Josh Adam Meyers and he goes, dude, he goes for fuck it. He was the one to tell me he was just going to NBC sports. And of course it didn't work out for me cause I knew my password. And he goes, well call me up. I'll answer my computer, I'll facetime and Assam Shit. So I said, all right, but here's the thing, I'm going to be in the dark and I can't say anything because my,

Speaker 3:          00:10:14       okay,

Speaker 1:          00:10:15       my daughter's sleeping in the same room and everything, so he goes, all right, call me. So I snuck into the bathroom light still out because the only way to turn on the lights in that fucking hotel room was I had to have the bathroom door open, which would have woke my kid up. Some sitting in there, they're like a dark in the dark, like a creep. The only thing that's lighting me up is off of my fucking phone. It looked like a horror movie and Josh was just laughing at me and he's like, can you see it? Can you see that? Just put my pasty white, the hand up to the screen, given the thumbs up. And I actually watched the final three minutes of the Stanley Cup. Um, and I have to tell you, uh, this guy on the Internet put it best. He said in talking about Alexander Ovechkin, he goes, I don't, can't remember the last time I was this happy for a complete stranger. Um, that was watching the capital's when was everything that you fucking watch sports for? It's everything that I love about sports and um,

Speaker 3:          00:11:13       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:11:13       You know, anybody that says, you know, Russian players don't give a shit about the Stanley Cup. Just all they need to do is just watch him walking around with that thing in Vegas. And how cool is it? Like they actually know it would have been great if they want it at home, obviously. But like if you got a win it on the road, Las Vegas has to be the place she wants to be if you're going to go party. Right. And, um, I say it every year at the Stanley Cup is the greatest fucking championship trophy and all this forge simply because there's only one. And you grew up as a kid watching all your heroes hoisting that thing up. And when you're in the million to one odds, whatever the fuck it is that you actually win it. When you hoist that thing up, you're holding the same cup.

Speaker 1:          00:11:56       You know, Maurice was Shard Gordie Howe, Bobby or Wayne Gretzky, Mark Messy, a Mario Lemieux, all of these greats, the same fucking cup Eisenman all of those guys. And you hoist that fucking thing up, said, daddy know Ciara twice. I had to throw one, the Braun in there. Um, it's the coolest fucking thing ever, you know, however, I would not drink out of it. I can tell you that right now because there's been enough guys who've, uh, you know, over the years, hockey, former hockey players that have told stories about some of the shit that happens to the Stanley Cup. Uh, he goes, yeah, and one of them, I vaguely remember somebody saying, I would not drink out of that thing.

Speaker 3:          00:12:42       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:12:42       This stories of strippers sitting in the top of the fucking thing and bending it or some shit like that. Um, I dunno. And then each player gets it for like a week. It's so fucking crazy, so crazy. And then there's this guy that's got to be a fucking movie about that sometime. The poor bastard who has to follow the cup around all years. Somebody must have done a documentary on it. Vaguely remember seeing some shit like that when you get to follow, you know, go to fucking a titty bar in Saskatoon, whatever the fuck the companies up for the week. Um, but anyways, congratulations to the Washington capitols in their first Stanley Cup championship and, uh, what is it, 44 years, 45 seasons. Um, and as I tweeted, one other great thing is, uh, NHL has another great hockey city in Las Vegas. And after all those years of taking these cities that just, you know, there was the initial excitement and then it just kind of fizzled. Um, they kind of hit a home run in Nashville and Los Vegas and I got a feeling that Seattle is going to be huge just because those fans are maniacs, you know? And I'm sure they'll build a stadium to make him sound even louder.

Speaker 3:          00:14:00       Okay. Why

Speaker 1:          00:14:01       do I always give him shit? You know why? Because it's fun because it's fun. Oh, I heard Edelman got busted for something pds or something like that. And uh, now they're going to Wa he's going to appeal it. And what I'm going to love about that is now everybody's going to be like shoe. That's why they beat Atlanta and Dah, Dah, Dah, and all this fucking shit because they're the patriots. That's how it works. You'll just look the other way when 30% of the Legion of boom tested positive for fucking steroids. Ah, that's all right. That's all right. That's Seattle. And so, okay. I had pee Dee sent to my house in my wife's name did for my wife. She was taking a pop tart out of the toaster and she hurt her shoulder and she needed a fucking steroids to get back in shape again so she could make some fucking lemon Marangu Pie.

Speaker 1:          00:14:51       Anyways, um, if I had to guess, you know, we had that horrific injury and he's doing the Andy Pettitte thing. He's fucking trying to get back and he took some fucking roids and he got caught. It took something and got caught. There's a lot I'm thinking. Um, but I do know when, anytime anybody seems to appeal these things, I don't think that they ever had ever goes back the other way. But I'm glad that I'm not in the u s to listen to ESPN and all these fucking guys now say, Oh yeah, yeah, they should take away all their titles because they got caught. They had a player get caught doing what a player got caught on. Every out of bucking team has done. Um, so anyways, enough, uh, enough with the sports shit. I am in Patty. Amen. Patty and I embalming with my French.

Speaker 1:          00:15:36       They didn't brush up as enough as I want it to. And it's making me discouraged, but I'm hanging in there. I got my, uh, I got my fucking, uh, what do you call it? Rosetta stone and that Shit, I'll do it when you, when you go to the fucking French Open, all right? And you have your ticket, you go in and you got out of the fucking thing scanned. And then after he gets scanned, you get this little fucking, it's like a ticket. The size of the knee, they putting your fucking white. But when you, when you pay for parking, all right? And then everywhere you go, you have to take that thing out and they have to scan it to know where the fuck you are at all times. You know, I went into the goddamned gift shop, bought a little fucking 2018 Roland Garros Mug, and he goes, I need, you know, let me scan your ticket. And that's just like, I wish she just said, no, you're not scanning my fucking ticket. I'm paying for that. So now what does that add? Does that add to my whole fucking information online. He's into drums. He does this, he drinks too much whisky and he, he can't lay off of a mug when he's in some touristy fucking place. Now I'm going to get all these fucking ads. Now I'm going to get all these ads, the in the side when I go to fucking porno sites and shit about mugs.

Speaker 1:          00:16:51       He funny if they had, why don't they have a gift shop on online? Poor porn. Why [inaudible] we're good food. Um, and actually they probably do. Um, so anyways, every fucking place you went you had to keep taking it out and keep taking out and putting it away, whatever. So now, finally I'm going, you know, I bought like a fucking still water in a crepe for my wife and I had to get the things scanned. You know what? I'm in another country somewhere on my best behavior. Normally I would be like, why the fuck do I have to scan this? But the only reason why I didn't say this is I didn't know what to say. Why the fuck do I have to get this thing scanned, you know, in French on Francais, right? So now I go to walk in, it's five or three franch time and uh, the match starts at three o'clock, right?

Speaker 1:          00:17:40       So we go to go in and guess what I can't find because they've had to take it out of my pocket 58 fucking times. I can't find a ticket. I need to get into the goddamn match. But I have that other thing and the lady's like, I'm starting to see, or you could not to get into the the, but it's a doing. I was fucking shit. I'm just like, are you serious? And then she got mad at me. She's like, yes, yes. I had to go all the way the fuck back, wade through all of these goddamn people. Then go to customer service. Oh my God, the fucking Tourette's that was going on with me as I walked all the way back past all of these fucking people. Um, I got to give it up to the French people. You know, you guys, you know, you don't smell as bad as everybody says, but I will say this when you do holy shit. Then when we walked out of the stadium, there was this guy like fucking, he was probably a good six feet in front of me and I said, Jesus Christ, we actually made, he went left down the stairs. After one flight, I went right. And I tried to get away from the guy I said, and I had my shirt up over my nose so bad. This guy smelled. I said to me, I could, she's Christ. This guy smells like he fucking played. How do you smell that bad? Sitting, watching people working out.

Speaker 1:          00:18:52       Maybe Casey was walking down the stairs fast. Who's creating a breeze? And it was passing through his fucking French armpits. But Holy Shit. Did that guy stick? Not as bad as a homeless guy, but like he smelled like he, you know, freshly homeless, good. Three, four days, you know, maybe a tornado hit his fucking house and Fema hadn't come over to help them get, that's what this fucking guy smelled like sitting, you know?

Speaker 3:          00:19:20       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:19:21       And tennis is a really snobby fucking rich person's sport, especially down below, you know, up top, it's a bunch of animals. That's what we was sitting in at the ever go. Uh, we got front row in the upper deck, get the second row upper deck because front row they had this glass thing. But you know, they chill partition that you look through. But on top of it they have this solid thing that all holds it together. And I was like, in America, this would have been clear plastic. So I had to look over and duck under it, the whole fucking match, which was still fine. Um,

Speaker 3:          00:19:54       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:19:54       So anyways, but down low is where all the fucking, you know, the coaches are the super fucking rich people and they go there and like fucking outfits and they're big dumb hats and all of that shit. But all the animals were up top, you know, doing the wave and shit when nay dal had some problem going on with his hand or his arm. I don't know what the fuck happened. And um, but anyways, I always, it was, it was an amazing fucking time. So I had to go all the way back and I got the ticket. Then I came walking up and I, you know, after all that flipping out and all of that fucking bullshit, I still made it in the time to see the match as always. 99% of the time I flip out later on if there's a solution, whatever I thought was going to happen because he didn't, convenience never fucking happens.

Speaker 1:          00:20:42       And, um, I thought it was going to leave all of that behind in my forties, but evidently it's to continue. I started strong the day I turned 50. It fucking, it just continued on. So, um, I'm going to rent a fucking bicycle today and I'm going to ride around Paris when my, uh, my daughter goes to sleep and we just been having the, uh, the best time here. As always, I'm going to take a well deserved fucking little vacation here. And, um, the hardest thing for me on vacation is not to just playing a bunch of shit every day. Um, you know, and then it just becomes a thrash. It's funny, like we, uh, we drove by, was it the Notre dam or some shit like that and the guy driving us was going to go, so you know, it's beautiful. You got to go in there and Blah Blah and I sweat it.

Speaker 1:          00:21:40       I'm just not into that shit. Those old churches and stuff. You walk in and I just look around. It's just like, yeah, you guys, you guys really decorated the shit out of this place, didn't you? You a no negative space in here. It's all just filled up with the most Gadi um, you know, you don't think that, you know, I like the Migos dress. That's like the Church version of that where you just can't have enough fucking precious stones and or like how those, you know, the new thing where you get a Lamborghini, then you do the fucking shiny wrap that you put around it. That's like, it wasn't enough that it was a fucking Lamborghini. Those old churches, it's like, it's not enough that you have 90 foot fucking ceilings. All right. Then you got to have a bunch of sad broken hearted people painted up there in like real gold and all of this crazy hocus pocus shit up.

Speaker 1:          00:22:34       They're like, I don't have any desire to do that, but um, you know, if there's no line, I'll poke my head in and be like, wow, wow, this old church looks exactly like every other old church. It's creepy. I feel like I'm going to catch tuberculosis because it's cold and damp in here. And uh, the vibe in here is not the vibe where good things happen. So I'm going to leave now. Um, yeah. So I'm going to, uh, I'm going to fucking ride my bike around today. Uh, like the big fucking Nancy boy that I am maybe burn a few calories. Um, I brought my little exercise bands over here cause I'm old. Uh, my shoulder feels fucking great. Uh, but I got a problem with my fucking left foot. You know, it's just always something. It's always something. I'm an old, well not old people. I'm 50. How the fuck did that happen? You know, it's actually going to be kind to be honest with six kind of a cool age to turn in a lot of ways. You know, God knows I had a bunch of friends that didn't make it this far. So how the can I sit here and bitch and I like a nice round number, you know, 30 sucked. 40 was like Whoa, 50 has been cool. Um, but I'll tell you 60 is going to crush me.

Speaker 1:          00:23:59       You know what's great about fifth? You can lie to yourself through your forties. I'm a young 40 something and blow blow 50 it's like not dude, you're fucking old. So I am old and a I'm going to embrace it. Maybe I'll start dressing a little more dapper on stage, giving myself a little pocket square, hanging out of my button down.

You have a classically beautiful place. I've always told to you, it's your cheek bones. That's where the light hits. When you go to look to the left, it's the rate in the rate lit restaurant.

Speaker 1:          00:35:06       And I'm just like, there it is. We had agreed, that's how I ended the freedom of my single life. But we had an awesome time. Less so fun. We ended up meeting up with friends who ran into a friend at the royal and gals. Uh Oh that was so fucking random. So random. There's about a hundred gift shops at the Roland Garros and we just happened to run into, but we went into the bad one. The one that everybody goes into this. Yeah, you want to go to the boutique boutique once there's an Adidas store. I saw that on the way out, but I was trying to beat the crowd. Oh, how funny was that? We're like, we gotta get away from the crowds so we can get a fucking Uber and, and I went right when everybody else went left just to, you know, get a few blocks over to, gives somebody a chance.

Speaker 1:          00:35:50       And, you know, all the streets are blocked off. And we ended up going from Roland Garros and just walked past, I thought it was a parking garage. It was another stadium. And I looked at soccer magic. Yeah. It was like, oh fuck. And then next door was another soccer stadium. I'm like, why the fuck this is like stadium row over here. Um, and of course we call the Uber and the guy couldn't come down the street and it just was a whatever it was. Yes, we did. We went out to dinner and had a lovely dinner and then we ended up meeting up with the friends that we ran into at Roland Garros plus another friend of yours plus some friends of mine. Yeah. We all met up and they, uh, it was four couples and we just ended up having this table at this cafe. Late night.

Speaker 1:          00:36:32       We shut it down when you guys sang me happy birthday. Got some champagne. Oh, it was awesome. So much fun, by the way. Do you know it's one of the only times anybody's ever sung happy birthday to me and I haven't been embarrassed. It's happened times in my life. All right. There it Royal Albert Hall. So it was twice the same birthday and then, uh, last year when I was on stage in Montreal, uh, they all sang happy, but I was one of the coolest things that ever happened to me. The crowd all saying it and the fact that they sang it to a Bruins fan that we could set aside our differences to celebrate one bald heck yeah. In that moment, you know, which gives me hope that when Donald Trump goes to talk to all the, uh, fatty fat face over there, can you, can you imagine like you'd be in that fat when all your people are starving.

Speaker 1:          00:37:29       Now granted, I know as people are starving because of our frigging embargo, they tried to make it seem like he's like a dictator. So of course he's going to be like, oh, bad and eat lobster and Doug and drink in the bathroom Hawaiian every night. We're talking about Kim Jong. Right. Keep going. You've got to have the own name. That's still rob King John and his dad was Kim Jong Il. I was going to say, imagine his wife Carmen for dinner. Ill uh, yeah. Um, Hey Kim. Jon. Hey Liz. I'm trying to tell you something. That picture that I posted of you on my Instagram for your birthday. He got over 5,000 lights. That's great. You're really into that aren't yeah. Retweets. Yes I do. I am. I'm into all of that. I'm an influencer. So honestly I'm a doer. But you want to tell the story why, why you want to tell a story, why you mock that whole influencer thing.

Speaker 1:          00:38:25       What is my story? You don't remember when we first heard the term influencer, you were going to do something and then you couldn't because they wanted influencers. Oh yeah. I was asked to be a part of the name. Any names I won't, I was asked to be a part of a storyteller shell. Um, and what was it saying? Yes. And the theme was like cultural diversity and families and stuff. So it was like, oh sure. Right up DOL we then, yeah, yeah. We have an interracial relationship. We have a biracial child is Kinda yeah I can come up with something for that. And then the person who asked me said that they had to disinvite me because they wanted more influencers. So a network wanted more infant network, wanted more influencers and you know, so they got, they replaced me with someone who had apparently more quote unquote influence and more friends and fit or whatever the fuck it is.

Speaker 1:          00:39:23       People on social media. Um, and I didn't even really dig into who this person was, but apparently they were terrible and the whole show was like kind of awkward and not that great. So it's fine. But I was so offended that I wasn't seen as an influencer when I have like, you know, I'd healthy following on Twitter and Instagram that I just decided that I was going to be an end of one of the greatest influences ever. I am an influencer. Like that's, that's the bottom line. Like I feel like at this point I don't even need to keep telling people anymore. It's just who you are coming out of your pores. Like naturally people want to be like me, so you know it's weird for some reason. I don't know, just looking for some reason I want braids right now. Well that's the thing, like if I have it, you want it and that's what an influencer does and what it is.

Speaker 1:          00:40:14       You didn't even tell me to get it. You just had it and I was like, I want that. Could you see how good it looks on me? And so you're like, wow, can I look like that? There's only way to find out. It's just to get it. And then you're like, oh I don't. But I tried and it's like that's really what it's about. That's what an influencer does. Yeah, exactly. You just exist in this space, like your own site guys. Like you are your own movement. You are your own moment. Is this something could, could you teach this to somebody else? God, no, no, no, no. You either have it or you don't. So I, if you want to become an influencer and not really quite sure what to tell you because it's like you already have sensitivity calling. Is it a, is it a gift? How would you describe like, yeah, it's just, it's, it's a state of being, you know what I mean? It's like you're just always influencing all the time, so I can't teach it. I can't explain it. Does that get taxing or tiring? It'll, you know, it really doesn't, you know, because it's like breathing.

Speaker 1:          00:41:14       You go people some inside tips on how to be a fucking influencer. Yup. I can't believe that people walked away from a, you know, you just influenced me to try to read up more on influencers. All right. Hey people, go me a send me some parish tips here. Okay. By the, did you read that thing about the wine country? The email that I forwarded you, one of our listeners wrote in maybe. When did you send that? Evidently, I'm not an influencer. Just an email from your husband's. This is wine country. You know you'd make that one, wouldn't you? At least open.

Speaker 1:          00:41:55       I know you don't open the ones that I send you that they have the subject. Are You mad at me? All right. Paris chips. They still write into the the junk box, right? No fogging dredge or were there, hey, thank you for the best birthday. That was the best birthday I've, I've ever had. I've had two back to back. Last year was the, uh, was the selfish one where I was, I was in Montreal and I went to an f one race who I don't even know who won that the Lewis Hamilton went. And again, I got to look that up a little behind here. Um, but this year was the best. Uh, all right. You know what he's about the song happy birthday. It's really long and it almost sounds like people making fun of you. Happy bird days as a year, red douche bag.

Speaker 1:          00:42:49       And then in the end it's always speech speech. So I actually, I thought what I said at Royal Albert Hall was really nice and I was like, I did it, I got through it, knocked it out, thanked everybody and I'm done. And then as I'm walking away, people would go speech, speech and I know, and then I go to, like I said, just fucking gave one. I still didn't get angry. Let me love God I Paris chips. Hey Bill, I am a fan from Perry or you were visiting our lovely city. This is my French accent. Uh, make sure that you start by Lik comp twice in Sasha Ma, uh, Metro Audi on as we get off for a nice meal. Then take your lovely lady to the cafe Laurel in Rue dauphine for a late drink and some jazzy entertainment. It sounds good. They have a nice garden where you can smoke a cigar and sip on some scotch. Slash. Wine. Also, don't learn French. It's useless. Better learn Chinese as fed. Uh, enjoy your stay and go fuck yourself. Let's go do that. All right. Thank you. Thank you for that tip. Now I want to try it. Was that gay an influencer? He's more an informative informer.

Speaker 1:          00:44:09       Can we please label everybody that fucking, he's a suggestion. Uh, it wasn't yesterday. That'd be funny if that was an no, I am not. I am not a suggestion. I was mute. I am a presenter. I was presenting information that you can do. You know, I mean, it was a suggestion. That's really what it was. Not Bad. It does adjust things. But here's a, even in this age of me too. Hey, I suggest you come over here, your honor. It was just a suggestion. My sausage, um, crazy lawsuit co crazy war suit. All right. Hey there Billy birthday cake. Wondering if your friends in the comic community pass this onto you. Oh, please don't be performed getting sued and, Oh, oh, this is the one. You know what? I'm going to go take a shower, take a shower. I say take a shower and something do.

Speaker 1:          00:45:02       Shh. Um, all right. Wondering if your, uh, friends in the comic community of Wa of why influence our, uh, wondering if your friends in the comic community past this Auntie backstory, this guy, oh my God, he touched my hair and then you hit a, this gay Maddix like the TV show who started a page in the 90s called the best page in the universe. Um, he became famous for calling out Christopher Reeves for not caring about paraplegics till he became one himself. Well, I mean, Jesus Christ, if that, of all the things to call people out on, uh, basically lambasted him for being a selfish piece of shit. Jesus Christ, I don't understand. He never sold me on the aggressive manner of heating Reeves. The only way he kick, he does this without looking like an asshole. It's as if he was also in a wheelchair, you know, and lived at the top of a flight of stairs or shit and nobody never made a ramp for him.

Speaker 1:          00:46:15       Then I could see him being mad at Christopher Reeves, but even then it would still be misdirected. It's still should be aimed at people like myself that didn't go over there and help build them a fucking ramp anyways, but I appreciate it. A different point of view on topics. No one questioned and so I had, okay, I, but I appreciate a different point of view on topics. No one questioned and so I had some respect for this. He also had a post called something like I can draw better than your kids and then posted pictures kids made and trash them. All right. I like this guy now because this guy is just being a cunt. Um, he's just this guy. Maybe he's the original troller I like it. He goes, that was like 15 years ago. I hadn't heard of him since college until I read about this lawsuit. Apparently this same guy who made a career trolling the people on a personal level across the Internet became offended by a comic who decided to troll him. Oh No, no. We had no sense of humor about himself. Or is this more trolling? Is this gay? The Andy Kaufman of the Internet. He sued the comic for $20 million, which is basically way to bankrupt the comic for whatever little he had the judge essentially throughout the case. Um,

Speaker 1:          00:47:30       on the advent of your 50th birthday, I just want to thank you for not turning into a huge hypocrite like Maddix I'll do it. I'm one of the most hypocritical people you're ever gonna meet him doing yoga, meditating and then flipping out. Cause I, cause I lost my ticket.

Speaker 3:          00:47:45       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:47:46       Saying this whole system is fucking stupid. You teach, really build this system that makes sure that when you get to your seats, some mother fucking assholes not sitting in it. You fucked up, take your medicine. And I didn't act like a big fucking baby. Um, even if he thought he was being wrong, he should have taken it like a man realized that he had to come. And after years doing the same thing to others, you don't feel like this is the final act of his performance. And now he's gotten you up in arms. Uh, you're a fewer years older than me and I've definitely taken a page on your book in terms of allowing myself to stay true to who I am, but also allowing myself to grow into a more well rounded person. I'm an ONA saying, oh hey, from back in the day, and it's my favorite content ever.

Speaker 1:          00:48:29       But when I see comments online that sounded like they came from the crowd at the virus tour, I just feel bad for these miserable cunts. Thanks for everything and happy birthday. All right. That went a little left there. But I know what you mean about the, that happens with everything by the way, not just fans of the OB. And Anthony showed this, I mean go on Youtube, there's always going to be then the initial thing that you like and then you look at the comments and I forget what comic did that bit, but he was just like, you know,

Speaker 3:          00:48:59       yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:48:59       You scroll down like three or four comments before it spins into like somebody dropping the n word or some, you know, thanks a lot. Oh Bama. Like somehow that'll be watching like slap fights. At least that's the shit that I watched, which I do not understand those for the life of me. First of all.

Speaker 3:          00:49:19       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:49:21       The fact that if they hit your ear, what that's gonna do to your hearing, you know? Do you know that was a thing that like, I got to look this up. Moms used to do that. That was like a disciplinarian thing back in the day. You've blocked she mothers box.

Speaker 3:          00:49:38       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:49:39       Boxing their children's. This is too specific. I don't think I'll get anything. Ears. They would just, you know, it was like killer con how he used to do that. That scream well Ha. Oh Man. Just hit your boxing the ears. Okay. Boston hears the other Victorians. Uh, Anthony. Joshua says there's nothing wrong with parents giving them which one should I click on here? World champion boxer answer. You just said there's nothing wrong with parents giving their children a clip around the ear. Boxing child's ears can cause deafness. Yes it can.

Speaker 3:          00:50:19       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:50:22       That's, look, this one up here.

Speaker 3:          00:50:24       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:50:24       Oh, unable to open this because of legal. The fuck does that mean all right. Boxing ears. Let's see if this one will open up. Come on, come on. Come on. There we go. All right. A phrase sick, confused me while reading Alice's adventures in wonderland was the rabbits explanation of why the Queen Order the Dutch is to be executed in chapter eight.

Speaker 3:          00:50:48       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:50:48       What of I've never seen Alice in wonderland is a queen in Dutchess and all this shit. People get an executed. I, you know some, do you know why? I think there's so much death in old fairy tales, the original ones, because so many people just fucking died back then anyway. So it really was a part of life. Um, the rabbit, it, I mean it's still a part of life, but it's way down the fucking road. But everybody had like a brother who died of like a fucking appendix, ruptured appendix or some Shit, get some sort of flu. Ah, all right. The rabbit explains to Alice, she boxed the Queen's ears. The actions of boxing is, is something I had never heard of. So I decided to look into the meaning of the term. I found that boxing of ears is a hard simultaneous slap of both of yours.

Speaker 1:          00:51:34       Yeah. The violent act was a popular form of child punishment during the Victorian era. Oh my God. In an 1878 issue of the London reader of literature, science, art, and general information, the punishment of boxing ears is debated. The article warms is 1878 people like, dude, what the fuck are we doing here? Uh, for not only his deafness caused by boxes, which ruptures as they continually do. The drum of the ear, but the inflammation of the internal cavity, which is so frequent, a result maybe followed by disease of the bone giving rise to absent two abscess of the brain and having a fatal termination. I liked how they took pick the euphemism. They're around the same. Your Kid's gonna fucking die. The article explains its school is suffering from the chastisement by school masters and fears as noted above, that the effects of the slabs may be longterm. I swear to fucking God, if my, if I ever had a teacher that boxed my ears.

Speaker 3:          00:52:35       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:52:36       Oh my God. I mean, how angry were children back then? Oh my God. Like I literally have to walk away from this article.

Speaker 3:          00:52:45       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:52:46       Oh Man. I wish there was, you know, some fucking kid back then, just fucking snapped was just big enough. You know,

Speaker 1:          00:52:58       it just beat the shit out of his teacher and boxed is years, like nine times. Made him a deaf fucking bastard. Um, yeah. So whenever I watch, she'll slap fights. It's just like, you're going to make somebody deaf. They put something in their ear. Forget about just taking a concussion for no goddamn reason. I mean, well they'll slap fight competitions like what is the fucking prize money? Um, anyways, continuing on a Bayer and Monsanto. Whoa. Jesus didn't, uh, I guess see what time I've done here. 53 minutes. All right. It didn't, Monsanto changes her name like Jefferson airplane or some shit. Um, bear and Monsanto. Hey there, you over the counter cunt. So bare and Monsanto are merging and reminded me of the time you mentioned an article where bare admitted to knowing and allowing the distribution of some aids infected shit found the article full. This sounds official. First of all came from me and then you just drive the Arctic. The subject of the article as aids infected shit. Well let's check out the link. It is from CBS news.com. So all right. Bear admits he had paid millions and HIV infection cases just not in English. Oh my God,

Speaker 1:          00:54:20       dude, I swear to God. At what point, how much money do you have to pay politicians where they feel like they have enough money and they don't need the corporate dollar and that they can actually start to dismantle or a restructure.

Speaker 3:          00:54:36       Okay,

Speaker 1:          00:54:36       these corporations, these corporations are going to kill us. Not Isis, not fuck it. The Russians. None of this fucking shit. All right. When I say kill us, I mean no human beings left are going to be the result of because of corporations. All right, and what, how they view people, how they view the environment, how they view money in their whole idea of, of what is a is worth. I mean, I know I've just never heard a corporation ever been like, you know what the, the, the, the costs to innocent people or the environment is too high for us to do that. Maybe they do. It'd be refreshing if you have an article like that that wasn't actually written by someone from that corporation that's aligned. All right. Turn to the read the English speaking media. You'd never know that bear just paid tens of millions of dollars to end a three decade long scandal in which the company sold HIV contaminated blood products to hemophilia x thousands of whom later died of AIDS. They just killed thousands of fucking people or admitted to it. But that doesn't mean they actually said that they did it. You know, that fucking legal thing. Um, ironically bears new hemophilia who feel your iPhone app got some coverage ads. Did bears hemophilia research grant, are they covering their tracks? So the University of Florida go gators, but you have to pick through the French and Italian news media to find out that bear is finally writing checks to people who got aids.

Accuse them of having sold in the 1980s blood products contaminated with HIV. A source close to deal told him. So did it. Was it that they knew that it had HIV in it or did they just went to high risk people to get blood? The figure of tens of billions of euros and compensation is not totally wrong. She had a bear in the U S company. Baxter are the two main parties to the agreement. She said accompanies folks versus said, however, the company accepts no responsibility in this case and continues to insist and it always acted responsibly and ethically. That's how they get out of it. It's like, all right, we'll admit that we did that shit. If you say it wasn't our fault and that we always behaved above board. You know what that's like? That's like when they send somebody to jail and innocent person to jail and then they're like, all right, we're going to let you out. But the only way we can let you out as if you sign this paper saying you won't sue us because we fucked up.

Speaker 3:          00:58:02       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:58:04       Anyways, found the article. I just read some of it. They're still in business. Sell is still in business. Can't bring down bear. That's our medicine. But maybe our food supply. Nope. Then you got, I don't know what this guy's talking about now.

Huh? You got room in the chopper for me. Bill just goes all over the place. All right. And why did Obama sue that sign that, so that, why did he sign that bill? Everybody? Is it because he's a Ultibro targe snow flake or whatever people getting wears a blue tie or is it because he's grossly underpaid for his fucking job and is, and I bet those guys funded is fucking campaign, so then he had to do them a solid, it's all the same shit.

Speaker 1:          00:59:03       They all make 500 grand a year and then come out of office worth hundreds of millions of whatever, fucking 70 80 million bucks. How does that happen, everybody? Although recently I saw Bill Clinton when that fucking piece of shit brought up the me too thing. You know Monica Lewinsky, I let all, they tried to make that a me too thing. You know what I mean? It's like she was in her twenties she was a college graduate. She never learned that she, she is what I was saying on stage. She never learned that you shouldn't blow a married guy in his house with his wife and kid down the fucking hall. She didn't know that. Now she's coming back being influenced by his power and it was UPI pool people. We get the fuck Outta here. You are a driven young adults who somehow in your 20s got a job in the fucking White House.

Speaker 1:          00:59:52       Okay. You weren't some dope. He founded a bus station I near um, some of them Monica Lewinsky thing where now that she's trying to like turn it around that he used his power and influence. It's like you are a college graduate working in the White House. Right. I don't know. I thought we had dealt with all of that. All right. I know. And he got punished for it, but in that thing he said Clinton was like, I left the White House. I was $16 million in debt. You know what I mean? He's a if that's true. I think he's the only fucking president ever did that. Oh Geez. She's, she's getting ready for nap time. All right. Um, big band drumming, tear belt. I'm 17 years old and I played drums every day. That's awesome. It's my life and I'm in every band, jazz concert and marching. Good man. And I play percussion for the chorus and for the school place.

Speaker 1:          01:00:47       Kenny Aronoff is my hair. Well that I was going to say that sounds like his autobiography. Uh, how he started out. Thank you for that dream interview. I have it on a playlist with music. That's how much I listened to it. Oh, let's go. I'm glad you liked it. You know Nia not for nothing. People say actually do a good interview. Oh yeah. Kenny Aronoff to Danica Patrick to my lovely wife. You know, I set you guys up. No, no, let you guys, you know, I love it over the plate. I learned that by going on [inaudible]. That's what he does. He mean Andrew, they, they just, they just lob it over to you. All right. Andy Richter, my day was telling me about, my dad was telling me about the scar movement in the 90s I just watched swingers and discovered this band, squirrel nut zippers. Oh my God. It takes you back to your college days.

Speaker 1:          01:01:47       It's really takes me back to my early thirties and I was in my late twenties. It's really different than anything I've heard. I discovered that I don't like all Scott, but I like these guys cause it's more big band. And Scott, I really think you, uh, enjoy the drumming. It's really a cool mix between big Ben drumming punk in almost some primus type drumming stuff because of the time work. Uh, did you get ever get into any of that? I remember that big bad voodoo daddy and that type of stuff. I liked it a little bit, but I was a little too old at that point. That was actually kids music to me. Um, this is what our lovely daughter does. Before afternoon nap, she screamed bloody murder. Um, and then falls asleep. No one talks to herself when she calms down and then falls asleep. Anyways, I doubt this will get read because it's too nerdy, but maybe just maybe thanks for the laughs.

Speaker 1:          01:02:41       Oh, Billy rim shot. Um, no, I like all that stuff. I mean, I liked when Robert Plant was Jesus. I liked when Robert Plant did that. The honeyed represent with Paul Shaffer. Um, I've always liked big bands and that type of stuff and I really liked the way all of that music is the squirrel nut zippers and all that. I just liked the way it was produced. It sounded really live. And um, and also, you know, when you get that many people in a band and they can all play, it's, it's always sounds great. So was awesome. Oh, big diversity today. He was also in swingers. Okay. I did not know that. Um, where Mike and Jon Favreau goes, Oh yeah. Dancing with Heather Graham. Oh yeah, they were, uh, they were great. They are great, I should say. Right. What did they forget how to play? All right. Being rude to wait staff.

Speaker 1:          01:03:36       All right. Hey there. Billy bath salts. Your receipt. Talking about Nia being slightly rude to wait staff and it made me a hit of word got cut off something, a podcast. I've heard years back about raising kids. Essentially a group of economists gave their opinions on what you can and can't change in children's supported with studies and evidence. One person suggests with evidence that there are only a small number of habits that kids pick up from their parents. Those adverts are drinking, alcohol, smoking and how we treat others, waitstaff, family, et cetera. Well, those are kind of big things. As a former bartender who's dealt with incredibly rude patrons, I would love to hear you and Nia debate if she is actually being rude or not. If she feels she's not being rude, would she be okay if she saw her daughter treating a family member the way she treats waitstaff?

Speaker 1:          01:04:32       Absolutely. She would love the can't wait to hear her thoughts. Here's a link to a podcast as a new dad. I think you'll dig it. Have a great summer and I hope you get sunburned. You some of them bitch. Um, Nia, do you feel as an influencer, why can't you just influence them to make better, better service? I am not rude. I just, and something goes wrong. I just let them know and I'm direct about it. I'm not like, I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry I don't do that. Cause what am I apologizing for? Unlike no out of this. Can you change it? Thank you. That's it. What do I had to, I had to do with like, do you want me to fucking blow the waiter because he did something wrong? Like he's blowing me. No, I'm just saying control a little sugar on it.

Speaker 1:          01:05:24       In the end I feel like I'm very sugary. I'm not, no, don't take it badly right now. Like, no, it's quite that you did one time it was cold and you said, can you have them go back and heat to Stephanie's? You, Oh my God, I'm so sorry. You and you like, yeah. Cause it's like, yeah. As they went to take it away and I was just like, Jesus. You remember everybody was at the table like God to have Nia? No. Everybody who was everybody at the table was, I got Dan. Dan would have been family. No, that didn't happen. Nope, I don't mean, yeah, I don't remember it. So maybe it did happen, but like, I don't remember it. Maybe it did happen. That was hilarious. What the fuck was that? That didn't happen. I don't remember that. Yeah. Maybe it did happen. I don't recall ever being, behaving in such a manner that it would be like, so was so freaked out. You're adorable. And even when you lied. Um,

Speaker 3:          01:06:24       okay.

Speaker 1:          01:06:25       Yeah. Um, I, I go the other way. I'm too nice and we'll eat fucking whatever the fuck they send me. You don't see you when they send me the wrong thing, I still eat it because I don't want, because I don't want them to throw it out. Oh, who's this? I'm going to throw it out. They might put it to the side and maybe somebody lunch and the kitchen later on. Oh No. Yeah. You're telling me if somebody brought a plate of food out into public and they said that's not what I wanted and brought it back, he'd be like, oh, fucking eat it. Somebody might, well, how do you know they haven't put their fucking mouth on? It was like, oh, this isn't Ravioli. This is French toast. I thought it looked weird. And then you go over there and you get the old breakfast. Herpes. Um, all right. That's the podcast. I get to find out why my lovely little boob bears a crying downstairs. Oh, she's phones. Oh, shoot. In the bedroom.

Speaker 3:          01:07:18       Yeah.
