Speaker 1:          00:00:01       Hey, what's going on? It's bill burn his time for the Thursday afternoon, just before Friday, Monday morning podcast and just checking in on you. I'm just checking in on you. Um, I have no life. I don't know what to talk about. I got no fucking life, man. We're just right in this God damn show, having a great time doing it, of course. But, uh, I just stay in a writer's room and I stare at a computer screen all day long and, uh, my eyes were killing me yesterday. Uh, I started looking around the room and I noticed, I think I'm the only one in the room that doesn't wear glasses.

Speaker 1:          00:00:38       That's like a, that's like earning your stripes as a writer, as you are. You actually, you wear glasses that, and you can do that thing where you, you know, you spend the fucking pen around your finger and you can catch it. You know, those, you know, friend of mine always said mathletes could always do that, you know, but, um, anyways, I'm going to do some standup this weekend. Uh, we just, uh, we just did the table read for episode two. Uh, Dave Kepner came in and just crushed it as Bob Pogo is fucking awesome. And, uh, you know, that's probably my most favorite thing about the week, uh, is doing the table reads because it's, it feels like doing stand up in front of a la live like crowd for those of you not in the business. It's basically after you write the thing, you sit down and before you record it, you basically, you do it in front of a bunch of people, um, who've invested in the show.

Speaker 1:          00:01:30       So they're hoping it's funny, but if it isn't funny, they're not going to laugh. So if they, if you get them laughing, if you get industry industry, people laugh and that's always a big thing. So we had a great table read some very excited about that. Um, and um, anyways, but that's not what I want to talk about here today. I got to tell you something I found the other day, uh, when I was on youtube. Um, any wrestling fans out there? Ah, anybody old like me used to watch fucking Tony, Gloria and Larry's at Bisco. Ivan put ski and Bulldog Brower and Pat Patterson and Ted dibiase the Internet intercontinental champion. You know dusty Rhodes. Mr Fuji, Mr [inaudible], the moon dogs.

Speaker 2:          00:02:17       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:02:17       George the animal Steele superstar. Billy Graham. Bob Backlund, Bruno Sammartino. Greg to Hammer Valentine. I can't remember how many these fucking guys are still remember Tony Atlas?

Speaker 2:          00:02:31       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:02:32       Jimmy superfly snuck up. I still remember that finishing moves. Tony Atlas would just fucking basically do a military press with you. He just pick you up over his head and he fucking throw you right Andre. The giant would just put his giant fucking size 48 foot. You throw you off the ropes and just stick it right in your face and he'd sit on ya. I've been put ski, had the Polish Hammer. Greg Valentine had to figure four leg lock. That's the first time ever throw out my back. This kid when I was in fourth grade, showed me how to do the figure four leg lock by putting me into it and it was fucking killing my knee and I was trying to get up to, to get my free, my leg from putting pressure on my kneecap. And as the first time I fucked up my lower back that have bad backs since the lower, since the, uh, bad, lower back since the, uh, the fourth grade.

Speaker 3:          00:03:21       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:03:23       Chief Jay Strongbow would do the fucking rain dance. That wasn't too fucking racist was it? Once he did that, he went into this crazy fucking, he couldn't feel pain anymore and then he kicked the shit out of you. Uh, all right. Enough of that shit. So I was just looking at some of the old restaurants, um, stuff that I used to watch, SD Jones, special delivery Jones, the guy never fucking one. He was the most coolest fucking guy ever.

Speaker 3:          00:03:48       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:03:51       Anyways, Mr Wonderful, Rowdy Roddy Piper. I fucking love all those guys. So anyways, um, I was, I never heard of this before, but you have it. Those of you who aren't fans of wrestling, and there's this thing called a shoot match, which is basically, you know, wrestling, it's sports entertainment. When I was a kid they used to argue that it was real. And then finally they said no it's fake. But, but what was great was once they said it was fake, they could actually talk about all the real pain that they go through. So I was kind of just watching some youtube videos about that and I came across this stuff called his shoot match. So I was like, what the hell is this shoot match in a shoot match is basically a wrestling match where they're fake fighting and then somebody gets pissed at somebody else and it becomes a real fight. And what usually happens from the few that I saw is if the person's just not a complete roid roided up psycho.

Speaker 3:          00:04:52       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:04:54       What it really is is either somebody is not selling your moves, like I'm fake punching you and you're just acting like it's not hurting. So you making me look like an asshole or somebody, you know, you are, you're allowing somebody to throw you and do a move and they botch it and fuck, fuck you up in hurt you and then you get mad. Um, I saw one with this guy. This kid was new when he went to to execute some fucking throw, and this guy was just a psycho. He didn't look like he landed that bad and he got up and just beat the fuck out of this guy. Just threw him head first out of the ring. The guy landed on his fucking head and we immediately had a concussion. Then he picked the guy up and threw him into the metal stairs and this guy kept selling.

Speaker 1:          00:05:37       I guess he didn't have to sell the moves at that point, but that one was fucking brutal. But the funniest one. But she got to see, and I'm having a link to it. It's the great Antonio verse, Antonio. I hope I say it right. So he doesn't come over and slapped the shit out of me. I knocky. I'm a Japanese guy. So the Great Antonio is this, I can't even describe what he looks like. He looks like a fucking troll with a page boy haircut and he's just ridiculously fat and he's wearing the ugliest mustard colored yellow light sweat pants with these military boots on. I'm just not a good looking person. And he's a wrestling, this guy, Antonio Anakie, who's a Japanese guy who looks like a fucking movie star, you know, he's got the old school movie star Chin, he's got the Jack Lord Hawaii five o fucking haircut.

Speaker 1:          00:06:34       He's in great shape. So they start fucking wrestling and a Raslan and you know, the Japanese guy is, is being a fucking professional and the Great Antonio who I guess had a reputation for not selling people's moves and being selfish in the ring, you know, the Japanese guy would punch him in his fat stomach and he wouldn't even move. And then the f the fat that it would keep like punching his stomach like it's hard as a rock. And people were laughing in the crowd. The fucking guy, like the Japanese guy throws him off the fucking ropes and the guy just sort of stops, you know and doesn't sell the fucking move. And the Japanese guys looking at him like what the fuck? And the crowds laughing. He starts seeing the Japanese dude looking at him like, dude, what the fuck? It's a long story short, they get a few minutes into the round, the Japanese guy has been selling everything the fat fuck's doing the fat fucks making the Japanese guy look like an idiot.

Speaker 1:          00:07:28       So fat fuck gets the Japanese guy against the ropes and he's punching almost like the back of this guy's neck. Super fucking hard. And the guy takes like three of them before he finally like blocks the fourth one and then he just snaps like, dude, what? Like fuck this. And he just stands up and just open hands, slap this fat fuck in the head is hard as you possibly can. And the Fed pageboy guy like turns his head, it's fucking phenomenal. And the Japanese guys going like go making those like come on, let's fucking fight. And the Fed fuck still kind of like thinking he's just going to take one. He slaps him in the fucking head again, then grabs his leg, Japanese do just snaps, fucking throws him on his belly, boats them in the fucking head right now the ref is going like, whoa, whoa, hey, whoa.

Speaker 1:          00:08:18       The fat fucks crawling around like a dog. And the Japanese guy boots him in the head again. Now the fat guy is like fucking plank and he's laying down on the ground and the Japanese guy boots him in the head like another fucking six times. It's almost attempted murder. The fucking dude is a bloody mess. They finally just called a match and um, it was one of the great pieces of justice I ever saw. I didn't feel bad for the guy at all when he was getting voted in the head. I was dying laughing. If you saw how hard this does, fat fuck was punching this poor Japanese guy in the back of his neck and he, that guy taking it like a pro and finished. Finally, he was just like, what the, cause it was all, he was like, he was hitting him for real.

Speaker 1:          00:09:01       Um, and he wasn't selling his moves. So you got, I'm, I'm going to, um, have a link for it. If anybody else has some good ones up there. I, it's just a whole new part of Youtube that, uh, you know, if you're at work, if you're bored right now, just look it up yourself. Shoot matches. S h o o t matches and uh, there's just some legendary ones and um, you know, as much as they talked to wrestlers and stuff, like I don't, I never hear him, you know, I always hear, you know, about doing the road and these, these great matches that they had. And then of course they talk about, you know, you know, people get in the sickness, you know, getting addicted to painkillers and drugs and all that shit. They do all that type of shit. But, um, nobody talks about all these fucking wrestling matches out there that, uh, suddenly, um, that's suddenly became real, you know, so, um, I dunno. I hope you enjoy it. That's all I could say. But anyway, so let's get back to, uh, let's get back to the podcast. So basically everything that I'm going to be talking about over the next couple of months, it's going to be whatever I look out the window and see while we're writing emphasis for family.

Speaker 1:          00:10:07       So anyways, um, yeah, the day we're in the writer's room actually yesterday and all of a sudden we just hear like this fucking commotion, right? And we look out our windows in, there's all these protesters just walking down the fucking taking up like a street, you a lane of the street, like, uh, you know, like bike riders do now. You know what I mean? When they ride down the street, if there's two of them rather than riding single file, they ride side by side because they want to talk and you know, fuck the 50 cars that are behind him. Oh. And then by the way, if they actually get hit, it's this major fucking tragedy. Like, oh my God can, can you fucking believe that happened? Yes, I can totally believe that happened completely. A bicycle is simply a motorcycle without an engine. That's what you're riding around on it.

Speaker 1:          00:10:57       But I know you dressed up like you're in the Tour de France, you know, you feel in a little European like that dude and breaking away. Maybe you're speaking in Italian and you kind of forget that you're riding a bicycle out in the street in Los Angeles home to arguably some of the worst drivers on the planet. All right? And I've always gone off on technology and Shit and saying, I don't like it. Saying like we had enough technology somewhere around the early nineties we should have stopped right about there. You let people die off. Stop trying to cure fucking diseases. Stop. Make a new technology that everybody has to go out and go buy. Let's just stop right fucking here. Okay. I mean, take you remember the early nineties it was fucking great. It was fine. Cars for fast enough. Everything was fine. He didn't have to go any further than that.

Speaker 1:          00:11:45       Wasn't it better when everybody wasn't on the fucking Internet? I think it was. Even though I'm sitting here on the Internet right now, I'd be willing to walk away from this shit. It's a great time. Everything you did wasn't filmed. It wasn't fucking recorded. There wasn't some satellite point in that. You're tracking you down the street as you try to get to a dairy queen, but also the Illuminati can fucking take you out cause they probably own that satellite, you know, turn on some chip in your car and make it drive into a fucking tree. You know, make white people. These are very mainstream stories here. Um, anyways, um, these fucking proud. They must have had a permit because it was a cop in front of them in behind them and they're just walking down the street and I got to tell you something. All right, I'm all for the working man.

Speaker 1:          00:12:29       I'm all for that type of shit. But the second you go out in the fucking street and you start blocking traffic, I don't give a shit. If you trying to save babies, I hate you and I want to, I want to rent a cement truck and run you over. Like I was sitting in an office. They weren't causing me any trouble and just the empathy that I had for the people trying to drive around them made me want somebody to just fish tail into the fucking crowd. So if you've ever been in a protest, let me ask you this question.

Speaker 2:          00:12:59       Is it

Speaker 1:          00:13:00       the objective to not only call attention to whatever it is you're complaining about, but then don't you want people to

Speaker 2:          00:13:09       listen

Speaker 1:          00:13:11       and then be like, Oh wow, I didn't know that was going on. You know, so why would you annoy the shit out of everybody by like clogging up traffic? To me, it's no different than fucking terrorists. A lot of times whatever terrorist are bitching about, I'm like, yeah, I could. I totally understand why you're upset about that, but the then go and blow up a bunch of innocent people. I'm just like, yeah, but that's not the way you solve it. Right. My office simplifying this. It's like we don't fly over there and drop bombs it, oops. Did that land on your baby? Yeah, we were trying to get the bad guy. Sorry. Your baby was within a 30 mile radius. I Dunno. Um, anyways, do you guys have that? Do you have, do you have like, like I actually enjoy riding a bike, but, uh, I'm an old school bike rider.

Speaker 1:          00:14:01       Like I ride up on the sidewalk. I don't wear a helmet. Um, you know, I don't ride 90 miles an hour down the sidewalk and I don't care when people who walk on the sidewalk give me a fucking dirty look. It's just like, I'm not going out there. I'm not going out there and traffic because I know everybody out there is like me and they're texting while they're driving or they're fucking air drumming. You know, God knows how many people are out there on prescription pills. To go out there on a fucking motorcycle without an engine is, is really fucking stupid.

Speaker 2:          00:14:34       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:14:34       Yeah. And um, I feel like this thing was like bike riders. They have this thing where they feel like they're these victims and uh, I, I find them way, way more hostile.

Speaker 2:          00:14:47       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:14:48       Considering the position that they're in and they had this whole fucking, you will respect me and I have just as much as of right to be out here. What should do you do? I mean, even though there is no bike lane, they just painted, painted a bicycle on the fucking street so they could get the federal grant. That's the reason why they do that shit. Right. And then, uh, you know, all right, so you have a right to be out there, but then you have to obey the rules of the road. And 99% a year, don't, when's the last time you saw a guy in a bicycle actually stop at a fucking red light? They never do. They never do. They fucking look both ways. They fucking glide right through the fucking thing. And then if they get hit, then they frost the bicycle. Like, oh, can you believe that happened?

Speaker 1:          00:15:28       What a poor baby. Um, I dunno. I have to tell you the people who ride bicycles out here and in Los Angeles or ride their fucking minds and I am so anti those fucking cars that are going to drive themselves. Um, until I go on the highways out here in Los Angeles, I'm just like, you know what? I really think it should be. I think if you, if you suck at driving, they should just take your right to drive away. You can still have a car, but the car will drive for you because you suck at it. You know what I mean? But I think if you're actually a decent driver, you should then be allowed to continue driving. So I think if you got rid of people who suck the driving right off the bat, conservatively speaking, I'd say that's at least 30% of drivers, you know?

Speaker 1:          00:16:15       And then I think that middle, you know, 30 the 35%, we'll just have the option because there's a lot of people that are actually decent and driving. But if they're like, dude, if I could just fucking take a nap and just sleep on the way to work for 45 minutes and just wake up when I there, I would rather do that. So you figure it, at least half of them are going to do it initially and then a half of those halfs are going to be like, well he has a self driving car. I I, you know, grass is always greener. I want one of those two. And then I think you'll just basically get down to 18% of people that she truly enjoyed driving and we'll get our own lane book. This is my, my drink, we get our own lane, we get to drive as fast as we want.

Speaker 1:          00:16:59       And you guys had just all in robot cars, you know, and then everybody who actually still continues to drive, those are the people that, you know, when they're the first guy to make a left, they get way out to the intersection. They feel a sense of responsibility that two cars behind them, we'll make it. Those types of people. You know, those people that, that realized the further left you go, the faster you go. And if somebody is on your bumper, you don't slam on the brakes, she get over, that person's, obviously I'm in more of a here a hurry than you are. You fucking let them go. Those were, that's probably 18% of drivers. Wouldn't you say you like how I just paid it myself as the fucking heroin, all that. Oh yeah. I'm one of the guys. I'm one of the guys that knows how to do the things correctly.

Speaker 1:          00:17:39       Um, anyways, I hope this hasn't been too quiet. Let's plow ahead here. Um, I am over. Oh, by the way, I'm over the whole fucking Tom Brady. I actually have a buddy of mine that works in the, uh, I can't say where he works, but just he basically broke it down and say, listen, this is not a personal thing against the Patriots. What it is is this is a corporation thing versus the employees. And if the corporation says this is what's going to happen in the employee is able to go around that, then they get then that you got the nuts running in the nuthouse. So basically Tom Brady was acquitted of any sort of cheating, but this second trial, yes, he was look it up. This second trial was, or at very least he was never convicted of that. Um, this second trial was, was more about does a corporation have a right to discipline its employees?

Speaker 1:          00:18:34       So you know what happened to Tom Brady outside in the real world, in the United States of America, it wouldn't even have made it to trial. All right, but with the lack of fucking evidence that yeah, they had, okay. The, on the other side, um, you have within a corporation, a corporation operates the way a corporation operates. So they should be allowed to run there. But that's what it was about. Are we as a corporation allowed to discipline our employees? Are they able to go outside the corporation? Are we going to have to fucking deal with that? And it was a big deal for the suits in the NFL to win that because if Tom Brady wins that thing, then every fucking suspension a player could simply take it outside of the NFL and it really, um, whittles down the level of power that they have. So I got to actually be honest with you, I actually understand now I understand why the NFL did that.

Speaker 1:          00:19:35       And you know, if they got to throw Tom Brady under the fucking bus than so be it. Now I know a lot of you guys out there think I'm skirting the fucking issue as far as like, oh, he deflated. I'm not saying it didn't deflate the fucking ball, but that's not why the colts lost by 35 fucking points. I said, this is Zillion fucking times. You know, Andrew Luck shouldn't even be on the colts. The colts actually tried the season before he was available in the draft, but they tanked the whole fucking season. And um, I dunno, just the amount of attention that Tom Brady gets versus, you know, you know, have an HGH delivered to your fucking house in your wife's name. And then you sit there in front of the Superbowl media for two weeks and it's not even brought up. And then you quote Forrest Gump and ride off into the sunset and then everybody's cool with it.

Speaker 1:          00:20:24       Um, whatever, that's all I would have. What the fuck are you gonna do? So anyways, plowing ahead here. Plowing ahead. Um, let me do it. Read a little bit of advertising here and then I'm going to get the fuck out of here and go stare at a computer screen. All God Damn Day. Um, on it. Everybody.

How many are I read these last two later? I'll tell you, I read them later, you know, um, oh, congratulations to the meet me in St Louis. Louis meet me at the fair St Louis Blues, got the job done. Um, what a fucking huge one for that city. Um, that's always great to see that, but it was instantly also depressing not to see Chicago when it, because uh, then need, you don't get to watch, you know, all the great players that they have, tapes, cane, Dunkin keys and all those guys. Um, it's weird to see the Black Hawks and the kings out in the first round and look who's coming up on the outside. Now this French sake of San Jose sharks, the fucking, I mean their logo should literally be somebody choking on a piece of fucking steak.

Speaker 1:          00:25:30       You know, I don't know why steak but just choking on something. I don't think you could find a team that's won more hockey games and left in the first round or just not want a cup. I don't know what it is about the San Jose sharks. I just don't have any sympathy for them or their fucking fence. I don't know why. I think it has to do with that teal color that they have. You know, maybe it's cause the kings got rid of their, their fucking, you know, royal colors, the Laker colors that they had and they took basically black, white and gray because you know, you'd think the sharks would have like a gray looking uniform. You think if you had, like, if he came up with a killer name, like the sharks, like that animal, that fish there was just sitting there on the table.

Speaker 1:          00:26:18       Because you know, you know the deal with sports teams, there's, there's only so many ferocious fucking animals to pick from. You know, and then once that goes out the window, then you kind of got to talk about like the jobs people do. Like a, with the packers. Yeah. Everybody pack stuff up here and where the fucking these guys or those guys, you know, and then when you're really out of names, that's when you start naming teams after like weather, right? The higher change, the heat, the thunder, right. The mysteries, whatever the fuck you come, flurries the Florida flurries, that wouldn't make sense. It doesn't snow down there. Um, Florida Sun showers, it's just really going to be bad. That's why you can't go beyond 30 teams and he's fucking leak, you know, or 32, I guess that's where we're up to. But sharks was just sitting there, just sitting there on the table.

Speaker 1:          00:27:11       And I remember thinking like, Oh wow, the shocks, it's a great name. I can't wait to see that uniform. And it was like, bump, bump a bomb. Ooh, it's a shark. And he's biting a hockey stick and half. Well, yeah, then you're going to get a penalty for, for slashing and today's Nhl, right. Second, the stick breaks automatically. Um, I'm sorry. I don't know. I don't know what it is. I just don't, uh, this is where I have sympathy for the shark fans. I know what it's like to root for a fucking team year in and year out and they fucking blow it. I don't know what it's like for the last 15 years. All of a sudden my hell turned into a, a fucking paradise because everybody started fucking winning. But before then, you know, I was a red sox fan living in New York City with all that curse of the Babe Shit going on, you know, Boston sports, we're in the fucking shitter.

Speaker 1:          00:27:59       Basically. When I was growing up, we had the Boston Celtics and then up to 86 and then once Len bias died, um, and then Reggie Lewis died. I mean, the whole thing just, it just, the wheels fell off for like 20 fucking years. But um, fortunately nowadays you can go out and buy a championship, which we did in 2007. Um, anyways, so I'm just trying to say congratulations to St Louis. Now my two favorite teams out west, the stars and the blues are playing each other and um, I think I'm going to stick with the blues just cause I don't know, I just worked St Louis, I saw how excited they were and you know, I like the stars because I used to like the Minnesota north stars and I liked the people on the stars, but I'm not into their fans either. You Know Dallas fans, at the end of the fucking day, you don't give a fuck about the stars.

Speaker 1:          00:28:48       There's only one star in Dallas and that's the one on the side of the cowboys helmet. You know, it's fucking true yet out. That's all you give a fuck about this beautiful ladies coming out and they're little hoary cherries. Charlie's angel outfits. That's what you give a fuck about that. You give a fuck about that. And your shiny four door pickup truck that's never seen dirt, right? Come in there with your fake tid fucking botox, Dolly Parton fucking hair check going down the street looking like a couple of televangelists. That's what you do out there in Dallas in the big D. Isn't that what you do? I know. I'm just fucking with you. Um, the one great thing though, I do like, you know, something, I can't say I'm totally anti technology because uh, I do love Tivo, but back in the day I also had a VCR so I could've take games.

Speaker 1:          00:29:38       Right? I'm saying like the one great thing that you, thing that I have in the writer's room as we're doing all the work no, is the excitement was right around five o'clock. I know we only got a couple hours left and that whatever game I want to watch is currently being taping and that being taped and I don't go on Twitter. I don't look at my phone or anything that I had just shut it off and uh, I'm able to come home and watch all these fucking great series and uh, it's just the best, you know, actually retweeted those civic, you guys see that thing on Twitter? Not that dude becoming a hockey fan. It's fucking black dude is hilarious. Like he goes, you know what, I'm going to give this hockey shit to try. And he just starts live tweeting game seven of the blues and the Black Caucus and I guess he decided to root for the blues and he was just tweeting this hilarious shit.

Speaker 1:          00:30:30       Like what the fuck is a power play? I don't know who this cane guy is, but we got to stop this motherfucker. And then towards the end of the game he goes, what? So like the goalie just leaves. Then the best question he ever asked, I've ever heard a hockey goes for real. Why don't, why doesn't the whole other team just stand in front of that net? You know when you're up by one and the just shooting like, why don't you do that? That's fucking hilarious. Um, that's just someone who's never gotten hit in the foot with the fucking puck. It's like you really went up, I watched somebody block a shot like I just, the fucking balls that that takes you do that and pick up hockey. You're going to be limping for the rest of the fucking week to watch these guys blocking NHL shot.

Speaker 1:          00:31:12       They're out of their minds. But, um, anyways, I'm up to 30 minutes here. I got to kind of cut this thing short. I know I usually do a little bit more time than this, but I gotta I gotta go, I gotta go to work. Oh, Billy goes to work every day. Eight a fucking salad every day at lunch. That's what I do. They like a big fucking pussy every fucking day. Um, and I'm actually doing okay. And I tried to lose two pounds this week, which I think I did, but I had a Burrito last night, so I only lost like a fucking pounds. So next week I have to be down to one 76 going to buckle down over this weekend and fucking workout and um, get myself back down to about a buck 70. Um, by the way, I think the Celtics a playing tonight, I think game six, that's obviously a must win.

Speaker 1:          00:32:00       We're winning at home, but we're getting pounded. We got fucking pounded that last game. It's like a joke or is almost we almost losing by fucking 30 but you know, we're a young team. We'll see hopefully next year with all our draft picks. Maybe we'll get Kevin Durant or that uni brow guy from fucking New Orleans. Although I don't think either one of those are good. You know, as far as for the league, I think to ranch should stay in Oklahoma and I think uni brow guys should stay in New Orleans. Doesn't that make sense? My out of my fucking mind to think that, that if you come in with the team, Yada fucking, unless that fucking you over like Shaq, Shaq should have stayed with the magic, you know, shouldn't it came out and just piled on with the fucking Lakers? Look what happened. You went a couple of championships and then he threw out his neck celebrating as he went down.

Speaker 6:          00:37:46       Hey, what's going on the Monday morning podcast

Speaker 7:          00:37:51       that I'm doing it seven 30 at night Pacific coast time. So it's still 10 30 on east coast. So it's still Monday. Uh, it's going on with me. I'm cooking fish. It's what I'm doing right now. Cooking fish. And I'm steaming some Broccoli cause I have to be in shape next week. Why you ask? Because on November 10th, I'm taping my one hour comedy special, uh, for a DVD. I, you like that segue right out of the fish and Broccoli, right into the goddamn comedy. Jesus Christ. I'm a professional. Um, and this is the deal, man. I just, if you guys want to go, the tickets are free. Yes, they are free. All right. And, uh, I sent out a bulletin and a, one of the problems I'm having is, um, I you have to do, you just go to Belper at Broadway video and just write bill burrs and capitals, Bill Burr at Broadway video.

Speaker 7:          00:38:46       Just request your tickets, leave your name and your phone number. It's all in the bulletin. But you know, people don't like to read. So what they're doing is they're reading the first quarter of it and then they're sending me the email with their name, with their requests and their phone numbers. So the comedian, I'm going to have to call them and say some stupid shit. Now I don't have those tens of minutes for my phone. What the fuck am I kidding? I think I had the worst plan ever. I probably made like seven phone calls last month and I've got a $380 cell phone bill screamed like a bitch echoed in my fucking living room. Um, yeah. So that's the deal. So, uh, anybody in the New York City area that wants to come out or I don't know if you're going to be in New York and you want to come down.

Speaker 7:          00:39:35       Um, I'm taping my special and I obviously don't want to take my special in front of 40 people. Uh, it's a nice big theater and nice and cushy and uh, I want to make you laugh so seriously. Go to bill burr at Broadway, video.com to get your tickets. And uh, with that I think I'm done. Um, I think I'm done whoring out my stuff. Is that it? I don't know. It's like I got one other thing here. Goddammit. I'm never organized for these things. Really. Not My cds available on a God. Listen to the little balls right now. This is fucking brutal. Oh, here we go. Yeah. People who want to get the extra, the extra or the bonus material on my CV. Just go to a, what are records.com backslash? I can't speak this computer shit. What are records.com backslash [inaudible] backslash this God discography?

Speaker 7:          00:40:38       Discog once you say a d disco and then Graffy. How about that? D I. S D I. S. C o. G R. A. P. H Y. Dot. Html. Is anybody out there scrolling that down like fucking radar O'Reilly right now? Um, all right. Yeah, so that's the deal. So I got my DVD taping is on December, November 10th November 10th this is the, I am the worst at this shit and the worst at this shit. If you know what, just go on my page. If you click down, what it's going to do is it's going to take you to my website. It's going to take you on a little journey to a place I called [inaudible] dot com and you just click on upcoming shows and then just click on November 17th and then you don't have to listen to me anymore. In fact, just hit stop and just do that right now and there won't be any more confusion. Just read the whole email though, and bill burr at Broadway video.

Speaker 7:          00:41:35       All right there. I said at 98 times, then I just make my fucking Broccoli all soggy. I did. Who Steamed Broccoli and does a podcast. You know, who does I do. I do. You think Rodney Dangerfield of it? Did some shit like that. I mean probably do some blow, but it was the 80s. Okay. I would have been on blow if it was the 80 [inaudible]. Now I'm just on crystal meth. Hey. Oh, last, uh, last time I did a podcast also people said, you know, these things, I just sort of meander. Know I cook, I cook fish, I a, I seem shit. I drive my car and you know, I got a new people I'm running out of stuff to talk about. You know? I really thought that my life was interesting enough that once a week I could babble about it for 10 minutes. And you know what?

Speaker 7:          00:42:22       I realize nobody's at interesting. Nobody is that fucking interesting. You know, like how I did that. Rather than just taking it myself and just say, you know what? I'm really not that interesting. A guy. I dragged everybody down with me, including you. Listen to this. I even said that you are not that interesting. You realize that what a Dick. Right. All right, so people sent me some questions. I'm going to try to answer these things honestly, if I count so you can get to know me a little bit. All right. Where did this guy, right? This Guy Brad, the fuck names a kick, Brad. You know what I mean? That's like, you don't even give a shit. It's not. It's like you don't want to be popular. You don't want him to get the shit kicked out of him. He just, it was just like, you know, do you want fries? Yeah. Yeah. Like a fries. What do you want to see? What do you want to call it, kid? Hey Brad. Yeah, Brad is, Brad wants to know, do you ever feel like you have time off?

Speaker 7:          00:43:21       Wait a sec. I can't read out loud that. Well. Do you ever feel like you have time off or does everyone you meet expect you to make them laugh on call Brad? You know what, that fucking sentence goes in three different directions. It's like when a plane is doing an s pattern because there's too many God damn people in the world and they don't want to go into a holding pattern. That's what you're fucking, you just did the DVD. I don't know the sentence version of my fucking flight into Newark. Do you ever feel like you have time off? I think it's going to be about going on vacation or does everyone you meet expect you to make them laugh on call the mean on Cue bread. But I got a question for you. Where the fuck did you go to school and learn how to communicate?

Speaker 7:          00:44:10       Thought two sentences. Is that a run on it? No, it isn't. I don't think it is. Do you ever feel like you have time off or does everyone you meet expect you to make them laugh on call on call? Like what am a nursing you asking me if I do like, uh, like benefits for sick people? Yeah, I do. I do those, I know what he's saying. He do you have you ever feel like you can just relax and not be a Zany douchebag? Yeah. Offstage? Uh, yeah, I, I don't, I don't walk around with a lampshade on my head, if that's what you were asking me. Um, I actually know, I do find, I find people try to make me laugh and they come up to me and they tell me horrific jokes and then when they're done with them, if I can even guess when they're done.

Speaker 7:          00:44:57       That's the worst part is when somebody tells you a joke and it's so bad, you still think they're in the middle of it. So you're still sitting there with your eyebrows up. You know, when you do that, when you're, when you're, you're trying, like when you know somebody sucks, whatever they're doing sucks, but you don't have the balls to just stare at them. Like your story sucks, but you can't fake like, it's interesting. So the only way to do it, you just put your eyebrows up like, uh Huh. Yeah. Uh Huh. And then he's just staring at you and it's over and you're sitting there with your eyebrows up by your fucking hair line and you realize that your moment to laugh was, uh, it has come and gone. That's what I have had people tell me. They tell me awful, awful jokes and then they tell me about some guy they work with and be and they're like, oh my God, you, you got to put this in your act.

Speaker 7:          00:45:44       I went with this Guy Mac, right. And every day each chicken salad and then pictures, picture fucking 20 minutes of that as you're standing in an airport trying to hear when they're boarding zone seven or whatever the fuck they work it out because that's what ends up happening. So no, I don't feel like I have to be on offstage. I just try to chill out and uh, I certainly don't do it around my family cause anytime I even remotely fit funny around my family, they break my balls. They don't even laugh to just go, oh really? That's good bill. You're going to put that in your act. It count. Um, okay. That was question number one. And I guess that's how I'm going to do them. I'm going to make fun of how people ask me questions and I'm going to shit on their lives because I'm not happy with my own on some fucked up level.

Speaker 7:          00:46:34       Oh fuck. Seven 55. How much a fisherman it though? Uh, what kind of fish and I think it's called Talia, I don't know. Get some lemon zest on it or something. I Dunno what the fuck it is. I'm eating like a, uh, an Asian in a communist country. People who are in Greek, God Damn Shit. Unless time yourself fat Asian. Honestly, the only time you ever see a fat Asian, they're hanging out with other white people and they're walking out of Mcdonald's. So if anybody Asian is listening, stop hanging out with us because uh, you know, nine out of 10 of us are going to a fucking cuckoo room. Um, all right. Uh, okay. This brings me to my question. Here is this guy, what is this? What is your worst slash funniest experience in dealing with the comedy club owner? I also, have you ever broken the news to a comedian that he just isn't that funny?

Speaker 7:          00:47:27       If not, how often you want to, that's a great question. Um, as far as the club owners, the worst in front of his experiences, too many, too many of them. Uh, the most recently is I worked for this psycho up in Seattle who, uh, he brings me into town. He's going to pay me a disgusting amount of money, right? So I need to sell tickets and this guy doesn't advertise the show at all, so I don't sell any tickets. So then he yells at my management company, you know, I mean, even if you had Jesus Christ plan at your club, you know, you couldn't just put his name out on the marquee and have somebody, you know, you need at least have to have somebody with a fucking sandwich board walking up and down the street to let, let you know that the son of God is down the street.

Speaker 7:          00:48:22       Jesus Christ would have a difficult time selling out a club without advertising. He'd have to be doing miracles on the corner. Like one of those fucking David blame guys hanging upside down in a cube of ice or some shit. Trying to get people to come down there. Okay, that's the son of God. That's what he would have to do. Okay, now you're talking about little old me, right? But thank God this Guy Marty reamer up there put me on the radio and then we sold a bunch of tickets and then the guy, you know, he does like a one 80 and all of a sudden he loves me and he's one of these guys. He's such as psycho. I don't even care if he fucking, here's this because he's a psycho and psychos have, they don't, they don't remember anything. He'll be mad. They know throw a stapler at his assistant that he's underpaying and then he'll come to like when David banner comes back from being the hall can, you won't even remember that I said this shit.

Speaker 7:          00:49:14       All right. So if you are listening all that shit you said to my management company, it got back to me. Okay. Fucking fucking psycho. Psycho. He had a comb over to God. Those are the worst. Who Do you think you're fooling? Um, all right. Oh, the other one. Have you ever broken the news to a comedian that he just, isn't that funny? If not, how often do you want to, I'll tell you right now, I would never do that to somebody. I would never do that to somebody. I, uh, I don't think somebody is funny. I just, I keep it to myself because there's been a lot of people who've really sucked for a long time and then all of a sudden they figure out how to be funny. And, uh, I dunno. I look at everybody like they're like me when I started out with who, other than when I started out, I had no confidence and a, you know, I, if one person is some established comedian came up to me and said that they didn't wait a minute, somebody did that.

Speaker 7:          00:50:18       Somebody did come up to me. That's right. It is Vietnam comedy flashback. I was working then the comedy in Boston, Massachusetts. This, how long ago was, I had a big Red Afro. I was wearing a striped shirt with a vest member in the mid nineties. He's white. His grunge was starting to die, but it was before in sync. And the boy band thing, it's sorta a letter on like the sublime era and that people like for half a second, we're willing to invest. It's just one of those that's like when black people try to make a pink, that color member, they were like, subs were wearing tank for like a week and a half. I remember seeing that thinking if black people pull this off, that's, that's it. That's a game set match. There was nothing that they cannot make. Cool. And that shit went away real quick.

Speaker 7:          00:51:18       Well, the white version of that was vests. Okay. I know a lot of people fucking laughing at you, but if there's other people my age out there, late 30, [inaudible] to 40, you remember it, you had it on and uh, you know, it's right after doc Martins. It was the bridge, the vest. Oh, I get to the fucking point of the story. Jesus Christ. All right. So anyways, so that's what I'm wearing. I go on stage and I kill and I get off stage and then there's other comedian comes up and he's like, he's a red head too, but he's like 60 years old. He's basically me in 40 years at the time when he came up to me and uh, and he just came up to me and he just like, you know what I mean, you to set up there, then it was all bullshit.

Speaker 7:          00:52:13       You know, you just day you're jumping around and blah, blah blah. And he just shit all over my act. You know, you have a watch the discovery channel with some sort of fucking Willdabeast trying to market to territory. That's what he did to my act. And uh, everything he was saying was like a punch through my chest, pass my heart and into my soul and uh, it was fucking brutal. Then I still had a day job, so I had to go back to work for like three days before my next show. And all I'm hearing in my head is this guy's voice telling me that I suck. And like back then I had such little confidence, I just took what anybody said to me as law. So they said I sucked and I sucked. I didn't have the brains to be like, well, it's just an old bitter comic.

Speaker 7:          00:53:03       He used to be a young red head and now you know, a not so young anymore. And uh, you know, he's a little drunk and he's been a Douche. This has nothing to do with me. I didn't know how to do that back then. I was like, oh my God, somebody would, TV credits thinks I suck, so therefore I must suck. So whatever, fast forward, that's why I'd never do it to somebody. I would never do that. I wouldn't want to make somebody feel like that. Now if you heckle me, you know, all bets are off. I don't give a shit. I wants to make you, uh, just short of suicidal. I'm sure that's kind of childish. But, uh, that's it. So to answer your question now, I don't say that and uh, I gotta be honest with you. I hate watching people bond and unless it's my friends, if it's a friend of mine and who's funny and I watched him go up there and try a new joke, especially if it's a high energy joke and they end with this big Ted, I look on their face and they get nothing.

Speaker 7:          00:54:01       I can tell you that nothing makes a comedian. The civilian version of that is watching a good friend. He goes fall down a flight of stairs. I mean it's just fucking hilarious. No matter even if they dislocate their shoulder or whatever, you know, at some point as you're driving them to the hospital, you're going to have to turn and look out the driver's side window and you, you got to kind of laugh. You know this, you know, you do it subtly cause you're like him. He's your friend, right? Jesus Christ. Could I take longer to answer a fucking question? Was trying to get quicker. Uh, where do we go here? What do we got next? When are we getting the next one? It's a couple more of these. All right. Um, what's your most embarrassing moment on stage or in life? Jesus Christ. I don't know. I block them out at this point.

Speaker 7:          00:54:52       Had somebody throw a dinner roll at me. Does that count? Dental floss thrown at me? If you look on my website, I get fucking somebody who a doughnut at me. I mean, I dunno. So he sold ice had me, uh, I, you know what, probably the first time I bombed in front of an all black crowd. Maybe that was the fucking, that was the worst famine in front of a white crowd. Sucks enough. But like you just feel like you suck, but when you bomb and you're the only white guy in the room when you bomb it and you really feel like you're bombing for the entire white race and you're also reinforcing the stereotype that white people aren't funny. And it was just the worst. And I was standing up there first job bombed. I ran to the second joke, the next joke bombed.

Speaker 7:          00:55:37       At this point I have like dry mouth, like I can't even explain it. Just, you know when like concrete, I dunno when it gets so dry you can, you can break it off and it seemed that, you know that little powdered miss. Just imagine if you just took a whole handful of I'm stuck in, in your mouth. That's how dry my mouth was and for some reason no one was heckling. They would just sort of sitting there just looking around is it, the show hadn't even started, which it had been. It'd been going great for like an hour and I went into my third joke in total panic mode, trapped in my act, just mobile, blah blah blah, blah, blabbing on. And then all of a sudden in the back is big black girl. He cheating on those voices. She didn't, she wasn't even saying it loud, but if you could just a hot summer day and it just carried throughout the club.

Speaker 7:          00:56:30       As I'm up there babbling on in dead silence, I just hear her clear as day just go, I ain't left yet. And the whole place just started laughing. It was like a whole nother show was going on while I was still up there in my act and I was so green. I didn't know what to do when I should have done was addressing, but I didn't. I continue doing my act, which made them laugh at me even more. It was, it was absolutely humiliating, but I got to admit, I didn't really think about it until you asked me that fucking question. So either I'm over it or I'm just the only complete denial. Okay. Why are you still single? Uh, cause I'm a psycho and if you don't know that, listen to my podcasts. Listen to this one, right? I'll fight. I keep forgetting to take the Goddamn Fisher.

Speaker 7:          00:57:25       Um, anyways. All right. I think it's time for me to eat like an Asian in a communist country. I tell him, if you want to get shredded, man, that's what I'm telling you, man. You don't want to fucking fuck all these stupid other diets. One of the that did the South Beach, Manhattan beach, it's always like a beach, right? All that bullshit. You don't need to do that. That's what you do. You eat like somebody in Asia just squatting down on the side of the road in some Zen, like, you know those Buddhist monks, you know, you ever seen a fat monkey? You just don't see it. A Buddhist monk. Okay, but you got those friar tuck white ones. The fat man. It's just, I don't know what it is. It sits up. We got that double cheeseburger thing going on, you know, but, uh, I, you know what, I don't know what the fuck I'm talking about this point.

Speaker 7:          00:58:16       All right, so I'm going to wrap this up. Uh, I want to thank everybody who listened to in called into the uninformed show. Uh, the, the radio show I do with Joe to Rosa. And, uh, that's quickly becoming one of the most fun things that I do here. And, uh, and the entertainment world. We did a Halloween show and real quick, so we had on a, uh, a real live, which, and a couple of people from the Church of Satan because we wanted to learn about that shit. And I get, it was unbelievable. They were the most boring fucking people. I've New People in the Church of Satan evidently don't believe in the devil. The, they just don't like. Nah. The Church of Satan is just giving into the desires you want to be and do and yeah. You know, I stop at Red Lights and a, I yield to pedestrians.

Speaker 7:          00:59:07       It was the most excruciating hour of radio I think I've ever done. But we did have the drum battle. Me and Joe to Rosa, uh, go to uninformed radio.com. Later on this week, we have the, uh, the video up Joe one the plane through the song part, and then I won the freestyle so you can vote and see which one of us is better. You know, it's, I know it's kind of fucking gay, but we had a good time. Um, so that's it. I'm going to be in Las Vegas on November 17th doing at Caesar's palace. Jeez, it's so beautiful in here, isn't it? I wish I had a toga. Fucking hate casinos. They have the ugliest goddamn rugs. I mean, the what they must pay per square footage for a casino rug. If it's just fucking, it's mind boggling. How ugly it is, you know, got the bid yet. Drink it.

Speaker 7:          01:00:04       Why didn't I buy those myths to help you take a hot plate out and you guys won't listen to me. Take a hot plate out with a couple of districts. I can burn myself and the fucking podcast him. See if this is, don't fuck. Ow. Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow. Shit done. You know the worst thing about cooking a white fish? You have no fucking idea when has done right. You know what? I think I'm really trashy. White people on this may find Asians a little bit. I'm talking about how fucking fat white people are and uh, wait a second, is that done? Oh Shit. That's gone. Look at debt. Oh, would you look at that? If I was Emeril right now, Emeril Lagasse I, I would fucking, I would take some chocolate chips and throw them on top and go back and start screaming just to get the crowd going.

Speaker 7:          01:00:54       I fucking hate that show. All right. If you want to watch [inaudible] who got you watched the essence of Emma? Cause then he's just sitting there cooking. If you watch Emeril live or whatever his show is to do, he, he's like, he's got to entertain people. Once you have a studio audience, do you have noticed that? Then all of a sudden you just got to dumb it down. You can't cook anymore. Now you've got to be like, I got some shit. Everybody starts applauding. Like they can't afford it. They know it's sugar. Okay? You get it for free at a diner, right? You're not kicking it up a notch. You making people fatter and you contributing to the diabetes and this goddamn country. All right Emma. So why don't you fucking take it down a few notches. And uh, what about the musicians? He actually has musicians on that show.

Speaker 7:          01:01:42       Jesus Christ. And you know, when you start out to be a musician, you think, you know, I dunno, you're gonna to fucking play arenas. But if you're going to do the TV thing, maybe you'll be in the Conan band or the tonight show band. You really don't think you're going to be playing your flute while, you know, in between some guy teaching somebody how to make Lasagna. Why does she make me feel better about myself and my career? Anyways, that's it. Go to bill burr at Broadway, video.com for the tickets. Uh, police come out to the show. I've got a lot of new stuff. I haven't been in New York for a minute and uh, come on down. Seven 45, November 10th. Come down an hour early. I will make you laugh. That is what I do. So that's it guys. All right, keep the questions, comment. Oh wait a minute.

Speaker 7:          01:02:31       Congratulations to the Boston red sox. We wanted again. And uh, I want to apologize to every other team in the league that isn't the red sox or the Yankees, cause that's all that ESPN seems to talk about. I mean, it's ridiculous. I mean, we want it last night and I just sit through 20 minutes a shit of what that means to the god Damn Yankees. Who gives a fuck? What does it mean to the Indians? What does it mean to the angels? What does it mean to fucking them? Other people, they don't count. They don't count. You know, that's how ESPN treats the rest of the league. They treat the red sox and the Yankees like they're, they're real kids and they treat everybody else like stepchildren. It's like you have to see that family that adopted those kids and they kept the check and they didn't feed the kids and they said they're regular kids. You know, if ESPN adopted children, that's, that's what they do.

Speaker 7:          01:03:27       Doesn't even fucking make sense. Not yet. My is all soggy kids there anything worse than that? Now when you do that, what you've done is you've boiled all the new nutrients out of it. So what I'm doing here is I'm just eating green, soggy shit. That's disgusting. The fish is great though. Fish is great. All right. There's a lesson for you. Never Seen Broccoli when you're doing a podcast. All right. Come on down to my taping. If you can't make that come out to Vegas, you can't make that. I'll probably end up in your area. Please send me more questions. Thank you everybody for listening and giving a shit about that.

Speaker 5:          01:04:01       What I do means a lot to me. Have a great week.
