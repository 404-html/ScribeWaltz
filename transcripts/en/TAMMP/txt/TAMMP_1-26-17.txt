Speaker 1:          00:01          Hey, what's going on is bill burn is time for the Thursday afternoon. Just before Friday. Monday morning podcast. Dan,

Speaker 1:          00:12          just checking in on you. Just check it on your own little baby cry in the end. My beautiful daughter is home now and uh, she's downstairs sleeping, so I'm gonna try to knock this out while a while. She's still asleep before she wakes up in like 18 seconds, which has been the thing hasn't been so bad. All these parents, all you were to go to home or a big goober day, right? I ran into parents tonight and I'm going, no, you know it's not that bad. I'm a little sleepy, but you know, I'm hanging in there and then you know what they said? Oh wait til she starts walking. I just want to be like, are you enjoying any aspect of this that I swear to God did gloom and like, you know what parents are like, it's like reading a Dan Shaughnessy sports call.

Speaker 1:          00:55          Just, there's no light at the end of the tunnel. Even if there is light, but it's going to blind your eyes. Good Lord. Good Lord. I understand why kids run away from home just talking to all these fucking parents, man, I just, I swear to God I am. I'm like, I'm loving people that don't have kids right now. They had a kid, oh good for you. Good for you. That's great man. Good you gotta you gotta be bright dead. That's it. These other fucking people, I swear to God, half these parents, you know what? They ought to stick them on the weather channel. You know, cause you know that that's how the weather channel, that's how they make their money. Like nobody pays attention when it's a beautiful day, but oh my God, if there's a storm coming, you know, they just start freaking out. Getting everybody running out to the grocery store to bite nine weeks of eggs because it's going to rain for an afternoon or maybe it's going to snow. We're going to get 18 inches. Holy Shit. That's almost up to my knees.

Speaker 1:          01:53          What am I going to do? You're going to be fine. You're going to, what was the last fucking time? A whole town, God so snowed in that everybody just died of starvation. Has that ever happened in the United States. I'm not saying a couple of fucking people haven't died. There's always the person sitting in the car and the fucking snow comes up and then the, the, the, the carbon monoxide goes in. They'll always be some old lady sitting too close to the window and she'll die. Right. Cause it's snowed out. Oh. Because she was born, you know, three years after the civil war. I mean, you make the call on that one. Jesus fucking Christ, he's God damn parents said they just stay fucking scare in the shit out of you. So I don't know what's going on in the world. Um, in a good way. Um, I'm having the best time ever been a dad. I've always wanted to be a dad, so I'm enjoying the hell out of it. And I don't care if I'm fucking tired and I feel like I'm drunk, you know, I don't want to miss a second of this thing, so, uh, I'm going to stop talking to the parents.

Speaker 1:          02:56          Goddamn Weirdos. I just don't get them. It's like, what did you think was going to happen when you had a baby? What? What did you think was going to happen? You know, it was a baby. You knew it wouldn't understand English. Did you read up on it at all? You, everybody's, you know what they sound like? They sound like they sound like some people who like bought like a swamp land and were promised that it was a paradise or something. I mean, I don't know. I don't fucking know, but I'm, I'm not going to be that guy. If I meet somebody else who's having a kid, even if I have a tough day, I'm going to say, hey, good for you. If that's great, man, it's going to be a great thing. Good for you. Instead of putting all this fucking gloom and doom and everybody's head anyways, anybody watched the, uh, the Celtics supplies?

Speaker 1:          03:40          Couple of games, man, I got to love the fact that the fucking, the Celtics and the wizards have this rivalry now. You know what I mean? Everybody's talking about the calves and the, and the, and the Golden State Warriors. Hey, we are dead tier two or tier three. I love other wizards were all black. It's going to be a funeral. And she just fucking put your sneakers on, pump up your little Reebok's, whatever. The fucking just go and go play basketball. We're all dressed all in black or what does that mean you're going to try tonight? The other nights when he just wear your uniform or your regular street clothes, you're not going to try. I don't understand that. I always loved that. Way Back in the day when Kevin Mchale, I remember we were playing that playoff series and we blew this team out the first game and the other team was in the locker room saying that we better watch out Celtics better watch out game.

Speaker 1:          04:30          Two cars were coming and Kevin Mchale goes, well yeah, you should be coming every night. This is the NBA completely diffused the whole fucking thing. Oh, you're going to try. Well, we're trying every game. So you know, just to keep it interesting. Why don't you try. Um, anyways, having said that, I really liked the, uh, the wizards team man, um, young team. They played great. I just kept one, you know, basketball being a game of runs. I just kept waiting for them to hit this streak where they weren't going to be shooting well and they just fucking killed it all night. My only complaint, and I mentioned this tape, I did Bill Simmons podcast hype. My special that's coming out January 31st whoring myself out. I was mentioning the only thing I did like about the wizards the other night was when John Wall dunked on Kelly Olynyk and then he flexed afterwards.

Speaker 1:          05:23          I get it. It was a nice dunk. It was an explosive moves, but at the end of the day, you went around Kelly Olynyk. Okay. Who essentially is like a parking pylon that seven feet tall wears it a little Bandana. That fucking guy, man, I swear to God, if he was six, NBA loves a seven footer. If you have a seven in front of you and for, for your height, forget it. You're going to get drafted and you're going to hang around on some fucking team. I swear to God, if that guy was six foot 11, he'd be directing traffic. Um, anyway, I know that's harsh. I don't know shit about hoop, you know. Wow. Whatever. I just need, he gets out, you know, he draws a couple of offensive files. I'll give him that, but he's always around the ball, but it never ends up in his hands. He tries to jump.

Speaker 2:          06:14          Okay.

Speaker 1:          06:14          Then like every 19 games they'll hit like five, three pointers and every second here she's going to turn the corner. Um, anyways. Yeah, it was a great game. Marcus smart, having the meltdown, you know, wanting to be out there and then immediately apologized on Twitter's a lot of, there's a lot of great, you know, Celtics away, more fun to watch this year. And I haven't been watching, you know, the Bruins as much as I usually do, only because it's going to kill me to watch them fire Clo Julian. I just don't want to see that. I love that fucking guy. Um, but maybe May, I dunno. Maybe it's time. I guess that's how it works. You know what I mean? The whole coaching thing, you, if you hang around long enough, they're going to fire you. Right. Players go for the money and shit. I don't know what it is, but uh, you know, we beat the red wings. That was a good one. And we got the penguins coming up. Maybe we'll see. We'll see what happens. But, um, we're still there. We're still do the eighth seat.

Speaker 2:          07:09          Okay.

Speaker 1:          07:10          Oh, what happened to the team, man, I've been doing that the whole game. But anyways, I watched a little bit of the whole year. I've been whining about the fucking Bruins. I'm going to stop. Who knows? Maybe a, we bottomed out. We're on a way to, well, the seventh seat, who knows? There was watching the, uh, the Celtics first, the rockets tonight. And uh, you know, I just got it on the NBA package. It just records. And what sucks is I wish it is anybody know how to set it. So I always get the Boston feed because I love listening to Tommy Heinsohn. You know, he knows the game. He's a hall of Famer and he's a total homer and he announces the game. Like he's still sitting on the bench or are you still coaching the team? It's fucking great. So tonight I got the, uh, the, um, the Houston feed and uh, you know, so they're obviously pro Houston, which I don't have a problem considering.

Speaker 1:          07:59          Tommy Heinsohn is so fucking pro Boston. And what was great was tonight James Harden gets fouled, spins around in the air and just fucking smacks. Uh, Yoanis Jerico right in the fucking mouth, draws blood and everything. And Tommy Heinsohn's flipping out, I was able to see that Bill Simmons retweeted this thing. So Tommy Heinsohn's flipping out and blah, blah, blah, blah going you quite, she could've called that from half court, you know, all this shit. Cena was a total dirty play and the refs are reviewing it and the Houston guys just going like, oh, that's just a, it was unfortunate. Uh, Chi, he was finished. He was just trying to get his balance. He was a, he was following through. It's an unfair, you see, he immediately apologize. This is why I think the refs got it right, that they called it a flagrant foul. Aside from the fact that that guy was crying the whole game, you know, like young Sidney Crosby or Tom Brady at his, you know, when he's in a bad mood in anybody brushes against him, he turns around and looks at the ref leggings. That's my uniform. Um, I keep saying there's a pats fan, you know, um, what's his face? James Harden was acting like that the whole fucking game. The whole fucking game. He's just bitching at the refs

Speaker 1:          09:13          every fucking time. Anybody comes near me once a call. Right? I mean, maybe, I don't know shit about who, maybe he just was having a bad night. Maybe the chicken usually banks it Boston when he comes to town, fucking found true love. It was on the rag. I don't know what it was, but that guy was definitely in a mood.

Speaker 2:          09:30          Okay.

Speaker 1:          09:30          It is a, this is why I think it was a flagrant foul cause when he smacked him in the fucking face, he immediately apologized, but not to Yonas he looked at the raft and went, oh, so like he was trying not to get the file.

Speaker 2:          09:44          Okay.

Speaker 1:          09:44          If you really, if you fucking smack somebody in the face accidentally, what, who did he apologize to? Some other guy that you didn't hit. Don't you apologize. Oh, I'm sorry.

Speaker 2:          09:53          Okay.

Speaker 1:          09:54          Try that. A Bar, something like you don't get yourself one of those little girly drinks and spend yourself around the floor. It backhand somewhat across the face, causing them to draw blood and then just pick some other guy standing. Ah, but it was an accident.

Speaker 1:          10:07          I figured that one out. I don't know. I love that he got the flavor and file and the Celtics ended at three game losing streak. But uh, I'm really enjoying the, uh, the NBA. I never, I fucking, I left it for so goddamn long, but a hockey will always, always be my first love. I'm just kind of a, I don't know. I'm waiting. I got a bad feeling. Oh, I got a bad feeling there that the hammer is about ready to fall there. Um, so anyways, I've been whoring myself out like a lunatic. It's why I'm taping the Thursday afternoon, just before Friday, moneyball podcasts on a Wednesday night because I got to do some more stuff tomorrow. I'm doing the cow herd show tomorrow. I did rich eyes and show today had a great time on that. Did Jimmy Kimmel the other night. They had a great time. And uh, you know what I've noticed cause both Kimmel and uh, eyes and obviously a big sports fans and I've noticed debt like

Speaker 2:          11:05          okay

Speaker 1:          11:06          with Boston sports we've had so much success that they can't even trash the teams anymore. So now they just sort of go after you as a fan. Like when I was on Kimberly was going like, so like you have like a man crush or something on top for Kenneth came at me with that angle and when I was on eyes and show he's going like, why are Boston fans still so mad? Like they've completely left the field of play and the other like, hey, you sitting in the fucking mezzanine level. Whoa, how come you got one ear socks pulled up? And the other one is,

Speaker 2:          11:39          yeah,

Speaker 1:          11:39          I don't anymore. They are, you know, it's just one of those, it's just, it is what it is. That's how many fucking championships they've won. They, they, you know, they got nothing to say. I'm not trashing to get one of those guys cause I like, I like, but I did notice that as sports fans, that's, that's kind of the way that they, that they come at you. But, um, I gotta give a big thanks to both of them for having me on this shows in, uh, and, uh, everybody at the Jimmy Kimmel show, they put together this little gift package for my daughter, a little Jimmy Kimmel, uh, the cutest thing ever for a toddler little coat and a bunch of children's books. So I can't wait to read them to my daughter when, uh, I guess when she understands, because evidently now she's just sort of, somebody told me that they don't recognize anything.

Speaker 1:          12:20          All they see is lights. Like it's an acid trip for, I don't know how many weeks, so she wouldn't stop crying. And I'm walking around with their, you know, babies have this, this thing where like if you walk around with them, they stop crying, but the second you sit down or God forbid lay down that kind of like, oh wait a minute. No, no, you're not doing that. And then they cry. Then you stand up. I, it's good, let's keep it moving. You know, I feel like I'm an officer and a gentleman, right? And my baby's giving me the Louis Gossett Jr treatment, you know, making me keep my legs up but want to fly jets. Right. So, um, anyway, so once I got that information that they're kind of a, it's kind of an acid trip is a good way to stop your baby from crying I've found is when you went walking around isn't working, just start spinning going, woo.

Speaker 1:          13:11          Right. Just start doing that. They just start looking around like it's the greatest acid trip ever. It had just started looking around like, wow man, what the fuck is that? And then they stop crying. I just learned that 20 minutes ago. I've only tried it once, but it totally works. You can also, as you're doing that, there's different ways you can spend and you can kind of lift them up and lower him, do like the tilt a world kind of thing. Um, for however long you can stand it before, you know, you end up yacking on your own kid, you know, if, if, if you're one of those people that gets motion sickness. But I found out that I found that that works. So I'm trying to put something positive out there for all the negative shit that I've heard about having a kid. It's fucking hilarious.

Speaker 1:          13:52          Um, anyways, uh, what else do I got? Do I have anything else? I got nothing man. I feel like I'm drunk. I've had such a little amount of sleep. It's actually, it's actually hilarious. I've always found baby's crying funny though. You know what I mean? Cause they sound adorable so it's already funny. And then all she want to be like, like what are you crying about? You don't have any bills, there's no stress. You know, like what deadline do you have to meet? You know, what, what, what's going on tomorrow? That enough stress built up that you crying? It's just strikes me as funny. I mean, I know they're trying to communicate before you give me your fucking kid pop psychology fucking horse shit that I've just had coming out my ears. Um, or like if I'm on a plane and when kids cry, it's never annoyed me. Even if I get on the plane, hung over the second kid starts crying. It just makes me like, I, I, I just started laughing because I always think like, you know, that's exactly what I'm feeling right now. Anytime you get on a plane, there is that thing. Once they close the door, you're like, oh, it's gonna suck. You know? Even though it's amazing, you can fly across the country in six hours is fucking incredible. But it is not comfortable is far as what you're used to with comfort,

Speaker 2:          15:15          you know?

Speaker 1:          15:18          I Dunno. It'd be great, you know? So what they should do, if they ever come up with a time machine, they should send people back in time. Not to change history, you know, not to do something good like Tom Cruise going back and kill. And Hitler, whatever the fuck he was trying to do in that movie, they should just send you back just so you could see how hard life was seeking. Just stop bitching, you know what I mean? Or I guess you could go to like a third world country or something like that.

Speaker 2:          15:43          You know,

Speaker 1:          15:44          spend one day with like a fucking water carrier, whatever the hell you call it, their version of a canteen balancing on your head, walking like 20 miles past fucking, I don't know what God knows what kind of wildlife, you know, through a civil war and all this other shit. You know, trying to stay away for some baby formula that some corporation over here puts out fucking kid up. Do that for a couple of days and he'd come back here. I bet up all this shit that we bitched about probie probably wouldn't be as bad. Right. I guess you wouldn't need a time machine, you know? See that you like that. I just worked that all out all by myself. Here it is. I thought we needed a time machine and all I needed to do was just travel. And you know what, I, I think that, I think there's, there's some sort of something in that. I have no idea. Anyways, I ran into that dude tonight who told me I'd never play fucking drums again once they had a kid. I was breaking his fucking ball so bad.

Speaker 1:          16:44          Are you going to be a data you'll never played drums again now really? I went up to him. I was like, yeah, yeah. Why did you say that to me? He goes, you watch, you won't. I just find, just said, Dave Grohl has like two or three fucking kids. He plays drums and guitar and sings in a band that travels around the fucking world. You idiot and he's cracking up laughing. He goes, yeah, but then he's such a negative country goes, yeah, but his drums aren't at home. It's like, yeah, they are. I saw the fucking documentary. He's got a studio in his house. He was recording with his band and in his kid came and said, hey, you want to go swim in? And he goes, yeah. And he goes out, he goes swimming and then he goes back and he writes another hit song.

Speaker 2:          17:26          I Dunno,

Speaker 1:          17:29          this fucking guy, he's acting like it's the 18 hundreds and five are standing behind a team of oxen and some kid came up to me, I'll be a gag. You know, I don't have time to play with you. I got to keep plowing the fucking field here. I don't know. I got to learn to block this shit out because I was doing so well and other parents give me anxiety. But I'm so proud of my kid. Keep showing everybody pictures. I don't show pictures, but if something, hey, I congratulate you had a kid. I just guy you brought it up. Now I've got to show you. I never thought I'd be that guy. But you get, you got to do it. You got to do it. But my wife gave me, all right, let's uh, let's, uh, let's do this here. Let's do a, let's read a little bit of advertising. Oh my mind. My mother in law came over today and she said that she got upset cause she went online and I was joking around on Kimmel and somehow they took something that I said out of context and says, Bill, Bill Burr has a kid and doesn't enjoy being a parent.

Speaker 2:          18:31          Oh

Speaker 1:          18:32          Ah, the Internet. It's not even the Internet, it's just fucking people. Right. And Shit. That's the funniest. I want to, you know, something, if I could do this business over again, I wouldn't be the guy I would, that's what I would do. I would want to get into entertainment journalism because it has to be the funniest job ever. If you're in a room with other people and just sitting there trying to think how disgustingly out of context you can take something and just crying, laughing, thinking of the person that you're fucking over it, like their, their reaction to what you're doing. Um, I guess they do it so much that nobody really reacts to it, but I always find it. Ah, I duNno. It's just funny to me because it's such a [inaudible] thing to do and it's just funny to me. Cause you're not really hurting anybody.

Speaker 1:          19:22          You're just trying to get eyeballs onto the website. Right? I Dunno. Am I still speaking English? I swear to God, I almost just fell asleep right there. All right. The black talks everybody as opposed to the White Tux, the Black Tux. Oh, by the way, somebody said not to say cut too much in the, uh, in the, uh, the advertising read. That's, that's where I've come to, you know, on the entertainment ladder, people who've just so accepted the fact that I'm a fucking moron, that they just go a, you know, read it however you want to. If you could just try to keep it under six concerts, you know, w we, we, I think, I think we can enjoy it. All right.

All right. I would take, if, if Atlanta gets, I don't like only getting three. The bed I want is Atlanta getting points? That's what I want. I think them getting points is a great bet, but not only three, you know, four is a little scary. You start talking five. That looks like a good bet to me. And I can tell I can say that without a fucking doubt. Cause I watched at least nine games this year. You heard it here from the fucking freckles mouth. Alright, go fuck yourselves.

Speaker 4:          35:46          she watches like three of those episodes every fucking night before we go to bed. And I, and I and I always ended up falling asleep cause it's the same fucking story over and over again. You know, it's the same thing. The guy starts a fucking business. He in the party, he's faking it till you make it. He gets a bunch of investors, he hands out fake spreadsheets. Then you've got these fucking innocent people just go and like, you know, all I, you know, I shy, shy, they recharge. You know, I was getting dirty, appreciate it. And I was like, Whoa, it's shower was like a good year or me.

Speaker 2:          36:16          All right.

Speaker 4:          36:18          And then they always go, you know, there's always get some really bad metaphor. They invested in an ice cream chain, but this wasn't the flavor they were looking for. When do we return glass in the ice cream?

Speaker 5:          36:31          Oh Wow. Oh Wow.

Speaker 4:          36:36          That fucking song for American greed, I'll tell you, and I was going to end up on fucking American grade, is that cunt who shut that lion? Everybody's talking about this dentist that went over and illegally poached this lion that was friendly with people. I love that shit. Oh, is it a friendly with people until what? It bites somebody fucking head off. Fucking unreal. You know what I mean? Everybody's fucking salient gas. The pit bulls, you shoot a fucking line every like, oh, he was nice. He was a good line. I'm not saying it was a bad line. I'm not saying the guy shouldn't have done it. I think everybody's missing the fucking story here.

Speaker 2:          37:12          Okay.

Speaker 4:          37:12          All right. Speaking of American greed, this guy paid 50 grand. All right. That's just for the fuck. That's not even for this flight to go over there and kill this fucking lion.

Speaker 2:          37:27          All right.

Speaker 4:          37:30          Oh, trying to stir anything up here. But how to fuck in a dentist. Afford to drop 50 grand to fly to Africa to shoot a fucking lion?

Speaker 2:          37:42          Yeah.

Speaker 4:          37:43          Illegally.

Speaker 2:          37:44          Okay.

Speaker 4:          37:45          Just take it. Of all the, how expensive the shoes he had to buy that he had to sneak around and they had to be some sort of Ninja were fucking, I'm going to shoot it. Uh, uh, protected lion were that he had on, right. Guy Drop 50 grand on that and now he's gone underground. They go over his house, he's got a match, right? And all they're talking about as his fucking line. And I'm, I'm watching an episode of American greed.

Speaker 5:          38:10          Oh Wow. Wow.

Speaker 4:          38:12          Ooh, I got a fucking your phone off or I'm in fucking how many teeth you fill it.

Speaker 4:          38:21          This guy's pulling teeth. He's, I'm telling you right now, I used to work in a dental office, right? And I, there was some good dentists just like cops. There's some good cops, there's some bad cops. And I'm not talking about interrogation, talking about brandishing a weapon. Uh, no, I'm talking about fucking people pulling teeth that didn't need to be pulled. Fucking doing root filling fillings on teeth that did not need to be fucking drilled into because they bought a car beyond their own fucking needs or whatever. Their, their, their financial responsibility. All right. I think this guy should be fucking taken back there just for the simple fact, just for the simple fact that, that he uh, he went to another country. It did that. What do we got over here? Does the MGM still have a lion? What if he, what if somebody from Zimbabwe came over here? What about at the MGM Lion? Right, right. As they were recording that you're watching an MGM film. They fuck the police. Turn the air conditioning back on. Yeah. The lovely knee. Everybody, she came in. This is a studio man. Dave Letterman had it cold. I'm having a cold. He lasted fucking 30 years on television. I want to do 30 years of podcasting. Huh?

Speaker 4:          39:41          Well, what's good is the air conditioning. If you're going to fucking turn it off. Listen, I'm talking about that dentist that went out, went over to Zimbabwe. You got to go grab a mic from the, uh, from the closet there. I, you know, no one wants to listen to somebody. Just hit pause here. I fucking, I never hit pause. Um,

Speaker 2:          39:59          yeah.

Speaker 4:          40:00          Do you know that story in here? This dentist from Minnesota, he's a B. You know, like, he's one of those big game hunters, you know what I mean? He's one of those fucking guys. I'm going to shoot something that people think is scary and that could be the guy I killed that shit. You know, like it went up and he fucking put it in a choke hold. It's like you didn't, you, you went over and you shot it. The fact that you can go, you can walk up and kill an armed man, a human being with a gun. You could fucking kill. You could, you could tell it. Even if he knew you were coming, you have a gun. He has a gun. You could do that. So now you're going up to a lion. The thing doesn't have a gun. So, I mean, how fucking difficult is that actually they shadow with a crossbow, but there a reason why they shut with a crossbow is cause they were trying to disguise it.

Speaker 4:          40:45          Doesn't he have, he's gone big game hunting before, right? Like he's done an align. Well, here's the thing that I saw some weirdly alarm headline being like, you know, he's like a serial killer of animals and it's like they, the way they were putting it was like, you know, this is what he does all the time. I don't know. He had him, he's one of those guys, he thought he doesn't seem like he kills to eat it. A assists for sport. Yeah. He's one of those guys to be like, Yay. You ever hear of an alligator fucking shot one in their head as he put it up in his study or something like that. He's one of those guys. So we weren't, what about him? He fled, right? Like he, uh, he will goes over, he went over to Zimbabwe like a crossbow and he fucking went into some like wildlife sanctuary.

Speaker 4:          41:25          Allegedly. This lion was friendly with people. I love that shifts all the lion see solo or whatever it was. It was, yeah, it's friendly until it isn't for the one day you do something that reminds us of something from his childhood and it fucking bite your head off, but yet it's what it's supposed to tell. What's a line? Yeah. It kill Shit. Yeah, of course. So he went in and he fucking killed it to capitated. It's skin. The fucking thing. Yeah. He wants to head. Yeah. First of all, how do you get the head back? I don't know. I don't want to know that. You got to go gym bag.

Speaker 6:          41:59          Good.

Speaker 4:          42:00          Drain it out. They probably do it. They're like, oh no. You know what he did? He probably taxidermy. Well he probably like takes the fucking, just the skin from the head. You bring that back and then you just, you have somebody like make a like a lion skull and then you put it over that cause no one was going to connote the skull isn't in there. Right. This is the kind of shit, this is like no idea. Let me ask you this near because you're into American greed. This guy's a dentist. He paid 50 grand to do that. Now he's gone underground. They're going by his house. He has a mansion. This guy's a dentist. He's a mansion is gone. All these expensive fucking uh, you know, going around killing all these, how does a dentist have all that fucking money? Is he like a Hoity toity fancy dentist that like doesn't take any insurance at all. Like self pay. And then I worked in a dental office. Nobody was going on a safari. Even if just look at them. Forget about to, I just want to safari. How much money that is? Forget about. You're going to go over there and then sneak back later. Kill a lion. Butcher the fucking thing and sneak it back. Yeah. I don't know. He sounds very sketchy though.

Speaker 6:          43:05          Oh Wow.

Speaker 3:          43:20          I will drink. So Liz, Liz, Liz, I've got it. Go. You don't know

Speaker 6:          44:01          cause he's not going to fuck with and what he wouldn't know cause we don't do that. You mean you don't do that? We don't do that. You guys like to do that whole race working with animals and I'm in listening to what people watch these shows about like wilderness and survival and like naked and afraid. It's like, I mean there, there was one black dude that I saw in the commercial, but like for the most part, and you can always find one person that's going to be an exception to the rule, but it's like, I don't know why white people feel like they need, it's a constant like fuck with or like be out in nature naked. Like we've evolved past that path and why are you doing it? I don't get it. Yeah,

Speaker 4:          44:38          because we're bored. Oh really? Yeah. We don't have a cause we're not being oppressed. It's just you need to give you that sort of mirror. When Russia 16 hours a day, that's it. That's what we jump around and flip around and skateboards and shit. We're bored. Oh Jesus. That's so terrible. I'm not saying it's terrible. We're just board. Generally speaking, white people.

Speaker 6:          45:01          Remember when I showed you that for certain income we're board where there is a white guy like standing on a cliff, like I don't know, like the Grand Canyon or someplace really fucking scary and it's like, you know, white people will do shit like this. But then they'll like cross the street when walking on the same side with like a black person. I know they'll stand on the ledge of some fucking, you know, clever or like Mount Everest. It's like what are you guys doing? Like what are you trying to prove? What all that wrestling gators in the by you like what the fuck is what I love all that. Why and Australian

Speaker 4:          45:30          fucking accent. And then you brought up the by you in fucking new world. Right?

Speaker 6:          45:33          Well like why I really though, it's what the nature in the flocking with animals, why do you do that? I mean, can't you do that with every culture and race? Be like why do you do that? I suppose, but I feel like white people really like push the envelope in terms of these extreme experiences in nature. And like, I don't, I dunno because we were, we don't have any gangs. White people have gangs. What are you talking about? They're like a ferret. Many. There are many white gangs. No, but like, okay. Name Them Jesse James Gang, plant gang. Uh, I'm white. People have gangs come on. You know, like in certain areas like, you know, groups like, well we don't have labs. We have governments, governments, those are you?

Speaker 4:          46:26          I shit, it's like main stream. Okay. I remember a long time ago I got this fucking hilarious talk with Patrice. Can you, can you push that thing so it's not rattling over there? Oh my God. This whole ac situation is, it's what we live in an old house. Okay. The fucking heaters rattled a little bit that we run the AC through freezing in here. Um, oh goodness. You gotta fucking Afghan on. I know. And I'm still cold. That's how I got this hilarious RB one day. Like Patrice when he used to just get sick of white people, would, you know, he just would stop coming down to the club for a little bit and then sometimes he would call me up and vent about white people. No, he would vent at me representing,

Speaker 6:          47:11          okay,

Speaker 4:          47:11          what time I'm sitting at home just being white, you know, hanging out and having a fucking peanut butter and jelly sandwich, phone fucking ranks. I pick it up and like, hello. And he just goes, Bill. He goes, what are white do? And so you made me say a log. What do you mean? He goes, what? What? What do you do? I'm like, I was like, did you just get pulled over by a cop? Like what, what? Where's this coming from? Like what do you mean? What do you mean? What do we do? Like what? He's like, what do you do? Like what do you mean? He's like, black people. We do this, we do that. What do you guys do?

Speaker 4:          47:56          You go as hilarious like you say. Yeah. But the thing about it is, and as you answer him, I fuckin answered them like I go, what do you mean what do we do? You just don't recognize our shit is mainstream. It's, it's like hiding in plain sight so you don't see it. So you don't think that, that you don't think that there's any sort of culture or anything? Like what do we do? Um, the, all the ECC, look at skateboarding. Okay. They came from surfing, you know, and the fucking ways weren't there and Exynos skateboarding and totally evolved in the, to what that is, what stock car, Polynesian people were doing. Stock car racing. I'm not going to sit here and have you, ted tried to tell me that white people didn't come up with anything. I'm just fucking do that. All the fucking Thailand.

Speaker 4:          48:36          Your most advanced ketchup. Shut up. I don't know. Skateboarding. Polynesians came up with skateboarding. I know, but escape. I saw that documentary with Dogtown and see boys and a fucking empty swimming pool at Santa Monica. But I thought skateboarding came from surfing and this is only Polynesian people. I don't know. I could be wrong. He thought what didn't surfing come from Lang indigenous people. Oh No, I'm talking about skateboarding. I know, but skateboarding came from surfing. It was sort of derived of that. Yes sir. Right. So saying but then surfing come from, so you're saying white people don't get credit for skateboard? I didn't say that. I was just asking who came up with a thing that inspired skateboarding. I'm just wondering, I'm just wondering what this is like. Literally then this becomes the argument ended. Pamela. Patrice. All right. Stop cars. Stock car racing. Okay.

Speaker 4:          49:30          That came out of moonshining. What does that stop basically during prohibition when alcohol was fucking illegal, right? What you would do is if you will fucking bringing illegal booze. Moonshine ma'am. Oh cool. You know, cross state lines and all that type of shit. You wanted a fast car, but you didn't want it to look fast. So what you did was it looked like a stock car. I guess stock car you got from Detroit that just looks like a Chevy that looks like a Ford. But underneath the fucking hood you soup the fucking thing up and you were able to outrun the cops and the cops didn't have fucking radios back then. So these guys that did this shit, all right would talk shit about my car is faster than your car. No it isn't blah blah blah blah blah. So they started racing and that started stock car racing.

Speaker 4:          50:15          That's a cultural fucking thing. So then it's on fucking TV. So I started listing all of that shit. He was actually going late. He said, I think at one point he went, he said, good answer, what he said. And I just am like fuck you. I'm not asking for your approval. This whole fucking conversation is annoying. Is that car race seem like something that's very important to people? Like I said, like a big deal. No, no. You're looking at cause cause I know what you're going to do. I think I came out wrong. I'm not, I'm not even gonna get into this music. And then everything in music is somehow going to go back to the fucking blues. Like Beethoven heard the fucking blows and the fucking Irish music and all that. He actually, the nozzle be like, well it all came from the Pyramids and black people built those.

Speaker 4:          51:03          How would you know that? How would you know that? Because you went to [inaudible] dot com and you fucking read shit that said you guys did it. Like that is the dumbest shit. Like that whole fucking credit thing is so fucking stupid. Everybody for coming. So that's African. So that's black. I know. It isn't. No, they're not, aren't there? They're African. Yeah. So that's my point. Yeah. So, so like when you see, when you see an Egyptian guy, right? You think that guy looks like you. Okay. I don't know. I feel like some of them are realized. So I'm French, German and Irish year French. So yeah, I have a little bit of French, but I'm mostly German. Irish. Let me finish. Oh, so I'm European, so mean Italians. Yeah, we're on the same fucking page. So Ferrari. Yeah, that was us. That was us. That was pasty. Freckle guys. We did that shit. Give me a fucking break. No, you guys invented like vodka good and stuff like that, man. No, no. Irish, Russian, sy. Sorry, I don't, I don't know the history.

Speaker 4:          52:04          I didn't want to get into this fucking debate as more of a, like a, yeah, German Irish whiskey. Um, what's the other ones? Bourbon. No. Is that an American thing? Most, yeah. They got just from Scotland. Bourbons, Kentucky whiskey was, but Egypt is Africa now. It's everything is, was nausea's point. Is that, was that a true thing that he said? Africa is a fucking continent. Yeah. It is not a race. It's a continent where you go. So like Irish people take credit for shit that happens in Romania because they're all European. I feel like those are reason why this is different, but I don't know why I said I'm not going to answer that question. Yeah. But I feel like, can I fucking have that written on a tee shirt? Like I feel like an Egyptian per se. I am African or would they say I'm Egyptian? They would probably say I am Egyptian. Yeah. I don't know enough about, all I know is that all this shit is in Africa. So have you met anybody over in Europe saying I'm European. No, they go, I'm French. That's true. I'm swish.

Speaker 4:          53:10          This is a, this is the, actually this is like a toxic, this always becomes a toxic conversation. But credit man, no, I'm talking about you and me. I'm just saying it cause I don't want to stir up everybody cause it's very easily. Yeah, it can go off the rails and it becomes this big fucking race. You're a fucking racist and all this type of shit. Um, resist the urge to read too much into this people. Um, anyways, I'm just so soccer, was it for white people is what you were saying? No, no, no. I'm not saying wow. You know what I hate about this conversation? What I hate about this conversation, I know it's easy. I can't say I can't find anything. If I say it like they can't come back and said it's true though. If I say anything, then all of a sudden it's, it's this, this and this and there's a whole bunch of shit that I'm leaving off cause I'll then become, I'll be called a fucking elitist. Okay. What did we do? We fucking pretend to go the moon.

Speaker 4:          54:12          The space shuttle. That's the shit where you just see it on TV. Okay. That's, that's some shit that we did. I mean that's, that's kind of a cool, no, it's amazing. I know the astronaut's weren't rapping. They didn't have this space suits hanging off their asses. I know that the kids didn't want but the kids coolest, but the kids still wanted to do it. Get the fuck out of here. You got a mother fucker out there. Probably a brown with the, I'm just, I'm just getting your go cause I see you wind to leap out of your skin right now. Uh, I hate when you do that. My brother used to do that. Do what you just say shit to get me going. I'm, I'm being honest with you and I'm saying what I'm feeling and don't just be sitting and you think I can't say some shit to get you going.

Speaker 4:          54:58          I know you can. You do all the time. I'm sorry, I shouldn't have mocked stock car racing or any of that stuff. That wasn't nice. Yeah. The thing, you know what the fuck are the, is one of the greatest things about stock car racing. Okay. Is what's going on. The level of intellect in the pit versus across the racetrack sitting in the stance. That's why I love going. We're car races. And is that why people think that are elitist or something? No, because you've got these guys like what the fuck they have to do because it's so regulated now just to try to squeeze it and then the fucking hundreds of a hundredth of a second to try and win this fucking race. The, the, the level of science, physics and all that shit that's involved that these guide, the fucking eggheads shit that's going on in there and then right across the track is just fucking okay. Okay.

Speaker 4:          55:49          I don't know. I went to the Indianapolis 502 years in a row, I went to drag racing. Do you know in between races they pull the whole fucking engine out and rebuild the whole God damn thing. Inbetween racist. There's a whole team of guys. Why? I don't know why. Because it matters that much. Everything has to be brand new. Okay. I like that cool song you guys made up, right? Brand know everything. Sorry. Everything has to be fucking brand because if it isn't, if it isn't a brand new fucking engine, the amount of money they could you that split second it costs. She was a different like six figures. A lot of money. That's what they're doing. When they stop and all the guys run over and they're like, no, no, no. And drag and drag race. They're, they're changing the engine. I thought they were just like [inaudible] on the tires and like wiping off the windshield.

Speaker 4:          56:38          No, I'm not talking. I'm sorry. Oil and some maybe. No, no. In that type of racing gentlemen, Start Your engines on, ain't one of those little air fresheners from the rear view mirror. Right. Um, you know what I'm talking about a drag racing, you know those long skinny cars with the big fucking tires. Then they got the parachute comes out. Uh Huh. Hey engine sits behind the driver probably figured out to do that after years of them trying to see around it. Why did they have a parachute though? Don't they have breaks? They do, but it's going 300 miles an hour. Oh. So you need all the help you can get and they don't have flaps to put it down and you can't reverse the edge and like a plane. I see. And they're landing faster than a fucking seven 47 but it doesn't weigh as much.

Speaker 4:          57:25          But there's on there, that's all the fucking physics. Okay. And it's also probably if they stop quicker, they don't have to fucking make as big as a track. And that saves, the guy owns the track money, all of this shit. All his fucking nerdy egg head shit. Hmm. All right. Okay. So this is what white people do. They get, they get off, they get on, they get on a dirt bike and they figure out how to go off a ramp and flipping the air two times over, and they landed the foam and they figure out how to do that and then they try to it. Yeah, they were booked board for fucking bored. Why people need gangs again, like if you notice like white people, I thought we weren't going to get on all this and the 20s you, when you had the gangs in New York, was that the 18 hundreds of fucking bills we would do you know what it was? I know I can really track Matt, Matt, Matt, Matt, Matt. Yeah. I could really trash white people, right?

Speaker 7:          58:40          Oh Man.

Speaker 3:          58:42          Was born to run these. Do what? You got space. So let's get another job. I got it. No, no, no.
