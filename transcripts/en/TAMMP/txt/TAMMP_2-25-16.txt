Speaker 1:          00:00:01       Hey, what's going on? It's bill burn his time for the Thursday afternoon, just before Friday. Monday morning podcast data.

Speaker 1:          00:00:14       Just checking in on you. I can't yell at, I am in New York City right now and I'm, it's late. I forgot, you know, today was Thursday and I had to do the Po, the podcast. So I apologize for being late. I, um, I dunno. I, I, uh, I don't know. I wasn't thinking the fuck do you want from me? And all of a sudden I landed and I got a bunch of tweets from people going into it. I thought you were going to check in on me. I was like, God, I'm letting people down. I'm letting you down. So here I am. I'm checking into, so now you're gonna hear it on Friday, but she some lonely bastard on the west coast, you know, still up or some lonely lady. Um, anyways, so I just got here to New York because I'm doing Foxwoods this weekend. And, um, since I left New York, my neighborhood has become extremely gay.

Speaker 1:          00:01:02       And I don't mean it in a way that all the gay people don't like. When you say that neighborhood's gay, like it stinks. I mean like literally gay. I mean men are attracted to men, you know there's Gig eyes up and down, this tripping over each other. And let me tell you something. Nobody's complaining honey, right? So here's the deal. When gays move into your neighborhood, this three stereotypes that everybody says, you know what? Gay people moving into neighborhoods, this is, these are the three things everybody says, right? They say number one, all right, what do they say? They say the neighborhood's going to become safer.

Speaker 2:          00:01:38       Yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:01:39       right? Number two, they say property values are going to go up. And number three, they say there's going to be all these great new fucking restaurants and Holy Shit, the cuisines going to be fucking unbelievable. Thank God that gay showed up. Now this neighborhood can fuck in, you know, live up to its potential. Well, they showed up. Definitely got safer. Definitely less shady. All right, so check on the first one.

Speaker 1:          00:02:09       Stereotype number two. Uh, the fuck did I say it was still property value would go up? Yeah it did. But I miss New York. It goes up everywhere. But you know what? You know what? It's an election year. I don't want to derail the podcast campaign. I'll give you credit on that one. Gay People, it got safer and the property values went up. And then lastly, all this great cuisine was going to come here. And you know what? It's still hasn't shown up. The food in my neighborhood absolutely fucking sucks. And I am so sick of it. Okay. The God damn it. I was told when these gay showed up at the fucking food was going to get better. And I think it not only has it not gotten better, it's actually taken a nose dive. I just went out and got a Burrito. Right. What kind of asshole leaves Angeles and then tries to get a Burrito in New York. You're listening to them, this asshole. All right. The Brita was fine.

Speaker 2:          00:03:06       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:03:06       You know, chicken Burrito, whatever. It's funny, you know, I looked at the menu, it was all this fucking shit. I just looked at the, the waiter, I felt like I disappointed them. I was like, can I just get some chips with guacamole salsa? And like it just like a chicken burrito and I just saw it in his eyes like, oh, you want white people Mexican food? And I was like, exactly. I am as white as it gets and I will have my Mexican food as white as I am, please. Right. Um, and before, you know, Mexico, people write in and tell me that's not real Mexican food. I understand. I get it. Alright, whatever it, this is what the fuck I want it. Here's my question. How do you have all these gay people walking up down the street and you can't even make decent guacamole? How the fuck does that happen?

Speaker 2:          00:03:50       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:03:50       You know, who do I blame in this gay people slipping? Is it because these are the millennial gays and they're just Emoji and each other? You know, I don't know what's going on. Um, I'm blaming the gates. I'm blaming you guys on this one. All right. Whatever pressure used to put on a fucking neighborhood. You're not doing it anymore. Oh, what? You decided not to do it in my neighborhood? I was so fucking, you know the anticipation. Oh, once you guys to send it on this one straight shady fucking neighborhood, you know, and the rainbow flags came out and all this shit. When the fuck is the food truck get in here. That's what I want to know. Fucking pizza sucks. The fucking guacamole sucks.

Speaker 2:          00:04:40       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:04:40       The Middle Eastern food sucks. The whole fucking, they just sucks. Everything is just like, it's

Speaker 1:          00:04:46       you. How much I drink when I'm in my neighborhood. It's just still the fucking food or tea. It's all like, just get shit faced and didn't make it fill up that hole in your stomach. Maybe that's why I'll buy all these gay guys are in such great shape around here. They're cooking it all. Ah, fuck Nah, that pisses me off. I just had a fucking God damn chicken Burrito and Guacamole this late at night. So at my age, I, you know, I'll probably have a heart attack around eight 30 in the morning, you know, at least it could have tasted good, right? Why is it fucking button on it now? It's off. I want, if you guys can hear this shit, whatever the fuck you going to do. I don't know why the fuck I bring my mixer and all this stuff. God Damn. And I'm in a grumpy mood and I was in such a great mood. It's nothing worse than when you're starving and you go out and you'll order a fucking meal, right in a neighborhood that's now a gay neighborhood and it sucks. I mean, I'm talking literally like the two dudes next to me at the end of their fucking meal, right? They fucking like kissed each other tenderly. Can I at least get some fucking decent guacamole?

Speaker 1:          00:05:50       How much greater is it going to be around here? So to get a decent burrito? So I learned that stereotype is not true. Just can say show up. Doesn't mean the chefs are going to start fucking throwing down. They're dropping the fucking ball. I'm not gonna lie to you. When the two went to kiss. Okay. Is as open minded as I am. I have to admit, I was wearing a baseball cap and I tilted it down so I didn't see their lips meet. You know, does that make me a bad person? If you're judging me, can I just tell you that one of them look like that, that fucking scrawny little dude that j Lo married. Just imagine that Guy Kissing Lenny Kravitz.

Speaker 1:          00:06:31       You know, forgive me, I didn't want to see it. You know, we made that makes me a bad person, but whatever. I am a work in progress just like everybody else and I will have a decent bullet. Fucking guacamole. You sons of bitches. All right, let's plow ahead here. So, um, I flew out this morning and I actually have this app on my phone where I can listen to the control tower and I'm just totally nerding out, you know, every time he had the tower talking about our plane, I'm sitting, he's talking about us. He just told us to go onto this little fucking taxi way or whatever, you know. And, um, so I'm flying up front, right? Cause at this point I, I spent 20 years in the back of the plane. I'm not flying. I'm not fucking, I'm not doing that anymore. I'm done.

Speaker 1:          00:07:16       I don't give a shit if I lose money on the gigs, I am flying up front. And for all you guys, for 20 years, I sat in the back of the plane looking what goes on on the other side of that curtain. What happens up there? What is that like? You know what happens up there? People, spoiler alert, you know what happens? They treat you like a human being. I sweat. They do, they treat you the way they treat everybody in the commercials about their airline. Right? Everybody's smiling, having a good fucking time. You know, he got a seat that's actually comfortable. There's nobody leaning on yet. Nobody breathing on you. You're hungry, they bring your food, you're thirsty, they bring you a drink, they treat you like a fucking person posted in the back. Right? Just jamming in there, stuffing in there. Right? So anyways, so I poured first because you know I'm a fancy fucking guy, right?

Speaker 1:          00:08:07       So I fucking I board, right? I can't say fancy guy. Jim Norton says that fancy man, I'm a, I don't know what I am but fucking jerk off, right? So I cannot, I can't underplay right. And um, this fucking lady behind me. All right, the second she gets to a chair and she just starts yelling going, sir, sir, stare, stare. You know, just yelling at this foot that the fucking male stewardess. And he turns around, he's like, Hey, what's the problem? She goes, there's something wrong with my chair. Is this broken? Is it broken? Like freaking the fuck out. And the guy's like, no. The other person just, you know, whoever was sat in this on the last flight didn't bring it all the way to the upright position. Oh. Because I thought it was broken, you know, and write down immediately. Just fucking hated this woman fucking be dementia. This, the sniffles just kept sniffing and shit. Didn't give a fuck about anybody and just, I swear to God the shit that I thought about her because she sat up in the front of the plane, I immediately judged to that she was some rich caught me while I'm sitting up there. Right.

Speaker 1:          00:09:15       I know what she was thinking about me. It was Baldwin. Redheaded fucking, oh he used as miles to get up here. Um,

Speaker 1:          00:09:26       anyways. Oh Jesus. I can, I apologize early for the fucking horrible fucking mood I'm in right now. I was in such a great fucking mood. You don't, and I was actually, you know, walking down the street here in Manhattan. It just laughing, looking at these people, so excited that I left this fucking place. People in their twenties look. Okay, all right. In Manhattan, they just got here. It's still exciting. Okay. But see this, this, this city beat stuff. Fuck out of you. All right. I've always said, you know, if you can do it, if you have a desire to do it, at some point you left. You got to come here and live here just to do it. Cause it really is one of the most amazing cities you're ever going to live in. But you don't. What else is amazing about after you let you owe it to yourself, to Olivia, and you also owe it to yourself at some point to fucking leave.

Speaker 1:          00:10:13       I swear to God, Dude, the amount of people that you see walking down the street that looked like shut ins, that finally just fucking came out of the Cave of a God damn apartment. Jesus Christ. I fucking walk into my building and this lady standing there, she looks like one of the patients on shutter island. Fucking dark circles under her eyes, her hat, Yag down like one of those people that's like ageless. It's like, are you 70 or 26 I don't even know what you just, just, your skin is gray, right? And she's with this older dude kind of look like make it, to be honest with you, a little chunk here, you know, probably a lot more jollier. He's probably not bitching about the guacamole. Right? And I'm fucking like, hey, excuse me. As I go, hey, how are you? And excuse me as I got to walk by and she does like this weird like, Eh, to get out of the fucking way. Like, oh my God, another human big. And then as I go to walk away, she starts singing in this beautiful voice is she walked out, she had an amazing, beautiful fucking voice.

Speaker 2:          00:11:09       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:11:10       Assist. Why? What happened?

Speaker 1:          00:11:13       Jesus fucking Christ. What's like the way she looked and then the sound that came out of it was like haunting. Then I felt like I was in one of those horror movies. You know that now I'm in and now I can't get out. You know what I mean? She's actually a vampire is going to come by later to feed, you know? Then I become her boyfriend forever cause we're both vampires until she gets sick of me and find a fucking, I dunno, a younger version of me. That doesn't happen. Right. The fucking redheaded mail is never a love interest. That doesn't happen in movies, you know? Do you hear us bitching about it? Ah, we boycott in anything. I don't think so. We just trudge on trying to stay out of the sun. That's what it feels like when it comes to New York. Everybody here, did she just go, can you get some sun in your fucking face?

Speaker 1:          00:12:04       Something? What's that vitamin you get when the, when the sun shines on you? It's what I was fucking things. And everybody just says in a bar, Oh Yay Vita, me son's good for you via many, you know, not too much, but you know it's good for you. You know what they say? You know what they say? It raises your levels of, oh is that what they say? So what they say, they're a guy with his fucking name on his shirt. And what do you do? Well, what do you for you fucking unclog during the course of the day? What are you talking medical here for me? For me or to me? Why are you doing that? All right, fucking plumber. I'd say they would. Extreme prejudice. You know, that's the one train I don't respect to plumbing. You know, cause I go to home depot and I swear to God I can almost figure it out.

Speaker 1:          00:12:49       Electrical. That's like wizardry. You're a fucking wizard. I pluck him. He teases me. Me. He just opened the doors. It's everything's right there in the sink. You know, once it goes in the wall, then I give it to you. You know what I mean? Then you're a closer. All right? But if you just find that we to hit it with a wrench, he antique shut off the main fucking water and you're, you're, you're fucking, he, I don't know what you're doing. You're your gun. Screw it. Right. If you can, you can fucking open and cold. Or if you could take the lid off the jar. Do you remember what the thing is that's on top of a jar? Right. You're smart enough to be a fucking plumber. I just don't respect that trait. You know? Look, the the, they really are, they're like welders are the shit.

Speaker 1:          00:13:36       Electricians have the shit. People can fabricate stuff. People will build hot rods. Those, that's the upper echelon. Those are the one they have like the, I work with my hand awards, my hands, I should say. They're not jerking off. I work with my hands when they have those awards. Right. They got to have those at some point. The, well these right, there's some shit. Whatever the fuck it is. You know, those are the people that bring home the fucking hardware. Nobody gives it to a plumber. Plumber. Yeah. Once you go on [inaudible] what trade did you really want to be good at?

Speaker 1:          00:14:12       You know, it's funny right now there's a plumber out there. It's actually getting upset by this and someone will present it on another website is if I was fucking serious. Hang on, I'm trying to get to my fucking password here. Plumber. Jesus Christ. I mean, the whole fucking state doesn't even sound respectable, does it? Um, oh my God. To the other night I fucking met. Lie ahead for a drink. Okay. I was just like, dude, I've been trying not to booze, but I, I gotta I gotta have a couple, two or three, right? So he goes, all right. He goes, you know, I'm doing a spot. I'll meet you over at this bar. So we go to the bar and sitting there with shooting the shit would have a great time. And uh, this is plumber thing, this is what reminded me. So this big guy comes in and by big I mean fat, all right, big mother and hips to puts it on like Oprah Fi's and ass.

Speaker 1:          00:15:01       And then he also puts it on like a dude and he puts it on like a chick and a dude. This was just a fat man and you know, he, he was obese, but he wasn't even biggest loser fat. He just was, he was just tall. He was a mountain of a fucking man. So he sits down at the bar stool just off to off of the, you know, La heads, right shoulder and it's a really not a well lit bar. And I'm just sitting there and I'm looking and he's got this weird design on his pants and I'm just like, what the fuck is that? That's weird. Is that a new style at genium, those bedazzled jeans and everybody was wearing like 10 15 years ago. It looked like he had a horse shoe on, on your pockets. You know, the big thing was to have the stitching it, the blue jeans were blue and then you had the, there was all white.

Speaker 1:          00:15:53       I never bought those. I'm so fucking glad I never bought those. There's not one picture of me and those, it's already pictures of me and Z. Cavariccis okay. I don't need, I don't need to, you know, jump on that trend either, you know. So, um, I'm sitting there going, what is that design? It looked like a like almost like he ordered custom pants and they just, they put this design right and I looked a little closer, my eyes adjusted and I realized it was his Harry. Yeah, ass crack. I couldn't fucking believe it. Okay. This guy sat down, he was so big, dude, I am telling you there was the top of his ass crack. He was so fat. It was like twice the size of my whole ass crack. That's why I didn't take her was that, and it was fucking Harry, I apologize for putting this image in you, but it was Harry.

Speaker 1:          00:16:42       So it looked like it was a design and it, I just can't fucking, and head was caught my eyes when I realize what I was looking at and he was like, dude, what the fuck? And when I told him what had just happened, I don't think I've ever made lie had laugh like that. He was fucking howling in this bar to the point. I think even the guy looked over at us. Oh my God, I kept saying that. I said that you could measure I was going to do it. How can that be? How can that be more ass? Correct?

Speaker 1:          00:17:19       Like this is weird. Like when you lose weight, do, like if you become a fat fuck you have a giant s so yeah. This, I never thought about this. You have this giant fucking ass crack. So when you lose the weight, like the crack goes away too. Right? That doesn't seem like it doesn't make sense to me cause it seems like it's a hole in your body Kinda. You know, I don't, I don't know what I was trying to figure it out. I was, I was riffing about this dog discussing this was a, what the fuck did I say? I would say, and you remember that home run Mark McGuire hitting the king dome off to Randy Johnson. I was saying you could measure that home run with the amount of ass crack this guy had coming out of the top of his pants. And that was just his, that was just as plumber crack. Oh Jesus Christ. What a fucking image they'd gone already ate before I did this. Huh? Um, all right, let's uh, I, Oh God, I wish I had video of my, you know, they always do those reaction videos that just fucking seat. Like you must have done that before. I, you know, when you're looking at, so, oh, what is that? And then you realize, you know, I don't know, pretty mo gross things in your head. Oh God, I got another disgusting story.

And, uh, I got up early and I went into the bathroom to take a shower and I looked down and what looked to be a brown wash cloth, you know, that was all twisted up. Uh, the bottom of the shower, I think, you know, what's his going, I reached down to pick it up and if somebody had, one of my roommates had shit in the shower,

Speaker 1:          00:25:01       I never got over that. I walk them all up, they will all awoken by who? Shit in the shower. And they were laughing because I have think laughing because it was hilarious. And then also I started laughing because it'd be literation later. I did, but like, I literally could not eat with that hand for like fucking a month and thinking now I actually, I don't remember which hand it was, just fucking disgusting. It's the, it's the closest thing. That's the study. It funny. Is it the United, if you laugh at that right now, you're a sick fuck. Um, and who am I if I, I told you about it, right? So anyways, I was on the plane and um, I started watching this space movie and um, you know, it's just another one of those space movies where it's just like, you know, everybody dies or people leave.

Speaker 1:          00:25:51       There's always just like the one person left out in space. How are they going to survive? And I started to watch it. It's like I already saw this fucking movie two years ago. Sandra Bullock did this movie, right? She could go, I left alone when Richard Gere fucking floated off into sweat out his fucking guys name is the guy with the motorcycles, right? Married the lady, finally guy from Ocean's 11, one of those guys. He has so much charisma. All he has to do is just say the fucking line, you know, is that the throw is and it's dirty mustard on it. That Guy George Clooney, George Clooney, he just says the fucking line and yet believe them. Right? Fucking guys fearless. You'd see him in that movie. You didn't give a fuck. Yeah, I'm just going to float off into space. He's still cracking jokes and shit. She going to go over here and suffocate. Take it easy, Sandy. Right? That's it, man. That's all man goes out. I bet once she floated out of her fucking ear shot, he started crying

Speaker 1:          00:26:55       as you sit there and fucking floating around, um, you gotta love Scifi. You know I gotta Love Psi. You know, I said I hate watching real shit about space because all they do is just tell you how infinite it is and how insignificant we are. It's like I get it. I got it. Do you have anything else? Have you filed one fucking living thing out there? You have it. So there's really nothing to report other than it's so fucking immense. And where we still don't have the technology to meet anybody. That's why if you really want to see something about space, she got to watch a Scifi movie, you know, say what you want a bottom at least a fine shit. You know there's car chases and people, you know, a hot chick aliens, right? Space bars and stuff like that. You fucking put on one of those bravo shows.

Speaker 1:          00:27:52       Would that black guy there who fucking knows everything. What's his name? He's like that. He's like the guy from the matrix, Laurence Fishburne, except it's just fish board Fishburn whatever. He's like that guy, except he's real. It's a Lawrence is real. I'm talking about his character. I fucking watch that guy. I've watched that guy like three times and I just was, he had me believe in that. We came from the trees. I'm like, this guy is. Yeah, we, and I was like, I thought we came from the ocean, a mud. I was going with that and this guy was like, no, we're from the trees. We've got the same fucking, I don't know what he said, but I mean, there was nothing between my ears. I could argue with anything that he said. You just have to fucking listen to it. I'm not, but just sitting there watching the guy just going like, this has gotta be what it's like when you joined a cult. Like how dumb I feel right now. This is what you have to do. Like I was reading this, this fucking thing, who's getting who I was browsing and I don't really read anything. Um, I saw this picture and I just put words to it, my brain, and now I'm telling it to you. There's some fucking guy I know. He had like 80 wives, one of those fucking Weirdos out in fucking Utah. You know what I mean?

Speaker 1:          00:29:02       Did I? Oh, either that or he's just like, how come rappers don't talk about those guys? They're always talking about fucking pimps. How could a guy, that's key. The guy's got 80 fucking women. They all know about each other and they're all smiling in the fucking picture. Huh? I want to see somebody else pull that off and not live in the middle of fucking Utah. I don't know what the fuck it is about Utah, but you could talk a woman into anything out there. You're the a one for me. Hi. Yeah, you and they'll 79 other bitches. Okay. But God, man, bitch. MMM.

Speaker 2:          00:29:44       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:29:44       This guy is in prison and he's still running. That's this Harem.

Speaker 1:          00:29:48       They don't know any better. You know when you're walking around with a little house in the prairie close, I mean, he could fucking tell people anything. That's the key. You know what I mean? It's like if you want to start a cult, it's very difficult to start it with people that have gone to a department store and bought their clothes, you know? But if you, if there is a group of people that are standing there and close that they made themselves you, that that's where you start. You know what I mean? It's like when you got a shit team, all right, and you got the number one draft, pick the, the t, the guy, the person you're going to build your fucking team around. That franchise player. When it comes to cult, those still to franchise tag is on all those people with those little house in the prairie close, those Quaker close, right. The QC,

Speaker 1:          00:30:36       you know, you ever think about start? I'd start at cult. I would do it, you know, I would definitely start a fucking cult, but then I, after a while I wouldn't want to do the work and I would just sort of, I'd start like a, what do they call that? When you fucking don't want to do your job and you have other people do delegating. I'd start delegating all the fucking things and granted one point. So people are going to be like, whoa, hey shit was Jason's, how come he's not doing anything? I don't remember reading anything about change being be lazy.

Speaker 2:          00:31:04       Yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:31:05       let, he just sits around and fucks everybody.

Speaker 1:          00:31:12       I'm going to check it is no shit. Maybe I'm Jesus. Right? And then he takes over and then all of a sudden they all show up one day. You know, is there anything scarier than angry, stupid people standing in clothes that they made themselves? Just picture what that would look like. You know the amount of Mano Browse staring back at you and you just have to relinquish your power and just at some point, easy way out the back door and let them know that you're not the son of God. There's a fucking afternoon for you. Huh? Jesus Christ. Tommy deadbolts would you have on your bedroom door? Um, speaking of which, by the way, I got all the fucking interior door locks fixed on my house. They all have fucking skeleton keys. And then I found this fucking person on the Internet, on the interweb is Richard Rollins says from fast and loud. Uh, another great shell. Um,

Speaker 2:          00:32:07       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:32:07       I got some of that's going to line it up with the door jam. You know, the little fucking latch thing there. And then I'm going to be good to go. It's going to be, fuck. I can't wait. Very excited about that. And speaking of great shows, I'm finally caught up with better call Saul. I feel like such a, not only a bad fan considering, you know, Vince hooked me up to be in. I'll have a small part in breaking bad. I should have been watching right along. But what happened was those of you who listened to the podcast last year, I fucking was taping the thing. If for some reason I didn't get episode three and then I suck computers and the Internet, I couldn't figure out where else I could watch it. So I've been stuck on episode two. So finally they came on Netflix right before season two started. And I just binge watched the entire first season and it was fucking unbelievable.

Speaker 2:          00:32:55       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:32:55       Who's fucking amazing starts. It just, it's, I don't want to ruin anything for you, but I gotta tell you something like a, the level of acting that, that, uh, everybody's doing, but like Bob owned Kirk, man, you don't, it's very rare that someone does, is as great a comic as he is, is equally as great a fucking actor. He was, I want you guys to watch it just because you got to see, he has just blowout fight. I can't ruin this for you. What's the relative? Any now you just say mean shit to each other.

Speaker 2:          00:33:29       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:33:29       Haze brothers says something to him. I've been thinking about that line for like the last five fucking days. It was just, I don't know. It's one of those lines.

Speaker 2:          00:33:40       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:33:40       That in real life usually get set around the holidays after you've been sitting on something for 20 fucking years and when it comes out, it's needle off the fucking record and the relationship is over. It's just like, yeah, dude, I'll see you when you're on your deathbed or I'm on my deathbed, or maybe never again. I mean, it's, it's a fucking rap. It's over. Um,

Speaker 2:          00:34:05       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:34:06       Oh Man. Though the writing was just, it was just fucking outstanding. And I'm the can't say enough good things about it and I am totally caught up and, uh, I can't wait for next week's fucking episode. There you go. There's my little plug there for better call Saul. Um, and with debt, that's it for this, uh, checking in on your podcast. Once again, I apologize for, you know, for not doing the podcast on a timely fashion, a timely fashion. I where the fuck you said and I realized that I brought up that APP. Sorry about the shit in the shower story. The ass crack one was funny. I don't give a fuck who you are by the way. That APP is three 99 that I, when you, if you want to listen to the towers, anywhere where you're at, it's a called live a t c.

Speaker 1:          00:34:48       Dot. Net App. Just do that ATC air traffic control. Um, and it's really cool. Like I just thought you could listen to the towers and near you, but you can actually, um, I was at lax today, Dan. I was listening to, uh, Logan Airport in Boston and it's really cool cause you, you're basically like, I'll click on California, they got Burbank, camera, real Concorde, any place in El Monte, any place you want to go to. And when you click on it as I'm doing right now, okay, this one has ground and tower and then you click on that. Um, and then there's what's really cool is they have like a diagram of the airport. So like you can actually, you know, I like to listen to what, whatever, whatever airport I'm at as we're taxing to the, um, to whatever the fucking runway, Jesus Christ bells, you know, you'd think you'd know that.

Speaker 1:          00:35:44       Um, go out to the runway. I just like listening to it and it's fucking cool as shit. And um, you know, watching the, um, Jason Spill all the taxi ways going by, sorry, I'm trying to multitask here. Answering a text message. I apologize. Let me just put the fucking phone down. See that, see that, pick it up. And all of a sudden I thought, I'm just starts clicking on other stuff and we'll start fucking looking at Twitter when I'm trying to do a podcast here. Anyway, she got the whole layout of the airport and as you're going down he can tell what taxi way you're on. And then, uh,

Speaker 3:          00:36:22       right

Speaker 1:          00:36:24       there you go see that. You just listened to that shit. So that guy just obviously was cleared to land and that was the runway and he said his tail number. That's it. So I just listened to that shit because that's one of the hard things when you first get a pilot's license, when you get up there and I'll just sounds like, yeah, join it down. We're, I'm gonna Plant Plant, plant. They don't even have southern accents, but that's what the fuck it sounds like to me. Um, you know what's funny is when this shit happens, when I, uh, when I'm just like walking around, like I'll accidentally set up pocket dialing, I'll hit this fucking APP. And, uh, if you're in the mob, do not get this fucking app because they'll think it's a bunch of fucking feds in a, in a van down the street. You know, if you fucking sitting there in a mob meeting and all of a sudden you got this fucking thing going and you're talking about some bullshit and out of nowhere this thing comes on. Come on. Just do it one time. One more time for me. Come on. This is Lex.

Speaker 1:          00:37:26       Oh, it's a quiet night out there.

Speaker 3:          00:37:29       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:37:29       You know what I mean? All of a sudden you just hear some fucking guys voice in there talking to some official, hey, who the fuck up their fucking, next thing you know the Yan can get tongue through your throat. Um, all right, so that was a long way to go. Why would it go? Who uses a prop and a podcast? All freckles does. Hey, go fuck yourself. She can't. So I hope you have a great weekend. And I a little music from Andrew Samela sat a little throwback podcast from a Monday or Thursday gone by,

Speaker 1:          00:38:34       you know, a few weeks ago somebody was asking me, Ah, you know, they wanted to break up with somebody and I was saying, listen, you gotta listen, you know, the person who has it down how to do the breakup was minivan men podcast, own celebrity star Al Madrigal. But if you don't have time to email Al Madrigal just listened to ll cool j a big old, but I don't know why. I never really listened to him when I was growing up. You know, Mama said knock you out. Oh, did shake, is that what she said? Ll Cool J I don't care. You know, I just wasn't into it. And his deodorant and his armpits when he was jamming with those white guys. I just, I never got into it. But lately like I dunno, I dunno what happened. I, Geez, just come onto my youtube shit. I don't know what it is, but I was listening to some of his stuff.

Speaker 1:          00:39:32       Oh, I know why. Yesterday. I was trying to remember like what was that song he used to have that I'm the type of guy and you're the type of guy get put back, but what the fuck was that? And then I listened to it and I kind of liked it, but I hated that. Oh, we owe part of it really annoyed me. I'm like, oh, that's why I never downloaded this shit. But then on the side they had a ll cool j big old, but you know I played drums at Michael. Let me hear what this tracks track sounds like. Can I put it on? And he basically teaches you how to break up with a girl and that song, but that rap or that, uh, that rhyme, whatever, however you supposed to say it, he breaks it down and just in like fucking 11 seconds, he sits his girls down.

Speaker 1:          00:40:17       He's basically hanging out and like some sunglass hut or some shit and some girl comes in with an insane ass and he does what every guy does. He stares at it. He thinks I want to fuck that, but oh shit, I have a girlfriend. So what does he do? Does he sneak around on her? No, he goes home and he sits her down and he says, listen, I met this girl named Tina. Okay, Tina's got a big old, but I know that I said I'd be true really whiteness up, but Tina got a big old butt so I'm leaving you. It's, I mean that's just fucking airtight. You can't fuck with that. He was 100% I don't even know if she could get mad. I think that I think women's show expect guys to be lion weasely pieces of shit that if you actually hit him with that level of honesty, I think they would just be stunned. Just like the chicken, the video, like I didn't think that that was bad acting. I think that they would absolutely be stunned if you just came home and said, listen, I met this girl. I know that. I said it'd be faithful to you, but she's better looking than you, so I'm breaking up with you.

Speaker 1:          00:41:38       What is the combat? There's nothing that'd be like if your girl came home and said, listen, I know we're together, but this guy, you know, I met him at the mall is Dick is twice the size of yours and he's got a better car. So, uh, it's kind of a no brainer. Amati what are you going to do? What are you gonna do with your little dick in your fucking Domino's pizza? It's over. You just got to fucking be like, you know, you only go around once. So, uh, yeah, I, I, I get it. So anyway, so if you don't have time to a email Al Madrigal, which you should, which you should just listen to a ll cool j big old bud.

Speaker 1:          00:42:25       You got to see his face. He goes, so I'm leaving you. It's, it's, I don't, can't explain it. It's way meaner than it has to be. That's what it makes it funny cause there's a way to read that where you kind of letting them down easily, you know, but he didn't, he just did it like, yeah, this is how it works. So there you go. Look at that on a holiday. Um, anyway, so this is the Monday morning podcast. It is the end of May. Everybody. All right, how many days are in May? 30 days has September. His throat is April and November. All the rest have a bunch of other dates except for stabby wary Yag. Go Fuck yourself with your song. Um, she got 30 31 fuck, what is it? April has 30. June has 30 maze. 31 I got the little thing. I can click right here. Oh, I have a computer. I don't need to think right. It has. Why is it in September? Oh for Christ sake, do I have to click another button? It has 31 days.

Speaker 1:          00:43:37       All right, so you had till have, do you guys have until Thursday midnight to make something of May, 2012. All right. Are you in a fucking relationship? You don't want to be in? Do you want to be in this relationship? You don't want to be in, in June? Why don't you celebrate the end of May by getting out of your fucking relationship and sitting down and basically just go with the ll cool j vibe. Hold her hand and just go straight up honesty and then w w what's she gonna do? What's he going to do if they're going to flip the fuck out, but the the die has been cast to ship is set sail. The ball is already rolling. The Sun is setting, the rain has fallen. Wherever the fuck you want to call it. It's out there. Just put it out there, let him scream and yell and then you had as much as he suck, you're going to be like, okay, I did it.

Speaker 1:          00:44:32       I did it. Now I just got to sit here and get yelled at. And uh, how long could somebody really yell before they lose their voice and hour, 90 minutes and an hour and a half. I'm going to be in the car listening to ll cool j driving away from that thing I didn't want to be in. All right then. I know I talk about this shit a lot, but I think a lot of people are in situations like this and they don't know how to sit somebody down. It just say, so I'm leaving you. You know, if I was ll cool J and I stop, you know, selling tickets and all that type of shit, that would be a side business that I would have. I would take,

Speaker 4:          00:45:12       okay,

Speaker 1:          00:45:13       that little fucking rhyme that he had and I would custom do it for everybody in their life and just, and then people who just write you all right, I need to charge it. You charge them 100 bucks and he would write you a, you know, four bars. It all rhymes and you just get out. Exactly.

Speaker 4:          00:45:33       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:45:33       What you say it, you know?

Speaker 4:          00:45:37       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:45:38       Just be like you eat with your mouth open. I know I said that I'd be true.

Speaker 4:          00:45:45       Yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:45:46       but you eat with your mouth open so I'm leaving. You just get right. Get right down to it. Your mom is a fucking con. I know I said that I'd be true, but she's fucking always coming over here and, and something that rhymes with [inaudible] you I, you got the, you got the idea right? Jesus Christ. What do I have to be yellow?

Speaker 3:          00:46:36       Okay,

Speaker 5:          00:46:38       let's get back into this. Mark from a dozen a fury. Yeah, I guess so. All right.

Speaker 6:          00:46:43       Hi. What's up? [inaudible] standing here with the guys from a theories, I think. How do you guys think you sound one today? No, I think it went really well man. I mean it's probably that then the hottest day so far and the whole tour. But you know, we're Texas boys. Where do you see the hate? So I get up there. Let's do our thing man. So you guys are like brand new. You guys have won a contest or something to get on this? Um, yeah, I mean we, we won a contest to be on the show. I mean to, you know, be on the tour. But you know, we've been a band for about two years now. I've been torn on her own and doing her own thing and you know, this was pretty much just a blessing and a big step forward for us. Definitely a blessing. How, well

Speaker 5:          00:47:19       this is what I'm trying to get these guys to say some fucked up like what you do on tour and these guys, we still have to cover it in tattoos. They all look like Mick Mars. Yeah, Motley Crue and they just, I'd like the nicest guy. Like everything's a blessing. Everything blessing to be here. I know what I said at the last days. God willing, we'll go on for the next tour. I'll try to angle it towards some sort of smart and they just keep going back to the church. Remember that when we did the Oz fest thing and they're, they're eating vegetarian meals backstage tofu and drinking a little green tea. It's like, what's your old, you're going to help set it up. They and watch behind the music they saw not happens. Meanwhile you listen to behind them to say a contract soundtrack to hell is playing. Right. I know there's something going on in the background that just listen to music.

Speaker 6:          00:48:04       How well, how well do people know you're here? Um, so far it's been great. I think we've done two signings and they've been tagged it tons. A kid. What's the, what's the biggest asshole crowd you guys have been in front of him? Just been like, fuck you. You're the open advance. None yet man. They've all been really cool. I think like not expecting us to do what we actually do. You know, everybody thought we were still be some MTV show man and stuff like that, but it turns out, you know, everybody's like, man, you guys blew us away and it's really cool. Like there's lots of boards from the fans and shit. So I mean that's cool. Hey, you have the other drama, right? Have you ever like went to throw the drum sticks in the crowd and some dude was pissing you off so you can kind of rather than tossed it, just fucking throw it at him? Not really that. It's just not, could put an eye out.

Speaker 5:          00:48:48       We wouldn't do things like that. That makes sure a rubber tips and I guess we have special styrofoam drum sticks that we throw out. So it was not to injure any of our loving fans. Wow. They'd, we're not biting. Even these hardcore fans have become PC. It gets even better. I sat out, it starts like

Speaker 6:          00:49:06       see again. So many people talk really called so long person who gets the most puzzling. None of us. We're all, we're all, we're all taking man.

Speaker 5:          00:49:17       Ah, we're in loving relationships with lovely women. It's just, it's just the most anti rock and roll. Wow. Can Roll band.

Speaker 5:          00:51:05       Right? Listen, you can do each with each band. Cause I had no idea what they were. So with each band I just made whatever the PSA was more ridiculous, just always had them like throw it. Just throw a couple of fucks in there.

Shadows fall? Yeah, same shit. I just would ask them questions and we'd go nowhere and then I just had them do a PSA. I did. Well we got to listen to until we get to the PSA. It's Brian from shadows fall.

The whole hospice. This is incredible, man. You know, sharing a stage with me and Sabbath does doesn't get better than that. How to help me sing like that for so long. And I yelled at my dad like that about 20 minutes. I'm used to it for you. Hold on my girlfriend, how much, you know, you know, builds it up. You've got to build the strength, you know, like, you know what, I'm going to do that drop right now. You know, it's good. I'm glad you brought that up. We had a open, Anthony's doing like a thing for like domestic violence awareness. Yes. Somebody kicked the shit out of their girlfriend and like Newark or something. So yeah. So just, just ad Lib, some sort of dropped and not to domestic violence to your girlfriend or whatever. Not, and you know, it's kind of weird, but toss a couple f bombs and that I listened to as a retarded, but just try to keep the good message. So just describe shells fall.

Speaker 5:          00:53:00       Oh, it's such a great gag. Rockville. You're gonna have to come back and Redo this, uh, this new Gig, right? This is your thing,

Speaker 6:          00:53:17       girlfriend, you know, fucking don't beat. If you grow this bribe and shadows fall man, you gotta stop punching your girlfriend out there. Save that shit for the bedroom. You know that's where it's at. But you know, don't take it to the streets. Okay. Do it again is just throw like one fucking got their idiots. What's those five shadows fall? Just say stop hitting your fucking girlfriend. You Idiots. All right. Saved to violence for the bedroom. Cool. So uh, what do you guys call from him? Uh, after this? Uh, where the hell are we doing? Well we're two days here and then we got yo, I don't even know where we go.

Speaker 6:          00:53:52       Dust and they bring me where I got to be. That's hilarious. What do you, what did you think about playing out here in the eye? The parking lot. Do you think it was, give me one like a seated area cause I know I did. I was thinking like we're actually, we're all on the main stage so you know that's it. I like the parking lot by it actually better cause there's no seats in a way. Cause he can go crazy. Let's stay, you know we're going to be played with where their seats. So it's a little different, but you know it works out. How long you guys been a band full? Oh, almost 10 years. X amount. Well good deal. You got to, you've got a new album or anything coming out the war. What with it's been out for a little while. We're going to be doing one more tour after all semester and then working on new records. So keep an eye out for that. Well that's awesome. Well, always keep us post event. Thanks. Thanks for that.

I was, hey, how was your set today man? Uh, it's going to be fine. All right, we need to start that again. So I don't look like a retarded assessing. Do you said going to go tonight looking forward? You on the main stage? I think it's going to go great. We always put in 150% know sitting down crowd, but so far the oldest shows has been nice and so I'm pretty sure today will be as well. So you guys don't like Yo vibe, you come home mellow, melodic. Does that like how you guys are? I think we're metal. It's, you know, it's hard to categorize us. It's basically all right. So you're not like, I had made me watch movies and stuff. You're like, I made me. I guess we could say that, but it wouldn't be unfair probably to just categorize it into, you know, we're metal bat. That's cool man. That's cool. How long have you guys been playing? A long time. I think it's like 12 years. Something like five years. Everybody in the band. If you had to kill someone, who would you kill myself? The road sign and gets you? No, no, but I mean it wouldn't be fair.

Speaker 5:          00:56:14       God, there's just no one would go with it. No one wants to come next. Fair to the others.

Speaker 6:          00:56:21       Wouldn't be fair. Otherwise. I like this guy. This guy can tell you like the peacekeeper in the band, right? You're like the mellow one. Unless the man, what else is doing now, this is kind of a side name, but kind of doing this so there's benefit. Somebody beat up a special needs kid and like, no. And uh, so we just want you to just say, you know, just give a shout out to the kids so they know not to beat up somebody with like, you know, special needs, you know, so just, you know, say like a, you know, hey guys, you know, it's not cool to beat up on somebody just because they're different or whatever. You know, just, you know, just like a quick kind of like, uh, like a soundbite and it's kind of weird, but throw a couple of puffs in there just cause I find the kind of retarded, you know what I mean?

Speaker 6:          00:56:58       So you didn't like, you know, just winging it goes, it was the spirit of room place. She shouldn't treat everybody equally and uh, don't beat anybody up or do something bad to them. Just feel so different and everybody is the same way. Okay. That's totally the perfect vibe. Just throw in special needs and throw in like one or two fucks. They have the awkward, it's kind of like I said, they're retarded. Same thing again or sorry, the spit of blue flame. Treat everybody the same way. It'll be people still special needs to reflect us. Go and fucking go on to and do any which would cause a different Truett ever go to the same. That's beautiful. And the kid's name is Russell. Just give him a shout out to Sam Fox and a big metal fan. So it means a lot to, unless the kid has got beat up, Russell from newer Russell, the fuck you doing six hours of do. That's beautiful. Matt, thanks so much and good luck tonight.
