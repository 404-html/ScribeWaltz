Oh, freckles is going, Dad, Dad, dad fucking looked in the mirror last night. I could tell I was starting to lose weight, maybe feel good. You know what I mean? That's, it's a fucking tough thing being a redhead, you know, use a really small window that you have to exist in or else the beating start again and it's really something you can understand. Um, all right, I'm all over the fucking place. I got a bunch of Shit I have to do. I'm having some family over today for a fucking cookout. I'm going easy this year rather than trying to smoke something and blah, blah, Blah and do all that shit. I'm just fucking go on burgers and dogs, burgers and dogs the way it used to be before the fucking food network showed up and everybody's got to be like a top chef.

Speaker 1:          00:02:38       You know? Remember you were growing up. That's what it was. It was burgers and dogs and everybody was fucking happy right till the booze started coming around and then, yeah, and it got a little sideways. But I mean it happens. So, uh, yesterday, um, had some friends over, we had some cigars, right? And uh, you know the deal, it's like, all right, your buddies are coming over, you're wife's going to be like, how are they going to bat? Um, even if they're cool, like my wife's cool, but there's always going to be in element of, Hey, are you going to bear? They're going to be loud. They're going to be upstairs and as, Huh? It's like, yeah, I'm having people over. Do I do that? When you have a little twice, do I? You have them over for the fucking wines and you're all sitting there laughing with your high pitch fucking voices.

Speaker 1:          00:03:29       You don't think that that's put in cracks in the walls? I don't, I don't fucking bitch about it. I go down to the old fucking hardware store. I get out to spackle. Right? Okay. Well with Debbie little cat, go write another fucking line in the wall. You don't hear me complain and got my putty knife out. Oh, you have a good time, ladies. Right. Um, anyways, uh, so we have, we were, uh, hanging out with actually fucking hilarious because I'd gone out and I bought, you know, got some Cuban cigars. I want to fuck it. I cleaned everything up. Right. The thing that, what you want to do, this is what I've realized when you live in with a woman, which you want to do, is you just go all out. Right? You fuck, I cleaned the fucking place up. Okay. I even like, like the deck on the back, like I fucking hosted off.

Speaker 1:          00:04:22       So they wouldn't be traipsing dirt in and out of the house or whatever. Right? And she's sitting there going like, wow, you're really going all out. Yeah. There's a reason Sam Kinison, there's a fucking reason. There's a fucking reason why. Because what you want to do is what you're doing is you just put yourself into a position where you did absolutely nothing rock. So when they complain, cause there's still going to complain. You got all of this fucking Amall right? I cleaned this whole fucking place up, right? Cleaned out the back porch down the backyard, the whole fucking thing, cleaned it up. And we're having family over here today, which was another great one to be like, well I'm also doing it for your family, right? So, um, I'm doing all of this shit. I got, I got the boots, I got the fucking thought, the outdoor patio furniture.

Speaker 1:          00:05:17       I got everything all cleaned up. I got an ash tray upstairs. I've got one downstairs. I got the backyard lights on. I got the whole fucking thing, I got the music, I got the whole thing. And then it like six o'clock at night I realized I didn't get cigars. I bought cigars, but I don't have a humor door. And I said I was going to pick them up and I had this fucking panic attack because it was Sunday before the fourth that they were going to close and it was six excruciating rings before they picked up. And I was able to run down there and get them right. And um, they showed up, I ordered some pizzas and all that fucking shit. And here's the best part, right here was the best part. I, my wife went to sleep, right? We smoking, we're telling fucking stories, you know, I got all these orange sodas for myself, right?

Speaker 1:          00:06:06       And I turns out everybody there wanted one because it had the real sugar and it went great with the cigar. I'm telling you, Cuban Cigar in the fantail orange soda is the Shit, right? They drank all my orange soda. So I had to drink grape soda like a fucking six fucking year old, right? So, um, anyways, the end of the night it own it. I fucking cleaned up everything. You wouldn't, you wouldn't even fucking know. You wouldn't know a guide that you wouldn't know that a fucking soul was here. And that's what you do. All these fucking married guys who sit there, you know, it's that back and worth it. It is fucking worth it. It just, you just have to do it perfectly, right? You go all out, you clean up the fucking place, they come over, you have a great fucking time. When you leave, you fucking cleaned the whole place up against what can she say?

Speaker 1:          00:06:55       What is she going to say to you? You're not allowed to have friends. Um, little things like that, cause I've had buddies in my coming over here like on dude, you fucking, what are you doing? You did all that and you're fucking wash the dishes. It's, there's a, there's a genius behind what I do. I'm talking shit here. I'm drinking throat coat tea and I'm talking shit. What can they fucking say? Then what it is is if you do everything perfectly, then they're leaving themselves totally exposed. If they start complaining that they're all that basically can complain about it at that point is that you have friends and you invited them over to the house. All right? And they know they don't have a fucking leg to stand on. So the bitch and goes down by like 90% now if you have your fucking friends over and you leave the fucking ash tray out and there's footprints all over the fucking place, they can make it about that when the real thing is, is they don't want you to have friends, right?

Speaker 1:          00:07:56       But they can hide behind the other shit. But then the real thing is they don't want you to have friends and they want to slowly kill you so that they can, you know, have the house to themselves. And if you, you know, go to the obituaries, there's a bunch of guys dropping around 58 59 60 and that, that's what happened. What really happened was they had friends over and they didn't clean up, you know, which gave their wives the window to bitch them into an early grave. And now they're sitting there in the fucking house having a hell of a time, right? Getting to play the victim, getting all the sympathy cards and eating all the poundcake.

Speaker 1:          00:08:34       And that's a fact, you know, come in with the truth here in the 4th of July. Hannah at the fuck I'm talking about anyways, so afterwards, right? So we're drinking sodas. I'm stone sober, right? And everybody leaves except for one of my other buddies. And um, he wasn't an AA. Right? The older you get, the more your friends fucking, they quit. You know what I mean? They just fucking quit. It's like being a lifer in the military. Everybody doesn't sign back up. All of a sudden you're the old guy, you know, fucking walking around where it out. Fuck all my friends go. Right. Walking around. All Sad. But you fucking smokey the bear hat.

Speaker 2:          00:09:13       All right. Hey you. Um,

Speaker 1:          00:09:18       so he still drinks so they leave. So I get out to giant fucking ice cubes. A poor couple of Johnny blue,

Speaker 2:          00:09:25       right.

Speaker 1:          00:09:26       And uh, you know, he has to drive. So He's, he's doing a little sippy cup shit. And I live here, so I'm doing the home porch, right. Thousand 1000, 2003 seat, right. One of those ports. So I have a couple, two, three of those. I'm feeling good. And, uh, you know, but I'm not, I cleaned the whole fucking dude when I say I cleaned the whole, the, all the leftover pizza. I wrapped each slice individually and foil and then I put a letter on it. Pay for Pepperoni, s facade sausage m for fuck in. Margaret took the pizza boxes out, put them in the recycle Bin, took out the fucking chemicals, fucking spray down the counters. You wouldn't fucking do that. God Damn forensic team of forensic cards with their fucking dusters would come in, would have no fucking idea anything happened. Right? So now I'm feeling all proud of myself. I got my little fucking sippy drink there and I put on the TV cause I'm not ready to go to bed yet. And what do I see? Time life books or whatever. Time-Life records presents. Easy listening. Love songs. Right? And I'm sitting there watching it, right? I'm not in love. Don't fuck it. Asked me a pitch. Put Your picture on the wall, cause it to stay there. Right. I'm like, I remember that fucking song and we'll can forget this one angle. Bird Hopper, Dick,

Speaker 3:          00:10:49       please roll.

Speaker 1:          00:10:55       Geez. Do you ever listen to the lyrics of that song? It's like, for fuck's sake, just break up with her. He goes, says something like, I've talking about, I found a new love. Her lips are warm and yours is so cold. It's like angled park. Just enough with the fucking details. Just break up with you. Your just say, look, I'm not in love with you anymore. You know, going to bring up the other fucking broad down the street. Just got your heart racing. You fucking cunt. It's such a country song. But you know, I heard it when I was younger, so I'm listening to all of these fucking songs. God doesn't make little green apples and fucking something, something babble. And next thing you know, I'm on the phone calling one 800 gimme those fucking cds. So the guy picks up the phone and he goes, Hey, this is rob from time live records.

Speaker 1:          00:11:47       Who Am I speaking too? Let's see, I'm blank. You speaking of Bell, rob, how you doing buddy? Got Abdu it. Great. Uh, what, what, uh, what can I do you for? I'm like, well, you know, I'm watching ankle bearcomm predict given this broad too much information. But uh, you know, I like the sound of it. I want to order the CDS. And he goes, great, great. Can I get a phone number? I'm like, no, you can't not giving you my phone number. He goes, well then I can't complete this order. Just like that. Like I was the 90th person in a row that said, I'm not giving you my phone number.

Speaker 4:          00:12:21       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:12:21       Right. And he was tired of hearing. He just went, he gave me the old right there, Fred. Well they're like, can't do the order. Is there anything else I can help you with? And I'm like, Whoa Way Rob. Well what's going on? We just went from zero to 200 here.

Speaker 1:          00:12:33       Why do I have to give you my phone number? And he's like, oh you have to get phone numbers so we can complete the order. It's like, I understand you're saying that but I'm asking you why. And he goes, oh it's cause it's company policy. And I'm like, why is it company policy if he goes, because I need the phone number in order to complete the order. I go, okay. See what we just did there? We just drove in a circle. Okay, I'm trying to get out of the centrifical fucking force here and get over to the reason the fucking racing. Right.

Speaker 4:          00:13:04       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:13:05       And he finally just goes, well, you know, the reason is that if it's a problem with your order, we need to to call you. And it's just like, well, if there's a problem with the order, meaning you charging my card in the cds, don't ever come. You don't think, I'm not going to call you. You get literally had, when I called up, if there's a problem with your order, press two.

Speaker 1:          00:13:30       So he just, can we just keep going round and round? I go, you just want the phone number and I go, not you personally, but time life does. So they can sell it to other people. Next thing you know, I'm walking, my dog had some Qantas calling me up going, congratulations, you're the lucky business winter of whatever, right? So it fucking escalates to a really hostile, you have a good night, sir. I'm like, Yo, I have a good night to rob, right? Hang Up. And I'm sitting there for a second, right? Doing the whisper, yelling, fucking cocksuckers they can fucking stupid enough to give you my phone number, right? All by myself. Look like a complete lunatic, you know? And in the background, the fucking commercial still on Muskrat, the amps in that fucking cock sucking mother fuckers. Right? Just fucking send me the fucking shit. I bought this before. I never had to give you my phone number. Three easy payments of 29 95. Right? You get my fucking money.

Speaker 1:          00:14:28       You gonna call me up page. It's this rob who time, life, just calling to check to see if he got those cds, right? So anyways, um, I really want these fucking cds. So I called back again and for some reason I just started to just go into a southern accent. And I was like, when they asked me for their phone number, I'm just for my phone number, I'm just going to give them their number. See if they, they notice like, can I get your phone number? Sure. What 800. Right. I was going to do that shit. But uh, what happened was by the time the lady picked up there, it was the end of the infomercial, it went on to something else. You know, something that me then makes you skinny or fucking helps clean up after you goddamn kids. I forget what it was. Right? So she, she answers the phone. She's like, Hey, this is so blah, blah blah blah blah from fucking time. I'm like, I don't, I liked the order them a easy listening. Uh, Sadie's five easy payments of 29, nine to five. She's like, okay, can I get a name? Who Am I speaking to? Unlock Bill. Bill Burr, right. Just totally, it does not sound like a southern name. Whatever southern and Joe, Bill Burr. Um,

Speaker 4:          00:15:35       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:15:35       And uh, she goes, can I get a phone number? I just decided I was just going to give her area coach. I was like, my phone number is eight one eight three two, three, two, one, two, five [inaudible]. And she goes, okay, that number is a 183-TWO-THREE-2125. I'm like, yes it is. Yes ma'am. Just lied. I got my tapes. They're going to fucking show up, right my cds. No fucking problem.

Speaker 4:          00:16:04       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:16:05       I gave them a fake email,

Speaker 1:          00:16:09       like I said, too damn tall@aol.com and you're what that means. Can I get an email arts? It's a two the number two number two and d a m n tall. Like I didn't say damn like I was trying to be polite so then she had to read it back. So that email is number two d a m n tall@aol.com I like, that's right. Yes it is. And I got him common five fucking cds, five CDs for 30 bucks. Three payments. I don't know what the fuck. What is this going to be? A lot of cds. You know what's funny? My Prius still has a CD holder. What my new car gets here at won't and then what the fuck do I do? Well, I know and I do. I sell them for one easy payment of nine 95 on Ebay, you know, and no phone numbers required. Just give me a fucking address and I'll send it to you when you think about that. All right, come on bill. Type in your fucking pass without Jesus Christ. So rumor has it, the Kevin Durant is going to go to the fucking Golden State Warriors.

Speaker 4:          00:17:17       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:17:18       And as a sports fan, I cannot think of a more boring fucking move. You know what I mean?

Speaker 4:          00:17:24       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:17:24       I fucking hate how ESPN and all these sports places, they just don't call him out on it. Like how bad that is for sports fans.

Speaker 4:          00:17:35       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:17:36       I wanted to see if Oklahoma City, now he hasn't done it yet, but you know, sources say rumors and all that shit. I wanted to see if you know, what the fuck can Oklahoma City get by golden state next year. Good. Golden state redeemed themselves and when a fucking championship, you know it was such a great series, exciting series. Oklahoma had a beat, they had their foot on the neck and then fucking golden state comes roaring back. And this is like, this is great. I want to see this again next year. Like when the 76 has tried to get past the Celtics, Dr Jay didn't just sign with the Celtics.

Speaker 1:          00:18:16       Granted they got Moses Malone. I guess it's been going on for awhile. I just don't fucking get it. Still fucking get it. It's like, all right, these, this is a great rivalry. They're evenly matched. It went seven games. Hey, let's take the best player or one of the best players, depending on if you like Westbrook prayer and we'll just stick them on the other fucking team. And now that rivalry is null and void. Now it goes from wow seven game, great series to fucking, you know, four or five game series. Who gives a shit? I don't fucking get it. It's fucking Jerry West going, you know, if he, if you sign here, you're, you're rebounding is going to be modus more. Your blurb of blood can be a chair. You don't give a fuck. You don't give a fuck if it's all the best players in the league are all on one fucking team. It's, it's the worst fucking thing ever. You know, this is coming from a Celtic fan. And I watched us do that. What that Kevin, Kevin Durant, Kevin Durant, Kevin Garnett team. You know, they, we just bought that we went from literally last place to winning the championship and one fucking year. And I realized that there's a skill to it, but as a crabby old fucking curmudgeon, um, I, I just don't, I just, what is exciting about that? If he go, if he signs with the Golden State Warriors, well that's great. Why don't you have Lebron jump on that one to remember those great Miami Heat teams. Remember how exciting that was if you lived in Miami? Everybody else. So it was a fucking snooze fest.

Speaker 1:          00:19:50       They'll sit on a fucking yacht. Hey, y'all want to be on the same team will win three in a row and we'll, we'll be like, we'll be a dynasty. Like the fucking the bulls. We'd be like them. Yeah. Except they didn't pile on. Oh, I'm in a mode. I hope that moved doesn't happen. You know, it's going to happen. I just, uh, you know, whatever, it's his fucking career. But just saying as a sports fan, as a guy who fucking watches sports but doesn't really pick up on anything and then runs his fucking mouth than a podcast, I am not in favor of that fucking move. That would suck, you know? Yeah. It just, what, what, what are you gonna do? Well, that's what they, that's what these kids do nowadays. I mean, we're actually, it's been going on for 30 fucking years. Biggest, um, I guess free agent signing or trade or whatever of my life of my life was a Wayne Gretzky.

Speaker 4:          00:20:45       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:20:46       Go into the kinks. If ever there wasn't an unmovable guy, like there's no fucking way this franchises ever getting rid of this player unless we just completely, I dunno, went out of business folded and had to move. Or if our, uh, I don't know, our owner's son fucking, uh, finance, the Michael Jackson victory tour, you know, so now daddy has to sign, sell the fucking team because Michael Jackson stage was so big at, ate up all these fucking seats that they were losing money every night. And then racist Massachusetts said that they couldn't do the show out in Foxborough, you know, cause they didn't want a bunch of black people coming out to Foxborough mass going, hey, for fucking three hours. Evidently that was going to be a problem. I could see then making the fucking move. All right. Do you know that I promoted, told me that that's how I always used to think that when Billy Sullivan, the original owner of the Patriots, his son Patrick, somehow was the promoter for the Michael Jackson victory tour.

Speaker 1:          00:21:51       And I remember, um, at the last second, you know, it was supposed to be at Sullivan Stadium, which is what's a Patriot's old stadium. And um, at the last second Foxborough was just like, yeah, no, you're not having that concert out here. And it was just because it was gonna be a bunch of black people out there. Right. And, uh, but Michael Jackson had in his contract that, you know, once you sign it, whether the show happens and not, you gotta pay me. And I used to think that that one show fucked him over. But this promoter in Boston told me, no, he had this giant ass fucking stage and the Sullivan's didn't take into account. This is all alleged here of the amount of seats that that was going to take up in the arena, you know, and uh, and they didn't realize that when they were making the deal, they were calculating a certain number of seats versus what they would play in the Jacksons and it all worked out.

Speaker 1:          00:22:43       And then when they saw the behemoth of a fucking stage, they will let go. My God. So they go to Michael, they're like, Michael, he was like, yes. They were like, can you make your stage a little smaller? We're going to lose our shirts here. And Michael Jackson was like, no, I, if, if I have it smaller, prince is going to outdo me. Like he had like, you know, that rivalry with Tim going on. I don't know if that's fucking true. Somebody told me this story and then I just repeated it as fact. I mean this, this is what I do on the podcast. I'm just running my up here. Uh, did anybody watch, did you watch the Austrian Grand Prix? If that didn't make you a fucking formula one racing fan? Holy Shit. That was like fucking days of actually tweeted that yesterday, dude. It's like, okay, this is the deal.

Speaker 1:          00:23:35       The German team, the Mercedes Benz, right? They got Nico Rosberg and Lewis Hamilton. All right. Nico Rosberg is a German, right? Lewis Hamilton is, uh, he's from England, right? And uh, evidently from the isle of Man, from what people were texting tweeting me the other day. So Nico is ahead. He's, he's beaten everybody in the points in the standings. And Louis is like the fucking upstart guy, I guess. I Dunno. Right? He wears the big fucking diamond chain, you know what I mean? He's from, he's from England. I don't know what is, is, is racist. I don't know if he's mixed. I don't know what his deal is. And he's got the bling going on and all this shit. So all the old fucking, um, traditional fans of the sport, traditional wink, wink. I like the Old School Formula One, wink, wink. Right. You know what that fucking means? They don't like this guy.

Speaker 1:          00:24:33       Evidently they don't like is blamed. They don't like his, you know his whole item. Boise, I dunno, I don't want to fucking throw the ugliness in there, but it seems like there's a little issue there. Right. So anyways, earlier this year I guess to the Spanish Grand Prix, I didn't see that one. They both fucking, they banged into each other. Nico was coming around the corner and he's pushing buttons on that playstation steering wheel, whatever the fuck that thing is. You just, you just have a fucking stairwell. Then it was a steering wheel with the paddles. Now it looks like a little game boy and they're pushing shit to fucking conserve energy and I don't, I don't know what the fuck it is. But they somehow do this going like 180 miles an hour, which is amazing to me. Hundred 20 miles an hour and a fucking turn as if did dealing with the g forces of slowing down and taking a turn.

Speaker 1:          00:25:20       Well over a hundred miles an hour. This sitting there on a fucking pushing buttons, you know, like texting while driving fucking doing this shit. So earlier in the year they had one, uh, you know, Hamilton tried to pass him on the inside and then Nico was defending his position or whatever the fuck he said. He came over, he put Lewis on the fucking grass, he spun out, he clipped the back end Nico's car, they slammed into each other and uh, they both got the old, the old right there, Fred the DNC, right. Did not complete the race, which caused a Mercedes a bunch of fucking points. So evidently they probably sat them down and was like, Hey, fuck heads, you're on the same team here. What? Say you don't knock each other out of the race. So whatever. They got this whole rivalry going and it seems like Nico thinks he's the fucking guy.

Speaker 1:          00:26:10       And Louis is this like, well, I know, you know, I respect that you're the guy, but I'm trying to be the guy too, so go fuck yourself. So yesterday they're fucking racing and uh, uh, you know, I don't know much about the sport, but evidently there's soft tires and if the soft tires aren't soft enough, they got super soft tires. And I guess the softer your tires are depending on the weather condition, the faster your car goes. So whatever fucking reason they give Nico the super soft ones and they give Lewis just to soft ones so they're fucking them over with each lap. All right. So Nico's obviously the golden child that the corporate guys like and Louis is the fucking upstart, right? He's the Tom Cruise. Okay. The other guys to fucking established Kahn who's winning. Right. I'm just guessing all of this shit. So, um, I dunno it, something about the pitstop Lewis was slower than Nico's. They gave all the fucking, its advantage to Nico Cause Nico's went in the points. I think that they want him to win the fucking race cause they want to win the championship and Louis wasn't fucking having it. So he's driving like a fucking maniac on soft tires when Nico's got this super soft and next thing you know he's right on his fucking ass. It's the last lap of the fucking race

Speaker 1:          00:27:25       and Louis goes to pass him on the outside of the turn, taking the long way around. He's on, he's fucking ties or on the white line, he can't get over any father if he's going to pass. If you see he's going to overtake them on the final lap, the fucking announcers are going nuts. It fucking, Nico just drove right into him. He said he had a breaking problem. It's like, Oh yeah, did you have a staring problem to you? Fucking drove right into him and it's like, oh my God, they're going to knock each other out of the race again. And they get out of it and then they came back together and then fucking I, I think the back of Hamilton's car clipped the front of a Rosberg's and took us little fin fin things off the front. So now he can't drive fast and when your car's damaged like that and you'll blow and debris all over the track.

Speaker 1:          00:28:09       I didn't realize this. Evidently you're supposed to pull over. He supposed to hit the old rest area. Just be like, well, I guess we're going to call it a day because all that shit that you're putting in the track and blow out somebody's tire caused him to crash. They could get injured and they're not going to fucking finish. And it's not their fault that you fucking drove into your teammate. But this con keeps driving his car, shrapnel all over the track. And he finished, he got penalized. Long story short was Lewis Hamilton and then went in the fucking race and uh, they were cutting to the, uh, whatever the owners of the Mercedes team and they're all fucking pissed. And uh, one of the guys on the Mercedes teams is the guy that, you know, went for that movie rush. I should really have the guy's name here. I'm new to this sport, so forgive me for not knowing his name. The Guy who had that horrific crash on the Ferrari team in 1976 and he had the fire, they showed it in a, that movie rush. She was absolutely terrifying. And what's more terrifying, they'd being alive on fire, you know?

Speaker 4:          00:29:09       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:29:10       What would you rather be alive on fire or in the ocean watching a great white shark approaching. Yeah. No, no one. It's going to fucking take you leg off. I mean, I actually think you got to go with the shark. Just fucking bite my leg off. Does a major artery right there. I'm going to fucking be like, ha. And then the dopamine is going to come out and I'm having that goofy smile on my face is the hammer head comes into, finish me off. Right? So anyways, they would to me afterwards, Nico said that he had a break in problem. I don't know. I don't fucking know. So now there's all these conspiracy theorists out there going like, well, you know, it's the German team. Nico's a German. All right,

Speaker 1:          00:29:54       fucking Hamilton's, uh, you know, from England and he doesn't look like you're fucking English guy being made. And he's not a white dude. Maybe there's some racism going on there. I don't know, but I just became a hit Lewis Hamilton fan. I still like Ross spark, you know he's racing, he's out there, you know, you can't fucking handle it. He's one of those, he seems like one of those guys you ever to go out and you play like pickup who per pick up hockey and it's just some fucking nice guy and all of a sudden the game starts and they get that fucking look in their face. Like they'll blow out a knee just to score a goal. You know those lunatics, you just sitting there going like, all right, I'm going to fucking steer clear slash try to annoy the shit out of this person.

Speaker 1:          00:30:41       Going to try to make sure this guy doesn't fall on my fucking leg. You know, I had a buddy of mine, right? Fucking nicest guy ever. He's a psychiatrist. He works with troubled inner city youth who just gone through all kinds of fucking horrific shit. He has the patience to sit there, you know, and work with these kids that are acting out because of all this horrible stuff that's happened to them in their home life and he sits there and he handles it and he loves it. You fucking get that guy out on the ice. He's a fucking lunatic. One time I took the, we mean the other guy, we'd fucking taking the puck away from him and he, I heard his breathing change and he just fucking brought his stick up and I'm telling you about, this is why I wear the full birdcage, right dude, 45 degree angle across my whole face.

Speaker 1:          00:31:30       It just Bam. It hit my fucking cage and I looked at it. I was just like, dude, what the fuck up for whatever dumb reason, I was one of those people, you know that comes out, please pick up hockey only wearing a visor. Those guys alluded six, especially when, because there's always the person out there that can't skate, which is usually me, and you start doing that run in place. I'm going to fall forward. I'm going to fall back. I'm going to fall forward. And you've got like the stick in your hand that's coming up and taking somebody's teeth out. So, um, oh my God, what a lunar, I mean, I literally would have needed like fucking plastic surgery that was kicking off fucking face like mine. You just ride it out. Oh, there's this name right there. I got it right there and I'm sorry. Uh, Nikki, I'm going to say it wrong. Lau Da. I don't know how to say Lotta I sweat. So he was, they talked to him and I'm looking at this guy looking like the old race and guy like one of his ears. It's like, you know, mostly burned off and shit. He's got the scars on the side of his face. I gotta be honest with you. He looked pretty fucking bad ass, you know what I mean?

Governor Gary Johnson. Hey Billy Shatner. Billy fucking shit. I'm not a libertarian. I never said you were. I had never been affiliated with any party. I voted both parties and for elections I voted in. I've been eligible for six. You sound like a blogger. When you're going to criticize a comedian going like, I have a great sense of humor.

Speaker 1:          00:38:15       You know, I find this funny, I've, I love this and blah, blah, blah. But when I saw last night in a comedy club, all right, so this guy has established himself that he's open minded. All right? Because he says, so I'm not into the fringe candidates and I don't buy into conspiracies. I guess what I'm saying is I'm not the typical Gary Johnson Fan. Now what? Because you say so. I guess what I'm saying is, well, why don't you figure out what the fuck you saying so you don't have to write x to words in a sentence. Giving me more opportunity to trip myself up, please. All right. However, I am a fan of his, and I think he could actually win if he got on the, on the debates. He's basically Bernie who I supported for the most part. They just, but I'm not a libertarian. Well, he was a Democrat, right? Well, he was, and then he became a libertarian, then became a democrat. Is that how it worked? I don't know. I love Bernie Sanders.

Speaker 5:          00:39:11       Whoa.

Speaker 1:          00:39:47       You Dude, you just gave me homework. All right, let's put this fucking thing in here and we're going to try and watch it. Oh Shit. I'm running for Paris in it. I'm running. I'm running with them. Jazzy music. As the governor of New Mexico, I vetoed wasteful spending 750 times, cut taxes 14 times and left the snow. Why is he so breathy and $1 billion surplus without raising taxes? Massachusetts. How would I know that? You just said that you did it. Now how do I fuck? Can't fact check all of that? I don't know. I mean, it's exciting. We're going to move the country forward. Music, but a deep [inaudible]. Hi. Hi. I'm Jerry Johnson. Um, I'm sure he's a great guy. I'll look into it. I mean, I like that you're giving me other options because there's no fucking way I can vote for Trump or for Hillary, you know? Oh, we all know the old bag's going to win it.

I swear to God,

Speaker 1:          00:41:10       if Trump wasn't such a fucking dope, if he wasn't such a dope, I actually think he would be the lesser of two evils. But I have to be honest with you, there's no way to listen to Donald Trump and not think about Martin Sheen in the dead zone.

Speaker 1:          00:41:31       Can Somebody please Photoshop Trump holding up the baby, you know, and fucking what's his face? Um, Oh, Jesus Christ went walking up in the balcony there or the dead fucking earth. The birds are away, gentlemen. Um, I have no idea, sir.

Speaker 1:          00:46:03       a deer, big belly that Billy, I'm a 17 year old guy who will be starting college in the fall in the great state of Massachusetts. Um, Jesus starting at seven, you must be turning 18 later on in the year. Um, I'm always jealous of that. I started, I started college when I was 19. I was already 19 and then I fucked up my first four years and I was like a 23 year old sophomore, uh, my high schools.

Speaker 4:          00:46:30       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:46:30       A dress code allows guys to grow facial hair and the last semester of senior year, what, what foot fucking school you going to? So a few months ago I said, what the hell? I'll give it a try.

Speaker 4:          00:46:47       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:46:47       But you're only 17.

Speaker 1:          00:46:51       The last semester of your senior year, you're getting giving yourself a hell of a lot of time to grow. This shit said, I ended up growing up growing a nice dark full beard that seems to suit me well. I got a lot of compliments for it. Mostly from other guys, but some from the ladies. I remain single as I have always been during this time. I still have the beard now, but I don't know whether I should keep the beard or ditch it and arrive at college. Clean Shaven. Do you think it's a good or bad idea to make my first impression while sporting a beer in terms of the ladies, is the beard assign of manliness and strength or more of a turnoff? I don't fucking, I got to ask Nia. Hang on a second. Jesus Christ. How that, why the fuck would I know? You know, I always thought Dan Fouts was sexy. Hang on.

Speaker 1:          00:47:40       All right. You happy she was sleeping? I just, I didn't know if she was sleeping. I was fucking, I've never happened there. All right, well there you go. So you fucked the whole thing up and cleaned up and then I woke her up. Um, anyway, I do it. I don't fucking know. But you're saying that you're not, you're not allowed to have facial hairs at this fucking school. You Go. Was that like a type Typo or something? My, all, my high school's not college. My high school's dress code allows guys to grow facial hair in the last semester of senior year. Oh, okay. I thought it was a scene at college. Um, we'll look to when I was a kid, the only reason to grow a beard was so you could buy booze or get served when you were still under rage. You know, whether women like it or not, I have no fucking idea. Um,

Speaker 4:          00:48:28       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:48:29       I don't, I don't know.

Speaker 4:          00:48:31       Yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:48:31       go there fucking clean shaven and then, uh, you know, get a little scruff going. Assumption. I don't know this, this is like a cosmo question. I have no fucking, do they, is it a sign of manliness? I have no idea. I mean, if you grow it too quickly, it might be a sign of a hairy back and that might take you out of the game. Some women might be like, Oh, my dad had a beard in the subconsciously that gets into them, you know? Oh yeah. That reminds me of feeling safe with my dad. And next thing you know, they're blowing. Yeah. Then they're like, what the fuck? That just what happened? Right. I don't know. Let's move on to the next question. That was a hard one. I had no fucking idea. All right. Cheating Bitch, girlfriend out g is there. Hey you red face. Fuck. I Dunno why I find that shit's so endearing. Um, showed you what the fuck's wrong with me. All right. About a month ago I started dating this lady. She seemed really quiet in pretty innocent. After about a week I realized, I just pictured that woman in that Vince Vaughn movie, the a wedding crashers. Um, whoever that actress was fucking hilarious and that will be. Anyways, after about a week I realized that her last boyfriend was a total freak,

Speaker 1:          00:49:52       like Jean shorts and shit.

Speaker 1:          00:49:55       Fuck you mean freak like a Weirdo. What was fucking, you know, having threesomes with this chick anyways, like Jean shorts and shit. Fuck. So I did my best to just ignore that and have fun together. I was, in my opinion, a great boyfriend to her. I took her on a lot of dates and it seemed like everything was perfect. And this was my first girlfriend. I'm only 16 and pretty introverted. So having a girlfriend was a big step for me. Yeah, that's huge. Good fuel, man. Anyways, after a few weeks, she started acting weird. One day at lunch, she told me that her old weird boyfriend and her had sex before school that day and they also had sex a couple of other times while we were going out. I didn't know what to say and it really fucked me up. She even said it wasn't her fault and I shouldn't be mad. Oh, you know what? I was actually going to give this girl props for being mature enough to own up to what the fuck she did. And then she said that don't be mad at me. Um, after a fight, I told her to fuck.

Speaker 1:          00:51:00       I told her to fuck and left. I think fuck off. That's what you meant, because she's already fucking, dude. You don't need to tell her. You should have told him to to less fuck two x ne on the [inaudible]. Um, she then started saying that it was my fault. I don't know what I did wrong. Oh, you poor bastard and you're only 16 years old, right? So you didn't, you didn't have your deflector shields up.

Speaker 1:          00:51:24       Is that what it is? Did you say you were 16 right? The fuck was that? I'm only 16. Okay. So now everyone knows that school because high school is bullshit. Um, I know I, I'm now known by everyone, including my family as the guy who got cheated on this pitch. Not only made me feel like shit, but also kind of ruined the whole aspect of finding a nice girl. I don't trust them and feel as if I will never move on. Yeah. These are the catastrophic thoughts you have when you're 60, uh, because your world is small. You still living at home with your parents. You go to school, you see the same fucking cunts every day, and you feel like the walls are closing in. All of these feelings are 100% normal. Um, how do you, how do you move on after being fucked over like that?

Speaker 1:          00:52:10       The only things I've done is got a job and started lifting weights. Maybe then when school starts again, I can show up shredded and do better next year. There you go. I like it. Turn a negative into a positive. Um, here's the thing. You're a nice guy, right? You're a nice guy. Uh, well, you know, so that means there's the Nice woman out there that balances you out, right? If you're a dick, there's plenty of clients out there, but you're a nice guy. So what I would do is, uh, I would thank my lucky stars that that fucking woman is out of your life. You know, she's totally fucked up. All right. She's going to go back to the Jean Short guy and they're going to fuck before school and they're going to do all of this other shit. And, um, who gives a fuck? I don't understand how, like, I don't know how, there's no reason for you just me listening to this, why you should feel bad about yourself. I get, you know, I got cheated on, you know, it's happened to everybody and uh, it makes you just more feel stupid is what it is. You know what I mean? So

Speaker 1:          00:53:27       I'm trying to count the amount of times that's happening to me. The first girl I was with was like fucking way older than me. I went from like zero to 90 miles an hour in fucking, yeah. She ended up cheating on me and breaking up a fucking marriage. And, uh, I did, I, oh, I remember how I didn't even know. I ended up running into the wife of the guy that she cheated with and then they were broken up and she told me, and I just, my judgment, my thought was I just went like, Huh. You know? And there was a lot in that

Speaker 1:          00:54:13       because it just let me know that, uh, you know, I just thought guys did shit like that, you know, I thought we would just the fucking animals. And it was just like, wow. So she was doing that and then come home and smile. Yeah. And that fucked me up for a long fucking time. Yeah. You know what an I didn't trust women, you know, and I started lifting weights. Did I write this thing 20 years ago? What the fuck now? Um, yeah dude, this is the deal. You know, it's going to take time to get over it, but you know you're going to meet somebody nice. And I think, yeah, you're in the prime of your life. You throw the weights around a little bit, you show up fucking shredded, right?

Speaker 4:          00:54:49       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:54:49       And then you show you, I show up in September and just start chatting up the women. And this is the thing too. Women love a fucking, they love a project, you know, so you can use the fact that this woman cheated on you, that Oh, you know, I have problems, trust and fucking women and now they'll just, they'll, they'll be coming at Ya. He beat them off with a fucking stick. All right. Yeah Dude. Fuck that. This is the thing. You don't have a letter. Anytime anything bad happens in life, you don't have it. You don't let it, you know, there's two things you can do. You can either just fucking,

Speaker 1:          00:55:23       I don't know. I, I, I view like that those types of thoughts. Like, you know, when you watch like bugs bunny and they would have like that, wait, that just said one ton on it. I view like that. That's what that thought is. All right. And you're standing next to a fucking pool. All right? And the thing's got a chain around it and either just fucking let it go to the bottom of the pool itself. Or you stick your head in the chain and wrap it around your neck and you let it take it down. And then you just down there in the bottom of the pool. You know, why would you do that? Fuck it. Fuck you. Fuck her. Just let that whole thing, I'm not saying don't deal with it, but you got to turn it into a positive, which is what you seem to be doing fucking workout and chat up a bunch of women. This is think maybe, uh, you know,

Speaker 1:          00:56:13       start your list of fucking requirements. You test, you lock the door test to maybe to try to get a good one. Uh, you know, women always say, find a good finding a good, a good man's hard to find. Soza good woman. So what this woman did is a help you start early on a checklist, because I didn't start a checklist for a long fucking time, you know, I was well into my thirties and I was still just like, hey, you want to fuck every thought, every thing you do, everything on my list is checked off, you know? All right, here we go. All time underrated quarterbacks. You'll be fine. You'll be fine. Shake it off. It's fucking your fault. That's Atlanta. That poor woman, she's got a lot of issues and a bit, she's has a terrible father, you know? So in a way you can look at it like that because you know, she is young and immature, but if she continues to live her life that way, that is, that is a bad fucking road to go on.

Speaker 1:          00:57:07       You know, that's fucking white symphony. Dale's of the red wine, gray teeth with the fucking and tramp stamp. She's going to go down that one and the piece of shit, guys, she's going to meet Jean shorts will be the least of our problems. I hope that doesn't happen to her either. But, uh, anyways, here we go. All time underrated. Qbs dear Billy White shoes. Very nice reference. Billy White shoes, Johns of the Houston Oilers and the Atlanta Falcons. Alright, bye friends. Tear me apart from being a huge Vinny Testaverde fan. I truly love the man and feely flies under the radar as an all time quarterback. Maybe not hall of fame caliber, but someone who could have won a super bowl if he didn't have to face Elway. Tarell Davis in the 1998 Denver Bronco Machine. Well, you realize what you're saying, that he could have been a championship if he didn't have to play the best team in the league.

Speaker 1:          00:58:06       Well, I mean, yeah, well shit. San Diego Padres could be a fucking dynasty if it wasn't for all the other fee. The fucking 1998 Yankees or the late nineties Yankees. Right? I don't know. Anyways, he played 22 seasons and in his final season with season with the Carolina Panthers, he won his first game after only being on the team for three fucking days at the age of 43. He was definitely a bad ass. Nobody could be in that backyard playing horseshoes with this son and then out of football in two days later be under under center and fucking winning a game. Like he did that like I think three times in his career. He was sort of like a, maybe it just happened once. I Dunno, but I just feel like he was officially retired at least once, if not twice. And he was in the back yard eating a fucking Burger, having a course light and all of a sudden, Hey Bernie, this is the fucking whatever Seattle Seahawks calling or Tampa. But where did he play Tampa. The jets. Carolina. That's a great one. Cleveland. And he played with Cleveland. It was at Bernie Coza again, I get confused my older age. Let's look up. Oh Vinny Testaverde Vinay. Then he had the fucking veal. All right, you guys want to hear a great, uh,

Speaker 1:          00:59:22       you guys wanna hear a great fucking La Story. I went out to an Italian restaurant the other day, right? And we sitting up front near the bar and it was too loud and one of the guys I was eating with us, cause this is too fucking loud, let's try to get a table in the back. So they end up hooking us up with a table in the back and as I'm going to walk, you know to the back,

Speaker 1:          00:59:42       one of the guys there up to bar, he goes, yeah, go in the back. You know, you can barely hear yourself thinking just the way he said it. I can't remember what he said. He said something along those lines. Super Italian guy and the way he said it and the fact that I was moving as I went past him, I felt like I was in that tracking scene in Goodfellas when they were showing all those characters, you know, get the papers, get the papers, a guy, it guy took care of that thing, right? Literally it gave me like a shock the way he said it. So I said to one of the guys that we were, I was having dinner with. I said, Hey Michael, Jesus Christ. Go. That guy just made me feel like I was in Goodfellas. Classic La Story and why it's so amazing to live out here. He goes, do you know who that is? And I said, no. He goes, that's the guy who played Johnny roast beef

Speaker 1:          01:00:27       and then I fucking looked at him again. I was like, oh my God, it's Johnny Roast beef. One of the greatest pieces fucking acting I've ever seen is when he's trying to explain a way that pink Cadillac and he starts to stop and then then he starts to talk and then he stops and actually had, I talked to him about it for a second and he just laughed. He said, one said, basically said, when a man is scary as Jimmy, the gent is yelling at you. He goes, you don't say a fucking word. Remember that? No, it, it's, it's in my grandmother's name. What's the matter with me? It's a matter of me. You're going to get us all fucking pinch. That's why some matter with you, what's the matter with you? Take it back, take it back at the fuck that look on his fucking face and he goes to, he just keeps going. I'm sorry. I,

Speaker 4:          01:01:14       yeah,

Speaker 1:          01:01:16       I'm sorry. What did I tell you? What the fuck? What did I tell? I fucking love that seat. So anyways, um, Vinny Testaverde, here we go. Be any folk in test of early Ovi. Um, here we go. Vinny Testaverde. Let's see. It was him with the panthers. He's 52 years old. I swear to God. I bet he's still in shape. And if you fucking, if you, you know, if you call them up right now, if you called them up right now, he could give you a decent audit. What the fuck? 87 to 92 we played for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. 93 to 95 he played for the Cleveland browns 96 97, the Baltimore Ravens 98 to 2003, the New York jets, which is how I remember him as a jet. 2000 for the Dallas cowboys. 2005, he goes back to the jets. 2006, he played for my patriots. I don't even remember that. 2007 he played for the panthers.

Speaker 1:          01:02:27       20 year fucking career. 21 seasons. Wow. Two time pro bowler. 96 98 Heisman trophy, 86, uh, Davy O'Brien bump up a buzz Sammy Bar, trophy sportsman of the year, 86 let's see, tds verse, interceptions. This is what fucked him over the 275 touchdowns, 267 interceptions. Wasn't somebody wrapped like that in incomplete, like Testaverde. Uh, but he didn't say intercepted, but he threw for 46,233 yards back in the day, you know, for the most part when you actually, they could cover receivers before Jim say changed all the fucking rules cause he couldn't beat the Patriots, but that's okay. I know the ball was underinflated let's kick them out of football. Passing rating. Passive Passer Rating, 75.0 all right. Well yeah. Okay. Those are great. Fuck. You know, do you play 20 seasons? But he did throw a lot of pics. So anyways, um, where he's the oldest quarterback to ever start. And when a pro football game older than George Blanda.

Speaker 1:          01:03:38       Well, I thought George Blend, maybe he was just kicking at that point. Everybody always reverts back to the days, his days in Tampa and Cleveland. But I'd argue that those Tampa years where some of the worst pro squads ever to try it on a football onto a football field. Yeah, absolutely. You can't blame somebody for that. You know, it's like Joey Harrington, he goes and he fucking plays for uh, the lions, you know, odd. Right out of the gate. There's no way as bad. He's as bad as he looked. Those lion teams were fucking horrible. I'm not saying that the guy would have played in the league or whatever, but you know, for the longest time if you got drafted by the lions or the browns as, as a quarterback, that was a fucking death sentence, which is another brilliant move that John Elway made. Cause when he got drafted by the Baltimore Colts, he's like, I'm not fucking going there, getting the shit kicked out of me and I'll be out of football. I mean that almost happened to Troy Aikman.

Speaker 4:          01:04:32       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:04:33       Troy Aikman when he got drafted by the fucking cowboys. So got the living shit kicked out of him his first few years. If that continued, I mean, that guy, he would have been out of football. But fortunately the Herschel Walker trade went down with Jimmy Johnson App boys. Right. They got that fucking, uh, all those 300 pounders in front of them. I Dunno. Anyways, let's plow ahead here. Uh, he said as a patriots fan, I'd like your thoughts on him. Are My friends right? Saying he was just an average quarterback at best? No fucking way. No way though. He was, he was w uh, well you don't play for 20 fucking years. Okay. He was, he was above way above average, I think. I think he was a, he's not a, I wouldn't say he's one of the greats, but he was definitely a, uh, he was a really good quarterback. You know, he wasn't like, um,

Speaker 1:          01:05:32       what does he, if he was, if he was an average Qb at best, you don't play for 20 years, be an average unless you Steve to Berg and just some out. You just look so great with a headset and a clipboard. People just wanted you around. He was like the David Hasselhoff, you know, a fucking quarterbacks. It just, I think you sold more tickets because he never had his helmet on. The ladies could come down and look at them. Look up Steve to Berg here. Steve to Berg. All right. Oh yeah, the David Hasselhoff. He looks like he's looked like, you know, whenever they had those coming of age movies and you got the nerd who wants to date the fucking cheerleader, but she's dating the guy who was just a complete fucking Dick. Uh, he had those, those level good looks, dude. I'm telling you right now. Look this guy up. That's fucking hilarious. He looks like he saw Baywatch played number 17 on. Now we got this, this, you know what? This is actually morphed into the degraded NFLs greatest journeyman. I'm going to look this up.

Speaker 4:          01:06:38       Okay,

Speaker 1:          01:06:39       great. Is God, I love the Internet. I love that somebody made a page about this shit. Best Nfl journeymen, the seven most unkillable journeyman quarterbacks. I love the Internet because of shit like this and all the fucking free porn. All right, here we go. Um, there's a good chance that at one time or another, your team's hopes were riding on Ryan Fitzpatrick, Brian Hoyer, or one of the NFLs other well traveled signal call is, Oh, don't be all just new guys. Come on. All right. Ryan Fitzpatrick, Brian Fitzpatrick, a played for the Texans, the titans, the rams, the bangles, the jets, and the bills. All right. Josh mccown. Uh, I've, uh, Brian Hoyer. Matt Cassel.

Speaker 4:          01:07:34       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:07:34       A castle. Matt Flynn, the perennial backups. I'll come on, man. Tim Tebow. Now this, this was done by some youngster. You got to have Steve to Bergen. Then you've got Vinny Testaverde journeymen NFL players who just won't go away. Do I have to type in all time? Is that what I have to do? I think I got to type in all time. Come on, man. You've got to, if, if the, if Steve, the burst not on your fucking list.

Speaker 4:          01:08:08       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:08:09       These not on your fucking list. Journeymen quarterback. All right, we'll just go Wikipedia. Oh, this is depressing. I thought it was gonna be great. Jt O'sullivan played for 12 professional teams during his career. You know what? I bet in his man cave, he should, they, the NFL should give them all 12 of those helmets. All 12 of those fucking helmets. Why am I all wrapped up in the fucking court here? What's going on? All right, here we go. This is what happens when you fucking lay down on a couch and there's why is, um, JT O'sullivan, he played on no less than 11 to NFL teams. Oh, professionals. Okay. So, and then he also played for the Saskatchewan rough riders and the Frankfurt Galaxy. Chris Chandler holds the record for starting a game for the highest number of different NFL teams with eight. Oh, so he started, okay. There's no accepted definition or threshold at which a person is regarded as a journeyman quarterback. Um, the term is descriptive rather than definitive. David Craig enjoyed 11 s stable careers with the Seahawks before leaving. Let's see, Mark Rypien notable examples. Here we go. Here we go. Trent Dilfer, Brad Johnson, rich Gannon. Where the fuck is Steve debarge

Speaker 1:          01:09:35       notable journeymen quarterbacks? Come on, come on. All right. You know, I'm trying to look up Steve debarge. I'm sorry guys. This whole podcast just you just listened to me surf the fucking Internet now to people still say surf the internet or was that from the 90 [inaudible] I'm old already. He's 62 years old. He played for the San Francisco 40 niners from 1977 to 1980 the Broncos from 81 to 83 the Buccaneers from 84 to 87 the chiefs from 88 to 91 back to the Buccaneers. 92 93 the Miami Dolphins, 1993 he was out of fucking football in 94 he was out of football in 95 out of football, 96 out of football, 97 and then what the fuck? 1998 he's back. What? The dirty birds, the Atlanta Falcons who upset the 15 and one Minnesota Vikings. Right. And then went to the fucking super bowl, one of the most forgettable super bowls of all fucking time. And the Denver Broncos repeated or that was the last fucking game of John Elway's career. All right. TDS, two interceptions. He had a 196 touchdowns versus 204 interceptions. He threw for 34,000, 241 yards. And as a higher QB rating, did Vinny Testaverde it's 74.2, right? Or was he 75? I don't fucking remember. Steven Lee. Roy De Berg. There you go. That's, that's my, um,

Speaker 4:          01:11:16       yeah,

Speaker 1:          01:11:17       that's my vote. You know, it's funny like I bet he doesn't have a lot of problems walking or anything like that cause he's got, so he has a low miles on that odometer as far as like actually playing in the phone. I'm not trying to insult the guy here. I'm just saying like if he was a car, you know, it'd be like those all original miles. It'd be a, yeah. Yeah. He sat in a garage with a fucking clipboard for all those years. All right. That's the podcast for this, uh, this 4th of July. I hope you guys all have a happy and a safe one. All right. You fucking drunks. I know it's a fireworks and it's supposed to be fun, but yet all day our explosives don't be that person. And one of those youtube fucking videos of like top 10 stupidest fucking moose done with fireworks. Did you see that fucking guy? He actually took like a mortar or some shit, put it on his head. I don't know if he thought it was going to take off. He literally blew himself up. His friends go. You don't understand. There was nothing left of him. It was nothing left to help.

Speaker 1:          01:12:22       You know? They just showed up and there was, there was like a belt buckle and like a shoelace. He was gone. So please don't do that to yourself. All right. All right, clay out. Um, all right, that's the podcast. You guys have a great week. I will check in with dia. Go fuck yourselves. I'll check in on you on Thursday. All right.
