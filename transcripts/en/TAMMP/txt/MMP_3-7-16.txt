Speaker 1:          00:00:01       Hey, what's going on is bill burn? It's time for the Monday morning podcast for Monday, March 7th, 2006 stay. What's going on? How are you? How's your weekend? Do you listen to the weekend? I can't feel my face when I with you.

Speaker 2:          00:00:18       Boom.

Speaker 1:          00:00:20       Oh, what are you doing man? You're fucking some chicken blow. You didn't do blow when you were with her now. Now you're with her. Now you're doing blow the boy. I can't believe that shit came back. You know, I thought coke was just done. You know, after all the people did what they did from my generation, you would think that the next generations would be like, you know what? Yeah, I'm going to stay away from that shit.

Speaker 2:          00:00:49       Right.

Speaker 1:          00:00:50       It's not our works. One generation does it. Like my generation, we were like, wow man, let's stay away from hey man, like let's stay away from LSD and heroin. Cause that's like a bad trip man. And then we fucked with like coke and crack crank, all of that Shit, right? That ruined dollar about fucking lives. And then the next generation was just like, yeah, man, fuck all that stuff. Let's fuck with crystal meth. Right? So now this next way was like, fuck crystal meth. You know, let's kick it old school. Let's go back to the coke.

Speaker 2:          00:01:23       Right?

Speaker 1:          00:01:25       You have an entire generation of people that not only can't feel it faces, but I evidently they like it.

Speaker 1:          00:01:34       Oh God. What do you go from there? Sorry, I'm trying to update my, uh, my musical tastes. I've decided that after fucking 40 years of listening to the same fucking 10 bands, you know, not 40, like 30. I mean, Jesus Christ, how many fucking times can you listen to it? I always like those. You have those people are walking in the circle, the circle in the jail at midnight express. Remember that when they were walking counterclockwise and then the dude who's going to escape and you had the drugs, you know whose girlfriend put it tidies up against the glass. He started walking around the other way. Remember that? Yeah. That's what I'm doing right now. I'm walking around the other way and every, my generation is just going, what are you listening to this shit for Sec. I don't know how many times the Hay, I haven't listened to that for fucking 30 years.

Speaker 2:          00:02:26       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:02:26       I gotta get, I gotta pull my cell phone.

Speaker 2:          00:02:31       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:02:33       No, I just, yeah, I would like to listen to something new. So, uh, the lovely Nia was watching the, all the performances from the grammys last night. So I just started downloading everything that I was seeing, whether I liked it or not. I'm like, I'm just gonna listen to this shit. You know? It's kind of like when I try to put a new hour of stand up together and I'm just like, Eh, you know, if this doesn't, this isn't a good idea, but I'm gonna say it anyways cause I can't say the other shit cause that's coming out. So I just start throwing shit against the wall. So this morning I was listening to, I listened to a little bit of the weekend, Dude. Sounds just like Michael Jackson, right? I think it does. And uh, who else did I download? That girl looks like [inaudible], uh, MC search, right? The fuck's her name. I don't know if she was singing about a relationship and she was over it and she just looked like she had this high top fade, you know, but also knew what I like to make a fucking rocket.

Speaker 1:          00:03:39       She looked really smart, you know, yet like you wouldn't want to fuck with the, I don't know. She kind of had it all going on. It's like, is this a nerd? Is this a bully? Is this a wrapper or is she a witch? But the band is fucking great. And so she, I don't, you know, after all of that shit, I'm probably not going to say who the fuck it is even if I figure it out. Cause I don't want to shit on people like that. Um, anyways, he had a killer SG though. The fucking three pickups, you know, that's surfing green. They went out, they crushed it. Right. I actually saw what's his face? They're the fucking, the dude who's getting the worst tattoos ever. He's got the Lamborghini and fucking, uh, didn't like l and l Keyshawn Johnson chased him up his front door.

Speaker 1:          00:04:27       The fuck is his name, Justin Bieber. I actually watched that. That guy can sing. He's fucking talented. I just don't, you should just, just do that. Just do that. Stop filming yourself playing basketball and whatever else is doing. Mean mugging you. Fucking Gopro. Just sing your song and fucking go home. Why wouldn't you do that? It's actually a talented kid. Although I didn't like when he threw the acoustic guitar down in the end, you know, what are you fucking Pete Townsend? You're not okay. You got the inner ear fucking monitor. So you protecting your hearing. Okay. You're not, you know, uh, nobody's blowing up a drum set and part of the fucking drum set goes right into your fucking ear. Okay? Nobody's getting crushed at your fucking concerts. They've worked all of that out. You know? Sorry. See, and then I go right back to the grumpy old man. I'm just, I'm trying to give the kid a copies. Fucking really talented. He can actually really sick. Um, so anyways, and then I was listening the other dude, what the fuck's his name? Uh, I, for the life of me, I don't understand why I can't just download shit and then just find it.

Speaker 1:          00:05:36       And every fucking time it goes back to the album thing. I, I could, when they just list the songs, I don't need to see the picture of the album.

Speaker 1:          00:05:47       Every time this happens, I forget how to do it. Oh, okay. Artists' songs. They are, we go, um, oh. And speaking of which on, um, everybody was, uh, sending a bunch of each week when I do the Thursday, uh, Thursday afternoon, just before Friday, Monday morning podcast. You know, when we go into the greatest hits of the Monday morning, podcast is always a little musical interlude. I do not pick that music. That's Andrew Feminists. And then he posts on the Twitter site what the name of the music is. So last week it was snarky puppy. Okay. That's who the fuck it was the posted every week. Just fucking look it up. All right. At the Mlm podcast or some shit. I forget what the, I don't know what the Twitter account is. What am I going to fall on myself?

Speaker 1:          00:06:37       Um, anyways, plowing ahead. So Friday night, oh, freckles. I took a night off from stand up. All right. Friday, that's a big night to take a night off. That's like not showing up thanksgiving, you know, if you'd like to eat, you know. So I went down to the Wiltern theater and a with Andrew and I saw mute math and they will fucking, unbelievable cannot. I tweeted, I couldn't, I cannot overstate how great a fucking show that was. And I wish I remember the name of the opening band too. They were all so great, but we're just killed me was, I had never been to a show like that, like whatever that style of music is, I don't even know what the style of music is, but I'm just going from, you know, the Shit I've been listening to for 30 years straight. All right.

Speaker 1:          00:07:31       Wow. Can Bajas Bhavin in cars. Right. I listened to say I listened to this same 90 songs for 30 fucking years in a row. MMM. Never wanted to be that guy. So just go into those, seeing those bands, just how they use guitar, where it's more used full, like mood where, but when I was growing up, like the guitar was like the Dick that got thrown on the table, right. Just slaps you right in the face with it. There was always the lead singer, and then you had the guitar, God, and then the fucking dude playing rhythm guitar who was not appreciated until at least 25 years into that band's career. You know, like Malcolm young really didn't get his props until, until like the mid nineties I feel Brad Whitford, same fucking thing. You know, Ronnie Wood, all of these guys just playing rhythm guitar, holding the whole fucking thing together.

Speaker 1:          00:08:21       Right? And they don't get shit for the longest fucking time. Um, Jesus Christ, Butte, math live man, they're fucking unreal. So by the way, they're playing Portland, Oregon tonight. That's Monday, depending on when you listen to this Tuesday, they're in Seattle, then they're off for a week, and then they start back up again in Richmond. If a, you get a chance to see them. Um, you will not be disappointed and if you're an old fuck like me, they were a great band to go see to try to bring you into the modern era. You know, if you're listening to this, come on. You can't tell me somebody is a little bit younger than me. You haven't been listening to that fucking Pearl Jam record 10. You know, whether all giving each other the high five, the big Bro Picture. We're all in this together. All right. Um, if you can't tell me that you haven't been listened to it, how many times are you going to Dreher about her age?

Speaker 3:          00:09:15       Yay.

Speaker 1:          00:09:18       Oh, fucking 25 years later. I'm not saying don't have a listen to it again, right? Look, you can do whatever the fuck you want, but I never wanted to be that guy going [inaudible] it's him. You check. Right then going into my house. Babba dup, bup, bup, bup. Betty [inaudible] bull ride going in there and doing the fucking jitter bug. That makes said that Jeff Beck is playing the Hollywood bowl and I have to see that guy. He's like 70. He's buddy guy is opening up and there's no fucking way I'm going to miss that. Um, you know, guys, one of the greatest, he is the guy, you know, I think from that whole fucking error other than Jimi Hendrix, I thought, yeah, I think you've got to give it to Jeff back right now out of my mind. I'm sure there's some black guy out there that I'm forgetting.

Speaker 1:          00:10:06       You know, who got stolen from budgets as far as white dudes who listened to black dudes and then reshaped it. Right. I think you've got to give it to that guy. No. Well, you know, it's just my opinion. You don't got to get fucking upset by it. So anyways, what I'm obsessed with right now as far as like the drummer, Darren k, the guy's fucking insane. And it was funny cause um, you know, Andrew got to know those guys, so I got to go backstage and meet him briefly. And uh, you know, after the show they were going, hey, did you learn anything watching our drummer? And I was just like, no. And I heard that Darren goes, ahhh. Like, I didn't mean it. I hope I didn't come off in an insulting way. It's like, dude, Ikea too fucking far beyond anything that I'm doing watching him.

Speaker 1:          00:10:55       It was like watching like Keith, it was like Keith Moon playing drum and base and then they have this sick ass fucking light show going on. And I was just sitting there squinting watching, just going like, wow, what is he doing? I ain't no fucking clue. Um, I did take one video while that while they were playing, cause I, I th this coolest, you know, the iPhone is and how great the video is and everything. I just fucking hate like being, it's something and then just sitting there filming it, like I'm working for CBS nightly news or some shit. It's like I want to stand here and I want to take this in. There's enough other concierge like filming this shit. I can watch this. It'll be on the internet forever. Right. So anyways, there's this song clipping that they play and I had no idea what he was doing.

Speaker 1:          00:11:49       And Andrew's going to watch what he does here. And then he literally has like two sticks and a two drumsticks in his right hand and he's playing, this is going to be some drum geek shit. So you might want to pass through this. He's put bait as far as I can tell, he's basically playing 68th note, triplets, Dah, Dah, Dah, Dah, Dah. Two to two, two to the three to four, right. But he's only, he's playing like he's doing it with two sticks in one hand. So the one on top sit in the top of the high hat. The one underneath is hitting the bottom of the high end. So up top. What? He's really just, he's playing like every other note of the tripled. Like dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot. That uh, but he gets to, as he's bringing that stick up, the one underneath hits it. So that's how he gets the full 16th note. Right? Sorry. I know this is really nerdy shit. And then with his left hand, he's basically ghosting the offbeat and, and then play in the backbeat on two and four. And then dragon, I believe on the final note of a, the triplet into one.

Speaker 1:          00:12:52       That's what he's doing now. I know. Let's drum nerd shit, but I'll, I'll post the video. It's fucking insane. Um, so of course I went to the, you know, went down to the studio the next day and I tried to do it, you know, for like 10 minutes, you know, a, in whatever you learned something, you know, the first thing you do is you immediately try to play it at the same tempo is the drum God that you saw a play in it. So it was really fucking frustrating. I think I said, what the fuck, like 10 times. And then I just, you know, just scroll through my Ipod, iPad, whatever, my five phone and I just, hey ma'am. And just playing in the same shit of him playing two for 30 fucking years. I don't know what my deal is. I can't get out of it.

Speaker 1:          00:13:39       Thank God I buy new clothes. You know, if you should be like, you should be forced to wear the clothes. If you don't move ahead artistically, your wardrobe shouldn't either. You should be forced to fucking wear the same. I should be wearing an acid wash jeans with a fucking half shirt driving down the street, my rusted out 83 Ford Ranger. And they'd be like, listen, if you're not going to progress with the art of music, Yo, or whatever, if you can watch the same 10 fucking films. Um, yeah, I had no idea how far behind I was. Um, so, and I'm looking at mute math, like they haven't been fucking crushing it for 10 years. I actually went on the Internet and I looked them up and they liked, did let them in 2005. There you go, Bill. Wait to be on the cutting edge. So whenever I feel like I took a major step forward, but I want to thank everyone in the band for uh, you know, letting us come back and say hello real quick.

Speaker 1:          00:14:36       Uh, Darrin, Paul, Roy and Todd, you guys were fucking, you crushed it. And thank you to Andrew for taking me down there and, uh, pointing out what the fuck was going on so I could, you know, so the old man could figure it out. But, uh, I will definitely see those whenever I'm in a city that they're in and I'm able to do what it was that good of a fucking show. And like I said, they're in Portland then Seattle, and they got a week off than they were now Richmond. So, uh, definitely check it out. Anyways, plowing ahead here. Um, so that was my Friday. All right. So as a comedian, there's no way you take a Friday, Saturday off unless the UFC has a fucking paper view and it's caught on. And a Holly Holm at fighting, right. So I'm like, all right, I got to watch.

Speaker 1:          00:15:21       I thought they were both title fights. I didn't realize that Connor's fight was not a title fight. I think most people didn't realize that most people like me got drawn into a sport when there's someone like his, you know, I go in and out of the UFC, you know, like most shit. I go in and out of cooking, I go in and out of being a good comedian. I've just, I'm in an APP, right? I'm a fucking gem. And I, I'm into it. I'm into it. Go Fuck Yourself. Hey, remember that shit? And then I come back. Right. Except with my music, I just held onto it for just the little, the little teeth, you know, you can't always get what you well, um, what am I talking about? Anyways? So we have a bunch of people over, right? We go out, I go to the grocery store, I get a bunch of, I get some booze. I get, yeah, get some Gaba. Woo. I guess some fucking Aig by war. I get some fucking cheese and all of that shit. I, I go on, I get a bunch of ice cream sandwiches after everybody's all fucking salt it up with the Doritos and we sit down to watch the shit. And, um, what a fucking paper view, man.

Speaker 2:          00:16:25       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:16:25       You know, spoiler alert, you know, if you haven't heard yet, I'm going to say, who won? I mean, you should take beat Holly Holm, you know, and Nate Diaz beat Conor McGregor. It was fucking unreal. My, I'm in. Anybody else hosts a UFC fight party. How fucking satisfied did you feel was unreal? I had like 10 people screaming, Oh my God. Over and over again. Like twice in one night, flipping the fuck out. More screaming and yelling during that pay per view that I've heard in any super bowl. You know, I dunno. Superbowl party that had been to in a while. Um, it was unbelievable. But Jesus Christ once again, why always hate when like when a comedian is getting ready for a special or a late night spot and they say that they trade like a fighter at the, it's so disrespectful to what the men and women do who fight for a fucking living. It is, it is the most bad ass. I'm trying to think of like a more Badass job than that, other than, you know, you're one of the grunts on the front line in a war, then your fucking job is you just train your trading to beat the fuck out of somebody who's training to beat the fuck out of you. And you both are professionals. You do it for a living. A whole crowd of people shows up. You've ever fight after school. And like 10 people showed up was fucking nerve wracking. Fight, fight, fight. You guys walk into a fucking arena shortlist, just walking down there and they got to stare down some fucking maniac.

Speaker 1:          00:18:07       I live in there, own the, on the ground. Right? And that just taken fucking elbows and they had the presence of mind to look over at the clock. Like how much more of this shit I, another minute 38 of forearms to my fucking forehead. I don't know how they take it. So, um,

Speaker 2:          00:18:24       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:18:25       Unbelievable fight. I didn't realize that, uh, had gone up in two way classes. Like I said, I'm a very like, novice fan of this stuff. Um,

Speaker 2:          00:18:34       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:18:34       But Jesus Christ, fucking Nate Diaz sitting there and his whole face is all bloody. And he says, you know, I got this, I've taken your worst shot. She can't knock me out. It's just scar tissue. I've bled before.

Speaker 2:          00:18:49       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:18:49       I, I dunno, I dunno how to fuck you do that. He was bleeding so much. It looked like both of them were bleeding to death because he, once he got up against Mcgregor, whether it was all over both of them, um, I dunno, I really don't have anything to say other than I was blown away by both fucking fights and um,

Speaker 2:          00:19:09       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:19:10       You know, it was hard as it is to what I was was to watch Conor lose. Cause I mean the guy's a fucking superstar. I'm talking shit and then backing it up. Um,

Speaker 2:          00:19:20       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:19:20       It was still, you know, watching Nate do his choking and fucking I was, I was fucking unreal. I don't know. I don't know enough about the sport to talk about it intelligently, but I will say this, I hate when someone like Connor loses and then everybody, yeah, you fucking pussy sale that shit on the Internet. You know, go on Twitter and start trashing the guy. You know, I want to talk to people right now. If you're one of those people that do to, how do you, how do you like, how do you do something like that and like look yourself in the mirror when you go to brush your teeth at night, you know no one, you haven't had a fight since like the seventh grade. You know the fuck is wrong with you. If you all talked all the fucking shit. That's what it made it great sell in the fight.

Speaker 2:          00:20:02       I Dunno.

Speaker 1:          00:20:05       How great was that fucking lies you just knocked out. Caught him. I would choke dot Conor McGregor. How does it feel? He grabs the mic goes, I'm not surprised motherfuckers,

Speaker 4:          00:20:14       Chris,

Speaker 1:          00:20:16       I don't know about you guys, but it's one of the fucking coolest things I've ever seen. The fucking choke out. Somebody as good as, but Gregor that stand up all fucking bloody and just walk around. Flex it. Not even wiping the blood off, not concerned about how fucked up your faces. You don't give a fuck, right? Whatever. Jesus Christ. The second, I got a little scratch, I would have just, Oh my God, am I? MMM, that was great to see me. She, uh, Misha went to, but I, I, I as, as a fellow fair skinned person, I felt bad for Holly Holm, you know, just a second. We start getting beat on just the, the, our face just gets so fucking red and then our yellow eyebrows stand out. I just thought there was a lot of mean Shit said about her. Uh, when it came to that, I just come really related to it. By the way. What the fuck happened in Nate's, the side of his face and his neck.

Speaker 2:          00:21:15       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:21:15       Those scratches. How did that happen?

Speaker 1:          00:21:19       Like somebody took like a fucking, okay, you've got 10. We took a knife down the side of his face and his neck. He's just sitting there pawn at it. I, that's, I've gotten scratched like that every time somebody like exhale, just the wind of that made me go into the fetal position. Um, but anyways, you know, as great as that UFC pay per view was, it's what just makes me so fucking sad about what has happened to boxing. If they could somehow, if all the pieces, shit promoters in boxing could just unify and become one piece of shit promoter, you know, promotional entity like the UFC is right. Cause you know, you know, you know, have to deal, I don't know if you, if you're, if you're, if you're in any level of show business, you know, the promoters of fucking over the ax, you know, they are in an, in, in UFC, it's the fighters, you know, I know on some, I don't know anything about it, but I don't want someone it, they are getting fucked and because they're a complete monopoly, I'm sure they're fucking with their money. I'm sure there's a pressure to make people fight and that type of shit, which is why they try to break up monopolies. Having said that, it's fucking great for the fence because can the fact that the fighters have no other options, it's just the best fight the best. Um,

Speaker 2:          00:22:36       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:22:37       And like last night, like I haven't had that kind of excitement, like watching like a boxing pay per view, like consistently the way the UFC is consistently exciting like that since I would say the middleweight division. Um,

Speaker 2:          00:22:51       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:22:51       In the early eighties when you had Roberto Duran, Tommy Hearns, Marvelous Marvin Hagler and sugar ray Leonard all fighting each other, they all fought each other. They fought each other numerous fucking times. It was incredible. Um, I guess when Mike Tyson came along, but that was just more the spectacle of how quick was he going to just knock these people out.

Speaker 2:          00:23:15       Um, I dunno.

Speaker 1:          00:23:18       Just seeing a pay per view like that and then seeing that it took fucking 10 years for the Mayweather Pacquiao fight and then one of them shows up and he's fucking hurt. It doesn't say anything. He doesn't say anything and you still out 60 bucks is just fucking brutal. So anyways, um, hats off to that fucking paper view. Jesus Christ actually watched some Mcgregor fight again.

Speaker 2:          00:23:42       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:23:44       Unfucking believable.

Speaker 2:          00:23:47       I was just looking at the blood. I'm going, he's just going to keep fucking punching him right in that I just keep punching them right in that fucking, I like, who did that to that guy with the fucking yellow hair. Bleached hair was at fucking,

Speaker 1:          00:24:00       what the fuck was his name? GSP. I can't even know their fucking names. He just kept punching the dude in the eye over and over and over. And then it was always, I thought that that's what my Greg was going to do. Just keep punching native and that fucking, I, I just don't know how you doing? How's fuck you sit there with him? I'm done. Fucking done. You scratch me. I am done. Keep fighting. All right. I just keep saying the same thing over again. I was blown away by it and a respect to everybody who fought there. Um, anyways, uh, you know, it's weird to is McGregor is still the champion.

Speaker 2:          00:24:35       Okay.

Is there are V on fire in the Grand Canyon? Is she in Iraq?

Speaker 1:          00:30:42       I don't know. Maybe that's what they're supposed to do. Like I'm supposed to Pique my interest and I'm supposed to go on the Internet.

Um, I was sleeping upstairs last night.

Speaker 1:          00:33:10       Oh, fucking Joey Rose's swung by the house. We had a couple of cocktails, right? And then he went home. Ubered it like the hipster that he is over two is hipster neighborhood. You know, there's fucking his jags on or whatever the kids were wearing nowadays. And uh, I don't know. I, the only time I snort is when I fucking booze. So I wasn't going to do that to the lovely Nia. So I crashed upstairs and um, it started thundering and lightening at night. And what's fucking hilarious about living out here slash terrifying is it never rains. So when you hear thunder, you automatically think it's a fucking earthquake, but you bed isn't moving. So you kind of like, well, wait a minute, am I, I've never heard an earthquake that I couldn't feel. And you've got to like do the math when you're half asleep going like, is that like an earthquake?

Speaker 1:          00:34:06       And you know, in the valley and I can't fucking hear it. I can hear it, but I can't feel it. That that doesn't make any sense. And then you find figure, oh my God, that's thunder. Holy Shit. It's fucking raining out. Right. What does that in French, you split, you'll player. I can't fucking remember. I suck at that shit in edge. It is snowing. Um, anyway, so starts fucking rating and uh, it's tremendous. It's rained a bunch. It's an El Nino year. Thank Christ. And, uh, but what I was always in the depressing thing in the back of my head is as green and is lushes the hills. Look right now. Um, this is like basically the only rain we're going to get for the next fucking three years. And I know every cunt out here has taken long showers now going hey to folk and droughts over, you know, I just hope, uh, I dunno.

Speaker 1:          00:35:02       I hope it fucking rained. Keeps raining as much as it possibly fucking cans or we can't or there's a massive God damn play gout here. One of the other, something's got to give. Right. That's depressing isn't all right, let's get into um, oh no, wait, I was gonna tell you another thing. So yesterday I was just driving around, hanging out with my wife and a, they get a bunch of open houses out here, so I can't fuck it. Let's go look at some houses, you know, get some ideas for our old ass kitchen. See what a real kitchen looks like. Right. And, um, I got to tell you haven't bought this house and gone through all this shit that I've gone through. I look at houses entirely different. I'm immediately looking at the windows. Do they have the old ass original windows? Um, and I immediately want to go downstairs if there's a crawl space, anything, I want to go down there and I'm smelling for water.

Speaker 1:          00:35:52       And you can't really do that a lot out here because a, they don't, it doesn't rain enough. But I immediately look underneath the fucking house. I look right up it's fucking skirt. Like the home pervert. I am. And I'm immediately looking for, all right, let's see. What, what does the electrical work look look like? You know, is it galvanized pipe? What kind of Shit Hole, you know, looking at how stuff is put together. Does this look like it had a permit or not? And um, you know, all the sexy shit goes away. Like we have a pool and I'm just looking at it going like, and it's okay and it looks like a piece of shit to me that looks like you need to Redo the whole floor of that fucking thing. And so you've got to dump out all the fucking water and evidently you can't fill your pool up with water anymore out here.

Speaker 1:          00:36:37       You have to fly the fucking water in. So fuck that pool. I haven't got it in the house yet. You know there's a classic, they're saying it's a two car garage, but it is if you dry, if you drive to model t Fords, but if you have any sort of modern car, you're not going to be able to get the all, you can get two in there, but nobody can get out of the cars. So I was just a negative Nelly and actually realized that my house isn't as bad as I thought it was. Now that I fucking dumped every fucking dime that I have into it. Um, not made me feel good. I was just walking in the kitchen. I'm like, there's no prep space here. All this disco shit. I don't see any place where I could fucking slice an English muffin. You know what?

Speaker 1:          00:37:14       Fuck this kitchen. Fuck the pool. Fuck the kitchen and fuck this galvanized pipe. Oh look at this. Oh Wow. Rugs, rugs in every room. Yeah. Take your shoes off. Why is that? Yeah, cause the floors haven't been refinished and fucking 80 years. Fuck these floors. Let's go upstairs. Oh Great. I see this used to be an addict. Oh yeah. You call him that an office. Yeah. Yeah. I like how you're showing it during the winter time. Cause I know what happens in the summertime. It fucking heats up up here. Right. It could grow a fucking goddamn bullshit Bushel of fucking marijuana up here if he fucking three hours. Fuck this office. Right. You want to sign up on our mailing list now? I don't because you're selling piece of shit houses. And then that, that said I walked and I was done. And of course I upset my wife cause all I did was just, sorry, I actually only just shut off the fucking recorder.

Speaker 1:          00:38:05       I actually, I upset my wife because, you know, she's like, I like, you know, I thought we could just have fun. I don't understand why you have to go in the house and be rude to the real estate people say I don't like those people. You know, cause they don't encourage you to sell your house, you know, air quote for a fucking profit. So then you can buy back into the same market and then everything you just made on your house, you've got to buy it. You got to spend again just to get the same fucking house. I actually said that to the guy. I think that's, that's made my wife met and I go, yeah, the only people making money out of here are you in the banks. And the guy's like, whoa. Well that's not necessarily true. Yeah. Do the math. Tell me how that works. Can we get you to the mailing list? Um, all right, let's let some fucking questions here. Questions here for the Goddamn Week. Casco, Casco say mall something, right? What is, what does, I don't fucking know.

Speaker 2:          00:39:06       Guess could tell.

Speaker 1:          00:39:08       I'm just never going to get it. You know what? I don't, I just, there's no reason for me to speak it. All right, let's, let's plow ahead here. All right.

Speaker 2:          00:39:52       died.

Speaker 1:          00:39:55       He said Uncle Freddy died. Uncle Freddy. Hey Bill, I'm sending you an email about the guy who invented email dying today. This is my way of honoring what he did. I imagine he'll get very little press because Nancy just say, no. Reagan died this weekend too. Here's an article from an here's an excerpt from an article, uh, about him. Internet Hall of Famer raid. Tom Wilson has died. Tom Olson was the man who basically invented email as we know it today, including making the choice to use the at sign in an email address. He was 74 years old. Tomlinson, I think I said his name wrong, the first time. Tomlinson invented email assistant where a user on one network could send a message to someone on the another network in 1971 oh they left some of it out of there. Thomason invented a network. I mean, I'm going to read it the way I see it.

Speaker 1:          00:40:51       Tomlinson or Tom Wilson, however, I feel like reading Tomlinson invented email, a system where it user on one network could send a message to someone on another network while the government, advertisers and hackers could all read your private information. This was invented in 1971 had Tomlinson had any idea what people were going to do with his invention. What do you have made it? What do you have invented it and the answer is of course he would of how else was he going to get some pussy? All right. This was his slug like, Hey, can you meet my fucking friend Tomlinson over here? I don't want to beat him that he invented email. Oh my God. Hey you can I touch your peepee? Um, that's actually really interesting.

I said I want to start the augmentation research center lab. Where are you going? Um, where he pioneered a system for augmenting human intellect in which workers sitting at display workstations could collaborate on solutions to humanity's problems through a vast online information space.

Speaker 2:          00:43:55       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:43:56       Did, did it matter that no one ever fucking uses it?

I'd go to a sporting event or any sort of fucking basketball, anything you could see if he can go see the fucking golden state warriors. They one of the Becka regular season records of all time. If you can take in a fucking show, go see mute mass for fuck sakes. Um,

Speaker 1:          00:49:35       I dunno what I would do, dude, I'd go down south, right? I go to a fucking gun range. Do something like that. You want, this is what you want to do. You want to do some metropolitan shit, you want to do some sports shit and then you got to do some backward, backward shit. That's what I would do. You know, go find somebody drinking some moonshine out of a fucking jar, a mason jar, and then, you know, have him fucking smoke a God damn pork shoulder and go out and shoot his guns. They go ride some four wheelers, you know, do something like that. I Dunno, you know, a lot of people sleep on like Wyoming, Montana, the Dakotas. Those can all be fun to go see. And I can send you guys live in that little ass country, you know, I dunno dude. I'd ran a fucking classic American car and we now went from fucking New York to Chicago. I would drive that and I wouldn't take the highways. I try to find some old route and I'd stop off the greasy spoons. Sammy, you go. There we go. Jesus. I, there's a couple of ideas. I'm sorry dude. I really fucked you over on that. Went butter.

Speaker 2:          00:50:41       I don't know.

Speaker 1:          00:50:42       That's like when somebody, you remember back in the day when you actually shopped, you know, you bought CD's and stuff. I used to have all these CD's I'd want to buy and then when I would walk into virgin, I can never remember what the fuck I wanted. I'm sorry man. I really dropped the ball on that one. All right. To a first timer in the EU. That's not it. Uh, podcast got me in trouble with fiance's family. Uh, hey there. Billary Berm Clinton. Um, I fucked up man. And she can probably guess from the subject line.

Speaker 2:          00:51:10       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:51:11       Cue The old Jj. Um, as a little background, I'm getting married next month to my fiance, who is wonderful love of my life and all that. We were visiting her family last night and playing board games, which we often do. Oh, Jesus. Oh, what happened? Were you drinking? Did you get competitive? Huh? Gee accuse her mom of cheating. Uh, he goes, I'll spare you the details, but we were playing a card game with a bunch of characters. Everyone gets the same people, but when you use them is really the key to the game. There was a particularly powerful card I had held onto until the very last stage of the game. The character's name was granny water.

Speaker 2:          00:51:56       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:51:58       Pronounce Gary Water. I gave you the pronunciation and accent so you wouldn't fuck it up. Well, it is spelled w a t a granny. Why? It's the last round of the game and everyone's going around revealing their card. I was last and my plan had worked perfectly. As I went to reveal it, my inner bill bird took over and I really got excited. I flipped it over. Oh, you did it? He goes, oh no. Oh No. He goes, I said, it's granny.

Speaker 5:          00:52:33       Yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:52:35       Dude. You drop the F bomb. Oh my God, I wish I had podcast tee shirts. I'd send one to you. No, you did. He goes, silence followed as it echoed through the house. My fiance's family were stunned. They're not super uptight people, but people just don't just don't throw fucks around during a board game. You know, from there it only got worse. My fiance is listened to your podcast, so she knows I was imitating you. She tried to stammer out an explanation or no, she had to explain a way, your behavior.

Speaker 2:          00:53:13       Ah Dude.

Speaker 1:          00:53:16       He goes, but it didn't really do anything. I also tried to apologize sheepishly. Then on top of that, that move gave me enough points, win the game over everyone. So I had to awkwardly mark my score, which made me the winner.

Speaker 2:          00:53:32       Wow, dude.

Speaker 1:          00:53:35       Oh, when you're getting married next month, so the fucking taste of this is still going to be in their mouth. He goes, we left almost immediately after and of course I got yelled at all the way home. I knew I deserved it, so I didn't even put up much of a fight. That's your first good move in this story. Oh Wow. He goes, my question is do I try and go out of my way to remedy this situation or do I just hope everyone forgets about it and moves on? We're getting married in six weeks, so it's not like I can avoid them for very long, um, perse because I fucking crush the impression too.

Speaker 1:          00:54:11       Thanks. And Go fuck yourself. Sorry for the Hillary Clinton referencing the opener. I think she's a cunt to, uh, I don't think she's a contract. Just don't think she's an honest person. And I don't think just because of the fact that we've never had a woman president that that's reason enough to elect someone is dishonest and as phony as her. Um, anyways, though, you know what, I would, I would actually, uh, without your wife. I would just drive over there and just say, listen, I got to apologize. I listened to this podcast. I'm a big fan of the guy. Um, I was making a joke and in the moment I didn't realize that you guys didn't listen to the podcast if you want and just kept queue up a clip. Well, you have it, which might be a bad thing to do, but like, just have me like saying something else, doctor cabbies, easy shave butter. But then you might be fuck, cause I don't say fuck.

Speaker 2:          00:55:04       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:55:06       Just say, just tell him you're really embarrassed or whatever. I think if you went over there by yourself, I think, uh, especially her dad, cause I think that's the big one there. I think there's, there's something extra when it's, you know, it's always extra, you know, when, when you're getting married like a,

Speaker 2:          00:55:28       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:55:28       You know, if you're a guy, you know the, the dad's going to be looking at you twice as hard and the mom, she'll be like, oh, he's no, it's relax. You know? And then the other way around is if, you know, they have a son and he brings it a woman around, like the mother's going to be fucking looking at her to see if she's a fucking, you know, an evil little whore. You know, the dad's going to be looking at you like, cause this guy going to be overbearing and slap my fucking daughter. Right. Or whatever. You know what I mean? See a piece of shit. Right. Um, oh my God, dude. Wow. You said it's granny. Fuck. Oh God, dude, if you film that, oh my God.

Speaker 2:          00:56:11       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:56:12       Jesus Christ. Dude, I got to give it. I got it. My tip of the cap for you there, man, for doing that. Holy Shit. I'm getting uncomfortable just thinking about that. Well, can I, I'll apologize. Can I apologize to your fiance for being a bad fucking a bad, um, influence. Hey, you know what? Play this to a play this tea a year, a year. Future inlaws dear future in laws. Hello. I'm bill burr. I'm the one who says granny. I say this type of stuff. I've been the bad influence. Don't be mad at him. I'm sure he's a wonderful human being. I'm sorry. Messed up. He messed up. You're a little kid game there. Um, yeah, he's going to make a great son in law. You know why? Cause he uses Dr cabbies. Easy. Shame.

Speaker 1:          00:57:02       Don't play that to them. That's not going to get you into anything that's going to say he listens to morons. He must be a moron. Are they going to have half a moron kid? All right. Not eating birthday cake. Huge fan of the podcast is a 27 year old who works in a stereotypical white collar suburban office. I thoroughly enjoy, listen to you by your biweekly rants at my desk. Wonderful man. Uh, speaking of which, I work in the corporate offices of a sales and distribution company that has about 50 employees, but only about 15 people work in my specific office location, which means that about once every motherfucking month we gather in the big conference room and do the cliche awkward office Happy Birthday Song. Oh No. With candles and cake routine and all of that. What I am by, no me. Okay. Well I am by no means a health nut.

Speaker 1:          00:57:53       I also try very hard to take care of my body during the workday by eating properly and drinking lots of water. I've also gotten really into bike racing over the past years, which has taught me a lot about the importance of nutrition, etc. Uh, so the thought of eating a giant piece of chocolate cake at two 30 in the afternoon when my eyes are pre practically bleeding from staring at a computer screen all day, we do nothing but make me feel like absolute shit and I really have no interest. Very smart. Uh, this is why for the past couple of years, I politely turned down every piece of birthday cake that has been offered to me at these after mentioned ceremonies. Unfortunately, I am the only one at my coworkers, most of whom are women who has adopted this no cake philosophy. So every single time I stick, I stick out like a sore thumb after I declined the piece that is passed to me, at which point I have to deal with this wave of passive aggression from these ladies regarding my decision to abstain from the sacred ritual.

Speaker 1:          00:58:52       I also share a birthday with one of my coworkers. So I am spared some of the awkwardness that goes along with from fusing cake on my own birthday, but still made out to be some kind of monster. Okay, Jesus going on and on here. Well, I have no intention of succumbing to the peer pressure brought forth by my colleagues. This might be the best written fucking letter I've ever had on the podcast. Is it possible that I'm being rude by not sharing in the celebration? What's more is that even if I found out people did that I was being douchey by not eating cake, I still wouldn't give a shit what they think. Does this make me a sociopath? No, it doesn't. It makes you somebody who knows what he wants and everybody else's do you know, you just, you just get, you know what you, you need to just get a little space here.

Speaker 1:          00:59:37       A couple of little verbal, you know, you know, you know the great ones create space and all, you know, football, hockey, basketball. You don't have to do that baseball. But you know what I mean? The great ones create space. Okay? So what you have to do is you have to tap into your greatness and you have to create space. Okay? And just say, look, people, it's not that I'm not happy that it's your birthday. I just don't want to become a lard ass. I mean, I'm not being a dick here, but you know a lot of you, I'm not gonna say who over the years, your slacks just keep getting bigger because you keep eating all this fucking cake. All right? You blowing out your bodies and I'm not going to be a part of it and a part of me dies every time I watch you guys eat in this shit. But if that's what you want to do, by all means go ahead and do it. But I'm not going to become a fucking cow like most of you guys are. You know what I mean? Half of you should have bells around you fucking next. Alright, there you go. You just know, right? They'll never ask you for cake again. You probably want to get invited, you know,

Speaker 1:          01:00:44       that's what fucking a, this was Sydney Crosby would do. Right.

Speaker 2:          01:00:49       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:00:49       Mario Lemieux the great ones to create space. No, dude, you're not a sociopath, right? You're doing the right thing, you know, I dunno. I Dunno why women like sweet so much. You know, I actually, I like sweets. I'm just a big fruit basket. Um, I actually like sweets, but when I stay away from him for awhile, if you really abstained from fucking desserts and everything, if you walk into a place that has a bunch of crazy desserts, it doesn't even look like, like edible for human consumption. You know what I mean? It looks, I always said it looks like clown food. You know what I mean? Like a clown sneezed. Especially if it's really like a lot of like fruits and fucking whip cream and all of that shit. Just like this. It looks ridiculous. It's always crazy colors, Greens and purples, right? You don't want the right thing.

Speaker 1:          01:01:41       There's all I'm saying you're doing the right thing, you know, is in the bike race and you're working out, you know, this is the deal that you've actually got a chance of bagging, banging one of those fucking cake eat and broads at in, in your section because they, they're going to see like a half of them are probably just testing you. The other half are fucking probably codependent fucking cake eaters and they feel guilty, you know, and they know that after they eat that, then that sugar is going to be in their veins and then they're going to go back to their desk and they're going to start eating a handful of fucking cheddar flavored goldfish to shoving them down. You know? I bet if you walked around your little section and you have the cubicles and you looked at their keyboards, I bet keyboards or greasy a bit.

Speaker 1:          01:02:21       There's crumbs in them. I don't know. You know what? I think you, I think you have to go to work there when you think about that.

I made them a little fucking audio thing that he can play. The two is, uh, in loss. Oh, is it filled with you saying fuck over and over again? Why? I had the, I don't know if that was going to help, but I had to do it in a way that they like, you know, saw what a bad influence on. Oh, it's just a silly awkward moment. It's fine.
