Speaker 1:          00:00:01       Hey, what's going on? It's bill burn his time for the Thursday afternoon, just before Friday, Monday morning podcast and just checking in on you. How's it going? As you can hopefully immediately tell, especially after I just pushed that button. I um, I forgot, I didn't forget my recording equipment. I'm having a problem with one of the cords. I can't tell if the cord got stepped on and it's fucked up or the Jack to my computer's messed up. But I've learned in life to not force things because you just make a bad situation a little worse. So I'm just kind of to record this one like this and maybe Monday, cause I'm on the road right now. I'm out here in Nashville, Tennessee, Nashville, Tennessee, home with the Grand Ole Opry and that fucking [inaudible] river that overflows in the evil looking building downtown. Other than that, wonderful people, great food and all that type of shit.

Speaker 1:          00:00:56       Um, I'm out here for one day and one day on week. I know you guys probably think, well what the fuck bill, you didn't advertise it on your goddamn website. Are you doing a stand up show? I am not, what I am doing is a, I'm doing a panel thing for f is for family with uh, the Great Mike Price. Cocreator co creator of the show from other Simpsons were doing like a live thing where they show an episode and then we answer some questions, um, hosted by Russell Peters and it's going to be on Xm Sirius. I don't know what channel of course, cause I'm a moron, but that's basically what I'm doing here. And then I go off to Calgary tomorrow morning, Calgary, Edmonton and then Seattle. So, oh, I got some stories for you. I hope these levels are okay. I did my best with them. Um, this was my plane ride out to Nashville, so we wrote all day and then, uh, I took the red eye out and um,

Speaker 2:          00:01:57       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:01:58       The dude who sat next to me on the fucking plane, God bless him, but he's one of these guys, man, if he doesn't turn it around, he's not going to see 50 because

Speaker 2:          00:02:08       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:02:08       He was one of those guys who was abusing his body so bad. Like, I can't, like when I go go to guesses age, it's going to, he was either like 26 to 28.

Speaker 2:          00:02:21       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:02:22       Or like 37. I couldn't tell, but he looked as old as me. Uh,

Speaker 1:          00:02:30       he looked like he was, if he was my age, you're like, dude, you got like another two years because if you fucking did that to yourself for close to 48 years, you would be done this fucking guy, man. Holy Shit. He put on a display. All right. So you know it's late at night and take them right. I like I said 11:00 PM and I got the aisle, he's got the window. Right. And fortunately my Sciatica is, is almost yeah, but gone away. And um, I just been taking it easy and a, it's just sort of naturally working itself out while doing all the, all the stretches and all that shit. So anyways, he's got the fucking window seat and I'm thinking I'm being smarter than the aisle thing because all right, if I need to stretch I can just step out into the island and won't have to step over anybody. Um, cause I fucked up. Last time I went to Saint Louis, I flew southwest and I wasn't thinking, I just went to the window seat and then I was trapped, you know, on the other side of two other people. So this time I'm thinking I'm being smart, but it turns out my back feels great and now all I want to do was go to sleep in this fucking guy. Man. Holy Shit.

Speaker 1:          00:03:39       This guy was like crushing the fucking airport bar. I don't know how many fucking Jack and cokes this guy drank. But he just kept going like the guy would, he would just go, can I get another one? And then the guy would bring it over and he'd be like, my dude, thank you freight. Some reason he said my dude. And then he would just be sucking these sinks down. And he was one of these fucking guys that was so out of shape. Like he snored while he was awake. You know what I mean? He did the noises this guide makes right. So after about, I dunno, like fucking five of these things. We're in the flight, I'm starting to nod off. He fucking goes to step over me. Mountain of a man goes to step over me, you know, which course sort of wakes me up and he goes into the bathroom and I noticed he's wearing his socks. Fucking animal. This guy is like trying to kill himself from all sides. You know what I made? Death comes from the mouth, but he's also trying to fucking speed it up. Try to go into the express lane by bringing a little in through the fucking pores of the bottom of his feet. People.

Speaker 1:          00:04:48       It's not your fault that you weren't raised right, but you got to look around in life. Okay? You got to do the fucking math. I almost think. What do you think it's his grocer to? To be in your bare feet or in your socks. I know initially the bare feet has worked worse, but does something about the socks just absorbing it and like, you know, the next day if you put them on again after you took a shower, you still got the fucking shit and cause it's going India feet no matter what. One of the grossest things, so the entire fucking flight, this guy has just pounding Jack and cokes. I mean he had, he must've had like nine of them on like a a,

Speaker 1:          00:05:29       I don't know how long that flight is like four fucking hours and I'm trying to sleep and I can't get to sleep because, you know, he's a big guy. He's a cool guy. He was trying to step over, you know, one point I did that Vietnamese gamblers squat and he's like, he goes, what are you doing? You praying over there? You all right? And I said, no, I got it. I got a Sattik nervous unit. He goes, Oh man, that sucks. So I couldn't get mad at him cause he was friendly spot. Every time he went to step over me, he'd fucking wake me up and then I'd look and he'd be going into the bathroom just wearing his socks and it just was driving me fucking nuts. So finally, all I'm thinking is going, my God, when this fucking mountain of a man goes down, like he is going to snore like a, I mean, I've never had the displeasure of sleeping next to Terry Saragossa, whatever's Tony Serra Bussa but I imagined he was going to sound like whatever that guy sounds like at like two o'clock in the fucking morning.

Speaker 1:          00:06:22       Right. But it was the weirdest thing. He was snoring while he was awake, but when he was, when he went to sleep, he didn't make a fucking sound. And uh, oh, he kept dropping his fucking iPhone. He had his shoes off and just the noises he was trying to make to try to pick it up. It's like, why the fuck would you do to that? Do that to yourself, these fucking people that treat their own bodies like a rental car, I just don't understand it. It's like you can't return this fucking thing. At the end of the weekend, you got to keep, this is the vessel that's going to bring you around for your fucking life. You know, I mean, I should talk the way I fucking booze, but you know, I still do my jumping jacks and I do a couple of cartwheels to keep the stomach down, you know. So anyways, the flight fucking ends, my travel is all fucked up for whatever reason. And um, I'm basically,

Speaker 1:          00:07:10       by the time they booked my hotel, everything was sold out. So I had a hotel for the night, but I couldn't check in until three in the afternoon. So I go, you know, so they booked me at another hotel and the person, you know, the travel person goes, so you've got to check in at this hotel, you know, at five 30 in the morning and then check out at 12 and then check in for the other places. It is like at 3:00 PM it's like, is that cool? And I'm like, no, it's not cool. Like, do you ever travel? Is that the way you set up your travel? Do you want to switch hotels? You know, in the same fucking city you staying. But I mean I don't have any choice, so it's going to have to be cool. So I fucking take a cab over there. I get to the place that like fucking five 30 in the morning. It's like planes, trains and automobiles, right. I get there and they're like, yeah, what's it under? And I'm like, oh no. I'm like bill burr. They're like, yeah, see I'm like William, Eh rumple fucking still scan. I may not get it right. And the guy keeps going, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I'm like, well I know it's not your fault. So now it's like fucking five and the God damn morning,

Speaker 1:          00:08:20       I got no place to stay. And he goes, well the bellhop can take you over to the fucking waffle house. Right. Sorry if I make Mike Noise here, I to move this laptop around cause I want you to fucking hear this thing. So good. Yeah. I'm sorry if a,

Speaker 1:          00:08:33       you know, sorry about that. So the fucking, so now it like fucking five 20 in the morning. I got no place to stay til three in the afternoon. I'm fucking dead tired. I couldn't sleep because all fatty cakes over there was drinking the fucking, uh, Jack and cokes all night, stepping over on me with his fucking piss and shit and fested soak socks and now they don't have a room for me. And now I'm to a waffle house. Right. So I get to the fucking waffle house, you know, it fucking quarter to six in the morning, half expecting to see Jay z finishing the end of that song. You know, it'll fucking thing go to the waffle house and we're going to do it again or how the fuck, I guess he'd be walking out with them right to banger and then kicked around at seven. Well, Beyonce sings lemonade in the background. I don't know what the fuck it is, those two do. I don't pretend to know. I'm an old man anyways, so I walk in there,

Speaker 3:          00:09:26       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:09:27       Bunch of fucking characters and uh, um, bleary died. I'm not even fucking hungry, but I know I can't just sit in there like some sort of vagrant soil, some eggs, and a fucking waffle. And I'm sitting there and this black guy in there wearing a suit and he's, he's like an anomaly. I don't know. He sees a black guy, but he isn't funny.

Speaker 3:          00:09:50       It's very rare. It's like an obese Asian. It's very rare that you see like obesity, you know, I don't know what food they eat over in Asia, but I mean, whatever they're doing, they're doing it right with all the vegetables and the third fried, those, those people are phenomenal.

Speaker 1:          00:10:07       Okay. And it was getting old, right? Have you, once you, it's very rare you meet a black guy wasn't funny. This fucking guy is not funny. Any, won't shut the fuck up. He keeps telling jokes and he's laughing at his own fucking jokes and I just want to, I want to stab myself with my fucking waffle house. Fucking fork. So at one point he just won't shut up. And then finally one of the waitresses makes a joke. Well, and the other way to see all the way to goes, you know, don't be walking up behind me. You know, you don't want to, you know, you don't want to basically fuck with me. And then the lady goes, no, she goes, I don't slight pregnant women and she wasn't pregnant. Okay. But admittedly it was a decent joke. The unfunny black dude in the suit, you know, high pitch left, stands up, runs out of the waffle house, goes up to the front and does like a fucking three 60 turn and immediately the fucking, you know, the road weary comedian in me going like, all right dude. It was funny. It wasn't that fucking funny. And uh,

Speaker 3:          00:11:13       yeah,

Speaker 4:          00:11:14       he comes back in and then I didn't know what the fuck they do. I'm like, what the fuck am I going to do with myself? I can't go to sleep.

Speaker 3:          00:11:20       Yeah.

Speaker 4:          00:11:20       My phone's running out of batteries. I'm charging it there. It was just a fucking nightmare. So, uh, I just started calling hotels. They're all fucking booked up. I don't know what's going on here in Nashville. If there's some sort of fucking Banjo festival, I have no fucking idea. But there's no way, some Jesus Shit.

Speaker 3:          00:11:36       Okay.

Speaker 4:          00:11:37       You know, or some, you know, democratic or Republican convention, I have no fucking idea, but I cannot get a room. So, you know, I'm like, what do I do? So I called in EOP and Jimmy show.

Speaker 3:          00:11:48       Yeah,

Speaker 4:          00:11:49       I talked to them for a minute and then I was just like, what am I doing? So I finally, the cat and I just went over to the hotel that I was supposed to be at and they were like, and they were like, oh yeah, you know, somebody called said, you know, fucking last night if we could get you in, unfortunately we can not blah blah blah, blah blah. So I at least check my bags, you know, I felt like a fucking homeless person when I was in the waffle house with the unfunny black dude. And I had my fucking bags on the inside of myself as I sat in the booth, made the two fucking people, but of sitting there by myself. Right. So I get to the hotel, at least checked in my bags and they had a fucking like a couch in the lobby of this place.

Speaker 4:          00:12:32       They go, we're already cleaning a room and at this point it's six 30 in the morning. And I'm like, great. Whenever you can get me in, if I got to pay extra, I just don't give a shit. Right. So they say fine. So I go over, then I just lay down on the couch, put my hat over my eyes, and I just pass out. I'm talking like I wasn't even trying to be a gentleman. I had both feet up on the fucking couch. I was like, this is my bed and I'm just sleeping there and I just keep hearing people's, they're getting waking up, getting on with their day.

Speaker 1:          00:13:03       You want to get some smoke.

Speaker 4:          00:13:06       I heard they have such great eggs and all this shit. And then at one point this guy walked by, you know, it was fucking assholes who whistle a fucking, you know, I think I tweeted, nobody likes a whistler at some point. This is fucking guy just came by whistling, you know, just, it's just some random song. It's not even, it's not even a fucking song. He's just whistling cause that's what the fuck he does. Um, and, uh, then I just completely, I was just zonked out and then all of a sudden I just feel somebody pushing me once twice and I fucking wake up and then they go, hey Mr up, your room's ready. I'm like thinking, oh, thank God. And I thought it was like seven 30 in the morning. I looked, it was like 10, 15 if it's sleeping at like a bum for like four hours.

Speaker 4:          00:13:49       So I finally ended up getting my fucking room and uh, fortunately it was one of these rooms that has the great curtains. I was able to close them and it felt like midnight and I'm then I just fucking crashed, woke up, met some friends that I've met along the way on the road and uh, took a drum lesson. Um, I hate dropping names on this, but like, they're one of my favorite bands out there right now. Mute math is based out of here. And, uh, I got some lunch and down king actually gave me a little drum lesson. I still stink, but it was fucking like, I was beyond geeking out that I got to do it. So, um, it was a bad day and I actually, uh, ended up turning it around and, uh, I'll tell you what's funny is if you notice in the story, I never flipped up. Bear with me. Watch your ears. I've got to click and drag this thing over. Just hang on a second. I apologize. Here we go. Here we go. It's almost over and it's over. And I just realized I have no idea how much time I'm doing here. The fuck

Speaker 1:          00:14:52       does this mean here for 47, 448, 448 one millimeters is just the metric system where the Fox, the timer. How do I tell him much time I'm doing

Speaker 4:          00:15:05       all right. You just going to have to fucking deal with this. I apologize. Anyways, um, I got this weird thing when like major shit happens. Like I don't, um, I don't flip out like bigger shit like this. I don't flip out little shit bugs me. Like 20 minutes ago, I'm going down in the elevator and we just hit every fucking floor and every fucking floor is another person coming on a fucking full grown adult wearing their name, a name tag around their neck, like it's their first day of preschool and everybody knows everybody. Hey Carl, like the shorts, you're wearing those to the meeting. It crazy right down one more floor. Every fucking floor. It's getting more and more packed. And then I have

Speaker 1:          00:15:48       to sit there and listen to office humor, right? I'll tell you right now, if you think every once in a while, a random black dude in a suit in a waffle house isn't funny. Wait till you're in a crowded elevator with a bunch of people that sit in cubicles all day. They had their fucking name tags around the neck listening to their jokes for eight fucking floors that I like. I was, by the time I got to the third floor, I was fucking livid. I was so fucking angry that the people around me could sense it, that when I went to get off the elevator, even women got out of the way. So I'm not proud of that. Which you would think I would have flipped out at at the big, don't stepping over me or I would've thought this anyways, or I would have flipped out when my room wasn't ready. I would have flipped out. You know, even when I sent the text message to my travel person,

Speaker 1:          00:16:40       I didn't curse. I didn't say that they fucked it up. I know somebody fucked it up. But I've learned in the past to not just slice the head off of the first person. I just went very like, you know, I don't know what happened, but this is not acceptable. People knew I was coming here for two months. I don't understand. I've never had this problem before. This can happen again. I am now on my way to a waffle house at five 21 in the morning with all of my bags and I just, you know what, what else do you need the fucking second? Right. So

Speaker 4:          00:17:11       anyways, it all ended up working out. And, uh, I got some great food out here and, uh, I ended up running into one of the cast members of Nashville, which is my wife's favorite fucking show, unfortunately. Just got canceled and I ran into the guy, Charles Ashton, and he was the coolest fucking guy am I was like, oh my God, my wife loves you. Show is there any way I could get a picture? And he goes, no, put it on video. He goes, watch this. He goes, you do the intro.

Speaker 1:          00:17:36       He was so fucking cool. So I just was like, Hey, yeah. Well, I'm in Nashville. I ran into one of the locals and then it turns in, it's his face and he just goes, Hey Dan, thanks for watching the show. She freaked out and I got some good points, so thank you to Charles. Make it my fucking, uh, making my married life a little easier. So a, so they go, I don't know how much time that took up. According to a garage band, I'm at 540 something.

Speaker 2:          00:18:02       Yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:18:02       540 fucking of these.

Speaker 1:          00:18:09       My really supposed to do that math had I have I not done 10 minutes yet. 600 seconds is 10 minutes. Oh Jesus. I don't even know what I'm talking about. This point.

Speaker 5:          00:22:36       MMM.

Speaker 4:          00:22:38       I went into the, uh, the drug store out here because I forgot my, a leaf to kelp to help my inflame Sciatica here. And um,

Speaker 5:          00:22:48       okay.

Speaker 4:          00:22:48       Sciatic nerve I should say. And um,

Speaker 5:          00:22:51       okay,

Speaker 4:          00:22:52       I went in there and this, this campaign, that red nose fucking fun thing, whatever. And it's all these,

Speaker 5:          00:22:59       okay.

Speaker 4:          00:22:59       It's some sort of charity and it's all these fucking people. Famous people wearing the red nose. So I'm going, what the, what is this? I keep seeing this. So I start reading the box and it says Walgreens will donate 100% of everything that they gain, collect or whatever to this red nose camp, red nose fund. 100% is going to this red nose fund. So I'm like, all right, what is it? What is the fund? Nowhere on the box. Will it say what the fuck it is? It doesn't say what it's raising money for. Nowhere on the box. So I asked the lady behind the counter and it goes, so what is this for? If I buy one of these red noses, what is this for? She goes, Oh, you get one of these? And it was like a little fucking gift certificate off of fucking chapstick or something. I go, no, no, no, no. I, I don't like what I get. If I buy a red nose, like, where does the money go? Who am I helping out? She goes, oh, I don't know. It's like my first day.

Speaker 4:          00:24:02       And I just laughed. I was like, well, I'm going to just start the fucking green hat fun and everything's going to go to me. She sorta like, I guess half ass left. I should have told it to the black guy in the suit and the fucking waffle house he would have ran out of the place then 15 cart wheels and come back in. Don't, it's not that funny. Um, I'm telling you, man, that's the new, I'm not saying the red nose thing is a scam, but it's pretty fucking shifty, pretty shady than I'm sitting there looking at all these celebrities and it's just the red nose fund and there's nothing on there. Same way the money goes, you know, is it, shouldn't that red nose thing bring up a couple of red flags there? Um, I think that that's the new, there's two new things going on in this country that are actually generating income for people. The legal selling of weed at the state level and um, nonprofits.

Speaker 6:          00:24:53       Okay.

Speaker 4:          00:24:53       Nonprofit is like the new hardware store. Like back in the day you had to open a store and actually sell shit. And nowadays you can just start fucking come up with a mirror, a mirror, not a ribbon of fucking wristband, a red fucking nose have people dump ice water over their fucking head, whatever it is. You know, some of them are legit. I got this fail and most of them aren't. And I kind of feel like,

Speaker 6:          00:25:21       okay,

Speaker 4:          00:25:22       if you're old like me, and you remember the late eighties when all those televangelists were on TV and they went to like this national fucking level and they just made hundreds of millions of dollars before it all just came out that it was just this giant fucking cash grab. I feel like all those fucking nonprofits, it has to be going in that direction and how all these sports, uh, sports leagues get in bed with all of these fucking people. Um,

Speaker 6:          00:25:49       okay.

Speaker 4:          00:25:49       I Dunno, maybe they have enough money. Maybe you have enough money to keep it silent. But, uh, I dunno. I'm Kinda done. I give money to saint Jude's hospital. That's it. Everything else. I just, I, I don't have the fucking time to figure out whether or not you're a fucking scam or not because I gave to that wounded warrior shit. I gave so many, I gave so much fucking money. I used to donate like 10% of the Shit I made in the advertising to those fucking people. And then people started sending me these, these articles and the next thing you know, they get investigated and all that type of shit. And I don't even know. I didn't, I just stopped following the story and I just stopped giving him money because,

Speaker 6:          00:26:29       okay.

Speaker 4:          00:26:30       I don't, I don't know. I don't know if it's true or not. I don't even fucking want to know. But like, I just feel like the future of helping people out is literally walking up to a wounded warrior, like finding out where the fuck they live and be like, what do you need? Go out and get it. Or you raise the money and then you give it to them. But then if I raise it, then do I become one of those people and be like, oh, we have a little bit of overhead and all of a sudden I have some sick ass drum room and I just bring a fucking box of bandaids to a fucking veteran. I mean, that's what seems what all these, I don't know. I'm, I'm a cynical son of a bitch, but my new shit is I want to just, um, I, I still love doing charities. I love doing benefits. I did one the other night for like a fucking, it was for like a private school. It's like, it's a fucking private school. Like you guys don't need money. It's like, oh, it's for the people who can't afford it. It's like, is it,

Speaker 4:          00:27:24       who knows what it is? You just saying what it is and then what? Then all of a sudden they, yeah. Who gets the money? Where does it go? Where does that person go? Or they in Tahiti. Are they helping somebody out? Nobody fucking knows. It's brilliant. It's fucking brilliant. I hope that red nose things is on the label is on the labels on the level. Sorry, I didn't get a good night's sleep. You know those hotel couches are, and what they fucking used to be there.

Speaker 5:          00:27:51       MMM.

Speaker 4:          00:27:53       I honestly have no, no idea how much time I've done here. I'm up til like 838 of these seconds here. I'm just going to say this seconds.

Speaker 5:          00:28:02       Right.

Speaker 4:          00:28:03       Well, let's see if there's 600 seconds in 10 minutes.

Speaker 5:          00:28:08       Yeah.

Speaker 4:          00:28:09       So that means that'd be 1800 seconds and a half. That has no fucking way. That's only a second. What if it's two seconds? I gotta be coming up. I'm going to say it's two seconds. Fuck it. It's two seconds. So all you gotta do is just make it up to 900 and I got another 49 to go. Oh, it's fucking easy. Let's talk a little playoff hockey. Everybody. Anybody watched ya? I keep missing just to how busy I am. I keep missing, um, that uh, that Tampa Bay Pittsburgh series, I caught the end of a, a game three with the penguins were up and then the game a couple of right, their threads to put it out of reach. And I fucking sense a buddy of mine in Pittsburgh, a text congratulating them because as much as I don't like what the penguins cheap shot artists have done to the Bruins, uh, you know, I don't take it to the level that I don't want my friends teams to win. So I said congratulations. And the second I sent that Tampa Bay scored one and I felt like I jinxed them for half a second. But, um, I've been watching the blues and in San Jose Shacks and uh, this is fucking huge tonight

Speaker 4:          00:29:19       for the blues because San Jose obviously adjust it to whatever the fuck the blues we're doing and gain one. And uh, so now blues have to adjust to whatever San Jose was doing it because San Jose Pretty, uh, dominated pretty much wire to wire the last game. And uh, I dunno if it's making me nervous as a, as a total bandwagon blues fan. They obviously got a witness.

Speaker 1:          00:29:44       Well that's such a stupid thing to say. It was a busy, it's just one, a big one. Bill. Should they not go down three games to one? You fucking dope. Um, big shout out to all the soccer fans over there in Europe that got so fucking annoyed at everything that I said that I shouldn't talk about

Speaker 4:          00:29:57       about uh, um, sports over in Europe.

Speaker 1:          00:30:01       You guys all make a great point because I don't watch them and I don't know anything about them. But uh, what you fail to understand is how much I enjoy irritating the shit out of people that I'd never met before. So I stand by. What the fuck? I said you guys should have some sort of in the premier league, you should have a fucking play off play off the fact that somebody can win a fucking championship because another team came to like a tie and like that's it. Just imagine every fucking movie about soccer is always, there's the big fucking game, right? And then somebody comes down and scores a goal. It's not like the stars of the movie standing around waiting for somebody to fucking, you know, have a one, one ty was somebody. Is this sitting there and fucking street clothes or sitting in an apartment doing jello shots with each other.

Speaker 4:          00:30:59       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:31:00       I don't know. I'm just fucking with you. I know. Remember that's the best of Solo movie victory ended them

Speaker 4:          00:31:04       okay

Speaker 1:          00:31:04       with them walking away from the game. Oh No, no. They were going to do it. They wanted to escape and then they came back because they wanted to beat the guys.

Speaker 4:          00:31:12       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:31:12       And if that was actually based on anything real, um, the game would have ended and then they would have won. They would have been brought back to the prison camp and they would of been beaten to death. But instead what ended up happening was they came back and they beat the Nazis, these prisoners allied prisoners of

Speaker 4:          00:31:29       or,

Speaker 1:          00:31:30       and then they fucking, uh, they just walked out with the crowd that's stored under the field and gave him extra clothes and shit.

Speaker 4:          00:31:37       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:31:38       I Dunno. I'm sure it was based on a true story, but, uh, I've seen enough of the Germans and their respect for life outside of their own country.

Speaker 4:          00:31:46       Um, for people

Speaker 1:          00:31:47       who are non German, I think that they would have just opened up on the crowd. So I'm calling bullshit. That movie was called victory, by the way, by the way. It wasn't

Speaker 4:          00:31:57       great. It was, I actually really enjoyed that movie, but it was when I first got cable. So who knows. Um, anyways, is that, is that a half hour? I'm up to 962 seconds or a 1800. I have no fucking idea. You know what I'm going to find out here because I'm going to have to do the Monday morning podcasts like this one also. And uh, my timing will be a little bit better on the next one cause I'll know exactly how much time I'm doing. I just don't understand why this would fucking thing. Wouldn't tell me how much time, but I'm not gonna start hitting buttons going, it's going to be irritating to you if you listen to it on a fucking with headphones.

Speaker 1:          00:32:33       So anyways, that's it for the Thursday afternoon podcast. Just checking in on you. Hope you can't have a great and a his little bit of music and uh, enjoy the a clips from a podcasts from years gone ball.

Speaker 2:          00:32:49       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:32:50       And of course like, Hey, where there it is.

Speaker 7:          00:34:49       Hey, what's going on? It's built bar. It's the Monday morning podcast and uh, eight gloomy, rainy, depressing Monday morning here in Los Angeles. Um, probably days or extra depressing out here because, uh, it's usually sunny and it's what you expect out here. See, look, I'm going to go into a Karen Carpenter songs, rainy days and monitored. Oh, Kathy down. Really? Is that a reason to stop eating? I don't think it is. Wow. Wow. I just started off real means did I well, well shit. Well, who gives a fuck? It's a gloomy Monday and uh, I attack a dead anorexic. How do you like that? That's how I started the Monday morning podcast. So there you go. If you're new to my page, um, I do one of these, um, every Monday morning, can I say Monday? Oh, did I say run day? Every Monday morning I do a podcast and a, evidently I attack some, uh, defenseless dead person.

Speaker 7:          00:35:56       That's how I started off. Only if it's overcast. If it was sunny, it would have, I would have a completely different vibe. But basically I do of these every Monday and I answer questions that some of my 14 listeners send in. Um, lately I've been giving out advice. People have been asking me advice and sometimes I ask questions and, uh, hopefully in the end of it, nobody learns anything. And you know you've wasted 15 minutes of your life. That's what I'm trying to do. And speaking of wasting 15 minutes of your life, I am actually sitting in my apartment, my little villa, and really made me sound like they had a pool. Boy, it didn't. My little villa here and I'm waiting for a plumber and you know, I don't want to judge the guy cause I never met him. But this motherfucker guy was supposed to be here at nine o'clock in the goddamn morning.

Speaker 7:          00:36:51       All right? It's two minutes past the hour of 10 o'clock now I don't know what time zone you live in, what world you're in, but in my little neck of the woods, 10 oh two. Now it's 10 oh three. It just turned on my cable box. It's fucking 10 oh three 10 or three is not nine o'clock and God damn it, I want some answers. Unburied a ball my hand up into a fist and fucking pounded on my coffee table like, uh, like some like that guy in the Spiderman comic books. Who's, who's the guy at the daily planet? Jamieson. Huh? With his fucking, it's such a weird way of going gray. Didn't he? Just the side of his head turned white all the way around and then on top it was jet black and he'd always be chomping on a fucking cigar. You know, just, I don't want to tack Stan Lee, but you know, it's really, you know, I got it.

Speaker 7:          00:37:43       He's the boss. All right. What am I doing? Okay. All right, let, let's, let's fucking get back to this. Let's get down to brass tacks here. Okay. Why am I waiting for a plumber? I'll tell you why I'm late for a plumber because for some reason my sink, when the water comes out lately, it's smells like swamp ass. Um, I don't know what it is. There's definitely a funk coming onto my sink and it's not coming out of the kitchen sink. So I've ruled out some sort of outside sources, obviously, you know, cause it was coming from the street, the main water line, I think every, it'd be fucking everything. It'd be coming out of everything right now. Do I have any plumber listeners out there? You know, can you help me out? Because evidently this fuck is not showing up. It's 10 oh four and he's still not here.

Speaker 7:          00:38:35       See, this is why the United States of America is starting to lag behind China and all of them I've had in China, when you call a plumber, 48 of them show up at fucking eight 58 begging. You don't need to have a wrench. You know what I mean? Somebody just fucking bites down the pipe and three other guys just start spinning the guy around, you know, but not in America. I got away for this motherfucker to show up. I'll tell you what sucks too is I don't know if they act stupid, but it just, that, that, that makes it hurt even more is when they can't figure out how to fix a sink. And then some guy comes up more mobile boom pole, you know, with his fucking ass hanging out, he knows how to fix it. That's why I've started to become handy. Okay. Because I actually sat down and I analyzed it the other day and you know, fixing a sink is not a gift.

Speaker 7:          00:39:27       You know what I'm saying? It's a skill. It's something you learned. Does inventing this sink. Okay. Or the toilet like that. That guy, uh, Eddie crapper but whatever his fucking name was, I know is his last name was crapper. Okay. Because of him, we don't have to shit outside. And what's what banks does he get his last name becomes slang for taking a dump. Tell me he didn't die. A bitter rich man. Jesus Christ. You know, some people man, it's just these, you know, they, they, they do such good and what do they get out of it? Huh?

Speaker 7:          00:40:02       Jesus Christ. I mean, I bet you and your last name was crapper to every female in that family could not wait to get married and just get away from that Goddamn last name. I mean, they probably took the first thing that came down the pike. That'd be a great thing to Google and go check out the amount of women with the last name crapper that married the first trucker that fucking fingered him on a fucking Tuesday night. Jesus Christ. Just cause they were shameful of them. Their maiden name, which probably led to some sort of child abuse and alcoholism. And that's probably another reason why it's 10 oh six in the fucking plumber still isn't here. I really hope he shows up halfway through this. Okay. Cause you guys have watched me give this guy a piece in my fucking mind. Then I won't curse either. So we can't leave.

Speaker 7:          00:40:49       What is he doing? What's he doing? Huh? He drive and you know he's got a van. Drew. You know if, if you're a carpenter you got to pick up. If you're, if you're a plumber, you got a van, you know, because in case it rains you can't have it go on the pipes and they get all rusted. I don't know why. What, what is he doing as he is the army navy store buying some more Dickies, you know, what do they trade their underwear for? Their Dickies. So they're fucking crack of their ass hanging out. 10 Oh seven okay. Anyways, yeah. So that's the deal I started, I started to learn how to fix shit. Okay. I fix the leaky faucet the other day, which is unbelievably easy. But it makes no goddamn sense. You fucking take the handle off and there's this, this little rubber stopper with this spring in there and that's all it is. You take it out and you stick the mother fucker back, pick a new one in there and magically it stops leaking. I don't get, it's not like it's in the pipe. I have no idea why it works, but it works. And I went on the Internet within three seconds I learned how to do it. Okay. My ass wasn't hanging out in the back of my pants and I didn't charge somebody fucking $200 and I was on time.

Speaker 7:          00:42:01       Damn motherfucker. Okay. So anyways, I do one of these things every single week and people ask me questions and I hype upcoming gigs, like the fact that I'm doing a, B and a this week I'm going to be at out of the same, he's in Chicago and uh, it's actually downtown Chicago on the 14th and 15th on the 16th I'll be in, in Saint Charles and on the 17th I'll be in Vernon hills, Illinois. And I got to tell you something I really, really enjoyed doing this Gig at, especially the downtown Chicago, this nice small, and I mean it looks like a walk in closet. The place is so small and uh, I dunno man. It's like an old school comedy club and all these old comedy photos, they just left them up for like two. I'll take a fucking museum. I loved the place and I always have great shows there.

Speaker 7:          00:42:53       So, and I'm going to the cubs game on the 15th Beignet be like my third or fourth time going to Wrigley field, you know. And here I am pitching about a plumber. I really ought to count my blessings here. Going to a fucking cubs game this week. Okay. And continuing on, on the 29th, May 29th through June 1st I'm making my triumphant return to New York City, Caroline's comedy club. Uh, I got a whole brand new, our last time I was out there. I take my, uh, my one hour comedy special, which I have information about that I will be giving out later on in this podcast. Uh, look at me. Look at me. Teasing it a little bit. Making you stick around. Huh? Don't roll your eyes at me. I know what I'm doing. I'm playing the fucking game. Uh, let's see what else we got here and then you go into June and I actually forgot about this date.

Speaker 7:          00:43:49       I thought I had a couple, a couple of weeks off after Caroline's, but evidently not. I'm going right back out to Raleigh, North Carolina. Good night's comedy club. How to fuck did I have a date there, man? I'm turning 40 on the 10th. I planned on coming home on the second, getting into the fetal position, doing some crunches and not eating any carbs until June 10th when I turned 40 goddamn years old. But now I have to fly across this country and go to Raleigh, North Carolina. The desolate, the frightening Raleigh, North Carolina. The what the fuck happened to the downtown area that, you know, it's a beautiful part of the, this, the of the state during the day. Raleigh, North Carolina downtown. I'm not talking about NC state, NC state, that that place is nice. I actually went there for two semesters in 87 88 and if you want to know why, I only went there for two semesters, go online and Google Bill Burrs, fucking NC state, uh, fucking transcript and you'll figure out why I left after that.

Speaker 7:          00:44:57       But the downtown area, that's one of those downtowns where, you know, he would tell at some point in the past, the history. It was, it was a place, it was hopping, it was jumping. They'll make a narrow moonshine down there. Right. And then you know what happened? You know what? I bet the Wa the dreaded Walmart. That's what happened. They built a Walmart. Then they, then they made a mall, the Crabtree mall. Is that what you guys go and the whole downtown area? Just, it's a fucking ghost town. Past six oh one in the evening and I'm just left down there by myself, downtown in the fucking hotel. I hate it. I need people around me. I'm a city person. Goddamn people all fucking leave. And then I'm down there and I got to go out and hail a cab and all that stuff is just homeless people. It's like that fucking, what did that movie, 28 days. That's what I feel like I'm in. I'm feeling I'm in a Zombie movie.

Speaker 7:          00:45:51       If you work in downtown Raleigh and you're going to go to one of my shows, why don't you hang out at work? Just work and go straight to the clubs. So when I walk out to get a cab, I can actually see another fucking human being that looks like they don't have hepatitis. All right. And uh, the next Gig I have coming up is June 19th through the 21st I'm going to be at the punchline in Atlanta. Uh, that's another one of my favorite comedy clubs that Xannies Caroline, good nights punchline in Atlanta. I like all of those clubs. I like all of them. They're just good clubs, good, clean fun. And I'm going to come in there with my potty mouth June 19th through the 21st and uh, I dunno, I've been to Atlanta a lot lately, so I'm hoping I'm going to start to build a following out there.

Speaker 7:          00:46:39       I always seem to get a good turnout and I got a whole nother new hour for you. You sons of bitches. And then after that you guys, you're on your own. Just go to my website. You can click on it right there. If you're looking at my myspace page, I manage. I imagine most of you are secretly listening to this and your cubicle and you've probably reduced the window. Is that what you did? And now you sitting there looking at what do you look at it in a cubicle? Huh? What are you looking at? A spreadsheet, some sort of counting thing with, with assets and liabilities and you're rubbing your chin as if you're not listening to me. Well that's good. You know what? I think that's a good thing you know you should do today is take a magnet runner right down in the back of your bosses hardware, not as hardware, his fucking hard drive.

Speaker 7:          00:47:26       That's what you do. And if he walks into the office right in the middle of you doing that, what you do is you smile. They've open smile, which causes his defense is to go down. And then you fling that magnet at him like a fucking Chinese star and you hit him right in the forehead. Now the great thing about knocking somebody out is, um, as far as I know, as far as my experience with getting knocked out, is you forget the previous three minutes. So as long as you fire that puck and magnet at him before the three minutes are up, he won't even remember what happened. But the key is, is to do it in a manner before he can be like, you know, yell your name and say, what are you doing in this office? You know, Jennifer fucking, whatever. I'm so bad at coming up with God.

Speaker 7:          00:48:17       Dammit, Jennifer, we'll go with Sullivan [inaudible] fucking basic name. That's why I can't write scripts. These stories are always good. But my fucking name, you know the hero's name, Joe Smith. William the worst. Um, it's, I can have a commit crime. Never could come up with a good alias. What's your name? Bob. Bob Was Avenue. All right. Robert, why did she get in the back of the fucking car? Man, I didn't do anything. All right, let's get on to the, uh, have I ever been arrested? Yes. Yes I have. Yes, I have. I innocent arrested, drinking and driving, uh, back in December of 1989 and if you'd like to hear more of the story, tune in next week, um, I'll wait a minute. What did I say? Oh, I know. That's right. I'm going to tell you guys when my DVD is coming out. Uh, but first we're going to answer some of the, some of the questions that people have asked me.

Speaker 7:          00:49:19       Um, here's a question I might've answered it before. Okay. Podcast question number one. A. This is how many, I have actually went into some old emails and I found a bunch of other ones so that I didn't get to. So who knows. Here we go. Question one eight bill, have you ever thought about going to Iraq to entertain the military? I served in the Gulf War and we liked having entertainers. Come see us. If you have a few have already gone. What was it like for you? You would fucking kill? Um, no I have not. I have not gone over there for the simple and the only way I would go over there is if I went through six weeks of boot camp first like you did. And you know, they gave, they taught me how to fucking kill somebody. You know what I'm saying? That's like not knowing how to swim and then doing a fucking, you know, entertain some people on a tugboat during, during choppy water.

Speaker 7:          00:50:14       You know what I mean? That to be honest with you, I would love to go to Iraq, but I'd love to go over there. And when it was fucking peaceful and experienced the culture over there when there are no insurgence and yeah, that's thing, you know what I mean? I know they fly into the fucking base and I'm surrounded by a bunch of marines and that type of shit. But you know, I just watched too many will Smith movies where he's the only guy left and I don't know how to fire a gun. So, uh, you know, I don't have that kind of boss like Bob Hope would go, you know, he went all over Vietnam with like a fucking golf bag and umbrella. I guess he never died. Right. Maybe that should be, uh, you know, but you know what? Chaos theory, I don't think he'd get killed on the base, but you know, I'd be one of those guys.

Speaker 7:          00:50:58       Yeah. Fucking, you know, the plane I was in would get shot and some of everyone in the plane would survive, but I fall out the bottom through the damn book. I'll entertain the troops. Okay. I've done it a bunch of times, but I've done it over here. I don't, I don't do away games. I'm like, Roger Clemens when he played for the Astros. Okay, I'm on steroids. I'm cheating on my wife and I don't fucking pitch in Iraq. I'll be honest with you, I'm terrified to go over there. There you go. Okay. That's why you were fucking marine and I'm a civilian and I respect you and uh, you know, I'll fucking, uh, you could listen to these podcasts and Iraq, you know what I mean? What am I, what am I fucking, Chuck Norris doesn't mean getting all defensive because I don't have the balls to go, but yeah, that's basically it.

Speaker 7:          00:51:46       Yeah. I don't want to go over there and then somehow get kidnapped and end up being, you know, rocking back and forth gently in an orange jumpsuit is there, you know, is there reading shit about our lot and then they saw my fucking head off and I'm really sitting there going like, you know what, why, why did I come over here? Um, okay, moving on. Question number one. That was one a. Okay. Uh, did you do a voice on grand theft auto four. There was a biker dude, that sounds just like you. If it wasn't you, you got to check it out. Actually yes I did. I did do a voiceover on that and it was a big thrill to do that and I got to give a big thanks to uh, to Laszlo for hooking me up and uh, Jimmy Norton for hooking me up with the OPN Anthony show.

Speaker 7:          00:52:32       Cause that's how I met Laszlo. And then I got in there to do the boys over. Um, see how that works. Uh, question number two, I noticed you have Strikeforce MMA in your top friends. I was wondering who are a couple of your favorite MMA fighters? Um, that's just a friend I accepted and then I guess they switched their picture. Mixed martial arts. Um, I dunno, I do watch the, I I watch, uh, what do I watch? I watch the UFC fights. I watch, I watched their reality show, which of course I can't remember the name of the ultimate fighter this, this season where they have to fight their way just to get into the house. And uh, what the fuck's his name there? The junk yard dog. I'm getting them fucking confused with old time wrestlers. Who's the guy who knocked out chuck light? Dell, the fucking guy who goes out and then kicks the shit out of you.

Speaker 7:          00:53:32       Where's the chain and Shit, you know, beats the fuck out of people. Randy Jackson. Yeah. And then the other guy with the fucking, you don't want to fuck with me. Cauliflower ears. You know, actually have a theory that if you just say you don't even need to get the black belt. If you just have some somebody's box your ears and you get those cauliflower ears, no one's going to fuck with you in a bar because they just look at those fucked up ears, those exploded vegetable ears and they're just like, that guy could fucking snap my neck. Choke me out and give me the superman punch with a flying knee all at the same fucking time. I even answer the question. Who are some of my favorite ones? Uh, I liked Matt Serra. I love the shit he talked about. Uh, and what's his face was Saint Pierre.

Speaker 7:          00:54:18       That's the kind of shape I would like to be in for my 40th birthday that evidently I'll be contemplating in downtown Raleigh, North Carolina. All right. You know what, this podcast is starting to seem long, so when we let me blow through these next fucking questions. All right. Number three, Bill, did you hook up with any of the stewardesses at the airport from last week's podcast? Oh yeah. I hooked up with all three of them and they, we had a fucking foursome right out in the open, you know, and that didn't violate any new fucking Patriot Act. Now I didn't. And um, thanks for bringing that up. Okay. I don't know. I was going to go off and say what's up to him, but there was something about their blue panty hose that just, I really found it intimidating. Question number four. I was wondering, since you're such a big, such a, a bug sports fan, a big sports fan, what is your best sports memory from your childhood?

Speaker 7:          00:55:08       Um, well fuck that. Let's go with something funnier then. Uh, how about, uh, he, his my best, my best? Fuck, he's a good sports memory. When the, uh, when the New England Patriots beat the, the Los Angeles Raiders, um, what was it, 1985 the year we get, we get destroyed in the Superbowl. We were a wildcard. And, uh, that's what we beat the jets. And then the next week we'd beat, look at me with a memory, beat the jets, and then we'd beat the Raiders. And I went down to the, the airport in Providence, Rhode Island and a, it was like me and like only 70 other people at this point, you know, and we met, have all the players as they got off the plane, all the old school guys, Julius Adams, I remember somebody reaching over and slamming him really hard on his shoulder, like hitting them way too hard. And he fucking looked at me like I did it.

Speaker 7:          00:56:04       And I was like, oh, I went to the mayor. It was the guy behind me. But, uh, that was the first time I saw a bunch of athletes up close. Uh, Tony Easten completely expressionless. I remember he was wearing a butterscotch members only jacket. I swear to God. Um, and he looked like he was on his way to home depot and right down I should have known that he was going to get crushed in the Superbowl. But, um, I would say that, you know what, Bruins Games, the first Bruins games and went to the Boston Garden. I used to always go to Bruins. Canadians actually went to that bench clearing brawl. If you go on a youtube, it's the one where Chris and island, uh, was that the game where he hit Rick Middleton and the teeth with this thick. And then as he was walking off, that's right. He walked off the ice and then he pushed dot 10 landsman who chased them down.

Speaker 7:          00:56:52       And next thing you know, there was a bench clearing brawl. And Terry O'reilly in his suit was grabbing onto somebody and never more quad. I was good. All right, I'm just babbling here. I'll just wait for my plumber. 10 23 motherfuckers still down here. Okay. Uh, wow. I'm getting bored with myself here in number five. Uh, what do you think of the comedy genre? Anti humor, like the type by Neil Hamburger and ted. I don't know those guys. I watched him and uh, they seem funny to me, you know, I dunno. It's not anti humor is it? I Dunno who gives a fuck. All right. Uh, so I was watching one of these in tool. Who's throwing food at you? I already answered that. That's a donut. It's a donut hole. If you see the video on my page was a group of people, they were a advertisers.

Speaker 7:          00:57:40       They all worked at the same place. I started trashing him and they threw a doughnut hole. Let me, and evidently I didn't give a fuck. Um, number seven, when you have these horrible thoughts about people, are you able to keep your face stoic, mine, wrinkles up and I don't notice until the person looks at me. If so, how do you play it off? Um, no, I'm usually cursing like what I think is under my breath, but out loud and then they look right at me. I literally walked through like an airport, go and look at this fucking guy. Fuck kind of shirt. Is that, and I think I'm kind of doing it in my head or whispering, but I'm saying it loud enough that they look right at me and then I look away, which is pretty pathetic. Okay. Which is, you know what this podcast is getting pathetic is way too long.

Speaker 7:          00:58:22       Let's get the thing. Okay. My DVD, the dog, the big announcement is going to be coming out in September of 2008 and the my DVD, my a one hour special will also be shown on comedy central in September of 2008. So I have all summer to write some, uh, to write some new jokes, which I already have already got a whole new hour. So, uh, all right. This podcast, I mean minutes is this. Yeah, this podcast is really fucking long and I didn't even get to half the shit I want to talk about. I want to tell you guys how I was back to drinking Budweiser. I've come full circle. I actually, I started off with Michelob light, then it quickly went to Budweiser and then throughout the years I switched to vodka. Then I ended up with fucking Johnny Walker Black and now I'm right back to Budweiser again.

Speaker 7:          00:59:15       And uh, I guess that was the moment at the Johnnie Walker black where I was supposed to admit that I had a problem and stop cold Turkey. But evidently I'm going to run the cycle all over again and go back and start dating some of the same psychos that I, I dated, you know what? Next week, I'll tell you the story about me getting arrested for drinking and driving back and fucking June, no, December of 1989 I was on my way back from Boston college to go watch the Patriots play fucking the Los Angeles Rams Cause I get season tickets. Who knew they were going to be five and 11? Um, anyways, so that's the pot, you know, it started off fucking, it started off strong. I was trashing the art of plumbing and a dead Karen Carpenter and then it just sort of tapered off. I, you know, and I don't want to happen, I shut up, fucking quit while I was ahead.

Speaker 7:          01:00:07       But anyways, thanks to everyone who listened to these podcasts, I really appreciate it. And, uh, he would actually, you know, something, if you enjoy my podcast, could you please let people know about them? Because, uh, you know, I burn up a lot of minutes every week on my fucking cell phone. I'm getting brain cancer and I'm talking to like 15 people. And um, I'd like to break 20. If I could get it up to 20 people before June 10th when I turned 40, that would make me feel a whole lot better. All right. So, uh, thanks to everybody who, uh, who has been listening and uh, sorry to all the Karen Carpenter fans, I'm sorry to people who are plumbers. Actually, you know what? I'm not sorry. Okay. I'm not fucking sorry, because one of your, I'll, I'll be sorry. When some you guys from the plumber's union have a little talking to, it's 10 20 fucking seven.

Speaker 7:          01:00:57       I started this podcast at 10 oh three. So there's a 24 minute podcast. I was hoping that the guy was going to walk in during the middle of it, and we could have a little reality show moment what he did. And you don't probably have when you first walked up, halfway through the stairs and hurt me bitching about fucking plumbers on my podcast. He didn't hear me talking to anybody, so he thought it was crazy, or I was berating my wife, my nonexistent wife. Oh God. Look at it. Boom. Look at the fucking gloom out the window. All right, that's it. So please come out and see me. Uh, Chicago would Zane, he's this week or Caroline's in New York City at the end of the month or at a good nights and Raleigh, North Carolina or the punchline in Atlanta, Georgia next month. All right. Your mother fuckers. I have a CD up on, uh, iTunes called emotionally unavailable, the expanded edition. Why don't you, uh, go there, buy it, buy for friend five for plumber. Fucking, uh, break the CD and half stab him and his juggler. He's late and that's it. That's the Monday morning podcast
