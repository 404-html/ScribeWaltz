Speaker 1:          00:00:02       Hey, what's going on? It's bill burn. It's time for the Thursday afternoon, just before Friday, Monday morning podcast and ah, Ooh, ee, just checking in. All mother bugging you, Lou. Um, uh, what's going on? I'm in the middle of this, this acting job. Ovi He, so I got to do this before they picked me up in the sad van. The Sad van that takes you to set for the excitement. That's the rules. If you're going to have that much fun pretending to be somebody else, right? Winning bar fights and all the shit you get to do as an actor, all the shit you can't do in real life. Um, then yeah, they got to pick you up in a sad van. The van is basically a bare bones, usually all white with the gray violin to just completely like, you know, four wheels powertrain. This will get you there.

Speaker 1:          00:00:56       I call it the said Finn. I don't know why. Um, but that is the one thing about it. Great thing about acting is you get to do all this shit that you don't get to do in real life. You know, which is what's kind of cracking me up lately about action movies is how, um, I don't know when exactly the action hero genre started, but I, I came up in the eighties, so you know, you had Stallone, Yay. Add Schwartzenegger you had John Claude van and then you had, um, Steven Seagal in each year. They try to, you know, Chuck Norris in each year. They just tried to fucking, Chuck Norris actually walked the line from like action hero in Karate Guy, right? He was somewhere between like Bruce Lee and, and uh, I don't know what, it's a fucking chuck Norris, I guess. Sorry, my brain is fried. We've been walking at work and long hours here.

Speaker 1:          00:01:48       Um, but anyways, those movies kind of already started off ridiculous. You know, we'd have 40 guys with machine guns and a guy would just fucking, there's one movie where I think it's Schwartzenegger, there's like 20 guys with machine guns shooting at them and there's all these potted plants and he just runs and kind of puts his hand up, you know, to guard his face from all the, uh, thousands of bullets that are coming at them. And somehow they miss him. He runs across this fucking foyer. I mean, they just kept getting more and more ridiculous, you know, all the way up to like a Steven Seagal. Well, he would, she would barely be moving and just beat the shit out of an entire bar. I love when they would throw a punch at his face and he would just sort of lean and just actually watch the fiscal passed his face.

Speaker 1:          00:02:38       Um, so now just when you think that, you know, and the dialogue was always really bad. So then what they did, you know what? No, they all went away because they just got so ridiculous. They kind of just start making action movies for a long fucking time. I think they did anyways. Um, I guess the born identities and those were action movies, whatever. All I know is that now they got the lady starring in a, and m for some reason, like I think just because people were so educated to how fucking stupid they were, they actually finally decided to start writing decent dialogue, you know, as opposed to all this shit. They gave a Stallone to be a go for a ride or what's his face? Schwartzenegger would rip off a steam pipe and throw it through someone's chest and then be like, let off some steam.

Speaker 1:          00:03:27       I mean, it was literally that bad. Don't wake my friend, he's dead tired, this really bad. Um, then they started actually writing scripts and a, I guess, yeah, I'd like the Bourne identity. And then you had the, uh, the other guy lock stock and for fucking, who's a wants this. And so now they've got the ladies are doing them and they're actually writing good scripts. But you know, it is kind of funny to watch a woman like beating the shit out of two fucking 400 pound guys. I mean, doesn't it get to the point where it's like, I don't give a fuck how much karate, you know, like I could just sit on you. Cause that's the latest one. The latest ones like atomic blonde and uh, they just got off take out of, pick smaller guys because it immediately takes me out of the movie like cheese, what the fuck's come on. Really. You know what I mean? It's bad ass. As those women are in the UFC, they still fight other women because you know, and there's still weight classes because at the end of the day, if you're tall enough and your fat enough, you can eat a lot of those punches.

Speaker 1:          00:04:42       Then you just, you just smother him. Remember that? Like when you're old brother, your older brother would sit on your chest and you be getting claustrophobic Ma like that. They could just do that to you and they would, they would win the, I gotta keep my voicemail. Um, yeah, they would just win the fucking fight. So, um, I'm not trying to be a party pooper here. I'm going to go see atomic blonde, but it is getting to, it's a common, you know what it is. It's a combination of those kinds of movies and then all those feminists tee shirts that I saw this week, that's really starting to fucking annoy me. It's like, do they think they're dumb enough that they're going to get into my fucking head with this shit? You know, I told you guys about that t shirt. I saw it, right? This woman was walking around with this t shirt. It said, um, uh, what is it said a, a a little boy. I got a strong woman's scares a little boy, but excites a man. Like what kind of guy would fall for that page one horseshit psychology. Like I'm going to be, or I want to be, I want to be considered a strong band. It's like, Hey lady, how about you say something fucking impressive that I already talked about this already on Monday. I can't remember. Anyways. Yeah. So why don't you fucking say something impressive, you know, instead of having your tee shirt and warm up the crowd.

Speaker 2:          00:06:01       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:06:03       I can't remember if I told you guys this already, but I wanted to make a t shirt that says a real woman isn't afraid to make her man a sandwich every once in a while just to get the looks. See that right there, ladies. That's exactly what we're talking about. What are you smiling about? Nia. You liked that one

Speaker 2:          00:06:20       in the same ole song again? Huh? He's in the same as long. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:06:24       My singing. What's same old song again?

Speaker 2:          00:06:25       Yes.

Speaker 1:          00:06:28       What is my same old song? Nia,

Speaker 2:          00:06:32       you're saying, well, Song

Speaker 3:          00:06:35       you say move women do is have in savings and never feeling he's still singing that same old. No, I don't know. That's what I'm saying. Old Man. That's not what I'm saying. Prehistoric cave man. Have you evolved at all in the time we've been together or are you just singing the same old song? Oh, if you'd let me finish, I heard everything that you said. All right. I heard you. So drastic tee shirt. Isn't a tee shirt a little ridiculous. I mean, if I had the male version of like, you know, a real woman would blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, a little, your take on it is actually very funny, but it's still, what were you talking about? You were talking about how, oh the, the women in the action films like beating up like big guys, but you're willing to suspend your disbelief that vin diesel can drive a car through.

Speaker 3:          00:07:23       Not One but two or three buildings. In fact. No worries. No, I'm not going to be fine. No, I'm not. And be like, Whoa, that was quite a ride or whatever it is that he said. No, it's stupid. No, it's absolutely stupid. They drive from one building to another fish tail before. Now it's completely stupid. I don't want shows movies. Right. So I'm just saying it was all action films. You got to suspend your disbelief a little bit. Daniel Craig can't beat up like 20 guys at one time. No. Been to the movie he does. No.

Speaker 1:          00:07:54       Yeah, but here's the thing. What they did was, what they did was they'd stay started in the 80s and it was immediately ridiculous. And the dialogue was horrific. So then what they did was they started to may have better dialogue and they actually have the guys get hurt a little bit with like, you know, fucking Bruce Willis had his bloody foot on the glass and his wife beater just kept getting dirty or dirty or, so they tried to make them real. But I'm just saying when I was watching that atomic blood, she's like beating the shit out of these two guys to like 260 pounds each. So skies. Yeah. Once they get their paws on you, I don't give a f if you, if somebody outweighs you by a hundred pounds, once they get the hands on, he is fucking over when there's two of them,

Speaker 3:          00:08:36       but it's a movie, so we go with it. Right. I know, but

Speaker 1:          00:08:41       it just gets too, there is a certain level, like me, there's a bunch of them. Like I never used to watch the Bourne identity just because the way they would edit it, I went to one of them, I swear to God on which set of seizure. Yeah. The editing was like, uh, uh, that was that, that one that uh, woody Harrelson did. Uh, the murderers of the boyfriend, girlfriend, murderers, natural born killers. Yeah. The way that was edited, it just, it was just like, you know, this is fucking, I can't, I can't watch this. Right. The quick cuts. Yeah, but that's what you're talking about. You so bombarded with images. I get it slowly edits down please. Right? Yeah. There was one, Matt Damon was like fighting a guy inside a bathroom and like his elbow would go back. They follow that it through the wall and then back to the guy's head. It's like Jesus fucking Christ. You know, if these NFL running backs are like, can't even move until Tuesday. The level of fighting that this guy would do on just like every six hours.

Speaker 3:          00:09:35       Oh my God. Wait, did you see that video? Speaking of NFL running backs of the ex NFL player who ran through that plate glass, that glass door and his wife thinks he's suffering from some, like, you know, post traumatic stress in his brain, it's called something CTE. Did you see that video? He know, but I'm trying not to laugh. He of literary sprints through a glass or when he doesn't remember doing it. Don't love it.

Speaker 1:          00:10:01       It is definitely sad, but that is fucking hilarious that he's just like walking into a dental office and all of a sudden he just, he is 60 49 boots. Blue, sad. I'm just fucking, how can run through it? No, that should there it's ruining their brains. Like, isn't that like what are they going to do? What are they going to do with, did he spike his wallet after he went through the window?

Speaker 3:          00:10:24       No, because it fell down after he crashed through the glass. As long as he just walked in with his wife and all of a sudden he just fucking mid conversation. He was talking to police or something about something. Maybe he was having some sort of episode and then he just took off and he ran right through this. Like Glassdoor. I got a grocery store. Is he black or white? Black.

Speaker 1:          00:10:48       All right. He's talking to the cops. Yeah. There's probably some shit from his childhood. You can't blame the NFL. I thought the cops don't treat you guys well.

Speaker 3:          00:10:53       He ran, he ran through a glass door and he doesn't remember doing it. So his wife was like, I think he's got, you know, his brain is all fucked up from playing football. So where are they going to do about that? Can they put more padding in the helmet or like how,

Speaker 1:          00:11:10       no, cause what happened, what it is is your brain sits and fluid. So it's going to take some fucking like crazy brainiac to have like something that somehow keeps your brain stationary. The helmet fucking moves, but your head doesn't see, your brain doesn't smash against it. I mean, personally, if I was Oj Simpson's lawyer back in 1994 that's what I would've said. I would've said, oh, Jay suffers from CTE. He had been watching the cooking channel or this Ginsu knife commercial and he just got a little confused. Right. Well, whatever you would of Ron Goldman looked like Vince Ferragamo and he never liked the ramps. I mean, that's the best I could've come up with. Sure, sure. Well, it's a comedy podcast. If he brings something up, what am I supposed to do? No, I'm laughing on the inside. It's an inner cry Bitch.

Speaker 1:          00:12:04       Yeah. Did you see that? You want to see, okay, now if we're going to just talk about horrible fucking things, did you see that, that fear, that carnival out there and I'm in Ohio with somebody one on one, like one of those tilt a world rides in the fucking thing snapped and all these poor people went flying through the year. One person died. This little girl was laying on the ground. It's one of the most horrific things I've ever seen. And then like investigators are looking in to see what the problem is. It's like, you know what the fucking problem is? They don't maintain those things. I used to, uh, I used to go to that a, I don't want to, I don't get in trouble here.

Speaker 4:          00:12:41       Uh,

Speaker 1:          00:12:43       it rhymes with seven and a homophobic slur.

Speaker 4:          00:12:48       No, no.

Speaker 1:          00:12:49       I should say I'm going to do one, six homophobic slurs a lot. You don't know that one. You used to go to a what? Where you weigh, what is it? What is a was the country wave. Yeah. Oh yes, yes. So I went there and so I went there, seven banners, banners for seven brothers. Why can't you say where it was you think they're going to like not want to? I mean it happened. I was at the one that rhymes with a ring wield massive two sets and um, I got, uh, I was, I was on the roller coaster right. And we got off it and the time it took us to stand in line and the ride next to us, we lined up, you know, line moved twice. We just heard Bam. And the rollercoaster that was ending the ride did not stop and rear ended the ride in front of it.

Speaker 1:          00:13:51       And this woman broke her cheekbone. Do you remember the time we went to that other one that rhymes with the six homophobic slurs out in a new war Z and we were, we were in that, that superman roller coaster and we, we got like, we were waiting to get off it and then it would move and then we was stuck in those. Yeah, it was really horrific. How many minutes? 30 minutes. No, it wasn't 30 he was probably like four minutes. Five minutes, 30 minutes. It might've been like 10 but I was sitting there and I felt you starting to freak out and I was like, well, if I wanted to I could wiggle my way out of this and the second I couldn't move. All of a sudden I started feeling shortness of breath and I was like, hold it together. Bill holds it together. I believe we actually went to that place. I assume that was my idea. I don't think you would ever suggest going to a theme park as a date. It didn't you weren't you? The one that taught me that macaroni and cheese is not a main dish. Yes, I was. I'm, I'm this weird combination of, you know, professional white collars in white trash. Oh yeah. We weren't good with money.

Speaker 1:          00:14:54       That was a period we were not good at money, so we used to have a tray and macaroni cheese with toast. Yeah, that's fun. Male. That's fucking delicious. The craft frozen. You just throw it in there. God, how dare you. White people go the anime, macaroni and cheese. It's pasta. It's from Italians, so you can only take 50% of the credit. Italians would be offended that you use Kraft macaroni and cheese. Wait a minute at do they make macaroni and cheese? That's not their thing yet is macaroni and cheese. That's one of the, you meet an Italian. That's one of the first things that they say when they meet him. Now he wants a go wrong. Maybe it's big ship, but beef on toast. Now remember when you get Alec King? I made fun of me because I was like making a jet. We went out to dinner the other night and I was sort of like lovingly doing this kind of like know your worth and now it was because, because we were in, okay.

Speaker 1:          00:15:48       First of all, when I'm on my podcast and I'm just being silly now, if you did what you did in little Italy the other night in the, in this apartment, I would have laughed. We were sitting there, right? I took near to where we got this restaurant. When I first met my lovely wife, I took her to like 10 years ago. Right. So I'm trying like all day going, yeah. Saying let's whatever it saint, let's fucking go there. She's like, Ooh, I want to go to the stone cold creamery and fucking uh, what's that other stupid burger place that everybody eats? Like it's crack. What? Shake shack. Shake shack. Like this day I want to go to shake shack over this. Anyway, whatever. Just tell the story. We'd go and she wanted to go to some shiny place and I wanted to go to the fucking old school home style.

Speaker 1:          00:16:32       You know, you order like chicken parm is Sean. It's like, is that it does that, uh, how long did you hammer this? That this is only one chicken breast. This is like nine chicken breasts. And then you fucking plow your way through it. You wish you didn't need it, but it was delicious. So we go there and they're playing all this Italian music, right? They got Dana on where the moon hits your eye, like a big pizza applied at so more the Nia does, you know that thing that you know in Hollywood movies, one of the Italian like something when he puts his thumb between his index and his middle finger brings them together with both hands, like going back and forth, back and forth like that. So good a pizza sauce. So the songs on and Nia starts doing that at the table, sticking her bottom lip.

Speaker 1:          00:17:16       Other key, you'll book a little book, but like in a fun wags and bouncing lot of the music they were playing. I had to do that, Dah, Dah, Dah, Dah. And I was like, you know, I was just doing the whole, and I said, what if we were up in Harlem and some soulful restaurant? Okay. And they started playing some fucking RB or whatever the fuck you guys are listening to. And I started to doing a bad version of some break dance and shit sticking my bottom lip out. You'd be like, if you don't stop fucking doing that and you're sitting there with a white man, Nia Huh? What do you think when you think would happen? I was saying just show, hey, it was out of respect. You though was culturally insensitive of me to do that. I didn't give a shit. I thought it was funny, but I didn't need the waiters.

Speaker 1:          00:17:55       We still hadn't gotten all of our foods so I didn't need you fucking with our food less. Then they had the whole rack of glasses and stuff like right by the window. Like right behind me. We were sitting, I mean come on. Can I ask you a question if I took you to Chinatown was delicious though by the way. Delicious. Delish delish now if I took it again, delete if I took you to Chinatown. Okay. And they were playing the, you know what it did that, that, that, that that day we went in because apparently that's offensive. Okay. We started playing high. Yo, Yo, Yo, Yo, Yo, Yo, Yo know if you were a, if they started playing some company, was Kung Fu fighting, would you, what would you, what would you be doing? I go start doing, everybody was calm and it will be offensive be yeah, right. I mean, I don't know. I wasn't, I really wasn't not, I'm not trying to be political correct guy. I'm just trying to get people not to spit in my food.

Speaker 1:          00:18:54       That's all I'm trying to do it. It wasn't like talking to the waiter like a by then bring me some fucking Vinnie Gabon. Ooh. Like I was trying to that shit. Like I was on the fucking Sopranos. I wasn't doing that. All right. I mean, your, your point is made. My point is not about being culturally sensitive. It's about Kevin people not fuck with your food. Okay. You want to do that on your own, your own time. You want to go on and get a Bagel and be like, oh, a VA with a lady, you're going to get an everything Bagel like you never had before, if you know what I mean. There. I mean everything. Is that a Matzoh ball there? Um, anyways, uh, you got to wrap this up,

Speaker 1:          00:19:43       right? I don't have to wrap it up cause I don't, I like that. I've only been doing 20 minutes. Oh, I got to read some are I got to read some, uh, advertising advertising some time, but I know I'm not supposed to because why aren't you supposed to? Because they want you to read the advertise. No one's no one's paying for me to read it. They want you to read it. Yeah. Everybody knows that. Why don't you have to bring that up? I know, but I'm just saying I want some weird woman thing trying to mind. Fuck me to get, yes, that's it. You to put it on a tee shirt. Yep.

Speaker 5:          00:20:12       [inaudible] Yup.

Speaker 1:          00:20:15       It's a great one. That chief, hold on me. The other night we were laying in bed and all the lights were out and we both tired and there's a lamp like across the room sitting there. She's like, how do you turn that lamp off?

Speaker 1:          00:20:26       And I'm like, I dunno Nia. You get up, you walk over and you turn it off. I'll show you. How dumb do you think I am? I am dumb. I'm not that dumb paint here.

Um, as bald as Charlie Brown, actually, he says at one curly cute thing and, uh, the sun was out tomorrow, the sun was out and I just, it was just fucking a Hot New York day and I didn't have my hat because I fucking worked out with my Nike hat and I needed one because, uh, I actually used to think you have, I'm so pacing. If I got a little bit of Sun that would be good. But it's bad. Yes, it's bad cause you come in and yeah, I come in red and they're like, what the fuck do we do with this? Uh, so I had to put a hat on so I didn't fuck up my Cynthia Nixon acts acting gig here. And uh, so you know, all they have this time of year is they just have all these New York City had some down in the village. So I was in a bind and they didn't have a mirror and I bought it. And it's like literally, you know those, you know those shirts. Jay Leno, where's with the gene? Gene gets like, yeah,

Speaker 7:          00:32:31       it denim, it's a denim hat. It's in a mat. Oh, New York City hat. It, it's the kind of had that a white Midwestern mom would wear. Be like, Ooh, I gotta I gotta I got a hat from, from New York City, let kids, I got a hat, like a baseball hat. Like you guys have. Like, that's exactly what this is. That is

Speaker 1:          00:32:49       the woman on set was making fun of it. I said, how awful it was this. And she goes, it's pretty awful. I go look at this cool t shirt. My wife bought me. I go and I just ruined it with his hat. And she goes pretty much like she was giving me no day. Like she wasn't, there was no out. Nothing.

Speaker 8:          00:33:24       bye but is no longer here, but they'll never be forgotten.

Speaker 9:          00:33:51       Fun to give it a nine. The Shah Ooze Harley started carefully from becoming something that then

Speaker 8:          00:34:07       stay.

Speaker 3:          00:34:42       Hey, you know what people wanted me to talk about Jay z and salon. Oh, the elevator fight. Uh, whatever the hell are fucking name. That's her name. I'm sick of Jay z wearing that. Roger Moore Tuxedo. We get it. You're fucking cool enough already. It's Tom Ford. Oh, is that what that is? Yeah. I don't fucking know. I always forget at this point. Jay Z so famous. You forget he's from Brooklyn and he fucking grew up in a street corner. It can still beat the shit out of you. You know, although him with his shirt off, you know, I dunno. He's definitely a businessman either. Yeah, exactly. He's fine dining. He's eating like steak and wine and like what songs? He is not keen. 90 exits. I can tell you this doesn't need to do all. He's got the gift of Gab. He doesn't need to do all it doesn't, it doesn't. You know what, I've, I've had enough arguments that people, God bless him and his Roger Moore Tuxedo. Did you talk the elevator fight? Have you cut? I'll talk about it. Oh, I'll talk about it. Write down all day.

Speaker 3:          00:35:46       I thought Jay Z, regardless of whatever the fuck he said that set her off showed unbelievable restraint. Okay. Getting kicked by a woman in high heels. Shoes. I've been there. Okay. That five fucking hurts. And he kept taking it to the hands and there was a moment at one, I only watched it once. There was a time, like one of the last times she hit him, she even flinched cause she was like, yeah, at this point he decided deserve to get punched in the face. You see her flinch, she's spit at him. That was what, it was really awful. That's what I forgot to do to that driver this morning. That would have been clowning bitch, move. I never do that. No, no, no. But you know, their family has problems like anybody else's family. I feel like if anything, it just, you know, it just goes to show you that you shouldn't feel bad when you know your uncles or whatever, start screaming at each other over thanksgiving. That is funny though, when you really think about how many people are tour judging them. Actually there's footage that exists somewhere of their family fighting in an elevator. It's just they're not famous and nobody cares.

Speaker 3:          00:36:57       It just gets taped over. I feel like a lot of, there are a lot more like physical fights that happen in families between siblings and stuff that most people wouldn't want to admit. You know? So I, I, I really don't think it's that big of a deal. I was watching it like salons stop. No, he definitely said something fucked up because Beyonce did do anything. She, she was, she was standing at with her sister. She was probably like, well that's what happens when you say x, Y, and z. That was her vibe. Uh, yeah. So, but I, it's not that big of a deal. I don't feel like, you know. No, that's kind of a big no, that's a tough, that's that's it's over. Their relationship is fucking over and if money wasn't involved, whose relationship? Jay Z's and the fucking large, yeah, those side kick there.

Speaker 3:          00:37:48       She's not, yeah, she is. Come on. She's frank. Frank Stallone. No, no. She has a really good album and I love her music and she has great style. No, she thought was famous as Beyonce obviously and all these dumb ass Internet people on Twitter like I've never even heard of her until knows. You should be thankful she got any classes. This is my theory. Don't know music beyond what's on your top 40 radio station. Hey, play in the morning while you're going to work. Doesn't mean that this person isn't talented. No, I just get annoyed with that is first of vegans down the music level.

Speaker 3:          00:38:24       This is the deal. The only way she can make it as if she's in the same group is Beyonce because that's the way it fucking works. There's no way. Never in the history of two people in the same family trying to be as solo artists. Have they ever made it? They always, you gotta beat together the Everly brothers, the Jackson five, the Osmonds. And then what happens is somebody breaks out of it and then the rest of them go back to the dinner table going, I have an album out to whenever. He's like, yeah, we don't care. I know I'm your mother. I don't care. Michael is special. Donny and Marie are the best. They're younger than you. They're shooter than you. And Jesus likes them better. And that's what happens and you're fucked. So the only move she had was when Beyonce was on the way up.

Speaker 3:          00:39:17       She should have been a Destiny's child. Look at me, look at me on the other side of the fence. Just calling off groups here. Well, she was, well, she in that group, she was like, I thought it was Kim Coles and a that chick from, uh, from uh, uh, one of the roller skates. Tootie, wasn't she? That it is his name and black people now? Yeah. Um, no, she was like a backup dancer. She went on tour with them when she was younger. She had an album when she was younger. She got pregnant. She moved up to like I was Oklahoma as a backup dancer. I was remember that Ac DC, that ACDC video. Who made who when I had all the Angus is up there. I always was one of the Angus. She also, she also, I didn't really people I didn't know. I wish I did.

Speaker 3:          00:40:02       Hey, she also wrote quite a few of Beyonce songs and like call wrote some of destiny tryouts on too, so you know she's, she's got other talents, things you know, she doesn't need to be as famous like that chick and I say, hey, when did Barry no, that's what's going on. Her name is Linda. No it isn't. It is it called Jessica? It's not, you know I'm right. I don't know what her name is. Four non blondes lead singer Linda Perry recently married to Sarah Gilbert from Roseanne. Did you know that you could play Darlene? They're, they're married. The last time I saw her, Linda Perry, not the last time like I see her, but I saw her blonde chick. Isn't she like fuck, she's got to be my age probably. What's she going around with that little girl for? What are you talking about? Sarah Gilbert is older than I am. I saw the show the other day. She's like 12th that's cause she looks great. Like I was watching the fucking TV show bombing all over the place.

Speaker 8:          00:41:10       Ooh.

Speaker 9:          00:41:31       Yeah.

Speaker 8:          00:41:31       Wow.

Speaker 10:         00:41:53       Hey, what's going on? It's bill burr and it is the Monday morning podcast. Monday, July 27th, two south 2009 2000 2009 and uh, uh, the year of the current on, if I can never remember what year it is and the Chinese knew it's the, is it the year of the pig? I think it is the year of the pig, isn't it? I saw a thing the other night where you know that those shows where they have people, they flip houses, they buy some dilapidated hunk of ship from some old lady who just died when she fucking passed out face first and her fucking dog food because it got damn bankers killed a formal referral. One K. Right. Do All people have 401ks? Did they have that back in the day when they went by in war bonds. I'm like, dog sleeping over there. Look at her. Fucking adorable.

Speaker 10:         00:42:50       Um, anyways, um, yeah, I was watching this thing. We know what they flipped. I hate those shows where they flip the houses because uh, you just see people getting completely fucked over. You get a couple of shitheads, they don't even know what they're doing. And then they go in there and they, uh, they go to Grossman's or, uh, what's some awful hardware store? Home Depot. They go down there and they buy a bunch of cheap tiles and then everybody walks in like, oh my God, it's beautiful. Look, look at the tile work. And it was like done by this fucking accountant. You know, I hate to, they know this old house. Like it's, that guy gave a shit about the house. Now they'd say they should just, they just showing people getting fucked over. I can't stand that when people walk in and then they think that the place looks amazing because they changed the brown paint to read and that opens the room up or whatever.

Speaker 10:         00:43:42       Fucking mind trick they used and it's still the exact same piece of shit house. And these guys sell it to these fucking morons for an extra 40 grand when all they had to do was buy a bucket of paint. You know? You know what that reminds me of? I hate those commercials now where they're trying to make it seem like fast food is at the level of a five star restaurant and they get these white trash fucking idiots, and they just see a tablecloth and some cloth napkin. And then they bring in some pizza hut and they're eating their pasta. Have you seen that commercial? And that girl was like, oh my God, it's so decadent. Who the fuck uses that word when they're talking about pasta? It's decorated. You know? It's like, did you just want to use that word? You dumb fuck. And then they come in and they're like, oh, it's pizza.

Speaker 10:         00:44:35       It's pizza. Oh my God. Again, I believe that I eat dead. She and every week, you know, always tasted like shit, but now these fucking cloth napkins. Oh my God, he's so fucking jaggedy. And they're breeding and they're breathing. They're not using condoms and they're eating pasta. I mean, how, you know, the, and I like how, um, all these other fucking fast food places are acting like they into, they invented these mini burgers. You know what I mean? Like white castle doesn't exist. I'm really waiting for white castle to sue a jack in the box or write any one of these other places. These, these guys who come up and they call him sliders. And evidently it's, it's not as fattening because rather than eating one burger, they take a burger and they cut it into three little ones. But because of their little, even though you're eating the exact same amount of fucking Burger, you know, somehow it's, it's, it's less fattening.

Speaker 10:         00:45:36       I Dunno. Yeah. I mean, it's so much what I just said is, you know, obviously just not even research, but you know, I, I, you know, I just eat, I, that fucking lady using the word decadent just really annoys me. You know what annoys me even more? I can't even give you a fuck a definition for it. What does it, extravagant. Is that what it means or is that Latin for, oh my God, I can't believe this. Shitty pasta tastes much better with cloth. Napkin says that. What the fuck it means? You know what? I'm going to look it up right now. I'm looking up right now because I'm gonna set you guys up with what this, this, this week is going to be all about. This is going to be, there's a lot of information, not information this week. Um, that's going to become an a, how the fuck you spelled decadent.

Speaker 3:          00:46:13       D. E. C. Deca a, another. A deca. No. D C. A dent. Deka Dent.

Speaker 10:         00:46:25       Oh, Jesus Christ. I wasn't even close. Was it

Speaker 3:          00:46:28       d e c? A. D. E. N. T. Wow.

Speaker 10:         00:46:32       Fuck. I got it. Holy Shit. All right. Decadence. Let's go to Wikipedia. God knows they're fucking credible. Um, decadence. Kimra. For to a personal trait or to the state of society or a segment of it. Use to describe a person's lifestyle.

Speaker 11:         00:46:52       MMM.

Speaker 10:         00:46:54       It describes the fuck happened. Just it a goddamn computer. Users grab a person's lifestyle. It describes a lack of moral and intellectual discipline. Well, there's a fucking left turn. Oh, no way. Yeah. Wait a second now. That's, I guess gotta be right. Nice. Am I going to question these people? I'm a moron. Bill. Why don't you just read it and shut the fuck up. Alright, I will. All right. Used to describe a person's lifestyle. It describes a lack of moral and intellectual discipline or in the Oxford Dictionary, a luxurious self indulgence.

Speaker 11:         00:47:29       Okay.

Speaker 10:         00:47:30       You, you know who the fuck describes pasta is a luxurious self indulgent, you know some, you know who does some stupid white trash conduits fuckin macaroni and cheese six days a week and all of a sudden you bring her a little fucking CD and he, you know, she can't, she can't believe it. Oh my God, it's the deck. And she was actually, that was an insecure comment. They probably had an extra couple of forks there and she started to panic. You know what I mean? Just like Jodie foster when she's talking to that dude and silence of the lambs and he can tell us that she, she grew up dirt poor because of her shoes. Right. You know, that's all the end of that commercial needed was somebody saying, I can smell your cunt. That would have been, that would have been all right. You know, I'm really being crude right now and I apologize, especially after last week, that video they told all you guys to see.

Speaker 10:         00:48:19       I got a lot of, I've got a lot of feedback about that one about what a ignorant moron I am and I'll be reading those a little bit later. Look at me foreshadowing here. He liked that. Like I'm on a God damn radio station. Um, all right, let's get to some mom. If you're new to this podcast, I do one of these every week and this is basically what it is. All right. If you think it's going to get better, like I'm building to something, I'm not, this is pretty much, I'm going to flat line the whole week and I feel like I have internal hiccups right now. You know those hiccups where you start to hiccup but then you don't? Huh? Am I doing an eighties bit again?

Speaker 12:         00:48:53       What's the deal with internal here goes,

Speaker 10:         00:48:56       um, great.

Speaker 12:         00:48:58       It's like a fork. Doesn't know where to go.

Speaker 10:         00:49:01       Oh God, I'd love to fucking do standup in the 80s. It was so much easier, wasn't it? One week you're an accountant, the next minute you're on comic strip live wearing the same blazer that you wore when you were doing somebody's taxes, except you just fucking pull the sleeves up and everything was funny back then. All right. Uh, let's get onto some shit here. Uh, Bill, just for your information, the guy, the wrap you were trying to talk about last neat, nice week is it's pronounced, I still can't say it's Quali. I never heard anybody say it to Lib. Quali coyly and I'm fucking notice name is quietly, I mean I listen to someone's rap, you know, I like about the guy, he doesn't say his fucking name every three seconds and the one time when I need somebody to do it, he doesn't do it. And I still don't know how to say it.

Speaker 10:         00:49:50       Sky Spelled the qua. How'd he say? Is that choir? Quasi right. That's how you said so quiet quietly to Lib. Quali ah, this is fucking pathetic one. Want to do alright. You know. Alright, plowing ahead here. Um, here's one that somebody actually was going to have, uh, for another segment, but this seemed more like a ask bill. Uh, here's two things I'd love to hear your opinion on drugs and double dates. Um, yes, this guy wants to hear my opinions on double dates in this. Actually, I think this is more of an ask bill kind of question. So he says, long story short, I met the hottest chick ever at a club. Dude. I met Ohad is fucking chick ever and names fucking Stacy. Um, I get a number one. Read this all like, come a fucking knasis's back in the day and Kenmore square doors go down and fucking nasty.

Speaker 10:         00:50:42       This is with our fucking z cavalry. Ricci's dude, fucking go down there, get a couple of rule fees. Drop him in a fucking Zima dude. Fucking cock sucker. All right, long story short, me and the hottest chick ever ran a club. I get her number, we talk, we, I ask her out, she changes it. Okay. Ask her out. And then, then she changes it to a double date with her sister. So I go out on this double day to an extremely expensive restaurant. I'm 22 in college broke. I drop $140 on her. Uh, the, the sister wouldn't let me out of her sight and all I got was one small kiss later on. I did not even get a kiss good night because the sister was watching. All right, dude. Now you really shouldn't be asking my opinion on double dating. What this is really about is how did you as a young man, 22, I'm going to cut you some slack here.

Speaker 10:         00:51:43       End Up in that situation. Okay? Don't walk away from this. Just go in like, you know what you wanted to do. Overrated. Underrated, overrated. Fucking, you know, double date and it's sucks. Now you should have right there, dude. You went when she tried to turn it into a double date right there. You just have to be, Nah, I don't want to do that. And she'll be like, why don't you want to do that? And you just feel, I don't like going on double dates. Why not? Because one person ends up not having a good time, and it's usually the other con that you bring. You can clean this up, this no. You know what I mean? You get your ski. Just just say it. I swear to God that's, you know when you're 22 you don't realize the power of no. All right. It actually seems like maybe you have some shit going on because at 22 most guys don't know how to talk to women.

Speaker 10:         00:52:34       So all women here is yes, yes, yes. Especially if they're hot. They just keep fucking agreeing with them. So if you say no, all of a sudden it's, it's, it's kind of different. I mean, you could fuck it up, but at the end of the day, dude, you didn't get laid and you're out of 150 bucks. All right? Think about that moment when she said, let's turn. You were going to turn this into a double date. What did your internal voice say? Oh Great. Or did it say, fuck, this is going to suck. This is going to suck. I'm not going to be able to get along with this girl. Uh, you know Joe Pesci, I'm trying to fucking bang this broad over here. You know it's not going to go good. So right there you just got to watch. You just got to say no. I don't want to do a double date.

Speaker 10:         00:53:17       And she'll say why? And just say, cause I'm 22. What am I potsy we unhappy days. We going to go to inspiration point. You want to go out on a date with me? I don't Ya. At that point you bring a little anger into it and he kind of just show the side of your head and you don't really look at her. That'll get you. That'll get you a second tape. All right. That was fucking brutal. It was bad advice. I'm trying to tell you, dude, just don't fucking go on a double date. All right. They suck. You knew they suck. You knew before you even went on it, you knew what was going to suck. And if you're broke, don't take a girl someplace where you got to drop 140 bucks. You know, what did she do to deserve $140 meal? What? Cause she's hot like that some sort of accomplishment.

Speaker 10:         00:54:01       She was born that way. You know what you did is you basically took probably a nice girl and you just added another layer to the foundation of her just being an incredibly stuck up human being who doesn't have, who doesn't have to develop a personality. You know, look at me making all these judgments. But I think it's true. Just because you're hot doesn't mean you deserve $140 meal. If you're broke, dude, be honest with yourself with that chick was like a seven. You know, you'd probably take it a pizza hut for some fucking decadent pasta. So I don't know. Did I help you there? I got to stop doing these podcasts on Sunday cause I'm fucking jet lag from flying back to wherever the fuck I came from. I was actually working in Denver this weekend. I was at the comedy works. So I should take some time here to uh, uh, thank everyone who came out to see me.

Speaker 10:         00:54:54       The turnout in Denver was ridiculous and I actually flew in a day early and I got to do five minutes out at red rocks. And um, if you're not from Denver and you're not a fan of you to just go on youtube and just Google red rocks, it's fucking, it's one of the most amazing venues is basically an outdoor venue built into the side of a mountain and that youtube video. Speaking of that. Yeah, that's why I was trying to say that youtube video, I don't know what the fuck was called. Unforgettable fire. I don't know. What was it about? What was it about? What, what is you to sing about? They sing about breaking up with girls. Martin Luther King, and then they went through their irony stage, didn't they? Where are you? Where the big glasses and he just ain't just acted like everything was fucking surreal.

Speaker 10:         00:55:43       I don't know. Whatever it is. There's a video that they did way back in the day and he marches around like a f with a, with a fucking flag. Like he's in a, I don't know, like they're doing something. He playing like this military be get dead, dead, dead, dead, dead, dead, dead, dead, dead. And he comes my, I say an old fucking David spade bit. He starts chatting. No War. There you go. It's that video. Yeah. No, but we got it. It's not like they're a small fucking indie band. We knew 10 minutes ago when you started describing it. All right. All right. Sometimes they get a little carried away. I, uh, just reminds me of something. Can I have a falling out with somebody? Like two months ago, you ever have somebody, a friend of yours, just say something so fucking stupid that you don't want me to get angry and you just, you just have that moment like, wow, I can't be friends with this person anymore because they were fucking moron. No, you don't. What happens? Somebody, somebody does happen to me twice. One time somebody said, uh, they were talking about secretary at that horse and they were talking about all the whole, all the racist, the horse one in, in the end they went, what? An athlete. And uh, I don't know if that was it. I just could never look at them the same way. What an athlete.

Speaker 10:         00:57:07       You know, I, I don't, I just do. I have, you need to fucking go off on that. Do I need to explore? Can you tell him actually scrolling down, I'm trying to find something else. Somebody wrote a fucking question about that. This whole fucking podcasts, it's just falling apart. This is what you get. You know what? Maybe if I started charging for these things, I take them a little more seriously and we wouldn't have these long lulls. My dog's fast asleep from my monotone voice is no, there's no passion in this. What am I doing here with the fuck is it?

Speaker 10:         00:57:39       Oh, you know what? Fuck this podcast. Am I going to start over? I'm going to start, you know, I want to plow through. I can't, I can't start off with this is it. I got one take. This is like live television here. I'm just going to read everything in front of me. How about that? All right. Uh, Bill's listen to your podcast on July 20th you said, uh, the, that the youtube video. Tough talk in college. Girl was a must see a search forward. Oh yeah. That people kind of took it down. People took that one down. Um, and if you didn't see it, that people keep putting it back up. So just check every couple of days. Just look up search, tough talk and college girl, t, U F F and it's talking with the GE even though I don't pronounce my gs. Um, anyways, uh, here's one for ups.

Speaker 10:         00:58:20       My girlfriend and I were at the grocery store last night and all that they had opened where those self checkouts, this is the first time I was putting that situation because they usually always have at least one real lane open. Anyways, the place was fucking swamped and going to a real person to pay for the shit wasn't even an option. Uh, there were three fucking employees. It was just three fucking employees as standing there. I went up to the three fucks and I asked him if, uh, if they would open a real lane and they just told me that they were too short staffed, um, fucking horse shit. This guy says, he said, I thought to myself, uh, where is bill burr when you need them both do, what would I do other than just sit there and curse under my breath neck next to some fucking candy like you did fucking bullshit.

Speaker 10:         00:59:05       That's fucking bullshit. Um, so I got in line and I rang up my own shit, like a little pitch. Uh, I had no other option. What would you done in that situation? I would have done exactly what you did. I would have been hostile towards the three people there. I would have cursed under my breath and then I probably just would've fucking, you know, depending on how much I needed to shit, if I really didn't need this stuff, what I, what I would've done a what I would like to, you know what I'm doing right now? I'm doing that shit. You know, we're after something goes down and the guy tells you the story, then there's always that Douche bag. He goes, dude, you know what I would've done? You know what I would've done? Now that I have all the fucking information. Um, you know what you could do in the future is just say, oh, well then we are going to come back during the day when you have some people and then just leave your food there and let them put it back.

Speaker 10:         00:59:55       You know, dude, I told you this was going to fucking happen. They're understaffed. They're understaffed on purpose. That's phase two. Phase one was just to have like five or six fucking registers and give you three others. So all the fucking sheep look over the curiosity factor, what's going on. And then you had the other cashiers over there teaching them how to fucking use it. Now they've gotten beyond that. Now they're going into phase two. Okay? Phase two of the experiment. What happens if there's no, if there are no cashier people, how will the herd handle this? When should we do it? Well, we can't do it during the day. This fucking old people and their little motorcars riding around. Let's do it later on at night. Let's see how the drunk crowd handles it. Even if they don't like it, they won't fucking remember. At the very least.

Speaker 10:         01:00:43       They won't send any angry letters. I'm telling you, this is how the whole fucking thing is going to go. And somebody actually asked me in this, uh, this week asked me, they were curious as to what I thought about ATS. Um, yeah, I'm not against technology is if it makes my life like easier, like ATM at banks before, I don't know if you guys remember this, shipped it back in the day when there was no a tms, you know, Friday, five o'clock. If you didn't grab the cash you needed for the weekend, you were fucked. You couldn't get to you. My IC, they will be open for like 20 minutes on a Saturday. But uh, yeah, that was just be that, that their expression, the guys work in banker hours. He used to be open like nine to five. You can never even get your fucking money out.

Speaker 10:         01:01:29       So what I like about the ATM as at least I have access to my money. I don't mind that. And a lot of times it is easier to just throw it in there. So I don't give a fuck, you know, that one doesn't bug me and I understand the technology does replace some jobs. The reason why I can't stand this latest brand of automated shit is it's not an advancement. It doesn't make it easier. I just go up and do exactly what the cashier did and the bag person did, except I'm doing it for free. Now. If I walked up to the cashier machine, the automated thing and magically the fucking thing figured out what I owed and then suddenly it was all in a bag, I wouldn't give a shit. All right. I Dunno. People just hear what they want to hear. Like you make one comment about something. It's God who like technology, he's against penicillin. No I'm not. I'm not at vent gets advancement. I'm against fuck overs and those automated things in the grocery store and at the, at the parking garage, the automated park or fuck overs.

Speaker 13:         01:02:32       Yeah.

Speaker 10:         01:02:32       It doesn't make it quicker. It actually makes it longer and a lot of instances. And, uh, I'm just working for free. I'm working for free and I don't fucking like it. Okay. And that's the last time I'm fucking explaining it and I don't need any, you douchebags glue. They, we ain't got money origins. Dod Janie Wedge Quicker. You're a moron. Just fucking work for free. All right, here we go. Um, what are we going on to a, somebody sent me an email, said, hey bill, I just want to thank you. Thanks a bunch for teaching me about tinnitus. That ringing in the ear stuff I was talking about. I just turned 21. I had that shit as long as I can remember. Didn't know what it was a thought. It was just me, um, for anyone that has the problem and not sure what to do when I was younger, I used, uh, I left the TV on, that was a bad idea. After that I played, uh, mostly chill music, um, and my music collection and a 70 minute album or something like that. And now I just sorta put a fan on low speed and it keeps the ringing away. For those of you who don't have tonight is what he's saying is, is you put some sort of smaller, quieter noise in the background that drowns out the ringing in your ear and uh, actually do what you really should do is go see a doctor is what you're supposed to do. And um,

Speaker 13:         01:03:49       okay. Okay.

Speaker 10:         01:03:49       I Dunno. Um, that's, I think the case is of Tinnitus is going to go way up just because of like iPods. And when you go to clubs, how loud they play that fucking music. Um,

Speaker 10:         01:04:02       actually, you know, I actually bring ear plugs everywhere I go because I have such fucked up ears, at least I try to remember. But basically how it works is anything up to about 60 or 65 decibels, you're pretty much cool. And you can listen. Your ear can handle like are right around 60 decibels that say, ah, that's like how I'm talking right now. Regular conversation and you don't do any damage to your ears. Your ears can listen to it for, you know, all day and you don't do any damage. But what happens, I forget how the math works, but every time you move up 10 decibels, like 60 to 70 the timeframe that your ears can listen to that level of noise without doing permanent damage goes down really quickly. And I know some worry where when you start getting around 80 that starts getting dangerous and anything above 90 um, I mean I think like 90 listening to something at 90 minutes. Don't quote me on this. I forget. I used, I used to have this chart and only shit I tried to find on the Internet, but I couldn't. But anything around 90 decibels.

Speaker 13:         01:05:06       Yeah,

Speaker 10:         01:05:06       after like 15 minutes. And you can easily with an iPod go up to about a buck 10 15 minutes of listening to music. You do permanent damage to your hearing. And I know that sounds fucked up. It's just incremental. And you can't tell, I forget, I read all this shit. There's little hairs in there and when you blow it out yet the things get knocked down and then they slowly stand back up again and after a while they just don't get back up again. You just fucking like a boxer. They just lay in there and you go into clubs, man. And they have, they have those that fucking music up to like a buck 15, a buck 20. If he noticed the bouncers who worked there always heavier plugs for the most part. Um, I dunno, I suffer from tinnitus. You don't want it. It's horrific.

Speaker 10:         01:05:50       But um, if you have it, you should definitely go see a doctor. And I would always have earplugs on you just in case you know, you're hanging out, hey, check out this bar. And you'd go in there and I don't know why they play the music that fucking loud. I can tell if the, I guess if there's a Dj and there's dance of what I said, when you just walk into a bar and you haven't a couple of beers and he got to scream, I can't fucking stand that. I don't know. Maybe because I'm, maybe because I'm old. Who knows? All right, let's move on to the next section. You know, I'm just, I'm just reading shit this week. All right. I don't know why I forget what this is, but this section is named the accidental racist. All right. Uh, Hey, bill, I just downloaded a bunch of your uninformed shows on mini mini Nova and just began listening to the first one, a show from February 10th, 2007 I stopped at three minutes in to write you to thank you for delivering already the accidental racism to the Asian guy.

Speaker 10:         01:06:48       Oh, that's why this name, this I'm in the elevator story. It kind of reminded me of a sending [inaudible] funny thing that happened to me. All right. Just to get you guys caught up, I was going up with them in the elevator at the old, uh, XM building evidently on February 10th, 2007 and it was me and Joe de Rosa who do the show. And there was this Asian guy in the elevator and I can't remember what, but he seemed confused and uh, he was, I, I sometimes, I didn't know what floor he was on. Somehow I made the assumption that he was delivering food and I conveyed that to him and I was, yeah. Said something like, Oh, what are you delivering food? And he just put his head down and he goes, I work here.

Speaker 10:         01:07:37       And I felt like such a fucking asshole. But he just looked, he looked disheveled and he was dressed down and we did the show on a Saturday, so he wasn't dressed like he was going to work. It was just one of those things. Uh, if I could find the guy, I would apologize to them. But you know what I mean? There are a lot of Asian guys delivering food in, uh, in New York, you know, so, and they're always going up elevators and they always have that look of like, what fucking floor am I going to? I don't know the guy, I don't know. I don't what happened when we got an arc with his girlfriend. It's how I read it. So anyways, I felt like an asshole and I apologize. Uh, you know, for some reason he's listening to this podcast and be funny if he actually was a listener of my podcast and didn't realize that was me and now realizes it's me and now I've lost another listener.

Speaker 10:         01:08:29       Um, anyway, so this guy gets, has a story just like it. Um, so when he says anyways, um, my junior year in college I was looking for a roommate because some previous people I had lined up dropped out on me in the last minute. A girl I was friends with put me in touch with the guy she was friends with because, uh, he was looking for a place to, despite both of us having this girl's a mutual friend, we never met each other. Uh, we set everything up over the phone and came to terms we could both live with without ever even meeting in person. Um, thus the first time we would meet was at the place we would both be living in Jesus. Dude, you're really taking a risk there. Um, there are some things about me that are vital pieces of information in order for this story to make sense.

Speaker 10:         01:09:08       First of all, I'm black. However, due to the tone and the pitch of my voice, my usage of correct grammar, most of the time, um, you know, do it. If I said that I would really be in trouble. But you can trash your own people. Okay. So everything's good. Um, he said I was an English major, but I'm not an asshole about it, I promise. Correct Grammar, use correct grammar most of the time and the semi racist nature of most people. Uh, many people have told me that I sound white or could be mistaken for a white person over the phone. I'm going to address that point a little bit later. All right, so getting back to the story. When I talked to this kid over the phone, we found out, uh, we had both gone to the same high school for a year. Again, despite that this, we didn't know each other.

Speaker 10:         01:09:50       Um, the fact that this school was mostly white combined with the, the sounds of his voice, I thought he was white in my mind. Um, which set up this awesome situation. I figured he was guessing I was white for the same reason I was guessing. He was, I was really looking forward to seeing this white kid squirm when he pulled up and realize that was black. Of course, a black kid pulled up to the house looking for me and it was uh, my prospective roommate. I remember seeing a little bit of surprise look on his face and I said to him, he thought I was white, didn't you? And then of course my computer craps out. Uh, he smiled and admitted he did. Uh, I told him that I thought he was white as well. We both ended up having a great laugh about it and became pretty good friends afterwards.

Speaker 10:         01:10:35       Um, anyways, thanks for the podcast. Okay, let me, let me, uh, let me get back to that. Um, the semi racist nature of most people. Many people have told me that I sound white or could be mistaken for a white person over the phone for the life of me. I don't know why that is considered racist. Okay. I don't know if you've noticed, but like white people kind of talk in a certain way. I mean if you watch def def jam, we just talk in one way. But like, you know, there, there is, you know, if, I mean if I was on here and all of a sudden I was like, Yo, you know what I'm doing more fucking podcast is shit. He'd be like, why is bill trying to talk like he's some black dude from the ghetto? Wouldn't you? Would that be racist or you know, there's, there's nothing wrong with a, what the fuck am I trying to say here? If you just say somebody sounds white, you're not, you're not saying they're a a moron.

Speaker 10:         01:11:38       Right. Am I a fucking idiot here? I don't understand why I was saying, you know over the phone. Yeah. He sounded like a black guy or hey, you sounded white over the phone. Is it, does it go back to that correct grammar thing that the black person then assumes like, Oh, why? Because I didn't say mother fucker every five seconds. I know I do a brutal fucking impression, but is that why it is, that's actually an interesting question to say. Is this a great fucking podcast through my, my stupidity. You guys learned shit unless you already know it. Your role in your fucking eyes at that place. And you have to, if that's the case, go fuck yourself. All right. And then this guy also ends this email. He says, uh, what did he say here? Anyways, thanks to the podcast, they're awesome. And as a New York Yankees Fan, I want to thank the red sox for keeping first place warm for us. Good luck with David. I can't hit anymore. Now that steroids are banned or teas and Jason, we had to trade one of the best right handed hitters of all time for this nonthreatening white Gabe Bay for the rest of the summer. You know, you got a lot of balls as a Yankee fan bringing up steroids.

Speaker 10:         01:12:46       Okay, half your fucking team got busted. Do I really need to go through the names? A Rod, Sheffield, GMB, Clemens Pettitte. You're a fucking $200 million team and you're on steroids. Okay. At least our steroid guys. A fucking winning championships. Your bunch of cunts. No, I'm sorry. You want it 99 and 2000 with your steroid guys. You know, I, I love how he Yankee fans are talking to you got to $200 million team [inaudible] you're barely playing 600 baseball.

Speaker 10:         01:13:20       You know, that's like having a fucking Lamborghini and you're psyched. It's going 70 miles an hour. You guys should be playing like seven 20 ball with all those fucking guys you have. And you know what the funny thing is, you still don't have a bullpen so you're not gonna win shit this year. It's a joke. You know what? You guys do like a super group, you know, why don't you just sign fucking Ted Nugent to play. So play center field, you know, hey, we're just $122 million team that could, that's the best thing about Manny Ramirez going out to La is that it knocked our payroll way the fuck down. Now we're down to like 122 million. We're actually number four this year. People were behind the Yankees, the mets and uh, who was at the cubs or the Dodgers? I fuck him and have to Dodgers. Who the fuck was it?

Speaker 10:         01:14:07       Maybe the cubs. I don't know who it is. All I know is we're number, we're like 80 million less and this guy's all excited cause they're two, three games ahead of us even though you're oh and eight against the red sox and he got swept by the angels. What are y'all excited? Cause your feast and on the royals and the rangers and all that Shit. And Jason Bay is a great fucking baseball player and uh, he's done, been doing a great job for us and we've barely missed Manny. I hate to say it, I love the guy. And uh, just for the record, he didn't do steroids till he got to La. You know, dude, when did he get caught? He didn't got caught when he was in Boston that whole fucking time. All of a sudden he comes out to la, he starts running with the wrong crowd, you know, happens to the best of them when they come out here. Look at rape, the River Phoenix, he came out here, he did some roids. He fucking never got up again. Cute little actor. He was all right, here we go. Here's another thing. I don't know why I'm reading this, but I'm just going to read a dude. I can't believe you didn't notice that she, okay, wait a minute. Wait. Okay. Here we go.

Speaker 10:         01:15:17       Wait a minute. All right. What am I doing here? All right, this is, this is the response. One of the responses I got from that leg sweep video last week. And if you're new to my podcast, there's a video up on Youtube, I guess it got taken down where a, this, this guy hits on this girl. She doesn't, you know, she's not having it. So he gives a shit. She gives him the finger, he calls her a bitch. She throws a drink in his face and he goes up. You think he, you, he's going to blast her in the face and he just gives a leg or her a fucking leg sweep that uh, it should have been done in Mandalay Bay in Las Vegas was fucking tremendous. All right, here we go. So, uh, this, this woman wrote me, she goes, uh, Bill, I can't believe he didn't notice that she was visited with violent behavior first.

Speaker 10:         01:16:03       This is the girl in the video. Um, cause I was sitting there and saying, I thought the video was funny because the girl threw the drink in his face and even though he should never hit a woman, I just think that's outrageous in life to think that you can throw a drink in somebody's face. I just know if I did it within two seconds I would be on the ground getting fucking pummeled and uh, I dunno. There was just something funny about it. So anyways, she goes, I can't believe he didn't notice that she was visited with violent behavior first. Watch it again and you'll see him violently poke at her. All right. First of all, how fucking hilarious is that violently. Have you ever heard that expression in your life? Violently poked. There's no such thing as being violently poked. All right. It's called stab.

Speaker 10:         01:16:46       That's, you know, that's fine. I actually, my gym teacher used to violently poked me in the chest to fucking cock sucker. Um, he did and he gave her, he gave her a little fucking poke. He get one time to her fucking shoulder. That was it. He was just trying to ignore her. But anyway, she says, by the way, it's not very complimentary to a grown woman to be shown that he has a crush on her by punching her. He didn't punch, he didn't punch her. Anyway, she goes, I can't believe you're not allowing her to do the only thing she can toss a drink Adam, since she can't beat him up, do you honestly believe that her throwing the drink equals his, um, kick slash knocked to her on the skull? Shame on you, you bastard.

Speaker 10:         01:17:32       So I wrote her back. I said, I knew this would spark some debate. I respect your point of view on it. So here's mine violently poked 41 years on this planet and I have never heard someone being violently poked. Um, she threw the drink in his face because he called her a bitch and then she goes that cause she goes, that's right. I am a bitch. And then the drink his throne and throw in the drink in his face was not the only thing she could've done. She could have walked away. She could have talked to whoever was in charge at the pool. She could have talked to some of the guys who were over there, um, by her friends. There were a bunch of things she could have done, but she lost her. Cool. Um, and if you're going to define the action by the guy in the video as violently poking her, then you could also address, couldn't you also address the racial undertones of her giving the man the finger and stating, do you understand this and English?

Speaker 10:         01:18:22       The reason why the video is so funny is because the unexpected happened. He actually treated her the same way. He would have treated a man that threw a drink in his face. So the reason men find the video funny, I think is because the amount of times women get physical with us and there's nothing we can do except get punched, slap, or have a drink thrown in our face because we're never going to hit a woman and they know it. I had a girl try to punch me in the face and a bar and as I'm trying, as carefully as possible to defend against getting punched in the face, basically I'm turning my back and cover it up. Or is this girl wailed away? The bouncer comes flying over. And what do you think? Who Do you think they grabbed and tossed out? Um, I was in an argument with the female, but, so what people argue, but because of the way things are, she can take it to a physical level while I have to try and defend myself without getting physical with her at all, only to be dragged out by the neck.

Speaker 10:         01:19:14       Uh, you know, if they tossed her out too, I would have been fine with it. But because she's a female, she gets to throw punches, have me kicked out, and she gets to stay in the bar while they continue to serve or more drinks. So to go back to the video, um, that is the world. This warm woman is living in. I'm a girl. I can do this and nothing will happen. I could throw a full drink at someone's face and nothing will happen. Well, guess what? Something did the exact thing, same thing that would have happened to me. And then I go on to say, actually I would have been fucking punched repeatedly in the face and the dude's friends probably would have jumped into. And you know what the reaction from the others people at the pool would have been? Well, you threw a drink at his face.

Speaker 10:         01:19:52       What did you think was gonna Happen? And then I guess my excuse would have been, but he poked me violently. Um, anyways, I've never hit a woman. I don't advocate it, uh, that gain. The video is an animal and I wouldn't want any woman I cared about to ever date him. But the leg, the fucking leg sweep was genius and undeniably funny to me. I'm just going to read you all of these back and forth. So then she goes, you have no idea what women have women have to put up with. All right, this is where I guess I'm a moron. These guys take such personal offense when they're turned down, he should have walked away. I will not tolerate being touched by a stranger in that way, and it is really a really vulnerable feeling as a woman. It makes us angry and fearful of men.

Speaker 10:         01:20:35       Besides you didn't hear the things he was saying. Guys like that. Parentheses in hip hop style clothing are the sleaziest of scumbags licking their lips. Nasty. Who's hitting on you? Ll Cool j. Why don't you fucking go to a nicer place anyways, uh, as for the argument you had in the bar, you didn't specify. Now she's talking to me. This is classic line. Here she goes. As for the argument you had with that woman in the bar, you didn't specify what it was about, what it was about. And if you are yelling in her face, as you know, you probably were. Dot Dot, dot. More violent behavior. He see that. Let's stop right here. This is what I love about this type of shit. Anytime there's a group of people bitching about their situation. Nine Times out of 10 when they're bitching, they ended up doing the exact same thing to the person that they're bitching at, that they don't want done to them.

Speaker 10:         01:21:35       Look how you assume that immediately I'm getting hit. I'm not hitting her back. I'm getting hit and you're blaming me. I'm surprised you didn't ask me what I was wearing. Was I asking for anyways, you want to hear the story, sweetheart? This, this is basically, this is why this girl was punching me in the bar. All right, we're going back here about 10 years. I'm standing up now. I'm going to tell this story. My dog's looking at me. What's up? [inaudible] how you doing? Huh? You're a female. You can defend yourself. You fucking psycho. Um, this, this is what happened. I was in, I was in a bar and I was with somebody in mind. This group of girls is next to us. We're hitting on them. You know, we'll make jokes with joking around. You know, he tried to get women to laugh. That's what the fuck you have to do.

Speaker 10:         01:22:19       Women. I know you don't, you don't understand that because you don't have to make somebody want to fuck you. Okay. The same way, I don't know what it's like to have to carry a fucking living thing inside of me for nine months. I understand. We all have our advantages, so whatever, I'm not trying to be a Douche here, but this is basically, it's, so we're trying to, we know we're joking around or whatever. I had a couple of drinks, they had a couple of drinks and one of them was dressed like, she looked like Rhoda on Mary Tyler Moore. All right. So at one point that girl goes up and uh, she goes to go to the bathroom. So I say to a friend and go, Jesus Christ was she, she a big fan of Mary Tyler Moore or what? Right. Made a joke about what she was wearing. So another 20 minutes goes by, those girls Kinda peeled off, you know, we weren't really talking to them anymore.

Speaker 10:         01:23:01       We were, uh, well maybe we kind of were, I don't know what was going on. Sort of that type of shit. You're talking to a girl for a couple seconds, then it's not working out. So I went back, I was talking to my friend and I guess when the girl came back from the, from the bathroom, her friend told her what I said. So unbeknownst to me, so I'm sitting there talking to my buddy. Then all of a sudden they just hear this, this, this woman yelling, hey bitch, hey bitch. Right. So I look over and she's looking at me. She's going, hey bitch. And I'm, and I'm, I'm trying to process cause I, you know, typical may, I said some shit. I don't even remember what the fuck I said. And then she goes, you know, you're going to talk shit about me when I'm not around.

Speaker 10:         01:23:49       And then I, then I kind of was right as I'm putting it together. Then she stood up and she fucking put her hand over. You ever see like a, you ever see like a, a center in the NBA how they fight or they can't throw fake fucking throw punches like that. They're trying to fucking throw somebody out at second base. That's what she did. She winds up and she's about ready to come down on the top of my head. So you know, because she wound up, I mean if he fucking threw a jab, she would have fucking blasted me right in the face. And I got to admit that would've been fucking hilarious. But because she went up and over, I was able to get my arm up in time and I saw it. I sorta like cut her wrist. So now I instantly, I recognize the situation.

Speaker 10:         01:24:29       I'm like, oh fuck, okay this girl is not going to stop and I don't want to get hit in the face. I can't squeeze her risk too hard. All this shit's going through my head and I know, even though I can't see it, I know the bounces are on their way over and I know what the fuck's going to happen. So all I'm doing is holding her wrist as she's fucking client at my side. I'm sort of turned to the side and of course my buddies aren't doing anything. This sort of just looking at this point cause it happened so fast and I'm going, Whoa, Whoa, whoa. I was going, hey, hey, hey, I can't even, what I was saying, I was just, this just too much shit was going on. I, I couldn't, I couldn't formulate anything to say to get this girl to stop, but she just kept fucking bitch.

Speaker 10:         01:25:08       You fucking bitch. It was like punching me in the side and then the fucking bounce has come over and they fucking grabbed me. Of course, because I'm the guy. I just blew my mind. I, I'm fucking, I almost have my back turned to this girl with my hand up and she's wailing away and they immediately go to me and I get fucking tossed out, you know? So let me ask you this. In her world, was she justified for taking it to a physical level? Because I fucking made fun of her outfit. You know, that's was my point about that video. I don't think that you should hit a woman. Really. The reality of that video that I, that I watched, they're on youtube, is that they're both assholes and they're both stubborn. And what happened there is what you saw when you get two stubborn people who want to get the last word in.

Speaker 10:         01:25:58       Okay. He had on her, she tells him to go fuck himself. Not saying she literally said that, but she basically says no. So he couldn't handle it. So he probably, he starts it, I'll go, I'll give you that. He starts it. Okay. And he wants to get the last word in so she can't let them. Right. He should have walked away, but he did. That's you know, right in the beginning he didn't, so he gives her shit. Then she should have walked away. Realized he was a psycho. She'd had, she fucking gives them the finger than he should have walked away, but he doesn't, he pokes her. She should've walked away then, but she doesn't, she fucking throws a drink at his face. He should have fucking walked away. He doesn't, he fucking goes up and he likes sweeps her. It's just one of those deals, two fucking assholes who probably should be breeding and make a little fucking asshole kid.

Speaker 10:         01:26:43       And then we'll have another dog. The bounty hunter. Huh? You see how that math works out. So anyways, um, I, you know, I don't know. Sometimes I feel like I'm saying shit and people don't get what the fuck I'm talking about. I'm not saying that you should go around hitting a woman. I'm just saying, you know, guy, she never hit women, but women shouldn't take advantage of that by doing outrageous shit. Like throwing a drink in somebody's face that is fucking outrageous behavior. And be honest. As a female, if another female walked up to you and threw a drink in your face, what would you do? Huh? What would you do? Would you just go out with mature? Do you feel better about yourself? Is sprite is dripping down the fucking your bangs, whatever. Fucking you got that Rachel Bob Haircut from friends. Ah, look at me, look at me with that fucking check reference.

Speaker 10:         01:27:29       Um, whatever it gives a fuck. Anyways. All right, here's, here's some videos. So I actually was, I nominated that video for a video of the year and a, so people sent me some other videos and I'm really upset at myself because somebody sent me a great video of these two bullies attack in this guy with his girlfriend and his, the guy's girlfriend jumps in and she fucking blast this guy in the face in the end. It's a fucking awesome video. Um, so I really need that video so I can balance it out, Sarah. You know, so I don't just have videos of guys knock and women down because, uh, that's not what I'm trying to do here. You know what I mean? This is supposed to be a fun thing for everybody. And, uh, all right, so here you go. Here's some nominees. Uh, somebody, uh, ONA fan said a east freely was in, uh, was on the show this week celebrating Jim Norton's birthday.

Speaker 10:         01:28:21       Um, and he recommended a video called Winnebago man. I watched it and it's fucking hilarious. Um, Google how to spell when a, when a bag. I'm just going to tell you what the name of the videos are. Uh, there's another one, a guy with gun confronts skateboarder, and there's another one that says, uh, this is the last one. And I deliberately put this one last because this is more in the vein of last week's video. It says, guy gets revenge on girlfriend for headache. This one's really more silly and I'm actually jealous of like how perfectly this guy's prank works out. It's just, it's, it really is a work of art. And, uh, most females won't like it, but it's, you know, no one gets hurt in this one. Okay? Nobody's head hits concrete. Um, yeah, that's it. Okay. And if you're sick of those kinds of videos, there's one on there.

Speaker 10:         01:29:14       Have a little fucking golden retriever. Puppy howling. All right. Go Google that one. Okay. That'll make you fucking smile. All right, I'm going to have to wind this. Jesus Christ. 47 fucking minutes. All right, let me wind this up real quick. We're talking about grenades again, people the subject that just won't die. Uh, anyways, uh, Bill, I missed the last couple of podcasts. This is from a marine, so we can all hang out here, right? 47 minutes and let's support the troops and listen to the last few minutes of the podcast here. I missed the last few podcasts, but there was, um, there was a lot about the military. You seem to be interested in the military, Bubba, bubba. Oh, and I was a marine for four years and did my tour in the sandbox. Parentheses, Iraq. Go on Wikipedia and type in operation Phantom fury. Those are my credentials.

Speaker 10:         01:30:04       That kid you talked about on six 29 was kind of a joke. I can tell by what he says. So he's basically saying the other are there other military person who gave me my grenade information is uh, you know, I guess working in a mess hall. Look at me trying to start some shit. Look at me. Huh? Hey Guy from uh, June 29th, you're going to take that shit. He's saying you don't know about grenades. So anyways, he says fragrance aids have a kill radius of five meters. A casualty is 15 meters casualty. I guess that's, you know, shrapnel. Okay. Marines define, definitely use frags when necessary. They use flash bangs when doing raids. If you're using a flash bang and entering a room and you shoot blindly everywhere, it is totally contrary. It's a total contradiction to what you're doing in the first place. Trying not to kill everyone in the room.

Speaker 10:         01:31:00       If there's bad guys in there, you frag the fucks, I guess that she throw the grenade in there. And if you throw in one, you might as well throw in five grenades. Aren't that lethal? Well they are, but it just kinda depends. Two guys and another company tossed grenades into the, into our house from different directions only to have the grenades roll across the house, cross paths and in front of the other marine respectively. Jesus Christ. I think I saw this on the three stooges. Uh, they both dove away and Eileen and only received a minor shrapnel to the legs. Uh, more of something to laugh about more than anything. All right, so there's your grenade information. Here we go with earplugs. Getting back to the Tinnitus Shit. Um, went in some nasty shit. Basically when you're in battle, you have one ear plug in and one out, uh, due to the sound resistance created by plugs, it only allows you to hear a certain range of noise, take one out, and it allows you to hear the larger range of noise even after you can barely hear out of one year.

Speaker 10:         01:32:00       Dude, that's fucking insane. That's what I did. And, and it always worked. So basically you sacrifice one year. Did you switch off every other battle? You know, or did you just say, fuck my left ear? Um, I guess you need to do that because what if you have the ear plugs in and somebody's sneaking up behind you? Good God, thank God. Thank God I didn't have to do that. God bless Ya. Anyways, a machine gun next to an unprotected ear isn't that bad at all. Loud is explosions loud as airstrikes. Loud rockets loud is standing next to a tank and an ally and not having an ear plugs that concussion river reverberates and reckless Shay's along the walls and the of the buildings. Um, I know because it happened to me when, and my ears started to leak clear fluid, presumably, presumably from perforated eardrums. The sound was beyond sound. That's one of the greatest sentences I've ever read. As far as like fucking description. The sound was beyond sound. It was an impact. It felt like I was hit with a two by four across my entire body all at once. My face and my balls hurt.

Speaker 10:         01:33:10       Jesus Christ. That's from sound, I guess. I don't fucking know. Just shut up and read a bill. All right. Um, I had my one, I had my wind knocked out. Basically I was, I was almost even with the barrel of them, of the main tank gun and the fucking tankers, fucking guys in a tank never gave us a signal that they were going to shoot. Um, that's what it can because of a concussion blast feels like, and it gets worse the closer you get and the bigger the explosion is throwing some shrapnel and you get the idea. Jesus Christ, who this is better than the fucking history channel. I'm really enjoying this. All right. Um, and you talked about the stress of battle. There was one dude who was about to get out of an Aa v big armored vehicle and he went blind, I guess he's saying from the stress. And then he writes, just went blind. He regained his sight a few days later, but right before he got out, he literally had to turn around and say, ah, I can't fucking see Jesus Christ. Um, as for a funny story, Oh, you know what, that reminds me. How have you guys seen that movie? Uh, the fuck was that. I was going to tell you to watch that last week.

Speaker 10:         01:34:25       It was a, it was an animated movie about war. The fuck was it called? I just rented it. Waltz with waltz with Bashir. You guys see that? I def, I highly recommend that. That's about a guy who went to war. And when he came back, he couldn't fucking remember anything. So then he goes around and he talks to his former army buddies, you know, that's the whole hook. A guy who can't remember, goes around and talks to those who can't forget. It's pretty fucking pretty fucking amazing. So anyways, let me continue here. Um, and as far as for a funny story, um, in war the stories are all fucked up. It's all fucked up humor when you're over there like really sadistic fucked up shit. Even the nicest evangelist stick person or a Mormon, uh, we'll have the same humor over there. Personally, I found it hilarious when insurgents were so drugged up they would literally step out of an alley in front of a tank about 50 feet away and just start shooting an AK 47 at the thing.

Speaker 10:         01:35:29       The machine gun on the tank would slowly point towards the dude and just shred them. That's funny when you're over there. Wow. This is like time life books presents the Iraq war as it's going on. So let me ask you this. You saying the dude, so like hopped up on drugs like are a lot of the insurgents over there on drugs and why are they on drugs? Cause they're scared from the stress of the battle. I mean I can't, I can't imagine that anyway. It's probably the best story that normal people can relate to was when we first took over a centrally located compound within the city of Fallujah, um, referred to above his operation Phantom fury. Dude, you were in Fallujah. Holy Shit. All right, this is a great story by the way. So hang in there guys. I know this is long. Um, this was the third day of the assault on the city.

Speaker 10:         01:36:20       Obviously after three days a bunch of dudes are going to have to take a shit at some point. So we had to dig some trenches, the trenches. We're in the middle of a large courtyard about the size of a football field and instead of just standing over the trench like a dog and squatting to shit, we knew we had to find something to assist us when we dropped guts. Good Lord. Okay. I mean, fuck it. We're going to have to, if we're going to get popped while taking a shit, we better be comfortable. We started searching around and inside some of the side buildings we found some chairs and some wooden boxes. We cut holes in them and position them over the trenches. Um, the area wasn't, uh, what the military would deem as a, would not consider a secure at the time. But after eating the instant dehydrated shit meals called Mrs, which constipate you, uh, you having constant op operations for three days, we hadn't had a satisfying shit for three days after the new shitters were set up.

Speaker 10:         01:37:20       Guys were a little apprehensive to go out there as there were still RPGs mortars and gunfires directed towards our compound. You have to understand that marines and the marine corps, all right, this is, this is Kinda, this is him saying this shit, not me. You have to understand that the marines in the Marine Corps, uh, like are retarded. Many individuals are very, actually are very intelligent within the marines, but the Marine Corps just makes you into a retard and therefore the policies within the marine corps are retarded as well. The only thing the marine corps doesn't fuck up his combat, this retardation is why most people realist less with the Marine Corps than any other branch. Well, you have to expand on that. So anyways, so being the real retarded marines we were, we said, fuck it. A bunch of US strolled out and took off our kavlaars, our helmets and flax, bulletproof vests, as well as our blouses shirts.

Speaker 10:         01:38:15       Within two minutes there were 10 or 12 marine sitting in the middle of a bay, uh, middle of this field, bear his bones courtyard the size of a football field with only t shirts and trousers at the ankles, smoking butts, chewing, dip, joking around like we had a fucking Applebee's. While there were explosions and gunfire going off 150 meters away. Jesus Christ, it was Robert Duvall, a fucking surfing in the background. Actually. He didn't surf. He was on the beach. Anyways. Um, as we were sitting there, a few civilian reporters poke their heads out of the compound and went back in. They were looking to see in the proverbial coast to see if the proverbial coast was clear to the armored vehicle they were using for transport. So basically there was a bunch of reporters poking their heads out trying to get over to their fucking armored transport.

Speaker 10:         01:39:02       Mind you. This was the typical type of vehicle with the type of armor that our unit couldn't get at the time because ours kept getting fucked up and it was too much of a monetary drain to give us the proper protection because our B vehicles will get blown up every couple of weeks are in paraphrasing cause this is really fucking long. Um, these business, these people had no business being there and they knew it. This was evidenced by the fact that they continue to poke their heads out of doorways several more times. Apparently they got the carrot carriage up because all at once, the group of about 10 people who look like my seventh grade, a gym class started making their way to the armor armored vehicle in there. Gay Little Blue Helmets, invest that read press in big bold white letters. They were visibly nervous jogging mechanically and looking spastic Lee in every direction as if they would somehow be able to change their fate.

Speaker 10:         01:39:56       Infants, if an insurgent decided to lean out a window and opened fire at them as they jogged along, we sat there half naked from the bottom down and stared at them in utter amusement. After a few seconds of silence, someone shitting next to me screamed and comment. It was like a kick to the fucking nuts. Uh, something snapped. The reporters absolutely lost their shit. It was one of the most beautiful examples of Darwinism in action that I have ever witnessed. The strongest and fastest males threw themselves into the truck first, not far behind where they're smaller males. They were then followed by the most attractive females who were pulled almost instantly into the, into the truck. Um, in last where the wingman, wingman grenades helped in only by their, their own large legs. I don't get that last sentence. Uh, after they realized that they were actually, there was no actually incoming really butchering this, sorry, I'm seeing double at this point.

Speaker 10:         01:40:56       Uh, after they realize that there actually was no incoming, they slowly, she grossly turned to look over at us as we were sitting there with our balls flapping in the wind dirty as fuck while pushing out three days worth of compacted tar and having no business being happy in any way whatsoever. But we were absolutely all dying with laughter. We continue laughing as they drove by and we sat there smiling and waving at them wildly like what people do when a cruise ship leaves port. They stared at us and complete bewilderment and just simply started shaking their heads in a way a parent does when a small child gets a pair of new clothes covered in spaghetti and meat sauce. But we weren't kids and we definitely weren't dirty from eating spaghetti. Fucking classic. Dude, that's a great story and I apologize for butchering that thing. I suck at reading out loud. Um, anyways, this podcast has to be over a fucking hour at this point. Yeah, it just turned an hour. All right. Has been a really long podcast with a lot of information. Um, this has been the encyclopedia Britannica version of the Monday morning podcast. You guys all have a good week. I hope you enjoyed the stories. Forgive me for my awful reading

Speaker 1:          01:42:05       and uh, oh, let me hype a couple of gigs. I got coming up. I'm going to be at providence at the comedy connection in Providence, Rhode Island in August and the next week I will be at the punchline in Atlanta, Georgia. And after that, the final day, August 29th, I'm going to be in Stockholm, Sweden. So, uh, who the fuck is going to go to that nobody from Sweden

Speaker 10:         01:42:29       listen to this shit. So that's it. That's the Monday morning podcasts you want. If you want to know the exact dates, please go to my website. Uh, it's bill@billbird.com. B U R R in, please sign up for my mailing list.

Speaker 1:          01:42:41       Um, cause I'm really starting to lose my faith in my space. There's just nobody left on there. Like nobody fucking emails me anymore. So, um, and I don't want to join Facebook and I don't want to tweet. So I think I'm just going to basically maybe phase out my myspace page and I'm going to just start doing shit on my, uh, my website. Mainly. That's the plan. All right. You guys all have a great week.

Speaker 9:          01:43:07       [inaudible] [inaudible].
