Speaker 1:          00:00:01       Hey, what's going on? It's bill burr and it's the Monday morning podcast for Monday, January 28th, 2013. Uh, I apologize for it being a this late and I'm going to pause for all the truly angry people out there. Um, let them get that out of this system moves you through. You know, one of the key things you got to figure out in life is who you're really mad at. You know, are you really mad at me? You never met me. I haven't done nothing to you. Um, I apologize. I had a crazy frigging weekend. Now last I talked to use, unless you're new to the podcast and if you're new, welcome. Huh? Look at me. I'd say I'm borderline jovial at this point. Welcome to the Monday morning podcast. Um, last I spoke with you, I was on my way to Hawaii

Speaker 1:          00:00:59       and I was going to go to the pro bowl. Then initially I was going to stay there for a week, but uh, I ended up getting some acting work, which is great. So I had to cut it short and tell the lovely near that I couldn't take her to Hawaii. I'll have to do it next time. And basically I was going to go out there, I was going to do my show through republic and then I was going to go to the pro bowl the next day, you know, then go look at a volcano, whatever the fuck I was going to do when I was going to fly back. But at least I was going to do that. And um, I ended up, uh, getting another acting gig on Monday. And I know what you're thinking. Jesus fell, Eh, you're acting all over the place, you know, and you know what? No, I'm not. No, I'm not.

Speaker 2:          00:01:42       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:01:42       I'm not, it's just this business knows, it knows when you, when you're planning to do something fun. You know, I don't have any fun plans next month. No vacations, not waterskiing. I'm not taking that, that, uh, that needle point class that I've had my eye on. I don't have any fun plans next month. And you know what I have for acting worth? I got shit. I got nothing. This fucking God damn business. It's saw it felt it. Felt it in the universe. Oh, look at Billy, right face. Oh, freckle face himself. He's going to go to the islands. Go to a game. Ever. Good time, man. I go fuck yourself as a couple of acting gigs. You go out there, you do just stand up Gig. All right? You go to bed, you get on a plane, you fucking come right back. Nothing for you. That's what I did this weekend,

Speaker 2:          00:02:36       okay?

Speaker 1:          00:02:36       I worked Friday night. Saturday. I got on a fucking plane by myself. All right. And I'm sitting there and you know when you fly to Hawaii, I've never done this before. They have like on the monitors that play in the music, they already got the music on where? Well, well, well, well, well, well, well who could do bup, bup, bup, bup, [inaudible], right. Whatever the fight, they kept that shit. You're already, you already feel like you're in Hawaii and I'm sitting there like an asshole. I'm looking around, everybody's got their wife or their girlfriend, you know, or whatever their fantasy football, fucking hand job, boyfriend, whatever the fuck they got, whatever the hell it is. When guys all go on a vacation and they're not in their twenties, whatever the fuck that's called the, we're sick of a fucking wives vacation. I don't know what it is. And I'm sitting there like an asshole. Right? So I fly out there, crack of dawn, fly out there and uh, I can't even remember the fucking weekend.

Speaker 1:          00:03:38       Yeah. Nia didn't give me a ride. So must have been really early. You kind of have this deal. If it's too early, I just jumped in a cab. So I took a cab to the airport, got on the fucking plane, flew out there, landed and you know, cause I wasn't bringing my girls just like fuck it. I'll stay at whatever, stay at the cheapest place out of the three that were given to me. Right. So when I show up to this fucking place, it's like I show up. I'm the only guy, like under the age of like 78 there. It's just a bunch of fucking old people and there's an, I hop built into the place and there's like a fucking homeless guy. It just, I felt like I was staying in like the Port Authority section of Hawaii. And what makes it worse is I got there at 12 noon and my room wasn't ready until three so now I'm sitting there like this fucking asshole and I'm like adamant, I'm not going to the, I hop they have those on the mainland. I want to do some island shit and the fucking 12 hours, then I'm going to be here. And there was a diner on the corner and I went there.

Speaker 2:          00:04:43       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:04:44       And I, I'm standing, there's like fucking 12 people online. I'm like, you gotta be shitting me, right? This is just a stupid touristy place. There's fucking candy wrappers on the ground before you even go in there is the recess wrapper on one side. There's the cup from the Reese's cup. Like somebody just fucking just ripped it open. Like just, it was such forced, the Reese's cup went up in the air. He fired both fucking parts of the package. He pardons port and starboard and then just gulp it down as he ran up, not paying for it or whatever. Looked like there was some, so somebody got mugged who had some candy, you know. So I'm sitting there going, this is a fucking shit hole, but I don't have a car. And I'm like fuck it, I'm going to stay right. So I go there and I ordered this thing.

Speaker 1:          00:05:26       Yeah. That evidently was a Hawaiian dish and just turn out to be a burger patty with some gravy and some eggs and a, I'm sitting there eating it by myself. Mind you, I can't go to the pro bowl now cause I have to fly right the fuck back at, uh, I was sitting there and I'll send, this guy taps me on, on my shoulder. I look over and he goes, hey, she'll be going, what? What, what? What do you know that that looks delicious? And I look at the guy and I'm like, I know this fucking guy who was this guy? He looked like a mix between hulk Hogan and triple h. So I kept thinking, is this guy a fucking wrestler?

Speaker 2:          00:06:00       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:06:00       And then I, I told him, I go, I don't know what the name of the dishes, but it just say hamburger patty with eggs and gravy and they'll get it to, and he laughed and he goes, hey, thanks. And he walked away and I sat there for five minutes and I was like, fuck, that was Kevin Greene, former Pittsburgh Steeler. Swear to God, I'm 90% sure it was him.

Speaker 1:          00:06:20       So that was the one cool thing that happened to me. Somebody who I think was Kevin Green asked me what I was eating. I told them I didn't know what the name of it was. He laughed and he left. And then I ate that shit. And they go, do you want dessert? It's like, no, I don't want dessert, but I still have two hours and 15 minutes to kill before my fucker rumps ready. So bring it on, lady. What do you got? What do you got? You got some hooky loud fucking hookup. Luca. Luca fucking ice cream. Cause I want it. I want to do something Hawaiian cause I'm leaving in fucking 12 hours. Right. So they got this Hawaiian fried ice cream. And immediately I'm thinking, well, isn't that just what, you know, Mexicans do that right? This is just the same shit. So what, I never had fried ice cream before, so go, Yo, let me get to Friday scream, fuck it. And I'm sitting there and I'm sitting now, there's old ladies looking like this checklist please. She looked like, you know, like whenever they interview people who are still alive that aren't like Alfred Hitchcock movies, like that chick from the birds or maybe the chick from psycho. That's what she looked like. But like courage. Now she's sitting there,

Speaker 2:          00:07:26       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:07:27       Yeah, she's a, you know, an old red head. And I'm like, is that what I'm going to look like? Except for like the male version, this is what I'm thinking about in paradise, you know, paradise sitting in some shit fucking diner. This is all stuff they don't show you on the brochure by the way. Sit into some shit fucking diner. And uh, so by the way, the food was delicious. I got to tell you this, it was delicious, but it was a dump. Um,

Speaker 2:          00:07:53       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:07:53       Sweating like 15 minutes go by. I'm like, it's fucking ice cream.

Speaker 2:          00:07:57       Okay,

Speaker 1:          00:07:57       what are you doing? Just scoop it out of the thing. And I'm like, are they really frying this? How do you fry it without melting it? Is the dumbest podcast ever say. Finally, bring it over. It's this big goop of fucking shit and it's just surrounded by this moat of whip cream.

Speaker 2:          00:08:12       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:08:12       You know, and I ate the whole fucking thing out of sheer be like trying to kill time. It's probably like 3000 calories. Plus I had a burger with gravy, gravy on it with two eggs over easy. All of it. Delicious. All of it. A wonderful thing to eat if you're fucking 14 years old. But if you're 44, it's not a good scene. So anyways, I finally get into the um, the hotel. Oh, we have a package for you. Look at the package is the package and look at the package and it's the fucking pro bowl tickets that I'm not going to. And I hand them over to my buddy, a fucking Rosebowl legend Jason Law head. He takes him out. They like glowing that shit and pulp fiction. And I'm like, and I'm in my head, I'm like, dude, you've got to put those things away. I didn't say it. I was like, Oh yeah, it's great man. I have a great time. I heard they're great seats. You fucking cook. True. Um, so whatever, oh, I forgot this part. I come walking out of the, uh, the diner and that homeless guy I saw sitting there who looked like Kenny Rogers, if he never got the plastic surgery and like lived outside since the Nixon administration, right? He's sitting there and when I come out, there's a security guard there, you know, no gun, no authority. He's just sent out their baby face. He's like fucking 21 years old. And I could see his body language like God, Jesus Christ, right? And all I hear is the homeless guy lie. No, I'm not leaving

Speaker 1:          00:09:44       Chevy to jail cause I don't want to. And you see the kid like, dude, I really don't want to fight. You think I want to do this job. Somebody sent me out of here and I'm just, and I just start fucking laughing to myself because I, for some reason I didn't think I was good. You know, I'm going to Hawaii. I feel like I'm going to paradise. It's not going to be homeless people here. It's fucking paradise. Right. And, and it was the same shit, the same shit or was an air in an area. I felt like I was going to get mugged. I found out later that there's a bunch of hookers in that area. I was like, we talked about this, a bunch of a people with kids. They're like, no, no. At night, at night they all come out. And I was just like, you know, how did they get out there? You know, how many dicks did they suck to get out there? And like how many fucking a, I dunno, a spiritual change. How long were you begging? So we tried to tell me that cities put their homeless guys on planes and fly them out there. Like they say, said they call it the rainbow project. And I didn't believe that for a fucking second. And I didn't give a shit. If you send me documented proof, there's no fucking way. You get a crazy homeless guy and all his funk on a fucking plane

Speaker 1:          00:10:57       get out. They can still refuse your service. No Way. He's coming on there with this fucking horrific feet and elbows and all the, you know, there's no way. There's no way. And plus the guy's going to fucking have a seizure by the time he gets there from alcohol withdrawal, you know those amps stells they sell on the plane are going to help him. But you know what I think it is. I think it's just being around the beach like a beach bum. There's something about being around the beach like, yeah, I'll get to it tomorrow. You know? Yeah, it did. I did. I pay Red AG. Can't remember nick scene or you're homeless. The it guy, you know, give a fuck whether it's nice sleep under a palm tree. You know, I don't, I wasn't even there long enough. So I did my show at this place, the Republic Republic, and it was the shit crowd was fucking awesome.

Speaker 1:          00:11:48       Sold out. Thank you to everybody who came out. I'm definitely coming back with some of the best energy. I, I've had it a show since I can remember people were so psyched that somebody from the mainland flu, flu is pastey ass all the way out there. I ran into one guy, he like flew over from another island. Um, and it was like, it was locals, it wasn't Taurus. And I found the couple of times I've performed on islands, people who live on islands a fucking cool as hell. You know, I did a Gig on Nantucket, uh, last year, you know, and I met up, you know, fishermen and Pete, people who are there year round through all the weather and all that shit. It's just a, they're good people man. So I had a great time there. Uh, finished my show,

Speaker 1:          00:12:35       you know, whored myself out, sold the DVD, smiling and waving. I had two beers, went back to the hotel, slept for four and a half, five hours, got on a fucking plane and flew right back. Oh wait, wait. I bought a magnet to prove like technically I can't even say I was there cause I didn't do anything. I did walk down to the beach for half a second and took a picture of myself, whichever deadly is called a selfie. I learned that on Chelsea. Peretti is Twitter, it's called the Selfie. I took one of those with a mountain in the background sorta for the bunch of buildings and uh, but you know, the upside was, uh, sold out. The crowd was awesome. I'm definitely gonna come back and, uh, I think that there is going to be another pro bowl because, uh, I guess the game was, was you know, a bunch of scoring. They were sort of hitting and I think the NFL was just sort of threatening the players. Like, Hey, quit fucking dog in the entire game. Cause it's an embarrassment to the league, you know, how about a mild concussion? Can you give that up for the league just so we can keep this thing going? You know, so it isn't a total fucking embarrassment what or whatever. I had a great time when I was out there. The, uh,

Speaker 1:          00:13:47       I don't know what the fuck I landed at 12. I left the next morning at five. What is that, 17 hours, you know? [inaudible] um,

Speaker 3:          00:13:59       yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:14:00       yeah. Then I flew back. I did a fucking acting gig where they put some glued some shit to my face. Did that this morning, and then I flute fucking back here and I'll do my podcast and uh, Neil was giving me shit. You kind of do the podcast. Oh, you know, they do that.

Speaker 1:          00:18:33       This is what I'm doing for the Super Bowl. All right? I have to work the day of the Superbowl. Believe it or not. Alright. Old twinkle toes. Just finishing up an acting gay. Karen. Speaking of acting gigs, um, I have a movie coming out or there's a movie coming out that I'm in. It's not my movie, it's a movie I'm happy to be in. It's called standup guys comes out February 1st. All right. Stars, Al Pachino, Christopher Walken and Alan Arkin and old Billy red faces walking by in the background for a couple of scenes. Do not blink. You will miss me. But do you remember back in April of last year when the podcast was late and everybody was given me a ton of shit about it and I said, you wait Nate fucking months. I'm gonna have the greatest excuse ever. I was late that day because I was in a scene with a Al Pachino and Christopher Walken a right? So go fuck yourself. That's why it was like,

Speaker 4:          00:19:24       how do you like that? How do you like them apples? Huh? I'm a Boston guy. Can I say that? I grew up in the suburbs. You can only say that if you're from Southie

Speaker 1:          00:19:33       anyways. Um, I'll be working on the day of the Superbowl, but I don't give a shit because, uh, in my limited wisdom, I think I've, I've, I've figured out how to watch the super bowl. All right. Not only do you watch it by yourself, okay, so most important game of the year, it's for the championship. He's fucking guys, they're playing a game. Wait, they're going to die. Oh, by the rugby. People are paying attention to the level of concussions are right. They are leading with your shoulders and no pads. Not saying he not tough. Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:20:09       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:20:09       I think this finally proves that American football is the most psycho fucking sport there is that psycho sport. But you know what I mean?

Speaker 1:          00:20:19       I wouldn't even say it's tougher than rugby ball sports. A tough, but like the whole thing that English people, and they always say that, oh, they got helmets on their fucking pussies. All the helmet does is make you think that you're protected and you use it as a weapon, but your fucking brains in there in the fucking water and it's slam it all over your head. And then when you're 40, you shoot yourself in the chest, you know, so, so the scientists can fucking look at your brain and figure what's going on in there. The rugby people do that 40 I don't think you do. I think he's still running around out on the pitch with the fucking masking tape around your ears. As far as my research goes, sorry. Every once in a while I get to wake those cuts up. Um, so anyways, this is how I'm going to watch the super bowl.

Speaker 1:          00:21:05       You got to watch it by yourself. You got to get away from the fucking, the, the, the, the I, all the brides that come over, including the, the fucking guy broads, you know the ones who don't watch football and they just show up for the dip and they're there. They're there with the fucking chicks they're trying to get laid in. Your fucking house is basically what they're doing. They talked during the game and they shut up during the commercial and then when the game comes back on the like, I didn't like that one. I thought that was good. How much do you make that cost? Right. And meanwhile you can't even watch the fucking game. And then every fucking year they got to have some Waylon whore or some agent fucking rockstar with hair plugs come out there for one last fucking swing at glory.

Speaker 1:          00:21:49       So this is what you do. People invite you to the, Hey, wait, what are you doing for a soup bowl? Eh, ah, you know what? I'm, I'm mum going, Nah, I got this thing I got to do. Ah, yeah, I got to go out in the woods, come up with something. Or just just, you know what? Why are you going to lie? I'm watching it by myself. Why are you going to do that? Because I want to watch the game. That's why. All right, so now you've eliminated all the clients that are that, that are going to be in your living room. Now that's stage one of the cont removal. Stage two is to get rid of the country you don't want to see that are on the television. And this is the most important part. You record the fucking game. I know a lot of people already do this ship of this. People who don't, okay, so just bear with me. He record the fucking game. You shut up, you fucking cell phone. You don't answer your phone. You don't go on your computer, all right? And you just as is. The whole rest of the world is watching somebody lip syncs, some prerecorded.

Speaker 2:          00:22:56       Hey Brad,

Speaker 1:          00:23:01       whatever the fuck they do, write the fucking Jessica. Go right over the fucking top. You know what he did downstairs? Spackle on a wall. Wait for that red. That pink spackle, the turn white so you can sand that fucker down. Right? But a little God damn pain on it. Nobody knows. Nobody knows from last year when you punched the wall, cause that fucking douche wouldn't shut up during the game and he was double dipping. You fucking put your hand through. I'll fix that thing. Patch that hole in the wall is everybody is watching Huey Lewis and the news went

Speaker 2:          00:23:34       Bam, Bam.

Speaker 1:          00:23:36       Try to fucking kick off the game. Whoever the fuck they got this year, right?

Speaker 3:          00:23:40       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:23:42       They got Beyonce is going to sing whatever the hell she's going to do with the whole halftime. She shouldn't be there unless she's watching the why is she out there? What you're going to get y'all out there? A little glitter hot pants. You know, I don't want to see that shit. So what you do is you just let the game go. Let it go for a good, I don't know, 90 minutes, two hours. Then you sit down like you control the universe. Like you, Jesus walking on the water, except you sitting in your fucking chair and you turn that fucker on and you hit fast forward one, two, three, four and you watch all the talking heads and then you'd get your fucking, you watch watching fast Mohsen Adam and the ants, whoever the fuck they have opened up. Maybe Metallica sing in a fucking Tom Petty Song.

Speaker 1:          00:24:26       Maybe Tom Petty's there with them and that fucking, uh, uh, would it hell's his name there? Lou Reed. Maybe he's out there singing and who the fuck knows? That seems to be the thing. You have the old people first, then he gets some young hottie during halftime sitting there with her tits hanging out. Isn't that what you're dealt? That's America. Um, you fast forward to all that fucking shit and the beginning and he just get right to the kickoff. You just watched the game at your leisure, at your fucking leisure. And then you know what happens after the first half and they start wheeling that big dumb fucking stage out there. And every douche bag we ever had a fucking dream of dancing is fucking, you just taken up a whole football field of fucking singers and dancers the most and football fucking thing you could possibly have. You know, and everybody who talked to her in the first half, they're all shutting up. They're sitting there on their fucking knees, two feet from your fucking breathing on your flat screen. You now like it's the beginning of the Mickey Mouse Club, and they get their fucking ears on. You fast forward through all of that shit and he'd just go right in and then you know what happens is you never lose the flow of the game

Speaker 5:          00:25:34       now

Speaker 1:          00:25:36       before you're not. Why don't you invite a couple people over who want to do it that way? People who want to shut the fuck up real fence. And I suggest this, if you want to sound intelligent to the people that you're going to watch the game with, I highly recommend buying the sports illustrated this week that has both of the Har Brother harbor brothers. However, the fuck you say their names on the cover, both phenomenal coaches. Obviously they're there in the Superbowl and Goddamn it, they both of them, if their teams didn't fuck up, I know it's a big if 49, it's didn't drop three fucking punch or whatever the hell it did last year. And uh, you know, at the Ravens did what they miss a fucking extra point or something. I came, it was like a chip shot, um, that, that would have been back to back years with them. Who knows them. They both would've gone and then they would've partied too much and then they would have sucked this year. That's what happens. But whatever.

Speaker 5:          00:26:30       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:26:31       Anyways, so they got this great article where they break down the game at a level that I wish I could, I knew more of.

Speaker 5:          00:26:41       MMM. They got

Speaker 1:          00:26:44       this thing and they remember, remember one, uh, what the fuck his name was going to say? Hammer Lik been watching too much fucking hockey. What's the name of the a cam. Cameron. The fuck's the name of the quarterback. Kaepernick. What's his name? Chris Kaepernick. Chip Kaepernick. Uh, creepy Kaepernick. Whatever the fuck his name is. The guy's the shit you don't, when he was running wild like fucking hulk Hogan against the Green Bay packers. Basically he was, uh, they were, they were breaking down that play, trying to see if they will be able to run it. And they, it's called the zone read and they run it out of the, the pistol alignment. How cool is that?

Speaker 1:          00:27:29       Which is basically the shotgun formation, but you're closer to the center. So they call it the pistol alignment. You've got to tail back right behind you and this is what happens. You hiked the ball, quarterback turns around, he puts the ball right in the fucking bread basket of the tailback. And right there. He does his zone read, which basically means he looks at that defensive end of the linebacker who's supposed to seal off the edge and he basically does a quick read. If the fucking guy holds his ground, he just hands, he continues handing the ball off to the fucking tail back. But if the fucking guy on the Ed bites on it and starts to pension, you pull it back and you fucking run around, run around the side. There you go. Let's call the zone read from the pistol alignment and the point where you're holding the ball, almost giving it to tailback but not really. But maybe you had Ghana, that's called the mesh point.

Speaker 1:          00:28:25       I wish I knew this shit. I really did. But they have like 10 pages on this shit. Talking about the ravens defense, their running game, eh, was absolutely fascinating. So much better than watching a ESPN and watching herm Edwards screaming or that guy with the hair and the cold pizza yelling, you know, you know, he always sucked in gym class. He reeks of it, reeks of it. He looks like he's good at like rich white guys sports like uh, I'd say Polo but he's so fucking short. He'd probably fall off the horse trying to hit that goal. I think maybe my badminton. There you go. Bad Man. Maybe he's good at Badman but um, this is like everything you want to know without the screaming and yelling and I'm really being a nerd right now because I'm basically saying the book is better than the movie but uh, I highly recommend reading that shit and then watching the game by yourself and seeing if he can pick out the pistol alignment.

Speaker 2:          00:29:18       Yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:29:19       the zone read and the pistol alignment, you know, I dunno. That type of Shit excites me. Don't you want to know what the cover too is for once in your life? Don't you wish you could watch football? These fucking assholes playing fantasy football and fucking with their faces two inches from the God damn screen. Memorize and stats. Wouldn't you want to be up in the stands? Being able to see what each is doing

Speaker 4:          00:29:42       and how teams are adjusting. Like last week it was like, or two weeks ago when the 49 is where all of this, they were down 14 nothing or something crazy and all of a sudden it just stopped and they came back and every goal, Kaepernick, Kaepernick, blah, blah, blah, blah. I'm reading this fucking article and the uh, one of the offensive coordinators or the 49 is like, Nah, you know, after, you know, bought a quarter, quarter and a half, we kind of saw what they were doing and then we adjusted to it. Then you're like, oh, that's what happened.

Speaker 3:          00:30:11       Okay.

Speaker 4:          00:30:11       I just stopped the momentum changed magic. Like I watch it. It's such a, I'm a ball watcher. I hate it. I hate that I am, I wish I could sit up in the stands. It'd be like, oh, it's a fucking, you know, I don't know any other defense other than cover too. I love when, what's his face? I actually hate it when Gruten starts talking about the defenses and stuff. They got eight girls and the books and they start throwing up this terminology. It's like, why don't you fucking tell me what it means?

Speaker 3:          00:30:36       You know,

Speaker 4:          00:30:37       I dunno. Bill, why don't you utilize the Internet and fucking look it up? I'm sure there's a youtube video bought it. Okay, you got me.

Speaker 4:          00:30:43       So anyways, that's how I'm watching the, uh, that's how I'm watching the Superbowl thoughts. Anyone, anybody, is this even remotely fucking interesting? I don't, I don't, you know, whatever you, you know my policy, I always tape in the morning. I never take on days when I flew on a fucking plane, but I had no choice because I had to fly today.

This is more me reminiscing about my week.

Speaker 3:          00:32:23       Okay.

Speaker 4:          00:32:23       Sort of a verbal diary, audio diary. Um, I saw this a new documentary on Ginger Baker, which is funny. I used to listen to when I was growing up, Ginger Baker and I thought it was just a nickname. This is before ginger,

Speaker 1:          00:32:39       that term jump the ocean and came over here, uh, from Ireland, Scotland and England. He was a red headed dude, Ginger Baker or whatever. So the name of this podcast, a podcast, the made this documentary is beware of Mr. Baker and I don't care if you play drums or not, there's no way you're not going to enjoy this. This guy's one of the most interesting human beings have ever seen in my life. You guys think I'm a crabby old fucking man. You got to see this guy.

Speaker 2:          00:33:09       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:33:10       And He trashes John Bonham.

Speaker 2:          00:33:14       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:33:15       He trashes them and I'm going to say what he says here in about five seconds. So fast forward if you don't want me to ruin it. But uh, for those of you who don't play drums, nobody trashes John Boehner unless you just some troll. I'm trying to Piss people off on the Internet. It's like he's, he's the fucking king as far as rock drummers go to guys, the king, it's, you know, there, there is definitely the WHO's better Barnum apart and they argue, but nobody ever says that Bonham sucks if you're just being a Douche. But Ginger Baker actually, they asked him what he thought about John Bonham and I guess people trashed you on the Internet because there's so many constant. But anytime you ever asked a drummer, a rock drummer about John [inaudible], they all just in hush tones speak of the power, his swing, his feel, his subtlety is originality is the triplets, the single bass drum, the whole fucking thing. Ed Ginger Baker said John Bonam couldn't swing a sack of shit. It was one of the fucking, I, my jaw was almost on the ground. I couldn't fucking believe it. And I just burst out laughing. I've never

Speaker 1:          00:34:32       do you hear somebody who's considered a god just dismissed like that. And then even like Clapton, he didn't shit on Barna but like clapped and they were like, you know, how do you compare bottom to Ginger Baker? And he was just like, ah Nah, Nah. He's like, you know, it's not even a, basically it's not even a contest. Ginger Baker was a fully formed musician, a composer and [inaudible] and all this type of stuff.

Speaker 2:          00:34:58       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:34:58       I Dunno, it just for me, I don't like, I mean I've actually looked at photos online and considered blue, having them blown up and hanging them in my house of John Bonham and that's like what I think of them and just to hear somebody just, you know, basically he's like my Lance Armstrong, like you know something like from my Lance Armstrong moment, you know when those people got all disappointed, like what do I tell my kids? My Lance Armstrong moment would be if I found out that in the studio he actually played a double pedal or a double bass drum nine. All lot of you guys are going to show that picture of him with the double bass drum set up. I know the story that that was all when he first got the kit, when, what's his face hooked him up with it. This is so fucking inside at this point.

Speaker 1:          00:35:45       You'd have to be a drama to even like any of this carbon apathy car mine apathy or a PC of have like 58 different pronunciations of their last name. He had a deal with Ludwig and I think bottom initially was playing Slingerlands and Karma and got him in with Ludwig and he got the same set up that car might had. So he had the double bass and he brought it to like one rehearsal and the other guys in the band just kept taking the other bass drum out. Just go and you don't need it. It's cluttering up everything. Um, I really can't imagine him playing a double bass drum set. He would have fucking

Speaker 4:          00:36:22       drowned out the whole God damn bed. Um, but whatever anybody thinks he doesn't have a fast foot, just watch him at Royal Albert Hall in 1970 then he can go fuck yourself. But evidently ginger Baker says he couldn't swing a sack of shit, which just killed me. Um, if you just want to see a fucking angry redhead playing drums, because I haven't made any drum videos, right,

Speaker 3:          00:36:43       Jeff,

Speaker 4:          00:36:47       this is the guy. This is the real deal. Uh, it's called, uh, beware of Mr. Baker, um, underrated listening to ginger Baker for a fucking hour and a half. It was awesome. And then I actually watched some of the, the comeback shows that they had, the one at Royal Albert Hall and he was fucking unbelievable drums just sounded amazing and incredible player. Uh, but that's just the tip of the iceberg. It's just how he lives, his life going broke and just moving on from relationships. Um, really an amazing documentary. So anyways, with that, let's get to some of your questions here. I feel like I've been running my mouth here for fucking almost 40 minutes here. Um, Bill heard you love drinking. Hey Man, heard you love to drink. And I agreed. Drinkings great. But I haven't been handling my liquor too well of late. I've been getting blackout drunk every night for a while now except for a week. What did we, you blacked out drunk when you wrote this? I've been getting, I've been getting blackout drunk every night for a while now, except for a week, maybe a month here and there. Okay. There we go. That was on me. Sorry. What? I want to remember things that have actually happened and not just night terrorists. Any tips on drinking? Semi responsible. Um, I really would like to continue to use it as a social lubricant and overall good time liquid. Thanks for the free rank, right? Uh, you're welcome. Um,

Speaker 3:          00:38:12       okay.

Speaker 4:          00:38:13       I've been getting blackout drunk every night for a while now. Ah, dude, you sound like a, I'm, I love to drink, but I don't get blackout drunk. I get just to the point where I say something I wish I didn't say and I don't do it every night. I'm getting blackout drunk every night. It depends on your age. I mean, if you're like, I don't know, seven. Yeah, 18,

Speaker 1:          00:38:33       18 and you just discovered alcohol and you, you're fucking, you know, drinking the way you fuck 90 miles an hour. Um, that's the only semi scary. Even that scary, but a, yeah. Do blackout drunk is some serious shit. Um, I dunno, I would talk to somebody a, I dunno what I would do

Speaker 1:          00:38:59       if I was getting blackout drunk every fucking night. I think I would quit for a while. Well, I get to a point where I just embarrass myself too much and then I just need to like back off. Um, I've been really big on bare lately. I go back and forth between Scotch and beer and I got into beer and I got into the whole fancy fucking beers now back to beer that I like. My Dad drank and my friends' dads drank when I was a kid. So it was basically beer that we stole. So every once in a while go back to beers and I drank in high school and I drink them. And it's this weird sort of like, you know, I don't want to taste it. I just think about, I always pictured, you know, just drinking in the woods. The cops did the cops coming. Um,

Speaker 1:          00:39:43       so yeah, that would be, that would be my, uh, look, if you're not an alcoholic, I would just monitor your drinking, but if you're getting blackout drunk every night, you might have a problem. So I wouldn't want to tell you how to drink semi responsibly because if you're an alcoholic, you're not going to. Um, so I would explore a little more your level of addiction and when you figure that out, I would then act accordingly. And if you figure out that you're an alcoholic, I would try and quit drinking as soon as possible because it will ruin your life. Uh, believe me, I said something fucking horrible this weekend after I did my shows, it was only after like two beers.

Speaker 3:          00:40:25       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:40:26       I'm going to try to figure out how to tell this story without outing anybody in it. I'm sitting there, I haven't drank since two girls come up. Ah, you a funny, but blah blah. Hey, thanks a lot. How long you staying out here? Uh, I got to leave in five hours. What are you a fucking moron? Yes I am. That type of shit. And so they pointed this girl, she's like the girl next door going, hey, you know what she does? What do you think she does? And I was listening. You say, I can get a read and I just couldn't get a read on this girl.

Speaker 1:          00:40:54       I don't know what she did. She looked like she would just work in customer service, but there was something different about her, but it was because she looked like that I couldn't, uh, she just like, she just get a regular job, you know, get married, become a mom, one of those people that just happy so they don't need to go out and try to achieve some stupid fucking goals so they can then get trashed on Twitter. So anyways, they go, she actually flies those giant cargo planes with like the three tanks in the bag that they drop out with the fucking parachutes. And I'm like, are you shitting me? Like that's all right. I'm blown away. And then she points at her friend and goes, hey, this is my friend. Uh, she used to be a cheerleader for this professional football team, right?

Speaker 1:          00:41:44       They tell me that and now I'm thinking bullshit. I'm like, all right, you're a fucking pilot. Not saying the other girl wasn't good looking, but I'm kind of drunk at this point because I haven't eaten. Only had two beers. That was the thing, only had two fucking peers, but even a two beers, the level of asshole. I am at stone sober, two beers in, I say to law head, I go, I just, you know, kind of whisper to him. I go, there's no way. She was a cowboys cheerleader. She, her rack isn't big enough and then she just goes clear as day. Did you just say my rack isn't big enough. It felt like a fucking ass hole. Then I'm thinking, I thought I whispered that evidently I yelled at over the fucking music. Um, and then I had to try and talk my way out of that. I wasn't saying she wasn't good looking, but you know, you watch him on TV, they make it look like they all got fucking, you know,

Speaker 1:          00:42:34       fucking very least 34 c all the way up to d cup titties. The make look perfect. Most of them are probably fake. It's like the fake teeth. I told her, I said, look, every out there has fake titties and Dallas, this is be flailing trying to get out of it or trying to, like, I felt bad. I should just apologize. It wasn't drunk really. You can't apologize for that. I said it, she heard it. I'm an asshole. But when I did say I go, it's like the fake titty capitol of the world. She did give me a high five and I thought it was fine. But later on when I walked out, I walked by, I think it was her husband, she had a wedding ring on and I walked by this guy and I thought he was waving to many. He holds up a cell phone and I see that there's a picture of a Dallas cowboy cheerleader on, on it. So I think it was his wife, which means she went over and told him, and I want to thank that guy. She told you and you didn't smash a bottle over my head. I really want to, I appreciate it. My fault. Uh, next time I come out there, I'll buy you some

Speaker 4:          00:43:31       fucking, I dunno what, whatever the Poo Poo platter or whatever the fuck they have about their brutal. So that's why I tried to drink at home. You know,

Speaker 4:          00:43:42       what am I gonna do? Say something rude to my dog. Oh Geez. I'm really too old to have continued to have new stories like this. Anyways. All right, Bill, what's my move? I'm a sophomore in college and not very experienced with relationships. Um, I met this girl about three weeks ago in class and she seems pretty cool. We've been hanging out progressively more often during the last couple of weeks. I feel like I've been getting signs from her, but I'm pretty confused now. She comes to my room and we hang out on the bed lying close to each other. Oh God, Dude. She's waiting for you to make a move. That's what your next move is. Make a move. We hang out on my bed line close to each other and do homework or watch a movie or whatever. She also texts me every day. So yesterday we kissed for the first

Speaker 1:          00:44:29       hi gay.

Speaker 5:          00:44:36       Right?

Speaker 1:          00:44:37       Well they bring in the substitute guy and all those nerves that keeping scores, I fucking erasing shit. You know? Now batting how virgin out of the boy in Iowa. Um,

Speaker 4:          00:44:47       anyway, so, so yesterday we kissed for the first time before she left, about 20 minutes after I get a text from her with about six paragraphs explaining how she kind of has a boyfriend, but he treats her like shit. So it's pretty much over. Ah, Jesus. You know what? There's always a price to pay. No matter what you do. It's like that guy who doesn't want to drink anymore. I want you to taper it down. This is a price he's going to pay and the price he's going to pay is, he's going to be sitting there doing the right thing, not drinking, wishing

Speaker 3:          00:45:24       okay.

Speaker 4:          00:45:24       That he could just sit there and fucking pound 20 beers,

Speaker 5:          00:45:28       you know?

Speaker 1:          00:45:30       But he wants to take control of his fucking life and the price he has to pay is, he can't ever do that again. And then there's the other side. You drank the 20 fucking beers and then you know the price you pay. Look at the price I paid after having to fucking lightweight, you know, say you go, you finally make the move, you kiss her. There's always a fucking price. So you gotta ask yourself sauna, you willing to pay this price if you continue, I'm not going to read the rest of this cause I could tell you right now, there is possibly a fucking beat down slash double murder slash maybe double murder suicide at the end of this Pussy Rainbow.

Speaker 5:          00:46:11       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:46:13       Anyways, I'll read the rest and he goes, and also she explains how she's not ready for a relationship, but we can still cuddle. I Dunno about this. Yeah. Fuck this chick.

Speaker 3:          00:46:24       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:46:25       He goes, I'm trying to get my dick wet, but she also seems cool. You're trying to get your dick wet. This dude's not a virgin. You speak in that you're speaking the language. You want to get you a dick way? Yeah, you, we have fucking, this is a pistol fucking formation.

Speaker 3:          00:46:39       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:46:40       All right. You kissed her. That's the mesh point. You got to do a zone read here. What's going on? What's going on right here? Oh Two oh two right, right, right. Come on to, you know what the fuck you got to do right now? You don't, you seem like a guy who got laid, hasn't got laid for a while. So now, or maybe you really liked this girl. I don't know what the fuck's going on.

Speaker 5:          00:47:03       All right.

Speaker 1:          00:47:06       Let me just read the rest of this fucking thing. It's like two more sentences. He says, I just don't want to be in the same position for the next two months. Should I give a shit about this girl? And like getting bullshitty. Yeah, you getting bullshitted. She wants to get out of the relationship, but she doesn't want to be lonely. All right. This is what you should say to say look. All right. I think, uh, you know, I don't do, I don't kiss girls who, yeah,

Speaker 4:          00:47:31       boyfriends. I don't do that stuff and uh, I don't know.

Speaker 1:          00:47:34       Hang out with them laying on beds. I would love to lay in a bed and kiss you if you did not have a boyfriend. So I think it would be best if a, when that situation clears up, you know?

Speaker 3:          00:47:48       Okay.

Speaker 4:          00:47:49       Then come by, you know, but you know, wait awhile. Give the guy an opportunity to see you know, if he's going to kill you or not. So I don't get caught in the crossfire attic, you know, two, three months. He doesn't kill you. I know it's safe and I will gladly bang you and my, uh, my fucking bed, my single, that's how I'd handle it. That's how I should have handled that at your age. But there weren't podcasts, so I just had to listen to my deck.

Speaker 4:          00:48:23       Ah, fuck there. It was. There it was. It took me 50 fucking minutes to be funny, but there was all right, fiances, x. Hey bill, I really appreciate the show. Keeps me sane in the cubicle farm. Well, God bless you for fucking fighting the good fight out there now to the meat of the email.

The position you're putting me in and um, I would never do that to you. I would never hang out with an ex girlfriend of mine. All right. I don't think that that's cool. So I would appreciate it if you would not do that anymore.

Speaker 5:          00:52:03       You know,

Speaker 1:          00:52:05       or maybe he's, he's hoping that you have hot friends that he can try and fuck by. You know, being the guy who hangs out with the chicks. You know, maybe he's trying to do that, but he's trying to fuck something. And if you're the only thing around, he's going to try and fuck you. So no, it's not cool.

Speaker 5:          00:52:21       MMM.

Speaker 4:          00:52:23       Anyways. All right, next one. This is all fucking guys talking about the ladies this week. Um, stay with girl or not. All right. Hi, Bill loved the podcast. Thank you. In a tough situation. So I would like to know your thoughts. I've been with a girl for five months in a few weeks into it. She mentioned she had been in a relationship for five years and he's still friends with the guy. What the fuck is this? The same one? I already answered this.

Speaker 2:          00:52:46       Yeah.

Speaker 4:          00:52:46       Who I've met and who in a bad dude. She used to talk to him a lot so she seemed not over him and mentioned that they were basically fuck buddies since breaking up, which I don't mind happening but do mine. Her thinking it's no biggie to tell me. All right, let me, let me try and do the math on that. She mentioned they were basically fuck buddies since breaking up, which I don't mind happening, but do mind her thinking it's no biggie to tell me. So you don't mind if she's fucking this guy on the side. Just don't bring it up. Wasn't there an R and B song about that?

Speaker 2:          00:53:25       Okay.

Speaker 4:          00:53:26       Thinking about, girl, I don't want to know

Speaker 2:          00:53:28       something. I can't fucking remember.

Speaker 4:          00:53:31       Anyways. It seemed like it was a recent breakup, but when I asked her, she said in a roundabout way, it was about two years ago, about two months in, she admitted that she had last slept with them the week after she met me, which was actually the night of the day we met up for the first time. So after our first date, this sounds dumb, but otherwise things are good and she's

Speaker 2:          00:53:54       okay.

Speaker 4:          00:53:54       Tone talking about him down sense and is a good girl. Different to a lot of

Speaker 2:          00:54:00       okay.

Speaker 4:          00:54:01       Ones in my past, which is why I stayed with her after that. This girl is fucking your brains out. That's what's going on. She likes sex and I guarantee you she fucked this guy at least one more time after your first date.

Speaker 2:          00:54:15       Okay.

Speaker 4:          00:54:16       That does. That's my instinct. I'm not saying that's true. That's just my instinct. Anyways, it says I'm 25 and haven't had a girlfriend before out of not wanting to settle and enjoy being single. Exactly. There we go. Yeah. Haven't had a girlfriend before so you don't know how to set up a relationship. Yeah. Cause you're setting this one up dude. Come on. You got to have some self worth here. Okay. Fuck this shit. This isn't a muddy kids. She's got a fuck buddy. Bangs him one time after your first date. Obviously she wasn't seeing fireworks. The fuck is she doing with you? All right. Let her blow you one more time and show her the fucking door. Sorry. Got Emotional. I'll let the up all this respect this and I'll read the rest. Uh, though I was getting sick of the single life when I got with her and we'd be bummed out with the prospect of getting laid less than once a month. Yeah. You know something. You're both using each other. I, you're five months in. I really hope you're not in love with this girl. Said I have graduated and want to move out of our city partly to move in with a really good friend who I miss who lives in interstate and she still has one year to go and doesn't seem keen on moving.

Speaker 2:          00:55:27       Okay.

Speaker 4:          00:55:28       In your words based on that one incident. I think I already told you. I don't think she's going to be the mother of my children areas and I'll always think of it when I tell people how we met. I feel like could be missing out on advancing my career and being with my best friend as I've grown apart from my other friends, as well as getting out of my shitty small town to you think I should move out and cut this thing. Short apps a Fuckin lutely and you know you should get out of your shitty small town. Fuck this, this girl, she's going to be in that same bar every fucking Christmas when you come home to visit your parents. Okay, she's going to be there and every year of face is going to get a little fatter and she might have more ink on her fucking arm and you are going to be moving on with your life.

Speaker 4:          00:56:13       All right? And then one day you're not gonna want to go back to that bar. You just gonna drive by it and you're going to be like, I want to, if she's in there and you're not going to give a fuck because the girl you give your dreams is going to be in your seat and you're gonna drive right by on this perfectly fucking snow covered road. There's a picture for you. But that's only gonna happen if you dump this whore and get out of that small, Shitty town. All right. That was a good one, Huh? Um, okay. All, all of garden chronicles, Eh, Billy boy. I am a 24 year old part time college student working at Olive Garden. And this new chick here has been a real flirt towards me.

She's putting on a God damn fucking PG 13 sex show,

And the only way you're going to get it as if you just fucking walk away from it and she'll follow you home like a lost puppy. But she's 17, so you don't want that to happen.

Well maybe you'll like this bread like it. Like it's just like this whimsical, there's too many Daisy's. And what you're saying, this is, this is a very dangerous situation.

This girl was steal your laptop screen is a fucking nightmare.

Speaker 1:          01:09:26       Knock it off. All right. All right. Advice for a lady. Dear Bill, I've been with my boyfriend for two years now. We're in college together and he's currently taking a semester abroad. Oh Jesus. Where in Brazil. Before he left, we had a running joke that I was going to need a vibrator when he left as a surprise party gift. He got me one. I have a couple of friends whose boyfriends bought them sex toys, so while I was a little surprised he actually got me a vibrator. I also happen to know that it's a relatively normal, it's relatively normal for a boyfriend and do that. Yeah. That's basically like this era's chastity belt. You know, you're trying to lock down the pussy. That's disgusting Ed. Yeah, that, but that's what he's doing now anyway. Yeah. But it's done because those things, you use them too much. They numb up your area there and then the guy can't even remotely try and, you know,

Speaker 2:          01:10:23       okay,

Speaker 1:          01:10:24       do something for it. And then you gotta be sitting there, Bang, Bang. And I'm, as their user are using the thing as, you know, it's like you want an alien or fucking this girl.

Speaker 1:          01:10:36       That's just all dick has no body. All right, whatever. Let's move on. One of the basing it on and pay some of my fucking life. I did live a little bit of a life before I met you. I realize that. All right. Any way, fast forward to about a week ago, we were on Skype. Uh, he asked you to take this thing out. Um, no, we don't have sex chats. Thank God. And he casually asked me how his gifts for me was working out. I told them it was working out pretty well. He then mentioned that he had bought something for himself. A fleshlight Joe experience is brought to you by the fleshlight every week. He does a very, very weird, those are very lucky in okay. They look like that thing. Boba Fett I fell into when he died in one of those space movies. Okay. Wow. Um, I knew how to be faithful to right.

Speaker 1:          01:11:31       That's nice. Okay. He said, she goes, I knew what this was because I am an avid listener of Joe Rogan's podcast. You go, Joe Robbins come up three times on this podcast who raves about it constantly. My boyfriend had never had mentioned to me that he was interested in anything like that, and I always thought the idea of it was totally creepy. I acted like it was totally cool, but in all honesty, I really don't want him to beat fucking a perfect fake wait. I got lost in that. I actually was thinking as Joe going to get mad that I'm saying that this is weird. Okay. I acted like it was totally cool, but in all honesty, I really don't want them to be fucking of perfect fake vagina whenever he wants to. I'm finding myself getting crazy jealous and angry whenever I think about it. I know, I know I'm jealous of an inanimate object, which seems insane. Let me finish. I'm really struggling with this because part of me wants to be completely okay with it since it's sort of a hypocrite. It's sort of hypocritical to get angry when he got me a vibrator. But now I'm starting to think that maybe he only bought me a Dildo so I wouldn't be able to complete when he got himself a proxy pussy. Ah, Roxy Pussy. So what do you think? Do I need to suck it up and get over this or is my jealousy legitimate? Thanks and go fuck yourself

Speaker 6:          01:12:56       Polaris and go fuck is fake pussy. As long as he's not faking a real pussy, I mean fucking a real pussy and then you know it's all good. Plus you, you, it's not just like the, the pussy that it's, that he's missing. He's also missing like, you know, your touch and kissing and the whole other part of it too. And that fake pussy cat. Oh, am I there? No, he isn't. He's getting right to the dessert. Don't be Jackie. Try these Brussels sprouts. Don't need them. Don't be jealous. I bring over the trace late Lecce when he comes back it will be even better because you both have been like doing it with inanimate objects. And so it's, I don't think the rediscovering each other all over again. I'll be even better. I don't think. We don't even worry. I don't think it's a good thing.

Speaker 1:          01:13:40       Why? Because, uh, once you start down a path sexually, you know, in order to get off that path, you don't just jump over onto another path. You got to walk all the way back up the path you went down, get to the fork where you fucked up and then head down the other one. What I'm saying is he might get used to just doing that and this sensation of that is what gets him off. And then when her pussy doesn't feel like fleshlight,

Speaker 4:          01:14:12       he'll, you don't feel better. He'll, he'll build bang her and then, and then when he needs to finish, he'll be like, all right, and now for me and what that fucking thing.

Speaker 6:          01:14:24       Oh, even better if anything he'll be like, oh my God, I forgot what a real woman feels like. And he'll be done in like two minutes. That's what your hope. Um, I don't think she should be jealous. I'm at though. They're both, they're both doing the right thing when you're in a relationship and you're that far apart from each other because I bang all sorts of Harry European girls and no offense to hear European girls, but I'm just saying, you know, listen,

Speaker 4:          01:14:49       I watched this thing one time or listen to it on the radio, uh, one of those Colin's sex shows and this guy had a pull away. He jerked off to see dry hump. The rug it was causing, like chafing on is decorative, but it, it, it was the only way he could get off because he wasn't in a relationship for a while and he kept doing that and I dunno. So I'm just saying like, I would go easy on those. It's like anything, anything in moderation. How often is he using this and how often is she using that? If you's a vibrate too much, you numb yourself up down there. And then when you guys down there I that he can't feel anything. It's so disgusting. Um, overrated. Underrated for the week. Overrated. The Superbowl, underrated rounds one and two of the NFL playoffs. Bill, this may be sacrilegious to say in America, but I actually enjoy rounds one and two of the NFL playoffs more than the super bowl.

Speaker 4:          01:15:42       That is a sector religious because at no point is beyond say or Brittany Spears sing before and in the halftime show there's not a bunch of douchebags who don't like football showing up feeling like they have to be there. You know all the broad why you yeah, why are you looking at me? Cause you go to super bowl parties every year and you hate football. Yeah. Well they're fun. They're nice gatherings. Talk when the game's on. No I don't. They run yap. When the most important game is on, it's disgusting. If you do it again this year we're breaking up each week. You get two games both on Saturday and Sunday. There seems to be that we can win this thing, excitement in the air and I can relax and watch the games and the comfort of my home or at a local bar without dozens of non-fans in the room as is typically the case of the Superbowl party Superbowl and the other hand has become so pretentious in recent years.

Speaker 4:          01:16:37       I don't even really want to get worked up for it as much as I used to. The game takes forever. 85% of the commercial sucks and we're forced to stare at Madonna's beat up face for 30 minutes during a halftime show plus the two week gap in between the Superbowl and the conference champion really takes the air out of the sales. What are your thoughts? I think this is what you do. You watch the Superbowl alone and you tape it and you start watching it. You DVR it and you watch, you let you let you give the game a 90 minute headstart

Speaker 1:          01:17:10       and then then you just sit down, you watch it by yourself and you plow through the pregame and you just watched the fucking game. And when the halftime show comes, you fast forward through that and now you're under the third quarter and third quarter and fourth quarter it's going to be regular time football. That's the way to watch the Superbowl. And you watch it by yourself. Maybe with another buddy of yours who that uh, enjoys the game. That's how I would do it, you know?

Speaker 4:          01:17:36       No thoughts on that. No. But what about the social aspects? Shut up. You were going to have brownies during the old cheese doodles. Oh my God. The way the broad talk to her and that fucking game. And then now and then, and it's true women who like, and everybody shuts up to watch the commercials and then, and then the game comes back on the, I took that one was late. What did you think? Well, that's definitely the best one so far. How much did that cost? Well, why don't you start going of a Superbowl parties then, Bill, why don't you stop if you don't like the game, I don't do any of that stuff that you're talking about. I don't, I don't like needle point. I don't go to your fucking metapoint parties to late. They don't do any order. You do arts and crafts. I don't crash the super bowl or those things and come there and talk when you're trying to glue the popsicle sticks together and then shut the fuck up. When a talk throughout the game, I go in the other room or I hang out with other people if they're lies. Lies, lies. Yeah. No lies. Lies. Lies. Okay. That's the Monday morning podcast. Oh, before I get out of here. Huh? That's it. That's it. We did a nice long one. All right. There's nothing else. No. Okay.
