Speaker 1:          00:00:02       Hey, what's going on is bill borough and it's the Monday morning podcast from Monday, April 28th, 2014 what's going on? How, why, yeah, I am recording this and, uh, I'm actually, according to Sunday night, I just finished doing my show here in Albany, um, at this beautiful theater. I don't even fucking know the name of. Well, look at that. Would you look at that? And you're probably like, why bill you arrogant ass? Everybody came down to the fucking show. You don't even know the name of the place. Well, the reason for that is, is a, I've been on vacation at a, I felt like I was shaking rust off this weekend. I had good shows and everything, but I was more trying to remember the order of things, how I kinda did shit and what connected to what. And uh, whenever I do that, I'm in my head too much and then I don't, it doesn't flow as well.

Speaker 1:          00:00:56       Um, you know, only I noticed, but I noticed so, uh, either way, I want to thank everybody who came out in Burlington, Vermont, um, people who came out in Portland, Maine and people came out here and, uh, Albany, New York. It was great to come back to this part of the country. I did a lot of my early stand up, especially up in Maine and he used to do all the Bob Miley gigs up there at the old comedy connection up there. He used to do and um, I didn't do too much shit in Vermont. You know, Vermont is a, uh, I dunno, that's like, it was just a little, I was south of Boston, so, you know, you drove up 93, a route three, you fucking won in New Hampshire. Then he shot right into me. And that was basically at that little corner of it that, that I, I went to.

Speaker 1:          00:01:46       And um, so this time when I came back from Burlington, Vermont to Portland, I could've, I could've driven the fast way, but I decided to go the scenic route. I'm going to go, the CD crew can see what the country looks like. And I fucking went there and it was amazing to look at. But all I kept getting stuck behind people and like mini vans or trucks and I'm driving like a psycho. And after a while there's only so many furniture stores and Barnes and old places with signs that you can look at before you want to get the fuck out of there. But, um, we had a great time or for a month, I didn't realize they had the heroin problem. They did. You know, I didn't bring it up during the show because it was so not funny. But Jesus Christ a fuck is their heroin.

Speaker 1:          00:02:30       Like that level of a problem in Vermont. Vermont is like one of those states where, you know, you finally knock up your woman, you know, like, you know what, why don't we give this kid a great childhood and where should we move this kid where no one can hurt him and he can fucking run around with horses and all of that Shit. Right. And, uh, we know Vermont's one of those places. Well that's right. They had it in rolling stone. The new face of heroin, the explosion of drugs like Oxycontin has given way to heroin. The heroin epidemic ravaging the least likely corners of America. Jesus Christ

Speaker 1:          00:03:12       like Vermont. What does it say? How do you pronounce B U, c. O. L, I. C. B, U. C o. L, I. C, Bucolic Bu Cocky Vermont, which has just woken up to a full blown crisis. You know, ever since aids came out, not a lot of people say full blown anymore. So I want to give, I want to give rolling stone a good nod there. You know I was talking to you about a while ago. I was looking at theaters to do a new special in an inside on old theaters. The only time you used the word ornate and another example is full blown, full blown is only used with aids. I mean, what did they say? I'm trying to think of pre aids. So I fucking remember with full blown, we've got a full blown epidemic. I'll tell you, last night I went to the bathroom after that Mexican again food. I took a full blown shit. I don't know what people used to say,

Speaker 1:          00:04:06       but ever since I can remember since the mid eighties, full blown is always been filed with age. Look how much progress we've made with death disease. Not only can people live longer with HIV virus, you can actually now save full blown crisis. That's a major, that's a major movement, you know. Um, anyways, I got to read this whole thing. I got to read this whole thing. It was a, it was terrible to see, cause it's such a beautiful frigging place. Oh Bill, shut up with your stupid travel tips. You, you know, go fuck yourself. What do you want from me? I went, I went to three places where you go either skiing or antiquing. All right. There was no snow. So what else was I supposed to do? I went up there with Versie and I brought some Cubans out that way. I got to lay off this habit I really good at.

Speaker 1:          00:04:54       I'm, I'm done with and not done with it. Who's kidding who? But I, I gotta I gotta knock it down. All right. I smoked enough cigars this month to, uh, I don't know what kill a fucking grizzly bear. I like him, but I, um, I'm finishing the Cubans. I got left and then I'm going to be done for awhile. At least that's what I'm telling myself. A fucking moron. All right, let's talk NHL playoffs people. I apologize too, if the energy isn't what you're used to on this podcast. Uh, like I said, I'm in this hotel room and you remember what happened to me in New Jersey when I was screaming at the top of my lungs. I'm trying to avoid that. Trying to avoid that. Uh, hey. You know something? I was giving myself shit about all my Stanley Cup picks and all of a sudden every, all the series is other than the turning around here, you know, Chicago comes back and beats the blues man. That would, that was amazing and devastating to watch it. No amazing for Blackhawk fans, but that's all they've seen for the last few years. So,

Speaker 2:          00:05:59       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:05:59       I feel less good for them and more bad for Saint Louis, Jesus Christ. How many times they're going to break your heart. That team is aptly named the blues. Jesus Christ. What does you, what are you going to do? You gotta come up with a new name for that fucking team. They just keep doing that to their fence. How many times? And they keep coming back. Great fence.

Speaker 2:          00:06:22       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:06:22       Why do they keep blowing Sears? Um, Minnesota actually tied up to series with, uh, the avalanche before they went back up three to two. And I felt really good about it until Matt Cook blew out somebody else's knee once again. Or is he calls it finishing his check.

Speaker 2:          00:06:41       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:06:41       I saw it as a part of the night as apology. Just talking about he has, he has cleaned up his game. He actually won an award for being the most improved player, but I just don't get stuck in your fucking, I don't get it. I don't get how that's finishing your fucking chair. I don't why that the, the reason that you would do that,

Speaker 1:          00:07:01       I mean, he still could've brought his stick up maybe and hit the guy in his shoulder or something like that. You don't fucking do that. We get nothing I don't understand is what the guy who decides to do a need in each check. How come both their knees don't blow out or how come sometimes the other guy who who's doing the dirty move like his knee doesn't blow up. I got to tell you, I thanks. Stefan can tell. I think he's keeps going. A, he's going really lenient. He only gave him a seven game suspension and he only gave Lou Cheech a $5,000 fine for stabbing somebody right between the balls.

Speaker 2:          00:07:34       I Dunno.

Speaker 1:          00:07:36       This guy's like a player's coach. Who the fuck knows? Anyways, the ducks. All right, so in Minnesota could still win that series, but that would make me happy because you know what the fuck they did or mad cooked it, but I called the Chicago series.

Speaker 1:          00:07:51       Ducks are probably gone right now. They were up three to two. I picked the ducks in that one. I did pick the king's over these shacks. That one's straight it to who the fuck knows they are the sharks, sort of the West Coast, St Louis Blues where they just put their, they just taught you their fence. They get them all excited. Hey, we might do something. Go Fuck Yourself. Go Watch a baseball game. Sorry about that. Come back in October. Yeah, this certain fence, they just like San Diego charge offense. It's just like, what the fuck did they do to deserve what that team does to them? Every goddamn be a Philadelphia Eagle fits. Well actually, you know what they did? You know what they did.

Speaker 1:          00:08:32       You can't feel bad for Philadelphia Eagle Fans. You just can't, not all, if some of them, you can tell the ones who actually go to the game and are human beings, but that the core fan base of fucking animals, I use surprise even know what the score is. They just hose them down every game. That's it. Bath. Give him eight Beth's a year, eight home games right now of Canadians. They wrapped their up for games to done. The penguins are coming back. They're three to to cut help you if you don't like hockey. And I picked the flyers, they actually tied it up to two and that was three, two ranges. So knows I still make my pics. Might all come in. And what would that mean, bill? I don't know. I don't fucking know. So now the Bruins get to play the uh, the blue block a conch though. I actually like the Canadians and I liked the uniforms, but I just can't stand their fence. Jesus is so fucking, there's such fucking pussies.

Speaker 1:          00:09:30       I just, the way, the way they throw up their fucking hands when they think they got robbed on a call. There's so God damn dramatic. Why don't you just take a little fucking hankie out of your front pocket and fucking wave at, at the ref with three of your fingers in the air. You know, I actually went to a game that early this year and I found they're either like that or their absolute animals. [inaudible] that's, those are Canadian fence there either the stereotypical French person minus the Beo. I will give them that. Or they, they look like absolute animals. They look like they came in from some northern fucking province. But anyways, I'm just breaking that balls. All right. I think this, obviously it's a Bruins Canadian series. Um, I know we've swept each other in the past, but I just think that, I know we're, we're even enough.

Speaker 2:          00:10:21       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:10:22       It's just never easy. It's, it's going to go, there's, I don't think that they could beat us and under seven games and I don't think that we could beat them. And, and under six

Speaker 1:          00:10:34       and the sixth game would be in Montreal. I'd skits. Got to go seven, right. It's got to go seven when we both have competitive teams, it goes sevens. It's going to be a class yet, but I'll tell you right now, if you're not in no hockey and you want to get into it, why don't you check out the Bruins? A Canadian series. Um, all right, so, so there's that Jesus' question. Why do I try to do a podcast after a fucking show? Huh? I just want to wind down and add to my fucking pasty belly. That's what I want to do. I want to go down to the hotel kiosk and go get some fucking Oreo cookies and then some of those nuclear orange crackers and eat the orange crackers first. So you get the salt going like yeah, yeah, yeah. Right. And then you fucking throw the sugar down your throat.

Speaker 2:          00:11:19       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:11:20       And you wake up the next day and your, your teeth looked like a fucking fruit punch thing. I Dunno what, anyways, I haven't been boozing out here and I'm out of sorts and um,

Speaker 2:          00:11:30       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:11:31       So now like I guess I'm going to smoke cigars. I can, I just fucking try and do something healthy. I watched this whole thing online that creep me the fuck out about the bacteria in your gut. You know, it was funny as hell actually clicked on this thing and they got me and I thought it was like one of these conspiracy theory videos, but it was actually a, an advertisement thing because for like the first minutes, like an Asshole, I'm watching this and this guy's talking about food in this country, being the United States and he's going just like, he's going like the video. They don't want you to see. And he kept going there. They, this, they that and all this fucking bullshit. And he was just talking about how in your gut you're basically, you have 80, 80% good bacteria and 20% bad bacteria. And if you keep it at that balance, you won't be lethargic, you'll have energy and you'll basically be a healthy person. And it, you know,

Speaker 1:          00:12:24       for the most part, they think that that's the best balance to have, to not get a cancer and that type of shit. So I'm watching the shit and it talking about probiotics foods with probiotics like yogurt and fucking, now, what's that? What's that fucking shit that looks like onions, but it isn't sauerkraut. All right. Looks like caramelized onions and it never turned brown. It looks like me as a caramelized onion, right? Sauerkraut, right? Olives, pickles, that type of shit has probiotic sets the good bacteria in your gut and the 20% shit, uh, that stuff is actually, believe it or not.

Speaker 3:          00:13:06       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:13:07       This is really fucked up. And when you talk about your, your mortality, the 20 plus 20% of the bacteria that what they call a bad bacteria is its job is to basically eat you when you die.

Speaker 1:          00:13:23       I know. I don't know. That's what the video said. I'm not a doctor. Don't take this. You can do the fucking research. So basically because the food and our country is such fucking poison. I guess what is happening to a lot of people is that the 20% is getting too high in the 80 is dropping the good versus the bad and it reaches a tipping point where the, the, the bad bacteria outweighs the good bacteria and it starts taking over and it starts fucking eating away at you. Like you're dead and it can get all the way up and do your fucking brain and you start craving the sugars and the salts. This sound, why I'm talking about the stuff that I don't know if this is true because in the end of it, they of course had a pill that was going to solve all of this and God knows I didn't go to medical school now like you need me to tell you that shit.

Speaker 1:          00:14:17       You could just tell that by the way, I try and read out loud. Right? But anyways, I think the core of what they were saying was true because it sounded good. I'll be totally honest. I didn't look up any of this shit. So I'm like, you know what? Yogurt as probiotics in it. I'll start eating yogurt like a fucking twinkle toes there. So I'm like, fuck it. I'm going to start. I'm going to, what are you going to deal, bill? I'm going to fucking, I'm going to eat some yogurt, right? So what I wanted, but I want to get the good yogurt. All right. I don't want to get the yogurt that just says all natural or says 100% healthy for you. I'm no trans fats and all that shit because you know, those, those, those big time corporate fucking food bankers, they've found a way to get around all of that shit.

Speaker 1:          00:15:07       Basically what they did was they got their own people in the FDA, whatever the fuck it is, they find loopholes where they could, you know, they, they draw a picture of a farm with the sun, the sun behind it, 100% natural, organic and all that in it isn't, you know, they're down, they're beaten the chickens, right. Cutting their beaks off that big fucking breast in the tipping over and Shit. That's, that's basically still what you're reading and they can wait 100% organic and all that crap. They figured out a way around it. So I'm sitting there trying to find like, I looked up all natural yogurt. I'll do it right now. Just bear with me here. All right. Just the amount of, you can't find it. I, or at least I don't know how to find it. I don't know how to find a reputable, reputable, a website that I can trust. Um, that will tell me basically where, where, where the, the re the thing that says 100% organic that actually is organic. So I just looked up organic yogurt.

Speaker 3:          00:16:09       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:16:09       And uh,

Speaker 3:          00:16:11       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:16:12       And this is, this is the stony field.com.

Speaker 3:          00:16:16       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:16:16       That's the one that comes up. I don't know what their deal is. So I click on these guys like Wallaby Yogurt, Straus, family creamery.com. Now that's a great name for a corporate fucking farm is they'll call it the Straus family creamery. Right? Family was fucking whacked them buried underneath the farm. But what killed me is like I go on these, these websites and I click on them and then they have like big, like corporate fuck an advertisement in the side. So it's just like you guys, you guys are in bed with the devil here. I mean maybe these guys are real. Maybe I actually finally, this shit looks real. No, I don't fucking know. It's like when you go to like Edmond's Bluebook or Edmunds and you're trying to find the actual price of a car when you go to buy it and then you look in the side and like Chevrolet's paying for advertising on there like that. It's like a major red flag. It's like if your underlying every car salesman

Speaker 1:          00:17:22       at Chevrolet letting them know what a fucking alumina actually costs you if they still make that fucking thing. The lumen guy, the Lumina, right. Why would they advertise? Does any of this make any sense? Just can you guys tell me where do I go? Where is there a website that can actually tell me where the good food is, where the food is. That stats says it's organic and actually is organic now. Jesus did I just open up a fucking can of worms? That one. All these fucking people are just going to the amount of shit that's going to be written to me and the amount of it that's going to have liberal or Obama, I dunno. You know like what the fuck. I retweeted something the other day about how they're trying to get rid of a lot of the freedom of speech on the Internet.

Speaker 1:          00:18:09       You know the amount of racists on there. I don't know how bad an idea that would be sometimes, but generally speaking they're trying to sell it up, right? So it's just really creepy article about how they're going about doing it and pushing it through congress and all this shit. So I retweet it because it's interesting and I figured maybe somebody smart will look at it and maybe they can do something about it because I'm too fucking stupid. So I retweeted and then somebody writes back. Right. So you're surprised that Obama lied. That's what they write and it's just, I swear to God, those kinds of comments. I actually feel like those people who write those a fake, I don't believe that are actual citizens. I think they work for the government and they do that just to start that stupid Republican Democrat arguing with each other.

Speaker 1:          00:18:56       So nothing gets done. You know what I mean? It's just the assumption that like, it's like I didn't vote for the guy. The guy doesn't control the fucking Internet. He didn't do anything. And the guy fucking makes 400 grand a fucking year, mixed 400 grand a year. He set up to be bribed. That's why I don't vote Democrat or Republican at that level. It's bullshit. It's fucking over. Okay. This is just really interesting. This is going to happen. I'm just trying to get it out there and you're going to, rather than having people read this and if it is true and they want to change it rather than, than going down that road, you're going to try to knock it off fucking course with that bullshit. So, uh, I don't know, am I going to pat myself on the back because I actually didn't take the bait probably cause I only have 18 characters to call this guy at con to whatever the fuck they give you on, on Twitter.

Speaker 1:          00:19:47       But, um, I dunno. Can you do me a favor? Can somebody just for the, for the love of God start a fucking movement where people stop doing that stop fucking gold is because the Republicans forget it. Silver, right. Your arguments over, um, any, I don't know what I'm talking about either guys. Right? I'm fucking wiped out here. Uh, let's, let's do a little bit of advertising. Oh, Jesus. Look who's back.

Speaker 1:          00:24:11       That got me thinking the way I was just thinking. That was weird. All right. Um, let's get back to the podcast. Oh, Ho Ho, Ho. Geez. Um, well, 24 fucking minutes in now, right? What does it, I taught, oh, I gotta tell you this story. [inaudible] um, New Jersey's own Paul Versey the pride of, of, uh, what do we say to try it? Pride of Red Bank. No, he's too dumb to be in red bank will say Trenton. Um, we were working in a Portland, Oregon and we're staying at this fucking hotel. Right? And, uh, there was some sort of a glee club convention of people like 50 years, you know, 40, 50 years old, like they called themselves harmony incorporated and they were having like this regional, um,

Speaker 1:          00:25:04       they were having like this regional, I don't know what this, this sing off thing between these different acapella bands, not banned. They just sing acapella and every year they have a different theme. So this year was superheroes. So there's all these old ladies and guys walking around with Superman capes and they're harmonizing in the fucking lobby, right? So me and Virginia standing outside smoking these cigars, right? It's fucking freezing out and shit, but you can't smoke anywhere anymore. So we're standing outside smoking these things and all of a sudden we see this guy come walking out and he's got like a wife beater on a beer belly and these mutton shops as jet black hair slicked back and a big medallion. I'm thinking he's coming, he's an Elvis impersonator, right? Then he comes walking out and turns out he's like a, he's wolverine from, uh, from x men. He didn't have mutton chops. It went up and around like he had died, his beard, I guess, I don't know what, whatever. And he's got like fucking, he's got this gardener glove with like three butter knives coming out of it and he's got this giant cigar and I'm like, please come out here. I got to talk to this guy. So we'd come out there and he tells us the whole fucking story. And in the middle of us telling the story, his wife is bringing the car around and I swear to God,

Speaker 1:          00:26:22       I said something and I made him laugh and he farted and he didn't address it. Okay. He's standing there dressed like wolverine with these butter knives coming out and he laughed as he was telling this story and it wasn't just like a quick one. It went like sweat a good. I thought he shit himself and he didn't address it and he's sort of like, at one point he just started, he gave one swat behind his ass, like to make it go away. And I, I thought he did it with his regular hand Versie insist that he did it with his butter knife. And either way I eat, he didn't address it and I was sitting there going like, did he just fart? Was that version of you fart it and I fucking looked at VRC in first. He's looking at me, he just had this look on his face like this dude just farted and I had my hoodie up cause it was cold out.

Speaker 1:          00:27:18       I buzzed down my head so my head was fucking cold. So I put my hoodie up and my hoodie up when I was smoking. When I suffers these face, I just turned around and would not, I couldn't look at either one of them and I was laughing my ass off. And fortunately his wife pulled up and I basically, I left Versie by himself versus he had to look at this guy and keep the conversation going after this. He basically sickly sharded right in front of us and never addressed it. And so first he tried to say this, your wife pulling up with the car, but he was laughing. It made no sense. He just said, oh, there's your wife, but you never laugh at that because he just farted. He's like, oh, there's your wife said sound like he was laughing at his wife, like, how fucked up she looked, but she didn't. She was beautiful. And he was like, all right guys, see you later. And he waves with, this is butter knives. And he just fucking got in the car and drove away looking like wolf, like a fat retired Wolverine. Oh my God. We fucking laughed our asses off and we just kept imitating that far.

Speaker 1:          00:28:26       It's like it fucking came around a corner. Um, anyway, it says gross one. Are we, what are we doing here on this fucking podcast? Let's, um, I want, you know what? I just did one of those city towards here in Albany. I had my good friend Tom Lewis come down and he filmed me. I did a tour of this city and that's one of these, these cities like Buffalo, like Cleveland, like Detroit, we use see the beautiful city. There's just no money here to get it going. It's like abandoned buildings and that type of shit. You get a couple of blocks over. It looks like you're in a Baltimore, you know, another great city. It's fucking unbelievable how that happens. So I guess so out here though, they're starting to make more money because they're working on something called a nano something or other, I forget what the fuck it is.

Speaker 1:          00:29:13       It's basically shit that they're going to maybe start putting in food to make it last even longer. Like preservatives don't already make it last fucking longer. I don't, I don't fucking know. Either way it'll get pushed through. People will say it's good and then you'll try it and then some day you'll fucking, I dunno, one of your fetal fall off, which is why I'm just trying to find some fucking yogurt. Can you just find some yoga? I can. I get some probiotics in me. I've watched the advertisement. They got me, they hooked me. All right. But I'm not buying their pill. Fuck them. All right. I want to buy, it's just some yogurt. Can I just get some, can somebody for the love of fucking God, can somebody help me find where the fucking food is? That doesn't kill you. It can somebody do that as I sit here smoking cigars. What a fucking hypocrite. Um, all right, let's, let's read some, uh, some letters for this week.

Speaker 1:          00:30:08       Um, here we go. Plug caps. Podcast helps me fall asleep. Um, dear bill, I've been a fan of yours for years. When you play Cleveland about six years back, I met you and you were so personable and you share this was me. Um, anyways, I had sleeping issues for years. I discovered your Monday morning podcast in your old podcast, a uninformed with Joe de Rosa. I listened to them every night and laugh while your Boston accent and yelling helps me fall asleep. That, that's hilarious. And it takes my mind off my day. I just wanted to say thank you and keep it up. Oh, that was from a lady that might've been like passive aggressive. When she's saying like, just so fucking boring. I fall asleep. Well, uh, you know, either that or you grew up in a household like mine where everyone was fucking screaming at each other. I don't know. Oh, I forgot. I went to the, uh, I went to the Red Sox, take me out to the ball game. I went to that red sox game the day after the, uh, the day after the pine tar incident, which was so fucking stupid. I mean, you know, it's funny as they all know that they do it, and I, I guess it's just to get a better grip on the baseball. So, I mean, it's cheating because they don't allow it, but it's not really cheating. It's actually smart. I mean, you're thrown an object, like close to a hundred miles an hour. You could kill somebody

Speaker 1:          00:31:36       if you're having problems gripping it because it's so fucking cold.

Speaker 1:          00:31:41       Uh, I mean, everybody in baseball, same pine tar does not, it doesn't change the action on the ball. So, uh, I guess that's why they have the rosin bag, which is just powder and powder doesn't work in cold weather. So everybody puts a little glob of it somewhere. I don't fucking know. Um, and I gotta be honest with you, I finally just watched the video and everybody's like, oh my God, dude, it was so obvious. No, it wasn't. It was obvious after they set it and then everybody's like, dude, we could fucking see it from right field now. You couldn't what after it happened? Um, didn't, didn't we all cheer when Mark Mcgwire was hitting the home runs, we all thought it was great. We thought he was doing sex to curls. Then all of a sudden he gets busted or admits to it and then everybody knew, go fuck yourself.

Speaker 1:          00:32:27       I was caught up in it. I went down there with Christmas in my eyes. I thought him and say, I thought if he did, I thought no way. Sammy Sosa did. And then once they find more, both of them broke my heart. Then I thought everybody did. Um, so anyways, we went to the, uh, we went to the red sox game and I went down there with my mom, took my mom to the game and had a great time. We got pounded. It's fucking hilarious. It was like a, I think it was seven to nothing. After three innings, we'd already committed two or three hours committed five for the game by the end of the game. Like some utility outfielder came in and pitched for us and uh, yeah, it was a shit show. It was like a four hour, four hour fucking game at four and five minutes or something like that. And uh, it was freezing cold, but um, I didn't leave, you know, and I learned that from my mom and I was there with my mom so we stayed to the end. And um,

Speaker 3:          00:33:28       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:33:28       Was unreal. We ended up walking out and uh, the Bruins game was still going because it was a,

Speaker 1:          00:33:36       it was an overtime. That's right. Critical game too. We didn't want to want let Detroit back into the series, you know, and tie it up to, to, to this was to go up three to one. And we were walking back to the car and we walked by a bar and the Bruins game was on in there. And I said to my mom, hey, you want, you want to dip in there and watch a little bit of the Bruins? And she's like, sure. So we walked in there, we will literally in there for like 90 seconds. That's all I saw the game, the final 90 seconds in the Douggie Hamilton came down and took the shot, killed a tipped it in and everybody went fucking nuts. And I gotta Tell Ya, I really missed living back here. Just how, uh, sports crazy it is. And it's the teams that I love. Like you're literally, you're at the red sox game and out there they, they, you know, they got the, the old time scoreboard and they still put the Bruins up there,

Speaker 1:          00:34:23       you know, instead of first stating it's first period, second period, third period. Then it got to the old, uh, the overtime. And they left it there for a minute. They like, well we don't have OT. And somebody finally was like, well, just put the four up there, they'll get it. And um, I was a fucking great time. Hey look, an animal back here, all the fucking places I used to eat at when I was in my late teens, early twenties where I could eat that shit and still wake up with a flat stomach as opposed to now looking like a fucking tub of Shit, you know? And uh, ah fuck. I'm driving back from Albany and I'm going to hit another spot before I go to the airport tomorrow. I'm just loading up on it and then I'm lying to myself that I'm going to eat this fucking yogurt, this probiotic shit and I'm going to beat down the bad guys. I'd love to know where I'm at right now. But those fucking things I'll tell you right now. Booze, if booze kills the bad bacteria in your gut,

Speaker 1:          00:35:26       um, I will never decompose. How about that? Huh? Um, anyways, well listen, I'm glad a my podcast helps you a fall asleep I guess that don't tell the advertisers that. Um, yeah, me and Joe Rosa, we got to get that uninformed thing going again. He's a, he's a big fancy guy right now. He's been writing on the wonderful Pete Holmes show and I think they're wrapping their series, um, their season, I should say this week. So maybe me and Joe will, uh, maybe we'll sit down and maybe we'll crank an uninformed out. Who knows? I don't want to keep raising up your hopes because I keep saying that, you know, like that fucking team that makes the playoffs every year and then blows it in the first round. I don't wanna be that. I kind of have been that way though, with the uninformed shit though, so I apologize. Anyways. All right, here's another one. Bill, can I make it? You guys remember that early 80 [inaudible] that didn't last for too long. Making it bake it, it teeth. We'd done a bad blah. We stomped and

Speaker 5:          00:36:31       day we did there Dan. We blab, Blab, La Bake, baking it,

Speaker 1:          00:36:38       these turbid life. I take it is a filter come people no more, no more faking it. I watched every episode you ever do that? You ever watch like every episode of a failed sit calm and when it fails you kind of feel like you failed. Like I'm the only idiot that was watching this shit. I watched hello Larry every episode of that and I loved it. They fucking took that off. I watched every episode of making it my two dads. That's actually an interesting one. Joanie loves Chachi. I watched every episode of that and they just fucking made, it just made me feel dumb. Then I lost all my TV watching self esteem and I just waited until find out what they hits were. Then I would just bandwagon on like cheers moonlighting in that type of shit. Back in the day, how awful was Bruce Willis his haircut in fucking moonlighting? He was doing all he could fucking do. He was starting to lose it. He had like the Fonzi ducktail duck tail or the da in the back and then on top, I don't know what the fuck he was doing. He was poofing it up. Um, either like a balding vampire.

Speaker 3:          00:37:54       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:37:55       Okay. Anyways, a bill. Can I make it? It was like a fucking disco ball and shit in the beginning of it. Did somebody find that? I've actually tried to find it on youtube. I want to say a found at one time, but I've, I've looked it up when imdv I can't find it. I know that the theme song was making it, I think it was, and I want to say the star of the show actually sang the song so he would've got fucking paid that. That's a show Biz thing you might not know. Show me is there, you might not know that if you write the song like the theme song to the show, like you get paid every time they fucking play it. I lost him as that. That's why Merv Griffin, you know, not only did he write those games, you know, create all those game shows, like wheel of fortune and jeopardy. He actually wrote like, you know when you're thinking of shit, that Song Doodoo

Speaker 6:          00:38:46       Doo Doo Doo Doo

Speaker 1:          00:38:48       dude, that fucking thing. He wrote that. So every time they played it, he got paid again. Do you think you, you think you have enough musical ability to come up with something like that?

Speaker 6:          00:38:58       Doo Doo, Doo Doo Doo dude.

Speaker 1:          00:39:01       Do. How far into it could you get? We actually good enough to come up with

Speaker 6:          00:39:05       du Du, Du, Du, Du, Du, du Du du Du,

Speaker 1:          00:39:09       right. That's, that's, that's, that's what makes everybody, that's the hook. Du Du, Du, Du, Du. And then you go, oh, I remember that part from the beginning and then you're fucking in there. It's genius. What a giant head. That guy had no money. We were so smart. You know, he must had a huge fucking brain. I bet the bad bacteria is still munching away on that one, Huh? [inaudible] that's awful. Um, can I make it? Hi there bill. My name is Ben and I'm from Israel. No, you're not. There's nobody named Ben from Israel.

Speaker 2:          00:39:46       Hmm.

Speaker 1:          00:39:46       Ben's we'll visit Israel. I thought that was like an American name. Like Ben Franklin.

Speaker 1:          00:39:56       You know, sometimes I notice how dumb I am. That was one of those moments. Sorry, Ben from Israel. All right. I'm 33 years old of Florida and I've recently decided my dream is to work in comedy. I've written a lot of funny bits, but sadly, the standup scene isn't very developed here. I'm also not a funny guy. He put in quotes, so I feel it might not be for me to, uh, might not be a, I'm going to try to correct this is not, might not be basically my path to perform, even though I write some funny shit. How do you recommend I approached this, uh, practice the only open mic and Israel filled with Weirdos and only once a week, uh, get a funny actor friend to do my material, find amateur nights. I don't want to waste any more time. I want to make some sort of career from comedy. Um, all right, well, unfortunately, sir, you can't rush these kinds of things. I would do all of that. Um, but the, the advantage that you have, because I know you want to do this quickly because you feel like you're 33 years old and you've got to, you got a kid, you gotta you gotta make, make something happen here. Um,

Speaker 1:          00:41:09       you're, you're, you're actually advanced in that you,

Speaker 1:          00:41:13       you understand your strengths and your weaknesses and you're trying to see if you can work on your weaknesses to maybe perform or go to your strength and have somebody else perform it for you. I would try, um, look, the open mic is only once a week. So what the fuck? What does that take it? That's one night out of the week. All right? The rest of the time you can try other, you can try, um, making youtube videos, you can try writing scripts, you can try all of that shit. And the great thing about show business is a, you just start doing it and then you're in the business and if you don't stop, eventually you will start making money. If you write something that people, that appeals to people but you never going to know unless you do it. Um, my biggest advice I would give you is quit thinking about the fact that you're 33 years old and focus more on the fact that it's a dream that you wanted, that you know, that you want to achieve.

Speaker 1:          00:42:09       And, um, you got to go after that stuff in life or else you're going to have regret. Um, what you don't want, you know. So I would just, I would focus on that. Don't quit your day job as they say. Just keep doing that. So everything's good. And then as you start making more money in comedy, eventually you transitioned over. That's all there is to it. So all I got to really say as graduations, Ben, welcome to the world comedy. Have a good fucking time and don't be too hard on yourself. All right. Stay away from the Kuntz negative people and uh, you know, I dunno, there's no comedy scene over there so you can create one. How about that? They get Gulf. Jesus Christ has got to be plenty of shit to talk about there. All that stuff going on. Huh? You know what she should do? Why don't you start a fucking in Israeli Palestinian comedy night? You know, you guys all hang out and get along and then they can do a local piece going, you know, maybe politically leads still sides don't get along well when it comes to laughing. They all speak the same language. My name is Susie Sunquest. Here's my cleavage and I'm standing in front of the first comedy club and his meal. Let's go over and talk to Ben. Ben, how did you come up with,

Speaker 1:          00:43:31       did comedy with your mortal enemy? Yeah. You know, fucking things right there. It's wide open. It's wide open. It's like when Vegas first starts, they're waiting for you to open the casino.

Speaker 1:          00:43:42       Alright, there you go. All right. What do we got here? Girlfriends. Withdrawal. She's withdrawing dear bill Nye the illiterate guy and you know it's funny. That's a funny joke and I blew it because I can't read out loud because I'm kind of illiterate. Dear Bill Nye the literate guy, a big fan of your podcast. Looking forward to others. I'll get right to it. My girlfriend and I have a very active sex life. We've been trying to say, we've been trying to stay, sorry. I'm still thinking of why that green thumb made me laugh and I'm not going to fucking tell you why. I'm a big fan of his specials. Looking forward to others. I'll get right to it. My girlfriend and I have have a very active sex life and we've been trying to stay safe during and she recently suggest during what? And she recently suggested that we withhold from sex until she obtains birth control. Well, Jesus Christ. Yes. My issue is that the apartment is a month and a half away. Oh, Jesus Christ. Dude, fucking rub one out. Said my bs meter is going crazy on this. All of a sudden we can't use a condom anymore. Do you think this is caused from more concern or am I just being paranoid? Thanks in advance and go fuck yourself. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. That's interesting. I didn't even look at it that way. Let me reread this. Uh,

Speaker 1:          00:45:08       my girlfriend, I have a very active sex life. We've been trying to stay safe during this time. She recently suggested that we withhold from sex until she obtains birth control. All right. And then it's a month and a half away. My bs meters going crazy. All of a sudden we can't use even use a condom anymore. No, I don't think that's cause for concern.

Speaker 3:          00:45:27       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:45:28       What do you think? What do you think she's doing?

Speaker 3:          00:45:30       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:45:31       That's not cause for concern. That's a, you know, you will get in the cookie and now she took the cookies away and you're kind of upset about it.

Speaker 7:          00:45:37       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:45:40       I Dunno. You're a young guy, so you want to fuck every day. And I imagine a month and a half seems like a million miles away. I'm an older guy, so I'm like, yeah, I'll give a shit joke off like twice. I can do six weeks.

Speaker 7:          00:45:55       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:45:56       Um, no I wouldn't, she might have. Maybe one of her friends had an issue and it scared the shit out of her and I don't know what, but, um, what I would do is I would sit down

Speaker 3:          00:46:09       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:46:09       And talk to her about it without being accusatory. And I would just say, listen, I just want to talk to you about, uh, the whole birth control thing if we could. And there's nothing women enjoy better than that guy actually saying, I would like to sit down and discuss something in a relationship. They love doing that. At least the ones that Ma, you know, unless they're wired like a guy and if they get it, they're like, oh my God, shut up and just say, listen, you know, we've

Speaker 1:          00:46:37       Ben, obviously we've had a great sex life. Yeah. And you know, I love you. You got to do that bullshit. That's like the beginning of a sweet chili welcome. Everybody laggy you for copy because this is an auditive they out here. That's what you're doing. You know I love you. You're beautiful. Yeah, we'll, we'll, we'll, and then you get to the fucking point. Just say, listen, we had a very active sex life. We've been using a condom, nothing's ever happened and all of a sudden I understand you want to be on birth control, which is cool. I'm just making sure if there's no other issue.

Speaker 3:          00:47:05       Yeah.

Speaker 7:          00:47:06       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:47:08       You know, because you know, I find you really attractive as six weeks is a long ways away at a, I was just wondering why we couldn't continue to use a condom. I'm not pressuring you. I'm just asking cause I really want to fuck you. No, don't say that last part. That's what I would do. You Scots to sit and talk to your bitch, motherfucker. Um, I'm married, I'm not dead. Dare bill bill the beguiling. I don't even know what that means. You know what's funny you guys all the time. I'll writing in it and saying how good I am at giving out advice. I am the classic person that's good at giving out advice in that I give out great advice and then continue to walk around and being a complete fucking idiot. You know, I got it. I got everything that I just said to that fucking guy. I should be saying to myself, why don't I do that? Why don't I sit down and just say, hey, you know, I love you and I think you'd go, I just want to thank you for being here. Come together as a evening and then just be able to calmly,

Speaker 1:          00:48:20       I dunno, I got to get rid of this fucking anchorman. It's, it's, I got to get rid of this shit. You know, I don't have to get rid of it, but it can't be the default fucking emotion. Like when I was driving across from mine and New Hampshire down to Portland, Maine going across route to the amount of times a mild heart attack is, I'm flipping out about the douchebag driving in front of me only to finally, you know, when it becomes two lanes, go past them and see it's a cute little old lady and that's why they're driving slow. You think I would learn the lesson like, oh, you know, there's some old people out here, Bill, why don't you relax the Serb country? They do things a little slower up here. You know, I did. I just kept making the same mistake over and fucking over again driving like a maniac. You know, I made the decision to get off the fucking highway. You know what happens? You know you're going to end up behind some pickup truck pulling a couple of fucking horses for a good hour and I still got mad at me. I'm an idiot. I really have to conquer that. If anybody knows how to fucking I go through ebbs and flows where I'll be, my anger issues will be way, way better.

Speaker 1:          00:49:32       The end. They're still completely unacceptable as far as he likes to say. Um, but then, then they start ramping up again and it's just a fucking embarrassing. All right. Anyways, I'm married. I'm not dead deer build a beguiling. What the fuck does that mean?

Speaker 1:          00:49:51       Look at that like right there. What the fuck does that mean? Why couldn't I have been like, oh, I wonder what that means. Oh, a new world, new word, new worlds, new word. And this is, this is just a wonderful opportunity to learn something here in my own point cans and you know, and you know, he learned a lot. I looked Jaycees much remain leaking urine. Why do you, why can I do that? Right? But guile, charm or enhance parentheses, someone sometime in a deceptive way. Okay. So this is sort of a compliment, but not really. Okay, here we go. Now, recently

Speaker 3:          00:50:28       I've been talking to a friend that I haven't heard from in a while via Facebook. Oh, here we go. Uh, we continued to talk and catch up and I found out he is married and has a two year old. While that's fucking hilarious. That should come out immediately.

Speaker 1:          00:50:47       All right. While away someone,

Speaker 1:          00:50:51       he asked me to wait while away somewhere. Oh, when he was on the Internet, he asked me to send him some sexy pictures. See right there. The fact that you had to, we went back and forth a number of times before. He said he's married and has a two year old. That's not a good, that should be immediately, boom. He's supposed to do that immediately. I'm married. Boom. Done. All right, so this doesn't go on a weird fucking way because we used to fuck right. Isn't that what's supposed to happen? Um, and he said, I said, I said no and responded, aren't you married? He replied, I'm married. I'm not dead. God. He's also been flirting with me a lot. I think it's disrespectful to his wife and to ask me for something like that when I'm sure it would, it would help his marriage by making her feel attractive. If he asked her what, this was such an interesting email. Did I read it wrong? I think it is disrespectful to his wife to ask me for something like that when I'm sure it would. I'm just gonna say what and wouldn't help his marriage by making her feel attractive. I'm sure it would help his Oh, help his marriage if he asked her to send him some pictures. Uh, okay. Some sexy pictures. See she said, I also think the flirting is disrespectful. Um, a lady, by the way. What do you think? Um,

Speaker 1:          00:52:24       well yeah, you're obviously right, but I am also wanting, why do you continue to talk to this guy? You reached out to him. You didn't know he was married. Okay. He doesn't say he's married.

Speaker 3:          00:52:37       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:52:38       So it starts to, obviously it started to go down, so I know. No, no, no, no, no. And then he's, then you find out he was married, had a two year old. All right. So he keeps it going. And then when he's away, he asked you to send him some sexy pictures and you responded and you said No. And you said, aren't you married? You knew he was married. He said he was married. Why did you keep hanging around and now he's continuing to flirt with you. Why are you still talking to this guy? What's going on with you? Yeah. Why? Why are you, why are you continuing to talk to this guy? This is a no brainer. Yeah. He shouldn't be doing this.

Speaker 3:          00:53:14       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:53:15       This is completely not what you supposed to be doing if you are married. All right. I'm not judging anybody in this fucking thing. I'm just saying that he shouldn't be doing that. And if you're offended by it, you shouldn't continue to talk to the guy. So, okay. So I guess, okay, so wait, so he doesn't, you don't send them the pictures, but you continue to talk to him then he's been flirting with you and you just think it's disrespectful? Uh, yeah. I mean I don't, yeah. Yeah. It's, it's disrespectful because he already said the sexy pictures thing, so it already brought it into a bad fucking,

Speaker 3:          00:53:56       yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:53:57       This guy would bang you if you'd let them basically. So he already brought it into a bad area. Um, do I think flirting is disrespectful online? Absolutely. If you're at work. I mean, I don't give a shit. You know what? I Made Jesus Christ. We're at work. I don't know. It depends on the level of it, but you know, what are you suppose to fucking do? Like I'm not one of those guys. If I drive down the street, okay, look, I gotta tell you this. When I was in la,

Speaker 3:          00:54:30       yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:54:30       I was at a stoplight by myself and this dude jogging by, I swear to God, he looked like, like marvel comics couldn't draw a more jacked guy. Like I looked at him and I went, Jesus Christ, his back was shredded. The guy had no fat on him whatsoever and he's jogging down the street, no shirt on, no nothing. I mean, this guy must be fucking everything in Hollywood. Even. I'm sitting there going, Jesus Christ. Now, if my wife was there, I I, what am I going to do? He wins. I'll tell you right now, if I ran down the street with my shirt off, that would be the end of my career. So what am I going to do? I'm going to get mad that she's looking at this fucking statute was God damn Greek. God running down the fucking street, Greek God via Africa. You know what? I want to go, Hey, what the fuck? I don't give a shit. I really don't give a shit.

Speaker 3:          00:55:33       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:55:33       I don't, I don't know. You don't want to talk to me when it comes to this stipend, it's, it's one of these, when I look at that stuff, like I always look at it like it shouldn't be done. It's the Chris Rock, but you shouldn't do it. But I understand it's fucking a that. That's why the Internet, it's terrible. It's terrible when it comes to that shit because back in the day you wouldn't be able to get in touch. Tom Green has this fucking unbelievable bid on this watch is special. I hope he did his bid on Facebook. He, he does this fucking unbelievable bid on it. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:56:11       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:56:11       Well, it's just, it's just there. It's just fucking there. It's, it's harder than ever. Not to fuck around. I guess. I don't know. But is he doing something wrong? Yeah, but your co I don't why you, I would ask yourself why you're still a, you're still talking to the person. I mean, you reached out. That's what I'm guessing you reached out to them because you're single right now is what I'm guessing this was somebody maybe you had a fling with back in the day or a, you know, maybe you always want it to, when you reached out,

Speaker 1:          00:56:46       maybe that's what you're doing and then all of a sudden, you know, you find out he's married and has a kid and then they all of a sudden he shows that he would fuck around on his wife and you're like, wow, this isn't, the guy thought he was. So you continued to do more follow up questions just so you in your own way. You can get this guy out of your head because you've seen what a dirt bag is. I got to tell you this, I'm married, I'm not dead, is a fucking terrible line. That's the line you say to your guy friend in the bar,

Speaker 2:          00:57:14       you know,

Speaker 1:          00:57:15       and she fucking says blah, blah, blah, blah. I'm like, you know, can't believe she said that. I mean, I'm fucking married. I'm not dead. That's something you see to what gain. I say that to a woman. Jesus Christ. That's terrible. That's just blunt force trauma of truth. It's a one two punch. He shouldn't have done that. All right. Whatever. I don't know what to tell you. I would just say stop talking to them. Does that work? Does that work for you? I don't fucking know.

I got to you gotta see this, this kid is absolutely adorable. It's funny because like he's into like six year old stuff. Like he likes Mike Tyson. Mike Tyson is his favorite and he basically likes him because Mike had a tiger and he wants to get a tiger, like how adorable is and you're like, oh my God, this kid's fucking adorable.

So you know, you might as well just go to the grocery store.
