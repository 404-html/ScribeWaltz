Speaker 1:          00:00:00       Hey, what's going on is bill burr and it's the Monday morning podcast for Monday, May 27th, 2013 I don't like the way I just said. Um, Monday. Um, you have to catch yourself. Sounded like a Douche. They're happy. Memorial Day. Happy Memorial Day. A Beautiful Tab to thank the troops and stuck. Give stuff your mother fucking face with Shit. All right. Isn't that what you're doing? Let's all have a moment of silence for everyone who made a sacrifice for this country. Alright, right. Let's go stuff our faces, right? Isn't that what it, isn't that what every fucking holiday is? Flag Day. Today is a day.

Speaker 2:          00:00:50       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:00:51       Joe, Roman by, I remember, I remember all the flags set up wave though about those contract Godrej projects

Speaker 1:          00:01:00       and allies. Stuff our faces, faces, faces. Let's get drunk and have a fight with a mother's mother's mother's mother's. You know, isn't that what it is? How many people are actually going to go to a fucking parade today from the halls up Ooma to the shores of Tripoli? Huh? Who can sing beyond that fucking two lines other than a goddamn ex marine or a current marine, one or the other. Is that what they do? And when you, when you joined the marines, by the way, do you have to sing that song at some drill sergeant is in your face. Hey you, you fucking screaming.

Speaker 1:          00:01:45       Oh Shit. They're single arc. One of them. Of course. Right. I commend anybody who's in the military service simply for the ability to get through bootcamp and having somebody screaming in your face and just pushing down every ounce of your being to not like just punch that guy right in the fucking face. This is thing like, I've thought about that Shit, right? Like let's say thanks, get really fucked up and all of a sudden they want to draft soon to be 45 year old balding red heads like myself. And I've actually thought about for some reason I think I think about it whenever I do pull ups because whenever I do pull ups or climbing the rope, I always think you think I could make it through fucking maybe three obstacles.

Speaker 2:          00:02:33       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:02:34       Three obstacles in one of those bootcamp. Thanks. I could get up the fucking rope. I probably couldn't do the required amount of pullups, but I wonder if I could just get out of the drill sergeant. You know, I'll still take care of Claire. I haven't pressed, where's your upper body strike you all right. Get the fuck out my face. Right. Can I at least get one of those? But my thing is if someone screaming in my ear like that, like I got, I got tonight is what our tetanus, however the fuck you say. I have it one of my years. So if the guy screaming in my ears, I'd have to be like, yeah, skills me. Uh, I guess I'm not trying to not be Maureen light, but I just wanna let you know when I played a lot of drums and my ears are very sensitive. If you could just, uh, you don't even continue with the insults. I'm not trying to tell you how to do your job, but if you could just somehow bring the volume down, you know, and then immediately I'm pile because everybody else has to start doing pushups.

Speaker 1:          00:03:34       Is this quiet enough for you? Private bar.

Speaker 3:          00:03:37       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:03:38       Look at the rest of your platoon sitting here doing pushups. Cause you don't want me to yell too loud. Just exactly. How quiet do you think warriors, you redheaded freckled fucking faggot. Right? There's no way that they have a city. It's always the homophobic shit is not what they come at you with. Huh? I bet you're sucking Dick.

Speaker 4:          00:04:01       Right.

Speaker 1:          00:04:05       You know what? I actually shouldn't say any of this because I have no idea what they say to you other than what I've watched in movies, you know. So anyways, Happy Memorial Day, a beautiful time to thank the troops and stuff he fucking face with some shit. Um, that should be the official memorial day. I think the only people who truly appreciate it are people who have actually served and know people who have served

Speaker 3:          00:04:35       know

Speaker 1:          00:04:37       that would be my really built. He really think that the people who are closest to it appreciate it the most. What other groundbreaking things are you going to say in this podcast? Oh, I know. I know. I'm a moron. All right. Can you just let me have my moment? Can you well, all right then.

Speaker 3:          00:04:56       MMM,

Speaker 1:          00:04:58       I'm in New York City right now. I'm in my old up Budnick loneliest shit. I Dunno how he used to do this as a single man

Speaker 3:          00:05:08       at all.

Speaker 1:          00:05:11       Although I have to tell you it's a, you guys know the comedian, not Ted Alexandro if you don't, you showed he's one of the best fucking comics out there. He used to have this great joke. I'll just do the gist of it cause I don't want to fucking burn Joe. He used to just say that basically it was essentially that, you know, being single, it's sucked at night cause you will lonely. But it was great for the rest of the day.

Speaker 1:          00:05:37       I can't say I'm feeling that, but I do have to. I have to concur with that joke that at nighttime when you fucking go home by yourself, that's when it gets to you. I think it was when you wake up in the morning, you have errands to run, you got to, I'm going to go to the gym. You know, there's hope. That's what it is. This hope that you're going to find somebody, you know, when at night all that hope is gone and it's just you, a pint of ice cream and a slice of pizza, you know, solely crying as you crying softly as you're chewing, getting down to the crust. Um, actually, you know, I, I've, um,

Speaker 1:          00:06:20       I've made a rule that this time when I go through in New York, I'm not having any pizza and I'm not having any ice cream. And I know what you thinking, Bill, you're in New York City. You have to have the pizza. Okay, well, I'm going to tell you what, I've had enough New York pizza to last me a fucking lifetime. First of all, 90% of New York pizza sucks a giant pizza cock because it doesn't make any sense. Um, it doesn't make sense simply because there's so many people living off the fucking reputation that New York has great pizza.

Speaker 3:          00:06:53       You know,

Speaker 1:          00:06:55       that's the problem. New York does have great pizza, but there's no laws prohibiting anybody from opening a pizza shop saying the best pizza in New York City,

Speaker 3:          00:07:06       you know,

Speaker 1:          00:07:08       it's fucking horrific. Maybe if I do danger fields or go over to that Sutton pizza, they're over on first avenue. I always liked have pizza and a nice fucking zip over there and I zipped to the sauce there. Nice Little Tang near Nice little, what the fuck was that? Their in their uh, in their pizza slices,

Speaker 3:          00:07:27       you know,

Speaker 1:          00:07:29       I don't know. Pizza is always that shit. You're like stumbling home after a couple, two, three fucking whiskeys. Right. And then you fucking, uh, I dunno what I mean, what the Hell I'm saying you got to realize I have to get a fucking appointment book cause I just realized how much shit I just planned for tomorrow.

Speaker 3:          00:07:44       You know

Speaker 1:          00:07:45       I'm going to get a steak fucking dinner with Joey roses and Keith Robinson. Somebody over at the stand comedy club, the head chef over there is going to teach me how to make the fucking pizza pie over there.

Speaker 3:          00:07:59       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:08:02       Cause I got the big green egg and I can heat that fucker up to 700 degrees. Do you guys even know what I'm talking about? Just realize that I bought this, this big green egg, this barbecue where in a smoker and they give you this book showing you all the wonderful shit that you can make on it. And all I've made on it is burgers, hot dog and fucking chicken. So I want to take it to the next level. I want to be able to make a pizza. But you gotta know how to make your own fucking dope.

Speaker 3:          00:08:27       You know,

Speaker 1:          00:08:29       which I don't know how to do. So I'm going to have this person show me how to do it because I'm a fucking seat, right? I'm always trying something new. Oh, what's that? What's that bill up to the to fucking today. Anyways, how about those Bruins? Huh? Hey are we go bro? And we go. That's how it used to be. That's the chant that used to get going back in the days in the old Boston guy. Now they go, let's go, Bro wins and I'm telling you, that's the ranger champ. Who is, here we go, Bro. Ones. Here we go. And let's go. Rangers. All right, well you know where the range, is it going now out to the fucking golf course because yes, the Bruins and one short week went to the fucking Mecca,

Speaker 1:          00:09:21       Madison Square Garden and in five games it was actually a five game sweep. Who's kidding? Who? You know, not to take anything away from the Rangers, but I've got it all right. When the whole rally on your side gets going, cause our goalie fell down. I want, have you ever a goalie? He just falls down like some kid playing peewee hockey and then he tried to go out. There was a Rut in the ice. You fell down. Took. It's okay. It happens to the best of us. Go down to a public, Rick, you see it all the time. My favorite thing in a public rink is watching that guy who where it takes like 12 seconds for him to fall. [inaudible] I've ever, oh right. The fucking six going backwards. Six going forward. Right. And then the fucking Bam, and it's usually the back hits first and then the fucking whiplash and then the head makes that nice hollow coconut pook right off the fucking ice. That unmistakable sound of somebody squash hitting a sheet of ice.

Speaker 1:          00:10:32       That's a fuck as an incredible sound. You know what? And I don't think that that can be reproduced by Hollywood unless you actually had somebody slammed the head on it. That's incredible. Not even with one of those Casio keyboards that has access to over a thousand sound effects. They never have to even notice that they never have the sound effect of a head hitting the asphalt or a, or a sheet of ice. So there's one few nerds. What does it somebody out there, you know, when are you Photoshop concept? They're trying to get me up the perfect that, that perfect sound effect and sent it to me and I'll have my first sound effect on the podcast. You know, and I'll turn this into a wacky morning show. And every time I say something dumb, I go, oh, what was I thinking? And then I'll click the button and then you'll hear it and then your laugh.

Speaker 2:          00:11:17       Okay?

Speaker 1:          00:11:18       Then you'll be in the parking lot at your job holding onto the steering wheel 10 and two just staring at that front door that you don't want to walk through. It's having those last few moments to yourself thinking about all the decisions you've made over the last 12 years. Why did I break up with her? Why did they major in this? Why did they buy this car? Okay, why can't I feel feelings anymore? Is Your eyes well up with tears? Just look up at the heavens. Wonder if there's some old guy up there that gives a fuck you Christ softly. And then for some unexplained reason, you look over to the left and this is your boss stare at you. But this weird look on his face. Like is that my crying in his fucking car?

Speaker 2:          00:12:26       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:12:27       She quickly tried to play it off. Like you sneeze, you take a big deep breath and you push all those fucking feelings down. You like it and you get out of the car. Hey Paul, they boss. Are you doing and I allergies. Allergies. All right. Yo. See in there you have can't wait. I'm sorry. Anyways, so the Bruins are now going to go play the, the, the most confusing franchise in, uh, in, in um, in Nhl law, in the NHL. I don't know how to feel about the fucking penguins. I totally respect him and I'm fucking blown away by their ability to somehow always get the guy that's the next guy. I mean, it's insane. I liked in the last 20 years, 25 years, I would actually put them beyond the Yankees. Yeah. Wait a minute. Or I would, I would know. I would compare him to the Yankees.

Speaker 3:          00:13:28       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:13:30       When the, when, when the Yankees, you know, got a babe Ruth and Lou Gehrig. Then Joe Dimaggio, Mickey Mantle. I would actually that this is the closest thing you've seen where they, the penguins, Mario Lemieux. Jaromir Jaga um, Sidney Crosby, it fucking Gino market. I don't want to say [inaudible] [inaudible] and Denny, I don't know how to fucking say these hockey names nowadays. I used to be shocks all these French fucking names. So that was easy, right? Michelle Goulay oh, shoots. He scores.

Speaker 3:          00:14:07       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:14:10       Fucking for absolute snipers. I mean, unbelievable fucking top notch goddamn players. It's incredible, right? They have that. And then on the other side, right. And then whenever they get hit, they're like, you know, Mario [inaudible], you know, if people don't stop cheating, I'm not gonna play anymore. Alright. Yoga was always like, oh, he's got a mullet and he just loves those Kit Kats.

Speaker 2:          00:14:39       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:14:39       Late some all the time. So people flew us. Why? You know, he scored all those goals. Well, I'll tell you, I wish I knew that when I'd Floyd. All right. Sidney Crosby, big pouty lips. Fucking cub scout dead. He is, you know.

Speaker 2:          00:14:54       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:14:55       But say hate about that guy. Other than the fact that you know, he doesn't do anything wrong in life.

Speaker 2:          00:15:01       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:15:02       Help an old people cross the street. Even with the skates on runs out of the arena, is that an old person trying to cross the street? Just a fucking Wheaties cereal box cover look and son of a bitch. Why is he a son of a bitch? Because you know he's better than you head and shoulders. The best fucking guy in the league. Then he got milk guy who could be a fucking cunt and be like, Hey, what about me? He doesn't give a shit. He just plays his Goddamn game and his tremendous, all right,

Speaker 1:          00:15:36       it's a great fucking hockey town. They had one of the great last arenas, that Mellon arena, Carnegie Mellon, Heinz, whatever the fuck they called it, Goddamn Pittsburgh people. They got three names for everything. See the Heinz Carnegie, Carnegie Mellon or just melon? I guess that's four, but was really just Carnegie Mellon. Just all fucking remix like p. He's in there. By the way, the more years that goes by, that biggie has been dead and, and his legend just keeps growing and growing with the fact that nobody's ever matched that guy's ability with humor, storytelling, and being able to paint a fucking picture. Forget about his charisma. His last time you saw a guy even remotely with the fucking charisma, that guy. All right. As the years go by and you keep going back frustrated with the new shit, and you just keep going back to that, that mumbling fucking shit that puffy does on every fucking track, it's, it's like it's kicked somebody out there. Send me some fucking biggie tracks, will you? You removed Tahfeeth going, that's right.

Speaker 2:          00:16:50       Uh Huh.

Speaker 1:          00:16:52       Okay. And the fucking pack round, whatever the fuck he says. Oh, just repeats every guide that the last word of every line that big, he says, it's like we heard it. Was it an enough for you to be in there with the fucking faders, pushing those up and down? I've got to listen to your mumbling jackass. I tell you one of the worst fucking rap songs ever was when he and that other mumbling jacket, Mace County

Speaker 1:          00:17:18       who've had those, that how he heard the guy to do. You know what? Tell me which one to use fucking rapping because I can't tell the it, why am I this upset? Anyways, let's, let's, let's dial it down, but style down, let's get back to the fucking, to the SBA. Okay, I'm agreeing with him. Um, oh fuck. So that's one side of the penguins. And then on the other side of the penguins and, and you know, Crosby bitch moaning and complaining, Mario Lemieux bitch moaning and complaining about the thuggery, the cheating and all that fucking shit. And then like right in their own goddamn locker room,

Speaker 3:          00:17:59       they have had

Speaker 1:          00:18:01       the exact same thing where you had the Ruth Dimaggio and Mickey Mantle of Lou Gehrig. They've had that of the fucking biggest God damn need breakers, cheat and sons of bitches ever. You know, I have this love hate with the penguins. You know, I love him because I respect the franchise and I hate them because not because they have these cheat and constant fucking just go out there and try and end people's careers. It's the fact that they then have the balls.

Speaker 2:          00:18:33       Okay to bitch. You hope those are kind of walking. The yard loaders are going to deploy them in order. You know why we're even in this week.

Speaker 1:          00:18:42       He wanted to get fucking Matt Cook in 35 years of watching people play hockey. I've never seen a guy check somebody in the boards and accidentally completely sever the guy's fucking Achilles tendon.

Speaker 3:          00:18:56       How does that happen? I don't know.

Speaker 1:          00:19:00       They say it was a fucking accident and I, if it was anybody else I would've believed it. You know what the sad thing about Mac cookies is a guy can actually play. He's a fucking great player and he's definitely toned down his shit. But I mean I can't have a, forgive the guy cause he ended Savardi career guys on a follow through of a fucking shot could not be more vulnerable. And you come by 30 miles an hour and hit him with that plastic shoulder blade would pad, which is like hitting somebody crossed the job with a fucking wrench and you end his God damn career. Unbelievable. I'm fucking so this is going to be a,

Speaker 2:          00:19:36       okay,

Speaker 1:          00:19:37       this is going to be a brutal series.

Speaker 3:          00:19:39       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:19:42       The only fucking weak part I can see on the penguins is the, they have shaky goaltending

Speaker 2:          00:19:49       yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:19:50       You know, but just their offensive power. I just, I am,

Speaker 3:          00:19:55       I dunno,

Speaker 1:          00:19:57       my heart says Bruins, but if I was putting money on it, I mean I would say penguins. It's six, nine, it was a lot of bronze finish. Go let your flag waving flags and Shane do you what? You, you fucking get no weird. Now that you live in out fucking la. Good. Now I just watch enough hockey and I've seen what the fuck they're capable of. Like Sidney Crosby is literally unstoppable.

Speaker 2:          00:20:19       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:20:19       You don't fucking stoppable. And if they just had one guy like that, you know, like the capitals and Ovechkin is nowhere near a Crosby. Although he had a great year.

Speaker 3:          00:20:30       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:20:31       Now I'm going to have those guys fucking wine into me

Speaker 2:          00:20:35       total.

Speaker 3:          00:20:36       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:20:40       If he just fucking had him. But the fact that you have all those other guys, you know, Malkin and all those guys, it's good. It's going to be fucking,

Speaker 1:          00:20:50       I dunno how he, I, you know what I'm calling it right now. We were going to play the trap. We're going to try and play that boring ass fucking hockey and it's going to kill me. I'm going to have to watch because it's my team. But I want before anybody sends me the emails, no, I don't enjoy watching it. Even if we win a game, I don't like it because, uh, I really enjoyed watching the, uh, penguins senators series, even though that one last game was that seven goal game was a fucking, was a blowout. Um, oh, by the way, once again, you know, a lot of people explain to me why there was such hatred towards a maple leaf fans, Toronto in general and all that type of thing. And everybody was saying that basically that that's the biggest city in Canada and that's where like all the media is so, because all the media is there, it's like everybody in Toronto then thinks the whole fucking country of the whole world revolves around them. I'm not saying it's true, I'm an outsider, but that's what they say. But it reminded me kindness kind of like, like New Yorkers, you know what I mean?

Speaker 2:          00:21:55       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:21:56       Like they just think everything begins at fucking ends, you know, with like mad. And the only reason I Madison Square Garden is this Mecca is because it's in the middle of the biggest fucking city with all this media here, you know? And a lot of New Yorkers, they really confused that it's a mecca. Yeah. That's just a gathering place.

Speaker 2:          00:22:17       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:22:17       People come and play hoop there because that's where they can make the most amount of fucking money and get the most amount of media exposure. But that has nothing to do with the Knicks are how good.

Speaker 2:          00:22:29       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:22:30       Oh the, the, the legendary. The Knicks are not legendary. They're not all right with spike Lee sitting court side. You're fucking low rent. Jack Nicholson. Oh, woody Allen with his awful hat. Jesus Christ, you know, at least La, they have the decency to get their faces laminated. If you're going to be the celebrity sitting on the side, just fucking with you anyway. So the next route, the rangers are out cause of the Boston Bruins. And uh, once again, the garden is silent and it's ready for the circus.

Speaker 1:          00:23:18       The Mecca [inaudible]. That's their fucking, that's what happens every goddamn yet you realize the rangers have one, one Stanley Cup and the less 73 fucking years you understand that. Do you realize that in like the fucking 60 something years that the NBA has been around the uh, New York Knicks? If one, only two titles, two titles. Last one. That one was in 1973 Oh, let's do the math on that one. That was 40 fucking years ago. That's a verse he kills me. The guard was rocking last night. He's always telling me how loud the is. I'm fucking believable. Rarely. Okay. Louder than the fucking piece of shit. TDF, Xyz Garden, whatever the fuck they call the Boston Garden. No, when the boys came back down, fucking three goals and a game. Seven. Was it louder than that Paul? Versey I'm asking you. Um, all right. You're listening to the Monday morning podcast here.

And you know, I'm hoping you leave me behind some day. I'll be reading an ad for your company there. Hey, let's keep, let's keep talking with the sports here. All right. Who's kidding? Who? I don't watch that much NBA hoop. I don't, I really, I like it. I know I shit on it a lot. But uh, I got to tell you that Dwayne Wade flying fucking elbow. All right. Now it did look like he was trying to leap over the guy, but at the last second there was no fucking reason to do what he did was like a wrestling move. And I know it's debatable, but what killed me was Reggie Miller and the other commentator or Steve Carr immediately the first reviewing of it just go. Yeah, that wasn't intentional at all. That's that, you know, it's, it's part of the natural bodily movement when you leap into the air, like one of your elbows just sticks out like that to give somebody a forearm shiver. He fucking gave the guy

Speaker 1:          00:30:03       an impromptu flying elbow. That's what I think had he leapt in the air, you know, cause they were kind of crossing over each other in a weird way. He jumped over the guy and was like, oh, there's his head man. Boy, I ain't going to fucking write their friend out. He liked the game. One of those, the guy collapses in a fucking heat. Although I heard he's known for flopping, but it just killed me. That just automatically deny him. Holy Shit. Look at that elbow. Oh wait, that's one of the superstars of the league. You know? I don't think that there was anything, there was no malicious act. Just, it's ridiculous. If that happened at Dwayne Wade and he went down, I swear to God, both of them, would it be like, see now that, that right there, that's the kind of thing that just does not belong in this game at this level or, or at any level for that matter.

Speaker 1:          00:30:56       You know? I mean, there's kids at home watching this game. I mean, that's just a little look at that. Let's watch this again. I mean, oh, that's just disgraceful. That's just, I mean it just premeditated. I'll tell you the legs got to take a look at this at all. I would be really surprised if that gentleman was plaguing a next, uh, the next contest. Fucking superstar does it. Ah, you know, he didn't mean anything by that, you know, he's kind of a, I mean, he was in the area, had flap his wings like a bird, you know, he doesn't have any feathers, so he's got to tuck his, his, his hands back towards his torso. It's very normal, very normal right there. Um, that's it. That's all I know about hoop this week. Other than him pulling for the paces, who else is playing? WHO's out in the West? I love, you know what I love, I love the spurs and their white guy basketball that they play. I absolutely love. They are fundamentally sound. Pick and roll. Fucking kiss it off the glass. I can't jump either game that they played this tremendous, there's not a lot of white guys out there doing it, but when I, when I watched the spurs play, that's, it looks like five white guys playing pickup at the y and it, and it's effective. I don't know how they do it. So who are they playing? They're playing the grizzlies.

Speaker 3:          00:32:14       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:32:17       I don't give a shit. I'm just so elated that the Lakers aren't in it. So fucking a lady absolutely love it. And I hope Dwight Howard stays with the Lakers the same way I've enjoyed.

Speaker 3:          00:32:30       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:32:31       What's his face? Alex Rodriquez steak

Speaker 1:          00:32:35       with the New York Yankees. Alex Rodriguez is my most favorite Yankee of all fucking time, you know, is they try to shame him out of town and he's just like, ah, you know, I, you know, you want me to sit down at a playoff game? I don't give a fuck. I'm not leaving that contract. Go fuck yourselves. I'm staying. I love it. I absolutely love it. Um, actually, what's your really disturbing a youtube video last night? I'm trying to think of how the hell I got there. I was watching animals and I was watching these two little fucking weird things. They can't see that. Well their heartbeat when they're nervous can go up to like 1300 beats per minute. You know, like somebody trying to win one of those fastest hands, single stroke roll drunk contest. They fucking, they can beat them with their heart. They can't see that well and uh, I dunno, they basically they have to live meal to meal, their heartbeats so fucking fast that if they miss a meal they could actually die. The sleuth of sloths. I don't know what the fuck this thing was, but all I know they don't see that well and they, two of them don't see each other too. They literally run into each other. I got to find this fucking video

Speaker 1:          00:33:59       and they just had this, does this sickest fight I've ever seen in my life. Like they had to slow it down. Look, when they were showing it, they go and this is not sped up footage. This is how fast these guys, it was like watching two flyweights times like, you know, to the fifth power. So I'm watching that shit, which leads to more shit. And then I see like these, these, these bloodhounds getting fed, doing all that shit. Next thing and you know, you just give me, just keep looking to the right and it's more, you know, eagles killing snakes, snakes, killing fucking this a mancuss killing a fucking a black Mamba. And then next thing you know I'm watching these rednecks going bear hunting. All right. And it got all these dogs in these metal cages and they could stick their fucking heads out and it's hilarious. They stick their heads out and the go

Speaker 1:          00:34:58       right and all the Peta people are of course like there's thing I want to get out of this cage. They're really excited cause they want to go fucking hunting is what I'm what I'm thinking they do it. So I might think in a hunt, these bears with dogs, what the fuck is this? I made a bear could just swap one of them, kill them. But what it is is they have so many of them and basically the dogs go, they chased the bear, the bear goes up a tree. And then like 10 rednecks walk up to the tree and then one of them decides, all right, I'll fucking shoot it. And they shoot it and it falls out of the fucking tree. It's just the worst thing I've ever seen in my life just as far as like, listen, go and bear hunting takes unbelievable fucking balls. If it's you and a buddy, you know?

Speaker 2:          00:35:51       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:35:51       And you're in bear country and you could stumble upon a grizzly bear that's she's walking with their cubs. And then she immediately comes over and tries to rip your fucking face off. And even though you got a gun, that still takes an unbelievable amount of balls. But I gotta tell you this hunting black bear with like fucking 10 dogs, five dogs, and they chase it up a tree and then you show a watch here. So I'm going to shoot that thing that's the size of my garage. Fucking nailed it, man. It was, it was fucking disgusting. It was really disgusting.

Speaker 2:          00:36:27       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:36:27       I respect it on one level because you have an ability to live off the land. The dollar crashes you like, well, we didn't have anything in the stock market. Fuck it, let's go bear hunting. You know, because those people really are the ones who are going to survive. So I have such a tremendous respect for anybody who hunts and has the ability

Speaker 2:          00:36:47       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:36:48       To go out and, and

Speaker 2:          00:36:50       yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:36:51       basically go get some food. Unlike me, he's a total pussy, just goes down to the fucking grocery store. They're kind of get a pound of the Omega three quarters of a pound off the Turkey. Do you have to smoke? Let me get the smoked Turkey.

Speaker 1:          00:37:07       Some of heartache cheese with that. I'd like that. Right. That's me hunting. And I get frustrated when I can't find the cereal aisle. So I'm basically one of the guys who when the shit hits the fan, you know, and I'm in a city and I just get fucking hurt into some goddamned FEMA camp. I'm done. Vantage Bay, I'm done right? Those red rednecks, we'll just fucking back slowly back off of their property. Like that dude who tuck his package between his legs in that movie with that chick who was in the fucking pinball movie, right silence of the lambs and it just slowly fucking back out into the woods and you'll never see them again. They're going to be able to live off the land and fucking ride it out and they'll create a new clan, you know, and they'll be the ones that eventually topple over the bankers after they exterminate everybody and they take all the land and they'll laugh at those rednecks, you know, and just call him a pesky problem.

Speaker 2:          00:38:05       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:38:05       Not Try to hunt him down with drones from their fucking, Phyllis knows fucking rednecks. They're going to be out there covered in mud like Rambo, a little bit of deer urine behind the neck, you know, and eventually begging to come back like fucking Attila the hun

Speaker 1:          00:38:22       and all empires fall and it's going to be those mother fucking rednecks who do it tremendous respect from. Okay. Now having said all of that, Jason, a fucking bear up a tree with a bunch of God damn dogs. It does. Did she just see the bear up there? Like things just appear like, dude, are you fucking kidding me? You know, it's, it's, it's not like it, but it's not totally upset. It's like, all right, I'm up tree. I don't really know what those things are. They're very loud as a lot of them, but they don't seem to be able to climb up the tree. So a, eventually they'll get tired, they'll get thirsty, they'll leave, I'll climb down, you know, crack open a keystone and have a pot full of honey and I'll just, you know, that'll be my day. And then all of a sudden these fucking, you know, do you have to got all bore these fucking guys just come walking up and I'm telling you, they're literally standing like maybe 20 yards from the tree and this giant furry beanbag is right up there and they've just shoot it in the neck and then it just falls.

Speaker 1:          00:39:26       And they always, they don't need edit out. It fallen out of the fucking tree. Uh, it's just, it was just a, uh, I dunno. Any red necks out here listening to this while you can defend.

Speaker 2:          00:39:38       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:39:38       I Dunno, that just seems like the, uh, the tiddly winks of fucking a hunting, you know, checkers, not chess. You know what I mean? To quote Denzel and one of his movies where he screams at the fucking white guy from the suburbs doesn't quite, you know, it was in over his head. Right. Teaching them the slang. Um, all right. So like I mentioned, I'm here in New York City and, uh, had a great time last night. I went down to, uh, the comedy cellar and did like three shows down there. And it reminded me of the old days when I used to do all the shows here in New York and fucking jumping calves and sit back and forth between the clubs. You'd have a new joke and you get to try it three times a one night. He just can't, uh,

Speaker 1:          00:40:24       you can't put a price tag on that. And I ran into Ari Shaffir who was living in La. He's now in New York City. Um, and he's working his way into the club. Told me last night and he's going to start being leaving a veil so you can check out Ari Shaffir hopefully on some upcoming shows. And, uh, I'm psyched for him. It's like to watch and grow by leaps and bounds by getting all that, uh, that extra stage time. So it's been a, a wonderful thing out here. Oh, I know what you know, I forgot to bring up, um, the Toronto mayor.

Speaker 1:          00:40:58       Can you guys give me some more information on that guy? They're trying to say that he was smoking crack and he goes, uh, he goes up, there's a video of him smoking crack. He said it doesn't exist. Then he called the media a bunch of maggots, so vent. So immediately I'm loving this guy. He's talking all this shit, but then I kind of read up on him. He's got a lot of sketchy shit in the background. I always wonder what you people in Toronto think about the guy. All right in neighboring cities. Do you think he is a piece of shit? Do you think? Uh, the media is a bunch of magazine of fucking dope. Let me know. Anyway, so here we go, Bill. As a penguins fan, I have to ask, do you endorse the Bruins pa announcer going woo after goals? If so, what is wrong with you?

Speaker 1:          00:41:42       Um, I have to admit, I hated it when I first heard it. I hated it, absolutely fucking hated it. And uh, but I've come to an acceptance but that the Bruins aren't mine anymore. I'm an old man now and uh, it's onto the younger generation and this is how they're doing it. And uh, I got to admit now when I watched the games, it's the playoffs and they score. I'm so fucking excited that when the guy goes, Woo, I fucking do it too. And I feel like fucking ric flair and it's, and it's, you can call me a Douche all day long and you'd be a hundred percent right. It's, I can't even defend it. And if it wasn't my team, I would be trashing the shit out of it too. I really would. All right. Well let me ask you this. You guys have off Samuel Sing Alf, Sammy scene.

Speaker 1:          00:42:35       I'll Samuelson in your ring of honor. Okay, let me ask you what's worse. All right. And I know what you're going to say. You're going to say the woo cause you don't give a fuck. You don't give a fuck. Cause he's not fucking blowing out the needs of Sidney Crosby. But I can guarantee you cried like a fucking bitch would. Crosby was out for a year and a half because that guy gave him a concussion. Right? And when Mario Lemieux was bitching about the fucking islanders, probably like, yeah, that's like Mario. That's exactly right. You know. So here I am trashing something that my own fucking team does. Why don't you grow up and have the ability to do the same if not, go fuck yourself. Okay. A few weeks ago I asked, you know when, when you go to a casino, you know once the deal with the fucking covert, like why they have the ugliest carpets planet. My theory's always been a casino was so goddamn big. The amount of money that you will save by buying the ugliest fucking carpet on the cheap.

Speaker 3:          00:43:42       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:43:44       You know, that's why you do it. When you political, I mean, how many square feet is, is like, you know, the Mirage, how many square feet is the fucking Bellagio and all that. I mean, I mean, it has to be, I have no idea. I have no fucking idea. A million square feet. I have no fight. I mean, how many trucks have to pull up with that Goddamn carpeting? So that's why I thought that it was the, it was always ugly carpeting. So here's some theories that people have said to me.

Speaker 3:          00:44:12       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:44:14       Hey, bill, wanted to let you know in response to your five, your May 20th podcast from having worked in the casino industry. I've heard the reason the carpets in the casino are so vomit inducing Lee ugly is so people will avoid looking at them and look up at all the slot machines, restaurant signage, merchandise and whatnot. It's a psychological manipulation to focus your attention where they want it. This also usually a confusing pattern to the carpet, uh, to the pattern. A weight. She was also a usually a confusing pattern to the carpet design and overall structural layout too, to the place to make you subconsciously wander around and put your money into something rather than having any clue where an exit might be or how, how much time has passed. Um, I agree with that. So I would, I would agree with the second half, the first half.

Speaker 1:          00:45:10       I don't know. How long would you stare at carpet? You know, like God, look at the fiber, look out, look how beautiful that carpet is. Um, I would actually think at this point if he had a beautiful carpet, like a nice fucking electric blue, you know, but, and people feel like, oh my God, something exciting is going to happen here. You know, maybe a piece, something peaceful they could be, can be a little more relaxed when he fucking walked in there and he can look around at the horse, I don't know. But as far as like having a confusing pattern and a weird structural layout, I mean if you've ever been, if you've never been lost in a casino, you've never been in a casino, which you ended up having to do is you've got to pick like a, you got to start memorizing where the restaurants are.

Speaker 1:          00:45:54       Like there's where the sports book is, so I know the elevators to the right, but if you start cutting through slots and you're like fucking oh another Jack Nicholson, reference him in the shining in the end. Why under her as you're going through all those hedges, you're not like, I'm surprised you don't see somebody sitting on the ground like dead with an ax in the head and not frozen. But you know if frozen like those people you pass when you're trying to get to the top of that mountain there, Mount Everest right over there in the Himalayas. Is it in the Himalayas? I have no idea. Here's another theory. Somebody has this strange pattern and the carpeting on casino floors is so if you drop a chip, you don't hear it hit the floor and the crazy colors hide the chips if you're looking for them. Um, I don't buy that one either.

Speaker 1:          00:46:46       That just seems like a fucking long way to go to try and make some money. You're already playing a game where the odds is so in favor of the casino, they don't need to be crawling around the floor afterwards. Vacuuming up chips. I wouldn't go with that. Somebody else said that the reason that they have it is because it's easy to clean up puke stains. I don't know what it is, but please, please bring me more theories to that because I find it fascinating. There has I, out of everything that I, that was just, I just read there. I believe it's a confusing pattern and it adds to the confusion of trying to get the fuck out of there and then you just, next thing you know, you're, you're playing a game. I, that one seems to make the most sense to me. All right. Um, here's the next one here. Where the fuck am I here?

Speaker 1:          00:47:35       All right, dear bill, both Fagens I have recently discovered my lifelong friend is in fact an asshole. First let me give you some backstory. I put friends with this kid since car seats and baby teeth. So last year when I'm looking to move into a new place, I naturally turned to him. Oh, that's, that's not a good thing to do. Live it. And you know, one of the quickest ways to end a lifelong friendship is to go and live with somebody. Just think of all the people who've fallen in love. You're my soul mate. They get married and within five years, you know, one of them goes mysteriously missing.

Speaker 3:          00:48:10       You know,

Speaker 1:          00:48:12       by the way, that's a bad thing to do. If you're going to kill your wife or your husband, you should really go practice on some homeless people and prostitutes first, you know, get you get your murderer in game up to par. You know, to really try and get away with a murder with your first murder when you, you have everything to gain with that person being gone. It's no wonder everybody gets caught. You know, you gotta you gotta suck it up. You got to push your ego down and go to the miners first. Get some at bats down there at the foot. The fucking, the fucking Newark bears. They a couple of pokes, you know, get out there, shake the rust off. I'm sorry. Anyways,

Speaker 1:          00:48:54       took us last year. I decide to move into a new place. I naturally, uh, so when I'm looking to do that, I naturally turned to him. He was living on his own with his cousin, was happy to move in with me. Now since I have known him so long, I know his tendency to be a slob. I discussed with this, with him before we moved in and let them know I could only tolerate so much. Uncleanliness he responded back in, kind in. Agreed. Now flash forward to after I move in, I wake up in the middle of the night to snoring that can wake the dead. I do what any normal person would do and go out and ask them to do something. Since it was keeping me up. The kicker is he wasn't even in his room. He's laying on the floor in the living room. So I wake him up and asked him if he could either a stop snoring or B go to his room. This elicits no response from the beast. He attempts confrontation and finally relinquished his to his room. Yeah, this guy's a, he's, he sleeps pretty hard. Um, he goes, this has happened on and off now for the past year. Usually he just gives me the finger now.

Speaker 1:          00:50:00       Just gives me the figure. Now when I wake them up for snoring, clearly I get the impression that he only cares about himself and gives two shits about anybody else. There's other things like him not cleaning up after himself, not caring for his pet and some smoking habits that are less than appealing. I'm willing to compromise though, but he just makes no effort. He refuses to address any of it. He always says he thinks of me as family, but I don't imagine anybody treating their family. This actually, that's exactly how you treat family cause you know they're not going to leave you. I'm so, he goes, so now, so now I'm moving out and I haven't told him this is the reason. So what do I what? So bill, what do I do? Do I tell him he's an asshole and tell them to kick rocks. So just forget about it and let bygones be bygones. You just forget about it too. All right? Because this guy was your best friend until you live with them. Just like,

Speaker 2:          00:50:54       okay,

Speaker 1:          00:50:54       just feel bad for his future wife and this is the deal. One of these days, you know, he'll bring up, you guys live in together and you'll just laugh about it and just be like, dude, I left because I swear to God I was fantasizing about going out into the living room and chopping your fucking head off, you know, or just fucking stuffing a chloroform rag in your God damn mouth it all and you can just laugh about it. But to a right now with how upset you are at him, it's going to affect your friendship. Um, you know, if you'd done being friends with the guy, I would bring it up now, but if you're not, then I would just, uh, I would use that story to get laid.

Speaker 1:          00:51:41       That's what I would do because it will be a funny story. And as you're telling the funny story, the woman's going to be listening and being like, Oh my God, this guy's consider it. He picks up after itself. I have this unbelievable urge to suck his dick. Now what is that? Why do I do that guys? That's how I would use it. All right? And then whenever he brings it up, just laugh about it. That's like a, I live with, uh, Bobby Robert Kelly, one of my best friends in the whole wide world. We almost killed each other when we lived together, but Opodo Polo [inaudible] I left with them and he was a fucking slob and I was the fucking, I want, I mean, I'm not even that neat. That's the thing. I'm not even that neat. Like I don't make the fucking bed every day. You know, I always have three, four days of clothes, but I get to that 0.34 days and then I pick up, I'm pretty good about doing the dishes, but he, he was just like, I'd come back from the road and there would be like dishwater like six days old or something and they'd be like noodles from like the Chinese food floating in there.

Speaker 1:          00:52:52       It was like,

Speaker 2:          00:52:53       okay,

Speaker 1:          00:52:54       ah, we didn't have any rubber gloves and I'd have to stick my hand reached for that plug. Oh, it was fucking nasty. We lived in such a shit hole. I got to talk to them about that someday if he remembers. We had this fucking kitchen. The counter top was, this was plastic.

Speaker 1:          00:53:15       I don't, I don't know what it was like this hard plastic and it was yellow and it was dirty. It was, it was so fucking gross. Like couldn't even cook in there and had this fucking stove. I swear to God that features, you could rock it back and forth two or three times. It would literally come down like an old shack. It was such a piece of shit. And then the guy who actually his name was on the lease, used to keep his smelly hockey stuff out there in the kitchen. It was the most disgusting fucking thing. And then there was three guys living there and like assholes. We had like a bathroom basket out in the kitchen, not a big like kitchen size of bathroom one. So it was always, always overflowing with whatever the fucking eight. It was fucking, it was nasty bug.

Speaker 1:          00:54:02       That really just took me back to a bad period in my life. Although it's funny now. It's funny, yesterday I was over with Bobby and his lovely wife eat some dinner. She cooked a fucking tremendous meal and we started laughing about the old days living together. Right. And I'm still friends with them, you know? And you know what I did? I addressed what a slob he was while we were living together and we went like six months without even speaking to each other after we moved out. And you know what? You don't want to go through that type of shit. But we were both young and immature. Maybe that's where you're at. Maybe you got to go through it. I don't fucking know. Anyway, success story. A Billy red face. I'll keep this short, but you gave me spot on advice a few months ago about my cheating ex wipes.

But I was not, I was never good at being single, doing that whole fucking playboy thing, you know, talking girls into bed and all that types. I always felt like shit afterwards unless the girl was like fucking smoking hot and then you had like cute bleed. She slept with me man. You know, kind of vibe. I never a

Hey Bill, thanks for all the funny, well, you're welcome. He said, I've come to a point in life where decisions have to be made. For the past seven years I've been working within an industry that has thrown me so many curve balls and fuck yous that it just doesn't seem normal. The brief roundup of what I've been through, shit, canned three ones, three, three weeks after buying a house. Oh my God.

Speaker 1:          01:01:31       You know, I've never had to deal with stress that level. I can't imagine that one. Number two business close two weeks before my wedding. Oh my God. So not only, you're not making money, you now have to be even more involved in the wedding planning because you don't have the, I gotta go to work. Excuse. All right. Number three, numerous dead end jobs and what not leading up to today. Although I have had the pleasure of listening to the wise words of birth. I don't know about that dude. You're listening to a more on that you can relate to you. You said, uh, I have decided enough is enough. I'm off to join the army. Going to do a trade, throwing away eight years within the tech industry to become a chef. Um, so be a chef in the army. Did he go, you just hang back and peel potatoes? That's what I know. You're not even yet. You fucking make that shitty army food tastes unbelievable. You know, and then you got it. Then you don't, then you get fans within the army. Then you come out, don't blow all your money on hookers and all of that bullshit. Save all your fucking money. Be a chef in the goddamn army. And, and then when you get out,

Speaker 1:          01:02:47       you know, start your own restaurant.

Speaker 2:          01:02:49       Okay,

Speaker 1:          01:02:50       I'd experiment with food and find out what the average American likes. You know, you have an a in total like demographic right there, running the gamut. You've got people from all 50 states, all right. And some of them know how to cook. Maybe the southern guy can teach you how to make some of that fucking barbecue. You know, somebody out in buffalo could show you how to make some wings that are juicy on the inside. Crunchy on the outside is a tremendous opportunity. You can go see the fucking world, eh? Uh, I know it was other people in the army see the fucking world over the middle of this fucking shit. All I know, I'm sorry, I'm trying to put a positive spin on this.

Speaker 1:          01:03:30       Yeah, it is. It is what you, it's what you're, what you put into it here. So he goes, there's a lot of hard work ahead. Yeah. That guy yelling in your ear. What kind of chef do you know can go through an obstacle course? I hope you're going to do some pushups buddy. And he goes, it'll be well worth it in the end. If all goes to plan, I'll be away from home and the wife for eight months, nobody said I'd get a holiday to a lol. Anyways, just wanted to say thanks and I'll be sure to listen always, even when I'm living on some base, far away from my friends and family. All right dude. Well good luck for your man. Do you feel like that's the right way to go? I hope you come back to being a chef though, man. You know, if that's actually in your heart.

Speaker 2:          01:04:10       MMM.

Speaker 1:          01:04:12       You know, it's funny, that story just reminded me of something and I was laying down and then I just sat up and now I can't even fucking remember the fuck. I gotta go back and reread some of this shit. I'm a chef. Uh, hard work will be worth it. Ah, fuck. What happened in my brain? Huh? What happened to it? Everybody. All right. We're almost done. Oh, I know what it was. Getting into shape. I gotta show you this youtube video, by the way. I love youtube more than anything on the fucking planet. It's one of the things that I always go to, but this whole thing where they, they're not letting you say, I don't want to use my real name. You know? I don't want to use my real name. I don't know cause I write country shit just because I don't want people knowing who the fuck I am.

Speaker 1:          01:04:58       You know? I don't even really leave that many comments on youtube, but you know what it is. I just don't like how they're not giving me the option to say no. So you keep hitting the refresh button and you know it's getting to the point, you know? Well, you know what I would do if I had any sort of computer savvy, I would just start a total rip off youtube where you can remain anonymous and you just have the exact same fucking videos. And anyways, I don't know how I, I've tried to find this youtube video. We're going to have it up there. This guy has this fucking plank position, five minute fucking workout that I'm going to start doing. You know the plank position where you basically, it's like you're in the pushup, pushup position, but you're, you're, you're on your forearms. So he, he does each one of these positions for 15 seconds.

Speaker 1:          01:05:45       All right? This is basically the workout as far as I can remember it. All right, so you're doing the original plank position. You're on your forums. 15 seconds, alright, next 15 seconds. You just have your left arm pointed straight ahead like you doing sieg Heil Heil Hitler, right? You do that and then after 15 seconds you put that down. Now the right hand Heil Hitler. All right? This is by no means pro Nazi. I'm just trying to give you a visual here or you can just watch the fucking video. All right? Then the next 15 seconds, she left leg straight out, put that down. Then your right leg straight out, right. And then, then you go, uh, left leg,

Speaker 1:          01:06:22       right hand, right arm. That's like a balance of thing. And then the opposite of that. Then you go to your cell. It's fucking insane. Like the longest I've ever been able to do a plank position when I was in really good shape was like two minutes. So I'm on the ship, I'm on this shit. All right. To do it with me, I'm going to want to put a link up to the podcast page to the youtube video and hopefully you don't have to go through that rigor Moreau of having to leave your real name if you do, just hit the refresh button. But I found lately if he hit the refresh button too much, it just keeps going back to it and then you just have to shut it off and then just click on youtube again. It's a pain in the ass. I don't know why they're doing it, if anybody knows why. MMM. I mean, one of it I pointed the Chi kind of would be great if people who write all that racist shit actually had to leave their real names. Maybe they wouldn't. Um, but what does that really solve? There's still going to be racist, you know,

Speaker 1:          01:07:17       they just know not to say it out loud so they won't lose their jobs. Right. Isn't that right? I don't fucking know. Anyways, uh, that's a podcast for this week. Everybody, uh, I still had a couple of good ones to read here. Gay reminding you would get, what else do you got to deal with some Memorial Day, right? Let's read a couple more horses.

Speaker 1:          01:07:36       I hate bill. Thanks for your relationship. Uh, think of your relationship with your dog. This is what you can, you can have with the horse, but it's more, oh yeah. Cause I said if I ever had a horse, I'd love to have a horse that I never wrote. I hate that whole breaking the horse. He goes, dogs are kind of like happy go lucky buddies. They have a lightness horse are like noble dogs. They are a little smarter and can be even more emotional than a dog. So they uh, so they can be even more loyal than a dog. They, they have to be one over, oh, you left out the beat. They have to be one over with respect. And once you do this, they consider it a pleasure to have you ride them. It's a two way thing that's hard to describe. Watched the movie black beauty, the one with Alan Cummings as the voice and go fuck yourself. Um, all right. I, I don't know that they would you ever find it a pleasure to have 150 to 200 pounds on your back? Magic. If you had a backpack that way we'll just say 180 pounds and I don't think, was it on your back? It was fucking slap in your ass telling you to go faster and which way to go.

Speaker 1:          01:08:51       Would you enjoy that? I Dunno. More horse stuff. I wanna know. I want to know because I love horses, but I just can't, I could never break one that would kill me.

Speaker 1:          01:09:03       That really would, that would hurt my fucking hat. A underrated uncle billion. This could be the underrated of the century. Keeping your Dick and check flipping the script on the lace and refusing your woman's sex. I just told my girl no sex until she goes and applies for 10 jobs today. And the look on her face was priceless. Like she just had no clue what just happened. Look like a little kid that had just been just sad. It's teddy bear stolen. Love the podcast and go fuck yourself. You redheaded bastard. Ah, yeah. Now that's a great one. That's a great one. I'm like, you're fucking with that. That's, you know, what you have in your Dick and check is like you're a woman, um, fucking bench pressing more than you. That's basically it. I mean, the core thing a guy has over a woman as a, he's physically stronger.

Speaker 1:          01:09:54       Okay. Core thing a woman has is she does that were run by our Dixwell. I mean, they're all so smarter. I think they're just there. I do think women are smarter in, in a lot of areas just because they have to be, it's a nature thing. You know, we're stronger. So we don't, we, I think we just didn't use our brains as much back when you could fucking drag a woman around by her hair and beat her with a branch. I shut the fuck up. You know, you didn't have to grow as a human being. They had to sit there and be like, how do I get that big, dumb Oaf to do exactly what I want them to do? I can't grab him by the fucking throat. How can I make him do it and actually make him feel like it's his decision, you know? Anyways, whatever. That's a podcast for this week. Go fuck yourselves. Um, I'm torn with the teen idols sensation. We're going to be at the count Basie theater this Wednesday, you know, one o'clock jump count bass. He fucking theater out in Red Bank, New Jersey. And then we're going down to some fucking theater in Baltimore. I don't have the names of these on Friday. And then Saturday, I don't know. I'm in some place in a,

Speaker 1:          01:11:04       no, Thursday, I'm in Baltimore. Friday I'm in Pennsylvania and this Saturday I wind it up with two shows down there. And what do you call in fucking Atlantic city. And a tickets had been selling unbelievable the best I've ever sold in my career. And I want to thank all you guys. It means the world to me that you guys are coming out to my shows and I get to continue live in my dream here. Right? So thank you for that. That's the podcast. Like I said, go fuck yourselves. Have a great memorial day, and I'll talk to you next week.
