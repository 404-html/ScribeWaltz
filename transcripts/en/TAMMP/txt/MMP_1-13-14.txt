Speaker 1:          00:00:02       Hey, what's going on? It's bill burn. It's the Monday morning podcast for Monday, January 13th, 2014 are you doing Monday the 13th you know, I heard that one's, it's bad luck to oh with the a fucking trinkets. Oh, what are you going to grow up and just just fucking man up lady and realize that you fucked up your own life. You know, you know those people that got to spin around three times and throw some cookie crumbs over there. Fucking padded shoulder. You know, so, so, so something doesn't, something bad doesn't happen. I'd like to take all superstitious people, put them in a room and after I'm done slapping him with a fucking garden hose, I just like to tell them that listen, bad shit happens in life. Okay? No matter what you got hanging around your neck now, I mean how many times you fucking point your fucking toe, your left boy due south.

Speaker 1:          00:00:58       Whatever the fuck you supposed to do, it's still going to happen. Still gonna happen. Balances out the good shit. All right, so why don't you stop, meet such a fucking pussy. Oh Man am I talked about that a long time ago. I don't care if you do it. You don't. I'm going to bring it back up. Do you ever, did you guys ever see that there was a Jesus camp? No. No, no, no, no. It was one of those big brothers shows, one of those shows, one of those, one of those. What else? Fucking reality shows. You know where they got a couple of meatheads in there? One of them's gay, the other has no was raised by wolves. And then there's a couple of hotties, there's never a fat chick. You know all these people getting in trouble for fat shaming. How about these reality shows once the last time you saw a fat chick just walking around in a thong in the big brother house, you're never going to see it.

Speaker 1:          00:01:51       You're never going to fucking see it. All right. The only time they put them on fat people on a reality show, if it is, if the show is about, I don't want to be fat anymore, you know, I can't think of one. But anyways, there was this show and there was some chick on it, the reality show and every time she had some big challenge coming up, she had to climb into a fucking tree house, you know, without tipping over the cupcakes. Whatever the fuck they're supposed to do is some angry at his dad hosts. Now the blue team slowing down. What the fuck? You know that guy from the island show? What is it called? Dangerous as survivor. I fucking hate that show with my wife watches that Goddamn show and we both sit there laughing. He's such a cunt. I Dunno what happened.

Speaker 1:          00:02:46       He never used to be that way. I think he's sick of doing it. One of those like, be careful what you wish for. Like, I mean at first it was his dream job. He comes home to his wife, honey, I got this idea for a show. I'm so fucking sick of being out here in Hollywood. Stuck in this God damn traffic. You know, trying to get the that side of the four oh five Todd addition to be fifth banana and like a fucking chaps to commercial. I don't want to do it anymore. Okay. I'm thinking of, uh, moving to Colorado Springs and opening up a fucking burrito joint. What do you think? And she's sitting there going, wow, why don't, okay, I understand you're stressed. Um, so go ahead. Just say it for me anyways. That's not what I'm saying. I'm saying just, just, you know, you're very emotional at this point. These, this is very, this is extreme. Um, why don't you create your own show?

Speaker 2:          00:03:45       You know,

Speaker 1:          00:03:48       why don't you just, I dunno. You like Iowa, don't you? We will. You do like go. All right. And then they just sit there at the little fucking starving artists kitchen table and they come up with this fucking show that puts him on a god Damn Island. He gets paid, he's on TV. He's going to get, you know, groupie island, chest hair, pussy, right. Chest air mean chicks who like tanned up chests with, with, with hair on it. And he gets his job.

Speaker 2:          00:04:24       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:04:25       But then they're like, well wait, wait, no, no. Before that they're like, well, I don't, I don't know how to write a script

Speaker 1:          00:04:31       and like, well, why don't we just make it like a game show? Well that fucking stupid, right? And he's all pissed again and he wants to go back to the Burrito. But she kept them in the pocket. Like every great woman behind every great man kept him in the pocket. And some are at some point, probably halfway through the second joint, they fucking realize, wait a minute, what about the real world? We'll do a reality show, right? We'll take 10 fucking morons and we'll stick them on this. God Damn, I would all right. And they'll, they'll, they'll play hopscotch and fucking connect for whatever the fuck we got to do and the last fucking so whatever. So he gets the God damn job. I didn't know what the fuck I am in this anymore. So he gets a fucking job and now this, he's out there and did this.

Speaker 1:          00:05:19       This is a tipping point where after a while it just, you're a human being and you just get fucking bored of the same fucking routines. The exact way that I ended up in this business, I, one of the main reasons maybe why I travel so much is because one of the most depressing feelings I ever had when I, back when I was in the Matrix and I actually had a real fucking job, you know, I got up in the morning and made myself a little tuna fish sandwich. A little plastic thing is some fritos toss an apple in there walking out to the car, right? The grease from the Fritos already making that pit stain on my little brown is I walk up to my rusted out car hoping it's going to start hope and I don't have a problem with the fucking old,

Speaker 3:          00:06:07       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:06:08       Right. There was nothing more fucking depressing. Then that moment when I was, had been there for a year and I was actually sitting there going one year ago, I was right fucking here. I hated that shit. And I think that that fucking island dude, he's not an island dude. He's a mainland dude on the fucking island. I think it's fucking with them at this point. Okay. He doesn't give a shit anymore. He just wants to get through those stupid fucking obstacle courses cause he wants to get, he's going fucking nuts out there. He's already, these guys have been out on that fucking island since like 1999. All right. At this point, he's kind of like those Japanese soldiers that didn't know World War Two ended and they didn't find him until 1974. That's what the fuck is going on with this guy. So I don't know if you've noticed, but Nia watches that show religiously and with every season that fucking guy gets angrier and angrier.

Speaker 1:          00:07:06       Now the red team, they need to pick it up. You just shit. Fuck. I just realized she's still sleeping upstairs. Uh, what the fuck? It's five at 10 in the morning. You know, at that point I'm allowed to fucking drill a jackhammer. I get to a fucking podcast. This is how I win arguments. I rehearse what I'm going to say before I get into, you know, and then during the argument I act like I'm fishing. Like I don't already have the information and that's how I win. Um, anyways, this is the Monday morning podcast everybody and uh,

Speaker 3:          00:07:38       yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:07:39       I don't even know what the fuck I was talking. I was talking about a superstitious people. Boop, boop, boop, boop. You guys like when I do Stevie wonder, could that have been any wider bup, bup, beat up booboo. You know what? I think I'm going to do that down in Korea town tonight. I'll probably get a standing ovation. Um, golden globes. Everybody. Look, I went from reality TV. What was I talking? I was talking about fat chicks and thongs does that my point. Oh, there's never any point to this fucking thing. The point is, is for me to talk for an hour and just somehow eat up an hour your Monday. That's what it is. Whether it's in the morning or it's in the afternoon. One of my favorite things about this podcast is that it is called the Monday morning podcast in the amount of fucking people who so selfishly feel that it's their Monday.

Speaker 1:          00:08:29       You know, like they're doing any sort of heavy lifting on this podcast other than downloading it for fucking free. All right, why don't you and your index finger go fuck yourselves. This is my Monday morning. It's 9:56 AM where I am and I am recording this fucking podcast. All right. How many times have you sent something Fedex second day to get there before nine and it doesn't get there till three, three in the afternoon. Are you one of those constant to hold FedEx? You know, try to get $3 in a quarter taken off your little fucking envelope. Not even thinking that you sent something from San Diego to Bangor, Maine, and isn't that fucking amazing? Because me as a person who actually gives a shit about getting there, can't get there that quick. Can I? I don't think I can. I don't fucking know. It's amazing because the letter doesn't care. Doesn't have a dog in the fight. It's fucking left. It's just sitting there waiting to biodegrade. So I cut him some slack. Jesus Christ. Can you tell I got a bunch of shit to do today. None of this is gonna make sense. Um, let's talk about the Golden Globes. So, uh, oh, yesterday,

Speaker 1:          00:09:40       yesterday I went and I saw the, uh, the other, the Wah Wah. So the wolf, the wolf of Wall Street, I saw with Joey roses in my lovely wife, Nia. I went down and I saw, I saw the movie, we were in the movie theater. We watched it together. It was, it was a great moment because me and fucking, uh, Derosa loves Scorsese. All of his movies. We quote him all the fucking time verse he does it to yet, I've never gone to a brand news Scorsese scores, Scorsese, however the fuck you say it, they'll say it different. Last night at the Golden Globes add, didn't have an angry look on his face. So I think I've been saying it wrong. Of course. Score Sassy. Um, we went down and saw his, uh, so I was movie had a great fucking time. Um,

Speaker 4:          00:10:27       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:10:27       And then I went home and I said, all right, I'm going to fucking, uh,

Speaker 4:          00:10:31       yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:10:32       Oh, what moves my point? My point was, oh, yeah, me, me and Joe, we're going to start doing the uninformed show again. All right. We're in the same city. We're going to start it out doing it once a month.

Speaker 4:          00:10:42       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:10:42       And for those of you never heard of it, it's basically UNEF, uh, the uninformed show, no reading, no research, just strong opinions. And basically me and Joe, we go off for an hour on a particular topic, just coming from the hat, making all kinds of ignorant statements. And then when our, our of ignorance is, is over, we bring in an expert on whatever topic we were discussing. And then he basically tells us how fucking stupid and wrong we are. Then that's the shelf. All right? But if he can't do the math on that, I can't help you. Um, so we will get an excited talking about that. And, uh, so then later on last night later, I decided I was going to, while I don't know, I'm going to be a good fucking person here and I'm going to watch the Golden Globes, right? I, I watched the first playoff game and then I recorded the second one playoffs and a, so I watched the, I watched the charges versus the Broncos. I watched that game and about 50 minutes, it was fucking phenomenal, was fucking phenomenal. And I already forget the name of the charges receiver who just fucking, it's going to be a God damn superstar. Whatever the fuck his was. He really, really impressed me on the, uh, on the big stage, on the big stage there. So, uh, oh fuck it. Let's talk NFL football. I'm already into it. What do you like, how, what do you say? What do you say? A football, feds. All the favorites one as far as I can tell,

Speaker 2:          00:12:14       you know,

Speaker 1:          00:12:15       like verse, he said the dumbest thing ever. He goes, patriots, Broncos in the AFC championship. Dude, I called it oversee going out on a limb again. Um, I'll take Brady and manning. I think they're going to do something, but I actually, I didn't believe in the Patriots. I still camp. I can't believe how fucking well they're playing. The only injuries that they've had obviously going into Denver is going to be a tough, a tough game. I traveled so much. I think we beat them this year. Yeah, we did. That's right. They were up big and then we came back and be all right. It's not going to go in their house and they're going to beat us. That's how it works. That's how it works. And the one I can't understand is, uh, this is going to be a tough one. Seattle and San Francisco. Cause you got the division rivals, you never know which way it's going to fucking go. It's like the Patriots, no matter how good they are, every year they're going to lose to the bills, the jets and the dolphins. Two out of three of them, they're going to lose to him like once

Speaker 1:          00:13:24       at least, unless they get some juggernaut of a fucking thing. But I'm just saying they see you twice. They know what you do. And every other fucking cliche out there, but I still am sticking with Seattle,

Speaker 1:          00:13:36       uh, blocking out that fucking Douche chill 12th man musical that's going on. Oh, we registered in earthquake every fucking game. Ah, they'd go in the way the rate of France to more and more people are starting to become characters. They're starting to paint their faces. It's just somebody the real, you know, they have the real housewives of fucking Atlanta. I need the real Seattle Seahawks fans of Seattle. You got to tell those people to leave the capes at home. You know, every team has got that one jackass that paints his fucking face, shaves his head and sticks the emblem on the side of his head. Everybody's got that one fucking jerk off and it's fine. It's fine to have one, but there is a tipping point in the stance where there's too many of them and they start bringing this size. We would make it fun of that Shit. Like if you have end zone seats and you make a bullseye sign, just how fucking on originally you are. That's right up there with the defense side and the John Three 16 I don't even read the Bible. Okay. I don't know how to make songs like that. I don't know what words to use.

Speaker 1:          00:14:57       Sorry. Um, yeah. How about an original fucking sign?

Speaker 4:          00:15:03       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:15:03       You run of the mill everyday. Fucking conch sitting around talking about all this comics. Not original. That movie's not original. This is derivative. This guy ripped off this and look at you. Look what you guys, he got all fucking week. Probably more than a week. You probably got the tickets for your birthday Assam. Shit. You have all that time to come up with a fucking side and you make the defense side.

Speaker 1:          00:15:29       Why don't you just put on a stupid hat and then act like you're the crazy guy, despite the fact that you're a faithful married father of three who pays his taxes on time? Little toy you just saw. Map happens when he puts out hat on. We don't know what he's gonna do. He's paid for his pretzels just like you are. Ah, there's nothing I hate more than the character. Fucking the fan. That's become a fucking character. Ah, right there. I swear to God, you know what they should do to everybody who does that? They should pull him out of the stands and make them throw a ball in public. Okay, and when you watched the, the, the lack of whipping motion, you don't let fall off a check throws a ball that didn't have brothers. You know what I mean? The way they throw the, our motion of a girl throwing, who didn't have a dad that stuck around and taught her how to throw a ball, it literally looks like cheap animation. Like it skipped a couple of frames. It's just the worst thing. I would put my money down, put your money down. I'd put my money down that if you took one of those fucking face painted Douche bags out of the fucking crowd, that's how they would throw a ball. I could be wrong. I could be wrong.

Speaker 1:          00:16:49       I don't, I, I liked the way it used to be. When you go to a fucking game back in the day you went to the game, maybe you had some old shitty hat from your team. You know, and that was it. And the rest you had you stupid Jack. He just, the rest of you, you know, other than your fucking hat,

Speaker 1:          00:17:10       when you walked out of that stadium and your alcohol level, you could do, you could go to work. You just fucking looked regular and you went there, you drank beers, you got drunk and you're scared kids. That's what you did in the old days. Okay. You have pissed Piston, a giant horse trough and there wasn't any Sushi and there wasn't in this fucking dumb ass music. What did I went to a game recently? I went to the Bruins are La Kings game and uh, the Bruins played like, they really enjoyed their time out here in la. Do you have any times I've gotten burned on that. Any Boston fans who are coming out here, um, and you know, you get home sick and everything. So anytime the Celtics, the Bruins are the red sox, go down to fucking Anaheim, play the angels or whatever, unless they do some inner league shit with the Dodgers, you're gonna to go. Um, I got to warn you actually specifically with the, uh,

Speaker 1:          00:18:09       with, with the Bruins and the Celtics. I gotta warn you. Okay. Don't buy expensive tickets cause I'm telling you, especially with hockey, and these poor bastards have to go play. Uh, they got to go do a road trip in the middle of February, two cow, Winnipeg, Calgary, Edmonton, and Vancouver. It, that's fucking kill me. I would be a raging alcoholic if I had to do that. So by the time they come down to the sunny fucking cities, I, they got cabin fever. I'm telling you. Or it's just, you know, La has got some of the best look at women out here. They're famous. I'm telling you, if they don't play, I can't believe the kings.

Speaker 4:          00:18:58       Yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:18:58       it took them this long to get good. I would think that they would fucking destroy all east coast teams and Canadian teams other than maybe Vancouver just because they don't fucking like each other. I don't know. The amount of times I spent like 80 a hundred bucks through stubhub to watch the Celtics play the clippers back when the clippers sucked. Um, and I would watch the big three come in there and just get smoked fucking brutal. So I'm just saying, all right, just be careful with your money out here. Just get the upper deck shit, don't wear any this stuff.

Speaker 4:          00:19:38       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:19:39       It just go there dressed like you, you fucking going to work or something and then just cheer your team and it's great if your team Wednesday win, if they lose, you'll walk out of the stadium, you know? And you don't have to listen to anybody. Take it to that next level that makes you want to throw a fucking punch and then you're going to get stomped by the neck tattoo guy. It's just a different thing out here. It's not fun. It's not a fun place to see a game out here. They take it to a Ya, that's just a different level. You don't really like when you sit around giving each other shit that'll get sure that blah blah blah. You shirts too tight and all that crap. And there's somebody that yeah, at least my mother was a dead. There's always like that person. That's what west coast fans are.

Speaker 4:          00:20:21       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:20:22       Anyways, the fuck was I talking about? Um, oh, NFL football. So I still think it's a, it is Seattle's. I just think that, that, I dunno, I just liked the way they play. They get Marshawn lynch. He's a fucking, it was the last time he didn't get hit three times before he went down. I

Speaker 4:          00:20:48       cannot get that fucking guy down.

Speaker 1:          00:20:51       All right. The defenses is insane. Keith tell I've been on the road for so long, I can't even fucking name anybody's name. They have beautiful uniforms. No, I just think out of the way they're playing and I, I don't think that, uh, I think they match up well with the Broncos. I Dunno about the 49. This is the Superbowl they get by the 49 is, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm saying that went in it, they beat the 40 niners they're gonna win it because, uh,

Speaker 4:          00:21:19       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:21:20       I just did. Defense is better than the Broncos and I think the, with Marshawn Lynch, they can fucking shoe up the clock and if patient doesn't have the ball in his hand, what the fuck is he going to do? And I think Peyton gets frustrated when he goes up against really a physical aggressive receivers. At least he did back in the day when that's what we had on our team. Um, and who knows if the Patriots go that Jesus, I'll just be fucking thrilled that we made it. I really will be. And everybody's giving me Shit, dude. Oh, can we come down in your own fucking team? I don't know, cause we lost their whole fucking receiving core.

Speaker 4:          00:21:51       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:21:51       Lost all these guys on defense. I'm, I'm stunned that they've been able to do it once again. I'm saying it, I'm telling you right now, Tom Brady's have one of the best fucking seasons he's ever had working with what he's working with. All right. With that, I have no idea it was going to one next week. I hope we fucking win. But uh, you know, I feel like, you know, we beat them last time.

Speaker 4:          00:22:10       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:22:10       And uh, I dunno, I was really impressed with Denver's defense too. So who the fuck knows whatever. All I know is there going to be great fucking games and I'm watching every second of it. All right, and that's the deal. That's all they got to say about that.

I want you to watch it with me. So I sat down and I watched the Golden Globes and what wasn't working. It wasn't bad for an award show. It wasn't bad. The hosts were great. They were funny. And uh, the only thing that bugged me was the amount of people who went up there and when they won a golden globe, like, all right, God, I can't, I have that tablet. I was not ready for it as ready for you a fucking nominated Jesus Christ head. You fucking bets the amount of people that went up there and said, oh my God, I can't believe this. I, I'm not prepared. I didn't think I was going to fucking win.

Speaker 1:          00:27:04       You know, like some fucking backup goalie just sitting there and all of a sudden, you know, they are not getting in this game. We're up five. Nothing is a joke. You know, you start texting on the bench and all of a sudden the start and goalie pulls his groin and now you got to go out there. What the fuck?

Speaker 2:          00:27:22       Yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:27:23       unbelievable. Do you see? How might you want to see how it's done? You should have seen Michael Douglas the way he accepted his golden globe. First of all, for some fucking reason. Anybody who won a golden globe last night was seated like 75 yards away and you had to fucking walk all the way down and then backstage and then come walking out from backstage. Like everybody didn't just see you get up from your table. So what does he do? He assesses the situation like Jesus Christ has taken too fucking long. So the second he gets called, he doesn't go, all right, God, all right, got it. Do you believe it? And you know, clasp his hands together and then slam him down into his lap. You know the Hacky, I've just won an award in show business move. He didn't, he got up and he starts jogging, right?

Speaker 1:          00:28:12       Like a wily veteran, a grizzled veteran who's knows how to utilize the clock. He's running up to the offensive line. He fucking gets on the stage. He, he goes into a great story about how he got the part he thanked everybody before the fucking oboe player even started was phenomenal. It's like watching Joe Montana, Joe Montana run a two minute offense. It was great. He did everything but say John Candy in the crowd. Right? That's probably a bad joke because he could have been at a crowd. He would have been at a crowd if he didn't die shit. You know what? It was a great analogy right up until then, but other than that, I swear to God, like 40% of the people went up there and said, oh my God, I can't fucking believe it. What do you mean? Can't fucking believe it? What do you mean you're not prepared? Didn't the fact that you got nominated months ago or weeks ago, it's like a fucking 50 seconds. They give you like a minute. You know who you're supposed to. Thank right. Is that just like what you're supposed to do? He's supposed to have false humility. False humility. So he said, if I ever win a golden globe, I'm not going to be fucking modest at all.

Speaker 1:          00:29:25       I'll just be up there talking shit.

Speaker 2:          00:29:27       Okay,

Speaker 1:          00:29:28       well before I even get up to the podium. That's right. That's right. I'm not going to come up here and pretend to be modest. Dude, I fucking crushed it this year. Do you see what I was working? You see that horse shit that they put on the paper that I'd bring the life, pay attention to me, Alice. That was supposed to be me yelling at Ambi Davis, Jesus Christ. I this, I don't what the Fuck I had to keep walking out. There was some Zombie that went up there. First of all, she sat for fucking a minute looking around just milking the whole fucking moment, you know? And she was a classic old actress, right? She had the body of a 23 year old and and the in the face of a mummy, you know, go fuck yourself if you think that's to mean all right. Dress and act of God damn. Age with the fucking shoe Polish in your hair coming down there looking like a sexy scarecrow. Anyways, so she fucking comes down. They like something out of a horror movie. I literally, I had to walk out of the room. I have this thing, not only do I hate bombing, I can't stand watching people bomb I, it makes me uncomfortable. I had to walk out. Nia sat there with their hand up to her mouth and I don't know what this woman was doing. At one point I heard she asked another actor to stand up in the crowd for inspiration. I'm sure everybody's ripping her apart on the fucking Internet, but Jesus Christ just go up and say thank you.

Speaker 2:          00:31:08       Okay,

Speaker 1:          00:31:09       I'm site. This is great. I'm gonna make way more money now because I have one of these women who are completely out of my league. Might actually do a little double take when I walked down the street. Thank you so much. I'm going to hold this thing under my Chin like I'm telling a ghost story. So the gold is reflected off my face. Thank you everybody right in the shit that I said. Thank you for editing and thankfully make me look good. I go fuck yourself. What's up to the band and you're out. How fucking difficult is that? I'm not saying you won't be nervous. I don't fucking know a guy. I can't believe it. I can't believe you know like you will. I had a fucking Chinese restaurant, a bunch of balloons came down from the ceiling. Okay. I just had no idea. Really. You just walk around dressed like that. You didn't notice the other celebrities in the room?

Speaker 2:          00:32:07       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:32:07       Why do you have to pretend you're not fucking site?

Speaker 2:          00:32:12       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:32:12       Anyways. Um, that's why I love when Cuba Gooding them, won the Oscar and he started running around like some fucking soccer mom that just want to know when a new or whatever the fuck they drive was minivans or the publisher's clearing house just showed up at his house. That's what the fuck you should do.

Speaker 2:          00:32:33       Right.

Speaker 1:          00:32:34       Map gives a fuck. Anyways. You, you watch how I handle it at the, at the awards. Did they, I think they have those have those when it's time to change. Um, they actually have podcasting awards. They should have you accept him like fucking a over Skype. You know, you shouldn't be in a, in the flesh. Should you? Shouldn't we just be voices? Um, all right, let's plow ahead here.

Speaker 2:          00:33:08       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:33:08       Golden Globes. What did I want to talk about here? Oh yeah. I started doing yoga this year. I'm thinking of a nice long pause here as I wait for every guy who's listening to this to say a couple of homophobic things.

Speaker 2:          00:33:21       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:33:22       And I bought these great stretchy pants that I wear and a half shirt, you know, cause you really want to be like, don't judge me, but you really just want to like, you don't want to feel like

Speaker 2:          00:33:33       mmm.

Speaker 1:          00:33:35       You don't have like loose clothing on, you know, you want to feel like you're being held. Sorry, I'm just trying to put a disgusting image in your head of me with yoga pants and a half shirt. Yeah. Think about that. You know my pasty white belly muffin top hanging over. All right. So of course I can't just do a little bit of Yoga and get my, you know, stretch out my fucking spine after all these hours I spent on airplanes. My fucking, you know, all in nothing stupid attitude in life is I go from, I'm going to start doing yoga again this year cause I haven't done it like three fucking years.

Speaker 2:          00:34:19       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:34:20       I immediately just go from, I'm going to start doing yoga too. I'm going to do 150 hours of yoga this year, which translates to three hours a year, which translates to me also going what about years a week from them on the road and I one of a chance to, I need to build up extra time so I can stay ahead of it. You know like one of those Scifi movies where you need that energy life force on your fucking bracelet. Right? I'm trying to get extra extra guys like you'd, you're playing like a video game. So of course I go too far and I fucking, I think I slightly hyper extended my God damn knee. What an asshole. I do this all the time. If I'm gonna start playing drums, I played drums too much in a part in my fucking shoulder on my hand.

Speaker 1:          00:35:03       I don't know. I don't want my fucking problem is, I think that's why I succeeded as a comedian because there's no way to like physically hurt yourself as a standup comic. You just standing there talking, right? I guess you could ask something out so much that you accidentally throw yourself off the stage, but you could still come up and do it the next show, right? I Dunno. Anyways, so yeah, I'm too old to lift. I'll lift a little bit, but what happens is you just still eating light shit. Then you just get that. I'm still lifting middle aged body. We were, we have a shirt on. You can kind of see that the shoulders in this pex there, but like you belly still sticking out. All right. You know those guys and then they always have some sort of wallet chain. I don't want to be that guy. I really don't want to be that guy. So anyways, we'll see. We'll see what happens.

Speaker 4:          00:35:59       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:35:59       Oh, why do I always fucking do that? You know, some fucking day one I'm going to do yoga and with within three days I'm trying to do like a fucking full split and then I get hurt and then I'm just, you know what happened? I smoked a cigar or less than I got to stop with this fucking shit. You know what? At my age. What's really scary is I lose a drinking buddy every week at my age at 45 they just dropping like flies. The wife says, I have to cut down. I got a fatty liver. I got a kid. I can't fucking do it anymore.

Speaker 4:          00:36:34       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:36:34       All right. All right. I'm gay and that's why I was drinking all these years. All of those fucking things.

Speaker 4:          00:36:40       You know,

Speaker 1:          00:36:43       this is like nobody left. Two of my buddies, I lost two guys this week telling me I got to stop. There's something wrong with my stomach and I got a fatty liver and all I'm thinking is this, how come I'm not feeling anything? Well, probably because I never got my liver checked out. You don't feel anything right? He just walked down the street one day.

Speaker 4:          00:37:05       Okay

Speaker 1:          00:37:06       with your fucking a wallflower knows man, my little chicken eat right and then all of a sudden you just do a face plant. It's over. Is that how you die of cirrhosis? Cyrus is cirrhosis. Scorsese. I don't fucking know. Um,

Speaker 4:          00:37:23       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:37:24       Yeah, I got to lay off. I'm done with fucking cigars. I'm done with those things, man. Those things are, and it's like sucking on a bus tailpipe. It just [inaudible] inhale a great, so I just get fucking mouth and throat cancer. What am I an asshole? I got to stop this shit. It's the hardest thing about being an adult is you have to be your own fucking parent.

Speaker 4:          00:37:48       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:37:49       You know, when you were a kid, you know your parents were there to stop you from eating a whole sleeve of cookies. You, you will. The second you move up, you can do whatever the fuck you want. You can literally be doing heroin, Azure, written fucking cookies. And there's nobody there to say, stop.

Speaker 4:          00:38:03       Okay,

Speaker 1:          00:38:03       fucking annoying. I gotta lay off of it. I can't do it though. I can. I just can't seem to get, you know what it is? It's all these social things. Football game's coming up, going to a hockey game that starts tomorrow, starts tomorrow, and then last night, you know, Joey Rose's got me a great fucking bottle of this stuff. Fucking, I don't Japanese Scotch. And I'm like, well, I got to try it. And of course it was absolutely delicious. Now I've got to have a fucking cigar with it. I'm sitting out on my porch with my red sox robot. My bathrobe is also my smoking jacket. Um, cause I'm an environmentalist and I'm sitting out there smoking. There's nothing dumber than smoking a really good cigar when you're cold. It's another thing too. This is a bad time of year to smoke a cigar cause you can't smoke anywhere inside. They smell like shit unless you're in a cigar bar and then you're in there with like 50 other guys in this, in, in, you know, it just feels like you're in a walk in closet with a car on after a while your eyes are burning. I can't even do it. You know what it reminds me of is back in the day when people could smoke in comedy clubs and um,

Speaker 1:          00:39:20       it was unreal. By the time you got to, it's, you've got to do three shows or even two shows back then. Cause everybody had seemed smoked back then they would, there'd be like a cloud of smoke, you know, by. But at the beginning of the second show because it was still left over from the first show. And I just remember like my eyes would be burning when I got off stage and the second show I'd have to go to the bathroom and like flush him out with water and then I go home and I actually learned,

Speaker 1:          00:39:52       uh, to take a shower the night before you went to bed because I always remember the next morning I would wake up and I take a shower in the water came over my head. I would just smell the smoke like someone was smoking next to me. So I imagine even that, how bad smoking is, I can even imagine that being around a bunch of people who were smoking and then laying in bed with this smoke in your clothes and in your hair is somehow affecting your health. It's just bad. I am giving away my cigars. I'm, I'm fucking, I can't say I'm done, done with them, but I'm, I'm pretty much done with them. What I'm going to do is when I go to other countries, I'll smoke a Cuban cigar. That's what I'll do. And then I'm not bringing a bunch back because then he'd go, oh fuck, I got to smoke these, these are Cubans. I don't want them to go bad. Right? And then you don't have a humor door cause you don't want to get sucked into the habit. And then what happens is you fucking cigars are going bad. It's a nightmare. Um, I'm going to get a bunch of texts first world problem. No, it hasn't. Cuban cigars are made in a third world country, so go fuck yourself. Isn't that, is that considered a third world country?

Speaker 1:          00:41:02       What is exactly a third world country? A country that were oppressing? Is that what makes them Third World?

Speaker 4:          00:41:08       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:41:08       It isn't just South America, isn't it? Oh Christ. Now I gotta look it up and there's a bunch of people laughing at me right now. But if I actually asked you to give me a fucking intelligent definition, you couldn't. Third World countries.

Speaker 4:          00:41:24       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:41:24       Wait, third world definition. Let's go with that first dude to do two to two to third world. Okay? According to Wikipedia, term, third world arose during the Cold War to define countries that remained non aligned with either NATO, with the United States or western Europe, western European nations and their allies representing the first world or the communist bloc. And that would be what? The Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China. Oh, Cuba. So Cuba is not third world cause they aligned themselves with the Soviet Union and their allies representing the Second World War.

Speaker 4:          00:42:08       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:42:09       So I'm guessing that we came up with it because we're the first, first world. We're number one. All the commies are ranked number two and then a distant third. You know the key. Oh, so based Mexico, according to this chart, fall of Central America all the way down to South America. Except there's one in South America that isn't. What the fuck is that? I don't know what that is, is just north of Brazil.

Speaker 1:          00:42:43       Oh, does that Burns and Allen, what's the name of that fucking country down there? Cakes and biscuits. I don't know. Fucking it up. Um, let's let you know and I think it's time mercifully for the questions this week. What do you say everybody, what do you say? You Ready? You ready for the questions for this week? I, God knows I am. Oh, really? Quickly. I didn't even get a chance to talk about it. Do you guys do watch that 60 minutes thing last night of that fucking jerk off? He's ratting out Alex Rodriguez, the Henry Hill of that think. All right. I'm pulling up Paul Versey, the dude I call it, I called it. We're all going to be on Roids by the end of our lives. Okay. And I'm going to tell you why. Because the same reason why you saw that sexy scare squirrels, scarecrow walking into the fucking stage. The same reason why they got all these diet pills and all this fucking grow your hair back shit. Because no one wants to be old and decrepit.

Speaker 4:          00:43:41       Okay?

Speaker 1:          00:43:41       All right. They're already given the shit out. That's synergetics is fucking HGH as far as I can tell.

Speaker 4:          00:43:47       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:43:48       Um, which is basically I researched, I said synergetics uh, scandal. That's what I searched. So of course negative shit came up about them. Um, we're all going to be on it. It's the same way w marijuana is gradually becoming legal. That's what's going to happen with, with, with steroids. Guaran fucking tee. You know what's the coolest part of the story was they said a rod texted this Guy Tony, whatever the fuck his name was, and Joe [inaudible]. He said, hey, I got a big day tomorrow. What do you got? So we gave him the stuff. The next day you would have like two doubles and a single or something like that and the 60 minute guy goes, Ooh, what did you think after you sent him your products and saw the results? And he was going like, he basically said that, yeah, we, we got the formula down. You held the formula down and he goes, yeah. It was like, it was like shooting fish in a barrel. So these guys are so advanced in this illegal shit that I'm telling you, they're going to get it to the point where it just like we, where you can smoke it through like a breathalyzer. We're all it is, is just basically the mist of THC. Whatever the fuck that stuff is that gets you high, they're going to get that with what? Steroids.

Speaker 4:          00:45:09       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:45:10       All right. And you're going to be 80 years old walking around feeling like you can put your fucking fist through the Goddamn wall.

Speaker 4:          00:45:17       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:45:17       It's going to be great. All right. And all of this, this witch hunt on these a rod guys and all these guys went to jail and all that type of shit that people are going to look back and be like, well, what was the problem? That's, that's my prediction.

Speaker 4:          00:45:32       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:45:33       Provided an asteroid doesn't hit his first. Um, oh, by the way, I retweeted something that somebody sent me about, uh, the Denver International Airport. You know, that there's basically a, that they started to build it and then they said, well, the structure is wrong. And then they, rather than destroying what they built, they buried it. And then they built the airport on top of it. So all the conspiracy theorists just saying this is a bunker for all the fucking people who are going to just survive a nuclear holocaust or an economic meltdown. And there are a bunch of weird paintings on the, on the walls. But if you really look at them objectively, it kind of looks more, it's more about world peace, oppression. And then the children of the next generation coming along and oppressing the oppressors are stomping them out. And then there's no war, no more weapons. You can look at it in a sunshiny way or you can look at it in a creepy way. And I got to admit a lot of the, the at work is a pretty creepy. I was, I'll send you guys a link to that shit. But it's a pretty interesting, uh, I don't, I love conspiracy theory because I know, you know, I know how much I lie.

Speaker 1:          00:46:47       So why would they be so I love the speculation. All right, here we go. Let's, let me shut the fucking get on with the, uh, the questions for the week. All right. This one says ponies dot, dot, dot. I'm a retard t. Why builtin? Yeah, I'm a colts fan. Um, I guess that's a reference to some guy who plays on the, uh, on the fucking cults. I don't know. I don't know anybody's name anymore. I don't know who shot. I don't really do that. He goes, I'm listening to the eight 26, 13 podcasts where you talk about the difference between a pony and a horse. Oh, it was making fun of the fact that I, I, for until I was like in my early twenties, I didn't realize that a pony is a pony in a horse is a horse. I thought a pony was a small horse and the people down the street had a pony.

Speaker 1:          00:47:31       My whole childhood tied to the back of their fucking house. It's kind of cruel. But, uh, I remember driving by and finally when I was like 19, 20 years old, my mother was driving and I was just like, what does that pony going to turn into a horse? And, and if I could just go back and listen to the October 26 podcast the last year, I explain it way better. The fucking look my mother gave me before she started laughing at me. Um, I still see it on her face every time when I come home for Thanksgiving. Anyways, I'm 23 years old. He said 23 year old American English was my first language. I have my bachelor's degree. I am going to law school in August. I scored higher on the law school admission test, the 97 [inaudible] 97% of potential lawyers. And I just had to look on Wikipedia to find out that ponies are indeed not young horses.

Speaker 1:          00:48:21       I am ashamed of myself. Go Fuck Yourself. At least I can read out loud. Hey, yeah, the chalk you look at least you can read out loud, dude, you did all that other stuff. I can't do that. You've got to take me out because you're all so fucking stupid. Anyways, he goes, thanks for the free labs. Your Colorado Springs show was amazing. Uh, go Andrew Luck. Well, he's going to the golf course there, buddy. Um, yeah, for all you people out there, pony is a pony and a horse is a horse. I guess I was a small horses. A cult. Is that what you'd call it? You know what's amazing is that I don't know what it is and I never take the time to look it up. So I always sound dumb in this conversation. Okay. Advice on men. Hey, bumbling. Billy Bul. Uh, I'll keep the questions short to rescue you from the English language, but up, up, up, up, when I get it, I suck at reading out loud. He goes, I'm a 20. Oh, she says, oh my God, this is from a Olay. Uh, I finally get a female to write in and I trashed, you're right out of the gate. I'm sorry sweetheart. She says, I'm a 24 year old girl and I'd like to know your best piece of advice of understanding the human male species. Many thanks. But at the same time, go fuck yourself while I'm sorry. You gotta be a little more specific. Um, I'll give you a, basically, generally speaking, um,

Speaker 1:          00:49:56       oh, Jesus Christ. What do you want to know? I would basically, you know, you want to learn how to communicate with them better. Um, yeah, so you're doing the right thing. You're asking another part. This is actually a very smart question. Rather than sitting around with your female friends just going, I know, right? What if, what if that God,

Speaker 4:          00:50:21       yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:50:21       You sit there to fucking wine bar whining. This what you do. You go cross enemy lines and yes, you know, a trader like me to read from the playbook. All right, how guys communicate. I can't say that. We just say what we're thinking because we have liars and passive aggressive people and a meandering little man boys. But generally speaking, uh, the thing that confuses us the most, I did a bit, I can't remember if I did it on a special, but

Speaker 4:          00:50:58       yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:50:58       One time I was driving with Nia and I said, hey, I want to get a chocolate shake. We're going by this diner, and she freaks out. She's like, oh my God, they make the best chocolate shakes. And I go, I know, right? She goes, yeah. She just goes, oh my God, that, that, that, that they're so big. She just kept saying this so big. After a while I'm thinking like, yeah, like fuck, how the fuck am I going to drink this whole thing? And then immediately just clicked on me. Like it's like they're not big this standard size. Wait a minute, she wants half of my shake, but she doesn't want to seem selfish, but she doesn't want all the calories of the full shake Sarah. But she doesn't want to look like she's taken away 50% of my good time. So rather than telling me that she's trying to mind fuck mean to thinking something that I drank a zillion times with ease is now too big. You know what I mean? So that's how you guys communicate.

Speaker 4:          00:51:56       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:51:56       I don't know how we communicate because I can't just sit there and make it seem like guys were heroes and that where they would be like, listen, I'm trying to lose weight, so, uh, can I have half your shake?

Speaker 2:          00:52:07       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:52:10       The only thing I can tell you is you're 24 years old. Uh, it, you shouldn't understand them. You shouldn't understand guys, but it's hard for me to, I don't know what you're asking. Please write back. Please write back advice on men park to just do that again. Just fucking write back asked me something more specific and I can help you out. But it's great that a 24 year actually smart enough to ask guys to explain. Um, ah, let's see. Best piece of advice. I use a great piece of advice. Learn how to cook. All right? It's stereotypical is that fucking sounds, I don't mean it in the, as this in a sexist fucking way.

Speaker 2:          00:52:49       All right. I don't,

Speaker 1:          00:52:53       don't be a slob and learn how to cook would put you ahead of 80% of fucking women out there because for some reason, somewhere along Edith Wharton over that chicken showed the flag making a guy his sandwich became this absolutely degrading fucking thing to do. Yet guys still have to hold the doors and, and fucking buy drinks. Like why we don't find that sexist, reverse sexist or whatever the fuck you call it. I remember one time I was downstairs, don't know what the fuck I was doing. I was doing some pain in the ass job. I was cleaning out something in the garage and without,

Speaker 2:          00:53:34       yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:53:34       me asking or anything. Nia came downstairs with this unbelievable sandwich. She had made pickles toothpick in it. The whole fucking nine yards.

Speaker 2:          00:53:46       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:53:47       And she brought like a something to drink downstairs too. And I stopped working. I sat down, ate. It was one of the greatest moments of our relationship. All right, so that's some advice I would give you is guys have a very, we're very simple and by simple, I don't mean stupid before you get on your fucking high horse,

Speaker 2:          00:54:07       okay?

Speaker 1:          00:54:09       It's like an old school engine. You open the hood and everything's right there. Real wheel drive. It's not turned to the side jammed into the compartment. None of that bullshit. It's just fucking basic. You just do that every once in a fucking while. Guys will think I have a keeper and all you're doing is making a fucking sandwich. And that doesn't mean that you shouldn't have the right to vote. It's fucking unreal. Cook it. And then you don't even cook and all, you know when he's just slapping shit together, you build in a little fucking food house. How difficult is that?

Speaker 2:          00:54:45       Okay,

Speaker 1:          00:54:46       that's what I don't understand. Like I guess I kind of understand it, but like cooking a meal for somebody is one of the greatest things you could ever do for them. All right, I'll leave it at that. So I would say something simple like that. This is how simple guys are. If you actually, every once in a while just said, hey, do you want to bear? And you actually got up and went to the fridge and got a beer and brought it over, put it in a fucking frosted mug. I mean, personally speaking, I'm ready to go paint the house cause that little move there, I feel like a fucking king. That's all it takes. That's all it takes. Very simple.

Speaker 2:          00:55:30       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:55:31       You know, let them head out with his friends once a week. If they come over and they watched the game and you're not into the game, leave.

Speaker 2:          00:55:41       Okay,

Speaker 1:          00:55:41       go in the other room or be a good shit and hang, but don't ruin as good fucking time. Jesus, I'm on a roll here now

Speaker 2:          00:55:52       is another one.

Speaker 1:          00:55:55       Uh, try to limit the amount of horrific shit you're going to drag him to. Now he's, he's obligated to goes to some of it, but he has to have just set it up and just say, listen, there's a bunch of shit that you do that I'm not going to begin to write. Like tailgating on a golf course peeing in a Porta potty before, before a football game that you don't give a shit about. I don't want to be there for that. So I get to tap out of that. All right. And then the guy he gets to tap out of like, I dunno, like what have I tapped out on one time a Nia wanted to take me to somebody's birthday party. They were having some fucking, you know, we're all gonna dress like it's the gold rush or the fucking prohibition era. It's like, I don't want to fucking do that.

Speaker 1:          00:56:38       She gave me shit and I was just saying I don't want to do it. And she let me out of it and we laughed about it. I actually went there without a costume. I mean I made a deal. We made it, we made a, we made a deal. I think I told this story, I'm fucking punch drunk. Yeah. I never know what the fuck I'm talking about. I showed up and I didn't wear a costume, which was hilarious cause every other guy was fucking dress like Charlie Chaplin. And I show up in street clothes and they're looking at me like I'm a magician. And then I left early cause that's right. Cause I would have watched the Celtics were playing the Lakers in the finals that year when we beat him. And I would have missed it if nia wasn't so fucking cool. So that's, that's what I would do. And if you actually do shit like that, you know, you put yourself on this solid ground with the guy that you're with, we're now, there's no reason for him to be an asshole to you or be mean to you because you've been so nice to him. It really kind of works that way. It kind of feeds off each other. That's the best I can do without a specific question. All right, so there you go. And you know, fuck everybody. Who's going to say that? You know what I just said was sexist. You know, go fuck yourself. I don't think it's, you know,

Speaker 1:          00:57:49       you're on a date with your woman. You go and you open the car door for you still do that shit. If I can do that, he can go get me a fucking beer. Christ. It's a twist off. What are you gonna hurt your wrist? Yeah. You know something that that would be my advice. Stop acting like a kicker. You know what? We're just fucking annoys me. That every time a kicker makes a tackle, he gets hurt. I just fucking, I just don't understand that Jesus fucking Christ. Put some cream on it and get back out there and fucking throw your feet around. All right. College Room. Uh, Billy Vanilli. I liked that one as a new one. Uh, can't wait to see you in Hamilton, Ontario. I'm a 21 year old college student who, oh, by the way, I'm, I'm hopefully going to have the, uh, the links to those dates in the next week or so.

Speaker 1:          00:58:42       Everybody asks you about all the, my, my big Canadian tour in much anyways, this person says, can't wait to see you in Hamilton, Ontario. I'm a 21 year old college student who has been having to deal with rumors. Um, I was a resident on dawn a couple months back, which means I was responsible for watching over first year students in their dorms during Halloween. I did hook up with one of the first years at a party. I was at word somehow spread, but through classic broken telephone that I got a drunk and banged her in the elevator of her dorm, uh, consistently when I am at any, I think you meant to say consequently, what am at any social gathering party? Kegger when I tell a girl my name, they immediately walk away as if I'm some monster. Oh No. I'm thinking of transferring school as a fair share of the campus. Thinks I'm that creepy guy around girls. Any advice on addressing this room are with girls to stop them from running for the hills would be greatly appreciated. Um, I don't know. Dude. Did you do it if you didn't do it?

Speaker 1:          01:00:03       I don't know. If you didn't do it, I would talk to the, to the woman that you hooked up with. Can you say, listen, can you please tell people that I didn't get your drunk, that that didn't happen? Um, I don't, I don't know. Well, I mean I don't, I don't know if people are mature enough once it gets out like that. Maybe she's embarrassed that she hooked up with an older guy. I have no fucking idea. MMM. I Dunno. I Dunno. I don't like those creepy sex ones because now I'm going to have to do this. I have to assume that you are innocent.

Speaker 4:          01:00:38       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:00:38       Who would get a somewhat look, I gotta tell you this. Who would get somebody drunk and then fuck them in a public place like that. If you're doing something under handled, like that story doesn't even make sense unless you wanted to get caught.

Speaker 4:          01:00:49       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:00:50       Ah, whatever.

Speaker 4:          01:00:52       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:00:52       I don't, I, you know, I don't know how to get you, it's once you get accused of sexually weird shit, you kind of do have to leave I guess. But then they win.

Speaker 4:          01:01:04       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:01:04       I don't know. Dude. That sucks. I really hope that, you know, if you are innocent, I really hope that uh, you can somehow get out of that. Cause that's that fucking thing where I always felt like, you know, somebody gets accused of some sort of sex crime. Like I don't think that they should just put their name in the fucking paper until they're there. They're convicted.

Speaker 4:          01:01:21       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:01:22       It's even, and everybody in your world is gonna know about it.

Speaker 4:          01:01:25       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:01:26       And, uh, if you didn't do it once, you're just accused of it. You get done, you're done. It's fucking over. I don't, I don't mean not in back of the day. At least you could, you could go a couple of states over, you know, change your name to fucking Tj or some shit and fucking start a new life. You can't do it. Now I have the social media, the Internet and everything just follows you around. Um,

Speaker 4:          01:01:50       okay.

Speaker 1:          01:01:51       You know what? I was doing it, I would stop going to parties. I would get sober and I would just say, you know,

Speaker 4:          01:01:57       yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:01:58       Just and I, I would, I don't know, stone sober, meet a nice girl and just say, yeah, I mean, I hooked up with this girl and then somebody started this fucking rumor and yeah,

Speaker 4:          01:02:07       okay,

Speaker 1:          01:02:07       I'm done with it. I don't want to do this shit anymore. I don't got to, I don't know how to, I honestly, I don't know how to get out of that. Jesus, he's a fucking hard questions this week.

Speaker 4:          01:02:17       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:02:17       I don't, fuck, I don't, I just, if you transfer, you're admitting that you're wrong.

Speaker 4:          01:02:23       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:02:23       Well where the fuck are your friends who can back you up going out of that's bullshit. You got nothing. You just a loner. Yeah. Jesus. I don't know. Alright. Motorcycle through Thailand. Jesus Christ. If you wrote a motorcycle to Thailand, you the toughest fucking guy I know. Unless you're from there. Uh, dear Billy Budd Baxter.

Speaker 4:          01:02:48       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:02:49       I'm glad to hear your 2014 it starting off strong. I remember you talking a few weeks back about being able to drive all to be able to drive all things. I've had that same philosophy for a few years now and I've been working towards learning how to do just that. I'm 25 hours into getting my pilot's license and in November I took a basic motorcycle driving course over a weekend. I think you have taken something similar. Yeah. I got a motorcycle license a couple of weeks after the course with no additional motorcycle experience and never having driven outside of a parking lot. I flew to Thailand, Jesus Christ there. I went to the northern mountains and rented a two 50 cc dual purpose dirt bike and drove for nine days around the Mae Hong Son loop. The fuck is that though. It can easily be done in five or six days. Google it if you feel like it.

Speaker 1:          01:03:38       It was easily the best experience of my entire life. I was able to get out of the the shit, show tourists, clap trap areas and see what the fuck was going on in the day to day lives of a bunch of ties. The food was incredible. The views were out of this world. The people are the most friendly in the world. See, I have all these stereotypes like I wouldn't want to go up there, I think going to get kidnapped or some shit and I was able to gain some real chops when it comes to riding a bike. Plus I got to stop in a couple of small tourist based towns and met a beautiful Scandinavian girl. Oh and it didn't hurt that 50 baht. I don't know how to say it. A dollar 50 American, we'll get you all the foods you can eat and 400 baht.

Speaker 1:          01:04:19       We'll get you a beautiful bamboo hut in the middle of the Goddamn rain forest for the night. I doubt anyone will give a shit about your standup in Thailand. It's not you, it's them. But you should definitely make a trip out there and drive around and on a rented motorcycle. I got tons of more information. If you're actually interested, thanks for the free labs. Come to Durham, North Carolina as soon. Uh, and go fuck yourself. Um, dude, I would love to do that. I'm just afraid to go. There's certain places where you go, I don't, you get put on a list. Isn't Thailand the one we're fucking pervert Goto to bang a little boys.

Speaker 4:          01:04:59       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:05:00       No, we got enough Thai food over here. They just assume they don't assume you're going over there to ride a bike on the fucking Ho Chi Minh loop or whatever the fuck he just did over there. They think you going over there for that. But that sounds awesome. That is, that is a bucket list goal of mine. I do. I want to be in scenic place in another country on a motorcycle.

Speaker 4:          01:05:21       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:05:21       That, I mean, why wouldn't you want to fucking do that? Ride around and pretend like you're tough and you know how to fight. That's just what I want to do. Um, congratulations. Well, I never even heard of that for the, for those few listeners at home, if you're at your desk right now and you don't want to fucking do work, do work, you don't want to be working. Uh, let me, let me spell that out for you. A flew to Thailand, the Mae Hong Son loop, Mae Hong as in Hong Kong, h o n g n s o n. Loop.

Speaker 4:          01:05:58       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:05:59       By the way, what's up with fucking Dr Evil in North Korea feed and his uncle to dogs. Is that true?

Speaker 4:          01:06:06       Yeah,

Speaker 1:          01:06:06       I kind of have to believe that because it's not like they have to sway public opinion liberal or Conservative about that guy.

Speaker 4:          01:06:14       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:06:14       At fat jerk off. The fuck is wrong with you if you're listening to this, cause I know your dad was a big movie fan and maybe you want to rebel against your dad and listen to the podcast. If you lit listening to this, uh, dude, you're headed towards an ugly death. You're not going to survive doing shit like that. That's not the way to do it. I don't know. Did Your Dad own the godfather trilogy? And you're trying to act like everybody in your world is fucking Mo Green. Maybe you have to do that. You should have just shot the guy, dude, if you do stuff like that, like the level of fear that that put in me, and I'm not even in your country. I'm already thinking. I think my first thought after I got over the wave of fear of that was I have to kill this guy. If I lived in the country, that's what I would have two bullets, one for him, and then I'd shoot myself just in case I do. You know what? I'd shoot the dude.

Speaker 4:          01:07:07       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:07:08       And then I would wait half a second. And if I didn't hear applause, I would then shoot myself because I always felt if you took out a guy who's just ruling with that level of psychosis,

Speaker 4:          01:07:21       okay.

Speaker 1:          01:07:21       Um, that if you took them out, is everybody sitting there looking down at the floors? He's saying the next crazy thing he wanted to do that if you actually took 'em out that on some level people boot would be like, uh, the second you did it would be like, ah, God, thank God you did it. Jesus Christ. I thought I was the only one. Um, all right. I don't fucking know.

This is the last one on the, on the podcast. Hey Billy Bob Burton. Um, I'm a big fan of yours, fellow Bostonian suburb guy as well and I love the podcast. I have some relationship issues that I'd like your input on if you would be so kind. You fuck all. All right. I've been dating my girlfriend for over four years. I am 26, she's 25. We moved in together in September, 2013 because I thought things were going well. Well we have some issues and I'm not sure what to do besides the usual fights over things where I think logically and present my side of the argument well with facts that are relative to the subject. And she rambles about how I'm a mama's boy and have a small Dick.

Speaker 1:          01:11:38       Um, well yeah, I guess in other words you're probably right. So she's just capitulated in and I was just insulting you. Granted this is your version of it. Anyways, he said my biggest issue is her drinking. More specifically how she acts when she's drunk. When we are drinking in public set sitting, that's setting sitting with the large group of people, she drinks too much and always blacks out. This is typically not a normal thing. It only happens once every few months, but over the holiday season it happens every weekend while at company Christmas parties, hers and mind friend's houses and while on a pub crawl, I have two big issues with her blacking out like that. One is that it's usually she only drinks excessively when other people, mainly her bitchy best friend insists that my girlfriend should drink a lot. Even though my girlfriend has a very low tolerance for alcohol.

Speaker 1:          01:12:36       It's to the point that her best friend will say things to her like, if you don't take this shot, I hate you slash you're not my friend Jesus Christ, and she's being serious. I spoken with my girl repeatedly about how I feel that that's not a good idea or right to allow a friend to do that to her and my girlfriend replies that she's not going to say no to her best friend no matter what Jesus Christ. This is like a textbook codependent relationship here. Um, my second issue is that when she blacks out, once I get her in the cat, the car or cab to take her home, she gets really quiet and starts saying she hates our relationship. She hates me, she hates living with me. She wishes we would break up among other similar things once she sleeps it off and wakes up, hung, hung over.

Speaker 1:          01:13:24       She has no recollection of what she said to me the night prior. And she says that drunk words, they're drunk words and they mean nothing. Ah, God, I do not think that way. They legitimately hurts my feeling and has feelings and has happened so often recently that I've been weighing my options about whether it's time to end this relationship and move on. I'm not sure. I'm just being a pushy and need to get over it, or if I have legitimate gripe here, dude, you totally have a legitimate gripe. He says, I care about my girlfriend a lot. And until recently, I was beginning to think about proposing marriage to her at some point. Dude, you cannot on any fucking level proposed to this girl with this shit on the table right now. He said, I had planted in my head that if we were going to live together for two years, then we had the right stuff for marriage.

Speaker 1:          01:14:08       Uh, with all this drinking stuff though, I'm not sure where to go. If you have any tips or advice, I'd greatly appreciate it. Go Fuck Yourself. Can't wait to see a new special in 2014 hope you perform at Boston. All right? Yeah, Dude. Um, first things first, do not on any level proposed marriage to this woman at all, on any fucking level. Um, what you have to do is you got to put your foot down. All right? You have to say both things that you brought up, provided you're being honest with me. Uh, you are 100% in the, and you have to just say, look, um, you can't drink like that anymore and you can't have a relationship with your friend like that anymore. Um, actually you can because you are a free individual. But if you're going to be, then I want out of this relationship, I'm not going to be with somebody who drinks like that and more specifically drinks like that because her friend is making a drink like that. And second of all, you know, I don't, I, I don't, you know, there's an expression out there that, what does it say? Uh, a drunk man's words are a sober man's thoughts.

Speaker 1:          01:15:17       I Dunno. I would, oh shit. This is Bart. Nick, hold on one sec. Hang on. Hang on Joey beat. Just wrap it up the podcast. They'll be outside and two minutes. Okay. All right. See you. Um, yeah, so I would basically, uh,

Speaker 1:          01:15:39       okay, so let's just compartmentalize this thing. Okay. If that first issue, just the drinking thing, I would just lay down the gauntlet. You if you, if you want to be with me and you know I'm not going to be in a relationship with that going on, that's unacceptable. I respect the fact if you still want to do it, but if you still want to do it, then you're moving out around, moving out and we're not going to be a couple anymore because I'm not tolerating that. And you're well within your rights to do that and it's a great thing to say at 26 years of old to get some sort of self esteem within a relationship and have some ground rules with yourself. This is your half of the circle. What do I want and what am I willing to put up with? Where is my line? You found your line and you tell her that that's where it is. You don't have to be a jerk. You don't have to get angry. Just say, this is my line and I totally respect if you want to live on the other side of the line, I'm just not going to live with you doing that. Um, this other shit where she gets, she says she hates to relationship and wishes that you broke up. Um,

Speaker 1:          01:16:35       if it happened one time, whatever. She does that every fucking time. I think those are our honest words and I honestly would consider, see, consider getting the fuck out of that relationship.

Speaker 1:          01:16:46       Um, I think you, you guys have both been in relationships for a long time. You got into it when you were really young. Maybe she still wants to see, explore, see what the fucks out there. I have no idea what that is. A major, major fucking red flag. Um, and uh, I don't buy it and I also don't buy that she's 100% drinking like that because her friend is making her it. Uh, I think she wants to drink life. She's, maybe she's drinking like that cause she's not happy in a relationship. I don't know. There's a bunch of major red flags and you 100% the right. You're not being a pussy, you're being fucking mature and you're, you're saying what you want. Fuck this dude. You don't want some drunk with some drunk fucking friend who then gets hammered and says they don't want to be with you.

Speaker 1:          01:17:30       When you dream at Lazette your dream girl, when you sit there and fantasy kicked this bitch to the curb, I've added with her. I'm not even in the fucking relationship. You could do better. All right? I'm not saying she's not the one, but she needs to grow the fuck up. Don't say it like that, but that, that's what I believe. And that's, that's my thoughts and I'm sticking with it. All right. My buddies, outside of being a cunt, I gotta get off here. Uh, have a great week. Go fuck yourselves. And, um, that's it. I'll talk to you next week. I'm looking forward to some great football. All right. See you.
