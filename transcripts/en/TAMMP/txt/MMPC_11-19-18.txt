Speaker 1:          00:00:01       Hey, what's going on is bill burns is time for the Monday morning podcast for Monday, November 18th, 2018 what's going on? How I, yeah. Um, as you can tell, uh, I am not using my fucking mixer or anything right now. I left everything at home. Um, I'm, I'm doing a little staycation with my wife staycation all I ever wanted. Um, and we're having a great time. All right. And if there's other married people out there, I highly recommend it. It's cheap. It's a great way to reconnect with your spouse and be like, oh yeah, we love each other. Remember, I totally forgot. You know, he'd get all caught up in your job. You got the kid, the, the, the, the fucking termites took over your fucking house. Whatever the hell's going on in your world. He didn't just start taking each other for granted. Um, so we've been out here for a couple of days, having a good time.

Speaker 1:          00:00:58       Um, it's weird though. Once you have a kid, then you go on a staycation and you're loving it, but then you know your kids staying with the relatives and then you miss your kid. So you know, I don't know, whatever, what are you going to do? And he is hilarious. I smoked a cigar last night, right. And um, I didn't finish it. So this morning I went down to the, uh, the hotel pool, which was fucking gigantic. And I already had it in my head that I was going to do 10 laps there and back counting is one. And this thing was like the one of the biggest fucking pools I've ever been. And it was like literally two and a half times the size of, uh, you know, even the average hotel pool. I mean the deep end was eight feet and then 10 feet. I mean this is an old school law in anything but a diving board.

Speaker 1:          00:01:46       You know, that's how old I am. I remember you'd go to a fucking hotel and not only did the hotel have an actual deep end, you know, cause now you go there. The things that like fucking four feet deep, no diving is written all around the whole pool. Um, but back in the day, man, you'd fucking show up and it was a giant pool at the deep end, they'd have a fucking diving board and they would just say, hey man, you want to break in? That could drown yourself. You know, we have all the facilities out there for you to succeed. It just that. Um, so anyways, I went down there and I swam around and like I always have to go like the length of the pool underwater and like in order to make it, I had to come up to the surface and then do the crawl really quickly just to get to those final like four feet.

Speaker 1:          00:02:34       Um, and I was so god damn out of breath and I still get like freaked out when I'm in pools and shit because I saw jaws at a certain age. It's why I can't go in the fucking ocean. And I was still thinking like, what if there's a, there's a fucking alligator, you know, some Douche bag drug dealers, you know, our fucking boxer or rich person, you know, those are the people, you know, some fucking Saudi Arabian fucking print buys a house in the Hollywood hills, you know, they always, they always, they always like fucking have a pet cheetah or some shit, you know, and then everybody has the exotic cats and how this dude's got to top everybody else and he gets a fucking alligator and the thing gets loose and then slips into the pool. I think that's like, that's the shit that I think about when I go swimming fucked. Um, especially in a pool that big where I felt like I was in a lake. Um, but anyways, so nia ends up coming down, right. And I told her it was like 10 in the morning and I still had like the, a little bit of that cigar left. I got Michael Back to Rome since smoke the rest of that cigar, she goes, grows at 10 in the morning, you're going to smoke a cigar at 10 in the morning. She goes, what? Wait you, what are you a fucking crime boss?

Speaker 1:          00:03:51       Uh, I did. I really married a fucking hilarious woman. Um, but anyways, um, before I tell you more about my staycation, all I ever wanted, um, I got to tell you about the, uh, the Patrice.

Let's, let's talk. Let's talk about, I dunno what I want to talk about, man. Other than fucking staycations fucking rule. Uh, let's talk about the Ohio state fucking buckeyes. All right? Can somebody explain to me how the fuck those guys are always in the playoff talk. It just blows my fucking mind. How will you ranked 10th in the country and you're still going to be one of the top four fucking teams.

Speaker 2:          00:11:21       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:11:21       How come college football cannot get that fucking right. I don't get how you could let up 50 over 50 fucking points to the Goddamn Maryland. Terrapins

Speaker 1:          00:11:32       you got a football team had been there. They're fucking mascot. Is a turtle fucking drops 50 fucking points on you. They just, they're always in it. I don't, I don't get it. That fucking year two, when they had the same record is Penn state and Penn state beat them head to head and Penn state stays home in Ohio state goes, I don't know what the fuck what they have on the board there. But once again, once we, in the end it, you know, something I used to like Ohio state, but now to me that becoming like the Alabama of the fucking north and now I'm just fucking rooting against them. They get all these fucking calls, it gets kids, kids. It's fucking ridiculous. Um, so Michigan, Ohio state is going to be the motherfucking game next week. I cannot wait for this game. I don't really hate Ohio state, but I just, you know, that that always bugged me that Penn state didn't fucking get in.

Speaker 1:          00:12:29       You know, it's hard cause I love Jason Lawhead and these in Ohio state fans, so that there was that, that's the one thing that prevents me from fucking hating on Ohio state. But you know, even Ohio state Buckeye Fan, she got to admit, I mean, what the fuck did this, there's something going on. You're not going to admit it. You know, it takes a, it takes a huge fucking sports fan to look at his team and be like, oh, you know, yeah, yeah. And did that, that was probably wrong there. Um, it's not like I fucking do that. Right. And I fucking stick up for all my teams. I'm a hypocrite. What do you want from me? I'm the typical fucking guy. Anyways, Michigan, Ohio state. This is going to be the fourth time Jim Harbaugh is going to go into Columbus or staying at home, whatever. He's going into Columbus this weekend and he's got to go in.

Speaker 1:          00:13:13       He has to fucking good at gun. He doesn't have to get it done cause there's no better head coach out there. So I think we'll be fine. But Michigan is fucking do. All right. And I actually think that the, that'll have the fact that Ohio state led up 50 points, um, against God there. Maryland is actually a bad thing for Michigan because, you know, I mean, I've listened. I've been just fucking reconnected with my wife all fucking weekend, which has been awesome. So I've been like sports mia, so I didn't see any of it. I just saw the highlights and, uh, there's fucking coach there. Jesus Christ. And I mean, he, he, he, every, none of that looked football related. It looked like he fucking, you know, his house burned down. His fucking wife left them. I mean the emotion that I went to ask, what's his name? Jesus Christ. Irvine. Urban. Urban Meyer. That's what the fuck it is. Poor bastard man. He was acting like dead fucking guy there that was trying to get on the supreme court.

Speaker 1:          00:14:23       The hell was his name. Cavenaugh right. That's fucking like how fucking weird is that guy's life right now, Kevin on where he's just sitting there like what the fuck was that? What was that like to get catapult it to that level of fame for something so fucking horrific. And then they just like, yeah, I guess there wasn't enough there. Anyways, get on with your life and your dream. See you later. Like I what? This has to be a name for that cause now it's like he isn't famous anymore or is quickly going to go away. Like I'm that guy there. They were going after with a for Sean, Shandra Levy Levy, right. Remember that? And everybody always goes, Oh yeah, the nine 11 came and that knocked that fucking story off the front page and it wasn't that guy relieved and it turns out he didn't fucking do it. So it kind of fucked over his whole God damn career. But that, that is, is there a name out there in the Zeit geist, that fucking word that I've learned this week? Is there a name so that that you have that level of fucking pay fame for something horrific and then all of a sudden like you know, it just, it, you get acquitted or whatever, just fucking goes away and then you just sit in there like, what the fuck was that?

Speaker 3:          00:15:43       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:15:43       Does it have a name? It's got to be somehow related to Oj Simpson. You know, guy, the trail or the fucking century. Everybody's saying he fucking did it. At least on the fucking white people were saying that country got all fucking divided. Then all of a sudden they're like, no, he's innocent. Then that's it. Then he just fucking drives around.

Speaker 3:          00:16:05       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:16:06       He could've got his life back together if she didn't kill two people that were the dominant, like as far as numbers, like population, you know what I mean? Like so white people cared. So you know, and white people are fucking everywhere for the most part, you know. So then Oj, you know, Jay likes to golf, so he's going to run into a bunch of white people. You know, he fucked up. Next time he does a double murder. He needs to pick a group of people that aren't represented so well at country clubs. Then I think he'll be able to, you know, kind of slip back into a society. Am I giving Oj, uh, tips on how to kill the next to people? I mean, I think I am. Oh, guess what I fucking did. Guess what all fucking freckles did. Uh, I went out and I bought three pairs of slacks and I'm really comfortable with it.

Speaker 1:          00:17:07       I'm 50 years old and I finally decided that I'm going to dress my age. I'm going to look good. Does, I'm not going to lie to you. I was looking in the mirror, you know, I'm in fucking great shape. I put a few pounds on what this day case and all I ever wanted. I put it on a few, um, some fucking calories. I've had a few, but then again, too few to mention. Um, I'll tell you right. And I am a beet salad eating motherfucker. Man. That shit fucking keeps me on track, you know, that's a nice fucking wake up call. You know, if I could just fucking lay off the God booze, I get my flat stomach back again. But you know, I have a little hangover for being on the road, you know, the same way if I went out and ate Mcdonald's and fine, you know, I started craving that. I was fucking hitting the bottle too hard. So I got to, uh, you know, that's what's cool about hanging with my wife because she doesn't throw it down the way I do, you know, just something, she's just like, all right bill. Okay, all right. And I'm like, all right. And then she also drinks shit that I don't like, like champagne and fucking wine. So I'm like, you want another glass of wine? I'm like, Eh, not really.

Speaker 1:          00:18:25       I like grapes, but I mean, how many can you fucking have? You know, it's weird. Um, anyways, fuck was I talking about slacks? Right. So we went out and I bought myself a pair of navy blue, a pair of black slacks or near kept calling him trousers. She's like, are they going to him your trousers? Right. Which always reminds me of that fucking Louis Ck joke when he was talking about a, whenever he would call phone sex, he would always get that 80 year old woman on the phone going, I'm taking off your trousers. Um, anyways. Uh, yeah. And I got to admit last night I wore my fucking, my trousers on stage and a benefit for the American Legion out here. Um,

Speaker 2:          00:19:21       yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:19:22       And it had a sport coat on the whole fucking thing. Just dress my goddamn age. And other than being a little more hot on stage, because I basically was wearing a jacket I like, is there a name for that? Talking through a yawn.

Speaker 2:          00:19:37       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:19:37       No Dad used to always do that. He goes, you know, I'll tell you bill, you know, can I have a good show tonight? Um, but anyways, I did a show last night, so John's sites, the American legion, me, it started off, it was just going to be me and Joe to Rosa. He goes, you know, to raise some money for the veterans, um, and all of that shit. And uh,

Speaker 1:          00:20:05       so I was like, yeah man, I'd love to do it. And this fucking place, I always forget them, the number of it, it's American Legion forget, but it's a legendary one and the main room, they're like everybody from like led Zepplin to like Humphrey Bogart has been in there like Zeplin I guess, uh, one time after one of their gigs at the form of some ended up chilling out there, possibly jam and an or something. I don't know what, but um, they used to have like, you know, rallies and stuff, stay away back in the day. I, it goes back to like world war one and they have like all of this stuff upstairs. All this,

Speaker 2:          00:20:40       yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:20:41       memorabilia. It's weird, right? For wars and stuff like weaponry and all that type of shit is really fucking amazing. So it started, you know, we're, Joan was just like, hey, you know, you and to Rosie want to come down. And you know, we always go down there and shit. And he goes, we'll make you fucking honorary members and all that, but they get the fuck outta here. We can't be members were not veterans. They're like, no, no, no, no, no. We'll fucking, uh, you know, we have guys like you that never did shit that we actually give you a little fucking one of those cub scout army hats. I was like, all right, we will laugh. And we're like, oh yeah, we'll fucking do it. So next time I talked to John, he goes, all right, listen, it, it, it got a little bigger, a Kale, wk Los got behind it, the radio station.

Speaker 1:          00:21:23       And then next thing you know, um, we're doing a comedy show upstairs and after the comedy show downstairs in the VIP, the Slutkin Eagles of death metal, you know, I, I've done a play a show. I was like, get the fuck out of here. You kidding me? He goes, yeah, now. And he was just like, you know, hey, you know, they're saying they'll jam with the, you want to do a song. And like I just didn't have, I didn't have time to get something together or whatever. And I also just wanted to go down and, uh, and just watch the band. Um, cause I've always wanted to see them. There's so many fucking bands I've always wanted to see live. It's just, I'm always on the Goddamn road. So, and it's always like a, hey, we, we have, we have a show out here. And it's like, oh yeah, when's your show?

Speaker 1:          00:22:11       And it's always right as I fucking leave, you know, so I miss everything. So, uh, anyways, I finally got to see, uh, Jesse Hughes Fuck live man and am Timan and one of the fucking greatest front men I've ever seen in my life. The way he was performing downstairs. And by the way, downstairs at the, in this American legion, that bar was when they did, um, um, the, the, the scene in the shining when, when Jack Nicholson was talking to the bartender, the shot that's over his shoulder from the, the, the bartenders POV point of view in the business there, um, was actually up whatever the fuck they shot in Oregon. I forget what they shot up, but like, but when they did his over, um, for the bar, they shot it down there. So that's the bar over in the corner. And then on the stage, the eagles of death metal, a plan.

Speaker 1:          00:23:05       And there Jesse Hughes was like the performance he put on, he would have murdered at Madison Square Garden and he was downstairs in front of like 120 people. She has fucking pouring sweat, fucking just, you know, all the front men moves. He was so fucking good. At one point I just started laughing like, how the fuck do I even consider myself a performer when there's a guy like this out here? Then he had this bad ass chick on base. The drummer was fucking kid. All they had for drums was, did they? Like, it was a bass drum of floor Tom and a snare, like quest love's, uh, set up back in the day. And, um, and the amount of music that that drummer got out of it, it just, it was just, it was fucking unbelievable. And I got to meet some of the people in the band afterwards. It was a really, was a incredible night. I tell you, man, you know, I'm not gonna lie to you, man. My life does not suck. So, um, anyways, do look at that fucking score, man. The fucking cults absolutely smoked the titans and the titans absolutely smoked the Patriots. And I believe we beat the cults. Like, how the fuck do you bet? How does anybody fucking gamble on the NFL this year mean? It doesn't make any fucking sense. There's like no consistency.

Speaker 2:          00:24:33       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:24:35       Anyways, it's thanksgiving. Everybody.

Speaker 2:          00:24:38       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:24:39       It's thanksgiving. And guess what? I got a new fucking, uh, I got a new person that I've been following on a, well, I can't follow them on youtube because I don't, can't figure out how to fucking figure out what my password is. So it always tells me to sign in. It's a big pain in the ass, but it's just guy. Uh,

Speaker 2:          00:25:02       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:25:02       Johnny, he's brought, it's spelt the Italian way and he's out of San Francisco and he goes, uh, like it looks like almost like, it almost looks like Giovanni Kinda by of a mild dyslexia. So I can't quite remember how it's spelled, but he just goes by Johnny and he goes like, go z. He's like, my name's Johnny. I live on the hill. Oh, here it is. A Gi, a n n I north beach.

Speaker 2:          00:25:35       All right,

Speaker 1:          00:25:38       so it looks like Gianni, but he says Johnny and he starts all his fucking, this guy is such an incredible, listen to this shit. I'll just play his, this is his intro. Let me see if the supply, wait a minute, wait a minute. I love this fucking guy. Here we go.

Speaker 3:          00:25:58       But every day I go down to the village to buy the food that I'm going to cook. Welcome to what's left of the Italian emerging neighborhood in San Francisco.

Speaker 1:          00:26:12       And that's it right there. And he's just staring into the camera. Like, this guy's just a fucking real deal. And I've been threatening for fucking years now to a, I was gonna make a Sunday gravy and I watched him make his, and now I have the confidence, but dude, he's got these fucking garlic mashed potatoes that he may his eggplant Parmesan. And I just been like sitting here watching this shit and I was looking at his potatoes. It's like, man, I'm going to fucking make those four. Um, but Thanksgiving you got to just, I, I is what does it, Gianni G I a n n I, North Beach. You got to look up as fucking garlic, mashed potatoes. They look unbelievable. Do you have that? A little bit of Turkey, some stuff and cranberry sauce. He fucking kid mates over. You're going to have a great um, great guide them thanksgiving. So, um, anyways, I've just been sitting here watching all of that shit. And then I was watching his fucking thing.

Speaker 1:          00:27:19       I don't even know how I'm going to be able to do this fucking justice. I might have to just put up the clip, but I ended up watching this other random guy, this Canadian dude who was smoking and drinking while he's cooking and he was making a Sunday gravy in his apartment, was hot as shit, and he had the fan going and he was dropping like he think I curse. This guy was dropping f bombs like you can't believe. And then out of nowhere he just starts telling this story about this. One of the things that I hate the most about human behavior other than war and all the dumb shit that we do, um,

Speaker 1:          00:27:57       the obvious dumb shit is when you're next in line in someone's trying to creep into the side just to fucking ask a quick question. Like nothing gets my fucking blood going. Right? So he tells us hilarious story about how this woman's angle and in and how he fucking basically made a quick move and fucking got both his forums up on the desk. And then the lady goes, he's just randomly Texas. A smoke break tells this story. She goes, then she goes, excuse me, sir, I think I'm next. And he's like, oh, that's way you have it wrong, because if you are next, you'll be standing where I was standing. And then he did an edit and it just cuts to him going back to cooking. He's got the cigarette dangling his mouth that he goes, you push the fucking cunt to try to fuck with me on a hot fucking day when I'm trying to get my drugs. So my doctor gives you fucking wait like everybody else. You have fat fucking whore. And then he just goes. Anyway, it goes back to cook. I must have sent that clip to like fucking 20 people. Um, my wife obviously didn't find it as funny as I did, but I dunno, they just, I don't know.

Speaker 1:          00:29:18       You know what kills me? I actually, I called and Kathleen Madigan's, uh, Sirius radio show and gas we'll give him was on and Lewis Black was on. And uh,

Speaker 1:          00:29:33       it was fucking hilarious cause I was telling them how much I like to cook and all of that. And they were all going like, oh my God, I had no idea. Like this is just, this is, this is almost weird. They hear that you're into this type of stuff. Like I think like they'll like most people that they just think I'm this angry guy. I have anger issues. Um, I wish people didn't think, I hate that people think that I, I mean I, it's my fault that people think that, but I hate that people think that I just walk around like fucking cock sucking motherfucker. I'll, I don't, I mean that's just how I react to most social situations. So I guess, does that make me an angry guy? I Dunno. I don't fucking know. But I was kind of like, I was loving talking to those, cause I'm a huge fan of all of them, but I was like taken aback.

Speaker 1:          00:30:20       Like, wow. They like, they really think I'm a fucking psycho and uh, I dunno.

You're like, oh my God, this is the first season of the real housewives from Atlanta. Look how young they all are. Um, hey, gorgeous. I was just telling everybody how great it is to reconnect with your spouse on a staycation. Oh, I have a one day, right? Yeah. Okay. All right. And you're going to get off your phone here and help me out. I was just texting me about things. What's going on there? How are you doing this?

Speaker 1:          00:42:51       I'm all right. Instagram Chata Instagram chat or do you remember, uh, when we discuss, you know, that woman, um, she started posting yes. You know, she went from just posting regular pictures to sort of, uh, you know, not overly hoary, but she wouldn't show them to her parents types of pictures. And then her male friends who were in relationships, uh, their significant others were having difficulty with it and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. Right. This, this one is from a lady. Okay. Uh, she said just dare bill bird. Just, uh, just wanted to reach out and say thanks for touching on that Instagram topic with uh, the female too close for comfort with the husband. Um, I been with my boyfriend for almost a year and have issues with his social media habits. I'm 25 and he's 21. Oh my God. Uh, hello darkness had, I mean, you know, he's actually like emotionally a bang in a fucking younger dude.

Speaker 1:          00:44:02       He doesn't have money to pay for food and, but he'll fuck you. I want to read the rest of this. So those sun in the morning, sorry, I'm 25 and he's 21 and I didn't realize how unhealthy it was until I was 23 so I keep excusing it, talking about his behavior, but it makes my skin fucking crawl. I don't feel comfortable when he snapchats his single female friends he had before we together because the techs go away and they send pictures. He makes me feel like I'm not trusting him but I would never do that with another male and it's just not something I want to have going on in any relationship with my, I don't agree with 100% of the things you say, but I agree with a lot and it was cool to hear a male perspective on it that isn't biased towards the situation, especially yours because from what I can tell, it seems like you have a healthy marriage, huh?

Speaker 4:          00:45:00       Jesus.

Speaker 1:          00:45:01       We didn't do this staycation. I think you were going to kill me now. It took a weight off my shoulders that I'm not unreasonable for feeling uncomfortable with it. Uh, love the show makes washing dishes more enjoyable. How just a little though, cause I hate touching soggy food. Am I right? Absolutely. You are. Soggy food is the fucking worst. That's what they invented those rubber gloves for. Exactly. It wasn't to save your hand.

Speaker 1:          00:45:31       no, but she made the little space there with the tongue sticking out. Like you know, yes, I know that it makes fun of that.

Speaker 4:          00:45:37       Right. Uh, okay. Yeah. Um, yeah that's, yeah. Your boyfriend's 21 honey, like that's just like I said, are you high right now? No. I mean I just smoke earlier but like, yeah cause like, hey honey. Oh, but he is, like I said, he's 21 but you know, emotionally he's 17 years old and he's not gonna you know, he's going to be like, Whoa, why are you becoming such a big deal? That's called guests

Speaker 1:          00:46:05       lighting. Um, so all right, slow down white person here. Gaslighting. I know it's not like a black word that does not something gaslighting for white people.

Speaker 4:          00:46:19       Gaslight outside of a town house. No gas lighting is like making somebody like question, you know, there there's sanity or their reactions to things when they're having like actually a normal reaction to something. So she says, Hey, I don't feel comfortable with you snapchatting all these girls. You're my boyfriend. And he says so many effective, like what are you talk like, what are you freaking out about? Like we're just not a big deal. Yeah, yeah. That's gas lighting. Oh like you know God damn well, like she says, she doesn't deal with any of her male friends. If she was snap chatting, hanging out with a bunch of dudes, he would probably feel some type of way. It might. It's so, that's fascinating. So for the other white people listening, does gas lighting live in the flipping the script world? No Way. What happened? [inaudible] it's not, it's not even as like that was part of the English white man. 50 years old. I, I've never heard that. Oh just went away. It died. Oh my laptop died. Oh Jesus. Wait. Cause I saw the next things and banging the neighbor or banging my neighbor. What was lacking

Speaker 1:          00:47:30       in my room now to that one. Sorry. Now I have to go onto my phone. Oh, there's no way you look up gate. When you in the meantime, look up fucking gaslighting. You. Tell me when the, when that came out because you know I could be wrong. God knows I am more times than not.

Speaker 1:          00:48:18       Factory Nets. Yeah. Did you look, are you looking up gas line?

Speaker 4:          00:48:22       Yes. No, you're not. You're texting somebody freaking out about, man. I mean, I'm just, hey, your guess. Like right now, man, you're making it seem like I'm not all right. Sliding verb. It's in the dictionary. Manipulate someone by psychological means into questioning their own sanity. That's in the dictionary. The dictionary.

Speaker 1:          00:48:43       Well, we'll look at that and yeah, once again, I'm wrong. I apologize.

Speaker 4:          00:48:47       11 warning signs of gas lighting. How to know if you're a victim of gas lighting as a whole.

Speaker 1:          00:48:54       Yeah, but there's also like a gas light that's outside that you can't tell me some point wasn't, wasn't at some point slang and then the dictionary was like, all right, enough people are saying and now it's a word. I mean that that does happen, right? Yeah. I'm trying to look at articles. Did Ben Franklin started? Yeah,

Speaker 4:          00:49:08       it was used in 2016 I don't know when people started using it, but you're right, it like, yeah, the last couple of years it's become a word that people use to describe, you know,

Speaker 1:          00:49:20       like the word Zeitgeists. I finally know what that means. But

Speaker 4:          00:49:24       here's the thing, Bill. Just cause you're just now finding out what it means. It doesn't mean that it

Speaker 5:          00:49:28       didn't, you know,

Speaker 4:          00:49:30       exist before.

Speaker 1:          00:49:32       No, no. I'm not saying I'm well read, but I talked to a lot of people and I hadn't heard anybody say it like all of a sudden not. That's the fucking thing. People were saying. All right, what do I know?

Speaker 4:          00:49:41       All right, 15 I'm finance. So it goes back a little bit. [inaudible] you're like a paralegal over there. Really know how to use the Google. All right,

Speaker 1:          00:49:50       nuts. Um, listen, lady motors. Listen Lady, are they giving me shit? This somebody you keep regurgitating bullshit about the apple phone factory nuts. The people who died jumped because of insurance payoffs. fox.com had a clause in oh pay outs and the employees contracts that states a Foxcom. If they died on the job, the family will receive 50 k. That's why all those people jump out to give their family a lump payout. Who was I? Shit. No, but here's the thing. Even if it did well, if you weren't so

Speaker 4:          00:50:28       fucking underpaid, so you're, you're basically, you're going to jump out the, I'll fucking kill yourself for a teacher's salary. And exactly. And so what does that mean? Is that somehow make it better that blag no, they're doing it because they wanted the insurance. It's like that's a horrible thing regardless. I know they've put nets up, they put nets up so he wouldn't jump up. And then they'd played soothing music to try to calm that down. And then they were considering, uh, elevating their pay, which was obviously the fucking problem. So Google dance shit. Fuck up Steve Jobs, Dick out of your mouth and stop trying to make it like, you know, it's, it's, you know, all they're just doing it for the payout. It's like, what kind of Weirdo are you to even say that? That's fine. That's one of my favorite jokes from I act white people. It's another thing when white people like white people tell black people how to behave around the cops. Just do what they say. I don't understand what the problem is. Why is it not my experience? Can I read the next one? Alright. Yeah. Banging my roommate. I'm reading the fallout as read by the lovely Mia. Hey Billy bitch sits.

Speaker 4:          00:51:39       I'm sure you don't block the microphone down the bottom. I'm 22 years old in my last semester of university and I live with one girl who happens to be hot. I found myself in the situation by only needing a four month term sublease to finish my final semester. A friend of mine who was moving out of state to complete her nursing placement, offered to sublet her room to me at a very reasonable price for the quality of apartment I accepted without knowing or meeting my soon to be roommate. The hot roommate was briefed on me and was okay with living with a guy. Fast forward two weeks in the living together were banging on the couch. Well, that escalated quickly.

Speaker 4:          00:52:16       Oh, there's somebody at the door. I'll keep reading. Um, we're banging on the couch from this moment to about mid October. I was untouchable. Insert picture of Muhammad Ali after a knockout. It was around that mid October point where she decided to stop putting up with me because she started talking to another guy from her hometown. Seven hours away. Where I have a problem is not with a heartbreak or heart feeling. So come on now. It's more with the level of resentment on her side. She has gotten really cold, standoffish, and passive aggressive with me. It's to a point where she goes to her room. When I get home, we don't really talk anymore. What have I done? How do I fix it? I'm not sure I see a future with her, but she's cool and I'd rather not have her hate me. She was a pretty laid back person and her mom constantly bugging her about getting a real job.

Speaker 4:          00:53:04       She was a waitress at the beginning of November. That is a real job. At the beginning of November, I got a job at a consulting firm, which I worked really hard to get. She didn't care in the slightest while we were hooking you up. She also told me constantly about the other guy she was talking to. Oh baby. We agreed to be open, but I found it a much looking for a game plan here. Long Time Fan of the show. Thanks. And Go fuck yourself. So what happened? They started paying somebody caught feelings. What happened? He caught feelings even though he said where I have a problem is not with a heartbreak or hurt feelings. Yeah. She basically banged him because she was talking, it was cause she was trying to get over some, some guy while we were, because were all we were hooking up. She also constantly told me about the other guy she was talking to.

Speaker 4:          00:53:50       Right. So this was um, this was, uh, between guys bang. You know, it's kind of like a buffer. Like cause you, you're in between a rebound or you're kind of wishing to be with somebody else. So you ended up bagging somebody who's really into you and it's giving you a lot of compliments and you know, the Dick is right next door cause your roommates. So that's super easy and got to like get up and get all dressed up. It's like, you know, you'll just take it cause you think I'm the best and um, you know, you got used, you got played. Um, and, and you get used, you got to bang a hot chick, but he does it. But you didn't really, did you not hear the rest of it? Like answered the door. You don't remember. Oh, right now he's, he's upset because she just dropped him like a hot potato and she's being really cold to him and it's not really talking to them.

Speaker 4:          00:54:42       Shit. She, she fucking shit. It's over. That's fucking great. And it's a thing. Who gives a fuck? You've got to bang this hot chick and then she's fucking, she acted the way a guy usually acts, which is the best. We just walk away from it. Women were all right. She just walked away. Get on with your fucking life. Exactly. It's done. Yeah. Get on with your fucking life. You're 22 years old, so perhaps you haven't heard the saying don't shit where you eat. Don't ever fucking your roommate because when it goes bad or when it's over, very rarely can you just exist and it's not exactly, that's why it's fucking awesome because now she's just totally blown them off. They live together and then it's like perfect. So I would just sit down and just say, hey listen, I realize we're not hooking up anymore, which is totally cool.

Speaker 4:          00:55:39       But like you barely even talked to me. Like I don't have any fucking hard feelings over it. So like, you know, you want some fruit loops? Yeah, yeah. Maybe try to like Kinda call her out on being immature about the situation. And it's like, you don't gotta treat me like shit now just because we're not fucking, cause Alyssa, I, you know, I was sort of teasing you before, but it's not cool that she's just rude to you now that she's had your way with you and she's done with your deck and she's so funny. She's like the greatest roommate ever. All she wanted to do was fuck you for awhile. And then she left. What is the problem? She's on my mount Rushmore of fucking roommates. I mean, the fact that you got some bangers for it, cause you could have gotten friend zoned. She's literally, she's sitting there constantly talking about other guys that she's seeing. You could've gotten friends zone. So you know, at least she got laid. Jesus Christ silver lining. But glass is not half full. The glass is full and your bowls are empty. Them all right, condoms. Uh, hey, really stretched nuts. It's a lady. I don't know what that means. Oh, from my lady. The ladies are all writing in now. I love it. Uh, my boyfriend can't bust and not what the condom on. Wait, did I believe they're in parentheses? Lose it.

Speaker 4:          00:57:04       Now let me read it again because I'm not having fun reading condoms. Just make sure you're talking to my dog and we've just done, isn't it right here? Where's the microphone? No, but somewhere on the phone, on the minor, my boyfriend campus to know the condom mind loser. Um, he insists it's because of the condom. You know, he's lying to you, right? We got into a big argument about it. We have about it. The sensation is different. Duh. Of course it is. But when I told him it was different for both of us, he didn't believe me. Listen guys, the walls slash hurdles between us work both ways. It's like a pap smear and went away. What does it keep going away? I Dunno. I hang on putting the password in. Ooh, okay. Um, it feels like a pap smear. Is it smears? It yet issued the fucking house and you're a woman. You should know what it is or putting a beer bottle and my cooter. It's just friction. Oh, you're one of the, I taught just like the guys. Girls. Huh? By the way, you look like someone stretched Alaskan condom over skeleton. That's so me.

Speaker 4:          00:58:23       What are your learn views about the condoms situation? My boyfriend is a, we don't say that word anymore. If Nia is around, maybe ask her, would love to hear your views. It's still waiting on that nut. Oh my God. I love this email. All right. I can answer this. She's taking this personally subconsciously because he's not getting there. That that's a reflection on her. He is lying to her about busting and not, and a condom just wants to rob dawg her. Oh, I thought he was already fucking her with a condom and he couldn't do it. Oh. Oh, I thought she was saying my boyfriend campus condom on. So I dunno if that means no, this guy's like listen, if you've just fucking are constantly, if you're not, if you weren't wearing a condom in your last relationship or you weren't in a relationship and you were just fucking jerking off with your hand when you put a condom on, it feels like you still wearing your pants. All right. And, and yeah, and if you know this, all kinds of things that can fuck with you. Watch too much fucking

Speaker 1:          00:59:22       porn, you can have performance problems is all that. I just think she's taking this like personally, I mean the fact that he can't bust it out with a condom on know then she's goes loser. That's like not cool. That's like hostile. Yeah. And so that's like defensive. That's what I'm guessing because there's a bunch of guys that are like, like a bunch of guys that like fucking are in longterm relationships to come up. I had that problem for a minute. I was going to say, I feel like that's normal. Yeah. Like so what you got, what you got to do is for him tell him to start jerking off with a condom on. It sucks. Get used to it. Yeah. You just sort of get used to it or don't fucking do anything for like a week or something and they'll be able to really be ready to fuck a fucking desk at that point and maybe that'll help. I would have my doctor drew, I don't know, but like, but I can tell you this

Speaker 4:          01:00:10       name, calling him and saying that he's a loser and all of that type of shit is, that's not the solution. Also it feels like a pap smear or putting a beer bottle in my cooter is just friction. Okay. Here's the thing. I feel pretty confident that this is a male pretending to be a female writing in because no woman would ever say it feels like a pap smear. What is it? Shmita Shmita is he, it is or a beer bottle in my cooter it's just friction. Women don't talk like this to stop playing around with these fucking email. He can file and they're fake. No, but sometimes people also feel like they have to be as dumb as me or as crude as I am. Listen guys, the walls slash hurdles between us work both ways. It feels like a passionate or print. Why is just friction a patch like no, because if you've had a pap smear, you would never,

Speaker 1:          01:01:10       Matt, I had one now. You did that. No, I got a complete checkup and you did not pass. I do. I make sure they checked me for everything. Fake letter. Fake News. You say that spoke. I don't know. I'm, I don't think it is. Yep. 100%. Okay. Roommate ran someone over, old Billy, the boner burglar. Um, as another person that I'm not good looking. This is the way it was good to, this is the shit that you get when you listen. This comes with putting yourself fucking out there. That's why when all these fucking women go on there, let me good God. People would never say this to a guy. Look at this person just said, I look like a fucking allows gang labs. He comes stretched over on a scale isn't, or a skeleton. That was brutal, but it was funny. It's fucking hilarious. And I can't argue it. I miss the fucking pretty accurate. I just know I don't like what I see. Oh look, I can kind of override skeleton. I don't give a fuck what that person thinks. I'm a good looking guy and I got a smoking hot wife, so hey, that's

Speaker 4:          01:02:20       not bad, right? Not Bad for a fucking lambskin condoms and a beautiful baby and everyone does their baby's beautiful. So take them. So that's it. Everybody likes us and we're popular. All right. Anyways. Oh, belief of boner burglar. I'm a 20 year old gay. It never runs. It's like, it's so never ends with a, the of people trash the way I looked at it, it has no effect on me. A, uh, so it's actually

Speaker 1:          01:02:45       kind of a good thing that doing for me. I'm a 20 year old guy in and I say what? I'm a 20 year old guy in and I stay with a roommate, I think as a test. Fido. All right. I stayed with a roommate who's very, very close friend of mine. I'll get right to it. I took a couple of mushrooms and was tripping my ass off for the first time. Everything was great until my roommate came in at the peak of my high and said he had something to tell me that was going to make me laugh. He proceeds to say he just ran a bitch over with his car and he said it like I should be proud of him. Bill. His ignorance about the situation was killing me. Yeah, that's assault with a deadly weapon. Aside from the situation being crazy. He thought this to me. He brought this to me mid trip. He kept saying nobody saw his plates and all that shit. Oh Jesus Christ with no regard for what he just did. What do I do bill? This guy really didn't give a shit. He ran somebody over and he killed my high. We also just signed a lease. FYI. The girl is okay. Much love to the lovely Nia over there and the little one. Big Fan. Big Fan

Speaker 4:          01:04:04       living with a psychopath, you should probably get out. Cause if he's couldn't do that to a stranger, what do you think he's going to do to you? That's a great point. Cause I was just, I was going to say she's all right. Well I think gives us

Speaker 5:          01:04:15       also, I like to leave, but he killed my high, like within the same sentence. Not only did he run somebody over, but he showed my, now what do I do? I really, I really liked how it said the also

Speaker 4:          01:04:27       doing it while you are tripping on mushrooms for you to really draw the line on the line. I think you need to sit down with them and be like, listen man, hold our young and yeah,

Speaker 4:          01:04:40       I mean listen, I think you just need to sit down with your roommate and just say, hey listen man. You know, if every time I'm tripping you're going to come in and talk about how he ran was over and ruin my high. This isn't going to work out. So what we need to do is get a schedule, put it up on the refrigerator, you know, I'll tell you what I'm doing shrooms. And then you just don't run over anybody that day. And if you do, and if you two just don't fucking tell me about it til I'm done. Fucking giggling in the corner.

Speaker 5:          01:05:18       Who are you people living with that goes for roommates? That you got to get it. Who were running people for Bang you and then not speaking to you. Like you guys need to make better life choice. No, that's like, well the first one, it was like a money situation. Like she, you know, he got the apartment because it's friends, you know, Blah Blah Blah. And then who are you people dating? Is it like a pad? Nia or a bottle of my cooter like, Ugh, man, I'm fucking lies and stupid emails. What is wrong with you? And you know, it's hilarious. I'm annoyed that this batch of emails today, I really am.

Speaker 1:          01:05:59       As you sit in here, watch rewatching season one of fucking, uh, the real housewives, but come on and listen. I'm a correct

Speaker 1:          01:06:08       Mara. And I can go with it. So my, all right, well this has been the hypocrite. Um, Nia, how do you write the staycation? One to 10, 10, 10 out of 10 and fucking great. I can't believe we have to come back tomorrow to real life. I know what I miss my little boo bear. I know. Me Too. So, uh, no, but I mean I think like a, you know, we ought to, we ought to do these. This was good for us. It was great for us is the best we've gotten along for fucking ever. Yeah, yeah, that's true. Yeah. All of a sudden you can just fucking chill for just literally, I mean we wasn't two and a half days. Nothing. Yeah. Nothing. You still stay in a, and I would think whatever the fuck you live, you could still, I don't give a fuck if you live outside of de Moines, go rent a nice place in de Moines order room service if they re yeah. Ah, Jesus shitting on everybody.

Speaker 5:          01:07:05       The waitress at brunch today. Uh, I was saying, Oh yeah, we're leaving tomorrow. Cause I was asking her if she's, you know, working the shift tomorrow cause she was so nice and I was like, oh we're leaving tomorrow. And she goes, okay, when are you coming back? And I was like, see that part? What part that uh, even ever heard that before. That part?

Speaker 1:          01:07:25       No, it's just more gas lighting.

Speaker 5:          01:07:29       No, no, no. That's like a, that's definitely a slang. That's definitely an urban slang. Um, okay.

That guy is, is like, there's so many fucking people that get onstage and call themselves entertained. They need to go fucking see that guy and be like, that's, that's, that's the way it's done. I was even sitting there being like, Jesus Christ, I should have been working hard or update with my slacks and sport coats. You dress like a gentleman. Hi. How are you? Like in slack?

Speaker 4:          01:10:10       Oh my God, I love you and slacks. I really do. I feel like men of a certain age should like try to just their dad. Hi, I'm bill. Hi, I'm bill. I saw this gentleman last night and he had to be in his forties or something. His genes were so baggy and they were just pooling around his ankles around his like old sneakers. His blazer was like down like passes, but it was just like if he was just like a sloppy mess and I'm like, I bet this person is actually like a nice person, but it's like you gotta get it together. I'm not trying to be shallow. It's not like, look sir everything. But there are a lot of it. No, you know what I said it's the first thing people, and this is the thing that questions matter. I feel just only being a dad for almost two years now. I can look at Dad's at malls and I can look at their genes and then I know how old they are. All this kid is like guys who had

Speaker 1:          01:11:14       guys who had kids in like the mid two thousands have faded true religion, jeans. It's all, yeah, it's all like sorta like white in the front on the thigh, all baggy in the big stupid ditch shoe in the back. Right. Because those things were like fucking loud. Even when they came out, I remember Bobby Kelly, Rich Foss, I that was just like those things to wear true religion jeans like everyday. And he was so proud of him, that true religion in fucking pull the tag. Oh my God. And they were boot cut. Oh my God. And then guys who guys 10 years older than them, they actually had jeans like when you just bought Levi's. So they show up and they have like a, like Kenny Club Soda Kenny Club Soda. Kenny shows up with the jeans that I wore when I used to listen to fucking heavy metal is genes. Genes are just genes. Yeah, just jeans. No, no passion, no stages. Just functional denim. And then what happened now is, uh, his pants. I never thought after they got baggy, they'd become tight again. But yesterday we were out there at the fucking mall. And how tight were that guy? That guy's fucking put. You could almost see his baseball bag from behind. I was fucking cry and laugh.

Speaker 1:          01:12:30       Yeah. And now you show like your ankles. Everybody's like walking around like they're gonna Start Moonwalk and we need to see a socks. My goal, Mj back in the day.
