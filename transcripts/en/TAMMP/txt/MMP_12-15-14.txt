Speaker 3:          00:09:03       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:09:04       I think when I'm talking about, all right. All I know is this Christmas and we're like fucking 10 days away and I haven't even fucking, oh, you know, Dasher and dancer and Prancer and victim. No, I don't, don't, I was standing there. He ain't giving it to dose, make comment and Cupid. Donna red bled sin. But do you recall, Oh man, what'd you shoot a reindeer. What'd you shoot a reindeer? What'd you do with what if your plane crashed up near the North Pole? You know, there it was. You couldn't shoot fucking Rudolph. That's like shooting Elvis. You can't do that shit. You gotta wait for him to Odey Odey sitting on the fucking reindeer toilet, which is basically what any words standing.

Speaker 3:          00:09:49       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:09:50       You know, I'm so fucking against technology. People are just, I've had it. I just fucking, I know all the shit that it does for you and how convenient it makes it and all of that bullshit. Oh, by the way, you know, piss me off. I was watching this, the fucking commercial where they talk about like the first, uh, you know how the first half time came about was basically people, you know, these fucking, you know, racist white guys. I mean, you know, they were back then, right? Jesus Christ the fuck.

Speaker 3:          00:10:22       Hmm.

Speaker 1:          00:10:22       Anybody in a striped fucking uniform with no face mask. I mean he, you could only imagine what was coming out or red Granger's miles back in the day. The Gallup and ghost straight. So they got this commercial where it's like supposed to be that era and these guys are playing football and then talking about how the first half time came around and basically how it came around was these guys were playing and a bunch of fucking ladies came by with some pop. They came by with like some coke or whatever, the f Pepsi of Fucking, I don't know what tab. I don't know what they brought.

Speaker 3:          00:10:52       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:10:53       The whole fucking thing is, you know, it's just a metaphor, right? It's like you're a guy, you're on point, you have a fucking goal and what happens? Pussy walks in the room and everything gets thrown to the wayside. And next thing you know, you're 53 going, wait a minute. What the fuck happened? Ah, I want it to be an astronaut. Hi. I wanted to learn how to play the Tuba. I wanted to own a fucking hair salon. What happened? Plus he came in the wrong, you took your eye off the ball and you started drinking some pop. I ain't know. They say that in the Midwest in fact, that they call it pop and then they say, pop, you want some pap? No. Do you have any soda? Soda? What's that? I can't do a Midwest accent. As you can see, I've gotta be out there hanging around with those cons. Um, hang on. I just remind me of something about the southern tour I want to do next. Fucking I type that in. So I write them st later. Anyways, so long story short, because the women's show up, these guys who are fucking knocking the hell out of each other, basically inventing the NFL, they stop

Speaker 1:          00:12:03       and they look at each other and like, hey, you know, maybe uh, one of them will give us a one of them fucking 23 is good news over there. What he say? What did we just knock off for like 15 minutes to go over there? A sprite? You know, the guy's like, what the fuck's is sprite? It doesn't exist yet. Douche bag. So, all right, let's get a coke. It has got to be Coca Cola, right? What was that? The first one? And they went over there. I mean, the original Coca Cola had a little bit of blowing it. Next thing you know, they're dumping it down her ass crack, right? The whole fucking gang goes out the window. But that's not the problem that I have with that commercial. The problem I have is in the middle of it, somebody takes an old timey camera, turns it around on them and does a selfie.

Speaker 1:          00:12:41       Now I know the people who made that commercial. I'm going to give him the credit to be like, they realize that no, we took a fucking selfie back then. Okay. No, we took a fucking selfie. Not only did you not take a Selfie, nobody smiled and photos back then. I don't know when the fuck that started, but if you look back in the day, nobody is smiling in photos unless you caught him off guard. Okay? They're doing a little Jig or some shit. And you took a picture with that fucking cannon. That fucking gunpowder fucking went up. Sorry for everybody's ears here. I didn't realize it was gonna be that loud. Fucking would go off in the background. Right?

Speaker 3:          00:13:14       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:13:14       And then you know that. Then the guy be like, you just take my fucking texture.

Speaker 3:          00:13:19       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:13:20       Yeah. What's all the smoke in there for? Do you keep that fucking witchcraft away from me, buddy? All right. Nobody fucking smile. You understand? When they took pictures of the native Americans. The reason why they didn't smile, they all fucking world was going to a help than a fucking hand basket by a bunch of fucking Douche bags whose ancestors were eventually going to walk around wearing those fucking beats by Dre, which aren't even that good ad folks. Oh, now they're wireless. Tell you what, fuck the technology making them fucking no invisible wires. Why don't you make them good? So somebody gave me, I got a fucking pair of those goddamn things. I was listening to a fuck fucking year and I finally just sat around. Any of these things aren't that good. I can hear the music, but it's not blowing my mind.

Speaker 3:          00:14:15       Okay?

Speaker 1:          00:14:16       You know what beats by Dre or, and this isn't against Dr Dre cause he already sold the company. He's sitting on $1 billion. Think he gives a fuck. He doesn't give a fuck. Plus I never fucking trash anybody. He's got a scar on the neck. Okay, that guy saw death stare it down one and then what? I'm going to come at him with. Where am I fucking PJ's? I don't think so. All right. And if you think I'm the kind of guy who's going to do something like that, you're listening to the wrong power podcast, my friend. Okay.

Depending on where you live, all your calls to wherever you are.

Speaker 1:          00:25:40       There's even a dial by name directory. You'll sound like a fortune 500 company, and more importantly, you'll never miss an important call ever again.

That's he voiced.com. Slash Bill. What do we had a hearing? Um, all right, back to the podcast, back to the fucking podcast where the folks to fucking put kiss you scared were include. Um, all right, what am I going to talk about here?

Speaker 1:          00:26:35       Uh, where do we go? Where do we owe, you know what? I had an acting Gig, uh, this past week and on Friday I got to work with an actor named Brad Carter, who you guys have seen in a zillion things. And I was actually imitating him, uh, back in the day when true detective came out and he played that inmate, you know, when a Matthew mcconaughey character goes into the guy, went Reggie to do regiment, do, do dat shit, fucking unbelievable actor. And next thing you know, old freckles gets an acting gig. And who am I sitting across from this same fucking dude? And he was so God damn funny and scary at the same time, all while eating Bologna sandwiches. That's all I can tell you about it. Uh, but my face still hurts from trying not to fucking blow takes, uh, you know, laughing cause he's such an end.

Speaker 1:          00:27:27       He always played like, like character actors are amazing to me. Like, uh, they just, how they make a living and how much they have to hustle and all that. And he was talking about how excited he was to do something that was, you know, had a comedy background and now he's always playing these psychos and everything. So we're on like whatever the 10th take. He's on like his fucking ninth fucking Bologna Sandwich cause he feels like he has to eat it to get into this character, which is totally fucking working. Right. And I, we ended up asking him, uh, he said, he mentioned he had to be on set the very next day at 7:00 AM and we're still shooting it like fucking 10 at night trying to get this fucking dog to walk into the room, sit down and look over at the camera. Right. And he says, hi. He goes, I got to be on set tomorrow at seven. I'm like, Jesus Christ, I don't know how you'd do it. He goes, no, I'm loving. I love it, man. I'm happy to be working. So he's talking about how, oh, we always play psychos. I go, Whoa, what do you, what are you playing tomorrow? And he goes, I'm playing a rape.

Speaker 2:          00:28:23       Okay. In

Speaker 1:          00:28:25       a independent movie called eat me. Um, that's what the debt is being made right now. So look out for Brad Carter. He shooting eat meat right now and a watch true detective and look them up. He also, um, had brain surgery and uh, for this little thing that he had going on, I'll let him explain it, but this is unbelievable video where he's playing guitar. He's a musician while they're checking out his brain to see if they put the thing in the right place, it's fucking unbelievable. We'll, we'll upload it. But, uh, you know, if you really like character actors and people just disappear into it to the point you want you to go. And where the fuck do I know this guy? Wait, no, I fucked Dorthy and Brad Carter. That shit man, right there. Um, so anyways, let's, let's get onto some shit here that I'm really excited about.

Speaker 1:          00:29:15       I know that I've been bitching. I know that I've been moaning. I know that I'd been bitch moaning and complaining the whole time about this construction downstairs. Guess what? Everybody, it's fucking done. The motherfucker is done. There's a couple of little knickknacks. They get a stick in these fucking, I dunno, the plates over the light switches. Little Bullshit, like that little fucking bullshit like that and it fucking awesome. Absolutely beautiful. Absolutely gorgeous. It costs me a fucking fortune. I will never make my money back in this house. And I say go vegan right now and try to live to be 106, but I've just made the decision that I'm not leaving. I'm not fucking leaving, right. Just all the cons. I'm erasing all the fucking cops who have lived here. Um, exercise and the demons of every one of these motherfuckers that went cheap. You know, I got this ugly ass. Fuck. I don't know. There's like, there's no, I don't know what to tell you what the color is of the rug and the bedroom that I'm in right now. So I'm thinking, you know, there's hardwood floors underneath this fucking thing. So I started to pull back the rug, you know, for a future project and guess what's under the rug? Fucking plywood.

Speaker 1:          00:30:31       And underneath the plywood is the original hardwood floors.

Speaker 1:          00:30:36       What kind of a fucking animal? You know what it was? It was probably done in the 70s you know, when wall to wall carpet was just considered so fucking plush. What it was is after years of people just walking around on ward, first it was dark, right? Was probably stone or some shit, right? He lived in a fucking cave and then you just had stone in the fucking shit was cold. Nobody could afford rugs, right? It's expensive or whatever. Your wife started net and one by the time she finished it, she had tuberculosis and she died. And every time he looked at the rug, he thought of her. She gave it to somebody else. So people's feet, they were sick of being cold. They get, you know, getting splinters and that type of shit, which, you know, buy it back. Then you got an infection, then you fucking died or somebody came in and saw your foot off.

Speaker 1:          00:31:22       Right. Is he had a fucking know you bit down on a fucking angel, whatever that happened because there was no anesthesia. So after centuries of that bullshit wall to wall carpeting seemed like a good idea, you know? And uh, it wasn't, you know, what's the most disgusting thing when it comes to copywriting is carpeting in a bathroom every once in a while. Right? I like, you know, you, when they have like an open house, I'm one of those constant just walks into your house and I'm not going to buy it cause I just want to look at it and get ideas and just see how's this fucking douche limit. Right. It's like when you go to Elvis's house, he always felt like a creep. You know, you've got to Elvis's house and you want to go in there and laugh at him. Then you walk in and you realize this was his home, and I'm walking around looking for peanut butter and banana sandwiches because I want to laugh at this guy and it's just like sky accomplished more than a weekend than I ever did in my life.

Speaker 1:          00:32:17       And he's buried in the backyard and we just won't give the guy at the piece that he deserves that even spell his fucking name right in the grave. One of the most exploited stars of all fucking time. He'd go across the street, does it gift shop, and they turned them into a cuckoo clock and a fucking coffee strainer and every fucking filter, every God damn fucking thing you can think of with Elvis on it. You know, this is an Elvis fan. There's nothing Elvis about that. Press the button. Ooh, Yay. Hi. Just start singing a song.

Speaker 1:          00:32:49       They paid little mutton chops on the fucking fan blades. So anyways, every once in a while you'd go and do an old house and you know what's up? My favorite thing that, see when you walk into an old house and you smell an old person, you know like, oh my God, this shit be going to see shit in here from the 1950s right. And you walk in there and you see like the old kitchen and the old bathrooms and all that, and you just see all the errors of styles that the house is fucking lived through. You know, that fucking lime green toilet seat cover or the plastic cracked fucking toilet seat itself. You know, where they made it, like that squishy shit that was supposed to be comfortable and then it cracked after a while and then they would just have wall to wall carpeting. And you just sit there looking at it. Good. Oh my God. The fucking health department. Like how many restaurants? I mean if you had that in any restaurant, like, like the 10, any restaurant within a fucking five mile vicinity would be fucking shut down to have carpeting in a fucking bathroom.

Speaker 1:          00:33:57       Absolutely disgusting. So anyways, um, so what I love about the downstairs now is it's fucking, it's level,

Speaker 1:          00:34:08       it's clean, everything works. It's just fucking awesome and it's right in time for the fucking holidays. And I'm, I'm thrilled. I'm thrilled with it. You know, it's funny, as the guy who sold me this house, he keeps calling me up every once in a while, right? In know they do the call you up like a fucking old girlfriend. They can just feel you're starting to love your house. So they got to put that doubt in your head day bill. Are you doing? Yeah. Tell you it's a great time, great time to get right back out there and fucking start all over again. You know, the great thing is when you invest so much in your house that you never going to make any money off of it. You don't give a fuck anymore. You're like, well, I'm never leaving. I'm gonna Redo this whole fucking thing.

Speaker 1:          00:34:52       Let me see if I can go broke on this fucking thing. So, um, anyways, you won't hear me bitching about it anymore. Um, it's done. And now that it's done, it looks fucking gorgeous and, uh, it was worth every, every cent of it. And your next question is going to be built and we see pictures of it and no you cannot. No you can't. What are you an asshole? Showing the pictures of the inside of my fucking house isn't enough that I'm in my house talking to you. Fucking creep. Um, anyways. Yay. Look who she just walked in all needy face. Why don't you grab a, grab a microphone, set up the old chord there. Um, see what I wanted to talk about. Anything here. Oh, by the way, as a new England Patriot Fan, I am so fucking jealous of the Seattle Seahawks defense man. They just look fucking great.

Speaker 1:          00:35:49       And I'll tell you right, I made fun of Pete Carroll for years and uh, I was never more raw. I mean, I, I never thought that he was a bad coach or anything like that, but that fucking guy is going to go. He already, he's, he's one of two people who ever won a Ncaa Division One championship in football and also on the Superbowl. The other guy was Barry Switzer, but you know, no disrespect to Barry, he's a great coach and all that type of shit. But he, he won with Jimmy Johnson's team. All right. Pete Carroll, you know, you know what happened? The NCAA was, the wolf was at the back door. He got the fuck out of there. And uh, he went up there. What was Seattle at that point? They were not thing. And uh, he's turned it around and he's right now. What's your watch you Pete Carroll Do, is one of the hardest fucking things you can ever do is to have a team that won the championship the year before, come out and, and somehow the next season motivate them where they're hungry, not they want to win it again.

Speaker 1:          00:36:52       They always want to win it again, but they, they have a hunger in them, it seems when you're watching, like they haven't won it yet. Like they still have something to prove. And earlier this season, I really look at Pete Carol and Bill Bella check this year, who was kind of the same thing where the first six, five, six games or whatever, they had to figure out what their team was because every year people leave, people come in, it's a little bit different. And I'm watching Pete Carroll do some bill Bellacheck shit where it's like he knows what he has, he knows how to work it now he knows it's thick though I don't know as much as my patriots or 11 and three. I feel like I still feel like the level of play in the NFC, uh, is, it's on, it's another level. Um, I would never bet against, uh, you know, Bella check and Brady if anybody could figure out how to fucking, I dunno.

Speaker 1:          00:37:48       Seattle looks like fucking world beaters man. So my money's on them at this point. They just look like they look fucking unstoppable and uh, their QB there, Wilson, that guy is, uh, is that even his fucking name? I was so god damn old. I can't remember names anymore. That fucking guy is the real deal. I, you know, and all you kids out there who are starting to say verse, he might've been right about Mark Sanchez. I cannot help you. I can't help you. Firs even texted me that don't I, you know I might've met rant about this guy. It's like Paul, you watched the, first of all, Paul Versey is not right. Whether the guy's great or whether he sticks Paul verse, he said after the first three games of a quarterback's career, guy's a star. Like based on what Paul, based on what? Sitting at home watching front of fucking TV, never talking to him.

Speaker 1:          00:38:37       Never seen him in the locker room get you. You threw a fucking Hail Mary. This is the deal was Sanchez. Okay. I think he's a good quarterback. I think he could win the Superbowl with them, but the defense has to be unfucking believable. We're talking some, I'm not saying he's a Trent Dilfer it, he's beyond that guy. Okay. But to sit there and act like this guy is like on a Brady level, a Peyton manning level like Tom Brady paint man and guys like that. And I even think there's Wilson guy like could could get to that level. Like those guys are so fucking good. Even if you suck, even if everybody around them suck, you know, as a wide receiver, if you come in there and you kind of stank and everyone around you stinks and all of a sudden you're the number one receiver because everybody's stinks.

Speaker 1:          00:39:19       You still know you're getting a thousand yards because Tom Brady or Peyton Manning's giving you the fucking ball. Sanchez is not at that level, all right? That guy, if he has a great team, he's great, and other words, he'll win the fucking game but won't fuck it up, all right? But when people start to leave and, and, and the talent level dips, it's but fumble time, okay. And I did not see that ever with somebody. You know the higher guys, the Damn Marino's, the fucking Peyton Manning's the Tom Brady's, okay? So enough with this shit, okay, stop watching fucking football week to week and going, this guy is this and now he's this, now he's dead. Go fuck yourselves. All of you guys, you guys can all go listen to the fucking fuzzy effect and fucking rob, do a circle jerk and pat yourselves on the back with your horrific predictions. I love you Paul. All right, Nia. Hi. Hey, what's going on? You're here just in time for the, um, for, for getting into the, uh, the questions. Perfect. I told him, boy, let me turn this up here. Uh, I told them how the downstairs is finally, right.

Speaker 4:          00:40:22       Uh, what do you mean? I mean, there's a couple of things. Yeah, I know. I told I'm not, I cannot muster this endless enthusiasm that you seem to have until it's done, until it's 100% fucking done. I know till every single little piece is, is done. And you know what? I went down there and there was a couple of fucking things. I'm like, that's the thing. That's why I don't keep going down there. So you keep going down there every day and I understand that it's important to check on it, but like, you're like Judah has zero, zero, zero was like every day. And it's like, I can't go downstairs every day because I will see a hundred things wrong with it and I'm just, I'm, I'm giving them time to do their thing, you know, I'm like, hey, we're done. Then I can look and be like, are you done? Are you really done? Hey, I'm Billy. Big Eyes, really big ass billboard bar. I still haven't seen your billboard in real life.

Speaker 1:          00:41:16       What do you want to see it? You know what I'm saying? Yay. Oh, don't be so modest. Well that's a well, yeah. What am I going to bring up a fucking billboard on my own fucking podcast. Well you didn't bring it up. I did. Hey, by the way, very proud of you. Thank you. I'm very proud of shut up.

Speaker 5:          00:41:32       Um, by the way, for you guys, like I somehow I just like, I sent a link. Do you really want to get people going send any sort of link about global warming? Like the people who were, I don't think it exists. Like they always say the same thing. They go like, oh, looks blue. Fuck a Polaroid. He always talking about the ice age is age of the ice caps. Well, you had the ice age and then it all melted, right? Right. Yeah, the dinosaurs and then what the fucking ice age came and they died. Whatever our, our fucking or hit whatever it fucking happen. Right? But while you sit there and look at it, somebody who's fucking got a lazy eye flow history, the fucking plans gone from periods warming up and cooling, right? You're talking to like a dentist, Jake, and he, and I'm arguing and I'm a comedian.

Speaker 5:          00:42:20       This is like, this is, this is okay. What they're talking about is the rate, the unprecedented rate of how fast it is heating up. All right, here's another thing I just saw is that, that's what the argument is. Not whether or not the planet heats up and cools down. Well, it's fucking history. It's the unprecedented rate that it is doing. Any, any, any, any alarming. Great. Um, I almost said get that word out and like, Hey, what are you talking about? Even nobody knows me. I'm trying to fill a fucking hour here. There's over 5 trillion pieces of fucking plastic estimated estimated over 5 trillion in the ocean. Okay. Yes. It's terrible. I know I'm not talking to you. I'm talking to a few people. Give me shit about it. I'll sit there and act and think that we don't have like an effect on this fucking planet. Like do you know those places in the United States where you just can't live there because of whatever we put in the ground, nuclear waste, whatever shit and it's just you can't fucking live there or you will die.

Speaker 5:          00:43:19       Nothing that is alive can live there. It's just dead zones. Name, name one other fucking animal. I mean Gypsy Moss, Caterpillar. This is the closest thing I can come from. What Gypsy moth caterpillars. Gypsy moth caterpillars. They come up and real thing. Yeah. They just want, want, want, want, want, want more. Come on up from the South Wall. Doesn't help me envision and the, and they would just sit there and they would eat up all the trees and stuff and people would have to put like a little piece of plastic around the tree guy. You are talking about five different things. What are you saying? You were saying that you, there are places that you can't live and then you said there's a Ma except for the math gypsy. Like they're the only ones that can survive in these areas. No, I'm saying name another animal. That fucking affects the planet the way we do at firstly. I, yeah, I don't, I don't know. I am not a, I'm a specialist in that area. Oh yeah. You're missing the whole point of this spot. You're missing will not speculate on it. You're missing the whole point of the podcast. The holes. What honey? The point is, you don't know what you're talking about, but to, you know, I mean me. Oh, I don't know what I'm talking about. I've seen when you come on the podcast, you don't know what you're talking about, but that by no means stops you from pontificating. True and throwing out

Speaker 1:          00:48:07       No, it's German. So the a and the m is the last name of two German dudes and the g is the hometown of the guy with the last name that begins with an a according to my two seconds of research. And it's the top of the line. Okay. Fucking like, they already have a sick ass German car and then it's like, you know, but if they take it to the chairman gas monkey garage and they kick it up a notch car called the MG as well. Yes, my dad had one of those. That's not, that's not the same company or same no factory or nobody ever, uh, mg, uh, was a, was English is what it was. And they, uh, these little two seater racecars yes, they were. And a lot of the American soldiers got exposed to European cars, uh, sports cars to cedars and that type of Shit.

Speaker 1:          00:48:52       Italian stuff in English, stuff in German. Shit when a, no offense to German people, German stuff when, uh, they were when they were fighting over fighting over in Europe. And um, so when they came back, those cars sold over here like a EMG, TD and the fucking triumphs and all that shit in the Italian stuff. Um, so anyways, these guys, I don't know if they just make the best fucking cars anyways. Hey Bill, just listen to your podcast. When you talked about how much you enjoyed your test drive of the AMG wagon, the station wagon, which you just, yeah, yeah. Now I know you love it, but I'm just, I had fucking bad ass. He goes, I'm totally with you on the sleeper wagons being bad ass. I just wanted to write you to see if you've looked into the CADILLAC CTS v Wagon at all.

Speaker 1:          00:49:40       In my opinion, it looks meaner than the Mercedes and would cost you tens of thousand less. Those Cadillacs are mean looking with that vertical break light that they have. They just look fucking angry. And I loved it. He loved Cadillacs and he always looked bad ass driving them. They're just bad ass cars. Yeah, I absolutely, uh, if I got a buddy of mine, uh, has one, it's just a fucking great car. Did Grandma I, you know, I realized I'm a sedan guy. I really am. I like, I'm Tom to social media. Look at me. I get that people in the backseat, if you're gonna have a fucking two door cards, don't, don't have a back seat. That's so dumb. Fucking staring at that station wagon. I mean, I'm not like [inaudible] wrong with station wagons, but they just, I don't know. They carry that thing about them that makes it just feel like, I don't know,

Speaker 5:          00:50:27       just like, not that there's anything wrong with having a family car, but like, they're just not sexy. That's what it is. A station wagon. It's not sexy. Whether it's a Mercedes or a Cadillac. I just, you know what it is. It's because you guys, all you guys know is nerd. If you had, as you guys, you and everybody else who trashes wagons, if he knew anybody who played in bands, guitar players, drummers, surfers, all these cool bad ass people drive fucking, yeah. Yeah, because they should away like I see a station wagon for a surfer. That makes sense. The shape or the boards and stuff. Do you plan on putting surfboards in a station wagon? I played drums. I say, and you can't put drums in any other kind of car, but a station wagon. Right? All those vans that van travel around them, they don't try to van the station wagon buddy.

Speaker 5:          00:51:16       All the baddest bands ever. Some old, not saying, they all said, look, anybody can take a yet. Like I just think to look at a fucking like a corvette or something like that. [inaudible] it just for that thing to go fast is designed to go fast. I just, I'm so sick of arguing with this point. When you look at a station wagon, everything that everybody thinks about a station wagon, that's what makes it cool. That's the thing. Then fucking blows you away off the fucking line. That's all I'm saying. That's all I'm saying. I'm done. I'm done talking about know Farron. Alright, fireman. Oh I asked for some firemen to a, to a right in, you know, but some shit that they found in a fire and they actually kept it. They're not going to tell you what they kept. The why. This is all anonymous.

Speaker 5:          00:52:00       How a big bed bill. My father was a fireman for over 20 years. One morning he came home and he handed me a rent and Stimpy shirt. Oh my God. That's funny cause he knew I liked, to me you eat it. It's debut 80th to be easy. It they don't deserve to live. I didn't put it together right away that he had taken it from a job he couldn't even buy as a kid. A simple ren and Stimpy sir, you had to steal it from afar. I'm sorry, I'm to steal when I was a lovely man. I'm so, I don't mean to diss your dad, but that's as funny of all things to give your kid a tee-shirt from a, and now I feel like he put his life on the line, not like a bike that was managed to be spared or something like that, but a teacher is kind of weak, you know, it smelled like fucking suit, probably at like little holes in it from ambers linen on it. A go kit. The loves you. He goes, I didn't put, I didn't put it together right away. He had taken it from a job. But when I did, I felt so horrible thinking that someone's entire life disappeared in a fire. And now I had one of their only surviving possessions.

Speaker 5:          00:53:11       I had thought of that shirt a long time until you brought that up on an unrelated note. Check out the book. Meat is for pussies by John Joseph. Uh, you always make comments that sound like you could be persuaded to try vegetarian. A lot of them.

Speaker 1:          00:53:26       Um, I would, if I could just get myself into like learning how to cook it and I just, I bought in like, you know how to cook it, you know how to cook every vegetable. You know how to Cook grinds, you know how to cook beans and rice and all that kind of stuff. You know how to do it. So you know, I'm a crabby old man. I mean I know what to do with the pork chop I don't have to do was fucking eggplant. Now there are certain foods you would like to cook more than others. Like you like to make braised short ribs. You like to make pie, you like to make pumpkin bread. So these are the things that you make. It's not like you can't cook. It was Anya. I think this book might help you take the, take the final step.

Speaker 1:          00:54:02       The author is a nut who has been singing for a great punk band for the last 30 years, but he's in killer shape and breaks it down and all sorts of conversation on all. I'm all over this conversational English. It's not boring. Hippy dippy, calm you a pamphlet. It shows all sorts of athletes and fighters who are shredded without using any animal products. I've been a vegetarian for 23 years, so it didn't convert me, but it served as a great source for rebuttals. When insecure meat eaters go after me for eating rabbit food and say other dumb things because my eating habits remind them of how shitty their diet is, it's worth checking out. Love the podcast. Keep up the great work. Go Fuck Yourself. Ps, stop cutting yourself off short. When you talk drums, music, I sit through hours of you talking sports, which I still find entertaining, but I don't give a shit about, but every time you get nerdy about drumming, which I love, you say, Oh, this is boring everyone and move on.

Speaker 1:          00:54:55       Please stop doing that. I would rather hear you spend a half hour talking about John Barnas, right foot. Then some jerk off, overpaid meatheads throwing our, oh my God. Amazing. I suspect that there are others who agree with me. That's a solid point. Yeah. Guys in station wagons drive into the fucking Gig who don't eat meat. No, I think vegetarianism is, is cool though. There's some really, I would be completely satisfied. You know what I love about f eight? A total vegetarian. Me, I don't choose to because I liked me, but I wouldn't be mad if that's, you know what's great about eating vegetarian healthy way of eating vegetarian is you don't get, you can eat, you know, get fat and then you don't have to worry. Oh good. And again, still working out like me right now. I got fucking, but there are some fat vegetarians though. Yeah. Those are the ones who don't read up on it. They just stop eating meat and they eat fucking chips, cookies and Pasta and bread. I'm a vegetarian. I can eat that. It's like, dude, which Chin just said that? So, um, no, I would like to do that. Like, I would like to try to, uh, just as you get older, it's harder and harder to fucking stay in shape. And I just don't want to look like a fucking, you know, you start getting that fucking torso that like the cops usually find floating in a lake. Oh my God. Oh, bloated. That's what that's been in a lake. Yeah. That's cause you know it was because she had the dead because you're dead in the bacteria, your gut.

Speaker 5:          00:56:24       Oh God. It's already there near the back. When you die someday the bacteria that's going to eat you up so more than it is in this. Fascinating. No, it isn't. And it sits in there your whole life. No, it's nature. It's what the fuck supposed to, it ranges the interests. What's supposed to happen here. Okay. The least fucking jerk off. She'll get buried and you get stuck. Don't blame them. They're dead. And, and they, they get buried. They get shoved in a drawer in the basement of a church. Those people, it's the biggest fucking waste of stupid. Your fertilizer does it put you in the ground and said, mom does Mazal I am the whole fucking thing to circle it. Just go, okay, you're alive. Why do they decided to put people in those instead of in the ground? Cause it's like a fancier, and you're better than the ground.

Speaker 5:          00:57:19       Yeah. You can't be, you can't be warm food. You have three like uh Nah man. There's some cool about just fucking, just being raw. Just rot away to gone dust. Boom over. Get out of here. Beat it. Yeah. It's fucking sitting there with your dumb headstone so people can come up to with Jack Daniels and fucking their arm around him. Man, he's not there. She's not there. They're fucking, they're there in the air. You can stay at home and do that. Just like crazy philosophical to the night. Philosophical is stupid. Both. I know one of the other, well, all right. I'm lying about medical school. I've been lying about medical school to my family and friends for the last two years. I'm now, he's 23 this is understandable. He was, wow. I'm guest teen and lying about, you know Jesus. All right. All right, fine. Fine.

Speaker 5:          00:58:21       Jesus. Jesus. Can you give the, can we get the kid a fun at 23 near like if you saw how fucking introverted I was at 23 you know why? Compared to the Gloria Social Butterfly that you are today, you are on fire person. I like who I like. Okay. I like, I don't like fuck. Yeah, I don't like those big parties. Got To stand there. The fucking eyebrows up. Is that what you tell it did rain yesterday. You're not good at small talk is what it is. Pointless. And then in little party conference you've got to come up with some sort of thing to just say and just when they look and you feel the same thing, just be like, dude, don't feel you don't have to talk to me. We don't have to do this. That sounds like a great way to make somebody feel comfortable.

Speaker 5:          00:59:15       No. If they know, you know what I mean? These fucking, we don't have to do this. We can just sit here and the quiet until our wives come over, drag us back into that and you just click your drinks. Definitely worked with me, man. That's so funny. I would love to, I used to do a bit of ice to talk about you on stage when you come off everything. Okay, I get it. I always ended up drifting into a corner at these parties. You're the social butterfly going around. Everybody fucking loves you. And I'd just be standing in the corner drinking a Miller and then you'd come over and just be like, [inaudible] okay, I just hear anything. I feel like you're avoiding the party. Like I am you. In the beginning when I was getting to know you and then I realized, you know what?

Speaker 5:          00:59:59       A wildly, you know, dazzling personality that you can be at social gatherings and I just let you do your own thing and then I do my thing. And then what happened? You always say that I abandoned you, I parties. No, that was early, early on. That was weird to me that I would just let you just say and you'd break off and I'd be like, what the, I'm mean, so someone beat on my hip and they would just be an egg. And it's also so first it weirded me out and then I, then I was like, wait a minute, this is perfect. Yeah, you go Ryan, you go round the room and be like, oh look, you do all, you find thinness. What is in it? Oh my God, it's a Dylan said I'm in the corner. Like, no, no, I'll set. You find them. One of the guy, the party that like spores and you guys ended up talking all night.

Speaker 5:          01:00:47       It's perfect. It really is perfect. It's the perfect. Usually I, you know, nobody's feelings get hurt and we have, we have very independent socialize. I think that's important. You know, I fucking, I go, I find the room. Nobody's in. I just stand there. I know you always want to sit down. Yes. What are we standing up for? But you know what? I don't like this. I don't like to stand either during part anyway. We'd have to get back to the question watching all the fucking couples competing with each other. Dumb Shit. Oh, do you see the fucking woman jealous of her bag and then you see how can it his eye and then he sit and they go out. God, now I get to buy a fucking bag. Got to buy a fucking bag. Cause Suzy q's got the fucking yellow one. Fucking hate her.

Speaker 5:          01:01:34       She's so, she's skinny, right? She's getting, you know, that's the nightmare chicken. Then you drive home. You got to convince, you got to convince the woman you're with that. You didn't want to fuck anybody there at the party. Oh yeah. She was too skinny for me. Yes. She should've put, she should have left something to the imagination. Thank God her tits were hanging out fucking [inaudible] and it was a great thing to look at. And while I was in the middle of that awful conversation, now there example of why having independence socialize is so great because I don't invite you to shit because I know that you're not going to be into it. So I don't even know if I asked. You did forever. I did. And then I sobbed and I was like, yeah, you want to go to blah blah. And I'd be like, no.

Speaker 5:          01:02:15       And then you would always go, I died a thousand deaths than I not. Can I take some, give me a fucking break. You've died a thousand deaths because I invited you to parties because I want to spend time with you. Oh, just hey you up on that cross. It's so hard. The things that you went to or what? The fact that they were called parties is an absolute insult around with you and all your bone head comedian friends while you insult each other for three hours. That's like supposed to be something amazing. Never called it a party.

Speaker 5:          01:02:52       Certainly not. It is not a point when they say were you and Joe de Rosa and Keith Robinson and we're going to have dinner and you're like, oh, you can come if you want. See you. And I said, who's going? It was going on, I don't know, smart, this beautiful fucking great steakhouse, hate this unbelievable food. And all we did was sit there and make fun of Keith's fucking sweater. And then the waitress came over and had the best insult because Keith was defended the sweater and then she comes over and we go, what do you, excuse me miss it. She already knew that were, we were a jerk offs and we just said, what do you think of when you look at Keith sweater? And she goes, Freddy Krueger. And it was, and it was, and it was such a Freddy Krueger, it was their Thanksgiving colored thick stripe fucking sweater.

Speaker 5:          01:03:39       I was great. And he had to just sit there and take it and that, that made my meal. And she said, do you want dessert? I said, no, you just gave it to me sweetheart. Sorry. Um, all right. So he says, I've been lying about my medical school and my family and friends for the last two years. I'm 23 I have aspired to be a doctor ever since moving to the United States when I was 10 I crushed it in high school without really studying. Graduated, graduated as, sorry. I already go to salutary and I fucked. Graduated as salutary. I don't even know what that means. Is that number one in the class to Jesus Christ? Valedictorian is number one. A salutorian is number two. What's, what's the bronze? I Dunno. I'm still just the class president or something. They didn't miss them that high academically, but socially they were popular enough to get [inaudible] president.

Speaker 5:          01:04:32       I was in the supplemental draft. All right. So I had an ego trip going into college and decided to push myself in order to get into the top tier medical schools by junior year. I was double majoring, working in a research lab and teaching. Uh, I say that word recitation. What the fuck is that? A recitation session of my own. Do you know what that is? So how do you know that's how you say it, but why don't you stand it out? I do. I have to like help you like a child in school learning was sound out rats, sealant, recitation or what else would it be? I don't know. I don't know what it is and either deal. How do you know it's not recite Taishan anyways, uh, on my own, on, uh, a recitation

Speaker 1:          01:05:18       session of my own on top of volunteering in the Er as an EMT during off hours, ah, I'm gonna say this dude burned himself up. To make a long story short, I over extended myself, Mike, but by graduation, my GPA, Sax Solo that no United States medical schools would ever consider my application. I was too ashamed to admit this to my family and friends who have always considered me as smart as the smart one of the bunch. For two years after graduation, I had been lying about working fulltime and applying to medical school, but rarely but barely missing the cut or at least sure. Oh, you've been lying that you have that. Oh, about working fulltime and applying to middle school. Oh, so that's what's really going on. You're working full time and you keep missing the cut. In reality, I am working. Oh, in reality. Oh that is what you're doing. I'm sorry. In Rio.

Speaker 4:          01:06:08       Oh my God. Hey,

Speaker 1:          01:06:11       that's the reason I'm a clown.

Speaker 4:          01:06:14       Oh, this is torture. How long it's taken you to get through this. In reality,

Speaker 1:          01:06:21       working parttime secretly taking classes to improve my GPA and I've never applied. This lie has gotten so elaborate that I have been making application size, credit card payments to a credit card. My parents don't know I own, so if they review my bank statements, it actually looks like I have been applying what? The burden of keeping the truth to my self and it's gotten so bad that I'm actually starting to feel a disconnect from my family and friends. First question, should I come clean or should I just keep up the lie until I get into medical schools? Second question, is it even worth pursuing this dream anymore? By the time I improved my GPA, I'll be 25 plus four years of medical school plus three years of residency. I'll be 32 by the time I have my first day of work. That's still pretty young.

Speaker 1:          01:07:09       Dude, I would love to take your advice to heart. I think you're far more insightful and to give us a no compliments here. All he came out of it, he goes, I think you're far more insightful than you give yourself credit for, but you're still a balding ginger. Go Fuck Yourself. God, I keep you honest. Still over there. All right, here's a good shit. Um hmm. I would definitely come clean because this is fucking eating away at you and your brain and it's making you live in a double life here. I would definitely do it. And you if, if it's still really is your dream, who gives a fuck? Gives a fuck. Who cares how long it takes. But something tells me that I didn't gradually, regularly regular college until 25. Yeah, that's true. Um, and it doesn't, I don't know. I get the feeling that he actually doesn't want to be a doctor anymore. What the hell? I didn't see that way. What'd you mean? I don't know. I'm in, what do you think? Um, cause I just,

Speaker 4:          01:08:00       I dunno, I just feel like he or she is. Um, probably he though I just feel like the way it's written as a guy, I have just feel like, yeah, maybe you got burned out and really you don't, maybe you don't want to do it anymore. Is there a possibility that there's other things that you to do? But either way, I know you shouldn't lie anymore because, and it's not so much about other people. It's like you were saying, it's about you. It's how it's eating you up inside and making you feel disconnected from your family and friends. That's not good. Like they, they love you. You're only thing it really comes down to they don't want you to be miserable. Hopefully

Speaker 1:          01:08:33       this guy's academically George Foreman, right before he fought up, fought Isley where he just never lost, never got knocked down. And then when Ali knocked him down, he said years later that he could've got back up, but he'd never been there before. And I think this dude was crushing it without fucking trying, cause he was so smart. And then it got a little hard and uh, he's dealing with, um, like, uh, dealing with a couple of losses. You got to turn it around and do it. It's not a, you're not even fucking at 23 years old, dude. That's way too young to pack in. You look at this way. This is how I always looked at it. All right. You're 23. All right. You're saying by the time you get through all this bullshit, you're going to be 32. What would you rather be at? 32 32, not a doctor or 32. Just became a doctor. If that's what you want to do. All right, because Sunday, dude, you're going to look at 32 years of age and be like, Jesus, I was a kid, I was a fucking kid. I still had it all ahead of me. And you do so stop being so hard on yourself. Come clean because it seems like it's your turn. You're turning yourself into a bit of a sociopath here.

Speaker 4:          01:09:48       Yeah. Cause the two years is a long time. And the fact that you're making these payments, you like the credit card and stuff. That's a little much. Yeah. So what are they doing? Like buying flat screen TVs to be like, oh that's for this. And then you get that. That's a little, that's taken it too far. I mean it takes the TV and throws it over the backyard. Yeah, there's really no need to get this for that. You let slip scale back before you do anything. And here's this thing. Crazy

Speaker 1:          01:10:15       set. As your parents get at some point, you guys are all gonna laugh at it. You're going to laugh at lift the shit that my parents laugh at, the stuff that I fucking did. You know, I got arrested for drinking and driving. I've never seen my mother have a more disappointed look on her face. She still rolls her eyes, but when I tell the story, she laughs now she left still get over it. All right. They'll get over it. Okay. But uh, you know, I just, she's still want to be a doctor dude. The fact that you'd be a doctor in 32 would be fucking amazing.

Speaker 4:          01:10:43       Yeah, of course. Being on becoming a doctor is fucking amazing. If you want to do it, if you want to do it. Oh my God, it is so hard. It's so hard. You guys know. What did he say? I'm working part time and I'm secretly do to improve and have never applied. Um Hm. Do you like working parttime though and what are you working at? Cause I, I feel like there's something else that he's interested in doing. Well. Okay. Maybe. Yeah. Like I know he wants, he says he wants to be a doctor and I don't doubt that, but I, but what if there's something else that might be even more interesting and I don't know, not make you turn into a person that has to make up a second life. I don't know. I don't know. The way I read it, I don't think he ever had to, I think you just put too much pressure on himself. Oh yeah, that's true. So I think his parents will be fine with it. And if they're not, then they're not your real parents. That's right or not. You're really, you know, they say if they don't agree then you're not your real friends, but you are. But your mental, like emotional wellbeing is way more important than a medical school, I feel like ultimately. Right.

Speaker 1:          01:11:57       Uh, I wasn't listening to you. I was already looking at the next question.

Speaker 4:          01:12:01       You know what? Before I came in here, I was reading about adult ADHD cause you know I like to read it every couple months and like make you take a quiz just to confirm the facts. Bring it in here. That's true are in fact, I'll take the quiz right now. Have Adult Adhd. Should I go get it?

Speaker 1:          01:12:15       Good. I'll take it and I'll answer the next one. I'm going to fucking destroy this test. You know she's out of the room. You know I'm going to destroy it. I'm just going to fucking lie. Never let the broad in your life psycho fucking analyze you. All right? Whether you wanted or not, they're already gonna be running around in your head. You don't need to fucking open the door. You know what I'm saying? When you get in a relationship with a woman, remember that star Trek one where they fucking tied those guys hands behind their back and they stuck that warm and they're fucking helmets and then put it on. They went in their ear. That's what I'm talking about it all right. Skating rink. Dear Billy Bruins, you've been talking a lot about your home renovation, but we never heard much about the Yad, which leads me, uh, leads to my suggestion of installing some ice in your backyard.

Speaker 1:          01:13:01       Dude, I live in Los Angeles. Surprise to me how few people have these things going on regardless of whether or not you could actually do it. Is that something you would want to have two out of the four seasons of the year? Ps, maintain the ice would be the hardest part. Oh Dude. Are you kidding me? I would love to have a rank of my backyard, although would I want to go through living in a place where I have to go through winters? I did that for 40 years. I did my time. I bought enough ice scrapers in my life. Uh, I love the winter. I like to visit it at this point. And, um, you know, and all you guys who say I'm a pussy now, eve, show me how it's done by standing back there in the fucking goddamn winter. Um, anyways. All right, that's the podcast for this week.
