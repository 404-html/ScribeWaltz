Speaker 1:          00:00:01       Hey, what's going on is bill burr and it's the Monday morning podcast for Monday, January 7th, 2013 the first Monday. Have a wonderful new year. We're in our, we're in our teens. Everybody in this century. Has Anybody said basically what the uh, this decade is called, by the way, is this the teens? I guess you can officially say that, right? I mean they say that about the 19 hundreds, right? They say that. Well, it was the roaring twenties. They always blow off the first tooth, the arts,

Speaker 1:          00:00:33       the teams, the 30s to forties out of fucking though. Anyways, yeah, I can believe this shit. I'm sitting here, right? Wake up. I don't have anything to talk about today. Um, so I was like, I know, I know what I'll do. I'll go check out the fucking egg heads over@ted.com. See what the fuck they are up to and what do I see? This is why we're going to be extinct quicker than global warming or click quicker than anything else you could ever come up with. One of the things right on the front page is this guy, Hayden Perry, and you know what he's talking about everybody, he's talking about reengineering mosquitoes to fight disease. How can these people be so smart and so fucking stupid all at the same time? Did you really think that you're just going to reengineer like I don't know what they're going to do. Like take the old engine out and put something better in there that works for us. The guy starts it off, of course is always with, you know, something really ominous. He's like, and forgive my awful whatever, British accent here, but he comes out and he's just like, today we're going to talk about,

Speaker 2:          00:01:43       okay,

Speaker 1:          00:01:44       the most dangerous animal on the planet for humans. Now most of you probably think that that's Togare. Maybe it's a lie, and I'm actually talking about the mosquito. The mosquito has killed more people than plagues war aids and he goes on this whole fucking thing. Okay? And he's going on and on about how mosquitoes have killed a bunch of fucking people, you know, throughout the course of history, which if you fucking think about it is it's really not that mind blowing. You know, plagues come and go, wars begin and end, but mosquitoes, they never quit every fucking day. Their bite and people, you know what I mean? They liked that dude that always goes to the gym. He doesn't take six months off and eating fucking moon pies and then come back with this big doughy stomach like me, the fucking mosquito.

Speaker 2:          00:02:44       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:02:44       Is relentless. All right? So then he's just sitting there going, now you know, the mosquito, it only travels only 200 yards and its entire fucking life and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. But basically it lays eggs and shit, you know, water and that type of crap. And then, you know, we're assholes. We go all over the fucking world and we've got the eggs with us and exceed all the mosquitoes are all over the fucking planet as they should be biting people, killing people, giving us some fucking elbow room. This fucking jackass in his fucking egg head friends. Once a re-engineer, one of the few things that is keeping the human population just vaguely in check, which it isn't. We're up to 7 billion people in this fucking asshole wants to reengineer mosquitoes to fight disease rather than to spread it. Do you understand how fucked up this guy is? Like it's like a form of terrorism. I don't know. I know you guys sick. I'm a moron, but like there's a reason why mosquitoes kill people. You know there's a reason. There's a reason. Everything kind of kills everybody into it. He keeps it balanced. This fucking jerk off. Do you really think you just going to rewire these fucking mosquitoes and then that's going to, that's not going to have a domino effect thing.

Speaker 2:          00:04:06       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:04:07       You know what it's like. Listen to these fucking guys. It's like listening to some weekend warrior who decides he's going to rewire his house and you know, within three years he's going to fucking burn it down because he doesn't have, he's, he's not a licensed electrician. That's what these guys are. Okay. This is so fucking smart. They're going to reengineer a mosquito, but like how, how's that going to affect the fucking God give me up. Giving me an animal, a bird. I don't fucking, it's going to affect something. I'm so in over my head over this, but I know I'm right. I know I'm right. You can't just, you can't just, if you fucking re-engineer that thing

Speaker 1:          00:04:45       to help us, okay. It won't, not now it can't kill us. Let's talk about this. This uh, the fuck did he call it Dang gay disease [inaudible] disease or some shit that evidently is killing a bunch of people. First Time you get it, you feel like you have a fever and you could actually have the feeling like your bones are going to break the ECC, call it breakbone fever and a, you develop like antibodies, but there's three strains and then when you get the next one, I mean it just, it's, it's like a horror movie, but a necessary one.

Speaker 2:          00:05:16       You know,

Speaker 1:          00:05:19       these fucking nerds every think that there's a reason that mosquitoes kill people. That's what I, I love about nature is it all makes sense. You know, if you just remove your emotions from it and you just look at the whole thing is like, uh, I dunno like a math problem. No, G Asia, right? Where where we have you got way too much. It's like you'd be open the cupboard, you know what I mean? You'd get half like fucking like one fig Newton and then 7 billion pounds of flour.

Speaker 1:          00:05:58       I think that they should not, not re-engineered. They just let the fucking mosquitoes kill people. And if you get killed, I'm sorry, you know, but you're dead. It's over. You're out of the way. And we continue on and his apples for everybody, you know, we're already growing salmon and dishes. Manmade fucking salmon were literally fucking with the food supply, another form of terrorism. So he just comes in and poisons the food supply. You know, if you have like a fucking mask on, you know, in some sort of a bath towel on you, on your head or whatever, then it's all, yeah, it's a terrorist, that's a terrorist. But if you've got a fucking lab coat on,

Speaker 2:          00:06:38       okay?

Speaker 3:          00:06:39       You know, you putting all these pesticides in there and that type item. Fuck it. I'm on, I'm on. I'm on my soapbox is sweet people.

Speaker 2:          00:06:44       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:06:45       Standing up on that box. Letting everybody here. My ignorance.

Speaker 3:          00:06:52       Hayden Perry, if for some reason, I don't know why you felt like being dumb this week and you're listening to this podcast, can you please not [inaudible] can you and your friends please not reengineer mosquitoes? Can you just let them do their fucking yeah

Speaker 4:          00:07:06       job yet. Oh,

Speaker 3:          00:07:09       why don't you do the world a favor and stick your head in a mosquito nests. Why don't you fucking do that? This is like mad scientist shit. ted.com is the scariest fucking website out there. These fucking assholes, you know, on the reengineering mosquitoes and they're building robots that know everything that can run like Barry Sanders, you know, and like, like that's not going to be a bad thing. Hayden Perry.

Speaker 2:          00:07:35       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:07:36       You know what is his heart is in the right place. He sees death, he sees suffering, he sees pain and he wants to fucking stop it.

Speaker 4:          00:07:47       All right?

Speaker 1:          00:07:49       Because what he's doing is he's chasing the myth of a utopia. The myth of Utopia is that if you lived in a utopia, everybody would be happy all the time and nothing bad would ever happen. And that's just not the case because of the emotion of boredom. If everything was awesome all the fucking time, you would go out of your fucking mind because every day would be the exact same. It would just be awesome. Hey, it's lunch time. You have a Turkey sandwich. Isn't this the greatest Dirk? He said, yeah, it's every day. It's the greatest fucking sandwich ever. Every fucking day. Exhausted with happiness. It would be exhausting. You know what I mean? You gotta have people getting bit by mosquitoes dying. If that doesn't happen, you can't enjoy the Superbowl at the same level. You know what I mean? You can't enjoy just sitting there having a Turkey sandwich cause you can't, you don't have the thing to be like, well at least you know I a Turkey Sandwich, the meat's a little dry. But Hey, at least I didn't get beat bit by fucking mosquito and die, you know, laid face down in a puddle. Eggs.

Speaker 4:          00:09:04       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:09:04       Do you eliminate all of that? I mean, I don't, well, what did what he's supposed to fucking do.

Speaker 4:          00:09:09       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:09:09       There's all these, these, all these, there's all these myths that if we just did this, people would get along. If we just did that, people get along. I don't think we would.

Speaker 4:          00:09:18       I think boredom.

Speaker 1:          00:09:22       Boredom is at the basis of, of, I don't know that that's what drives us. I Dunno. We just want to do something else. Can Be in competitive and all it is. You wouldn't get rid of that. Just imagine that if you lived in a fucking utopia, everybody had the best car. Everybody drives a fucking Bentley. Everybody's got the greatest fucking stereo. Everybody's got up Victoria secret fucking model. Everybody's got, you know, I don't an infinity pool. Everybody's got it. Okay. Now that if he could just snap your fingers and make that happen, that would be probably the most insane five days straight party the world has ever seen.

Speaker 4:          00:10:07       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:10:08       But after five fucking days you, you'd get, you'd get sick of it.

Speaker 4:          00:10:12       I think you would.

Speaker 1:          00:10:14       Nobody ever stubs their toe. There'll be ever falls down. You just, you know,

Speaker 4:          00:10:21       I don't know.

Speaker 1:          00:10:22       Re-Engineering fucker mosquitoes.

Speaker 4:          00:10:25       Okay.

Speaker 3:          00:10:25       Do you know I saw a transvestite do a fucking face plant this week and it coming out of a doughnut shop. First of all, in La there's doughnut shops. I swear to God, there's like 19 chains of, of, of doughnut shops out here. They're on like every other block. I don't get it. Everybody out here that I know is in this business and you're trying to stay remotely and shaped so you, you limit your fucking Twitter bashing. Although the, the level that you get bashed on Twitter.

Speaker 1:          00:11:00       I Dunno who's eaten all the fucking donors who, um, but they were everywhere.

Speaker 4:          00:11:08       So

Speaker 1:          00:11:10       I'm fucking cutting down. Uh, oh man. I was on, I was on Fountain Nav. I really shouldn't give the straight up, but fountain have is, is the one for you tourists out here when you want to go east to west or west to east and it's during rush hour. Don't take, don't take fucking sunset. Don't take Santa Monica. Take Fountain. It's right in the middle, but I'm one of those strips there. There's this place, uh, yum, yum donuts I believe is what it's called. Or is that Santa Maria? I can't remember.

Speaker 4:          00:11:39       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:11:39       So anyways, so fucking doughnut shop and they got this stupid little like,

Speaker 4:          00:11:43       okay,

Speaker 1:          00:11:43       you don't like those j you don't like to put like Paul's down. And then they tie a chain to it, those little things and kind of droops down and goes over to this fucking dude woman. Right. Was stepping over it and it had a thing of donuts and just fell down on the ground. Now normally I would laugh. The guy in a dress fell face first with a fucking handful of donuts. I mean, that's pretty much you're going right down the checklist of a home run when it comes to comedy. But the dude fell, so a femininely, I felt bad. The gentleman in me was like, oh, that lady guy, the lady just fell. And the way the dude put his hand up, it was just, it ended up just being really sad. You know, but I, I pride myself. I'll pat myself on the back here, me and my ego that I resisted the urge of taking out my phone, phone and filming it.

Speaker 1:          00:12:37       You know, I don't, I don't like that shit. Now, how every fucking moment becomes this. Uh, I don't know what to call it. I don't like how a humiliation never ends. Now, you know, these poor kids coming up, it's just like somebody gets kicked in the balls that get shot with a fucking BB gun in his dick. Somebody films it. O m g epic failed Dick BB fucking video and then it's just on the internet forever. And the guy's 35 years old. He's got a drinking problem and he's looking at this girl. He feels sparks for the first time in years. He goes to talk to her and right as things that go and good, somebody yells at, hey, did that fucking epic fail Dick BB Guy? Yay.

Speaker 3:          00:13:19       He's like, oh my God. Is that you? I remember that.

Speaker 2:          00:13:23       Okay.

Speaker 3:          00:13:24       Then a chunk of your helmet get taken off. What the fuck? Right?

Speaker 1:          00:13:28       It just never know. Humiliation, humiliation never ends. Never fucking has, I don't even know what I'm talking about this week.

Speaker 2:          00:13:34       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:13:35       Does it matter? I don't think it matters this week. Cause Hayden Perry is going to reinjure mosquitoes to fight disease. Okay? You're going to rewire them and you're going to rewire everything else on the fucking planet. So it's all compatible. Are you just going to fuck with that Hayden?

Speaker 2:          00:13:52       [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          00:13:53       I don't get it. You know what it is? This guy, I don't even think he fucking believes in it. He is, he, I bet corporate owned, he's corporate owned. This is what they're gonna do. They're gonna own the re-engineered mosquitoes. Okay. And then when they bite you, they make you stronger. And uh, then they also, they go out and they choke out all the other bits. Mosquitoes. But you can only get them from them. And then what they do on the backside is they make the regular ones that aren't re-engineered. They re-injured near them to make them even more lethal. Alright? Cause that way either the way mosquitoes reproduce, it's just like this Endress and everybody's going to want to buy your mosquitoes. You know, and I'll be this endless supply and an endless demand for the supply that you could just fucking there. They're like rabbits,

Speaker 2:          00:14:42       right?

Speaker 1:          00:14:44       It's a salt. Makes sense to me. The fuck my 15 minutes and Jesus is getting deep this week.

So last night I'm doing this standup show. I'm doing a show where I stand up and um, you know, I'm trying to find a parking spot

Speaker 1:          00:16:47       and I do, I'm going to take to through every like minute fucking painful detail of this. You know, I put it in reverse. I look in the camera and I realize I'm a little bit in the red, so I pull it up a little bit, but then there's a Mustang in front of me and old one looks like a 67 or 68. And I'm like, wow, I want this guy to feel like I don't respect his car. So I backed up a little bit more realizing that I'm mostly in the unpainted area, so I guess legally I'm okay.

Speaker 1:          00:17:13       So then I decided to get out the driver's side door. Okay. I lead with my left leg rather than swinging my right over. I'm sorry. I get out of the fucking car and I'm walking up the street. You don't trying to think what I'm going to talk about when I go on stage and I look over and there's this fucking rabbit sitting outside this apartment, a rabbit. And this isn't a wild rabbit. This is a domesticated rabbit. What do I know? Because it's not afraid of me. It's just sitting there looking at me like, you know, hey, what's going on? Like it's just chilling on the porch and it's fat to fat fucking rabbit. Like, you know, it's eating human food rather than, uh, the held rabbits eat. What are these eight carrots? Least the cartoon wants to do the carrots, carrots in the wild lettuce grass. I don't know what the fuck they eat. Squirrels. I bet they'll find that out one day that they actually, every once in a while eat squirrels. Like, you know, for the longest time when they thought like chimpanzees were vegetarians and then they found out that every once in a while they go on a hunt and they kill a monkey

Speaker 1:          00:18:23       fucking chimpanzees. I hate him. I hate those motherfuckers. Okay, fuck mosquitoes or you bite me and I get a fever and I get a rash and I feel like my bones are going to break. And then I, you know, I'm hot, I'm cold, I'm hot, I'm dead. It's over. All right. I would much rather have that than to have some fucking roided out. Fireplug jump on me. Rip My face off, pulled my nuts off and twist my foot off. I would much rather, even though I'm going to bleed out quicker, they're going through the hell of the Denki death. Whatever the fuck it is. I would rather go through that. Oh my God. Those fucking creepy long chimp fingers.

Speaker 2:          00:19:02       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:19:02       You know, fucking grab and right under your chin, like you're some mass wrestler and he's going to reveal your identity. Just fucking rip shit. God damn face back. Oh my God. Oh Shit. I forgot this. I forgot this. I got to look this up right now. You know what? I was in New Mexico recently, um, visiting a high school friend and uh, hang on a second. The fuck was her name and I was in this,

Speaker 2:          00:19:40       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:19:40       This restaurant.

Speaker 2:          00:19:42       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:19:43       What is it? Bronco boozer. I can't remember a fucking name. God dammit. Bill, you stank. I'm in this Italian restaurant, right? And they've got all these fucking, uh, there it is. Gina Bronco Boozer. So they've got all these Italians on the wall, like the old ones. You've always heard Frank Sinatra and all the old Tito point day, you know, all the big Italian Theda plant. He's Latino. I don't give a fuck. Um, all the classic ones you've heard of. Um, it was a girl there was staring at the other girl. She was trying to be the hot whore and then the other girls whore tits were hanging out even more. And she's giving them a Seigel Sophia Loren.

Speaker 2:          00:20:26       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:20:26       So feel a rant, you know, all these Italians, right. Beautiful people. Right. And then they just had some, uh, uh, obscure ones.

Speaker 2:          00:20:35       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:20:36       So I see one, and it's, it's this woman in tight inner her knee, her name is Gina Bronco, a boozer. And I start reading the story and basically she was a female wrestler, hugely fucking popular. And uh, her big thing was how she got into wrestling. She was like five foot five, like 210 pounds. Okay, we're talking fourth and goal here. Low Center of gravity. She puts that show Ironhead Heyward with the pussy. Okay. It's disgusting, but it's true. So anyways, her big claim to fame was that she choked a fucking cow to death with the thighs. Now to me that just sounds like some Vaudeville likes step right up. Step right up. So you know what, back to jump that, that with the ties and you've got to buy. But one minute we will give you this Advil or whatever the fuck you one back then. Um, but anyways, that was her claim to fame to get into, uh, into wrestling.

Speaker 1:          00:21:41       So she went around barnstorming around the country and she won all these matches. If she became hugely popular, big time fan favorite, and she would do all these benefits for charity and whatnot. So one day, this is how little we knew about animals back then, they decide to raise money for charity that they would have Gino Bronco Booza wrestle in, old baboons from the zoo to old toothless backbone. If this didn't have its teeth. And if you haven't seen anything on baboons, like baboons, have teeth like a fucking lion. There were ever one Jaan. You can just stop staring at their rainbow book club ass and just look at it. It's fucking teeth. I mean, this thing could literally bite your fucking head off, but the Babel was old and it didn't have any teeth. What could go wrong? So they bring the fucking baboons down. I don't know if that had little silk wardrobe or we're in a robe like fucking Greg the Hammer Valentine.

Speaker 1:          00:22:46       Who knows? I don't know what had happened. Maybe it had his monkey hair all fucking slicked back and died. Platinum. I Dunno what, what? It's gonna but gene is going to wrestle this sinks. A gene is already in the fucking ring. This whole stories is on the wall at the restaurant. I can't believe I didn't take a picture of it because it's really very little about this on the Internet. So she's fucking waiting. They'd take a banana. They put her on the stool in the rink. Okay. Now the month, the baboons, old toothless baboons in the ring with this gene of Bronco Boozer Bouz A, if you're trying to look it up and I don't know what happened. She starts, I don't know, made some sort of aggressive move towards the fucking baboons. The baboons jumps on her and just snaps her neck and she's dead within the first fucking five seconds of the match. And the promoter was like, Oh hey god, he freak it out saying something ridiculous like, um, basically how would I know that that would have happened? How would you know that that would have happened? Well, well, baboons have the strength of like, what five men, you know, and I don't know if you've noticed baboons don't really like, you know, you don't ring a bell and then they stop. That's the end of the round. Bafo you know, they, if you start tapping out like, oh yeah,

Speaker 4:          00:24:03       all right.

Speaker 1:          00:24:06       You know, cause it's turning your head around. Huh?

Speaker 1:          00:24:10       You know, it does not stop it. You can't tap out with the baboons. Baboons do not have a fucking where that 10 minute time limit dose. They don't fight like that. They have a fight to the death. All right? You're coming in there trying to raise money for emphysema. That things coming in. They're like, all right, fucking blood sport here. I don't have any teeth. What's the next thing I'm doing? I'm going to fucking turn your head around like the extra seats, even though I never saw the movie. And even if I did, I don't even know if it would register, you know?

Speaker 2:          00:24:40       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:24:41       Do Bet Cheetahs are afraid or afraid of baboons. The baboons comes over like, get the fuck out of my territory. Cheetahs for the most part I like, or leopards, maybe it's even a leopard and even bigger cat. I Dunno what I dunno, but um, I will tell you to look up the story of Gina Bronco Boozer, but there's really nothing on here other than in that restaurant. And they kind of had the whole fucking story. If I ever go out to New Mexico again, I'm going to go to, it's an Italian restaurant or is if somebody lives out there, Jesus Christ, why don't you use technology? Please take a picture of the story. It's on the wall and please send it to me and we'll put it up on the podcast page because it's fucking unreal. You know what's funny? It was one, I read it. All I thought about was this is like, this is something like fucking Joe Rogan. You know, I should have sent the story to him. He could have done a fucking hour of this on, on his podcast with all his knowledge of animals and ultimate fighting. Who the fuck we're getting to a goddamn rig. Who the fuck would get into a ring with a, with a baboons and like, I guess, you know, they're really, there was no discovery channel.

Speaker 2:          00:25:54       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:25:54       And that's the honest thing. Like I wouldn't know anything about, I would know anything about baboons if it wasn't for basic cable, you know? And I wouldn't have known that that woman got her face fucking ripped off if it wasn't for, you know, the instant new shit. I wouldn't know anything. All I would know about would be the guy up the street with fucking seven toes. I would just know that country shit. But anyways, if you get a chance, you know, look it up, there isn't much information on it. But um,

Speaker 1:          00:26:23       so there you go. It's been all about animals so far hasn't it? The animal podcasts. Oh. Anyway, so I'm sitting there looking at this fat fucking rabbit and it's just sitting there and it was nighttime. I, it really disturbed me the way it was just sitting there, not looking out for coyotes, not looking out for a cath. I actually played out in my head this awful scenario of a cat slowly coming up to it's stocking it. You know, when the rabbit looking right at the cat and the cat having this weird sort of, this motherfucker sees me, doesn't he? You know, the lovely Nia, everybody. So I'm telling this story. I saw this rabbit sitting outside a house last night or house rabbit of fat. I've been eating fruit loops at the dining room table, house wrap. And it just really disturbed me because it didn't know any better.

Speaker 1:          00:27:15       It didn't know to be scared. It wasn't scared of me. It wasn't looking to Reno fucking yes, that's what I'm saying. It's domestic. And what'd you come down here to get on the podcast? Maybe, but grab yourself a microphone there, lady. You got to plug yourself in. So anyways, I uh, the chords are over there. We've been through this. I'd hit pause in this thing, but I don't know how to do it. And it always ends up shutting off and then I have to splice it together and then something happens where, uh, I dunno. So anyways, hey, you guys, have you ever, uh, you ever go to make a pot roast in a Dutch oven and in the middle of it you just start drinking beers and you're about four beers in and you can't remember what time you put the pot roast dinner. That's what the fuck I did yesterday. So embarrassed I made it. I made a tough pot roast. Here we go, and she's putting on the windscreen. Everybody a head. Bam. She's in. She's in. Hello. Hey. Did you try any of the pot roast or are you still on your diet?

Speaker 5:          00:28:18       I did try some pot rose, but I am still on my diet even though Paul Ross wasn't a fall off a little bit and back on it for the next, well for a while, but yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:28:27       in the middle of the pot roast, it tasted our right. Right. The outside got a little tough.

Speaker 5:          00:28:32       Yeah. Well that's what you get for and you know, I don't understand why people want people cook these beautiful meals that you've been cooking lately and they have been beautiful meals. My Ngo, you know? Yeah. You have a nice glass of wine. It's like the whole process. Nobody's slams for Budweiser's in a row while making these beautiful restaurant quality meals. That's a whole, yeah. You know what? It was stumbling around the kitchen like, Ooh, done. Do they put it in? Oh, I fucked it up. Oh, it turned the wrong burner. I did that. I was supposed to

Speaker 1:          00:29:05       turn up the heat for the potatoes and I had the, uh, the roast on simmer and I turned up the, the roast one high. And I'm sitting there like, why isn't this these fucking potatoes? It's doesn't even look like it's getting hot. And then all of a sudden I heard my, uh, my au jus sauce.

Speaker 5:          00:29:20       Huge bubbling over there. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:29:25       The whole thing. Well, you know what, it was my OCD kicked in. I had all those Budweiser's leftover from the Rose Bowl and uh, I, they're just taking up space.

Speaker 5:          00:29:34       You don't have OCD, you have add. I like that. You're like, oh, I have OCD. Why I had to drink all

Speaker 1:          00:29:42       those beans. Well, let me explain it. A compulsive, this is why a sense of in Santa Barbara sets of compulsive drinking. Now listen stands for a disorder. Let's, hey,

Speaker 5:          00:29:54       whoa.

Speaker 1:          00:29:55       No, I, I had the, uh, I just, we had like fucking 12. We brought so much beer. I had like 15 Budweiser's in there. Okay. It's taken up all that space. So I'm thinking if I drink one a day, you know, I'll knock this out in half a month. Then I go, what if I have to? I knock it out [inaudible] seven and then I was just like, you know, I had them in stacks or two and I was just like, you know, I knocked out two and then I had my third one and I'm like, well the other one's still sitting there taking up that space. So knock that one out. You could have put them on the bottom shelf. Like way in the back though. There's, there's ways you could have, I could've, I could've bought a bigger fridge. We could've bought a bigger fridge. Rosebowl was awesome to share.

Speaker 1:          00:30:35       We did have a tragedy though, and I can't name the name, but somebody got a little too drunk, was walking towards the street. I don't have, what always happens every year is we get absolutely fucking hammered. And then we all just, all of a sudden we just notice where the only ones in the parking lot, and then that's when it clicks that the game's about ready to start. So then we, or the golf course, which is the parking lot, and we, um, we just walk into the stadium sort of together and then get separated and then come back together again, like a band that worked out its differences, you know? And when we got to our seats, only three of us made it and there was some other guy, no, I remember what's his face was saying, yes, someone's so lost his ticket. I like get the fuck Outta here. And they didn't get in. And then some other Douche bag comes up and sits in my buddy seat where like three drunk Agri guys. What the fuck do you get that Dick? And he's like, oh, I bought it.

Speaker 5:          00:31:30       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:31:32       But at first he said he bought it for 25 bucks. Then they told somebody else he bought it for 50. Either pickpocket that thing or he founded on the fucking ground. But at the end of the day it's um, you know, it's all my buddy got too hammered. That's why I always buy the ticket holder every year. It's like, you know when you put a toddler on a leash, so can't run away from you. That's, that's what I do. I put the ticket in there, put it around my neck, and then I commence drinking like I'm still in college so it just stays there. Stays there. You don't have a problem. Feel your neck. Get and tugged, you know somebody trying to steal it. Right. You know, you can even put it like underneath your shirt if you're worried about people you know, getting funny ideas. Yeah, but I'd get so drunk I would think I lost it. I'd be like, where is it?

Speaker 5:          00:32:14       I can't breathe.

Speaker 1:          00:32:18       It's the way we know. We had a great time though. You were getting jealous when you saw all that food that we were cooking. Fucking lie ahead. Did the, did the ribs up throw down like it's, it's some sort of like food tailgating, competition, you know, it's like this. Did you tell them, did you tell your podcast listeners what was on the menu? This extensive tailgating menu? Oh, we had a short ribs. Wait, wait, start at the beginning. What is the beginning? Right? 9,000 fucking Budweiser's. Oh, we had breakfast with a lamb sausage. We got this great what Ya and my neighborhood. So we went over there and literally put in an order that we had to pick up two days later. A lot of animals died on this day. People, we had lamb. You are very organized about it. It's not like you just went to Ralph's and just grabbed a bunch of sheep meat.

Speaker 1:          00:33:03       Like you went to the butcher, the basket. Pretty much the only butcher and our neighborhood and put an order as he had lamb sausage, goat cheese and rose fat bar. Yeah. Um, all right. So that was breakfast. Okay. And that's the greatest Omelet I have every year. Yeah. Sitting there, I got a rose bowl ticket around my neck and on my beer in my hand. Exactly. An omelet in my mouth. I know all that guy shit that it's just lampooned now it gets just fucking considered silly. If you enjoy that, like this is America. It is. It's fucking great. And until you've had a fucking omelet on New Year's Day on a golf course outside the Rosebowl go fuck yourself. It was a tremendous, and then what's his face? We had a, we had Coby beef, hot dogs. What's, I just found out Coby beef. The reason why it's so soft as they treat it like veal. So I've gotta be done with that shit now. Oh, so now you're not gonna, you're not going eat that anymore cause you're very, you're anti veal. So yeah, I don't mind fucking just walking up to a cow and blown his brains out. That's, I don't, that's part of nature. Somebody got ya.

Speaker 1:          00:34:16       That's all right. But to stick him in a fucking cage and so they can't move. So the meats more tender to just torture it like that, you know? Okay. Yeah. I mean that's, it's, it's, it's unnecessary. It already tastes delicious. It's doing the fucking job. It's filling up my belly, you know, let it walk around. Can you let her walk around? Um, whatever. And then we had the ribs, we had the ribs and a, with his fucking, his, his rub in the mop. And it was just, it was the shit. And then what had the mini apple pies baked by you and then they my little pie face and then uh, we got the best compliment. We heard people next to us were sprint. Go and see, look at it. They're doing it right. They got pies. And you're like, that's right motherfucker. I know who brings individual Pi.

Speaker 1:          00:35:11       We used to read that whole game. I used to back in the day when I used to go to the Patriots Games, when I had season tickets in 1989, we used to fucking show up with a keg of beer and a bag of chips and we'd be sitting there. I don't know those people that are doing it right and we just get absolutely annihilate every year that I swear to God that's, that's, that's accurate. We would, we would have a half barrel. We had a half barrel beer and we would be doing keg stands because we were morons. Literally like counting, why do I ain't doing that shit? Is All these adults were looking at us like summer were repulsed. And then there was other people who did that when they were our age. So they would just sitting there with half a smirk, probably betting which one of us was going to puke first.

Speaker 1:          00:35:52       Yeah, I did one time puking after a keg. Stan is the most refreshing way ever to puke. I've never done it. Kegs stand before. It's so it's so cold when it comes back out. Usually when you heal. Well I guess a keg stand usually is you're supposed to do like somebody holds you up upside down drinking. Okay. And what, so we weren't doing that. We weren't doing that. What's the point of being upside down is that you get more fucked up that way? Cause they're all disoriented. No, it's one of those things where you're young and you think, if I'm drinking beer, I'm crazy. I'm away from my parents. What could make this crazier? What if I did it upside down? Yeah, it's stupid. It's just suburban. Do Sheree. So I actually, I actually never did that. Uh, we, we did a more adult version of cake cake Stan, which is basically you just fucking, you turn the tap on and you just, and we were timing it.

Speaker 1:          00:36:44       It was like the Olympic trials of beer drinking and, and as you puked you are out or if he just tapped out like I can't do it, seed start off with 10 seconds and it was completely inaccurate. If you would just be going one, two, three, four, five right all the way up to 10 and if you made it to 10 you in the next round and then went up to 20 then it went up to 30 then we're up to 40 and you've got to think, you've already drank for 10 seconds. St Drank for 20, that's 30 seconds. Now you drink for 39 he drinks 60 and it just keeps going and going and going. And we got all the way up. One time where I was trying to beat this guy and I, and I didn't have a reputation for being able to drink and I just went into this fucking zone and I went head to head with this guy and I just kept making, it was like the Cinderella team going through March madness and somehow I made it, I made it to the championship game.

Speaker 1:          00:37:32       It was me against this other guy who had like a fucking iron stomach. And um, I ended up, I ended up losing is what I did, but it was one of the great pukes in my life because it was just ice cold. It was like reverse drinking a glass of water, ice cold glass, you know, ed, a Puke, it's like acidy and it tears up your throat. It wasn't, it was just like, it just came out. Was this in high school? I know I was, well, I would think I was in my fifth year of college by then. Now I'll leave it out of college. I was 21 when I did that. So I should have been a junior, but I was still a freshman. Yeah. And I tried, I drank beer and high school only because I don't drink beer now as you now cause I don't like the taste of it, but I drank it in high school because you know that's what you're trying.

Speaker 1:          00:38:22       Oh, that's my running joke with you. I school, I think you'd like this one and I always make sure it's the most hoppy discussing it. So rude. You know how much I don't like beer. I just, but yeah, I use, I would drink it in high school because that's what people were when you would drink in high school. But then I got onto the, uh, the Boone's farm there, you know, that cheap little strawberry wine and wine coolers. What is it called? Boone's farm. It's a kind of um, wine. It's like really sweet. Really cheap. Yeah. You get it. I like the gas station. We would, we would send them hang over. We, we, yeah, we would send it, you know, like one of the cuter girls, um, to go in there and just kind of like smile and just walk up with a couple of bottles of the Boone's Barb. And you know, the 19 year old or whatever kid behind or just let her buy it and not check your Id. Cause she's hot. She's cute, right? Yeah, exactly. Exactly. Yeah. Why fuck everybody. I mean I'm not, I'm not condoning that. I'm jealous, but I would, I always hated it, but I just did it because that's what you did. You know I'm jealous of that is what it is guys. You know, on a certain level, you're fucking resent that.

Speaker 4:          00:39:31       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:39:32       Because we don't have the option of being hot and cute and just getting something just coming like hat tea. He had like a case of beer playing with your nonexistent pigtail or maybe you're, you're a Steven Seagal ponytail. Just sort of twisting around. It is a weird visual. Let's read some fucking emails for the week. Um, Pakistani cricket fan. He said, all right man, this isn't, this is important. First podcast of 2003. Right.

Speaker 1:          00:40:02       All right, sorry about that. I fucked the thing up. I didn't delete last week's, I gotta get a memory card that has a little more memory on it anyways. Oh Jesus.

Why don't they like each other? I don't know. I'll be completely honest. You just got fuck. You were like, right. I thought you like you knew the answer. Now I don't lay down and I'm not, uh, not well versed in that I had made. All right. It's not my students, the usual shit. They live near each other. All right. Familiarity breeds contempt and they fight over cashmere much. You have a few years ago they will like, I'm gonna fucking Nokia and the other guys like, go ahead and tow it. We got the bomb toe. You don't remember that? No. Maybe that was a movie I saw anyways. So Pakistan, India just had a cricket series. We, our arch rivals and shit. Not only in cricket button, everything. I mean we had the biggest tank wars in Shit did you?

Speaker 1:          00:41:24       They should make a movie about that and have like Tan white people play you guys and then you guys can get offended. Um, so had this, these fucking commercials in which the voice said Pakistan is coming to India and they're faggot cricket player. Ooh. We're like, oh, he's saying, I thought they were saying, I thought they were saying that in the commercial. I was like, wow, no, this, this gentleman is, he's using it all right. Sorry. I'm sorry. Okay. And which the voice said Pakistan is coming to India and then they're a cricket player. We're like, let them come now these Indian cons are the last World Cup champions and we're ready to fuck Pakistan in the ass. Get what happened. Guess what happened? They got fucked big time now everything else in Pakistan is shit as you must know. Just do this man. Wow. This guy, you know, he is writing his second language here.

Don't use that word like that. Oh, you know what? You don't understand sports. How'd you like? Dang God. You thought you were going to beat Pakistan Woo. Where the defendant fucking champions with our fraternity paddles hitting that racket ball around the circular field. Well guess what? You fucking lost. You would think considering all you guys have 18 fucking kids, you could find a couple of Jordans in there.

Speaker 1:          00:43:24       Right? And you could repeat, oh well you know what? I think next year, Pakistan, you guys should play again and winner takes all of cashmere. What do you think about that? And you get all the other side's tanks go. How was that? Was that all right? Like, all right, cool. Thank you for that. Let me go. This is Belper. This was bill burr trashing anybody else? If you watch obscure sports aisle and you guys win a game, I'll talk trash about the other fucking person not knowing anything about, I don't even know. I don't even get the game I liked for it. You know what I like about cricket though is how long it is. You know when you drink this, this certain sports that you just going to love, you just the, there's a cricket game that people like drink out like that. It doesn't seem like, it seems more civilized in that for some reason. Why? I don't know why because it's foreign.

Speaker 1:          00:44:20       Wow. Cause it's nowhere like all white. They just looked like spiffier. I Dunno. They just looks like there's some sort of class element. Do you think it about Polo? No. Don't they were all way. I don't know. Pull up. Pull up an image of people playing cricket. I'm pretty sure everyone gets secretary. Everyone wears white. Well you have the laptop in front of you. I got, I got nothing. Oh listen, this, this is, this is why, of course they drink. They probably have, they probably have hooligans. You sit in the same, you think it's sophisticated after what this guy wrote, faggot. Cont rape. That's all. That's one. That's all in there. It isn't. That's crickets. Vance for you. Oh, that's not cricket fans. You know what that is? That sports fifth, that sports fans. We're morons. Yeah, but I think that more like, like something like a rugby, I feel like has more of a hooliganism attached to it.

Speaker 1:          00:45:09       I feel like cricket is more like, hello. You know what? We're going into the creek. Have you ever met a professional boxer or aura or one of those UFC guys? I guess so. If you meet them. Most of them, yeah. Most of them. They're really just mellow. Sure. They don't need to prove anything. Right. You know what I mean? Maybe it's the fan. So you're aware. We are not talking about the rugby players. Maybe the fans are more, I don't know. I, you know, I have no idea. I can tell you right now, I would keep my fucking mouth shut if I ever went to any sort of sporting event in another country. Unless, you know when I go to Canada it's hockey. I know hockey's backed by the way. I'm really excited that it's back great. All is forgiven. I don't give a fuck.

Speaker 1:          00:45:51       I've accepted it that it's a part of hockey every fucking five, six years. I have no idea what you're talking about. I know you don't usually eat it all is forgiven. What's forgiven the strike? They went on strike. Oh you noticed you've been able to watch way more real housewives this time this year. You notice I'm watching way more hoop and then if somehow in a fucking secretive way become a Knicks fan because they never show the Celtics cause we stink. So they're always showing the Knicks and I, I just, I'd love their team. Okay. I fucking love their team. Did you see that? Jr Smith's, that donkey had on that alleyoop with the guy threw a too low and he caught it down by his nuts and just with one hand just fucking threw it. There was one of the most vicious things I've ever seen, even probably as vicious is that baboons snapping that restless neck back in the fifties.

Speaker 1:          00:46:38       Um, alright. Innocent deer in headlights. Hey Bill. Loved the show. I'll start from the beginning but I'll be quick. I know people, you know I can't read so let's just get right to the fucking point. Yeah. Did you had, did you ever read aloud in class? I hated it. I hated it. I would be like trying to count ahead how many people and then try to guess which paragraph and I would always start looking over it before he got to it. Do you know when I was in the fourth grade, one time I had to read out loud and I got in my head and I was like going like, I'll just read the first couple sentences too. I did it. I was like, love the show. I'll start from the, and I finished it, I finished it. I wasn't baby, I wasn't a bit, I was in fourth grade, I should have been able to read shit had bill.

Speaker 1:          00:47:30       So when I finished reading the paragraph, the teacher went like before, you know, I was like, I was so fucking relieved that it was over and I was just waiting for her to call and the girl sitting behind me for her, you know, Jennifer read the next paragraph and when I finished there was this silence and then the teacher said, I didn't understand one word. He said, oh, anybody else understand what he saw? No, nobody said. She made me go back and reread it. I love the show. I'm like choking back tears hoes though from the beginning. Cause back in the 70s when you could be mean to people. Oh that's terrible. Or is he too fucking stupid? Be in this grade. You poor thing. That's not nice. It's not nice. It's fucking hilarious. I stunk at it and she called me out on it and I deserved it. What I should've done was viewed as a challenge and gone home and just walked around the house reading out loud. Well, you're in fourth grade, your brain doesn't work like that. Listen, you're never too young to start manning up.

Speaker 1:          00:48:37       Instead. I accepted defeat and I, I dunno, I know I never got that. Two things happen to me that year that were fucking brutal. They had the reading out loud and getting trashed for it and then they did this thing called, was it called a sound spelling. Okay. You know, you learn how to read in fourth grade. Yeah. You progress in the second grade. You learn how to spell and all that, all that shit first, second, third. Okay. It's still fresh in your head. Don't take it out of the oven. It's still all doughy. So you know what these fucking idiots do. They introduce sound spelling in the fourth grade and it's basically, uh, I guess phonetic spelling is what it properly proper name. Will you spell cat k a t. And they started going through all of these words that I just learned how to spell within the last couple of months to couple of years.

Speaker 1:          00:49:33       And they started putting case where there was cs and all this shit. And I never recovered. Never recovered. Why would they do that though? Why would they? Because somebody's, I don't get to, they thought that it would help with something. Why would they, why would they do that? Why would they put fluoride in toothpaste? Why would they do that when it slows your brain down and it makes you just kind of, you know, hey man, dreams aren't coming true. But however I look at these white teeth, you know, uh, I don't know what I'm talking about ever. Just know that. Know that about this podcast. I don't know what I'm talking about. Ever. The Monday morning podcast, that's your tag. That's it. Alright. Innocent deer in the headlights. All right. Push away that fourth grade.

Speaker 1:          00:50:17       Do you want me to read it for you? Hey, if that guy who played Darth Vader's voice can get over stuttering, I can do this. All right. Hey, bill loved the show. I'll start from the beginning. I'll be quick. I'm about to graduate college. I met a lady in one of my classes. We talked throughout the semester. Ah, dude. How many times was the moment to get a number coming and going and you were like, fuck. Um, and on the last day of class she offered me or number. There it is. She was, why we rolling her eyes the whole semester, like for the love of God. Do I gotta drop to my knees? Um, where the hell am I? She came up to, I know.

Speaker 5:          00:50:58       Oh. Oh Billy. Oh, Villi. Amanda Class. We talked. What the fuck was I? I thought she was having a flashback right now. Did I just make that part of it if I can't find it,

Speaker 1:          00:51:14       I met a girl, one of my class we talked throughout this semester. Last Day class. She asked me a number. I thought she was pretty cool and when, and went out with her later that week. She came up. No, she came and met me. She came in right.

Speaker 5:          00:51:26       Met Up with me on, this is fucking torture. Just read. Oh my God. They met up with me and my friends is

Speaker 1:          00:51:37       that a bar brings went well and we ended up going back to my place. Oh Gee, here's, we start fooling around on the couch and then she gets up and guides me into my room and I was getting nervous because I haven't been with many girls and not entirely sure what to do in this situation. Um, she strips naked and while we are sitting on my bed, she opens her legs to reveal a white string coming out of her lady. Enos guys with the gross details here. I wasn't really sure what it was at the time. Oh, this guy's, he's a fucking, he's like that. He's like that little fat rabbit sitting outside the, uh, the apartment complex. He didn't know what it was. Well, maybe he was just so disoriented that he just was like, what is good? There's no, there's nothing in a guy's upbringing that says, uh, you know, tells you about the rip cord.

Speaker 1:          00:52:31       You know, that's just something you just learned. It's one of the few things like, you know, back in the day on his toes to learn about like the whole reproductive system. It's literally like half an hour, not even half an hour. Maybe it's a 10 minute part of your lesson about the reproductive system when they, if they, if they didn't have that, they didn't have that when I was growing up. But I can guarantee you in those classes, they never say, hey, and if you ever time to bang some chick who's on the rag, right, right. Of course, if you see that little string coming out, uh, that means you've trying to bang girl and turns out she's on the rag. You know why? But the thing is she knows she's having her period. So why is, she won't read the, we know what she's gonna do. She's gonna want to eat, she's going to want a bang and say it's not a heavy flow day or she's going to take it in there. Oh yeah. That's that. That could be alright. Let's just, this is getting gross. This is like really graphic, very graphic because I wasn't really sure what it was at the time. I would have loved if you said what you thought it might be.

Speaker 1:          00:53:32       Ah, she flossing down there. Um, I told her exactly what I was thinking and he said, this is what he said. This is classic. He sees, she said that naked with the legs spread and he goes, there's a white thing. Dot Dot. Dot.

Speaker 4:          00:53:48       There.

Speaker 1:          00:53:54       She told me that it was a Tan Tampon. Yeah. And that she was on her period. She said it was fine in still wanted to have sex. I got really weirded out, not grossed out. I got really weirded out. So I told her that maybe we should wait. She told me there are other ways I called it a, I was still, or maybe even further freaked out by this girl. So we just went to sleep. Keep in mind that this, this is the first night we ever hung out. Yeah. Why did you let her stay there? Did I do the right thing? Should I meet up with her again or is she crazy? I don't, I don't understand. It's a lot. And Go fuck yourself. What? Ha, I'm confused. Did I do the right thing by not sleeping with her? Yeah. By not having anal sex with her or whatever, or just plowing through the fucking storm.

Speaker 5:          00:54:47       If you didn't feel comfortable fetus, it'd be, didn't feel comfortable with it, then you shouldn't have such thing. A captain on a ship. I just going through the wave captain, you're crazy. Well, I got him back a Jeff Fag. I'm sorry you put that word in my head. Who did that fucking guy over there? Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:55:09       Never say the f word. I say, fuck, I don't say faggot.

Speaker 5:          00:55:14       I've tried to take it out. They took, they told me to knock it off. I respect it. You, you do knock it off. So I said, right. Yeah. You know, I'm not trying to be a dick here, but for the longest time you called somebody effect. It had nothing to do. It just meant you were a pussy. We didn't know what he was saying. I know that you fucking faggot. We get it. I'm just saying. So anyways,

Speaker 5:          00:55:46       Bill bird trying to knock it off. I'm trying, the thing is you're so sometimes you're so, I don't know of innocence, the right word, but sometimes you are you going to say hope you're still, yeah. You're so dumb about the, like you'd be offensiveness that you grew up with. You're always like what everybody says, you're so defensive about it for so long. Yeah. But you know, cause it's like you honestly don't know any better cause you're, yeah, you're dumb. And then finally enough people explain it to you that you are a human being. You have a heart and you're a sensitive. So you're like, oh, okay. Right. I won't say it anymore. Jesus fucking Christ. Like the attitude you have about it. It's like you want to be a good person, but you're like, you're angry that you have to like, let go of this part of your past where people just said Sag to each other. And it was like, hey, that's what we say. It's Boston and go fucking, well, you know, Jimmy Dore,

Speaker 1:          00:56:48       the great Jimmy Dore actually did his show, uh, um, Friday night and he's so God damn funny, he has the funniest fucking bit on that on knock it off. Why that's a dumb ad campaign because it really is like, you know, hey, knock it us really like this parental, I don't know. I don't, we'll saying, oh that's gay or stuff like that. Yeah. He's not saying that that's wrong to try and get people to stop doing it, but is that the best way to get people to stop doing it by saying, hey, knock it off. Like you're driving the car and you're their parent, you're swinging it. They're like, I don't want to step on his bid. Here. Go, go see Jimmy Dor and request that bit.

Speaker 5:          00:57:31       Um, so anyway, this young man is things that I do the right thing by not sleeping with her. And should I see her again because he knows

Speaker 1:          00:57:38       so loose free 100%. If she wanted to have straight up vaginal sex, there was not a condom thick enough or all encompassing that would have to take up. Like you'd have to put it on like underwear, that condom and boxer underwear and then have to all be rubber. You'd have to put on basically a wetsuit that had like a little flappy thing,

Speaker 5:          00:57:58       therefore your deck. So you did the right thing. And he was talking about he would not have felt comfortable having sex with this girl while she said he, if he already was thrown off by the fact that she had a Tampon. And if you know this girl is a pig, why is she a pig? Because you don't defend her just because she's a woman. Um, and I'm asking a question. I'm, I'm defending the a pig. What she's paying from her private parts. Yeah. And just, it's just like, let's fucking have at it. That is some fucking truck stop large Marge shit. All right, give me a fucking break. I'm not trashing all woman women.

Speaker 1:          00:58:34       Woman here is a pig. He probably no protection. Oh Ko k could have gone in the back door with this girl first fucking day. She's a pig. So what use are you feel like she wasn't ladylike and respecting herself enough or something? This is what I'm thinking. You ever see the club everybody wants to go to when there's that long line down the street? Yeah. That's what has been lining up to her. Her fucking private parts ever heard of the term slut shaming? Have you heard this term that people, is it something else? Well that's one I've never used so I don't need to knock that off. I've never

Speaker 5:          00:59:11       knock it off. But have you heard of slut shaming? Which is no, but I can, I can. I can guess what it is. How good of a woman does it. She's a whore. Right?

Speaker 1:          00:59:22       Exactly. And that's the truest thing you'll ever fucking read. Okay. What is the truest thing that if a woman does it, she is a whore. So you believe in that whole double standard abso-fucking-lutely why is that exactly? Because you, there's, there's no skill involved with you guys getting laid. All you have to do, hey, is this is a skill based thing and what defines skill? The skills that you feel like you're presenting it. You're getting laid as a guy. Tell me all about your amazing skills that are you done? Are you done? Oh yeah. For now. Then we've already had this argument. Yes. We talked about it in a bar one time and I said, okay, let's turn the tables. All right, let's pretend that I'm holding the fucking bag of gold and you're calming and trying to get it. Okay. Hit on me. Come, come, go do it right now.

Speaker 1:          01:00:09       Right? Right now I give good. Thank you. Oh No, I'm not good at it. I'm not coaching. You know why? Why? Because it's a skill. When women sit there and they go, oh my God, guys come up to me and they say that Donald stuff and it's all, that's all you have to say as a guy. Oh yeah. What would you say? Go ahead. Dazzle me. Come up me with your, hey baby, what's your sign fucking line? What do you got convinced me? Hey, uh, exactly. Exactly. We have to convince people on stage late at night. And I thought you were pretty funny.

Speaker 4:          01:00:41       Oh thanks

Speaker 1:          01:00:43       sue. Yeah, and I'll be, I'll be, I'll be the girl who's going to deliberately make it difficult. I'm not, and I'm not good at it. You know I'm not good at hitting on people. That's not my, and you know why that is nice because you didn't have to do is put on a spaghetti strap dress. It'd be like, Ooh, did I drop a Napkin? And you're in the game flirting. I can do. But that's different. That's more like conversational. But no, I'm not going to just walk up to understand that as a guy, you have to convince a woman to have sex with you with after you've convinced her, you have to continue convincing her. It's all the way back to the apartment. You got to keep the plates spinning and any little fucking thing can throw it off. Okay. So because of, because of that whole struggle that you pour men have to do in order to get a woman to sleep with you, I feel bad for you. Okay. So because there is that difference, then just no respect. And then I suppose that makes it okay to say, if a girl is like, hey, let's just, you know, I want to have fun with you. Let's let's have sex. All of a sudden she's a slut or a pig and all that, and the guy is like, what the hero or the more skilled of the two of them. It doesn't make any sense.

Speaker 4:          01:01:49       I get done Nia

Speaker 1:          01:01:52       [inaudible] fucking date. She's sitting there, okay, she wants to have sex, whatever. But you're sitting there with a fucking bloody rag hanging out of you and you don't even know this guy and you just fucking spread your fucking legs. And he's like, ah, yeah, there's a thing hanging out of there. And she says, there's other ways. I guarantee you, you know what that girl is? That's the girl. When you take out the condom, who goes, ah, God, I hate condoms. That fucking girl you ever girl ever says, God, I hate condoms. Immediately run the other direction. Go in the bathroom, rub one out. Get that dumb idea out of your fucking head. God, I hate condoms. Run the other way too to keep it fair. No, you're right. You're so into women's issues right now. You can't see the trees through the forest and this guy was a fucking pig.

Speaker 1:          01:02:42       No, I mean I know I definitely, you're right. A girl who has got a Tampon and who's spreading her legs and being like, Hey, and the guy was like, ah, are you one your what's going on there? And she's like, hey, there's other ways to do it. Ways. I mean, I haven't got any friends. I guess there's like smoother ways to, I don't have this guy. I would never do that. I admit that. But I'm not necessarily throwing all bad judgment behind this girl because maybe she was just drunk and she was probably like, Oh shit, I'm on my period is a babe in the woods. He could've been at this point with her after his first class. Okay. He hasn't been with a lot of girls. He basically is like, do you ever see that video of those guys who put put a goat in a, in a fucking cage with a python and it doesn't even know it was horrible.

Speaker 1:          01:03:33       They didn't think that it, the goat didn't even know what it was. The fucking snakes like Oh shit. Literally and like lick the fucking pythons face kind of freak the thing out. Like Whoa, what was that? And then all of a sudden, by the time it realizes what it's in the cage with, it's fucking over. So terrible. So this guy is the goat and this girl is pot. It's a snake. And he doesn't realize what he's saying. And just by the doubt and the snake, by dumb luck, by dumb luck, she went to strike and he fucking shook it like the fucking head was turning into a parable. The goat in the snake. Well, all right. So basically, clearly this girl has a little too, is on a different level than this guy. And perhaps he should maybe find a girl that's probably is at some point of life is going to have the STD fun pack.

Speaker 1:          01:04:21       You know, what's, what's included in that front pack? A little, well, gonorrhea, probably some crabs. The starter kit, the starter kit, you know, before you move on to the more serious shit like Bola herps is forever. So that's pretty interesting. I would think. That sounds like an advertising campaign for herpes forever. It's forever. Herps purpose forever. But don't they have like a, they have like that medicine you can take and keep it at bay. Uh, yeah. That's what they say in the commercials I like. And if you have an outbreak, take more or whatever. I Dunno. I Dunno what they tell you to do that. That coke commercial. It just scary. It's just like, you know that just because you've taken this and you don't have an outbreak doesn't mean you can't spread it. Right. Do you know how happy that makes me feel to be with you? That we don't have the herb but we don't have the Herp I don't have to worry about that. It's forever. Right. Those things. What I was single, they scared the fucking shit out of me and I remember then I hear stuff like, even if you wear a condom, that's not 100% I was just, Oh my God,

Speaker 4:          01:05:23       okay.

Speaker 1:          01:05:24       Yeah. I go, yes, she's on my fingers. She's, she's a, and this is not, it doesn't seem like this is the girl for you. She might be a little too advanced. Will you stop alligator Armand it, this might not be the girl for you. She's a little too advanced. This woman is a fucking war pig. Your House eight arm and not, I'm trying to be like tender and you know, Nice. You know what alligator arms means? You don't watch sports. Now I don't. You know what? I really don't appreciate when I come down here and having this conversation with you and you want to throw these little sports things that me and you always, you always say, oh, you don't want sports. Oh, you didn't get the sports they like, you'd have to like remind me that I'm not on the same level as you like, so I'm not going to get all your amazing sports references and terms and phrases and I don't appreciate that.

Speaker 1:          01:06:08       Can you guys believe that? Went in 10 minutes of just going on this rant about how dumb I am and how innocent I am with using the word fag and I, I don't mean you have like an innocent heart, but you're dumb and you're, you just respond with rage the whole way. You made me this fucking like simpleton. You'd be doing everything but fucking, you know, being in a big goof like, hey, what are you doing? Look walking on the street like you don't want accidentally crushed somebody to death trying to hug them. That's how you just painted me. You're like, yeah, you're like of a, of mice and men. That's how you're painting me. Within 10 minutes of this, you're Lenny and of mice and men. That's how you do. Yeah, that's exactly how you described me. I'm too dumb to know that fucking reference cause I, I see alligator arm is okay. You've seen an alligator, right? Yeah. Do they have long arms now? They do not. They do not. And it's basically it's a, uh, it's a sports term.

Speaker 4:          01:07:02       MMM.

Speaker 1:          01:07:04       Somebody throws you the ball and you could actually reach out and get it, but you don't totally reach out cause you're worried about getting hit. Okay. Sort of Alex. So you alligator arms. It's like Ah, so and if you don't catch the ball, the guy can't hit you. Oh okay. I thought so. I'm saying so your alligator arm and this and that, you're going, this girl isn't the girl for you, but blah blah blah. He's, he's in there with the fucking pit viper. Right. He's the goat and she's the PS. He is the STD free goat and he is walking into a fucking Beta of just, I mean,

Speaker 1:          01:07:39       I mean this girl probably I want to get it to is just fucking just off for you. She's not the girl for you. That's bad advice. Why this girl, I'm telling you, you fucking pig. And you'd have to suppose to do about it. Tell the whole fucking school she's not the girl for you. Move on to somebody else's more your speed. Why is that bad advice? Because you're acting like, you know, she's not into sports, likes to eat and as a morning person, he likes sports and staying up. You know what? This person isn't like, you know, this person isn't for you. I meant as like a foodie. It's like, it's a simple way of saying that you know you should move on. That's, that's all it is. No, it's like you're sitting there with the toddler and he's about ready to touch a hot stove.

Speaker 1:          01:08:25       You got to be like, there has to be a sense of urgency here. Like, like, no, no, no, no, no. This, this will hurt you as well. Hope you know, you make that little fucking can. They don't even speak English. You're trying to fucking, and they can't, they can't speak yet. You're trying to fucking fuck. Go Fuck Yourself. You're sitting there talking to this person like, um, hey, try some of this sandwich. Yeah, I didn't really like that bread. Well, maybe you'll like this bread like it, like it's just like this whimsical. There's too many Daisy's and what you're saying, this is, this is a very dangerous situation. This guy should stay away from this girl on all fucking and all girls like this. She's got a, she's on her period and she has no fucking like, like class. She has opened so leg, like what was he supposed to do? Pull it out and just go off on it. There's other ways she suggesting anal. This girl is like up. She's a fucking mess. Stay away from this girl. This girl get pregnant. This girl will give you a fucking disease. This girl was steal your laptop girls a fucking nightmare.

Speaker 1:          01:09:26       Knock it off. All right. All right. Advice for a lady. Dear Bill, I've been with my boyfriend for two years now. We're in college together and he's currently taking a semester abroad. Oh Jesus. Where in Brazil. Before he left, we had a running joke that I was going to need a vibrator when he left as a surprise party gift. He got me one. I have a couple of friends whose boyfriends bought them sex toys. So while I was a little surprised, he actually got me a vibrator. I also happen to know that it's a relatively normal, it's relatively normal for a boyfriend and do that. Yeah. That's basically like this era's chastity belt. You know, you're trying to lock down the pussy. That's disgusting. Yeah. That, but that's what he's doing now anyway. Yeah. But it's done because those things are used them too much. They numb up your area there and then the guy can't even remotely try and, you know,

Speaker 1:          01:10:24       do something for it. And then you gotta be sitting there banging, banging them as their user are using the thing. As, you know, it's like you want an alien, a fucking this girl that's just all dick has no body. All right, whatever. Let's move on one of the base. Pay Some of my fucking life. I did live a little bit of a life before I met you. I realize that any way, fast forward to about a week ago, we were on Skype. Uh, he asks you to take this thing out. Um, no, we don't have sex chats. Thank God. And he casually asked me how his gift for me was working out. I told them it was working out pretty well. He then mentioned that he had bought something for himself, a fleshlight Joe Rogan experience is brought to you by the fleshlight every week. He does a very weird, those are very rare.

Speaker 1:          01:11:20       Weird fucking okay. They look like that thing. Boba Fett I fell into when he died and one of those space movies. Okay. Wow. Um, I knew how to be faithful to right. That's nice. Okay. He said, she goes, I knew what this was because I am an avid listener of Joe Rogan's podcast. How you doing? Joe Rogan's come up three times in this podcast who raves about it constantly. My boyfriend had never mentioned to me that he was interested in anything like that and I always thought the idea of it was totally creepy. I acted like it was totally cool, but in all honesty, I really don't want him to be fucking a perfect fake wait, I got lost in that. I actually was thinking as Joe going to get mad that I'm saying that this is weird. Okay. I acted like it was totally cool, but in all honesty, I really don't want him to be fucking of perfect fake vagina whenever he wants to.

Speaker 1:          01:12:16       I'm finding myself getting crazy jealous and angry whenever I think about it. I know, I know I'm jealous of an inanimate object, which seems insane. Let me finish. I'm really struggling with this because part of me wants to be completely okay with it since it's sort of a hypocrite. It's sort of hypocritical to get angry when he got me a vibrator. But now I'm starting to think that maybe he only bought me a Dildo so I wouldn't be able to complete when he got himself a proxy pussy, Pussy. So what do you think? Do I need to suck it up and get over this or is my jealousy legitimate? Thanks and go fuck yourself.

Speaker 5:          01:12:56       Um, go fuck is fake pussy. As long as he's not faking a real pussy. I mean fucking a real policy and then you know, it's all good. Plus you, you, it's not just like the, the pussy that it's, that he's missing. He's also missing like, you know, you're touching and kissing and the whole other part of it too. And that fake pussy cat low. Am I there? No, he isn't. He's getting right to the dessert.

Speaker 1:          01:13:22       Don't be jealous. Tried these Brussels sprouts. Don't need them.

Speaker 5:          01:13:26       Don't be jealous. I bring over the trace late shea, when he comes back it will be even better because you both have been like doing it with inanimate objects and so I don't to be rediscovering each other all over again. I'll be even better. I don't think. They don't even worry. I don't think it's a good thing.

Speaker 1:          01:13:40       Why? Because uh, once you start down a path sexually, you know, in order to get off that path, you don't just jump over onto another path. You got to walk all the way back up the path you went down, get to the fork where you fucked up and then head down the other one. What I'm saying is he might get used to just doing that and this sensation of that is what gets him off. And then when her pussy doesn't feel like fleshlight,

Speaker 3:          01:14:12       he'll, he'll, he'll build bang her and then, and then when he needs to finish, he'll be like, all right, and now for me and what that fucking thing

Speaker 5:          01:14:24       better. If anything, he'll be like, oh my God, I forgot what a real woman feels like and he'll be done in like two minutes. What's your hope? Um, I don't think she should be jealous of it though. They're both, they're both doing the right thing when you're in a relationship and you're that far apart from each other because he did bang all sorts of Harry European girls, no offense to hear European girls, but I'm just saying, you know, well

Speaker 3:          01:14:48       listen, I watched this thing one time or listen to it on the radio, uh, one of those call sex shows and this guy had a pull away. He jerked off cause he dry hump the rug. It was causing like chafing on his dick and it, but it, it, it was the only way he could get off because he wasn't in a relationship for a while and he kept doing that and I dunno. So I'm just saying like I would go easy on those. It's like anything, anything in moderation. How often is he using this and how often is she using that? If you use a vibrating too much, you numb yourself up down there. And then when you guys down there that he can't feel anything. It's so disgusting. Um, overrated. Underrated for the week. Overrated. The Superbowl, underrated rounds one and two of the NFL playoffs build.

Speaker 3:          01:15:35       This may be sacrilegious to say in America, but I actually enjoy rounds one and two of the NFL playoffs more than the Superbowl. That is a sector religious because at no point is beyond say or Brittany Spears sing before and in the halftime show there's not a bunch of douchebags who don't like football showing up feeling like they have to be there. You know, all the broads. Why did you look? Yeah, why are you looking at me? Cause you go to super bowl parties every year and you hate football. Yeah. Well they're fun. They're nice gatherings. Talk when the game's on. No, I don't run. Yap. When the most important game is on, it's disgusting. If you do it again this year we're breaking up each week you get two games both on Saturday and Sunday. There seems to be that we can win this thing, excitement in the air and I can relax and watch the games and the comfort of my home or at a local bar without dozens of non-fans in the room as is typically the case of the Superbowl party Superbowl and the other hand has become so pretentious in recent years.

Speaker 3:          01:16:37       I don't even really want to get worked up for it as much as I used to. The game takes forever. 85% of the commercial sucks and we're forced to stare at Madonna's beat up face for 30 minutes during a halftime show plus the two week gap in between the Superbowl and the conference champion really takes the air out of the sales. What are your thoughts? I think this is what you do. You watch the Superbowl alone and you tape it and you start watching it, you DVR it and you watch, you let you let you give the game a 90 minute headstart

Speaker 1:          01:17:10       and then then you just sit down, you watch it by yourself and you plow through the pregame and you just watch the fucking game and when the halftime show comes, you fast forward through that and now you're under the third quarter and third quarter and fourth quarter it's going to be regular time football. That's the way to watch the Superbowl and you watch it by yourself. Maybe with another buddy of yours who that enjoys the game. That's how I would do it. You know?

Speaker 3:          01:17:36       No thoughts on that? No. But what about the social aspects? You're going to have brownies during the oak cheese doodles. Oh my God. The way the broads talked to her and that fucking game and then and then and it's true. Shuts up to watch the commercials and then, and then the game comes back on. The third one was late. What did you think? Well that's definitely the best one so far. How much did that cost? Well, why don't you stop going to the Superbowl parties, Matt and bill, why don't you stop if you don't like the game. I don't do any of that. So that you're talking about, I don't, I don't like needles. I don't go to your fucking metapoint party book. Two needles. They don't do anything. What do you do? Arts and crafts. I don't crash the Superbowl or those things and come there and talk when you're trying to glue the popsicle sticks together and then shut the fuck up. When a talk throughout the game, I go in the other room or I hang out with other people if they're lies. Lies, lies. Yeah. That's the Monday morning podcast. Oh, before I get outta here. Oh, that's it. That's it. Where he did a nice long one. All right. No. Okay.
