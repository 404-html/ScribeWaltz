Well, I'll tell you why because tonight I'm going to the basketball game.

Speaker 1:          00:02:47       Michigan Versus Louisville. All right. The NCAA championship game. Why wouldn't ya? You're in town. Does still tickets to be had. Could you believe that there's still tickets we had, dude, Atlanta has to be the worst fucking sports town on the face of the United States. I didn't say the earth. Okay. I'm not going to be arrogant and act like I know sports fans from here to Timbuktu. I don't even know where Tim Buck two is. I don't even know if that's a real fucking place. I don't know if that's an expression. I don't know who shot at. I don't know who's not. Um, but they fucking suck here in Atlanta.

Speaker 1:          00:03:30       Okay. In Atlanta, they suck George bulldogs. That's a whole different story you gave me. No Damn dogs. I'm in there. I'm between the hedges. Okay? I'm not talking about the SCC college fucking sports fans down here. Those people are fucking lunatics. All right? They're out there making moonshine before the game. They're out of their fucking minds. The read that full on fucking redneck or they're like that. Um, oh, Belvedere, they'll come here and all, they have that fucking plantation vibe. One of the other, just talking about the white people down here. All right? So, and the drug addicts are all in the waffle house. All right? If you want to score some meth and get a delicious breakfast and you're in the south, I have to recommend the fucking waffle house. That's the place to go. If you'd like to maybe get into a fight. If you didn't even know that you wanted to get into a fight, that's what you want to fucking go. Waffle houses basically. That would be the south. That's Kinda of their end. What the fuck is the equivalent to that up in the north? Just someplace we could go out and get some food and maybe get the shit kicked out of you. Maybe get a prostitute.

Speaker 2:          00:04:42       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:04:43       Maybe you have a heart attack. What does that, the cheesecake factory. You know what? I'll have to get back to you on that one. Anyway, so I'm here and I'm going to be going to the, uh, the basketball game tonight. What the fuck is what? This chair, it's one of these fucking chairs. Oh, I keep hitting the adjustive thing with my calf. Sorry. It's not the chair's fault. It's my fault. All right. You know what's great about this chair is it's not a live person, so I don't really have to apologize to it, even though I just did it. This was a woman I have to be like, you know, right now she would have her arms crossed looking out the window. You know, I just, I understand that you know, you have a lot of pressure because you've been traveling a lot lately. Okay. But this snapping and, and just immediately going to the anger. No, no, let me finish. Okay. I think you've said enough for them. Morning.

Speaker 1:          00:05:33       You know, they just say that shit just gets you fucking going. I'd have to apologize to it, you know, and buy some flowers by it. Some stuff, you know, sorry, chair. My Midi calf actually was hitting the adjustment thing, so it wasn't your fault. It wasn't a design fall flaw or whatever the fuck I'm trying to say. What am I trying to say? I'm trying to say that I'm going to the NCAA championship came tonight here in Atlanta and it's not even fucking sold out. How fucking hilarious is that? What is wrong with the city of Atlanta? You know what it is this too much. This too much pussy in the city, that people, they just don't go to the fucking too much pussy in too much. Jesus. Yeah. Both sides of the fucking rainbow, you know? And they just don't go to the Goddamn Games was the last time I Braves games sold out.

Speaker 2:          00:06:25       You know,

Speaker 1:          00:06:27       if I ran the Braves, you know what I would do? I'd put a fucking stripper pole out there in the goddamn bullpen, you know, so the people out here could make it rain in between innings and then I think maybe I could get the stadium half fucking full. Oh, fuck you. What the fuck is this? South Carolina? This is like a fucking phone or I got to do, I, I'm doing that. Um, the hell was I titled the Stripper Pole. Yeah. Do you know what kills me about the fucking Atlanta Braves? Is they still do that Tomahawk chop that shit.

Speaker 2:          00:07:04       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:07:05       And there's no passion behind it is

Speaker 2:          00:07:07       ah, ah,

Speaker 1:          00:07:16       what kind of a fucking asshole does that? How many tribes have said how fucking offensive that is? You know what I mean? That's what I, that's when I really fucking hate people when they're just like, you know, Whoa, what are the eight got nothing to do with that. You know, that's stupid. Just, you know, it's like people like Erin to the confederate flag, you know, and they tried to say that it has nothing to do with fucking slavery and just has to do with southern pride. Give me a fucking break. You know, just be a fucking racist. Just man up and be a racist. Just get a nice fucking swastikas swastika tattoo right on your forehead. Stop being passive aggressive. Probably gonna get kicked out of this hotel for saying this. I'll fuck you Steve jobs with your fucking noises. I heard it. I heard it. I grabbed the phone. I fucking reacted to it. You can't from the gravy, still a cunt. I wonder whose idea he stole for that fucking thing and then passed it off as his own as he goes out and tries to fucking levitate with one of those cheesy fucking magicians.

Speaker 2:          00:08:23       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:08:23       Goddamn fucking phone. I hate this fucking thing. You know what kills me too is you put it on, you put it on vibrate. I mean there's no way to shut it up. I'm sure there is. If I read the fucking manual, you know, but I don't have time for that and read a fucking cell phone manual. Finally figure the thing out and then what? It's obsolete. And eight months bill quit yelling. You just lazy. All right, maybe I shouldn't be going off on the dead guy. You know that Douche bags on the cover of fucking Time magazine with like Albert Einstein as far as people who changed and shaped the world the way it worked, this stupid advertising where they lined themselves up with Gandhi has actually fucking worked. Cause now the dude's dead. And on the cover of life magazine, they had, you know, Jesus didn't even make the fucking cover or maybe did, I don't know, but what the fuck, you know?

Speaker 2:          00:09:14       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:09:15       They actually had a really good picture of Albert Einstein. They had a younger version of him, you know, where his hair wasn't all fucking gray and he didn't have that sad look on his face. You know that look he had on his face after he fucking showed those psychos how to, how to blow up all of Japan. All right. This is the cover. The cover is Abraham Lincoln. Jesus, Albert Einstein, Martin Luther King, the Beatles, Hitler, some old broad with fucked up teeth. Uh, Mother Teresa fucking a Gandhi. Uh, Jesus. What the fuck is the name of that guy who spent all those years in prison for, in apartheid or whatever the fuck his name is? Was it William William H Macy? The fuck is that guy's name. You finally got out and his wife stuck by him and then he fucking dumped her. And then the guy who came up with the phone that angry look on his face with the Edison.

Speaker 2:          00:10:11       Okay,

Speaker 1:          00:10:11       the fuck is a guy's name here. Sidney Poitier. I'm the worst. I don't fucking know who anybody is. And anyways, they got Steve Jobs, Steve Jobs, rubbing elbows with all those fucking people. Fucking stupid ass God damn nerds. Cause he did what? He invented a phone. Did he even invent it? Having already talked about this on stage up on this silver screen. Um, so anyways, I'm out here in fucking Atlanta and I'm going to that Goddamn game tonight, this stupid concert. They don't even fucking sell the thing out there. Still doing that Tomahawk Chop.

Speaker 2:          00:10:49       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:10:50       It's like why? Why, why would you do that?

Speaker 1:          00:10:53       Yeah, that and they got the fucking drum. Bowden Dum, Dum, Dum, Dum, Dum, Dum. I was just talking about this on the regular guys morning show. My brother took a tour one time somewhere in Arizona and they were talking about how native Americans played their drums and they will be like, they play it like this. They play it like that. But at no point did they ever go banner dump, dump, dump, dump, dump, dump. That's just some fucking Hollywood shit where they hired a white guy with the Tan, maybe have a little bit of a sunburn, you know, to give them the reddish tinge that they thought they, the fucking Indians have, which I've never understood. If you see a real native American, there's nothing read about their skin, you know, you know, it was a fucking red skin. I am God damn fucking redhead. You put me out in the sun, I will fuck with any native American.

Speaker 1:          00:11:46       A patchy. I don't give a fuck who you are. My skin will be redder than yours. I should be offended by the Washington Redskins. They make fun of me, not Yo. All right. Just the fact that your face is on the side of the helmet, that's just a misdirection. All right? It's just another group of people coming at us, fucking redheads, and you know what? I want to get sick of it. All right? I'm sick of conch coming up to me, telling me that I'm going to be extinct. Like I'm some sort of fucking white rhino.

Speaker 1:          00:12:15       You know you're going to do, you guys are going to be gone by 2040 it's like I'm going to be 72 in 2040 it's still going to be here. You cunt. You know why? You know why? I'll tell you why. Cause they go out to these hotels. All right. Oh, there's another plane. Where are those people going? God, I always wished I was on a plane going to some place. Exciting. Sorry. That was the inner monologue of a woman who got married at 22. Um, anyways, plowing ahead here. This is why I'm going to live to be 72 cause I don't stay in motels. I don't fucking make speeches about how to change the world, at least on my podcast. Maybe I do. Okay, but I'm not standing in front of fucking a zillion people. All right? So no one's going to whack me. All right?

Speaker 1:          00:13:01       I got good genes. And you know what? Today I go downstairs, they got the fucking continental breakfast down there. They've got the breakfast buffet and they also got the whole thing you can order from the menu. All right? And what do I see down there? I see all the mantated fat fucks who got the corner office and they're down. They're getting themselves in the all American breakfast, two, three eggs, any style, the fucking bacon, the potatoes just, well, you know what they are when they're fucking grabbing their heart by the, by the lapels grabbing and just go, hey mother fucker. Right. And then just need it. Right. If they keep, if you're hardhead balls, that's what you're doing with that breakfast. The all American, you know, and I did. I went down there like a little fucking twinkle toes. All right. I was up on my, on my tip toes and I did a little dance move when I slid into the booth and the lady, you know, the lady came over, you know, it's a waitress.

Speaker 1:          00:13:59       Like I think all waitresses should be female. Even the waiters. That's just a broad job. I'm a hungry man. I want food to be brought to me. This should be a woman involved in that. Okay, I'm traditional. I'm old school. I pay for the movie. I want my sandwich made by a woman that's a man and a fancy hat. Some poor excuse for a fucking pope hat dude. How far down is the fucking Catholic religion fallen now that we're all over there, all the way down there in there, in like south, they had to leave this country. They're gradually moving to the third world just because they, that's the last place that people are still believed that some bearded dude on water. Talk to a fucking Bush and then, uh, you know, died and then came back three days later, you know, Oh shit, the fire engines are coming up. I think there's a plane on fire. That is my big fear. My big fear is not dying in a plane crash. It's surviving the plane crash and then being soaked in jet fuel and burning up, you know, for a nice four second death of, and then that's it.

Speaker 1:          00:15:22       You know, you'd probably be even higher, much higher pitched. I wonder what the, I mean, how many decibels you can, you can actually create if you're burning and jet fuel. It's so fucking terrifying when you go to takeoff, you literally just, you're, you're in a tube of gasoline. Yeah. Belt. We get it. We understand that you need a lot of Gath GI bill. Do you need a lot of gas to fly across the country while your podcast is so informative? Oh, so anyway, so I'm down there and I get the fucking breakfast. Okay. And I could've got the fucking three eggs, any style. I could've got the pancakes or the waffles. You know how they do that shit? When they turned it into a dessert, they got everything but fucking chocolate frosting on him now. I said, fuck all that. And I said to the lady, I said, you know what, let me get the cold cereal cold called like fucking Margaret Thatcher's knees. And I'm not saying that because she's dead. Okay. That fucking shape shift and rectal, you know, I actually think that she's George Bush

Speaker 1:          00:16:29       like that. That's like his altar regrow is, he's actually actually ego ego. He's actually also Margaret Thatcher. You know, just the theory, just something to kick around in a bar. I think they're all the same person, you know, and they shoot all the world leaders all in the same living room. And uh, maybe it's, maybe he, he's not a shape shifter, but he's got some excellent like Hollywood makeup, you know, and then like when he was supposed to be in America and nat can debt, and then, you know, then when they cut to him over and fucking be, and Margaret Thatcher and he's, oh, Johnny, he just fucking just changes his voice. He's like the Mel Blanc of like the Illuminati. That's what I think. And I actually voted for the mother fucker. I liked him. He was, they supposed to vote for that fucking squinty Polak fucking riding around in the God damn tank. Oh, was he a Greek dude? You guys know Copernicus, the guy who figured out that the fucking earth didn't go, you know, it was going around the sun and that the sun was the center of the universe. That guy was a Polak. All these Polish jokes, you know Copernicus, that doesn't sound like a Polish name to me. That sounds Greek. But I digress. So I go down there. What do I get? I get the fucking raisin bran with the 2% milk there, right?

Speaker 1:          00:17:43       I get the milk from that cow. That was probably fed another cow. So God knows what kind of fucking, uh, poisons are in me right now. That's only 2% of it as opposed to 4%. You understand that, right? Um, 2% of what I have no fucking idea. I actually read something one time or how they do, do the fat count. It's bullshit. It's kind of like how they do the gas mileage on the cars. When they drive the car like two miles an hour with like a fucking hurricane wind behind you, it gets 60 miles a gallon. Um, and then you get it, you only get 20 and you're like, what the fuck? They're like, well, you're stepping on the gas pedal too much, but how do I make it go without doing that, sir? Why are you being hostile? Cause you're a cunt. That's why.

Speaker 1:          00:18:25       And then you're out of that, then you're out of the showroom and that's it. That's it. Do you ever go into a showroom and you see the fingerprints on the glass and you see 1 cent where it's, they're really indented in the window and then they kind of slide to the right. That's the guy who used the c word. He said cut in the showroom, then was dragged out. Um, yeah. I don't know. I'm talking about, so yeah, so I went with raisin brand, then I've got a banana, put it on top and you know what? I'm fucking full, you know, filled up the fucking stomach. And I didn't go down there and, and, and just, just, you know, just starting your day with fucking 1200 calories to your ass and now you're down to 800 and you know, you're going to do that at lunch and then you'd done and then the rest of the day, all it is, is just fucking overflow spillage for your fucking arteries. And you got damn muffin top. All right.

Speaker 1:          00:19:17       Why am I yelling at you guys this week? I don't know. I'm fucking know in a, I'm in a great mood. I'm going to go to this fucking game tonight. It's going to be tremendous. I'm going to have the whole road to myself. Why? Because it's a sporting event in Atlanta. I'm telling you, if they put stripper poles down there, they would have fucking sold it out. And what? It costs me like nine grand a ticket. Um, so I actually, I have an amazing week. I'm going to the basketball game tonight and then I do a run a theaters. I'm in Athens, Georgia on Tuesday. I'm an Alabama, which Georgia actually looks down on, which is fucking hilarious. If you're not from this region, you know, it's like you fuckers are all the same to me. You know? And I don't mean that in a bad way, but I don't mean it in a good way either.

Speaker 1:          00:19:59       Um, Alabama at the star Dome on Wednesday and then Thursday I'm over in South Carolina, South Caca Lackey and then, uh, no, Tuesday, Athens, Wednesday star Dome, Thursday South Carolina. And then Friday I got two shows in Atlanta and then Saturday I go to the masters. You see that people, you too can live the dream when you never get married and don't have any kids. You can live selfishly like I do, you know, and go to all these wonderful things and brag about her on your own podcast and then go to bed at night and cry yourself to sleep. What the fuck? I keep hitting this goddamn thing and this fucking chair, it's driving me nuts. You know what? You know what? It's almost like the chair knows my ego's completely out of control. Just keeps it live.

I'm going to hook you guys up with a youtube video and I know what already has 40 something million hits and people will be like, wait to be on new gut nudge. Oh Youtube for all you dumb fucks out there. 40 million hits, 40 million people is not even 1% of the world population. Okay. So any sort of of recommendation for a goddamn video is fine. All right. It go fuck yourselves. Hey, what do you guys think is worse? Uh, the, the, the, um, Atlanta Braves fans doing that Tomahawk Chop or red sox fans singing. Sweet Caroline.

Speaker 1:          00:25:16       I'll let you think it over. I have to be honest with you just because it's offending of fucking group of people that were victims of genocide. I got to go with Tomahawk Chop, but I have to say, um, sweet Caroline is a close second. I mean, that's literally stopped me from watching fucking home games at the Boston Red Sox, that and the whole steroid era. I stopped watching it. 2010, you know, once like fucking half the red sox tested positive. Was it really half bill or was it two or three key guys? Two or three key guys, you know, and one guy, oh think escape town via Chicago for never fucking got caught for anything. Um, that's just, you know, just speculation. Pure speculation people. But, um, yeah, so I was kind of at that point I was like, all right, they either need to make steroids legal or get it out of the game because I'm sick of getting excited about shit.

Speaker 1:          00:26:09       And then, uh, four years later you're telling me that it doesn't really count. You know, I don't fucking know. Um, this is how long it's been since I've watched the red sox game. I'm looking at the USA Today sports page and it's got a picture of a Boston red sock who I don't even recognize and it said Middlebrooks shows clout with three home run day. Evidently there's a guy in the red sox called will Middlebrooks who was four for five with three home runs in four rbis Sunday and he's batting three 20 for the season. I have that guy could fucking,

Speaker 2:          00:26:44       yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:26:45       you can be sitting down next to me in a fucking restaurant. I'd have no idea who he was. I'd be like, who's that really in shape? Tire salesman. He's not a tire sales me. Why that stats fucking will Middlebrooks

Speaker 2:          00:26:58       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:26:58       Middlebrooks it's not Middlebrook Middle Brooks.

Speaker 2:          00:27:04       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:27:04       The Middlebrooks the middle. Brock's family. Everybody. Subsequently we got a guy named will Middlebrooks. I'll tell you right now if y'all, you know I gotta tell Ya from the Yankees right now, I gotta be worried about that will Middlebrooks.

Speaker 2:          00:27:18       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:27:20       I don't even know what's, I have no idea what's going well, what is going on in baseball right now? I, they finally done building all new stadiums and sing a dumb ass fucking songs. Just make the roids legal.

Speaker 2:          00:27:32       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:27:35       Just let everybody take them and then it'll, it'll be all right. And then we'll all take them. Everybody takes them. Everybody's jacked. Everybody's got a short fucking temper, you know? I guess that would suck, but no, you don't do really get that anymore. Well, Bill, who knows you. It's not like you fucking read about it.

Speaker 2:          00:27:57       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:27:58       Let's get it. Let's talk about a sports that maybe I know a little bit about. Let's talk about hockey. I'm telling you fucking cunts right now who roll your eyes at hockey. First of all, if you don't want to be a fat fuck, take up the game of hockey. It's the, it's I'm telling you, I've seen, I say this weekend and week out, it is the greatest old man's sport. There is all these fucking old white dudes go out there and they still playing fucking hoop. What happens? They come in Monday, they blew out the fucking Achilles, you know, constantly fucking up your knees, your hips, your feet, cause you'll run it up the court. Right? And you got on your fucking Steve Jobs, new balance. You know that the, the, the official old white guy sneakers, which I just bought a new pair of them with the inserts. That's when you know, you're old. I'm constantly getting fucking hurt, right?

Speaker 2:          00:28:49       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:28:50       Baseball. Nobody plays baseball. You play softball and that's just really an excuse to get absolutely fucking hammered and eat hot dogs. You actually softball leagues, you actually fucking gain weight playing the fucking game. So that's no good. Now you're walking around with this big fucking gut, you know, with your coaching shorts, one size fits all. You look like you're in your third trimester, that's fucking out. You sure as hell not going to play football and any sort of capacity. And that leaves hockey. Hockey is great because you're running around, but she had gliding, you know,

Speaker 2:          00:29:22       I'm telling you,

Speaker 1:          00:29:24       you fucking workup and unbelievable sweat. It's great hand eye coordination and uh, I'm completely 100% so I don't even go to the fucking gym anymore. I just go out and I get involved in a pickup game. I'm actually to the point, I'm at the upper level of sucking. I can actually stick in a little bit and keep my head up before somebody takes the puck away from me. But I'm getting a good sweat and it's a beautiful game. Um, you know, it's funny they have all these different drills and I've been skating with this, a comic on Nick Craig, who I fucking brought out on tour when we went through a Wisconsin in fucking Michigan and he was showing me a couple of drills. You went to one of these stick time things and it's just, there's no hockey drill that is an absolutely fucking exhausting.

Speaker 1:          00:30:15       Every fucking one of them. It's like you do three reps of it and you, you feel like you're going to absolutely, you're going to die. You know, you ever see baseball players before fucking game, just sort of limbering up, you know, just tossing the ball, flicking the wrist. That's a fucking sport you want to play, I think. But then you gotta do you gotta do it 162 fucking times. I would love to get a professional baseball player on this podcast and just talk to him about July and August and like how much, even though you're making millions of dollars, how much you want to kill yourself, how many fucking times at that point you've heard the song take me out to the ball game 125 fucking times. Jay, Mary out go though game. He just sitting there like, I'm going to fucking kill myself and you're standing out there in the Goddamn son, right? And now you got to try to figure out who this fucking guy is on the mound and what the hell he's putting on the Goddamn ball like baseball. It to me is literally, it's like going to math class every fucking day. I just, I wouldn't have the,

Speaker 1:          00:31:23       there's no fucking way I could ever get smart enough to play that game at any sort of fucking level. I just can't, like when you played football, you just fucking walk up when you just play. Right. I don't get to, I guess you have to figure out the guy across the line from you, but not to the level of that these guys have to,

Speaker 2:          00:31:44       yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:31:44       You know what I mean? Like maybe you figured the guy out for part of the game, they don't come in and you know all of a sudden bringing a fucking new cornerback out of nowhere. They do that with these hitters. All of a sudden you got a new fucking picture. What the fuck is this guy doing? What's his deal? What's his release point? Can I pick it up? It's, it's coming off his fingers. It's no fucking way. There's no fucking way. The only way I would ever make it in professional baseball is if I, if I was a really good third base coach, I really knew how to give the fucking signs. That's the only way I could ever make it. Even if I had the god given ability, I don't have the mental stamina to give a fuck. When another guy comes like, I just fucking did this. I just figured out a guy, now you're bringing in another guy. Fuck this game. Fuck this. I'm going to be an announcer.

Speaker 2:          00:32:36       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:32:36       You know, I'm going to say I stole this story from a this morning cause they didn't get to it on the, uh, the wonderful program, the, uh, the regular guys here in Atlanta, some fucking asshole spent over 200 grand on a star Trek Ray gun. All right? 200 fucking grant over 200 grand from some rare ray gun, I guess used on the Star Trek episode. And this is why I want to know how much crooked shit has the baby boom generation done that they can afford to throw their money around like that. You have watched those Barrett Jackson auctions and like a Mustang will come up. Well this is an actual be, this is the real deal. We're gonna start the bidding at honor and $80,000. Who the fuck as 180 grand to buy a Mustang? You know this sitting there fucking been on those fucking Ferrari's come up, that one from Ferris Bueller's day off comes up, but whatever. And then if they could spend like 9 million bucks on it too, right there, you should be fucking thrown in a black van and fucking take it down and underneath the Pentagon and they figured out what the fuck you did. Where did you get your money?

Speaker 2:          00:33:48       Five.

Speaker 1:          00:33:50       They probably know you, you know something. If you've got, if you have enough money, well you can blow 9 million bucks on a god Damn Ferrari that you're not even going to drive because it's worth so much fucking money. Your wife doesn't give you shit at that point. You Ha, you know people at the Pentagon, right? You walk into the Federal Reserve and they shout out your name, like your fucking norm on cheers. That's all I think of when I watched those auctions. I'm like, this is all filthy fucking money. Nobody has this kind of money.

Speaker 2:          00:34:21       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:34:21       Barrett Jackson. Do you have see a rod there? A Rod doesn't even have that kind of money.

Speaker 2:          00:34:26       Yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:34:26       a Rod. My favorite Yankee of all fucking time. I Dunno. But any other red sox fans? I'm sort of a former red sox fan. I think eventually they'll get back into him. I kind of like last year where they sucked in everybody, you know, just kind of burn off all the pink hats, you know? But now, like I said, good. So everybody's jumping back on the bandwagon. I've got to figure out when's a good time to jump back in with those guys, you know?

Speaker 2:          00:34:52       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:34:55       Anyways, you know what? I'd probably do it this year. At this point. It makes me feel bad as a fan that I don't know who fucking or will Middlebrooks or did you just get the new will? Middlebrooks Jersey. I have no fucking idea who he is. This is terrible. Um, anyways, what the fuck was I just talking about? Just talking about no one people in the Pentagon. Oh my favorite Yankee ball time. Alex Rodrigues watching the Yankees, trying to shame a rod into demanding a trade has been one [inaudible] and him not taking the bait, you know, sending him in the ninth inning of the playoffs and he just stills just like, ah, you know, we want whatever's good for the tape. Hey, New York Yankees, front office, just settle in. You're going to have to pay him every fucking dime. I bet that they have his contract out on the dare fucking giant walnut tables. Every fuck is walnut expensive? I Dunno. Every God Damn Day just pouring, they probably have a team of lawyers just, just specifically designed to pour over that guy's contract to try and figure out how the fuck they can get out of this. I swear to God, if a rod was abroad and fucking the Yankees, what we're, we're, we're a, we're his husband.

Speaker 1:          00:36:17       All right. This story where to already been on the first 48 because a rod woulda got whacked. That's Desta type of financial fucking situation there. You know, when the guy just is like, there's no way out of this. I just have to kill her, you know, which is always the dumbest fucking move ever. You know what I mean? You, you're gonna, you're gonna go to hell forever. If that Shit's true, sons got to happen. Something has to happen, I think, you know what I mean? Cause some people get away with murder so there has to be some sort of fucking something. Right.

Speaker 2:          00:36:48       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:36:48       In another world or do they just put that in your head? Because if there really was no ramifications, they didn't make that shit up that people would just be walking around killing people.

Speaker 2:          00:37:00       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:37:01       Can you imagine if you just had no fucking conscience that you just did that? Anybody who is just annoying you, you just fucking killed them and you were so good at it, you never got caught, you know, with that. Could you still enjoy life? I guess if you don't have a conscience? I'm trying to think how many people I would actually like. Seriously what a killed. I don't think I ever would have killed anybody. It's an interesting question. Nah, I don't think I could.

Speaker 1:          00:37:41       Oh, but there's been a few I'd want it to. All right, let's give us the questions this week before I fucking start incriminating myself. Um, when it rains, it pours a redheaded bass did. So I know this is going to be a horrible email, but I listened to your podcast every fucking Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, or whenever you get it up here were you guys stopped saying fucking Wednesday. It's not even Tuesday. It's late Monday. You fucking wine and [inaudible] for the last fucking time. I take it Monday morning my time. It's not about you. It's about me. So go fuck yourselves fucking bitch in about a free God damn podcast, you guys. The Internet is a bunch of whiny cunts. Whiny on original content, by the way. All right, you people out there, you got to set up. You gotta fucking step up your Twitter game. Stop using StockX fucking lines. I want the last three minutes, 28 seconds of my life back. It's just like, isn't that the most unoriginal fucking thing ever? I just threw up in my mouth a little bit. Like you've read that a million fucking times on, on fucking Twitter and you're gonna write it again. Let it like you're going to get a laugh.

Speaker 1:          00:38:56       Get Out. Has anybody ever come up to you, told you a fucking street joke and then right after that told it the you again now because it's only funny once, but you fucking Twitter hacks the same. Fuck that feeling when, wait, what? That's like the fucking hacky tag.

Speaker 2:          00:39:18       Yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:39:19       same fucking people will then bitch that there's no fucking original TV shit out there. And then that just sees unoriginal conch and you know, it's funny, they're all, they're just repeating shit that they've heard and then they're all laughing their fucking asses off at their own shit. It's fucking annoying. Oh, I forgot to bring up the hockey thing while I was going to say, uh, you know what's killing me right now is I think because of the injuries that the penguins have and the fact that the fucking Bruins can't score more than two goals a fucking game. I actually think that the Canadians or the team to beat right now in the east, and it fucking kills me that those cons are looking like they actually have a shot at winning a cup this year because there's nothing I enjoy more than the fact that the Montreal Canadians are just not a factor anymore, but they're never going to be a factor ever again. You know, the way that they were. I mean, it's a fucking 30 team league now, you know, I mean, dominating a fucking six team league.

Speaker 1:          00:40:15       It's, it's really, it's really the of all like, you know, they look back at the Yankee Dynasty, the Celtics, the fucking packers and Steelers, and then the Canadians. The Canadians is the most, that one has the most fucking holes in it. You know what I mean? You dominated a 16 fucking Lee had to beat five other fucking teams. Okay. Four of which were in the United States of America. A country that could give a flying fuck about hockey. Nobody wanted it to be the next rocket Ryszard down here. They wanted to be the next Mickey Mantle. Nobody gave a fuck. So four out of the five teams, all you had to be Pete was the maple leafs. And in fact, up until 1967 as far as Stanley cups went, it, uh, the Canadians and the maple leaf for going blow for blow. They didn't want the, this is, this is how much hockey didn't mean shit in this country.

Speaker 1:          00:41:04       I saw a story one time on, um, on the NHL channel, the radio morning radio program where they were talking about how the rangers finally made it to the Stanley Cup finals and Madison Square Gardens. So didn't give a fuck about hockey every year they booked the circus in Madison Square Garden during the time when the Stanley Cup finals was. So the fucking rangers make it and they're like, fuck you, we already have the circus. And they're like, but wait a minute, we're in the Stanley Cup. And they go, yeah, but we got elephants. Go Fuck Yourself. So the Rangers had to play their home games. They put them in Toronto because they were playing Detroit and they figured to, Toronto was the closest, you know, I guess, I dunno to fucking Detroit. So maybe you'd get some Toronto fans and hated Detroit. I Dunno why they just didn't send them to Chicago. Who the fuck knows? But that's, that's, that's how much hockey meant, you know, so that's what I'm saying.

Speaker 1:          00:41:56       I look at that dynasty like it's fucking bullshit. Not Bullshit. I respect it, but it's kind of like, you know. Okay. Five other fucking teams. Wow. Did you go on a run? That's amazing. You had a one in five fucking chance of winning it. How did you do it? Um, so my name's bill. Hey, you read it at best, so I know. Blah, blah, blah, blah. Anyways, um, I've been riding on a high point for the first time this month and I wanted to get your opinion on this matter. I was on a low point when it came to the ladies and I couldn't bag a 300 pound baldy for the life of me.

Speaker 2:          00:42:35       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:42:35       Uh, baldy you're talking about a woman here. Same with a fatty, with a shade putsy what are you talking about? All of a sudden I've been landing every hot broad I've been interested in for the last past six months and I just don't fucking get it. Well, don't, don't overthink it. It's like golf. Don't get your head just fucking swing away. Um, how does it work that nothing about me has really changed besides I bought a new shirt and maybe did a few more pull ups the normal, but it just seems like when it's raining, it's pouring pussy. The women's smell it on you or what? I'm not exaggerating this man. I've landed two of the hottest girls I've ever met in my entire life this past two weeks. I just wanted to ask the age old question, why in the fuck does this all happen at once?

Speaker 1:          00:43:19       Why can't life space this out? So I can ride the wave for a year or two and be happy instead of having it all happen at once and life sucks eight out of 12 months of the year. Um, because getting pussies, it's like playing golf. It's a fucking mental game. All right, and if you have a bad shot, you got to block the last one out. It's like a relief pitcher. He let up a home run. Fuck it. Give me another ball and you just block. You got to block it out. But what happens is, is you know, you start to feel like you're in a slump and then you get desperate and fucking women just stay, smell it on you. You come in in there, you know you're trying too hard extra splash, a cologne, you're, you're fucking, you're right in their grill. Like Louisville full court fucking press your write up on that fucking pussy and then that's it. It's over. They get all nervous and they pick up the ball and they go home.

Speaker 2:          00:44:09       You know,

Speaker 1:          00:44:11       you can't give a fuck the only, I've only golf a few times, but like I don't keep score. I refuse to give a shit about that sport and I have a great time and everybody else's fucking throwing their clubs and getting all pissed off. I don't give a fuck. I'm having a great time. You know what? I'm going for the hall. I'm going for the pin,

Speaker 2:          00:44:30       you know, I fucking

Speaker 1:          00:44:32       miss and I suck, but I'm having a good time. That's all you gotta do. You gotta go Phil Mickelson on these bitches. All right. They'll fucking trying to plot and get par. Go for the Birdie. You don't want, if you miss it, who gives a fuck? You got to stay in that zone and not giving a shit, sir. And even then you still going to, there's going to be feet, feast or famine. That's it's just how it is. If I knew the answer to that, you know, I would have done much better in my, uh, my pathetic trying to get some career. Um, all right. Book of job.

Speaker 2:          00:45:07       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:45:08       God is the glory of Vegas. Okay. Hey, hey belt. Listening to the podcast and religious, the religious douche giving his douchey impression of the story of Joe pissed me off. First of all, the phrase he got.

Speaker 2:          00:45:24       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:45:24       Jobbed is actually derived from the story of job. Oh, we just pronounce it right. Is it, is it job or jobs?

Speaker 1:          00:45:35       I don't fucking know. Here's why. First of all, Christians condemned gambling and yet hold bingo parties in the church parlors every week. But the book of job actually reveals that God, God is all for gambling because not only did God make the very first way, Joe God was also the first pit boss and heaven was the first casino. I like where this guy's going. Um, the Bible story is that job was so devastated to devote it to God. Sorry that there was no way he would ever curse God's name. The devil went to heaven and said to God, uh, no shitty won't curse you. He's rich as fuck. He's got a hot wife. Seven, no non gay sons and three great looking daughters. Who Will, who don't date? Give me five minutes with that piece of shit and I'll get him to curse you upside down till next Tuesday. And God said, uh, yeah, you want to make no fucking way, Jeff.

Speaker 2:          00:46:33       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:46:33       See God, new job. God made job. God knew 100% for certain that he would win this, this bet. Uh, Bingo. God is now the first casino boss because God has an inside knowledge of the game. God even gave the devil the odds. So they shook on it and the devil goes out fucking over, job's something fierce, raped and killed his kids. Holy. She kids raped and killed his kids, really burned all his house and crops, killed all his livestock. But the worst, the devil essentially gave Joe Herpes, but not just to job's wife. Ah, what the fuck to herpes, but not to job's wife. Try explain that to your wife without at least cursing God a little under your breath. But Joe never caved, so God won the bet. Of course, God won. It's God. God did give Joe Ball his stuff back, but now, but how stupid was the devil dead? He bet against God.

Speaker 2:          00:47:33       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:47:34       The same as all of us when we go to Vegas and come out saying, I got jobbed. Ah, Jesus Christ. That was so fucking clever. It made my fucking head burst. I think you're absolutely right, but I, I just, I got halfway through that story and it's like there's no way that someone wouldn't, wouldn't freak the fuck out rate is fucking kids. Why is the Bible's is so fucking violent like that.

Speaker 2:          00:48:00       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:48:00       And you just have to sit there and unlike, you know why? Because they want you to be just completely 100% devoted to the bullshit that they're giving you. That the invisible guys saying their version of what the invisible guys saying to the point that someone can come and rape your kids, burned down your houses and your crops kill all your livestock. And at no point you're not supposed to be like God data at any point in that's supposed to fucking say that.

Speaker 2:          00:48:30       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:48:30       And if you don't, God's going to give you everything back. He isn't horrible shit happen to people's families like that and the [inaudible] and God doesn't come back and make it fucking better, but fucking idiots. We'll, we'll go to church and they'll hear that fucking story and they will believe it. Sorry. So you mean you made a great but it almost seemed like a very common one s kind of bit there. Um,

Speaker 2:          00:48:51       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:48:52       Sorry. It's just my fucking opinion on a organized religion. I get a little flustered. I get a little hot under the collar, um, law school or bust. Hey bill loved the podcast. Nobody really [inaudible] so my question has to do with the law school. Um,

Speaker 2:          00:49:07       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:49:08       Oh with law school, my brain is not fucking working today. I'm going to be done my first year of law school in three weeks and I hated it. I have never found anything I like to do in my life other than you. The usual under achievable things like my love for hockey and football. I hate every job I've ever had and I thought law school might be the answer but it's not well but it's not bed. I cannot stand law school and I cannot stand the thought of the career in law. These professors always talk about all the rules, all the restrictions, all the dealing face to face with people's problems. It sounds exhausting. It sounds not fun at all. And I have zero enjoyment from it.

Speaker 1:          00:49:49       I already know the answer to your problems here, sir. Or at least I feel I do. Uh, you said, my question is this, my friends and family all say this is just part of life. Nobody loves their job, nobody likes school, et Cetera. But I see these people who love their jobs. I see people in my class that loved their law school stuff. I don't know whether I should stick it out in school and just pray it grows on me. The debts from law school are insane. Um, hope it grows on me like everyone says it might. Or should I take the plunge and change direction completely. Completely look for something else that pulls my excitement. I do not know what to do and it weighs on me daily. Thanks. And go fuck yourself, dude. You're ignoring your inner voice, which is saying, I don't like this shit.

Speaker 1:          00:50:33       Okay. And what you're going to, but it's a safe way to go. You get a law degree, you get, you become a partner, right? And all of a sudden you make money and you fucking hate your life. And you know what, you're going to bring that home to your wife and your kids and you're going to be an asshole husband and father and because you hate your fucking job. All right? Or You could possibly do that. Who knows? You could come home and just fucking leave it at the front door. Look too. All right. You said you have a love for hockey and football. Do you know how many fucking jobs there are?

Speaker 2:          00:51:05       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:51:05       Why don't you go into that?

Speaker 1:          00:51:08       You know, if you're going to stick with law school, I become a sports agent so you at least around it. But, um, if I was into hockey or football, I don't know. I would, I would try to get into broadcast and get into journalism. Um, maybe become a sports trainer or something. There's all kinds of jobs at the cup. Highschool where can weigh up to college and all that type of shit. You know, I would go that route. If you like sports and you're into that, you know that this, this philosophy by a lot of people who don't go after their fucking dreams, that if you, if you, that those aren't real jobs. Like getting an in, in any sort of entertainment or having any sort of any exciting fucking job. Like it'd be, I don't know, be one of those, those Whitewater rafting guides, those fucking people you know, who get all kinds of fucking pussy because he got these people who this is their one week vacation from the job they hate and they see this person who is totally free love and life, you know, women.

Speaker 1:          00:52:06       Oh my God, that looks, that looks fun. I needed inside me. Right? We've seen they're getting banged up against some rock right next to the cores fucking factory. Um, that's what I would do, sir. You sign absolutely fucking miserable. It seems like you love hockey and football. So I would try and find a job in hockey and football and I know that sounds fucking insane, but you know, so was telling jokes for a living. I wasn't the funniest guy in high school. I was funny, but I wasn't the funniest. I just went to a fucking open mic and I turned everything that I used to get in trouble for until now I make money and now I'm here in Atlanta two feet from a fucking airport, breathing in jet fuel, going to go to the NCAA championship game. Cause I tell jokes for fucking living. You too sir, can live your dream. If a dumb fuck like me could do it, you can do it too. It sounds like you absolutely fucking hate being in being in law school. All right.

Speaker 2:          00:53:02       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:53:03       It's going to be terrible dude. Then you become a lawyer and then because you hate it, you're going to be looking for a big score. You know when you get to do some, you know, some sort, some sort of corruptible fucking thing to get your fucking money so you can parachute your way out of there. You can be sitting in you stupid office with your cufflinks. See a little tie tech just counting down the days, you know to when fucking have a vacation.

Speaker 2:          00:53:26       Dude, you're going to be a trial lawyer and somebody is freedom is going to be on the line and you're not going to have any fucking passion for, you're going to be sitting across someone going, oh my God, if I listened to listen to one more person, tell me that drugs were planted on them. I mean, I've telling you, don't fucking do it. All right? You can have a fun job and make money. It's one of the biggest fucking lies that's told by the generation. And, and you know, if your parents are fucking miserable and they hate their job, they don't know. They don't know. So that's telling you what they know that you know what? Life's tough. And you go and you'll sit there and you hit the books. You have this fucking miserable fucking existence. You don't have to do it.

Speaker 1:          00:54:05       Look at all these fucking people writing blogs. He's fucking people out there who like they're into food. I'm a foodie and they go around and Oh my God, the apple had a so much sediment on it and they take pictures of it. It makes me know they've got an advertising and then making money sitting there in the fucking pajamas, eating fruit loops, reviewing it, making money. You can't make money in fucking hockey and football. I, you're, you're out of your fucking mind, sir.

Speaker 2:          00:54:32       Yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:54:33       I felt the weight of your fucking life reading that thing. All right. So please, for the love of God, for all the innocent men that you're going to defend halfheartedly in the future, please tap out of that fucking industry and go someplace that you give a fuck. All right? And that's it, sir. And you know what? That's one to grow on a meet and greets. Hey Bill, I'm curious what you think about the meet and greet, taking pictures, et Cetera, with people who attend your shows. Is it completely awkward? I fucking hate that word. Stop using that word. Such a fucking overly used God damn word and the whole fucking generation, the sun is shining awkward, laughing my ass off, shaking my head, tweet. Um, do you enjoy it? Is it nice to hear people tell you how funny you are or does it just become ridiculous? I see pictures that fans take with artists. And I always wonder if the artists are thinking, kill me now or if they appreciate someone wanting to take a picture with them in that setting, have a great day and go fuck yourself. Um, the meet and greet is like doing a whole other show. If you're tired, it's a fucking pain in the ass. Um, but you know, if you go out there, you, you,

Speaker 1:          00:55:46       you know, you put a fucking smile on your face and you take pictures with people. Um, it's really what it is. What makes it exhausting is, is 15% of the people, 85% of fucking cool. It's the 15% that are fucking hammered and, uh, this slapping you on the back and if or they've got their fucking sweaty, there's a bunch of like, you know, I understand why, how he Mendell does the fist bump. But, um, generally speaking, you know, I like going out there. I like going out there and having people say, Hey, you know, I had a bad day and listen to the podcast. And I've had people come up to me and say, you know, their mom has cancer and like, she watched all three of your specials and, and you know, it put a smile on her face. I mean, that, that's like, that's worth going out there and dealing with, you know, when, you know, one of my pet peeves is when somebody is much taller than me as a guy and they put their arm around me and they're sweaty. Fucking warm armpit is resting on one of my shoulders. I fucking hate that. All right. But, you know, it makes it worth it when you hear stories like that or you got, you know, people who are going off to war or came back or whatever, and they say they listen to you a joke. So it's, there's always, there's always a couple of cool conversations that, uh, that makes it worth it. Um, what makes it annoying is when people don't have their cell phones ready or they hand them to somebody

Speaker 1:          00:57:10       they don't even know, and then they don't know how to use the phone. And then they get upset because this complete stranger doesn't know how to use this phone. That's not even theirs. And, um, at that point, you already have your arms around these complete strangers and then that gets a little weird. Uh, but you know, it's a part of it, you know, you don't like fucking doing that, then, uh, you know, don't, don't, uh, don't jump on stage. You know, it's how I look at it. I mean, sometimes I don't go out there. If I'm fucking exhausted and I feel like I'm getting sick, I won't go out there because, you know, I'm going to go out to a shaken all these fucking hands and I'm getting everybody's germs all over me. Then I'm going to get sick and then my next show is going to suck because I'm going to be sick. And it's, you know, I had, that's the, my first obligation is you paid a ticket to see me. Give you a great fucking show. And if I don't do that,

Speaker 2:          00:57:59       mmm.

Speaker 1:          00:58:01       You know, what's the point? All right. So there you go. All right. Single man advice. Oh, I'll still, but I gotta be honest with you too. Um, when I first used to go out there, you mean it's a skill to know how to actually talk and interact. It's like a whole new skill you have to learn. So, um, I wasn't good at it at first.

Speaker 2:          00:58:20       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:58:21       I just be like, hey, how are you? Did you like the show? You know, I was really bad at it and um, through launching certain people who are just naturally good at it, like I always thought Dane was really good at it. Um,

Speaker 2:          00:58:36       yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:58:36       Kevin Hart, I thought it was really just naturally good at it and I would just kind of watch how they interacted with people and uh,

Speaker 2:          00:58:43       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:58:44       Tried to use that as a,

Speaker 1:          00:58:47       I don't know, it was a guideline on how to fucking do it, you know? So anyways, but I have to admit like it, people never used to do that. Like the, the, the interaction that you guys have now with, with people that you see it shows is fucking insane. You know, I went to, I went to a no doubt concert and she was like taking pictures, like grabbing people's cell phones and taking like fucking selfies, I guess is what they call them with people in the fucking crowd. And I actually found that annoying. It's like I came here to see you guys. All right. You know, I know now you have to kiss the crowds ass to like some fucking unbelievable level. But I just think it like knocks down. It's like you're a fucking rock star. Be a rock star. You should be that accessible. You know? I don't fucking know what, whatever. Here we go. Single man advice. Hi Bill. Uh, okay. Me Just Bill. Maybe a little more than that. No, just bill. I'm keeping the intro simple. I'm single and need advice. I don't know what soup to choose. I'm really fond of clam chowder or these euphemisms for different kinds of women. Really Fun of Clam Chowder, right? So you're like a pasty redhead, but know that chicken noodle soup would be better.

Speaker 1:          01:00:01       Paint the picture of the classic bachelor role. What?

Speaker 2:          01:00:06       Okay,

Speaker 1:          01:00:06       you guys, why do you guys leave out like four words in a row and just make me sound even dumber than I am.

Speaker 2:          01:00:12       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:00:12       Which soup would look better spilled on the plain white t shirt also. I just cleaned my apartment after letting the dust build for a while. Is this a problem? Thanks for the advice. Thanks for any advice. It worked. Single man advice I've do. I really have to answer this fucking thing, which we'll look to. Clam chowder is like Crustacean Jizz Clam Chowder is fucking disgusting. It's fucking gross. It's like lobster puke. Ah, it's just warm at that chunks is shit. Now all the women are turning this up, but it's fucked. Clam chowder is, it's octopus Jizz. Okay. An octopus that's taking Propecia and is having a reaction to it and that's what those jumps are. Um, chicken noodle soup. Come on, man. That's hard. That's good stuff. That broth is barely going to show up. They would, if you fucking, you know, if yeah, you get clam chowder on your tee shirt, people are going to think you took a fucking hot one to the face. Dribbled off you'd goddamned Chin. Wow. Disgusting Lobster Puke,

Speaker 1:          01:01:21       Octopus, ges, and then a fucking male on male facial to end the fucking podcast. How do you like that up right there. Fucking two point minus two points. So the desk mount, um, I think that that is, I mean we are we going to end with that? Let's type some of my shows here. Everybody. Um, oh by the way, by the way, I almost forgot to bring up the hard copy version of you. People are all the same for all the old school media consumption, summers, whatever the fuck you say out there. If you're old school like me and if you really like something, you just don't want to download it. I don't like doing that cause I, I, if I can't fucking hold on to it, you know, it's in the air man. I don't fucking like that stuff where you know, it's on my iTunes and it's in, it's in, it's on my fucking, uh, my phone or my iPod or whatever.

Speaker 1:          01:02:15       I don't like that shit because of those things all die back in the day when you stereo died, you didn't lose your whole record collection too. So I am a big fan if you like to have, it's like having the gold behind you money. All right. If you'd like a hard copy version, either come out and see me live or a buy one off of the website. It's right underneath where, uh, you can either download it for five bucks for the kids, that's the snowboarders. And if you still ski, if you're old school and you want the hard copy, it's available bill bird.com right on the merchant page. And uh, slowly but surely I am working on some podcasts, tee shirts. Um, and that is it. That's the podcast for this week. Let's, uh, let's quickly go to [inaudible] dot com here. Who Do you guys liking the game tonight? Hodie alike. I have family from the Midwest, some kind of pulling from Michigan, but you know, Louisville has got the whole broken leg story. So I don't know who to vote for here, who to root for. But, um, I have to tell you that, that Michigan seems to win on talent.

Speaker 1:          01:03:22       You know, like, I kind of fucked they beat Syracuse was beyond me because Syracuse had this insane fucking zone defense and they will all the way out by the three point line. So immediately I'm thinking, what? Just fucking fast break. Don't let him get set up. Don't let the ball touch the fucking court. Do some Magic Johnson, showtime, Lakers Shit. Get it up there and get some easy fucking layups and make them adjust to your fucking game. And they didn't, they would just dribble it up the court and let these fucking guys get set up.

Speaker 2:          01:03:52       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:03:52       They couldn't beat the double team. Like, I feel like Michigan is getting, like, because they're so young, they just kids, I really feel that they're just kind of getting away on raw talent and now they're going up against Rick Pitino

Speaker 1:          01:04:06       who's just a monster coach. Um, I think Louisville is going to take it. That's what I think. But my hat, I'll be rooting for Michigan hail to the victors value in, you know, I also like Ohio. Hi. Oh state. That's because I come from Massachusetts. We don't really have any pro shit other than Doug Flutie fucking stupid share went down again. Fucking con. All right, so this is the deal. I'm going to be at the Georgia theater in Athens, Georgia.
