Speaker 1:          00:00:02       Hey, what's going on? It's bill burr and it's time for the Thursday afternoon. Just before Friday. Monday morning podcast. Just checking. I'm just checking in on you. Seeing how you're doing. How are you today? Huh? Are you upset? Thursday afternoon, the Thursday night football. What happened? What happened during the song this time that made people upset and decided that they were going to get all up in arms about their corner of the fucking world.

Speaker 1:          00:00:36       Unbelievable. I'm so fucking an hour. I'm going to be the guy talking. I'm so fucking listening to people making that thing about what they want it to be about. It's like, that's not what the initial protest was about. If you would like to discuss police brutality are more than willing to listen to what, I don't want to hear your fucking Soliloquy. You know all those people who are like, you know, want to be the revenue. Like I don't even care. I don't even he, yeah, of course you don't care. It doesn't fuck what they talking about doesn't affect you. It's not about you. Okay. But gives a fuck. It's one

Speaker 1:          00:01:13       moment at the beginning of the game commenting on something that people are trying to fix. That's all. That's all my biggest complaint about tonight's game between the bears and the fucking pack is they stop the game because there's potential of lightning God for fucking bed. Somebody gets electrocuted. It's unbelievable. It's unbelievable how important human being still consider other human beings. I just don't have it. It really isn't about that. It's like full. Do you think the NFL gives a fuck about you? They don't. They don't give a shit about you. They don't want you to get electrocuted because then you can't go out and buy another jersey or another ticket or NFL Sunday ticket. That's what they care about and some are, they're going to get blamed, right, because everybody in the crowd is going to be like, well, they should've known that God was going to do that.

Speaker 2:          00:02:13       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:02:14       You should have known what the weather was going to be. You know? There's no more, Hey, Fucko, you went outside, you know what's outside lightning and you went outside and God dammit lightening found you and that's your own dumb luck. Guess what? You can have your own Wikipedia page now. You don't have one now. Nobody knows who the fuck you are, but you get struck by lightening.

Speaker 2:          00:02:38       Okay,

Speaker 1:          00:02:39       Jami is going to find you on Wikipedia. Maybe you won't get your own page. You might be on a page. That's just the list of people struck by lightning in 2017 or in or in whatever the fuck we're calling this decade. It has to be an extraordinary circumstance to when you get struck by lightening, for you to get your own Wikipedia page, you'd have to get struck by lightening and then something else happens. He struck by lightning. You catch on fire and you run into a paper machine factory. All right? With a bunch of children there, hose make a wish was that they could go to or make our fucking paper machine a factory. Then you run in there and and then it all goes up and all those little kids died. Then now they need to have to share it with the kids. It's a tough thing.

Speaker 1:          00:03:23       It's hard to get struck by lightning and get your own Wikipedia page, you know? You know what's funny is if that actually happened, you got struck by lightning. You had a nice afro going, you catches on fire, you run into a paper, Ms Shea factory, there was a bunch of, make a wish kids in there and then they all fucking died. The funniest fucking thing about all of that is how much shit your relatives would get. You know what I mean? Saying Ah, you know that gag guy, he's one of those Wilson kids. Yeah. You know, his fucking brother gets struck by lightning instead of just die and laying there burning the fucking asshole content. He has runs into a paper machine factory and kills a bunch of kids that were already dying anyways.

Speaker 3:          00:04:06       You know,

Speaker 1:          00:04:09       then everybody treats them like shit. Like you can keep your wits about you when your head's on fire. The bottom line is, is uh, I don't know what happened to football. I don't ever remember it being stopped because of weather used to be, they play in all kinds of weather. Right. And you had the ice bowl up there in green bay. You had that game when all the locust to send it down on the Kansas city chiefs when they played the fucking uh, New York titans. I'm just making up shit at this point. I don't know what happened to the game, but now any time there's going to be a little bit of crosswind, what if it blows somebody's sunglasses off and goes into somebody's eye? I mean Jesus Christ, those, those people that, that's what's constant.

Speaker 1:          00:04:49       The amount of layers of clothes and blubber you have to go through after the lightning strikes him to even like, you know, rattle a few fillings loose of the average person in Wisconsin. These are, these are, these are wholesome people up there. Okay. They get that ll bean catalog and to those people that is formal, where do you understand that? You know, when you get married in Wisconsin, you can actually show up, you know, you know like everybody, you're going to wear tails with your Tuxedo. They ask him if they're going to wear those fucking, you know, his rubber pants. It was fucking with the suspenders. When you go trout fishing, somebody was saying there was some fucking guy, he walked out into the ocean. I don't know why the fuck he was in a river, some sort of water, a watery area, and he walked in there and this wave came in and washed into his fucking pants at telecom, tipped him over and he couldn't get up because the combination of the weight of his ass and his legs, those rubber pants and all the water in it, it just fucking a heat drought.

Speaker 1:          00:05:57       I don't know if that's true. That sounds like something a fucking old lady with Tyson. All this fucking old lady. When I was a kid, you know back when, you know parents didn't watch their kids like parenting back in the day you woke up, you gave him fucking, you know the multicolored cereal. He opened the door and they went outside and they just met other kids and with your kid brains, you figured out what you were going to do that day. Well, there was this old lady who lived around the corner and she still always tell us all these crazy fucking stories. She had terrible candy to where you'd still show up. I don't know why. And she used to be a one time now. I mean, she may know, and Jamie and we gauge guy any, he tried to stomp his foot down on the brakes to stop so he wouldn't go to their job shining.

Speaker 1:          00:06:40       She said that his leg when all the way up until his body and his, and it was like six inches shorter in front of the rest of his life. He walked around and he couldn't get him. You know, I used to come home and I'd repeat the stories to my mother. Right. I'd be like, mom, he key it. Yeah. You know, one tiny, I was a guy, his leg went, been to his body and she, one day she just finally, I think was listened to me. She just looked at me. She goes, who told you that? And I was like, oh, the lady down this cheat. She goes, don't listen to her. She's crazy. I don't know why my mother talk like that. I needed to do a different voice. She doesn't smoke.

Speaker 1:          00:07:17       I Dunno what the fuck I'm talking about. But what would you expect from someone who forgot it was Thursday. That's how awesome my life is. I forgot it was Thursday. Now sometimes you can forget it's Thursday because your life is fucking terrible, right? Your roundup, right? You're on a fucking bender or you're, you're like, I don't know what you're fucking, um, I dunno. You fucking, you're a political prisoner. You forget what date is your in Shawshank. All right. Sometimes you fight them off. Sometimes you don't. You're marking off the days he got Rita Hayworth on the wall. You don't know what fucking date is. Not even if you're Andy do frain and you're good with numbers, you lose track. And the only other people that lose track of that, of people who work for themselves, which I don't, I work for Netflix now, I guess. I don't know.

Speaker 1:          00:08:02       I just, you know, after awhile you just said, what fucking day is it? I Dunno. Another day. Living the dream day. Um, anyways. Okay. Football, Sundays coming up. What a bomb booty booty. I'm going to start doing my gambling pick of the week, my gambling pick of the week. All right. I'm guaranteeing you that if you gamble on this game, money is going to change hands either out of your pocket or into your pocket or it might be a push. I'm guaranteeing that he called me up at one 800 freckles, fat, fat, fat. Um, the giants getting three and Tampa Bay, that giants, the O in three giants. Everybody looking at him like that, washed up, forgetting that Eli Manning has won two super bowls against the reigning super bowl champions. They beat bill Bellacheck two times. Um, you guys got two rings, you know he's got, he's got two rings, he's got no respect and he's got half an offensive line, but I think this week to get in three there under dogs, they did fine. Fine against Philly last week. That came back late. But who gives a shit? They still scored 20 something points. I didn't really pay attention. Right? And then they lost on a 61 fucking year,

Speaker 3:          00:09:21       right?

Speaker 1:          00:09:24       Some fucking dude from nine oh two one o came walking in. Right. They just fucking kicked the God damn thing like the end of a Hollywood movie.

Speaker 3:          00:09:33       All right.

Speaker 1:          00:09:35       Ain't going to happen. They're going to go down to Tampa. Okay. First of all, nobody respects the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. You know why? Because they have a giant pirates of the Caribbean ship inside their stadium. I don't know what they're trying to do. I don't understand how the Oakland Raiders, okay. Who have like a pirate on the side of their helmet are able to achieve the baddest, baddest fucking uniform in all the sports. As far as I'm concerned. They, when they moved to Vegas and they have the white home jerseys, they better go back to the silver numbers or I'm or my name isn't Billy fat tits. Alright. Tampa Bay Buccaneers, I don't understand is what is a buccaneer. Exactly. Okay, let's look this up because judging by their colors, I feel like it's more like the musical theater sort of pirate. It's much more, let's just go out and have an adventure rather than raping and pillaging.

Speaker 3:          00:10:32       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:10:33       What do we got here? All right, and then fucking Buccaneers loss last week, 34 to 17 so they're coming off a big loss. That's always a concern. What the fuck is a buccaneer? Buccaneer. All right. Buccaneers were a kind.

Speaker 3:          00:10:47       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:10:49       A privater or pirate. What's a privater? Private tier.

Speaker 3:          00:10:55       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:10:55       A private tier was a private person. Also, they keep to themselves. Well, that's not really good in a team sport is it? Or a ship that engaged in maritime warfare. Okay. Under a commission of war.

Speaker 3:          00:11:09       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:11:09       All right. Well, they did it very officially. All right.

Speaker 3:          00:11:14       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:11:14       Particularly to the Caribbean Sea. Yeah. Pirates of the Caribbean. That's right. Originally the name applied to the landless hunters of wild boars and cattle, and they largely uninhabited areas of Tor, Toga and Hispaniola. The mic caught. They smoked over a slow fire. Where the fire, what are we talking about? Something about jerk me or Jerky. Why should we fear these people? Do you know what? This is just a whole bunch of reading that I don't want to do it when caught by anti pirate English authorities. Seventh all right. You know what I need to do? What's the dose screen? A pirate in a buccaneer. Oh, what's the difference? What's the difference between a or and O'quinn read

Speaker 1:          00:12:07       in a buccaneer I would say about 30 pounds, judge. I've been, well, I've never been to the Tampa stadium. Might be there in a few weeks. So, okay. Buccaneer verse rate or what's The difference? This is why you got to love the Internet. I'm not saying they have a right answer, but they always have an answer. What's the difference? A buccaneer is a synonym of radar as nouns. The difference between a buccaneer in a raider is that buccaneer is an UN is not a goal. Any of a group of semen. TJ's no. See men who cruised on their own account on the Spanish main and in the Pacific in the 17th century, similar to pirates, but did not pray on ships of their own nation while a raid is one who gauges, engages in a raid, colon, semicolon, a plunderer.

Speaker 4:          00:13:04       Okay,

Speaker 1:          00:13:05       well what the fuck is a raid and what is a plunderer? See this, this is what you do. You have fucking,

Speaker 4:          00:13:12       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:13:12       Plunderer.

Speaker 4:          00:13:16       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:13:17       The plunderer is a fictional character, so they, they don't even exist. I don't want this fucking,

Speaker 4:          00:13:23       yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:13:23       that was actually a superhero. Dare Devil fought the plover.

Speaker 4:          00:13:29       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:13:29       Plunderer come on man. Come on. Give me something. Give me something. Hey, your cons. Plunder. Wikipedia is just such a one trick pony. Sometimes they just keep guiding you back to the same fucking

Speaker 4:          00:13:42       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:13:43       To plunder the public treasury to take wrongfully as pillage. Yeah. Okay. All right. You know what? I don't even give a shit anymore. How about that? All I know is whoever fucking drew the Raiders logo did not draw the Buccaneers logo. That first one at least and less. He was a rate of fence. It was like these for these fucking guys saying that kind of like us. We already took this name. Let me see. Tampa Bay fucking ears speed. Like a porno logo. What do we got here? That's sort of a pirate. Oh, the day, you know, they kind of ripped off. They're trying to rip off the old fucking oh find to rip off the Raiders here. Well, let's see. They're fucking original. Their original logo was just like, I think it was Tom Selleck. I don't know what it was. Nah, man, I'm really Tom Selleck sort of winking at you.

Speaker 4:          00:14:40       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:14:41       Tiniest of knives in his fucking mouth. There's the one I remember right there. The creamsicle.

Speaker 4:          00:14:49       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:14:50       Yeah, I don't what that was. He looked like a three musketeer. You look like a good guy. I think that that was the problem. Was there a point to any of that? I don't think there was. Um, anyways, this is one of the, this is one of the greatest times of the year in United States sports and who's kitty? Our sports are the best. If you don't believe it, if you don't believe our athletes are the best, I'm telling you, you need to watch the Olympics. Okay. All of our white athletes dominating all of those games. Well, maybe we do. We do well in the Winter Olympics though, we now we don't, we lose to the fucking Canadians. We beat the Canadians in like the juniors. We always beat them because anybody like our age is already made it up to the fucking Nhl, you know? But you got to give those Canadian something hockey. They got [inaudible] you got to let him have hockey. Even though the Russians are kind of slowly taken away from them. A lot of European players, the game is slowly being taken away from their sticky served fingers up there. Okay. We all understand this. All right. And they're going to hang on for dear fucking life. Cause if Canada, God forbid ever was to lose hockey, what would they be left with? [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          00:16:03       what would they be left with that shuffleboard on ice that they play? What do they call it? What do they call that? Uh, what the fuck is it? And you slide. He just let that fucker go right. That big sort of a wheel, isn't it? It's a rim. Kind of looks like a rim off of a jeep that they turned into a giant hockey puck. That's what it says. An obese hockey puck. What the fuck do you call it? Curly. I don't know why they call it curly. There's no hooking. There's nothing like that, you know, fucking, I have no idea. Um, anyways, so you have playoff baseball's coming up. Who is going to start hockey's going to start college and pro football's going. The CFL is getting close to the Grey Cup. All right. I mean just what else could you want? Okay. The Formula One in Moto GP are going to be wrapping up here in the next 40 days.

Speaker 1:          00:17:01       Mrs. Exciting fucking times. Let's check out the baseball standing. Shall We? Everybody. Who Do, we got here, those Boston red sox hanging on for dear life, three games ahead of the New York, the New York Yankees. Um, Tampa Bay devil rays, soon to be Montreal Expos. Spoiler alert. Um, I've been telling you guys that story. I must have told this story at the time. I went to the Montreal Expos game by myself. I was doing this Gig in upstate New York and um, you know, I was trying to go to all the fucking stadiums. So I was like, all right, well, you know, let's see this Montreal, the end, they got a fucking game and the game the next day. So I went up, I did this Gig, I think I did the Lake Ontario playhouse. I know I've told this story before, but what maybe I've got a few listeners maybe from something from checking. Yeah. Is Listening. Maybe somebody from Romania. Um, anyways, so there was a game the next day, so I ended up trying to cross the border into Canada. Uh, this is pre nine 11, by the way, in a very weird spot by myself.

Speaker 1:          00:18:11       So I get stopped at the border and the guy tells you, guy asked me, he was like, oh, it's well, what are you doing there fella? He's Canadian dude. And I said, I'm going to an expo game now. The Expos had lost probably about, I don't know, like 120 games at that point during the season. And he goes off, you're making some friends up there. And I was like, nope. Going by myself. And he was like, Oh hey Paul, would you mind pulling over right there for a second? So he asked me, pull over and like two more of these fucking guys come out and they start ripping apart my car and they send me inside and I'm like, what? The Pfizer is some sort of random drug search and I'm just sitting there watching them and they're ripping it apart and ripping her apart. And then it suddenly fucking dawns on me like, what kind of a fucking loser?

Speaker 1:          00:19:00       I mean, I was like two hours away. It was a drive two hours out of my way to go up there to go to Montreal Expos, game by myself. This guy could not fathom that any human being, even one that looked like me would have that much of a pathetic moment in their life. He was convinced I was some sort of drug mule or whatever, I guess drug meals. It was that when you have it up your ass, but they never checked my ass. They just check the fucking car. So it suddenly dawned on me that they thought there was no way that I was that pathetic, but I knew the real answer was yes. I was apathetic. So it just struck me as funny and I started laughing and I couldn't stop. And I remember the cop looking over at me and he saw me laughing and I think he thought I was laughing, like he couldn't find the drug, so they were out there for like a fucking half hour.

Speaker 1:          00:19:49       Okay. And then once I knew that they thought I had drugs, then I was just kind of acting like a dick and I had a shitty and grin on my face as I came walking up smiling. Okay. And they will, the guy was getting mad, like I was smiling, like he didn't find it or whatever. And uh, then I went up there and went up there and this fucking French con acted like he didn't understand what I said when I asked him to take my picture because I didn't have anybody to take my picture because I was by myself and one of those disposable cameras and it just that the story just keeps getting worse and worse. Um, when I called him a conti laughed and walked away. Um, so anyways, I was sitting out in like fucking left field

Speaker 3:          00:20:27       and uh,

Speaker 1:          00:20:29       it was such an old stadium. I don't know, just under budget. I think it's socialism up there, you know, and they just don't step on the poor the way we do up here. Um, out in the outfield. Your seat only had one arm rest. That's what I remember. Even on the left or on the right, I can't remember what, and I was sitting out there and all the fans not paying attention to the game, the fans had showed up and they would just sing in Ole, Ole, Ole, Ole, that soccer fucking song. And I was watching, I swear to God, I saw this guy and I'm like, I watched this guy steal home plate and I'm way out in left field. So I jumped up. I was like, yeah, when he stole home plate and nobody else jumped up, Whitney and it was really quiet in the stadium.

Speaker 1:          00:21:08       So then I was like, oh fuck. Maybe that was something else. Maybe, I don't know. Maybe it's a pass ball. Maybe a, it was a Bach. I didn't know what. So I fucking sat back down and felt stupid cause everyone was looking at me. And then later on that night, I was back at the fucking hotel and I was watching TSN. That's their ESPN up there. And they're like, they're like, oh, it's something you don't see every day. And they showed a guy stealing home plate and I was like, fuck it. You know, that's my expo story. Matt. Riveting, but not boring. All right. Then he got the Cleveland Indians crushing it, crushing it, one 22 winters of 22 in a row. Um, I feel like they've won like maybe what, like, like 25 of they last 30, not 27. Um, they're in. And who else? The Houston Astros.

Speaker 1:          00:21:58       Ah, wow. Well, look who's finally in the American league. Finally put on your big boy pants and he gets stopped playing. Hit and run and get yourself nice and Roy it up and try to hit it over the fence. Uh, uh, the Washington senators in first place, I didn't fucking know that the cubs look into repeat the Dodgers. I went to the dodger game last night. They went fucking tend to nothing. Uh, had a great time. We sat right down on the field, like terrifyingly close, like I tried to make sure I watched every damn pitch and uh, you know, I'm not boozing. So you know, that's also scary if you booze and you know, you're all relaxed, so your heads like fucking foam rubber, you know what I mean? It's, you just bounces off at one app and whether, you know, you don't know, you order another fucking round.

Speaker 1:          00:22:49       Right. But, um, I've stone sober sitting there, so actually realize what the fuck it happened. So I was staying right on it. What a great stadium that is. Just a great stadium, great fans out there. You know what I mean? As long as you don't wear a different colored Jersey and you don't sit on the bleachers, you know what I mean? As long as you're not with your kids. Um, it's a great stadium. It's a great, so long as you rooting for the Dodgers. It's a wonderful time. And I went there. I had a pretty good time. I had a great time, I should say. I meant to say I ate pretty good eight. Pretty good. I got a little off my diet diet when I was in fucking Toronto. So I think my calf is healed up. We're going to try to hit the elliptical tomorrow.

Speaker 1:          00:23:28       Hey, guess what? Old freckles, freckles. His plane. Um, the Monte Carlo tomorrow in Las Vegas. Uh, it's going to be great. Bunch of people from F is for family are coming out or a bunch of writers are going to be at the show. So I'm hoping I'm going to have a good one. I'm very excited to play that one. That's the one from um, uh, not river Phoenix. What was the name of that fucking movie? Ocean's 13 or 1215? Whatever the fuck it was called where everybody's still all those good looking fellow. He stood out there, right? Looking at the, uh, the uh, what was it though? The fonts, the font shooting off. You guys saw them over? Yeah, that's stick to casino. I'm playing that one. I've always wanted to play that one. And we said it was the cleanest in class. He's looking one, at least from the outside you walk in and the things, they all look the same. But anyway, so let's, let's get onto the um,

Speaker 2:          00:24:17       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:24:17       It's going onto the a, what do we got here? A little bit of a advertising here. Oh, draft kings, everybody. Draftkings okay. And I said I, what did I say? Giants getting three giants getting three on three. Ready. All right. Draft Kings football season has begun. What are your political prisoners?

Speaker 6:          00:29:45       way

Speaker 1:          00:29:47       they'll Rico, those poor bastards are still without power door. You know, after you have to getting hit by that hurricane and everybody's over here talking about somebody taking a knee. I actually think taking a knee is more respectful than standing up, isn't it? Christ the guys on his fucking knees. Um, so hopefully I'll be able to do that. Hopefully people stops focusing on the song and start focusing more on the heroin epidemic, right arm on my soap box. The fact that we're feeding cows to other cows and cutting the beaks off of birds that I walked around doing face plants because their breasts are too fucking big.

Speaker 7:          00:30:26       You know,

Speaker 1:          00:30:27       he can't even give them a big to fucking land on. That's like dent. Mack said gets smart episode where they put them in the Gurney and they strapped him in and then there was only one of those fucking rotary doors and they stood him up. You ever seen that one? They push them through and he does the fucking face plant. Oh, that bit killed me. I loved it back in the day. Can you tell them a huge me TV fan? I've been taping the twilight zones over there and not only is the twilight some great. What's awesome about it is afterwards I then get to do, my favorite thing is Google to see how much of the cast is dead and I was surprised. I watched the one that was the bewitched pool and the both of the little kids is still alive. They're in their sixties the mother is still alive, still alive and kicking like 89 years old.

Speaker 1:          00:31:15       However, the dad fucking dropped like less than 10 years later in the early seventies had a heart attack. You know what I mean? That was a big thing back in the day, guys died of heart attacks in women died of accidental overdose overdoses. You know, cause anytime they got air quote hysterical, they would give them black beauties and only case a Holly itself, you know, they'd get slapped around and the doctor's office and then, you know, to make sure the swelling went down, they would give him these relax of fires for their cheeks in their, in their, in the rest of their body. Something like that. And I forget how it goes, but that's what I do. Like I watch Hawaii five o just about every night and the other night they had this episode called to hell with Babe Ruth. And that was a big rumor, right? That back in the day, back in the day when that was young, I'm not acute anymore. They used to, um,

Speaker 7:          00:32:06       hello,

Speaker 1:          00:32:09       but come on in, turn the KNOB. Oh, I thought you were coming in. So back in the day, uh Oh, it's still lovely. Nia. I can't, I can't stay though. Well, get out. Why'd you come in there? Oh yeah. What are you ordering like, um,

Speaker 7:          00:32:40       like Armenian for like, you know, Middle Eastern food,

Speaker 1:          00:32:43       lamb and rice and that sort of thing. Lamin right. All right. Well and I already ate for the evening. I and another two bullies salad with chicken. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. It's fascinating. So I'm gonna go order dinner. Hi. I haven't seen you in so long. We were supposed to have a date night tonight. Yeah. And you blew me off. Not that blew me off. I didn't blow you off. I just papa, Papa. All right. To hell with Babe Ruth. Okay. This is alleged allegedly,

Speaker 7:          00:33:18       is it over officially done?

Speaker 1:          00:33:20       Yes. You're being dismissed. You know what, Nia, you're fired. No Am I am at the end of the podcast here and I was telling them about that to hell with Babe Ruth thing. Remember the Hawaii five o I was showing you when they had the white guy playing the Japanese guy? Yes. But then the lady, he was with boost. I don't know if she was Japanese, but she was definitely Asian. Yes. And so she's got to sit there and look at him with this fucking white guy, stupid thing. And then they put this awful makeup around his eyes. This is 50 years ago.

Speaker 7:          00:33:48       Yep.

Speaker 1:          00:33:50       There you go. I don't want to say about it. I'm just bringing it up. That was terrible. Well, it's true. If it was half a century ago, and he said, come on the podcast again. Okay. No. [inaudible] dokie. So anyways, um,

Speaker 7:          00:34:06       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:34:07       Allegedly during the World War II, when the Japanese soldiers would do a bunch I charge, which just was fucking as suicidal charge I guess, or whatever. Like Japan was not fucking around. There was no quitting. Okay. There was no, everybody gets a ribbon. All right? They would just, if you fucking did, there was no surrendering to your fucking enemy. So during those Buns, I charges allegedly, I don't know if this is propaganda, they would yell either to hell with Babe Ruth or fuck babe Ruth is what they would yell. Right. So Babe Ruth got wind of it and there's a quote in the New York Times, I got to get this right. I don't want to misquote the sultan of Swat. The only man who ever had a ballpark built around it is fucking abilities. Um, let me see if I can find this. Uh, you can't. I can't find it. He basically said, he goes, any JAP that says that I hope they, I hope he get shot. He goes, and while we're at it, it goes to hell with all the jabs that was written in the New York Times.

Speaker 7:          00:35:15       You know,

Speaker 1:          00:35:17       you could never do that in 1969 by the time that episode of Hawaii five o came out, but what you could do was have a white guy with the worst makeup ever around. I'm going to fucking, I'm going to post the picture. I got to post a picture I, which I, I don't know if I'm going to do it either. I just want to make sure. Oh, I just got a picture of John Daly in a fucking, in his sweatpants

Speaker 7:          00:35:41       fucking

Speaker 1:          00:35:43       making a chocolate shake from self in a glass that had the Arkansas razorback thing on it. Is there anything about John Daly? That is an awesome

Speaker 7:          00:35:52       anything. Um,

Speaker 1:          00:35:56       so anyways, I was watching this episode and this guy, I'm watching the whole time going, that guy is not Japanese. What the fuck? I was looking, there's something wrong with his eyes or whatever. And I finally looked up the actor. I don't know what he was, he was first generation something or other, but it was not cheap. You should just see the seats face his whole face, his fucking white features. Then he had his, like, he was sort of squinting his eyes. All I was just was horrific. Felt bad for the lady across from, I can't imagine what she said when she came home and just playing. He gave the didn't even look good. So anyways, I guess what I'm saying, it's, it's about time we make a World War Two movie, you know, we actually have Japanese people play Japanese soldiers. Can we at least do that? Hasn't been done. I don't know. I watch sports, okay? And there is no fact checking whatsoever when it comes to a,

Speaker 1:          00:36:50       when it comes to this podcast, guys, I audit the greatest fucking motherfucking cock sucking fucking whiskey glass you will ever own in your fucking life and it's so awesome that I know when you see it, you're going to want it. All right? This guy's got a small operation, so I'm not going to tell you who it is until I ordered some more and get my order in and then I'm going to let you know on Monday, Monday, Monday. I can't be that much of a cunt. This is a great gift. If you have a fucking person who loves, hang on a second, loves to drink with me, and the holidays are coming up. Please tell me he says the guy's name on it.

Speaker 1:          00:37:35       Hang on a second. God dammit. I got to give you the name. Ethan, the greatest fucking whiskey glasses ever. This guy, he a and is this, does this sound right? This sounds kind of perverted. He blows his own glass. It was a bad time to pause and that how he blows his own three, two, one glass. Um, Nate Cotterman, n a t. E C o. T. T. E r m. A N Nate Cotterman Dotcom, um, can make you all kinds of things. I actually fucked up my order. I called the number up and he, the guy just picked up, he's like, hello? I'm like, ah, yes. Night there. He's, I guess. And I, I'm like, yeah, dude. I ordered the Riaa put an order for eight glasses. I ordered the wrong ones. I wanted the ones with the square cube. And he goes, Hey, I saw that. All right, I'll take care of that.

Speaker 1:          00:38:27       How'd you hear about us? I was just looking at Wiki whiskey glasses. This is what the guy does. All right, for all you guys out there and you drink the top shelf boots. All right. You're a self made man or you were born into it. Give a fuck. Right? You got you a woman in line. No. Um, and you've got to, you got to top shelf, bottle of booze and you respect the booze. He respect the artists, artists who fucking whatever the fuck did whatever he did to make it as smooth and is and is and his tasty God. This is going to make me go right off the wagon and it's tasty as it is in and you, but you want it cold, you know? So there's all these different things. There's these giant ice cubes you can put in there, these big square ones, but eventually towards the end, you know the, the water's going to start leaking into the booze. You get me talking tap water here. Okay? Like beavers, shit in this stuff it is is mixing in with your God Damn Booze. You can't have that.

Speaker 4:          00:39:28       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:39:29       The, the aroma of duck feet is, is, is coming in Dt or pristine firewater here. Right? So then they also have, they got these metal cubes or whatever, but then you know, no matter what, there's going to be some sort of metallic, maybe Blahblahblahblahblah. This guy Nate, all hail Nate, he makes a whiskey glass and then he makes a, a square glass fucking ice cube and marries that to the glow. It becomes part of the glass. Then you take the whole fucking glass, you stick it in the fridge, the freezer or whatever, and then everything's called. Okay. And then you pour it in there. Okay. The Bose has nowhere to hide. It's surrounded on all sides by nice chilled, frigid glass. But none of it leaks into the boots. So you can drink it neat and have it ice cold. You can have your fucking cake and eat it with these glasses.

Speaker 1:          00:40:23       I cannot say enough about them. I absolutely love these fucking glasses and I haven't even used them yet. They got a little way to them too. So if you, if your limp wristed and you know, if you're, you know, I don't know if you, you know, back in the day you got an old roller blading injury and you're, you're broke both your wrists. These might not be for you. Okay. But I fucking love these glasses that Janet and the coolest Shit, Nick Carter, man with a c. All right. That's it. Enjoy the music. And, uh, we've got another half hour shit coming up from a Thursday afternoon just before Monday morning podcasts and a Thursday gone by, you know, possibly earlier share. Maybe it was from a three years ago. I don't fucking know. I don't pick them. All right. Have a great weekend. I'll see you in Vegas and uh, that's it, right? Yeah.

Speaker 8:          00:41:10       Yay. Oh,

Speaker 1:          00:41:47       this way. Well, you know what, I didn't even get to the fucking, you see that reporter that died? Let me get to where the hell is that story here. This writer for rolling stone, which I have a subscription to.

Speaker 4:          00:42:13       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:42:14       One of the magazines, few magazines that I actually read every episode, every installment. Um, Michael Hastings, uh, he had a horrible death. He fucking was going down, I believe it was Highland, just south of Melrose is Mercedes was traveling at ridiculous speeds. He hit a fucking tree and the whole thing exploded, burst into flames and they had to identify him by his dental records and uh, allegedly this guy knew,

Speaker 4:          00:42:46       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:42:46       I guess he wrote some fucking article in rolling stone where he was over in Afghanistan talking to some higher ups in the military and they were saying some shit that they thought was off the record and he put it all in the article and there's people conspiracy there is trying to say that his car was cyber attacked. Now I'm not even going to get into that, but dude, how fucked up is the world getting if like that's actually something that somebody could do. I'm not saying whether it was done by this guy or not. I have no fucking idea. He might've been hammered. I have no idea. I have no fucking clue. I don't know anything about it, but I'm just saying that the fact that somebody could hack into your computer and cause your car to speed up.

Speaker 4:          00:43:37       Okay,

Speaker 1:          00:43:37       and there's nothing you can, you can't shut the car off.

Speaker 4:          00:43:41       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:43:41       This is why I don't know that I don't believe that it's just like his evil is that is we got to eliminate this guy. Isn't there a zillion other ways to kill them without doing that? Like, what if he slammed into like a fucking minivan with the F, you know, a married couple in their three, four kids.

Speaker 4:          00:44:00       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:44:01       You know, it's gotta be, you know, can't they just spray some mist on him?

Speaker 4:          00:44:06       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:44:06       You know, just walk up to them in a mall like, Hi sir, would you like to try this fragrance? You just spray it on him and then the guy like, you know, 10 minutes later and he's trying on some slacks, he just keels over. You can't just do it that way. But anyways, is this true? Is can they actually do that shit? And this makes me feel glad that you know, half my time out here, I drive around in a classic car, you know, because now like I'm many sort of a threat. But what I'm saying is if that, if I just would think if you had the ability to do that, some fucking nerds would just do it just to do it. Cause it would be funny, just speed you up for a second and slow you down just to freak you out.

Speaker 4:          00:44:47       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:44:48       You know, like, do you remember back in the day when this is like pre Internet fun? What you would do is you'd take your garage door opener.

Speaker 4:          00:44:57       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:44:57       Right. And you would drive around the neighborhood and he'd pointed at every garage until you found somebody that had the same one as you. And back in the day they just had a, like, it wasn't sophisticated. So not only yours open, not only yours, it opened the other ones too. So you'd, you'd eventually find somebody that had the same garage door brand is you and you could open and close the garage so at least you could my fucking neighborhood. So you just find, you use drive one person nuts.

Speaker 4:          00:45:31       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:45:31       You just drive by and you just fuck it. And every once in a while would just open it and it, and I don't know why we would do it. We were assholes, but so using that, if you could fucking do that, um, with cars, wouldn't, wouldn't like these people like, you know, hack into steel, like credit card numbers and shit. I mean, wouldn't that be somebody just doing that? Just to do it like you're bored.

Speaker 1:          00:45:58       It was this, the, was this the dumbest part of the podcast? Everybody did I stick the landing starting off with ignorance and then a well, why wouldn't they? Well, fuck, you know what the reality, if I ever book a commercial, I'm going to be, you know, that commercial where the adults sits there with all the kids and they go, you know, what would you, what would you do if you had a zillion dollars and then the kids that I could buy an island made out of candy. Yeah, we get, have hot fudge waterfalls and shit. I would be sitting there right with, except it wouldn't be like the basketball one way. They were like making fun of the fact, like I would be like, you don't want to say I'm saying I'm okay

Speaker 8:          00:46:35       buddy.

Speaker 1:          00:47:20       I'm all right for the birds. Hey Bill, I got these two parakeets. My problem is that these little dudes don't like me.

Speaker 9:          00:47:30       Uh, I've tried whistling, petting them. I don't know. You can pet a bird and squirting them with water.

Speaker 4:          00:47:37       Okay.

Speaker 9:          00:47:38       Uh, do they like water? I'm guessing that that's a good thing. Parakeets like water. I don't know. Why don't we ask the fucking Jimmy's guy to write a fucking nine pages on it? I love all them upset with that guy because he actually did the research as opposed to me who were like, oh yeah, I overheard this in a bar. So anyways, this guy's petting his birds. He's fucking, he getting them with the water hose. He's Westlawn Adam. Whoo. I'm all to no avail. I know they're only birds, but I feel they hold a deep resentment towards me where you clip their wings and you stuck them in a cage. How would you feel if somebody cut your fucking nuts off, came by, started whistling at you and throwing water at you?

Speaker 7:          00:48:17       You know,

Speaker 9:          00:48:19       I got an idea. Why don't you leave him alone? She opened the cage,

Speaker 7:          00:48:23       right?

Speaker 9:          00:48:24       Why don't you take them to one of those car dash? She had doctors and I get a little botox in their fucking wings and let them fly away.

Speaker 4:          00:48:31       Okay.

Speaker 9:          00:48:32       Would that be annoying to you? If you are in a cage, your arm's cut off at the FEC and elbows and somebody came up and rather than whistle and they started speaking English. Yeah. You speak in English at you. He goes, I think it's because I yelled at them. Oh, here we go. He goes, I think they resent me because I yelled at them.

Speaker 7:          00:48:51       Yeah.

Speaker 9:          00:48:51       What did you, what, what, what were they doing a, I said, no, we're fine. During my shows, uh, basically I had to scold them for pooping in their water dish, but I had their best interest in mind. So do you understand how fucking insane you are that you feel like you can talk to a bird? You know, why don't you like not stick the water dish,

Speaker 7:          00:49:18       you know,

Speaker 9:          00:49:19       underwear that that was it underneath the swing. Or what I would do is I just get a bigger cage. I get a bigger fucking cage. I put the water in the center that isn't near any of those trapeze bars and hopefully they won't be at the top of the cage is still shit down on it. Or I would accept the fact that it's a burden, a cage, and that it's, you know,

Speaker 4:          00:49:41       okay.

Speaker 9:          00:49:41       Basically anything at the bottom of the cage. Mine as well be the city of Dresden.

Speaker 7:          00:49:45       Right.

Speaker 9:          00:49:47       I would just take that as part of it. I wouldn't yell at the birds, but it was this guy. He had to scold them for pooping in their water, but I had their best interest in mind. I heard if they drink contaminated water, it can cause a disease that makes all their feathers fall off. While you could also read up on it, as opposed to me who just repeats shits that they, here he goes, I do a lot for those little guys, but putting jackets on nude parakeets isn't one of them. Even if I wanted to, I couldn't. They don't even let me pet them, let alone dress them. Dude, you're not a bird guy. You should have got a dog, a, he goes, when I originally bought them, I imagine I would have one pair keyed on each shoulder. Why? Hanging out around my house, but whenever I approached the case, they freeze and horror every time. They do that. I can't help her. Remember my brother's face when he fell through the ice. We had to pull him out. I thought maybe if I bought them more toys, they would, that would somehow help to birds. Motivation isn't more toys. Their motivation is you not having energy. Like I'm going to fucking twist your head off to their wings are clipped so they can't escape. You got him stuck in a cage that terrified and you yelled at him. I would say more than on one occasion you yelled at them.

Speaker 7:          00:51:01       All right. Um,

Speaker 9:          00:51:04       you need to fucking relax.

Speaker 7:          00:51:07       All right,

Speaker 9:          00:51:09       listen to this. Would you, would you want to be like your job to be in a cage all day? You know, and then some, you know,

Speaker 7:          00:51:19       I dunno.

Speaker 9:          00:51:19       Some giant comes home and puts you on his fucking shoulders and your whole job is to enhance the giants fucking life. You know what? I'm having a little bit of empathy for the fucking birds. What I would do is I would just have a totally relaxed energy and hope that they forget that you're screamed at them, treat them nicely. Don't try to pet them, just don't fuck with them. Every time you come over, they'll graduate to be like, Oh, this is the guy who feeds us. Scale brings water. This guys on our side, you know, as opposed to the mixed messages that you send to them. Um, yeah. Purchase. Don't give a fuck about toys,

Speaker 7:          00:51:55       you know,

Speaker 9:          00:51:57       do they? I don't think they do. Um, he said, I bought them a new toy every Friday on my way home from work and this is a ridiculous amount of toys in the cage. And here's the kicker. They haven't played with this single one. Not once. We'll do, do you look at the birds outside there? They're not out there. If you leave your toddler's toys outside, they don't go, oh good. They left and then they go down and they start playing on his fucking tricycle. He goes, they just stare at me. I took them to the vet, but he spent more time looking at his phone and the birds. Anyways. Any advice would be greatly appreciated. Um, I think you should find a bird lover, sir.

Speaker 7:          00:52:30       Okay.

Speaker 9:          00:52:31       And now give the birds away and then, um, I dunno. I think you should get your temper in check and before and before you do that yet, get your temper in check. And then if you want to get a dog, it seems like you want more interaction with the pet. Most people get birds because they can have an interaction with an animal, but they don't have to walk it down the street. And, uh, this is very, a lot less interaction with them. You seem like you want a bird to act like a dog slash a little kid. Like, Hey, daddy's home. I bought you a fire engine. Oh boy. Look at that as a bell work. You know, somehow you want the bird to do that.

Speaker 7:          00:53:09       MMM,

Speaker 9:          00:53:12       yeah. Please stop yelling at your birds. All right. They can't help if they shit in the water. You know, the birds, they're not supposed to be in cages. They fly around and they shit as they, they shit when they're on branches, when they have to go, they go, they don't have any stress, they don't have any shame and there's water all over the place. So then you've got him in this fucking cage with little confined area water. You know, what are, what are they supposed to do? Well, Whoa, Whoa, whoa. What do I know about the restaurant?

Speaker 10:         00:54:30       Nay, nay.

Speaker 9:          00:54:44       Hey, what's going on? It's bill burr and this is the Monday morning podcast for Monday, September 28th, 2009. Uh, my voice is a little raspy this morning cause a, I did a lot of shows this weekend getting ready for my, uh, my next hour special that's going to tape in December. And uh, somebody actually sent me an email questioning when, where, and all that type of shit. And uh, we're still solidifying all of that. So the second I know, I will let you guys know the chosen 14 listeners that I have on my podcast, which I know at this point it's more than that. You know, I've checked out some Google trends and saw that I think I'm up to about 17. I have no fucking idea how many people listen to this and I could give a shit. All right. That's it. I mean, I, I give a shit. I want people to fucking listen.

Speaker 9:          00:55:38       But, um, I don't do this thing too. Uh, I dunno. I don't know. It's weird. I don't fucking hype this thing really. If you find it, you find it. You fucking cunts. Um, all right. So this is my deal. It's Monday and I'm still in Addison, Texas. Why do you ask why bill? I thought Monday was the day. Uh, you went back to Hollywood and tried to pursue your dreams of getting into a, uh, a fucking movie here or there. Well, I'm, I'm hanging around one more day cause I'm going to the cowboys game tonight on a Monday night football cowboys playing the, uh, the fuck are they playing at Carolina Panthers? I'm kind of out of sorts. And you know, somebody's not getting this podcast. Everybody. You listen to it right now and it's Tuesday morning. And I'll tell you why he didn't fucking get it is because he fucking assholes at the hotel or rape and me on the Internet.

Speaker 9:          00:56:37       And you know, I feel about corporations. I don't fucking like them. This is what these fucking assholes do, right? You sign up for the Internet. It's 13 bucks a day at this fucking hotel, right? 13 bucks a day. That's already ridiculous. All right? But I'm on the road, you know, whatever, I'm making some money here. I'm doing all right. And I need to fuck. I need the internet. I lost my fucking blackberry. So I'm like, all right, fuck it. I'll pay it. So I sign up for this shit at about 10 o'clock at night after I had flown in Wednesday night and the next, you know, the next day, you know, I signed up for it for four fucking day. 24 hours, right? My world a day is 24 hours. All right? So I, um, you know, I wake up the next day, I do the morning radio, I hype my shows.

Speaker 9:          00:57:29       I have a great fucking time. I come back in the afternoon, I say, you know what? I think I'll go on that. That their new fangled internet that the kids are talking about, right? I go to go on the Internet and Lo and behold, I'm not on the fucking Internet anymore and I'm like, wait a minute. Even though I went to fucking summer school just about every goddamn year in high school because of math, I know how to fucking ad. All right? Is that Algebra Shit and geometry and Algebra two and trig and all that shit. That fucked me up because I'm, you know, I'm not into shapes.

Speaker 9:          00:58:07       The second they started drawing those triangles on the boy, I just didn't give a shit. It's just like really, you know there's certain things in life you just fucking, no, you're never going to use it right now. I know that you know a lot of the things. I'm probably fucking the sitting in this room right now because of geometry. Look at all his shapes. When I look around the wind of fucking look out the window, that's a rectangle. My doors are rectangle with a fucking triangle. Well that's a right angle on the doorway. Hell, there's four of them, right? Is that geometry? I don't know what the fuck it is because I'm an Isosceles triangle over by my phone. I don't fucking know. All right. But I know, you know what I mean? He just fucking know some stuff. You know you're just going to suck at.

Speaker 9:          00:58:53       So whatever bill, get on comp, we're going to have to stay on fucking track here. Right. So anyways, so basically it was, it had been about 14 hours since I signed up for the Internet and all of a sudden I'm not on the fucking Internet again. So I go back online to figure out what's going on. And right after you'd sign, you sign up for 24 hours. It says in small print in parentheses that it expires every day at noon time. So basically I didn't sign up 24 hours. What I signed up for was a, yeah, 14 hours. I paid $13 for 14 hours of fucking Internet, eight of which I was sleeping. Okay. So yeah, they fucking raped me. They came up with a new little fucky fuck charge new little, you know, they just sit around like these fucking money grubbing little [inaudible] to figure out some little fucking way, you know, that they can just somehow squeaked they, I mean, I'm sure if I sat down and tried to figure out the map, the math of like when people arrive in a hotel and when they usually check out, like how having it expire every day at fucking noon gets them a little bit more money, you know, so they can make their yachts just a little bit bigger.

Speaker 9:          01:00:08       So you know what it was usual shit. What do I do? I call the front desk, right? And who do I get? Do I get the head of the corporation that runs this Internet scam? Of course not. I get some fucking 25 year old person who fucking majored in transportation or fucking, I dunno, hotel management and now has no fucking benefits and is working the front desk and I'm pissed. So I say to him, I say, hey, they're chippy. This is bill Burke calling and fucking room one zero one eight. Niner I don't know why. Just wanted to get military, their alpha red nine or 68 cross power trip, do whatever the fuck you call it. Anyway, so fucking call this guy up and I go, look, I just signed up for a fucking day and now it shuts off at noon and the guy goes, yeah and I, um, we don't have anything to do with that here at the hotel. The Internet is a complete separate entity. So even though you're in the hotel and you're currently having their dick firmly and your ass, we don't have any responsibility on that. If you'd like to see, and you know how I can fucking complain, I have to go back on the fucking Internet and pay another 13 fucking dollars to complain to these assholes. So you know what? Fuck them.

Speaker 9:          01:01:33       Fuck them fucking assholes. You know what? You dumped fucks. You could have got 80 bucks out of me. I was willing to pay 13 a day even though that was a total fucking rip off because you little fucking cunty attitude now. You only get 13 bucks out of me. All right.

Speaker 4:          01:01:48       Yeah.

Speaker 9:          01:01:49       I don't understand why they do that. Why they just, I mean, do people just give into it trying to find the name of these assholes? What is it? I see h or something like that. I didn't know what the fuck it is. Who gives a shit? Right? I'm just having one of these fucking weeks and now I don't have any questions because I haven't been on the fucking internet this week, so I'm just basically going to have to wing this podcast. But fortunately I have plenty of stories from my wonderful stay out here in Addison, Texas. Um, here's one for you. I'm going to be on the road for the

Speaker 1:          01:02:20       next three weeks. So that's obviously putting a strain on my relationship. Okay. Something and maybe I'll do something nice for the fucking two days. I'm going to be home over the next three weeks. And uh, I'm a big fan of the corvette. Everybody. Do you like the corvette? Are you a middle aged American man like me who never got married? He doesn't have kids. So now for some, that's what ends up. That's when that's when that car starts appealing to you. You have to start thinking that shit. You know, maybe I'll, maybe I'll get myself a corvette. Maybe I'll go hang out at an Applebee's and start hitting on somebody who's at least fucking born three decades after me.

Speaker 9:          01:02:59       No, I fucking love Corvettes. I think they're there. I just loved the look of the car. I think it's, uh, you know, it's an American made car. I think it's a great value. You know what I mean? I think, you know, they got a corvette guy has like fucking 200 miles an hour. Now granted, I know, I know that one's like six figures, but you can get a corvette. Can't you get a corvette for like 65 grand? I mean, all I know it's a shitload of money. But, uh, you know, I realized halfway through this, I don't even know how much a Porsche cost. Is it Porsche or Porsche? I don't even know how to say it. That's another car that I fucking love that, uh, that you know, I can't afford. You know how much money I'd have to make a fucking year to justify blowing basically a house on a car, house, money on a car.

Speaker 9:          01:03:43       How's money granted it in fucking Arkansas somewhere, but still, you know what I mean? Um, so anyways, I think the way to go is rather than fucking going out and spending all that fucking money on the car, you just go rent one for a day. So one day I landed in fucking Burbank airport and I'm driving by Hertz rental car. And what do I see? I see a fucking yellow corvette sitting there. I'm not into the yellow, but it's still a core vet. And I'm thinking, you know, I want, he said, why don't we just fucking rent one for one day? You know, I'll rent one full one day. What's that going to cost? Right? 300 400 bucks. That's a fuck load of money. But if it's, it's way less than 70 grant, 75 grand, what the fuck? Why not rent? One of those things, you know, I'll take my girl out, we'll go for a cruise up in the fucking Hollywood hills, will tip it over, will die. Just like that fucking dude in the 50s who look like Fonzie, but that's not him. What is his name? Johnny was his name. Johnny was in every fucking bad boy named Johnny back then. Do you have notice that shit. One of my favorite things to watch, um, is old,

Speaker 1:          01:04:51       like those old black and white movies, whenever the, they're doing movies about gangs, you know, and it's always a bunch of white actors and half of them are gay, just flaming homosexuals and they're trying to act tough and it's fucking hilarious the way they flip up their collar and they pull up their sleeves. What the fuck did I watched the other day was one of the worst fucking movies I ever saw in my life

Speaker 9:          01:05:18       was a Marlon Brando movie. That one where he's on the motorcycle and he stops into the town if you want to fucking, yeah. Do you ever get embarrassed for someone? Like somebody is doing something so douchey that you just fill yourself just wanting to crawl underneath a fucking hotel bed and lay next to the dead hooker that you didn't even realize was there. You know what I mean? There is a scene in that movie where they are in this bar and these two guys start talking in this street slang and, and the old bartender just can't keep up with it. And they go like, Hey Daddy. Oh, if I can't even do it, it's so fine. We got an, I get embarrassed three even trying to recreate it. It's fucking horrific. So, uh, the fuck am I talking about it? Yeah. I want to rent this God damn car, right?

Speaker 9:          01:06:10       So I'm, I'll rent it for one day, right? A for one day. And I tell you some right now, La, during the day, especially during these hotter months, it's fucking horrible. It's like living in a city. Let's write outside of God's stove and, and you know, that doesn't make sense or trying to, you know, I was trying to say that the joke I was trying to do is like, you have a heat up an oven. Sure. We all have. Ah, at some point you tried to cook a fucking Turkey. Oh, fucking remind me. I got, I tell you about a great youtube video. Y'All, you know what? I'm going to forget. Let me get back to the stove thing. Thanksgiving's coming up, everybody. I now I'm all over the place. I'm going to fucking finish some Brando thing. I'm going to finish this stove thing and I'm going to get back to the corvette story, but first I'm going to tell him and I'm going to take a little break for the holidays. All right. Over here in America for all you people overseas, Bu, Bu, Bu, Bu, Bu, Bu, Bu, Bu, Bu, um, that was supposed to be ladies and gentlemen and all the ships at sea. Um, we have, we have a holiday over here called Thanksgiving where we give thanks for the fact that our founding fathers, uh, committed genocide and gave us all this beautiful land out here.

Speaker 9:          01:07:21       Fuck you. That's how the world works. You knew we will come and you saw a cutlasses, you know, that's how the world works. Smash Mouth Football, the black and blue division. That's how it fucking works. The Norris. Um, no it is. And I don't have a Kate that shit, but you know what, what it happened. But you know, they got their casinos, we named a couple of golf courses after him. You haven't noticed that shit. That's what I like about white people. We fucking slaughter people than we named Shit after him. Once we feel bad. Oh, we'll call this a one want to tuck.

Speaker 9:          01:08:00       This is the one buttock grocery store and this is the last and the Mohican. Culdesac um, anyways, Jesus Christ bill yet. So I saw this youtube video Thanksgiving's coming up or right. And one of the big things as a man is you have to know how to carve a God damn okay. And as much as all you fucking guys out there want to act like you know how to carve a Turkey most. See you fucking don't. But you're too afraid to ask because you're worried that someone's going to question your sexuality because that's what it's like to be a man. Basically. If you don't just somehow know shit without ever having any explained it to you, that evidently means that you, you, you want to have sex with another man. That's, that's the laws that I learned growing up. Um, so anyways, there is a fucking youtube video out there that of course I can't check because he's constant charger me $13 every fucking and expires every noon.

Speaker 9:          01:08:49       But there just go on, go on to Youtube, right? And just Google how to carve a Turkey. There is a fucking dude on there, man. I'm telling you, you, it's, it's unbelievable the way he takes his bird apart. It's masterful. Okay. And don't make the mistake I made last year because I carved the thing up perfectly, but the problem was my knives, we're a little bit dull. Go get your knives professionally sharpened this month. Okay. And Jesse eat spaghetti until Thanksgiving so you don't fuck them up because I swear to God, I've tried with that little sharpener that you get. A lot of people just take out that sharpener out of that a little knife thing. They just go week and there's a, you have to fucking hold the thing at as a, at a certain angle and you can actually be making the thing Duller if you don't know what the fuck you're doing.

Speaker 9:          01:09:37       Trust me, cause I did it. You know, I watched a couple of the three stooges things and I saw them, I saw curly. Look, I can't even fucking do it. My fucking voice is so trashed. Anyways, there's this killer youtube video man. And it's like literally when this guy is done with the thing you got, you've got the drumsticks, the wings in the dark meat, everything's lined up like that. And then you got all the white meat with just a little bit of skin on top of it, lined up like a fucking deck of cards and you come out with your serving tray. I mean, if people faint, it looks so good, that fucking carcass is just, it's a maculate. All right, so definitely check that shit out. If you're going to make a Turkey, and if you're one of those people too, who wants to deep fry of fucking Turkey, make sure you put the Turkey in the deep fryer first.

Speaker 9:          01:10:27       Okay. And then fill it up with water so you know how much fucking grease to put in there. Evidently that's what people do is they fill it all the way up to the top and then they dropped the bird in there and then it overflows. Catches flame, lights their deck on fire and they burn down their house. And that's not thanksgiving. That's not even Halloween. Anyways, let me get Ben and what if I got it back up here? So anyways, this fucking podcast is a mess. Um, to fuck died. God's oven, this is what I'm talking about. You have a heat up, a fucking oven, you know, and then you check it on whatever you're cooking. And rather than opening it and letting the heat come out and then looking down with your face, you open the door with your face right there and you get that fucking heat furnace blast.

Speaker 9:          01:11:08       That's what summer is like in La in July and August. But I'm gonna tell you at night, it's absolutely gorgeous. I'm telling you, you should do it at some point. You ever come out to la? Fuck the Hollywood sign. Fuck going on sunset. Fuck all that. Go up on Mulholland drive and drive through the hills late at night and look at the valley and it looks like Christmas, man. It's amazing. So that's what I wanted to do. I was going to get this fucking car cruise around up there and uh, you know, have a couple of drinks, wrap it around a tree, run away from the scene, blame it on a minority, you know, I'm fucking with you. Um, you know, I was kind of have a good fucking time. It's what I wanted to do. So I call these fucking assholes up at Hertz. I call him up cause I wanna rent this car. That's going to cost me 350 bucks. I'm going to throw a fucking iPod right in the trash for one fucking day. A fucking taking some s turns up there in the hills, right? So I call him up and I say, yeah, listen, I want to rent that corvette you got at the Burbank airport and they got a attack. Oh, first of all, I had to fucking get through their stupid, uh,

Speaker 4:          01:12:16       okay.

Speaker 9:          01:12:17       They're stupid. Whatever the, the, the, the computer thing. And then you know, of course they have this, this automated voice, and you can tell the person did the voice over. They told you to smile when she did it, it says, this is the tone. Just goes, thank you for calling her. It's rental car. You can actually get a better deal if you go to here. It's dead. Can needs big stupid fucking grin on her face. And it wasn't bugging me. I actually enjoyed it the first time through because I'm like, I'm going to get a corvette for one fucking day. I'm going to live the dream.

Speaker 4:          01:12:47       Yeah,

Speaker 9:          01:12:48       I'm going to live the fucking dream. I'm going to live the American fucking dream before they collapsed the dollar and combine us with fucking Canada and Mexico and put a microchip in the middle of our fucking forehead. I'm going to do it when I get this God Damn Corvette, right? So, you know, he wanted to fucking have a toothbrush shoved up your ass. Press one. If you want to fucking do a cart wheel press 19. So finally up, you get up to 20. If you want to make a reservation, I fucking hit that button. And then it, then right? Again [inaudible] right. It takes me like fucking 20 minutes, right?

Speaker 4:          01:13:24       Okay.

Speaker 9:          01:13:25       Press or say can't, right? I'm going through all that shit. So finally, I'm just like screaming operator into the phone, right? So finally I get someone and I say, you know, listen, I want to rent. You know, I saw this car corvette you had at the Burbank airport and God damn it, I'd like to rent it. And they go, okay, um, let me give you the number for the Hertz rental car location and they can help you with that, sir. And I said, okay, ma'am. And she gives it to me. All right? So I hang up and what do I do? I called the hertz location out in Burbank. And what do I get again? That same computer, Smiley voice you recalling here at Uva? Anal carer. Gail picks me again, right? If you know the extension of the person, how the fuck would I know that? How would I know what fucking extension would like to football players and they have a hall of fame career and I know fucking Brett Farve is extension for on a fuck would I know that shit. So once again, operator screaming into the phone, I want to fucking talk to a goddamn person. But of course I can't talk to a person. What are they doing the entire time? They keep steering me to the Internet,

Speaker 9:          01:14:44       basically saying in not so many words that this would be a whole fucking lot easier if he just went on the Internet. He Hurts Dad Cam. Right? You could just help us eliminate more fucking jobs.

Speaker 4:          01:14:58       Yeah.

Speaker 9:          01:14:58       So we can eventually replace all of you with fucking robots, you know? So I'm like, fuck this. I want to talk to a goddamn person. So finally I get to the stupid, you know, all I get is if you want to leave a message,

Speaker 4:          01:15:10       yeah.

Speaker 9:          01:15:11       You know, I'm like, I don't want to leave a message.

Speaker 4:          01:15:13       Okay.

Speaker 9:          01:15:14       Right. And then they go, well you didn't, you know, they come on, well, I didn't make a decision. I have to make a fucking decision. I did make a decision. My decision is I don't like any of the decisions you, you fucking gave me to make.

Speaker 9:          01:15:26       So if they get, if you want Moria change pace board, Smiley face. So I press four and then basically if I wanted to talk to a person, I could basically schedule a phone call when they could call me back. I could leave my phone number or I could wait a half an hour. So I hang up and I'm like, you know what, I've just wasted a half hour my fucking life. So I call these fucking assholes back again at the national thank. Thank you for calling her to be anal care. I'm back in that shit again. And I'm screaming operator to the phone and I get somebody to say, listen, who do I talk to to make a complaint? Because at this point I'm like, I'm not renting his fucking car from there. I know there's other places where they, they, they rent these exotic cars. Is it column that, um, I was like, fuck it. I'm just going to go through them, but I'm, but I'm going to make sure that I complained to somebody. Okay. And I'm not going on the internet and sending a fucking email. Right. So actually get a person and they go, okay, well let me transfer. Okay, I'm going to transfer you. I'm sorry to hear that, sir. I'm very sorry to hear that, sir. Let me transfer you to our complaints department. I go, okay, thank you. She clicks it over, dude. Thank you for calling her manager. I'm fucking back in it again.

Speaker 9:          01:16:42       Right. And they, and they just fucking tell me if I, if I'd like, I can't get, I can't get to a fucking person. So now I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm determined. I'm going to get to somebody I call back again. [inaudible] it's go through the operator, go through the bullshit again. I get to someone, I say listen.

Speaker 4:          01:16:58       Yeah.

Speaker 9:          01:16:58       Okay. You sitting down person on the other side of the phone. I would like to make a complaint. I don't want to fill out a form. I don't want to make an email. I want to talk to a person. I do not want to be transferred into your national gang. Wriggling here. It's fucking thing again. I didn't say fuck cause I could have hung up on me. National System again. I would like to be transferred directly to a person. I believe you call it a warm transfer in the creepy corporate world. So can you do a warm transfer, meaning something alive to something else alive. They can communicate with me and she goes, yes sir. I'm sorry. I'm sorry you're having this difficulty. I say, I understand lady. I understand you're not on the yet. You're not on the yard. You're on the dark. Getting screamed at by guys like me every day.

Speaker 9:          01:17:40       That's not, I'm not yelling at you. All right, fucking I'm on hold again. She can't get to anybody. Then I go back to her and then she hits me with the form. What is your name, sir? What'd they did? None of your fucking business. You don't need to know my name. What do you need to know my name for? So you can stick me on the hostile collar list because I had the audacity to complain about your country fucking system. I'm not giving you my fucking name. I want to talk to a person. Okay. There I just, yeah, I just, okay. Just following protocol. I understand that ma'am. I'm not mad at you. I didn't see any that country, that fucks stuff. That's what I was thinking. But I kept my God damn cool. I kept my cool just like fucking Steve McQueen in that movie where he eats the deviled eggs, get mad at damn eggs.

Speaker 9:          01:18:24       So anyways, I fucking, I fucking finally get to a person. All right. And I just say really calmed me. I just say, look, you know, I've been on the phone for 40 minutes trying to give you guys 350 bucks. Okay. And for the life of me, I can't do it because I keep talking to computers and they keep sending me back into your national system. Now, ma'am, I know you have nothing to do with this. All right? But I want to know what is the best way that I can try to complain so I can get to the inner hive, the inner layer of the hive here and actually get to that, that person who's sitting there and those loafers without any socks on sunning himself on the deck of his yacht. I want to get to that guy, the guy who made this policy.

Speaker 9:          01:19:13       Okay? I like talking to people, ma'am. I enjoy the fact that you still have a job. Okay. That's what I, that's what I like. Yeah. My phone buzzing in my phone. Buzz and hang on one second. Hey Paul, let me call you right back. All right? So, uh, you know what? It actually worked. So basically what they did was, is I got an email and they go, you can send an email and I go and let me guess. No one's going to call me. Right? Someone's going to email me back and act like it's the actual frigging person that I'm talking to. But really it's going to be an intern who's being, you know, who's working there for free. And also parttime reads those books for Oprah's book club so she can come on TV and acts like she fucking reads a 400 page book every fucking week. Right? Is that her? You're going to give me too, cause if that's what the deal is I want, I want somebody up high. So basically they gave me allegedly the email of the vice president at Hertz reservations, Dat Cam. Um, and I actually have the guy's name. Now, whether this is true or not, I dunno, but what I want to tell the guy is that I was trying to fucking rent

Speaker 9:          01:20:27       that fucking flaming yellow corvette that they have out there in Burbank, California. For the life of me. I couldn't do it. And now I don't want to do it and I'm going to bring my business somewhere else and I would appreciate it if you know, just hope against hope that maybe you'd give some human beings some jobs because my experience with your company is you may be at best have six people fucking working there

Speaker 9:          01:20:50       because you just, you just keep trying to steer the herd onto the Internet and all you dumb fucks out there who are just constantly helping them to get rid of people's jobs. You're Outta your fucking mind because those people are going to need jobs and eventually they're going to be willing to do your fucking job for a lot less fucking pay. And considering we've sent 90% of our factories out of this fucking country now, so now the American worker is going to have to fucking compete with sweatshop labor to make some fucking track shoes. You know, why don't we try to keep the jobs that we have. I'm not going to hertz.com you try to pay me off with better rates. Go Fuck Yourself. But some fucking human beings in there the way you used to, and you know what? You'd be $350 fucking rich, or I'd be driving a corvette and everybody would be fucking happier.

Speaker 9:          01:21:42       You can put some new varnish on your deck or your fucking boat. You fucking assholes. So whatever. I know there's gotta be a private place out there in la that I can call right up and they'll probably charge me even more money. And you know what? I don't give a fuck because I'm going to go in there. They'll probably give me a little piece of champagne or give gimme a fucking foot massage. All right? They probably won't do that, but I'll talk to a person and that's what the fuck I want. That's all I wanted. A little fucking human interaction San asking too. Goddamn much. All right. So anyways, there's that story. All right? And I'm going to tell you another story. They want you to tell you guys some stories this week, all right, why don't you put your pajamas on? All right, get a fire going and you're fucking apartment.

Speaker 9:          01:22:23       If they haven't boarded the thing up because they're worried about getting sued. Um, was that great back in the day where if you started a fire was your fucking fault as opposed to the landlords as opposed to, well, why did you have a fireplace in there? Well, they had a fireplace in there in case it got fucking cold out. Or maybe you want to have a romantic evening with your girl and you want to light a fucking fire. That's why there's a fireplace in there. It's a fireplace. It is a place for a fire. Now, if somehow you burn down the fucking apartment, evidently you didn't understand what place to put the fucking firing you. Dumb fuck. Who does not use a fireplace? Evidently there's enough fucking people. So they need to be boarded up.

Speaker 9:          01:23:06       Boarding up a fireplace. Jesus Christ. Why don't you put Santa Claus in jail while you're at it? All right. That was a little big. Okay. I'm just saying, you know, I like fireplaces. I like a crack of the fire. I don't like those fucking gas ones. Those fake fires. Me. Technically it is a fire. You know. I Dunno, what am I talking about? Let me tell you a fantastic fucking story last night. All right, so I'm working the road with Joe to Rosa Young Joe de Rosa, the fucking teen idol from the opiate Anthony Show who is actually going to be on the cover of teen beat this, uh, this month. And it's actually, I saw a little bit of the photo shoot. He's doing a tribute to a net, a fund, a cello, and uh, that other fucking guy was it Tony Curtis, who the fuck she used to make those beach movies with or whatever.

Speaker 9:          01:23:52       Joe's going to be there shirtless, holding a surfboard and knock. He needs, he's never looks sexier. Um, so, uh, the fuck am I talking about? I Christ, I don't even know anymore. Um, yeah, so we go out last night, right? We're doing the show is these two big titted horse sitting in the front fucking row. All right. So we're like, Oh wow, look at these girls. These girls would probably be fun, right? And I'm going to relationship, but you know, I like being the wing man. You know, I love being in the wing, man. I'd love it. I love talking shit. The girls, I love hitting on girls. I fucking do it all the time and then I try to pawn them off to wherever the fuck I am. And uh, you know, so I don't have any goddamn guilt, you know. So anyways, so long story short, we're talking to these broads and it's clear that there's some sort of strippers. I don't know what the fucking deal is. Okay. So we meet everybody from whatever. I'm going to stop naming names here. Okay. So a huge group of us from the show, from the crowd and everything. We go and we head out to this bar, right? So one of the strippers is cool, the other one has a voice that could literally crack a flat screen TV. All right?

Speaker 9:          01:25:09       So the cool one shows up. First she sits down, I'm like, Hey, are you doing, you know, I like at the end of the week, I hang out a buy a round for some people. You know, I'm in a great mood. I had a good time. I'm on my way home, you know, up by some people, some drinks. So I say to her, hey, what would you like to drink? She's like, I'll have a Faq and gag at Google, one of those fucking chick drinks. So you know, so I get her a drink. I buy young Joe to Rosa fucking drink, right? Everybody's having a good time. And then this other person shows up who I knew and she was a real nice person. I said, hey, what do you want for a drink? And she was like, I'll get a vodka red bull, right? I got my $20 bill out. And then the strip is like, yeah, make it tail right. And I was like, wait, what do you mean make it to you haven't even finished your first make. Don't be warding off my money. You've finished your first one there, young lady. All right, stand the fuck down. You're not working right now. Not some dip shit getting a fucking lap dance. All right, finish your fucking milk and cookies first. So, needless to say, the conversation cooled between the two of us.

Speaker 9:          01:26:15       But I didn't give a fuck man. I was having a good time, but whatever. It was still kind of, you know, whatever he's talking shit. We were talking sports, the bartender was cool, you know, we, everything, everything was going great. So with chill and out and all of a sudden this fucking, uh, the other fucking stripper girl shows up out and was so fucking, it was just such classic female shit. She's got a tits hanging out. She's got the fuck me pumps on and she comes up, she goes, hey. And she sees a friend with a drink and she knows God damn well she didn't pay for it. So she looks over at me as much. It's like, well that must have been the SAP who fucking bought it. Right? So she looks at me, she goes, Hey Belle. And she's like, she's like, what are you Jake can write and I know what she's doing. I'm like, I'm drinking one of those Sam Adams October fests and is leaving like that nice and awkward. Right? Cause I know what she's trying to get a drink out of me. Right? So she doesn't know what to do. She's like, ah, is it good?

Speaker 9:          01:27:19       I'm like, why? Yes. Yes it is at this point Derosa knows what's going on. I don't know that he knows what's going on. So she looks at me like, okay, well evidently he's not buying any more drinks. And then she looks at Jo, she's like, ah, hey Joe, what do you it? And Joe gets his shit eating grin on his face. He goes, why? I'm drinking a bud light. Why would you like to buy me one? And she didn't know what the fuck to do. She's like, ah, I, yeah, I guess. He goes, you know what? I think you should buy me a bud light and you should buy my good friend bill burr here, another October fest. What do you think about that? And at that point I'm fucking dying laughing. The other stripper girl next to me, she's laughing her ass off cause she knows what happened.

Speaker 9:          01:28:04       And then the fucking girl with this screechy voice is sitting there. She doesn't know what the fuck to do. We fucking nailed it. And then, and then like she's going, she didn't know what to do. And Joe's just going, yes, why don't you pay it forward for all the drinks that guys have boughten you and that you've drank. And then immediately turned around and fucking walked away. Why don't you for once by a Goddamn by a couple of drinks for a couple of guys and she's at high and you put it that way. Fine. I, well I, well I'm by effecting Janke and Joe's like, how bout some shots too? And she just was, I don't know what her fucking ego is that she goes, final fucking do that too. So we actually got a stripper to buy us two beers and two shots. So we're filling like the kings of the world.

Speaker 9:          01:28:47       And then all of a sudden we found out from this waitress that on the sly she tried to put it on a boyfriends fucking credit card. What a scumbag. Right? So we bused her and we all we, and when this big commotion breaks out right before the fucking bar, chances are about ready to swipe the boyfriend's credit card. We were like, don't chill. Joette I just like an officer and a gentlemen. I got nowhere else to go. Right. We get them to stop and they take out her ATM and she had to fucking pay for it and it was a done deal. We had two drinks, two shots from that fucking person who you know is never paid for a drink since she got her fucking tits. Right. And this was the best part. The second we got our drinks, we said thanks a lot and we both got up and we walked away.

Speaker 9:          01:29:35       Oh, it's tremendous. Tremendous. It was the best night ever and I'm just standing there drinking my drink. Like 20 minutes later I'm milking it for all it's worth. This free fucking beer that a stripper bought me was awesome. Brian and Joe was talking to some girl across the way and he looked at it and all of a sudden I just yelled over, I go, Joe. And he looks over at me and I did, I did the Robert Deniro line from when he was eating at Joe Peci, his mom right before they hacked up Billy batts. Right. He looks up and he's like, what's up? And I just pointed at the beer, the stripper at bought and I just went delicious. Delicious. And that was my evening. And then at that, there's another story for you. Would it be 35 minutes? Then you got any more stories? As a matter of fact, I do.

Speaker 9:          01:30:17       What else did I do this fucking weekend? Oh, I know. I took a trip to the cotton bowl. What is the cotton bowl bill? Well, cotton bowl is a stadium that's been around, I believe since the twenties and it's the first place that the Dallas cowboys played in and the Dallas Texans in the old AFL. And God dammit, I found out it's still existed. So I wanted to go fucking take a look at it. So I went down there and lo and behold, they were having their say Texas there. Dallas, Texas state motherfuck unfair that they have every God damn year. I got a new text message, I here, my little 16 year old phone, call me when you wake up. I want to please you asshole. Um, anyways, so I go to take a tour of this thing means the first place Tom Landry coach, you know, the first season of the Dallas cowboys, right?

Speaker 9:          01:31:05       The Dallas Cowboys team that I love, which was basically the Tom Landry years. And I never got into the Jimmy Johnson ones because watching Tom Landry leave, I mean, it was like watching Johnny Carson go, you know, no disrespect to the next people. It's just, it's just not Johnny. It's not Tom Landry. You know what I'm saying? So, uh, I never got into them. So like this, you know, it was a big deal to go check this out. So I go to, you know, go to this tour and it was the worst fucking tour ever took in my life. It wasn't bad. It was an awesome tour, but just the lady was cute, but she just didn't fucking know anything about the stadium. She goes, uh, oil, you can see on either side. They added some thethe. They added thethe all the shiny silver ones though than the new ones. And I was like, how many, how many people? That place is fucking huge. You go home, people does this place hold. She's like, I think like 20 3020 3009 all you guys aren't sports the way I am. 23,000 is like a little hockey arena.

Speaker 4:          01:32:02       Okay.

Speaker 9:          01:32:03       You know you have a hockey game. You sell at a hockey game. 23,000 this is where fucking Texas longhorns in the fucking Oklahoma sooners play. All right. College stadiums do not hold 23,000 at the Division One fucking level, especially Texas, Oklahoma. You know what I mean? So I'm like, ah. I think it's a little more, I guess like 45,000 I didn't fucking know. And she looks, and she goes, yeah, I think it's 23,000 and then she looked at it a little pamphlets. She goes, Oh, I'm sorry, it's 97,000 and I got to tell you right now, right there, the stadium tour is fucking over. It's over. I don't want to hear another word from you because that is the first point. If you're doing a tour of a stadium, like if you want the family feud.

Speaker 4:          01:32:49       Yeah.

Speaker 9:          01:32:49       And the, and the, and the queue. The first question was, you know, you're standing there with one arm behind your back so you can't cheat. I don't understand why you have to do that on the family feud. Right? Like what if you lunch with two hands, you're quicker diving in like fucking Pete rose. Um, anyways, if the, if the question was, um, you know, you taking a tour of the stadium, what's the first question you're going ask? And you fucking slam your hand down. The first thing you would say is how many people does this stadium hold? How many people does this stadium home? Fucking number one answer. That's what it would be. That's just check acted like I asked her what the fuck and consistency of the concrete was for the of the stadium. She had no fucking idea.

Speaker 4:          01:33:29       Okay.

Speaker 9:          01:33:30       And then she tried to say that, that,

Speaker 4:          01:33:32       okay,

Speaker 9:          01:33:33       back in the day, the cotton bowl, the cotton bowl.

Speaker 4:          01:33:37       Okay.

Speaker 9:          01:33:37       B O w l like a cereal bowl was open ended on both sides. Think about that for a second. A stadium that's called the, you ever seen the Rose Bowl?

Speaker 9:          01:33:49       The rose bowl is an open on any either side, is it? No, it's shaped like a fucking bowl. She tried to say that the cotton bowl was open on both ends for a while and just in 2002 they closed it off. What they actually did was they put an upper deck and as far as I could tell, they knocked down the end zone, lower level. And they just, they rebuilt that and they put an upper deck. But she was trying to say that it was open ended until 2002 and in my head I'm going, I don't think that that's right.

Speaker 4:          01:34:16       Okay.

Speaker 9:          01:34:16       I don't think that that's right either. And then we went into the media room and Lo and behold, they have a picture of the cotton bowl in 1958 and closed. You know, I, you know, and I, it just, I don't know, but we've got to go down staying right down near the field. Come right down where all the players came out and uh, you know,

Speaker 9:          01:34:35       it was awesome. It Len Dawson Hanks, dram, Bob Lilly, chuck Howley, you know all that shit right up till now. All the modern day players, Ricky Williams played there. Who else played on the Longhorn? So many fucking guys, that guy, Vince young, all those fucking dudes. I don't know. Billy Sims, Earl Campbell, you know, it was a fucking great time. Then I walked of there and they, and I went to, I walked around the little state fair isn't a little state fair. It's actually a big state fair that they have. And uh, evidently down here in Texas what they do is, and you people overseas who hate on Americans are going to love this shit. It's just this classic here. What they do down here in Texas is every year they fry some, every year with fry, something different.

Speaker 9:          01:35:20       Last year was Oreos. Year before that it was Twinkies. We Fried Coq one year fried pizza. I'm not even lying. They fried all of this shit. Somebody told me they fried Coca Cola and I had the fuck you do that. But they said they did it. I don't know how to do it. What do you freeze the coke, Huh? And it fucking roll around in some fly. I don't. I have no fucking idea, but all I know. You know what? Evidently they're out of fucking ideas because this year, you know what? They were frying. They were frying butter. I swear to God, they were selling fried fucking butter and I'm like, that is the most disgusting fucking thing I've ever heard in my life. God dammit. I have to try it. I got to try it. I have to see what it is like I made a little fucking youtube video. Actually, I got to have the kid I was with.

Speaker 4:          01:36:15       Okay.

Speaker 9:          01:36:15       Made a little video of me trying that little law delicacy, that little Texas delicacy. Dude, it was the most disgusting fucking thing I ever had. I've asked. The Guy said, all right, well first thing I wanted to do was get the fried Oreo because evidently that was a big hit. That kind of made sense to me. Fried Oreo is fucked up is that is I would figure because it's fried, it's going to be salty, but then he got the sugary cookie to kind of offset the two, you know?

Speaker 4:          01:36:40       Yeah.

Speaker 9:          01:36:40       It's Kinda like, you know, he did some lines in I drinking some alcohol, the even yourself out. Same fucking thing. Just in a food way. Right. So, uh, I went over to that one first and I go, yeah, let me get in. The guy's like, hi, don't, I'm like, yeah, let me get one of those fried Oreos Oreo cookies. And he goes, ah, ah, I'm sorry. We can't, we can't cook yet until the health inspector comes up and uh, and gives us the, okay. The Hiltons Elton Health Inspector has to inspect our booth first. So my next logical question was like, well, how do you think you're going to do, I know I walked into a restaurant, like, hang on a second, I'd love to have you give it sounds. So let's just have the health inspector go through first. Let's just see a, we have an acceptable amount of roaches.

Speaker 9:          01:37:24       So I said, fuck it. And I went straight to the fried butter and evidently they had already been inspected. And I said, all right. He goes, well, how can I help you? I go, I got to get some of that fried butter. And the guy goes, all right, what do you want? You want original? You want something else to something else? And I go, let me get the original. And he goes, all right. And he goes, uh, uh, well, he, yes, he said, the your choice of toppings. I forget what the fuck they were, but I went with the Welch's grape jelly. I know this is disgusting. You know what's funny is probably as somebody working on a treadmill right now, listening

Speaker 1:          01:37:56       to this feeling a lot better about themselves. So they basically, they look like these little, you Dunkin Munchkins a doughnut holes. That's what it looked like. And then there was like the grape jelly. There was, there was the, uh, the grape jelly, sorry, my phone keeps ringing. Um, so I dip it in the grape jelly and I took a bite out of it. And Dude, it was the most disgusting fucking thing I've ever tasted in my life. It tasted like a flavor list doughnut. And then you know that awful gum that has this squirting inside that was like the inside, except it was butter. It was just a little nugget of like butter. It was fucking gross and it was so disgusting. I had to have another one because you know one, you know one for each ventricle or ventral cause you got, if you've got more than two, maybe that's why I'm still fucking living. I don't know what, but I had another one just to be like his, was it that bad and a yes it was. It was a,

Speaker 4:          01:38:54       yeah,

Speaker 1:          01:38:54       it was wrong. It was just, that's all I can say. I was just fucking wrong and should not be done. And uh, yeah, I'm just gonna leave it dad. I think I'm gonna end the podcast right here cause I'm out of stories and a Jesus Christ, my fucking phone wants to, I got it. I have a voicemail. I'm going to New York next week and I'm going to get my blackberry, but I get a new blackberry again. I didn't get one out in la cause if you do it down in La, they can't give you a New York number. You know, and I want to keep that number just because at this point I've had the number forever. You know, I don't want to have to call fucking 9,000 people.

Speaker 1:          01:39:29       I don't know. I don't know what the fuck I'm talking about. All right. This has been the Monday morning podcast. I Apologize I didn't have any, I didn't have any questions this week. Did I? I don't have anything cause I couldn't get to my email. I had a couple, this is September 24th. Um, all right, I'm going to read one here. Um, this is actually a commenting on rugby and women. All right, here we go. Gala Bill. After hearing your show this week regarding rugby, um, where you asked whether or not any rugby player has played in the NFL, I decided to do some research on the subject. Uh, what I found out, mmm. That there've been several rugby players who've crossed over to play in the NFL. Many of their names won't ring a bell because it appears they are all kickers and punters. The two names that came up the most often were Ben Graham, a kicker who I think played for the jets and Mick Luckhurst was also a kicker who played for the Falcons from 1981 to 1987. What I found funny was that the rugby guys who attempted to try out for other positions such as linebacker or running back or often considered too small, too slow or too weak to do damage on the field against a much larger NFL players. Um, now I know a lot of people in England are going to flip out about that shit. Well, you know what? They say that all the time that American football players, they're a bunch of pussies because they wear helmets, all that type of shit.

Speaker 9:          01:40:54       Well, I got news for you. There's a great article in Gq magazine that I actually read. I never read Gq because a, it's kind of like the male cosmo where you just open it up and there's a ton of articles. Not Articles is a ton of advertising. You can't find where the fucking articles are and it smells like Cologne. I swear to God it does. It's really a fucking, it's a really, uh, it's awful magazine. But I gotta tell you this, there was, there's a woman on the cover of this magazine, Olivia Wilde might be the most beautiful woman I've ever seen in my life. She's just ridiculous. And I was like, I have to read this article about this, this, this female. And it turned out there was an article in there about concussions and about football players going crazy and killing themselves. Professional football players. And they were talking about Mike Webster, the center for a, the Pittsburgh Steelers.

Speaker 9:          01:41:51       It's an unbelievable article. It's a uh, Olivia Wilde is on the cover. And basically they were saying the helmets cause that's the number one thing I hear these English guys can say that the, you know American football players of pussy cause they were like the helmets and the pads. Evidently all the helmet does is it protects the skull. It doesn't protect the brain cause the brain sits in like fluid and it moves around. So when you get slammed in the side of the head and not only mention, they was saying the way they build these helmets is back when they had leather helmets. You know back in the days, the three stooges days, if you watch the guys play football, they didn't lead with their heads because you get knocked out. But now in an effort to protect their heads, they were basically saying what they've done with these helmets is they created a weapon.

Speaker 9:          01:42:39       And these football players, especially the Lyman, every play, if you watch them, they just slam into each other with their heads. And I have a dental. He, they're doing unbelievable amounts of brain damage. And Mike, his brain, he basically, he went crazy and he couldn't fucking remember shit. So they, during the autopsy, they removed his brain, they sliced it in half, and he had lists all Simon, I don't know that this plaque, I don't know what they called it, but it was like a, they said it should have been the brain of like an 89 or 90 year old guy in this guy died at 50. So A, I'm not saying that rugby guys are pussies or anything like that, I was just giving people shit or whatever, but I'm just defending American football players saying that, you know, just cause they have that fucking helmet on.

Speaker 9:          01:43:25       You know what I mean? I find that really interesting like you, cause I used to always watch guys were riding motorcycles and my duty. How do you fucking mind, do you realize that brain damage you're going to get if your head slams off a curb like Gary Busey did? And uh, evidently obviously, you know, if you're wearing a helmet, you know, you protect and you know, from literally putting a hole in your head so you should wear it. But you know, I, it never really dawned on me, obviously, because I'm a comedian and not a fucking, that just be, you can have a helmet on and your brain can, you can have just as much, I think basically just as much brain damage. I think what you would have to have is some sort of like hard shell in the middle and then like 80 feet of nerf on the outside of our spongy fucking material on the outside.

Speaker 9:          01:44:10       So we would have to start to slow your head down before it came to the, to the, uh, what am I trying to say? I think beyond a certain speed, it doesn't make a difference whether you have a fucking helmet on or not, because your brain is going to slam against the inside of your skull. So fucking hard, uh, that is not going to matter. And they go, that's coming from a comedian. So, you know, it's, it's medically accurate. All right, let's move on here. Um, and once again, to those people go, I have no disrespect. It's rugby guys are fucking tough sons of bitches. I have no, but no, no. Uh, questions about that, but you really have to stop saying that American football players are pussies because they have pads on those fucking guys. You know, you, you wouldn't want to play rugby against him.

Speaker 9:          01:44:56       Put it that way. All right. All right, let's plow ahead here. Alright, Bill. A use also stated some, some ways you can tell when you've won an argument with the woman. Um, stuff like the crying and when they begin to, to switch your words to talk about pass topics in the middle of an argument. Yeah. They bring up other shit that you did because they're losing the shit that you're talking about right then and there. I guess guys do that too. But anyways, let's plow ahead here. He said, well, I have a better one on my way to work. My wife and I were arguing over me hurting her feelings because I came home from a 10 hour day at work and three and a half hours of night school just wanting to go to bed. So, even though my sexy Latin woman was an, it was a, was ready for some action, I simply took a shower, crawled into bed next to her and went to sleep.

Speaker 9:          01:45:42       Needless to say, she was pissed. So this morning we were fussing about it and she says, that really hurt my feelings, um, because it felt like you didn't want me. And he said, um, and I don't know what, what came over me, but instead of being an angry black man, I simply smiled, grabbed, grabbed her hand, kissed it, and commonly said in a soft voice, now you know how I felt last week? And she said, absolutely nothing. She just stared at me like she wanted to start the waterworks, but she couldn't get a going. I dropped her off at the office where she kissed me and actually apologized. I smiled the entire way to work. Wow. I actually thought she was going to get mad because that was kind of harsh the way you said it. That's like stand up. Applause, break. Stand up comedy. Well now, you know, I felt last week if fucking Twat, that's how I would have delivered it.

Speaker 9:          01:46:40       But I guess you said it nice and calmly, but yeah, you know that is kind of fucked up. That's one of the things that I have found like in relationship is, you know, you got to watch out because for the most I think I would, I would venture to guess without doing a survey as always, I would venture to guess that 92% of relationships, women control the sex because guys will do it basically whenever. I really sound like a hacky comedian guys, we don't give him a shit, woo woo, but it's seriously and then women kind of use it as a uh, they start using. Yeah, he's still a bit about that as a reward. You took out the trash here at good boy and you get like a hand job. You know, you can't do that if you really want to equalize, you know, the whole sex in your relationship.

Speaker 9:          01:47:23       You why you got to, you got to continue to rub one out every once in a while. So that way you know if they don't want to have sex then you're like, alright that's cool. You know, and then she, I keep it, keep it on any then you create no war cause I would say then what you do is next time they want to have it then you act like you don't have it. That's not the way to go about doing it because then you start playing games with each other. What you probably should say is a, I don't know, just basically what I've said the woman which is, Oh yeah, bell, we should say exactly what you said cause you have your fucking life figured out. Your fucking single 40 year olds psychopath. Yeah. Once again, I want to say don't ever listen to what I say on here.

Speaker 9:          01:47:58       You know I am not a trained person and I'm worried at some point someone's going to take my advice, they're going to get punched in the face and I'm going to get sued. So you've got to understand that you're talking to a comedian here who's may be read three books in his life. Two of them had pictures on every other page. All right. That's, that's what you're dealing with here. Now way she, I'm telling you, the big thing with women is, if you want to get your way, is not to get mad, not to play a fucking game with them. You just have to tell them how what they're doing is making you feel they can't get around it. If you have a legitimate complaint, you know, let me, if you, I got something ridiculous like, Hey, I want to put it in your ass and you won't let me.

Speaker 9:          01:48:35       It's really making me feel like you don't trust me. I mean, that's, I think you're going to lose that one. All right. But um, oh Jesus, I'm sorry to get back on track here. If you fucking, you know, like some serious like that we just like, look, you know, I feel like anytime you want to have sex, I'm willing, but there's a lot of times I want to have it and you don't want to have it. And that was so now I kind of feel like this thing that we're allegedly sharing together, you, you totally control and uh, that doesn't make me happy. Thoughts, whatever you power the fuck you said. You said calmly without saying, fuck, and I'm telling you, well, what can they do? They got to sit there and answer it and I can guarantee you that'll, that'll work out good for you for at least three fucking days before it slides back to normal again.

Speaker 9:          01:49:31       It's a never ending fight. All right? But what you gotta do is you've got to have the fights. You got to have the fights and protect your real estate. Are you going to spend, you're going to spend your entire time and goal line fucking d. That's the worst fucking relationship you've given up so many fucking the whole time. It's fourth and goal first and Galt. What am I talking about first and fucking goal, right? And you just jumped off sides. So it's half the distance to the fucking go. We got it built. You're in a bad situation. All right, that's all I'm saying. Okay, that's the end of the podcast. Thank you everybody for listening. All right, here's what I got coming up.
