Speaker 1:          00:00:01       Hey, what's going on? It's bill burr and it's the Monday morning podcast for Monday. I don't know. A fucking day. And it was a July 20th is that what it's going to be? Is that what it's Gunna be? Pow. Yeah, that's what it's going to be at Sunday night. July 19th one I'm doing this. I am an Ottawa. I'm in my hotel room. I am stone sober. They have Cuban cigars here. I have not smoked one. And I'm sitting in bed right now with a plate full of raw vegetables that were supposed to come with hummus but came with ranch dressing instead. So I'm trying to avoid that so I can hum somehow make my goal of being down to a buck 80 this week, which I think I am. I think I am, but I don't have access to a fucking scale here. Uh, that's what it is. That's where I'm at. This is what Busan and eating pizza and bear and all this other fucking horse shit. This is where it gets you. At some point, you got to pay the Piper and sit here with a bunch of vegetables eating. There's fucking crap.

Speaker 1:          00:01:13       Oh, or a punch or rabbit right now. I don't even know why. It's not their fault. It's not their fault that I ate the way I have a like a fucking rabbit. Then you know. Oh fucking no. I don't know. I was so excited like a minute ago. Now I'm just fucking, you know, I'm just so, what's the point of living if you're not killing yourself slowly, what is the point of live? What is the point of living? It's, think about it. All this shit that, you know what that's going to kill you someday. That's the best fucking time, right? Smoking, drinking, eating. Fucking some whore. Raw. No, sorry. I need to watch my mouth here because I'm in a nice hotel. I just don't want, I don't want to disturb the people around us.

Speaker 2:          00:02:02       So anyways,

Speaker 1:          00:02:04       there's just one of these deals. This sucks right now, but in the morning I'm, I'm going to be psyched. You know? Oh, I wanted a burger. Oh Billy fucking pasty. Flabby tits. Wanted a burger.

Speaker 1:          00:02:16       No Burger for you. There will be no burger for you. I'm not going to eat or drink. The entire podcast, but I just had some salary. Right? Which salary? I think this chemical makeup is like air and water as far as I know with some green dye number five. But I got one of those salary hairs in the back of my throat right now. Ah, you fucking Veggie cons. How do you guys do it? You know, like a true vegetarian? Well, they don't sit around eating this shit. They actually have better meals. Um, you know, I love when you meet like a fat vegetarian. It's just like you're fucking yourself over on two levels right now. You know what I mean? It's like you're not eating meat and that sucks and then you're not even eating good food. You just sitting there eating like Doritos. It's actually good. Don't tell them you know, it's too many fucking people. Let them die. That's what I say.

Speaker 2:          00:03:09       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:03:10       Is that what you say? Oh, that's what I say on my podcast. That's what I say. Let the fat vegetarians who don't know how to eat right, let them die. I implore the next leader of our great nation of the United States of America, of the Americas of America, please just let him die. Okay. I don't mean people, diseases, let's try to help that shit. But if you just shove and she, well wait a minute, maybe that's how you got the disease. Cause he kept shoving shit. Okay. Down your fucking throat. Let them die. That's what I've always running for president. That would be my campaign, a message. And I would, I would contact hootie and the blowfish and I would get those. Ask him if I could have the rights to uh, let her cry. And I would just, uh, I would just have it, let, let them die and said, and I, I'd contact the black dude who's name is not hoodie.

Speaker 1:          00:04:05       Was it Frank Gifford? I don't know his fucking name is what? I think Frank Gifford, Dustin something or other, uh, what is this fucking name? I have it. Darrius Rucker, right? I did, I'm go and if Mary Parker and Shit, Oh, you did a lot of fucking wine in the raw. What a fucking genius that guy was. He saw the writing on the wall and he was just like, you know what, we made our money. I'm fucking out and I'm African American and I am going, I am steering my creative ship into the overt heart of white racism and I'm going to put out a country album. The God damn it, I'm going to be successful. And he did it. The fucking guy did it. They did. The white version of that is if you played a Ukulele and one of those fucking, you know those, those bands were chicks with dirty feet, sit there and watch them after they take off their boots and you fucking, you just put out like a, a rap album and crushed it, you know? And all you did was said he like he just put, he put on like a trucker cap. Like that was his big thing. So you'd still dressed the way you dressed and you just put on like a do rag or something, you know, and you went from singing about the Appalachian trail to wrap it up. [inaudible] what would you rap about dope? Yeah. Ukuleles.

Speaker 1:          00:05:35       You face airbrushed on the back of it, you know, and just come out, you know, I want to see so many do that. Go down on one of those eight mile open mikes and I want you to come down with a custom Ukulele. A do rag. Why does health you gotta be, I was going to say at least as wide as me, but I mean at that point going into albinos border. You've gotta be super white and I want to see you go to and just how long you can fuck in La, which is all they're going to do is Bo. Come on man. You can take a good boy and right. Go down there and fucking have one of your buddies. Airbrushed yourself in an arm, the shit pose and just come walking out what you do rag and you fucking Ukulele and just have it flipped over so they can see your face and just have a dead serious look on your face like you are about to blow everybody's fucking minds and then wrap over the Ukulele. It just see how long you can go. Why not?

Speaker 2:          00:06:26       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:06:27       Why the fuck not, oh, I'm babbling. I'm babbling. And Ottawa. Is that a Meg Ryan movie? He's Tom Hanks. Is he lonely? Is he going to come up and bang her out there on the canal? They never show the bagging and those Tom Hanks. Meg Ryan movies. That's why they never rang true for me. It's like I get it. You're finding love and all that, but at some point you do got to fuck. And I'm not seeing it, so I'm calling bullshit. You know more reducible. Oh yeah. Kim Coleman, I call bullshit. I don't think, I don't think that's sleepless in Seattle story ever happened?

Speaker 2:          00:07:07       No.

Speaker 1:          00:07:09       Why am I eating vegetables on fucking pocket?

Speaker 2:          00:07:14       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:07:15       Do you know a lot of the train conductors say eat while they do the announcements? That's why you can't hear him. Can you just shove a bunch of food in the mouth like no. No, no.

Speaker 1:          00:07:28       Wow. Is there anything worse than no fucking tomato? Maybe they were in season up here. I don't fucking fuck fucking tomatoes, man. Unless you pull them out of your yard. What are you getting? All right, don't worry. I'm gonna take it away from the microphone. If you're still listening to this, I want you to call suicide hotlines. Oh fuck. Am I sober and awake? Jesus Christ. You don't want you, first of all, I had, I had a lunch. I had a rough one coming in here. Um, I left lax. Oh my God. I went down to lax to get on Air Canada. We have a leaf on the tail that represents what a nation's about throw when some syrup and some mild racism and a couple of terrorists trying to cross the border. We play hockey. And that ice shovel board that I can't remember the name of.

Speaker 1:          00:08:40       Who is our president. No one fucking cares. Keep heading north and your mates Santa Claus or good mauled by a fork. A polar bear, that fog to grizzly bear. Great. That's everything I know about Canada next year. Polar bears and grizzly bears, they have fucked at this point. Like Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan never did in sleepless in Seattle. And they had a, they had a goal of bear or a, uh, uh, a fucking pissy. You gotta go, go, go. They're busy. That's a bad one. That Kit's going to get that little cubs going to get the shit kicked out of him at school. All right. Hey, you fucking different man. Right? Um, anyway, what am I talking about? So I want to fly in, right or ride in? Pilot flies. I just sit in the back riding in and uh, we got out onto the tarmac. That's the word you never want to hear during your flight.

Speaker 1:          00:09:44       The second they used the word tarmac, you're going to be delayed at least two hours. Um, this, you may have noticed the pilot is pulled over onto the tarmac. We're going to be sitting. What do you mean shutting the engines down here on the tarmac? I don't even know what the fucking tarmac is. I have no idea what the fuck it is. All I know is that means you're going to sit there for two hours. But, um, there was all this crazy what? This crazy fucking all this thunder and lightening and all that shit. So I'm like, absolutely Paul over to the side. I'd rather sit here. So, um, I sat there and I don't even know what the fuck I did, but basically I was supposed to connect to Toronto to get here to Ottawa and I miss that connection. And, uh, I was supposed to be in Ottawa by eight o'clock, and when I missed my connection so bad that where they hooked me up on the flight, the next flight I left at 10 35 out of Toronto.

Speaker 1:          00:10:43       Um, so it was brutal, but I didn't die, so it's fine. You know what I mean? And at the end of the day, as long as it was, I still went from La to Toronto to Ottawa in one day, which was impossible up until a couple of decades ago, right in the 70s. You couldn't do that. They were, they had to pull over and stop, you know, fight off some of indigenous people as they tried to refuel in some God forsaken place, like nonstop flights from La to Toronto. I don't think that started until the early 90. [inaudible] as far as my Wikipedia page says, obviously I know that. Well, when was the last time that you, what did they first be able to go from like New York to La without stopping? I don't know. Bill, why don't you look it up? Like I said, I don't give a fuck. I'm just talking filling up fucking time.

Speaker 1:          00:11:28       I'm filling up your little ride to work right now. Huh? How's your car doing? Is it sputtering along? Is it running good? What is it doing? Why did you buy that? Cool. Um, so anyways, on the flight out there, uh, I watched, uh, the Maltese Falcon whenever they have that on there. I loved Humphrey Bogart. And if you're a, a big Frank Sinatra fan, frank was a huge fan of Humphrey. And when you watch Humphrey Bogart, you see a lot of, uh, elements of his swagger, uh, in s Sinatra's style. And I have to tell you right now, if you're trying to quit smoking and drinking, do not repeat. Do not watch the Maltese Falcon. Do Not Watch that movie. Humphrey Bogart makes smoking and drinking look like the greatest thing ever before you like, Oh, you sure you know that guy died of lung cancer? I know he smoked camels unfiltered like a fucking chimney. Do you know what else he did? He became one of the biggest stars in Hollywood. Has ever known any fucking, was he hooked up with the, was it bogeying Bacall Lauren Bacall when she was like 19, she was like, that is a fucking stellar human being. He was in his forties

Speaker 1:          00:12:44       and they will fuck it. Inseparable. They loved each other and he never wanted to go out. She always, there's two couples that I fucking, I that I love. Bogeying Bacall and a Paul Newman and Joanne Woodward. They somehow they fucking made it. Now obviously Bogart died. So that really helps to marriage, but fucking Newman and Woodward fucking made it. Um, put anyways, this fucking guy is just rolling his own cigarettes, which wasn't bad. But at one point in the movie when he sits down with the fat man there, he and he hands him a fucking torpedo cigar. And if you look at the master, the master shot, which is basically a,

Speaker 1:          00:13:25       how do I describe it? Jesus Christ, I've been in a couple of movies I should know. This is the master shot is like whatever the scene is. That's the wide shot where you see the, where they are. Everybody that's basically in the shot. That is the master shot. They usually shoot that first and then they go, all right, coming around to your point of view, his point of view we're going to do is to show, we'll do a three quarter of dual fucking close up and all, it's all up to the director, but the master shot, if you look at the other shots that, not smoking but in the master shot, they're actually smoking cigars,

Speaker 1:          00:13:55       well acting and make it one of the great movies of all fucking time. It's one of the, I just, that's all I think of when I see that I want an acting gig where I just get that on the master. I get to smoke a fucking great cigar that so that they, ah, it's so fucking phenomenal movie. And I think one of the most underrated actors of all time, even always a considered a legend. I think he's one of the best actors of all time is a, I hope we say his name. Peter Lawford I think is awesome. And, and the guy who plays the fat man in the, I should know all these people's names. He's fucking amazing. Just the sound of his voice, the way he plays it, the way he's just such an even keeled emotional person with everybody else's kind of erratic and a, it's a fucking awesome movie.

Speaker 1:          00:14:36       But if you stopped smoking and drinking, I mean it's fucking brutal. That's back in the day. Can you imagine back in the day, like if you just walked in to get car insurance and the guy sitting to cry, you want to drink? Yeah, let's fuck. That's fucking Dylan. I just gives you a shot. There's no drinking and driving. There's no laws against it. There's no breathalyzer. There's nothing. There's no airbags. Fucking water's fine. The fucking food hasn't been genetically altered. You just walk in places, hey, you want something to speed? Was doing smoker drank back then? You weren't an addict, you would just consider it an adult if you couldn't get your shit together. [inaudible] he's a drunk. He's the town drunk. It's a fucking wine. I'll get your shit together right now. Everybody's a fucking addict in it isn't their fault. I Dunno. I guess I understand that. Um, with drugs, I certainly understand that with drugs and alcohol. I've lost some friends to that shit, but I got to say what the food stuff, you know, I don't, I don't know about that one. It's just kinda like,

Speaker 3:          00:15:44       okay,

Speaker 1:          00:15:44       just eat a salad. My oversimplify. It really is, I guess that's say who an alcoholic just don't drink. But you really just got like, I'm trying to say this in an empowering way to like tonight I wanted a burger. I wanted to fucking ribs. I wanted all of that shit. And you just got to get past that dumb thought and think like, do I really want to have to do, do I like going to the gym now? Do I want to go on the elliptical for the rest of my life? No. Just throw a couple of celery sticks down your fucking pie hole and then that, that craving will be good. Like right now, I'm not even thinking about a steak. All I'm thinking right now is how awful vegetables taste. But you know what? That'll be fine. What I'm looking at my options call a, if I was a vegetable, I'd be called a flower. Isn't that sad? Like the ugliest vegetable there is? I had a green one the other day. You know something? If I wasn't so stoic, I'd start fucking crying right now. Just the last couple of days of eating has been fucking brutal. However, um, that's not what I came here to talk about everybody. I came here to talk about, um,

Speaker 3:          00:16:49       okay,

Speaker 1:          00:16:50       how I was in Ottawa tonight. And it's hilarious. My agent goes to me, he goes, hey, before you do the Montreal comedy festival on Monday, there's this Gig, um, there's Blues Festival in Ottawa. Deep Purple's going to be there, Yada yell at type of Shit. So I go, yeah man, fuck it. I'll do that. When I was in Reno, there was a blues festival. All of a sudden, I don't know about a week, it was like months ago, about a week out. I, the fucking word comes in that a dead. It's actually, it's outside and I'm going to be going on in between bands. I'm like, what the fuck was, I call it my age and I was just like, dude, I'm not trying to be a diva here, but uh, then we already pay these dues. I thought I already, I already did these. I did these gigs to not have to do them again.

Speaker 1:          00:17:38       Right. He's like, no, no, it's going to be great. It's going to be great. Saget did it last year. He had a great fucking time. And I'm like, this thing is outside. Yes, it's outside. I go on in between bands. Yes. You go on in between bands and I'm like, and it's good. And he's like, yes, it's good. Trust me. It's good. Now I assume most of you guys will listen to this or not stand up comedians, but any standup comic who is listening to this right now is like going either laughing or going, no, don't take the Gig. So I fucking show up.

Speaker 3:          00:18:11       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:18:11       And, um,

Speaker 1:          00:18:14       you know, weird Al Yankovic had gone on like at like five in the afternoon when it was hot as shit. He's putting on all these fucking costumes and stuff. So he's laughing about it and we're having to fight and I'm standing there looking out in the crowd and uh, Bachman Turner overdrives play it on the other side. It's one of those things where they got two stages going when they finished, then I go up and then the next band, so they are out there and I'm just looking at a bunch of, there's no chairs. It's the summer, so it's still fucking, you know, broad day light and it's fucking McGee as shit, you know. And Bob Bachman, I guess Bachman's the only guy left and he's on the other side of the fucking parking lot

Speaker 4:          00:18:56       from alarm clocks border.

Speaker 1:          00:19:01       Well, I'm just sitting there taking this all in and going, I am going to eat my fucking ball. I'm going to bomb. This is going to be a fucking nightmare. And I was gone out of that. Good. They're good. So, uh, anyways, they ended up bringing me up. This radio guy brings me up fucking amazing voice. What I want to fly. I'm like, guys, sounds like amazing, right? Brings me up. And I come walking out there and uh, the whole crowd cheered and it was ended up being this fucking amazing show. And I was really kind of waiting for two, uh, in the first eight minutes I was waiting for it to go bad and it was fucking amazing. And then I was outside and I started thinking about Robin Williams. Uh, all those shows, he did perform for the troops. Those were outside. And uh, I don't know, I'm middle of it.

Speaker 1:          00:19:52       I got like about 10 minutes in, I got inspired to like really quit being a fucking baby about this thing. Um, cause you know, you get out there, you know, if you think somebody's coming at, you want to start fucking lashing out of people before they get you and everything. And uh, reminds me this, this faith, there's this famous story about Robin Williams. Um, Joe Barton. Nick told me it and um, you know, he was royalty. Um, Robin Williams in San Francisco. So I guess there was some sort of concert that was supposed to happen, some huge band and everyone's standing outside, you know, some giant fucking venue waiting to see this band. But it started raining and lightening and all this shit's of the band couldn't go on and everybody was getting upset. But I guess Robin Williams was in the crowd was there for the show and he just said fuck it.

Speaker 1:          00:20:40       And went on stage for like an hour or an hour and a half and just did a off the, you know, the top, his head comedy show fucking destroyed. And in the end of his show, the sun started coming out, the crowd went fucking nuts. And then he brought the band on and um, I don't know, he told me that says that that's one of the coolest fucking things ever. You know, somewhere in the middle of it. And I started thinking about this, that, that story. But anyways, I want to thank everybody from Ottawa and in, in and around Ottawa who came out to the show. You guys had no chairs. You stood up for an hour. I had a fucking great time. And uh, while I was doing it, the sun was going down in the sky was amazing. I kept making fun of that. Like I'd be in the middle of a joke.

Speaker 1:          00:21:24       Right? Tell a joke. Yeah. It's my fucking wife of Blah Blah. To Go, Oh God, how great was that breeze? I was saying all this shit I'd never said in 23 years on stage. How great was that? How great is the breeze a look at those clouds? Somebody take a picture and shy. That was, it was unreal. It was a phenomenal gig. And to make it even even better was a, believe it or not, the, uh, um, the company that we hired to animate F is for family, which is coming out in December, is actually in Ottawa. So I went over there today and I met everybody and they were all cool as hell and young and they thought the show was fucking hilarious. And it wasn't like anything they had ever seen. So, and I, and I met this, this one woman who was, I'm not, I'm not giving away any of the show, but was animating this really fucked up scene.

Speaker 1:          00:22:19       And I was laughing that she got to see just because of what the scene was about and her being a woman. And she said, and I was like, how did you end up getting this? She said, I actually requested it. I wanted to animate this scene. And I got to tell you guys, I don't talk to any shit. I'm not as well, who's kidding, who I fuck around? But I'd like when I talk about my career, I don't talk about any ship, but I will just say this, I was very, very excited when I left those studio, that studio today. And I think, I think this show's going to be, I think this is the one is far as I found the right thing where I can be funny the way I'm funny and standup and funny on the fucking podcast. I can be that kind of funny on TV.

Speaker 1:          00:23:05       Um, so I don't even feel like I'm jinxing it. I'm one of those fucking old ladies, like don't say that. Then you're going to fucking jinx it. I think it's fucking, it's really coming out. Well, I'm trying to fucking not be too fucking excited, but uh, just do me do me a solid you guys. When that fucking thing comes out, just watch it on Netflix. Just fucking watch it so we get good numbers because, uh, and then if you like it, please tell some other people. I don't think I'm going to have to ask you to do that. Ft. Watch it. I'm just saying that right now. Oh, Billy is talking a little shit here. Talking a little bit of Shit then that's all I fucking need, right? I do stand up and then I do this fucking off the wall cartoon. I call it a day.

Speaker 1:          00:23:51       Call it a day, do a good five seasons of that. And then I fucking happy trails. I go by my fucking ranch in Alabama. I'll see you get the NHL package, the MLB package, the fucking, uh, the fucking, one of the basketball one is, I'll get the college one too. I'll get the fucking end league pass, NFL pass, whatever the fuck it is. I'm getting all of those. All right. And then I'm getting me a case. A fucking bear. That's it. Get me a case of fucking beer and then I'm going to fucking, I'm going to join the Klan when I'm down there and I'm going to see, I'm going to be like, see if I can like talk people out of it. Just show up to meetings and sort of nod as people are talking and just sorta be like, damn, I ain't know me. I'm just doing it. Then that, that back of mine, you know, just, I'm just saying, I'm just saying and you know, it's funny. That's what every group needs. Even if you have a good cause, you need somebody in there that does not share your point of view because if you don't, you go off the fucking rails.

Speaker 1:          00:24:53       That's what the Klan needs. The Klan needs some members that don't hate black people just to fucking spin them back into reality.

Speaker 3:          00:25:02       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:25:03       When should think like these feminists groups, that's what the fuck they need. They need some fucking jerk off guy like me in there just to fucking, you know the kid. You can't be in a group where everybody thinks the same way. You spin off down the fucking wheel. It's like when conspiracy theorists get together a fucking eyebrows shoot up to the ceiling. Next thing you know, we're, we're, we're talking about ad everything was an inside job. You need somebody there to be like, guys, guys, guys. Do you realize how many people would have to be involved to pull that off? And everybody keeps their fucking mouth shut and then you can be all, you know what? You're right. You're right. We got a little out of hand there. We got a little out of hand. Maybe I'll drive by heckling clan meetings in the south.

Speaker 5:          00:25:49       Just drive by it. Not that bad. If you get to know some paypal, I wouldn't agree with that. I have experiences that are like that

Speaker 1:          00:26:03       anyways. Um, I don't know what the fuck I'm talking about. Let's do some reads this week. Um, fucking draft kings has been breaking my balls. Just breaking my fucking balls. I love draft kings. I don't know what they're fucking play. Don't like that. I make a joke that they're a fucking gambling website. They don't like it. I keep getting the, like I got a text they said earlier this week, just, you know, we love the reads. Just don't say that we're a gambling website. Just say that we're, it's more of a skill based thing. It's just like what? What are you talking about? It's like you're, you're gambling. You've combined a fantasy fantasy football with, with the Vegas sports book. We're all adults. I don't have a problem with it. Why can't you just be who you are? Draft Kings. This is the fucking letter I got here. Where is it?

Speaker 1:          00:26:58       Here. All right. Uh, okay. Just, just sent saying the advertising. Did you see the email regarding draft kings? Please remind bill not capital, not to compare draft kings to gambling. Well Dad, I don't, I don't fucking get people that, first of all, gambling is legal. It's legal.

Unless you sat there in the meeting and you went like, listen guys, this is just bad for business to say that this is a gambling website, so let's hope bill is dumb enough to go along with. It's more of a skill based fucking thing. Well, I'm going to keep reading it the way I read it. What about the Howard Cosell thing that I do? You don't like that.

Speaker 1:          00:28:39       That's what they used to say in the football card when I was in high school, when they'd had known that the bookie give you that on the back it says not to be used for gambling. It's just a skill based game. We all know what's going on. All right, there we go. That's like the two people at the office who were fucking and they think nobody knows. Everybody knows that, right?

Jesus Christ. Oh my God. What am I, I'm a two weeks in, two weeks in. It's just hard at night. If you notice when I do the podcast in the morning or in the afternoon, then in that damn bendable bull, I'm going a good fucking mood. This is when it's the hardest. You know, your body starting to shut down and the devil starting to wake up like, Hey, what are we doing?

Speaker 1:          00:37:32       What are we doing? You're born in your goals. [inaudible] um, all right, let's read, let's get to some of the reeds here. Have I talked about everything I wanted to talk about here? The fuck else did I want to mention? Um, Oh, oh, Jesus Christ. I almost forgot, uh, one of the guys that basically taught me how to be a comedian unfortunately passed away a 73 years of age. Bob Cybele. Um, it was laid to rest today and, uh, I just wanted to make sure that I took time to mention, uh, what a fucking great guy. He was meant to such a great guy. He was always cool to me when I started out and just such a, um, I mean, I didn't even know all this shit about, I'm going to read this, this link here when they talked about, um, Bob Site Bell, uh, he started in 1979.

Speaker 1:          00:38:28       That was the start of a 36 year career in standup comedy from a guy whom his good friend and fellow comedian, Mike McDonald, who is another fucking hilarious comic called the fantastic maniac on stage. Bob made you laugh offstage. He was gen, he genuinely cared about people. And uh, this, this is what I found amazing about this guy and actually I kind of relate it to it where he was into a bunch of different shit. Um, let's see. Where the fuck is it Christ bill, why don't you given a tribute to the gain? You're going to fuck this whole thing up. Well, you know what? You're going to have to deal with me reading out loud here. Uh, those are new Cybele are aware that his life was lived in two distinct parts with January 5th, 1977 serving as the, as the line of demarcation. I hope I said that right.

Speaker 1:          00:39:15       That's the day he gave up drinking, driving into an occupied parked car on market street was the final Straw. And while his post drinking life was not much longer in years, 38 versus 35, he was determined to live every day like it was like he was trying to make up for lost time. Uh, they've see the, basically the gay and that does sec is commercial. The most interesting man in the world doesn't have anything on Bob. Say Belt. Now you know what you're thinking. What the fuck does that mean? Here you go. Where do you start? Cybele ran more than 30 marathons. This is a monster headline comic. He also ran more than 30 marathons, including the Boston marathon 17 times. He was a certified scuba diver who dived, you know, he did cruises. He did. She fucking dove all over the world. An artist, a musician, an airplane pilot.

Speaker 1:          00:40:03       He hiked the Appalachian trail several times, climbed mount, kill him, kill him. Agero he went on transatlantic cruises, uh, though, not in the traditional manner, he would travel on cargo in steam ships and was often the only one on the ship not working. It was his economical way to see the world. Uh, that was far from the only traveling he did in the last 11 years since he and his loving companion reconnected. They dated in high school and lost touch for 44 years. The pair of traveled to China, Italy, Morocco, Greece, Turkey, Ukraine, France, Spain, England, Ireland, Iceland, The Bahamas, and Canada. Let me tell you something to do. That's the way to be a fucking comedian is once you're a headliner comic and you're telling fucking jokes and people are coming out to see you, why you would ever get yourself sucked into the industry when you can do all of this shit.

Speaker 1:          00:40:59       How fucking amazing is that? He fucked around for the first 35 years of his life and was still able to do that. And I gotta tell you, man, he was one of the greatest fucking guys. And, uh, when I started out, I know I've mentioned this before, um, I started out in March in 1992 and the big eighties common comedy boom was crashing hard. And there was a lot of guys that worked in the 80s. They basically, they had more, more rooms than actual bonafide comedians. So what happened was I came in during the trimming the fat years. So obviously I did not start off from the greatest rooms and I ran into some of these bigger guys that were coming back down and had to get day jobs. And they were, some of them were some of the worst fucking people you'd ever want to meet. I forgive them because they were fucking dealing with, you know, what they were going through.

Speaker 1:          00:41:50       But some of them, I mean, I know guys who would be like, hey, you know, look at this, look at this. It's Wednesday night. You know, fucking three years ago there'd be a line around the block. There's barely anybody here. And I had a guy one time say that to me and say, you know what a file if I was starting out, Nah, I quit, man, I get into something else. It was literally trying to discourage me. That's how desperate this person was. And um, Cybele was not one of those guys, man, he was just a great guy. Really was interested in, in who you were and what you did and all that. And uh, he lived a hell of a life. Uh, that's another great thing. I'll post the, the uh, this article, one of the coolest things anybody could ever say about you. They said Bob side bells bucket list was empty.

Speaker 1:          00:42:33       So, um, I dunno, I definitely just wanted you guys to know who that guy was. He was a fucking great dude, man. All right. So anyways, let's get onto your questions here for the week, for the week, for the week, for the week. Where the hell do I go here? Sorry, I'm on my iPad. I'm on my mini iPad. It's like, it's big, but it's small. You know what I mean? All right. Um, okay. Once again, people. Um, if you want to email me and ask me questions, the email is bill@themmpodcast.com. Um, Boston posters are still on sale as of now. There's 175 left. I know I had a lot of problems with the website, but you know me with technology. I'm also, I'm supposed to remind you guys about be the match.org. Be The match.org. It's the bone marrow registry. You give bone marrow, you can save somebody's life.

Speaker 1:          00:43:26       Uh, we've had a few listeners that respond that joined the registry, uh, at the [inaudible] match in tweeted us at what a great experience it was. All right, there you go. That's, that's, that's good Karma to whatever horrific thing you do this weekend. You want to balance it out. You can go do that. All right, galaxy search. As I mentioned, I was looking for a Ford Galaxy. My wife has kinda making me being a little more smart about it, but uh, I already have one fucking old vehicle that I got to get fixed all the time. She's right. But you know, maybe it needs a friend. Anyways, this guy said, hey bill, if you want to search craigslist nationwide for that galaxy, try search tempest. So there you go. That's for you guys. Whatever the fuck you [inaudible] looking for a www.searchtempest.com. All right, here we go. Let's get into the questions for the week here.

Speaker 1:          00:44:12       A new fan from Norway. J UPP jump. That's right. New Fan. It's possible. Great podcast. Great shows. Well thank you sir. Or ma'am, uh, I've seen all your clips on youtube and the last couple of days now, summer holidays at the cabins raining. So thank you. You saved it. A pardon my English. But how's your new Norwegian? Right? You know what? You got me there. You're way better than I am. I don't know anything other than Tuck, which means thank you. Um, so somebody could be like, hey, can I shoot you in the head? I'll be like, thank you. Yes, absolutely. Keep on doing whatever you're doing at works. And when you come back, when are you coming back to Oslow? Uh, because I know you, I see you've been here. I've been there twice. My friend next time call me, he gives the phone number and he goes, not gay. I love when guys do that. Not Gay. Like what if you were that they like, I like whatever move you made, I would. Hey Dude, I'm not gay. Yes, sorry man. But you know, I'm flattered.

Speaker 1:          00:45:16       Then it would be over. Let me go cross country skiing or whatever. I can handle it. If he gay, no big deal. A promise. He said, I promise I can. I can take you on a local to a local soccer game. Anyways, best regards, blah, blah blah, blah blah. Uh Oh, his name is Glenn named after Glen Anderson from the Gretzky line from his Edmonton Oilers years. True. My, uh, my dad's work. What? Valerie go red sox rangers, New York giants, l Beckham Jr. We'll own 2015, 16. You know what dude, you went off the rails with your, your English. I don't know what happened there, but you know, what most important thing, when am I going back over there? Uh, probably next year. Um, I think the last time I was there was the end of 2013 so I am more than overdue cause I could go there right now and give you guys all brand new hours worth of jokes.

Speaker 1:          00:46:12       So, uh, and I think this team, this time when I go over there, I'm going to add some eastern European countries and uh, I don't know. I'm looking forward to it. Definitely looking forward to it. Last time I went to Oslo, met this fucking Badass dude who was shredded. It was this little guy who had the most sickest fucking beard. He just did not shave. And his beard went from just under his eyes. Downton met his chest hair. This guy was a fucking animal and uh, he had just come back from Thailand. We're two months out of every year. This guy goes over there and it just gets taught by these masters and gets the shit kicked out of them and comes back here like a fucking cause back to Norway, just absolutely shredded and even more of a deadly weapon than he was when he left.

Speaker 1:          00:46:57       Um, those are the kinds of people that I like. Those are the kinds of people that you should meet because that's the kind of shit like you listen to like, dude, you can do that. You can just leave what you live for two fucking months, go to the other side of the planet in fight for two months. And it's like, yeah, if you set your life up, always working towards that, your life ends up going around that shit. So if you're young right now, you know when you're sitting there, you're getting ready to get out of college and the whole cubicle life is scaring you. You could set it up however you want to set it up, just doing the shit that you want to do and then you'll life sort of builds around it. All right. So anyways. All right. Weight loss, challenge a, they have freckles. I love the podcast and I've been trying to get motivated to at least not be that fat. I'm from Wisconsin, so beer and cheese curds are like appetizers before more beer and meets with fried cheeses. Ah God dude, you know hard. That is the read right now. And you know how fucking great that sounds.

Speaker 1:          00:47:59       Oh my God, I'd kill for any of that right now. He goes, I'm five, nine 218 pounds. Big Boy.

Speaker 3:          00:48:08       Okay

Speaker 1:          00:48:08       Dude, you are, you're, you're like fourth and goal weight. Give it to you. You'll get it in there, man. Five, nine to 18. That's pretty fucking solid, my friend. And he said, I bet I've, oh, how many fucking hoodies do you want? He goes, I've always been active in play sports they ago. So there's muscle underneath there. You, you're going to fucking destroy somebody if you start playing rugby. Um, you said, I've always been active and play sports. After your last Monday morning podcast, I was asked by some coworker if I wanted to be there fourth in a relay marathon because of your recent fat motivation towards yourself and challenge. I am doing it. All right, good for you. Said this. Chubby John Stockton Pot paps beer loving bastard is already ran 13 miles this week already and it's cut down on the PBR. Switching to PBR light. Ha ha ha.

Speaker 1:          00:49:02       Thanks for the encouragement. All right. Good field. Yeah, dude, that's the one thing I have noticed since trying to lose weight is a runners are fucking, they're all fucking skinny. You don't see a lot of fat runners unless somebody is fat and they decided to run. Other than that, it just sort of melts off of you. My only thing is I don't know how their feet and knees can take it and their back and everything like that. Um, I got this weird thing where I could sort of run on a treadmill a little bit, but if I run outside, if I run on a sidewalk, like I'll go half a block on my knees are like, hey, hey, hey. Easy, easy. What are we doing here? What are we doing? All right, get on the grass and start walking. So my biggest thing that I'm doing is I'm just changing the way I eat. Um, whose kid? No, I'm taking a break from the way I eat. I'm always going to have steaks and shit like that. But uh,

Speaker 1:          00:49:52       God dammit. Look at this. I have three pieces of cauliflower. I get like two carrots, three little those round fucking tomatoes and a couple pieces of Broccoli is, there's nothing. I love Broccoli if it's steamed, but if it's completely fucking raw, it is practically impossible to eat. And you know what's even harder is to eat it. And actually do you know, do a podcast. I bet this has never been done. Has anybody ever just taken a big fucking thing at shoved it in their mouth and tried to read an email on a podcast? Podcasting is so young, you know, I don't think it's been done. This is like eating a fucking raw broccoli with nothing on it. This is like, you know that cinnamon challenge and like a vegetarian way. Here we go. This is so gross. Look at the top of Broccoli. It's like, you know those people with gross tongues, all those little bumps on the fucking tongue. It's just, this is fucking nasty. Ah, all of our golf, I don't know, an eight an ironing board, but I think this is what it would fucking tastes like. This wasn't even full.

Speaker 2:          00:51:08       This is a fucking gross and think, oh my God. Oh, it's fucking horrible.

Speaker 1:          00:51:19       Broccoli. Two thumbs down. You know what? Broccoli is like part of a comedy team. Like I live in comedy. They'd had to be part of a team. There's no fucking way this thing could go on stage by herself and hold a crop.

Speaker 2:          00:51:31       Holy Shit.

Speaker 1:          00:51:34       I tools that never fucking, then you will chew Broccoli for like four fucking hours.

Speaker 2:          00:51:43       Oh God. All right.

Speaker 1:          00:51:47       Jesus Christ. Um, anyways, why don't I do this? I still have to fucking cheek smaller. The ship will be a ballplayer in the fucking seventies and eighties said, it's tobacco, it's Broccoli. That'd be great if you joined a baseball team. They're all putting my fucking dip in back in the day and just sticking like Broccoli. And they're like, why are you doing? Oh yeah, I still broccoli. It's good fiber. It's good for your prostate, keeps things moving. He's a good for your prostate. I don't know. It's not good for your mouth, I can tell you that. Wow.

Speaker 2:          00:52:24       Correct.

Speaker 1:          00:52:28       I never make noises like this one. I'm eating steak. That's all I'm saying.

Speaker 2:          00:52:32       You know,

Speaker 1:          00:52:34       you eat steak yet. Ah, you fucking drop the fork. Unless it's a shit one.

Speaker 2:          00:52:39       You know what I mean?

Speaker 1:          00:52:41       Here's a good, is a good rule of thumb. If you walk into a steakhouse and they have steak sauce on the table, you turn around and you walk the fuck out. All right, good steak. Just not, it's a fucking month ended already.

Speaker 2:          00:52:54       How long does this take? Come on. All right. There we go.

Speaker 1:          00:53:03       You know, it's funny that man versus food. I never saw him eat broccoli. I know why. I know it sucked towards the end of the challenge, but he always enjoyed the beginning. All right. Sorry about that guy. So that was a bad fucking idea.

Speaker 2:          00:53:15       Holy Shit.

Speaker 1:          00:53:18       Oh, the only thing worse than that would be eating like a mouthful of hair. All right. Bad Ass Russian pilot. Oh, you guys got to see this video. You guys see this video? Um, I actually got her name. She's um, her name is Svetlana. How great is that named Svetlana Nina. Svetlana Kappa Nina, right. Um, dear bill, the red bar on, oh, like the red baron. I get it now. It's not bad. Since you're a pilot now I thought you might find this video interesting. Even though I had my license, I do not consider myself. I am a novice dude. I'm still fucking learning here obviously. Okay. The Russian pilot is considered, uh, the pilot of the century. Um, oh, she's considered the pilot of the century. According to our t news, she is one of the world's most honored aeronauts. Check out the video below. It's a cockpit view of her flying acrobatics around the Black Sea.

Speaker 1:          00:54:19       Um, look wise, she is a Russian seven, but when you factor in her pilot skills, she becomes a perfect 10. Um, more Russian seven is a fucking at least an eight and a half or a nine. Anywhere else in the world. They're gorgeous. I'm seriously though this video shows that the Soviets were, we're on to something when they used women as combat pilots in World War Two. I didn't know that by the way. The Germans didn't have a chance against the night witches. I got to look some shit up on that. Hope my internet came back. He's fucking dickheads. I paid for it here. Let's see here. Night, which is, I got to read about this, but I watched the video, we'll post it and I'm, the shit that this person is doing is like just the level of, Jeez, I give us the, those guys like when they just auditioning to see if they can be a jet pilot and you know, they, they sent him around that fucking whatever.

Speaker 1:          00:55:14       It's like that, that carnival ride that you always go on except dates. It's way faster and they end up like passing out and shit. How she doesn't pass out and um, and knows where the hell she's going. I actually got dizzy watching it. She's, she's fucking unbelievable. All right. Night witches, everybody, um, name, which is the English translation of um, some fucking German word that I can't fucking pronounce or World War Two German nickname. Um, for the female mill, uh, female military aviators of the 588th night bomber regimen known as the 46th Tom and guy, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. How can they ever made a movie about this? Cause it's the Russians and the Cold War. Jesus Christ. This has Meryl Streep written all over it. You know, they wanted to do it and instead they did a league of their own because the fucking wall hadn't come down in Germany yet. It's a fucking amazing. This amazing, uh, should be a movie. They must have made one already. The regiment flew, harass, harassment, bombing and precision missions against the German military from 1942 to the end of the war. All right. This is creepy. How do the Germans know that it was a guy or a woman? You know what happened is they shot one down. They ran over to see if they was still alive and if they were, they killed him and then in the end they realized it was a woman.

Speaker 3:          00:56:41       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:56:42       How the fuck did they know? I never understood that. How he got to know your enemy that well. Like you knew, you knew that that was the, like when they're dropping bombs on you, you're sticking your head out. Yeah. It looks like the five 88th night balm or regiment. So sassy pitches. All right. The night regimen or I blahblahblahblahblah they threw over foreign 800 admissions by the end of the war in 23 having been awarded 23 of them were awarded the hero of the Soviet Union. Title 30 members died in combat. Um, the regiment flew in wood and canvas by plants. All that's why, ah, Jesus, they fucked him over. They didn't give him a nice planes. A 19, 28 design intended for use as training aircraft and for crop dusting. And to this day, the most produced by playing in, in all of aviation. Oh my God though Joseph style, he didn't give a fuck.

Speaker 3:          00:57:42       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:57:43       Teach sacrifice at 200,000 fucking of his own God damn people to get another hundred yards. You didn't give a shit him put the broads up in those old fucking plates do it or I'll fucking have you killed. It worked. All right. It worked. He'd beat their fucking ass. It's couldn't beat the people in Finland. Now Cuddy, I still have those fucking Broccoli Shit. My mouth. I'm gonna read more about that, man. That's very interesting. Thank you for that email. All right. What are we up to? 58 minutes. All right, let's get in the last fucking thing here. Let's get the last fucking read in here. Um, [inaudible] all right, girlfriend with too many guy friends. Jesus Christ. I'm sorry. I'm still doing what the Broccoli here girlfriend with too many guy friends. Hey, old doctor bill. I'm a 21 year old Kyle College student and I started dating this girl at my school five months ago. Things seem to be going great, but unfortunately we've been away from each other this summer because we're from different states. We talk almost every day, but there are some days when I never hear from her at all. I just see her posting different things she does with their friends on social media. I would have a problem with, I wouldn't have a problem with it except hang on a second. What the fuck? Broccoli. It's just never done.

Speaker 3:          00:59:06       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:59:07       I'm sorry guys. I promise I won't eat again on the podcast. It's really rude. I, I know, I know. It's horrible. Sorry. Uh, we talk about Bubba. I wouldn't have a problem with except the majority of the time it's with a group of dudes. She's always hanging out with five of her friends who were all guys and then a handful of times there's other girls there. Every time I see her post something about them, I feel jealous and angry that she's spending all his time with the other guys. Not only that, but her most recent posts was on a boat with all these guys wearing prob wearing probably her most revealing bikini. I haven't met any of these guys, so I definitely don't trust any of them. And whenever she's with them and I text her, she takes hours to respond or even weights to the next day.

Speaker 1:          00:59:51       I want to bring it up how I feel about that, but I don't want to make it feel like I'm telling her who she can and can hang out with. So what do you think I should do? Bring it up? Um, that I don't like how she hangs out with other guys. It just shut the fuck up and trust that she's not up to anything. Uh, it would be great to hear from Nir. Thanks. Uh, what, Nia, thanks to get a female perspective too. I wish she was here right now because, uh, you're going to get my perspective. Um, anyways, sorry for the long email. Hopefully it didn't, I didn't use too many big words for Yag. Go Fuck Yourself. Um, what do I think about that? Uh, yeah, that's kind of weird. I mean, what would she think if you were fucking hanging out with like five other broads and you awareness speedo when he got, didn't get back to her the next day, she probably thinks that you were fucking around, right? So I would just, I would just say to us, hey, listen, I'm not trying to be a jerk here, but, uh, you know, when you post, you know, when you're hanging out, you seem to only be hanging out with other guys. You were on boats, you were in skimpy bikinis. It's, it's making me feel uncomfortable here. All right. She's like, you know, try it. Just go, look, I'm just communicating that it, it kind of makes me uncomfortable. Um,

Speaker 1:          01:01:12       yeah, this is real difficult. Without, you seem like you're fucking checking in on her and being like a jerk, but just, just ask her just so let me ask you this. If you know, if I didn't, if I text you and I didn't get back, if you text me and I didn't get back to you for a whole full fucking 24 hours,

Speaker 2:          01:01:29       all right.

Speaker 1:          01:01:31       And then you see a picture on Facebook and I'm standing there with my ball bag all in a bunch, you know, all watered up like a fucking pack parachutes hanging out with like five chicks on a boat. I mean, when you kind of be like, you know, dude, what the fuck? Just ask her, am I out of line here? Then also tell it to, and please tell me, you know, if you're not feeling it anymore and you want to hook up with other guys, just let me know early on. So you know, the heartache is way less. Just let me know. All right? But, uh, I, dude, I don't think that it's weird that you're uncomfortable with that. That is fucking weird.

Speaker 2:          01:02:17       MMM.

Speaker 1:          01:02:20       You know, hanging out with five guys and you're most revealing fucking Bikini gimme it. You know what the fuck you're doing. No, those are just my guy friends. All right. Now I'm getting annoyed. How? What are you a fucking attention whore? What's, I'm going to say all the shit that you can't say to her. This is all the shit you're thinking and you're totally justified to think of it and don't listen to any fucking brides would tell you anything different because if you were doing it, they give you the exact same fucking shit. All right, I got my foot nine. This one. All right. Just ask her. Just ask her what is, what's, you know, don't stone at a time tone than I'm doing a bigger, you've got to ask what the fuck's going on here? You know, honey, with all due respect, yeah, me, you fucking, it looks like you're in a sausage factory there.

Speaker 1:          01:02:59       You know, wearing your little skimpy fucking outfit. What's going on? Be One thing. If you were there with one of your girlfriends and even then I'm thinking a little five on to action, right? What's going on? I don't know what to tell you, dude. That's, that's a fucked up situation. Uh, it might be just how she likes. She may be honest. I don't like other girls that don't get along with another girl. She may be one of those fucking people all really, you're like hanging out with guys or one of your door with some fucking clothes on. How about that? You know, how about this, can we, can we make a rule that a, you know, you gotta put on some fucking clothes when you hang out with these guys. How about that? Cause you know, you're just going to get pissed and then you're gonna start hanging out with some checks and just to piss her off.

Speaker 1:          01:03:36       You're going to start taking fucking pictures and now return her fucking texts for a day and you start doing that childish shit rather than just getting right to the fucking media. The heart of the matter there. Right. The meat of the matter. I'm looking at it. That's how much, instead of saying the hardest said the meet, that's how much I'm fucking hate.

I'm going to finish this fucking plead a fucking Broccoli and cauliflower and all that horseshit. If tomorrow morning, you know what? As much as this sucks, I'm going to feel like 1 million bucks and my stomach's going to be a little flatter, right? You gotta be willing to sacrifice Jesus Christ. I, you know what, I'm so fucking bummed out. Rain. Oh Kitty even fucking, uh, I actually, you know, it's funny, once you, the English people told me that bummed out means you got fucked in the ass. I can't even say that anymore. Well what, what's, what, what is the real word that I'm trying to say? I'm a little melancholy right now. A melancholy with the cauliflower.
