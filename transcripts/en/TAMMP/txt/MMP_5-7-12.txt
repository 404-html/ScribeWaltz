Speaker 1:          00:00:01       Hey, what's going on? It's bill burn. It's the Monday morning podcast for Monday, May 7th, 2012 2012 baby. What's going on? Do you guys have a, why am I yelling? Why am I yelling? You know why? Cause I've got a good night's sleep and I just had some waffles so I got dead fucking sugar rush. Yeah, I made, Ooh, just slam my computer. It gives a fuck. I can't figure out how to work in any ways. Um, I had um, I had some waffles for breakfast. Now why did you just shut off? You can't. Oh, I see it just sorta Jesus built everything that technology does is not an attack on you. Why don't you just relax? I need, hang on guys. I just need to talk to myself for a second. All right.

Speaker 2:          00:00:46       Just sit and think. Figure out what happened. Stop taking the bait. All right. I'm back.

Speaker 1:          00:00:54       Yeah, it's in fucking waffles. I actually made them yesterday. I'm gonna take you guys through my boring day. It sounds like the beginning of a Bruce Springsteen song, doesn't it?

Speaker 3:          00:01:00       Hi. Made so waffles. It was over. [inaudible] up. Oh my God. How does he turn it around the breakfast limericks from that guy.

Speaker 1:          00:01:12       You know what, it's one of my goals to see him live in concert because I've been making fun of him forever and half of my friends had been making fun of them and then they go see him in concert and they were like, dude, you got to go see that guy in concert, you know with his class 300 bike. Um, he's got, he's got a, he's got one of those. I don't know if he was a dog. He'd be one of those dogs with the motion faces. You know, he's got one of those boxer. I'm the same dentition of like a boxer or like a pug.

Speaker 2:          00:01:39       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:01:41       What the fuck? Can't get done. Pugs not breathe or something. I know they have the motion face, but like I always hear bulldogs have the worst time trying to breathe, but like pugs have the most look of panic on their face. Like when bulldogs can't breathe, they just say hi, ask gonna to fucking lay down here. They just seem like a tub of shit dog. We're like pugs, like genuinely seemed concerned about something the way their eyes bug out or do they have like that high metabolism, you know when you have something wrong with your thyroid, is that the right word? Huh? Do I have any doctors that listen to this? Anyways, it made waffles yesterday and the lovely Nia is killing it and now she's working out. She's on this. Um, I'm going to be a fucking even hotter chick diet. Right? So she can't eat anything.

Speaker 1:          00:02:26       All right. In the end, you know the ladies, okay, they got all that fucking hormonal shit going on every goddamn month, you know, stuff fucking, I dunno what, there's always something going on with them. You know, they're basically, it's like living with an addict when you live with the woman, you know, they always got, he's got some shit coming up, man. They always that same bullshit. So now you compound it with the fact, now she's on some special diet. So she's basically detoxing from whatever fucking, you know how people eat, you know, eat right. Do you get the sugar, salt rush? The ETU totally stuffed. You

Speaker 4:          00:03:00       mentally think that's what eating is. So then when you actually eat the way you supposed to and your body isn't like freaking out, like fucking Freightos, right. It's actually just chillin with some fucking broccoli and some protein. You're not used to that. You know you're used to go into some high energy shit. So anyways, I'm sitting there making the waffles right. And you don't, one of those deals when you check goes on a fucking diet. All of a sudden you have to be on the Diet too. You know? Are you just doing this to torture me? No, I'm doing it cause I liked fucking waffles. I felt like having some waffles. Oh my God, I have to sit here. I have to eat one time soup for breakfast. Hey my fault. You know I'm not on a diet and then they do all that shit when they always try to make it seem, it's easier to be a guy. Guys can lose weight though. It's easier. It's so much harder for women that Baba Baba buy we you fucking outlive us.

Speaker 5:          00:04:04       Isn't that enough?

Speaker 4:          00:04:06       Isn't that enough? I'm going to die before you do. Okay. What is your problem with the soup? Jesus fucking Christ Jesus Christ.

Speaker 4:          00:04:18       So anyways, that's what I'm fucking dealing with. And I actually had a major victory, just one of those silent victories that you have in your relationship. You know, those are the best ones to have. We don't say anything and you see it in their face and you see that they realize it and then you see them wondering if you realize it and you kind of look back and I'm like, I do realize it, but I'm not going to say it because then you'll be able to, if I say it out loud, just somehow fucking do some sort of two point reversal and bring up some other shit and then I'll lose, you know, I'll just fucking shoot that look right back at you. Like that's right. Woman. I won this one. Okay. You're gonna have to wait for another fight because this one is,

Speaker 5:          00:04:54       oh, okay.

Speaker 4:          00:04:56       It's fucking Michael Corleone says, and the Godfather to, okay.

Speaker 5:          00:05:03       MMM,

Speaker 4:          00:05:05       I got a, I got to steal that at some point. I want to be an argument with Nia. I can't be a real long cause she'll get mad. I'm just going to do it over something stupid. Like she wants to go see this cabin in the woods fucking movie. Whatever the hell it is. It's supposed to be a perfect movie. Uh, what does that mean? The guy gives into the woman? Oh Jesus. A minor fucking mood. Can I blame it on the Syrup here? People who was the Syrup out in Jersey? I can't say out in Jersey. That's Anthony's impression of him. I owe him fucking 50 cents right there. Some residuals. Um, hey Anthony. Cool. Mia. Everybody from the opiate Anthony Program with little Jimmy Norton, um, on Xm satellite radio. Yeah, little promo. The fuck was I just talking about? God dammit. Leave it on the syrup. Ah, Shit. That thought's gone. Oh, I know. I had this minor victory at this minor of victory. Right? I'm on the road hauling the root again, right. Doing my Dick Jokes on the road again. I don't give a fuck about you or your friend. Buy My DVD and get the fuck out of my face. Um,

Speaker 4:          00:06:16       I should have fucking waffles. You know what, this little podcast, it's going to die. And like fucking 12 minutes in, I'm just going to sugar crash. We're going to be laying on the rug like that fucking dude and train spotting, but instead of like falling into it, I'm just going to nod off like a fucking, like a goddamn dog with a machined face. Oh, we brought it around. What's the do? Um, so anyways, yeah, it was the victory I had. Um, so I was on the road doing my jokes. I come back to town. All right. And uh, and is always, somehow when I was away, something got broken and nobody knows as any fucking idea. It's like my car, I don't know what happens when I take it out. Nobody ever really hits it. Somehow. When Nia takes it out, somebody always hits it and then I go out and she doesn't say shit. I go out to use the car and I see some side swiped down the fucking side of the car and I just go, I come in, I go, has somebody hit the car? And that she's always like,

Speaker 5:          00:07:14       well, when did that help?

Speaker 4:          00:07:19       How many times can I fall for that? Do people just not like you when you drive the car? That 1:00 AM I talking about somebody tagged it? Fuck, a month ago when I went over Chris Porter's somebody fucking tag my car. Um, but anyway, so I come back and once again something's broken. I'm the blender. The blender was busted, you know, the engine work, but the little fucking teeth, things were broken. So she's just like, we needed a new blender. I can't make my skinny girl Margarita is anymore because the teeth don't work, so let's throw it, but the fucking motor works. So I go, well, why don't we just get a fixed? And she's like, oh, cause she knows what that means. Why don't we get it fixed? That means it's going to sit there for three years before I finally bring it over to a repair shop.

Speaker 4:          00:08:03       All right, but not, not now. Not all new fix it Billy. I said you know what? I'm going to figure out how to fucking fix that God damn thing. All I did. You know what? It was all like I just want it. All you have to do is just look up to the fucking, you get the, I know this is basic to some people but for a lot of morons and there's a lot that listened to this podcast by the way. No offense, non taken. Um, all you do is just whatever the brand and then the serial number. You go on the Internet and you can, you just buy the part. So I buy the fucking part thinks shows up. I do all this shit without talking to Nia. Right? And I fucking, I go to take this thing apart, turn it upside down and I'm fucking pulling, trying to pull the motor on it and we'll come out because that thing on the top and I'm like what the fuck? And then he's going youtube and I found a video of a guy doing, fixing the problem I had.

Speaker 1:          00:08:56       I didn't need to unscrew the bottom. All I need to do was just

Speaker 4:          00:08:59       fucking get a screwdriver and take the thing off the top. Which how it doesn't strip the top. I have no fucking idea. We don't care. Bill. Get to the point. All right. Long Story Short, I get this fucking thing on. It works. So what do I do? Do I get in her face and say, yeah, a woman, I fucking fix that shit. I don't.

Speaker 5:          00:09:17       Yeah,

Speaker 4:          00:09:17       I don't. I fix it. Make sure it runs. I try it out and then I just stick it in the cupboard, you know? And a couple of days later I go, hey, you know what to think I'd like a milkshake. Well, how are you going to do this? The planner, does it work? Oh, I fixed it.

Speaker 4:          00:09:37       You fixed it. I fixed it. It was no big deal. Took it apart. I got a a fucking fix to myself. There you go, woman. All right with your whole, we need to fucking go buy another one. You know, I realize that wasn't really a major victory even though like when you're just in your head, do you like, yeah, I fucking dominated. Then I just said that out loud. That was really no big deal. It's a seven. Does, how much I wanted to fix it. It was a $7 part and I had it overnighted for like fucking 16 bucks.

Speaker 1:          00:10:05       So you know, and I didn't even want a milkshake. I just wanted to show her that I did something. I don't know why. Why? Because I'm a weak person and I need other people's approval there. Does that make you happy? Does that make you feel, does that make you smile and you're fucking cubicle?

Speaker 4:          00:10:19       Uh Huh. Is that what you're doing

Speaker 1:          00:10:24       when you were in a cubicle and you're smiling? I've, if I was your boss, I would immediately think that you're somehow stealing from the company because there's no reason to smile on it.

Speaker 4:          00:10:31       Pure in a cubicle, in a computer, in a cubicle. There's no fucking reason. All right. Unless you somehow figured out a way to be happy, you know, some sort of, when those Zen Douche bags, why they douche though? Because they're happy. You know what happened to you? All right. What the fuck am I going to talk about? I was going to do, oh, I know. We have to talk about everybody. This is very special. Guess what it is this Sunday?

I want this to happen. Get on. It's scientists. Right? So he had a part in it too, you know, although they never bring that up on the view. Do they? Um, believe it or not, this is advertising.

Um, all right, moving on here a little bit on what the hell am I going to talk about? Oh, you know, I went, I went into a bar last night. Oh, yesterday afternoon because the games come on early because um, I finally accepted the fact emotionally that my Boston Bruins have been knocked out of the Stanley Cup playoffs. And uh,

Speaker 6:          00:15:07       okay.

Speaker 4:          00:15:07       I've actually, you guys know my hatred of NBA basketball. You know, I don't hate, I don't hate it. I just had finals three minutes. It drives me nuts with all the time outs. And I know I brought it up before any, what's even worse is when they call the time outs. I notice yesterday cause I watched a game is then they start reading copy. You know, like anything they can do to just bring the drama all the way back down to zero. It's like tide fucking 98 98. Oh, they got, they got 28 files to give and then they followed so and sell calls a time out. And then next thing you know, they're sitting there reading, you know, like what I just did bro. flowers.com. Yes. Your mother is some fucking, you know, that's stupid. I don't know. So anyways, I've accepted the fact that the Bruins are out of the playoffs and all right, well the bees are out. Yo, why don't we go watch the fucking sees kid. You know what I'm saying? So Celtics were playing the Atlanta Hawks who used to be the Saint Louis Hawks and we beat them in 1958 I believe for their NBA title. That's right. Saint Louis. We own your ass in a sport you don't even know about anymore. Um, back when Eisenhower was an office. Um, so I watched that game and it was just a phenomenal playoff games as far as like being a fan because it was over before it even started,

Speaker 4:          00:16:30       you know, it was over and there was never a concern. They were up by 30 points and I sat there drinking beer and eating wings, becoming fucking, oh, fat boy, Billy again, Billy fat again. It's my Irish neighbor. So I'm, so I'm sitting there right with a buddy of mine, right watching the game. We're having a great time and right. And like the fourth quarter, uh, these four girls, four or five girls come in and it's a dive bar. You know, I like to dive bars. You can get as a place to sit, you know,

Speaker 4:          00:17:04       it's just one of those deals. Somebody has one of those fucking [inaudible] character in 48 hours. You know, they always, there's always one of those cars parked out front, some fucking piece of shit. Rag Top with some sad dog in the backseat. Right? I like those bars. You know the bar fly car, right? So I walk in there, we're watching the game and like fucking with like a, I dunno, five minutes to go in the game. So what's that like two hours NBA time? These like five, six chicks come in and they're just like, they just train wrecks all of them wearing pants where you can just see that clams, you know, ridiculously tight pants and other girls got these cutoffs with this, her hat turns sideways looking like she's in some fucking fresh prince video in the late eighties. It just, they were just absolute messes and they start putting money into the juke box and they just start singing. They started to sing along to a video, killed the radio star. Right. And then they just start, you know, and then there's all these fucking old guys Barfly fucking Jack Offs like my age and a little bit older, like way too fucking old for these checks. Right. And these girls are being like really fucking loud. Yes.

Speaker 1:          00:18:17       And they're fucking dancing with each other and they're grabbing each other's asses, doing all this shit. And you see these guys up at the bar, the liar, they start like

Speaker 4:          00:18:29       reacting to this sex fucking energy depth they're putting out there. So two of the girls stand up. They started, that's what it got dude. It was like the fucking accused, like times five was going down. The whole vibe was fucking ridiculous. So the two girls stand up, they start like dancing, grinding up against each other, and then one of the guys eventually like some big fucking sex star bear starts walking over and starts pawn at the girl. And then the girl's like, hey, knock it off. Get the fuck Outta here. Right. And my buddy classic looks at me and goes, she facilitated that entire fucking thing. And it's like, exactly. Fuck. It was a, I don't know if there was strippers, I don't know what the fucking deal was, but um, it was just one of

Speaker 1:          00:19:15       the thing that I've always said, we got to have responsibility for your own fucking safety. Obviously that guys shouldn't just feel that he should be able to walk over and start pawn at some girl. But you know, when you sit in there with your clam fucking outlined on the front of your fucking jeans and you're grinding up

Speaker 4:          00:19:33       against her, your friend and your polling or jacket off and she's going, stop it, stop it, and you keep pulling it off. I mean, what the fuck do you think's going to happen? You know, I fuck. You know, there's nothing worse than when people act like the world is a perfect place. And then they act shocked when something bad happens. It isn't. Okay. There's the way you wish the world was and the way it is, so fucking act accordingly. You don't go in there with your fucking hoo ha hanging out and start grinding up on your friend in front of fucking five drunk guys who were women haven't done a double take at since the fucking, I dunno, Fernando Valance, weightless struck out the side. Okay,

Speaker 1:          00:20:19       sign the wrong people. It was just, it was a really fucking uncomfortable vibe. And I looked at my phone, I go, look, we don't get out of here in three minutes. We're going to be testifying in about fucking six weeks for whatever bullshits about ready to go down. And you know what kills me is no one at the bar stop them from doing what they were doing. You know, I was trying to think what the fuck and male version of what they were doing would be. I guess it would be like acting aggressive and almost causing like a fight vibe. All right. But you know, then you get tossed out. But women could, can create the accused vibe and uh, I dunno, I'm probably going to get shit for this, but like, you know, I'm not advocating what that guy did that what Jack Guy Did was fucking wrong, but Jesus fucking Christ. What did your dad do? Did He vote by like Fisher price? How to be a whore? Did they make like a, remember those little fucking stereos they made? Did they make like a fucking

Speaker 6:          00:21:17       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:21:17       The whore version of that? I Dunno, I'm at that age. People, I'm at that age where I look at women like that and I don't go like, well, there's an easy mark. I now look at them, go and like God, Jesus Christ. What a fuck was your dad? What didn't he do? Um, but anyways,

Speaker 4:          00:21:34       what was actually funny was for some, this is how drunk they were as they were grinding on each other and fucking pulling up each other's dresses and doing all this shit. The fucking for whatever reason,

Speaker 1:          00:21:45       uh,

Speaker 4:          00:21:46       out of nowhere they just started singing the star spangled banner and then the guys at the bar joined in and I have video of it. I'm going to send it to my guy and hopefully we'll get it up on the site. I got it like halfway through they sang the whole fucking song. And what was funny was that whole fucking is somebody going to get raped, vibe went out the window, both sides for like a good three minutes. We're in harmony with some sort of support the troops vibe just out of fucking nowhere. And I, this is the funniest thing about it. This was probably like seven in the evening. This is how fucking wasted everybody was.

Speaker 1:          00:22:26       Um, all right, plowing ahead here. Um, oh, whatever women, what do you think about that? Am I being the fucking caveman there? I'm not advocating that. I'm saying that those guys, what they did was right, but like you can't I that's like, it's like me, like I've always said this. That's like me walking through central park at like three in the morning dress like Liberace singing. I'm in the money.

Speaker 7:          00:22:49       Oh Man. The money at that photo. Fucking cash in my back pocket. Right?

Speaker 4:          00:22:56       Someone comes up, smashes me over the head. I get a concussion. I got fucking my cheekbones fucked up. You know, they take my wallet and all that Shit. Does it wrong? Yes. Do you feel bad from a yes, but what the fuck was I thinking?

Speaker 6:          00:23:13       Yeah.

Speaker 4:          00:23:13       You know, why don't you just fucking give yourself a bunch of paper cuts and junk jumping shark infested water and then fucking go and then it bit my leg off. You're an asshole. That's bad. That's, that's my side of it.

Speaker 1:          00:23:27       Relationship Advice. Follow up. Success Story. Dare is Derris billion. You may or may not remember a couple months ago I emailed you about some relationship advice. To recap, 22 years old, been with my girlfriend for seven years. Most of it long, distant, smallest things that happened from time to time, which made me doubt I could trust her. I gave the example of the Strip poker thing she lied about and the business trip where she said a coworker tried to kiss her. Oh yeah. I gotta be honest with you dude. I get a lot of emails like that. So, uh, and I, I've been that guy. I was that guy when I was 23. Um, anyways, he goes, you sent me a very clear message, pull the rip cord. I'm just writing to let you know that I did take your advice and although it was probably the hardest thing I've ever had to do was 100% the right call.

Speaker 1:          00:24:16       So thank you for giving me the extra nudge I needed. Hopefully in the future I can be a fucking man about these things and you just do what needs to be done. Um, through most of the relationship fall out. Now I did have to tell her to get fucked when she kept wanting to get back together. She didn't seem to understand that all of the reason we broke up would still be their bottom line. I'm happier than I've been in a long time. Thanks man. Oh yeah. Well there you go. And that's the hardest thing too, is when they're coming back to you because as you're thinking is your brain up top is going. This is wrong. You're out. Stay out. Your Dick is going Free Pussy, dad, Jeffrey all wants to fray policy. All right, that's what you dick saying. So you have to override that.

Speaker 1:          00:25:03       And uh, I got to be honest with you, the only reason why she was getting back with you was just to get with you till she was mentally prepared to walk away from you so she could pull the ripcord and uh, that's the worst. So you avoided all of that. So now this is what you do, son. Um, go out and have a good time and don't get involved with anybody that you don't feel you're going to marry. All right? Is this the mother of my kids? All right. Go Fuck Yourself. And that's how you do it until you meet the one that is. And then that's the one that's the one you gave your heart to. But other than that, fuck all of them. Fuck them. All right? I don't mean that misogynistic way, but just, you know, when you fucking, you know, two, three dates in and the day, it doesn't feel fucking weird. You know, it's this start, it doesn't feel right. I mean it's still feeling weird, you know, at that point, all she has at your place is maybe a scrunchie or some sort of fucking a toiletry. The just getting this out, dawn, you go beat it and you don't have to be mean. You just be honest. Just say, listen, I, I really like you. You're a nice person. I just don't see this a longterm. So rather than waste your time and my time and then I suppose getting really hurt, we'll just just leave right now.

Speaker 1:          00:26:23       I believe this

Speaker 2:          00:26:23       does yours.

Speaker 1:          00:26:29       Um, all right, good for you sir. Good for you. All right, here we go. Pissed off. Bay Area Fan. Who Mice, who's also might be cops. What? All right, thanks for canceling the Sunday show. San Jose.

Speaker 4:          00:26:43       You Ginger. Fuck. Oh yeah, I'm doing San Jose coming up and I had to, I couldn't, I can't do the Sunday show. I had to cancel that one. So evidently this guy says at least 10 of us bought tickets to the show and as a boozy and had a boozy work night night out, planned around it, uh, to say we were looking forward to it would be an understatement. We are not some random group of amateurs either. We are dedicated fans, faithful podcasts, listeners, we came out to see you last time you were in San Jose and we even stood in line to meet you, uh, by, by the DVDs and buy the DVDs. Man. Some of us were even women. And not only that, we actually, we've actually been polarized, polarizing on behalf on your behalf and one you several, several new fans who also bought tickets to the Sunday show. One guy's bitch wife only allows him out one night per year and this was going to be his 2012 hour in Jesus Christ. Dude, you're killing me. We've told him you're a standup guy. How do we tell him you've thrown us over and are scurrying out to Chicago to suck up to Vince Vaughn. Douche. Move Mr Burr. Douche. Move. Hey,

Speaker 1:          00:27:58       what about the other two nights? I'm going there. First of all, stop acting like San Jose. It's like some blue chip fucking city. All right. San Jose only can look down to Bakersfield. You look in eye to eye at Sacramento. All right? You're both the chicks with the good personalities. All right? But we all know the Hottie is San Francisco. Okay, listen, I apologize. It's something I have to do. Um,

Speaker 1:          00:28:30       it, it'll make sense in a few months. It'll make sense in a couple of months. Why had do what the fuck I'm doing? I don't talk about the shit that I, that I'm doing because most of it get, doesn't get picked up. It gets swatted back down to the ground. So why fucking bring up, oh, hey, I just did this. And allegedly it has the opportunity to do that and then nothing happens. And then it's bad enough. It doesn't happen. Then you have to deal with people going, hey, whatever happened to that thing. Oh, if it failed, it crashed. Didn't

Speaker 4:          00:29:03       burn. So, uh, I, yeah, I have to go to Chicago. It's a fucking loyalty thing. All right. You think I wouldn't like to spend another fucking night in San Jose? I love San Jose. I don't like this shy. I don't like you. You're a hockey team. I respect your fans though. You've got great fans up there, so I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Julie, Jim, Dave, Mikey, Joey, Joey's girlfriend, Rico, Bill, and several others. All right, you fucking babies. Um, and he goes, no, we can't. Oh, let ps, no, we can't just come Friday, Saturday shows instead because we work. Those nights were in a local law enforcement. Oh Shit. They have guns. Um, yeah, my fault. I'll make it up to you and I'll see at the policeman's ball. Um, there's no way we can get the night off Saturday, Sunday night. Was it man? All right. All Right Joe, over what you think?

Speaker 4:          00:29:53       I'm not coming back. Shit. You know what? You're good. You got me with the guilt. You did. You got me with the guilt. Hey, how about those La Kings? Everybody's. Anybody else watching of the fucking playoffs? The La Kings for the first time since the Gretzky era. And as far as I know, I didn't look this up. I think only the second time when their history, they've made it to the western conference finals, at least as far as when I've been paying attention. I don't ever remember him there. Back when they had those yellow and purple Laker jerseys on. Um,

Speaker 6:          00:30:26       okay.

Speaker 4:          00:30:27       I Dunno. And the country devil's keep beating the flyers. I thought the flyers. I'm not saying it's over. God knows it's not over. When it's a fucking flight. It came back down. Oh three against my Bruins. Um, but the devils are just so fucking country, you know what I mean? And I mean that with all due respect, I hate it when they played the trap and all that type of shit. But sons of bitches, man, they played very, they played like dead disciplined hockey, right? Disciplined. Um, I don't know. All right, let's plow ahead here. What do we got? What are we get next? All right, Dell. Is it racist, racist, racist. Machinic addition. Um, what is this man? Fuck a machinic. It's a Murdoch owned paper. Enough said. What is machinic? What the fuck? What is this throwback? Is it racist? Machinic edition? I have no idea what this means. It says as long as the nets are allowing Jz to call their marketing shots. What a shock that he chose black and white as the new team colors to stress as the nets explained their new urban home. Why not have him apply the full Jz treatment? Why the Brooklyn Nets when they,

Speaker 4:          00:31:53       they can be the New York words. What the fuck is this? The cheerleaders should be the Brooklyn bitches or hoes team logo. A nine millimeter. What the fuck is this?

Speaker 6:          00:32:08       Okay.

Speaker 4:          00:32:09       Oh, oh, oh, this is Phil mushed. Nick. Oh, filled, mushed. Nick wrote this. Oh, okay. Phil Mutchnik is this guy who's just, he's never in a good mood. He could be getting a two on one on a sunny day in the middle of winter and he would still find a reason to complain about stuff. And that's funny coming from me because I'm one of the biggest concern over was all right, Phil Mutchnik. This is what he wrote about Jay z owning the nets in um, Brooklyn. Okay, now I get it. He says, as long as the nets are along Jay z to call their marketing shots. Well why shouldn't they? It's America. He had the money, but the team, uh, what a shock that he chose black and white as the new team logos to stress as the nets explain their new urban home.

Speaker 6:          00:32:52       Okay.

Speaker 4:          00:32:53       Why not have them apply the full Jz treat treatment? Why the Brooklyn Nets when they could be the New York, New York and words that Shelia is, could be the Brooklyn bitches or hoes team logo. A nine millimeter with hollow tip shell casings strewn beneath. Want to be JC hip than go all the way. Ah, Jesus. That's just stupid. Well, isn't black and white? Isn't that inclusive?

Speaker 6:          00:33:19       Okay.

Speaker 4:          00:33:20       Like there's only black and white people in Brooklyn, but I'm just saying, you know why st nine millimeters is a whole Hasidic population. There's the, uh, growing up Gadi Oh, population out there.

Speaker 6:          00:33:32       Okay.

Speaker 4:          00:33:33       Brooklyn is a,

Speaker 6:          00:33:36       okay.

Speaker 4:          00:33:36       Oh, Phil, I think he is, he just, anyways, he says, Bill, is this racist? There's this Asian girl that I work with who has a bit of an eye condition that is slowly, oh, this is a whole different thing.

Speaker 2:          00:33:46       Ah,

Speaker 4:          00:33:51       I love this guy was tying that in. I'm sorry, I'm just a fucking idiot right now. I told you the Syrup it's was wearing off the sugar rush or whatever his fucking wearing down here.

Speaker 2:          00:33:59       MMM.

Speaker 4:          00:34:02       Yeah. Why did he do that? Is he trying to be the next, uh, who's that guy with the cowboy hat? Yeah. Wow. That guy. Um, he's mad that their, that their colors are black and white. What is wrong with black and white?

Speaker 4:          00:34:19       It's not like the nets had a classic uniform. I thought then they're uniform was hideous. They had that, that gray with the red and the White was awful. I think it's cool that there's a team in Brooklyn. Oh, Phil Mush. Nick, why don't you go get yourself a Sunday? You have miserable bastard. All right. Coming from me. All right, Bill, is this racist, racist, racist? Uh, there's this Asian girl that I work with who was a bit of an eye condition that is slightly but definitely noticeable. She's not cross out. She's not cross side, but something is definitely a skew. You can tell she's looking at you, but one I kind of drifts off into no man's land. Yeah. Lazy Eye. Now normally Google, Google the eyes would be a pretty big turnoff. Right. But she almost seems more are learning because of it. This had me wondering if Asian women can pull off this look better than other nationalities. Uh, a mainstream example of this would be Lucy Lu. She had set an eye thing going on. I'll be it a slight thing, but she's revered as a hottie. Compare that to a Caucasian Bobby. Bobby Bet. Sia, the CNN anchor that Nancy Walls did an impression of, or African Americans. Stuart Scott.

Speaker 6:          00:35:35       Okay.

Speaker 4:          00:35:36       A lesser example. He's a male. Is it racist of me to believe Asian may have the edge when it comes to public overlooking their lazy eyes? If so, do you think it's due to their eyes being almost that's detracting from the wonkiness?

Speaker 1:          00:35:54       Ah, Jesus. Dude, I think you just think this girl is hot.

Speaker 4:          00:35:59       You know, when you'd rather bang her then Stuart Scott, I think it's really that simple. Um, I don't know who know who half those other people are. I don't watch CNN or Fox News. I find it, uh,

Speaker 6:          00:36:12       I don't know.

Speaker 4:          00:36:14       I just find both those, they're totally slanted and opera sit direction. So I never watched that shit. And that Stuart Scott is battling a for his life. I believe so. Uh, I dunno dude. I think you just want to fucking, I think he just, I just think you want to bang this girl. Um, I think that's why you've, I think you like Asian chicks regardless of whether their eyes are looking at you are not looking at you. You, you like them. So, you know, when I say sir, I say, go for it. You know, go get yourself a beautiful girl. You know, it's great she can buy them because we will do what I was gonna do an easy jokes that I'm not doing it. All right.

Speaker 1:          00:36:53       Okay. Here we go. Bill. Uh, want to bang lesbian friend who was in lesbian remission.

Speaker 6:          00:37:00       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:37:00       Jesus. Okay, this is outside my realm, but I'll, I'll try and answer it. Hey Bill, I want your opinion on this problem. I have. I'm a 19 year old college freshman and I'm in a bit of an ethical dilemma. I have this friend who was a lesbian and recently she has been, she hasn't been having any luck with the ladies.

Speaker 6:          00:37:18       Okay?

Speaker 1:          00:37:18       So now she's feeling vulnerable to the point that she's active, actually contemplating about fucking this guy. She knows after she tells me this, I start getting jealous because I've always had sexual feelings for her, but never acted on them because she's a lesbian and I respected her dude. What kind of a fucking asshole are you?

Speaker 4:          00:37:38       You know, why are you hanging out with her? We were just waiting for daylight. What? What are you doing? She's a lesbian. She doesn't want to fuck you. You

Speaker 1:          00:37:50       just sitting in an edit yet. It's a dried up wealth. It's over. Walk away. What else does it, well, I guess she's a lesbian. Maybe she's into some. Uh, I dunno. Did she fix cars like you? I have no idea what that, ah, is there anything worse than a guy just hovering around? You know, rather than going out and just like, I dunno what you're waiting for. Just plenty of fish in the sea in 19. Well, but you know what? I'm being too hard on you. You're 19 years old. You have no idea how Cleo,

Speaker 4:          00:38:23       can you help me out with this one? Oh, you got to go real quick. You got to go. This guy's trying to bang this lesbian girl who was in lesbian remission.

Speaker 1:          00:38:36       It means she hasn't, she's wanting to like hook up with some other ladies, but they're not given it to her. She'll, she's actually been contemplating fucking this other guy. So now this dude's jealous cause he's always been hanging around her. I mean that conversation we had earlier. That's why guy guys hanging around. Women, either the gay guy or they're trying to fuck you. There's really no other discipline. All right. Why wish you could hang here? All right, cool. Have Fun. Huh? All right. That's nice stuff. Your fans thought that you were coming on and now you're not, you're leaving them wanting more. You'll, you'll leave them wanting more. Can we do this real quick? It has to be very quickly. Okay. So I told you what's going on. Yeah, I'll get out of here. Um, anyways, but now that she's in the mood to go to going back to fucking dudes, some other Douche is feeling her up.

Speaker 1:          00:39:24       Even before I knew what was happening. So this other guy got in there. He goes, I don't want to make her my book girlfriend. We both made it very clear. Neither of us are good at being in relationships because we're both selfish people. I did not want, however, I do want to fuck her once, and I tried asking my cousin for his point of view on the situation, but he recently found Jesus, so the only answer is to give. He gives me his read the Bible or premarital sex is a sin. What do you think? Should I sleep with her before she fucks this guy and realize she doesn't like men and ruin any chance? I have a wait. Should I try? Oh, should I try to sleep with her before this guy fucks her and she realizes she doesn't like men and ruin any chance I have or should I just go just be the friend and do nothing. Thanks.

Speaker 1:          00:40:09       Are there no other women around for you to fuck that you're just completely is singularly focused on and obsessed with this girl who's a lesbian? That's exactly what I said. Why are you hovering around her? That's what I want. Is it because you can't have her or like it's it's a, it's a chase thing or it's a struggle that he his leg how what it is. I bet that the same, the same height and they can borrow each other's clothes. Just leave it. I was wondering where you going to wear that flannel to like cause I feel like getting involved sexually with anyone who's having like going back and forth with their sexuality and figuring out is probably not a good idea. Just cause there's probably a lot of emotional shit going on along with that that she may not talk about and you may not be aware of.

Speaker 1:          00:40:52       I would just leave it alone. Yeah. Why don't you just go talk to a girl that wants to bang a guy? Why don't you make it a lot easier? Make it a lot easier on yourself. Hey, how do I turn this bus into a bicycle? I've always wanted this bus to be a bicycle and a, now it's a men like the chase though, right? The you have the layer. We'd like a layup. I thought men are all about the chase and make it difficult and all that. I thought, oh, that's what you guys are into. You guys are ready to just making it difficult. We want you guys just to fucking just lie down or recline, stop acting like it doesn't feel good for you to, you know, no, you know what it is there. There is as far as like a, a good feeling is when a woman is making it difficult and you'd tear through all that bullshit and you're able to make her a sitcom.

Speaker 1:          00:41:42       It rolling your eyes in the right. You've experienced that, haven't you? Well, yeah. This is the speech that you give before you tell people like, oh you, you, you are making it difficult. And that dude was cock blocking me and I fucking I that was that, that, that right there is like a, remember that year when when Tom Hanks went back to back Oscars, he's still a great actor, but you know, is that ever going to happen again? That's, that's my, that's my uh, sexual conquest. The night I brought you down, brought you down like a fucking will. The base on the Serengeti before. You didn't have to see what they do. They just take it away. Cleo, come on. Come on.

Speaker 1:          00:42:20       All right, well that's my, that's my 2 cents. Okay, so I'm gonna go now. Okay. All right. I'll see you have fun right there. Fucking female. Robocop. I can work it out like a maniac. I'm over here becoming a tub of shit. That's right. All right, I'll see you later. So there you go. Sir. This is what I think you should do. And we basically, both of us, you've got to stop hanging out with these girls that, uh, why are you doing that? You know, I know why you're doing it anyway. They want it because you can be like, Yo, my dick is so intoxicating. Even chicks a don't like Dick. Can't say no to my Dick. Oh, um, all right, let's read some advertising. Shall We? People, let's get on with it. Where the hell is it here? Oh, Christ. Where are we? Where are we?

It's a fucking bore fest, right? Um, she always has it on. So I fucking sit there and I listened to it, you know, and uh, but they were talking about the post office and how it's bankrupt and how they're going to be change. They're going to be closing a bunch of them soon. And a, at least this is what they were saying, unless they're super busy, they're going to be closing them.

Game Fly gameplay.com is another one. Do you know what I noticed yesterday when I was watching the NBA? They out.

How was that? Those raids? All right. Um, hey, remember she wakes up and telling you guys how I've been trying to get into learning how shit works and science and all that because I have such a poor science background. I have a youtube video of the week and it basically, it explains, um, how a differential works on your truck or your car. And it actually fucking blew my mind. Now the weird thing about this video is for some reason the first like six minutes of it, you have to sit through a policemen on motorcycles doing all these different formations and these x game tricks, it's a from like the 1940 so it has that world war two propaganda, you know, and uh, you know, they're holding onto each other's arms.

Speaker 1:          00:47:41       They're standing up riding around this whole little fucking Hitler youth sort of beginning thing. It's really weird, I guess at one point when the going around and trying to show the principles of a car going around the corner in the differential, but it's fucking amazing. Um, and I know a lot of you guys like bill, I don't give a fuck. I don't want to learn how to fix my car. And you know, when I say yes should do the, Becky had this no way. When you bring your car down to the dealership and you know, it's something simple but you just never read up on it, there's no way you don't feel like a bitch when you sit in there, you know, telling you I, you know, I didn't realize about the differential. I didn't realize that, uh, it, it also allows, I know it took all the torque from the engine and made it go 90 degrees, but I didn't realize it gave you back tires, the ability to turn independently.

Speaker 1:          00:48:25       That's what blew my mind because it never dawned on me that when you go around the corner, the inside tire has to go like wait a way, shorter distance than the outside tire. So if they're both turning at the same time, one of them would be sliding. I don't know which one. But, so I guess that makes sense. But for them to figure out a gear as to how to get those things to turn independently. It's just, it's fucking, it just, you just got to watch it. All right? And if you watch it, you're going to be like make and you're going to get fucking obsessed with it. And you're going to buy the owner's manual to your fucking car that is about a thousand pages thick and you're going to finally like, I've actually looking at like explosion drawings of like transmissions and, uh, my whole life I had no idea what a fucking transmit should look like.

Speaker 1:          00:49:12       Is this boring the shit out of all of you? Well, can I learn something though? I gotta be the sports talking more on for the rest of my fucking life. Um, hey, how about those New York Knicks? Everybody, they finally want to play off game. Congratulations to all New York Knicks fans. Unless you liked the Yankees, then you can go fuck yourselves. Um, ended a 13, a 13 game in a row. Play off game losing streak. I want to know what do you guys think? When will that ever get beaten? That's going to, that one's going to stand for awhile. I was actually tried to do the math on that. In order to duplicate that best case scenario, you only get swept two years in a row or two playoff trips in a row. Like best case scenario would be you, uh, were up three games to none one year, and then you lost four in a row, so you didn't get swept and this four losses, then you get swept two more times in a row.

Speaker 1:          00:50:19       That's 12. And then you lose the first game. And the next one, that's the best case scenario. The fucking, Nick's lost some playoff series when van Gundy was still there. They lost the last two games. So that was their first two loss. Then they got swept that six, they got swept again. That's 10. Then they lost the first three of this one. That's 13. I swear to God, if they lost yesterday, that 14, you would, they go. Only way somebody could beat that. You'd have to get swept three times in a fucking ruts, practically impossible. Um, and this is what kills me is Paul Versey, Old Jersey. [inaudible] New Jersey Zone, the pride of fucking red bank. He fucking, we got in this huge fucking debate. He fucking annoys the shit out of me with his praise of Madison Square Garden. Like he feels like, like this venue, like that is the most overrated fucking venue, I think in professional sports because it gets so much fucking cloud because it's in New York City, the Paris of the United States, and just because it's fucking there that everybody seems to forget the incredible lack of championships that have been one there.

Speaker 1:          00:51:45       Okay. The fucking New York rangers have one, one Stanley Cup since 1940 that's 72 fucking years. There's been one championship, one there. The New York Knicks haven't won since fucking Nixon resigned 40 fucking years. All right, and this dude is telling me ego first. He's always talking about how Jordan said that was his favorite place to play and he uses, this is out of the fight started. He told me that fucking the garden during game three was the loudest NBA game he's ever heard. And I'm like, really? Do you really think that it was louder than the Boston Garden or the La Forum when the Lakers and Celtics were playing a game? 70 you really think it was louder. Game three, Nick's verse the heat and you're down fucking two. Do you really think the venue was fucking louder? I mean, what do you base? And he goes, dude, this isn't about championships.

Speaker 1:          00:52:42       I'm like, it's not, I'm not saying it's about championships, but we were playing for championships so you're going to be even amped up even more. And he just keeps saying how they use that stupid fucking expression that that that Madison Square Garden, it's a mecca. It's a mecca for basketball and it's what people don't understand. I don't the understand what Mecca just meets people from around the world gathered there to gathering place. It's like if, if, if Madison Square Garden was in a mall, it would be a food court. People gathered from all over the mall. Some people came there to buy a dress, other people came there to buy a slack by some slacks, but they, they all in the food court to eat that shitty food. And yes, it is a basketball Mecca. People gather from around the globe to kick the next fucking ass every year if they make the goddamn playoffs. All right. It's just fucking annoys the shit out of me because I give it up to the Yankees forum like, like that, that, that's, that's the top team in baseball. It's not even close. 27 championships. Right. And he's going to fucking sit there and he's going to try and talk about Madison Square Garden. Like this is the crown jewel of the fucking NBA and completely disregard the Celtics and Lakers who combined have one 32 NBA championships Putts, the Lakers BBA championship that they count as an NBA championship for 33 and you're sitting on fucking too. All right. I gotta be honest as an outsider, when I think of Madison Square Garden, I think of Muhammad Ali, I think of led Zepplin Mark Messier. Yay.

Speaker 1:          00:54:29       Casually. I'll think of a Bernard king, Frank Sinatra, a Bruce Springsteen, a rolling stones. I think more music. I don't think sports because nothing really fucking memorable.

Speaker 1:          00:54:48       What has ever happened there? I don't understand what has happened at the Bruins. Went into the stands and somebody got beaten with a loafer. Mike Millbury, right. That's a rat them out. But I mean it's on video Mike, and we just don't understand. Like I, it just, I just tried to tell him, I'm like, dude, it's not louder. It's not louder. You think it was louder than when the Celtics finally one another fucking championship after their drought of like whatever, what it was 22 years. Do you really think it was louder than that? I was trying to explain to him. It just seems loud to you because you're a Knicks fan. You know? It's like that dude who was into the Asian women and he's gone out to do, they play off the lazy eye. You just see like Asian women, it's the same fucking thing. All right, so just in case there's some more verses out there. Okay. You have a nice little venue down there. It's, it was made during the cookie cutter time. Some of the worst fucking venues ever. The ceiling is ugly and a, there's an unbelievable, I've done this job before. I always talk about the, the breeze and Madison Square Garden is an unbelievable breeze up in the rafters because there's no championship banners to block the air conditioning.

Speaker 1:          00:56:00       So anyways, having said that, congratulations to the next, um, if the next ever went on a run and we're, uh, a championship team, even then, the best that they could hope to do is duplicate what, uh, the Bulls did with Jordan when, when they were the center of the basketball universe. But in my lifetime, they never have been. And I'm an old fuck

Speaker 4:          00:56:24       man. I've been around for a long time at this point. I'm halfway through this journey if I'm lucky. Hopefully only halfway through. Um, so there you go. I went out of my way to trash the fucking next, even though they just fucking one. Um,

Speaker 6:          00:56:40       okay.

Speaker 4:          00:56:40       I don't, and I don't even know shit about fucking a,

Speaker 4:          00:56:45       I don't know shit about basketball. Why don't I just shut the hell up? What am I up to here? 56 minutes.

Plus it all goes down the same pipes and this way you'll save a flush worth of water. It's like the hybrid of toilet time. Um, it doesn't go down the same pipe. It doesn't go down the same fucking jackass. It doesn't. The toilet goes down your fucking sewage line. All right. They don't all, they don't all flush together. Tell me they don't all flush together. Then where does that water go to then get treated and then I wash my hair with the shit. We all shit and pissed in a probably does this so many fucking people. Does it go down the same fucking line now? Now it would do you would the smell of shit would become and write up your shower drain? Maybe. Eventually it does. I don't think it does. I thought they kept those two separate. Wow. That's fucking disgusting. Can somebody please write me and clear that up? Um, anyways, frosting your own beer glasses at home. Underrated apps. A fuckin lutely. And by the way, you're required to do that. Okay. If, if you say, hey, you guys want to watch the game at my, you are required

Speaker 1:          00:59:22       to frost up some glasses.

Speaker 4:          00:59:25       Okay?

Speaker 1:          00:59:26       That's a, that's one of the unwritten rule. You know, there's unwritten rules. You don't show up a pitcher.

Speaker 4:          00:59:32       You know what I mean?

Speaker 1:          00:59:33       After the whistle blows, you don't shoot the puck at the goalie. Those fucking unwritten rules.

Speaker 6:          00:59:38       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:59:38       You know, the unwritten rule is that you have your buddies over to watch the game. He got a frost

Speaker 4:          00:59:42       glasses, you know, and then get mad at them when they pee all over the seat.

Speaker 1:          00:59:49       Overrated. A giant Oprah style mansions with 20 bedrooms and shit. I grew up pretty poor and it's some small houses. And I remember thinking as I was watching those screen movies, how that Shit could never happen to broke people. They had the rich kids in these giant ass houses, giant ours houses. This guy must be from Europe here. Um, and people getting murdered in some other room while the rest of the people were oblivious, which made me laugh as growing up. I could hear my mom in the kitchen walking around on the wooden floor. What while I was in the bedroom, literally on the opposite side of the house. No Way. Some Mass Douche is slaughtering someone d masking and then walking back into the lounge like, hey guys, what I miss? Uh, so sleek, tight there, Richie rich. That's fucking hilarious. But you know what's crazy about those houses is, you know when you have like 20 bedrooms, you don't think about it. But like those rooms are useless. 20 bedrooms. So you got to go out and buy 20 beds. What can you do on your bed? Sleep and fuck, right? Do you need to do then a bunch of other rooms other than that, how long does that take? For me, sleeping in fucking takes eight hours and seven minutes on a good day. Right? So other than that, it's just a useless room.

Speaker 6:          01:01:08       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:01:08       I, I you need whatever, three, four bedrooms. And then after that everybody can, you know, go sleep in the family room, go sleep in the movie room, go sleep in my study. You want to turn those rooms into something else? I've never understood. Uh,

Speaker 6:          01:01:23       yeah,

Speaker 1:          01:01:24       I don't know. You don't want to be, see, I, I, this is why I think those people live in those kinds of pieces. Some people just want a giant house, but there is got to be something really comforting

Speaker 4:          01:01:33       to live in. Like the Illuminati is like culdesac you know, like if I ever became like, just like some fucking billionaire, you know, which I really think is inevitable with the wild success of this podcast and all this advertising that pretty soon, you know, I will become a billionaire. Um, I go fuck yourself, whatever, whatever. I say, I invent the next fucking APP for the iPhone and I make a zillion dollars. So, you know, there's gotta be something comforting when the dollar is crashing. If you're in this giant gated fucking community with its own security. Ah, Shit. Even then, even then, any, you gotta think the Security Guy? I would make friends with the security people, like ridiculous friends. I would like if I had that kind of money, I would pay off the houses. Well then he wouldn't fucking show up to work. I'd have to do something where they were on my side. You know, I just make a plant dude, when it, when the shit goes down, you could bring you and your family and your pistol to my house. All right. I have fucking 10 years worth of beef in my fucking 4,000 square foot fucking refrigerator.

Speaker 6:          01:02:52       Okay.

Speaker 4:          01:02:53       Freezer, we can eat for 10 years. All and I have enough bullets for you to hold people off. Can you, can you do this? Are you willing to do this or that? That's how I would plan. I would have my own little mini militia. You know, I don't buddy my told me one time they were having, they had this fire in the Hollywood hills somewhere out here. Can somebody please find me footage of this because I refuse to believe that somebody had this level of wealth, but it sounded awesome. Where the big thing about if when you live in the hills out here, um, this is basically what happens all right? Every year for like a month straight if fucking it seems like it rains every day out here. And during that time all the hills turn all green and they're beautiful and they're lush and all that type of shit.

Speaker 4:          01:03:33       And then after that, occasionally it will fucking rain. So what happens is gradually the hills start to dry out and then towards the end of the year, the Santa Ana winds come in off of the desert. All right? And it's just flat. So they come in and like fucking sometimes upwards of a hundred miles an hour and it's like nature's hairdryer and it just dries out all of the hills and turns them this shitty. Jesus has common brown. And then eventually something happens, somebody throws a cigarette out the window. I don't know what I dunno. Fuck. A rattlesnake takes a shit and hits a piece of Flint. I don't know how these things work. I have a bad science background, whatever the fucking things catch on fire and all these rich motherfuckers that you're jealous of during those months, you're not jealous of when you watch their fucking houses burned down. So one time a buddy of mine was saying he was watching the news and somebody had so much fucking money. Daddy, the dude had his own fire department basically. And these guys were on top with these fucking fire retardant suits and these giant like, like cannons that were shooting foam all over the perimeter and all over the house. So his house didn't burn down and like the four houses around a burn to the ground and his house was fine just sitting in this giant mountain of fucking shaving cream and a,

Speaker 6:          01:04:54       yeah,

Speaker 4:          01:04:54       I just remember thinking that, that it, that is dead is the shit. Like if I was wealthy, that's what the fuck I would do. You know, I wouldn't help the less fortunate, I would make sure that I could protect all my shit. Wouldn't, you know, that was a nice little selfish moment. But I am, I'm selfish son of a bitch. That's the podcast for this week. Hey, would you guys like to see me do stand up? Well, why don't you go to [inaudible] dot com like I'm doing right now. You fucking bastard. Where the hell is it?
