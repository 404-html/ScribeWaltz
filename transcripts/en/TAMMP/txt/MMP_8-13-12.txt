Speaker 1:          00:00:01       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:00:02       Hey, what's going on? It's built burr and it's the Monday morning podcast from Monday, August 13th, 2012. How the hell are you? How's it going? August 13th. Can you believe it? Only three more weeks of this summer. Right? But thanks to global warming, you can still get a Tan right through the second week of October. You know, enjoy it. Folks. This is the golden age of global warming. You know, this is before polar bear swims up to your fucking apartment, you know?

Speaker 1:          00:00:37       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:00:37       All those fires in the middle of the country, who cares? Those are flyover states, right? That's just our food supply. Um, I've always thought it was funny the way people make fun of those states, you know, because they don't have what? A water slide and a giant fucking skyscraper. All of a sudden they don't count. Yeah. All they're doing is fucking, you know, providing nourishment for everyone in the state. I'm sorry, everyone in the nation, all they're doing is growing enough food to feed the world, but we don't. Right. And I think that's a good thing. I think a good thing that we don't feed the world.

Speaker 1:          00:01:19       Okay?

Speaker 2:          00:01:19       There's too many fucking people, and that's why the polar ice caps are melting. It has nothing to do with v eight engines. Okay? There's too many goddamn people. So when I'm going to do eventually in 25 years when I get famous enough is I'm going to put together my own collection of musicians and we're going to do, we aren't the world. All right?

Speaker 3:          00:01:47       Yeah,

Speaker 2:          00:01:49       we are the world. You're not a responsibility. I'm sorry you don't have an apple tree, so go fuck yourself. There's too many people taking shits every day and it's fucking up the world for me and you all right? We got more shit. That's how it worked out. All right. You get the idea. You know, I wonder who that would actually return that fucking phone call no fucking maniac from was in that movie heat. I bet he would. The guy was doing porns now. Oh God. I mean that guy. Just once, I want to have an orgasm like that and be fucking gone. Oh, Jesus. Like he was like, somebody kicked you in the nuts. Um, anyways, you wouldn't believe this right now. The way this is going in where I'm saying don't save the world. Okay, let them go. That's how I would run for office.

Speaker 2:          00:02:53       Excuse me. Um, non senator prayer. I was wondering what you thought about the problem in Croatia. Rwanda damned. Uh, yeah. I don't really know. I don't give a shit. I mean, I think it's terrible, but uh, you know, you know, the more people die, the more fresh air for us. That's how we look at it. You know, as long as it isn't anybody, uh, with, with our flag on their shoulder, I think that that would be okay. That's appalling. That's a realistic outlook lady. Okay. You want to be on the ship that's sailing towards surviving. I suggest you change your attitude. Next question. You over there with the striped tie? No. The other guy with the striped tie and the receding hair. Yes. Yo, I'm not answering that. Go Fuck Yourself. It's a figure of speech. Jesus Christ. Um, I actually have a giant announcement. Giant. A big for me. Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:03:54       Yeah,

Speaker 2:          00:03:54       I have a big announcement for me. All right. I'm pregnant. Um, I just found out and I'm really excited for myself. No, I, I um, I had been telling you guys that I recorded a standup special and the wonderful district of Columbia back in March and ever since then you guys have been asking me, hey pill, when is that special coming out? Well, on this week's podcast I will be announcing when my special comes out, but not right now for some stupid reason. I'm going to wait until the end. Just like one of those dumb shows on TV, you know, we're, all you need is one piece of fucking information. They just try to drag it out so they can get in eight minutes of advertising and so we can have a yacht right now. I'm fucking with you. I'm going to do it right out of the gate.

Speaker 2:          00:04:45       That's how I do it cause I'm not playing the gay man. Um, okay. My new special isn't titled You. People are all the same and it will premiere exclusively on Netflix. It's the only place you're going to be able to see it is Netflix. Why do you ask? Because I love those guys. They show my entire special, it's unedited itch. It captures the exact level of ignorance that I wanted to put out there. I love those guys. So it's going to be premiering exclusively on next flicks. Um, this Thursday, August 16th at 6:00 AM Pacific Time. So for all you grumpy people out there, that's 9:00 AM Pacific time. All right. It will be available to all Netflix members in the United States, Canada, Ireland and the United Kingdom. Well, isn't Ireland part of the UK?

Speaker 1:          00:05:46       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:05:46       Hey Nia, isn't Ireland part of the UK or at least Northern Ireland is right. I just lost everyone in fucking it didn't and he is making a face. We went over there, we learned this, we went on the double decker bus tour and they told us what the lady and the king owned right number that the United Kingdom, as far as my understanding is, is England, Wales, Scotland and a in Northern Ireland. I don't know. That's what it is. It's Northern Ireland. My apologies to everybody keeping it real and southern Ireland as opposed to all those sellouts in Northern Ireland who are just fine with that bigger douche telling you what to do. Is that what you're telling me? How many beer glasses am I going to get thrown at my fucking head? If I ever go back, if I go up to Belfast anyways, I'm just fucking with you guys over there. All right, hang on a second. What'd you say Eastern and, and I'm talking about the United States.

Speaker 3:          00:06:47       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:06:49       Oh 9:00 AM eastern. Oh, did I say for Pacific twice? I'm sorry. Well, either way. I was just talking about the United States with those times. You know, why? Cause we are the world. So I'm really excited that it's also going to be in Canada, Ireland and the UK. Um, because uh, I go to those places and when I go to those places, only three people show up. So, uh, maybe this will be able to, uh, as the dollar collapses, I'll be able to, uh, go to places where there's other currency and I'll get to start this journey all over again. Nia. Remember when you met me and I was still on a futon. That's actually true. It is true. Okay, so my new special you people are all the same. It's going to premier exclusively on Netflix this Thursday, August 16th, 6:00 AM Pacific, 9:00 AM eastern and a, what's the difference? What's the difference between here and uh, was it five hours to England? Uh, you guys figure it out, your fucking metric system.

Speaker 3:          00:07:52       You know,

Speaker 2:          00:07:54       what is somebody, somebody actually summed up soccer for me. Finally. How the hell did he describe it? Oh, was saying why Americans don't like soccer. This guy said to me, he goes, we already have this game over here. We call it hockey. You know, except it's way faster. This hitting you guys fighting. It's phenomenal. And it's funny that he said that because whenever I watch soccer, the, the, the stuff that appeals to me is that it is like hockey with the off sites and that type of shit. But I don't get it. Why the defenseman just gets to stop and then all of a sudden I'm off sites,

Speaker 3:          00:08:33       you know,

Speaker 2:          00:08:36       keep running. You do. You know what I'm trying to do? Like that's, that's your defense. You don't even have to knock me on my ass. She just stopped. It's just a terrible game. You know we have arms. People use them. What would you watch a sport if all you used was your arms and you didn't use legs and everyone was just standing there and maybe sitting on the ground or maybe just one of those craftmatic beds, like just throwing balls to one another. Oh my God. Did I just described murder ball? No, I didn't. They roll around in their chairs. All right. This is the money promoting podcast for August 13th I got one more day on my project here. I'm doing here, man. I, I let the cat out of the bag, Nia, and I told them that I was going to be a, I'm working on the pilot for the reboot of that kid shows zoom. Remember that show? Do you remember that show used to go.

Speaker 1:          00:09:34       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:09:35       Did you try that song again? Zoom. Muslims. Come on. Zoom, zoom, zoom, zoom. We're gonna Zuma. Zuma is Omasum. That's, that's what was the song in the 70s. Come on, give it a try. We're going to show you just why we're going to teach you to fly high. It was a drug reference. That whole thing was take drugs. Come on, give it a try. We're, can I show you just why? Why I don't want to do LSD. Come on. Give it a try.

Speaker 2:          00:10:06       I Dunno, but come on, we're going to show you why. Just take the shit. We're gonna teach you to fly high and everybody had the same stripe shirts on. We're doing a reboot of that without the drugs. Um, all right. So anyways, I'm staying here in the north end of Boston and I got to tell you something. The Italian nose, make the best fucking food out there. Bar none. Go fuck yourselves. I don't want to hear it. If you're into Thai food or you like Scottish fucking, uh, what a Scottish people eat Nini? What the fuck? What is it? Haggis yeah, what was it that's, that's like what? That's like Shetland sheepdog balls with the, some bangers in the mash there. Um, by the way, when I talk about, uh, Great Britain, I should state that like a Scotland is less than thrilled to be part of it. That was the vibe I got.

Speaker 1:          00:11:00       Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:11:01       When I was over there. This is really just my ignorant travel channel show this time, isn't it? Um, so anyways, we didn't stay in here in the north end and a, all that mainly doing is eating Italian food. I'm having a great time, but as of last night I was finally fucking sick of it when I had some Gnocchi, which is basically potatoes with wallpaper paste in a little bit of a, was it pesto that they put on there? You know, I ended up something fucking Irish, but um, I never used to come over to the north end. You leave in Nia. Okay, bye bye. It's like I said to that old lady in the wheelchair by, by, by, by um, what a sport. I actually woke her up and kicked her out of the hotel room so I could do this, you know. Hey, if you want to come back later, I have another microphone. If you want to do the final fucking 10 minutes, I know. Are Dying to know what's going on in your life.

Speaker 1:          00:11:56       Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:11:57       I thought you going to slam the door on me. That would have a great a nod to Jim Norton. Um, anyway, so we've been hanging out here. Uh, I got fucking octopus coming out my fucking e's.

Speaker 1:          00:12:10       Yeah,

Speaker 2:          00:12:11       no, I've eaten way too much Italian food. I'll even know why I love it. I'm done. Okay. I've had fucking total lady. I've had fettuccine Ed fucking Spaghetti weedy. I've had everything. I had a red [inaudible]. Um, that went right. Fucking threw me.

Speaker 1:          00:12:32       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:12:32       I wish it would be great if there was a website that had a picture of a bunch of people's different faces when they ate something that, that, that, that moment when they realize it's going right through them and they realize that they're in a public place, it's going to get ugly and they're doing the math on how far away the nearest private toilet that they know is versus how bad that feeling is in your gut. Uh, let's just say wrapped it up pretty damn quick with the person I was with. Um, anyways, and then he had some big festival down here, some sort of religious thing where they had a picture of him, they had like Mary and everyone was putting dollars on or I don't know what the hell that one is. I felt like I was in some sort of Scorsese movie. Um, and then they were playing this Frank Sinatra music, which is just a, it's just the best music ever.

Speaker 2:          00:13:28       It just makes you feel like you're a fucking millionaire. You know, they started playing this summer when, you know, the summer when it came blowing in from a cross does see. Right. And of course it sounded amazing and if for some stupid fucking reason they just write as I'm hearing the beginning of that song, you know, that fucking little keyboard starts playing and then the little fucking hits with the horns and you're already swaying as you're walking down the street and I'm walking towards it, right? Just mesmerized. And all of a sudden this fucking attitude voice starts singing with it. And I realized that doing Sinatra like Karaoke and it was some little girl going up there and she was so fucking flat and off I couldn't get. And I like, it was like frank singing like this summer when Kay blow it in and she's on top of that.

Speaker 1:          00:14:25       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:14:25       Worth their fucking eight year old high pitched voice. I can't even do it. My voice is shot. And I was like immediately turned in the other direction and I was trying to get out away from it. But the way the north end is set up with all the streets, diagonal and all the buildings close together, it was just echoing down all the streets and I couldn't fucking get away with it. So addie go up fucking causeway street.

Speaker 1:          00:14:49       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:14:50       Right. Press the that goes over the fucking Chiles town that you saw in the movie, the town. And I walked up two, uh, I walked up to the garden, Boston Garden and I looked at the Bobby or statue and uh, I got to admit from the side, it looks like Bobby your, but when you look at the face, it looks like that bit. I used to do where remember the old man face bit for my last special Dulia we'll do you, that's what it looked like. I don't know what it is about those fucking statues. They can get everything to look like the guy except for the face. You know the Magic Johnson Statute doesn't look like him. The Bobby, your statute doesn't look like him. The Michael Jordan statute. Just, it doesn't look like him. Even with the tongue sticking out. It's a, I don't know what it is. They, they can't make the face. They can't get the face. Right. Really bill is, is, is this, is this the level of fucking, you know, Shit that you think is interesting to us out. Go fuck yourselves. All right, let's do a little bit of a, let's get to a dilemma here.

Speaker 2:          00:15:54       Now, wait, wait. I got some other stuff to talk about first. Um,

Speaker 2:          00:15:59       before I forget the, I took her, we actually took a water taxi. Um, you know, I wanted to surprise Nia. We're going on the water taxi and women are so fucking intuitive. One of the hardest things to ever do is to surprise a woman. The second you start thinking, God, I hope she doesn't notice. I got, I hope she doesn't fucking ask me x, Y, and Z. It's like they sense it. They were like fucking dogs. They just pick it up and they'd be like, what's wrong with what's going on? Nothing. Why are you yelling at me? What's going on? Freaking. I was going to fucking surprise you. What? This fucking boat ride. Well, you don't have to. Yeah, they run real. Like I don't understand why every interrogator on the first 48 isn't a fucking woman. Their ability that, that's one of those things that nature gave him because nature new, right nature knew that fuck and Eddie nature. He knew that, um, that guys could just beat the shit out of women and there were no laws in place. You know, back in the day can just, whatever you want it to do. You know, if she gave you a rough time, you just balled up your big fucking caveman fist, Harry knuckles and all and you fucking cracked her right in the fucking nose

Speaker 2:          00:17:24       and it bled all over her woolly mammoth to piece that she was wearing. And that was the end of the discussion. So, you know, they had to adapt. So fucking mother nature gave him this fucking, I swear to God, I can't get away with shit. It isn't possible to surprise Nia. I just, it's, I can't fuck it. It, it drives me nuts.

Speaker 2:          00:17:51       I don't understand why there's not more women in, in the world series of poker. All right bill. We get it. They can pick up what you're doing. That's what I'm saying. So I was sitting there trying, I fucking finally just stopped and I said, will you stop fucking up the surprise. And then she just laughed. You know, probably cause it made her feel more secure. Right. Well good. That's good to know that I can tell when he's fucking acting weird. So if he ever did try to be deceitful, I would be able to pick up on it. You know what I mean? Fucking maniacs. So when he was, so I take her on this water taxi, right? I bring her over to sue one of these little fancy fucking food food stores where they, you know, they go walking in where they had the lady Gaga, where in the fuck in, uh, who's, who's another one of the horse that they all think is just amazing fashion sense.

Speaker 2:          00:18:39       Did you see the meat dress? Oh my God. Not the meat dressed. They obviously don't like that, but they'd like that fucking veil in the face. Shit, don't they? Don't they all, isn't it fair to just lump them all into one category and then just say something ignorant? I think it is. I think that's totally fair. So anyways, we're riding over on the water taxi and it's a fucking tremendous, you know, the guy drive and it's an ex fucking fishing boat captain. So He's loving life. You know, he's got this great job. He doesn't have any crew that he has to deal with. He doesn't have to go out of the harbor, you know, he just gets to cruise around on this little boat. So he's in a great mood. You know, he's making Nia laugh and he's breaking my balls way had taken her, I'll make sure he gets you something expensive, blah, blah, blah and all that shit. We having a great fucking time. So as we're going over there, right, all I'm doing is, uh, and by the way, if I ever had a boat, that's all it would do. I would just go around the harbor. There's no way I would ever go out to sea. I am unbelief. I'm terrified. Did you see that fucking video of that guy just sitting in the ocean and that hammerhead shark just circling around them? They, before they fished him out.

Speaker 2:          00:19:52       You know what I don't get, I don't get why I can't just be in the ocean treading water. Like why that just immediately make sharks go, oh, what the fuck is that? I'm not bleeding. I'm swimming just like a fish. Why are you so God damn fucking interested in me? Why are you fucking 20 miles away? Gone? Oh, I sense a pair of Alabaster fucking legs in the water. I think I'm gonna go over here and take a bite out of them, see how they taste, and then spin back around again. And if I liked the way taste, I'm going to come back and kill it. I just don't understand that. I could see if you were dead, you know? And then you know, they're like the garbage disposals of the ocean. They come by and they fucking eat you. But if I'm totally fine, what is their fucking problem? It's plenty of fish in the sea, right? Why you got to come at me? What am I doing? I'm treading water. I know I don't belong here. I, it's just, they're fucking annoying. Another thing and another thing, oh shit. I'm on a fucking Roman. A little fucking rant here. Um, which I'm not, by the way, I hate everything is defined as a fucking rant.

Speaker 1:          00:21:06       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:21:06       You know, he had, he, everything's a fucking rent. Everything's awkward or it's a fucking rant. It isn't a rant is to me is absolutely, you've completely lost your shit. You're screaming. There's fucking Goddamn foam at the corner of your mouth. That's a fucking rant.

Speaker 1:          00:21:26       Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:21:26       Going on some little clever little fucking 45 second run is not a rant. All right. Yo, dumb cunts on the Internet. Can we clear that up and can we also clear up that the comic does not heckle the crowd? I know I've brought this up, but it's becoming, people keep saying that I loved when you heckled the crowd. No, I'm on stage.

Speaker 1:          00:21:50       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:21:50       When you're giving the performance, you can't heckle the crowd.

Speaker 1:          00:21:53       Okay?

Speaker 2:          00:21:54       Heckled. A heckler is someone who disrupts a performance. If you're the guy on stage, am I disrupting the crowds performance? You're not given one. Sorry. Um, yeah. It's fucking shark week on the discovery channel and a, I don't know if anybody who works at Discovery Channel listens to this podcast. All right? But you guys are so fucking irresponsible over there. Okay? You do all this bullshit when you talk about sharks, about how fucking horribly they're misunderstood, you know?

Speaker 1:          00:22:29       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:22:30       And the beauty of, of the species and all this type of stuff. But you always sell it with that jaws vibe, you know what I mean? It's like, it's literally, it's like fish fucking racism.

Speaker 1:          00:22:43       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:22:44       Like the way that they show sharks on the discovery channel is the way they showed black people in the news when I was growing up, they did everything but play the jaws music, um, back in the day and this still doing it to sharks. All right? And I want to know where all the African Americans, when it comes to this shit, you know, why don't, why don't you have fucking reach out and have a little bit of fucking empathy? You can't see, you can't see the parallel, uh, the, the fucking cross pollinization whenever the fuck he call it. I don't what I'm saying. All I'm saying is I fucking hate the way they do that where they sit there and they, they, uh, they make it, they make the shark out to be like,

Speaker 1:          00:23:35       yeah,

Speaker 2:          00:23:35       it's beyond instinct what it's doing. Like it's sitting there rubbing its fins together, thinking about fucking sinners there stuff to do. Okay, it's hungry.

Speaker 1:          00:23:46       Just get something to eat. You're a dumb fuck. You're in the ocean, right?

Speaker 2:          00:23:53       I still don't get why. If I'm just fucking treading water, why do you have to come over and take a bite out of my leg? Leave me low. I fucking hate it. And I gotta tell you something. When I was, I was sitting there waiting for that water taxi, just looking into that fucking black water, you know, you can't see, you can't even see below the surface. I said to Nicole, you couldn't pay me $1 million to jump in that fucking water right now. Right there. And immediately jumped, jump right back out. I wouldn't do it. And she goes, you know, you're an asshole. She goes, I'm going to go to fucking jump in it just to show you how ridiculous should be. She goes, there's no shark in there. And I was like, you know what? Or maybe there is, did you see that fucking those people fishing off their back porch that caught that fish and all of a sudden a shark came out of nowhere. The F I, I just, I fucking hate the ocean. So anyways, so what, we're on this fucking boat and we're going by all these God damn ma, all these giant fucking yachts, like $50 million boats parked out in the harbor. And I just really realized like that whole, like the level of wealth that is out there,

Speaker 2:          00:25:05       a $50 million boat, a boat, a hobby, something you just got sitting in the fucking Harvard that maybe you're going to take out once or twice in a month was $50 million. Give me a fucking break.

Speaker 1:          00:25:20       I mean,

Speaker 2:          00:25:22       if I had, if I had a $50 million boat, there's no fucking way I wouldn't be selling drugs. I would just do it because it would be so God damn easy.

Speaker 2:          00:25:32       I would just get a brick of fucking cocaine and I would just fucking put it on my boat and I would just drive up the Goddamn coast and I drop it off to somebody. I get some money and then I would make a payment on the boat and now wait and I got to clean the money that Jesus say, I get caught. All right, strike that. I will be the guy driving. I wouldn't drive the boat because I'm afraid of the ocean. You know what? Fuck yachts. Okay, let's get a little fucking advertising here for the week. Um, what do we got here? Where is it?

Speaker 1:          00:28:22       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:28:23       Uh, this past week a, a one of my relatives passed away unfortunately, and um, he had to go to the funeral, but this person had it all worked out right down to their outro song and I underrated picking the music for your funeral. As Morbid as that is, you got to realize we're all going to go someday. And uh, this funeral was, was fucking awesome. It was, it was a celebration of a life and there was way more laughing than crying. And I think a lot of that had to do with the music. Fucking outro, music, wheeling out of the Church, uh, when the saints go marching in was this person's favorite song. And it was, it was, it was the shit. And I really got inspired. I was sitting there going, what the hell would I, what? What's, it seems like, you know, old people's like that their music is appropriate. It's such great music that it's appropriate for any situation. And I'm really trying to think like, of the music that I listened to,

Speaker 2:          00:29:30       you know, all that heavy metal and fuck and Zeppelin and ac DC. I mean, I can't have any ACDC plane as I'm wheeled out. Half of that's about the devil and going to hell. I don't to put that out there. You didn't have those three things from ghost come up or you remember that shit and drag me down. Um, but I, I'm telling you underrated. So I want to know from you guys. All right, when you kick the bucket, tell me about how you're going to do your funeral. How would you like it to be done?

Speaker 3:          00:30:01       And, uh,

Speaker 2:          00:30:04       yeah. Outro music and all that type of shit. What are you gonna do? Are you going to be going in the box? You're going to get cremated. This is fucked up, huh? You got to make these decisions and if you need to make a well, go to legal zoom.com Bam. There you go. In and out right there. All right. What else happened this week in the world of sports? Uh, Dwight Howard went to the Lakers and absolute shocker, absolute shocker that yet another guy who couldn't win a championship somewhere else is now going to go pile on with the Lakers. It's ridiculous. It's, they have literally become the New York Yankees of the NBA every fucking year they do this and I want Koby Bryant to start getting some shit for this. If you're going to give fucking Lebron James Shit for pilot, for leaving Cleveland and pile on piling on in Miami than God dammit. Coby has had people fucking coming to him for his entire Goddamn career 15 fucking years in a row and they got the nerve to sit there and compare this guy to Jordan. Look at the fucking teams. This guy he's been on and go back and look at those Chicago Bulls teams and I want to, I want you to start telling me Dennis Rodman is the only fucking

Speaker 2:          00:31:18       like free agent that I can really remember that they signed. All right, and he was, it was one fucking guy.

Speaker 2:          00:31:28       Coby gets two, three guys every year. Oh, it's ridiculous. It's absolutely ridiculous. I'm telling you as a crabby old man, these are not your father's championships. These are not championship teams. These, there's no difference between these championship teams and that rich kid whose first car is like a fucking Goddamn Maserati because his dad is rich. All right. You know, it's so fucked up about these teams and I include the 2008 Celtics in this. That was a, that was a bought and paid for championship. I know they put the work in. I know all of that, but it's not the fucking same. This is the funny thing about these pile on teams is I remember as a kid when you'd be out outside at recess and they'd say, we'd start picking teams. If they got too lopsided, kids would be, oh wait a minute, that's not fair. They would, people flip out and they'd break up the teams and you balance it out where I was from there, it was called mk teams.

Speaker 2:          00:32:27       I don't even know where that came from. The TCIS schmuck teams, these teams are smug, which meant it was bullshit. You had Shaq and Kobe and all these fucking guys are one team was going to be a goddamn bloodbath. All right. And even it's like second and third graders, we understood how fucking pointless it was to then go out and play the game. If you had all the most talented people on one fucking team, right? So we broke it up and we would, we would have it evened out and we'd have a great game during fucking recess. Now, if we can understand that, why can't full grown adults understand that in these leaks and professional leagues, why can't they understand that? All right? But if that's the way it is, I accept it. I accept these pile on championships, but I want them to be called that. All right. The same way they had the dead ball and then the live ball era, these fucking Laker championships, Celtics championships, Miami championships, these are not the same as the ones in the 80s, right through the fucking Chicago Bulls. I would even say the Spurs, you know the David Robinson, uh, Tim Duncan ones like, I don't want to hear it. Don't fucking be talking about don't bring up Larry and magic and all these other guys with the guys at today. It's different. Okay. Because

Speaker 2:          00:33:49       just imagine back in the day of bird magic just piled on and got on the same fucking team. Like why is that enjoyable? I gotta be honest with you. That first Dream Team, I didn't even watch it. I didn't want to watch fucking Larry Bird, magic Johnson, a key Malaysia one, Charles Barkley go play Rwanda. You know what I mean? What am I going to do next? What and then what? Watch me go play a game of wiffle ball with some fucking second graders. Like I don't understand what, where, what is the thrill in that? And if you're in one of those cities and you're getting all these guys and you fucking sites and you don't give a shit, um,

Speaker 2:          00:34:33       that's cause you don't understand. You don't eat, you don't even understand sports you and you're the same kind of person that I bet I bet cannot be swayed in an argument. Even if somebody makes a good fucking point. Cause all you want to do is be right. You just want to win like that. Fox News kind of, uh, like debating style where it's all good. If you agree with me and if you don't agree with me, I'm just going to yell at you and cut out your mic and that's going to be the fucking debate. Um, it sucks. Okay. So now I'm down to two sports, no football and hockey because you can't do that. And either one of those sports because they have a hard cap. I know people say in baseball they have a hard cap yet will they have a loophole that you can drive a $200 million team through call the luxury tax. You can just basically pay it off and you can go out and buy everybody on the fucking planet. So I dunno.

Speaker 1:          00:35:28       Yeah,

Speaker 2:          00:35:28       I dunno. I got to find some different sports to take place of, of Hoop and fucking baseball cause I'm done with both of those sports until they, they, they just fucking, you know, help. I don't know. It's just fucking stupid. You know what it is about those teams? Why I don't respect them? Because it takes more money than brains. Cells to put those fucking teams together. Back in the day you need a brain cells. You had to like break down. People get to see stuff before other people saw it. Now you just go, hey, we need a center. Who's the best guy available? What's he being offered? Offer him 10 million more. Next problem. I could fucking do that. Bite a bottomless pit of cash. That's fucking, it's depressing. It's depressing. So,

Speaker 1:          00:36:12       okay.

Speaker 2:          00:36:12       I Dunno, but I still don't think the Lakers have the coach.

Speaker 2:          00:36:16       I know God damn well. Colby Bryant doesn't fucking respect them. You know when you're doing great in the game and the coach goes to high five you and you completely ignore him. I would say that that's a complete lack of respect. What do you think? Am I crazy to think that? Am I crazy? Doo Doo Doo Doo Doo Doo Doo Doo Doo. All right, he voice everybody. Here we go is another way to start up.

You could basically with your cell phone get, you know, like three, four other phone numbers and it just will ring to your own damn phone. No one has to know what your real phone number is. It's a great way to be at work and actually have a private business going on so you can just, you know, rather than having to save up your trinkets that you cubicle job.

Speaker 1:          00:37:28       Okay,

Speaker 2:          00:37:28       you don't want to have to start from square one to start your new business.

Speaker 1:          00:38:21       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:38:21       Dot e voice.com/bill burr or go to the banner on my podcast page at [inaudible] dot com. Um, yeah, it's phenomenal.

It's phenomenal. He voice everybody. Go check it out. All right, back to the podcast. Um,

Speaker 1:          00:38:54       okay.

Speaker 2:          00:38:54       All right. What do we got here? Let's get it. Let's get on with dilemmas here. The lemme ish. Okay. Hey Bill, would you rather have as many gold medals as Michael Phelps or as many super bowl rings? Is Joe Montana? Uh, or do I get to be Joe Montana? Seeing that and that's that, that little odd dilemma. I don't know if I'm Joe Montana, if I'm going to have as many rings as Joe Montana, I want to be Joe Montana or Jerry Rice. I want to be somebody that they remember. I don't want to be the fucking left tackle, you know, per protecting the blindside or whatever the fuck's going on there. Right. I don't wanna be that guy. I want to be suddenly that somebody remembers Ronnie Lott or be Michael Phelps. MMM. That's a good one because you know what sucks about being Michael Phelps is like, he's kind of done at 24. You know, he's gonna come back at 28 and not quite be as fast. Those sports where you just finished at 24 like tennis. Um, I dunno Michael Phelps, but football's such a man's sport, but you can't walk when you're 40. Although I saw Joe Montana in a, in a, in a restaurant and you still look great.

Speaker 2:          00:40:12       Uh, fuck debt. I'd rather win super bowls. I'd rather win super bowls. There you go. All right, dear is billion. I am friends with a lot of people who have a lot of delusional hobbies throughout the last couple of years. I've had to attend their shitty band shows, the shows for this shitty bands to make that a little more clearer or go to their place. I've even been asked to donate money for the cost of making a CD and solicited to donate to a buddy short film so he can make it. Well, it sounds like you have a lot of motivated friends here. What do you [inaudible] are you the Heda? Maybe he's right. Let's, let's read the rest of this before I judge them. I repeat a short film. Well, I made a short film with the Teen Idols Sensation Joe to Rosa and Robert Kelly who's on a new fucking TV show called the Bronx crew or something like that on Fx. Like no joke. He's like the lead. Um, and a god Damn TV show Bob, Huh? Yeah. Great. It is to see that form. I've watched that man for 20 years on stand up. They would stand up doing plays and all that type of shit and he hung in there and he kept swinging and he put his fucking head down a bang. Look at that. It's fucking phenomenal. Anyways, all all of this wouldn't be so bad. Yeah. We made a short film of gotten to the Tribeca film festival. You know Joe to Rosa is now on his way to having a little burgeoning, like a directing career.

Speaker 2:          00:41:52       All right. Don't knock a short film, so are you have no idea where this could go. Anyways, he goes, all of this wouldn't be so bad if all of their stupid hobby hobbies didn't always end up costing me at least 40 bucks from donations to cover charges at the Gig they're playing, etc. The most recent one is a friend's Improv class showcase where I get to watch a bunch of amateurs put on a show with a two drink minimum and ticket costs. Exactly what I want to do with my free time. Now, my question is, can I just start a blanket policy of not going to any more of these and not donating without coming off like a complete Dick. I want to make the Improv show my last event. Then never support the hobbies of my untalented friends that constantly pissed my money away. To put it bluntly, my friends events aren't exactly the same as you going to support Dane Cook in the producers. He probably had the decency to comp your ticket.

Speaker 3:          00:42:54       Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:42:54       And any help is greatly appreciated. We'll do it. But you have to understand is that Dane didn't start off doing starring in the producers at the Hollywood bowl. We did open mikes and shitty restaurants and we had to learn how to do stand up. Look, if you're always having to go to these things, I understand that, but um,

Speaker 3:          00:43:16       you know,

Speaker 2:          00:43:18       you know something, I wouldn't want you to come to my show if I was starting out. You just seem really like annoyed by the whole thing. You're going to have a negative vibe and I just would feel like I would be on stage as I'm trying to learn how to do standup. And I would look out at you and you would have like your eyebrows up like, Gee, you know, like think he'd done yet. Rarely you thought that was funny. You know, you wouldn't even be smiling. You just be staring at me like, was that the last one? Can I go now? Can I leave? Um, so it sounds to me like you need a hobby. All right? You need more of a social life and a then you wouldn't have time to go to all your friends.

Speaker 3:          00:43:59       MMM.

Speaker 2:          00:44:00       I Dunno. Plays and all this. I find it weird that you don't do any of this shit.

Speaker 2:          00:44:06       You know that you have people making short films, you know, people in bands and you know, people in Improv classes. You kind of spanning the performance, uh, rainbow there yet. Do you perform? Do you want to perform? Why aren't you a performer? If you hang out with all these performers, I don't understand what's going on with you, sir. Did you go to some high school for the gifted and the time you realize that you weren't gifted, it was too late and you just stayed there. So now you're going to school with all these future Fiona apples and all that type of shit, and you're going to watch them play an acoustic set at the corner of some subway franchise and you've had it. I don't know what it is served, but you know what? Be Your own God. Damn man. Just say, listen, I don't fucking want to go to any a shit anymore.

Speaker 2:          00:44:54       All right? I don't have the money or the time. I would rather see the completed, call me when you make it and give me a free ticket. And then you can be the guy when they do the, uh, the early days, you'll be that guy. You know, you'll be one of those documentaries where nobody from the band. That's always like a major red flag when they're doing a documentary on a person, like an actor or a band or an athlete, and that person, the person, the subject isn't in the documentary and neither are any of the person's immediate friends. And then they always go to a guy like this guy, like, Yay, I used to fuck in a, he's to see him go on in front of fucking two people up, put the, you'll end up being that guy, you know. Well, this is the thing, surf. Any of those people make it, you better not be that Douche who said, I always believed in you because you don't believe in these people on any fucking level. So, uh, I would start, I would just fucking make sure you had other plants. That's the easiest way to, if you want to be nice and not hurt their feelings or you could just fucking come right out with it and just be like, listen, I've seen you improv before. Um, I'm going to wait six months in late. Maybe you'll get much better at it and it'll be entertaining for me. Okay,

Speaker 2:          00:46:17       I'm going to go to a bar and go hit on a girl. That's how I want to Improv because I don't know what I'm going to say either. Okay. I'll throw it a subject. Me fucking that girl over there. Go Fuck Yourself. I'm out about that. All right, next one bill. Should I have kids? How the fuck he supposed to know if you should have kids or not? Neither my wife nor I have strong feelings either way and we are getting to that age where it stops making sense. So we need to make a decision and live with it.

Speaker 2:          00:46:46       Um, yeah. If you're not feeling it, don't do it. This plenty of fucking kids is plenty kids to go out and adopt. You know? If you realize later that, oh, maybe I wanted a kid. Well what age? What am I kid Ben? If I had one, probably about eight. Yeah, let me get an eight year old. Let me get it out and let me get to eight year olds in a fucking seven and throwing the 11 here we go. Then you have a fucking big Brady bunch family. There's plenty of kids out there that need to be adopted and uh, there's too many fucking people on the planet and we're running out of natural resources. And, uh, my belief is that the population problem is going to be handled like a fucking term paper. You know, the same way we handled y two k at the last fucking second. And when you do shit at the last fucking second, it's going to be a rash fucking quick decisions, which means there's going to be some sort of final solution going on. I really believe that we are rapidly headed towards that. You know, if they don't,

Speaker 2:          00:47:52       I mean, we have 7 billion people on the planet and there's no politician going, hey,

Speaker 3:          00:47:57       you know,

Speaker 2:          00:48:00       why don't you just fucking not have kids for a minute? Or if you're not really feeling it or we'll give you some money not to have kids is fucking insane.

Speaker 3:          00:48:09       I Dunno.

Speaker 2:          00:48:11       We'll run it on a chicken and fucking soup. Uh, that didn't even make sense. Alright, cheating. Hey Bill.

Speaker 3:          00:48:18       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:48:19       Um, word on the street is, you're the male version of Oprah, so hear me out. You know what? That's actually insulting to Oprah. All right. Um, I've got this lady I'm fooling around with now and then she has a boyfriend but doesn't seem to mind hooking up with me when I asked her to. Yeah. That chick's of fucking nightmare, dude. I am. Before we even go [inaudible] you're not going to have a relationship with her.

Speaker 3:          00:48:46       Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:48:46       If she cheats on so much, she'll end up cheating on you and every time you fuck her or you're risking one of these times at boyfriend's going to find out and he might show up with a tire iron and a, you know, remodel your face. Anyways, when we met, she never wants to go further than second base saying that would be cheating. Um, last night I went to her house to pick her up for a party. Dude, there's not another woman out there that you could pick up for a party. What are you doing, dude? Do you want to be that guide? You want to be the guy who fucking plays with the tits is some fucking broad that has a boyfriend

Speaker 3:          00:49:23       come on.

Speaker 2:          00:49:25       Ah, there's nothing makes a guy weaker than a fucking easy pussy. Easy Pussy. His brought down more goddamn men, the layup piece of ass. Um, because we're lazy anyways, before we made it. And when I say we're lazy, I mean human beings in general. All right ladies, before you fucking pat yourself on the back and make your tits Schick. Um, uh, last night I went to her house to pick her up for a party. Uh, before we made it in the, in the car, I had her up against my car. We were making out like war. World War Two ended. I then suggested suggestively opened the door to the back seat, but instead of entering, she asked me if I loved her or if I just wanted sex. Yeah. Dude, this girl is crazy. I neither confirmed nor denied either of those questions. Yeah, that's stupid. That's a great lie. That's great. All right. This is just straight across the, this is a linear story begins with deceit, goes into the seat and it's going to end with it. Um, I just went back to kissing her.

Speaker 1:          00:50:36       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:50:36       After she got drunk at the party. Oh Jesus. That and you're sitting there like a fucking wolf waiting for it to get hammered. Uh, we talked again and she said she was willing to dump her boyfriend and have sex with me if I just told her that I love her and want to be with her.

Speaker 1:          00:50:57       Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:50:57       I actually don't, but I really want to bang this chick. I was thinking about just saying I love her and then dumping her after we banked. But I guess that would be kind of a dick move. Yeah, it would be, but I got it. We got it. Everybody's got to take responsibility for their actions. This fucking woman is setting herself up for this shit. My Morris comp, my moral compass has no needle needle bill. Help me out. Greetings from Belgium.

Speaker 1:          00:51:24       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:51:24       Uh, I hope you were able to read that fluently as you always still look at this guy fucking sarcastic in a second language. Um, yeah. Listen, uh, you know, do you really want to be this guy that's, if you believe in Karma, that's a really bad thing to do. All right. You're being lazy. Okay? This girl's obviously damaged. There's something wrong with her. And um, if you do what you're thinking of doing, just so you can bang her, you're really going to devastate her. And Is it worth devastating? Another human being just to get just the f two FEC it Banger is one for you. This is classic. All right? This is not my advice. This is standard advice, okay? Here's the deal. Why don't you rub one out to her and afterwards immediately think, do I really think about what you're doing and the way you're going to be getting this girl and ask yourself if you really want to do it all right,

Speaker 1:          00:52:28       okay.

Speaker 2:          00:52:29       And then act accordingly. And if you still want to do it, um, please don't ever get a job in a corporation

Speaker 2:          00:52:36       because you will move up that ladder in 20 seconds. Oh my God, he's a sociopath. He has no feelings. He doesn't care about people. Let's give them a corner office. MMM, okay. X Porn Star or something. X Porn is all it says. Dear Bill, I'm a 22 year old lady seeking some valuable male insight and perspective. I've been dating my boyfriend for over a year now and everything's been incredible. Well, congratulations. I have no feeling that this is going to go in a different direction. Anyways, we felt like soulmates and didn't like to be a part. However, all of a sudden it became very distant towards me. I tried to ignore it, justifying it with some personal issue he was dealing with. Little did I know. Those personal issues also involved me and his ex, o g. G feeling a horribly familiar sense, feeling a horribly familiar sense. Infidelity, Deja Vu. I think you skipped a word in there. I did something awful I could kick myself in the face for, I looked through his laptop. I know it's a really disbelief despicably Dick thing to do, but I needed some strand of truth. Even if it would break my heart. I got to tell you something.

Speaker 2:          00:53:57       If he was being a good guy and you did that, you know, that's a piece of shit thing to do

Speaker 2:          00:54:05       and the fact that he was giving you the, I'm cheating on you vibe and you still felt like a piece of shit by going through his emails. The, you're a good person, you're being too hard on yourself. Um, what he's supposed to be, you know that person, a good fellows whose content to be a jerk. What am I supposed to say that my boyfriend cheats on me. See, I switched it up for you. Anyways, I read an email he wrote to his ex girlfriend expressing his lament about being with the wrong person. Well, there you go. It's over game set and match. It went up and went on about how amazing she was and how any other girl me would only ever be second best. This prompted me to look through his photos and I found some recently opened but only nude pictures of her.

Speaker 2:          00:54:53       This hit me really hard because unlike regular porn, nude pictures of xs holds something sentimental value I don't appreciate or think it's appropriate. Well that's about as lightly as you can put it. Um, yeah, you should definitely not appreciate that he actually knows that woman and banged her. Uh, putting myself in this conundrum. I couldn't bring this sensitive topic up without admitting I invaded his private invading his privacy. Although my hunch was right. I know I was wrong and looking through his personal shit, but is it wrong of him to still masturbate to naked pictures of his ex? Even after he reassured me he had deleted them? How would I go about talking to him about this? Or is this situation better left? Undiscussed now that we are on better or closer terms, I appreciate any piece of advice or opinion greatly. So, uh, go fuck yourself. Question Mark. Uh, I, you know, I wa I can't even fucking answer this. What he gave you the vibe. Like he was fucking around on you and he is, he is fucking around on you. And that whole thing about that. Your, your, your second best. Go Fuck Yourself. Fucked that. Break up with the guy. All right. You know, what's your biggest problem is, sweetheart, is you are a sweetheart. And this guy is at the very least a confused,

Speaker 2:          00:56:32       uh, fight. He's a fucking dirt bag. He's not being honest with you, okay? Now, this is the thing about if you're a sweetheart and life, male or female, uh, pieces of Shit gravitate towards you. They need a sweetheart in their life to put up with their piece of shit behavior. So what you have to learn to do that. If you are a sweetheart via big hearted person, you have to be guarded, all right? And you have to make somebody's earned the fact that you're a sweetheart, you just don't give it away.

Speaker 1:          00:57:06       Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:57:07       All right? Cause when you just given it away and you fucking Nice Day, how are you? I just met you. Will you help me move? Okay? That's a nice, you gonna get, you're gonna get taken advantage of. So this guy has taken advantage of you. Fuck this guy. Break up with them, okay?

Speaker 1:          00:57:22       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:57:22       If he wasn't such a fucking shifty piece of shit, you wouldn't have to done that piece of shit. Then he basically gave you grounds for a warrant to go search through his shit. All right. And you were right. Okay. Although you didn't get a warrant, you kind of did it like the rogue cop who now is the throw his badge on the desk yet still go out and solve the fucking crime, like all those 80 cop buddy movies. But you are right. You deserve better. Fuck this guy. All right.

Speaker 1:          00:57:49       Yeah,

Speaker 2:          00:57:49       you should break up with them even though it's going to hurt. Um, all right. So you know what? I think that that's going to be the podcast for this week. A little under an hour. I know that's shorter than what you're used to, but, um, I gotta I gotta upload this and sent it to my guy to give to you guys that you're now listening to.
