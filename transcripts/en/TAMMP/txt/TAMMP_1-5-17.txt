Speaker 1:          00:00:01       Hey, what's going on? Hey. Oh, what's going on? It's, it's bill berm then this is the Thursday afternoon. Just before Friday. Monday morning podcast.

Speaker 2:          00:00:16       Ah,

Speaker 1:          00:00:18       just checking in on you. Just check all I'm eating my balls do to, to, to, to do on a damn stage Bob. Oh, freckles is paying the fucking price. He's paying the price. Every comedian that has a special coming up, you know, in the next couple of weeks, whenever the fuck they're putting it out. I believe the rumor I heard a rumor. Bananarama oh yeah. When are they going to get back together? Huh? Fuck. Every year that goes by, everybody was talking about when's guns and roses going to get back together. When's axl and slash going to, but what about Banana Rama?

Speaker 2:          00:00:59       Okay,

Speaker 1:          00:01:00       I hear a room and they were getting back together for a summer. Fucking tall. Um, I'm paying the price. Every God damn. Oh look, a job are paid. Uh, who have a special coming out is that you just go on stage and you have, you know, you got nothing. You got one little fucking, you got one little pea shooter and then you've got a slingshot and a fucking whatever, two months earlier you had a Howard sir, have a fucking act and it's the weirdest fucking thing. Just imagine if a whatever, if you're an athlete or something like every couple of years he had to relearn that, all the mechanics, but you just couldn't hit the jump shot anymore. He had to fucking, ah, that that shot was in my repertoire. Now I've got to relearn how to fucking do this in a sense, but in a different way. I've got to do it and then I got to shoot it with my left hand now because they already saw me do it with my right hand.

Speaker 1:          00:01:50       And then the more you fucking do it, the more hours you put out. Right. Then you go, when I got to bounce it off my fucking head, cause you know you can't keep doing the same shit or everybody's there more or they say, dude, that reminds me of this day, your day. Oh no other guy with this person. Right. You just got to fucking deal with that. So last night, you know, and of course they have to go on after Ian Edwards, I a n Edwards who's won like lack guy. All he has is a level fucking material just up. They're murdering. And uh, I went up there with my look book, but the total basic fucking horse shit, I was in a really fucking dark place. It's funny to be in a dark place and then like, you know, mentally just like, uh, and then to be talking about the shit that I was talking about and um,

Speaker 2:          00:02:40       yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:02:41       I dunno, but I, I got to plow through this shit as far as like, uh, I got to get past my anger and I'm telling you this fucking exercise that I did that I'm really starting to think my shoulders. How fuck do you put your shoulders up? Remember that bit I used to do, I think I was stuck in a defensive posture, like shell shocked, you know what I mean? There's only so many times you can get slapped in the back of the head by bigger kids before your shoulders are just naturally up. Like you're already beginning to block whatever's coming at you fucking head. And I think I was kind of stuck in that and um, you know, I was talking to some people about that and it was like, well, you know, there's physical ailments and then there's the emotional fucking trauma of what's going on with your life.

Speaker 1:          00:03:22       And there's certain people that think they're related. I don't know if you guys are into that Hippie, but you look up to stuff, you know, this is like one of these things when you go to look this up, you completely leave the medical profession in the United States of America. Like you start like the doctors slowly start wearing less and less shoes as you start to go further east with your, your, you're looking for medical solutions. You know, if you're looking for a medical solution in the United States of, of the Americas, it's going to be a guy in wingtip shoes with fucking dark socks, you know, fully clothed being like, okay, yeah, you got a, your rotator cuff is taped up though. We need to go in and operate and take the Metal Carlo, all the fucking MCL and all, they're going to give you this straight fucking how the body works.

Speaker 1:          00:04:13       We've done an MRI. This is what the fuck is going on with your body. But then as you start to go, you know, you start to step away from that shit that the pharmaceutical companies and all that, not saying it's all bad, not saying it's all Ben was the last time we had a plague. You know, for as much as the pharmaceutical companies allegedly allegedly created a heroin epidemic in this country by handing out opiates like Flintstone vitamins to fucking adults. Uh, you know, there's also, you know, because nobody's walking around with scurvy, so that's something, right? I guess no one really walked around with scurvy bill. He had to be on a fucking boat, lost at sea, you know, with no wind in your sails and iron maiden singing right the car.

Speaker 1:          00:04:55       Um, so, uh, yeah, but the further you go down that rabbit hole, like, uh, the, the fucking, the longer the hair gets, then there's like, you know, more loose fitting clothes, then it becomes sandals. And then just sort of the more, you know me and even then we should, I can, I can like this and then I get all fucking uncomfortable. Um, I'll look up some stuff. Let me hit pause her and I'm going to look up some shit about like the memories. Let me, let me see what this fucking doctor looks like. Our of perfect, perfect fucking perfect. So I looked up memories held in, in the meeting that came up was in body. So of course Wikipedia has something that's just going to be like, you know, the old right there, Fred. So the first thing I scrolled down too, that was not Wikipedia was tiny Buddha.

Speaker 1:          00:05:41       All right. And I swear to God, it says how to release the painful memories and emotions stored in your body, uh, by Jennifer Sterling. Of course, now they're going to let a woman do something, right. They're not going to let her in the wing tip world. So the picture you see is some Antonio Banderas looking guy with the, uh, I call it the gay cut tee shirt. You know, you know the, you know the v Neck t shirt that the fucking gay guys were, cause they're all fucking in crazy shape. You know what I mean? It's not the dad bod cut. It's the gay male fucking cut where they have chess cleavage because they have 0% body fat. So the guys dressed white on white with the gay cut t and yoga pants, no fucking shoes. And he's on the beach, not a half. He looks like fucking a good look. And Tom Hanks in castaway, if he didn't give a fuck that he was cast away, cast away. Yeah. And he didn't need to talk to a soccer ball because he was so fucking centered and he breathed his way through. How the fuck did he become a castaway? I can't even remember.

Speaker 2:          00:06:46       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:06:47       It must've been his ship sank, right? What was he flying with? Amelia Earhart. I Dunno. Was it one of those Tarantino movies where he kind of fucks with history? All right. The cure for pain is in the pain, says somebody named Rumi and then it says, free download, Buddha desktop wallpaper. That kind of kills it. You know when you have a good Jesus or Buddha or Mohammed like wallpaper, you know what I mean? Kind of cheeses it up a little bit. Then you think, okay, it's all right. Let me read it. My Best Yoga voice, your body keeps a physical memory of all your experiences. You have lots of memory stored in your brain that you can recount at any given moment, even called names. Faces. Yeah, get out of my fucking brain works what you're fucking sandwich smelled like, but over time these memories fade or change as time passes as and we mature.

Speaker 1:          00:07:36       However, even when the memory begins to fade from your rang, get to the fucking point. It lives in your body, in the form of a physical sensation and behavior patterns. The body doesn't forget now, Jesus, what's your body from Hell's kitchen? And I was for fucking 20 years ago. You fucking piece of shit. Your brains all forgiving like, hey man, like you know, not going to lie. I didn't enjoy it when it happened, but you know, God, I mean just the sunny day, just go out and enjoy it. All right. The events of our lives leave physical imprints in our bodies, especially when we experience trauma care. I okay. Stress and all this shit that caused the body to fight, flee, or freeze in order to cope. This is what I'm saying. I think I was all fucking, I was in a a, you know, after you take a couple of fucking right left to their head, you just Kinda, you just walk around. I just thought I, you know, I have like fucking 40 years ago, whatever the fuck I was in high school 40 years ago was I 18 now. That was 30 years ago. 30 years ago. It was fuck at 18. Yeah, I'm a, you knew that phone was gonna ring. Who is this? Who the hell is this? I should have put it on pause. Who is this?

Speaker 2:          00:09:00       Hello? Hello.

Speaker 1:          00:09:06       Yeah, for Fuck Sake. Can you believe someone would pocket down me during my podcast? You know what's funny is I don't even know who the fuck that was. I have no idea who the fuck that was. They have no idea who the fuck I am. I, that's what's always fascinated me about when you just fucking, you just dial a wrong number. I've said this before, right? You dial a number and somebody says hello and you're like, yeah. Hey, is a is is, is frank there? And they're like, whoa. And you're like, and they're like, oh, I'm sorry.

Speaker 1:          00:09:40       They're like, I'm sorry you have the wrong number. Now I get wrong numbers. Everybody gets wrong numbers. Here's my question to you. Do you think you've ever accidentally called somebody famous? You know what I mean? Like you just fucking, uh, I dunno. You just dial the wrong number and like, Bill Clinton picked up or fuck it Obama. Oh, throw a Republican in there. George Bush. Hey, she's Daddy, right? He fucking picks up and you and he has to go through the same shit is you like is frank there? And he said, [inaudible] know frank e F, g, H. I love them. Then they'd read the fucking number. T like, you don't know what your number is. It says plop. No it isn't. That's why there's no frank here. Anyways, let me continue one. All right, well fuck all this shit. How do I get it out of me? Because my body, it never forgets. It's like fucking Niamh. Listen, if you punch me in the fucking head, seventh grade,

Speaker 1:          00:10:46       um, wait a minute. I love that they finally give Jamie Foxx the fucking Liam Neeson Merle. He has a movie coming out where it's one of those movies like, you fuck with my family. I'm gonna fucking kill you. It's about time. You know, they ran out a young white guys to give that to and then they just kept going over and like, Liam Neeson me, let me know that guys. Like, what is it? Like 83, then he play like fucking Obi wan Kenobi or some shit. Um, all right. The first tool to put your emotional toolkit, the first tool to put in your emotional toolkit, and this is why, this is why I've never been able to get through this shit because

Speaker 1:          00:11:26       I was getting no, because I'm fucked up. But when I start to go down this road of doctors who don't wear shoes like it said, okay, the pictures that they have, okay? It says how to set New Year's goals you'll actually enjoy pursuing and it's a stick figure sitting on a rainbow staring up at the sun with a big goofy smile on its face. And uh, I don't know about you guys, but where I came from, that sort of happiness was not allowed. You basically were not allowed to be happy and it was shamed. Fuck off. Oh No, wait, why am I letting that react? I, why am I reacting to that? I have the power. I could, you know it's funny, right before I started this I was thinking I should go into the settings and I should just turn it off and I didn't. So I created this situation. Not a dead Steve Jobs. Huh? I guess I could get upset with Steve Jobs with how fucking many times that thing rings before it goes to voicemail. But then I imagined that I could actually go into settings and I could determine that. I just don't have the patients. All right. The first tool. Okay guys, your first tool to put in your emotional toolkit.

Speaker 1:          00:12:47       This is the type of class I would go to with Nia and she would just feel me either starting to get mad or just laughing at the thing as she being the fucking angel that she is. An open fucking channel would be like, okay, get, what is the first emotional tool? It's cause she's a woman. She gets to fucking do that. Being like, oh my God, let's get some smores. They get to be like that. We're not, you know,

Speaker 1:          00:13:12       you don't have a fucking bottle opener. You've gotta use your teeth, you know, and said stupid Guy Shit. And then if you don't know how to fucking do that thing where you bring your beer up to the counter and fucking slam it down, you know you're somehow less of a man. Um, I like how I'm putting all of my issues onto you guys. All right, let's say we go, okay. The first tool to put into your emotional toolbox nonjudgment ah, fuck. I mean, there goes my standup career. I mean, my entire fucking life is judging people. All right? When you feel emotionally triggered and tempted to turn to food or other addictive behaviors for comfort, I'm not f well, I'm, maybe I am a drunk. Try not to judge the reaction. Our bodies are programmed to seek pleasure, not discomfort. So it's natural to try and find something to soothe the pain and make yourself feel better. The need to suture yourself with food. I'm not a fat fuck or other means. Doesn't make you a bad person. It makes you human. Oh God, this is so gross. The second tool permission, the third tool release. I can't even read this. The fourth tool. Forgiveness. Finally time.

Speaker 1:          00:14:22       Oh my God, I'm going to the wrong website. Jennifer sterling is an emotional eating coach.

Speaker 1:          00:14:29       Well, what the fuck is this? Have met the wrong website. She helps women to stop eating their feelings and released the physical and mental emotional weight that keeps them from feeling the absolute best. Download the cravings decoder guide and uncovering the hidden hidden emotional meeting behind your food cravings. I don't know. I don't want to be a fucking negative person, but doesn't that sound a fucker generic? I was craving a peanut butter and jelly sandwich. Okay. What that means is this. All right, where do you store your emotions? Where do you store your emotions? So right now, this person has a phd. So imagine there they're going to be wearing more clothes. They don't even have a picture,

Speaker 3:          00:15:08       okay?

Speaker 1:          00:15:09       It may surprise you then. Motions are not the sole product of your brain, but our [inaudible] might be surprised you. This isn't gonna say the same shit as the last website and these emotions can be triggered through your body work, meditation, breathing, blah, blah, blah, blah. Use one half. All right. You know, evidently I'm never going to get cured cause I, I can't get through this shit. Well certainly not while doing a fucking podcast. You Moron. Why did you just call yourself a more on there? Is that, is that really what you thought or is that what people told you when you were younger? That's the type of shit where you just want to grab the person by their ankles and drag them out of their chair and they just walk out of the room. You know me from that session, uh, Jesus Christ, I'm up against it, dude.

Speaker 1:          00:15:54       This is what it's like to become a parent. You just suddenly become hyper aware of how unqualified you are and what a fucking moron. You weren't like someone's gonna be looking at me like I have questions. Hey, I'm like, we talked to my kid like, Hey, join the club. You think any of this shit makes sense to me? At least you're a kid. And you can have the comfort of, of, of, it's okay that you don't know shit. Where do you get to be my age? And you don't have an excuse, you know? And there's that fucking, uh, uh, whatever the fuck isn't the Micheal Ray Richardson, Tyson, Sicily to whatever the fucking name is. Quiet Leaf Tyson. I forget what his name is. You get like fucking the, the, the, the guy who looks like the, the cop on the black cop on Barney Miller, who fucking knows about black holes in the universe and is a fine wine connoisseur.

Speaker 3:          00:16:37       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:16:40       You know, that's the kind of person you need is a debt. That guy, that guy's got fucking answers. You know, I was reading a thing on him. I'm fine. I got it. I can never remember this guy's fucking name. Last name is Tyson de Grasse Tyson. Tyson scientist. Tyson sites. We'll go with that. Mike Tyson's foot worth Neil degrasse Tyson. This is why he's the shit, because that only is the unbelievably intelligent and he knows that we came from trees or some shit, whatever the fuck he was saying. You know, thank God. I don't do heavy drugs. When I watched that guy show, alright, he also was talking about how he's into wine and he was talking about how when you, you had whatever, you finish a bottle of wine, you fill it up with water or you go to, you know, and you're pouring it out. It does that Glub Glub glub thing. He was just going, what'd you do is you just turn the bottle as you turn the bottle, it causes a swirling effect. And uh, uh, basically because it's swirling down, then there's that hole in the middle, lets the air go in. So as, as the, uh, liquids coming out in the air can freely flow in

Speaker 1:          00:17:43       to take up the space that the liquid once had. And it just flows right out. Plus it looks, it looks fucking cool as you do it. So the next time you pour a big fucking glass of wine for some real housewife, you know, gets, you can't wait to hold her botox face in your hands. You know, you don't want to fuck it up by Glub glub glub in it into a giant glass because it might go all over a fucking dress that she's going to wear once, you know, they look, you know, that's what I get out of Neil degrasse Tyson. I watch that show and I'm like, God damn it. You know, as much as this guy just told me where we came from in the universe millions of years ago or whatever, thousands, I don't know. You're going to go back to Jesus. That was only what, a couple thousand years ago.

Speaker 1:          00:18:24       Um, as much as he's teaching me about that, he's also on the side showing me how to bang a real housewife. Um, anyways, so I've continued to uh, get rid of shit and I'm, I'm still in my office. That's how much shit I had had two closets and everything in my room and I've fucking, I've gotten rid of everything and I might even do another pass cause I have to tell you, I fucking walk in there now and I'm relaxed. I had no idea that when you walk in and there's a ton of shit, uh, the level of stress that was bringing me up, fucking relaxed. And like there's my drum kit, there's my guitar, there's where I keep my pens, you know, get it out of here and anything that's coming in the house, get it the fuck out it. So then yesterday, of course, you know, you know, women are, you know, you know, you know, they are, I mean, if, if, if they're not fucking, you know, watching a real housewife show, if they're not eating something there, they're on Amazon buying something.

Speaker 1:          00:19:26       They just, they, they, they, they fucking consume shit. So, um, you know, it's spend the holidays. So we've had a bunch of boxes, people sending US stuff, we're sending them shit and it by my front door, every day there's these fucking boxes. Okay. So what I always do is I take our fucking address. Often I put it through the paper, right? Then I cut the boxes up and then I take them over this fucking place that, uh, you know, one of those mailboxes separate places, you know. And I say, Hey, go is some free fucking boxes. They take it now. I don't know if they throw it out like goodwill, but I feel like I made the fucking effort, you know, but I can't fucking keep the God damn door clean and I cut up like fucking 20 these God damn boxes, you know? Did you went to, you have a fucking baby. Everybody sends your shit. Everybody's sending your shared socks, shoes, swings, follow this shit. And it's just like, you know, I just love the amount of socks that they send you. It's like, it's not gonna be able to walk for like the first fucking, I dunno, six months. What does it need socks for?

Speaker 1:          00:20:28       We didn't get me a hang glider. I mean just that doesn't even make any fucking sense. I know you get the baby's got to keep its feet war, but does it have to have one pair of socks for every fucking day, but six month life, you know, and then what? You got all these little socks, it's going to grow out of him and like fucking Ted's out used to see what level of a con would you have to be to look at the cutest thing ever. A little baby socks and, and it still makes you upset. See what I'm saying? Oh, tell your freckles needs some help here. Um, all right, let's get to some of the, uh, let's get to some of the announcements. Oh, by the way, everybody, I keep forgetting to promote this, uh, the Patrice O'neil comedy benefit, the fifth annual, well, uh, Patrice O'Neal comedy benefit.

Speaker 1:          00:21:15       I still have a nice photo on the wall. Somebody did his great painting of him, the perfect size and all that that I will never get rid of. Now having said that, I don't need any more. Um, all right. Patrice O'Neal comedy benefit. This is the fifth annual one at the New York City Center. All right, we're going to post the link and all of that. There's a, it's a 2000 seater. We got a couple of hundred seats left. Yeah. And um, it's a great way to start your year. And, um, it's one of my favorite shows of the year. Um, just get to see all of the, uh, just all my friends and now it's becoming like newer guys that were influenced by Patrice and they come and they talk about, you know, the amazing comic that he was. And, uh, I got to tell you that will never not be in the back of my head cause I love the guy to death.

Speaker 1:          00:22:03       But it's also like whenever someone will come up to me and, and give me a high compliment, you know, as far as where I am in the comedy world right now is a standup comedian. I always think that's, cause Patrice isn't here right now and Mitch Hedberg and Geraldo and all these other monsters that we lost. So, uh, this is an incredible benefit. And it, uh, you know, through the money that we've raised, his mother's been able to get a condominium and she's living great. She doesn't have to worry about anything, you know, you know, the only thing, you know, and that's am I really a belief of mine that when somebody passes and their family members are, you know, the only thing they should have to deal with is the grief of it, which unfortunately you never totally get passed, but they shouldn't also have to deal with all this other stuff, which is why we continue to do the benefit.

Speaker 1:          00:22:53       Because I always hated when I was coming up, when there was an unexpected death and the person had a family and all of that type of shit. You know, it's like you do one benefit and it's like, okay, here's your bag, a loop, you know, trying to make this last for the next 20, 30, 40, 50 fucking years. Um, I dunno. So that's why we continue to do it. Plus it keeps the, the memory of him alive and all of his comedy out there. Uh, that is the hope. Anyways. Okay.

Um, all right, so is that the podcast? That is the podcast. Um, now when I get off the podcast, I'm going to go look at these barefoot doctors. You know, I can't fucking believe they, you know, the misrepresentative, that fucking site, you know, they have some guys sitting there, right with the gay cut tee shirt. And I'm sitting there thinking like, all right is going to be for angry Fuckos like me. And it's for a bunch of women who, uh, every time, uh, their boyfriend says, hey, you know, I don't feel like getting a, going to see that movie tonight. I'd rather stay in. And they go, oh they go when they eat a fucking death by chocolate fucking thing.

Speaker 1:          00:32:55       I Dunno. I don't even want to complain about anymore. I really don't. I'm just freaking out cause I got a kid coming. I would just like the kid to show up already so I can get on with that part of my life. I suppose this is what, this is literally what it's like. Sometimes this reminds me obviously too much emotionally heightened state than this, but I always remember when I would be standing the side of the stage and it was just a fucking brutal crowd and I knew that they were going to scream and yell the entire fucking show and it was just going to be 45 minutes of pure fucking hell. I always remembered just the worst part was not going out there. It was waiting the second I got out there, I didn't give a shit because it's just like every second I'm out here is one less is I am a second closer to this fucking being over.

Speaker 1:          00:33:47       It's like doing cardio, getting on the fucking thing and doing it is not a fucking problem. It's, it's the stretching beforehand, you know, putting on the workout clothes, dragging your ass over to the machine. The second you get on the thing, I'm in literally 30 seconds into it. You listen to your tones, you having a good fucking time. Everything is fucking great. It's, it's the getting, it's the getting there, at least for me. And you know what? I think that that's something that we can all relate to, is it, I don't fucking know. Anyways, uh, I started to watch the Celtics last night against Utah. Uh, I got to watch that one cause I think the Bruins a plan today and uh, I'm trying to do this. I'm going to watch every Bruins and every Celtic game that I possibly can.

Speaker 1:          00:34:33       It's fun. I got to tell you something I never realized because I haven't watched it so long. When you watch NBA hoop, it's so easy to start to get to know your team because they got a starting five. You know what I mean? Patriot's, you got 11 guys on offense. 11 guys on defense. Basketball has five five starters. Their play, they start both ways. Offensive Defense, run down the fucking court. Now you're on defense, you know, I guess the Bruins just to have a starting line and then they're starting to defensemen. That's five. And then they got a goalie. But thing about what, how many, you know, I don't know how many fucking players are on a hockey team. How fucked up is that? All these years of watch and I don't feel like football is like 41 42 people you know of which if you know like 10 of them, you kind of know your fucking team.

Speaker 1:          00:35:18       What do you guys think? I'm going to say there's like 25 guys. Well let's see this for fucking lines. Four lines. Three guys in a line. That's 12 you've got two goaltenders that's 14 and then you've got like what? Eight defensemen? Something like that. Six to eight. Yeah. I'm going to say about 25 and then you got like the guys who don't get in the game, you know with the, with the WHO's hockey stuff doesn't smell it off. At least their, their practice stuff probably smells. I'm sure. How many players on a hockey tea? I'm gonna say 25.

Speaker 3:          00:35:54       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:35:55       Uh, under the NHL rules, each team is allowed to have up to 18 players with additional two goalkeepers for a total of 20. That's it. Well, there's really no, excuse me not knowing I was only 20 players. Right. That's when you're on a, on a crazy level of a sports fan is if you can name all fucking 20 players on your hockey team and all what 11 guys on the basketball team. Just for the simple fact that they fucking overlap, I would say. And by the way, my, my wife taped off the sports jeopardy set. We're hosted by Dan Patrick. But judging by some of the questions, it was a little dated, but uh, I was like, finally a jeopardy. I'm going to do well on it. And I still got my fucking ass kicked because it was, it was fucking hard shit. Like who is he like they had like, uh,

Speaker 3:          00:36:39       yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:36:40       uh, bankrupt teams, teams that went bankrupt yet to know the owner's name. If you know the owner's name, it's like you're watching fucking sports talk radio and all of that shit. Give me a fucking break. Wait, what? What's wrong with you? Yeah. I'll tell you right now our specialty fucking coach, you get to that level. You know what? I'm just babbling here. I don't have fucking time to do this. All I was doing was checking in on you and that, that's, that's the podcast. Have a great weekend yet conch and um, no, no, no, no. Why am I, why? You know what? Why do I say that? You know why I fucking say that? Because of defensive. If I actually said something nice to you, I'll be, ah, what are you a fucking show up date, right? Then my shoulders start coming up. I hope you guys have a wonderful rest of your week. I can't do this. I can't fucking do is have a great weekend. You fucking cuts. All right.

Speaker 6:          00:37:28       Can I see that in the most loving way possible? All right. Did that make you uncomfortable? Good. Welcome to my fucking world and a here. Let's do a little bit of music and then afterwards we'll play some, uh, some clips from a podcast scarred by Thursday. Then we'll just want to fucking half maybe on Monday. Who knows? Alright, go fuck yourself. So talk to your mother.

Speaker 7:          00:38:41       Hey, what's going on? Uh, Bill Bar and this is the money. Hey,

Speaker 8:          00:38:44       morning podcast, the first one for 2009. So I want to take some time to waste. So I tried to, I tried to, I tried to come out nice. I tried to start it by being a, I can't do it. I just can't say something nice. Why can't I just start my podcast to be like, hey, happy new year everybody. Hi. Hope you had a nice Christmas. You know, even though I feel that I, I can't get myself to say it. I have to market, I have to say happy new year. And it's silly voice, you know, I can't just be like, hey, happy, happy. I can't even do it. Happy New Year, you know, that doesn't sound happy or sad or angry. It just sounds like I'm reading it off the cue cards. We tried to give it the feeling it deserves. Hey, let me try again. Uh, oh. Oh, I got a phone call. Hang on one second. Hang on. Hang on one second. Hello.

Speaker 8:          00:39:44       Hey Dan. What's going on man? Uh, uh, I'm actually, I'm finishing up a podcast. Can I, can I call you right back in like, uh, oh, I do. I do buy, yeah. Okay. That's the fucking tax man. So it's the goddamn tax man. It'd be fucking year, I think. Hey, I actually got ahead a little bit and then what did they do to come out? And they just fucking, why I make the perfect amount of fucking money in this country. You know what I mean? I'm not rich enough to fucking afford somebody to tell the IRS to go fuck themselves and I'm not broke. So, um, I'm the fucking, you know what I am? And when you watch the discovery channel, you know that that fucking a gazelle that's walking with a limp. That's what I am. The fucking lines. Their ears perked up and they try to separate me from the fucking hurt.

Speaker 8:          00:40:34       That's who I am on the tax man comes around. Some God damn fucking assholes. All right. Sorry. You know potholes all up and down my fucking street. You know what I mean? Why don't I pay you when I just go down a fucking home depot and buy some Goddamn tar and I'll fell. Can you buy car at home depot? I'm sure you can, but God knows there's nobody there to help you find it. Huh? 50,000 fucking square foot store with 200 foot ceilings and they got like three people with aprons walking around. You ask him any question they don't know where the fuck fucking bitch shut up. Just go hang yourself with your right. But no, don't need, you're not, you're not the problem. You're not the problem. You get a poor worker. Sorry about that. Do you know what they actually did get those automated?

Speaker 8:          00:41:19       Uh, they got those automated cashiers out here at the grocery store and you know, I get out and there's a whole bunch of people just lining up, lining up doubt. The corporations fire other Americans. I swear to God, if you're one of my podcast members and you go to the grocery store and you can, you stand in that automated line, I want you to delete yourself as one of my friends. Okay? I have a zero fucking tolerance for that shit. It's, it's unbelievable how stupid people are and I love how they have like the one employee where his job is literally to stand there and teach you how to basically do his job so that they can then fire you. And I know what the corporation is going to do. They had, it's going to help cut costs on food. Really. You got eight people, they're making $8 an hour.

Speaker 8:          00:42:10       That's 64 bucks an hour. You've got a thousand people in here buying cornflakes. What? What do I save half a cent on my fruity pebbles? You fucking cunts. That was the first concert of 2009 right there. People stand in line, help keep a fellow American at work. Huh? Blah blah blah blah blah blah, blah, blah. Do it. I'm not even joking. Don't do that. Don't do that shit. These fucking parking structures with their pay stations. Now I have to be the parking attendant. I don't work here. I got to be for free. I got to do this for fucking free and put another guy out of work who now is walking around trying to find a job. Find a job for all I know he's going to start writing jokes. You know don't do that shit. Don't, don't. Okay. You know me? Yes. Actually you don't know me.

Speaker 8:          00:43:02       You think you know me cause he listened to me every Monday, but I'm telling something about myself. I don't give a fuck what you do. This is the one time where I'm going to get up on my goddamn soapbox. Okay. Which is really difficult for me because I've got a big head and my equilibrium starts to fuck with me when I stand up on soap boxes, which is why I don't preach, but I'm going to preach on this one. Do not do that. Go to the grocery store. Stand in line. Okay, let that mother of three keep her job. Okay. Or that, that fucking convicted drunk driver who was fine to put his life back together again. Let them keep their jobs. Do not stand in and learn how to do it. You're going to do their job for fucking free and it's not quicker and in the future you're going to have, she didn't have to fucking stand there. And you know what happens when you need a price check on a fucking cantaloupe. You have to go do it.

Speaker 8:          00:43:57       I don't, I just fucking blows my mind. We're already pumping our guests around gas people. When's it going to stop? Huh? Okay. I had a hell of a week. All right. Actually, you know what? I want to know how you guys feel about that stuff. Am I, am I, you know, do you feel like I have a really good point there because I feel I do all my, you know, if I was living in the 18 hundreds would I be the guy going stop churning butter? No. Keep churning butter. Don't let them do this for no, but that's not even the fair example because it's not like there was maybe that has a bunch of butter charters. If they could somehow come up with automated buttered butter churning. You know what? I really paid my pay to myself into a corner with that, that reference, I really had nothing.

Speaker 8:          00:44:41       They're all right, but I still think I made a good point there. All right, let's talk about my week. I had a fucking insane week and, um, I went to the rose bowl with a fellow comedian and uh, I'm not gonna name his name. Usually I'll do that. Maybe it gives somebody, you know, bump up their friends or that type of stuff, which I'd love to do for this guy, but not behavior was so, uh, colorful. That's the word I'll use that you know, just in case, you know what I mean? I'm old school. I don't name names. When I started talking about a semi crimes that I committed, not really committing, well I guess being drunk in public is a crime bill. Why don't you shut the fuck up and get to the story and we'll, I'll be the judge. Fine, fine. Look you guys with all the tension beginning of 2009 you know, so you guys be more relaxed this year.

Speaker 8:          00:45:32       You know things going to be fat and 2009 may the love bit, they gonna Rhyme, you know, just make it rhyme and then, then, then, then I'm supposed to feel good. You know, and I'm not supposed to notice that last year it was, things are going to be great in 2008 and now you've, you've knocked it down, outs, things. It'll be fine things. It'd be great man. I think he'd be fine. No, don't freak out in 2010 Ooh. Did they combine this with Canada in 2011 why am I fucking checking myself out at a grocery store and I'm not getting paid for it?

Speaker 8:          00:46:09       Okay, so my name is, I go to the rose bowl with a a comedian. We're just going to call him Joe. All right. Cause that's the classic alias name. When you don't want to get somebody in trouble, you just call him Joe. But the ironic thing is this guy's name is actually gel. So me and Joe, we go to the a fellow comedian and now you can try to figure out who the fuck he is and it's not fisco. Um, we go to the Rose Bowl and, uh, we had great intentions. Okay. And let me paint a picture for you. Okay. When you go to the rose bowl, it's one of the great tailgating experiences you'll ever have. First of all, you're going to the rose bowl. Okay? The granddaddy of them all home have a bunch of Superbowls Superbowls with fully that, that Super Bowl, uh, if you see that famous Lynn Swann catch that wasn't made there, I actually realized that was made at Temple University, wasn't it?

Speaker 8:          00:47:00       I don't fucking know. There's been a oh nine, although the Jackie Slater one where he dropped the ball, that's right. That that cowboy Steelers won the greatest fucking, I dunno, clash of two powerhouse teams I ever saw was the, uh, I dunno, whatever. They played a bunch of fucking things there. And I don't have any information front of me and I'm really killing the momentum of the story. So anyway, so we go there, right. And uh, you get right behind the Rosebowl is what I'm assuming is an 18 hole golf course. Cause God knows that's how big it felt at the end of the game when I was two shit faced and we couldn't find the car and we walked for four hours. But that, that I'm getting ahead of myself. You know what I'm foreshadowing, I'm doing what all great movies. Do you know what I mean? You go see a movie whenever they show movie about a guy who dies, everybody knows he's going to die. So they show them, died in the beginning, and then the next thing is they go back to his childhood. You know what I mean? Except they never do that with the Elvis movie. Cause then they'd have to start the movie with some fat fuck dying on a toilet and no one wants to do that.

Speaker 8:          00:48:06       I'll just, but it was that my pancreas plop. Um, anyways, so Jesus Christ, let's get some momentum here. So we fucking, we go to this tailgate. All right. And this is the deal. Basically, there's just two of us and amongst us, we have four hamburger patties, two bags of chips, hamburger buns, 12 pack of Bud Light, 12 pack of Budweiser, and a Clint Eastwood canteen, size of fucking crown royal, and to Cuban cigars that I snuck back from fucking Canada. So we're ready to go. I got my sunblock, we load it up into the Prius, which is, uh, which was just fucking hilarious. You know, everybody, everybody tries to outman people at the, uh, at the tailgates, people coming up there with, they have their fucking, you know, for two or pickups with the lift kits, you know, their generators, skydive fucking satellite dish in a flat screen TV.

Speaker 8:          00:49:10       You know, I came there with a little Hibachi, but whatever. We had the big thing of crown royal, so people and Cuban cigars. So no one fucked with us, right? So we're having a great time. All of a sudden this lady comes walking by and she's like, Hey, do you want to buy a little ticket holder for your ticket? I'm like, absolutely sweetheart, 10 bucks a whack. Let me get, let me get that. Two Times they had baby, you know, you got a cigar in your mouth, you start getting a little swagger, some reason when your leg starts rocking back and forth, like you've got to sing it like you're going to sing an Elvis song. I was failing it and the great thing was I didn't give a fuck about either team USC, all Penn State. I was just happy to fucking be there, you know?

Speaker 8:          00:49:49       But I quickly realized most people were for the Trojans. So automatically I'm a con second cons of the year. I'm like, you know what, I'm going to root for the, I'm a roof a Penn state because this gives me way more chance to annoy people. Plus I, I've never liked USC and uh, most of it has to do with back in the day, I used to be a Notre Dame fan before Lou Holtz. What? They're holier, holier than thou. We don't do steroids. Shut the fuck up. Yes you do. Alright. I had acne when I was fucking a teenager. Right? But it wasn't all over my back. And I also couldn't pick up a house. Okay, so you fucking, people are doing steroids anyways. And also I always hated the Trojans fight song. They play it every three seconds bad, you know, they came like half a yard. And it also reminds me of Fleetwood Mac who I never liked.

Speaker 8:          00:50:37       So fuck the Trojans, right? So anyways, so we're sitting there and we'd drink and party and would eat. We eat burgers and a, then we break up the crown royal after we had polished off a good half a case between the two of us. It's probably nine 30 in the morning. And we just started pounding this crown royal, which is going down like fucking Koolaid. I was really impressed with my ability, or at least the, the makers of crown royal. That is some smooth shit. So, uh, so basically we start walking towards the stadium and the alcohol slowing through me and that's when I go into the, my transformation. I don't know what happens to me at sporting events, but instantly I just become the loud guy. I feel like I'm, I'm doing a comedy show. I want to make the people around me laugh and I also want to irritate as many fucking people as I can.

Speaker 8:          00:51:27       So I start walking in there and I quickly notice, um, well I know I went to go buy a program, I'm trying to put this all back together cause I was pretty drunk. I go, just to give you an idea of, of the mood that I was in, I get to about a hundred yards from the stadium. This lady's selling programs and she's like, yeah, I get you probe the ad pack America gets a Parker Hanson. Like I fuck it. I want, I want a souvenir. So I'll walk up and Mike, how much are they? She's like, 10 bucks, my car, I find, so this other guy comes walking up because how much for the programs? And The lady's like 10 bucks, right? And the guy starts bitching. Be Kidding me, right? So I'm standing there, I got a Cuban cigar, I go, you know what, let me get another one, two times. Let me get two of those. All right, one for you over there. And the guy's like, really? I go, Hey, I go take a look at me. They know, you know you're looking at, you're looking at a big shot. Take a good look. There's not a, there's not a lot of us left. I swear to God, I said that and I was so drunk. I was only half joking.

Speaker 8:          00:52:31       Like I knew I was being an asshole, but like I was only half. I had a fucking Cuban cigar. Go Fuck Yourself. I'm a big shot. Let's get a program for this fag over here. Who's bitching about 10 pool still Roseville and bitches about a $10 fucking program. You know what I mean? He should have been de pants and he should had his tickets removed right there and sent right back to wherever the fuck he keep key came from, sent to an apple. Bee's watch the game there. All right. Kind of fucking behaviors that is the granddaddy of them all take you fucking money out and play the Goddamn game. All right. So anyway, saw him Hammock, right. And we're fucking, we're walking. And uh, I don't know what happened. We got into the stadium, everything was cool. And then they have this weird sort of like they funnel you in, cause it's a really old stadium.

Speaker 8:          00:53:19       It's like, you know, it's like trying to go through the Lincoln tunnel like five o'clock at night. It's a pain in the ass. So I'm standing there, I'm getting frustrated because it's getting close to kickoff and I hate missing kickoff. So I'm getting pissed. And I noticed that the Penn state fans, they got this chant where one of them, I don't know where it just yells, we are. And then all the Penn state fans go Penn state. And then the dude yells again we are and they'll go Penn state and they say it like five times and then the end, the guy who starts to chant goes thank you. And then everybody screams Yo, well cub. And I immediately noticed that it annoyed the shit out of all these USC fence. You know, cause they kind of felt like it was a home game cause they were out there.

Speaker 8:          00:53:59       So next thing you know, I don't even think it. Next thing you know, coming out of my mouth, I'm going, well I'm not here. I'm not from Penn state. I don't know Shit, right? But I just start going, we, everybody starts going Penn state, Penn state, and I'm like, thank you. And they're like, Yo, welcome. I'm like, this is fucking awesome. I can do this the whole game and annoy the shit out of people around me. So like it took us 20 minutes, 20 minutes to get through the tunnel and I swear to God, I was like, perfect timing light. As we got through the tunnel, this check is finishing singing the national anthem as we just take in the Roseville on a sunny California day, everybody's wearing their Trojan colors. Everybody's wearing that Penn state. There's pawpaws people are going fucking nuts. And this lady's like, and no home of the brave. And what is, she finished a fucking stealth bomber. Flies right over the God damn top. I'm shift, right? It's like a fucking acid trip. I almost passed out. Right? So now, you know, we've got end zone seats, you know, evidently I'm not a big shot and we'll wait at the top of the stadium, which is a really rough thing to negotiate when you're a redhead drinking whiskey in the sun, right?

Speaker 8:          00:55:21       We get all the way up to like row whatever fucking triple f and you know it's an old stadium. Okay. And you know, back in the day, like you were tall if you will, like five foot six when the stadium was built. And now you know, with fucking growth hormones and all the preservatives in the food, we basically outgrown the stadium's, not to mention the cheesecake factories that have these fucking people go to every other day. So I'm trying to walk a tight rope down. I'm really acting this out of my bedroom by the way. This is how into the stories I get to tell. So I'm literally walking a fucking tight rope trying to get down to my seat and I just become that guy. I fell, I didn't fall. I sorta like, like [inaudible]. It was like almost like I was on a show. I was the only guy in a ship that was in a fucking perfect storm and all of a sudden the whole thing just lifted to the right side.

Speaker 8:          00:56:11       And I landed on this like 55 year old lady back then like land like I was doing. I was on one foot and I, I put a nice forearm, oh I'll Samuelson in front of the net fucking action right on a pack. And I was so drunk it took me, I swear to God that at least 28 seconds to get offer in the entire time I am apologizing with my fucking cigar whiskey breaths just gone Psi Phi and I just, I couldn't get off it cause I, the only way to get off of was to put all my weight on my forum and use her as a banister to push me back up because nobody's fucking helping me cause I'm obviously the drunk guy. You don't want to touch me. So 28 seconds to trying to figure out if I have the quad strength to pull myself up without pushing off the back of this old lady's neck.

Speaker 8:          00:57:04       I finally just say fuck it and just drive my, the Meta, my forearm right between her shoulder blades and I get up, I apologize profusely and I don't know what Joe is doing at this point. He was fucking probably just standing there watching the game. But basically we finally get to our seats. It was unreal. I didn't know what, we got to our seats and I, we turn around, we faced the game to watch the game and next thing you know this lady is just screaming at us. She's like that screaming and she's yelling, you can't smoke in here. And I'm like, what the fuck is she talking about? Because I put my my cigar out. I'm going to tell you to do the fucking Cuban is sweet too, man. I smoked that thing all the way down like a Goddamn Roach. It's like burning my fucking fingers and she's yelling, stop smoking.

Speaker 8:          00:57:54       I'm like the fuck she talking about do I smell like a cigar? And I turned, I looked, I looked to my right and Joe is standing there with the fucking Cuban cigars still lit and his mouth. I don't know how the fuck you got a past security. I think it's, cause we had our tickets, those tickets, things I bought arrived on neck. I don't know if he had it down by his side, but he's sitting at chomp on, on it like fucking Archie bunker. So you know, in defense of me, if she just turned around and she had just said, hey guys, um, you know that, you know, I don't know if you know, but there's no smoking in here. Yeah, I would have been, you know, I'm a happy drunk. I swear to God, I'm angry when I'm sober, but I sorta, I'm a happy drunk.

Speaker 8:          00:58:35       I just would have been like, Hey, aside bought that, we didn't know. Oh, what do you for you? I see. All right, good luck. Bye. Ha Ha, whatever. I would've kept it at that, but she fucking was yelling at us. So I don't like being yelled at. And I like being, I like fucking with people and I'm shit faced and Joe is of the same ilk. And then that's when it all started. She just based, she's like, Hey, she goes, there's no smoking in here. And then immediately I just go and I just go. I'm just like, Hey, said. So she goes to California, I had a smoke and doors were like, we're outside. And she goes, you're not allowed to smoke here. And I go, you're not my mother. This isn't our section. This is in your section. Turn around. Right. I just kept being an asshole.

Speaker 8:          00:59:22       And then finally she goes, I'm going to call security. And I'm like, call column. She goes, I've got to call him. I go, go ahead and call him. And then in my head, my brain is going, Bill, shut up, shut up. You're going to get, we're 90 seconds into the game, you're going to get kicked out. And I just couldn't stop myself. I just kept saying column, column, and then, then she made some sort of comment, I think about the size of Joe's knows, and then he said, hey, he goes, you need to lose a hundred pounds to talk to me, bitch. He said, the guy to the left of us turns around and he's like, Hey, I got my kid, I got my kid here, what do you cursive? And then Joe goes, well then don't bring them to a fucking football. So now I'm doing that last, you know that laugh.

Speaker 8:          01:00:20       We're like, your mouth is wide open but there's no air coming in or out. I'm having the time of my life and then the fucking guy goes, he goes, I'm going to call security. And then I'm just, then at once again, I'm going, God, I'm going to call it God and call up call. I was just calling that bluff because we were so fucking jam packed and I knew they weren't going to walk down there and go do that. So that lady makes another fucking comment. At which point Joe makes another comment about her weight and then she just turns down and it's like mark and yells down to a husband and next thing you know this fucking dude comes running over and he starts screaming at us as he's screaming at us. This spray is coming out of his mouth all over his wife.

Speaker 8:          01:01:06       So it was easy. I had a fucking, Nah, I was just going, sir, sir, you're spitting on your wife and once you know, I hope it was pathetic. He was like 53 but like, and I'm 40 and I'm thinking like that. I'm not too old to fight this guy. You know, it was just, Oh God, I'm front pieces together. And so when we all sit down, right? So then we sit down. I think Joe had put out the cigar. Maybe it was just holding it down. I don't know what was going on. But now by this time we'd already missed the kickoff. The Trojan's get the ball and I think this is the basically the one good play Penn state made all day. They Trojans their first play. I think offense, they handed off the ball and they tried to do like some sort of sweep the Penn state defense strung out and just stuck this guy either for no gain or for like lots of one yard.

Speaker 8:          01:01:58       And then Joe go, I forgot to mention is a good six foot four, just a huge guy just starts screaming like an inch from the back of the Lady's head who's a Trojan Fan. He just starts screaming life, not the head. Not that, not that I can't believe like her hair wasn't, he was yelling so loud as she, I know. She turned around and she'd had that shift of noxious. That's just, it was, it was, it was great. It was fucking great. And then basically what would have for the rest of the game, shit would calm down and then we would, we would, I don't know, we would mumble something about her and then she would fucking yell down to her husband and that he'd come over threatening to kick our ass and we would just laugh at them. And then, I dunno, I just realized I was so drunk.

Speaker 8:          01:02:50       I can't even remember the rest. I remember it was the very end of the game, uh, somebody Joe us, somebody said something about the score and then the lady in front of us goes, yeah, I'm surprised you can count that high. I go, yeah, why don't you try counting calories? Right. Something real me like that. And then once again, she's like mark. And then at this point, half the crowd and left because it was such a blow out. This too comes over and he starts fucking screaming at me. It doesn't scream at Joe because Joe six foot four, he yells at me cause I'm fucking barely five 10 and I'm a fucking redhead. Right? Even with the shaved head, I still look like fucking howdy doody. So he starts yelling at me and he keeps telling me, yeah, I'm going to fire you down on the field.

Speaker 8:          01:03:32       That's why he kept saying, he kept telling me he's going to grab me and fire me down on the fucking field. And I was just, you know, and I was just being an asshole. That did do it. I'm gonna fight. Are you said that you already said that. You already said you already said it. You fucking cunt. All right, if you're going to do it, you would have and you didn't see you're not so sit down and shut the fuck up. Which is funny. Cause by the end of the game, everyone in the stands somehow liked us and hated those people. I mean path of it was cause they were assholes. The other half was, they couldn't hear the shift that we will mumble him at this dude's wife Poo. I know at this point he might have a little bit of sympathy for it, but I mean I'm telling you she was, she was, uh, she was an asshole and she's the one who made it personal first.

Speaker 8:          01:04:21       She made the comment about Joe's knows she, uh, oh she was doing real hacky lines too. She's told me I was ugly. She goes and I always can lose weight, you know, which, uh, I believe I saw during the second season of def jam and um, you know, and I thought, well we will come in with was a lot more clever and if it was a battle of the bands in a standup situation, I think we want. So, uh, basically what ended up happening, I know this is a long ass fucking story. I don't even have time for questions this week, but long story short, we ended up walking out. Um, I want, I believe that somehow the lady in front of us to who was being a jerk had a bunch of these dark streaks on the back of a shirt towards the end of it.

Speaker 8:          01:05:06       I don't know what it was and almost look like a ashes from a cigar. But um, I know that that didn't happen because there's no smoking in there. But anyways, we go to leave and we're basically so drunk. I don't know, man. It took us like fucking nine hours, literally took us 50 minutes to find our car. I think it was calmer for being such assholes in, in, in, in the stadium. And I don't, I don't know who the fuck set up the parking lot, the things out there. But they basically, the way they do the sections on this golf course is they have like balloons that they just have numbers, number one, number two, number three. But they're not lit up. So you can't really seem at night. So you walk out of the stadium drunk and you look up and you see, I saw the number to where we were, where we were parked and, but you know, you've got to follow the path because you can't walk through the sand traps and shit like that.

Speaker 8:          01:06:02       So you look down for half a second, then you look up and it's like a big fucking oak tree in front of you and now you don't know where you are. It's like the end of the shining without the shrubs. It's a fucking golf course, right? So, and you're far enough away from the stadium where you can't get your bearings. And we just wandering around and around and around and it's getting to the point like, you know, like hypothermia is becoming an issue because it's a desert. It starts getting cold, was shit faced and we just can find a car. It was like the Blair witch. We kept coming back to the same goddamn ladies' teas, whatever the fuck we were. And then I lost all confidence in my ability to find the damn car. So I started following Joe, who is convinced, even though we both know where we're parked in section two, we went from section three to section 40, section five, and he keeps telling me to go in that direction because for some reason he thinks numerically it's going to go three, four, five to, I dunno, it took us an hour to find the fucking car.

Speaker 8:          01:07:04       And uh, at that point I started sobering up and I started thinking about our behavior and I was starting to thinking like, and I kinda kinda feeling an asshole. Yeah. You know, I shouldn't say I shouldn't taken the higher ground even though they'd throw was a content, you know? And he was just like, what are you talking about? What are you talking about? You, she was a con. We treated her like one and a half and that's it. It's quite a lot about that guy. He just, he just breaks it down to the simplest fucking point. Hey Buddy, I got my kid here. What don't take your kid to a fucking football game, which you know, I know that's harsh, especially if you have kids, but think about it. Think about it. Why would you bring your kid to his professional, so to sporting event?

Speaker 8:          01:07:47       Not only that, that the guy with the kid is being hypocritical because he was me before he had a kid. All right? He was having the time of his fucking life and what now? Because he has a kid now all of a sudden I'm supposed to, I'm supposed to fucking act my age. You know, it's like the fucking baby boom generation. They Bang so much the fucking in the mud Woodstock that by the time I come around there's herpes and aids and all this shit and then these, you know, and then they come around with their don't do drugs where a condom shit after they had the time of their fucking lives. I'm so glad all of them and getting that whole generation is getting hip replacements now with their fucking cause. They all had that fucking Olivia Newton John High impact aerobics tape that they did try and to stay in shape and it's the one good fucking thing.

Speaker 8:          01:08:31       Consider I got to fuck with the God damn trash bag around my dick my entire career. Right. The very least, I at least knew to stretch before you lifted weights. And I also dangers of high impact aerobics. Okay. When I did my aerobics, I definitely was rocking the leg warmers, but I did not let my feet leave the ground. Okay. So anyways, so that's my rose bowl story. Um, it's a fucking law when I know that, but I think it had some nice moments. But um, yeah. But getting back to that, what do you guys think about that stuff? You know, sporting events are not for children. Okay. And I know they always try to talk about the good old days of sports. The good ole days of sports is bullshit. Okay. When I was a kid, first football game I went to, I was fucking terrified.

Speaker 8:          01:09:21       I was terrified. It was not a place for kids. It was a place for adults who hadn't achieved what they thought they were going achieve in life to get their fucking anger and frustration out. People with in loveless marriages, you know, people, you know, people who could tell they were going to get laid off the next week or maybe the rd got laid off and they just wanted to get it out. Okay. And they, you know, they've now turned going to a fucking football game into like you're standing in line with a bunch of people waiting to get their kids, you know, photo taken with Santa Claus. You know, and even if you go further back than my childhood, which was seventies, early eighties, um, you go back to the 1950s they talk about that. Oh, the good old days is sports or what do you mean? What, what, when, uh, when they finally let a black guy playing baseball and they said, we'll fucking black cat on the field and all that racist shit that was going on.

Speaker 8:          01:10:12       Can you imagine the shit that was getting yelled in? The stands when Billy crystal was going down to la to go down and go and watch the mic boy, Oh boy, I've got myself a hot dog and assessed Barilla. You know, they always tell us stories about how great it was back then. It wasn't, it wasn't great. They were way more racist, way more ignorant, way more sexist. And people went to the games and they saw Johnny Unitas. Okay, so now for some reason, now it's my turn to be an asshole and be a drunk and have a good time and all of a sudden I have to take everything down a level, you know, not now. Now it's, it's Chuckie cheese time. It isn't. And I know you guys are saying, well that's because you don't have a kid right now. No, fuck that.

Speaker 8:          01:10:51       Fuck that. I wouldn't bring my kid to the game. Or if I brought to give to the game, I would prepare him. I prepare them, you know, this is what's going to happen. Okay, you might see a fight, you know, hey dad might even get in one. No, I'm not. I never took it to that level. But you know what I mean? I think, uh, I dunno, it just felt guilty. I am for my, my behavior that they actually pulled up a quote from George Orwell who, uh, granted this is from Wikipedia, which the other day I looked up something that I knew something about and was completely inaccurate. But this is according to Wikipedia, George Orwell said, serious sport has nothing to do with fairplay. It's a bound up. It's bound up with hatred, jealousy, boastfulness disregard of all rules and sadistic pleasures, pleasures in witnessing violence.

Speaker 8:          01:11:44       In other words, it's war minus the shooting. Exactly. Now, why the fuck would you bring a child to that? And not only that, when was George Orwell alive a long fucking time ago? I don't know when he was alive. When did you write? 1984 he didn't write it in 83. I know that he wouldn't like the 30. Stinney I'm just saying. And See, that's how he described sports back then. So guys, like, you know, these Billy crystal guys were always do those little heartwarming stories about, uh, you know, their baseball cards and going down to the baseball stadium and acting like it was this fucking, you know, this time that was lost, you know, George Orwell right there, according to Wikipedia, the guy proved my point. I'm a moron, but I did have a good time and I'm gonna tell you like this right now, if you ever get a chance in your life to smoke a Cuban cigar, definitely do it all right.

Speaker 8:          01:12:35       Because I'm not even a big smoker. And I could tell how fucking amazing that cigar was because I've drank fine wines and I can't tell the difference, you know? And it took me a long time to be comfortable with myself. You know, when you go through the whole long process of spinning the big red wine glass around, I see red up on wine to try to learn. So I, I, you know about it. So I wouldn't feel so fucking stupid when they bring a nice bottle of wine over and I'm like, you know, this tastes like the shit I used to drink in high school. You know, I learned that, you know, red wine. The reason why it's in a bigger glass because I'm about the oxygen and you want it to breathe more and how to, you know, move it around the fucking table and then you shove your fucking nose all the way in it and yet put it in.

Speaker 8:          01:13:19       You switch it all around your mouth. I got all the moves down and I'm like swallowed up Mike. Yes. This tastes like every other fucking red wine I've ever had. That's not true. I can tell the difference between like, you know, a Cabernet or low or something like that. But like I can't tell like the difference between a 1499 bottle and a, a $60 bottle and uh, you know, I guess I'm trying to say with this podcast, I'm not that culture. Okay. All right. Well, so why don't you guys chime in with that. Okay. Like, well, do you think David, they should have a kids section. Should they just have a Chucky cheese section? It's not my fault. You're knocked her up and you can't go to a game and have a good time now. You know, you want to be getting drunk with me.

Speaker 8:          01:14:03       See what I just did there. That's how I made myself write, made this guy who can't even defend himself, uh, actually be secretly agreeing with me. That's how I do it. Um, did I mentioned I have a rat problem. Um, I have, uh, I have a really nice apartment, but the garage I have is a glorified shack. Like if they ever decide to do the Hatfields and McCoys TV series, they could shoot it on location in my garage. Okay. Is a rotting out hunk of shit. And even though the door comes down, um, the hole and the back of the garage, he, granted you couldn't drive my car out of it, but a fucking rat could crawl into it on a rainy night and then crawl up into my engine and sleep. This mother Fucker, I took my car down to get it service and they took out the air conditioner filter and it was rat shit in there and I got to for everybody going, Oh God is good.

Speaker 8:          01:14:59       So you know, being a man, I'm like, okay, operation kill the fucking rat is now in motion. And I sat there and I thought, how can I kill this motherfucker? And basically what I did was I went to um, a smaller hardware cause fuck home depot in there, eight people in aprons, um, and I bought $114 worth of those rat glue traps and I got a couple of really big cardboard boxes and then I took some duct tape because when you don't know what the fuck you're doing, duct tape is always a solution. And I duct taped 28 of these motherfuckers, I think over 30, I think I lost count how many I did on all these boxes, two big boxes, side by fucking side. And I split them underneath my car. Okay, you want to get dry? Why don't you try to get, try and get by that now?

Speaker 8:          01:16:02       I don't know cause rats are intelligent. I don't know if what I have in my garage right now is the star wars plan that Ronald Reagan always dreamed of. I don't know if I have the red version of that or if I have the Maginot line, you know, national line. Anybody, any man you want to read up on that one. That's one of the classic military blunders of all time. Basically Germany invaded France in world war one. It was trench warfare, ton, ton of loss of life. They came in, they got invaded, they got overrun and all that, blah blah, blah, blah blah shit. So they wanted to make sure they would never happen again because they were worried about Germany, you know, and why wouldn't you Ben? So they decided to build like this is called the Maginot line and it was permanent trenches with these, these fucking basically built in.

Speaker 8:          01:16:57       I don't live like an anti, it wasn't anti aircraft. That was the problem that killed him. It was fucking, uh, like machine gun nest, like permanent all the way around. And they spent all this fucking money on it. And what's hilarious is by the time they went to war with Germany again, they had perfected the aircraft and they basically just flew right up and over all the fucking trenches. You don't drop bombs on him and shit. And they once again took over fucking France. And I'm so, I don't know. I don't know if the rat laughed at it, brought in the, you know, a couple of friends over to shit inside of my car, but I'm going to kill that fucker. And all you animal lovers can go fuck yourselves because I'm not losing a $23,000 automobile to a fucking road. All right, I'm going to show him why I live inside.

Speaker 8:          01:17:43       All right. And I don't have to shit on an air conditioner filter filter. Okay, let's get the podcast questions, Shelly people. Um, I'll let you guys know how it goes if I kill the rat or not. All right. Podcast question number one. Bill since you're a patriots fan, I got to ask you, what's your honest opinion on the Tuck rule game? Uh, I'm a raider fan and I think that was hands down the biggest bullshit call and the history of sports. And still to this day I carry it with me. The fact that the eight ne charges made the playoffs over the 11 and five patriots made me happy inside. And while I respect Tom Brady is one of the great all time. Qbs if he snapped his leg in three places, places I'd be a happy man. Okay. Um, for those of you who aren't big sports fans, the Tuck rule was basically is basically a rule where the quarterback, if he goes, I basically goes into the passing motion, doesn't throw the ball and if he brings it back to his chest, if somebody whacks the ball out, then it's a considered an incomplete pass or something.

Speaker 8:          01:18:50       I really should have looked up the tuck rule and um, and you know, basically the Raiders slap the ball out of Brady's hand. They fell on it. They had thought they won the game because it was a fumble. And then the, the, they brought out this the top rule, which nobody had ever heard of, including probably Tom Brady. Um, when he wants to know what is my feeling on that? Um, I don't feel it was a big relax, let me finish. I don't feel it was the biggest bullshit call in the history of sports. I think it's the biggest bullshit rule in the history of sports. That's the thing. They made the right call. The rule needed to be changed. I think it's a bullshit rule. I think that that should have been a fumble. It is a fumble. He didn't talk and he was going to throw it and he didn't.

Speaker 8:          01:19:36       And then he pulled in, he got slapped. It is a fumble, but that's what it should be. But because of the Tuck rule, it was actually the right call. But it's a bullshit rule and I'm big enough to admit that. But the reality is, you know, why that happened to you and why you carry that with you. Oh, poor baby. You've had to carry that since. What, 2001 Aww. Poor baby. You know what I had to carry for almost 20 years was that roughing the passer call. You're probably too young to remember this, but we basically beat the fucking Raiders in 1976 we had you guys beating sugar bay. Hamilton is coming in against Ken Stabler. He jumps in the air. Once again, I'm acting this out. He jumps in the air as stabler is going to release the ball. He's in the fucking air. The ball is released.

Speaker 8:          01:20:27       He slams into Ken Stabler and they call roughing the passer like he was supposed to change mid air. Now, I don't know if you guys know this shit, but back then roughing the passer was not a yardage penalty. They basically put the ball where they were trying to complete it and it was the end of the game and they threw a fucking 50 yard hail Mary. They called roughing the passer, so they gave him the ball. Now it's not on the 50 they put it on like the fucking three yard line and the Raiders went in to go score that. My friend was the biggest bullshit call of all time because that was a complete wrong interpretation of the rule. Do you understand the difference? The top rule is a bullshit rule that was interpreted correctly. So the guy made the correct call. He did make the correct call, but I feel for you because that was a bullshit that was a, it's a bullshit rule and the Raiders should have won that game.

Speaker 8:          01:21:22       But that was paid back because the Patriots should have beat you in 1976 but because a lot of you rate of fans are a lot younger, you don't remember it or maybe you don't want to remember it, but I carried that from 1976 to 2001 all right, so that was 15 years. All right, youngster, you're only seven years in the yard. Bullshit. So I have no sympathy for you. Okay. Sorry. I get heated when it comes to sports and he said something that was the next one. What's your, what's your opinion on the field goal guy? You know, every bunch of guys. I don't want to fucking read this one. I only went too long and that when I get get tickets and some other people, I don't mind field goal kickers by the my, sorry. I still got my old laptop. I'm trying to not hit this button too much.

Speaker 8:          01:22:06       All right, Bill. Um, I want your can be comedic opinion on something. I was talking to a coworker of mine about a girl that I had been seeing. Oh, I love this question. This is a great story. Everybody just settle in, settle in and turn this, turn this down. Turn this down because I think this has, does this have the word continent? A mature. Okay, here we go. All right, Bill, I want your comedic opinion on something. I was talking to a coworker of mine about a girl that I had been seeing that I've been kind of seeing. I was telling him that one thing I really like about her is how he wrote the song, how her, how good her smell, her hair smells. Um, well there's Twat of a girl that works with me, overheard us, and decided to chime in by saying shit like she wants, she wants to meet the girl who would go out with a guy like me and how she would actually be nervous to be alone with me.

Speaker 8:          01:23:04       All right. I know my reading out loud skills suck. So let me just sort of paraphrase what happens. This guy's at work, he's kind of seeing this girl and he says to a friend of his gay, you know, seeing this girl, you know, I really love him. Her hair smells really great. That's all we have in the send instant conversation. And then this other girl who's not even in the conversation as a guide, let, I'd let them meet the girl out like you, you know, I'd be nervous to be alone with you. Right? Completely uncalled for. And he goes, et cetera. So now we recently found out that that girl who chimed in just had an abortion like a week and a half ago. Jesus brought, I brushed her off. I saw I brushed her off, but the bitch didn't stop. She continued on by asking, Ugh, another female worker, if she'd be nervous to be alone with me, which my response was, why don't you ask, why don't we ask someone what it's like to be alone with you.

Speaker 8:          01:24:02       Oh, wait a minute. That's right. You killed it. Wow. Wow. Wow. Dude. You said that at work. Wow. Okay. Okay. And he basically says, which shocked half of the people at work and made the other half crack up laughing. She called me an insensitive asshole. Yeah. Okay. But I could care less. To me. She was asking for it. It's not like she was just sitting there minding her own business and I walked up and said, what's new fetus killer? What do you think bill? Was I out of line or was it a kick ass? Come back. Okay. Let me wrap my fucking head around this. Um, all right. First of all, it was an unbelievable come back. It was a game set and match come back. You know, it was literally, you know, I dunno, she didn't even bring a knife to a gunfight. She was sitting there with a water pistol and you took out a machete and you fucking chopped her head off and I dunno, held it up for everyone to see and then you swung her, her fucking head around by the ponytail and threw it across the offices.

Speaker 8:          01:25:22       Basically what you did. Um, well what do you think was I Adeline? Yeah, I'm going to have to say yes because I totally understand why you went there. Like why you wanted to hurt her back because what she was saying to you was fucked up, but she was fucked up on like level two and then you went right to the penthouse level. You know what I mean? I might even say level two, she was a good, she was a good a third of the way up the building. Okay. I don't know why I'm using a building as an analogy, but I'm too deep now. I have to go with this. But you, you went right to the penthouse suite and you kicked her ass right off of it and you didn't even do it on the side. You know where they have that, that canopy thing with a bellman stance.

Speaker 8:          01:26:09       We're in a three stooges mover. You'd somehow live, you kicked her out the backside of the building right down into the fucking alley with as a rat waiting to crawl up into my fucking car. Um, yeah. What I would, what, I don't know how old you are, but yeah, you kind of went, well you didn't have to go where you, what you have to do as you get older, both men and women as psychologically, you have to realize where they're coming from and you have to understand, especially knowing that she had just had an abortion dude, which is fucking, is, is, that's brutal for a guy to go through. You know, if you have any sort of a conscious, forget about a woman who's actually carrying it, you know what I'm saying? And so the reason why she's saying that she obviously is having difficulty with her own relationships and it's so fucking insecure that to hear someone around her actually maybe making some sort of connection and be happy in that area of her life is fucking with her so much that it wasn't enough just to say the mean shit to you.

Speaker 8:          01:27:19       She starts walking around the office like trying to get people to like reinforce her statement and to sort of cock block you. And, um, I understand why, why you did that, you know, you know, and you gotta understand why you went to that level. Okay. You went literally to that level that had nothing to do with her. That adds some shit to do the baggage you are bringing. I don't know what house you sound like you came from a household like my household where, uh, you know, somebody makes fun of your shirt and you're like, yeah, at least my fucking uncle is in bed. You know, you know, you just admit, you immediately go way beyond what was just said to you. So, uh, was it out of line? Definitely. Adeline. Dude, you shouldn't say shit like that at work. I don't want you to lose your job, but you know, I'm not gonna lie to you. It was fucking hilarious. And not to mention who to fall after my rose bowl story. Who the fuck am I to say anybody was on the line? I'm thinking, you know what, I'm and this is like your story. Know I'm trying to break it down. How you ended up there is where I'm at as a human being right now, I'm still doing the what's new fetus killer lines. But I'm trying not to do that. You know, it's funny on a comedy stage, but it's, it's not funny at the Rose Bowl.

Speaker 8:          01:28:43       All right? But dude, I got, I gotta give you, you know, I gotta give you a fucking over the phone high five on that one. That was just, wow. Why don't we ask someone who's been with alone with you? Oh, wait a minute. That's right. You killed it. There's no way people burst out laughing. That's one of those things. If you've found it funny, you made that, you know, you raise your eyebrows up like holy shit and you gotta walk away. You know what I mean? Somehow there has to be a corner within 10 yards for you to walk around so you can let that laugh go. God Damn it. That's, it was brutal. But that was funny. Come on, women. You've got to laugh. You've got to know. That's funny. I know. I know. It's brutal for, come on. That was funny. Okay. Uh, where are we going?

Speaker 8:          01:29:27       Where are we going? All right, Milena. Sports questions. All of a sudden people are really liking the sports. Okay, another question. Bill. What happened to our beloved teams? This is a Boston person. Do the Patriots, try and keep Matt Cassel knowing Tom Brady is rehabbing. His Rehab is slightly behind. Uh, do the jets offer back the second round? They gain from spygate back for the pets. Oh man, you gone real detail. I have no idea what's happened to our beloved. The patients had an unbelievable season and what I love about it is everyone was questioning bill. Bill Parcell, Bill Parcells, Bill Belicheck because of the spy gate thing. And uh, you know, look at this year after winning with the six round pick three Superbowls, seventh round draft pick, he goes 11 and five and almost once a division, I think he's proven himself as a fucking coach. And uh, people always be like, oh, fucking spygate.

Speaker 8:          01:30:20       But they got nothing. They don't have an argument. And a, the reason why I said bill Parcells is because I really think that that guy is overrated. You know, I think he's really good at making a team good, but he can't get them over the top. And he throws temper tantrums when he doesn't get his way. And he totally, he's like the Larry Brown of football, you know, he's only won two super bowls, 86 and [inaudible] 90. And who was his fucking defensive coordinator? Bill Belicheck. All right. He got to the Superbowl again with the Patriots. Who was his defensive coordinator? Bill Belicheck. Right. You see bill Bellacheck has gone on. It's won three Superbowls parcels has one, nothing, one, nothing. He changed the colors of the team. He definitely gets a winning tradition going on there, but he doesn't win. So I'd rather have Bella check you in order to realize he's a great coach.

Speaker 8:          01:31:13       I'm just still pissed that he'd, he announced that he was leaving our team a week before we were going to play a Superbowl for his own selfish reasons. I really annoyed me. All right. Question number was even on four. Okay. For those of you not into sports, here we go. Here's the non sports stories. Uh, Bill, when you do an appearance on a big show like Letterman or Conan, what's the protocol for meeting the other guests? Does the show hooked that up automatically or the guests isolated from each other and the dressing room and green rooms? Uh, the reason I ask is NBC just recently had a replay of your cone, an episode that you appeared on with Keira Knightley was the headliner. I assume one of the perks and doing the show is getting to check out a famous chicken person, right? Um, no you don't.

Speaker 8:          01:31:58       You are on a entirely different floor than the actual famous people. You're just the comedian. So I don't know what it's like to do panel. I've never done panel. That's kind of one of my goals here for 2009 maybe I can do pony a panel on one of the later, later shows like Carson Daly and I just have to have something to hype. Maybe I can do that then I'd love to do that. But I've only been a comedian. So basically, you know, you're on kind of on your own floor. Um, on Letterman you're aren't, you have like your own Florida yourself, which is cool and kind of creepy. And then on Conan, you're, when I did call in and you know what, I def you definitely more, I don't know where they put the famous people because I'm not near them. But I did walk out and after Chuck Norris did his sketch, I made sure when he walked by me, I shook his hand, you know, thinking like that hand ship Bruce Lee's hand, you know what I mean?

Speaker 8:          01:32:54       Or at least blocked his fucking kick or some shit and whatever movie that was a, but no, no, you don't get to meet those people. Some, some people are cool. You know, I remember once the first time we did Conan, Mary Tyler Moore walked by, looked into my room, smiled and said hello. Um, you know, I think a lot of times people are sitting back there thinking, what stories am I going to tell you? Get your head together and you already have your crew of people, you know, people who book you and that type of stuff. And um, cause personally before I go out and do my set, like literally, you know, once the show starts after the first segment, I kind of send, you know, all my people out of the room so I can kind of just basically remember what my opening joke is. So they go, all right, um, question numbers or whatever we're on.

Speaker 8:          01:33:42       I have these numbered wrong for some reason, says three, even though oil and it's like five. Uh, I have a question about your storytelling ability. When you told the story about getting the hot dog from pinks, it was not only hilarious, but I felt like I was there. I suck at being able to replay the funny shit that happens to me, my family is and friends. Does your story ability come naturally or is it something that you've worked on? How do you put together a good story? Um, I'm actually not the greatest storyteller. I digress a lot and I'm trying to get to get to the meat of it a lot better. Um, but yeah, just kind of comes from telling a lot of stories, but uh, but don't beat yourself up man. You know, there's a lot of people who can't tell a story, but it's more like they are the story, you know what I mean?

Speaker 8:          01:34:27       Like, um, I dunno, I got a good friend of mine who he does the funniest shit ever and he as you on the ground, he does shit offstage. I wouldn't do onstage. And he has you on the ground laughing, but he read, tells the story. It. It doesn't sound like anything funny happened, but like in the moment, he's like the funniest guy ever. Like a, it's weird. Like, I don't know how I told that Rosebowl story. I was just trying not to get the other dude in trouble, but the other dude kind of was the story. Joe was fucking hilarious. Um, I dunno. And then afterwards I'm, I'm telling the story. I'm the story guy. I tell the fucking story, but I'm not the fucking story. All right. I'm just a sad little man we telling shit that I didn't do. Okay. Question number six.

Speaker 8:          01:35:12       Um, all right. Hey, what's the word? Uh, Oh, you know what? I got this one totally wrong. The, I, if someone asked me the other day, a couple of weeks back about what I think about the Chicago Blackhawks, I was only mildly paying attention to them. I didn't realize how good they were, the sheer, and I started watching them. Um, I think that they're going to go maybe a couple rounds into the playoffs this year. And, um, I'll see. You asked me why the flux or the Bruins get rid of the Thornton and I, you know, was saying why, you know, they kind of blamed our shortcomings on him, but I forgot that we got, we got Phil Kessel in that trade. So we did get something sort of a trying to correct something there. All right, let me try to get to the rest of these. All right. Uh, here's the new year's resolutions.

Speaker 8:          01:35:58       People, I know. This is getting long new year's resolutions. Um, I never, yeah, you know what, why do I hate my shit? This we can go be at the Improv and Tampa, go to Improv, the number two.com for all the information where you can click right on my homepage. Please come out to see me at the Improv in Tampa. I got a whole new hour is shit. And um, yeah, come on man. Can't be just listening to me for free and my podcast. I know it's a tough economy, but for the Christ sake, come out and fucking support me. All right, New Year's resolutions. Um, all right. Fill a lot of people who were against him. Here's a guy I have. No, I never understood the logic of new year's resolutions that's turning 64 other days a year when one can decide to do something better for themselves.

Speaker 8:          01:36:37       Perhaps it's another marketing scheme for capitalists. Bloodsuckers I'm hoping that we will make another hoping that we'll make another irrational decisions. It's not really a, it's more of a statement. I kind of agree with that. Um, I absolutely hate new years resolutions. People trick themselves into believing that the best time to make changes and start things is at the beginning of the year. I don't make New Year's resolutions because they are an unnecessary. I start every new year off with what I refer to as my three golden rules. One, laugh my ass off. Every chance I get to after I have done what I can, I walk away from those things that I cannot fix or resolve. And three, I surround myself with people, places and things I love most and support who I am as a person, Jesus Christ and somebody who's healthy. Huh? Um, all right. What are, where we go in here, where are we going?

Speaker 8:          01:37:30       Let's wrap this fucking thing up with a quick overrated, underrated. And I'm actually going to pitch it because you guys have been doing such a great job here. Um, I'm going to say overrated is the movie 300. Um, that's, it's just that it's laugh out loud. Awful. The second time you see it, the first time you see it visually it's really interesting, but it's just the stupidest fucking thing ever. It's the complete meathead, what it means to be a man. And you know, the, the, the kid, you know, it was crying for his mother and they fucking stick them in a loin cloth out in the wilderness. It's snowing out. He's walking around in his bare feet and he kills some sort of hybrid wolf slash alien with a stick. And I'm supposed to believe that. And, and you know, and then they had the fight club moment where he murders another fucking half naked, six year old with this kid who's spout Taj and they kick them down that fucking man hole.

Speaker 8:          01:38:30       And that one guy does the, the beautiful backflip as he goes it, it's fucking gay. All right. And they take on an army of 20,000. You know what I mean? You know what that movie is. That's the fantasy every man has after he pussies out and a bunch of women som pussy out in like a bar fight or something like that. And then when you're driving home and you start dreaming of the man you wish you were and how you looked and fucking, you know, mood lighting, fuck that movie movie sucks. It really sucks. Okay. I think half those apps were painted on once I saw that Janet Jackson does that, you know, that you can actually do some shadowing there on the stomach. Okay. Um, if somebody is, say some old rate on rate overrated, I losing your virginity. Uh, but God, but God SEC's rules when you figure it out later in life.

Speaker 8:          01:39:19       Also, my guitar playing to my friends is underrated. Uh, Bill Burr, the funniest men alive and chicken wings are also under underrated. The greatest food ever. Chicken wings are great when you're younger, but once your stomach is so full of grease, when you're in the middle ages, you can't eat them anymore. So enjoy underrated jerky. It's a good source of protein, low in fat and it's tasty. Great snack. Yeah. But you've got to go to a truck stop to get it. And uh, there's always the danger of being raped there, man or a woman, um, underrated, uh, being in familiar enough company to talk some serious shit and do some serious ball busting. There's nothing worse than going out with some people you kind of know, but you don't know enough to know their limits. So you can't mix it up verbally with my friends at bars watching a game, it's great knowing I don't need to censor myself, but with my girlfriend in general quite insists on couples nights, it feels like I'm eating with my grandparents.

Speaker 8:          01:40:14       It's all smallest talk, no substance. And I'm constantly censoring myself. It's a psychological prison. Exactly. I'd have to agree with you on that one. Totally would have to agree with you that, uh, less couple of things. I think that's basically it. That's the podcast for this week. I hope you enjoyed my long ass fucking stories. Happy new year to everybody. I hope you guys have a great new year and I hope you can stick with you new year's resolutions. Personally, I've been doing what I always do, getting myself in shape the first half of the year before I completely get back out of shape and nose dive with some Christmas cookies at the end of the year. That's what I do. But you know, bikini season is coming up. Um, yeah. You know, I did. I actually bought that P90x thing that they have late at night and I got to admit, dude, it's the fucking shit.

Speaker 8:          01:41:03       Once you get past the guy hosting it, you know, I don't know if I already talked about this. He's, he's kind of a, if you're doing a sketch about a personal trainer and you imitated this guy, they think that what you were doing wasn't realistic. He gives, oh yeah. P90X you know, talks about how he does a nice shoes or almost as cool as mine. Okay, let's drop down and do some crunches. Um, but after awhile you get to see that he's just, you know, he's just a big insecure guy. You know, I think I talked about this right halfway through. He admits that his dad through a couple of no hitters, you know, and you're like this, the pain. Right. And you never lived up to him athletically. Decia now you joined a gym. At the very least, you're trying to be in better shape than your old man cause she just want to hug.

Speaker 8:          01:41:45       Did that make any sense? It probably did. That's the podcast. Thank you for listening. And um, and uh, that's it. I don't know how to end it. I never know how to fucking end it. Go see me at Tampa. Go see me in Tampa at the fuck. And uh, the Improv and Tampa, cause I'll be in Tampa, in Florida at Tampa. Okay. And also be at the Improv and Houston. And I'm also coming back Boston, my triumphant return to Boston, Massachusetts. And uh, all my dates are up, my website, [inaudible] dot com and all the information, all the links, all that shit. And for those of you who are wondering what happened to my date at the Trump Taj Mahal, the Atlantic city, whatever the fuck I was going to be, um, I'm going to get a date up there. We had to reschedule it. Alright. That is it. God bless all. Yes. And uh,

Speaker 9:          01:42:37       fucking don't go to the automated lines at grocery stores. All right.

Speaker 2:          01:43:48       Ooh.
