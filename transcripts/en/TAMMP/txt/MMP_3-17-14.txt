Speaker 1:          00:00:01       Hey, what's going on? It's bill burr and it's the Monday morning podcast for Monday, March 17th, 2014 St Patrick's day fallen on a Monday. We're really going to see who the fucking real drinkers are. This. You don't want to falls in Monday. Either way, whatever. I'm still touring Canada with the wonderful Paul Versey who was once again a special guest here on the podcast. Welcome Paul. Versey. Oh, what's up man? I'm hanging in there. I'm doing well in, what do we got left? Tell me what days. Put the blinders on and didn't think about getting home. You can't and we got, what do we got? We got tonight, we got, you had to, were worth three days away from being home. We got one tonight and vent. Cool. Yeah. Then we're in a Victoria, Korea. Then we go back to Calgary. Back to those animals, animals, animals in Calgary.

Speaker 1:          00:00:51       Jesus, not the first show. The second show. Wow. I'm like, God, I'm trying to, yeah. We wanted to reach out to people in Calgary before we, we just brand everybody in Calgary animals like they were fucking pounds. You know, that first show was great. They, yeah, they were great. That second show though. Whoa. Yeah, yeah. They were like, uh, they will come in and with cases, a tall boys, they were allowed to bring those little, those little cardboard pallets hammered, hammered fucking hammer. Then they had like, uh, at, you know, I think part of it had to do with the fact that it was at a college. So I think there was college kids there that just put myself in that mindset going, dude, I drank like that when I was in college. This isn't how, I don't know they'll do it. That wasn't all college people because I asked the crowd and like, that was just, I think that was a lot of just Calgary man.

Speaker 1:          00:01:41       I think that was late at night. You know, the, I think what was permitted on the premise, it's turned them into fucking animals. Yeah. You know they, you know what, by the time I went on stage and I got halfway through my set, it was a, most of them had kind of like passed out like it got was getting quiet and I was standing up there going like, am I bombing up here? And I just kind of was looking at like five different people who will laugh their ass off. And I'm like, I'm just going to say my head this sober. Like there's no way if I'm really bomb. And I got somebody laughing that hard. So I was just like, maybe this show's gone on too long. I'm like, I'll say that was a rough one. You know, it was animals and Calgary. What was at the zoo?

Speaker 1:          00:02:21       So fun. So then, then we were driving out, you, me and [inaudible] were trying to find a place to smoke a stoby inside. Right. Or they had this, they had on that campus, which was really exciting to me was they had the speed skating loop from the 1988 Olympics and they still had ice on it. We were trying to get on that fucker. I'll do. That would've been a great youtube video if they loaned us some speeds. Gates going out there in a stand up comedy close with those giant blades on it. I just want to be going fast enough. I want to be going fast enough where I'm turned so to the side they can put those three fingers down, you know when you go around the corner. Oh my God. Yeah. No, I would never, I would have been on youtube for the wrong reasons. All starts, you

Speaker 2:          00:02:59       would have wiped out and I wanted, you know, when they wipe out, when the centrifical force just takes you into the stance.

Speaker 3:          00:03:05       Yeah, that would have been a,

Speaker 2:          00:03:07       that would have been me. So anyways, we're trying to do that. Uh, we ended up finding this great place to smoke a cigar, so we're driving out and we're trying to figure out going to do was, you know, we're talking about the show going like there wasn't me or that first show was good, but that second show. Wow. Um, did you feel the same way? And we don't basically exchanging notes. And as we drive out of the venue, uh, we see this group of fucking hammered people and this guy he's got, you know what those things like when they have a parade, go down the street, those giant like metal um, barriers or barricades. Yeah, those metal ones that have like, it looks like a fucking, I dunno, whatever giant metal barricade. This fucking guy picks it up with one hand and he's got it over his shoulder, turns around, sees us coming and then waves us through like he's some sort of official for half a second.

Speaker 2:          00:03:53       The way he did it, I thought he was. And then as I drove by, I'm looking at them and I see he's Sam, he's hammered and then I see on his face it registers that were the two comics he just saw. So, um, I just pull away from him and as I'm driving and you're going like, wow, man, that guy just had, was carrying that thing with one hand. What the fuck? I turn around and look in the rear view mirror and this guy's running after the, the co we're doing probably like about 15 miles an hour. And this dude is running, I was saying he looked like, you know when they show highlights of Babe Ruth hitting a home run when they show him running and fast legs? Yeah he was, I think he was mocking running. I don't think he was really gonna do anything cause I didn't get scared. But I want to look in the rear view mirror and I just saw this guy. Just imagine you're driving along after a fucking work and or whatever. I kind of halfway out of it and then you look in the rear view mirror and you see somebody running. But in this exaggerate rated way where he was like pumping his fucking arms like that, it was like he was mocking it.

Speaker 3:          00:04:47       I didn't see it. All I saw was you go, what the f you go, what the fuck? And you just stepped on the gas. But I was in the past

Speaker 2:          00:04:53       underpowered fucking rental car

Speaker 3:          00:04:56       and all of a sudden you go, what the fuck? And I go, what? And he just stepped in, I guess you go that got you started running after the car. And I was like, Holy Shit. Because I saw one of his friends, right. One of the just collapsed, like they were so hammered that he didn't hit any, he just felt like I just fell and I just saw his legs go up. But they were fucked up through those kids. I would

Speaker 2:          00:05:15       be lying if like, like three times yesterday and this morning I woke up and I was picturing that guy running behind the car and I laugh every time. It was fucking nuts. Yeah. Those guys were hammering man. Yeah. So we got tip tip of the cap to a, the drinking ability. Yeah. Not Encouraging that from where we come back Wednesday. We definitely like to have people try to behave more like the first show where, uh, you know, I don't feel like I'm interrupting your drinking with my most of my jokes. Yeah. That, yeah. That was deaf stuff. They were great doll. The crowds are great. Yeah. Yeah, they were great. But yeah, man, that was still was another level. Yeah, there was, there's always a couple, there's always a couple of hammered people, but that was where it was getting to the tipping point. Like kind of like, you know, right before Hitler took power where it's just like, what

Speaker 1:          00:05:57       side am I going to choose here for? My own survival is, that's what the drunk versus sober level was. By the time I got about 40 minutes into my set, it was kind of like you're doing, you're doing an hour plus I'm going out there, up front, you know, I could kind of see that their animals, but you know, he just, you going out to, by the time you're halfway through your set, these guys are like six tall boys in. It's a shit show. It's a fucking shit show is shit show Edmonton Edmonton was unbelievable. Edmonton at that venue. You remember that one with the orchestra fucking place there. Oh yeah. That was great. So then when we have a great time there and then the uh, we ended up, uh, what the fuck did we go? I remember we kept leaving the hotel. We kept joint drove around or, but you had, you had to get socks first.

Speaker 1:          00:06:44       He's fucking hilarious birds. He has not done laundry. I bought new shit, you know dude, we're like 20 what? Seventies we were 16 days in. Yeah. You've got 16 days worth the fucking socks and drawers. Yeah, I got them in a plastic bag and, and I went to the store and I bought new ones. You know what would have cost me the same fucking thing. We got to take a picture of your bag at some point. Post it up big as it gets. Yeah. Oh, he has them on the outside pouch. What? You're checking the bag. So I guess it doesn't matter, but uh, I just did mine for the second time. I that I fucking hate having a dirty laundry. You go back past a certain amount of days, like I'm doing three, four days in a row. Plastic bags stuffed them in the front or whatever, but mainly do mine at home.

Speaker 1:          00:07:27       Is it, do you do what it does your wife do it and my wife does it. Yeah. Yeah, me too. Hey, I got an in line, you know, so anyways, last week, uh Oh wait, I gotta finish the Edmond Think Edmonton thing. So first he is completely addicted to skating now and he wants to get better at it. And um, so we're fucking then uh, Edmonton, the next morning we got to drive down to Calgary in force. He's going like this gotta be a place here to skate. So we find out they have, uh, they have a skating rink at the mall and I only use it a mall. It's one of the most giant malls in North America. America. Yeah. West Edmonton Mall rivaling. Uh, what's that one in Minnesota. Mall of America. All of America. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. So, which I've been to that one too. So we go to that one.

Speaker 1:          00:08:11       We're walking through there with a fucking skates to middle aged guys walking through this thing with fucking skates and a, we walk in, there's like this giant pirate ship. I mean like, yeah, you could say all the fucking ocean with this fucking thing. Yeah. It was a flicker of official and I look on the other side. It was really deep water and they took all this time to make it look like there was a ship wreck. Jesus Christ. I mean like you could fucking, yeah, it was monstrous man. Like Shaq could drown in this water if he didn't. That's how fucking deep it was. Huge. And then we look on the other side and I'm like, Paul, I'm like, is that a fucking sea lion? They had sea lions at this thing and they're like thrown at fishing. Fishing. It was catching trainer was don't, it wasn't like people just walking by throwing shit from the food court.

Speaker 1:          00:08:53       It was a trainer throwing it. And um, so we're just walking through the mall, walking through the mall. Endless fuck him all. They had a water park there. Yeah, it was, I didn't look at any stores. I was too distracted by the shit in the middle. And then we finally get all the way to the ice palace that called the Ice Palace and we got all excited and we're the only people with skates just walking through, holding a fucking dump skates and we get all the way to the other side versus all excited. Like, dude, I'm telling you, I'm gonna get better at this. You wait, I was getting, I was ready this summer. He was already talking shit, they were calling it right now. I'm going to be fucking skating backwards. You're going to be like, what the fuck happened? Versie yeah, right. And then we show up and uh, there's a big judo tournament where the ice rink is and they'd fucking put all this floor flooring all over it.

Speaker 1:          00:09:35       How is it denial? I'm like, maybe this isn't the rank. Maybe this analysis dude, it says ice palace fall. This is it. They covered it up. This is it. I've got upset though at the moment. Remember number, that girl, man, that really bothered me. We were walking through the food court and you know, we had a gyro. Great Gyro and just, yeah, yeah, a great shower. Or just please call Jimmy the Greek dawn complaint. And you agreed a little too much white sauce and it was pasty. Yeah. Wasn't it wasn't, yeah, it was a little PC. One scoop. He went to one school blessing a little hot sauce and it would have been far sighted. He got excited. It would have been epic. Yeah, we, you got excited. So then I said to bill, you know, I like a little dessert after I eat, you know, I like a little candy bar. I like a little, you know, so I love sugar. New Tech.

Speaker 4:          00:10:18       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:10:18       So, so I go bill man, it was a frozen yogurt place. I go, yeah, pink berry or someone said God's going frozen yogurt. See, all right, so we're walking like paint the picture. So to middle aged men was skates and I was like, okay. You keep saying I'm Middle Age, you are middle age. I'm 30 I just turned 35 35 times two is 70 most guys fucking drop. Well I called, I called like I called middle it. Yeah. All right. What, what would you call it? No, I guess, I guess you're right. I guess, you know, I always just, when I thought of it as a kid, I always felt, you know, it was Nah, I don't know. I just remember, dude, I, it's, I don't know, we'll just say 40 forties but I, you're not bored for 40 people. Do people live long, man, dude, I'm fucking be 46 46 times two is 92 you're going to really, I can't really sit there and say, I'm middle age. Tell you the way I'm eating and smoking, you know?

Speaker 1:          00:11:10       No. So, so we walked through and we're, we're like, where's that, where was that a frozen yogurt place? Let's go to that frozen yogurt place. So we too, we see two young women walk by and we figure, Hey, I looked at him and I'm like, these, these, these ladies, they're going to know where they're going to know where a pink berry is. So we walk up and you go first. You say to the friend, you go, hey, you got, you guys know her. Oh, that good. They're good looking too by the way. You yeah. Good, good looking girls. And you go up first, you go, hey you guys know where the frozen yogurt places and like she did like a double take. Like she did a double take, so fucking rude. Right. And she just was like, what? And then I looked at the other one and I go, yeah, like a pink berry. And she kinda just like gives a shake off. Like how would I know? Like why are you and she fucking did. This is what she did. She did the classic pretty girl, you're clearly just asking me this

Speaker 3:          00:11:54       because you want to talk to me thing. And I'm like, no bitch, I want some fucking yogurt. Okay, I want fucking, I want to fucking treat. You know, I just had lunch and it really bothered me dude. And we were walking around and I wanted to find her. I wanted to find this again. They did the loop on the phone. I didn't know that, but I said to bill and we got to the car. I go, I wanted to find it cause I would have just went up to and go, you know something. I found it and you're a mean jerk, and then you go, why would you do that?

Speaker 1:          00:12:17       Jerk. That's terrible. What am I going to call her a cunt? Well, don't call her anything if you're going to go with me and jerk. I mean, you know, I hate that you're a girl mentality. That pretty good day. You're mean or you're a jerk if you want to stay clean. But if you go, you're a mean jerk. No, you're not. You're not. You're not pretty inside in a pretty inside. It doesn't give a fuck. She's the hot girl at the mall. Pall. Put yourself in her fucking pumps with two fucking jackass is standing there with ice skates when there's a judo tournament down the way, asking if they know where the ice cream store is. They looked at us the way they were supposed to. I, you know what, dude? I like a sweetheart. I don't care how you, I would love to hear them tell the story and then they come and then there's just creepy guy comes up.

Speaker 3:          00:13:03       Oh good.

Speaker 1:          00:13:06       Where they're going to hear it, Paul. Paul, you ever watch those fucking prison shows? Which ones? Like the scared straight? No, not those ones. Where they, they talk about the worst prisons in the country and that type of ship. Oh yeah. I seen a couple of minutes. And you just sit there watching it going. How the fuck would I go in there and not get raped? What would my game plan? He gets scared watching it in your bedroom, right? Women have to walk out of the house worried about that. That somebody is going to, you know, do just imagine if if, uh,

Speaker 3:          00:13:33       winter hat on with a puffy ball on top of it, holding ice skates, asking for yogurt. If anything, she probably thought I was fucking gay.

Speaker 1:          00:13:42       You don't look gay, Paul. I know, but you're not this. You're not your beards to terrorists who need to get a little more metro sexual and not to do that. We were sweared sweatpants on. Do we want a mess?

Speaker 3:          00:13:54       Everybody in the fucking girl. Yeah, that's what you look my beard. My beard actually fucking says everybody on the fucking ground. No, but dude, I don't like the pretty girl who can't be approached with a question because Oh, this guy's hitting on me. It's, it's awful. And you know something that got, especially the blonde one who went like shook her head like what? She's going to be a nightmare. She's a fucking nightmare for some future guy. I'm telling you. She's a nightmare. She's already selfish. It's over.

Speaker 1:          00:14:21       What if she just knows what she wants and we're not at, Oh this is the thing dude. You actually aloud like how old do you think they were? Probably 2122 yeah. You learn at 2122 year old. I met a girl at my age, not even a one way. She shook it all that and you let her ruin like to do, we're driving down to Calgary. She wrote, I got the rocky mountains on the right hand side of the car and you're just still calling. You're calling her a cunt the whole way down and bothered the shit out of me. It was like, why are you, why would you ask me? How would I know? Dude? You realize how funny that is that they did that to us? Like what? Like yeah, they really made us feel like shit. That's fucking hilarious. If you look at it, it bothered me the whole time is cause you wanted to get frozen yogurt that how funny would it be if we chased him down and frozen yogurt with sugar free gummy bears on it.

Speaker 1:          00:15:14       It was still all natural, no organic gummy because how great would it be if we chased him down and I just walked up to her and I go, you know something, you hurt my feelings. I just fucking broke down. You hurt my feelings. I just want a yogurt. Oh by the way, people listen. Listening here. This is last week. You know, you know, just trying to kill, just trying to make jokes to not go out of your mind. Being on tour this fucking long is we were doing the danger field. Everything. I'll tell you, I've got a friend of mine loves yogurt, you know, so we were doing that and once that went away, that got old somewhere along the line you started doing it, you started saying really sentimental shit to me and then pretending like you were crying and then that just became like the running joke and then you started laughing and then you were just like, you got to do that on stage, do that crime and things. So now we'll just go up and like if we'll be like, hey man, I'm tired, but dude, you know what? Hang on, hang on. What you on the road has been great. You're the only one I could have done it with. And then bill would come and tag it. That's the best thing. Bill would come and tag and I would just be like, oh, I was hoping you were going to say that.

Speaker 1:          00:16:21       It's been, it's been fucking wonderful for my anger. I'm going to try to do that when I got home and like 10 like I'm crying man. It's fucking hilarious. So two stories. We go in to eat and we have this Filipino waiter, right? By the way, I like to play the Games where I sort of hell, where are we? Was that Edmonton? Was that Calgary? I was having to, yeah, it was Edmonson so I like to do this thing where sometimes I like to fuck with people so I'll just get on a phone and I'll be like, Bill, go along with it and we'll be in an elevator and I'll go, what? No, that's horse shit. And like bill, just look what happens. So like I said, like he had a parole officer called and he said, and bill goes all they worked it up and then instantly Burgos.

Speaker 1:          00:16:55       Yeah. What about that video tape? I go, Nah, Nah, they said it's insubmissible and like, and like the guy, there's just a stranger. They're right. Sometimes I break out laughing. So bill calls it, he gets a little emotional guy. So we turn this crying thing, we do it to like, this has been great, right? We turn, we turned that into doing it in public. So we have this Filipino waiter, right. And the whole guy guy was great and he was talking to us and at the end I just go, he goes, here's your bill. And I go, I just want to say stop. And I kept the dead straight face and you've been a great waiter. And I put my hand on his fucking arm and got, you know, you're bringing the waters and bill just looks at and goes. He gets a little, he gets a little emotional, you know what I mean?

Speaker 1:          00:17:35       I know, but it's big. It means a lot guy didn't know what to do. I had no cause he was so fucking polite. And he was actually from the Philippines. So he's jumped right in. Perfectly good for. And he gets a little emotional like no, but Billy, he'd been the waters and I'll do it. Well he was freaked out. Dot. Yeah, that's the new game on the road. You have the best one. I got to say, the best one was at the airport yesterday. We got to the airport yesterday and bill starts busting my balls about my laundry and he goes, Versie fucking 16 days. And you're caring. And you know, dirty socks and underwear. And I go, dude, I go, I bought new ones. You know the dirty ones are tied up tight in a, in a plastic bag and bill just goes, just secure emotions.

Speaker 1:          00:18:13       And Dude, I fucking could not walk. I couldn't walk and I had to stop pulling my fucking the bag I'd checked cause we were laughing so hard. And it does, it works though. It makes it, it makes, it's fucking great. It's driving a tour manager nuts. Oh yeah. That's the one thing we yeah, well because women don't want to see a guy getting emotional like that. It's just, well no, cause once somebody cries it's over. Yeah. Like when I go out afterwards and I'm taking pictures with people and stuff, I always come back. I was just saying, I got to tell you, you know, I've seen a lot of people do that, you know, doing the picture thing, but you gotta be one of the best wives. She's going, would you stop fucking doing that? Our wives are going to go nuts. Cause you know the first thing I, when I see stays and you see your wife, we're just going to go.

Speaker 1:          00:18:56       It's been so long. I miss you so much. No, you gotta, you gotta set it up with talking like you got to start off normal white day. You're going to say something really sentimental to them so they're almost crying and then you cry, which ruins their crying and I swear to God, you get slugged in the shoulder, which is all you really want. Um, I'm the minutes in here. I think it's time to do a little advertising here, you know? Okay. What have we got then? I just shut it off. No, I didn't. Oh Shit. 20 minutes in. I'll tell you Paul, you know, time really flies with you on the podcast. It's been so fun.

Speaker 1:          00:19:26       This is probably only funny to us, but I don't give a shit. Try it with your friends stuff. Fuck that. If people are with the game is called, he gets emotional and just walk into a bar. Just have one of your friends started hitting on a woman and then the other friends got to go along. Yep, and then just starts welling up and then the other guy goes on. Sorry. He just gets emotional and you just got to let the other person deal with it. Dude, you don't want it. The fucking airport where you walked up to that lady at the con though, the little fucking I sell gum, whatever the hell it is. He said, excuse me, do you have the one of the biggest night I broke out of, I go, hey ma'am, I need to, what are the biggest condoms you got there?

Speaker 1:          00:19:59       What's the biggest size condoms you have? I turned around and walked away and you turned around and walked away and I'm just staring at her and I'm biting my tongue as hard as I can to not laugh and then I just burst out laughing. She said what? And then when you went to repeat it, you try to point to it and I lost it. You lost it and had to walk away. Paul, we're punchdrunk out here. All right.

Speaker 1:          00:24:31       If you're in your hotel and all of a sudden they say there's a gas leak and you can fucking smell it. You have to run down the stairs. Then what he's supposed to do to, how about the left half? You Shit in the room and you walk up the street and there's a guy with bagpipes playing that green analog 80 no, no neck goose.

Cause she, she intro to it and it was good. I just said a version of it, but it was more saying, they were actually very text saying this is like Scottish, uh, beatboxing and I just looked at Paul and I go poff, she's about ready do Scottish beatboxing from the old country. And I go, this is either going to be amazing or I'm going to have to sit here staring at my beer. Uh, Vancouver's awesome. Praying for it to be over. Well, let's go to the guests leak. So we're sitting here in the hotel. Oh yeah. And um, you know, I know verse, he is not a morning person.

Speaker 1:          00:25:46       I have not called you one. I haven't woken you up other than before going to the airport just to make sure your comments. So if we have a day off, I don't fuck with you. I let you wake up. Yeah, it's, it's a great, it's great. I don't poke the bear, so I know that we're going to do the podcast. We were gonna try to do it around 12 noon here and uh, cause I'm trying to sleep off this little cold that I've, I've caught. But um, all of a sudden you, you call me, I'm like, oh great. Versus these up. And then you're like, damn dude, Hailey's, hey, what's going on? There's a gas leak in the building. They told us to get out of here. And I'm just sitting there like, no, I was walking out to go get lunch and all of a sudden I see a construction worker come in full thing. He just runs in. He goes, hey, yeah, we're running. We got running. Like it scared me as I'm walking out, he just goes, hey, we got a guest and I just smell and there's a hundred construction workers outside and just warning people to run down the street. It was like a fucking seat. Some gone, oh shit. Bills up there. So let me call it bill because it's a friend like shit that you thought about me.

Speaker 4:          00:26:44       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:26:45       So I called bill and I go, dude, you got to go. There's a gas leak and it smells. You got it. They're going to probably evacuate you go you, you cut me off. You heard gas leak and they're probably going evacuate what? You go do it. I'm on my way down. And then you just got the fuck you got the fuck out. And I don't mind getting blown up. I'm worried about burning to death. So I had to get the fuck out of this. So I'm grabbing everything and I'm sitting there going, I've got to get out of, you've got to get out of here. And I grab my watch and I'm like, that's going to be the move right there. That fucking kills me. So I go outside, you know, try to find the exit and I've run it down and thing. And when I got to the the right to right where I go, I'm on the fifth floor.

Speaker 1:          00:27:15       Okay. These, this construction guys were working on some sort of line in the street and somebody fluffed up and hit something. Yeah. So I got right to the fire escape doors doing and it smelled like when you go to light a grill and you think you have, uh, some juice left in your automatic lighter and there isn't and you just take that extra three seconds to find some matches and then you light it and goes, you don't get, Whoa, what the fuck? That's what it smelled like. A little more intense. And I'm thinking, I'm on the fifth floor. This fucking place. Yeah. So I ran down those stairs, um, and went out the side and then I got off the side of the building thinking, okay, I'm safe. And I still smelled it almost worse. And I was standing right outside the hotel. Yeah. Trying to find you and I could still smell it. I'm like, if this whole fucking thing's going up, I'm going to get knocked on my ass here. Cause it at the least because I can still smell the shit. I've got a hat on with the pump pod, Paul, I'm going to go up like a fucking bowling alley. So then they finally said, they told all of us to get the hell out of the way and we backed up. We went down the street, we got some breakfast and it thought it was really nice. A little bit.

Speaker 4:          00:28:18       It's never not funny.

Speaker 1:          00:28:19       The Nice. Anyways, the Nice thing is you got, you got the out here. You wouldn't have blown, you were a bird right with the balcony because they're going to bow. Well, I have a balcony on the fifth floor and then there's like a patio right on the other side of it. I don't know, Paul, when you're on fire, you don't want to be, I don't mind blowing up. I just don't want to burn the debt. It's fucking awful. Yeah. If there's an explosion, I want to die. I don't want to be coming out, you know, running down the street like that naked girl in the Vietnam picture. That girl like get cause you got burned by fucking agent orange. That's what she's, she's running down the street cause skin is hanging off a fucking backside. Horrible. It's fucking horrible. Paul, you have a [inaudible] greatest Vancouver. Yeah. Now we got the image of a naked girl running down the street on fire. Uh, yes. That's all. But that's what I was thinking of. Sorry. That image touched me when I saw it.

Speaker 4:          00:29:07       Nobody should die like that. I swear

Speaker 1:          00:29:13       to God. I hope they find them is funny. And this is going to be most annoying podcast ever. Whatever. Fuck you. You go to Canada for 20 days dancing like a monkey. You, you'd got to come up with some shit too. We get emotional. Um, Vancouver. Yeah, Vancouver's great. Love it. I love the Edmonton Calgary. Unfortunately I didn't get a chance like that, that street right outside a hotel man and all these bars and all these great places to eat. Really, really fucking fun towns. Yeah. And, um, when I was in Winnipeg, who wouldn't? That was her off, you know? No, let me tell you, those people are tough. Okay. Well I saw a to the other day, I don't have to finish it, but no did. Winnepeg was like, you know me, I don't like to fly when I have to win a peg. I was like, let's go to the airport.

Speaker 1:          00:29:50       Like, and the people were great and the food was great. There's no way you like that part of the world to live there in the wintertime. It's, you have to be a special kind of tough or you're, you're out the second you turn 18, like fuck you parents, you're out. Yeah, no, the people were great. The food was great. We had Greg, who was outstanding was that that Tortilla I have, which is a French Canadian. A meat pie. Yeah. Flaky crust. And they had the crust underneath. They didn't, they didn't skimp on that. Sometimes your older at shepherd pie or a meat pie and they just, you know, they fucking cook up the meat, stick it in a bold and they put just a doe on the top. Yeah. And I want this thing, you know, oh, well I want both parents to be there.

Speaker 1:          00:30:28       Right. The one on top and on the bottom right. Just necessarily net. You gave me a piece of it. It was unreal. And then I did, I had chicken salad and make it cry, you know, it was great. We had great food over there. Did you get emotional Paul? If tasted a lot of things, but that was, no I, yeah, when my, I love the room last night. I love that. Like it's a kind of like a beacon theater right up front. That's what I love. Edmonton was like law Edmondton room almost as a Carnegie was just deep and layers. I was on that night, dude. I went out there and the fucking add was working to my, sometimes it fucks me up. It was working great. Oh Edmonton fucking just shuffle the deck of all my jokes and then that made me say all this shit and I was just like one of those things where I felt like I was on stage for five minutes on that one.

Speaker 1:          00:31:11       Now Dude, you from Edmonton was that was fucking Edmunton. Actually I had a show stopper where like literally in Vaudeville I had a fuck this guy's a show stop now I had a surreal triple threat. No, I had a bad show stopper. I'm, I'm saying that in a bad way. You Fuck it? Oh, that was my fault. I shouldn't know. I showed that. I did that joke where I was just like, you know women, you know, you guys like it, personal trainers and you, you know, you go all out for your wedding picture and your wedding day and you look great, you'll take an Olympian and then I go and then it just kind of falls apart. But like, and the place just fucking stop test someone in the crowd went, wow, somebody knows somebody goes, oh my God. And like I had the bid I did before it killed.

Speaker 1:          00:31:54       And then I did that and I go, no, and I kind of saved it when I go know what I'm saying is like, you should just come down the aisle the way you're going to be like what I'm going to be looking at for the next 40 or 50 years. And like half of them laughed, but I was just like somebody who was like, well then I told you afterwards and the look on your face, you would just like, wow, yeah, fuck up. And I was the idiot when you sent it to me in the restaurant. It was fun. It was funny to me. So I said, dude, you got to do that on stage. And then somehow the way you said that you said it, I was just like, I mean that's fucking let me that they'll look dude. I mean he can't, women have to, they have to give birth.

Speaker 1:          00:32:27       Can you imagine what the fuck you do? You stay in shape, you do all that and then you can begin to have another kid. You basically going to have to go through that and what that the angel, what I'm saying, how could, you know what I'm saying is, and this is what I'm, you know, I know women do and, and you know, my wife looks great, she had two kids and everything and I know women go through a lot of shit and have kids. I'm saying don't put on that show for everybody else. Be who the fuck you're going to be. It's the same way people, you know, clean up for company like what? The regular families not good, you know, and just being nice and Betty who we don't see ever who's coming over once a fucking year is what you've got to get onto your hands and knees would have to pick or two, I'll go with this.

Speaker 1:          00:33:05       It does suck. When it's somebody that you don't give a shit about and your wife's saying, we got to clean this fucking place up and they're going on. It isn't just like, okay, let me, let's just pick a room that we throw all the shit and, and close the door. Like you, they actually want you to clean up that they're coming in from Maryland. I don't give a fuck. I'm not going to see him again. Right. You know? Right. But as far as I'm looking good on the Wednesday, I want to, I want him to look as good as they can. I would like to know I was trying to do with a joke and it fucking backfired. I wasn't there for you as a friend, you know, and I'll tell you, that's going to haunt me forever.

Speaker 1:          00:33:39       Um, yeah. But, oh, what, what, what about, what was the name of that theater that we played in Winnipeg? Man? Uh, Burton Cummings. Yeah. That it was, it was, it was a, I got a little, some of the history that that place was made in, uh, 1908. And they had these, these fucking stairs in the back. Now, everybody's Charlie Chaplin. Uh, uh, who's the guy that, uh, fatty Arbuckle, Harry Houdini, all these, it was a Vaudeville theater for like the first 30 years before the talkies took. Oh, I say, and um, they still had like the original stairs in the back. You walked up to the green room and these are like slabs. I don't know what kind of stone it is, but from years of people walking up and it where you basically, you put your feet, there was like these indentations from people's scuffing up as they walking up or coming down.

Speaker 1:          00:34:27       Yeah. And then outside, uh, the upper deck of it, the, I guess the mezzanine and the upper deck, they used to have pews all the way through them. And then they put seats in at some point. But in the upper deck they still had these wooden pews and during my set, because the acoustics are incredible. Can you talk in 1908? I mean, I don't think they could really amplify voice at that point. Could they? I don't know. Yeah. We don't know. We're idiots, but I don't think they could. So it's a, it's was acoustically perfect building. So when people were way up in that upper deck, we're talking like an old hockey barn for hockey fans. There are basketball fans where you felt like if you lean too far forward, you'd fall right on the emblem at center ice or center court and these people would walk down and it's making that, that sound like you almost like an old chair makes all that rickety shit.

Speaker 1:          00:35:11       And it sounded like it was right above me and I was sitting there going, are these fucking union guys walking around and making noise door my show? And I kept making jokes like that. They, that they were already changing the marquee and they were over me. And what it was was people in that upper deck, we're walking down just to go to the bathroom and get a drink. But the acoustics were so unbelievable and it was so fucking steep. It sound, it sounded like it was right above my head. It was amazing. That was one of my, a place was old school and then I old shit dude. So I actually walked up there at the end of my show. I wish it did it dude. It was, it reminded me a, there's one in Seattle that we did the, the Moore theater where a, I think they shut the uh, the video for even flow found bucket check at DePaul. That one right when he's fucking hanging and he's looking like he's bleary eyed. You know, like he's crazy but he hasn't, he knows exactly what he's doing. He already knows he wants to fire his drummer.

Speaker 1:          00:36:11       We played that one and that one was really interesting where just like this one that we played in Winnipeg, they have separate entrances for the upper deck and that, I don't know if they had segregation up here, but in Seattle that that was what that was for that upper deck. You had it completely separate entrance, no fucking elevator. And you just walked up flight after flight after flight. And these were serious flights, like 40 14 groupings, you know, two groups of like 14 to get to one floor all the way, all the way, all the way up. And I was joking with the guy going, this is why African Americans kicked the shit out of white people because in sports, cause we just rolled into the theater. Hey, he has to just have a seat. You've got to do like the fucking stair master all the way up and come back down just to see a fucking show.

Speaker 1:          00:36:52       And that's like insanely high man. Like that was scary. High. Yeah. Steep. It's like you don't want to lead forward like steep. Like you'll fucking, it was scary. Yeah. Like I would not want to be like hammered, oh, not the up there. And then, you know, smoke a little joint or something. Some of our smoke a cigar that made me fucking lightheaded. I would just be like, I mean if I had to leave I would, I would go hands and knees backwards down like a little, you know, a little toddler that goes downstairs. That's how I would exit with the, uh, with the fear. He liked the Burton Cummings when I like, I think, um, I think the vogue last night was one of my favorites. Man. I'll do those are two great crowds to, yeah, and we're not shitting on Calgary by the way. It was just that second show dude.

Speaker 1:          00:37:32       It's been a while since I've been in front of people that drunk. But uh, we had another amazing week. Now when do we play hockey? I'll wait. We went to the Bruins. Canadians game. Yeah. And what does the name of that place? Molson Center. Yeah, they changed it. They changed it whenever the fuck it is now. You know, I don't know. Some sort of cellular company, but uh, it's just an amazing place to go to. We see all those retired numbers, all those Bay Stanley Cup banners and just how into it people are. And there was some people leaving early down below that kind of disappointed me. But it was a beat down. It was a beat down Bruins fucking killed three goals in the third period. Hey. And I wasn't obnoxious either. I didn't like the guy who brought me into it. He was a Canadiens Fan.

Speaker 1:          00:38:13       He said, hey, we're going to go into this, this, you know, the famous, I don't know, one of the levels in the mezzanine level, they have this pub. And the guy who hooked us up with tickets said, listen, I know he's a big Bruins fan, but I respect, could you just not wear stuff? It gets weird when you going now. So it's like, yeah, absolutely. I'm, I gonna fucking do that. I'm going to stand up and share when we score, but I'm not going to be that asshole. Go, yeah, we're face, you know, giving them shit or whatever. I'm not going to do that. No, no. Yeah, yeah. So I just sat there and like, they're really fucking enjoyed it. And, uh, but earlier that day, we actually, uh, some of the guys from just for laughs, Bruce Hill hooked us up with some ice time and I got the shit kicked out of me.

Speaker 1:          00:38:51       And for as he played hockey for the first time we played at this, this, you know, they've got a zillion rinks out there and it was a old Canadian, uh, Stefan can tell, uh, we played, you know, back when I was first going to games and shit like that, or maybe we're five years into when I started going to games and he somehow, I forget how it was, but his Jersey was framed there. So anyways, we played on this little sort of mini rink. We had the floating Blue Line. You bring it to the zone and the red line becomes the Blue Line. And I've got to tell you, Versie fucking animal, he's out there with just gloves, a stick and a helmet. Dude, you had like three shots on net online. I mean, I don't know if you try it like trying to tap rebounds in his shots on net.

Speaker 1:          00:39:29       I don't know how that fucking works, but dude, you had like three on one shift and I was sitting there laughing on the bench go, this fucking guy's got more shots on net in one shift. Well, one of the guys like, dude, I said like we were talking like maybe throughout the whole game I'm going to have like 12 shots, but I didn't know how to stop. I got the shit kicked out of me. I'm falling down and everyone's got pads but me. So I'm the most novice in this thing. All right. And the only thing I had was gloves and a helmet. I'm falling on my knees and elbow getting and like it was so legit that there were two locker rooms. You had your own jerseys. There was a timer. These guys had shifts and I'm getting thrown into this thing. Okay. I haven't been on the ice.

Speaker 1:          00:40:06       You know why? I've been dragging all my stuff up here because it's, we're going to play, I want to make sure I'm protected and I'm not going to wear somebody else's smelly stuff. That's fucking, that's gross dude. That's like the pad version of using your buddy's toothbrush. It's gross but yeah and and and typical me, I'm like, I don't know how to play but I just know scoring position from floor hockey. So I just would go down, get into scoring position, not know how to stop and just fucking get the shit kicked out. I would, I'll tell you this one thing a coach would never have to tell you is go to the net. That's all you did. The second grade team. The second your team got the puck. I just went to do and understand offsides though are offsides a couple of times. What the fuck dude, you would just put your head down and just mirror.

Speaker 1:          00:40:50       I just started skating and you had you stick on the ice the wrong way because every time I shot I wouldn't need a lefty stick. So I had the righty stick, which that an opposite and I kept doing backhands with the wrong stick. But I did have a post on that one. Your backhand was lethal cause you had a right handed stick. Everybody thought you were right hand and he's going down and go and look at this fucking guy. He's got like all these shots and neck and he's playing left handed with a right hand to stick was all right. Yeah. Yeah. No, no, you're good man. You're, you're, you're good at it. I, I was, oh thank you. I was hoping you were gonna say something. No cause a little self conscious. I definitely recognized it.

Speaker 1:          00:41:26       I skate all right until I get the puck. I just, I swear to God dude, it's just, it all falls apart and you know, it's the funniest thing when I play with guys, it's two passes to me before my, before my whole team figures it out and then it's just like, you know, I then I have to be like literally going across the Blue Line screaming something to get the fucking puck back. But they know now. But you did you, but you had some good passes shot on goal. There was like, I liked playing days was a 13 year old kid there. There was a 14 year old kid there and these, and I just was like, but I almost hurt myself. Remember I just slammed my head, dude. Yeah, that was bad. I was like, no, I knew you were going to be. So everyone was saying, hey, go take some Advil.

Speaker 1:          00:42:03       And you're like, no, I don't do, I feel fine. I feel fine. And when you fall like the way you were falling, those are those deep fucking bruises and they don't show up for at least 24 hours. The best thing Bruce did, he goes, dude, you don't want to concussion. And he brings me a helmet and I slipped back to it. If you, if the way you fell on my head, dude, that would, I would have been over. Oh yeah. That would have had that awful fucking sound of a head hitting the back of the head, hitting the ice. Oh my God. I felt so bad one time somebody skating by. I thought it was you. Somebody just goes, you got air on that one. Like I was getting the shit kicked out of me. But this is the thing though. You were doing it to yourself that just let people know. It's not like people were knocking them down. This was a non contact game. Paul would just go head a fucking stage like you were gonna run. It never leaves something. I never, the best compliment I got was when I saw somebody goes, I go, I never put an ice hockey before. And he was like, well you've got good balance. And I was like, have you been watching? Yeah, I know, right? Hey, let me, let me

So check it out.

Speaker 1:          00:47:30       All right, first question of the week, and Paul, I know you're going to love this one because you've been absolutely obsessed with this. Uh, this says the, the name of the question is where's the plane? Oh yeah, let's go. Uh, he says, Bill, using whatever knowledge you have of the situation, whether it be a lot or a little, please break down what happened on that plane. Um, this is right up my alley. First of all, it's right up your id knowing you and you and you hate flying. I tell you, we know it's annoying as I have to blow my nose because I'm coming down with a cold. So why don't you start as I walk over here to blow my nose off my, because I'm a professional. What do you think Paul? You're the guest. I'll let you go first here. Would you like a glass?

Speaker 1:          00:48:09       Go ahead. What do you think? Uh, I think that, I think obviously the plane was hijacked. I think that's why the, um, the, you know, it's hard to know. Uh, yeah, a little bit. I think the plane was hijacked. Um, of course. I think that's why there was, the communication was cut out and then they have proof that it kind of diverted and, and changed its course. And then nobody heard anything. I think the fact that the fucking thing is not in the water. There's 230 people on a seven 77. I flew that, I've flown in seven 77, two uh, Italy. Oh yeah, dude, that's your nickname. Tell us seven 77 you, yeah, I mean, so when I fly it now, um, and, and, and there was, I won't go unless it's a seven. It's not a center. Yeah, that's not it. It's glass glass the whole way.

Speaker 1:          00:48:58       The lucky number, you know, seven 30, 70, you know, so, uh, so there was no debris, nothing. So I don't think that, I think that the plane, they said that the plane could have flown for six hours after they lost contact. That fucking thing could be anywhere. Right now there's going to be a movie about this. I think, I hope that in off everybody, you know, God, God forbid, but I think the plane landed somewhere and was hidden. And then I think the people that did it, I think, I don't know what, I don't know what they did with the people, but, uh, you know, I don't think it's in the ocean, so, all right, let's, you know, come on. You've got to put some money on. Well, listen what country you pick and casket Stan, they said it could have gone as far as Kazic sedan to Zika.

Speaker 1:          00:49:36       Stan, all of those standards, uh, Liam for, okay, let's say we're at Catholic Stan. I think, uh, yeah, dude, I think that it landed somewhere and it's fucking, it's just an awful situation. But, um, I, this is what I, it's the aliens built, you think? See, I don't know. I think, uh, with each day that passes that there's no sort of demand or anything like that. I'm thinking more unfortunately, I don't know sadistically or whatever they fluid way off course and I don't know. I mean how, unless you dump a plane in like the shipping lanes, what does, what is the odds? The plains has a beacon. Planes have a beacon, but it was turned off. I mean, I dunno, there's something that, that where they can track. It was fucking turned off and the people knew how to do it. So I think with every passing day, yeah, like it's not a good, like there, there's no demands.

Speaker 1:          00:50:33       It's just really weird that, that if, you know, there's always some crazy reason to draw attention to something that someone does something like this. The fact, the only hope that I have is the fact that they haven't asked for any demands yet is, is I, I dunno, I mean, what you wanted the plain, I mean, what the fuck? You know, how fucked up was your country? You can't get a seven 77 crest. They're laying all over the place. But what's the motive or the, what's the motive of the hijackers? Uh, I don't know, but I, I really felt for the family members because they're sitting there and they're talking about the airline, how the airline is handling this, like a, a business rather than, you know, what is going on. And they go, we can't comment on anything right now because basically, you know, it's a cooperation.

Speaker 1:          00:51:19       They're like, we're going to get the shit suit out of us. Let's, let's try to limit how much we're going to get the shit suit. Like they go into that fucking mode. Yeah. But it's one of those awful things where, you know, um, also, you know, the victims are going to go into it. We're going to sue the shit out of your mode. So it's just like, if people could just in this moment, if the airline could be allowed to just say, we're fucking devastated. I mean, we had employees on that plane too, you know, and they could, everybody could just share information and there wouldn't be that stupid, you know, lawyers licking their chops on both sides or one cowering. And the other guy, other side of licking their chops, maybe they could at least make it a little more comforting for those people.

Speaker 1:          00:52:02       But, uh, it's in, and, you know, I guess there's no comedy here, Dude. It's just, it's fine. I just feel, I just feel bad for, you know, there's kids in there and shit, man, it's fucked up man. It's awful. And it's one of the most unprecedented, uh, mysteries like a seven 77 with fucking 230 peoples disappeared and nobody knows where it is in the airlines don't have answers. And 10 countries had their navies fucking just scowl at the fucking ocean and nobody can find it. Right? It's crazy, man. Well, I mean, there's a kind of good thing there that maybe with the, they're still alive and there's something you can do to negotiate. But the thing about, uh, trying to land a plane like that, it's not like you could just go to some boot bootleg fucking air strip. I mean, you need a lead, a lot of fucking runway to land something that big.

Speaker 1:          00:52:48       It's not like he could go to fucking, you know, some little last, you know, let's say had it planned unless they had it planned in a hangar. Yeah. But then what the, what the fuck? So what are you doing? Okay, you got it. She took the fucking plane, he took the people. What do you want? Where are the people? It's annoying. I mean that like, I mean, I wonder if if they had a plan and then something, they shut everything off and then something else went wrong. How, I mean, because they gotta be looking at satellite footage, like say even like remote areas, jungles and Shit, looking for pictures of smoke and fire. Something to try and find the fucking thing. I mean, look, the biggest mystery still on the planet is the ocean. So I think that that's where it is. It's at the bottom of the fucking ocean in some place where we can't find it.

Speaker 1:          00:53:31       I hope it isn't, but that's what I would guess, just for the simple fact that it's just weird that nobody claimed responsibility. There's no ransom demands. Um, I mean, how do you sneak a fucking seven 77 and into something with the amount of fuel they had? They know the distance it could go. There had to be something, dude, there had to be something to the fact that it's not, it should be on every fucking like I don't think there's enough coverage of it. Hell, I got a picture of Genoa. Well what the fuck? They probably would be alive. Well, I, if some point when there's no new information becomes like this fucking 250, 270 person cold case file that time to try to find, it's insane. It's fucking insane. It is. It is. And, and that's why I kept asking you every day we'd go hang out and bill would go, Paul, I can't fucking do you keep talking about it. And I'm like, I can't get it. I don't get it because you, you got this obsession with fucking planes and safety, you know, cause you're afraid to fly it. I don't fucking think about shit like that and that now your, your fear is starting to rub off on me. I'm scared. I go to the airport, I didn't mean to protect my fears on you. It's okay. You're all human.

Speaker 1:          00:54:39       All right. Uh, whatever. Perfect. I really hope that that ends, you know, I hope doesn't have some sort of Chuck Norris Delta Force thing that ends it fucking happily, but that is a rough state and I'm like, God, the fucking poor people, they got to sit there wondering when, when, what's going on and they suffer. Now what's going on is terrible. It's awful. All right, great question buddy. All right. What's your beef deer farmer bill? If you could only eat one type of meat and one type of vegetable for the rest of your life, what would they be? Got to figure some choices are more versatile in the kitchen. All right. Uh, I wouldn't go fish because I would worry that I'd get the mercury thing. Um, I couldn't go red meat because I ended up like John Wayne Chicken is all slimy and you're fucking end trails. I would have to go, uh, what else is it?

Speaker 1:          00:55:31       Turkey. I go Turkey. I'd go chicken. Cause if you cook it, if you cook it enough, like you'll get any kind of, but yeah, you're right. Yeah. The mercury in the fish red meat. Your bout, you're fucking agree. The fish and God knows what that meltdown in Japan has done to the fucking Sushi Jesus. Oh I had sushi yesterday, man. Fuck yeah. Yeah. I love fucking Sushi. Oh you got to pop. You know you're not going to have Sushi, but uh, no, I'll go chicken and vegetable. I hate vegetables. So I man, it's maybe Spanish, a little garlic. You know I love vegetables. Oh that would actually make you sad if like this is like fucking said. So I guess I would have Turkey every day with a, I almost want to pick a vegetable that I don't love cause I don't want to end up hating it because I got to eat it every day.

Speaker 1:          00:56:20       Cauliflower every day for the ready fucking, I'm already hate that shit. No cauliflowers unless they make the cauliflower mashed potatoes. That was one of those are bad. But the one reason why it's not bad, it's because you've got all the butter and salt and pepper in there. Yeah. But he, yeah, I mean I would go Turkey cause I could make a Turkey sandwich. I could make Turkey sausage. I could make shrimp list shrimp that like we saw that guy in Montreal, that actor, we were in an elevator with Bubba Bubba Gump and I didn't, I only saw that movie once. Yeah. I walked in there and I was like, Oh shit. Now we walked out like, you know who that was dude? I was like, yeah, he was in heat. He was down, was funny. It was funny. He was funny and insanely friendly and uh, and then I want it to go up and say something or invite them to his show and I was just like, let me fucking leave this guy alone.

Speaker 1:          00:57:03       Right. You said you saw another, there was a bunch of people, there were someone, a movie in a hotel, Turkey, bacon to think all the different fucking ways I could do it. Well, you wouldn't go Turkey, Turkey, you'd be a nightmare. The of fifth Turkey Sandwich. You'd be like, I fucked up, dude. Have to chicken every fucking day. Chicken, chicken, Parmesan chicken Scampi. You don't what? I just did check in check and Talky, talky, talky sandwich, Turkey sausage. I'm talking. You can put Marinara with Melton boots it. That's fucking, that's good for a month, you know? Then you'd be fucking dead shit. You'd be a tub of shit. Dude, do you can eat chicken palm every other day. You wouldn't be a tub of shit if you eat chicken every day. You know you've got to mix it up palm with all the pasta and all that shit. Got fucking bread. Your red wine discussing crimes. Whatever you Sicilians though.

Speaker 1:          00:57:52       I guess I would go Turkey. I love a Turkey sandwich and I think chicken is overrated in and then just the shit that you know, chickens, you know you've got the Salmonella, you get all that fucking shit with that, you know. Oh, there's a problem with everything. We know Paul, maybe we have a problem with you. You ever think that? No. I go chicken, spinach, chicken, spinach. I would go Turkey. You have a Turkey really doesn't go go with the vegetable. Chicken. Spanish is a good one that Chris Paul, you're better at this than I am. All right dude. You're a fucking, you committed some crazy fucking murder. You're on death row. You get your final meal. What are you going to have? Oh shit man. No, let me say this a rough on. You know that's so funny you asked me that. I leave. I had to actually lean back in the chair for that one.

Speaker 1:          00:58:41       That's it. That's tough. And this is assuming you could eat, okay, so nauseous that they're going to fucking kill me here. Yeah, I never understood that. They showed a list of what all the serial killers got and like one guy, one guy like Bundy or one of those guys just got an apple, but another guy got fucking like, he wanted a whole pie with like pepperoni. He wanted sandwiches and like he got the whole set. Like he just like everything that's a true fucking lazy man to be able to sit, you know. And he said a food court, like the guy eating an apple, he's probably just like, let me just taste one last thing. Let's have fun. He was a fucking, I don't know if it was Bundy, it might've been that McVay guy that blew the Timothy Mcveigh. And I remember this, he had an amp, got a pint of mint chocolate chip.

Speaker 1:          00:59:19       And that stuck with me cause I was like, I love mint chocolate chip and I eat a pint all the time. And that actually seemed like if someone was going to fucking kill me and I don't have any sympathy for these fucking people either, but I'm just saying that someone's going to kill me, you know it would, I know, you know, we're, we're fucking going to kill you at this time and it's coming up. I want something that's going to be a little easy on my stomach and for some reason I just think ice cream would be nice. Just be comforted.

Speaker 1:          00:59:46       Did I love, I love chicken cutlets man. Like I know like my mind. All right, when you asked a question, I'm thinking Italian or Sushi because I love it. But I love chicken cutlets with lemon squeezed on them. So I might do like a shitload a chicken because the chicken and I just thought chicken and dumplings, which I haven't in a long thing. It's any better than dumplings was a great chicken and dumplings in it. But then the mint chocolate chip did, they wouldn't go go with the debt. Did they let you drink on what? Like on your last meal if you ordered a bottle of red because that would be funny if you were hammered.

Speaker 1:          01:00:18       Yeah, you'd fuck yeah. Fuck yeah. You guys are looking at who you're going to kill the kill you fucking pussy. Yeah. You got enough guys. All my barriers were one on one. Look at you guys five on one. Ooh. What are the odds? Uh, you feel good about yourself? I don't think tail successful. Hang your hat on this one. They let them drink. That'd be fucking great. Why are you guys all have the same clothes on what you all call each other? Making the other psychos laughing as you're leaving. Show me the way to go. That judge was a fucking bag as what you would do, you would just start talking shit. Oh yeah, you did good. It only took his eight years.

Speaker 1:          01:01:16       You go into the death chamber and all the fucking family members are looking at, you guys do stuff. Oh, he didn't say menu. You was, I got caught. That's all I'm saying. I don't sweet. That'd be fucking amazing. Oh Dude. That'd be hilarious. Just walking out. Hey Buddy, buddy. Before you do it buddy, you know, the way they keep asking the question. But anyway, it only took you five years. I had those lockers in the attic for bad. Did you? Uh, there's been a couple of guys, uh, you know, some of the last words. One of the guys go, well, his last name was French and he yelled over the reporters. He goes, hey. And he was going to the electric chair. He goes, hey, he goes, I got your headline for tomorrow. He goes, French fries. And he's like, well, like last. And then they electrocuted him.

Speaker 1:          01:02:08       Did you see the one guy that they did it too and he fucking, they thought it was Friday fucking he popped up and he was like, fucking, he popped up like in a fucking horror movie. He was like a big guy and it didn't, he didn't, it didn't take the electric utem and they're all sitting there and exactly the Tom Hanks movie that really happened? No, no. A guy they showed it on, they showed it on one of those shows where they jolted him and like normally like the normal person, the show and he just went, it was like one of those death row inmate or like, it was like, uh, you know, people protesting outside. One of the guys that wrote you were dead on discovery channel alone and he like popped up for a second. I had a fucked up part two that I'm telling you scare the shit out of the fight. You got to make sure that it did. You know, I've got a friend of mine, you can electrocute, you can take a beat. And I know this guys were off. Okay. Why they put it with putting an electric chair. He got right back up again.

Speaker 4:          01:02:57       Boy, I've got a friend. He's tough. You know, sometimes I wish I was tougher. We all do bill.

Speaker 1:          01:03:09       We're not high. People are not drunk. This is what would, if I was, if I was hiring now be fucking losing my mind. All right. Uh, sad music. Oh, that's right up our alley. Why you bring it up? All right. Sad music. Dear Bill. Uh, from what you talk about on the, from what you talk about on the podcast, it seems like you're mostly into classic rock and music that involves really talented musicians. Uh, do you ever listen to a motional music? I mean, like a sad acoustic track or just anything depressing verse. He's already losing it. If so, do you put it on when you're sad or when you're happy? No, no, no. I listened to that stuff. Sometimes I'll need to get emotional when I'm there.

Speaker 4:          01:03:52       Cool. What song are we seeing in the car? Just once. I'm going to Jan and Megan. Just one night

Speaker 1:          01:04:04       try to do something else. And south. The South we were doing, we were saying, we'd say that to our wives one time when they would like bitching, yelling, how come you Blab, blah, blah, blah. It doesn't, and it's in the middle of them yelling. Just go stare at them and just go

Speaker 4:          01:04:21       it. Shut the fuck shower.

Speaker 1:          01:04:28       Why does it always have to be something to do? Hey, we just lie around the house. Joe's Wong,

Speaker 4:          01:04:35       Paul, you creep, you keep procrastinating and you sleep in late and the kids are up just once. We should let me sleep. You're

Speaker 1:          01:04:51       fucking talk all the time. I have nothing to say, lady. All right, sorry. Um, sad music. Do I listen to sad music? Yeah, probably the first sad songs I listened to other than Elton John where he was a little too on the head. Right. Sit her sad though. Like that's what I want. AC DC ride on. Lonely guy on the road. That was probably my first one. Do it. Every fucking heavy metal band had those home sweet homes. I'll tell you what said, you want to know what's the sad one?

Speaker 1:          01:05:28       Yeah, no I don't. I, you know, it's a sad song. Cat's in the cradle. You Go, you're going rocked on. I'm thinking more of like the just once like, you know, oh, you can't go hip hop hip hop, you can't do a sad song. They tried to do emotional wrap. Remember that? Yeah. And some people still try. Yeah. Like when it went wide, that Guy Drake, man, I just like, I don't, I mean I get it. Yeah. You know, look at guys, he's got a beard and shit. So women like him, but like when it just gets to a, I don't want to hear like, I don't wanna hear a rapper opening up. No rappers trying to open up by one of their rapper friends dies. But it's never really sad. You're more just like, you know, they'll just be like, you know, they just wrap it and you know, then what they did at that point out of 44 and that's like the most of it though.

Speaker 1:          01:06:12       I like that. Keep it like that. Okay. Nobody was better than you. Like it's a debt you can't get, you know, you don't. One of my favorite things in this business was opie from the opiate Anthony show was he had this thing that he would do when guys would start crying when they would play audio. Yeah. Oh my God. That was fucking, his timing was perfect. Every time someone would be talking like retiring from a sport, like when Mike Schmidt retired, which is, you know, it's very difficult to watch. He was like, you know, you know, he just was ending is like 38 years ago, a little boy began a journey to play the wonderful Kiera pace. Oop would always go, oh boy.

Speaker 4:          01:06:52       Okay,

Speaker 1:          01:06:53       what am I favorite? And it always, oh boy. It always meant, that's great. Nobody wants to see a man just completely, you know what it is. I can watch a guy cry if something terrible is happening. Just don't try to talk while you're crying. You know? That's the thing, the talking and then bursting out into cross. Let your shoulders go. Yeah, let me shut fucking crying. But don't fall for the love of God a man. He's a man. Needs to cry and private. Yeah. You do that in the shower. You do it in the shower. Like when my son was born, everyone's like, did you cry yet? And I'm like, no, what are you talking about? And then when my son was born, it all hit me later and I went home to go get stuff for my wife in the hospital and I sat on the couch and I didn't like weep, but I

Speaker 4:          01:07:36       gotcha.

Speaker 1:          01:07:38       I didn't weep when I got emotional. But like just picturing you sitting on the couch by yourself and just, you just go, that's stupid. It's just completely unexpected to use your thing from your podcast. Oh, that's unexplored. The effect. That's unacceptable dude on it. Completely. The talk into it, right? Yeah. The talk into it. That's, that's what the fight of about crying is. You know, it's like, you know, you always do this to me, you know, you always do this to me and I'm trying my best and it's over fucking over with. Some of my friends die. I've had so many who it died. I just cry in shower. Yes. What I do. I asked a girl, we asked a girl. Right, because you don't feel like you're crying cause there's all that water on your face anyway.

Speaker 1:          01:08:24       No. We asked the girl, we go, what would you do if your dude started crying? Like if it wasn't, if nobody died, if a dude and you are just art, he just had a bad day and he just had a bad day and you got into it and he broke down and cried and she goes, yeah, no over, over, over. Get the fuck away from me. Yeah. You know what's funny? There's some women they think that they want to see that part of you. They don't get what that is to them is that's their total conquest. Yeah. You know when you bang a girl in the ass and he's just like, yeah, I got this shit. I'm fucking with you.

Speaker 1:          01:08:52       Their version of that Jesus built no fuck with you. Their version of that is is if they can get you to be so vulnerable around them that you cry and then it's one of those things. It's almost like when the crowd screams out a joke, they already heard, they think they want to hear it again and then you tell it's like, ah, it wasn't as good. Now it's the same thing. Is that, yeah. And you said something, you said something about like if a burglar comes in, if you cry in front of a woman, all her mind is like, what if the Burger comes in at this fucking guy? Yeah, no, it's over. You can't cry. You Strip a woman a security if you cry in front of her. I think, I don't think I've cried for, I think my wife saw that's what it is. Like a stripper for security. Cause now she's like, well I got this fucking, yeah, this fairly crisis baby sleep and next thing, you know. Yeah, it's, it's over. You know, and Oh yeah, no, you just, you might as well just have a pullover sweater on, you know, walking around and then she mocks you. What are you going to cry, bitch, you so me?

Speaker 1:          01:09:51       Yeah, it's fucking over, dude. You can't have that. Uh, so sad music. A cat's in the cradle with classic one. Uh, no. I actually listened to a lot of, I believe it or not. Like, I mean you always have like your core shit that you listen to. I like some Phil Collins when it's sad. What does it rain down me? Ooh. Well I hated that annoying one when he was sitting there like ruining my day by bringing up homeless people. Like I don't look at them and feel bad for him day for you and me twice because it's just another day for you and meet you and me and paradise.

Speaker 1:          01:10:39       That fucking stupid song. Yeah. No, I hate when people do and that's all the money to that went to homeless people. That's one of, that's just pandering to the, if you have a crack, have you ever cried alone listening to a song or like not cried, but have you ever been like, oh no, I've completely broken down and I've told the three cars just weeping uncontrollably. Have I? Yeah, like totally cry. No, no. I've definitely teared up. Listen as an, as an artist, at some point you're going to have to go to those emotions. You need to, you need to be a, you need to meet to with your instrument though. I have, I have, what was the ones like I had this weird thing where, um, I stopped crying at some point. I Dunno when I stopped crying and got mad more when, when I got hurt and my brother beat the shit out of me.

Speaker 1:          01:11:25       Um, you know, most of the crying I'd be, it's just like at the end of it. But I wasn't, but I wasn't crying. And then I didn't cry one time too. I remember my brother is bigger than me, my little brother's biggest thing. Right. Big Toe. Like, and I remember he thought I said, I said, if you fucking take my clothes again, if you take my clothes, and he did it every day he would go into my room, we take my belt to take my clothes and I'd come home and I guess in a boy band and I, I need to go, I need to go out. Right. And I go, mom, if he does it again, I'm fucking hitting him. If, and my mom be like, oh, you know, he just, and he, and one time I need really needed a shirt and I'm fucking throwing shit through the house.

Speaker 1:          01:12:05       And he gets out of his friend's car and he starts walking up and he's got it on and I fucking snap them. My grandmother was there and I jumped on him and I started punching him and he stood up and he just goes, well, you made your older brother cried on my younger brother. Oh, he's bigger than me. But he didn't know what to do. He got so upset that he just got, and he looked around, he just, he was so angry that something needed to come out. And he just goes, what did you feel bad? And you start, oh, I kind of just walked away. And you know, we laughed about it afterwards, but to now, now he's a, he's a fuck, he's a big kid. But you know, my mom had the opposite. I get a little brother, man, he's an animal, you know, my mom says she went to a, she went to a funeral once and everybody was there and everybody was crying and she was overwhelmed with emotion that they had to fucking drag her out.

Speaker 1:          01:12:55       She said she had them all. One of the most embarrassing things happen to her where she said she uncontrollably laughed because they said that that could happen sometimes. So she's sitting there, she's, she's sitting there and everybody's crying and like, she went up and she could not stop laughing and like she, and I said, why? And she was like, Paul, I just don't know. She goes, I could not stop laughing and I had to walk me out. And like [inaudible] mom. Yes. She said because the emotions or somebody that they said that that could happen sometimes where it's just you just like, she didn't know what to do. So instead of just breaking down, she went the other way and just couldn't, couldn't control their, and like, humans will protect you in a really, like, that's what they don't get sometimes when comics make fucking horrific jokes about some bad event.

Speaker 1:          01:13:37       Make good jokes. Yeah. It's about a horrific event. So they go, that's so fucking me. It's a defense mechanism. It's all she, my mom is, my mom was a sweetheart who felt bad and her emotions just went the other way. And she goes, Paul, I felt so bad. I couldn't control myself so I could control myself. I hate to say this because somebody lost somebody, but there was, if there was video of that, oh my God. Oh, I'm sorry. I was saying, so I somewhere around, I don't know, 10 or 11, I didn't cry for years, years and years and years. And I didn't, I didn't cry until a friend of mine killed himself. And even then I was sad and it's just, Oh, I went, uh, I was in the bathroom once again. Yeah. And it was in there. And I remember I started to cry and then I started thinking like, wow, I'm crying. I haven't cried in a long time. And then I stopped because I could out of it cause I stopped thinking about the Duke killed himself. Wow. Yeah. I went 10 years without a cry and then I had one. What was it over yogurt? Gummy bears?

Speaker 1:          01:14:36       No. Uh, I think, yeah, it might've been, it might've been one of my son was born, you know, it might've been on my son. One. That's acceptable. I guess it's acceptable. Back in the day. He just stood out in the waiting room. Right. And smoked a cigar. No, you Irish dudes don't cry. I said, today I even just tweeted something. Irish dude, I swear to God, I've never seen a funny your group of people who ae take pain and just take a vet. Some of the funniest people to talk. See Acceptance. They see it's the acceptance of the beating and you don't try to change it. He just, you just keep running into the brick wall. Something so comical about just accepting the beading, not trying to remedy it at all. I don't, I don't have that 100% anymore because of getting into this business and traveling and seeing other types of ways of dealing with shit.

Speaker 1:          01:15:20       But like dude, I was actually thinking the other day like my bloodline, German, Irish, Scottish English right there. I mean that would make a therapist to a spit take like you fucked emotionally when you have that blood running through you. I don't know what it is. And then, uh, let's see when we get hung over and we had a night out the night before and then I see you in the lobby and you just see the look on my face and I'm miserable and I'm looking at him and we'll go on this guy did what I did. How is he just taking it? Like you don't even show you just fucking put your head down and go me, I put, that's how I got sick. Yeah. Cause we, we will, we will find that uh, that cigar private place. We smoked cigars and Calgary, we drank, we got like three hours sleep and we woke up, came here.

Speaker 1:          01:16:01       Yeah. Took a fucking steam. And then I came back and like an asshole, but I'm going to go work out. Oh, that's sleep. And then I fucking jumped on the treadmill and then worked out and I came back and then right when we get to the theater and may head, I was going like, this is dumb bill. Don't go down to the treadmill because you just got all taught in the steam thing and then you gonna run down there sweating and you only got three hours. You go versus, Hey, what'd you do? I go, I took a nap. I laid down. It was Greg, what would you do? You? I go, do you get some sleep? He goes, no, no. I went to the gym like there's a fucking animal can be self a break. I go until I get sick and then I give myself a break.

Speaker 1:          01:16:36       Whatever. Paul, Hey, what do you want from me? Okay, then who else? You got a friend, he doesn't quit. You know it's, I don't, I want to, I'm just afraid it's Shabbot does you? So it's obnoxious. It's this point people that I don't care. Fuck you. You do 20 days in a row. All right. Problem with ex-girlfriend. Uh, Bill. Uh, I have a question regarding how to handle a situation with my ex girlfriend. I used to really hug, kiss and squeeze her all the time. After we broke up. I talked to a pretty 20 year old in a coffee shop about squeezing and

Speaker 2:          01:17:09       making out in the blue water in Thailand. She really got into an, asked me to show her how I would pleasure her in the ladies room. Do this guy's got some game. He sitting there painting a picture to the points. There you go. He goes, I have always been a romantic. So I said, yes, that's hilarious. I'm a romantic. I'll take you to the ladies room. Oh my God. This movie. I kind of got into eating around and I don't get this graphic egos. I added some dirty talk and I think somebody might have listened in. I saw my ex girlfriend leave the copies. Wait, she was in there later, but she did not say hello. Wait a minute. I got with the graphicness of this. Wait, wait, wait. I talked to him in a coffee shop. She was really into it. So wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. So I saw my ex girlfriend leave the coffee shop, so she was there as you did all of this, but she didn't say hello. I met with this girl couple of times and she always wanted to play me to pleasure her in public places, like the movies, et Cetera. She's got a fetish here. Then she suddenly proposed that I would pleasure her friend who I had met a couple of times. Dude, fuck you. What? This is awesome dude. You don't have to achieve shit after it was the coffee shop. All right.

Speaker 2:          01:18:24       I know from experience that this would be a red flag, but I said yes because I am 42 on now. He's a creep 42 what do you, what are you doing? He's still out there and I really log in as question goes. The more it sounds like a lot. Yeah, I know. Right? And I really love to pleasure women after having pleasure. This woman in a changing room in a department store. I against Sama ex-girlfriend leaving without saying hello, where dude, this is fucking bullshit. You keep pleasure in this woman and your girlfriend keeps showing up and up and I'll buy it. Uh, but I got rid of, this is such a great story. I'm going to finish it though. Um, later my ex girlfriend called me and was a bit upset. She asked me, am I not a woman? You would have sex in a public place with now the correct grammar would be a woman with whom you would have sex in a public place.

Speaker 2:          01:19:10       Do you think I should correct your grandma? This is all a bullshit one or would you think that correcting her as a sign of not being over her, I don't buy that man. That's just too fucking crazy. I mean, that was, that's like, I never heard of anything and he's 42. That was very well written, phony question and I liked all the fucking left turns. It was wonderful. I enjoy it. There's no way that could be real right now. No, not, I mean, you sit in a fucking coffee shop when your ex girlfriend's sitting there. Not saying hi and then she and she doesn't work at the coffee shop and other girls like, hey man, why don't you come in the bathroom and eat me out? I mean, it's like I listen that alone, that could happen, but to then have it happen again and it Thailand, you know what I mean?

Speaker 2:          01:19:50       The departments do. I heard a lucky play. The Lotto Buddy. Jesus. Um, all right, well this is the last one in then. We got it. We got to run here. Um, am I a whore? A hey there Billy fat face. Fuck you. I've been on the treadmill. Uh, I am a senior in high school and might be a whore. I know you're the lean mean redheaded machine when it comes to calling out whores. So I'll let you be the judge. I I listen, I don't fucking judge you here. All right. My ex boyfriend who was a year older than me, he left for college at the end of last year. He goes to University of Washington and decent leap from Arizona. Um, where we went to high school. We broke up after Jay dating just over a year because we ultimately agreed that a long distance relationship with suck for both of us. Plus I eventually knew I'd be plagued with the thought of him balls deep in some artsy whore and it would get to me.

Speaker 2:          01:20:41       That's girls hilarious. Um, however, when we've visited this for his winter break, about six months later, I came onto him again. He initially didn't want to get back together because he knew he was leaving and thought I'd be a, I'd be hurt in the long run, but quickly gave in, we were basically dating again for the entire three week break. He was here holding hands in public and going on dates where one of us would pay or the other. Um, what do we got to finally we left without any incident, but it felt like we kind of flashed back to are heavily involved relationship. Here's what things start to get sleazy on my part. His friend Devin, oh boy was always around hill. Oh boy. Oh boy. His friend Devin was always around when we were dating, trying to insert himself into things. When my ex and I would hang out.

Speaker 2:          01:21:30       My ex thought it was creepy and shut them down, but ever since he left, I've been hanging out with Devin a lot. Oh, how'd you do this? All the dicks in the world. You're going to jump on this one, um, which would make you a whore. It just kinda makes you like, uh, you could have had a better selection here. Here we go. I spent Valentine's Day with them and then she writes you, oh Geesh. Uh, but nothing happened. And I sent my ex a picture to see what his reaction would be. That's what she's doing. It upset Him and he told me that it really pissed him off and was comparable to cheating. Later this month, I went to a formal event with him and pose, posted a picture on Twitter. I texted my ex later that week and he told me it was really pissing them off, how I dragged him back into having feelings for me and then rub my proverbial dick in his face.

Speaker 2:          01:22:18       I apologize. But ever since then, he seemed kind of pissed at me and interest and not interested in talking to me. What do you think that Billy boy, am I a dirty whore? Is his just anger justified or is he just being a jealous con loved the podcast, thanks and go fuck yourself. Um, you're not a whore. You're not a dirty whore. Uh, which you are is, you're being a really mean person because you don't know how to express the fact that you still have feelings for him. So you dragged them back into it and maybe, um, you didn't want to break up with them, but you, or maybe you thought you did and now you're having second thoughts about it and rather than just saying that to him, uh, the pain you have that you're not together, you're now sort of for some reason taking it out on him by doing everything that you know is going to tear his heart out of his chest. So you need to stop doing that. That's what I would say. Yeah, that's exactly

Speaker 1:          01:23:06       like, it's like just nobody had come, nobody just picks up the phone and says, Hey, like keep sending the poor guy pictures and fucking doing that tune. There's no look, they're young. They're young. You don't know what, you don't know how to do stuff like that. And sometimes you're doing shit and you don't know why you're doing shit cause you don't know who you are yet. So I'm not judging this person, I'm just saying what you're doing is really, it's really unnecessarily mean. One thing that's not brought up. What about Devins feelings? I know he must really seem to care for nothing like this. Two guys getting fucked. She sent him pictures. I don't know. Just listen. Without a doubt. Devin. Devin is not a good dude cause it's his friend. It's his friend and he was trying to move in on it when, uh, when, uh, when they were still together.

Speaker 1:          01:23:47       So that guy, you know, it's weird. You know who's going to lose in all of this is going to be you because you're, you're with this creep. This guy's a fucking creep. Um, or maybe he's just, you don't know he's a creep. Don't maybe, maybe he always had feelings for her and the other guy didn't treat. We don't know. I just went with creek. But she said that her ex boyfriend said it was creepy. I don't fucking know, Paul, what am I going to solve? The solve the problems of theft in 18 and 19 year olds. I can't do this. All right, look, yeah, stop doing that to them. Stop posting stuff, sending pick and you're, you're acting like you don't know what you're doing. At least as a far as like a hurting the person. You're hurting them, you're hurting them and you should stop.

Speaker 1:          01:24:25       Um, and if you don't, then you're a mean person, but you're not a whore. She's not a whore now. And that's not a whore. That's not a whore. What is a hoarder? You, Paul, if she sent pictures while she's blowing Devin, I mean, that'd be a little fucking much, you know? But even then as you get older, when you start to think of the psycho psychological reasons as to why a woman would do that, you know, and it always goes back to some sort of family issue that they would do then some sort of insecurity and you know, having no boundaries, right. The Times when something like that happens, you got touched as a kid. I'm kind of paraphrasing some of the shit that I've heard some, no, I just think a horse, when I think of horror, I think of Eugene using sex, you, you know, doing sexual things or using sex in order to, to gain and do stuff like that, you know, to, to get yourself ahead through, through sex.

Speaker 1:          01:25:10       And she, and I would actually say that that's more of a sociopath who just happens to be using, uh, you know, sex rather than using a gun or a knife or something like that. They're just going up. They using the weapon that they got are all horse sociopaths. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. I would say, I would say no, not at all. I would say that, you know, men and women who have a bunch of fucking partner, different partners or something like that, the older I get, they're not like dogs and whores and stuff like that, like they have does something wrong with them, uh, beyond, um, look, there's something wrong with fucking being married and this is the only person you ever going to have sex with again. I mean that's, it's, there's something not fucking natural about that, but the other side of that is to just walk around fucking everybody, just fucking everybody.

Speaker 1:          01:25:58       Then there's something, there's something wrong about that. But what I'm doing is also, you know, my opinion is, is I'm come, I'm looking out my own head here, how I would feel. I remember, you know, I was out dogging around. I would always feel like a piece of shit on some level, past a certain age. You twenties you like psyched, like, yeah, he got another one right in your thirties. It starts to get, it starts to get sad such to get pathetic. So I, I wouldn't say you're a whore, but um, unfortunately we have to wrap up here. Paul another effortless podcasts. Great time.
