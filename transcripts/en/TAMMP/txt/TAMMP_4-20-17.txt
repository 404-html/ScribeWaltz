Speaker 1:          00:10          I'm just checking in on you. I'm just checking in on you. Oh, needy. What are you going going to go work out. There you go. Get on the elliptical. Do it. All right. That was part of our prenuptial agreement. Keep it looking good. It's exactly what it is. You would never dare try to get a prenuptial agreement with me. What are you talking about? I'm throwing it out there right now. I'm going to get up post married, prenuptial postnuptial agreement. No, I'm going to get all right. It's mine. All mine. You know I don't even give a shit. You want all this stuff? I don't care. It's a fucking headache. As long as they got enough for a sandwich. I'm good. I want every color of izod shirt. Yeah, seriously though.

Speaker 2:          01:00          Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:01          I will. I will leave you. There's a certain level that if you allow it, if you drop below, I'm walking his bald, pasty, redheaded male pushing 50 yeah. Good luck. Okay. Don't look at me like I don't have options. Woman. I've been out to the strip malls. I've seen the looks. Okay. You put me in a strip mall near that has a, a dentist and a place where they do your taxes. Okay. Fucking hedges whipping around. Yeah. Uh, she could at least pretend that I'm still kind of good looking. Right. All right. Anyways, what's up everybody? How are you? How's your week going? Is it going bad? Well, it's almost over. At least the bad part of it is, Huh? How about a moment of silence? How about a fun moment of silence for everybody who sitting in a fucking place they don't want to be right now, Huh? There was your moment and you know what? That's all you deserve. Why are you still there? Stand up. Push that plastic wheelchair away from that fucking, I know what I want you to do, right? Don't do that. You need a plan. Come up with a fucking plan and my stomach's can be grounded like crazy. I just, I just got off of a, got off of the plane, had a 7:00 AM flight, um,

Speaker 1:          02:25          came back from New York. I went to the, uh, and it's just an amazing, a memorial service for Charlie Murphy yesterday. And uh, I got to tell you this, um, cause you know, it's a private ceremony. Some, I can give any details, but I will tell you this, you know, Comedians, we, a lot of us may die young, but I will tell you this, we have great funerals.

Speaker 1:          02:46          It's fucking unbelievable. It was unbelievable. They, a New York legend was sent off by legends. It was, um, it was incredible. It was really incredible. So. MMM. Yeah, I'm still sad though. Obviously still sad, but he would have been very happy. I'm like morning to speak for him. Anything but like, uh, I hope I get sent off that. Well, it was a, yeah, there was definitely something else. So that's quite built, bring up something that you're not going to really give any details of. Well, you know, whatever. I just, I just, so anyways, so everybody hung out afterwards to like two 30 in the morning and I had like a, you know, 7:00 AM flight and the only way to it, there's two ways to handle a 7:00 AM flight, which is gonna involve like a fucking 4:30 AM pickup.

Speaker 3:          03:36          All right?

Speaker 1:          03:38          There's only two ways to do it. You either go to bed, you know, you drink some hot cocoa at 7:00 PM and you figure out how you're going to get your fucking eight hours, whatever you do. What do people do with your pills? Is that what you do? Well, you sit fucking Indian style foot of your bed going, okay,

Speaker 4:          03:56          oh,

Speaker 1:          03:57          whatever is whatever that meditation should is all right. Which I have not done. And I'll tell you the ramifications of that here in a minute. Um, do the do that or you just stay out drinking with your friends to like two 30 in the morning and then you come home, you get about an hour and a half, two hours sleep, you stagger to the fucking airport, whatever, out to the cab. You go in there and you just, the the biggest thing is not to nod off at the gate, you got to stay awake, but the lights are on in that type of shit. And then once you get to your seat, that's it. Then you're out. You're out at sea. It's fucking, and that's a great way to do it. Cause then you don't have to sit there bored out of your mind on the flight.

Speaker 3:          04:34          You know,

Speaker 1:          04:36          by the way, thanks to the person that sent me that fucking creepy video of that plane crash in which for some dumb reason, I'm sitting there watching it. But the tail section coming off this plane, these pilots trying to figure out a fucking way to try to land it, which of course you can at that point. Um, I wasn't surprised that they didn't invert. That's always a fun thing. Half asleep to be watching because you know, you have a sleep going like, wait, am I on this flight or is this a, is this a, should I be feeling that failing? You know, they sent me this video and I'm not getting on this plane. Well, you know what? I got on that God plane and I went right to sleep and woke up like, you know, five hours later, five hours later on a six hour flights. Perfect.

Speaker 3:          05:19          You know,

Speaker 1:          05:20          they come over, sir. Would you like anything? Would you catch a kid? Well, my job. Well I go, yeah. What do you got? Well, we got a mush rob. We got a a Portobello mushroom sandwich. Yeah, that's sounds gross. What else she got? I don't even know what the other thing was. I thought when she said the mushroom thing with the other thing, I thought it was all the same thing. I go, is that all one thing or is that two things? She goes, that's two things. And I went, all right,

Speaker 3:          05:43          okay.

Speaker 1:          05:44          I, I don't want anything. I got a new thing. I don't eat on planes. I'm not fucking doing it. I'm not fucking doing it. It's just, it's, it's fucking shit food. Empty going to do it. You're like, I'm fucking five miles up from the surface of the, of the, of, of the earth. You know, the only thing you should be eaten up there as shit that you shouldn't be like, like Pringles potato chips and stuff. Why would you eat those? And you'd just sit in there, you get beat, just becoming a fat fuck. So, uh, I sort of been doing this thing this year is I'm trying to fucking drop some weight here. You know, even though I'm a dad, I'm not going to have the fun, I'm not having the fucking dad bod not having that thing. You know the thing when you go to lift up your arms just shirt comes up and it's just that fucking pork shoulder spilling out on the side and ain't happening to me.

Speaker 1:          06:36          Um, I was speaking of which, so, uh, you know, I packed hastily cause I, I when I went to Boston first and then to New York and uh, so I grabbed a suit and everything in my shoes. So I have them, uh, for the memorial service and I forgot to bring dark socks. All right. And also I was working out and doing the elliptical and all that type of stuff. So I thought it brought enough boxers and I didn't. So I was like, fuck. So I landed in New York, I get to the hotel and it's, you know, would like in midtown and shit. We meaning me and all my fucking personalities. And uh, so I called me up. I tell her where I'm at. I was like, fuck, you know, the car's coming to get me to take me over to the service, you know, I need some, uh, underwear, which should I go, there's, this is New York.

Speaker 1:          07:27          There's no fucking gaps anywhere. They're all like downtown or way up town. And I'm right in the middle. I don't have time. And she asked me where I was at and she goes, oh, I ain't know that. And I was like, I guess like a gay neighborhood. She goes, go around the corner, there's upstairs and one of those fucking stores. So we've got across the store, right straight, right. And there's like, you know, the second you see the mannequins, you know what I mean? You know that it's, yeah, this is like a, it's a gay store. It's for gay men. So I don't give a fuck. I need underwear, right? Gay Men still wear underwear. So I walk in there and it was just like Jesus Christ. It was like cock rings on the fucking wall, which by the way, I thought that was the same is like, uh, like when people get their Dick Pierce, which I still don't know where they do that.

Speaker 1:          08:09          It's like a navel ring, but it's on your Dick. So I thought a cock ring, you know, I, I thought that that was the same thing, but it wasn't, it was like a, uh, look like something you'd use in plumbing, like a gasket. Evidently you put that around your Dick for some reason. Then what? You Swivel your hips and it's like, oh, it's like a hula hoop for your dick evidently. Right? So I fucking go in the back and the underwear, it's like ridiculous. It was like all these Fred Flintstone prince, you know what I mean? There was like Asilis Shit. And then I finally find a pair that was just all black and on the waistband it's said nasty pig. So finally just yell over to the dude behind the counter, go, hey, you got any like normal like mainstream underwear here? And he's like, defy normal or main street.

Speaker 1:          08:59          And I was like, oh, I don't, it doesn't say nasty pig on the phone. The waistband it as material around the ass. And when it does, it doesn't say fuck my whole on the back, you know, regular, just underwear. It's like, hang on. And he fucking comes over there and he ended up finding some that would just, we'll all black, you know, Greg Louganis style. But uh, they will, the only size they had was small, which was fucking hilarious to me because I was just like, yeah, why would you have a medium? This is like gay guys. They want to see that their boyfriends junk spilling out the side. Oh, you nasty pig. So I had the leave there and the closest place was fucking Tj Maxx. Oh my God. The fucking animals.

Speaker 3:          09:52          Okay.

Speaker 1:          09:53          Uh, half of it was the way they had the store, like the way they had this store set up, it's just like, it was so fucked up. It's like, it was like I was in Manhattan, the crown jewel of fucking cities in the United States. Right. And the second I walked into fucking Tj Maxx, I mean I might as well Ben at a fucking Walmart in the middle of nowhere. And I am talking down to Middle America and they're Walmart's. I am talking down to it, although I'm not actually, you know those Walmarts aren't that bad other than on black Friday. Black Friday is a day you don't want to fucking go down there cause that's like white people, bloods and crips, you know, that's our version of it. It's flannels and fucking in flip flops. That's, that's our bloods and crips and that you don't still want to be there on that day. You know when they have one Atari for $3 way in the back of the store and everybody's just basically going to trample people. Like they go into the fucking who concert Cincinnati way back in the day there. I mean other than that, you know, it's not, it's not that bad a store,

Speaker 3:          11:03          you know,

Speaker 1:          11:05          it's got all kinds of food, giant selections. I've gone in there a bunch of times. I don't know why I brought that up. I just don't know what the fuck I'm talking about this point. Oh TJ Maxx, you get the Max bowl, the number at Tj Maxx. Um, so I go in there and it's, you know, typical Manhattan fucking store where it's like half the stores downstairs and the others in is on the ground floor on the others is like upstairs, you know, cause they slammed this little fucking store in there

Speaker 3:          11:32          and um,

Speaker 1:          11:34          finally find some underwears and uh, I'm like, fuck, I got to stand in this God damn like Disneyland level line. And like, all right, they got 12 fucking registers open. So even though there's like 24 people, you know, roughly each one of these cashiers just knocks out to people and then it's turn, all right, this shouldn't be this bad. And it was this woman in front of me. I don't know what kind of soap she used, but like I would divorce her, I swear to God, even if she made my heart stop, I'd be like, I love you. I wish nothing for you. But this fucking soap, it's a specific soap. I've smelt it before. It wasn't, she didn't smell bad. She smelled of this soap. I don't know what the fuck it is, but it just, I can't be around it but I had to beat or someone's going to cut me and then they just walked you through, you know the Disneyland thing where you walk all the way to the right.

Speaker 1:          12:26          Then you go back to the left, you know, zig zagging all the way up. It just the, the shit that they had, you know, the impulse buys in everybody. If they weren't staring at their fucking phones. We're just picking up these things and the more I saw people picking up the shit, looking at it like the angry or I was getting like, why are you picking that up? You don't need that. Let me find you the names of these fucking things. Okay. They had this one thing it said, I would thank you from the bottom of my heart, but for you, my heart has no bottom. And it was just framed in this piece of shit would frame and on a white piece of paper with just regular font like please don't walk away with the bathroom key, like the same kind of font, you would use it that at the gas station they wrote that fucking cheesy heartfelt message. And what the fuck was the next one? Oh, it was just some sort of like coconut almonds, yummy clusters or something was called. I know that's how I was able to, this is like this is the demographic come in, let's, let's become fat fucks and talk about how we love each other. I don't want to talk about, so I'll get the underwear and I fucking get back to the hotel room. And I realize in my looking down at everybody in Tj Maxx, I forgot to get socks so I had to go back to the gay store, you know.

Speaker 2:          13:49          Okay.

Speaker 1:          13:49          And, um, you know, I come walking into the store and the same dudes behind the counter and I was just like, dude, you got a, you sell socks here, you know, cause all he had was white sox. I was going to sit down at church and they were going to come up and they're like ankles, like Nike socks. I was going to with like fucking wing tips. I wasn't going to do that. So they actually had regular socks. So that's what I learned at the gay store. They just had regular Nike socks, but for some reason the tag on him took a picture of it. I got to send this, I'm going to going, you know what? I'm going to tweet this out or whatever. The tag on the socks just said, bitch, please. There's just some, I guess woman or maybe a guy in drag with his face all twisted up.

Speaker 1:          14:30          Um, I got on bitch please. Socks by Nike, you know, and they feel normal. These are made for gay feet, but for some reason they seem to fit mine just, just fine. I don't know what the fuck I'm talking about. Um, I mentioned earlier that I hadn't been meditating and it came to a head so to speak. And uh, remember when I was bitching, updating my fucking phone and then trying to update my laptop and there's no one to call and I'm typing in the right passwords and the two are not in sync and I don't know how to do it. I finally had a meltdown and my laptop was closed and I took my phone and I just fucking slammed it down like corner first onto my laptop, you know, somewhere between a jab in an overhand right. But it was a stabbing motion and uh,

Speaker 3:          15:22          I dunno what

Speaker 1:          15:24          then I fucking open my laptop in the screen was broken. So my question I have for you guys

Speaker 3:          15:30          okay,

Speaker 1:          15:30          is not, do I need anger management? I know I do. My question is, is can people just fix a fucking screen? Do you can do that. It's not the hard drive. It was no water get, they just take that out. It's like I got a broken windshield and my laptop and they can they do that? I'm going to find out, I'm going to find out because once again I didn't back up anything there and I was just really thinking like I did back anything up and I didn't back anything up my phone when I dropped it in the toilet. But do I miss any of that data, data, whatever the fuck you say it. And the reality is is I don't.

Speaker 3:          15:59          Okay.

Speaker 1:          16:00          I mean, most of my pictures is taking pictures of shit that I hate. You know, people's dirty feet and fucking heartfelt photos and gay socks that say bitch, please. I mean, do I, do I really need to save these somewhere? I just loved the idea that these exist somewhere in a cloud, in this cease fucking people trying to figure out with the shit that I take a picture of. Like what can they sell me next? K Gay socks, coconut clusters. I would thank you from the bottom of my heart, but for you, my heart has no problem. Okay. This is a fat gay male with a sugar addiction.

Speaker 3:          16:37          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          16:37          And a foot fetish. Um, anyways, so I got to read, um, oh, by the way, my daughter laugh for the first time yesterday, twice and I was on the road and I didn't get to see, I didn't get to hear it, but, um, I'm hanging out with her all, all day today, um, other than the benefit I have to do tonight and I'm really like psyched. Like, um, I came home and of course dropped everything and picked her up and um,

Speaker 3:          17:07          okay.

Speaker 1:          17:08          She just smiled for like three minutes straight, which was amazing. And I could tell she was getting sleepy and I can read her body language. She was on the floor and she started doing this thing, like she's trying to sit up and my guard, she wants to get up and I just put her on my lap and we were watching these people in Maine rebuild cabins or some shit and um, I felt her start to slump slumped to the right. And I knew that she was falling asleep and she was asleep, which as I was like, this is a perfect time to do the podcast, but felt so awesome her just laying there. Then I stayed there for like another 20 minutes and I'm, I'm kind of breaking down parenting into just like sections where I know like I was like, all right, I got 18 years with her before she goes off to college.

Speaker 1:          17:53          God willing, so how many months is that? I just did three of them. And then the other big countdown is the first three years. So the first three years, all I have to do is just fill her up with love support. And when I do lose my temper because I'm going to, I'm going to apologize to her and ask her to help me work on it. So she's not like necessarily afraid, you know, I just don't, I got to kill this, uh, this aspect of my family tree cause everything else is pretty, uh, you know, acceptable. But I don't want to be the guy stabbing his fucking laptop with this phone, freaking his kid out. Do I do, you know, who wants to be that person and you laying on your death bed one day and they come walk in and you know, peaking and still nervous to be around you just be like, yeah, sorry. Yeah,

Speaker 5:          18:41          sorry. Are you back at eight two dash 82

Speaker 1:          18:46          I don't want to have that. So, um, yeah, I'm hanging out with her all day today, reading books and the whole thing. So I've also decided like, all right, so I still gotta do my two weekends a month. So those would be like six days. I won't see her, but I'll actually see her more than if I had like a nine to five because then I can come home and just totally focused on her, you know, for the next 10 days before I go out on the road. So, you know, and every person that's apparent, they all say it goes by so fast, it goes by so fast. So I just keep thinking that every fucking time. Um, every day. So hopefully, hopefully, you know, hopefully I don't fuck this up, but I'm not gonna lie to you. I know I'm a mess, so I'm definitely, uh, you know, the jury's out.

Speaker 1:          19:33          Hate people walk her home a great dead. I'm a great dad. Shut the fuck up. That's not for you to say somebody says that to you. You can't, um, you know, awesome.

Speaker 1:          21:06          maybe a little younger, about 45 46 and it was one of those fucking hot brutally.

Speaker 2:          21:12          Okay.

Speaker 1:          21:13          Hot summer days.

Speaker 2:          21:15          Okay.

Speaker 1:          21:15          In La. And he came and still wearing his sport coat and all that and he was just like miserable. Okay. He already walks around with a certain level of agitation, which I could totally relate to is, remember I said I walk around at a six so going up to 10 isn't that quick of a ride. So Louis came in and there was like nobody in the fucking club. It was like the mid nineties, like 95, 96 and comedy was still dealing with the 80s hangover, still waiting to make another comeback. And uh, so he goes in there in front of like three fucking people. I don't have three tables of people, whatever. And I had never seen him and he got in there and

Speaker 2:          21:55          okay,

Speaker 1:          21:56          he was legit upset about how fucking hot it was outside and then you combine that with his material and his stage persona and he got that finger going and it was like,

Speaker 1:          22:11          I'll never forget that I was fucking dying. This guy when he was in front of like 11 people murdering, like he was at Carnegie Hall and um, that was just one of those great jet just moved to New York and it was just one of those great, oh my God, who the fuck is this guy? How have I never seen this guy? How doesn't everybody know who this guy is? And within like three, I was like 95, 96 and I want to say he hit around like 99 w was quick within like by 1999 I think he went on the road and he did that. Um, that classic comedy tour lineup. It was him, Mitch Hedberg and Dave Attell. Can you believe that? That was a fucking tour. Hey, we're going to go out and go see comedy tonight. Oh yeah. Who you seen? I don't know this Guy Louis Black, this up and coming guy. Mitch Hedberg Hedberg I'm trying to think of a David tell had his show yet. Um, and I think he had insomniac. Maybe Mitch had his half hour up, but um, I didn't even get to see that fucking talk cause I was too busy slugging it out my fucking hell rooms. I would have loved to have seen that. Um, so anyways, so I'm sitting here, Babylon are supposed to be reading a

Speaker 1:          23:29          advertise. I'm telling stories. All right. Frame bridge everybody.

Speaker 2:          23:33          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          23:33          So weird. I just shot one day on a movie and Framingham, Framingham, Massachusetts out there on fucking off of route nine. I believe I used to do the Nixon Framingham up there a long time ago, over 20 years where they go, all right, frame bridge everybody give your personal experience using frame, bridge.com if applicable. I've never used it. It sounds like a great idea, but I stabbed my fucking laptop in the face, stabbed in the face. I always have to say in the face, you know what that's from. That's from uh, the great performance given by that cop in the bathroom in reservoir dogs. The way he, the rhythm of the way he speaks is soap. Like perfect cop. I said, buddy, I am going to shoot you in the face. You don't put your fucking hands. And that dashboard, that's one of those movies when you've seen it that many times, like all the usual lines and everybody quotes out of the fucking blue.

Speaker 1:          24:34          You know, I'm trying to be a fucking professional. You always got big kill asshole. All those ones that everybody knows. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Bam, Bam, Bam, Bam, Bam. Look at dam and done. What I told them not to do. Um, everybody knows those lines.

It just reminded me of this comedian Denny live from Philly and I remember when he was, he was doing this white Guy Dan. He's a black dude. So he's doing this white guy. And the way he was doing the cadence and the way, the way the guy was talking was, uh, you know, that was like sort of, uh, at the height of the fallout of the hacky white guy.

Speaker 1:          25:32          Like James. Like I got to do my taxes, like that fucking thing that he was actually legitimately doing a white guy, uh, like an impression that I couldn't even fucking do, but I could see the dude that he was doing.

Speaker 1:          28:07          Uh, and you Teddy's the old CB there. I'm sorry, Blue Apron. Everybody remember that fucking movie that was just on the CB was just above fucking truckers. Kris Kristofferson was, was in it. And uh, Ernest Borgnine was, was the state trooper up there in the helicopter convoy. And I remember they were trying to get this fucking convoy of trucks to just stop driving. It was like vanishing point with like 70, 72,000 fucking 18 wheelers. They just, when they weren't stopping for nothing, man, they were just out there and you're just going to keep on driving. So these cops were trying to stop them and they for some reason couldn't send out Ernest Borgnine, you know, sort of the go between, between truckers and cops. Like he understands him. So there's some cut up in the elevator going, hey, you fucking truckers. This is, this is the place where up here to helicopter, uh, we really don't have a gun turn or anything, but we're watching you so you better be nervous. You know, he's trying to make threats up there in his fucking helicopter. So Ernest Borgnine, it just shakes his head. He goes at, it, ain't going to listen to that. And he grabs the CB, goes these truckers, he goes, they got a language all their own and then he goes to talk to them down there and he goes, this is the bear in the air.

Speaker 1:          29:32          The, I forget how you delivered that line. Even fucked it up. This is the bear in the air, like smokey the bear, you know, smokey the cop and all of them. Do I have to break it down to, you know, that's one of the things that I can't fucking stand. I hate when obvious slang people feel that they have to break it down to, you know what I mean? I remember one time I saw this one man show and the guy goes, we were going into Maddie Hattie. He goes, that's Manhattan for all you white people. I want to be like, oh, it was so slick. And Claire, I mean, you're almost saying man at and, and of course they got a laugh. White people, they don't understand things. Um, all right, let's get, what am I, am I technically in the middle of a read here?

Speaker 1:          36:12          all right. Okay. Oh Jesus, Boston sports. Let's Talk Boston sports. Dudded add that data. Um, Jesus, what a couple of fucking games those were. Um, all right, let's start with the Boston Bruins. We've lost three games straight to the Ottawa. Um, I missed the law. Um, I missed yesterday night's game cause I was at the memorial service, but I definitely watched game two and game three. And although we had a furious, got back and gave three, it was not enough. I was actually in the north end. I mean the cigar bar smoking his stogy hoping it was going to be a good thing. Um, what a fuck. And that was a great goal though. And over time it'll give and go. Got To admit. And, uh, I dunno. I Dunno. They just been out playing us and they, they deserve it. Now granted it was a shit call but there's going to be shit calls. It's just going to happen. But uh, you know,

Speaker 2:          37:13          yeah,

Speaker 1:          37:13          I dunno. Shit call a no shit call. We've lost three games in a row. So I mean get all, you can only look in the mirror. So we'll see what happens. Um, the excitement of the Bruins making the playoffs is quickly subsiding here. I would like to see them win a series and now there they got their fucking back's up against the wall. So we'll see. We'll see. We'll see when game five comes up, I imagine tomorrow. All right. And then the Celtics, oh, Jesus Celtics have been completely exposed. I know that that's probably been said a thousand times. You know what's funny is when I first got back into the NBA, which I got back into it cause Paul Versey was coming out here and he loves the NBA and he was staying with me, him and his lovely wife staying with me and my lovely wife for like four or five days and a I'm a hell of a host or what a host, what a host.

Speaker 1:          38:05          Right. So I'm just like, all right, well you know, I would first he's coming to town, I got to get some Johnny blue, I got to get the NBA package so he can watch his Nixon. I just got into the Celtics. So I've been watching him since uh, December of 2015. And my first thought when I was watching him, I was like, where are we going to go with this game plan where we have this superstar point guard, we live and die by the three and we don't get any fucking rebound. So like I don't understand how you can win.

Speaker 2:          38:34          Yeah. Anything

Speaker 1:          38:36          playing basketball like that. But then here's what happened. They did and they just kept winning and everybody else, it just became socially acceptable on the hard court to fucking run down the court with the ball. Three people. Right.

Speaker 3:          38:53          Okay.

Speaker 1:          38:54          From the other team onto the net. Nobody on your team or maybe one guy. It was totally acceptable to say, I'm not waiting for my other teammates and I'm just going to launch a fucking three, you know, and we're up by one with like fucking eight minutes to go like, what are you doing? But that just, you know, the same way after Jordan, people were just like, well, I guess we don't need to feed it to a big man. Do we even need a big man, Randy? [inaudible]. So I was like, all right, I guess this is the new game. So we ended up not only doing great this year once we added Al Horford. Yeah, we fucking got the number one seed. And at that point I completely forgot about my initial reaction to the way that, that they were playing. And I was like, all right, I guess, yeah. With a number one seed, we get an eight seat. All right. And after the first two games, it's like a, you know, it seems like the opposite. Seems like they're the number one seat and where the eight seat and I kind of knew we were in trouble.

Speaker 3:          39:53          Uh,

Speaker 1:          39:56          I guess, well when Charles Barkley just basically broke our team down after the first half or the first game going, yeah, you just basically you double team Isaiah tried to make a beat the double and then if these guys don't hit their threes, you know, they're not getting any fuck. I don't know what the hell he said, but it's just like, all right, this guy's already figured this out. Basically what I'm saying is, um, I think this is the first real test for Brad Stevens, this next game where he has to make a drastic adjustment with the players that he has because they figured this out before the opening tip off and that has led to two losses and we have not been able to make any adjustment. And, um, what's fascinating about the bowls is even though that they're an eighth seed, they got Rondo and they got Dwayne Wade and Rondo's got a ring and I think Dwayne Wade, he's got what?

Speaker 1:          40:45          Three rings, four rings, he won, one was shack and then two with Lebron. Lebron, I can't remember, I'm not a big NBA guy. He's got at least three weeks. So there's four rings right there. Those guys have been through it numerous times. So they're not afraid of the ebbs and flows of the game. They're not afraid of playing on the road. They're just totally chill. And I think that affects the rest of the team. And then he got Butler and Lopez who have just fucking animals just hitting, you know, 12 foot jumpshot's 15 footers while getting all these rebounds. And then that fucking white dude from Europe Vladi devakt junior d voc jr he's fucking started hitting threes. And um,

Speaker 3:          41:31          okay.

Speaker 1:          41:32          You know, we're getting asses kicked, so

Speaker 3:          41:34          I'll see what happens. And you know, but uh,

Speaker 1:          41:40          Jesus Christ, I mean, we were down three to one in hockey and went down, oh to going out to Chicago. So I'm hoping I'm

Speaker 3:          41:49          okay.

Speaker 1:          41:50          I'm hoping. Yeah. Jesus. So we don't get fucking swept. I mean,

Speaker 1:          41:54          I dunno. Brutal, brutal, brutal. But you know, what are you gonna do it? And it's just a fucking game. I realized that if the first one when I'm watching, you know, Isaiah Thomas crying about losing this sift, it was a really a brutal week for that type of shit. Huh? An Aaron Hernandez hung himself. Man, that was fucking brutal. The whole thing was brutal. And then all those fucking jokes that people were making like, oh yeah, he got hung up. He's got an upper body injury to the fucking neck. Oh, all this dumb shit. Um, that, that shit to me is always weird. Where are you going to sell that guy's a murderer. He's a fucking piece of shit. And uh, and then everybody acts like a fucking animal when he kills himself.

Speaker 3:          42:36          MMM.

Speaker 1:          42:38          Of course there's people out there that don't, that think, you know, something else happened. It's like, all right, you got just got acquitted on those other two murders and then you had a good chance for an appeal. You know, you had some hope. Um, but I dunno who the fuck knows. I don't know what the fuck happened. I don't necessarily agree with that or disagree. I have no fucking idea. But I do know was I think if any sort of a fucking human being, the whole thing was just sad. It's just like, you know,

Speaker 1:          43:07          it's just all these lives just fucking thrown away over nothing. Granted, you know, obviously he pulled the fucking trigger and everything like that, but still, I don't take any sort of a, I don't know. Honestly, I didn't get that. I was just like, ah. It was just, yeah, it's one of those things. He's just from front to back. You just wish it didn't happen. And everybody's like, oh, hey, here's my fucking obvious joke. Um, so anyway. Oh God. Am I really gonna be talking about fucking him killing himself? Is that how I'm going to end this podcast? How long has this podcast, Ben? 43 minutes. While you know what? I'm in overtime. All right, let's end up on something positive tonight. Of course I'm working tonight and this fucking band that I've been wanting to see cause it drummers, amazing. I don't have his name in front of me. I should have it, but I don't spend called Russian circles is playing.

Speaker 3:          44:00          MMM.

Speaker 1:          44:02          Is playing at the uh, oh for fuck sakes. What's the name of the fucking thing? Every goddamn theater begins with a p out here. Hang. I gotta hit pause. I got to make sure I have this information hung. Hang on the palladium. Fuck. Get ticket. Paramont the pompadour the fucking palladium actually that's where Richard Pryor, uh, tape, uh, live on the sunset strip. So I was introduced to this band. They played this song, Harper Louis Live and uh, their drummer absolutely fucking blew me away with his, um, just how solid

Speaker 1:          44:40          his is. His beats were, and then his use of dynamics. It's just on a whole other fucking level, which I really think is a lost art. Um, but they're playing tonight, um, since 6:30 PM. And, uh, I wish I could go, but I got a fucking God damn benefit so I can't make it. But I'll post that clip of the band playing that song. Harper Lewis. It's the live version and just the way, you know, it just starts off with the drum beat that he's playing and he's playing it, you know, it gradually builds in intensity, gets louder and louder. And then, uh, then when they go into that, I don't, it's an instrumental band. I don't know how to say versus chorus. I don't know what the fuck they're doing, but just absolutely blew me away. If you've got nothing to do tonight, you want to see a killer band, go down and get a couple of tickets to that. I guarantee you have a great time. Um, all right, that is the podcast. Um, Eh, I guess cause it's four 20, like weed man, I guess a, Andrew's going to be giving you guys some extra clips. It's going to be a little bit longer and a, and that is it. And it was an honor to be a Charlie Murphy's memorial service. It was an honor to know that guy. And I want to thank, uh, everybody who spoke that night. Last night though, the way that they sent that guy off, it was just like, it was

Speaker 2:          45:54          okay.

Speaker 1:          45:54          It just was a level of greatness in the performances that I saw from the comedians that went up and spoke. And, um,

Speaker 2:          46:02          okay.

Speaker 1:          46:02          Charlie was one of the greats, you know, and it was just, it was such a perfect sendoff and I'm really glad that I was able to be there and witness it. All right. So that's it. I'll, uh, you fucking cunts have a great weekend and, uh, enjoy this music and some, uh, some clips from a podcast recorded Monday or a Thursday gone by.
