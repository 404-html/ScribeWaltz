Speaker 1:          00:00:01       Hey, what's going on? It's Phil Burn. It's time for the Monday morning podcast for Monday, October 26, 2015 what's going on? How is everything good with you? Did she have a good weekend? Oh God bless you God. Play everything. Go with the family. All got pleasure. Um, I am in beautiful downtown Detroit, Michigan. Um, I know some of you probably laughed cause you fear all that fucking shit about Detroit. All Times fucking cities. Awesome. Um, can be scary. I'm not going to lie to you, but every time I come here it gets a little bit better. And um, you know, it's kind of a fucking exciting thing. You know, it's one of our great cities here, sits there right by the lake, right? Lake Erie, you know, beautiful Goddamn city. You know, I like when you go through Detroit is you always see a bunch of Cadillacs, Buicks. Even though those fucking cops left this place.

Speaker 1:          00:01:05       I swear to God, man, you know, I don't know who's at fault for that shit. If it really is just a corporate greed or if the unions became just such constant was it was cheaper. I always go with the corporate guys being assholes because you know, basically if you didn't have the unions, we'd have sweatshop labor in this country. Right? So then they just went on, but then the unions became, oh my God, the unions have horrible reputation, which is well earned, isn't it? Oh, it always starts out with a good idea, does it, you know, some theaters, I go to a union, some art, and sometimes the unions are cool and sometimes they're not. You know, fucking guy's just sitting there on a chair, you know? It's like, dude, why would you do that? Just go on the back and play cards. I'm sitting there looking, knowing that I'm fucking paying you. You're not doing anything. I Dunno. Look at me. I'm all over the map right now. Anyways, that's one of the worst fucking things we ever did was a,

Speaker 1:          00:02:09       I dunno, we allowed all of that fucking industry to lead this country. So fucking stupid. We should still be here making those cars right. And you can feel good about it. You know what I saw more goddamn Buick Regal [inaudible] he brought that car back, you know, and it looks fucking cool, right? Bewkes always had cool front grills, but you, yeah. You know, just grossly under powered. That'd be a great car to fucking to Redo. Just pull the whole fucking drive, train out and put a new suspension and it just, you know, have you self a fucking sweat. Right. Keep those granny looking fucking tires and rims. Um, just like that. What's that movie? What's that movie Ryan Gosling was in and he would pause 30 seconds to deliver his line. He had that, that Mona Lisa smile he always has. It was at Mona Lisa. It's much soda regard.

Speaker 1:          00:03:04       Right? I always started ricotta cheese. I guess we got, I'm learning all this shift from fucking Versie and Joe Barnick that to half Italian set or on the fucking bus listening to Italians talking about food is the one of the funniest fucking things ever. But then after about like 15 minutes, they, it's as annoying is, listen to this. Somebody who's talking about their kid that you don't give a fuck about. You know what I mean? Like, oh, you can't believe so then little joke, he came in raw 80 Edital slippers on. He was so cute. And I said, Joey t know what time it is? A said it was 14 o'clock. Hey, isn't that funny? That doesn't exist. You just got to sit there and be like, I don't give a shit about that little snot nose kid. Right. Then you get fucking Barnick and Barney.

Speaker 1:          00:03:54       Conversely, when we were in Pittsburgh and we played Heinz Hall, um, they went to some fucking Italian Deli in the morning and came back with all these cheeses and uh, they came back with this, uh, was a Kappa Cold Capicola Aka Gaba, Google, which was fucking unreal. I guess it comes from the, the neck of the pig. You would think that would be any good. They came back with spicy gobble, Google the, and um, it was finished. It was fucking amazing. But they wouldn't shut up. I guess it comes from the shoulder and the neck, I should say. They wouldn't shut up about it. They're going to bill. And then the core Dan Oho section, it was just cheeses. They pull whole load, Mozzarella, a Vogel fucking go and on and on at k and then we're standing in and then Joe, I pull out this piece of bread bill and I handed to Joe and he squeezes it and it, he nodded at me, dude.

Speaker 1:          00:04:58       It was like a mafia hit man. Talent. Somebody was going to get whacked. All right, and then you think it's over. And then we go over the US and they had all these all in day, it's spicy olives they had all is with garlic in it. And I was like, I'm getting the spicy one and a Joe's like, oh, I'm getting the fucking garlic and then and all these, why'd you like, all right, I get it. Jesus Christ. Fucking get it. I see it. It's right here. Try that. Try it to try it. Sharp provolone. Go ahead and take a piece of that and I'm not, I'll put it on a bread, put it on the bread, pull little Gabo go one day I'm fucking around it. It's actually hilarious. But they just wouldn't shut up about the place. And the food was unbelievably delicious. That fucking great. Okay. But you can understand, I'm German, Irish. All right. We just put shit in a pot. You boil it and then you think about either or, uh, eliminating a race of people. That's, that's, that's the family tree that I come from. Right? There's nothing about food.

Speaker 2:          00:06:07       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:06:10       It's probably just all jealousy, man. The fucking food was unreal. You know, it was funny. Versing made me a plate or on the bus ride and he makes me a plate and I can tell he's got his back to me and I can tell just the way he's laying it out. He's so fucking excited. He wants me to love it as much as he loves it. Right? So I fucking, uh, I, he gives to me, I started eating and it's fucking delicious. And I didn't realize he's waiting for me to say it's delicious cause I'm so busy eating because it's delicious. And then he just sort of like, just was looking at me. He goes, how is it to cook? And I just, I spit, take bursted out, fucking laughing. It's like, yeah, dude, it's delicious. He was like, I could good. Like he was almost like,

Speaker 2:          00:06:51       I don't know

Speaker 1:          00:06:52       why do it? Why don't we Italians give a fuck that much about food and every, everybody else doesn't. They pretend to nobody gives a fuck.

Speaker 2:          00:07:00       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:07:01       That's why they, food is so fucking, I believe it's the best food on the planet,

Speaker 2:          00:07:05       you know? Fucking it. Yeah. I,

Speaker 1:          00:07:10       you start to make a meal and it's an Italian person in the fucking room. If you start fucking it up, they'll get emotional. Like, oh no, what do what you did? No, no. You want to put the fucking here, but go was your job to do a uni? He just like, don't just, you just do it. You just get over here. You know what I mean? It'd be like if I started playing drums in a black guy, walked in a big, all right, do it hit here's a statute. You just do it. You just, I don't know why you're just better. So anyways, I never heard a capicola before. You know, I heard a cabbage,

Speaker 1:          00:07:45       you know, bratwursts and sausages and all of that fucking shit. You know, it's funny. As much as I love Italian food, I would love to, I'd love some fucking some German food right now. So krauts fucking giant God beer Stein dress like I'm going to walk out of a cuckoo clock. You know what I mean? You would think about Germany is, is we're never going to shake off that world war two shit. We're just never going to do it. You know what I mean? We went too hard. You know, it's over how you, there's no way. There's certain things that you do. There's no comeback from, I don't give a fuck how good a car you make. You know what I mean? I don't give a shit how good your beer is. I don't give a fuck how good the watches you make. You know what I mean?

Speaker 2:          00:10:35       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:10:36       Book imprisonment and hungry. All right, so there's a country.

Speaker 2:          00:10:41       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:10:41       They put that guy in jail. They didn't fucking impale him. Did you ever hear about like in PA I didn't pay it. I'm not going to go through. I'll go through a really quickly. They basically split you up your backside. Alright. Grease up a fucking stake.

Speaker 2:          00:10:57       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:10:57       And basically use your body weight to have it go in through the outdoor.

Speaker 1:          00:11:04       Sometimes it pay, eventually your body weight, their pairs that shoot through your gut. Sometimes it would come all the way up to the person's fucking mouth. Take like fucking, I dunno, 12 hours to days to die that way. And he used to do it all fucking time. He had like a whole fucking field of people there and he'd be sitting there eating some Gaba. Google with the vogue in gs and Musu rep. Um, no one knows where he is. Where's he from? Romania. You know, they were able to shake it off. Can you say, Hey, oh, I'm Romanian. What did they think? They think you're a gypsy stealing a fucking wallet in fucking Rome. That's, that's all they think. You know what I mean? You say you're German. Do they think about the bear? They think about the cars? No. So he's like, what do you a Nazi?

Speaker 1:          00:11:46       Uh, no I'm not. I'm not, I'm a drunk. I don't know how to make a car anyways. I don't know what I'm talking about here. Um, let's get back to Detroit. So I guess the owner of the Cavaliers Isam, shit, I probably should have got the guy's fucking name he bought like fucking, like, since like 70 buildings out here and he's giving major companies breaks, um, to come in here. I guess Google has some offices, Twitter or something like that and it's starting to build back up again now whether he did it for financial reasons or one, it's the most patriotic thing that's been going on here in a long fucking time. And um, and other cool things. When I went to Cleveland, Cleveland, like every time I go there, every two years it looks, it's making a major comeback. I was joking when I was on stage, they had like flowers going right down the center of the road and one of the roads that was unheard of 10 fucking years ago when I was out there, I told you I used to get an escort from the fuck and I don't meet a hula.

Speaker 1:          00:12:47       I had like a cop have to walk me over at the end of the night from the club over to the hotel to make sure I wouldn't get jumped. And hilarity was the only a, I was the only, you know, only show in town right there and now that whole fucking street, it looks like the Vegas Strip. And I'm telling you, everybody out there, if you make it some money, don't sleep on the so called rust belt. It's coming back. You could make you fortune there.

Speaker 3:          00:13:15       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:13:17       It'd be cool if there was a way to fucking do it and not displace the people that already lived there. You know, if he could somehow by a fucking building, fixed the fucking thing up and then help out the people that were in it. But it never works out that way. It does it, it's gotta be a way to do it. Right. If you're dead it yet, it ended up on Oprah. Right. And she'd say your name.

Speaker 3:          00:13:40       Uh,

Speaker 1:          00:13:44       I don't even want, I'm talking about here. So we've been rolling through here. Um, I am on a fucking bender. Alright. I every fucking show I go, I'm not drinking afterwards. And um, and then it just happened to me. I'm just, I have to break this fucking habit. It's heavy. You know what I got into on this trip, I got into light beer from mill. I was never a Miller lite guy. It fucking hated it. But they brought back the old school bottles that they used to have those short squat ones. And when I was coming back from the Notre Dame game, we had them in this fucking ice chest and they was so god damn cold, so fucking delicious. It just turned something on. Now I'm like craving it. Last night I was just like, all right guys, I just want to go home and I'm fucking right outside the Fox theater by the way, which is one of the top three theaters I think I've ever played in my life. Um, I probably say Carnegie Hall, Chicago Theater,

Speaker 1:          00:14:38       and the Fox Theater in Detroit. Uh, but the tabernacle and Atlanta is cool. There's so many cool ones. But this one was, um, you know, we got to the show a little bit late, so I didn't have time to go out and like look at it before the crowd came in. But when I came walking out with the lights down was reminded me of like Royal Albert halls, like fucking gigantic. It's one of the biggest places I ever played. And, uh, the crowd was amazing and afterwards we embark nick, we're hanging out in the lobby part in excel and a CD and I was taking some pictures and shit talking to the people down there. And um, so, you know, we were all talking about how we're going to be good boys. We're not going to go out and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. Then, you know, I get very easy, low key starts fucking laughing and next thing you know, you know bad around the place.

Speaker 1:          00:15:25       They had a place to get tacos and they had another place to get fucking, uh, drinks and shit. But I was like, no, no, no man, let's get in the car. Let's just go back to the fucking hotel. All right. They a little hotel bar. They ever get one quick one, we'll watch the end of the panthers fucking eagles game. We'll go to bed, we'll call it a night. He said, then we show up, we sit down at the bar, there's some guys sitting there and it looks like he just sat down in a four top, just left at the bar. Um, and I found out all of the drinks was hit were his, and he was a chef and he was trying every drink that this place had was sampling them or something. This guy Manny. So next thing you know, we start doing what he's doing and uh, Eh, it was stupid. I just remember verse, he would, you know, you don't mix liquor, right? And we're doing it just because we'll laugh and cause we know it's stupid. And I remember we'd drag this fucking, it's coffee flavored Tequila and as versus bringing it up to his lips, he goes off, I'm definitely puke it tonight. And then he just throws it down.

Speaker 1:          00:16:27       So the weird thing was I was so many different kinds of liquors in me head, a Moscow mule. I had some patrol, I had some like this fucking that coffee flavor patroned I had one light beer from Miller then add this other shit that had like an orange in it with bourbon in it. And the funny thing was is I didn't even feel drunk and I'm going to VRC like, I think this shit's water down. He goes, yeah, it's a good point. I don't really feel drunk either. And then I went upstairs and got on facetime and I got into a big fight with my wife and I woke up this morning and I was like, yeah, I guess that was drunk. I was just being mean for no reason. And I'm not a mean drunk, I'm a happy drunk. But when you fucking, you know, cross pollinate and all of those things, I was, I was, I wasn't mean.

Speaker 1:          00:17:14       I was, I was surly. She was like, you, you went drinking. I was like, no, it's painted asshole. You know, it's funny, she's such a sweetheart. She hung up on me and she apologized to me so I got to wait til she wakes up cause I'm still on east coast time and I'm going to fuck, I'm going to apologize to her. I'm sorry honey. I'm sorry. So sorry that I drank 50 different kinds of booze and then I called you and I was a red cunt. Can you ever forgive me lady? Um, hey, just laid it all you guys know. Uh, I have still have some leftover posters from that tour that I did up the northwest, the tour where I got the inner tube standing in the dry river bed. That one.

Speaker 1:          00:25:40       So that's going to get me through the rest of the tour. But when I get to Chicago, I'm going to get my, uh, my laundry done again is I hate having a dirty laundry in my fucking luggage. It's just fucking gross, you know, and you just pay somebody else to do it. Don't be a cheap content. All right. I went down there, it was minute, it was a dollar 50 a pound minimum 10 pound thing, and I went down. They would just my fucking me undies, me undies and Mike, one of the fucking socks. Right? That's all I brought down there, right? Because they're going to dry everything on high, you know, they get dry. Everything on high c can't give him anything that's going to fucking shrink. So you don't give a fuck about you underway. Sucks. So I'm just bringing that shit down there.

Speaker 1:          00:26:22       I mean, it probably weighed two pounds and they still charged me $12 and 50 cents to do it. And you know what? I don't give a fuck. I would have given him 20 bucks to do, to pay another person to do your laundry. I mean, Jesus, Craig, you're living like a king. They got it all folded, you know, washed my compression socks. I wear compression socks now. It's really helping us. I'm getting this fucking varicose vein treated in my left leg. It's really helping it out. The Guy told me to get them. It's like, dude, I'm not wearing those fucking socks. I might as well get soc guard is at that point. It's basically like the Allen Iverson sleeve that he wore for the last three quarters of his career, except it's on your legs. Um, and it feels weird at first, but I got to admit on a cold day, it's kind of Nice to have socks that go up to your kneecaps, but when you put them on and you're standing in your underwear and you've got them on, like last night I had the old man once, like I went to a, I bought some from Nike that were actually that kind of Nice, but I bought the old man of ones from the fucking, like the rite aid of the fucking cvs and they'd just jet black and they went up to my knees and I was standing there and my fucking underwear and I just burst out laughing.

Speaker 1:          00:27:34       I look like dead fucking 50 year old married white guide that gets busted, you know, get an thinks he's getting no hooker and it's some undercover cop. And then I just start crying.

Speaker 4:          00:27:46       Well, I thought it was always just trying to talk to her poop,

Speaker 1:          00:27:49       right. Being that guy. Um, by the way, I apologize for putting that image in your head, but it was just too fucking funny not to share it with you.

Speaker 3:          00:27:59       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:28:01       So anyway, so I went on a nice walk this morning. Uh, it was a nice mile and a half walk there and back. And then I did it again this morning. And, um,

Speaker 1:          00:28:11       you know, it's cool. It's cool to be in downtown Detroit and as people come in and work down here, excuse me, hiccups here, uh, people coming down to work. Uh, it's great to see Cleveland comment back and all this. I swear to God, man, I've got to buy something out here. I think it's a smart move and it's really a, I think it's a patriotic thing to do, to invest in a fucking city. That was the shit and it should be the shit to try. It should be the shit. It really should. Cleveland should be the shit, all of these fucking places. So, uh, he can bama be the like, don't wanna beat the real estate agent for these fees. Fucking cities and a, and I won't take a commission. How about that? Yeah, you can buy something for nothing,

Speaker 3:          00:28:51       you know,

Speaker 1:          00:28:53       and he can help his fucking place come back. I mean, I don't know. You figure, you know, you start buying up buildings and then they legalize weed, right? And then somebody buys the old Packard fucking factory and he just start making weed in there. There you go. That's the fucking move. You come back to Detroit and all those, you know, grandsons and granddaughters of the great auto workers in this country, right? They go back to work in the same factory, except you're growing weed. Come on, man. That's like that Michael Keaton movie from way back in the day, except you got weed in it, right? I Dunno. There, these are just ideas. I'm just throwing it out there. All right, let's talk some sports here. Let's stock some sports and we'll start with the greatest fucking sport that's ever been created. Nhl Hockey, God damn motherfucking cock sucking Frenchie sons of bitches.

Speaker 1:          00:29:45       The fucking, I can't even shit on him at this point. The God Canadians are nine and eight. Oh nine, eight. Oh have won 18 out of a possible 18 points. And for the longest time nobody in the east look like they could fuck with anybody in the west. And uh, I dunno, it's looked at me. Well, the best record out in, uh, out in the West, who do we got? Los Angeles is, is five and three after a slow stat, the turn it it on Nashville. Six and one Dallas thousands looking good. Huh? Six and two when a pig, you know what it is. So they have, don't have a tough guy. I don't know if that's because we got rid of Lou Cheech or whatever. From what I heard, I was talking to a Canadiens fan last night. Actually, Ted took a picture with them too, you know, she's like, and I actually made his, his girlfriend or wife standing between us because it's too, I can't put my arm around you with that fucking shirt on.

Speaker 1:          00:30:42       Um, but he was saying that, uh, they, they don't have, they don't have a tough guy anymore. And, um, so I dunno, I think that might come back to haunt you if he, if he ended up playing whoever the fuck makes it to the finals out there. Right. Kings a tough Winnipeg's tough Chicago. You never fuck with the Blackhawks, right? I Dunno who the fuck knows. But anyways, congratulations to those cons. I mean, you gotta you gotta you gotta give respect to that night and it was fucking insane. But the Bruins playing in on, right? They're doing all right. Three one and one that's a winning record. I think the, uh, the tie there, we fucking blew it against the filthy flyers. And then we came back and we beat the islanders. You know, Craig, he's having a fucking career year that he's leading the Leed points.

Speaker 1:          00:31:29       I don't know. I'm psych and um, you always can be great. When I get back, even at the games that we lose, I don't give a shit. And we have all these games on my DVR. I'm going to sit down and watch all of them. I get to watch a game at night, you know, sometimes two games at the Bruins, half a game and I'm gonna get all fucking caught up. Um, and the NFL yesterday to Patriots beat the jets. Um, I got to tell you man, jets were getting 11 points. I loved that fucking, I love that fucking bet. The jets getting 11. Um, I was actually thinking that we could possibly lose to them just because we add, we have no fucking offensive line and they got a great defense, you know, Reavis is going to shut down his whole fucking part of the fields.

Speaker 1:          00:32:12       And um, what did we ended up winning by? We ended up winning by seven points, but uh, Edelman dropped that pass. Then he always go for the new drug to appear as, and we build a blue. Yeah. But if he caught it, maybe they would've done something different. You never know. So, uh, you know, we beat the green cons. They're not the green cards anymore cause rex Ryan isn't there. But uh, I got to admit, it's um, kind of, uh, this is the German in me. Was it going to shine? Freud? Is that what they call it? Taking pleasure out of somebody else's suffering. Seeing the bills struggling. Not because I don't like the bills just because rex Ryan talks all these shit about what he's going to do to the Patriots. It's kind of fun to see the jets be equality squad with the class act for a coach, you know?

Speaker 1:          00:32:58       And to watch him fucking lose into Jacksonville all the way over there in England. Fucking great. But the sunbelt rex, I still love the guy. I'm feeling bad for me. It looks like he's putting on weight again. I think he's stressing, you know, talked to all that shit. There's always people talking shit. There was somebody on the jets talk shit. But what? They were going to come up and due to the Patriots and saying, why would you do that? Why would you give them extra motivation to help people continue to fucking talk shit. You know what I mean? We know you think you're going to, when we know you're going up there to win and we know you're not scared, you just don't say it. You're dope. We go up to, we go, we'll go blue blue. We go there. Yeah, it's how you're going.

Speaker 1:          00:33:36       You're gonna go up there and play football. How about the dolphins? Jesus Christ. Talk about making your former coach look like a fucking jerk off they came in there and absolutely raped the fucking Texas. You know, where they went like fucking 97 to two. Where is it is you can tell I was on a bus. They barely saw anything. I watched, I watched the Dallas game and I, uh, and I watched the Patriots. That's all I saw. And I also saw the end of the panthers. It's pissing me off that I keep missing, uh, the panthers play because I feel like I'm missing a, the emergence of the next great quarterback in the league. And for the life of me, I can't remember his name, but he has those Michael Jordan years where they're really tiny, but they looked like the top just staple to the side of his head. And he's also one of those guys that he yells a lot, you know, he walks up to the camera and for some reason

Speaker 5:          00:34:30       it goes, ah,

Speaker 1:          00:34:32       which is really gonna. It's gonna be difficult for me to enjoy. What should I just, that's the generation gap. I for the life of me, I don't fucking understand that Johnny Unitas through for 41,000 yards in the fifties and sixties. Keep he beat out the next guy, but like 15,000 fucking yards. I don't think there's any footage of him throwing a touchdown pass and walking up to a camera with this flat top.

Speaker 5:          00:34:55       Ah, that's

Speaker 1:          00:34:57       back when you could fucking hit the quarterback until the end of the play. You can keep hitting the guy maybe. And if he ever did that, it was because he was screaming in pain. I was kidding who? I'm an old fucking white guy. What do you want from me? And I want the game to be the way it used to be. We established the running game and then you throw the ball. Um, but anyways, um, the fuck did I want to talk about there was something, I'm all over the map because I'm stressing because I got to finish this fucking thing and hopefully this internet won't suck and I can try and upload it here. Um, so I figured the next thing of course people were going to play in our division will be the dolphins and I imagine one of them is going to talk shit about how, um, you know, they don't think the Patriots are as good as it used to be.

Speaker 1:          00:35:44       The fucking sick of is too sick of that. Did that, did that. Uh, all I know is a patriots on a collision course with the New York football giants to be undefeated. And I said Diversey last night and my drunken stupor, I go, can you do me a favor? Can you just have the giants beat us during the regular season this year and not in a, not in fucking the, not the Superbowl. I Dunno. I'm really praying for the packages should to knock off the fucking giants cause I do not want to see them again. Uh, I don't, I'm good. I'm fine with just losing to them twice. I'm, I'm good with that. Rather than rolling the dice and risking losing a third time. Um, even though it'd be great to come and beat him, you know, and this is why I don't play professional football because even as a fan, I'm a little fucking girl.

Speaker 1:          00:36:33       I don't want to see them again. They always win. Um, but what was I gonna say? The, uh, you know, Odell Beckham that they got and then they got the fucking guy, just a salsa dance. He's coming back. That guy's coming back. Then again, it's going to be a fucking nightmare. Fucking nightmare. Um, hopefully we get healthy or offensive line gets healthy, but uh, who knows who the fuck knows what's going to happen. But, uh, anyways, let me get to some of the reeds here for this week. Um, all right. Who versus home? People always try to explain this to me and I'll never get you. I'll never get it. All right, Bill, I have the solution to your who versus whom dilemma that will solve the issue for the rest of your life. Okay, IOP. Now one of those snake oil salesman. I feel like I'm in your tent right now. You're starting to religion. You know when you're fucking putting your hand on my forehead. Exercise and the demons. Um, if the statement could be answer, if the statement could answer, answer the question with him or her, then use whom? Whom did you say that too?

Speaker 1:          00:37:47       I sent it to him. I said it to her. Not he or she. So it's home example to who told you that? He told me that. She told me that no fucking way. It's sad that studies. He who told you that? She did. Whom did you say to a certain, wait a minute. So now using it as wait. So if I, to whom do I owe this pleasure too? Yo tell him children's home. Who fucking did it? He did it. Jesus Christ. It was that easy. What the fuck were you 40 years ago when I needed you? Maybe I could have passed the class. Got To Notre Dame become a lawyer. I hope that made sense. It totally makes sense. I just hope I can remember it. You know what? I'm actually going to take a picture of that in my phone. Speaking of which the phone starts ringing.

Speaker 6:          00:38:48       Hang on.

Speaker 1:          00:38:51       Oh Shit. Hold on. Hold on. Huh? Hello? I thought it said 11.

Speaker 2:          00:39:02       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:39:05       It's, it's, it's, it's Paul and Joe down there already.

Speaker 2:          00:39:09       No.

Speaker 1:          00:39:10       All right, well I'm finishing up my podcast. I'll be down there 11. Sorry about that.

Speaker 2:          00:39:15       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:39:16       All right buddy. See you a fucked up. I thought I said 11 o'clock. That was the bus driver going, just checking. We did say it's fucking hilarious. 10, 10 because we've always been on time, so he knew. Um, so anyways, um,

Speaker 2:          00:39:35       yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:39:36       Goddamn it, you fixed it. You fuck, I got to take a picture of that. Whom did you say that to? Who told you that? That's all I have to remember.

Speaker 2:          00:39:48       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:39:49       I wish it was more fucking sentences and then, you know, you gave me 10 of them and then I had to try to guess. All right, good fellas. Dean explained. Oh my God, I feel fucking smart. You know what to think about whom is you can't use it without looking like a Douche. The only time you can use whom as if you write something. The funny thing is if you, if you use whom, you know what I mean? You sound like those, uh, you know when he stepped on the bull, those guys from fucking trading places. Um, but if you're, if you're writing a, you know, an email or sorry, even tweets, something people would call you out on it because if you don't use it then, then you look like a Douche. So I think that's the other rule, you know what I mean? Like, Hey, who would you say that too? You can't be in a bar and be like, hey, whom did you say that too? I said to him, you fucking dose. Right? You can't do that, but you're right, it down everybody, you know, everybody sees it. You know, they just break your balls. So there's another roof. All right. A good fellas seen explained that. Okay. Last week I thought that the reason why, um, Joe pashing the end

Speaker 1:          00:41:00       Scorsese just brings back a Tommy's character and he just pointed the gun at the camera and start shooting was because that was Tommy from beyond the grave shooting fucking, uh, Henry because he was a rat and ratted everybody out. Um, so somebody said, Goodfellows x, that was my theory. Good fellas seen, explained, hey bill, you mentioned in your recent Thursday morning podcast your theory on why we see Joe [inaudible], Joe [inaudible], Joe [inaudible] fire a pistol. Fucking brain is three fucking words ahead of my mouth at the screen at the end of Goodfellas, it's actually an old modge or a homage if you're in a bar, uh, to the 1906 black and white film as opposed to the color films back there. The great train robbery. It was the first film with a narrative storyline and at the end there is a shot of a cowboy looking at the camera who fires his pistol at the screen, just like in Goodfellas.

Speaker 1:          00:42:00       I actually watched the clip. It's pretty fucking cool. It was very jarring to the film audiences who had never seen anything like that. And in many cases, movie goers would duck or a shout thinking they were actually being shot at. It's not fucking hilarious because everybody had a sad iron back then. Um, just a little film history from a film nerd to you, the funniest read to you, the funniest redhead and the plan and keep up the good work and go fuck yourself. Here's the movie. All right. I will definitely post that. Uh, that, uh, that clip. All right, election bill. You've been pretty quiet about the election. Seems like, uh, they got their start early this year and people are going to be tired out by February. If you had to vote today, do you know who you'd vote for a also, is there anyone less stable looking than Hillary Clinton? She can't be getting any good sleep. Love you and your wife. Thanks for, for the weekly laughs. Uh, I thought Hillary crushed it on that stupid inquiry. You know, I didn't understand what the fucking problem was. She admitted that had happened on her watch and she took full responsibility for it. So like what was the fucking problem?

Speaker 3:          00:43:13       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:43:14       You know, that seemed like a, you know, deflate gate type shit. I mean, honestly, what, what are you supposed to do to stop a terrorist attack? I have, they've said that forever. Like even the secret service says, you know, if somebody doesn't give a shit about dying, the only thing that they can share is instantaneous death. After you do whatever the fuck you're going to attempt to do. You know what I mean? Once you take out the fucking, I don't give a shit whether I live that this, you know,

Speaker 3:          00:43:44       it's over.

Speaker 1:          00:43:46       So I mean, what are we going to do? You know, was an away game. It's fucking horrific that it happened, but I'm out. You know, she should have done this. She should have done that. The same people say, and that Saint George Bush kept us safe after nine 11 but they don't bring up the fact that nine 11 happened. What? He was fucking president. Right? The same people breaking fucking Hillary's ovaries are fucking rub. And George Bush has balls and then vice versa, the same people, Finger Bang and Hillary of fucking twisted up. What's his face? His nuts. Rather than giving them a pair of me undies, what he's supposed to do when somebody doesn't give a fuck,

Speaker 3:          00:44:22       you know,

Speaker 1:          00:44:24       what are you going to call you up and tell you what they're going to do?

Speaker 3:          00:44:27       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:44:28       You know, I don't know. By the way, we met a, a professional pilot commercial pilot, by the way. Um,

Speaker 1:          00:44:37       and uh, he knew some of the people on those flights, you know, some of the pilots and that type of shit. So all these fucking people that are trying to say that it didn't happen, that they were actually fucking these missiles or something like that that was shot in there. I mean, um, I dunno. And that's coming from me. He was a fucking conspiracy theory. Sorry. GAVISCON everybody. Hey there. Bilderberg just checking in on you from fucking Southie kid. Uh, I listened to your podcast almost every day in the sea of cubicles. I work in a, you are the fucking mouth. Thank you. I appreciate it. I also saw your comics come home, but Boba last year and there were a bunch of constant front of me who are getting offended at the things you were saying and it made it funnier for me and my girlfriend anyways.

Speaker 1:          00:45:23       Oh, I remember that. That one was a little bit of a rough one, you know. Anyways, I just came across Dan Carlin's hardcore history podcast and the first one that is free on iTunes is the wrath of Khan series on Gangas con and the Mongol Empire during the Middle Ages. This dude was one of the greatest men and conquerors who ever lived and his story is incredible. The fear and loyalty this man instilled in people of his day is unparalleled. Although he's responsible for 20 to 80 million deaths. He completely changed the world and built the largest empire the world had ever seen. And I thought you might be interested in it because you've talked about other great men who have lived in the past. Arnold Schwartzenegger thanks for a great show and go fuck yourself. Yeah, see there's another one. You don't even know what it is. There's no footage on like Vladi the fucking impaler and fucking, uh, the g man, they're fucking gang his card. So you know,

Speaker 1:          00:46:27       nobody got where you are fucking, you know, get that. What do you and not seek think, you know, I gotta check that out. I gotta I gotta listen to that. I gotta be in the mood to listen to a fucking podcast. Like I love being on podcasts, I love doing them, but, um, I just, uh, my brain is, I can't handle just sitting still. That lock, I guess I could have it on in the background is I was doing something else maybe cleaning up or freshening up before a show. Um, all right. My roommate is a pervert. Okay, here we go. Uh, but let's go back to yet, do you realize the work it is to kill 20 to 80 million people? I mean, you could do it today with just a push of a button, but back then, I mean you've, that's like before they had like the fucking lawnmowers with the engines in. I mean, you had to push the fucking thing. You Self, do you know what? I'm so old that we actually had one of those when I was a kid.

Speaker 2:          00:47:23       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:47:23       Was the fucking worst. And if it was to gift of grass was too long, he just, I just didn't have the strength to do it. So you'd push it forward and then had to go back and you had to get like a running start, you know?

Speaker 2:          00:47:38       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:47:39       Oh it was a mess of so hard to keep it fucking straight. That's basically like if you had to look up a push mower that, that didn't have an edge in, in it, I would think that you'd have to like be cutting it every day. Like George Michael did with his beard and then it'd be like nice and easy. Right. But she went on like a bender, you know? Oh you went away to some place that they used to vacation back in the day like Sarasota, Florida or myrtle beach or some of the classic ones that they used to go to way back in the day. Reno, you know those old school places, Palm Springs,

Speaker 1:          00:48:19       you know when you came back you fucking lawn was through the God damn. Well, I guess you do it the wintertime, right? All I'm saying is that you were out there all the time. That's probably why a lot of people weren't as fucking fat. Although you know what the big thing was back in the day, everybody was scared about was just having a heart attack because they couldn't do any of those fucking, I'm gonna send rhinoplasty, which of course is your nose gets getting a nose job. Do you know there's something called rhinorrhea. I learned that by ringing about heroin junkies and shit like that. That uh, oh, of raw ryo Rhea. See if I can look it up. I know you guys think I'm full of Shit. It's like diarrhea of the nose. It's just fucking when you, uh, one of the symptoms when you're quitting cold Turkey,

Speaker 1:          00:49:04       Rhino, see I spelled diary Da da Da. A r. R. H. E a, something like that. Oh, there it is. Brian or Maria rhinorrhea. Rhinorrhea is a condition where the nasal cavity is filled with a significant amount of mucus, mucus, fluid. That condition commonly known as a runny nose occurs relatively frequently. Rhinorrhea is a common symptoms of allergies or certain diseases such as the common cold or Hay fever. Oh, I thought that test when you were a, I thought you, I thought you said you were all right. Spider. Um, I thought, I can't even say it because I've done it so many times. I always started imitating fucking spider. I thought that rhinorrhea was an next level runny nose that you got when you were kicking heroin. Um, I've kind of got interested in all that, like the whole heroin epidemic that's going on here in this country. Oh, by the way, I keep forgetting to bring up to how great the Indianapolis Gig was.

Speaker 1:          00:50:05       First of all, I got to come back and play this theater. Um, do you remember that story I told you guys and I put the video up where, uh, I was playing a theater upstairs and downstairs. Was that totally Elmo show? Whatever the fuck it was, keeping up with the muppets, whatever the fuck, I don't want to come. You know? Um, and when I walked the door of to the backstage of their theater was open and like all, like the count was sitting there and Bert was there an Oscar the grouch, like these actors in these suits and they were just chilling out, you know, and they look tired from doing a bunch of shows. So it was hilarious. So I filmed them and all of a sudden Bert got up and came walking over and was waving his hands. I thought he was saying, what's up my God, look at birthdays coming up here.
