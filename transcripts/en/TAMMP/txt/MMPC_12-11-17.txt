No porn. No boots. Why no nothing. Because I think it fucks you up. It does. It does. I, if I didn't have to, if I didn't get up so late and had to be here at one, I would have jerked up before I came here. But I realized I didn't have enough time to get into it in the way I want it to. Jesus, what are you fucking become a character or something? I'll watch that flare documentary was talking about and the guy asked him, how many times a day do you jerk off?

Speaker 2:          00:01:36       He goes twice. I was like, that's about what I do. Rick Flair said that? Yeah. You saw the documentary you told? I don't remember that part. Yeah, he's went to a sports psychologist and the guy was like, so how many times a day you drink off? He goes twice a, how much do you drink? He goes, I have 10 beers and and five of Buckos. That part I remembered it. Yeah. Well he said that before. He said to a jerking off stuff before that. Oh okay. He goes everyday everyday. How long you been doing that? Oh it was nice. Me Too. I started in 72 boom. Going back about 20 years.

Speaker 2:          00:02:08       That's impossible. He said it's been a week with me. Yeah. I liked when they said they were like your first wife, how long you faithful to her and he was like, Eh, about a day. And they go, really? Cause I couldn't do it. Couldn't do it. I came home and he goes, I was bored. I just want like to see a guy. It was great to actually just say how fucking board he is being married. Cause you know anytime you have a thought of just any sort of like resentment of your situation that you fucking created. Right, exactly. I'd have to say I do. You didn't have to do all that, but you created it. You have that, that feeling of like, fuck I want to do this. You have like that guilt. I loved his complete lack of guilt or honesty. Honesty. Yeah. Honesty. Well, why don't, why don't you tell the girls, why do you say scream at your hotel?

Speaker 2:          00:02:51       Eh, no. Why don't you wear your ring and uh, you know, no one ever comes to the old tale. Hey, y'all come to the hotel. I like that one when he was in the middle of nowhere and there was no party when he went back to the hotel he created when he just created one spot, like a hundred kamikaze. He's dancing on the bar. It's just like, whew. Yeah. Told you. Just blew out my fucking years. Jesus. Let me turn this down here. I'm speaking of woe flare impression. Yeah, man, you got to go. There you go. Speaking of honesty, tell me about Shira. You're special. And I also like how you're doing it. Like you're a, you basically went where all the specials end up anyways. And so he just bypassed all the networks. It's just like someone's going to steal this and rip it in any ways.

Speaker 2:          00:03:34       So whatever the kids say. Um, what did you just shot it yourself? No, it's a bill for the fifth time was the album, what is it? Oh, it's an album. Oh, it's a CD. Yeah. Well it's not a CD. It's just digital I guess. And I have drop cars. Did I sell it after my shows and stuff? Oh, all right. Yeah. Sorry man. I don't do a lot of interviews and I'm not a good listener. There we go, Bill, for the last time. I'm here about a benefit when just special come out. I just assume it's a comedian. It's gotta be a special film. Good at Gotham comedy club. Uh, Memorial Day weekend. Well, how do you film an album? Well, right. I recorded it at Gotham comedy club one more day weekend, and I'm, it's on all the little media platforms. All right. 45 minute album.

Speaker 2:          00:04:21       I have to ask you the white guy question here. You're wearing a Phillies hat. All right. Now I've learned this with black people. That doesn't mean you're a fan. Do you have on Maroon sneakers or do you really like the Phillies? I just liked the hat. Oh, he just liked the hat. I Buy, I'm a Toronto Blue Jays Fan. You might see me wearing a few different Toronto Blue Jays ads. And you have a baseball background, correct? Yes. Chicago cubs. That's right. You were right fielder, I believe in the 56 round, which they don't have that round anymore. You would draft in the 56 round in the scouting report on you as you could go deep, but you couldn't hit a curve ball. Yes. So what did you do to try to work on, other than just guessing, what did you do when you stepped up to plate to try to get, because there's no fucking way I could ever hit a curb.

Speaker 2:          00:05:02       I was always hunting a fastball, which is probably not a great, well that's what a lot of hitters do equal to adjust. But I just, I think it was mental. I though, wow, I wish, I wish I knew about sports psychology when I was playing. I would have went to one because it was totally mental. You had a mental, like Charles Barkley's golf swing where you guys to stop and then like Jon Lester who can't throw to first base, but he could throw a pinpoint fastball and inside corner to a hitter, but he can't throw it to first base with those somebody up. Yeah. He will not throw. It can throw. You ever say, I'll just take, take, take fucking throw. Like, like I dunno what like a God damn gorilla on the lounge and the second they got to throw it, they throw like a little girl like, oh right. Are you all know if you remember chuck Knoblauch he played for, he was a gold glove second basement. All of a sudden he couldn't catch anything and we couldn't throw, you couldn't throw. What's the yeah, he threw it. He threw it was like hitting people fifth row. Yeah. Steve Sax was the first guy. Was that the guy? Yeah, the Yips. Yeah. It's what they call it mental. Because you was doing

Speaker 3:          00:05:58       it your whole life until now. So did you ever hit the curve ball hit a few curve balls. Bad ones. The ones that don't break that much. Oh, okay. But a good one. And too many people get a good one anyway. You're not going to hit if it, Clayton Kershaw puts a good one on that. You're not touching it. What's, uh, anybody you ever go up against made it in the big leagues? Yeah. Lando Hudson. Um, he used to, he used the only show against him. Well, he didn't, he didn't? No, he didn't pitch. He was a player. Oh, okay. Yeah, he was playing night. Jacob Shumake uh, he got drafted first round by the Toronto by Atlanta Braves. And um, he didn't make it, he got to $500,000 signing bonus. And um, so you did all that Bull Durham Shit riding around in buses and all that? No, I didn't make it that far.

Speaker 3:          00:06:40       I released extreme training. Wait, so when you get drafted by the cubs, they saw you at high school. Like, wait, what did he saw me in high school? And then they, uh, they actually can, scouts can actually get help. You get into schools, they call other schools and go, we liked this guy. Um, matter of fact, I got recruited by NC state from a scout. They call schools and they, hey, get this guy, we're going to look at them. And then you go to the school and then after your first season, they either pick you up or they, cause I was a drafting follows. It's just nonstop pressure. Yes. It's every time. So then it's already bad enough if you're in your head, if you're in a slump. Yes. Now it's just like, fuck, I'm not going to get picked up next year. My dream is going to die.

Speaker 3:          00:07:21       So all of these other kids that are walking around going to keg parties, going, mom, send more money and you're, and you're literally going, my dreams. Fucking dying. Right, right, exactly. It, most people don't. Most people that we don't know, baseball is extremely competitive and hard to play. That's why there's a minor leagues. There's no minor leagues for, but it is a little bit for football now, but that's not my, at least with basketball and football, he would just go right to the pros. But baseball, you need constant work from rookie ball or way to AAA. Rookie ball is not even able yet. Is that because it's the games that hard? It's really that hard yet. You mean you haven't tried? You ever seen a 97 mile an hour fast ball coming at you? I like those people that go down to the batting cages and they just sat it on 90 and they know what the pitches and they keep going.

Speaker 3:          00:08:02       Dude, I was hitting it. Just catching up with this. It's like, okay, yeah. All right. Now let's actually put a brain behind that fucking machine that has two other pitches. Exams. There's a million people watching. A fastball was actually easy to hit. It's the other stuff. Slider, curve ball. You don't know what's coming. Sometime it's if the you, he's what is what? What exactly is a slider? It's a [inaudible]. It's a Baltic slides to the left or slides to the right. That's it and yeah, that's not a curve ball. Curve ball drops off the curve ball drops off the table. Yeah. That's a slider. They call it 12 to six, where it really drops from 12 to six. A bad Kershaw has a 12 to six. Some people just have a little loop, but a slider is a, an a cutter is a fast ball that at the last minute darks to the left at which goes into your, uh, the handle part and you break your back. Like Marianna had greatest cutter and it was just like, can't they just guess and just going, I know he's coming with the cutter and just gasp because even

Speaker 2:          00:08:55       just little left out of the way. I met a guy one time who you got split second too to play

Speaker 1:          00:09:04       giants, any own fucking Tim Wakefield who was a knuckleball pitcher and he goes, I, this is a visual here. But basically he go like, well, basically his pitch did this and he would make all these crazy were with his hand and then go either went here or there, your knuckle ball is crazy. He would just guess he would go hide, I'm going to just swing here on this one or I'm going to swing there. And I'm ignoring all of this bullshit between me and him. And he actually was successful doing that. Yeah, I remember the Yankees won years, we're just looking at tape against Wakefield and they realized that most of his knuckle balls were balls. So they got well just don't fucking swing at it. And then he started getting behind in the count. I think that's when he had to like every once in a while throw like his idea of like a fast ball.

Speaker 1:          00:09:47       Right. But I always felt if I was going to get to the big leagues, like that's the way to, you know, if you could somehow develop a knuckle ball, cause then you're not going to blow out your arm. You can throw like 26 pitches like, you know, crazy like Johnson 60 19 hundreds. Yeah. What do you think? I know we're not, I love sports. Who gives a fuck? We know you're funny. Let's just, let's talk sports here. What if, what if, uh, what do you, how do you look at those early 19 hundreds you know, specials on that specialists, the fucking records that people and baseball. Yeah. Like when somebody, you know,

Speaker 2:          00:10:18       pitch 93 innings in two days, that'll never be broken. The Home Depot League is what I call it. Well, today's date is, uh, baseball is different because, uh, it's, the training is the proper preparation. Those guys, they just, they just, they just played like now did coddle the, uh, the players, the pitchers, like they only go six innings now. Really good. They're like veal. Yeah. Like back in the day they planned to go nine and right now he'd go, you go six in some five. I don't, that means your bullpen has to be very good. You know, if you don't have a great bullpen. I remember her talk over which, uh, which was, which is a blast for me and I hope they never do it. That just tried to, okay, you go three and as you go through, no, you let Clayton Kershaw our goal, as long as he can go.

Speaker 2:          00:11:03       And then you bring in the bullpen, you don't let them go three and then let your other guy go three, I guess. What do you coach any baseball when you're not doing stand up? No, no, I'm going to put my son in the league. Um, probably next summer. That's good. You're going to keep him out of football. Lacey, she didn't pick soccer. I mean I was, soccer is gradually taking over. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Sorry. No, you can't do, cause he said, you know what? She was basically saying the Joe Jackson, him in baseball. You're saying you're saying I want my son to be a flopper. That's basically I want it. I think you have to, you got to take like a drama class before you play soccer or whatever the fuck they call it. Overseas football. My favorite one ever is, you know, people say, you know, what do you call it football? Talking about American football. There's somebody, I forget what comedian said. This is like, well, why do you call it football? Why don't you call it feet ball, right. Using both feet. Right. You want to be a clever

Speaker 4:          00:11:54       because you're clever joke right back at Ya. Right, right. I actually would rather watch women's soccer than men's soccer with just because they just play, they don't do all that fucking flopping around and it's embarrassing. I would literally, if that was my son, I would walk out of the stadium. I would stand up all dramatic, like Glenn close in the natural. I'd have myself backlit. And so he saw me up in the stands and he'd be all excited that he drew a fucking yellow card and I would turn my back on him. That'd be it. That'd be the modern day version of that story where the guy bricked up the, the room that the kid was in. Oh yeah, that,

Speaker 3:          00:12:28       no, no. But I, I watch the ID channel Song. I mean, he, he, he locked his son. He bricked up his son.

Speaker 4:          00:12:34       His son was supposed to go to battle and he fucking chicken doubt. So the guys came there and they were like, yeah, you know, uh, your son, and you said that it was like the king or some shit. They go, your son who you said was brave, a fucking, you know, he chickened out. And he said, bullshit. No son of mine would do that. And they go, yeah, he's right in that room. He goes, I refuse to believe that and to demonstrate it, I will now have this room sealed off. And he started bricking the room up and he got all the way up to the last brick and then the pussy was on the other side. He went though, I don't want this and that. Oh, this happened. And to Honga Orange County or something. And uh, he goes brick it up now. It was that to put the last brick in. And that was at the dude done. They found skeletons with powder bunk to it. It wasn't. Now it's a, it's a fable. I wasn't a real Jesus. How crazy do you think white people are? Crap. [inaudible] think we are the, we can break our kids up in a famine worse. We actually have she, um, anyways, Jesus Christ. Let's get out of slavery. What else do you want to talk about the tree? So Neil benefits coming up.

Speaker 3:          00:13:38       Yes. Yes ma'am. Yeah. Um, I'm sorry about that. I'll always like seeing Georgia. Yeah. Yeah. I was actually spoke to her before I came here.

Speaker 4:          00:13:47       What's your favorite Patrice O'neil story that you had? You went on the road with him? He did Amsterdam,

Speaker 3:          00:13:51       man, man, we come back from Charlie goodnight's, Raleigh Durham. Oh yeah. And you guys five crackers is illegal in Boston, right? Fireworks. The fireworks go up to New Hampshire. Yeah. So Patricia, yeah, you're in a hurry to get back in New York. I go, uh, no, no, we'll sell it because I never really use fireworks. And I go, okay, well we stopped by, he spent like three with the fireworks and duty. Yes. He just, just put them all in one bag and just wrapping it up and he goes, oh, I want to, I want to set some of this off. So I go, yeah, I'm from dying. He was in North Carolina, I'm from here so we can just find one of these blue abandoned fields. So we did, but it was, uh, it was hot and the grass was dry. Oh, Jesus. We started a forest fire. Uh, no. Oh, we lit it up. We had just came back from eating. So Patrice had t he shouldn't have had to. Uh, and I had a big glass of water or tea and the fire getting bigger,

Speaker 2:          00:14:52       but before it got bigger, we tried to put it, stomp it out. So it was just two black dudes like ti would. I know we did that. We did the feet first. You both had new sneakers on. I sneakers were black. When we were done. He was trying to stop this fire out and then we went and grabbed the t and we both put our team on the fire that did nothing did. I said, let's get Outta here. You Go. No, no. We got to the ambulance came, fire truck came, the owner of the land came in 10 minutes. I'll Patrice you said, let's get out here. You're on the state. You were like, fuck this place in New York. Yeah, yeah. Let's get out here. What happened? They put it out, they put it out and that will really cool. Uh, Patrice was honest. It goes, let me do all the talking stupid.

Speaker 2:          00:15:31       And um, and when they got, when they got there, he's like, ah, I'm from Boston. I know pop firecrackers before. So we just started to be like, oh, it's okay man. Don't worry about it. I just, I just, uh, put some pesticide on this crops and everything is dry or whatever and they let us go. Wow. It took our statement. Let us go. There you go. Look at that. But we almost started a forest fire. That shit was going to cook. The field is here and the, uh, the forest was like maybe 10 feet from a five. Slide it off in a parking lot. There was no booze and was in North Carolina. There's a parking lot. Yeah, there is. I lived there. W will not will ruin it. We were like off the highway, off the beaten path in the rest area. Scare a couple of pedophiles out of the bathroom here. We didn't do that.

Speaker 2:          00:16:17       Let's put it in this fucking a pile of hay. Oh Dude. It was hilarious. Our feet were both, our shoes are black from trying to stomp fire report out to you on it. Where are you going? Where are you working these days? Um, everywhere, um, in the city. Um, I'm actually pretty busy in January. I'm going to Denver, Colorado, Dino. Which, and um, um, Dana headboards man, I haven't run into him in a minute. Yeah. Yeah. Um, and where were you guys playing it out there on the Improv? Was that I was like a funny bone to Denver. Comedy works? No, no, no. It's the Improv I think. Oh, the Improv. Okay. And then, um, after that, I am an um, Dan, where am I? I'm in Myrtle beach where I started at a comedy Cabana. How close is that to the forest fire? Myrtle beach. What forest fire as far as far as in South Carolina one that you fucking started two minutes ago.

Speaker 2:          00:17:09       Oh, I'm trying to do a call back here. That was on fucking help me out here. That was enough. Carolina. Oh, North Carolina beach. South South Carolina. Yeah. Fucking same down there. That's what I'm saying. I've been in the south, the chain of waffle house. Oh yeah. I used to work in Warren, the signage to what this sign, the font is so not exciting and then it's like piss yellow with like the most basic thing and you get in there and it's just, I don't know, there's always like a, either a fight's about to happen or just happened. It's just really like, I worked there three years and when I was in high school, people go there. They seem like they're hiding out. Like, you know, I can't go home

Speaker 1:          00:17:50       because of such and such situation.

Speaker 3:          00:17:53       Yeah, it's, it's, it's, it's uh, I didn't enjoy working ahead. How long did you work there for? Three years. Off and on. How many clients did you see? I didn't see any fights but someone at the end, after I work third shifts on time and it club and the club let out, these drunk people will come in and one person went in the bathroom and shit everywhere on the walls. So the waitress comes out, she goes, hey, I'm cooking food. She goes, Harris, I need you to clean the bathroom. I go, well, what's going on? Somebody made an accident. I went in there and it was just, it wasn't on purpose. I don't know. It looked like a crime scene, which shit. Uh, and I said, no, I'm not cleaning out. I don't get paid to clean shit off walls. And they don't make a mop for that.

Speaker 3:          00:18:30       No, they don't cause call a fucking Hazmat group. Exactly. Exactly. I refuse. And one of them did it and one lady came in and she wanted a cheeseburger and I said to Jesus, 50 cent extra, she goes, 50 set, can't you just put it on there at coop? No Lady, I can't just do it. You have to pay for it. And she didn't get the cheese the next day, the next night she came in, she had her own cheese and the plastic and she said, put that on my burger. Like using a nightclub. This cheeses in your glove compartment, two hours, you left your house, you've got your purse, your perfume, and your high heels and your cheese. So when you get to the waffle house to cook can put it on your burger because you don't want to pay 50% wow. Hilarious.

Speaker 1:          00:19:09       That's that is, that is, that is a level of fun. Cheekness cause that is cheapness. If you're going out to a club and you're going to pay a cover and you're going to do some shit like that, I fucking hate cheap people like that. And also dumb with money. Yes. I don't have any sympathy for that. My white guilt only goes so far. You know what I mean? I'll white guilt all fucking day long until I watched you get a deal and buy a bunch of dumb shit. Then it was like I'd forget it. Right, right, right. You know all kinds of shiny shit. Remember that? Remember the member the age of the deals and Montreal comedy festival and everyone would go up there and he'd be like, oh my dad was crazy and my brother was crazy and every was like, that's a show. And then you'd go out and you get a six figure deal. Remember all those fucking idiots that went out and they buy flat screen TV title. They ain't got a bunch of money. Todd land rest and peace literally did. And I refuse to believe it until Dean Edwards fucking, uh, confirmed it. Did the coming to America thing where he fixed up a place he was renting. He even redid the fucking floors. He, he showed his landlord, she raised the rent and he had to leave after a while.

Speaker 3:          00:20:10       Yeah. Yup, Yup. He bought a bunch. He, well, two cars. He, uh, he

Speaker 1:          00:20:14       bought that Gold Lexus. He had the Jesus, it was, it was an infinity, infinity, infinity. And he, he had a, he had a waist length mink with a hoodie on it, zip up and he would be on stage talking about white people. Right. You could be as white as, you know, you're never going to keep money if you do that. Right. He must have spent 20 grand on a horse. It was hilarious. I feel bad to go and do, we can't go that far. It's not alive to defend himself. But if it was less than it was, say the spirit of him. Yeah. Do you think

Speaker 2:          00:20:48       in the afterlife, both his arms worked doing and he says, Jesus, Oh God, you know, it's funny. Tie wouldn't have their arm and people were still afraid of him. Like, what the fuck are you afraid? Because he had that. He had the mean mug. I used to always tease him about this Roman nose. He had like a Julius Caesar fucking knows. Yeah, he was, I don't know. He kind of looked like a male missy Elliot. When I really think back, you know what, she needs to lose weight. You know, write, write right that size missy, whatever happened to her. Um, I think she took her money and left. I think Napster, which blew up comedy. I'm convinced to that. I'm smart with my money. Did it when I, after the accident I was, I only did all he only bowl. Can I get any credit here for going this far and, and not making you fucking relive that again.

Speaker 2:          00:21:34       Oh, that's fine. We can talk about it. It was okay. Yeah. Harris was one of the people, unfortunately, uh, who was on the bus with Tracy Morgan when that Walmart truck, not the bus. I'm sorry. It was one of those little, those Mercedes like say the band thing, Limo party bus without the polling. Rest in peace. A uncle Jimmy. Jimmy Mack. Yeah. Oh Man. I remember bombing with him at fucking Labar bat one night and I remember he was alarmed a little barbaric to, oh everybody, that fucking room that was talents from, I never figured that roam up. Never. If that room was like this really cool bar and it had an upstairs and a downstairs and it was Tuesday's the after work crowd, you know they never called any white people. I remember that specifically. All black crowd after work crowd and the only time I went there, I think I must've killed first because I went back.

Speaker 2:          00:22:26       Right, right, right. So I killed the first time, then I bombed, then I killed and I bombed every other fucking time. It was unbelievable. He only did it twice and a bomb. Both terms. I remember one night when I was new anyway, so I probably go bad. You never bombed so bad that the next guy's bombing off your bomb. Like, that's like an aftershock of what the fuck I did. Uncle Jimmy went up there and was bombing and he was bombing so bad and it was so fucking quiet. He was just that guy, man, fuck y'all. [inaudible] he goes, I in this woman was giving him shit and uh, he said something about like, what happened? You know, something about his career, right. You still got my fucking Korea. And she was like, Edward, what career? And everybody, that was the biggest laugh. Everyone laughed at him.

Speaker 2:          00:23:06       He was trying to talk about being on bet. Dude, you remember raw? What's his face? Uh, Gerald Kelly. Joe Kelly and I abandoned, I did one of his rooms out in Jersey. He was one of these places. It was a dance club. And like the next week it was closed because someone shot off guns or some shit. And I fucking went in there and it was me and Ross g and I forget who else. And he was supposed, he was supposed to host it. It was his Roman. He was like fucking two hours late. And uh, he came on stage. Oh yeah. And it just was like, he's like, Yo, what up? You just got back from Atlanta [inaudible] kind of sound and he goes doing comic view. He goes, made

Speaker 1:          00:23:46       six g's, I'd say made six grand doing comics. If you're not people not in the business comic view, you got paid like 600 bucks. I got thousand dollars one time. Did you think that was actually after everybody I remember was in the hundreds. It was like 700 bucks.

Speaker 4:          00:23:59       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:24:00       All inclusive. Like you lost money. You lost money. Yeah. Yeah. Got It to one of your hotel, you gotta pay for your flight. So he shit, nobody knows that. So he showed up, told the crowd that had waited for him, like fucking axl rose back in the day that he was late because he was doing a TV show and he made six grand. Hilarious. That's how we start. Every was like, what the fuck? And I remember Ross went up and she had such a tough set that uh, she ended her set and she goes, damn. She goes, I don't know who's coming up next, but he better be funny cause you motherfuckers ain't laughing at shit and walked off. And then they brought me up and of course the second I talked, everybody did the white guy voicemail. Hell yeah, I ate it.

Speaker 3:          00:24:39       Uh, Jimmy, I tell you a funny story with Jimmy because Jimmy Hill had, I guess he was away for comedy for a little while. So Tracy brought them on the roads and it was on tour with us. Um, but before I got on the tour, uh, mark field both said that Jimmy would go up and open and be bombing. So uh, Tracy said a chimney, you go up, warm the crowd up and just will go up at Jimmy started bombing and then a already comes back and goes, you'll Tracy Jimmy's bomb. You want me to get them off the, she was like, no, no, let them simmer for a little bit.

Speaker 3:          00:25:12       Goes back out. Yo Jimmy stretch. It's to me turns the Broncos. Oh, okay. They want me to stay out here and he just bombed for five more minutes. Like Tracy, you were an asshole for just letting him sit in this bomb for five more minutes, let them out off the hook man. And before then, so the next night he goes, Jimmy, you're up against, you're up. Sounded like that dude in pulp fiction. Let them simmer a little bit. It's similar little bit. And then so the next night, Jimmy Tracy goes, Jim, you're on again tonight night. And Jimmy literally went in the corner and started rehearsing his lines like new comics do. And he went out bombed again. What an asshole. Tracy. I had a

Speaker 4:          00:25:57       bunch of those. There was a guy, I remember when I was in Boston, this guy, this guy, Dick Doherty, he still has rums. He had all of these fucking rooms, right? Right. He was like the godfather of the outside the satellite rooms. Right. You had the, the main clubs in Boston. And then he had all of these places in like fucking Drake, it and all these places in Massachusetts and uh, which are all great towns, but you know, not the best place sometimes to do comedy. So he finally did want it. He finally got one in Boston. I guess he always had the, uh, he had the comedy ball for a while, but he opened this other one in Kenmore Square, right in the college area and they called it comedy comedy campus. So this, this journeymen guy, finally, he gives him the room, like your book in this room, your host it, and he's fucking psyched, man.

Speaker 4:          00:26:38       I'm finally fucking making something in this business. And um, he fucking, the first night of it, I'm on it with Greg Fitz Simmons. And the dude goes up and it's just really small crowd. 10, 15 people on through. When I tell you he didn't get a fucking laugh. He got nothing. Brings up the first act. The first act immediately starts killing crowd. Fucking livens up. Everything's going great. Dude finishes his set. Thanks a lot. Back to your house. So, and so host comes back up immediately bombing again bombing. That's always funny when the host is bombing also bombs again, brings up, uh, the woman that Greg was dating at the time. Fucking she kills back to him bombing. So finally brings up one more person. That person's killing, right? So fucking Simmons looks at him and he just goes, hey buddy. He goes, dude, you know, if, if it's not happening for you, just bring acts up. You know, we, we, we got plenty of show here. We've got plenty of showing, like piss this guy off. So he got on stage and he fucking immediately just starts bombing again. So finally, dead silence. He just looks at the crowd. He's like, you know what? What the fuck? What the fuck the fucking jokes do you fucking people want? Exactly. And this guy and the crowd goes, how about some funny jokes?

Speaker 2:          00:27:49       And he goes, he goes, funny how like things going in and out of your anus. Oh, that's that. Does that kill it? Killed me and Greg. That's hilarious. He said it was such fucking bile in his voice. You actually pictured this guy's an asshole. Pucker and up. That's your key. Me and Greg were, it was the funniest joke of the night. He will cry and Larry's, and the crowd was just like, Whoa, what the fuck? Oh, well, you remember Kevin Hart's sweet cheeks in Atlantic city? I never did that one. But I remember they throw chicken at big J. Oh, it was awful. They love heavy bar it. No, it was a sweet cheeks and it sounds like a gay bar. Teres worked at gay bar called fiddlesticks. I did one. It was called Queen of hearts. Oh Man. No, it wasn't a gay bar. It's actually the opposite.

Speaker 2:          00:28:35       Gangsters hung out. There was fights all the time and they love little Kevin and, but when everybody else we'll come back on, they would just, they do like the little plastic that you put the menu in on the table. They threw that at Jimique. Uh, they just, they were awful, but they loved Kev. I was like, well that guy is funny tools. Oh, I didn't do rooms like that after a while. Like there was a weapon if enough people that last bag, if enough people came back with stories. Yeah. He was trying to get me to do that. Roman. I remember I was far enough in my career to do it. I don't need to drive to Philly to bomb like I can. I can do that. I'll do drew, drew, Frazier's, rum, Manhattan proper. I'll take the e to the end. That just finally closed to take my, I love that room.

Speaker 2:          00:29:19       I remember one time doing that air all the time too. I remember doing that one time and I remember one entourage chasing another entourage out of the club and then the next week there was like a metal detector. Yeah, wait, but yeah, that's two parking gangsters used to hang out in these cases just to hang out. They're like real live drug dealers. Yeah. That was the vibe, but then this really cool after work thing was there like supreme. He, he, he was on American gangster. He, they used to hang out there. It was not a guy there named supreme WWI. You probably didn't know when your whiteness, you had no idea that it makes the why we thought it was a cut. People used to do. When I got off the fucking, when I took the EDA, Jamaica Queens get up, they would look at me like they would just be like, people would try to help me.

You know, use, use, performing in front of killers. Digi. Uh, no. I, I knew that there was definitely some shit going on that wasn't legal, but I mean, I thought it was kind of like a, do you ever think about that? How many, how many like people that killed somebody at this point, how long you've been doing standup? How many people in the crowd who have killed somebody that people just don't even know yet? All right. All right. I just think that on the subway, right. Well, in, in Manhattan, probably, you definitely had it. Some clientele and it kills him. Might I add somebody killed some, some future stars are for the first 48 yes. Let me make him some appetite.

Speaker 1:          00:41:33       Okay, here we go.

Speaker 4:          00:41:34       It was bad timing. We both took a sip. All right. Uh, here's some questions. All right, now I tried to get some ethnically diverse. Once, so I can show you that I'm woke. How annoying is that to hear a white person say that by the way, are you married to a black woman? Huh? Yeah. But you know, once you're married that long, just a woman, you know it's the same file cultural fight. It's not like the little, you'll hold the fork like this and I hold it like that. Wow. There really is a difference. It's the same shit. Like can I finish up here in the bathroom before you try to steal the sink? Brushing your teeth. It's the exact same shit. Right? It's only when you go out in public and everybody's like, what the fuck are you doing together? You fucking race trader.

Speaker 4:          00:42:17       Yup. Um, but when you're in the House, Huh? I low ball. You can have mine. You can have mine. Whatever one I was supposed to be with and I took yours. There you go. And then one day we'll go on a double date like those too. Freaky fucking, was it the Yankees and the Indians near here? The button that they swapped wives? No, there was two teammates. They went on a double date. By the end of the end of the date, they fucking realized, hey man, we're like sorta like, you know, they probably sat at a four top boy, girl, boy, girl. And I think they just sort of uh, the dude stop talking to each other and chicks up top. You should have by the end of it some they agreed to switch. Swap wives like to just go forever like yeah. And I think one of them made it and the other ones didn't.

Speaker 4:          00:43:01       That's hilarious. The other one didn't. That'd be the funniest fight. I should have stayed with that right. Feel there. Well I know he's getting a better blow job than I am old. Be Brutal. Um, all right, here we go. So I tried to have some ethnically diverse. Okay, so you want to start, this is a nice one that I feel like anybody have any sort of background? Transgendered? Anybody? Uh, this one's called favorite Ozzy Osborne guitarist. So this is right in your wheel house. This is a fast ball. I feel like you can jump on this one. Why is this in my wheel house isn't being an asshole. You are breaking bad. I'm watching a documentary on Ozzie that's four hours long and booze and while the girlfriend is out with her peers doing sex in the city, shit a while, Randy Rhoads always gets to me, especially during Mr Crowley, that none of this means anything to you.

Speaker 4:          00:43:52       My favorite is always been Jakey Lee. I grew up on bark at the moon when I was a kid and still listen now and again to the last furious rips of Jake and the last minute of the song I always felt he was under appreciated. Could not agree more. Zack Wylde is all good, but it feels like he's using five pedals instead of showing pure skill. Well, you should've seen Zack wild when he played with the almond brothers. That would have cured all of that shit for you. A more style than substance. I don't agree with that. Uh, what do you think Drumma boy ps was great to see you Montreal last summer when it was your birthday. Um, all right. What do you think Harris? Just by the names alone. Who would you think is the best guitars? Would you go with Randy Rhoads, Jake Jakey Lee or, or, uh, Zack wild. Probably Zack Wylde Zack wild by because it's wild.

Speaker 2:          00:44:44       It goes crazy. You can jump on that Janky leave. What does that sound like to you? Jakey lease. I was like borderline Asian, mixed Asian trying to fit into the culture. Okay.

Speaker 4:          00:44:56       And Randy Rhoads. Randy Rhodes, uh, as a racist. And um, he died in a plane crash by the way. Oh yes. She'd go easier. This is like making fun of Tupac for a lot of white.

Speaker 2:          00:45:09       Right? Right. Oh, sorry. I don't know any of these people, uh, listeners. I don't know any of these people. I would never say that if I don't know him. Well, he did play in an all white bands. So I mean your theory does work. Fucking racist. Uh, no,

Speaker 4:          00:45:25       no. Is it brutal story is he was on tour with the Ozzy, Ozzy left black sabbath. Right. And that would be no doubt. That would be what, whatever they had a fallen out. It'd be like one of the one on how do we relate to, you hear, well, it'd be like something in the Wu Tang clan, they leave and then they put out a solo album. That's, that's critical there. Right. But Blue Tang never really broke up, right? No, not religious. Haven't made, no. Okay. Well just say they broke up and then all of a sudden, uh, you know, one of those guys that's not old, dirty pastor and method man, ghost face killer decides I'm going to fucking put one out. You know, uh, you know, it's a very, it's a very precarious point in your career. Like you, you don't get a second solo album if the first one bombed, especially if, you know, came out in a supergroup.

Speaker 4:          00:46:11       So black Sabbath thing was over. He was coming out on his fucking own and he ended up meeting Randy Rhoads and Randy Rhoads basically saved his fucking career. Hey, so they go out on tour, he's destroying, he's like the new guy and everything. And they, uh, were in Florida and they pulled in and the bus driver, wherever they were going to gas up the bus, that was also a little plane there. And this guy had a pilot's license and he fucking got in the plane with Randy Rhodes and he was fucking buzz in the bus doing all of that shit in his last pass, clip the bus, and either flew into the house or into the barn to one of the other. And then that was, it does crazy. And that was it. And you just said he sounded like a racist. I hope you're happy. No Man. You know, maybe if she shouldn't be googling all your fucking porn, you could look up Randy Rhoads before you soiled his name. All right, here we go. Here. Here's, here's one that we can both jump on here at. Girlfriend isn't very attractive and I want to cheat. All right. Um, I've been dating my girl for a year now and I love the shit out of her, but God damn, if she isn't on the wrong side of the 10 point scale,

Speaker 2:          00:47:18       God, what an asshole. You don't love her? No. And why would you date her if she's ugly? If you think she's ugly? Yeah,

Speaker 4:          00:47:25       yeah, yeah. You don't love this woman. All right, we got it. It's not, there's anything wrong with their face. She's just not really my type physically, personally, personally wise. Does he eat, flight, physically personal. Personally, we jive what he says personally wise, personality wise. Sorry. We jive like crazy jive. This guy's to be like 50 it's like, dude, what are you look like? Does he eat food or he doesn't like to, and let's say she's really pretty when I'm laying on top or next suffer, but any other position, and I can't help but be disappointed in how overweight she is. She says, this guy's a fucking monster. On one hand, the sensation of being with thick girls really appeals to me on the other. My male gaze does not agree because of this. I've found my thoughts wandering to other women have started flirting with them for seemingly no reason. I'm afraid I'm going to cheat, but I really think all things considered that I could marry this girl. This guy's all over the fucking map is breaking up with her for something so shallow would absolutely kill me and it hurt. The woman I love,

Speaker 2:          00:48:34       loves heart for no reason. What should I do? Go see a therapist. Yeah. He's like

Speaker 4:          00:48:39       oddly like brutally honest. He's being brutally honest here, but what? He's all like, it makes no sense. I like purple but I don't like purple, which is it? Pick, pick the pros and cons and you know, he went on it is, he made a very mature move where he actually fell in love with the person and now I think that that's getting old. Yeah. You know, there's no more surprises now he's just looking at her and I think that that's what's going on and exactly what was going on. All right, now, how can he for Christmas, what gift can he give her that in a funny loving way can be like, you need to lose some weight or I'm going to cheat on you. Sherry's berries.

Speaker 2:          00:49:24       Oh,

Speaker 4:          00:49:24       there is no way. There is no way. Like, you know the end of an action movie where it's which wire do I clip and they fucking take a guess. Yeah, both of them blow up. Yeah. Alright Harris, I gotta to put you on the spot. How would you do it? How would you tell the woman you love personality wise, you guys jive is this guy says, how the fuck would you tell her? You putting on too much weight.

Speaker 2:          00:49:49       Well, if you know someone that long, when you go bitch, you fat, you need to lose some weight. So you just, so you rip the bandaid off. Go listen, you're getting a little overweight. I had a boy, a friend of mine who dumped his girl. He wander before doing it while they were dating. He said, if you get big, I'm outta here. She got big. He was out of there. She tested him. She ate two bucks. She, she tested the brand. He said that they said that to her and he left her crying. I told you exactly what did I say? Look in the mirror. Look, what did I say? You're a hundred pounds bigger than you was when I said that shit. But he has the thing

Speaker 1:          00:50:28       though. I actually think there is like a complete lack of respect for your partner if, if you let yourself go. Absolutely. There is. Now here's the thing, unless you know you Sikhism, oh or she, you know, she got what? She was pregnant, she had a kid talking about all of that. But before having kids or if you're not having kids, all right, if you sit in a man or a woman, if you're just sitting there just becoming a fucking lard ass. Exactly. What are they supposed to do? Exactly. That you putting a lot of pressure, like Patrice said, whenever you, how will you look to get him? You have to somewhat maintain it all. Otherwise he's going to venture, we're animals. We're ma like we were. And what I loved about Patrice as he could be that overweight in the crowd, they would never even think to say like, well, what about you?

Speaker 1:          00:51:15       Right, right, right. He would just be like, bitch, I've always been this size. Um, yeah. I don't know what, what should he do? Um, talk to her like you're talking to you on these. I would just say this, I would put it on me. This is what I would do and this is this. If you really loved her, I'd put on 20 pounds myself and then just be like, listen man, I got to get this weight off and get diabetes. If I loved her, I would put on 20 pounds myself and just say, listen, I got to get this weight off but I can't do it on my own. I need you. Okay. I mean week lately, I need you to know, oh and she'll be there for you and your take around and walks and this is what you do. You buy, I wouldn't do that.

Speaker 1:          00:51:51       No, I wouldn't. I'd dumper. No, I wouldn't. You buy his and her fucking matching workout fucking outfits walk. Just steer right into it. Just walking. Be that couple that dresses the same. Oh, I know. That's one of the, it's just like, that's either like whenever I see that that's like either they literally are soul mates if you believe in that or there's one person that needs to be rescued from that relationship because the other person, like who was that guy in the NBA when you ric flair do, what would Rick flair do? Yeah. Oh Jeez. Well he wouldn't be around long enough for her to get fat when he came over on the road when she fucking put on all that way and he'd do the flare flop right in front of it and just turn around. Oh you do the Henry Hill. He just do that laugh member that and he'd go walk turns right back around and he gets, he gets back in the, got that fuck kind of people.

Speaker 1:          00:52:47       Are they getting back in the car with the Joe Pesci I think that's what he would do. Um, this guy, I think he was trying to be, sometimes people try to be funny by being really blunt. I actually think this guy does really like this girl, but like, uh, yeah cause I think if they start getting that fat before you had kids, you just start thinking like, oh my God, I don't want to be with a, well no one wants to be with the, no one wants to be a whale and no one wants to be with a whale. Well some, some guys like big women. Okay. All right. Okay. But he doesn't know. He likes it. Will Thicken and sunken obese. My had a best friend

Speaker 2:          00:53:26       who wanted his woman as fast as she could be. Oh he did? Yeah. He had a best friend. She was, his wife was a fat motherfucker too. What is that about? I don't, I think they liked it. This is what's so weird. You know, maybe they want them to just look adorable. You know, the durable a baby looks with all those roles of like a roll of fat in the mid forearm. He just looking at like, what is that? Right? What is that? That they didn't want a big, a big giant baby. I think there's a lot of, they like a lot of woman, but I like a lot of one but far as like not fat, but like let's say six, five, 11 that's a lot of women too. Yes, I understand what you're saying, but it's not fat, not fat. What's, what's the biggest she would go give me height and weight. Let's break down your draft picks and in the foot. Then the first round of the big girl draft terrorists, Staten picks, picks 185 pound, six foot. Nope, five tall. How tall are you? I'm six. Two and a half. Six, two and a half. All right. Yeah, so she has to, if you're going to weigh 200 pounds, you'd have to be five 11 and better. Otherwise you're just a fat bitch.

Speaker 2:          00:54:48       Let's consider an insensitive, but it's actually, there's an endearing thing where you're just being brutally honest. I mean that's, that's what your heart is saying. Yes. It's saying you're a fat bitch. It's not being like listen. Um, right. Your heart's doing all the work. Yeah, I would, I would go, uh, whatever. Cause I'm like, I'm five, nine, three quarters. I'm, I'm exactly Doug Flutie height, not quite five 10 big woman with curves are, are, have a chance. Like if you still, you don't have the fat woman, they are really fat, but you can still see the curve. Yeah. Curvy. Like it was like a skinny woman, but fat. Yeah. Like a deck, a hot chick giant. Just sacrifice that. Ah, right. I would say, I would say one 65 cause I'm about one 75 I don't want to throw me around the fucking room height. Is it like five, five [inaudible] six as big. Yeah. That's not that big. Depends on the, you know, depends. Five, five 160 pounds. She, she's got a nice ass on her. I don't like those. Cankles would ankles or went into the, to the foot. You know what's weird is when he got, they got fat feet and skinny. Oh yeah. It's like, it's like someone was at, you know the carnival, right. We slam the hammer down and trying to win that prize and the hit a mid feet. Right. You've heard Corey Holcomb's fucking underrated comedian. Absolutely underrated in my fucking head. But uh, he, he felt welcome. You have a fuck the fat girl. We're regular people legs, but God damn, I just fucked the hamburger.

Speaker 1:          00:56:25       That's usually an alcoholic body. There was a guy that I used to work with who I found out recently died, which wasn't a surprise. He was like the biggest booze hound coke. He was like six, five. It was funny, man. He was just big, just like, dude, his legs were skinny as mine and he would push his jeans down and just up top was all, was just all booze and burgers and he said hello and uh, and he had the little skinny hit, but he had like his arms and legs was like, he never worked out in his life was just skinny as shit and he just kept all of that stuff there again. Well, I think he died of a heart attack. That's it right there. Which is why going back to this guy, it's just like, that's another thing you have to look at.

Speaker 1:          00:57:08       Going to be like, I'm going to be a widower in my mid fifties there's gotta be an exercise video just to get rid of your flat feet or at least to fatten up your toes, right? You should get like, no, you should get like the acid injections in your toes just to fucking even it out, you know? Um, all right, here we go. Ladies. Get deprived to, how are we doing on time? Oh, good. Killing it. We're right on schedule here. All right ladies, get deprived to dear bill. I am a lady in my late twenties and I need a male perspective on something that's too embarrassing to bring up with my friends. All right. On a good day, one might consider me quite easy on the eyes. I exercise every day. I have a natural look, I. E. Not trashy, 20 layers of makeup kind of Gal. However, I always make a case of looking well put together even at home. See, she gets it. However, my husband's a fat fuck anyways, but for some reason in the last year of my five year marriage, my husband denies me sex. Even if I only want to service him. He knows I like to do it. Geez. He's like, don't you want a job? Yeah, this is bad. Uh, yeah. This is bad. This is when you're not going to start taking off the police tape and getting out the blanket too to take a blow job from another dude.

Speaker 1:          00:58:27       I Dunno about that. All right. On any given evening he will be a, it's not the mouth, dude. It's the stubble. I think that that's what you couldn't get past. I almost got need to do a spit take on any given evening. He will be sitting on his desk working late and if I try to initiate things by touching him and kissing his neck, he will say, sorry babe, it's too late and I'm tired. Same goes for when we are in bed. It has gotten to the point where I just, you know what, I got this paranoid thing just cheating like a month ago. Huh? Either that or he got replaced by a robot and the days they haven't worked out the genitals yet. Sorry Babe. It's too late and I'm tired and we're throwing their voice. Um, same goes for when we are in bed. It's gotten to the point where I will try to approach him in lingerie, sit on his lap and even go as far as begging for just five minutes.

Speaker 1:          00:59:20       All any success. Uh Oh, this is like, this is one of these things. If it was a new story, I would shut it off cause I don't want to see the fucking ending. Here we go. What baffles me is that during normal day to day life, he will frequently grab my ass or tell me I'm hot. Wow. I also do the same for him as I know men like to feel manly around their lady. This woman is like a dream. I don't know what's this guy's problem is the possibility of NFL. Okay. The possibility. She said she's, you know, she's easy on the eyes. She takes care of herself. Yeah. I Dunno, I got a nice picture in my head. Um, anyways, the possibility of an affair is very unlikely. Seeing as we both work on the same male dominated company that's not good and go home together.

Speaker 1:          01:00:08       Um, also he doesn't have a password in his phone. I think maybe he's gay male dominated. I know something wrong with him also. He doesn't have a password in his phone, which is another huge indication of nothing to hide. We have a very nice interaction. I never nag him. If anything, he nags me and we do cool stuff like play ball together or watch some Netflix. It was Dick don't work no more. You don't want to tell her yet. Yeah. You need to sit down and talk to him. He's a very loving husband except for the actual physical loving part. I've tried to ask, but everything is fine. Uh, everything is fine isn't as it appears a bill. Could you please let me know what the Hell's going on? Aren't men supposed to be always in the mood? Uh, that's not true. But, uh, generally speaking, yes, I am going crazy and I'm starting to get aroused from the most ridiculous thing like men's smiling at me or opening the door.

Speaker 1:          01:01:03       Jesus, thank you. I really enjoy everything you're doing contrary to what you think. You are very balanced and insightful in your opinions. Look at this. I got to read that to my wife. Happy fucking holidays and go fucking fuck yourself. One itching lady itching to get fucked. Uh, listen, I think you've been nice for long enough. Exactly where you need to sit down and be like, look or leave him. No, no, no. You've got to have the conversation before first I said, yeah, of course. What is going on? Because you know I'm about ready to get jumped on a rolling pin. Exactly. What the fuck are you doing it you need, you need, you guys need to have a talk. Need to go on. And I wouldn't, I would go nice because just in case it is some physical thing you got to go nice first year.

Speaker 1:          01:01:47       But now maybe, maybe, maybe he's addicted to online porn as a problem man. But that definitely can't continue what they're doing. They seem like they're around each other the whole time. I don't know what's going on. You get a lot of, you have a lot of weird stuff. Yeah. All right. Need Advice? Quitting drinking. So I wouldn't, I guess our advices, I w I would sit down and talk to them. Absolutely. You're not being a nag at all. If anything, you've been too nice and uh, I would just go easy just in case it's something fucking a problem. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          01:02:20       Like he got molested as a kid and it finally came out and now he doesn't like, did they ever used to go at it like bunny rabbits? I don't know. That's a good question. Did y'all ever used to have like a real healthy sexual relationship then? It just fell off a cliff? I, oh, was it gradual or, yeah. I think once you have a kid though, that that just happened, like the appeal of going to sleep is just fucking unbelievable. It's unbelief and it's something if you do it together, like that's your sex. Gosh,

Speaker 1:          01:02:46       we're going to get eight hours. This is fucking awesome. All right. Needed vice quitting drinking. Uh, I know you're, I know you're at 100 something odd days now of no drinking 116 days of not drinking. I'm at a whopping day three and this is my third attempt in the last two months. Take some serious time off. Most of my attempt only last three or four days max because every Friday rolls around and I can't help but buy some booze. I want to quit because my problem is serious, not serious enough that I experienced minor withdrawals like minor shakes, LG. Oh Wow. If I haven't had a drink in like 12 to 16 hours, meaning I'm physically dependent. Yeah. Dude, this is a great reason to stop. It's not serious to the point where people notice I'm able to keep it under control, but drinking everyday needs to stop.

Speaker 1:          01:03:33       Yeah. Your what's known as the intelligent are alcoholics, so you can fucking what I call you. You're a smart guy and your booze and so you can play shit off and nobody notices where they're just a fucking moron. Everyone's going to notice. Exactly. My question for you is how did you go about filling up the boredom that comes with being sober? Oh, what a great fucking question. I feel like I'm drinking a, when I'm drinking anything. It's fun sitting on the couch for hours. It's so true on end watching youtube videos. But when I'm sober I've got like 20 minutes tops before on board with whatever I'm doing. Also. What was your prop? Was your problem ever bad enough that you felt withdrawals? Uh, I know how to tape her pretty well at this point, but I have failed so many times that if you know of any tapering tips, basically how to Wean your way off, I guess.

Speaker 1:          01:04:23       Uh, I'd love to hear them. Ps, I've always missed the old overrated underrated segment you used to do circuit 2009 ish on the podcast. You should bring that back or actually bringing it back. Um, all right. This week we'll bring it back. Uh, we'll keep doing it. And if you guys want to send an an overrated, underrated. Um, I find when I stopped drinking, like when I stop, it's, it's tough for like the first, uh, like six to 10 days and what it is I'm more habit addicted. Like I just like if, if I'm eating well, like I'm addicted to go, I'm going to get a salad. If I'm eating like shit. Like if I eat McDonald's the next day I'm craving McDonald's. If I'm drinking then I want to drink. So it's basically, I tried to be conscious of those thoughts in my head and just be like, try to get to the next morning, going tomorrow morning, what's going to make me happier that I had a drink right now or that I didn't and it was always that I didn't.

Speaker 1:          01:05:21       So I would choose that. That's a good, that's a good word. I used to do that at the Boston comedy club when we never really know what she had. Like I never really seen you drunk ever back in the day. Uh, yeah, I, in the last like, uh, like 15 years, I gradually just drank more and more and more and more important. And then I, uh, I just, I'm not an alcoholic but I, but at the amount that I drink, I absolutely am, but I'm one of those guys that can shut it off and like this guy just sit there and be like, shows you don't, I can do it. If I'm not performing arts, I can, I'll have a drink. But if I'm performing I need one or two, but I'm not an alcoholic but far, but I have all the problems. I, my thing is like, I, uh, if I'm doing something, I'm doing it.

Speaker 1:          01:06:06       So the first thing I do when I sit down at a bar is I always order a double because I'm assuming that they're poor is you go to the Bart destination, leaving your house is the bar or like, how's this Nigga ours after shows? Oh by the sumps this this summer it was becoming like going to the liquor store, buying a bottle and always like I was on the road doing an acting gig and I made sure I had a bond and I just close it and I knew I was shutting it down. So it's just like this is where it is. Bill, this is bad. Um, yeah, it got, it got way, way, way worse than it ever went as far as like, what am I doing? I remember coming home from the set one night and being excited that the bar was still open and before I went in there's no road debt to where where I was staying.

Speaker 1:          01:06:52       I was by myself and I ordered a double, sucked it down and said give me another double cause I was sort of addicted to that, that crazy buzz and then going asleep. I think, um, I like the tube and then the whole time wanting to stop or wanting to not do it as much. And that was the only time there's was first time ever. My wife brought it up going on, you know, you're really drinking a lot and hey, you're going to snore and blah blah blah blah. And then one night I came down to set up good wife, meet all I can see you. I know I'm so embarrassed by this. I came downstairs and I actually was hiding the glass of booze on the other side when I was coming down the stairs and I was just like Whoa, I'm that guy now how soon before the bottles in the back of the toilet.

Speaker 1:          01:07:37       But I kind of too much of a control freak to make it happen like that. So, but I find like once I go 10 days, the way I'm wired, I could go, it gets easier. In theory, I could go forever. Okay. Cause now it's just something I don't do. I'm just like audit the whatever it is that would, that had its, it's fucking claws in me. It only takes 10 days for how I'm chemically made up to just be like, yeah. Like right now I'm 116 days in, I could easily go a year, I could go two years. I could, I could like never drink again for the rest of my life. I don't think about it anymore after the shows. No,

Speaker 4:          01:08:15       there's certain things that like makes me just wish I was still drinking. Eh. I'm like, what did I see the other day that was just like, aw man, I love to do that. Like, uh, I saw some cool looking bar and it was just like, man, I would love to go there at two in the afternoon and just get fucking drinking till six get fucking hammered. But then, but now the way it plays out is renewable flare though. I know I would jump into Uber and I would come home drunk to my daughter and I was like, ah, can't have that on the resume. So that's over.

Speaker 4:          01:08:54       So my life also kind of, I'm not telling this guy needs to have a kid. So I would just say what you need to do is you got to push through that boredom and uh, I put the, there's so much fun shit that you can actually fill that time up with that. It's stuff that you wanted to get good at. Like, like I've always been in the music, like playing drums and playing guitar. If you do that instead or working out like if at night. Yeah. If at night you go out for a jog instead and then this is nothing, this is nothing to about not drinking is the fucking pounds just fall off. You really, you know, as long as you don't substitute it with them. Like I'm going to eat ice cream so I can get like a sugar rush. If you actually eat well and you don't booze, yeah. It just falls off. Yeah. It's got nowhere to hide. So, um, I dunno man, but it sounds like, you know, the, the shakes and stuff, you're on another level than I was. So I'm, I, if I was you, I might even go to a meeting

Speaker 3:          01:09:47       as borderline intervention TV show. What'd you get to shake?

Speaker 4:          01:09:50       Yeah, a little bit. I would go to a meeting, just check out a meeting just to go down there, check it out, sit in the back, have a fucking doughnut, whatever the hell they do there. And just listen to these people's insane stories that actually make you feel better about himself. Self. Exactly. Um, all right. Okay. Here we go. Overrated. Underrated. Bringing this back because this is something that's, this guy said, so we actually were going to do when this week, this is something he used to do way back in the day. 2090 [inaudible] too. Overrated. Underrated. It was the thing of the week. Whatever you thought was over eight and whatever was underrated. All right. Overrated. Texas hold'em. Underrated. Five Card Stud. Now here's the deal. I don't know shit about cards. Um, I, I don't know. You got to give me the explanation. All right. That was a bad, that was a soft open. I don't know anything about cars and don't play cards. All right. What do you think is overrated right now?

Speaker 6:          01:10:42       Oh,

Speaker 3:          01:10:43       this, this topic. No, no. What I think is overreading right now, hip hop.

Speaker 4:          01:10:51       Rarely. Yeah. Like th th th th

Speaker 3:          01:10:56       the not having any words in your song and it being a quote unquote a classic. Ours a hot a song for this time and it, but 10 years down the road just guy said nothing. It was just be, be in sounds. I was just beaten then like mumble rap. They don't, they don't say anything.

Speaker 4:          01:11:15       Oh everybody. Yeah. Everybody sounds like they're kind of like half in the bag. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          01:11:19       And there's no originality anymore, but people are still celebrating something that is less original than it used to be. Do you know how old you sound right now? The people in your generation has gangster rap. Originality is not old at arrest. Universal and they don't have any original that their name's not even different. How many little rappers do we have? Little this little, that little, you can't even name yourself and the original name. All right. When did they live? When did it hip hop lose you? Hmm. Uh, probably mid 2000. No, late 2000 late 2000 maybe 2011 12 on and up. But not all you want. You hung in there. Yeah. But not all hip hop night. You got artists like m and M and nozzle was still doing what they're supposed to do with God. You're doing like, that's like me going Yo Zeppelin and ac DC going back like 20 years.

Speaker 3:          01:12:10       But those guys are still wrapping those chaos and it's still relevant and it's the words like you got, you can't have a song. It's instrumental. What about the WHO? Who's it? They got all the awards. Migos. The meek is at the Migos. I don't even know him. He throw listened to him. I don't even know. I heard of him, but I know a lot of rappers name got little in it and that bugs me little Uzi Vert and they could just change your name to original name. Little Wayne was first and then everybody else's little bit. My Tupac and Biggie, they had their own names. Not that it's original name.

Speaker 4:          01:12:45       Yeah, he went there. He went little because there was already a too short who is, who is the, uh, the little person there and uh, uh, that fucking guy was that, fuck. I don't know anybody. There was a guy, Bushwick, Bill Bush. Yeah, he was, no, he didn't even say little. No, he was, he was bleeding with bill several years from, well, you know, these millennials are sensitive. Okay. I would say overrated. Being informed is overrated. Absolutely. I am off social media is, I don't read the shit anymore. I post my shit on there, but I'm done. Like, oh, I fucking took a picture of this thing today. This is the classic classic is going to take forever to turn my phone on. Somethings gotta keep going. Classic fucking like a joke. When you forgot the punchline, you just keep repeating and set up. Oh yeah. Shit is crazy. She is crazy shit. It's crazy. We used to say, we used to say when when comic white comics will lost in their act, they'd look down and be like, yeah, yeah, so uh, what else is going on? And that shit is crazy. She just crazy out here. But you're a good looking crowd. Applause. But let me now, tonight for the ladies, ladies, all the strong women in the crowd, they're always strong. Women are always wrong.

Speaker 3:          01:13:59       Do that. So I wouldn't bomb early, like in black rooms. Like I'll just go give it up for the ladies and, and compliment the crowd of milk. So they'd give me at least 30 more seconds not to Boomi. Okay.

Speaker 4:          01:14:10       What's the hardest room you ever did? Sweet. She's sweet cheeks back to sweet cheeks. It's not even, I don't think it's like, it's just a fucking place to go get pick up $200. Well the two 50 back then. Oh yeah. That was literally like fighting might like Mike Tyson. It's just like, all right, if I can survive around I get, I get my fucking purse. All right. This is something that somebody tweeted today about that pipe bomb that went off on in the uh, the port authority has happened. Yeah. Am I mean, fortunately nobody died. They said there was non, I like non life threatening injuries but that doesn't mean somebody didn't lose an eye or fucking hearing or something. Bomb went off on 23rd street right by Gotham comedy club and they closed the street off. I, you going to do a joke? No. And so just got off stage. When I got there, they was, the street was closed off and I actually asked a cop, but, but I have told because I have a spot I didn't give a fuck about. Oh Man, I just want to do much spot. Well this is what, this is what this fucking jerk off tweets about the port authority bum. He goes, I have no idea what's going on at the port authority, but it was chaotic and I did

Speaker 1:          01:15:14       state of find out

Speaker 4:          01:15:18       so you have no idea what's going on. But we had to find out how you felt about what you did know was happening. Who gives a fuck what you did? People down there hurt you fucking asshole. This is what I can't stand. I, I'll be an old man here about young people now. Nobody cares, right about every fucking thought and your stupid fucking headaches. When you there, did you see what happened? Do you have any information?

Speaker 1:          01:15:39       Okay.

Speaker 4:          01:15:39       Oh my gosh, I have no idea what's going on at port authority, but it was chaotic and I didn't stay to find out, and then there's going to be a thousand fucking people going. So happy. You're okay. Yeah, exactly. People just want them. I didn't know. So many people want it to be known.

Speaker 1:          01:15:54       Oh No. All these fucking people. The reason why at least fucking people on social media, it's like they have their own TV show and they're acting like celebrities, self-involved fucking celebrities as opposed to cool ones like us. The one who that skill, sorry. Sorry. All right, last one. Here we go. How do I tell the truth? Uh, Hey, bill. Well, I've been thinking with my Dick, I recently downloaded the popular hookup app, Tinder, and I've been using it to fish for some action with some college chicks in my area. I'm pretty good looking and I'm not bad with chicks, so I've had moderate success. I recently found this one chick in my area who is, oh, premed. Is that all one word? P? R? E? M. E? D? No, there'd be. Okay, thank you. All right. That was like, I knew I was dumb. I didn't think I was that fucking dumb. Um, you know what's funny, that fucking guy who said, the guy who I was telling this story about it, like, you know, funny how like things going in and out of your ass. He just sent me a text. I'll fucking random sec. Um, I recently found this check in my area who's premed. I really like spending time with her and we have the same sense of humor and political beliefs and she has an excellent body and face in short. She's pretty close to my ideal girl. However, there's one problem. I'm in high school

Speaker 4:          01:17:10       and she has no idea. Fuck, fuck this guy. Fuck this guy, dude. You Dude, you are a legend. I, you should be giving me advice. I have dodged most of our questions about the classes I take and where I couldn't dodge. I lied. Jesus. We haven't done anything physically, but she made it cleared. She is interested in me. I'm in deep bill. How do I tell her without her hating me? Uh, do I have to tell her? I just fucking tell her. Just say, listen, I don't want to go to a physical level without fucking telling you the truth. I'm still in high school. I really liked you. I would have told you sooner, but I was afraid you weren't gonna like me. Just do that. Put it out on the table. If she tells you to go fuck yourself, fine. But you've learned a very valuable lesson with women, which I wish somebody taught me way back on my teen years, teen years. Just tell him the truth. What are we doing? I wanna fuck you. I have no intention to having a relationship with you. Okay? Most will walk away. Some won't. But you can literally leave your fucking car out in the front of your house and it will never be keyed. None of your shit will be lid on.

Speaker 1:          01:18:14       Yes. That's why when I see guys who, who, uh, um, um, damn, I forgot my train of thought. But honesty is always the best policy because you don't have to worry about people getting mad and doing crazy shit to you. Dude. It works with cops. Two cops and women. Nobody lies, gets lied two more than those two. And when you actually come with the truth, even if they don't like the truth, it kind of like, yeah, you might not get a ticket. That's probably why Patrice, the fire that no one, no one, we didn't get in trouble. Yeah. Cause he was fucking honest about what happened. The only time I fucking bang this, you turn right. And on Fridays I did it. Just fucking cop got out of his car and I'm, as I'm pulling up and thinking, wow, maybe he didn't see it. He's just coincidentally getting out and he walks right up to my window.

Speaker 1:          01:18:54       He goes, let me see your driver's license and registration. I was like, yeah, fuck. He goes, uh, he goes, you know why I'm asking for that? And I was like, yeah. He goes, why? I go, because I just made an illegal uturn. And he goes, why did you do that? I go, because I'm impatient and I didn't want to wait in that line in there. And he just laughed and he goes, do you want me to give you, what do you want me to give you a ticket? And I said, no, but I'm not going to lie to you. Right. And he laughed again. He goes, all right, get out of here. I said, you're awesome. Right. That was it. Then other times I've told the truth and like all the way to the point, is this your current address? And I said No. And the guy wrote me up for everything and my fucking address and I was like, this motherfucker. He trying to get

Speaker 4:          01:19:33       fucking cop of the month. Like I did that in western New York. All right. We're out of time. Um,

Uh, Santa Steve, the Great Steve Simone and regular hero are raising money again this year for children fighting cancer and their families. Um, that's worded really weird.
