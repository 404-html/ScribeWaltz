You fucking nerd. Um, all right, this is the Monday morning podcasts for you people. This is was a brutal, brutal, brutal. Not Funny, fucking weak in the world, you know, as opposed to what Phil, all the happy go lucky w you know, weeks in the world. You know what I'm talking about?

Speaker 2:          00:02:07       Very tragic, tragic fucking week. And today I woke, I woke up to more tragedy or the ending of a tragedy via Paul Versey, Vir, z. I few people trying to find them on Twitter. Versie v, I, R. Z. I don't, I call it what I say. Um, he called me up and he texted me, he goes, dude, you wash and you watching this, they're cleaning house epic cleaning house. And I thought he was talking about the red sox. You know what I mean? Which by the way, I'm in Boston right now and I don't understand why the fuck everybody's so down on the red sox. If 48 and 48 they 583 and a half games out of second place. Who gives a fuck? You know, the ebb and flow of life. They want to world series. Now they're going through a low point, you know, why are you acting like in your own life? You make the playoffs every, you hold up the championship, you know, and they asked you, you know, hey, what's it a, you know, what's it like to be a championship? What do you got to say about finally winning the championship and then you go, it's about that time.

Speaker 3:          00:03:18       Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:03:18       That might've been the worst. Just winning a championship quote ever. Lebron James J was broad King James, you follow the, I had to bow diab die. Well, why didn't you just go, you know, I just want to thank my teammates and the feds are being supportive of, you know, it's just, it's an unbelievable I words you can't put it into words. It's something like that. So it's about that died, you know, I dunno. His stupid fucking agent's probably going to try to trademark that and just start having him say that. And every stupid commercial, you know, advertising toasters, toast pops up. It's about Dab, Dab, cut Lebron. You know, when you're saying it's about damn time, it seems like you're saying that the toaster takes too long to toast the bread, you know? Okay. No, I'm not saying that he has it. I wasn't aware, I couldn't talk to him. I'm sorry. Who and who are you? White guy in a suit. Okay. All right. Okay. Well we'll fix it in the Edney. Oh, Gigi. She um, yeah, it was just a brutal fucking brutal fucking day. Brutal fucking week. Not a lot of funny shit. Where the fuck is my phone buzzing right now? Hang on a second.

Speaker 3:          00:04:32       Fuck that phone.

Speaker 2:          00:04:34       Fuck that phone in his ass. You know what? Speaking of just brutal, you know I had one of the worst nightmares I've had in forever last night. All right. I'm laying in a hotel room here and right now you should be asking yourself, bill, it's Monday. You usually home or you're flying back from some God forsaken place. Why are you on the road? Why are you in Boston? You want vacation? Do it. What are you doing? You taking a booze cruise?

Speaker 3:          00:04:57       MMM.

Speaker 2:          00:05:00       I am a actually buy books, some acting work to be honest with you. Um, I'm shooting a pilot out here. They are redoing the kid shows zoom from back in the day they're going to do a reboot. And, uh, I booked the Gig. You know, I'd like to think it was because of my acting ability, but I think it was because I remembered the jingle from way back in the day. Right? Zoom z double o m box three five Oh Boston mass. Oh two one three four. Set it to zoom. And I pointed right at the cast director, right casting director. She had a zoom on zoom. I took it out, right? Like a fucking gun. And they were just like, wow, this kid's got the fire. We've got to hire him. Get him in a striped shirt. Anybody used to watch that? So zoom, I think it was a very like local Boston show where it was just these burnout fucking kids.

Speaker 3:          00:05:48       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:05:49       You ever seen a kid like five years old and he already looks like he's got a coke problem. That's what like zoom was and they're doing a reboot. They're rebooting it up. You know, I had an idea to do a prequel to my, my, my, I have three standup specials. I've got one more coming out in October. Right. So I got a three, you know, so that would be my star wars, empire strikes back and fucking return of the Jedi. So now I should do like a prequel. Okay, I should fucking grow my hair out. What's left of it and get like a fucking red wig to put on top of like a Gabe Kaplan Afro and just go out there and do like topical humor from like, I don't know, 1982, you know, go out there. Well doing some bad Ronald Reagan impression and I figured, you know what, that'd be funny for about 20 seconds. Then what do you do for the other fucking 59 minutes, 40 seconds. And then there it goes that day. You know what? I should just do a trailer, a prequel. Ah, Jesus, who gives a fuck. Um, anyways, anyway,

Speaker 4:          00:06:56       uh, it's just, just been a brutal week. So I turned on the TV to see what verse he's talking about, what he was talking about. And it's um,

Speaker 2:          00:07:05       no, wait, let me get back to the red sox here before I get into that shit. Ah, I'm all right with the red sox sucking. I actually liked them more now that they're not doing well. You know, I know this is, this is when,

Speaker 4:          00:07:18       this is, when you see who the real fans are and who aren't it people won't do it.

Speaker 2:          00:07:24       You Know Those Guys Bandwagon Bandwagon. You bought your first hat after game seven of 2004 I'll maybe game five, you know, if fucking break with your green monster tickets. You can't

Speaker 4:          00:07:39       sit down in the bleachers like the rest of us. No, it's fucking awful blue seats right by. You should go to games, right? There'd be nobody fucking there. Just baseball fans before ESPN ruined it and just so inundated the phone. Maybe it's, we just like out fucked our stadiums. I don't know what it is. There's so many goddamn people now. I remember back in the day, you'd go to a game, you know, just having a good fucking time and they'd always be some guy and he'd have, there'd be an empty seat on either side of him. And that's how we get that, you know, you know, let's go shocks then going, he would just slam both chairs down. You know, the cause it fold up shares, right? That Jesus built. Can you paint a better picture here? If you lose an us and he'd be slamming both of them down and everybody be hammered and you know, there'd be maybe five people there who had like some sort of like Red Sox, Actual Jersey on. Other than that, you had a hat.

Speaker 2:          00:08:37       You just fucking, Jesus it counting down some out there. I'm near the water near the water. Fucking coast Gad. Um,

Speaker 4:          00:08:49       yeah, like you, you, you'd have a red sox hat. That was it. And he had the piece of shit, one the one size, all, you didn't have like the same one that Clemens was wearing and you know, and now you go to the God damn games. It's like people did their fucking wearing the whole damn thing. Everybody's walking around, they look like managers. You don't like bull pit lake. There's like, they should be in the bullpen. So I like it. I liked that they suck. I liked that. The trailing off. I like that. I'm starting to see, uh, some empty seats. It's bringing me back. You know, if they could just stop singing that fucking song during the seventh inning stretch and if they could just get rid of that stupid fucking mascot. All right. I understand. While you're doing it for a marketing reason, I totally get that to try to get kids hooked into the gate. Why don't you, you know,

Speaker 4:          00:09:41       you know, I got into the game, I went to the game and I enjoyed fucking watching the game. That's it. I went there and I was sold the second I walked in there. I didn't need some big fucking muppet coming up to me in some creepy way. And, but it's like, you know, you cut its tongue out so it can't talk to me. I fucking hate that about mascots. I hate how they won't talk to you. What do you go? Hey, what's up man? And then they do that real fucking hyper nod. It's like, I know there's a guy in there. You idiot. There's no fucking kids around. You can't give me, hey man, what's going on? It's fucking hot as fuck in here. All right ma'am. Oh, here comes from kids. I've got to shut up. You know, can't do that. I mean, how much are they really paying you a game? All right. So anyways, Versie was talking about a, he was talking about Penn state, like all those sanctions against Penn state. Dude, it's fucking brutal. Like I, I don't, I don't think that the punishment is in the right area. I don't get it.

Speaker 4:          00:10:39       Why are you punishing the players in the fans? You're acting like they look the why did the winds don't count from 2000 from 1998 to 2011 why don't those games count? He won those fucking games. You know what I mean? That would be like if, if fucking, I don't know

Speaker 4:          00:11:00       if Mark Sanchez gets arrested for drinking and driving, right? Does his, you know, if they beat the dolphins the week before, does it not count what the fuck is drinking and drive and have to do with whether, you know, you beat the dolphins or not? I don't, I don't get that. Like, so now all these players that played for Penn state who now sit around probably get together every couple of years for union. Amen. At that time we played Clemson, you know, sitting there with a cigar and scarred up knees and they want to tell a war story. Oh yeah. That doesn't count anymore. Why? Because somebody fuck the kid. I didn't, you didn't, nobody played the game. Did nobody did. Yeah. Can I at it happened during the game and they played the game around the crime. I mean, it's a fucking horrible crime, but I, I think what they're trying to do is just a race, Joe fraternals name off of any all time a list. They don't want his name up there. You know what I mean? And, um, I dunno, I just don't think it's, it's, uh, I don't think that that's right. I think that those victories should count.

Speaker 1:          00:12:07       Yeah,

Speaker 4:          00:12:08       he fucking won those games. That doesn't make any sense of what the fuck is going out there on outside. You know what, I'll write out the winter, they've got a couple of coast guard and thinks and has probably some fucking idiots went out on a god damn dinghy every year. Some stupid fucking kids do that. Right. And they had the stupid a memorial little Stevie sure. Rip By and uh, Mike, uh, mark and which, you know, they was going to do that shit and just have some sort of like a, whenever there's a tragedy you got to have some sort of like metaphor, you know, water is, uh, it's the liquid of life. It, where did a Stevie, she rep Mike Berkowitz went out of their diggy. Uh, they realized that that uh, life nectar could also be a,

Speaker 4:          00:13:01       I really talked myself in a corner here, have an I how they fucking drought and uh, we found the raft that would be the worst doing that. Um, I don't know dude. It's just been a brutal fucking week. I feel bad for Penn state players. I feel bad for their fans cause I feel like they getting punished too and they didn't do a fucking thing. Okay. It's a great fucking football program and it's fucking, I can't even wrap my head around that. Joe Paterno was involved in that. I mean this is the biggest sports mind fucks since Oj Simpson, you gotta stand. Oj To me was, you know, was the juice 2000 yards in a 14 game season. Um, those hertz rental car commercials, Monday night football, I even watched this bad movies like when he played that astronaut and it didn't make it to the moon and then they tried to kill him, you know, and the two white astronauts coast, they killed Oj cause that's how it always worked back then.

Speaker 4:          00:13:56       If you watched any def jam comedy, they'll let you know the black I always died and those movies right through the naked gun and then out of nowhere he's on trial for a fucking double murder and he's got to look on his face like, yes, I did this shit. How do I get out of this? Um, this is the biggest, I think, mindful as far as like who you thought somebody was and then what the fuck they were involved in. It's just brutal and there's nothing funny about it. So let's move on. Let's move on. Um, all right, let's continue with this sports.

Speaker 1:          00:14:28       Okay.

Speaker 4:          00:14:29       Uh, as of right now, Dwight Howard isn't a Laker, but if Dwight Howard goes to the Lakers, you know, in Colby wins his sixth championship, I am not going to engage in that argument that he's now equaled Michael Jordan. Anybody who comes up to me, I am, as you say, comes out of your mouth. I'm going to kick you right in the balls. All right. Look, you know, this is the steroid era in baseball. There has to be the pylon era. You got to put that in there. Okay. Michael Jordan won six championships with Bill Cartwright and Luc Longley as his fucking centers. How long do you think Colby Bryant would tolerate that before he demanded a trade. Okay. This guy won three championships, was Shaquille. He got Shaquille O'Neal and Phil Jackson.

Speaker 4:          00:15:24       He got them brought to his team and I know what you think of. Well, Michael Jordan had Phil Jackson. Phil Jackson was nobody. He became a legend coach and Michael Jordan. Okay. And I'm not taking anything away from this guy, but when the Bulls got him, it wasn't like, oh, they got Phil Jackson. This guy knows how to win. He was nobody. He was an ex nick who want it and 73 as a player. That was it. He came in with is, hey man, fucking Afro and mustache. That was it. Okay. And Chicago was rebuilding. Oh, they had Scottie Pippin. He came from this system. All right. They signed Dennis Rodman. One fucking guy.

Speaker 2:          00:16:07       Okay.

Speaker 4:          00:16:08       They won with fucking Bill Cartwright, Luke Longly, Bj Armstrong, that Mormon with the blonde hair.

Speaker 2:          00:16:18       Okay.

Speaker 4:          00:16:19       Before Jordan came along, it was considered impossible to win without a fucking big name center. You had to get a big name center. You had to, okay, the guy totally changed the fucking game. And I'm so sick of these fucking bean counters who go, well, he has six gib chips, ed, he has five. Therefore, if he gets one world championship, it is the same thing. It's like all these people who watched, uh, whoever the fuck it was break Dan Marino's passing record and they don't even look at the fact of all the passing rules changes. I mean, they say that hitting a curve balls. The toughest thing in sports, I think at this point covering a receiver is because you've basically essentially made it a legal past five yards down the fucking field are out. Jesus, he's on a soapbox. He's on his soapbox. All right, so now if Dwight Howard goes to the fucking Lakers, it's just like, I don't get, I tweeted about this, like the amount of shit that the Miami Heat got for having a pylon championship.

Speaker 4:          00:17:16       Coby Brian has been part of a pile on fucking team from about 1999 on, that's all I'm saying. Okay. And I don't want you to take a, well, Boston did it in 2008 yes they did. That was a pylon championship team. I don't look at that team like, that's like the 86 Celtics or the 84 team. I don't, okay. I wasn't a fan of what went ha, what happened there either, you know, but doing it once versus doing it every year for 15 fucking years. You mean? You know you're making a pile on team and like the NBA in and blocks

Speaker 2:          00:17:50       of fucking trade. You know when even they're sitting there going like, all right guys, this is getting a little fucking ridiculous. Don't you think? You know what I mean? Ah, I'll get a ton of shit for that too. All right, let's just, let's just get it. Let's just read Christ. I'm all over the Goddamn map here. Let's just read something. Advice here. Advice. Uh, 37 and at the end of the love road, Jesus Christ, I thought we were going to pull out of the fucking dirt here. Hey Bill, I'm 37 years old and I've never had sex with a woman I've been in love with. Oh, I thought you said he never had sex. I was just gonna be like, all right dude. Well that's a wrap. A dream is over. Or just go out and get yourself a hooker. All right?

Speaker 2:          00:18:30       And like the thickest fucking condom ever. Um, anyways, I'm 37 years old and I've never had sex with a woman. Don't you hate on these fucking Max when just some application just keeps, what? Why is it just keep bouncing up and down? I see you. It's like the fucking nerd in the back of the class who? I know the answer. I know the answer. Um, I'm 37 years old and I've never had, I've never had sex with a woman I've been in love with or liked strongly. I've fallen in love with many beautiful young women over my long run by my deduction is that I become a total social retard with those chemicals when those chemicals are coursing through me by chase a girl, if I chase a girl, she's turned off when I'm indifferent. I do. All right.

Speaker 1:          00:19:16       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:19:16       That's good. That basically means you're coming on too strong dude. It's like a burner turned down the Gasol though. Do you know, are you showing up with like fucking flowers and candy with your hair parted down the middle the first fucking day? Yeah. You're going to freak her out. Um, anyways. One, I'm indifferent. I do. All right. I've kicked a number of women out of my bed and life after they've made the smallest infraction. One girl had the greatest sense of humor and had a perfect athletic body. I threw, I threw her out one night because she was eating chicken wings in my bed.

Speaker 1:          00:19:50       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:19:51       Only because I didn't have that. Um, only because I didn't have that emotion that made me want to chase her down or keeper. Otherwise, I think she was great. You broke up with a girl because he was eating chicken wings in bed. How was your lock? The door test? Um,

Speaker 1:          00:20:08       yeah,

Speaker 2:          00:20:09       of course. Now I get that love feeling less and less frequently as I get older and my failure to grow mature with the woman over the years has given me an Anthony Kumi, a complex, I only want young fit chicks. But now after years of living with a void in my social life and being daily devoted to girls of the Internet, I finally fell for another real girl, a young professional personal trainer who joined my beach volleyball team. I'll fuck you with your hot ass. Ah, Jesus. Look at this fucking guy. He probably looks like a fucking James Bond. The other chicken, our team tried to convince that this new girl

Speaker 4:          00:20:48       was interested in me. Oh yeah. All these chicks trying to help you out. What is she was blowing you? Uh, the new girl was showing signs of flirtation, but when I made a move, she fell silent. I am an old man. My question to you is, since hand guns are illegal and very hard to find outside of the urban areas of my country, of Canada, should I get a sling shot and shoot myself over and over in the head with acorns until I'm dead? Or at least until I am particularly, I am less particular about what kind of vagina falls onto my cock.

Speaker 1:          00:21:20       MMM.

Speaker 4:          00:21:22       Yeah. Dude, you got, you got, you got to make a pick here. You 37 years old, you're drafting in the later rounds. She's still trying to pick up a blue chip. It ain't there. I don't know. I don't know what to tell you. You can take a risk on one, but you know, I think, uh,

Speaker 1:          00:21:37       okay.

Speaker 4:          00:21:38       Yeah, I think you've got to look at the douchey qualities that yourself and realize that they're putting up with you on whatever the fuck it is that you do.

Speaker 1:          00:21:46       You know?

Speaker 4:          00:21:48       Um, you're only 37 years old. Fortunately that's still young. Back in the day, you know, Ben Franklins Day, you'd look like you were 106 and it would be over and you'd have fucking tuberculosis, you know, wheezing that you never fucking found love. So you're fine. You're playing volleyball. You just sound like an in shape guy who keeps banging all these hotties. But woe is me. Can't find love. You know what? Go Fuck yourself and your awesome life,

Speaker 1:          00:22:11       Huh?

Speaker 4:          00:22:12       You can't find love and you're all fucking, you just, Oh, I just keep fucking one personal 22 year old personal trainer after another. This is a problem. Look, if you want to find love, I, I would, uh, I would stay single until you found it.

Speaker 1:          00:22:27       You know,

Speaker 4:          00:22:28       I think you like women just being infatuated with you and playing with your hair and telling you how amazing you are as you can.

Speaker 5:          00:22:33       No, no.

Speaker 4:          00:22:35       And then he keeps saying, yeah, look at you. You're not that old. You still have four abs. Right. I think you like all of that. I think you'll like that fucking attention. I saw a guy like that this weekend, right? So hanging out with the lovely Nia, we went to this Mexican restaurant and this guy shows up, right dress like Arnold Schwarzenegger. And when he lost a little bit of weight and he was promoting terminator two on our [inaudible] Hall and he came out in that Leather Ensemble, uh, that's how the guy was dressed. Any comes in with this? Absolutely fucking smoking.

Speaker 1:          00:23:08       Okay.

Speaker 4:          00:23:09       I don't know. Brazilian are meaning out of Iranian. I don't know what the fuck she was fucking smoking hot chick with like this lime green. I don't even know what I gotta know what the fuck she was wearing it like, you know, showed like her fucking flat stomach, her fucking round ass. Yeah, I was checking. I think it's one of those girls you can check out right in front of your girlfriend and she doesn't give a shit. You know, she's like checking her out too, like at the end, but pitches hot. Um, so the bartender cards, the guy was, she loves because

Speaker 2:          00:23:46       he thinks it means that he thinks that he's fucking 21 you know, the guy looked like he was 50 and he just goes, he's like my friend, he goes, how we'll do that guy. Yet he has this big cheesy date rapes smile with his awful fucking beard. And he's just like, how old do you think I am? Right. And the guy goes, I don't know, 35 right. And the Nia goes like, fucking like, you know, like goes, makes us gesture of like way higher way. I fucking burst out laughing, but I don't think the guy saw, because he was so full of them that he actually didn't realize that this kid was just working for his tip. It's like, dude, you look like you're 50. And he goes and he's like, I am 48. You seem like one of those guys, like you're out there hooking up with them. So I would say stop being such as self involved, douchebag and realize that you have faults yourself. Get over yourself. All right. You're actually starting to cause your cause just starting to slip into those. Uh, I'm not getting, you know, you're in your David Hasselhoff ears. Who's kidding? Who.

Speaker 3:          00:24:51       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:24:52       But you know, if you're going to be in those years and you haven't found love, you're doing it the best way ever. Banging personal trainers and a volleyball players. Um, in any ways. That's, that's the picture that you painted yourself. You could be a tub of shit cause you are playing volleyball in Canada. I mean,

Speaker 4:          00:25:09       I don't know how many weeks a year you can do that up there. I can't tell if this is like the picture that you painted is who you really are or if you're in even bigger psycho and you actually don't look like that, but that's how you picture yourself. Um, yeah. I, I would, my advice would be get over yourself and realize that, um,

Speaker 3:          00:25:28       you know,

Speaker 4:          00:25:30       I know. Yeah, I'm talking myself into circles. I have no fucking idea. Oh, do you know I ruined a woman's Day at the mall. I just remembered that this woman in a wheelchair.

Speaker 3:          00:25:40       Okay.

Speaker 4:          00:25:41       I ruined a woman, an old woman in a wheelchair his day at the mall and it's been killing me for like the last two days is what happened.

Speaker 4:          00:25:51       Me and Nia, we were leaving the mall, the mall. Okay. And we wait for the elevator opened. The elevator opens and all you see is this beautiful babies. This the first thing you see when the doors open is this baby laying in a, in a stroller looking up big blue eyes. One of those Gerber looking babies, right. And me and Ian both go ah, second we see. But like how are you doing? You know, talking like baby talk to it and saying the mother, how good looking the kid is and all that type of shit. And with Gugu Gaga and about the fucking baby. And she gets off the doors open when the door is open, the first thing we see is this old lady in a wheelchair being pushed by some lady and you know they back up and the woman with the baby gets off the elevator and then the woman starts pushing the old lady in to the elevator and she's go, is this going up?

Speaker 4:          00:26:39       Is it going up? I'm going, it's going down. And it's one of those things that's like tension because the doors are starting to close. So even though I keep saying it's going down, the ladies not hearing me cause all she's focusing on is the door she says is going up, is it going up? It's gone down, it's going to. And I finally got, it's going down like I yelled over the fucking old lady's head so the old lady looks up, she just goes, okay, thank you. And I totally knew in that moment that she was just like, you were talking to her like I wasn't even here. You didn't even can acknowledge that I was here. And I realized that in that moment, and I don't know why I think it was cause I was talking to a baby, I was still ice and she was like fragile to my brain.

Speaker 4:          00:27:21       Went back to talking to the baby and I just looked at her and I went, as the doors were closing, I was soon, okay, bye bye. I said it just like that. And I waved to her like she was a baby. I don't know why I did it. And then the door closed and I immediately, I immediately looked down at the floor and shame and Nia, it was one of the hardest I ever heard her laugh. She just turned around and face the back of the elevator and was laughing to the point she couldn't even like get the words out to ask me why. I just did that. She kept just going like, like she just kept getting out the why part and I just kept going. I don't know. I don't know why. Just did that. I stuck my hand out right in her face.

Speaker 4:          00:28:03       You know, you wave to a baby. I did that. I went, okay, bye bye. Towards closed. And I know she was probably thinking either I was mocking her or that I felt that she wasn't mentally there anymore and I knew that she was, and I just feel like shit. And um, the reality is is I could've written the elevator back up and tried to explain myself, but I didn't, I just walked in shamed in my Prius. Um, yeah, it was just a fucking weird week. The whole fucking week was just weird. I have one of the worst nightmares I've ever had in my life last night I was laying in bed. It's one of those dreams where like this something trying to get me, but it's like,

Speaker 1:          00:28:48       yeah,

Speaker 4:          00:28:49       it's like sort of envy. It's like a force. He's trying to get me, I know it's going to get me and I can't fight it or get away from it. And I'm just like, even like the dream, I'm like laying in bed and I can't fucking move. And then in the end, all of a sudden this fucking woman appears like, just kinda like, like a ghost, but it looks like a person. Right. And, uh, I have my hands clasped together and she's like,

Speaker 4:          00:29:19       she had like fucking, uh, like reddish hair, but like, you know, the uncle and hot chicks dye their hair red. They're not real red heads like that. Like almost like a fucking, I dunno, like a page boy kind of haircut. She's like a rocket ship. She had tattoos and like this tank top on Nice titties and I'm sitting there and I had my hands class and she clasp hands around my hands and she looked me right in the eye and goes, you're going to kill yourself one day. And then she just disappeared and it fucking freaked me out. Obviously. She goes, you're going to kill yourself one day with this look on her face. Like either she knew or she definitely knew and that she had killed herself and I was going to join her wherever the fuck she isn't in the afterlife. And uh, I was so fucking scared. It actually woke me up and I wouldn't open my eyes because I also be afraid that she was going to be standing there waiting to class my fucking hands again.

Speaker 2:          00:30:21       How freaky Zen. Now let me ask you this because you know,

Speaker 4:          00:30:27       I think about killing myself, but I do it in a very mainstream fucking way. Like, you know, okay, bye. Bye. When the doors close, I wanted to kill myself. I wanted the elevated a land on me, but I don't really want to kill myself. So what the fuck does that dream mean? Anybody wants to do? Um,

Speaker 1:          00:30:49       okay.

Speaker 4:          00:30:50       And I don't believe in go see them. I think the reason why I had that dream was because last night I turned out all the lights and I, and I got a little freaked out because, uh, my room right is right near the water

Speaker 2:          00:31:02       and it was this really weird reflection and uh, I had some weird shadows and stuff. So what I always do when I get freaked out like that is this is the stupidest thing ever is I give the finger to the shadow. That's what I do. It's something I learned when I was a kid because if it is a monster, it's not going to put up with that. Right? It's immediately going to come over and do something to me. So if I give it the finger and it doesn't do anything that when I was a kid it just let me know that it wasn't a monster or that it was a fucking pussy and it wasn't, it didn't have it in it, you know, it didn't have that killer instinct and it was just going to, it was just good to just stay over there in the corner, which I was fine with.

Speaker 2:          00:31:46       You know, you can spend the night, just don't come over here and kill me. That was basically it. So I did that. I still do it to this day and I, I do it. It kinda has a joke and it makes me laugh for some reason I was thinking about that chicken, the ring, just what their fucking hair popping up and doing something to me have you do that? You just mind fuck yourself. And I was like, all right, I have 10 seconds to get into the bed or that chick from the ring is going to appear and fucking kill me, you know? So I got my

Speaker 4:          00:32:15       self in this anxious state, I think before I went to sleep. And then I ended up having this goddamn nightmare and she fucking class both my hands and goes, you can you kind of kill yourself one day. And I just sat there laying, they'd go, I'm not going to kill myself.

Speaker 1:          00:32:33       Okay.

Speaker 4:          00:32:34       Don't open your eyes. That freak you out. Well, what gives a fuck? It's been a weird fucking week, you know, that awful tragedy out there. And uh, Colorado, you know, was driving him in my truck. All I have is fucking a am radio and um, and so all I could eat, you know, and that's all they were talking about on talk radio. And I'm one of those guys. Once I see it, it's fucking horrific. I know. I don't want to hear about it anymore. I don't want to know the kid's name and know what his face looks like just in case he's trying to get famous. I just, you know,

Speaker 1:          00:33:05       yeah,

Speaker 4:          00:33:06       it's just fucking awful. Right. But all I could listen to on the radio, that's all they were talking about. And these fucking people calling in every God there. One of them. It's just saying the same fucking thing over and over again. It's like, who doesn't know that it's terrible? Who doesn't know that it's not a tragedy? Who isn't going to send prayers out to the fucking family? Why do they got to keep calling up? It's fucking guy calling up yet I believe, and I have the, I believe in a hell and uh, this guy, he's a, he's deed all. If I, if I was running deck, z would definitely shot that. We got it.

Speaker 1:          00:33:45       Okay.

Speaker 4:          00:33:46       The fuck you calling up for? I Dunno. It just fucking, it became annoying after awhile. And, and then the talk show hosts just wanting to keep it going.

Speaker 1:          00:33:57       Okay.

Speaker 4:          00:33:57       It was like no other way to say it was a tragedy and he just kept piling on is a, it's bad for families. It's bad for, it's bad for the nation and the dead and the freedoms that we, uh, we, we give people at level, but the lab, but the public, well then the NRA always has to immediately pylon after somebody uses a gun. Like this doesn't mean the gun dated gun didn't do it, person did it just just letting you know, just in case you thought in an inanimate object could somehow do shit on its own, you know?

Speaker 1:          00:34:27       Okay.

Speaker 4:          00:34:27       And then they always come up with the brilliant, what if everybody had it was allowed to have a gun then that wouldn't have happened. Yeah. I think that that guy would have killed less people, but I think a lot more other people would have got killed getting shot in the back of the fucking head is people tried to shoot that person. Right. I'm not against guns by the way, but like, you know, look, everybody can have a driver's license. How many people really are good at driving? You know what I mean? Hi, people are good at sports. I don't feel have good hand eye coordination. Do you want these fucking people with guns and all of a sudden somebody starts squeezing off some rounds and those motherfuckers are between you and the guy shooting at you and you're not organized at all.

Speaker 1:          00:35:06       Yeah.

Speaker 4:          00:35:07       You know when, when like 10 cops going in store my house, they know where the fuck they're at for a reason. So they don't shoot each other in the back. If you got a bunch of people in a goddamn movie with fucking glocks and somebody comes in and start shooting, I mean, it's going to be a fucking, it's gonna be even worse.

Speaker 1:          00:35:26       Okay?

Speaker 4:          00:35:26       I think what they should do is,

Speaker 1:          00:35:29       okay,

Speaker 4:          00:35:29       there's gotta be two, two, two levels. You have to pass to get a gun. Okay? Aside from not being a psycho, you should, when you get a gun, you should then have to become a fucking marksman. All right? And if you're not a marksman, then it affects the caliber of gun that you get. This actually makes a lot of sense. All right? It's like taking the driver's test. You can't go there blind as a bat and they just give you a fucking goddamn car. Like they'll go fuck yourself, go down a Pearle vision and get your game together. They should do the same thing with guns. Okay, I want to get a gun license. So God bless America. You can have one go over there, the gun range, and now go shoot at that silhouette over there. Right?

Speaker 6:          00:36:14       Yeah.

Speaker 4:          00:36:14       You know, if you only hit it once she get a BB gun or maybe one of those little toy guns that that shoots the plastic things. So you could still put somebody's eye out though with it, you know? But if you actually go down there when you're, you're a fucking goddamn maniac, right. Psycho fucking, you know, just everything's a headshot or center mass. Then you get the glock.

Speaker 6:          00:36:39       Right.

Speaker 2:          00:36:41       Does that make sense? Can you just have a safe word?

Speaker 6:          00:36:45       Yeah.

Speaker 4:          00:36:45       Just something the guy yells, when would shit like that and everybody hits the fucking deck and this guy gets up and just puts too right in the fucking psychos head and it's over as oppose to just letting everybody just start fucking shooting.

Speaker 6:          00:37:00       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:37:01       Would that make sense? Oh, if everybody just thought the way I did the world would be a just as fucked up. All right. Anyways, but what kind of people have to fucking call up?

Speaker 6:          00:37:14       Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:37:15       During a tragedy and you just have to call up and you just have to reiterate that it was a fucking tragedy.

Speaker 6:          00:37:21       Okay?

Speaker 2:          00:37:22       You have to call up and say that, I think this guy's going to hell. Like who? Who doesn't think that

Speaker 6:          00:37:27       you know,

Speaker 2:          00:37:29       fucking idiots watching this fucking politicians stammering.

Speaker 6:          00:37:36       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:37:36       Through, so you know, family is the love to put, we asked. We got it. It's fucking horrible. Just get on with punishing this guy. Go hang that guy by his fucking toes. They won't, they're going to go through some big nine fucking year of trial with this guy.

Speaker 6:          00:37:53       Okay.

Speaker 4:          00:37:53       And then did they try to like, they try to blame guns or they tried to blame the fucking movie and she's a white tee. He's out of his fuck. I can guarantee before you waste all this money

Speaker 2:          00:38:02       doing all of these studies, this guy, he's out of his fucking mind.

Speaker 6:          00:40:32       okay,

Speaker 2:          00:40:33       two shades below Dr Dr Phil. That's how bad I am at this. Okay. That wasn't pumping me up. That was dragging him down. Uh, my friend recently broke up with a girl. He's been dating for awhile and wouldn't, and when you know it, this girl is the tips. I've been friendly with this guy for almost a year in his girls, was always with us when we hung out a Jesus. All right. I can tell you right now, just go ahead and Banger and say goodbye to your friendship. Um, from the moment I met her, I've liked her and wanted to bang her. Oh wait, but you just want a fucker.

Speaker 4:          00:41:10       Uh, dude, this is dirty. This is dirty.

Speaker 2:          00:41:14       The kind of girl I imagine when I think of a girl, I would want to have a relationship with. Go Fuck Yourself. You said you wanted a banger first or you like some sadistic guy who just wants to uh, fuck this girl and fucker better than your friend so you can just be behind it going, yeah, you lay dead bitch. Yeah. You liked it. You one of those guys. He's trying to paint a good picture here, but I'm not buying it. Classy. Attractive. Funny. The whole Shebang. Dude. Right off the bat, the first thing you said was you wanted to bang banger.

Speaker 2:          00:41:44       I Dunno. You're trying to be funny. I'll give you the benefit of the doubt. Let's plow ahead. Uh, I've even developed feelings, feelings, question mark. I know that's gay. Fuck you. Uh, for her axial guys, we just can't, we just, we're not allowed. I actually liked this girl actually feel like I could spend, like, I can't even say that without having that. Ah, oh my God. Fucking tone in my voice. Um, let me see if I can just say it. How I say I really liked this girl. I think I could spend my life with her. Okay. That just sounded like a bad read. There's no way to say it without feeling like. I just feel like I just really connect with her.

Speaker 2:          00:42:24       Ah, go fuck yourself. Ah. I've even developed feelings for her quickly. I liked hanging out with her whenever she tagged along. I never flirted with her or anything like that, but I did rubber muff under the table. Come on, dude. You leave in some shit out. He didn't say that last part, but come on, but we did get along pretty well. I would and still do. Think about her all the time. Some real grade school crush type shit. Now they've broken up and she's single and ready presumably to do some revenge banging. Yeah, dude, you're a piece of shit, but God bless you. She was hot enough. I probably do it. No, I wouldn't.

Speaker 2:          00:43:01       My younger days I would. I wouldn't. Maybe I would. I don't know. I'm not going to judge you anyways. See where I'm going with this. Yeah. I saw where you were going with it from the second I started reading it. Anyway, unlike most guys, I don't want to just bang this broad. I want, I want to be with her, do the whole boyfriend thing, but I know doing so would break one of the most important rules of male friendship. Never fuck your friends girl. However, the power of pussy has be thinking that's crazy and that the best and that's the best thing for me to do. However, the power of pussy has me thinking that's crazy and that the best thing for me to do is wait four to six months until things settled down and see if she feels the same way that I do.

Speaker 2:          00:43:42       I'm not sure if she will, but I'm willing to try and find out despite the ramifications. What do I do, Bill? Should I go after this awesome, awesome girl risking my friendship or do I go bros before hoes? Forget her and wait for the next four. Do Juror a or am I just bat shit crazy? Um, AH, Jesus dude. Like I can't figure you out. You sitting here talking like you Gugu Gaga and then you're also just saying like, you just kind of want a banger. All right, this is what I'm going to tell you. Okay. Rather than just telling you what I'm going to tell you that this is what I'm going to tell you before telling you that thus eating up more time in this horrific podcast. This is the sad thing about getting older. Okay. When your friends get older and they get married

Speaker 4:          00:44:33       and they have kids, you barely see him anymore. It sucks. Okay. And if they have some, if they married some fucking Douche bag who you know the in the and, and they, and they just gave their balls away in the relationship. He had never gonna see him again. But if they actually have a cool life who lets them go out and hang out with the Fellas, you still only going to see each other once in a while. You got to raise kids. So in the long run, if you feel like this girl might be the one you got to do what you can't, you're gonna regret it for the rest of your life. But if this is just some sadistic shit where it was, she was, you just wanted to bang her cause she was around, you know, and you saw like, it's just like, dude, I gotta tell you if you bang that girl and afterwards you're not feeling anything dude.

Speaker 4:          00:45:20       It's like now she's got something on you and if she's a psycho and if they had a bad breakup, you can better fucking believe. Like that's like that's chicks ways of getting back at guys. Like they'll go out and fuck their friends. Um, I mean just, I mean you weren't just like Hell hath no fury as they say, like a woman's scorn. And if it's a bad breakup, like women, they want to throw all your shit out in the front lawn, light it on fire. Okay. And that's not enough to fucking go after you material things. Okay. That's what they want to do. They want to leave you with and then we'll go on and go bang all your fucking friends and then let you know about it. So then you lose all your friends, you lose your entire wardrobe. You standing there like a flood victim just tearing up as it starts to rain, as you stand on the fucking front porch at some dilapidated fucking three family house, that's how they want to leave you.

Speaker 4:          00:46:20       They're fucking nuts, some of them. Okay. So you know the deal, dude, you're stepping in Shit, you're looking at a field, you know, it's a minefield and you want to walk across in any ways because there's a woman at the other side of it, which this is a classic Shakespearian tale about ready to unfold. So, and I can say that having never read Shakespeare, I tried to read it. It's more complicated than the Bible. Um, I, you know, I don't know, Dude. I don't you, you have to. You got to figure out where the fuck you're at with this shit. All right. Do you really like this girl? Do you really think she's the one or was she just around long enough that you just were thinking about them and you, you know, looking at a Tan fucking thighs are a fucking titties or a God damn mouth to something and just like, I'd be one or would it be like, you know, and you just sat there doing that the whole fucking time.

Speaker 4:          00:47:17       There always is that excitement that all your guy friends have when you break up with a hot girl. Cause they're all like, Oh God, I always wanted to fuck that girl. A Jesus Christ. All right. And you guys have that conversation with each other and that's how you fucking talk a bunch of pirates. You sit day. Do you hear, uh, Mike and Joanne broke up? Can you believe that? Yeah, it's fucking crazy. And then you guys sit there and then there's that half second pause and you both just start laughing because you don't like do it. We can't, we can't. Oh Geez. I would love to. I would love to. Uh, I won't say anything you don't fuck is anything. It's just, it's fucking brutal. It's brutal. And then the guys all insecure because this is the bottom line is if, you know, that's why you don't bring your girl around, you don't bring your girl on it because you do it enough. You're good guy. Friends are gonna want to fuck her, you know, and then she kind of gets to know them. And then did you already do that stupid fucking phone call when you call? Hey, you know, just calling up just to say, I'm sorry you guys broke up. I thought you guys look great together. Blah blah, blah, blah, blah. Right.

Speaker 2:          00:48:18       Try to catch her in that week fucking moment. Did you do that, your Predator? Ah, we all have, um, that is a shitstorm sir. There's no, uh, there's no way out of that. Um, and there's no way you're going to wait six to eight months because if the girl hot enough in six to eight months, she's already going to have somebody else. And if you come back around again, it's going to be like her going backwards. So there, see what I did? I just lit a candle under your ass to go fucking do it. Oh, it gives a shit. Let me know how it works out. Uh, advice. Friend's girlfriend is a bitch. Haven't I already given an advice over this thing? I've given this advice a Zillion fucking times. I'm a high school senior and in three weeks with me in three weeks, me and my friends are going backpacking through Australia for a month and a half. We've been planning this trip since middle school and I have saved for the past five years because I am paying for my share of the trip myself. We're both psych to graduate from high school and for this trip, dude, I hope you have the most, the only way I would backpack through Australia is if they made thigh high hooker fucking snake boots.

Speaker 6:          00:49:27       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:49:27       They got like some of the deadliest snakes on the planet.

Speaker 6:          00:49:31       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:49:31       They've got that Tai pan where the fuck it is. They got the uh, nothing got black Mambas out there. Those ones you get bit like in the second it get registered that the pain of getting bit, you like collapsed.

Speaker 6:          00:49:43       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:49:44       Yeah. Fuck all that. All right dude. We'll have fun with that. This sounds like one of those trips where somebody ends up dying and then somebody goes on trial for possibly murdering the other person and then they get off and then the, but there's always that wonderment of what really happened whenever Americans go to Australia, somebody dies. Remember that guy who was on the honeymoon and went scuba diving and his wife got eaten by a shark?

Speaker 6:          00:50:08       Yeah,

Speaker 2:          00:50:09       yeah, I remember that one or something weird. Or they went deep sea. A fucking snorkeling.

Speaker 6:          00:50:14       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:50:15       I would say right now, if you're a fucking woman and a, if you're a lady, um, and you're on it, you're going on a honeymoon. If it involves fucking scuba diving, so any sort of going out to the ocean, that's it. It's over. Call off the wedding. All right. Call it off. Nothing good comes from that. He's either going to get drunk and fall overboard or he's going to shut the air valve off.

Speaker 3:          00:50:46       Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:50:47       Don't go on a cruise. You know? And if you do, you do not go up on deck unless there's plenty of witnesses around. Fuck that. Moonlight kissing. Fuck all that. That's when you go off the back of the boat. She was just, she wanted to reach down and touch the water. I don't know what happened. No body, no nothing. Ah, fuck that. Hey billion. I'm a high schools. All right. So anyways, they're going to Australia. My friend and I have known each other since we were three and our families are very close. He's like, he's like a brother to me and we've often confided in each other and ask each other for relationship advice. Whoever. Lee recently, my friend had started dating this girl who has put a huge rift in our relationship. Congratulations. He's met his first psycho. You guys are really high school age. I don't think this is going to be that big a deal. The girl my friend is dating is a total whore. She's ignorant and jealous and generally has an unattractive personality. They've only been dating for two months, but she feels like she owns him. She found out that my friend and I were going on this trip and has been rude to me ever since. Yeah, she's insecure. She's young. Um, and she's fucking a lot of guys. It stayed, it started with just snipping remarks, elevated over time,

Speaker 2:          00:52:00       blah, blah, blah. But this is just going to be the usual shit. The other night we were all at a party. She got hammered. She came up to me, started shoving me and told me that my ghetto pussy wasn't going to seduce her boyfriend. What his comment probably had something to do with the fact that I'm black and her boyfriend is white though I was seeing red. I tried not to sucker punch that bitch in the face. He had dude, dude, don't, don't ever do that. Uh, I've boxed and kickbox for the past three years and I'm pretty sure I could have stopped the yard all over. Yeah, Dude. What the fuck? Where did that come from? I think the fact that you're a guy, you could pretty much beat up most women's, so, which is why you don't do it. You know, it's like running up the score and a college game.

Speaker 2:          00:52:43       Uh, I told her to calm down. I have never done anything with my friend and have no desire. Intentions of anything happened in Aussie land. She kept yelling and screaming and making a scene eventually. Oh, so she's basically calling you gay in front of all your friends at a party and you're at a high school level. Yeah. That's kind of a, that's a situation. Eventually I just gave up trying to reason with the drunk broad and I left naturally. I told my friend what she said. He agreed it was absolutely unacceptable and had a talk with her that turned into a fight. My friends girl gave him an ultimatum, me or her and for forbade him from going to Australia. This is absolutely hilarious to me, which it should be. Since they're fight, my friend hasn't called or texted me. What should

Speaker 4:          00:53:25       I do? You know what? Fuck him. Fuck him. Let him learn the lesson. You know what you do? You go down there with your fucking American accent. All right, and you're going to get more fucking pussy than you could ever shake a God damn sticker, a walking stick act. All right. To keep it in, in a hiking sense here. All right, fuck him. And then you come back and just, you know, let him be with that whore. Wash your fucking hands of it, okay? You Go. I invested a lot of time, effort, and money into this trip. I'm not going to have the beginning of my senior year destroyed by some skank phase control freak, lush, which you shouldn't, but I also don't want to hurt my friend and have and have them be miserable when we're going to be stuck living, sleeping, traveling together for six weeks.

Speaker 4:          00:54:11       Hey, fuck them. This is the deal. Fuck him. Fuck him. Okay? He wants to be with that horror. Let them be with that whore. Get on with your fucking life. He wants to go with you to Australia. Let them, if he doesn't, if he wants to stay back there with that psycho, let them let, he has to learn this lesson the same way. You got to let a toddler fucking slam his head off the God damn coffee table. Different, understand gravity or at least putting his little fat baby arms out. You know, you gotta, you gotta let this dude fall right on his fucking face. All right, let's hope he's wearing a condom, but he's old enough to know how people get pregnant. So you know, give me a fucking break. Fuck this shit. All right. That's it. Fuck him. Wash your hands of it.

Speaker 4:          00:55:03       It's over. All right. You go out, you enjoy your senior year, you go to Australia, he comes, he doesn't, you don't give a fuck. All right, that's on him. He wants to sit there and invest all his life and some stupid drunk skank phase control freak, lush as you call her. Let them, what the fuck do you care? Okay. She fucking embarrassed you. I mean you, you don't do that. You don't do that. I mean, one time I was dating this fucking girl and she was so fucking rude to one of my friends and that night I was like, I was beside myself and I was asking her how she could do something like that and she's just like, she was just like, I'm sorry I didn't like him. And I know it was the first time. I was just like, is that the most arrogant fucking thing ever?

Speaker 4:          00:55:48       And I'm not going to lie to you. It took me like another, like a week or two, but I, from that second on I just fucking pulled back and I was just like, you know what? Go Fuck yourself because you know that's the life you're gonna have. You're gonna have no, you're going to, all your friends are going to be gone. So fucker. All right. Did I say it enough time? Yeah. Fuck her. Um, dilemma. Um, all right. Number one at their physical peak, would you rather box Laila Ali or will Smith Will Smith? There's no winning with Laila Ali either lose to a check or beat one up. That was easy. I'll fight. Will Smith worse I can do is lose to an actor. But he used to rap, but he was mainstream rap. Right? But, but what was the ones that he had?

Speaker 4:          00:56:37       What the fuck was that? I know people who started about that summertime when I, I don't remember how that one went. I was too busy listening to metal with the fuck did he have back then? Parents just don't wonder. Don't understand. That's when like mainstream white people were finally discovering rap. That's what we did. We parents just don't understand. Can't touch this the worst of the worst, but go fuck yourself. African Americans. All right. I bet the first white music you listened to was, it was, it was awful, uh, with your hall and Oates. Um, anyways, uh, if, if you were a parent of a boy and a girl, would you rather see your son on to catch a predator? Jesus being national exposed as a pedophile or be driving down the street and see your daughter out on the corner of whoring yourself out as a prostitute, a prostitute. Prostitute. Yeah. Prostitute. There's nothing worse than fucking a kid, you know, I don't think it should change the outcome of who won a football game. Uh, but that's just me. A overrated, underrated, underrated. A scabies.

Speaker 4:          00:57:52       He's underrated. A great reason to launder. I don't even know what the fuck that means. I don't know what scabies it would launder. What money you're clothes. I don't even what you're saying there. Number two, pointing out, did I even pronounce that correctly? Um, to pointing out details about a steamy sex story that make it uncomfortable and unsexy. Jesus Christ. What's, what the fuck is this creek for example, hey baby, remember the other day when I bet you over the dining room chair and we raw dog did and you finished me off on your knees between the cat food dishes in the litter box. Your girlfriend expression will change from sexy to four horrified in zero to 60. Um, if you're the woman who's dating that guy, please break up with that fucking reptilian psycho.

If I went to church, how many fucking hail? Mary's a said, you know, stuff that I should go to confession and just tell that story just to see what the guy says. You know, cause I think they just make that stuff up to off this boy hail Marys back there drinking out of a chalice.

Speaker 4:          01:03:14       Who did that first? Those rappers in Atlanta or priests? Well I guess hip hop's only been around since. What did I just say? Hip Hop, I think I did since when? When did that actually come about? Was it in the early seventies is that what it was number one run DMC actually said that. Walk this way was the first rap. Remember that? Why did they say that? You know, did they run out of leather jacket? Uh, Shell toes? I was that was that fun running low when they actually said that, that wasn't the first Rep. Why would they say that? Did black people get mad at them when they said that shit? No one gives a fuck. You know what people, I don't think I have anything left. I was actually hoping that the red sox were going to be in town tonight cause I wanted to wear to head down there.

Speaker 4:          01:04:04       Um, even though I'm not drinking, I really want to drink. I ain't gonna lie to you people I really want to drink. I do. I haven't drank in a couple of weeks dry and myself out. You know, I get through the uh, the kid show that I'm going to be doing here. You gotta be known at this point that I'm not doing a fucking kid show is I'm sitting here talking about pedophiles saying bye bye to somebody in a wheelchair and saying that Joe Paterno is winds should still count in case you detective work. He was still questioning whether or not I'm actually going to be hosting some sort of revamp of a kid show. It ain't happening. Uh, actually get another acting gig. I'm doing all right. I'm doing all right on the old, the old acting gigs. Thanks. This is what it is, is perfect. It's the exact fucking reason why I moved out to La. I just wanted to start getting some parts in some shit.

Speaker 4:          01:04:57       You know, that's all I wanted to do. I don't need to be as, I just want to, I just want to be in a, just let me shoot a gun, gets shot to something. You know, I told you guys my acting, these are, these are my acting goals. I want to do that scene where you run down the alley and you're getting chased by cop and he get to the chain link fence and you get like three fucking crawls up at and they drag you back down. I want to do that. I want to get interrogated, I want to get shot. I'm going to get blown away. I want to get killed by a monster at some point. I want to be getting eaten or something. Just be gone. That's all I want to do. All right. I don't want to do gorillas in the mist. What the fuck are they counting down out there? I think these are like coast guard people learning how to be coast guard people outside this way. Hang on. What am I doing? Hang on, hang on, hang on, hang on it. Yeah. I think it's some sort of coast guard training thing out there. 10, nine a, you know, he's no one your boss in Boston when they get down to four,

Speaker 4:          01:06:06       six, five, four

Speaker 4:          01:06:11       actually heard somebody say, but is day I got breakfast she wants him to is with that. Uh, no, I don't. Trying to cut down on the carbs. All right, that's the podcast for this week. Um, go fuck yourselves. Don't take any shit. And uh, you know, I obviously wasn't, you know that. Who gives a fuck? I'm not gonna sit there and even try. What am I doing? I just said it wasn't an apologize for anything. Fucking Penn State's wins should count. Alright. Those fucking players played the Goddamn Games. They blew out their knees. They risk fucking injury. They won the Goddamn Games. All right? Just cause some old fuck was doing some shit that he should be burned in the street for. You shouldn't punish those fucking kids. I, Oh, Penn state sells out all their fucking games, you know, learn from Smu. All right, everybody just walk the fuck away.

Speaker 4:          01:07:00       You show up in force. That'd be the greatest fucking thing. You know how how unbelievable. If you want to somehow turn this fucking thing around Penn state fans is if every game over the next four years sells out, even if you lose every fucking game, okay, there's no other program out there. Could ever question your loyalty. That would be the greatest example of a fan support. Unlike these, some of these fucking red sox fans out here, 48 and 48 the fucking walking away, you know? See, that's the deal with most vans. They're not real fence. You know, you're like a marriage in sickness and in health, good times and bad. It doesn't work that way. The fans fans basically say, I love you until you suck and then I'm walking away. I'm going to leave you when you need me most just like that Kenny Rogers song phone with children cropping and they'll feel bad. We want 48 games the last 48 games and now you're leaving. You can't, you know what?

Speaker 2:          01:08:16       Get the fuck up. God bless John Lester. I know he doesn't want to lose. I love and Pedroia when we're fucking down like that and he's fucking powder him on the leg trying to get him psyched up. I love that shit. I love that as much as watching a wind. All right. And if you're walking away now you're a cunt and is Tom Cruise said in fucking taps takeoff that baret right. Poor Tom Cruise is fucking lady left them. I think everybody like comes down on Scientology. You know what I mean? What's the fucking problem with it? Until they have like a uh, uh, inquisition. I really don't think there anywhere as bad as my fucking religion. You know what I mean? We had like 58 Sandusky's running around doing that shit. Did they, did, was the Catholic church not allowed to go to a bowl game? Did they take away some of Jesus's miracles? They didn't. Those fucking games count down screaming in a hotel room.

Speaker 2:          01:09:14       Those fucking games count. Those kids won those games, those games count. I did stand up for the Penn state Nittany lions when they came out and they did the, when they were playing USC and the Rose Bowl, I did stand up for them and they were fucking, it was like performing for the troops. Pine tight. Everybody listening. I know you have a great set. Nobody heckled me. They were great. Great Bunch of guys. You're going to punish them. Go Fuck Yourself. All right. This is what I say. If you take away Penn state's victories, then you have to take away Jesus's miracles. Jesus miracles didn't count if Penn state's victories don't count. That's what I'm saying. That's my statement. I'm sticking to it. Go fuck yourselves. We'll talk to you next week.
