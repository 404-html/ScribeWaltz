Speaker 1:          00:09:40       You know, you decided you were getting a wig and then what you had to do was you had to leave town, okay.

They know you're in the bucket brigade, you start sweating.

Speaker 2:          00:11:19       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:11:20       Maybe one of the amber, Zara embers, whatever you say, fucking flies away from the fire and lands on top of that to pay. And then it's like, oh my God.

Speaker 2:          00:11:28       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:11:29       I thought watching those people screaming from that burning building was the most incredible thing I was going to see tonight until I saw your fucking wig catch on fire. Pull it off your fucking head. And you went from 26 to 48 right in front of my eyes. Who is his outlet outside or Honda's carpet bagger. Do you guys were a big deal?

Speaker 2:          00:12:01       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:12:01       You know, is this a serial killer? Is this person wanted, is this a war criminal? Did this person escaped from jail? Did they just robbed a bank?

Speaker 2:          00:12:11       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:12:11       Are they a scientologist? Are they a a Mormon?

When you get you walk down this tree, not worry about some motherfucker was somewhere. Look on his face. We are a string them up. Right. And then they fucking go down and they grabbed the mother fucker or they write as they put the rope around his head and he's screaming and yelling and he's like, alright, I've got a wig. I got her fucking wagon. That was it. And they took it off and all the towns, people laughed at him and they tarred and feathered the top of his head. The tide is fucking arms behind his back and they slapped that horse in the ass and he was on the way to the next fucking town. And that's the way it was. That's the way America was back in the day, you know. And you know, it's difficult as that is, it is a part of our history. It is kind of funny that people used to live a life like that.

Speaker 2:          00:13:36       Okay?

Speaker 1:          00:13:36       And you listened to what people complain about today and it all pales in comparison,

He usually go there and it's really intense fucking talking and all. It took me like two fucking Google searches to be like, yeah, that field doesn't exist. Even if that wasn't true, I want the guy was so fucking intense. It just annoyed me. It's like, why are you taking on the intensity of this battle as though you fought it? You didn't fight this fucking thing. All right, so why don't you bring your voice up a couple of fucking octaves still way you normally talk and these people, they came in Yangon. Hey Gay fucking shit. Like Tianya VFE this man beat this guy to death with a femur. Um,

Speaker 1:          00:14:42       if you're going to beat somebody death with, with a human bone, you'd think he'd want the femur. Yeah, I think he'd want the femur. If you could, if the guy was far enough away and you could get sort of extension. All right. Other than that, I, you gotta go humorous. Okay. It's the second biggest bone. It's an easier thing to swing. It's better. You know, you can kind of also jab somebody in the face with it. Famers a little too big for my tastes. You know, ladies, you might go with the radius and Ulna. You don't come in a little nunchuck thing. You can put some chains between the two of them. This is all things we're going to have to deal with in about, I guess 30 years with global warming. Um, there's the world goes to hell in a fucking hand basket. You know what's great about if you don't watch the news, you think everything's fine.

Speaker 2:          00:15:32       Okay?

Speaker 1:          00:15:32       It's a great experiment because I spent a lot of time paying attention to the news periods of my life and all I did was get freaked out and nothing changed and nothing got better. But if you don't pay attention and he just sit there and you just, I dunno.

Speaker 2:          00:15:49       Okay,

Speaker 1:          00:15:50       watch sports. You can't even watch sports cause they drag it into that shit. Now, every fucking five seconds somebody's dying or something and they're bringing a troop out of fucking firefighters. You know, I don't know. Something. There's always something. Hey, what do you enjoy in the game? Will let us remind you how lucky you are. We know how lucky we are. How many fucking times, Ladies and gentlemen, a direct your attention to section two oh three some guy who got attacked by a fucking pack, a wild fucking toads, Assam Shit.

Speaker 2:          00:16:40       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:16:40       Anyways, I'm going to fly a cello copter tomorrow. Can't wait, haven't done that in a minute. And uh, they'll do that early in the morning and then I'm going to go in and I'm gonna start working on this fucking script. That's what I'm going to do. Bill, how's the pull ups coming? We know you've been, your shoulders have been slowly disintegrating and you've been trying to build them up. Um, I actually lat pull downs, I'm up to 120 pounds, you know, which is huge. Coming back from rotator cuff fucking injury when you're in your 50. So all I need to do is be able to do like three sets of 15, and then I ought to be able to try one or two pull ups with my own body weight. That's what I've been told. All right, so I got a ways to go but a little bit of daylight there cause I got that bet with Versie the pride of New Jersey.

Speaker 2:          00:17:33       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:17:33       All right. The Newark Native, the uh, the Trenton Teetotaller, um, that I won't be able to do 10 pull ups when I'm 70. Okay. So He's, he's out of his fucking mind cause I will do fucking, I'll do that stem cell shit into my shoulders just to fuck win that bet. And stem cells is basically, it's a hair transplant for your fucking shoulders. Right? Isn't that how it works? It's so funny. All these fucking people doing all this shit to try it live longer. You know what I mean? It's like I was trying to tell me, he asked me the other day like, when do you think the perfect time to be born was? And um, I would say somewhere in the 1940s. So you miss out on World War II, you miss out on the Korean conflict and he got Vietnam. Right. But if he can somehow get out of that, as far as, you know, you got to live in some great decades.

Speaker 2:          00:18:42       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:18:43       You still got to enjoy the four seasons, you know, things get, didn't get too fucked up until like the late sixties. Then I gotta I gotta be honest with you though, being born in the 60s and being a kid in the 70s, a teenager in the 80s and in my twenties and my nineties, that's a pretty good ride.

Speaker 1:          00:19:04       Maybe everybody thinks that because they young, I dunno. I'm just sick of these fucking people coming up to me who aren't scientists telling me when the world is going end. Um, it's like I get it. I get it. I got it. Shit is fucked up please. For the love of God. Um, I have a kid. All right. I'm trying to block that out because that's all my God, this podcast just took a dark fucking turn. Oh, maybe I could sing your song. The Sun will come out tomorrow and it will be a little hotter than fuck and yesterday and then you're done. Gr Liverpool keeps winning and sodas, Man City. This has been one of the most boring things I've ever watched in sports because knowing that these are the two best teams and they're never going to fucking play each other in some sort of series.

Speaker 2:          00:19:56       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:19:56       To figure it out. This is like, Hey, you know, I'm going to shadow box over here. Well I'm shadow boxing over here and somehow we're fighting each other.

Speaker 2:          00:20:07       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:20:07       I Dunno, I just don't fucking understand that game. Now I get the game. Now I understand it more. I just don't understand. Like that's how you decide who's the fucking champion.

Speaker 2:          00:20:20       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:20:20       Everything else. Just the top two fucking people at least go out and kick the shit out of each other and the web is left standing. Wins. Not In soccer.

Speaker 2:          00:20:29       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:20:29       Not In soccer when fucking trip and somebody makes them roll around that you think you literally think they're on fire. Um, but anyways, I'm still rooting for Liverpool. I'm basically rooting from man, not for Liverpool, the beat Man City. Cause they're not going to play each other now anymore. I'm just rooting for Man City. Not Win against an opponent that isn't Liverpool. While Liverpool wins an opponent that isn't man city. Oh, that's exciting. I can see why the world is into this game. Then I get me some hate mail. All right. Oh look who's here. I'll,

Speaker 3:          00:21:01       oh,

Just like that, the fucking advertising is over a, I bought those Bruins. You liked that play in Tampa. Again, we're playing Tampa Bay so smart. This is what we do in the first, the beginning of the game would come out. We show them what we can do and then once they start thinking of, fuck, I don't want to meet these guys in playoffs. We just fucking chill. We just chill and let them score like four or five, six fucking goals. And now we got Tampa right where we want them. Okay?

Fred from my peck in the West having watched no hockey this year, I'm going to pick the Nashville predators. They got kind of close to the last few years. Everyone's writing them off this year. Hey, why not them about the San Jose sharks. How about for once? How about for once they fucking pushed through the San Jose Sharks? Don't win the fucking Stanley Cup this fucking year. I know Carlos has got to get healthy. Why don't they just fucking turn the names to the fucking dolphins? You know the poor purposes be timely. Score a goal. You make that little fucking noise. You know they should change the logo to a dolphin and then they and the dolphin with its little flippers retape that stick back together that the fucking,

Speaker 1:          00:29:06       the shark bit naff. I think that that's half the problem. It's their fucking logo is the referee see it and then they just start calling slashing cause they see a stick been broken. And obviously that's must have been what happened, right? Brooklyn Nets made the playoffs in the Houston Rockets scored a 27 hit 27 three pointers tonight. Um, none of these teams could fucking beat the fucking 83 Milwaukee Bucks. But you know, but it's a different game. Dodgers, a score and a bunch of runs. There's a lot of stuff happening. I missed all of it. I had family town family down for bad Logan.

Speaker 2:          00:29:45       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:29:47       All right. Where do we go from here? No booze in 19 weeks. You know what a fucking break up that was. Thank God I'm not a fucking week alcoholic.

Speaker 2:          00:29:56       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:29:57       They're fucking fine. 40 people listen to my stupid fucking stories. Like those people that have been sober for like 30 fucking 40 years.

Speaker 2:          00:30:06       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:30:07       Oh, boring. And their stories at that point is sitting there till in drunk stories from fucking back in the day.

Speaker 2:          00:30:15       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:30:15       Oh, I remember there was origin Howard here, judge or lectured. I don't know where it's coming back from a sock hop. I'm buying gold and I went to the whites only found and I took out a flash. All right. Buying gold? A dear Billy throwback.

Speaker 2:          00:30:36       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:30:36       Was listening to an old podcast where you said you were going to buy gold because the economy was unstable. Oh yeah. It was a little unstable. Yes. 10 years ago. Yeah. I would say it was a little unstable. I'd say I had my finger on the pulse a year after the big fucking crash, uh, two years at that point. Um, did you ever buy gold to stash away in case our currency crashed? Why would I say that on the podcast? Uh, I think some people are treating bitcoin in the same way. Thanks. And Go fuck yourself. Ah, yeah. I thought about doing that and then until I found out how fucking difficult it is to buy gold coins.

Speaker 2:          00:31:13       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:31:14       It's very hard to get your hands on some gold. And then what? And then I just realized, you know, if I have a fucking gold coin, what am I going to do with it?

Speaker 1:          00:31:24       So say the dollar crashes and nobody has any money, then I'm walking down the street with a bag of gold coins. Nobody has any money, they can't pay anybody. And that is a guy from the sandwich store going to fucking show up, also known as a deli. Is he gonna show up at the Deli and I'm going to come walking in as he's not getting paid and then I have a gold coin and going to get me fucking changed for that. Does that, he told me we'll get some silver coins and are worth as much. Yeah. I don't, I, you know something, I don't need that fucking headache.

Speaker 2:          00:31:55       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:31:57       You got gold coins, which you want to do is trade that in for some fucking cyanide pills. Okay. And then when everything goes to shit and people are coming up your driveway that, you know, like your written that fucking movie us, Eh, you just fucking, you take your, uh, you kill me pills. I think that's the way they do it. You know, get a flat screen TV and on all four walls of every fucking room you have, just blow out the fucking ozone layer as much as you can. And when the shit goes to hell, you know, just watch it on all your TVs and you know, when you recognize the helicopters surveillance footage and you're like, oh fuck, that's my house. So they right outside, then you take your pills or you get a panic from,

Speaker 2:          00:32:42       okay,

Speaker 1:          00:32:43       you build a panic room. Yeah. But they could still smoky out. I would think. There's always a way in.

Speaker 1:          00:32:57       I think what you do, I liked the underground shit. I think that's the way to go when people take, you know, basically in all his shit things that they, um, unload from those fucking ships down at the wharf and then they stick them on the back of a truck, 18 wheeler chassis, you know, those things up from the second season of the wire and they find all those fucking poor people in there. Right. Spoiler alert, the second season of the wire from fucking 15 years ago. Um, I liked the people, they, they get those things Barry.

Speaker 2:          00:33:29       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:33:29       But the problem is,

Speaker 2:          00:33:32       okay,

Speaker 1:          00:33:32       the problem is, is you got to dig the hole yourself because if you hire a contractor with a backhoe, yeah. Sorry, just yawn there. He's going to be asking all kinds of questions. Well, are you really doing here man? You fucking, you make in a lap pool or Sheldon? No, I just need get rid of the ex wife.

Speaker 2:          00:34:10       Hm.

Or they just dump it in the woods just shoddy of all the fucking times to not dot all your i's and cross all your t's when you're dumping a fucking body. You know, if he just didn't kill somebody in, in a crime of passion, if you actually premeditating the fuck the dig the hole first and get go lower than fucking, you know,

Speaker 2:          00:34:54       yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:34:54       go lower than six feet. You got all fucking dead person's alive that we live for a long fucking time. He got all fucking day. Go down 10 feet. 10 fucking feet. Right? That's what you do. You go cool hand Luke times like fucking three.

Speaker 2:          00:35:19       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:35:20       Can you fucking, I'm going to fucking alluded ticks around. Can you imagine digging a fucking hole for somebody that you know you're going to kill you? Not In the middle of digging that all gone. Fuck am I doing? Why don't I find it another fucking so why don't I just, you know, fight the guy. Well I just let it go, you know, go have a couple of fucking beers or something like that.

Speaker 1:          00:35:48       I'm going to kill this person and then risk going to jail for life and then having to join. Then at that point, you know, then what do you do? You're a white dude. You just killed somebody. Now you gotta go through the pain in the ass, a fucking go into the prison library and Cram it on Adolf Hitler. So you can come off as a legit Nazi and join the fucking Arie and brotherhood. And then you've got to listen to the head dumb shit every fucking day for the rest of your life.

And do you want me to stand as a person living in a first world country that that's the most difficult thing I have to deal with. I can't imagine the sad person that makes us fucking plug.

Speaker 2:          00:39:10       MMM.

That's all fine. Well, if we made the computer year, they'd caught $90 million. No they wouldn't. They wouldn't. If you actually paid people and you paid and gave them benefits and you took it out of your end, you don't anybody to say that? Well, we could make shirts here, but they cost $700 each. It's like, how little are you paying people to sell these things together? Cause they're not going to take a pay cut because they going to stay on their yacht with their mountain of cocaine and they're fucking horse.

Speaker 2:          00:39:55       Okay.

Can you imagine that you're sleeping in the bowels of that thing, like the things you had to do to get that fucking yard and all of a sudden you start taking on water and the radio isn't working and for the first time in years you're thinking about a higher power. And all the sins you have to fucking confess to how fast are you fucking yammering is you start to feel the water coming up around you fucking

Probably some endangered species of baby seal. Fucking slippers would've been a better reference. Whatever next podcast, I'll get it. Next podcast. Um, yeah, so I got into conspiracy theory and all of that type of shit, but I got into the, I got into the scary part of a conspiracy theory. I was reading about shit that was actually happening and then people's theories about it. I wasn't reading about, you know, shape shifters and, and fucking the government actually has a flying saucer in, in the area of 51 or whatever the fuck it, all. That shit was just like, Oh really? Okay, whatever. I got more into the economies and banking and Nah, uh, you know, corporate greed and uh,

Speaker 2:          00:41:54       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:41:54       Politicians and our, the whole fucking thing works and offshore accounts and just all of this crap. I get into that stuff. I didn't get into late, you know, who were actually aliens, uh, that were dropped by a fucking flying saucer and they're watching us. It's a big experiment. I didn't get into that. The government has time machines and uh, the former youth going to come with it. I never got to like fucking crazy shit, build a burg and stuff like that. That did fascinate me. I did get into that shit and then after a while I just became this fucking person who wouldn't stop talking about it and I had no the fuck out of everybody and I had enough of a need to be like that. I said, all right. All right, I'm with you guys. Back to the ignorant masses. I went back, not that I was informed, but it was part of the other thing.

Speaker 1:          00:42:40       I just got back to the ignorant masses and supposedly ignorant conspiracy theorist, ignorant meeting. Just uninformed. Not Stupid. All right. I went back to the ignorant masses. Hey ladies, laser John. By the way, out. Sabato was attacked by a pit bull and survivor of Rah Rah, Rah and blossom. Uh, he's wearing a pink dog collar for Teddy Cancer. Um, all right. The goal, the age of TV sucks. All right, deal. Dear Billy Tube. I know they've dubbed this the golden age of television. Well, they would have to accurately call it the second golden age of television because the first golden age, I believe was back in the 1950s and the people who called it the golden age where the white people making the television for other white people. Right. Uh, but I eat, an person says, I really hate it. Of course I enjoy some of the shows that are coming up or overall, I don't enjoy the experience.

Speaker 1:          00:43:42       I hate having to select a show on a menu. It makes it that much easier for me to change it. 15 minutes. And if I'm not impressed, dude, I'm with you. I'm going back to reading. I like it better. I pick up a book, I read a little bit, I get sleepy, I go to sleep done over, over the, these fucking streaming services, you know, God bless him. I know the kids love him and I'm old enough for me. I find it overwhelming and I keep saying, oh buddy, am I going, you know, some of these streaming things, it reminds me of a, Robin Williams made this movie called Moscow on the Hudson, which I'm sure is on Netflix, Amazon, fucking apple, all these Disney, all these fucking places that stream HBO and there's a scene he from Russia.

Speaker 2:          00:44:33       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:44:33       You know where the stereotype was? Everybody had to stand in line and the black market sergeants at the lamp here. Um,

Speaker 2:          00:44:39       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:44:41       And there weren't a lot of choices. So many defects. The first time he goes to a supermarket and he sees all the choices he has, he gets so overwhelmed that he faints. Well, that's basically, I mean, I don't faint, but when I go on like a streaming service thing, I get overwhelmed by the sheer amount of choices that, uh, most of my time on the streaming service I spend scrolling through shit. And in the end I just go, you know what? Fuck this. It's literally like, do you know, like when you got to do your taxes in for an entire year, you just through every your seat into this box and there's no organization to it whatsoever. And then one day you got to open it up and you just, you don't even know where the fuck to begin. Uh, that's how I feel. So, um, I am a big believer now and getting back, I'm just going to try to get back into reading and I walk away from my phone now. I tried for a couple of hours each day. I just, I just haven't, you know, shut off or somewhere else and I gotta be honest. I'm not missing anything. I've never

Speaker 2:          00:45:57       okay

Speaker 1:          00:45:57       had any sort of urgent call or anything or any opportunity that I missed. And it's Kinda nice to just sort of fucking walk away from it. And then when he come up to your phone after a couple hours is kind of exciting because you have all these fucking text messages so he can get right back and get a nice hit of the crack. It's kind of Nice. It's kind of a nice thing. Um, so if you've noticed a change in me, um, as I explore being sober, I want you guys to know that I promise you I will continue to get more and more preachy I'm going to be doing, I just feel like for me, reading and being conscious of a higher power, how many people have said that while we're in like fucking red bottom shoes? Um, that's one of my favorite characters out here in Hollywood. The caring whore used to be the horror with a heart of gold. Now it's the caring whore.

Speaker 2:          00:47:05       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:47:05       You ever heard of the giving tree? The sequel is the caring whore. All right. Uh, slavery in Libya. I'm gonna alone by Botox faced celebrity influencer.

Speaker 2:          00:47:19       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:47:20       Instagram page to this cause cause I just feel that guy just so totally just like, hey, I gotta tell you something. I was listening to Howard stern

Speaker 2:          00:47:29       the other day and he was doing this fucking thing about one of these bachelor's shows. And this guy had, I had never heard anybody say this because I learned this back when I was at Emerson College. Vocal fry vocal fry. Basically. It basically occurs when you're not pushing enough air through your voice box and it causes you to talk like this. And it's really weird because when people, when they start to get more intense, they're still not pushing enough air and it just gets louder and it's really fucking annoying. He's want to take a firehose and jam it down their fucking throat. Um, so anyways, um, okay.

Speaker 1:          00:48:04       He was talking about this person on the show, this guy who add vocal fry and they were some, I don't know how the fuck they did this, but they started playing

Speaker 1:          00:48:14       lamb of God and I love that band, but they were just playing the singer singing without any of the instruments and just, just his vocal track. I was fucking dying laughing because it fits perfectly with the band and the band is fucking awesome and I love it. But when you just take that guy out by himself, like I was fucking punching the steering wheel. I was laughing so hard. So if you guys can somehow find that I haven't, I'll do a little search. You'll see if it's available to save you some fucking time. If you drive any new car here. Let's see here. Um, how were stern lamb of God vocal track? Let me see if this comes up.

Speaker 2:          00:49:03       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:49:03       MMM.

Speaker 2:          00:49:06       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:49:07       Ban. It doesn't, Oh fuck you. It was, it was the one of the great, I dunno, I'm sure somebody who knows how to search better than me. Um, I'm going to start sharing my seeker, um, slavery in Libya.

Speaker 2:          00:49:23       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:49:23       Uh, dear Billy elect. Um, have you heard about how much of a fuck show Libya is ever since the Hillary Clinton brought down Kadafi how did she do it? I didn't know she did that they had, that's the latest thing to blame her for a, they had a complete breakdown in, they're already suffering society.

Speaker 2:          00:49:47       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:49:47       Um, all right. They have open air slavery. Oh, you got to hate when it, when it goes outside, you know, as long as it's inside, I think, you know, open air slavery, Jesus, I could get contagious and it's got so bad that the u s troops had the pull out because it wasn't safe for them. Now, the person gave me a link, but it was to, uh, the Washington Post and then I got to read like half an article and they got me interested in. Then they're like, hey man, if you want to read the rest of us, why don't you subscribe? Oh my gosh, your dollar big boy. Um, so I had to go to some other site and try to figure out what the fuck's going on there. He said, it makes no sense that we do this shit other than

Speaker 2:          00:50:28       someone powerful controls our armies to help their business interests. Uh, you know, you had such a great point to make and you left out some word. It makes words. It makes no sense that we do this shit

Speaker 1:          00:50:42       other than someone powerful controls our armies to help their business interests. Yeah. Well Libby is saying that is bullshit. They're saying this is just a smear campaign, which the world is so fucked up right now. I would actually listen to that. Like, okay, well now are we using this as an excuse to invade them? But it seems like we're leaving. I Dunno. Are these people that are being enslaved, are they lucky enough to be being enslaved on land that has a lot of oil underneath it? Because if it does, the calvary is common, which is regular earth with dirt underneath it. Uh, yeah, they're in trouble, man. It's fucked up. I, it's, well this is one of the stories. I read a little bit about it. That's why I try not to, uh, look at this shit, which I know, isn't that what he's supposed to do? He's supposed to stay informed and try to help fellow human beings. Um, I dunno. I gotta be honest with you. It was super depressing. The pictures and everything that I saw it and it just makes no sense to me that I get lucky enough to be born where I am and how I look. Not Saying I'm good looking and saying I got lucky enough to be born a white dude and

Speaker 1:          00:52:08       what the fuck wrong thing that they do. They're born in different parts of the world. Look different. Nobody fucking wants him in the air. The refugees, I dunno. It's a fucking shame. I have no idea how to stop it. Um, if anybody has any suggestions. Um, by the way, I'm still trying to set up a charity for a fucking local high school. I can't believe how fucking difficult it is. Trying to find a fucking place to do it where I can also dictate where I want the money to go. Finding an ice school to do a charity, it is not that difficult, but finding one that's that, that you can actually say, okay, now this is just going to go to this, right? This isn't going to go to the teacher's lounge. Fucking we bank for spring break. All right. Wife won't let me drive.

Speaker 2:          00:53:08       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:53:09       A buddy. I got to tell you something right now. MMM. The uphill battle you're going to have with me to this next paragraph is shit that I'm going to read is trying to somehow win back my respect. All right. Why won't let you drive? The only way I respect in this situation is if you're a fucking raging alcoholic missing at least two, if not three limbs. Other than that I, I dunno. Did you lose your balls in a farming accident that John Cougar Mellencamp right, right. A fucking song about your testes. All right, Bill. I'm in a very strange situation. My wife and I have seven years have not been getting along very well. Um, then the last year or so it's gotten worse. Well, you need to work on it, dude. You got to work on it. It's hard, man. Marriage is work. Uh, we argue all the time mainly because she starts fighting fights over everything. She doesn't respect me at all and she's always comparing me to other guys she works with. Ooh. Yeah. I was already a red flag when she fights over everything. This sounds like miss directed.

Speaker 2:          00:54:19       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:54:19       I would say topic anger. She is mad at you or maybe she's mad at herself from Mary when she does, I dunno. Anyways, last month someone backed into me in a parking lot and dented my car a bit. She told me it was my fault for not being a responsible enough driver, even though it happened while I was 10 feet away.

Speaker 2:          00:54:41       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:54:42       In the already parked car.

Speaker 2:          00:54:46       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:54:46       What? So now when we go places, she demands to drive because I'm not a strong enough driver. This clearly, this is to clearly emasculate me. I'm planning on filing for divorce, but I have to get my affairs in order to first, do you have any advice on how to deal with this in the meantime? Thanks. All right. This is a hail Mary.

Speaker 2:          00:55:12       Yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:55:13       they hail Mary is, you got to, this is possibly, might have to do with the way you conduct yourself and your business. And that's why she lost respect for you. And she wants you to fucking man up. So she's pushing your buttons to see if he got any man in. Yeah, I might be wrong. She might just say in order to be banging somebody work. All right, but the Hail Mary here, you know, I don't know. I think you got to fuck the shit out of. You got to put one on her. You got to dicker down, dude. That's what you gotta do. Okay, you got it. You got to bring that fucking, uh, you know, back from overseas. Dick. That's what you got it. You got to come at her with that. If that doesn't get her fucking motor running again, then I think this is a wrap. But um, yeah, it's some point a long time ago you should have put your foot down and Ben like, shut the fuck up. I'm driving my own car. If you don't want know, sit in the fucking back seat.

Speaker 2:          00:56:26       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:56:27       Deploy the airbag before we even go if you want. I don't give a fuck. I'm drive and go fuck yourself. Um,

Speaker 2:          00:56:34       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:56:34       All right. Well you filed for divorce. It doesn't seem like there's any kids or whatever, but it's just like, I would just, I'd sit down and I'd ask her and be like, can I ask you a question? Like, why? Why are you fucking mad at me all the time? And I gotta be honest with you. Start, stop being, stop being such a bitch. Jesus Christ your fucking car. What do you like an accountant and she's like a up and coming MMA and you're worried she's gonna kick the shit out of you. Then I understand that

Speaker 1:          00:57:05       bad enough. She's driving your car, you don't have to put you in a fucking triangle, right. Or worst spinning back fist. Oh, that'd be the fucking worst, right. By the kitchen island. You know, whack your head on the corner of it. Wake up covered in fruit loops in a broken cereal bowl. You can't have that. Can't have that. Um, yeah, that would be my instinct. I would stand up for myself and I would, uh, you know, do you remember when that dude in that movie? Fuck that chick on the stairs. You remember the one I'm talking about, right? That history of violence. Yeah. You got to come with the hitman. He was, uh, he was coming. He was given to the family man. Dick. Up until then, I'm all overrated. Uh, responsibilities. All right. Overrated. Underrated for the week. Uh, overrated responsibilities. Uh, Bill, I've started streamlining my life and I don't do and deal with shit. I don't, uh, I don't deal with shit. I want to what you guys do. Voice Tech sees things. I've started streaming my life and I don't do and deal with shit. I want to, I don't even know where to go with that. Do I have to fix this? I started streaming living my life. I don't do shit. I don't want to.

Speaker 2:          00:58:35       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:58:36       I don't do or deal with shit. I don't want to, I think is what he's trying to say. I recently changed companies and have a job that is lower on the totem pole but pays more on the fuck. Did you do that? I used to think I wanted to be a boss. I don't. Good man. Smart man. I want to make money and have flexible hours. Have have flexible hours. He wrote it twice. He's so committed to this. Fuck your big goals. Bill, burr key podcasting and find yourself a nice rocking chair.

Speaker 2:          00:59:08       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:59:10       Well I dunno why my goals should fucking affect you. I like how the fact that I have big goals. I don't have big goals. I got a little freckled red goals. When they're my goals, they're mine. How dare you, how I'm living my truth. Um, keep podcasting and find yourself a nice rocket chair. Dude. If you don't fucking think that I'm not trying to work towards that. I've gotten way, way, way more fucking busier than I ever wanted to be. Everyone had to be. I wanted to do all this shit that I'm doing, but I had no fucking idea how much time it took. And now that I know that I am stepping back, I am assessing the situation.

Speaker 2:          00:59:53       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:59:54       As Fun as my life is this, there's nothing better than being at home with my wife and my kid. My funniest thing my kids doing now, right there is a

Speaker 2:          01:00:02       yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:00:03       Is when she knows she's going to bed and all the things she tries to do to extend her time up. Like, I'll, I'll, I'll, I'll, I'll brush teeth, brush teeth, you know, uh, close your doors, close your doors. [inaudible] we read a book, we book. Oh, we book. She goes, oh. And then he just sit there, go, no, honey, it's time to go to bed. Tired, go to bed. And then she tries to cry, but she's not crying. She just goes, ah, like fucking Lucille Ball. It's hilarious. Um, but we still give it a little bubba with the in and when she sees that, that's her scotch for the night, you know? Um, anyways,

Speaker 2:          01:00:46       uh,

Speaker 1:          01:00:48       yeah. Believe me, dude, believe me, if I, if I could figure out a way to get off the fucking wheel, it's not how it works. So it's not how it works, then I can have a bunch of fucking people retiring at 50. They keep, well, they want to keep making money. What they do is like, all right, we're going to keep, they keep taking a bite out of your ass.

Speaker 1:          01:01:09       You know, the only way you weren't tired. Fifties. If you have some disease and you know, you're gonna be dead at 54, that's the only way I see how to do it. You know, and there's all downsides. You laugh, go live in a fucking trailer and, and, and then what? As they constantly come up with new ways to fucking tax people, my nest egg, they'll, they'll go after it. It's fucking Lee. They little this literally Americans right now, co-signing signing on taxing fellow Americans, 70% on fucking earned income. Honest fucking Americans as they look the other way on $20 trillion in untaxed evil fucking non tax paying American cons money sitting in the fucking Cayman Islands, that's too much of a hassle. They don't want to take the fucking bag all the way to the curb. They're going to sit on the couch and fucking picker some regular dude off.

Speaker 1:          01:01:59       Go Fuck Yourself. Um, anyways, I don't. Good, good for you buddy. If you can figure out how to do it, if you can figure out how to do it. And I would say one of the biggest things you want to streamline your life is do not have a woman in your fucking life because they cannot stop buying shit. It's, it's insane. It is fucking insane. And whoever came up with the mall is a fucking genius because that shit is just visual fucking crack to most women just walk and meandering around those things. What do they about this? Does this look cute? They encourage you thought you should get it. You are so, oh my God, you should totally get that. I guide tie dye.

Speaker 2:          01:02:45       Okay,

Speaker 1:          01:02:46       fucking dopes. And all they do is sit there saying that they should, you know, hey ladies, maybe you should earn the same amount as a man to see what the same job. When you can show yourself to be a little more fiscally responsible, what do you want to make? Can you imagine if I said this at a woman's college? God, I Miss Doing College gigs. Um,

Speaker 2:          01:03:09       yeah,

Speaker 2:          01:03:19       okay,

Speaker 1:          01:03:20       maybe then maybe then Uncle Sam will give you more money. I don't even know if that's even fucking true that they make less money. I Dunno. I could tell you right now, if they got paid by the world word, they fucking run the world. Ah, Jesus Bell. Come on. Let's not start to, let's not do this. Let's keep it happy. Okay?
