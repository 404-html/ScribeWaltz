Speaker 1:          00:00:01       Hey, what's going on? Is Bill burn his time for the Thursday afternoon, just before Friday fucking Monday morning podcast that I've just checking in on you. How's that? Is that the worst? Is that the worst you've ever heard? Um, Dave kept no reference. Uh, sorry. My voice is a little fucking blown out. Uh, it did a record for episode six of the 10 that we're doing for a season two and I don't know what the fuck I did to it. Um, who's getting know when you know, when you lack talent, what should try to do is you're trying to be loud so you can shout down all the silence. That's what you do. You throw in a couple of f words, a couple of fucking shit jokes. And next thing you know, you kind of have an act, you know, and you scrape the bottom of the fucking barrel. That's what you do. And when you scrape the bottom of the barrel, next thing you know, you have your party's nomination for presidency of the United States.

Speaker 1:          00:01:03       You know what's great about this job is I get to meet a bunch of different people and overwhelmingly people on both sides or just going, I don't know who the fuck I'm going to vote for. These are my, these are the, these are the two which is supposed to decide, added a fucking blue between these two fucking lunatics. I don't get it. Well, I get it. What are you going to do? See the vote more, the same or you step off into the abyss? A, I swear to God, if Trump didn't hate non whites as much as he seems to, uh, or at least was wasn't so fucking out of touch, I'd almost be excited just to see what the, what, just just being a lazy comedian. Just how this guy would just be fucking feeding it to you. You know what I mean? I found Obama was kind of boring.

Speaker 1:          00:01:58       You know, Bush was fun. Clinton was Jesus Christ. Clinton was fucking great, you know, watch, come over here and suck my Dick. I mean it was so easy to get laughs on that guy. And then Bosch, and he's got old after a while, we get it. He's fucking stupid. But like Clinton, every fucking week he was sticking cigars and people's fucking twats, you know, he's bombing people, he's putting on weight. He goes to Mcdonald's and he's got his fucking thighs out. I mean, that guy, how he was, he was, uh, he was a comedy juggernaut because he keep kept changing every time you thought, you know, all right, it's this, this, and this, and you've got this guy down. He would add another layer, Bush, which just Kinda hinky and then another fucking seven years. It's like, we get it, we get it. He's fucking stupid. And he's not stupid, but he's a, I don't know. I'll quote one of my relatives. He's not the best speaker. Um, I don't even, I barely even watched a bomb borrowers or there. Oh ha ha ha. I was just felt like he was giving me a fucking lecture. It's like, all right.

Speaker 1:          00:03:06       I never really found any whom I found his wife Hilarious fucking going on Ellen and shit and tweeting. You know what I mean? I can like some seventh grade on Instagram. She was funny, but uh, I don't know about him. Um, anyway, so hopefully whatever one of the other you're going to tell you right now, the both of them, either one of them, Hillary or Trump is going to be plenty of fucking material but then instantly be hacky. So maybe that's what it is. I don't know. All I know is I got 'em I got 'em doing this Wednesday night. The hockey is over. You get so excited to see somebody when the fucking cup and then, then there's like the next day like, oh fuck itself. Now what do I do? Um, I'll tell you what you do. You get into Formula One. There's another racist Sunday. The fucking, I don't know where the hell it it's going to be. Is this the European one? I don't. I got them all on my phone. There's a couple in July,

Speaker 1:          00:04:06       Dennis as like one in August, two in September. Then like fucking every Sunday in October there's one, then there's two more in November and then that's it. It's pretty fucking easy. They're only a couple hours. You get to watch somebody go like 200 miles an hour. You get through to look in the crowd, see all the people that go to the Bilderberg meetings, right? And sacrifice people. And then you see a couple of baskets. This is how much money's in, in, in fucking Formula One is when you look at like the a list movie stars and like fucking Zillionaire, you know, athletes, they have a look on their face. Like they can't even believe that they're there. They're like, wow, these, these people have money. We thought we had money. And then, then we came here and then we realized that we did, we, we, we, we have money, but we don't have that kind of money. You know, you know, back a fucking yacht into France. He's fucking people back a yard into France and fucking watch a race and then continue on. Where do they go? You know, you ever seen those people on yachts? Every once in a while you're like, where the fuck where they go? And do you say like, you, you cruise underneath of fucking, you got your own mountain.

Speaker 1:          00:05:19       It's incredible. Um, you ever been on a boat just by yourself? Whenever I'm on a boat by myself, I always had the same thought. There's no fucking way I wouldn't do something illegal if I owned a boat. There's no fucking way, the level of freedom that you fucking have this shit. You can, you're on a boat going out of the fucking ocean.

Speaker 2:          00:05:41       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:05:42       All bets are off. You get out into international waters. I mean it's fucking, whatever you say becomes your law. Literally do whatever the fuck you want to do. You're telling me right now if you had a fucking bolt, right? You know boss was at Dec, right? Fuck. Ah, you know, just so, uh, whenever they promoted a woman, right? Cause they had a fucking check off a box. They got you a more qualified, you came in every day with your qualified swinging Dick and junk and they had enough of it and they told you to stand down and then they promoted this lady, right? You're telling me if you got a boat, right? I don't know how he got the boat. You didn't get promoted, but whatever. This is my fucking fantasy. Trash, trash and fucking, it's hypothetical lady, right? I know. This is be considered misogynistic.

Speaker 1:          00:06:32       This is the woman I ran into the first 90 times. I tried to get something on the air. I just feel it's like this. That would be the end of my dream, but they don't have any power. Uh, it's a glass ceiling. Well, I'm running into their shoes over here is they're banging their head on the ceiling. That was been my experience. Anyway. Let's get back to the fantasy. You're telling me if you got a fucking boat, you know you're not going to just, I dunno, just a kilo of cocaine just for the fuck of it. Just to have that cash laying around your house, you know what I mean? Get a keg or have some people over, cook up some steaks. That's the way you do it. When you, when you, if you're fucking drug, it's just every once in a while. Is there a way to do that?

Speaker 1:          00:07:20       And the in the drug game was the kids say, can you just every once in a while deliver a Kalo said no one picks up on it. Right. You still drive your dented Prius, like make Jesus my car needs to fucking bath. Like you read about, I literally walked out of a fucking liquor store today. It wasn't for me cause I'm on the wagon. Buddy of mine got fucking married. Um, I couldn't make it cause I was on the road, so I just got them some fucking champaign, shit, whatever. And I forgot to get a card before on stand. I'm giving it to him. I'll just say, hey, and I've got a card. He goes, I don't worry. You've got the booze. That's what counts. Sorry, what? He'd drink up. Ay, Yay. Yay me. Look at my eyes. Right. And when the same boat. Oh yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:08:01       So anyways, um, I came walking out of the liquor store and a, I looked at my car and I got, this thing's a fucking piece of shit, but it isn't just on the outside, you know, on the inside, everything's been taken care of. Right. I've, I've maintained that thing meticulously on the outside. It's a mess on the inside. It's beautiful, you know, it's like an ugly person just waiting for somebody good looking to come along and discovered that, you know, maybe they have something to add to the conversation, you know? Um, I don't know what the fuck I'm talking about, so I'm just saying this is the way this is. If you're in, if you're selling drugs, this is what you do it. If he can just do it like the way Bush went to the fucking Army National Guard, whatever the fuck he did, we just showed up every once in a while. You know what I mean? Played Ping Pong, dress like a sergeant and then you went home for like fucking six months. That's the way you deal drugs.

Speaker 2:          00:08:59       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:08:59       Alright. Yeah. Befriended drug deal and you go, listen, this is all I want to do. I got a boat. Okay. Every fucking once in a while, you know, every whatever be fucking 18 months you call me up. Right. You got to key is something why you taught on the fucking boat? I'll have it on ice. You're the coldest fucking cocaine in the universe and I'll fucking deliver it over here. Right. You break me off like fucking 15 grant. All right. Then you just take the cash. She just got it. You got 15 grand in cash and you don't fucking buy yourself anything, you know, go out and buy a fucking flash you fucking car or any of that shit. All you do, you just have it in a jar or some shit and every once in a while big games coming up. You know UFC event, you fucking order it.

Speaker 2:          00:09:46       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:09:46       That's what you spend it on. You fucking blow it on your friends, you know?

Speaker 2:          00:09:52       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:09:52       It's some fucking barbershop chairs in your house. Just some stupid shit, you know? Nothing that caused that. That's how you blow your fucking cash, man. You could keep shit on the inside. Right. You don't drive around some flashy car with the fucking elevator shoes whenever, whenever, whenever the kids do today I, I don't, I don't pretend to though. That's what I would do, you know?

Speaker 2:          00:10:12       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:10:12       Then every once in a while, and I don't know how to get into your bank account, why would he do then if you've got to pay for the UFC event and who gives a fuck, you pay for it out of your ready a clean money, you know, and then all the booze, money and all the other bullshit you just take out of the jar. There you go. Be hilarious when you finally get caught. You know, he'd just go to trial and just like, look, I just, every once in a while I, it was like every 18 months, it's not even a felony a year, your honor. And you know, I just, I,

Speaker 1:          00:10:44       I didn't buy anything. I don't even watches the shit. I just, you know, I, I got the NFL package and I had my friends, oh everybody had their own leather chair ever. You ever watch shows the Elvis documentaries? Well, you know, everyone's going to go horseback riding and it wasn't enough. He bought everybody a horse and he got him a saddle, then a little pickup truck to put the saddle on. I did that and the judge be like, oh, is that what you did? That's great. Well maybe you uh, can take that given nature and go to jail and uh, start giving some hand jobs because a c United States of America Buddy,

Speaker 2:          00:11:14       you know,

Speaker 1:          00:11:17       do you get a kilo of cocaine? Right? And then you fucking,

Speaker 2:          00:11:23       okay,

Speaker 1:          00:11:23       take your boat all the way out into international waters, right? And then I meet you on another boat and then I hand you the key, uh, cocaine. And then you give me the money in international waters and what both captains and what we say goes and we say, uh, um, I say, this is legal, all in favor. Or we go, hi. I could they do anything. I mean, once,

Speaker 2:          00:11:48       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:11:49       It's the dude who comes back in with the fucking key low. He's in trouble. You, once you get back within the borders, you know what I mean? Can you sit there, I'm really fascinated with boats now. Can you fucking, I don't even do drugs. This is just fascinating to me. Can you sit in just just on the other side of international waters with a kilo of cocaine out in the open. Just blow and stripes is to coast guards looking at you. Just waiting for you to float another 40 feet over and just be sitting there. Gone on. Now I am the captain of the ship and international waters and I say this is legal.

Speaker 2:          00:12:27       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:12:28       Yeah, it probably can't do that. Right, because you know what they could do is they could just come over and just say that you were, you were in within the borders of the u s who's going to fucking know it's their word against yours. You brought there on the ocean. There's a lot of questions I have about the ocean. This is one of the reasons why I don't have a boat aside from the fact it's just a fucking money pit. You know what I mean? Can have a boat. You can have a friend who has a boat. That's the way to do it, right? It's, my brother always said, you don't want a boat pill. You want, you want a friend to have a boat. That's the deal. That's what it is. Then you show up, you know, bring Google, tango, rain tonic, you were fucking heroin.

Speaker 1:          00:13:05       Then you guide dogs the fucking boat and that's it. He's cleaning off the barnacles. You know what I mean? He has to explain what happened to the stewardess. She was here a minute ago. I don't know. We were drinking and she must have fallen overboard. Right then that follows you around for rest of your fucking life. Um, anyways, so what do you guys think? I guess when you listened to, since it's Thursday, so game six in Cleveland to night to night to night. Um, oh my God. Can you imagine if they force a fucking game seven that would be something else. You know what I mean? Who knows? Then you go out to fucking it lists. I'm going to give some Cleveland Cavalier fans some advice here. Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:13:54       God. Well and the force of game seven. Okay. Cause we're all trying to avoid the dog days of fucking baseball. You know what I mean? Nobody wants to watch that shit. The baseball players don't want to play the games. They don't. The only reason why they play is cause if they didn't, they wouldn't make as much money. But nobody wants to fucking play baseball from mid June to fucking like the second week of September. Any ballplayer, if they could fast forward to all of those fucking games and just get to the exciting part. You know who's gonna win the division? There's nothing better.

Speaker 1:          00:14:24       Then when it finally fucking matters after fucking 263 regular season, whatever, they play 182 games, whatever the hell it is, 180 games. Jesus fucking Christ. You know everybody in Chicago getting all excited about the cubs, you know what I mean? Already rubbing one out. They're going to bust a nut and fucking the beginning of July. You got to pace yourself. If you're not watched any pornos relax, cub, feds, put your shirts back on. All right? How many fucking times if you fell for this, not saying I'm rooting against you, but you know, slow your roll here. Cubs fans, the exp level excitement they get when you watch them every fucking year. It's literally like watching somebody's fallen in love with a stripper, you know? And you just sit in there like, what are you doing? You know, you fuck them. You don't fall in love with them right now. I'm kidding.

Speaker 1:          00:15:20       The part of being a sports fan, it's the fucking misery. And you've got to believe that's what you gotta do. Take the kick to the seeds every fucking year and then maybe one time they actually win it. Then you talk about that for the rest of your life. Oh, what a year. They still live in newspaper. A framed it. Um, and then your wife throws it out. Nah, maybe she doesn't. Maybe she's cool. Right. Maybe she wants us to sports too, but then she'd probably fat, you know, looks like you got to start putting on each other's genes in the morning and just these minor, yeah. Fuck that. They felt weird. Yeah. Don't use and then not use of the cameltoe fit here. I guess. These are yours. Um, this has gotta be the most fucking bizarre podcast I've ever done. Um, it's cause I'm fucking exhausted mentally from doing this shit.

Speaker 1:          00:16:11       Uh, I got halfway through this podcast, I'm not drinking. And I was watching the, uh, Jacopo story of Pistorious Sally says named the fucking Bass player. They're watching this documentary on him. I read the book on this guy too. And like the beginning is all great. It's just once he starts going off the rails, you know, so I kind of paused it right at the right part. If you're watching the documentary for the first hour and eight minutes, but actually probably about the hour and three minutes. And then it starts to be like, oh, and then he did this and then did that and then this fucking gap in this. Then it's a shit show. Um, so anyways, uh, to fuck are they talking about what I'm talking about boats now I was talking about the Cavaliers now is he had some advice to Cleveland Cavalier fence.

Speaker 1:          00:16:54       Okay. God willing. You guys forced the game. Six. Okay. Enough for you, not for your city after the offense for me. Okay. Cause they want another, I want to more fucking games tomorrow night and I want another one. Okay. Before I slip into, um, the sporting a bis, you know, and I don't give a fuck that you only have to wait another six weeks before, you know, preseason football starts. I don't give a fuck. I don't give a fuck about the draft. I don't give a fuck about preseason. I don't give a fuck about analysis. I don't give a shit that the projections and don't give a fuck about any of it. Just let me know when it counts.

Speaker 1:          00:17:41       I am so fucking sick of watching people standing up on a fuck in front of a God damn screen trying to explain to me what the fuck I just saw what happened and why it happened. I don't give a shit. I get it. You played the game and you understand it on a level beyond, you know, just, I dunno, just fucking show who one Taco over the highlights and end the fucking thing. You're going to sit around and have God damned debates. Yeah. What do you think was happening in the transit? Well, I think the problem with everybody knows, I don't know. I don't know shit about basketball, but I can tell you right now, if you fucking the Cavaliers as a fucking comedian, I know what they're doing wrong. At least I think I do. I would think if you up by eight points against a team that can shoot the fucking lights out and you'd want to throw the ball around a little bit when it was in your possession rather than whoever gets the ball and crosses.

Speaker 1:          00:18:40       Fucking mid court just says, I'm shooting it right. It doesn't even pass the ball and you take like two seconds off the clock. It's probably not what you want to do. Right. See that? I'm a comedian. I can figure that out. Do I need four people in fucking, well, three people in suits and he got to get a lady in there, right? She's got a fucking, she's got to run her. Yap. She's got to put her fucking 2 cents in, right? You're the, one of the worst fucking things ever is, is to be a beautiful woman, you know, and you're with a really successful guy. You know, and you just go around a parties and then you're just, you just stand next to the guy going, is he going to introduce me as you're going to introduce me? You get one tie there. Hi. Then he just stand there. The other night I did a Gig and there was this, there was a scene afterwards and there was all these fucking, you know, rich people with their beautiful wives and I just, I dunno, I just started watching the wives after awhile. I don't know. Why don't they peel off and talk to each other? It's sort of a weird thing where they just got to stand there smiling. You can see their face hurting, you know their feet hurt from the fucking pumps. It's fucking brutal.

Speaker 1:          00:19:50       If you're a beautiful woman, what you should do, you got to marry like a fucking six who just can't believe that he's with you. Cause he'll let you go out and wear some fucking flatties some moccasins. He doesn't. You don't have to jack it up in the air and stand there smiling next to him. Like one of those fucking psychos on the prices, right? Waiting to fucking act like they're amazed about a washer and a dryer. Get a stand next to your fucking guy's wearing a sport coat. Try to cover up his fucking man tits and you've got to sit there smiling like you're happy. You know, putting your fucking makeup on like some clown. That's about everybody shut out of a fucking cannon. You don't need that shit. What are you doing?

Speaker 1:          00:20:31       They got to start. Well, I'll tell you these fucking good looking women that marry these really successful guys and then just stand next to him smiling, you know, for the whole fucking evening, like a stewardess at the end of a flight except the fuck it takes four hours for the, for everybody to get off the plane because by thank you for flying high. You know who's fault that is? It's their fault. It's their God damn fault for getting yourself into their fucking position. Some point, the relationship, you got to say, listen, hey mark, sit down. We got to talk. Guess what? Fucking Susie ain't putting on the shows tonight. All right. Deal with it. Not Standing next to you. Smile. You want to go to a fucking brunch and stand next to me smiling with some aftershave on for fucking four hours. I didn't think it did. Shut up. I'm not finished. At some point you got to have that conversation. You know, I'm not trying to be mean here. This is supposed to be empowering. I'm saying you have the power and an up just fucking standing there smiling like a God damn. I don't know why. I don't know what it is.

Speaker 2:          00:21:37       You know?

Speaker 1:          00:21:39       I don't know. I'm talking about, I don't even know if I saw that. I watched an episode of House of cards, you know, house of cards. I last like three. I lasted like three episodes and I just got sick of him fucking turning me talking to me. It's like, dude, will you just live your life? Stop talking to me. They are right there as a secretary of state. He doesn't know. Then I'm fucking as well. I shut up. I get it. I get it. Just stop talking. What does this, the wonder years for adults? Um, Oh God, I'm in a grumpy fucking mood and I love Kevin Spacey. Why would I say these sinks? Why would I say these things? Because I'm mentally fucking exhausted and I got another eight minutes where I got to run my fucking Yap running my yap on the Thursday afternoon podcasts, talking about issues.

Speaker 1:          00:22:23       Um, what else? I don't know there have anything else. I still haven't watched peaky blinders because I'm trying not to drink and there's no way to to watch that show and not want to fucking start. Just pounding. Maybe I'll wait til like the 4th of July, you know, I'll just watch. That's what I'll do. That's a good way to spend the 4th of July. I'll ignore my wife and just get blind drunk watching a show that she can't understand. You know, I put on the subtitles, but she, she didn't need is just not into it. She just doesn't give a fuck. We actually had this, we had this argument the other night, right?

Speaker 1:          00:23:01       She goes to when we go to bed, right. She puts on the TV and she always has a shows on and what's fucking hilarious to me. And she's always coming at me about my temper and my yelling and flipping out, screaming Atlanta and shit, or yelling at the TV or my computer. Oh, me and my computer, if you ever heard the way I yell at my fucking computer, you don't like that couple that just needs to fucking break up. You know, we, we got it in my neighborhood, dude. I'm telling you like fucking two houses up that they've been very good lately. You know? But I'm telling you this like times, like you're literally like waiting to hear the gunshot. It's like this just fucking insane the way they scream at each other.

Speaker 2:          00:23:38       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:23:38       It's the most unhealthy fucking relationship.

Speaker 2:          00:23:42       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:23:43       I've ever heard. And I gotta be honest with man, you know, sometimes I hear it and I just, I go out on my porch and I just, I just listen. You don't light up a cigar and just enjoy it like it's a show not fuck with yet, don't. Um, but anyways, so she's always getting on me about my temper. And Shit. You know what's fucking hilarious? It was every fucking show she watches. It's just a bunch of people screaming and yelling at each other. Those reality shows that it just wall the wall clams. That's all. I mean, you would think all these feminists out there who is sitting there trash and men up and down. All the bad stuff we do to them. Admittedly. You know what I mean? We make you stand next to us and smile for an entire fucking party. You know?

Speaker 1:          00:24:28       Oh, I'm sorry. This is my wife. Oh, I'm sorry. This is the person that committed my life to, I'm sorry. Did I agnostic? Did I not even acknowledge that you will fucking here? They deal with that. I'll fucking night. Right. All that bullshit. I know we do that shit. But you would think that these fucking feminists, right? You'd think that they would, they would have issues with these fucking reality shows because the way they did depict women is, I don't give a fuck how many pairs of shoes, how big the fucking houses, how much Jules they got hanging off of them. They still going to bitch that just fucking bitch and each other out. She was watching one of these shows, right? And there was just like, I don't know, 15 it seemed like there was 15 to 20 of them. So you know, there was, it was probably just three, but that's the amount of noise of fucking woman can make.

Speaker 1:          00:25:14       Right. Three of them were sound like 15. It's like their defense mechanism because generally speaking, they can't beat the shit out of men. But if they just start complaining, it just sounds like a platoon in your back down. Right. Instead of giving all three of them, I'm one of those most slaps, you know, when all three stooges would get slapped at once. Um, anyways, one of the episodes I saw like, you know, like I said, it sounded like 15 so realistically it was probably like six of them, right? They, they went to like Rome or some shit. And I'm thinking, I finally, they got these fucking women out of this culdesac now they can, now they can be excited to be in romp. They go to fucking room. They do the same goddamn think. You know this bitch come up to me. He started talking about, it's like you're in Rome.

Speaker 4:          00:34:14       a half hour is shit for a podcast a long time ago. Maybe a little bit of time ago, but, uh, it's not gonna be this one. All right. You can't have a great weekend.

Speaker 3:          00:34:29       Faster, faster.

Speaker 1:          00:35:37       Hey, what's

Speaker 5:          00:35:38       going on? It's a bill burr. It's the Monday morning podcast. Um, what is it? One 48, one 49. There we go. Just change west coast time and, uh, I'm in a great fucking mood. I'm not in the God Damn Airport, you know? Why don't we say, you know, like you're gonna fucking talk back to me. Um, no, I haven't. Great mood. I'm actually in my apartment laying in my bed, chilling the fuck out and uh, I'm in a great mood. Even though I had a, uh, I had a fucked up week. Really? Bill, you had a fucked up week. Why is that? Well, I'm going to tell you, um, I've been making jokes over the last four months about me. I'm driving a dented hybrid and talking about how emasculating that is. You know, it's like already I'm driving a hybrid, so I had to deal with everybody going, oh, what do you effect?

Speaker 5:          00:36:41       You know what I mean? Suggesting depth because I'm making the air a little bit cleaner that for some reason that on some level that means I want to suck a dick, which is, that's very childish, yet effective yet effective. It's very hard in a group situation, one on one maybe can defend it, but in a group situation when somebody yells out, what are you affect? What ends up happening is we'll even guys who aren't in the social circle, we'll start laughing and then it's like, you know, you're fucked. His people are laughing at the question of what do you with saying like if you suck Dick or whatever, you know, if you were to start talking about, you know, how, uh, you know how you're thinking about the environment that actually digs the hole deeper, you know, and the people like, well maybe. Yeah, look at him. He's talking about the environment. Only people who are into the same sex, uh, are into the environment. They know. Funny actually about the hybrid is a, when I bought it a year ago, I got a ton of shit for it. People make fun of the little tires and everything else. You know, but as gas prices have crept up, I feel like for 60 to 40, 70 out here in the last Congolese, um, all of a sudden people are now coming up to me being like, oh, so what's, uh, what's the deal with those cars?

Speaker 5:          00:38:12       You know? And then they asked the usual dumb questions like, can they go up the hill? No, no, they can't. Fortunately everywhere I want to go involves driving on a perfectly level surface if not a little bit downhill. And then I have to say I take the long way around and somehow I get back without having to go back up the hill. I just fucking drove down. I'm like, what the it sell it God goddamn car that doesn't go up the hill, you know, asked me that question was my mother, my mom asking me that you were on a hybrid?

Speaker 5:          00:38:48       No, mom. I moved to Nebraska, moved in Nebraska. That's what I did. And it's funny, there's no hills in Nebraska, but there are tornadoes. Okay. Um, okay, so this is what happened. I've been driving around this fucking dented car. Oh. If he knew that my page, this is the Monday morning podcast and I do one of these every single week, you know, people ask me questions, people send me information and a whatever and I babble about my life while I hype upcoming gigs like the fact that I'm going to be doing stand up on the guys' choice awards this Sunday night, June 22nd on spike TV guys, choice awards. I believe that comes on somewhere between eight at night and four in the morning. No, I think it's 10 o'clock I don't know when the fuck it is. If I was organized, I know that, but I did six minutes of stand up that day.

Speaker 5:          00:39:44       I believe I'm going to whittle down to three minutes and I had a great time and there were a bunch of famous people there and I was jumping up and down like a girl scout inside, outside. I was playing it cool. Like, Hey, they're a person who I've always admired. How are you? Yes. Nice to meet you too. And inside of like God, I can't believe I just shook their head and they said, nice job. You're funny. It was a thrill. I had a great fucking time. Um, so I got that coming up. Oh. Also this week I'm going to be at the punchline in Atlanta. One of my favorite clubs. See little boy, a great mood on man. What's the last week's podcast? That was not a good mood. That was me in an airport wanting to get the fuck out of there. Oh, by the way, for those weekly listeners of my podcast, you know, I was going from Raleigh trying to get back to la because it's fucking Raleigh.

Speaker 5:          00:40:35       There's no direct flight. I had to fly from Raleigh up to Cleveland and then from Cleveland to fucking La. Well, uh, my connecting my Raleigh to Cleveland, the flight was late because wind, if you remember. And when I, by the time I got to Cleveland, my flight to La had already left. So I had to spend five fucking hours and the Goddamn Cleveland fucking airport with, with, with, with, uh, what was the big give me. They give me a $15 voucher to spend five hours in that fucking airport. And I was a, I did my usual, I flipped out a little bit. I was like 50. And The lady's like, well, you know, I actually hooked you up. They usually, uh, I gave you the dinner voucher. The lunchtime voucher is only eight. You know, that's one of those times you just want to reach them across and just grab someone by the throat even though they didn't make the rule just to make you feel better and be like, bitch, you don't give me fucking those to fitness fucking airport for eight hours.

Speaker 5:          00:41:33       All right, I want, I want one fucking 30 bucks and I want free Internet. That's what I want. Okay. I don't want some $50 voucher so I can, they'll get a chicken sandwich with mushrooms. Oh Shit. Was that good? God dammit. I had a good chicken sandwich in there. It all worked out. So anyways, this, this is, this is what happened this week. So anyways, so I've been driving around this, uh, my, uh, my hybrid, there was dented, it got dented initially cause some douchebag backed into me and I got that fixed immediately. And then the next time it got dented it was because my girlfriend, uh, I dunno, she misspoke in a parking way, put it that way and she fucking, I dunno what she did, but it came home and it looked like fucking big foot had a pair of timberlands on and stomp the Goddamn quarter panel.

Speaker 5:          00:42:26       So I've been driving around with that. Right. Was scrape marks on the side. It just, it just, you know, as a man, you don't want to have a car with a den that it just makes you feel like a fucking loser. Forget about the fact that it's a hybrid and it has those little fucking search roll up size tires. Okay. So I finally get the thing fixed after four months, you know, cause I want to make sure she learned how to parallel park, you know, full. She fucked the thing up again. So that's taken care of. So I get the Goddamn thing fixed. This is how excited I am. I have, my girl comes to pick me up at the airport as I'm hugging her, right? Like World War II ended. I'm looking over her shoulder looking to see that there's no dent in the car. And you know what I mean?

Speaker 5:          00:43:18       It's almost like I was cheating on her in like an automotive kind of wet. So I was excited. The fucking thing look great. Everything was fantastic. And I drove this car that was on Monday. Thursday I go over my management's office. I valet the fucking thing, one of those deals where, you know, I valet it but I park it cause there's a spot right there. I go to my lunch, I come back from lunch and there's a fucking dent, my car again, the exact same spot, the exact same sites and now it's the bumper. And I, I swear to God, I never understood the expression I was beside myself. I never knew what the fuck that meant. But when in that moment I get it, it's some sort of out of body experience where I was just, I had to look at my driver's license, my license plate, like seven times.

Speaker 5:          00:44:09       I was like, there's no fucking way. That's my car is his camping my car. And I just kept looking down and it was, it was my fucking pot. So then I look over at the valets, okay mind you listen to the exact same spot and they're not looking at me. This is all shit I put together afterwards. But I was so flustered. I came up there, I fucking voice went up like nine office. Oh, he's even mad. I was literally like a, I felt like it was going to fake it. Don't see those old movies when they got some broad and you know, they get their, those dresses down to the floor that has like 52 layers of underwear underneath him. That's why I should have had all my loads, a fucking hoop skirt and I should have just fainted. Would one of those little umbrellas that you spin around and it doesn't really keep the rain or the sun off yet.

Speaker 5:          00:45:02       It's just supposed to make you look more attractive. I should have been holding one of those and I, that's what I should've, that's how flustered I was. So the fucking parking attendants are like, I'm like, well, you know what happened to my car? And they were just like, uh, yeah, they, uh, somebody, uh, somebody hit hit it, somebody, he, I might, who hit it, I don't know. And a day we backed it over there and, uh, somebody here did back in the day, that day, you know, everything, the fucking word sounded like it started with a d, You know, so, um, like I can't fucking believe in and then they give me the sheet of paper to fill out, you know, they should have told me that they fucking did it because someone else hit me. First of all, you saw the fucking dentist con, there's no way these guys didn't hear it, you know, and they just automatically give me this form saying that they, I guess they're going to pay for it.

Speaker 5:          00:45:56       So I'm filling the shit out. And it wasn't until I drove away that I started thinking about it, I pulled over and I'm looking at the dent and it's the exact same shape as the polls in the garage. So obviously one of those fuckers drove it into a pole and then after they drove it into a pole, they stuck it back in the space where I, where I had left it and then tried to fucking, then they would look and down, not make an eye contact. I think they were trying to hope that I didn't see it.

Speaker 5:          00:46:31       I hope one of those fucking guys is one of my listeners every week. All right, dude, why don't you just fucking constantly and let me know you did it. Okay. I know. Like you don't want to get fired, right? Is that what it is? I just can't fucking believe it, man. I just, I it just so goddamn depressing my fucking car. It's got another God. Damn. I just got to fix four days. I drove around for four days. I don't understand it. You know what I mean? It's not like when my car didn't have a dent in it. I started driving around and making fun of people who had dents in their cars. So there was some sort of fucking calmer going on. Why didn't deserve to not have a dentist fucking car. So that's it. Now it's unreal, man. I can't have a car.

Speaker 5:          00:47:16       It doesn't have a fucking Bennett. And uh, I really wish I didn't tell this story because I started off in a great mood. And as you can tell by my tone, I'm not in such a great mood anymore. It's just really fucking freshman. I'd say what's extra frustrating? They gave me this piece of paper with some lady's name on it and they're like, yeah, she doesn't call you in the next five days. Give me a call. And like I said, I was so beside myself. I said, okay. And it wasn't until day three. I was like, wait a minute. He doesn't call me in the next five days. How about in the next five fucking minutes? Fucking idiot. You're ruined my car. Or this phantom lady ruined it. And then you got in it in it for some fucking reason to put it back in the same spot.

Speaker 5:          00:47:58       You five foot, two inch fucking jackass. I just, Oh, maybe that's why I put it. Dennis came to see over the fucking steering wheel. All right. You know what, I listened back to last week's podcast and I just really felt like I sounded like I was too God damn upset on it and it was too depressing. So I tried to start this one off and try to stay focused in a good mood and then look what happened. What am I had 13 minutes in and I'm already flipping out again. I just, you know, anybody else? Anybody else got any fucking stories out there like that, that can make me feel better? Maybe I could read to some of the listeners. I mean, I want to hear some of your, I fixed my car or I just bought a brand new car and then some fucking cunt.

Speaker 5:          00:48:43       Jesus. No, no, no. I'll drop it. The C word. All right. Let's look, let's get back to my dates here. Okay. Um, so that's the deal. I haven't ended hybrid again. You know, let's think of some positive shit. The Celtics won one game, like they had to out in la, one of the greatest comebacks ever. And, uh, they get to more in Boston. Let's hope they're going to win it. I actually went to game three, Celtics lost that one, but it was still awesome to go to the, uh, go to the finals. But I got to admit, man, they'll go, referees were, uh, they were little, they were crazy. The amount of files that was the game right after Phil Jackson was complaining. Remember that game too when they called 56 files on the liquors and like three on the Celtics. So he bitched about it and I think the referees get pissed, but kind of knew he was right.

Speaker 5:          00:49:36       So they were like calling a ton on the Celtics, but they also kind of going, fuck you Phil Jackson, we're still running shifts. So they still called a bunch on the Lakers and I don't think the ball went up and down the court three times without them blowing the whistle. Like there was never any sort of like slow to the game and it kind of sucked as a fan because they kept cock blocking the excitement. Even when the Lakers were going on a run, you know, even as a self expanse sitting there, it was pretty, you know, it was cool to see them going bananas and feeling like I was at a finals. But every time they'd start to go nuts, they pull some ticky tack file. And then the other way when they would start getting quiet and I just touched standing up talking shit, they, they, they call another bullshit once.

Speaker 5:          00:50:19       So I don't know what the fuck they're doing it. But in the last night's game, I thought the officiating was really weird. It was like the beginning the game, like, all right, they're going gonna let them play. They will lighten the Mug each other, and then all of a sudden they stayed start calling. They just ticky tack that it's not consistent. Does that mean consistent? Plus we lost, so I'm probably a little cunty too. Um, but anyways, uh, here we go. The punchline in Atlanta this week from June 19th to the 21st this is one of my favorite gigs and I absolutely loved going to that club. It's just an old school club. If you live anywhere near there, please come down. I've got a brand new hour and I also have a solution to the uh, the gas problem. I really do something that would be effective, a very effective if did I say ineffective, very effective within eat and that wasn't a aspect.

Speaker 5:          00:51:08       Did like it. Uh, you know at, that's one of those things I never know the difference, the effect or effect. It might have to look that up. Um, all right. And then, uh, July I'm going to be at the Improv and Pittsburgh from uh, July 10th through the 13th. Then, uh, the next Gig I have after that is July 31st through August. The fuck is it? Hang on, hang on the page. There's somebody at the comedy works. That's what it is. Economy works in Denver, Colorado from August, I mean July 31st or is it 30th in to turn the page the last fucking day in July through a Saturday. August 2nd. Nice. No Sunday. Got To love that. Yeah. It's 31 days in July. 31 days have November except for September and Friday. Honestly, that one go. All right. Um, do I have anything else to hype? I think that's pretty much it.

Speaker 5:          00:52:06       Uh, podcast questions. All of a sudden nobody's asked me podcast questions about what happened last two weeks. I didn't answer any questions to now you guys, you can't ask me anything. I got a question for you. Where the fuck are all the questions? How you over it? Um, I don't know why. Okay. I think it's time to wrap this fucking thing up. What the hell was I just looking up? Oh, effect an effect. I'm trying to teach you guys something effect and effect you like how I don't know the difference and I'm going to act like I'm teaching you. Which of these sentences are correct. Rising oil prices will have an effect on nearly everyone. That's correct. With an [inaudible], right? Why don't you just give me the fucking definition I hit when they do this? Her emotional outbursts first was purely for effect. You know, wait a minute.

Speaker 5:          00:53:00       All of these sentences correctly, employee effect and effect. In most situations we use effect is a noun and an effect is a verb. Well, what the fuck did they mean? How about giving me a definition first? You know what? This is like. This is like how they, I was taught Algebra, you know what I mean? Like everything would math up until eighth grade for me anyways, was numbers. If you fucking Asian, I'm sure you were doing calculus in the third grade, but let's just stick with your random fucking stupid American hair. All right? Right up to eighth grade, it was all fucking numbers. Then all of a sudden ninth grade comes around and they throw the fucking alphabet in there and there was no soda before they go in, you know, little, little speech like, Hey, this is going to be a little different. The do just started doing it.

Speaker 5:          00:53:49       He just started throwing, you know, foil first outside, inside last, uh, you know, dial it all that high school man, opposite angles are congruent and none of his shit may and you just, you just repeated it like you were in a cult. They just stand up. They opposite angles are congruent. Opposite angles are congruent. Did nobody had any idea what the fuck they went to and they just had a triangle on the board? That's what this website is like. Get it right online.com. Uh, there's no fucking definition how these fly correctly. Webster's curse this birthday. Fucking thanks. All right. Hey, is this exciting? Is this an exciting podcast as I attempt to fucking look up Goddamn word and fail miserably. Effect effect.

Speaker 5:          00:54:39       Cause you didn't do this shit at work and that's the mission, you know, and you try to look up like Robbie Knievel and try to guess what year he was born. All right, here we go. Perfect definition of effect to have an influence or effect or a change in, you know what? Fuck this word. Okay. You know what I mean? That's like the difference between a truck and a car. And in the definition of car, they describe it as a fucking truck. You know what? Sometimes you got to cut your losses and you got to realize that you're not going to know some things in life. So that's just one of them, you know? All right. What does this podcast, this has just been spam for the last three minutes. I apologize. Um, you know what? I just had to eat. You know what? I should actually turn this into a contest and say I'm going to give out, give you a free 100 DVDs. If you could guess what the fuck I just ate, cause you'll never guess what it was thicker than most. Okay? I'm going to give you hints and you can all play along at home. All right? This is something, it's a dessert. It's uh, something that they used to have creepy commercials about with a high pitched voice and you put it in the freezer.

Speaker 5:          00:56:03       Three answer into one. I actually just has slice of cookie puss. There's no way to say that without fucking laugh. And I just had a piece of cookie ice cream cake, whatever the fuck you call it, it's ice cream and cake. Just like affect an effect. Did the same thing. It's fucking incestuous. And you, I got to tell you something. If you've never had it, it's just as disgusting as it sounds. You know what I mean? Some things are just named perfectly and cookie posts. It just what it is. It's a stank ranked slutty ass fucking disgusting cake. Like if, if, uh, who's the right horde of pickup? Just going to say a Paris Hilton was a cake. She wouldn't be, she'd be like a fucking blow pop. Sorry. Uh, I don't fucking know. All right. Whatever. My sugar levels up through the fucking roof. Why do I have up God damn fucking ice cream cake?

Speaker 5:          00:57:06       Because I turned 40 last Tuesday gym on Sunday. That's the way I was dying. I rejoined, I'm like, fuck this. It turned 40 on Tuesday. Let me, let me bang out 500 sit ups. The last 500 sit ups would be in 39 years old. Um, yeah. Yeah. It's pretty fucking brutal. But I'll tell you something and somebody shows up, you know, you have a party place and somebody shows up with a cookie, puss, ice cream and you know, it's not that bad. Not because you eat it, it tastes good. You're more thinking like, well, you know, maybe I was addicted to sweets I need and his fucking horse shit every day. All right. Did we learn anything this week? Yes we did. We're going to learn that bill burr. It's going to be on the fucking the, uh, that's like guys choice awards this Sunday. And uh, somewhere between eight and 4:00 AM on Spike TV and a, I am the VP at the punch line in Atlanta and uh, I don't know the definition of effect and aspect and a cookie puss. Ice Cream tastes like it tastes like Eskimo. Uh, yeah. You went down on a fucking Eskimo cooker.

Speaker 5:          00:58:21       It's really fucking, it's, it's just, it's fucking awful. Let me see if I can just, first of all, some Carvel. It's got a big green fucking ice cream nose with a Conan. And I just can't imagine like you ever see those people? They're so fat that like fucking bedridden. This is the kind of shit that they eat because you know, everybody's out of shape. I'm fucking out of shape right now. You know what I mean? Everybody, once you get past 30, you got a fucking gun. Nobody looks good without their shirt on. It's everybody stopped winding on that fucking biggest loser. Okay? No one looks good to quit your crying. Okay. But uh, those people who gets so big that they're just fucking bed written, you really have to go out of your way. You have to go above and beyond to get that big, you know what I mean?

Speaker 5:          00:59:09       Slow metabolism. Fuck you and your fucking metabolism. No you don't. You are eating cookie puss nightly, nightly basis. I had just had a snack. What did you have? I had cookie puss. All fucking 3000 fucking calories a slice. Here we go. And that's how I like to fucking ended. I liked to, to attack the band written and that's it. That's the Monday morning podcast APP. Please, uh, re up with the questions. I swear to God, I'll read them. I will answer them next week, and somebody please give me a fucking definition, the difference between effect and effect, because, you know, I said, you know, I looked it up and they use the definition of the other word in the fucking definition, which is annoying. All right. Um, that is it. Uh, thanks to everybody came up to me to see my show in Raleigh, North Carolina. It's the most disjointed fucking podcast ever. Um, did I use that word correctly? Um, in Raleigh, north Caroline's, um, I'm adding a bunch of new dates coming up. I got a date coming up with the stress factor in New Jersey. Uh, I got to college. Umass Amhurst going to be adding that date shortly. Uh, what else? What else? I don't know. Sometime in August, beginning of September. So look for those dates and, uh, anything else, just go to billboard.com and, um, and that's it. All right. You have to weaker.
