Speaker 1:          00:00:00       Hey, what's going on is bill burn? It's time for the Monday morning podcast from um, December 17th.

Speaker 2:          00:00:08       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:00:09       2017 all my God. Only seven more days till the fucking baby. Jesus comes down the chimney there. Whatever the fucking story is, right. What was the story? All calm, all ye beard guys into this fucking barn. Look at this lid. Obey. Be she was Nana ever banged. Oh, poor Joseph. What's going on everybody? How are you? How did you enjoy your weekend? That Jab, a good one. My patriots lost again. I think they're only going to win 10 or 11 games this year. Is it time to hit the panic button? Um,

Speaker 2:          00:01:01       yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:01:02       What are you going to do? You know, we had a great run. We had a great run. This is a trend. Normally this, this type of play would not, would not worry me. I, you know, cause I remember when we lost, you know, Romeo chromal and Charlie Weiss and we lost Thai law lawyer Malloy and fucking Teddy Bruschi retire and we lost all of those guys and we built it back up again. So you know, this time, what do we lose? We lose, we who'd we lose? We lost a, you know, Matt, Patricia left to go coach the fucking lines running back to wide receivers, quarterback left tackle all of that shit and adds up one year. You know, two years. That's a lot of people to lose. But back in the day you'd be like, all right, you know, all the draft picks they got for them, they're going to build this fucking thing back up again. Right. Which they always did and they continue to win and people kept saying the Patriots had done and they kept proving them wrong. But now, I mean Tom is what, 41? Almost 42 is that what it is or is he 40, almost 41?

Speaker 1:          00:02:06       Um, yeah, it's like do they have time for one more champion chip run for ring number six on precedent. I, by the way, I'm so fucking sick of every time they show the fucking steal are still like they got six Superbowls more than anyone else and they never bring up the packers. It's, the packers have four and they have like 11 NFL titles that for whatever reason, they don't count NFL titles. I've been asking this question cause I'm, I'm big on that. All right. I'm not saying the Steelers, not one of the great franchises or the Super Bowl era. They are, but what kind of fucking league is around since the 1920s in 1930s and doesn't count championships until 1968. You know, as, as I've stayed before the Montreal Canadians, they fucking count championships, won the Stanley Cup was the size of a fucking shot glass and the, and you know, and they beat the fucking Montreal maroons playing pond hockey. The fucking Philadelphia Phillies, one of their world series titles is from the fucking 1880s. I didn't think they had baseball gloves. I don't know what they fuck they were using as a ball.

Speaker 3:          00:03:24       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:03:24       You know?

Speaker 3:          00:03:25       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:03:26       Probably like a fucking human skull. It was so god damn long ago. Um, those championships are all counted. I don't understand why, how nice are people in Wisconsin that they don't speak up and be like, hey, not for nothing. Uh, back when you could, when NFL titles, the Pittsburgh Steelers were playing. So,

Speaker 3:          00:03:47       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:03:47       We basically been playing the same amount of time and uh, as far as I could tell we're, we're almost like 10 championships ahead of him.

Speaker 3:          00:03:56       Okay.

Speaker 4:          00:03:56       Why do they always get all the glory? I have no fucking idea. I do. I just don't understand why NFL titles don't count. Why don't I Google that? Why don't I look it up? By the way, congratulations to the Steelers. Jesus Christ. That wind was a long time common. Should've want it fucking last year when that guy caught the ball and scored a touchdown and then they said he didn't.

Speaker 3:          00:04:18       Yeah.

Speaker 4:          00:04:19       After further review what she just saw didn't happen. Replay the down. Alright, there we go. Let's write this out here. Why starts with a w bill? Why doesn't the NFL count and F l champ be an ships? BOMP bomp bomp. Bomp dude, why do people ignore pre Superbowl championships?

Speaker 3:          00:04:48       Okay,

Speaker 4:          00:04:49       here we go.

Speaker 3:          00:04:53       Okay.

Speaker 4:          00:04:54       Or a team's dark ages. I don't know what dark age assessed to do with any of this stuff. Okay. So this guy goes, I rarely post on here, but this always irks me. I'm a fan of the packers, but I live in the middle of steel, his country and I get this thrown in my face all the time that the Steelers have one six Superbowls. I throw out the fact that the packers have one 13 championships.

Speaker 3:          00:05:15       Okay.

Speaker 4:          00:05:16       With four of them being super bowls. Yeah. So they have more than twice then.

Speaker 3:          00:05:21       Okay.

Speaker 4:          00:05:21       I get all the time saying no, they don't count in. This bothers the crap out of me. Yeah, it absolutely does. You basically saying that like all the champions that came before Superbowl champions, they're not champions even though they won a championship. Um, as a person who was a history major and who loves the history of the sport, especially for some Steeler fans, um, that NFL history doesn't start at 1970. It actually store the first two super bowls were called NFL title Games and AFL AFL championship games or something. And then later they were, they were renamed Superbowl champions. Um, Superbowl won a Superbowl too, I should say. But the first one that actually was called a Superbowl as it was happening was Superbowl three. Uh, anyways, they ignore or the third AFL NFL title. Jesus felt we get it. And he was, they ignore the fact that the Steelers were terrible until 1970 also known as the dark ages of the Steelers. Uh, I think they have actually terrible until about 72 or 73 till they had that incredible draft. I acknowledged most of the packers dark ages, the 50s and posts, Lombardi and home grim. Uh, I know it's not all Steeler fans, but it still bothers the crap out of me. The question I ponder is in the title. All right.

Speaker 4:          00:06:42       All right. So this guy writes, it's kind of funky since most NBA fans will count championships before the 76 and be a merger. Oh Dude, you can go big and go back further than that. With a, with the Los Angeles Lakers count like a fucking Ba championship has an NBA championship. It was the BA in the NBL and those two things merge to form the NBA and like the Minneapolis Lakers, I think one the first like four NBA titles, but the year before that they want to a Ba championship and for some reason that is counted as an NBA championship. The Lakers won an NBA title before the NBA existed. Explain how that works anyways. Um, this isn't going to be a good name. I wanted something to somebody who fucking knows something green bay as much more historical. I think if someone wants to argue that the league is totally different now than the real point of reference isn't 1970, it's 1994 in the salary cap was introduced. Yeah. Why don't you turn it into your fucking argument. MMM,

Speaker 3:          00:07:53       okay.

Speaker 4:          00:07:53       Mass swarm of lines, browns and eagles fans. But in all honestly, it's really frustrating. Flat out inaccurate when they say the eagles have never won anything. Yeah. That's bullshit. Well, this is from four years ago. You can't Cherry pick which championship titles count and which don't. The name of the trophy is arbitrary. Uh, it's not arbitrary at all. It's, it has a very specific line in the sand and it's one that the league itself drew not friends fans trying to hold down the eagles and other teams. The NFL decided nothing pre Superbowl matters. Yeah. Well that's my question. Why?

Speaker 3:          00:08:30       Okay.

Speaker 4:          00:08:32       Cherry picking would be saying the eagles are packers pre Superbowl championships camp but the browns don't. Arbitrary would be saying the package packers, NFL championships count but the eagles don't just because the NFL only counting stats and championships and super bowl one may or may not be fair, but it's definitely not arbitrary or cherry picking. All right. That's all good points but it doesn't explain why they decided not to decide it. Why people count. Why do people do, I see there's a bunch of articles on it. There's a bunch of articles. I all these are all chat rooms. I'm not going to get anywhere with this next time I do one of these fucking I, I don't know who. Who would you ask?

Speaker 3:          00:09:24       Okay.

Speaker 4:          00:09:25       Is somebody that has got to be somebody that you asked because this fucking bullshit that they act like, you know, the fucking league is like 70 goddamn years old and they're acting like the top of the heap is six measly fucking championships. It doesn't make sense at all. And then, you know something, if they actually counted NFL titles, I know the giants won a couple two and they got four super bowls.

Speaker 3:          00:09:48       Okay.

Speaker 4:          00:09:50       And the only thing that I'm basing this on is that the NBA, the Nhl and certainly major league baseball all go back to the 1920s and MLB goes back to like 1889. Um,

Speaker 4:          00:10:04       I dunno, it's weird. It's just a weird fucking thing that like the Patriots have bullied, been good, you know, winning championships and 18 for the last 18 years and we're one championship a wave in 18 years. We somehow are only one championship away from being the most successful tied for the most successful champ NFL team of all time. That makes no fucking sense. It makes no fucking sense. People. Um, anyways, I miss most of the Patriots Steelers game. I caught, uh, the first quarter, first half I basically caught and then, you know, I'm a dad now so I had to go to a kid birthday party and uh, once again, every time I go to one of these parties I am so, feel so blessed that I had a daughter and not a son. Jesus Christ, they're fucking lunatics. Lunatics. I was just like, I used to be like that.

Speaker 4:          00:10:55       You go in there with your daughter and the first thing you're doing you're just fucking, you know, you become like the Dave some Manco and your kid's like fucking Wayne Gretzky. Cause you know somebody is going to do something. You know somebody is going to throw a ball, comes flying off a slide, they have their fucking lunatic. She was the funniest thing. I was watching this kid who has like a little Bobby Hurley. He's playing this game, you know, hitting the ball like using is like both his arms like intellect in his, his, his fingers. It'd be bounced the ball and then use his forearms like a bat, smash it against the wall and then stop it with his hand. And throw it back between his legs, you know, all point guards style and you look like a little Bobby Hurley. So I was getting a kick out of this kid who, this kid, this kid, this kid's got, yeah, he had it, you know what I mean?

Speaker 4:          00:11:39       Like he had like that competitive thing. And then at one point he ran over to go pick up the ball and there was like a couple of, um, the almost like, do you know those, those yoga blocks that help you if you do not stretchy enough, they would like that but were more like cushions. And someone had made a little seed out of them and I had kind of been sitting there like, oh this is nice. Some parent did that cause they didn't want to sit on the hard floor. And I was standing up when the kid came over and he picks up the ball and just sees like two blocks with a bigger block on top of it and he just kicks it over. There was no reason to do it, you know? And I was really just looking at that thinking like, like, wow,

Speaker 1:          00:12:18       did I just see right there in that moment? Why, why there's war? Why, why the world is so fucked up. Why we don't get along because we're like literally wired to just fucking destroy stuff. And I'll tell you something else. With all these fucking people out there who are trying to say that like gender

Speaker 4:          00:12:40       mmm.

Speaker 1:          00:12:42       Gender roles are, are basically taught to kids. Uh, yeah. From what I see when I've seen it, these kid birthday parties that he's just not, it's not even remotely the case.

Speaker 4:          00:12:55       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:12:55       Boys are fucking lunatics. Anything they can pick up, they're going to throw anything. They can just knock over and break. They're going to do it. The girls are like sitting down like behaving themselves. I can't necessarily say shake sharing after a certain age. They're not really sharing. But there definitely like

Speaker 4:          00:13:17       their interactions with boys. It's just kind of like, what the fuck was that? Like they just kind of this sitting there with a toy and a boy just runs up and rips it out of their hands and you just see them looking at it like, like, you know, if you asked me for it, you know, I, I would've given it to you, you know?

Speaker 2:          00:13:38       Okay.

Speaker 4:          00:13:38       So it's going to be interesting with all of these families out here that are trying to prove, I might be wrong, but as far as me just sitting there, it's just boys are absolute fucking lunatics loaded taste. I'll tell you last year, and we had my daughter's a birthday party, they came over and immediately it'll pick it up, gravel in the yard, throwing it down on, thrown in at fucking cars, climbing up on shit every two seconds. Hey, get down from there, get down from there. You know, girls would just go into like the doll house or pick up a toy and they would just sit there and play with it. Um, beyond, beyond, more mature than the boys. The boys, I swear to God, it's like, it's like, uh, I can't say puppies still like, um, do you know after a dog is just afterwards a dog and it knows how to run their like that age, you know where they're going to go get sprayed by a skunk.

Speaker 1:          00:14:35       Um, yeah, fucking hilarious. But um, we had a great time and they had like all, like we went out to this place of good friends of ours and it was at one of those parties. It wasn't at the house, it was like an a destination. So there was one room that had all these games and after you're done with that game, then you go into another place with a bunch of other games and then in the end, you know, all the kids get food, you know, and they're sitting there eating pizza and shit. All of a sudden the cakes, comedy and you know, you know, just the meltdowns. A common, everybody's like going, all right, all right. Trying to time it, they had the cake. We sang happy birthday to starting to whine. I feel look like if we leave now, the meltdowns only going to happen like halfway, uh, on the way back.

Speaker 1:          00:15:16       But fortunately my daughter loves music, so, uh, whenever we drive home, whenever she starts like flipping out, uh, me and Nia just starts singing to her, you know, he just stuck. Ah, wait. Oh, the itsy bitsy spider or the, we'll say, um, uh, what's the other one? Uh, the wheels on the bus go round and round that when she likes Jesus Christ. Who's calling already? It's, it's early in the morning. People who cook at this B, who could this costs off? Fuck, I got to take this, hang on. Hello. I'm back. I just said hello, like I just clicked back to you guys. Um, yeah. Anyways, we just sing all these frigging songs and then she wants to sing along with us in themes is shows, you know, par, par, par puppy dog pals. She loves that Shit. I'll tell you the show. I've been talking about it. I just don't fucking like it.

Speaker 1:          00:16:13       I just don't like that fancy Nancy. I just don't like every, every show. She's like being a Douche in self involved and like totally shallow. And then she allegedly learns a lesson and then the next show she's just a jerk again. There's like no growth whatsoever in this person. You know what I mean? I mean, Van Porino always wants to go back to Transylvania, but she's not hurting anybody. She just gets a little bummed out every once in a while that the other kids aren't blue light car. Right? But fucking fancy Nancy, this little ginger broad over there, dude, she's hanging out with a girlfriend, right? And they're sitting there, they're going to do a fucking dance. And she's like, I'm going to be the sun and you'll be a wrong to be a rainbow. You be the son and a friend Zach. I want to be a peacock.

Speaker 1:          00:17:05       She goes, yeah, but yeah, you can't because it's a rainbow and a peacock doesn't make any sense. It's gotta be the sun and the rainbow. And she goes, well, I want to be a peacock. And she's like, look, you gotta be, you gotta be right, Jen. Say that. But that's the subtext. So then they have this big fucking falling out, you know, cause she's being a cunt again, like she has every fucking episode, every episode she's into like, like, what's the fanciest stuff coming up with a clubhouse that's just her and exclusively her own, you know, she, I swear to God, Dude, God, I'll tell you this right now in the animated world, God blessed the animated man that marries her someday. Fucking lunatic. Fucking, that's going to be one of those fucking chicks, right? He just buy him everything under the every designer keeping up with the car Dashi and fucking love bracelet you could possibly do.

Speaker 1:          00:18:00       And then in a fucking end when she's leaving, yeah. And you're sitting there going, but I bought you all this stuff. She'll be like, I never wanted that. I just wanted to kidnap action. Uh, I swear to God, this is going to be a first 48 with an adult fucking fancy dancy. If she doesn't get her act together, she is. She's going to drive somebody to do something crazy because she doesn't learn any fucking lessons. And she's really shallow. You know, she's a little sociopath. I just, I just don't like sending the end. She does some fucking dance to apologize to a friend. And once again, a friend's going to be friends with her again rather than just being like, hey, you know something, I've been on this ride before you little red cunt. I'm not fucking doing this again. But it's like literally teaching somebody how to stay in a dysfunctional relationship every fucking episode.

Speaker 1:          00:18:49       At least the ones on paying attention to, I just don't like it, you know, I don't be that person just sitting there say they don't have your kid watch step, but like, you know, I don't put my foot down too much as a parent with my wife. Um, well, who's kidding? Who would I put it down? But it's not listened to because it's the dad foot and nobody gives a shit. Nobody gives a shit about the debt. It's all about the mom foot. The mom says it ain't happened in anymore. It ain't happening anymore. The Dad says that they, people just, they just, yes, them to death and then the next day it's like, why is she watching? Why is she watching carrot top here again. Huh?

Speaker 3:          00:19:25       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:19:26       Why is she watching this stuff bill? It's fine. It's just a cartoon. It's just, it's just what you wanted. It's just what you wanted. I don't like that show. Um, anyways. Puppy dog pals, that's where it's at. Okay. There are a couple of pals. They're trying to help out somebody in need, you know what I mean? And you know something and yeah, Bob goes through a lot of little problems, but he's, he's not hurting anybody salted. The Earth Guy, you know, probably could do some squats. It owes shoulder's a little too broad for this little skinny legs. I don't, I don't know what's going on there, but other than that, I don't have a problem with it, you know? So anyways, plowing ahead. I watched Liverpool versus man United. I did watch that game. I saw a little bit of the dolphins, Vikings. Um, how about the browns? About the fucking Cleveland Brown's got a chance to make the playoffs. This is really going to be a fun year if my patriots are not going to win it to share. Okay. What's looking like that? Not, I just hope they lose the fucking first round just so I can enjoy all these other goddamn teams that are going to be in it. It's going to be a,

Speaker 3:          00:20:32       okay,

Speaker 1:          00:20:33       it's really going to be exciting. And all of a sudden, you know, the rams have lost a couple this showing that they're not invincible, that fucking challenges are coming on.

Speaker 1:          00:20:44       You know, there's a fucking chance someone was saying to me yesterday that, that, that they could actually be the NFC and AFC championship games could both be played in Los Angeles. I Dunno about that. Cause the charges get home field advantage. I don't know if they could do that mathematically at this point. Uh, by, I apologize, I'm music better, better up on the sports, but uh, I just, you know, I got the kid now, so, you know, it's only a kid once, something has to give and it's not going to be her. So, um, I did watch Liverpool versus Man United Liverpool scored the first goal and was really carrying the play. And then all of a sudden, man United just really had possession of the ball, um, in Liverpool's and, and, uh, kind of seem like basketball or it's like, you know, to game a runs, you know.

Speaker 1:          00:21:30       And uh, at one point I said something when I was just like, we got to get the fucking ball back. I said, we, and I was like, ah, Shit. It's just something else I care about. I don't totally care about it, but I do find it interesting to watch and I'm actually starting to get into the game. And I remember back in the day when I would hear the crowd applaud when no goal was scored, but they would just applauding the pressure you were putting on. I started like, without thinking about it, doing that yesterday, I was like, I fuck, here we go again. I'm gonna start giving a shit about something else. Um, anyways, but I'm actually going to go on, I should go online now and see if Liverpool has a fucking game. I know I'm going to be out there at some point.

Speaker 1:          00:22:16       That would be sick if I went out there and no, I'm not going to sing. You're never going to be alone or whatever the fuck they sync beads. Some douchey watch three games and all of a sudden we're going to go buy a scarf and stand there. Like I fucking bled there colors. I'm not doing that. I'm just a fucking, let's see here. Just a fucking Newbie fan here. All right. What do we get? billboard.com oh, by the way, did I mention I'm going to be in Europe January 4th through? Where are we? January 4th through the 13th uh, alright, Liverpool. I'm there on the 26 now here's the interesting thing. That's the first. That is the first date on that tour, which means if they have a fucking game on the 25th at home, there's a chance there is a chance I could actually go to that fucking game, right? Liverpool fucking schedule. All right. What do we got here?

Speaker 2:          00:23:14       Okay,

Speaker 1:          00:23:15       come on. Come on one fucking time. Work out for me. One 19 to 14 to 27 it looks like it's an away game, right? Where the fuck did they just play? Yeah, they just played man, man, man United. Right. Oh wait, no, they got a home game. 12:00 PM the day of my show, the fuck Gotti. I'm going Liverpool Verse Watford.

Speaker 4:          00:23:46       I'm going to fucking go. They got one verse, man. You not all their ad in Manchester on the 24th. All right. Don't get greedy built. Don't get greedy. You know what I mean? Don't get greedy. I'm, I'm going to see if I can go to that one on the 27th it says 12:00 PM though. Wait, is, but it's probably going to be at night. I'm thinking 12:00 PM uh, Liverpool time, but it's not going to be, is it? It's going to be my time. They're eight hours ahead. That doesn't make any fucking sense. The games at 10 at night, maybe that's an east coast time and it's at seven. I don't know if that would be at five. I don't fucking know. I'll figure something out. Jesus Christ is going to be nobody at my fucking show.

Speaker 1:          00:24:33       We would love to have gone bill. Um, all right. No booze, everybody. Oh, both freckles came close. He fucking came close a couple of times. He's 22 days in.

Go to stamps.com click on the microphone@thetopofthehomepageandtypeinburrthatstamps.com [inaudible] a righty. Um, oh, you know what I made for the first time? I was second time. First Time I fucked him up. I made some chocolate chip cookies. I'm not good at making the cookies.

Speaker 1:          00:29:10       And this time they finally came out. Right. Cause they made three different batches where I just, uh, often the same batch. I did three different cooks of them. I only had like one cookie sheet and I had to like, you know, my recipe called for only half a tablespoon of a, of a dollop. And I was like, that seems really small. I didn't get how much they spread out. It's like reverse bacon or bacon, like all shrivels up, like the cookie dough spreads out. So, um, my first one that I made it like the whole sheet looked like a giant cookie and I was like, all right, that's not the way to do it. And then the next one will like medium size and then I coat sign it kinda had like the smaller ones, but um, they were damn good. And I use my little kitchen aid thing, you know, second pair of hands, not free advertising.

Speaker 1:          00:29:52       I just love that fucking thing. I love when that thing's turning and I'm over in the counter doing something else. Um, but I learned from the expert. My mother, she told me, uh, you know, she's like, well how did you do it? You know, I'm like, well, you know, I put them in the kitchen out. She's like, you got to fold the flower and you can't use that. He can't use the kitchen aid thing. You want to fold it. And she's trying to say, cause it, uh, you get some air in there. I don't know. Somebody else was saying it has to do with gluten. I have no idea because my cookies seemed a little bit runny yet crispy. And every oven is the diff is different. So I used the classic, um, our version, my family's version of the classic toll house recipe and chocolate chip cookies were invented by a couple of ladies in Massachusetts at this place, this like toll house tavern or something like that.

Speaker 1:          00:30:46       And they would use like a semisweet chocolate chip. And that's what I always use. But I got, you know, my wife told me that she likes milk chocolate. So I said, fine. So I put the milk chocolate ones in there and everybody said they didn't say they were good. They were like, this is the best goddamn chocolate chip cookie I ever tasted. So maybe I'll do a cooking video on that shit, but I can't give away my family recipe so I don't know how to fucking do it. And having said that, I fired up my big green egg for the first time in a long time, and it had these two fucking rib eyes with like literally the fucking, uh, the rib bone sticking out. You could have fucking brain somebody with that when they were frozen. And, um, I got impatient with my green egg.

Speaker 1:          00:31:29       I was told to 50 with indirect heat. It went up to like three 10. So I was like, all right, I'll leave it in there for like 40, 45 minutes instead of doing the full hour. And I then I reverse seared it when I was on the stove. I should only done that for a minute and ended up being under salted and overcooked. Two beautiful pieces of meat and I fucked it up. Um, it just really fucking, it just, it made me sick cause those things where my freezer for a while, but I still ate it and a, I will not waste it. I'm going to eat, I'm going to remember next time to be more patient. That's the biggest thing with the big green egg. You gotta be fucking patient and I'm just not cause that thing is the PR, it was the shit it, we'll just stay at the temperature you want.

Speaker 1:          00:32:12       And I just, you know, it was getting late. We were coming back from the party. I just wanted to put them on here that, you know, when you put it on and uh, ended up fucking him up. So anyways, you, you, you know, I think Alannis Morissette said it best when she said, uh, what, did she say? Something at pot of being ironic? No, she said you live, you learn use update. You let, um, why did she ever have a really good follow up to that, that jagged little pills that, cause she got it all out. It's almost like she should have saved some of the anger for like the next album, you know, like, yeah, but like you, when you were watching a baseball playoff and your team scores 11 runs, you know, when's like 11, two, and as it scoring like runs now by eight, nine, 10, there's always some baseball fan be like, save it for tomorrow night. Why you scored all of them now maybe she should have done that. I don't know baby bill. Maybe you ought to put out a hit fucking album before you criticize somebody else's fucking, uh, one of the albums of the decade. Right? Jagged little pill.

Speaker 2:          00:33:21       Fucking rich. Yeah. Balls. Huh?

Speaker 1:          00:33:25       His scrotum there, whatever the fuck it's, I don't know how it goes. I don't even know. The anatomy aren't your balls and you scroll down the same thing. I have no idea. You know what I mean? And it's like, it's a snare drum, but the things underneath it to call this the snares,

Speaker 2:          00:33:38       it's very confusing sa with path,

Speaker 1:          00:33:45       you know, can you imagine a guy if you wrote a fucking song like that, I remember every breath you take they will like to sunk. It's, it's this guy's a stalker. She puts out a sign.

Speaker 2:          00:33:54       Ha ha ha.

Speaker 1:          00:33:57       Sounded like a flood. She's looking in the guy's fucking house. Terrifying fucking song. And of course when women do it isn't, she's strong and brave.

Speaker 2:          00:34:07       Ha Ha.

Speaker 1:          00:34:11       Poisoned your morning tea. Anyways, plowing ahead here. Guess what I'm doing today at 12 noon. Uh, I'm going to go fly a helicopter there. I flew Saturday for the first time since the end of October. Uh, and I had the best fucking time. Flew great pickups and set downs. We'll fucking is great as they've ever been. Um, and I had taken a lot of time off. Dare I say I'm getting fucking good at it. I landed on top of a building, which I've never done before. Just fucking awesome man. I felt like I was in some like fucking copper procedural show, you know, where is the patient always coming? And now, you know, the beginning is to play in the opening credit poem by, by Dubai and was a fucking freckled pilot. Right. But he's almost fucking see you through. Um, it was always really intimidating because I felt like it would always be like really windy and stuff like that, but uh, I'm a chump. Sure. It could have been, but it was kind of perfect. Conditions came in, there was plenty of room, there wasn't anything sticking up. I always felt like when you would go there, it was just sort of like, um, you know, I've, I've had, I've had to land those things on a,

Speaker 2:          00:35:36       I don't even know what you them,

Speaker 1:          00:35:38       it's like, rather than just setting it down on the ground, there's like a Little Square Hella pad that you land that's actually sitting on the ground and you have to be way more accurate. Then you start getting in your head, you stirring the pot, you get a little wind, what the fuck's going on? And then the ski instructor has to come on the controls with you and then your friends in the back don't respect you as much. You know, it's one of those deals. Speaking of friends in the back, I'm going to be flying with my instructor and uh, and Joe Rogan's coming along. Uh, I've been trying to figure out some time when we could actually do that. We finally have a little bit of time and our schedules could have fly with him. And then on Wednesday I'm going to be doing the Joe Rogan experience podcast and we'll be talking about the flight.

Speaker 1:          00:36:16       Maybe you have some video hopefully or whatever. It's going to be a great time. So please tune into that. And I will be promoting a season three if f is for family and of course the uh, the Patrice O'neil standup comedy benefit, which is happening February 19th, 2019. Trying to get last, the rid of the last couple of hundred tickets on Joe's podcast. I'm all right with that. I've already read the, uh, the advertising. Let's, let's read a little bit of the questions here. Let's read some of the questions. I got to get back to the fucking gym, man. I've been being Mr Mom, you know, now that I've been off the road, you know, cause I, I, you know, want to be with my kid and every morning I just, you know, there's always a reason, you know, not to go to the gym where I'm just like, or I could sit here and read her a book, you know, or we could go to the playground or I could take her for a walk, you know, or I could watch a driver, a little electric car around and then, oh, cleo audio is in town and my trainer who now owns the dog, you know, whenever he comes into town, he brings her.

Speaker 1:          00:37:24       And uh, it was awesome going on. A couple of hikes with her and stuff. I've fucked in love that dog, but she looks great if anybody's concerned. And she has a dog friend now, which I didn't have the skill set to make her comfortable around another dog. So she's like a, she's living her best life. So she really is like an amazing story where she was abandoned, you know, by the La River. She had all these issues. My one of my wife's friends found her, my wife took her in, we kept her for eight years. She lived in the lap of luxury. It got too crazy, you know, she bit, one of my friends, you know, all of this stuff usually ends with a pit bull getting put down and this dog just keeps going to an even better situation and now it has like, you know the dog is like 10 years old now.

Speaker 1:          00:38:15       So I mean it's in, you know, probably the final four or five years of its life and its going to live, you know, now has a best friend you know to hang out with. It's really awesome. It's really awesome. And I still get to see her once every couple of months and um, you know, so I'm happy because I felt like when I got that dog I felt like a responsibility. Like this thing is, is going to live a full life. It's not going to get put down. I didn't anticipate that. I'd have to, you know, give her away to somebody else. But I made sure that when I did, she had a good home, so I feel like I did the right thing, you know? All right. Anyways, that's my little Rni a great guy. You know, talking about myself.

I'd say more like Michigan. And second reason political is that this term comes from times when we were under the Soviet Union. Yes, we fight back, uh, got our India, we fought back on our independence. We are happy and proud about that. I'm sure that you never mean to offend us also. We are not hypersensitive pussies now.

Anyways, my school is in the rose bowl this year. And since you're such a veteran, I was wondering if you had any advice for a first timer. I have the basic tailgating stuff like a grill, beer, and a cooler. Should I bring anything special? Thanks. And Go fuck yourself. Alex. Uh, Alex, uh, bring a chair, brings some lawn chairs, someplace to sit down. Um, depending if you want to hang afterwards and let all the traffic leave, I would bring some firewood that you can put into your little Hibachi and start a little fire and stay warm. Um, what are things that people forget? Uh, don't forget plates. Don't forget Napkins. Bring a trash bag to put all your shit in. Um, condiments.

Speaker 2:          00:46:43       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:46:43       Utensils a table. You don't want to be sitting there having everything in your fucking lap. Uh, what else? Charcoal. Uh, uh, I'd, I'd bring those little squares that make it easy to like the, if you get in the, uh, the wood burning sort of whatever the fucking that natural would charge crap if you're going to do that, unless you, unless you have the match light stuff. Um, a lighter beer bottle opener. Um, butter for the bonds, bonds, it just, everything. I just go over and over and over. A Red Solo cups, booze.

Speaker 1:          00:47:31       I had a jacket for when it gets cold, when he gets your tickets, try to stay on this side with the, uh, with the press box on it. That way you're not staring into the sun for half the fucking game. Um, oh, and before you leave, even when you go to take a Piss, when you're tailgating, find where you are because you're on a golf course. It's all going to look the same. The stadium is round, especially at night. There's no focal point that you're going to be able to find and you will walk around lost. All right. There'll be these little balloons. They're finally lighting them up for years. They did not light them up.

Speaker 2:          00:48:08       Yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:48:09       it's literally one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine. I don't know how high up it goes, but just make sure you remember where you are. Um, pace yourself depending on what time you're going to go. Bring us to Gar. Fewer cigar person. Bring a light or bring a cutter. All of that shit. You think that you, you're gonna, you're gonna Forget. Um, all right, so good luck to Ya. Alright, daughter MMA, a Billy red nose tubes, a belly, the red nose. Pubi I am a 33 year old lady

Speaker 6:          00:48:45       D

Speaker 1:          00:48:46       and I'm also a second degree black belt in.

Speaker 2:          00:48:50       Okay,

Speaker 1:          00:48:51       go. Gee, Guru. Go Djourou karate. I've done martial arts for the last eight years that I have also dabbled in other styles and learned a lot of things for many different instructors. That's awesome. The reason I am writing to you is because I listened to you on Conan. Conan needs a friend podcast, and you've mentioned you wanted your daughter to learn MMA or something, but your wife might not be thrilled about the idea. I was hoping you could tell her that as a small woman, I'm only five feet, that knowing something to protect myself makes me feel better. Being outside or in crowds. I think of it as having insurance. Uh, you hope you never need it, but it's nice to have. Yeah, absolutely. I think all women should know how to do this shit and they should learn it without it being broadcast out there that they're learning it because then the perverts, we'll then start taking classes and try and roll around the mat with you. Not only they'll have a defense against whatever you do, you should spring the shit on them. Not only will you fucking be able to defend yourself, y'all should be able to catch the fucking Douche that's still stolen it and they can lock them up in a perfect world. All right? There are instructors who are very caring

Speaker 1:          00:49:59       and our fathers themselves, they will give your daughter tips and extra advice on how to face men. Since generally speaking, men are stronger. I don't know. I don't think there's anything wrong with sending your daughter to dancing school. Sometimes that can help with your art. Uh, my friend at the Dojo also did ballet, but she said it helped with her foot work. I have a daughter that's three years old and when she's a little older I will be enrolling her at my school, which my husband and also our son daily. Being a martial artist wouldn't make your daughter on feminine. Uh, when you rather she be a little femme fatale you're preaching to the choir here. Exactly. Does any questions I'd love to answer and we'll write back merry Christmas and go fuck yourself. Yeah, thank you. I'm going to, I got to read that to my wife and she'll be like, I never sad that Jay can fac and dad. It's like, yet you did, you did on some level or at least that's the way I heard. That's the way I heard it.

Speaker 2:          00:50:59       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:51:01       Anyways, I've been doing well with my anger. Everybody been doing well with it. Like I immediately now and when I flip out, I start to apologize as I'm doing it and say that I'm being a baby and there has to be a more mature way to settle this. And I swear to God, if you're an angry guy out there, I cannot tell you what that means to the woman in your life. They like,

Speaker 2:          00:51:24       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:51:25       They become the person they were when you met him.

Speaker 2:          00:51:29       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:51:30       You know, a lot of times when your wife or girlfriend changes, it's because you are changing and they're reacting to what you're doing. You know what I mean? Not to give women 100% of fucking pass before all the women listen to this guy and looking at their fucking boyfriend now husband.

Speaker 2:          00:51:46       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:51:47       For one thing women love to do is fucking rubbing it. They can't just be right there. They get out here, see, look at it and fucking push your face right down on the paper where it says there. Right.

Speaker 2:          00:51:56       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:51:58       So, uh, yeah, that's going to be my thing. And I'm going to, I think I might go back to therapy next year just specifically to talk about my anger and get this thing sorted out and uh, you know, and I keep threatening. Then I might start going to Sunday church again regularly, even though I don't believe in any of it. I like it just as a way to reset and just kind of sit and think as I block out all the bullshit that's being said to me. Just sit there and think it'd be like, what's important? What do I need to do, you know, get your shit together, you know, don't be a dick. Um, life is flying by. All right. Friend wants to get matching tattoos. Oh. [inaudible] all right. A Billy Burnett. Uh, so I've known this girl for going on five years now. We both still remember the night we met and the developed a close intimate relationship sense. Yeah. Boy, we were together officially earlier this year, then broke up. And it was during this time she got a tattoo to symbolize the loss she felt after our breakup. We've since started talking again and we went to, uh, we went out to a concert together in San Francisco and fell in love all over again.

Speaker 1:          00:53:21       Well, since we've returned, she asked me how I'd feel about getting a tattoo matching hers.

Speaker 3:          00:53:28       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:53:28       Yeah. No, yeah, don't do that. Uh, we're not officially back together, but I think that meaning behind this tattoo is deeper than that. I feel like I'm connected to this girl regardless if I'm with her or not. So I wouldn't regret it even if I didn't talk to her ever again. I'm leading towards yes as obviously I really liked this girl, but I need an outsider's perspective. It'd be my first and probably only tattoo and it's not, and it's nothing ridiculous. Just a word on the forum, no name or anything like that. She's beautiful and we get along like best friends as well as lovers. What do you think? Uh, yeah, dude, I, you don't get a matching tattoo with a woman ever. And it may be if you're 25 years into being married and the kids have all moved out of the house.

Speaker 3:          00:54:23       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:54:24       You don't do that. Don't, don't fucking do that. Okay. Because you've already broken up. It seems like a very volatile emotional relationship. Um, you know, you're my soulmate. I love you. Fuck you. We're breaking it up. I got a tattoo. A, it's talking about how sad I was, wasn't we broke up and now we're getting back together and now we need to get matching tattoos. I mean, this is, it's why wouldn't when, when the, when the emotions level off a little,

Speaker 3:          00:54:51       okay,

Speaker 1:          00:54:51       okay. And you're in the grind of a relationship and you guys don't run from that. They can actually hang, there's no fucking reason to do that because if you end up fucking breaking up, which, who's kidding, who, that sounds like there's a 50 50 chance you will now you got this fucking tattoo on your arm and then you're going to get with the next person. You know, the person you ended up where maybe the person ended up being with and she's going to be like, what's that? And He, oh, this is this tattoo that I got from a past relationship that another woman also is walking around with and she's, can you think if you fucking think that that's going to stay there?

Speaker 3:          00:55:27       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:55:27       The only reason why I would say to do it is because there's still that laser fucking surgery though. Don't get like regret or missing you or butterfly, whatever the fuck my butterfly, whatever the fuck she has an arm. All right. She fucked up. She did that. You didn't. So you know, this is, you know, this is a good like lock the door test in the relationship to be like, yeah, I don't want to do that. I don't have any tattoos. I'm not a tattoo guy. I respect the fact that you did that. I respect what that means and what that means on your arm is in my heart and I don't need to draw it on my arm and it, if that is a deal breaker and you're going to break up with me then then that, that's fucking great. I didn't do it. Okay. Don't do it. You hear me, sir? Do not.

Speaker 3:          00:56:14       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:56:15       You know, let me ask you this. If you got the tattoo and she didn't do it, would you break up with her?

Speaker 1:          00:56:20       The answer's fucking no. Then why the fuck should that be a deal breaker the other way around? If the answer is yes, then you're fucking crazy. And I hope she's crazy too. And uh, you have a positive kid. Two negatives make a positive. I don't, I don't want to fuck. I just wouldn't do it. I wouldn't do it. All right? I thought many times in my younger time life of getting a tattoo and I never did and I'm so glad I did now because I feel like not having a tattoo is like rebellious or not even rebellious. It's unique.

Speaker 2:          00:56:52       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:56:53       Especially now. You know, I saw the first fucking person that wasn't like a pop star walking down the street with like a fucking face tattoo and they were coming across the street. I was like, what in the fuck is that? Like I didn't know. Like I, I couldn't tell why the person just look different until they got up close and it's like, oh my God. Oh my God. They drew on their face. You draw my face. Um, do destroys airport ticket machine. Ah,

Speaker 1:          00:57:22       oh, please tell me this is true. That literally made my entire body just relax. Hey, hey. Hey Billy. Ginger nuts. A lot of stuff about my private sis week.
