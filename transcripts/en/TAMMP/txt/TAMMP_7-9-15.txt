Speaker 1:          00:01          Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:02          Hey, what's going on? It's bill burr and

Speaker 3:          00:06          yeah,

Speaker 2:          00:09          just checking in on your hair on a Thursday afternoon, just before Friday. Monday morning podcast. What's going on? How are Ya? Don't I sound chipper today? You know why? Cause I go to the gym every day. It's just become a pop me life.

Speaker 3:          00:27          Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:29          Well you go to that gym every day. You can't. We really mean it. Um, actually I've just been eating right and a oh Billy Bush face, you know, read it booze bag. I haven't drank in four days and I feel great. You know why? Because it's the morning when you don't drink. You feel great in the morning when you don't drink, you feel horrific at night. You can hear the fucking clock ticking. And me just trying to fall asleep. I almost picked up a book last night. Anything to get me to fall asleep and I'll tell you nothing. Nothing makes me fall asleep. Like reading a book. I don't know how these fucking nerds do it big and just sit there all God damn day reading a book. He's fucking idiots. So jump on a God damn a unicycle and they're still reading the book. Now, unicycle a on an elliptical. There you go. One of those, one of those things where your legs are moving but you're not.

Speaker 1:          01:30          Okay.

Speaker 2:          01:30          Well, technically you are, but you're not going anywhere. It's a metaphor. Um, life is like an elliptical machine. It goes round and round. But do you ever get anywhere? You know, next thing you know there's some fucking nerd with glasses blowing you and you're like, you know what? I liked this life of being a poet. I needs an itchy sweater and let his beard grow out and I think I got something going on here. Um, yeah, so I haven't drank in like four days. I am. I'm on the wagon. All right. I've got the Montreal comedy festival coming up. That's going to be a tough one. I'm not going to lie to you. That is going to be a tough one. Being up there with all my buddies telling a little knock knock who's there over there and a, not drinking afterwards, but I can get through it, you know? Um, I had one cigar this week only because I had one leftover from, um, from my July 4th cookout that I had. And it was so, there was so fucking amazing. I had to, uh, I had to smoke it. I couldn't fucking throw it out. It's, I don't even know how to say the name of this fucking thing. Let's see.

Speaker 1:          02:35          Okay.

Speaker 2:          02:36          It looks like Hotman or h up man, I can't tell. Does it looks like there's a little dot there. My eyes are going here. Havana, Cuba. Um, this fucking cigar was one of those cigars. As I was lighting it, I was lighting the thing and did the first couple of, you know, to get it going. And I went, oh my God. I was by myself sitting on my front porch and I said out loud, oh my God, to nobody. You had already tasted like the middle of the cigar on a great cigar. And that was me just lighting it. And um, I sat out there, no booze actually, like something sweet, you know, with my cigar. I'm not one of those guys and wants to have a smokey whiskey with it. It's like redundant. You're already got smoke in your mouth and you got dad.

Speaker 2:          03:22          And sometimes I don't mind it, but I like something sweet with my cigar, which is why I usually hang out with Joe to Rosa when I smoke. Hey, thank you. Thank you. Thank you. There you go. That right there. That was a singer. Well, my old buddy Joe Rosa Joe's got a little sugar in his tank. He can't help it. Um, anyways. Um, so anyways, uh, I been working out and I already knocked off a couple of pounds. First day I had to weigh in, you know, the big before picture, I went up there like a fucking hairless seal and albino seal. Just, I didn't even, I couldn't even move my legs at that point. Just I just fucking went up on a scale, you know, and a one 86.6, which wasn't bad because I was pushing one 90. And uh, I got on the scale this morning. I was a buck 84.6.

Speaker 2:          04:15          I dropped a couple pounds. The first week is always easy because your body is so used to you just be enough such a cunt, you know, drinking whiskey while ordering cake and all of a sudden if you just have one bowl of oatmeal, it's such a shock to your system that you'll actually drop a couple pounds. Unfortunately after a week they like a bodies just like, oh so this is the new gang, this is the new game. Because you're thinking like well shit, I'm going to drop two pounds every four days. I'll be, I'll be in shape by August 1st and then what happens to another six days goes by and your lost like half a pound, you know? And that's when you got to man up and not become depressed and bury your face in a bag of Cheetos. So many ways. So I'm just bringing all of this shit up to you guys. So you guys will be checking in on me the way I check in on you. You know?

Speaker 1:          05:06          Yeah.

Speaker 2:          05:06          Cause if I get off it, you know, I'm going to get off it cause I won't talk about it in more than you'd be like, Hey, you'd have fat face. What's the matter? Joe Matters at scale going in the wrong direction there. Um, I actually did a spot at the comedy store the other night. I had a great time and I came home, I hadn't looked at my Twitter account a couple of days. Um, and I went on there and somebody said that they were there and they could tell I was drinking. They said I was a fat fuck. I'm not gonna lie to you. It really hurt. And I said it to Nia. She goes, oh, that's me and why would they do that? I got, you don't have to do me a favor. Do me a favor. Came from a place of love. And even if it came from a place of hate, it probably just has to do with the fact that they don't like their dad some shit or they get beaten in gym class. I don't know what it is. Or maybe I said something that they don't like. Um, so anyways, speaking of stand up, that was fucking brutal. What happened? Amy Schumer watching them go after her about a joke two years and she told the joke two fucking years ago.

Speaker 2:          06:07          How'd he tell a joke? And it takes somebody two years to get fucking offended by it.

Speaker 1:          06:12          You know what I mean?

Speaker 2:          06:14          I don't, I don't fucking understand that. Two weeks for two fucking years. It's not a fee. Why all of a sudden is it? Oh, that's right. That's right. She has a giant movie coming out. This is a critical part of her career going from a comedian TV star to now movie star. Like that movie's gonna. You can see some, some of you just know like, I don't want to jinx it, but that in that movie looks like it's going to be a smash. Right? So these fucking cops, they know that that day you go, there you go, you got something to lose and then they go in and they bullied you as just the fucking worse, you know?

Speaker 1:          06:53          Okay.

Speaker 2:          06:53          As just a fucking worst. And then you get, you got to apologize for something you fucking said to. And then, yeah, there's this dead shirk off in the Washington Post is like, and I know it's a joke, but like that doesn't, it doesn't matter. It's like, yeah it does. It completely fucking matters. It told the totally fucking matters. Like there's no difference between actually meaning it and joking around like what world do you fucking live? And I'm just beside myself with that thought process and this does this fictional power that they think comedians have. Like as if somebody walks in to a comedy show, not racist. And then they sit down and then they hear a joke and then the like, oh wait a minute, now I'm racist. You know, or our, or vice versa. They walk in racist and then you say something and then you have the ability to change their fucking minds to not be racist. If comedians really had that power, what we did would be fucking illegal.

Speaker 1:          07:56          Okay.

Speaker 2:          07:56          Because the government wouldn't stand for it. They wouldn't have, you couldn't fucking have that kind of power can imagine if you just walked on stage. And just said, Shit. And then people just went out and did it and they, and they completely changed for the rest of their life. That's it. Hey, you guys got to start eating right. Do still do some sit ups and get yourself a six pack and everybody in the crowd just okay. And gets up and does it.

Speaker 1:          08:17          Okay?

Speaker 2:          08:17          It's ridiculous. People are going out to a comedy club to just blow off some steam, have a good time, have a couple of drinks and laugh. All right? And if you don't like a joke, you don't like a joke, but the comic doesn't owe you a fucking apology. You know what I mean? You just didn't like that joke. And it is a joke despite how you took it. So go fuck yourself and comedians. Stop apologizing. Please. For the love of fucking God. Stop fucking apologizing because all you're doing is you're just building up these, these paper tigers. Um, this is unreal. This is like, it's like, it's like, I thought we already went through all this Lenny Bruce, George Carlin getting arrested. Shit are we hadn't back towards it. Is

Speaker 4:          08:56          that what's going to happen? I don't know. Um,

Speaker 2:          09:00          anyways, I'm thinking about the shit that I say on this fucking podcast. Huh? How come nobody ever gets offended by this shit? You know why? Cause I don't have a movie

Speaker 4:          09:08          coming out.

Speaker 2:          09:10          That is the genius. That is the genius of being under the radar. You're not going to get any traction getting offended by me. You got to wait. I got that F for fair. I'm predicting right now thatF is for family. When that shit comes out, somebody is going to be like in a podcast in 2010 but only if it's a hit. It's a hit show. Um, fucking ridiculous. It doesn't matter if it's a joke or not. It doesn't matter if you were serious or not. Oh, okay. Is that, how, is that how the world works? A lot of these people that complain about that, especially the racial jokes, I, they just reek of people that like, you really just only hang out with people in your culdesac

Speaker 2:          09:51          because anybody who has like, like a wide variety of friends, this shit that we say to each other about each other's races and nationalities and it's fucking hilarious. Like you totally joke a joke around about food stereotypes, all of that shit all the fucking time these people do. They just have like a list of fucking words like gauge wire, Doral. Good Dave lives. I'll bet. All right. They'll shut the fuck up. We get it. Okay. All right, cool. So anyways, I um, I had a fucking, I had to go to the doctor this week, right? Um, he has been getting on me. I got in in my, my leg, I got a, I get this varicose vein on my calf. It's not bugging me or anything, but it's starting to look a little gnarly, you know what I mean? And she goes, why don't you have somebody to go down and take a look at it?

Speaker 2:          10:39          It's like I might have somebody cut out my fucking leg. And she goes, no, they just inject something in there. Fucking, you know, the vein collapses and you're good. So I go, ah, fuck it. I'll go down there. So I call up these people to one 800 number. They got like 12 different fucking locations around the country. I'm like, it already doesn't seem reputable to me. So I called them up and they're like, yeah, you know, blood. And they go, what's your name? Where do you live? And I go, why do you need to know where I live? I don't want you to know where I live. I'm going down there. Well, we need to know for the billing of insurance. I go, I have shitty insurance. I don't have good insurance. All right, I know I'm going to give you my insurance card. You're going to say, we don't take that and then I'm going to have to pay for it.

Speaker 2:          11:19          So I'm just going to pay cash. Why do you need to know where I live? And she goes, because that's how we, that's part of our policy. And I go, why? She goes, I just told you why I go, no you didn't. You just said it's part of your policy. I want to know why that's part of your policy. She just kept going. I just told you why I go, no you didn't. So finally she gets her fucking supervisor and now we need, we need an address. So you know what I did? I just gave him a fake address, which is what I'm doing from now on. Just give him a fake address.

Speaker 4:          11:51          Okay.

Speaker 2:          11:52          I gave it to him and then go down there. I show up at the doctor's office and they never said, hey, your address didn't check out. They didn't. So now it's great too. I got that misinformation out there about where I might, where I live, but when they go to sell it to some other corporation. So I walk in there and you know, uh, there's two, two ladies on the phone, uh, one young. And what about in her thirties? The young ones got like jeans, like ripped jeans on and stuff like that. And, um, you know, I walk up, so I walk up and there's two fucking clipboards to sign in and they're both on the phone. So I just signed it on the one in front of the ripped jeans go, right? So I go and I sit down and she gets off the phone, she looks at me and then she goes with their index finger, like, come here. You know what I mean?

Speaker 2:          12:44          And I stand up and then I'm like, wait, did she use summons me over like a fucking toddler? And I walk up and she goes, do you have an appointment? And I'm like, yeah. She goes, what's your name? I'm like, William Barr. She goes, Oh, you must be at the other office. And she, and she points to the lady next to me. She goes, we're two separate offices. And I go, all right. So then I talked to the, the 35 year old chick and meanwhile this, this, the young girl gets on the phone, she picks up, she's like, where the hell are you guys? God, I'm starving. Are you going there right now? I'm going to kick your ass like this isn't like a medical office. So they tell me to fill out the whole form. I start filling out the form, then they go, we need to see your driver's license. I go for what? They go, well, we need to make a copy of it. I go, no, you're not making a copy of my driver's license. You can look at it. Here it is. Here's my face. But you're not, you're not taking, you're not making a copy of it. And just, she goes, well that's what we do. I go, what do you, and what do you do with the copy? And she goes, it stays here in the office. I said, yeah, I'm not doing that.

Speaker 4:          13:50          Okay.

Speaker 2:          13:51          And I go, why do you need a copy? I don't understand why. So she goes, let me check with my manager and she can, you know, and then she comes back and said, yeah, we need a copy of your driver's license. You never needed this shit beforehand. By the way, all these fucking, uh, slowly moving us towards micro chips are everywhere. I go in and see your papers please. And everybody's got to know fucking, you know, like give you my driver's license, my fucking driver's license number on it and shit, go fuck yourself.

Speaker 4:          14:17          Yeah.

Speaker 2:          14:18          Fucking a steer in a strip mall. I'm not giving you a fucking copy of my driver's license. So anyway, she says, yeah, I just talked to my boss. He says, we need a copy of your driver's license. So I go, why? And then the, the little fucking half a cutie pie, they're fucking chimes in. She goes, cause it Blahblahblahblahblah and I just look at her and go, you don't work here.

Speaker 2:          14:44          She put her head down and mumbled something. It just fucking made my day. There's nothing than one is six thinks she's a 10 she was such a fucking dope. I'm not going to lie to you. She was cute, but she thought she was the fucking shit and she wasn't. There's just the way she was talking on the phone, how she was like, so over the fucking job. It's like you're a fucking dope. You're a fucking dope. I don't know who you know that gave you this fucking job, but I've been in for six minutes and you suck at it. You fucking suck at it. So anyways, so I got all, I'd say you need a cop. My driver's license. I go, I find to go give me the clipboard. So I, I take the clipboard with all the information I wrote down and I just fucking folded it up and I just walked out.

Speaker 2:          15:30          I should've said no dirty looks cause I know that fucking little Twat was probably given me a dirty look. But that's the fucking, you know, sitting here having this, this fucking dope Curson into the God damn telephone and then I'm going to be, I'm comfortable with you injecting something into my body. Can't the fuck outta here it, the whole thing just felt shady. You know when I first got there, there was this fucking guy from like Transylvania came, he came out with just like a tee shirt on and I'm looking like, is this fucking guy? Is this the doctor that this guy just fix the radiator? Then I found out he was a fucking patient. And, uh, I dunno, just still his whole vibe. It looked like they were back there doing experiments on them. I just didn't like it. And you know, it was, it was next, it was in this one.

Speaker 2:          16:15          I was fucking strip malls where it's like, hey varicose veins, you want your taxes done. You know, and then some Asian thing that makes noodles, it's like, I'm gonna have something medical procedure here. I'm not doing this shit. So, uh, my, you know what my gut was screaming at me the second I walked in there, but, um, I dunno. I Dunno. I fucking was laughing the whole way out to my truck that go, Eh, it's because of blah, blah, blah. I'm like, Hey, you don't work here. She had to put her head down and then she mumbled something trying to pull victory out of that fucking devastating defeat. Who's kidding? Who, it wasn't devastating to her. He's probably wind development. Somebody bought her a new iPhone, you know, cause they think that they're going to fuck her, you know. Anyways, I was actually telling a buddy of mine that he was going, man, I hope my daughter doesn't end up like that.

Speaker 2:          17:03          And I said, now you already would have sought, she's three years old. You can tell if a kid's going to be a dope or not by the time they're three, you know, I'm not saying you can't, you can't tell if they're going to be on drugs. So make a bad choice in that teens. But you can tell whether or not you actually got somebody who got the a brain. You know, and I'm not talking fucking Einstein, I'm just saying like, you know, they're on point, they're talking to you, they're locked in, you're giving them information, they're processing it, you know, and then he got to be brave. Those almost smart people, they're the funniest people because they on some way they kind of know that dumb, you know, cause straight up dumb people don't know that dumb. They just always think that they're getting fucked, which is why they have that dumb look on their face.

Speaker 2:          17:45          That's why their jaws always hanging open and their brows kind of furrowed cause they can't figure out what the fuck happened. You know? But somebody gets to be brain. They actually know that they're kind of dumb and you see them catching themselves and they'd look around the table like, wow, did anybody just catch that? And there's an intelligence in that and that's why I grade them as a B right at right now you guys should be sitting there going pill. We obviously know that you actually are so fucking arrogant that you think that you got the a brain, which right there immediately knock, shoot down to at least a B. Because anybody who's truly intelligent doesn't think they are. They think they're a fucking moron. I was got lost in all of that. Anyways, speaking of being a fucking moron, did you see what Jason Pierre Paul did? And God knows, I know even with nine fingers, this guy could still throw me over my house, but what? What the fuck? What the fuck are you doing? What will you lighten off that blew off your finger? I don't understand people that like it's the 4th of July. I get it. A couple of bottle rockets have a Roman candle fight, you know, put on some goggles. I get it a little grab ass with some fireworks who gives us, but these people who like fucking go to like military grade shit.

Speaker 1:          19:01          You know what I mean?

Speaker 2:          19:03          What the fuck did you light off that you made the decision that you know what, just amputate my finger. I got to get back out on the field now. My God, that's a bad finger to fucking lose to. That's second in command to the thumb. Like the thumbs, the headliner, the index finger, right. That's the feature act.

Speaker 1:          19:27          Okay.

Speaker 2:          19:28          I'd say the Middle Finger is the host and then your ring finger and you're a pinky or doing guest spots. Right. They're not getting paid. They're doing guest spots. Right. Um,

Speaker 2:          19:42          anyways, so he blew off. There's no feature act anymore. So now he basically has like a, like a lobster claw in our lobster cloud would be if they were all fucking together. I don't know man. But all I know is he had three options with the finger and one of them was amputated. And uh, I mean, hey, I like playing football. I liked when I was a kid, but you know, I like playing drums too, but I would never hit, I'd be like, you know what, why don't we wait a minute? So this fucking thing on, you know, see how it goes before I just said, you know what? Fuck it.

Speaker 1:          20:18          Yeah,

Speaker 2:          20:18          no, it's gotta be funny as his custom gloves they have to make during the winter time, those four fingered once he's got like a Bart Simpson and now you know, cause animation, they always had those things. I don't know. Why am I joking about something so horrific? I just, you know what it is just because he just made the decision to say fuck it. Just cut the fucking thing off the, granted it has like most people when it comes to this story, I have absolutely no information other than, you know, somebody texted me and said Jpp had his index finger amputated. Um,

Speaker 1:          20:48          okay.

Speaker 2:          20:49          I Dunno. All I know is that every NFL contract from here on out now has that word. It's somewhere in there. If they didn't already, I know you're not allowed to ride a motorcycle. I don't think fly a private fly yourself to get a pilot's license or something. You're not allowed to do any of that shit. Probably you have to Larry Bird. If it taller than six, six, you're not allowed to blacktop your parents fucking driveway. Um,

Speaker 2:          21:18          I dunno. What the fuck. You know what's funny about the giants? They can beat the fucking patriots, but Jesus Christ, they give, they can't get to a fucking off season without just somebody doing something. Right. I was just talking to [inaudible] about that. He goes, Jesus Christ, you know, the fucking shooting themselves in the legs. Fucking cut in their face off. But I'll tell you when it cops, they beat them patriots. Eh, uh, you know what? I don't give a shit because we want our fourth and I'll take four out of six. I'll take two losses to the giants for four or six. And speaking of that, speaking of giants fans, I'm doing Rappaport's. I am Rappaport's podcast tomorrow and I'm expecting that's sad sack New York fan to come strong with the giants shit talk, which should be great. It's like, yeah, but then we want another one, Michael, that we want another one. We've won four.

Speaker 1:          22:12          Okay.

Speaker 2:          22:13          Since 2000 since February of 2002 we've won four super bowls. We have won the most super bowls out of any team in the NFL. So I will take those to crushing losses to the giants to win four. I will make that trade any day of the week. And then to add three world series Stanley Cup and an NBA championship doing all Anna for soccer championship to evidently, what do we the Boston fucking tea parties. I don't know what the hell we are. The liberty. Oh that's a fucking WNB 18 I have no idea. Right.

Speaker 1:          22:45          Okay.

Speaker 2:          22:46          We, we one in five different sports. Ah. I mean I'm gonna hit him with the same shit. She'd be like, Michael, you have 10 teams in New York City. You guys cannot find in any combination attended when all four in 10 years. You just have not been able to do it ever. It's fucking pathetic. How many teams do you need to stay in step with title town, Boston, Massachusetts. Um, that right there, that's a one sided. That's a one sided. Uh,

Speaker 1:          23:13          okay.

Speaker 2:          23:14          Idea of what the fuck that they're going to then I'm going to be talking about on his podcast. I'm also been playing a bunch of drums. I'm getting ready for a, I'm doing the Goddamn comedy jam up the Montreal Comedy Festival. I'm going to be doing it three nights Monday, Tuesday and Thursday. Um, I think the 20th, 21st and 23rd I'll be doing it. And so I've been playing a lot of drums and uh, just having a fucking great time. Just a great time. I could basically, man, I have my summer, you know, after all the traveling I did crisscross in the land. I got like the summer off from what I'm trying to do is not fill up every day with activities. Uh, cause that's what I ended up doing. And then it ends up being unbelievably stressful. I mean, I don't have it off off. I get a fucking punch up.

Speaker 2:          24:04          All these episodes of F is for family and I got to tell you to do it. It's coming together. It's coming together and I've been watching a lot of animation, Lotta Gotcha. Bob's burgers. Um, what else did I watch? Those chickens that smoke weed. Um, and I'm not even listening to the jokes. I'm looking at the movements because, you know, they always give you the lowest fucking budget ever when it comes to animation. So I'm trying to fucking, uh, see how with the limited movement, like on Archer, if you look at it, they really don't move that much, but you know, they just have the eyebrows going up, coming down. I squinting, you know, and an occasional fucking hand movement. Um, so I'll be doing that, but still that will feel like a vacation as opposed to fucking flying all around. Oh, by the way, did you guys check out rolling stone this, uh, this week or whatever?

Speaker 2:          24:59          Um, Kim Kardashians tits and Kim Kardashians are on the cover and a, they got an article in there about this guy who all he does is fly around. That's all he does. He has not had a home. I don't know. I don't even get it. He's been in the air since August in the air or at an airport waiting to connect since April of last year. You know, he'll still spend the night at like a five star hotel and then go right back to the airport. And, uh, he's sitting there saying how like he learned how to work the system. There's all these ins and outs and all that type of stuff. It's a really fascinating story because immediately I'm like going like, dude, who's getting fucked in this deal? You're not really living a life. But he turned it into a business where everybody gets advice from him now and now he's allegedly a millionaire.

Speaker 2:          25:46          So I think that sacrifice, he was able to do it, but it's a really, um, really interesting. I just don't understand it. Like this fucking guy, like he set the record crossing the Pacific Ocean like six times in like, I don't know how many days that can't be healthy, cannot be fucking healthy. But you know, he flies like, you know those double decker, uh, air buses, they have this, this thing where you get your own apartment on one of them and one of the Singapore Airlines was the first one that, that had it. And the ticket is $15,000 and this dude has so many miles. He gets it by himself and he's sitting there acting like he's winning. But it's just like, dude, but you just lit even that's cool in the air. But if you had that as an apartment, you'd be like, this fucking sucks. I can't even breathe in here.

Speaker 2:          26:38          Not to mention there's a camera on me at all fucking times, making sure I don't one out of fucks something in this bed. Right? If you had that on the ground, you'd be like, this is fucked up. You have it in the air. You think this is the shit. But if all you're doing is living in the air, like I don't know, but in the end if he was a millionaire and he enjoyed it, I don't know, check out the article. It's really a really fucking interesting. So we're winding down here on the podcast. Uh, I need you guys to help me out if you could. I'm looking for a car and a Craiglist seems to be the best way to do it. Um, I've pretty much checked all of California. I'm looking for a 65 or 66 Ford galaxy in Wimbledon white and all I'm looking for, uh, is that it has a straight body, not all rusted out, none of that shit.

Speaker 2:          27:31          The body's straight and the interior is solid, doesn't even have to be meant as long as it's solid. It looks like, you know, most everything is there and then either no engine or a non original engine, cause I just can't get myself to take the original numbers matching engine out of a car. I just can't fucking do it. Um, that's what I'm looking for. I thought you could do a nationwide search on, um, on craigslist, but you can't, you got to go state by state. So if you live in a state, check it out. Um, you know, if he got time, if you don't, I understand. But that's what I'm looking for and just tweet at me. Send me the links if you find one. Um, cause that's what I'm looking for. I've got my truck back in, you know, like I said, they, they rebuilt the whole engine, painted the thing that Ford blue and it's running like a top and the power steering just came in and then waiting on the air conditioning and the slap that fucking thing on.

Speaker 2:          28:27          And uh, that's gonna be my daily driver. I've been driving it all over the place. I absolutely fucking love that truck. And uh, and only want to do is just get a 65 Ford galaxy and you know, Redo that thing. What I want to do is I want to have the underneath be 2015 and then up top in 1965 and just be able to drive that thing across country if I wanted to. Um, cause I only got three gears in my truck. I mean I could've switched it out, made it an automatic or even just had a five speed put in, but I just feel like shifted on the columns to fucking cool. So when I get on the highway I just drive it like a granny and when the first lane going like 50 miles an hour build, no one gives a fuck. Well I do, I give a fuck.

Speaker 1:          36:25          Okay,

Speaker 3:          36:27          good.

Speaker 1:          36:34          Okay.

Speaker 3:          36:46          Yeah. Recently

Speaker 5:          36:49          I had to return some items at the mall. Uh, was the day after Christmas and I was with a girl, I was dating, uh, with the girl that I was dating. She wants to return some shoes. So we went to the journey store with his shoes were, but uh, when she got to the counter to return the shoes, the girl behind the counter asked her for her name, address, email, and phone number. Oh my God. The amount of fucking people who actually give out that information. My girlfriend just gave the information over. As soon as the girl asked for it, we were leaving the store. I remark that I thought it was bullshit that she had to give away personal information to return a pair of shoes. She said, uh, it was not a big deal, but I didn't like it. All right. Why the fuck would you give somebody all that information and just in case you're new to my podcast, just say you can say no.

Speaker 6:          37:42          Okay.

Speaker 5:          37:43          Can I, you know, I, I go out to buy shit all time. Could I have your phone number? No.

Speaker 6:          37:48          Okay.

Speaker 5:          37:49          I don't even say, I don't even try and make it nice. I just say no and then they go, oh, okay.

Speaker 6:          37:55          Yeah.

Speaker 5:          37:55          Know why do you feel like you got to give them their information? You're trying to buy something. I'm sorry I can't, I can't show you this unless I get your information. Well, they go fuck yourself. I'll buy it somewhere else. I don't even need it. Anyways. So anyways, he goes, next we go to American Eagle. You guys hit all the hot spot, Huh? Then we went to Cinnabon. Next we went to American Eagle where I had to return his shirt. That was a gift. It was a long line for returns. Why did you return the shirt? Did it not fit or was it ugly as hell or was it both? As I was waiting in line, one of the employees comes up to me with a clipboard with the little form to fill up. Now is anybody else kind of getting the prison camp vibe here? You know, they're standing in line to get processed and there's a guy coming up on the, is your name please? Your phone number? Um, I stopped the employee. Uh, I stopped the employee and asked her why she needed this information and she says that it was to verify my purchase. How fucking dumb our people. You're gonna verify my purchase. Well, here's the sales slips there, sweetheart. This verifies it.

Speaker 6:          39:06          Yeah,

Speaker 5:          39:07          that's it. I don't know what to tell you. Why don't you and your clipboard? Why don't you hold that clipboard between your little fucking beef curtains and take a fucking walk down the street? How about that as sweetheart, it's there. This their reasons. You use that type of language. Go Fuck Yourself. Huh? How about I fucking grab that ponytail and just, no, let's, let's, let's let, let, let's keep it clean this week, shall we? People anyways, she, he goes before I could protest further, she said that I could just put my name on it. Oh, on the clipboard.

Speaker 6:          39:39          Okay.

Speaker 5:          39:40          When she walked away, I pulled out the gift receipt has said to my girlfriend, oh, here it is. Yeah. This is what verifies my purchase. Exactly. The clipboard employee wasn't as far as way as I thought she was in. Heard me say, did I read that wrong? Get heard me say it's heard me say this, and she began to explain further why I needed to give over the information. This is the part of the email I hate. He goes, I apologized and told her. I realized it wasn't her and that it was just her company's policy that she was enforcing. She walked away again. I felt bad. So the next time I saw her I apologized and said, I realized that she was just doing her job, but she ignored me. She was probably pissed because it was the day after Christmas and I was causing your grief, but you could at least accept my apology.

Speaker 5:          40:24          You Bitch. Um, I love how you go from being totally liberal and seeing somebody fucking side of it too, being yeah, man up you can't. Um, anyway, I got up to the counter and there wasn't any further problems. The guy at the register just took my name and didn't ask me for anything. I felt as though I had a small victory against the big corporations. Then this week I had to go back to the store to return a hat. My girlfriend, God, did you guys not make Christmas lists or all your relatives blind? The seems to be a lot of, uh, returning of gifts.

Speaker 6:          40:57          Okay.

Speaker 5:          40:58          This is hilarious. You are returning a hat that your girlfriend got you dude. How horrific was that hat? Can you please send me a picture of it before I, if you took one before you returned it. Picture one of those, uh, plaid Charlie Chaplin Hat. Um, I had the receipt, but again, the girl at the register asked me for my address and phone number. I said I didn't want to give that information to her immediately panic sets in and her face and she says that I have to, I said that I didn't have to the day after Christmas and I wasn't going to now, good for you. She calls over a coworker and they both get defensive and hold to the idea that I have to give over my information in order to return a stupid hat. Even though I had my receipt, I asked why and they let me slide. Why the let me slide on this before and they maintained that I had, I had to give them my name, address and phone number.

Speaker 6:          41:49          Okay.

Speaker 5:          41:50          So what did I do in the face of corporate opposition? I caved and I gave it to him. You fucking pussy.

Speaker 6:          41:59          Okay,

Speaker 5:          41:59          dude. The second you saw the panic on their face, you knew that they were going to lose. All right. He goes, I just don't get it, Bill. Why is a receipt not enough? Nowadays it is enough. They say they need our personal information to verify purchase then not, dude, they're not. All right. All of that shit. All those little save you know you want to get when our discount store, they're creating a file on you. They figure out what you want to buy, what they can market towards you, and then they take that information and they sell it to other fucking companies. Even though they say they're not going to. They sell your information. Your information gets up on the Internet and that's why there's all these creepy websites out there right now that have all this fucking information about you, about, you know how many siblings you have, your brothers and sisters names. They all use that information to fucking, it's, I'm telling you this, don't give him your information. You don't have to give him your information and people out there

Speaker 5:          43:04          who just have this fucking attitude towards these corporations just sitting there going like, wait, what are they going to be? As long as you're not doing anything wrong. I mean, what do I care if they know where I live? What do I keep this fucking morons? I don't even, I have explained this shit till I'm blue in the face and then I always get these emails from these people. Um, he just, I don't have the, I don't know. I can't, if I said something the other day, you know, I was sitting there listening. I was sitting there, I was listening to a sports radio, you know, cause I'm a deep thinker, right? And uh, this, this new guy got on sports radio out here in Los Angeles and you know, he does what most people do when they have nothing to say, which is they, they just start, they just go over the top arrogant.

Speaker 5:          43:56          You know what I mean? Like he was talking about how he wanted to get some, some sort of sports culture personality on the show, but he doubted he could get them as a guest because the guest hated him. And he goes, you know, cause I disagreed with them on some he, yeah, he was talking to a coach and he was actually disagreeing with the, with the fucking coach. He's disagreeing with the guy and he goes, you know what the problem is, you know, he goes, look, I'm, I'm just like such a good debater. I actually ended up like convincing myself of my own opinion. Yeah. She said that over the airwaves. And I just sort of muttered to myself that the confidence of morons is staggering. You know what I mean? Morons think they know everything. That's, that's what makes them fucking morons.

Speaker 5:          44:41          And like the emails I get with people who don't question the shit, um, which is, I dunno, like last week when I, when I went off on my little fucking rant there, just some of the fucking emails I get, it's like people are sending me Shit. That kinda is backing up what I'm saying. And then telling me that it sounded like I have tin foil on my fucking head, which obviously I am out of my fucking mind on some level, but, um, I'm not out of my mind when I don't trust corporations and I don't trust them when they say we're not going to do anything with this information. The other day I was in cvs and I go to buy something and the lady asked me, did I have a safe card? And I said, no. She said, do you want one? And I said, no.

Speaker 5:          45:23          And she goes, well, that's okay. I'll just, and she swiped the fucking thing anyways. And I was like, lady, what did I just say to you? Let's see if I use my credit card, they'd have my name and then to match up to that fucking number and what the hell I just bought. And just a little bit more information about me and my question to all you people who have this faith in these corporations, why does that person do that? Why are they so hell bent on trying to make that corporation less money in that moment?

Speaker 6:          45:57          Okay.

Speaker 5:          45:57          They give me this card. You know like everybody has those cards so you're not saving any fucking money. It's just, it's a big fucking shell game to make it seem, oh look, he's saving money. What they're really doing did they look at this hand over here is you're giving them all your personal fucking information that they can then use to to very least sell to other corporations to increase junk mail and it also to a limit you're fucking level of privacy. The fact that they can put all that shit up in the Goddamn Internet. People have been sending me these random websites where they have like your name and your address, where you fucking live and all this type of shit. It's like, how do you think that they get all that information?

Speaker 6:          46:43          Okay.

Speaker 5:          46:44          Do you think there's somebody sitting there with the phone book and just typing all of this shit in? I don't know. I have fuck it though.

Speaker 6:          46:53          Okay.

Speaker 5:          46:53          If some of us were, kills me. If some fucking random creepy guy, you know, you standing there waiting for the subway came up to you, asked you what's your name, your phone number and your address was, would you give it to them?

Speaker 6:          47:10          Yeah.

Speaker 5:          47:10          No, but for some reason you're inside of a fucking store and there's socks and sweaters and somebody has a name tag. Now all of a sudden you, you, you give him total fucking trust. You're writing your mind. So sir, don't cave in. All right. All you get, you just say that's unacceptable. That's unacceptable. I want to speak to the manager what they're doing. It's not legal yet. It's not legal yet, but I can guarantee you there's somebody lobbying for it that in Washington there's some sort of fucking high powered lobbying group. I swear to God is probably lobbying that from here on out. We need to have a law that if you're going to return a hat, you have to give us your name, your address, and your social security number just so there's not another nine 11 could guaran fucking tee it. So yeah, you don't have to.

Speaker 6:          48:06          Yeah.

Speaker 5:          48:07          That's actually one of the highlights of my day. What I do now is when they say, do you have our little savings save card? And I say, no, I don't. Would you like one? No, I don't. I then say, and please don't swipe another one.

Speaker 6:          48:20          You know,

Speaker 5:          48:22          and then I try to pay with cash. I love cash. Cash is fucking anonymous. All you guys out there who was sitting there watching these commercials where they make it look like credit cards is so fucking easy.

Speaker 6:          48:34          Okay,

Speaker 5:          48:34          you're, you're idiots. Get give, give, give, buying into exactly what they want you to buy into, which is a cashless society so they can keep track of where you are at all fucking times and every last fucking dime that you make so they can get their greedy little fucking hands on it. You're out of your mind and you're giving up an unbelievable amount of fucking privacy by creating a paper trail. Everywhere you go, everywhere you go, what you're doing, where you're at, you know, and the Sea of morons who we're going to sit there and go, Whoa, have you doing anything wrong? I mean, I guess maybe, maybe I'm a paranoid cycle. You look at all these fucking idiots who do reality TV's and [inaudible] and they let cameras come into their house and they don't seem to care about it. Maybe, uh, maybe the average Jacquez doesn't give a shit, but sir, for the love of God,

Speaker 6:          49:31          you know,

Speaker 5:          49:33          in the end he says, I'm not crying conspiracy. It's very plain to see what they're doing. It's not malicious or evil. Yes it is. It is malicious and it is evil and it is a conspiracy. They're conspiring to get everybody's information, find out what they buy, and they're lying to you saying that they're not going to share the information. It's everything that you're saying. It's not. It is. All right, and that's it. That's two weeks in a row. I'm on the soapbox. See people, don't you like it better when I talk about sports?

Speaker 1:          50:10          Wow.

Speaker 5:          50:20          The last thing I'll read you guys. This guy sent me something about a, you know I was talking about when you're going to go buy things and people ask for your phone and all

Speaker 2:          50:28          this fucking information and it fucking creeps me out. Every time they do that, I just think that they should play in the beginning of that iron main song, the prisoner. You remember that from the eighties do you remember how that thing went?

Speaker 7:          50:43          You remember this?

Speaker 2:          50:47          The new number two. What was number one? You are number six most cycle laugh ever.

Speaker 7:          51:03          Yeah.

Speaker 2:          51:05          Can you imagine if your fucking dad would laugh at you like that back in the day? Be like, son, how many beers did you have tonight? You just like, I just had to,

Speaker 2:          51:19          all right, and he just fucking Dallas and the light stock demand. It's going to be over. So anyways, this fucking guy. Does that make any sense, by the way? I don't know. I'm fucking sitting in with one microphone. No headphones in a fucking hotel room. This is what you get. All right. So this guy said, Bill, can you believe how much fucking information people are willing to give away for no to strangers for no reason. He goes, I got my hair cut the other day and the first thing they say to me before, hello, or what can I do for you is the first thing out of the gate is what's your phone number? So I say, why do you need my phone number? She says, so we know who you are when you come in. Which is bullshit because they don't know you when you come in.

Speaker 2:          51:59          They still have to ask what your God damn number is. C got to love someone who actually fucking uses their brain. So anyway, she goes, he says, I don't want to give you my number. So then she scoffs in his face and says, we don't send the information out to anyone. It's just to keep track of you here. That's it. Um, and then she says, uh, then okay, then the guy says, the guy written, wrote this really badly here. So then I guess he responds to, that doesn't make me feel any better. You don't need my phone number to cut my hair. Then this slag does this fine, whatever that sounded exactly like your exaggerated impression of a dumb broad. Then she goes, how about your address too? This is fucking, you know what all these corporations are sharing this information to figure out exactly what you buy when you buy it, what you liked the best.

Speaker 2:          52:51          So they can just fucking, I don't know what, you know, Jack, the prices of the shit up. So anyways, um, she goes, how about your address? And the guy goes, what are you going to do? Drop the hair, cut off at my house. Just cut my fucking, uh, now there's three people in line behind me in this worthless tub of come. Jesus leans around me and says, and says to I guess to the people behind them, sorry, this takes longer. When they, then he writes, they, you know, don't give any information. And then he sarcastically, oh,

Speaker 5:          53:26          I see. I'm the one compliment a complicating this transaction. And it's not even her fault, it's her. I'll, oh, and it's not even her fault. It's their corporate creep bosses. And all the fucking sheep that let people do whatever they want.

Speaker 1:          53:38          Okay.

Speaker 5:          53:39          Sorry. This is so long. Well, he should apologize to my listeners because they had to listen to me read it. Yeah, man, don't give those people your fucking phone numbers. Don't give him your address. I do that. Kim, can we get your phone number? I had. No, you can't. We're not going to do anything with it. I, that's fine. That's fine. I know you're not going to do anything with it. I don't want you to have my phone number. What are you gonna call me up and see how my fucking hair cuts going? Is it still short and you think you need an adjustment? Did I tell you that story? But when I went into cvs and that guy who, look what the peewee Herman Haircut, there was two, two foreigners in front of me. They barely spoke English and they, he asked if they wanted one of those savings saved cards and they said no.

Speaker 5:          54:17          And he goes, that's all right. I'll just scan one anyways. And he scans it. So I walk up and I'm ready for this guy. He goes, do you have our little savings save card? And I say, no I don't. And he goes, well, I'll just scan it anyways and I got no, I don't want you to do. And then he scanned it and I said, I said, excuse me, what did I just say to you? I just said, I don't want that. And you scanned it anyways. Why did you just do that? And he goes, it's all right. I'll let it scan it. I'll let us scan it. And I go, what? What do you get? Like half a cent for every person that you get, you know?

Speaker 1:          54:44          Yeah,

Speaker 5:          54:45          that, that, that you get on the fucking list there. And he goes, no I don't. And it's like, really? Is that why he can't make eye contact with me? You fucking piece of shit. He probably didn't even unscathed the God damn thing.

Speaker 5:          54:57          You know, I don't understand. People will help out corporations. I just don't, have they done anything to demonstrate that they give a flying fuck about you or the drinking water in your town? Don't help those cons. I mean you can if you want to, but that's, I would just, I think it would be a better world if these fucking pricks did know every God damn thing about you. Do you know pretty soon you're going to walk in there and they're going to fucking ask me if you can put, uh, did they can just bug you like gene Hackman in the conversation. Right. All right dude, I don't know what the fuck I'm talking about. You know what, I'm going to go down and listen to this lady singer songs so I don't have to think there's a nice little crowd down there. Has got to be at least 26 people down there, which I think in downtown San Jose actually constitutes a mob.

Speaker 5:          55:40          Maybe somebody will get tased and shot in the abdomen. I don't know what. All right, that's the podcast for this week. Thank you guys so much for listening. I am in currently revamping my website and I hope that everything's going to be up to speed. I recently went over, uh, 10,000 people on my mailing list, so I'm really excited about that. And, uh, if you want to know what's going on, you know, especially like if you see, you know, when I switched over to a Lipson with the podcast and all that fucking shit, if you were out of the loop, it's cause you weren't on my mailing list. I'm not sure. You know how funny is this? How funny is this? How fucking hypocritical of mine? I just said, don't give your phone number out to these cons. And now here I am asking for your web address. I really just, why do people listen to this and an idiot. All right,

Speaker 1:          56:24          I'll talk to you next week.

Speaker 4:          56:45          Yeah,

Speaker 3:          56:56          yeah.

Speaker 4:          57:05          Okay.
