Speaker 1:          00:00:01       Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:00:01       Hey, what's going on? It's bill burn. It's time for the Thursday afternoon. Just before Friday, Monday morning podcast and I am just checking in on you everybody. Um, Oh God, I don't know any other way to fucking say it. I'm just going to have a recording of it. Um, yeah, just checking on. You look at you guys. It's already Thursday. Thursday is over. Tomorrow's Friday. And then it's just a one way ticket to fuck town. What do you care? Quite as fucking weekend of the year right here. They'd be getting of the NFL season. College football is already in full fucking full gear for bold, full speed. I don't what the fuck you say. I watched another a college game the other night. I watched the horn and 80 Ohio state buckeyes going to be Schwab at shut. Pank what? The Virginia. Who gives a fuck? Who Was it? The Virginia Cavaliers. The volunteers. I don't know what they are, but they had some very nice helmets.

Speaker 2:          00:01:02       They did actually had some really nice helmets and they hung in there with the buckeyes for about two and a half quarters. And all of a sudden Ohio state was just like, yeah, we've had about enough of you guys. Buckeyes look great. And you know, it's funny. As much as I was singing hail to the victors, I actually sit there and I watched. I go, God damn it. I love the Buckeyes, always liked the uniform. And uh, I've always liked Michigan is I can't help it. I'm from Boston outside of Boston, Massachusetts. It's not a college town, it's a college Savile. We don't have any good college sports. Christ, we had Doug Flutie for like fucking four years. That's all we had. You know, we do well in college hockey. Other than that, the whole fucking thing fell apart a couple of times. Umass did okay.

Speaker 2:          00:01:40       You know, BC did all right. We got to the sweet 16 and the Big Dad, we got nothing. We got nothing. All we have is on a professional level. We just want all the fucking championships. That's all that we have to hang our hats on. So anyway, so I, as I mentioned, I I like a lot of teams that are our rivals of each other just because, uh, you know, I've just watched him throughout the years because they've always been good and who doesn't want to watch quality football over there? So anyways, tonight the NFL season starts, uh, du Du, Du, Du, Du.

Speaker 1:          00:02:18       Ooh,

Speaker 2:          00:02:23       right? And I'll tell you, it's a goddamn shame that the two teams tonight have collectively one 10 super bowl championships and they're going to fucking deal with the all that Jim, Jim Hearsay. How did I not fucking come up with that until now? Jim and hearsay out and fucking all of his can't fucking prove it. But we definitely probably think that may be new shop too. Unbelievable for fucking games and draft picks. It's unreal. That's what happens when you're top everybody, all you guys out there are you fat. Fuck winging it and fucking jerk offs. You know what you are. You guys are all just jelly. The same shit you put on your fucking donuts. That's what you got going on with the Patriots. Fuck all of you. I can't hear any of you. I'm done with it. Dealt with a custody. I got into it with this, uh, with a good friend of mine who was a Pittsburgh Fan and he explained a way. Terry Bradshaw's, we use steroids comment, but was convinced [inaudible] cell phone. You know, why did he destroy his cell phone? Why didn't Terry Bradshaw's say you use steroids, Carrie?

Speaker 2:          00:03:43       I love sports fans. Absolutely love them. They can not see anything wrong that their own fucking team did. And I'm going to pause now as a way for you guys go. Well, what about you bill a, we cheated in 2007 for one game, for one game. We cheated. That was a brand new rule. We ignored it. A fucking man genie fucking site. He called us on it and we were 100% guilty of cheating one fucking time. It was a brand new role. So all you dump concert go well, what about three to five years early when you went to know Superbowls? Well, it wasn't illegal to do that. You dumb fuck.

Speaker 2:          00:04:21       By the way, if you ever go to a game, if you ever go to a game, watch the guys sending in the signals. And when I say guys, it's plural. There's always like three or four people fucking sending signals because they don't want you to figure it out who? Because everybody does it now. Whatever. Suck a dick. Um, so we're coming out tonight and I'm hoping that we're going to ask rape the fucking Steelers and the rest of the League and win another championship this year. Cause I would just love to hear what Jim Hearsay's going to say or some other fucking team. Um, start some rumor that ESPN then picks up without even researching and then apologizes at two in the fucking morning. Those spineless cunts. Um, but anyways, who gives a fuck about all that? It's football season. The dog days of baseball are behind us.

Speaker 2:          00:05:10       Baseball's gonna matter. Football always matters. Basketball and baseball and hockey or right around the fucking corner. This is one of those, one of the great months of the year, you know, when the great months a year. And you know what, there's no bunny rabbit. There's no fat guy coming down the fucking thing, right? Jesus didn't do anything this month. Jesus didn't do shit. And September's whole 33 fucking years, never did a goddamn thing that I have to pay attention to. Pay attention to. All you got is like those 19 Jewish holidays of which, you know, people who aren't even Jewish get like eight of those days off. So God bless the Jewish people, the Jews over the air here in September. Um, it's a great fucking month. Hey, you know, the last time I talked to you guys, I mentioned that I was uh, using big green egg to finally go and try and attempt to smoke something.

Speaker 2:          00:06:02       And I don't think I've ever been so excited in my life when I got that, that fire going on at Hickory, wished I was smoking and all of that stuff. But, uh, unfortunately my fire ended up going out about, um, about two hours into it. So my question to other people who smoke with the egg, how do you layer your fire? Cause like I obviously need more charcoal but I can't have the temperature go higher than a certain, um, you know, I want to keep it around like 200, 180 to two 20. I just put it right at 200 cause everybody was saying I do it at two 20. I do a one 80. I do two 10. I said fuck it. Split the difference. I have it at 200. So how do you build that fire where it's not going to go out in two hours, but it's not hotter than like 200 degrees to I like I just don't know how to do that yet.

Speaker 2:          00:07:00       And it's, it's a lot easier with the smoker because I would think that, you know, you just keep adding to it. Although with the smoker, I heard you start with charcoal and then the wood starts burning and then he keep it at that. Well maybe just add more wood. I don't know. I'm a complete novice. So what happened was when I took, um, you know, when I took the ribs off after like three hours, um, and everybody's all three hours. I do it five hours, I do it 19 hours. I do it for an hour and a half. Everybody's got a different, no fucking idea how to do this shit. So three hours, I take it off cause my fire was dying all the way down and it took them out and had this, it looked like they'd been smoked. So it was already really excited about that. And then, you know, I ate one of the small ones and it seemed to be done and then I cut to the next one and it looked like a burger that was medium rare.

Speaker 2:          00:07:52       So like a fucking asshole. I was so hungry. I said to hell with that. And I bit into it and I chewed three times and I'm like, Bill, what the fuck are you doing? You're eating an under cooked pig, are you out of your mind? So I spit it out on the plate and then I just took all of the ribs and uh, I put them in like casserole dish. I put some water in there and a, I just baked them in the oven to finish them. And they were delicious. They definitely had a smoky flavor, but, uh, I wanted to finish the whole thing on the egg. So if anybody has the big green egg and you know how to do it, how I maintain a, a fire, you know, when they talk about, you know, if someday I do a brisket or pork butt or something like that, how do I maintain that temperature and that fire for that long?

Speaker 2:          00:08:36       Do you have a system? Make me a video for the love of Christ. Um, but anyways, um, so it didn't quite work out, but I knew that that was going to happen anyways. I knew I was going to fuck it up the first time through. Um, but other than that, everything else was working. And I'll also, do you guys prefer the, the hickory chunks or having those little chips that you soak? That was another thing because I felt like the hickory chunks just really just, just burned right the fuck up. When I opened it, it was nothing but ashes. So, uh, I dunno, I got a lot of questions, but I ain't going to quit. I'm just going to keep going with it. So anyways, another thing in sports that I forgot to mention is the u s open. Alright. And Serena Williams is trying to become, let's see, actually look this up. She's trying to become the one,

Speaker 3:          00:09:32       okay.

Speaker 2:          00:09:32       Two, three fourth tennis player all time to have a season slam, which is winning all in the same calendar year. The Australian Open, the French Open, Wimbledon and the u s open.

Speaker 3:          00:09:47       MMM.

Speaker 2:          00:09:49       I mean there's a shortlist of people that through their career have won all four. But um, there's only four people. Three people. I'm sorry that I've ever done it. Uh, Margaret Court did it in 1970. This is so not the Monday morning podcast. I actually have information here. Steffi Graf did it in 1988 and rod fucking away did it twice, 1962 and 1969 and that is why a lot of people still consider him arguably the greatest tennis male tennis player, I should say, of all time.

Speaker 3:          00:10:30       MMM.

Speaker 2:          00:10:32       He won 11 overall end. He had a, he had a career and seat career slam. Obviously he had this season's slam twice. Nobody's ever done it twice. Um, so I actually started looking up, cause I'm like a fucking numbers nerd when it comes to sports. So as far as the top ladies, and granted, I couldn't find a fucking website that just listed all of them. So I just went on Wikipedia and just started going through all the top, uh, women that I could remember that I watched and all that shit. So here, here's the top women's tennis champions of all time. As far as I, my Wikipedia research, Margaret Margaret fucking caught over there. She's one the most. She won 24. Uh, she won them, uh, before the open era, which I believe started in [inaudible] 67 or 68. I don't even know what the fuck that, I forget what that means.

Speaker 2:          00:11:25       The Open era. What does that mean? After the summer of love, people started whoring it up there. Uh, sorry. Let me see what I got here. Close. Close this window. Open era tennis. All right, what the fuck does this mean? The Open era Wikipedia. This is where I get all my information. The period since 1968 where can compete in a grand slam and grand slams. Oh, so it wasn't professionals. Well, that kind of takes a little luster off of fucking rod laver for me. We're not in 69, though, but he also done, I it doesn't because you know what, he did it in 1969 he did it when there weren't professionals. And when there were, uh, the open era began in 1968 when the Grand Slam tournaments agreed to allow professional players to compete with amateurs before 1968 only amateurs who are allowed to compete in the Grand Slam tournaments and other events organized or sanctions by the I l t f including the Davis Cup. Uh, the move is made because the English are tired of the hypocrisy in the sport. Uh, well that probably means like, you know, like back in the day when, uh, the US Olympic team was all amateurs and so was so was the Russian team, but they didn't have any professional fucking sports. So we were playing against their Gretzky's with like a r a w. What's that guy's name? Six kills six killer was that Oregon quarterback

Speaker 2:          00:13:00       or Washington quarterback from way back in the day, one of the great names ever. Six killer, right? 76 killer. I swear to God, that's an actual name of a quarterback that I learnt. Sunny fucking six. Kyla is a former American football player in sports commentator. That is the greatest sunny six killer. Who the fuck would want that guy? He's a quarterback

Speaker 2:          00:13:32       born in Oklahoma and is a member of the Cherokee nation. Jesus Christ. If that guy came around today, it would be marketing gold. Hi. Hey. Sat a six candidates taking enough failed. Actually Keith Jackson was, was uh, was around back there. Sonny six killer that, I mean, Quintin Tarantino couldn't come up with a better fucking name than that. All right, let's continue here. So Margaret Court one 24, um, mostly during pre open era in through the last few, uh, after the opener. Steffi Graf, 22, a lot of people put her above Margaret Court because all of hers were during the Open era when it was all professionals. Serena, Steffi Graf one 22. So Margaret Court 24. Steffi Graf 20 to Serena Williams 21. Um, she wins obviously the u s open. That'll be 22 when she will become the fourth woman woman of all time. And the fifth person collectively ever to have a seasoned slam. Um, Martina Navratilova, uh, 18 Chris Everett 18, Billie Jean King 12. Um, and then on the men's side, Roger Federer has one 17 Pete San Fran and has, uh, uh, uh, uh, career slam.

Speaker 3:          00:14:54       Uh,

Speaker 2:          00:14:55       all those women that I just mentioned, they all have the career slam. Pete San Francis one 14, but he never wanted the French. Rafi l made. Dell has one 14, but he never went Australia. But Raphael Nadal has the record since the open era of winning the most, a single grand slam event he won than anybody else. Uh, he won the French Open. He wanted nine times in 10 years, four years in a row, Mr Year when federal one and 2009. Then he ran it for another five. Um, Rod Laver has 11. Bjorn Borg has 11 never won the u s so the Australian Open, Andre Agassi has eight, has the career slam. Avant Lendl has eight. Never won Wimbledon. Mcenroe has seven. Never one Roland Garros or uh, the French or Australian Boris Becker six. Then I had to look up Stan Smith, you know, he's got that sneaker like Jordan that they never retired. I'm like, I got to see what this guy did. Stan Smith one too.

Speaker 3:          00:15:56       Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:15:56       He never won the Australian or the U Open this mother Fucker, man. How the hell did you get a sneaker? Let's see when he won it. Now that I know what the open Arrow means. Stan Smith. Yeah. He wanted the open air and he went 72 we won Wimbledon and the US Open. He wanted 71 I know, I sound like the fucking rain man, but I, I get into this type of shit.

Speaker 3:          00:16:17       MMM.

Speaker 2:          00:16:19       So anyways, let's go, let's get back to the podcast here. So I'm looking forward to it. You know, if you don't watch tennis but you want to pop in when you can see something that net that rarely ever happens. You got to watch Serena Williams this weekend. You don't have to, but she can.

Speaker 3:          00:16:33       MMM.

Speaker 2:          00:16:35       All right, let's plow ahead here. Uh Oh. Let's talk about fucking working out old Billy fat tits.

Speaker 3:          00:16:42       Huh?

Speaker 2:          00:16:44       Oh Billy fucking baby bump. I'm back on it, man. I went on a hike the other day and I worked out did all of that shit. I woke up in the morning, but I do buy dope and I weighed myself before working out, which I've now learned is your most accurate weight of the day. And I was one 65.8 so that means I am in striking distance of getting down to my bucks. 62 I'm going to, I might have to fucking skip a rope. Yeah, skip a rope, skip rope for a couple of rounds to get down to it. But uh, I think I can do it. And then I start back out on the road. I'm going back east, I'm going to a wedding and a then I do my run through Texas. So, uh, this is going to be the tough thing. And also my, uh, my boos fast is going to end at some point over the next week. I am up to a, what's today? Thursday? Sunday was 63, 64, 65, 66, 67 days. And I wanted to go like 70, 72 days. So I've got like five more days.

Speaker 3:          00:17:46       MMM.

Speaker 2:          00:17:48       But I got to tell you tonight, I might

Speaker 1:          00:17:50       actually fuck it up tonight all depending on what happens. Actually. Got a great gig tonight, um, through a friend of a friend of a friend. Somehow I am. Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:18:00       I am going to, I'll tell you later who I'm open at for. I'll tell you the next time, cause I don't know if it's a secret fucking Gig, but um,

Speaker 2:          00:18:10       I'm opening for uh, a bunch of um, oh, a bunch of young lads that like to go to the library and uh, they might want to go to the library tonight and who am I to say no, at least got to read one book with them, right? Anyways, so all I gotta do is, uh, just eat right. Do a little bit of cardio. I think I can get down there and um, but what I'm really finding is all I'm going to do is lose a little more muscle and I'm still going to have this fucking God damn baby bump. I can't get rid of the fucking thing. However, however I actually have started the transformation of my garage not being a place to dump shit off at. I am now going, it's, it's making is trans transformation. All right. I had three cabinets sitting on the floor, pieces of absolute fucking shit cabinets, but they still work.

Speaker 2:          00:19:06       So I had somebody come over, he fucking, you know, did the whole stud finder thing. I wasn't going to do it because I'm putting my tools in there and a bunch of shit from my big green egg. It's going to be heavy. And I don't need to pull out a bunch of dry wall cause I fucking miss the stud. I don't give a fuck. I'm a comedian. I understand it. I don't want somebody who's in construction to tell me jokes and I don't want to be fucking hanging cabinets. All right, question my manhood. I don't give a fuck. So this dude, he put up the, um, he put up the cabinets, had a ladder, hung up, and I had bolt bicycles hung up and a, I came downstairs with an apron and you know, gave him some muffins. They good little housewife and a, so that's the beginning of it.

Speaker 2:          00:19:51       And then I'm going to, on craigslist, I'm going to get rid of my pull up and dip station, then I, that I bought and I'm going to, uh, get a pull up bar that mounts to the wall. And then I'm going to go to that, those atomic grips website and a, I'm getting all those, those fucking, uh, those little cannon ball things, whatever you call them, the fucking missiles and all those things, all those different grip things. And I'm going to get, and um, I'm going to have my own little, uh, American Ninja fuck an obstacle course hanging from the ceiling of my, uh, my garage. And that's going to be my workout. And I figure if I do that throughout the years, skip a little rope, take my dog for a hike. And as long as I don't eat like a cunt, I think I should be all right.

Speaker 2:          00:20:37       You know, cause I fucking hate going to the gym even though I like going to the gym. You know, what was the last time you went to the gym and you wanted to go and use the bench press? And there wasn't fucking 12 people waiting for it, right? Or even worse, even worse, the fucking chick who's there, who's not even bench pressing and is using it to sit on the end of it. It fucking, uh, uh, Jesus. Hang on a second. Let me, let me call you right back. I'm finishing up my up, my podcast. All right, no problem. All right. Um, the chick that's sitting on the end of the bench to do some fucking ab work or do some like, you know, those, those tricep exercises and you got what you want to be like, hey, why didn't you go over to the the mat area and do that?

Speaker 2:          00:21:22       But you can't do that because if you ever, you could say that to a guy, but if you say it's a woman than your acts sexist work, you wait your turn, you fucking pig. Um, so you, you want to avoid that, right? So, um, and what I like about the way I'm going to do my garage is everything's, everything that I'm working out with is hanging up on the wall or hanging from the ceiling. Do you know a long time ago I bought the rings, you know, this gymnastic rings when I had a one bedroom apartment, which is fucking hilarious. I Dunno where I thought it was going to hang on for me. That was going to hanging from my chin up bar and uh, and it just, nothing worked. It was just too, it was too, I was too low to the ground. And, uh, also I put up the chin up bar so I never truly trusted that that thing wasn't going to give way.

Speaker 2:          00:22:09       And I had, I had to have my legs bent when I used them, so I was like, I'm either going to fucking land on my knee caps or I'm going to land on my tailbone and either way it's going to suck. So, uh, I'm going to get though, I'm just going to have these hook things up there so I could just, you know, put shit up and take stuff down and uh, she could tell him I'm fucking beyond excited about it and I can take my useless termite infested fucking hunk of shit. Cock sucking mother fucking garage. Yeah. That's shaped like an ice cream cone that was made out of wax and was stuffed in an oven for 20 minutes and then pulled out not 20 minutes, whatever it first starts to melt. Um, even the, uh, the guy, the construction dude who was helping me put that up with saying that the, the garage itself was an optical illusion as far as like, I was telling him like he saw on the wall, thank God it's just shitty drywall.

Speaker 2:          00:23:04       Like I've scraped, you know, my bumper's hit the side of it a couple of times cause it's, it's coming in, I'm looking onto the left because that's like cinder blocks and concrete. So I mean this thing was built for a model t Ford. I'm getting a 68, uh, f 100 in there, so it gets a little tight, you know, hey, it gets a little rough, you know, so I'm, I'm paying attention to the fucking concrete. And uh, on the other side it comes in at like a 15 degree angle and then all of a sudden it just increases to like 18 or 19 degrees and the wall is all white. See just, you can't even fucking see it. And, uh, you know, it's a truck. Nothing happens to the truck. It just puts a hack mark in the fucking wall. And a, I'm actually tempted to talk to my neighbor and be like, dude, how much would it cost for me to buy one foot your way?

Speaker 2:          00:23:55       The length of my garage? Can I buy that property off of you and build a garage that's fucking square? Can you do that for me? I wonder what he would say. He probably said, well, you know what? Go Fuck Yourself. And I'd be like, you know what? That's probably exactly what I would say. Why do I give a fuck about your garage and your problem? I don't give a shit. Um, so anyways, uh, last night I worked out some material. Jesus Christ was, I fucking just rusty last night was a lot of work. It's all I can say. Oh, by the way. So the big college game that I'm going to this year is, uh, well I'm going to one, I'm going to Texas and Osu and because I'm getting ready for that Madison Square Garden show. Um, I'm doing another big tour in October and that one starts off, we're going to go to a Notre Dame USC, and that is the entire Rosebowl Kuru Kuru crew is going to that game.

Speaker 2:          00:24:56       Bart, nick lie ahead and myself and, um, that's how we start to tore off. We just got some nosebleed seats up at the top of the stadium. So if you're going to the game, look for the, uh, me and five other people that come stumbling in, um, to watch that game. I'm actually not going to get too ripped for that famous last words, but, uh, I think, you know, I want to watch that game because I think Notre Dame and is going to be really good this year. I don't know about USC. I know that they won, but I don't know that they've played yet. Um, but it's, you know, like I said, I hope Michigan gets good. It's good to see Notre Dame good again. Uh, you know, it's good for college football even though, you know, it's like I said, it was a red sox fan.

Speaker 2:          00:25:37       It's good when the fucking red sox and Yankees are good. Um, speaking of which, we suck that Dick this year.

Speaker 5:          00:29:01       okay,

Speaker 2:          00:29:01       let's try and wrap this up. What the fuck was I just going to tell you guys about something dumb that I did?

Speaker 5:          00:29:06       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:29:07       Something dumb that I didn't know what happened right before this, uh, my doorbell rang and the guy came over with the samples of the different stayed because my front gate is about ready to fall down as are the driveway gates. Uh, cause they're, you know, absolute piece of shit, cock suck and motherfucking gates. You know, not to be confused with my cock sucking mother fucking piece of shit garage or the cock sucking mother fucking conti plumbing in, in, in cloth wiring in the walls. But slowly but surely, you know, we're getting this thing together fucking unreal. Ah, whenever I think about this house, how long it's been around in all that, I just think of like, remember that game, the wonderful though. Wander ball goes round and round. Bapapapapa you are bound to Turo too when you are last and you are out o u t out. That's what it feels like. Everybody just kept passing the buck and by the time I got it, the fucking shit hit the fan. But um, I take some perverse pleasure in being the one that fixes up this fucking house. You don't just to know whoever I sell this to isn't going to, you know, isn't going to inherit a bunch of fucking problems.

Speaker 5:          00:30:23       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:30:23       Do you know they went up on the roof and they told me, once again, we're having an El Nino when these guys fucking put the drains too high. It's just a never ending. This would be the third time I have to get my fucking roof fixed. And I know what you guys are thinking. Well Bill, why don't you just sue somebody? I'll tell you why. Cause I don't want to go to court. I don't want to fucking sit there and have those guys string it out for three years. This was is, it continues to rain down into my fucking living room, whatever. I picked a couple of dopes. I'm all for two. I think I finally found somebody fucking reputable and they'll do the thing right. I don't even want to talk about it. So anyways, um, my, uh, prediction tonight is it's got to be a tough game as always.

Speaker 2:          00:31:04       Uh, I have no idea what the Patriots are going to be like. As always, whenever you win a championship, a bunch of people jump ship. And, um, I definitely think not having Reavis is really going to affect us. Um, Rothfuss burgers to time winning champions, Superbowl champion. And I think a Steelers always have a good defense. Who the fuck knows? Man? It's the first God damn week. But I got to tell you, I'm, I'm really excited that I'm celebrating how long Spanish fantasy football been around. I love that. I still don't play that shit. I got a, I got asked to join another league, you know what I mean? Uh, this year and I just wrote, I don't play pan is fantasy football. You guys are all a bunch of pussies and I didn't write pussies, if you know what I mean. And then the dude just wrote back, he wrote, Lol, I really wish I could argue that. Um, Oh, speaking of which, you know what Rappaport he's fucking told me about this thing that he did. Um,

Speaker 5:          00:32:04       okay.

Speaker 2:          00:32:05       I got to find it meant, uh, did anybody listened to Michael Rappaport when he was on the Howard Stern show?

Speaker 5:          00:32:10       Yeah,

Speaker 2:          00:32:11       when he played fantasy football against the fantasy football guy and he won, he had his son pick out the fucking teams and evidently he was shit talking and this guy wasn't good at shit-talking any, absolutely buried him on the fucking Howard stern show. I'm trying to find the clip. If anybody has the clip, please send it to me and then I will retweet it. Um, I'll retweet it. Uh, you know, on the podcasts Twitter account and by saying I've been trying to do it, my fucking died. I got a new hard drive put into an it shit the bed. So, uh, I just said fuck it. And I went out and I bought like an $800 laptop, laptop. Fucking, I'm done buying expensive ones, not like 800 bucks. That's, that's, you know, that's cheap for a fucking laptop. So, uh, I'm not, and this is a great thing about this one, this laptop, I'm not putting any information on it. I'm not putting any of my fucking music on it. I'm not putting anything on it. So when it inevitably shits the bed, you know, did you save it to the iCloud? Fuck the ICLOUD. Fuck the ICLOUD and fuck Disneyland and Fuck Disney world. I read up on that Shit, dude. That is so God damn creepy how they're, they're going to going to microchip you when you go in and out of that park the entire fucking time.

Speaker 2:          00:33:26       And the only way to fight it is to just not go because you can't have an intelligent conversation with most people because most people are morons. Most people be like, why do I give a fuck if they know where I bought a fucking slurpee? I don't give a shit as long as it's up on space mountain, right. They don't give a shit. And it's so perfect because eventually when the government microchips, everybody, one of the arguments is going to be like, well, you, they microchip you when you go to Disneyland. Do you think that Mickey mouse is evil? Dude, I was reading this thing where they literally, you're going to go in there and the people dressed up as the characters are just going to come up to you and be like, hey bill, how's it going? I'm sorry.

Speaker 2:          00:34:06       I almost said it's Pluto. That's when you know you're doing a bad impression. We have to say who the fuck it is. Hello? Low. This is Arnold Schwarzenegger. Um, like those characters are going to come walking up and saying hello to you. All right. So if you're walking in there with that wristband that is tracking you from a fucking satellite in outer space and Pluto comes up to you and knows your name before you introduce yourself, and in the meantime in the background is singing. It's a small world. After all, if the, the, that Trifecta of Shit doesn't creep you out, then uh, I think you're a robot. Either that or you deserve whatever happens to you, what you're in there. You know what I mean? Those fucking creeps over a Disney. What do they not going to be crepes. Arthur Ashe award. The Caitlyn Jenner. So you get the fucking exclusive interview with Diane Sawyer.

Speaker 5:          00:35:01       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:35:01       Ah, shameless. Absolutely fucking shameless. All alleged. But I feel after that whole deflate gate thing, it doesn't matter. All you gotta do is you just say shit and then it becomes true. All right everybody, that's the Thursday afternoon podcast. Uh, hope you guys have a great weekend. [inaudible] and joy, some throwback Monday morning podcast stuff. And I'm hoping for a great game. Obviously hoping the Patriots win tonight and um, but I got no beef with the fucking Steelers or anything that they've ever done, including what Terry said. I don't give a shit. Congratulations. You've won six Superbowls as far as I'm all right. Go fuck yourself and a Seattle. I hope you made you stadium even louder. God knows your lame ass fans need all the help they can get.

Speaker 2:          00:35:47       Come on, man. I had to start shit with somebody. Um, I actually think Seattle is probably going to be good this year. Oh. Oh. Pete Carroll. Oh, Pete Carroll. There's another, there's an upstanding individual bill Bella checks a piece of shit. But I'll tell you that Pete Carroll. Oh pistol Pete. You know what the genius of Pistol Pete sees his filthy as anybody, but he dresses like Flanders on the Simpsons. That's what Bella check should be doing. Oh, hoodies. Just evil people don't trust you, but you put on a pair of dockers, you know what I mean? Keep you stomach down

Speaker 6:          00:36:17       and go woo.

Speaker 2:          00:36:18       After every fucked up play. God dammit. People will love you. All right, go fuck yourselves. Uh, I have a great weekend and enjoy the throwback

Speaker 7:          00:36:28       Monday morning podcast. Wait the car with us.

Speaker 2:          00:37:02       Oh two eight. Bill, maybe you can help me out with this thing.

Speaker 6:          00:37:06       I haven't read any of these things people. So, uh, bear with me here. Uh, this sounds ridiculous, but hear me out. I met this girl a couple of weeks ago and I've been talking to her and hanging out with her nonstop. We is pretty what? I guess it's, she is pretty, she's pretty funny, intelligent and one of the most upfront and upfront and honest people I've ever met in my life. In fact, maybe a little too honest, cause she tells me every day how great, cute, honest and honest I am. And it's a little much sometimes. Anyways, we've been hitting it off like crazy and on Saturday she spent the night and we hung out all day Sunday about nine around 9:00 PM we got on the topic of old jobs. Uh, fuck is she a dancer? And she told me that a few years ago she worked in a pet store. Okay. I guess wrong. There was a hamster there that would bite her everyday drawing blood and what? Attack coworkers and customers generally the hamster was a crazy douche. One day her, her and a coworker decided they had to do something about this thing to put the hamster in a bag and smashed it against the wall. Whoa.

Speaker 6:          00:38:21       What? Jesus Christ. What a fucking left turn that was. They put it in a bag

Speaker 2:          00:38:31       and smashed it against the wall.

Speaker 6:          00:38:35       Needless to say,

Speaker 2:          00:38:36       I was shocked. The first thing I said was, Holy Shit Lady. That's kind of crazy. That makes

Speaker 2:          00:38:48       wait. That's the kind of crazy that makes a wife cut her husband's Dick off. I'm sorry dude. That was a hilarious line and I blew it. The first thing I said was, Holy Shit Lady. That's the kind of crazy that makes it wife cut her husband's Dick off. She said she still feels horrible about it and that she killed it that way because she couldn't think of any other way to make it quick. But Jeez, I mean, I never been in that situation, but that seems kind of crazy. Lol. This seems like something straight out of a Seinfeld episode, but I just keep thinking about it. Every time me and this chick's are, are getting together, should I just accept this is a crazy story or is this a sign that she has serious issues? Remember, this happened years ago and she seems absolutely sane. Otherwise, please help potential murder victim question mark through. Some of you guys are really fucking funny, man. The way you guys write this shit. I, I you, but you got to admit I haven't proved with my reading. I feel so bad that I butchered that God damn line. Um,

Speaker 1:          00:39:56       okay.

Speaker 2:          00:39:57       Okay. Jesus Christ. What do you do with this one? This is fucked up on so many different levels. Okay, let's start with the first thing. The cruelty to animals. Okay. Not only cruelty to animals like I could what she did, I could do that to an aunt. I won't even do it to a spider. I could do it to a fucking mosquito. That's what she basically treated a hamster like a fucking mosquito. Now granted a hamster. Okay, let's try to be a little empathetic here. Empathetic. Let me try to put myself in her situation. If I was younger, 20 years younger and a hamster bit me every day at work and I met working at a fucking pet store, uh, what? I smashed it against the wall and a bag. No, I wouldn't. However, I would do something to it. I would do something. Do you know what I would do? I would take a ruler.

Speaker 2:          00:41:06       I would wait. I would wait till it was a fallen asleep and I would just write on it's fucking hamster ass and it woke up. Fuck it did. I would just take the ruler and I would pin it against the fucking cage. It just watch you get all upset. I just, I would bully it. That's what basically what I would do. Hey, you liked that. You liked that? Your little fucking Hamster, Huh? I wouldn't hurt it. I just keep it pinned. I was frustrated. I would frustrate the living shit out of it. That's what I would do. I would do something like that. I that I think I would do that, but I would not smash it against the fucking wall. They put it in a bat. Now did, was it repeated strikes?

Speaker 2:          00:41:50       Jesus Christ, you know some of this shit kids used to do in my neighborhood. Do you know I had a friend of mine, he's take his house cat and he put in an empty Pellis pillowcase and he would fucking spin it over his head like someone like it was at a Steelers game, you know, that's what the fuck you would do. And then sometimes he'd put it in the dryer. They used to tell me these stories and I used to laugh my fucking ass off for some reason. I found it funny back then. Now I find it absolutely horrific and uh, I would never do it, but if I had to do it either or a dog or a cat, I would definitely do it to a cat. But it have to be a real douche of a cat. All right, so we're getting off the subject here.

Speaker 2:          00:42:37       So it's cruelty to animals and she works at a pet store. So that's bizarre because he figured if you work at a pet store, that means you either you love animals or use you. Like I had a low level deal pot. You, you, you're dealing weed on a low level. You know what I mean? You're that guy. You like the burnout, Matthew mcconaughey. At least that's how they used to be. But then there's the other option that serial killers, you know, they start off with small animals. You know, they watch a ton of porn and they start torturing small animals and then they gradually work their way up, uh, you know, to a fucking human being. So yeah, you could possibly, you could possibly be dealing with that right now. Then also, you know, you're looking at it like this is, that's the mother. Your children put a hamster in a fucking, I could see if it was fucking 1911 rather than 2011 people back then. They kill an animal. They didn't give a fuck.

Speaker 2:          00:43:41       They just walk out. What do you guys want for dinner? Yeah, yeah. It's, has some goose in the fucking mom would walk out. They grabbed the goose by the neck and then they'd fucking act like they were trying to start up a model t and they'd go, ah, fucking body. Then they would just break its neck nice and quick. Um, and then they'd pluck it, Nick Cook it and that was it. And that was, that was dinner 1911. Do you like that little piece? A piece of history? Uh, attitude. I don't know what to tell you. This is like, um, that's really fucking insane and at the very least if you get into a fight with her eye, she's at the very least, I think she's going to throw something at you. She might be one of those. I have no idea. Dude. How hard is this girl? I think some of these people I need like a picture to see if it's like worth it. You guys seem to be connecting on like a personality level, but I really got to tell you,

Speaker 3:          00:44:41       you know,

Speaker 2:          00:44:43       that's just like something Roger Clemens would do. I could picture him doing that. You know, he is that pose posey from the fucking dirty dozen sort of vibe.

Speaker 4:          00:45:06       Yes.

Speaker 2:          00:45:26       All right, here we go. All right, Bill. One of my best friends has been going to church for years and previously it has never bothered me at all. Well, Gigi, I grew up, I grew up Catholic and like so many Catholics I got raped. No kidding. I no longer, I no longer attend church, but it doesn't bother me in the least. If someone else wants to go, this guy is the exact mindset than I am except by make fun of people who go to church a little bit, little bit. A few months ago, my friends started asking me if I would like to go to church with him gay. Uh, I plight. I politely declared that's, that's a gay thing to do and I don't mean, I don't mean nick. How is it gay to ask someone to go to church with you because you're both going to be wearing sweaters. You're going to be singing songs. You are

Speaker 6:          00:46:18       oh, lay Lou. Yah.

Speaker 2:          00:46:25       You'll just sit there and sing with it. You have fucking friend wearing a sweater and then, then the priest up there, God knows what he did.

Speaker 6:          00:46:32       It's going to be like he had a beard and some long hair. Really? He cared. A leper. Not of you guys can do that. So you better give us some money.

Speaker 2:          00:46:46       Yeah. Who are not making fun of mass right now. It's great to you. It's nothing. Yes. Granted, there are some things that are not, none of that horse shit that overly boodley hopefully bullied to him. Well, it's like a call and response. I'll tell you what, I'll tell you what's fucking sacred. Meaning the rest of question. Now you're getting the answer. Touch. I'll tell you what's sacred. What's sacred is how you go out in the playoffs. The Celtics went out with heart. We still lost the fucking, we still got our ass. We still got arrested. We still got our asses kicked. All right? But there was no quit in that team. All right? Okay. That's fucking sacred. What? Sac religious is what the fucking Lakers Dick. And I'm like disrespect in the, I'm saying what? The couple of those and it wasn't all of them. What? Uh, it was really what buying him did. I didn't think but Odom did was bad. Can you just finish reading Jesus Christ? Really? All of a sudden you're dictating it. You asked me why. So he wants to go to church with me. With him. I repeat gay. I politely decline. Dude, I'm not doing that shit.

Speaker 2:          00:47:50       You're all commentary. That's not a part of the letter because you're presenting it and then a biased fashion. This, read it and then give your opinion. You see this shit. This is a classic fucking broad. It's like I've been doing this shit for four years and you're telling me how to run it yet you have no idea how many more on guys are going to send him hate mail because of that, because not because you're a jerk, because some other, well, they're morons. Fucking elitist attitude. Um, since then my friend has told me he feels it's his mission to spread the word of God. Stop saying it like that and continues to ask me to go. They got, he drank the fucking cool light. Now he's a Zombie and as time pass is, he's getting more aggressive with his sales pitch. That means he's probably reaching out and touching his hand. Uh, what started off with him just slipping it into casual conversation is loud now led me to receiving text messages that say the following, this means more to you. This means more to me than you know. God has poured out love to me and he is reaching out to you also ignore a few months, but there is a lot at stake here. Wow. Yeah, no, he has a little ones. He's buying into that. Jesus is coming back and this time he's not fucking around.

Speaker 2:          00:49:20       It's personnel. Yeah. Okay, so he's buying into the rapture. This hippie is going to come back on a stegosaurus and just start killing people, killing people. What they say, what they say is fucking wrong. He's going to come back wrath. One of the deadly sins, Judge's judgment is mine set at the Lord. He's the son. He's the Donald Trump. He's got the fuck he's got to call him over at this point, coming out of heaven. He didn't make that money. He didn't make the fucking world. He's just this loud jackass a fucking fuck. You know, whatever. Cast me into the fucking pits. I don't give a shit. You know, you think I want to hang out with you in heaven forever. Just go it. Isn't this awesome? It is awesome. Can you please finish the letter? All right. What started off? Okay, so here we go.

Speaker 2:          00:50:11       Uh, to be to this. I replied, honestly, it's it, if it's my choice, I don't want to go. Please stop asking me about it. I don't know how many more ways I can request that they go. Okay. He responded with, I'll hold off, but know this, God loves you and will not quit if I do. Okay, well then there's no reason to hit me two times. Let's just let God do it. All right. Anyways, here. Cause my question, Bill, why does this fucking Piss me off so much? Why did these, why did these cults do, uh, what do these cults do to these people? He's involved with the Church that people do joke around with and call a cult. What would you do if you were me at this point? I don't even want to talk to this guy cause he's conversations are infuriating me.

Speaker 2:          00:50:57       Um, yeah, I would, I would cut this guy out of your life. It's annoying. This is what it is. Why you feel that way? No, but this is his friend Fred. It's his friend and he and he wa he wants to get them out of the cult. So the thing is is if you go to him and you try to get them out of it, you just going to drive them further into it. So what you do is just say he just stopped being friends with them, you know, and hope that that'll help because they're not going to go out of that then he's not going to leave it if you ask them to leave it. Yeah. You never, you never know. But yeah, he needs to just kind of mouth cause yeah, there's no, you can't, unless he wants to spend the rest of his time with his guide debating Catholicism or whatever, which I'm sure he doesn't want to do.

Speaker 2:          00:51:39       And then yeah, he should just kinda mom personally, I would still hang out with them. And you would just so you could get into debates with him? No, and I would just do unbelievably say titanic been annoying shit. That good idea. I would, I would list, he should do that. I would always have like shout at the devil playing, you know, or maybe just that beginning cheesy thing. She didn't invite women to a restaurant and it turns out to be like a strip club and see what he does. Yeah, but you're going to see the titties on the outside gentleman's club. That's true. No, I wouldn't do that shit. I would just, I would hang out with him and hang out with, I would keep saying that I want to get involved in the church and I would keep going to events and as they were going, you know, I just feel so filled up with God's love. I would then be a, you want to talk about filled up? I fucking jerked off into this chick's mouth. Like I'm telling you, William Byrd, she had a big bass miles and I dunno, maybe it was a couple of days since the last time I fucking, you know, let them loose. But I right up to the brim. She was a champion. She swallowed, I'm sorry, what were you saying?

Speaker 2:          00:52:44       This is why you're going there now. Oh, why don't you pray for me?

Speaker 7:          00:53:01       Yes. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:53:23       Um, there was a lot of shit this, that fucking annoyed

Speaker 6:          00:53:26       me. Um, on the gas mileage thing I brought up last week how I was watching the good bye girl and she was standing at the corner of the characters, was standing in front of a fucking Subaru and uh, it got 39 miles per gallon and here it is 36 years later and my car only gets fucking enough. A hybrid only gets 41 miles per gallon. So this brilliant guy writes in and he goes and he starts talking about leaded gas and all this fucking Ho how cars today are heavier. This fucking Moron thought cars today were heavier than cars back in the day. You know, like the 1959 Cadillac, I'm sure that that car was lighter than your average Toyota Camry.

Speaker 5:          00:54:18       Okay.

Speaker 6:          00:54:18       So anyways, this, somebody sent me, let me, let me actually read this guy's, this guy's response here. One of the many that I got. Um, on the gas mileage thing, it always blows my mind what people fucking respond to. So this guy ends up writing me a, he goes, there are two reasons. Wait a minute, it's loading.

Speaker 5:          00:54:39       Okay,

Speaker 6:          00:54:40       loading. I don't know. He gave me all these fucking reasons and I basically responded with so basic, you're telling me, he basically said that it had nothing to do with money. It had to do with the way to the cars and somehow the, the mixture of the gasoline that we use nowadays. That's why they just can't figure out a fucking way to get more than like better than what's the highest you've seen? Like 40 45 this guy tried to say, well actually there, there are things that get a hundred miles to gallon their scooters. Uh, what a more rod he goes. It's true reason why old cars have such highly high published gas mileage. For one, the EPA test simply used to provide higher numbers. Sir, they've been doing that right up until the last couple of years ago. In fact, the year before I bought my Prius, they were legally able to claim that it got like 55th I actually almost 60 miles per gallon before they cracked down on the hybrid and made him say actually 40 ones.

Speaker 6:          00:55:41       I'm aware of the EPA test. I'm aware that they do it when there's no headwind. I'm aware that most of the test is when they're fucking going 25 miles an hour and they only drive the car 55 miles an hour for about fucking 30 seconds. I realize that the numbers are skewed. Okay. He said it's been revised several times over the decade. Yeah, so my Prius, you're Prius would get like 70 miles per gallon on the old test. No, it wasn't sir. No, it wouldn't. It would get more like 60 that's what it did look. So let's just say that it would get 70 who gives a shit? He goes, wait, where am I? The second reason is safety features. Check out the weight of your cars have gotten heavier. No, they have it. My Prius is not heavier than a fucking Subaru.

Speaker 1:          00:56:30       Yeah.

Speaker 6:          00:56:30       In the 1970s it isn't.

Speaker 1:          00:56:34       Okay,

Speaker 6:          00:56:34       dude, I'm old enough to remember when cars actually had metal on their dashboard. They're all plastics hunks of shit now.

Speaker 1:          00:56:42       Yeah.

Speaker 6:          00:56:43       He goes, cars, if even 15 years ago, feature death traps when compared to the modern cars. No, they didn't. They've had the crumple free zones. Those, those little crumpled freak, they've had those crumple zones for years, sir. In 19 fucking 88 I was coming home from a Christmas party drunk off my ass, sitting in the fucking passenger seat of a Pontiac Grand Prix. We pulled up to a red light. There was a fucking jeep CJ seven the old school ones sitting there. All right. We saw it. I saw it. The driver's saw it, but the alcohol didn't quite see it and we just sorta went. We were slowing down, but we didn't come to us. Complete slow stop and just completely rear ended. This guy. All right. There wasn't a scratch on the fucking jeep. This goddamn carp folded up like a fucking accordion. The engine dropped down underneath us and I, I got, I didn't even get a booboo.

Speaker 6:          00:57:42       I just Sorta, you know, I didn't have a seatbelt on or nothing. The car was designed to take 80% of the fucking impact. All right. You're sitting in your cubicle. Just toss in these fucking numbers out. All right, so basically my response is, I'm saying it has nothing to do with money in the oil companies. So basically what you're telling me is that nowadays I can have a video conference with somebody in Brazil while my entire music collection is in my pocket on a phone that is also a camera and a video recorder. I can upload the content onto the Internet and potentially have it viewed by every person in the fucking world. But we can't make a car that does any better than 40 miles per gallon. So fortunately, you know, everything else has fucking progressed except for gas mileage. Dude, I'm telling you, they have the technology to get like 500 miles per gallon. They're just not going to fucking put it out,

Speaker 1:          00:58:37       okay.

Speaker 6:          00:58:37       Because that's how powerful the God damn oil companies are there. Right up there with the banks. You got the banks and then you've got the oil company. The banks control the money supply, and then the oil companies, they control energy.

Speaker 1:          00:58:51       Okay.

Speaker 6:          00:58:51       Okay. You control energy. You can control the fucking population. Do you know that? They're actually out here. This people, this selling kits out here to have your own fucking windmill so you can get yourself off the grid. So then they immediately pass the fucking law, General Electric, that General Electric had to come around and make sure that everything was safe. They had to get their fucking noses back in there. So cause they can't have people disappearing off the fucking grid.

Speaker 1:          00:59:18       Okay?

Speaker 6:          00:59:18       You can't have people getting free energy other than the cost of the fucking windmill. You can't have them sitting there. And every time the God damn wind blows, it recharges a generator and now I don't have to work as much if I don't have to work as much. I don't have to go into debt. You're getting yourself off of the fucking treadmill and they can't have that. All right. God dammit. I wish I was more intelligent so I could explain this better. But you know what, this is a great documentary. I'm actually going to email this guy back. It's called the gas whole full documentary. And there's the they and they have everything from,

Speaker 2:          00:59:55       okay.

Speaker 6:          00:59:55       They have everything from the, the, the urban myth of the watered powered carburetor, which this guy who are brought to me completely dismissed. He completely dismissed any sort of a that, that, that, that, that exists because he sits in a cubicle and I sit in the fucking bedroom, all right? And he tries to just say, that's just another media hoax. All, you know, they said, do we beat Eisenhower? A fucking like dumb shit like that.

Speaker 2:          01:00:22       Okay.

Speaker 6:          01:00:24       This guy, so this documentary, I have everything from like the urban myths that the, that these, uh, water powered cars existed, um, all the way up to actual, uh, retired, um, scientists who worked for Shell, who you just have to watch this documentary. They were showing, there was a book out that claimed that they could get a 149 miles per gallon in the 1950s on like a Packard or de Soto. And by the 70s this scientist who worked for Shell said they had gotten it up to a thousand miles per gallon.

Speaker 2:          01:01:00       All right.

Speaker 6:          01:01:01       I don't know why people think

Speaker 2:          01:01:04       that it's, it's

Speaker 6:          01:01:07       absolutely impossible to improve the gas mileage. Some people feel that. I don't know why people feel like we can't come up with anything better than the gas combustion engine. It's complete fucking book. It's the same level of bullshit as that. There's an actual difference between a Democrat and a Republican. Watch this documentary, the gas hole. We're going to have the link up on the Monday morning podcast. Just watch this shit and I don't know what to tell you. Some of it looks like, okay, they have this old guy going, you know, and this guy showed up and he heard it was a contraption made auto, you know, it was powered on water and then he claimed that Shell bought the patent, gave him $1 million and then he could never fucking, you know, make another one now. That's the kind of Shit, some old guy saying that he saw it on a salt flat in the 1950s I'm not going with that. All right? I'm not that much of a fucking whack job, but when a guy who worked used to work for Shell is coming out saying that type of stuff, it's just, it gets to the point like, are all of these people nuts?

Speaker 2:          01:02:12       You know what I mean?

Speaker 6:          01:02:14       There's no fucking way. I don't give a shit whether there's led and gas, whether there's not led and how much the car fucking ways or any of that bullshit. There's no fucking way.

Speaker 1:          01:02:25       Okay.

Speaker 6:          01:02:25       That in, in, in almost 40 years, you can't do better than two more miles per gallon. I absolutely fucking refuse to believe it. I fucking refuse to believe it. I think it's complete fucking horseshit. It's just another way to, to keep control of the herd. Now, if you want to argue that you need to keep control to her or this is going to be absolute chaos, so we have to keep cars down like that. I will listen to that argument. But if you're going to come at me and tell me that in 2000 fucking 11

Speaker 1:          01:02:54       okay,

Speaker 6:          01:02:54       okay. When I'm reading shit that in the medical field, they can now grow a fucking a new colon for somebody outside of the body. I read this, this thing on their ted.com this woman had a completely ulcerated large intestine, so they took some sort of tissue, CARF culture, whatever the fuck that means out of her of diseased colon. Use that to then grow another one outside of a body where they would done growing it. They took the old one out and put the new one in like she went down to midas muffler and it totally fucking worked okay. Up until like five years ago, you will looking at a colostomy bag, you would have a bag of shit right under her fucking right titty for the rest of her goddamn life. Her social life would have been over. Okay. If they can do that, you're telling me you're still going to tell me they can't do any better than about 40 fucking 45 miles a gallon. You're really going to sit there and believe that in your Goddamn cubicle that they just can't fucking, just can't fucking figure it out. The only way I can get like a hundred miles a gallon is if I ride on a fucking scooter. You sir, believe in Santa Claus.

Speaker 1:          01:04:14       Yeah.

Speaker 6:          01:04:15       I remember one time I have this old piece of shit truck, right? That I drove for like 10 years because I knew I wanted to be a comedian and I didn't want to go into debt. So when the engine finally died, I threw a new engine in there and the guy told me he needed to rebuild the carburetor. I'm like, you don't need to rebuild the carburetor so you know what this cunt did. He fucking adjusted the carburetors. So I would just get shitty gas mileage hoping I would be an absolute fucking moron and then drive back and be like, Whoa, I guess you're right. I'm just, I'm just chowing through gas here. That's what this mother fucker did.

Speaker 1:          01:04:52       Okay.

Speaker 6:          01:04:53       At his little garage. This little piece of shit did that because it wasn't enough that he fucking made 1600 fucking bucks off me. He wanted to make like fucking 1900 bucks. So he did that just as a fucking individual. And you're going to try and tell me that a corporation that basically controls the world fucking energy.

Speaker 6:          01:05:14       He's not going to buy up patents by people that, that are, that are, that are are, are making or coming up with a carburetors and stuff like carburetors. But both coming up with, with, with alternate ways of powering a car more efficiently. They're not going to buy that up. Do they have that whole Stanley mayor thing? And that's not a conspiracy theory either. We actually, we actually played the news clip on the opie and Anthony Show. Stanley mayor, great news for individuals, but bad news for oil companies claims he's come up with an engine that can run on any type of water, fresh water, salt water, rainwater doesn't make a difference in he claims he can drive across the country on 28 gallons of water. Um, this is of such interest. The Pentagon is sending a lieutenant colonel out there. That was the actual news clip from the opiate Anthony show.

Speaker 6:          01:06:09       It was an actual news clip. It's not some bullshit I read on a fucking website. Okay. Now what happened after that? Nobody knows. But basically within 10 years, Stanley was dead in his car disappeared. And his brother right now is trying to get the car back and nobody knows where the fuck it is. All right? Um, I, I truly believe that the quickest death sentence you could possibly have is to go on the news and claim that you've come out with an alternate source of energy that's going to put a corporation out of business that is making, that is projected to make $350 billion next year. How much do you think your life is worth? And if you have $350 billion, how easy is it do you think, to get somebody to solve this problem?
