Speaker 1:          00:00:01       Hey, what's going on is bill burr and it's time for the Monday morning podcast for Monday, December 18th, 2017. What's going on? How are Ya? How you doing? How are Yay, look at you over there. You look good. You look good. Um, I, you know, a lot of people probably think I'm in a great mood with that patriots' victory, uh, yesterday, which is actually today cause I'm recording at night, but uh, I just had what can they fix that fucking rule.

Speaker 2:          00:00:32       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:00:34       That's it. It's a catch. You caught the fucking ball. You're ran with the ball. You stick it over the goal line. It's a fucking touchdown. Dez Bryant, few years ago, fucking touchdown. The week before that, whoever the fucking cowboys played, was it the lions? They should have won that game. I, I don't, I don't fucking get it. I don't understand how that rule is supposed to make it less confusing. Nobody even touched the guy. He had control of the ball. I, I don't like the ground. Can't cause a fumble, but it can cause an incomplete pass. It can break up a pass. So it only if you're a receiver do you get fucked over by the ground? But if you're a running back, you're in the clear does that how it works daddy? They made a football move. I'll tell you, that's going to be the last one. Did they? They're going to have to adjust it. That rule during the off season. They have to fix it cause that was for home field advantage, um,

Speaker 1:          00:01:44       throughout the playoffs. That was fucking huge. And uh, it's a fucking amazing game. Amazing fucking game. Right? I think we both can agree with that on both sides. And by the way, conti ass fucking Steeler fans. Remember I'm saying this shit for one. The pendulum swings your fucking way. All right. I hate why he would fucking, when I hate those sports fans where if there's a bullshit call in in a, it goes your way. Yo Bro. That's like that 50 year old guy banging an 18 year old girl was, you know, I just know scumbag Arry going on there. Um, yeah, that, that, I dunno, that whole fucking thing was just like, I'm trying to remember what happened. At the end of the game. Okay. The game starts off great. I know. I'm going to say the guy's fucking name wrong. I've been too fucking busy. But, uh, seeing Ryan Shazier is NSA Shazier,

Speaker 1:          00:02:51       you know, at the game, that was great to see. And he looked like he was in great spirits and I was looking up like, like, I don't know if you guys know this, but like paralysis is a major fucking like phobia, you know, like when people go, I don't want to be burned at death. Like my thing is, is just fucking laying there and not being able to move. Um, I dunno like that, that just seems like the worst, I don't know, worse than fucking death. So to see the tech guys getting feeling in his legs and that type of stuff was, I don't, I'm just some weird selfish way. It was like a relief to me. Probably should have thought of him first, but I'm a selfish cunt living in Hollywood and that's why the good lord is burning it down. Um, no, let's, let's even mean you know what, you know what it was.

Speaker 1:          00:03:33       I actually felt great for the guy, but I, I grew up in such a fucked up part of the world that actually me saying something nice about him. I got, I get weirded out. So then I had to be a dick throughout all of that. So anyways, what I'm trying to say is I'm really happy that that guy looks like he's going to be okay. Okay. That's what I was trying to say. So it starts off with that and then it's going to be another classic Patriot Steeler battle, which it was, we missed an extra point. Is that going to come back to haunt us? There's no way this game could go into overtime. That's what I'm thinking. And then all of a sudden

Speaker 1:          00:04:07       to the steel has had the fucking game one who's kitten Ho and then the last two possessions before we went with the go ahead score, they kind of fucking played the little alligator arm ball. Right. Which allowed us to get back in it. Then Brady threw an interception, but the guy dropped it. Sorry, the guy drops the ball. This is what I can remember the dewdrop drop the fucking ball. That was the end of the game. And then Tony Romo goals yet though. I get the chance. Was it basically what I was saying, we go down the field, Brady to Gronk Brady to Gronk Brady Brady to Gronk touchdown two point conversion Brady to Gronk go fuck yourself. All right.

Speaker 2:          00:04:45       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:04:47       That was like when Batman and Robin and the TV show would be stuck in a fucking trap. You know what I mean? And they, we ended the episode, lots of that for the cake crusade. Then all of a sudden they break out and they beat the fuck out of everybody, right? That was the football version of that. Okay. So then there's 50 something seconds left and now I'm not feeling comfortable cause they got fucking Big Ben and they have this great field goal kicker and I know that everybody's going to go into the fucking whatever the fuck they went into, whatever that defenses that makes everybody look like Joe Montana, including fucking, uh, Jimmy Garappolo out there in San Francisco. I love how both quarterbacks, who's The fucking guy in Tennessee? Is it Vinny Testaverde? Is he still playing? Uh, Mike Moriarty? What the fucks, I can never remember his name. The kid from Oregon, he marches down the field, go ahead. Score, you know, against their fucking end of the game. So now we don't play defense. So I guess the ratings increase is that what happens?

Speaker 2:          00:05:45       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:05:46       Right. They go ahead and when they go for the go ahead score, then fucking 49 is get the ball back or they just marched right down the goddamn field. The old right there, Fred. Um, anyways,

Speaker 2:          00:05:58       yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:05:58       So it was like 56 seconds left. What the fuck? Just don't let them get out of bounds. Give him the middle of the field. I guess that's what they try to do. And what do we do? What the fuck did we do? How many times is our defense going to do this to Tom Brady after he wins a fucking game? God knows we did it twice. Playing the giants and the Superbowl. Tom, terrific. As Paul Versey calls them, goes down the fucking field and for the go ahead score, all that defense has to do is stop them. Sanjay Samuel drops the fucking ball. Uh, anyways, I don't know what the fuck. Let me, let me, let me stay on this year here. So I don't know what this fucking defense is going to do. So for whatever fucking reason, Ben Roethlisberger fucking throws. What was, it was at a screen pass that goes for 69 fucking yards. It was like the guide. It was like the, all of a sudden we turned to look at a third grade pop Warner team. Two guys bump into each other and the dude continues on down the fucking sideline. Now that down at the 10 yard line and all, I'm thinking, well the very least this is going to go into fucking overtime,

Speaker 2:          00:07:11       right?

Speaker 1:          00:07:13       Ben goes back to pass, throws it to the fuck. Was it a white dude? I don't even remember. Everything happened so fast. He caught the ball. He goes in touchdown, right? Well, they've got to look to see if his knees down hair. I can't believe. I cannot fucking believe they called that back.

Speaker 2:          00:07:34       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:07:35       What more do you have to do to establish possession? He's got the ball. Is he supposed to stop with 10 seconds left and hold it up to the ref? This is a football, I have it in my hands to try to run it in. The guy did exactly what the fuck he was supposed to do. He caught the ball, headed to the end zone, reached out and score. They took it away from him. Then I think the, uh, you know, this is when it comes down to coaching and this is why the Patriots win these Games is that when they fucking call the fucking touchdown back, it didn't look like the fucking Steelers knew what they wanted to do. I don't know what the hell that was and I'm just basically telling you what the fuck you saw. Um, cause I'm doing it Sunday night. I still can't believe that we, not even that we won the game. I can't believe that that wasn't a catch and a touchdown. I don't know what else you have to do.

Speaker 2:          00:08:40       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:08:40       To show a possession. You know what, I'm to them for like the 19th time on this fucking podcast. I'm going to look up this rule and I'm going to read it. Reading NFL rules is is it's like reading the Bible. It's like what are they about?

Speaker 2:          00:08:57       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:08:57       Alright. Nfl. That's why you have a preacher for all the dummies out. Like I actually, do you mind times? I've sat down when I was younger and I tried to read the Bible.

Speaker 2:          00:09:07       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:09:07       It's like don't kick. Can we, can we update this shit? Can we put it in in some, in, in just some language that I can understand cause it might as well be in Latin. I don't know what anybody's talking about. Just know there's a lot of murder incest in the beginning. It's just like, I don't want to see the end of this movie. All right. Nfl Rule and that felt real catching pass.

Speaker 2:          00:09:34       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:09:34       How many people look completing a catch?

Speaker 2:          00:09:38       Okay,

Speaker 1:          00:09:40       what in the fuck do you have to do? All right. A player who makes a catch may advance the ball. I'm aware of that a Ford pass is, it is complete by the offense or interceptor intercepted by the defense. If a player who is inbounds number one, secure is control of the ball in his hands or arms prior to the ball touching the ground.

Speaker 2:          00:10:04       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:10:05       Which I felt that guy did see. The thing is you have to know what they consider securing the ball. I think he was supposed to hold it like an infant and two touches the ground in bounds with both feet. Oh. At any part of his body and others had that was not pluggable to this. All right. Well I mean, yeah, I guess it's applicable to every catch it, but it wasn't. There was no out-of-bounds issue. Here's what I'm saying. Number three maintains control of the ball after a and B have been fulfilled until he has the ball long enough to clearly become a runner. That's another weird thing. It's like he's running while he catches it, he's a runner. The whole fucking play. What we mean is running in full possession of the ball after fulfilling the the requirements of number one and number two. I'm a player, has the ball long enough to become a runner when after his second foot is on the ground, he is capable of avoiding or warding off in pending contact of an opponent.

Speaker 2:          00:11:08       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:11:09       What if it's a bang bang play I guess then it's not a catch. Well I guess they call that all the time. Okay. Comma, tucking the ball away, turning up field or taking additional steps. So that's what happens at, I think at the goal line is when you're that close and there's that little time left, you don't have time and you're fallen to the ground, you don't have time to Tuck the ball away.

Speaker 2:          00:11:34       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:11:35       They okay. They have to put something here for this goal line shit or first her first down situations where they have to be able to understand that somebody is reaching the ball forward to either get a first down or a touchdown. Maybe that's what it is. So I guess because didn't Tuck the ball the way. If a player has control of the ball, a slight movement of the ball would not be considered a loss of possession. He must lose control of the ball in order to rule that there has been a loss of possession, so he has to establish control and then lose control. If the player loses the ball while simultaneously touching both feet or any part of his body to the ground, it's not a catch. All right, so both feet were on the ground so they thought he lost control of the ball or never had it to begin with despite the fact that he caught it and then turned up field for those finals, whatever, three yards saw the goal line, took the ball in, reached over the fucking goal line. I just feel like for me, when you fucking have the ball and you're like, if he wasn't in control, he wouldn't have done something like that.

Speaker 1:          00:12:54       He wouldn't be going like Wah Wah, like fucking he at that time at the fucking juggling the fucking thing.

Speaker 3:          00:13:03       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:13:04       All right. End Zone catches for the requirement for a catch in the end zone or the same as the requirements for a catch in the field of play. Note in the field of play, if a catch of a Ford Pass has been completed after which contact by a defendant causes the ball to become loose before the runner is down by contact, it is a fumble and the ball remains alive. That all makes sense. In the end zone, the same action is a touchdown because the plays automatically. Oh, okay. I understand that. That makes sense.

Speaker 3:          00:13:32       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:13:33       All right. Four ball touches ground. If the ball touches the ground after the players secures control of it, it is a catch provided. The player continues to maintain control. All right, so they didn't think he either secured or had control of it. So what constitutes having control of it or securing the ball? Jesus fucking Christ. I mean dd you feel any closer to having an answer for that? I don't. Um, anyways, so here's a bright side. If you're a Steeler fan.

Speaker 3:          00:14:10       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:14:13       In this weird way. I was kind of hoping the Patriots were going to lose that game even though we would have to play you guys in Pittsburgh. I just feel like both teams are so evenly matched that is going to be very hard for one of the two teams to beat each other twice to sweep the other teams. So I was thinking like, well, if we lose then Bella check is going to figure out what they're fucking doing and then he'll correct it and he's done that time and again, and he will avenge the loss and God knows we've gone into Pittsburgh enough time in one there. So we know we can do that. But now, I dunno, I dunno about this one.

Speaker 3:          00:14:50       I Dunno. Like,

Speaker 1:          00:14:52       uh, that was just a weird, it's just a fun, it was just a weird ending to a game. Okay. And all of that. What's going to be forgot is that we gave up 69 yards on a fucking screen pass at the end of the fucking game and should a lost, but we did. So now we're going to be home. I Dunno. I Dunno. That was a, that was weird. That was a weird one. Uh, that was just a weird one. But thank God in Pittsburgh they've gone back to back with Stanley Cups. Okay. So they can fucking, uh, they can stick both those in their ears so they don't want to listen to dead fucking crying in the other room. I don't know what to tell you guys. That was, you know,

Speaker 3:          00:15:39       I dunno.

Speaker 1:          00:15:42       I am now fascinated with this. I am officially after, this is the third time I've seen a team get fucked over on a touchdown or winning the game. I have to figure out what the fuck.

Speaker 3:          00:15:55       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:15:56       When, when did do you like tucking the ball away? Like there's so many times when you say fourth and a couple of yards where you have to catch and people are coming in, you've got to grab it and fucking reach forward to get a first down. I Dunno, I have no idea. But you know, it's funny. On Twitter they were blaming the patriots like some outlets are shit, you know.

Speaker 3:          00:16:22       Okay

Speaker 1:          00:16:23       packers, you know, you could shit on the packers, couldn't you? Then they benefit from that cowboy has benefited and got fucked. I don't fucking know. I don't know. Somehow I know it will somehow go back to deflate gate and somehow it will go back to that shit once again. You know what I mean? I swear to God. Um, anyways, plowing ahead. I just got back from Orlando, Florida in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. Uh, two of the most fun shows I had this year. Um, just great crowds. I was down there with a forest Shah and um,

Speaker 1:          00:16:56       it's great pan of Jag. I, I'm just not drinking dude. So I'm getting up early. I've been practicing my drums, kind of hard to practice drums now when I, uh, it's just like when we edit a lot of the times my daughter's up and then the, the one window I have to play is like this time at night right now when she goes to go to sleep. So I can't be a Douche, so I don't, uh, not playing as much as I would like to play. But I saw, I watched two amazing documentaries on Netflix.

Speaker 3:          00:17:28       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:17:31       I was embarrassed by my, I'll show you. You know, do you guys know like on your Netflix homepage, like everybody's homepage is different because they sort of watch what you watch. They have like this fucking thing and then like whatever you're into, you know what I mean? You guys, why am I going to explain to people how it works? You know how it fucking works. Everybody's is different. So what mine became was everything that I was watching. See now it's cool again. But what it was before was everything was just fucking drug cartels behind the scene. Prison Shit.

Speaker 3:          00:18:09       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:18:12       What else did the head, it was all just, yeah, it was just all shit like that. And then, yeah, it was just all prisons, drug dealers, people getting killed, all of this shit. So I watched two fucking documentaries, like as I got, I got, I got, I got to watch some other shit too to switch this up a little bit. And, um, I watched the John Coltrane documentary and then I watched one called, uh, I called him Morgan, which is about this trumpet player that I had never heard of before called [inaudible] guy's name was lead Morgan. And, um,

Speaker 1:          00:18:46       I cannot tell you how great a player the guy is and it's an amazing documentary. Really sad too. But uh, but since I did that, I watched two things with black people in it. I now have a thing, Nat King Cole, they got, she's gotta have it up here is something about Richard Pryor, but I also got better call Saul. You know what I mean? There's a way to do this because you're gonna miss all this other cool shit if you just keep going down the rabbit hole watching the same shit. I got to Jimi Hendrix thing, I got the Jerry Seinfeld comedian. I got one of the star wars movies. Something about Mike Tyson, right? I think it's funny they got that whole something on Jacko. Pistorious it's, and he says fucking named World War Two when color right. There you go. No more prison shit. This is great.

Speaker 1:          00:19:38       Perfect pulp fiction. I like it now. It was going too far. The other, the other direction like, oh this is all this guy wants to see. Cause I watched this thing, they will like, you know, before, never seen behind the scenes in a Russian prison and they would show in these guys. And I'm as bad as the prison was. What's great about it was, is if you commit a bad enough crime, you don't have to worry about getting raped. Guess they don't leave me alone. They're staring at your 24 fucking seven. Um, I didn't watch it that long enough. All I know is the crimes these guys committed was so fucking horrific. And then they cut to the, um, the, the warden and he goes, I have no sympathy for these people whatsoever. And I was just like, yeah, neither do I. This guy killed the whole family and then like took their bodies out in the woods and fucking lit them on fire. And it's just like, yeah, fuck that guy. And the guy sitting there going, you know, you gotta be really strong mentally here, Rah Rah, you're not gonna make it. And it's just like, I hope you don't. I, yeah. So I watch 10 minutes of it and I agreed with the warden and I shut it off and then I just looked my page at that point and that's all it was. Um, but anyways, I got to tell you that, um,

Speaker 1:          00:20:55       Lee Morgan was a guy I believe. Who did he start out with? I watched so much shit this weekend.

Speaker 1:          00:21:01       The fuck did he started out with, he started with felonious monk. I can't remember. He played a little bit with John Coltrane and then he got into a, with Art Blakey, the Jazz messengers, and then he went out on his own. But like his playing is just, he sees one of the guys, you know what I mean? I don't know. Like, you know, like guitar players, there's a bunch of guys that can fucking shred and then there's the guy that makes you fucking hair stand up on your arm. Like that guy's one of the guys. He's that with the trumpet. The name of the thing is called, I called him Morgan, I forgot what the John Coltrane was, but the cold train one was on a whole other level where, uh, it actually makes you want to be a better person. That's the only way to describe it. His fucking worldview was incredible and I didn't, I didn't know a lot about them. You know, I'm the typical John Coltrane hacky fan. Like I have a love supreme, you know, but I should get all those other ones, blue train and all that type of stuff. But, um, I always went down the miles Davis,

Speaker 3:          00:22:02       uh,

Speaker 1:          00:22:04       road work, wherever he went, whoever he played with, I just kind of followed all the way through that. And I know Coltrane was, was with them twice. Um, he got fired one time and the second time he left. And uh, so then I just followed miles into his second, uh, was a quartet or quintet, I think quintet. And that's the one with Tony Williams. And then I just stayed with Tony Right through lifetime and all the shit he was doing. And I kind of missed all those other guys. So I'm finally going back and listening to all these guys and that, that fucking music is incredible. It's fucking incredible. And the way they shoot it in the black and white, when you see the video and stuff, it's unbelievable. And there's this weird thing where you wouldn't think with jazz is like a danger to it, but there's like a fucking edge to it that is a, I dunno, it's compelling. And I just, I wish they had more documentaries like that on a, on Netflix or if people know or some other streaming services, some shit where I can watch it because, uh, I would watch

Speaker 1:          00:23:13       of about anybody from that. And then I ended up finding out by Shelly, is it Shelly Mann? A Shelly main, he's a famous, um, jazz drummer, a white dude. And through watching the Coltrane thing, I saw the played a Gig and he had this, this Shelly Mann had this place called sh Shelly Mann's manhole is Shelley's manhole or something like that. And I was sitting there going like, I wonder where that it, that that was in la because nothing has ever preserved in la. And, uh, I found out that it's right on cove whanga just north of sunset, right around the corner from big Wang's where I used to go there all the time before I was married and watch games and all that shit. And I just was thinking like miles Davis, John Coltrane, all these monster fucking players

Speaker 3:          00:24:07       all

Speaker 1:          00:24:08       played live right around the corner for where me and my friends were

Speaker 1:          00:24:13       like 50 years later gone dude all day. Like how much that blocked dropped off. Uh, but, uh, very announced La thing. I guess there's some sort of commemorative thing to that jazz club in the sidewalk. They're like, I'm not like a star or anything, but I thought that was pretty cool. So anyways, all right, so there's that checkup, both those documentaries, if you're into that type of shit. And I know I'm all over the map here. A little music, little sports, maybe I'm a little law. Maybe this is a nice little fucking balance here for once. Um, all right. I do have some sad news here and this really is sad news. Uh, I lost another advertiser. Now, if you're a fan of the podcast, you know, this shit happens all the fucking time to me. All right? There's a, there's people that, you know, they don't quite appreciate the, my colorful way that I try to sell the products. Um, but these people, they hung in there for a long time and they finally had enough of me and I just want to thank them for being on the podcast. I had a great time reading their, their copy, a farewell to Sherry's berries. Evidently I finally went too far where I somehow made a clan reference while reading about chocolate covered strawberries.

Speaker 1:          00:25:32       I thought it was funny, you know, I was with Harris standing. He, you know,

Speaker 1:          00:25:41       I guess if I was by myself and I made the claim reference, it would seem weird, but, uh, I was in the room with another black guy, not another black guy with the black guy. Right. With another guy who was black. That's how I was trying to say. Right. So then obviously it doesn't then obviously mean that I'm just fucking around. I don't know.

Speaker 1:          00:40:51       Yeah. Okay. You don't sound too enthused. Would you like your own microphone?

Speaker 4:          00:40:55       No, that's okay. How does use yours? I think it'd be better if you had your own microphone. Talk to the Pe. No people from it. Um, people describe what I'm wearing right now. Bill is wearing a pair of pajamas that I got him for Christmas, not last year, but maybe the year before last year was the last year. What a pair of pajamas that had got him last year. Oh, I don't know what another fight and he looks like, um, like he's on that show. My two dads that I look more my three,

Speaker 1:          00:41:35       my three dads was no, my two dads was a porno, wasn't, no, it wasn't 80 show about a girl who had two dads for a reason that I can't really recall for the situation. Comedy of it. Maybe her mom died and her mom wasn't sure which one was her dad. So they were both her dad or maybe she was dating one, but the other one was her dad. I don't really know, but it was my two dads and I used to watch it sounds like the ges was flying around. All right. MP three player. I know. What do you want me for me? MP three player. Hey Billy. Red faced very Christmas dude. Uh, thank you. Uh, my suggested Merry Christmas to you too. My suggestion for MP three player is the Apple Watch I'm trying to get at, I'm trying to get out of them. I'm trying to get away from apple. Okay. Cause I have all this other music and they just won't recognize it and I buy it off of them, but they don't have it.

Speaker 2:          00:42:31       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:42:31       All right. Whatever. I'll listen to you. I know it's more than an MP three player, but that's the great thing is you get so much more for the money. The big drawback is that you can only use Bluetooth headphones with it. That's the thing about app and let me guess, only Bluetooth headphones made by fucking apple. Other than that, I liked that it stays strapped to your wrist, so you don't need to carry anything else with you. Uh, if you've got the series three with the Elta, sounds like a giant commercial for this thing. Uh, but I, you know, I did ask the series three with LTE a doubles as a phone. What he talked to your risks like fucking captain Kirk. The call time is very limited. I'm not doing this. Why would I do this? I'm just, okay friend who smells like anus. Hell boy.

Speaker 1:          00:43:21       Hey, you redheaded Mick bastard. Um, I don't give a shit. What are you going to do? I don't want to. What about the thing I told you? What do you think about that? Were, you know Matt Damon commented on, that's the stuff going on in Hollywood. So this person wrote an article about him and they go, Matt Damon, a white male Blahblahblahblahblah like, it was just like, Oh, who doesn't know? He's a white guy. Like what does that mean? It means, and maybe he should shut as big white SRAP. Is that not race baiting? That's like some fox new shit. There was no reason to say what his race was or his sex was there and the person, there was nothing. Anything else add? They just said that the, he was a white male and then they just continued on with the fucking thing. It's fucking, this is such a, it's, I swear to God watching, I dunno. It's just I don't get, if you just going to, if you just just say, listen on now, now it's my turn to be a Douche. Then I'm fine with it, but don't fuck it. Act like you're a better person because you're not. I mean that's, that's a fucked up. I mean you keep

Speaker 4:          00:44:32       what he's looking at me like you can't, you can't fucking go two wrongs don't make a right. Nothing. What do you mean two wrongs don't make a right. That's total. That's fucking race baiting. Raise baiting and who? All stereotypes above fucking with his whole thing about sexual harassment raise meeting is the same as someone's a white male. How has that raised baiting? This is so funny. I sound like a black person right now and you sound like a white person. What always said was says he was just white. I don't understand what you mean. Call somebody what they are. A white male. Oh, you're saying that if this was like Fox News they'd be no, this is no, this is what they were doing. Tyrrell Jackson. Oh, black male was spotted at the Bubba. I like the way they do that type of shit. I'm saying the reason that they added that detail was because he was commenting on sexual harassment and white guys positions of power in all of that.

Speaker 4:          00:45:29       So what they was saying in there is they just say white males. So then you can go with all your stereotypes and be like, oh, totally privileged enough to work for shit in a position of power. He doesn't understand this. Like all this negative shit where it was no longer Matt Damon. It was hashtag white male trash. That's what the fucking guy was doing. Or woman, whoever wrote that fucking article. That's what bugged me. Whether you agreed with what he said or not is a completely different thing, but I just, it just was like, what the fuck does anyone who the fuck doesn't know Matt Damon's a white guy?

Speaker 4:          00:46:04       No, he's just some, and they had a fucking picture of them anyways. If he was some complete nobody. I see the picture. It was a giant picture of Matt Damon's Whitehead and they go, Matt Damon, a white male. You know what they're doing. That's that feminist fucking psycho shit feminist psycho shit. That fucking psycho shit, white male trash, all that shit that they're doing that literally doing the Sh, not, not saying all of them are doing it, but they're doing that shit where they're there. They're fighting this thing that they are literally becoming really, no, no, no, no. Keep it out. I'm not talking about what he said. I'm talking about. That fucking detail was fucking weird. Just throw on there. Matt Damon Cama, Matt Damon, White Male. I was like male prostitute. It's like what? I just remembered. What the fuck does that have to do with anything? And then I'd read the art, the gist of the article.

Speaker 4:          00:46:57       I'm like, Oh, oh I see why you threw that in there. Cause I mean he's speaking like a typical white guy. So yeah, it was, wow, look at that. Look at these all. Look at always getting thrown around. Well why you Nia? You know how they are. You know how those white guys are where you feel like I am Sikh, I secretly hate people. No, no, no. I'm just, I'm actually in a way enjoying this shit. Why? Because of all that. Hey white guys are evil and blah, blah, blah, blah, and I just know to human beings who have too much fucking power. I would agree with that. And when you have too much power as a nation or as a fucking race or a sex, you stent you 10 it's very hard to not overstep. You bounce. Right. Okay. And what I am now seeing is the pendulum is changing is that people that what I always felt as people just, they're going to behave the same way.

Speaker 4:          00:47:48       It's not going to become better. It's just somebody else will then get in power and then behave the exact same fucking way while they pat them on selves on the back saying how great they are, like white guys who did a bunch of horrific shit and then put up statues of themselves. Does that make sense? Hmm. That's an interesting point. Ooh, ouch. All right friend who smells like anus, your beard is like kind of out of control right now, don't you? She come over here like it's a little bushy, isn't it? Yeah. What's the, what's going on? What's a, what's a, what's a happen and hot stuff that's racist. Um, did, um, did dollar shave club not hook you up this morning?

Speaker 4:          00:48:38       I Dunno. I just like fucking Robinson Caruso. It was funny. I've heard that name my whole life. I don't even know who that is. Then you get stuck on an island or was he like, uh, I think so. I don't even know. Oh, we've got to look it up. No. Something from literature. It's a, it's a book. Oh, there you go. There's your quote for the week. Everybody. It's something from literature. That's what I married and made a child with. It's something from literature shipwreck. It's some white dude probably trying to explore some island. Robinson Caruso a white man. Yeah. Trying to act like he discovered some shit when people were already lived there. That's probably what it was. All right. I go with all of that. I had a big argument. Somebody bought that about what? Oh, about the whole, you can't discover some shit with people who are already there and this guy actually argue with me. He goes, well, he was discovering it for himself. And the people didn't know, but it's just like, no, he's a dog for Columbus. I forget who he was talking about. Yeah, cause fuck that guy. What did he fuck that guy? Fuck that guy. Fuck Christopher Columbus. If he didn't call me out, you, you wouldn't have met me. Wow. Really? Listen, knit. You know, to make an Omelet, you've got to break a few eggs.

Speaker 4:          00:49:54       Things that come out of your mouth. Oh fucking deal. Nia adults, listen to this. They know I'm fucking around Jesus. Fucking Christ the consult. They will take that clip and what you will see, the trouble I get in that, that's, that's a classic one for Huffington Post. Fucking Douche bags. The, we'll clip that out of it. Oh, those low hanging fruit douche bags. All right. Robinson Caruso. So cross out the way it's spelled. C R U s s e Robinson Crusoe. Everyone says Robinson Caruso, but it looks like Crusoe.

Speaker 1:          00:50:28       So cause I always think of Rick Caruso, um, first published on the 25th of April 17, 19. The first edition is Bubba plot summary. Jesus, let's get to the cliff notes. Oh God, this is too long. Crusoe

Speaker 4:          00:50:43       joins an expedition to bring slaves from Africa, but he's chick. Yeah. Who gives a fuck about this guy? But he was shipwrecked moving on in his dorm. Exactly what I thought. That's exactly what I thought. No, no, no. It was about that. Nah. Did they do a second version where that wasn't in there? Oh God, no. They make it. They make 'em out like he's some fucking hero though. Dante cannibals, discover NAO cannibals and island. Kill and eat president. Oh God. You know what? Yeah. I don't give a shit.

Speaker 1:          00:51:17       It's for his arrival there. Olin only he and three animals. The captain's dog and two cats survived the shipwreck. Overcoming his despair. He fetches arms, tools and supplies. So basically white people read this, ignore the slavery part and then root for this white guy to come home. Cause Yeah. Put themselves in that place. What did they venture?

Speaker 6:          00:51:39       Yeah.

Speaker 4:          00:51:44       How did we get on this subject of that guy? Oh, you said my beard, right? Because I said your beard. It was too much. All right. Well, the three months were the three musketeers, Robinson, Caruso. Christopher Columbus, Matt Damon White males was, it wasn't a white males that really needs to shut the fuck up. Why do they need to shut the fuck up? That's such an ignorant statement. Ignite. It isn't near. You can't want, if you tell people to shut the fuck up and then not going to listen to your point that like what you just said there is how people try and communicate in the Internet where they start things off with, hey shit, Dick, maybe if you fucking didn't have your head up your ass and they could actually be making a good point, but they started that way. If you tell people that they need to shut the fuck up and then what?

Speaker 4:          00:52:32       Listen to you, what? What sort of human being is going to be receptive to what you have to say if that's the way you're going, you're dipping into the pool. That is because I'm thinking about other things that Matt Damon has said. Other like sort of stands is that he's taken and I just feel like he is really arrogant and he's not really as worldly and understands people as well as he thinks that he does and he's in a very like small little bubble and I'm just, I'm not here. You've never met this guy. And I guarantee if you went to a Christmas party out there and he was there, you'd be like, Oh my God, Matt Damon's here.

Speaker 4:          00:53:07       Maybe a couple of years ago I would have, oh Jesus Christ. Everybody needs to just fucking just, just, just relax a little bit. This is where my problem was. Like first of all, this wasn't even about that. This wasn't even about what the fuck he said. What it was about was that that fucking person says Matt Damon, White Male, a white male. I'm just saying that's all I'm talking about. I don't give a fuck about all of that other shit. I'm trying to stay out of that shit. No you don't. But I'm trying to say why I, but that's a whole other thing having to do with project greenlight and the last season and the way he was. All right. Oh, come Dick. What are you doing? Geez. He's already getting enough fucking shit. You can throw more crap on the fire. I mean, I'm sure you want to do a movie with him Monday. No, that's not what I'm saying.

Speaker 4:          00:53:54       Hey, I'm not trying you such, you're such an asshole on this. Why did I invite you when? That's not why I'm saying that now. You made me look like a fucking asshole. Hollywood phone. Stop trying to get into bed with all these guys. I'm not, that's not the point of any of this. First of all, near he's not in, but this is the thing. This is the thing that every dumb mistake people think of, you get to know the actor. They're going to get you in the movie. They're not. They're not. That's not how that works. They're trying to keep their own fucking head above water. They don't have fucking time for you and can I play your fucking postman? They don't give a shit. All right. Jesus fucking Christ. I got to tell you any, you're killing it on this podcast cause every time I try to make a fucking point, you trash me in such a way that just destroys anything. I'm trying to say. I'm just saying, I'm just, you know, Jesus Christ. I can't look, I can't make fun of the Huffington Post and then get somebody else in trouble for some, some bullshit. They already got in trouble for that. That's what I'm saying. I'm leaving it alone. Okay. I'm leaving it alone. Fuck all right friend who smells like anus for the 90th fucking time.

Speaker 4:          00:55:14       I'll tell you, I think you're banned from this podcast. Can I read it?

Speaker 4:          00:55:20       Yeah, go ahead. You read it. Thank you. [inaudible] big fan of the podcast. My friend and I saw you and Mr. Don't forget this part. You already read that. Hey, you redheaded Mick bastard. That's offensive. Now somebody is going to take that. Someone's going to take that and cut out the part where you said that's offensive. I just wanted you on tape saying, Hey, you redheaded Mick bastard. I love it. All right. Big Fan of the podcast. My friend and I saw you and Mister [inaudible] do standup in Albany, New York. Phenomenal show. My question is about women's hygiene. Oh boy. My two buddies and I have a friend that has a very nice person and he was very preppy clothing. However, [inaudible],

Speaker 4:          00:56:03       however she smells like a bag of rotten clams. The odor has become so bad that the three of us have questioned whether wearing a guests about questioned, whether wearing a gas max around her as a person needs to write better as men. We know it is not right to tell a woman she's smells like ass, but we don't know what else to do. Should we tell her or con one of her friends and to telling her, thanks bill. Keep up the hilarious podcast and go fuck yourself. First of all, you are so unoriginal by being like she smelled like a bag of rotten clams, you know, clams. Poussey um, second of all, if you're not fucking this broad, no, you don't have anything to say next. All right. Nia got a little defensive.

Speaker 4:          00:56:52       Nick, can I ask you a question? If you walked around smelling like a bag of rotten clams, wouldn't you want somebody to give you the heads up before you became a very preppy clothing? However she smells like, what does that have to do with? And I don't, I don't get it. Oh cause she's nice and she wears nice clothes, but she smells like clams. A bag of rotten clamps, a bag of rotten clams. This sounds like an exaggeration. Give me a break. Smell so bad. The three of us have questioned whether wearing a gas. Why are you, why you matter what? Like where's the rest of your sentence? First of all, learn how to write a sentence properly. Then maybe I can hear you getting so defensive. Like they said, you smell like a bag of rotten clamps. This is this fucking thing. You just defending this person because she's a, you inserted yourself from the story and you would be the person I'm supposed to put myself in the scenario. I guess so. So now what I'm trying to do is I'm trying to help pull you out of it and say that you in no way, shape, shape, or form, smell like a bag of and clamps, um, edgy tonight. All right, fine. Okay. Uh, so what would you say, how can they tell her

Speaker 4:          00:58:04       all right, this, this, this woman. Okay. Probably wants to find love at some point and you, you're not going to, you're really limiting. You know, she's got to find somebody that works in some sort of chemical plant that's destroyed his sense of smell. So I got some sort of medical issue. Yeah. Sometimes you could have like literally a sinus infection that can give you a really bad breath. There's all kinds of stuff like,

Speaker 2:          00:58:28       um, you know,

Speaker 4:          00:58:32       and this is a thing like guys, like, it's not like I'd never ran into a woman that didn't, wasn't so fresh and so clean, you know, and I, there's no way to tell him cause it, the embarrassment of it, which they do. Singing, telegram, you smell. Um, how can they do that? I would actually, uh, I would, I would actually think that she needs, if she's dressing nice and all that type of stuff, meaning she's clean, I would say that she probably needs to see a doctor and it's probably something with their diet. I'm just, this is just shit that I've heard diet. Uh, or I don't know,

Speaker 4:          00:59:16       maybe she's stressing a lot. I have no idea. But I honestly don't know how would handle that. Well, how would you handle it? Okay. If they, it's, it's like the end of a Tom Cruise movie and you've got to clip the right fucking wire. It blows up in your face. Okay. First, first thought. I how you doing it? I think you, you're taking, you take the mouth not on like a day, but just hang out and just be like, listen, I love you so much. You are such an amazing person. You are the best. You're the best. Yeah. You breaking up with me. Um, no, no, no, no. I just feel like, you know, sometimes I just noticed like, like an odor coming from you. So I don't know. I don't know if

Speaker 7:          00:59:57       like, I don't know if like you're, you're, you're Washington

Speaker 4:          01:00:01       gene isn't working, you know? Or like why would she put a vagina and a washing machine? They're not smelling her vagina. They're smelling her be, oh, right. Well, when I heard clams, I thought the problem was in the basement accolade. Exactly. They're talking about her B o I would assume. Oh, but we could be halitosis. It could be if you're not, if you're not fucking, or like what do you, what do you care? You know, but because they liked her, they want to hang out with them, but she smells like fucking, and I'm sorry, he said a bag of clamps. I don't want to tell you. She smells like low tide there. Yeah. Maybe. Oh, maybe you're washing, your washing machine isn't working effectively or you should try a different, uh, I know what I would do. Detergent. What would you do? I get to those spray aerosol cans of like deodorant and I dress like a cowboy.

Speaker 4:          01:00:59       I walk into the bar and go heads up. And when she did it go, sorry, you got nothing. I don't know. I would try to have, uh, I w I would have, I would talk to a female friend of hers and tell her to do it because it'll be less embarrassing and just say you just given him the heads up. That's a friend. And uh, I still have this friend and we had someone that we worked with, someone who I'm actually still friends with and said a white male. Yeah. And he would talk about how my friends breath stank. And I would always like laugh because he was right. Her, her breath did stink a lot and I would always offer her gum, gum, mints. Oh, you want one? Do you want one? And she would always refuse. So it's like, what can I do? You have to sit her down and say, bitch, you state doesn't sing anymore. But at the time, because probably somebody told her. Yeah, probably. All right dad, cheating on mom. Dear Billy skank please do not say my name now. He's got a jokey name. He's got a jokey ne. Why are you such a drag? All of a sudden one fucking stinky clamp thing and no, come on man. Like nup. Yeah, sorry. Sorry everybody.

Speaker 1:          01:02:22       I should be in a bad mood the way you've been trashed me on this. I invite you on them onto my show. I already lost Sherry's berries. They're walking out of my life and then I got to listen to you trashed me. All right. I had been a fan of yours since the year 2000. I remember that.

Speaker 4:          01:02:38       How great was that bit?

Speaker 1:          01:02:42       I fucking love that bit. CONAN O'Brien show everybody. I love hearing your podcast every week. I use it as it as an escape, as an escape from my shitty life. Um, I want to ask you for your advice, but a month ago I started to notice my father would talk to a coworker who happens to be a lady. I didn't think much, much of it seeing as how he's been happily married for the past 27 years. I checked my dad's phone number, my phone the other day. He usually has me fix his phone since he doesn't understand technology. Upon checking his phone, I saw a couple of texts and a picture that they have been sending each other.

Speaker 7:          01:03:22       Oh,

Speaker 1:          01:03:24       all right. A couple of texts. I don't know what it was in the text. I don't know what the picture was. And he doesn't need to be sending pictures of themselves to another woman. Yeah. I don't know what to do. I have looked up this guy for 25 years. Oh No. Now I feel crushed. Sing. The piece of Shitty is, should I confront him and tell him to stop or else I'll tell my mother. Bill, can you please help me thank you and go fuck yourself from Adolph Stalin.

Speaker 4:          01:03:53       Ooh, just in time for Christmas.

Speaker 1:          01:03:56       Uh, what would you do?

Speaker 7:          01:04:03       Okay.

Speaker 4:          01:04:04       What would you do, Babe?

Speaker 1:          01:04:06       What would you do if you had to give your lab freedom? What will you do? Um, I dunno what I would do. I would, I would, uh,

Speaker 4:          01:04:20       just say I was the, you know, I was fixing your phone the other day and I saw this picture of this woman. Who is she? I would do it. There you go. You probably lie. Just know that he's probably going to lie to you. I mean, you can confront him and just say, hey, like what Skype was, you know, you had me fix your phone. I saw these pictures and these tax like, what's going on? He's probably going get upset. Why are you reading my tail? I didn't ask you to do that. I just asked you to get me off airplane mode or whatever the fuck it is that he, he did, you know, why are you looking right? Ron, Ron, Ron, Ron, he's probably going to get really, really upset with you and he's going to lie and he's going to deny it and then he's going to be probably overly sweet to your mom in front of you.

Speaker 4:          01:04:59       Um, I dunno, but your, um, up to this guy for 25 years now. Yeah. It's a hard thing to realize that your parents are not as perfect and great and upstanding as you thought. They were not suck. So what you think he should just go up and ask them? I mean, if it's mine, yeah, he should just say like, Hey, I just saw these pictures. Like, you know, I don't know what they were, but I thought they were maybe something inappropriate, but maybe I'm wrong and it's just been bothering me. But like I said, just maybe that will make them stop, be prepared that he is going to get very pissed at you.

Speaker 1:          01:05:36       He might not, he might be fucking embarrassed. I don't know.

Speaker 4:          01:05:40       And it's, it's probably gonna make him be really upset and yell at him. So, but I feel bad for your mom. That's the thing. But who knows? Maybe your parents have an arrangement that you don't know.

Speaker 1:          01:05:51       Uh, oh

Speaker 4:          01:05:52       Jesus. I don't know. You got to consider all the possibilities here, you know? But unless his mom's at home, just baking cookies and making dinner every night, you know, and being like, oh, she's just nagging him every night. You just get sick of it. Maybe she's banging in the mail, man. Hey, you know, can we have a little sympathy for the guy

Speaker 1:          01:06:08       fucking wrote in here? Jesus Christ. I would go with her first advice. All right. Over. Okay. Overrated. Underrated. It's back. All right. Overrated. Outdoor hockey games. I've been twice one in Comerica Park in Detroit and another at the big house. It's cold. You can't see the whole ice and it's hard to track the puck. Not to mention the blinding glare from the sun. Do yourself a favor. Save your money and watch it at home. Wow. Um, underrated homemade French fries. Huh? Uh, if you're hosting a barbecue or just making burgers for the family, take the time and make some hand cut fries at the beginning of one of your advertisers. Double Fry them and toss and sea salt. [inaudible] if you're feeling really ambitious, a homemade spicy ketchup, we'll put it over the top. Wow. Nice. Your grand rapid show at the church was great. Can't wait to hear it. Those jokes again. And your next special. I love that fucking, that's such a great gig. Um, all right. Uh, advice

Speaker 8:          01:07:14       lady.

Speaker 1:          01:07:16       Is this the last one? It's a long, it's a long one. Brace yourselves. Bill's going to be reading for a while. 22 year old. Married to a 47 year old. Oh boy. Bad idea. I'm calling it right now, but go ahead. All right. I had been putting off email you this because I feel pretty embarrassed, but I adore your podcasts, your honest advice and I have massive, massive respect for you. So fuck it. Uh, if you do actually read this and take the time to respond and thank you so much. I Dunno why, but I actually love when somebody uses the word adore. I adore your podcasts. It seems so much more sincere than I love your podcast. But now that I put that out there, everyone's going to make fun of me and say how much they adore a, I should probably start by saying that I was in a really bad spot when I first met my guy.

Speaker 1:          01:08:09       I was 20 and he was 45. I lost my mom when I was 17 of lung cancer. And then I lost the mother figure who had taken me in and I had stayed with for two years again to lug cancer. Jesus Christ. I never knew my dad. Oh, you knew that was coming. So I know there's some daddy issues in to play here probably. But anyways, I felt like a giant curse to of my family members became ill and I was falling behind. In my degree. The only happiness I had was going to concerts, getting high and trying to forget my grief in the music. Yeah, that sounds like what I would've done. That wasn't until I met my guy at one of the shows and everything started changing for the better. He had the most amazing, confident, positive energy I had ever seen and I felt so unbelievably happy just by being around him.

Speaker 1:          01:09:03       We started dating. I fell in love hard and fast forward nine months later we got married in a Vegas in Vegas on a trip visiting his family as he's American. I was drunk. The marriage is not registered in the UK and my family still doesn't know. Please don't judge me. I would never judge you. I'm a fucking mess. Everything is mostly wonderful between us and we have lived together for a year now. He's a roadie and will typically spend a couple of months touring and then three months at home in that cycle he is 100% trustworthy. I liked that dynamic we have, because I get my own time to focus on my freelance work. But the time of park keeps the love fresh and exciting, especially as we travel a lot when he is off to work, uh, before, before the baby. Right. Uh, but he wants to start breeding within a couple of years and whilst he is someone I would start a family with, I know I'm not ready for anything like that.

Speaker 1:          01:10:00       We've spoken about this and he said he would wait a few years, but I still know I'm not going to be ready in a few years. I still feel like a lost teenager most of the time. I know what the responsibility, so I know what the responsible thing to do is, which is to end it. But he's been, the reason the last couple of years in my life had been so much brighter and happier than they have in so long. He's great in bed. Super thoughtful and generous. No, it isn't a sugar daddy thing, but it's nice having someone wants to look after you. I just don't know what to do at all. I really don't want to lose him, but he's 47 now and once kids as soon as possible. I don't want to be a cunt and knowingly waste his time. I do have a good Chase's. Okay. Two more paragraphs.

Speaker 1:          01:10:41       I do have a good circle of friends that I'll be absolutely fine alone slash. Single, but I just don't want to regret throwing away a good relationship over this. Ps, I'm so glad you liked Manchester. We loved you here. I fucking loved going to Manchester. I had a great time and I would love to go to Liverpool and new and a new castle. I would like to do more of those cities up there a next time I come over. We'd love to meet you and the beautiful Nia in England one day just so I can shake the hand and thank you in person for making a post uni existential crisis so much more bearable. I don't even know what that means. Huh? Stay shiny and

Speaker 4:          01:11:14       go fuck yourself. Um, all right. Look, you've been through a lot of shit. Okay. And you married this guy nine months in. It's not what what he wants is not what you want and here's the deal. Okay. As much as you're going to feel like you're an asshole for doing this to this guy. What kind of a fucking 45 year old guy marries a 20 year old boy. He's 47 now and she's 22 yeah, but w and last, the like knock her up right away and all that other kind of stuff. Yeah. I mean he, yeah. How do you not know that that's coming? Yeah. I mean, she didn't, she's young. You know what I'm saying? How does he know that this isn't coming? Oh, I don't know. I mean, I just feel like he is like on, you know, the middle and age. He's a middle age and so he's freaking is not middle aged.

Speaker 4:          01:11:58       He's over the hill. I'm so sick of people saying 47 why isn't that Middle Age 47 times to come on artists? What is it? Um, 94 yeah. How many people make it the 94 not a lot. Like 94 people make it to 94. Yeah, like 35 is middle aged 35 times two is 70. You have to be, um, you'd have to be true to yourself. You're so young, you don't want to have kids now because yeah, your life is going to change Jurassic Lee and you haven't had a chance to even fully, you know, experience everything that you want to experience your, your, your weights. A young people of course have kids at your age, but you're so young, so you know, you should just be honest with him about it and you know, I'll wait a couple of can't have kids. You don't know if you don't know who you are or what the fuck you're doing.

Speaker 4:          01:12:48       You can't have kids. And honestly, it's not your fault that he waited this long to, you know, be in a relationship and have kids like, and sometimes you have to be selfish to get what you want. Okay. That's it. Okay. You're being, you're being a good know. She just takes off now. He's still 47. You can meet a fucking 31 year old. Yeah. That's who he needs to meet. A chick in her thirties who's just sweating it out going, what the fuck I need a baby DiMauro. I need to trap a man. That's, that's what he's, it's not your fault. He's drafting this late in life. He's drafted in the later rounds. That's what's left. You know that, you know the trap car. Know what he's talking about. He's, he's going to, he's going to date these going to date, the female version of that.

Speaker 4:          01:13:37       They got this fucking thing out there called the trap car. Speaking of racist. They drive it in what? They drive this car, a nice car. They leave it running with the keys on and they, but they only do it in like non white neighborhoods. Yeah. It's such bullshit. Bullshit. Um, but anyway, don't, um, don't have a, maybe just to keep this guy because you will end up, you'll love your baby and you'll end up hating him, but you'll resent your baby cause she didn't get to go to fucking Joshua tree and eat mushrooms and do whatever the fuck he supposed to do in your early twenties. Whatever. What our kids do now in their early twenties. Yeah. You guys are really at completely different stages in your life. And this is why, you know, unfortunately it's not advisable to marry someone who could literally be your father. So Nia with another cold bucket of water.

Speaker 4:          01:14:32       I liked this. I liked this Rainer. She is sweet and you know, I don't know. It sucks. You know what I mean? She sounds like she's genuinely in love with him and it doesn't want to break up, but this is a pretty big issue. This isn't a little thing. So He's, by the time you're ready, he's going to be dead. And I'm just kidding. Um, he's going to be, you know, even older. So it was just, yeah, I dunno. Yeah. Or you could like adapt a Twat. I told you so. But you had to say, I feel like you're all you over selling it. No, I'm done. I'm quiet. Did a great job in the podcast media people feel like it was going to love and you trashed me two times. You gave me like the trashing of the year twice on one fucking podcast. That's cool. I can live with that.

Speaker 4:          01:15:25       I always know when there's something going on with you. I always know there's something going on with you. I don't know what the fuck it is when you do that, because I'm always right because I'm always right. Knee and leg, man. It was going on with you. I'm fine. You're not. You're a, you're a fucking mess. You're, you're freaking out about the holidays. I know. You are. All right. That's it. That's a podcast. That's the podcast. Ladies and gentleman, that is the podcast. Bill Burr, a white male signing off with Nia. Nia Hill, a black female. Alright. Have a great couple of days. Uh, I'll check in on. How about them apples? Perfect. You're crushing it. All right, I'll see you.
