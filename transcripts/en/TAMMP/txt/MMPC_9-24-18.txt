Speaker 1:          00:00:02       Hey, what's going on is Bill Byrd is time for the Monday morning podcast from Monday. Uh, what is it? September 24th, 2018 what's going on? How are Ya? Just realize my flies down. Am I at that age now? 50 years old and be that guy walking around doesn't even always flies down here. Where are my glasses? I still haven't fixed this. All I do is just bitch about this wire rather than going out and getting it fixed. Why would you do that bill? All right. I just flew back from Charleston, South Carolina for that house in Richmond. 40,000. Not Norfolk, Norfolk, Virginia. I was down in the fucking, saf had a great time. He had a god damn great time. I got to tell you some Richmond, Virginia, the Altria Theater, uh, top five, top five theaters in America I've ever played. That there was the, I dunno, I dunno what it was. The whole layout of it. That dome above how great the sound was. The crowd was amazing. It was incredible. You know, I know what she's all, what about us? And Norfolk. I had great time there too. Great crowds the whole fucking time. Great people. They didn't lose their houses because of the hurricane. I haven't been to fucking North Carolina yet. You know, I was so relieved and when I got to Charleston because they said that thing was going to hit him dead center,

Speaker 1:          00:01:33       you know, and uh, I was like, want to, so what am I going to show up? Everybody lost their house. I'm going to come down there being like, oh, what's up with this fucking wire on my party? Like a ditch and about that. People just lost their house. I didn't want that. I was so relieved, so relieved that I didn't have to go to design. Don't ever send me to a disaster area. I am much better hundreds, if not thousands of miles away doing a benefit where the money is then sent to that area. You get me in the area, my act, my act as not work.

Speaker 2:          00:02:07       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:02:07       When people are knee deep in water in their living room, it just doesn't, okay. I've tried. It doesn't work and it's just, you know, it's just not a good thing. But you know, it's, you know, there's other comics for that. It's a great big, beautiful fucking world, a comedy. Um, anyways, I flew back today and, uh, guess who was sitting next to me on the plane, Frankie Valli. I couldn't believe it. I was freaking out sky and you know, I, I didn't bug him. He was literally right next to me and his whole vibe was he didn't want to be bugged. So I did not fucking, I didn't say one fucking word to him other than excuse me, cause I had the window, you know, and uh, the guys like 84 years old, you should have seen him popping up out of his seat, the end of the flight to grab his bag. You know, are we expecting someone to bug him? And, uh, incredible shape kept himself in like I eat fucking ways. The exact same you way back when he was singing all those songs, it's very inspiring.

Speaker 3:          00:03:13       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:03:15       Actually when I looked him up, one of the questions that people ask what you know, all like all the top questions. One was how did Frankie Valli die? You know, that's when you know you crushed it in life.

Speaker 2:          00:03:29       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:03:30       You've been living so long. People just assume that you're dead. I don't know. I was pretty impressed by that. I hope I live that long. When did bill burr die? Uh, he's still alive. You can go see him down at the fucking Hooky Lao and chickopee Massachusetts.

Speaker 3:          00:03:46       MMM.

Speaker 3:          00:04:31       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:04:33       So if you see him, you know, fucking lean Multnomah Salem street. It was, it was his mood. Today I'm talking like I know the guy I did set next sit next to him for like fucking three hours when we were done, if I just started singing his fucking stuff, I was, you know, I just put on my fucking headphones. They just started singing his shit song. She Sung like 9 million fucking times. Then he has to hear him. Disgustingly attitude.

Speaker 2:          00:05:00       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:05:00       Probably would elbowed me. Hey Kid, shut up. I did it better. Something, you know, some cool something that are called gay would say, man, I hope I'm in the shape. He's, I hope I live that long and I hope I'm in the shape he's in. He looks fucking great and uh,

Speaker 1:          00:05:23       Was how the New England patriots got their asses. Why Bunch of Goddamn nerds, oh, this happens every September. Every September we start off slow and then everybody has this dead and buried. It's fucking over every setting. The new tradition in the AFC is in September, the Patriots are done and Kansas City's going to the super bowl. How many times have we seen it? Well, it's only the second year in a row. Well, it feels like five.

Speaker 2:          00:06:01       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:06:02       Kansas City, it's over. It's a gift. Wrap it up in a fucking bow. Right? Fucking unbelievable fucking Versie man. For as he jinxed me, he fucking tease the Patriots. I didn't even give him shit. That's the second week in a row that he's lost on the lions as he calls him. The hapless lions. Fucking unbelievable. Not as unbelievable as this God damn fucking wire. Oh, did I move my head? Oh, is this a comfortable position? And now go fuck yourself. Um,

Speaker 2:          00:06:37       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:06:38       I was actually doing, I did two shows last night. My wife taped the game so I haven't even seen it, but I was watching the ticker on my phone cause I don't know how you guys, you fucking download the app and then you gotta have your pen. How do you keep all your passwords? Well, how do you keep, how do you keep track of them?

Speaker 2:          00:06:56       You know,

Speaker 1:          00:06:59       unless you just don't give a fuck and you just use the same one every God damn time.

Speaker 2:          00:07:04       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:07:04       I'm a, I'm not even good at coming up with passwords. Like when I go to type it in that the computer's like week, Eh, that's getting better. And I'm like, I'm like fucking Zebra [inaudible] 98 they're like fair. It's like how the fuck is, somebody's going to figure that out.

Speaker 2:          00:07:23       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:07:24       Anyways. Um,

Speaker 2:          00:07:30       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:07:30       Balloon Herbie 49 week like this to somebody already have that. I have no idea. But let me ask you this. When was the last fucking time he is a God damn stats, Foy stats or stat? He's a fucking stat for you. When was the question? I have, when was the last time? The browns, the lions and the buffalo bills. All one in the same week. Jesus Christ. I mean, you're talking the browns in the lions have both gone. Oh, and 16 in this decade, right? Was it this decade under the years of flying by 32 fucking losses.

Speaker 1:          00:08:14       You know, they always do that when they talk about the national debt and they tried to put it in terms that you can understand. I'm going to put 32 losses in terms that you can understand. Lost, lost, lost, lost, lost, lost, lost, lost, lost, lost. I'm going to fucking do times three plus two. Lost, lost a lot of fucking losses. Um, somebody's going to use that as a rink. Film loss loft. Sorry. Anyways, um, it's weird. My team is one and two. We actually have a worse record right now than the Cleveland browns. Having said that, it's kind of fucking fun seeing these teams that have sucked so long be good. I want, does anybody out there call a buffalo bills? This maybe a bad on it, but who the fuck? Who the fuck saw 27? Nothing.

Speaker 5:          00:09:03       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:09:03       Whatever the fuck they were up by 17. Nothing against the fucking bite. What a viking stove. The vikings putting their fans out of, out of their misery early this year. They usually wait till the playoffs. Playoffs.

Speaker 5:          00:09:16       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:09:16       Um, I watched a bunch of football this weekend. I watched, I watched Alabama roll tat. I watched them against the Aggies. Love the Aggies quarterback. Man, that guy's a fucking game. He kept a minute for like a hat almost to the half, but uh, I swear to God, watching, watching the, uh,

Speaker 1:          00:09:34       Alabama crimson tide, it's like watching the patriots where the players are so well coached. Like the way they turned it on at the end of the first half to be like, hey, let's get another touchdown here and let's buy whatever the hell they were by. Like I think, I can't remember, maybe seven. Let's go in the locker room up by four. They put the foot on the gas and then went right down the fucking field and they scored. Aggies come out, they shut them down again. They got the ball back and then they kicked a field goal. They tacked on an extra fucking 10 points and it was like, wait a minute, wait, we, we were down by one score. We've done by a touchdown like three minutes ago. We're ready to jargon, you know, feeling good about ourselves. And all of a sudden they give him the whole fucking right there, Fred twice.

Speaker 1:          00:10:18       And then the, uh, Alabama was getting the ball coming out of halftime and you liked it. They're going to go down, they're going to score another touchdown. It's fucking game is over. That's essentially what they did. And the fact that, uh, Nick Saban, I always go to forget his name and I just remember that chant when I went to the Lsu game and the whole student section was going, fuck you save. So I always have to say that once in my head, I have to picture of that memory and then the audio plays. Fuck you save. And I called Nick, Nick Saban, Nick Saban.

Speaker 5:          00:10:53       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:10:54       The job that that guys doing down there, considering, you know, all the players that you lose every year, everybody thinks they're a pro or they're just a senior and they can't play any more and you're just constantly rebuilding the fact that they, that whatever the hell he instills in them, they get it immediately. Um, you know, it was pretty impressive. I miss the Lsu game. Fucking college football is like the Games don't like on, they'd like random games on like Tuesdays now it seems so on Friday. I think I missed that. But they're three. No, I think we got Florida next week. I did say we, I'm in, I'm in with fucking Lsu. I, I, you know, can't, can't root for Alabama. They just took God damn good. Right. I'm not looking forward to that Alabama game. That's going to be rough. But who knows? Maybe dead fucking Cajun Hulk Hogan can talk them into s I dunno. I Dunno. You know what? That'd be fun. I got to watch Alabama every week cause I never watched when they lose. How angry does nick say? I actually worry for his loved ones when that guy's taking a loss.

Speaker 5:          00:12:04       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:12:05       Like that poor Alabama kicker. We fucking Shank two punts. The fucking look on Nick Saban's face. Oh my God. It was like he wanted to rip the kids fucking foot off. Um, anyways, I hate fucking podcasting when I flew across the country fly. I don't know what it is. All my funny just goes out the window, but brain isn't working fucking sitting here. Jesus Christ. Um, so how was I going to talk about, I, I absolutely nothing to fucking talk about. How many minutes of, I'm 12 minutes in 12 fucking minutes and I got one for you. You know somebody come home, right? All I want to do is jump in the shower and just wash the fucking airport off of me. All right? Can't do it. Cause I own an old house and we got a plumber in here for the 9 million time trying to fix whatever the fuck is wrong with the, the toilet this time.

Speaker 1:          00:13:01       Can't do it. I swear to God, give you guys some advice. If you ever fucking, somebody ever describes a house has having character, I'm telling you, just head for the hills. All right? If you meet a woman and she says, guys find me intimidating. Just run for the hills. Does it? There's a couple of fucking red flags out there. Um, ladies, what are we? And tell me what, what is it so I can help out women here? What, what's the, uh, what's the red flag with a guy you don't know him and he says drink lists something creepy. I don't fucking know. Um, anyways, the red sox clinched that was all exciting until the Yankees clinched and it's just like, oh, so are both zero and zero. Like what am I getting excited about? Why is everybody popping fucking champagne and all that? The Indians won the series. I think they took two out of three from us. I'm telling you, Terry Francona is laying in the weeds and nobody sees this guy.

Speaker 5:          00:14:07       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:14:07       People, how many times do I have to be right? I, I'm, I'm, I'm going to pat myself on the back right now. I had been killing it lately. I said it wasn't fucking open when we swept the Yankees. I was right. I said, you can't base the lines first fucking week or what they're gonna do or anybody. I was right about that. All right. I was worried about two things, but that feels great to me. Felt like I've been right about a lot of shit. You know, this is what happens when you get married. You know what I mean? When you actually write about something, you just, you want to tell people. So there's maybe somebody will give you a fucking had a boy every once in a while. Um, anyways, I, uh, what else? What I want to fucking absolutely. Literally nothing. Charleston football. Oh yeah, yeah. There's another isn't a fucking sign of global warming. Isn't it amazing how like sports, like they, they don't give a fuck. They'll talk about war, they'll promote a war and all that shit. But for some reason, global warming or climate change, whatever that is, just completely off limits. I have never seen, I never saw a football game called or delayed because of weather. The first, like, I dunno, 45 years of my life, 40 years of my life, and now it's like every other fucking week.

Speaker 1:          00:15:27       Like the weather is too bad to play football, which you play no matter what the weather is. So either somebody sued the shit out of a stadium because they just got a perm and it started to rain and a football game or we're just getting crazier and crazier whether you know it's gonna happen eventually, you know, because we keep saving all of these people. When Mother Nature tries to wipe him off the planet, we fucking let everybody know something is going to happen. Get out of the fucking way. So she's just going to have to start swinging harder and harder and harder. And it's going to be one of these fucking times. There's going to be a tornado that sets down like write in a stadium and everybody's just going to go flying like they went through like a, like a, a wood chipper. Um, you know something. If that fucking guy, what the hell's his name there? I always forget his name. That guy, the guy he had als. He was really smart and he was always predicted negative shit. I wish he was alive so I can ask him that. Is it Steve or something like that? Mike and one have regular names.

Speaker 1:          00:16:45       Hey Tim. Billy.

Speaker 5:          00:16:48       Okay,

Speaker 1:          00:16:49       Kevin. Kevin's a little, it's a little bad for white people. That's a little flavor in your name back in the day anyways. Um, I would ask them to, hey dude, you know, not for nothing. What, when, what year?

Speaker 5:          00:17:03       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:17:03       He was like, he was like one of those fucking, you know when you go to like Coney island or something and you get like the bearded lady and then there's a guy guessing your weight. He was like the guy that guests you wait before, like super smart people. He was always saying all that crazy shit, you know?

Speaker 5:          00:17:17       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:17:17       And 20, 38 there's gonna be no more apples. You know, he just, he added down the polar ice caps are going to fucking, you know, just fucking gloom and doom that guy had, you know, you guys think I'm bad. That fucking guy, Jesus Christ. I would have loved to ask them and been like, hey Ricky, when is a tornado going to fucking set down?

Speaker 5:          00:17:43       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:17:43       In a fucking football stadium that we don't even see coming. He could actually probably within the fucking week. Well, actually, wait a minute. What did that guy ever predicted came true and I gotta be honest with a lot of his predictions, they were pretty fucking obvious. It's kind of was saying, yeah, we're going to fuck this whole thing up, which is kind of the direction we're going in. But you know what your day to day

Speaker 1:          00:18:08       you gotta take like little, like happy things that happen. Like seeing the lions, the bills and the browns all win. You know, bills, fans a conch. I've been to two games out there. They're fucking grumpy cunt. You know what I mean? They'll like the south. They never got over the loss, you know, I'm fucking with you. Um, they never got over those Superbowl losses. They're just like, it's, it's fucking with them. It hangs over that city. It's a great city. They're great people. But I'm telling you, do they put on a bill shirt? I know the feeling, believe it or not, back in the day I see it too. Like whenever the red sox were that the throwbacks with the pad patriot, I get up my, me and my older brother, we get sick to our stomach.

Speaker 5:          00:19:04       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:19:05       When you look at it, he's like, oh my God, I don't mind if they ever, what they wearing with the black cleats then it kind of looks like the original days of the AFL. I don't mind that. But if they go out there with white fucking cleats and they wear that fucking Pat Patriot thing, that's all I think about. All I think about roughing the passer fucking the 46 defense. Dan Marino, lightness up the buffalo bills where they had Jim Kelly kicking the shit out of us. Uh, there was a minute there with the jets were good.

Speaker 5:          00:19:39       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:19:40       When they had the New York sack exchange, this can't all be football every week I get people around the world listening to this shit and they just don't give a fuck. So I got up at some point, switch off to something that's going to be a little bit, a little more mainstream.

Speaker 5:          00:19:55       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:19:55       You know, I, oh, I also watched the, sorry, I'll look there was watch football. I watch the fucking Falcon Saints. Um, I dunno what the fuck is going on in the NFC south, but that take the over. None of those teams are going to win. Shit. Did you see those two fucking guys and like their twenties couldn't track, couldn't tackle 39 year old drew Brees.

Speaker 5:          00:20:19       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:20:20       I was, that was fucking ridiculous that if that was a boxing match you'd say was fixed. Um, but today, right now I don't know what Matt Ryan's Diet is, but I want to be on it.

Speaker 5:          00:20:32       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:20:33       That guy, he's gotta be like in his thirties now. He doesn't get his fucking face is all taking it looks like an astronaut. Yeah, those guys always have nice faces cause they spent so many years out there in the fucking space and is like no gravity.

Speaker 5:          00:20:47       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:20:48       That's going to be like the next thing that rich people do is everybody else gets poor. They're gonna, they're gonna just orbit the earth. It's really good for your face. It is going to be up there just flying around. We're like no gravity.

Speaker 5:          00:21:07       You know,

Speaker 1:          00:21:10       if you're rich you get botox. But if you're super rich, you orbit the planet and you very young, you know, want wanted to do that. Wanted to go to like Mars or something. Didn't lance bass want to do that shit? The fucking people out of their mind. Don't you know? You don't remember when that teacher went up.

Speaker 5:          00:21:29       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:21:30       Then you remember like how much balls it takes to be a fucking astronaut. You getting on top of a stick of dynamite, Yadda. Your fucking mind.

Speaker 5:          00:21:41       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:21:42       That's like chuck Yeager. Shit. Some fucking guy in a toll booth yell get in that thing. Oh will you? I think it's almost like, yeah, it's like it's disrespectful to the other fucking people you know. Did they, did they put you in that centrifuge and shit before you go on there to make sure you're not going to be yacking all the way to the fucking moon? Could you imagine that? The first, you know the first one? The first one,

Speaker 5:          00:22:08       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:22:09       Okay. That they send up there with a bunch of civilians. There is going to be, somebody is going to freak the fuck out and I guarantee you they are going to, they're going to, they're going to have something, some soda, some guy just runs down the island and just like puts a syringe. Right. Do Your fucking neck so you don't freak everybody else out when it finally hits you that you're leaving the planet.

Speaker 5:          00:22:36       Like God,

Speaker 1:          00:22:40       there is so many things that scares the shit out of me.

Speaker 5:          00:22:44       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:22:45       But I got to admit when George Clooney just spun off into space and that fucking movie, whatever the hell it was, but he was so nonchalant about it, like I didn't care about his character and he's just like, Oh yeah, look at that. There's a Serengeti. Oh he's like at this time of year and he just floated off. They made them to heroic. All right. Cause I don't give a fuck. You know how much balls you have as an astronaut and you do you have balls the size of my fucking head, which is huge. If you don't know who I am. Um, did you never taking a gander at it? Um, I don't give a fuck who you are. You start slipping off into fucking space. I don't care how fucking bad ass you are. It is the second you lose your grip on the space station and you start floating off and the other people in there asleep or some shit and you're just, that's it. You're done.

Speaker 5:          00:23:36       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:23:36       There's no way you just go like, well you know I had a nice run. I guess I'm going to set the record rebated space. You know you're not going to say that

Speaker 6:          00:23:46       it is going to be at the line.

Speaker 1:          00:23:52       It just fucking gone. That is a fucking lonely ass God damn death. Could I be saying more obvious shit? Oh is it bill to slip off into the fucking space by yourself? Now what happens when you're up there? Cause I know like some fucking egg head figured out.

Speaker 2:          00:24:21       Okay,

Speaker 1:          00:24:21       why can I compliment them? You know some guy who's way smarter than I am somehow figured out that when you went to space,

Speaker 2:          00:24:29       yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:24:29       because you are outside of the atmosphere. The Sun's rays would be so god damn hot.

Speaker 2:          00:24:35       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:24:36       Your saliva would reach the boiling point in your fucking mouth. I remember that red bull guy when he jumped, that was a problem, like of his mass came off within, I don't know how many seconds, like his, his, he would lend, it would go from like,

Speaker 2:          00:24:51       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:24:52       Hurdling through the atmosphere with boiling water in your mouth.

Speaker 2:          00:24:57       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:24:58       I mean, you might as well get shot right directly up your asshole with lightening at that point that they just make the Trifecta of horror.

Speaker 2:          00:25:05       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:25:08       Hey, remember the hole in the ozone layer? How come they never fucking talk about that anymore? Is that thing going? Do they fix it? Oh my God. I actually came up with an idea for a fucking movie that I think you could make a trilogy out of.

Speaker 2:          00:25:31       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:25:32       And it's so ridiculous. I'm actually, rather than just saying it or doing a fucking bit about it, I actually just registered it, registered it at the fucking writers' guild on the way from the airport.

Speaker 2:          00:25:46       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:25:48       Popped in there really quick. It just fucking knocked it out.

Speaker 2:          00:25:52       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:25:53       It's so like coming up with this Scifi movie right now. For some reason it's just really easy because I feel like we're, we're, we're there,

Speaker 2:          00:26:03       you know,

Speaker 1:          00:26:04       just all the shit that's fucking coming out. All this shit that we're fucking up.

Speaker 1:          00:26:11       60 years ago you had to use your imagination, you know ray guns and fucking pocket doors that opened up what the Hedy, your fucking body, whatever happened on Star Trek, right.

Speaker 2:          00:26:22       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:38:18       Now evidently we go into the, uh, we go into the questions here for the week, for the week. Moto GP. Hey Bill, I haven't heard you talk about the guy in the moto g a moto race. Who gripped the other guy? Other racers breaks in the middle of the race. How the fuck did he do that? Maybe I had my headphones out while some shit head I work with felt it necessary to tell me about his weekend. I don't give a shit about, but would love to hear your thoughts on the incident. I gotta I gotta check this out. Here we go. Let's search here. Modot modot modot fucking GP Moto GP breaks. Oh, break grab. There it is.

Speaker 1:          00:39:04       Let's see what we got. You know what I was just sitting there. Do you remember Super Fuzz, that movie? And then they were in the transition between one seat to another. They had the, the background singers. They go super, super, super, super, super. Um, all right. Yeah. Did this guy get banned for life? You could fucking kill somebody doing that. The caption literally says, the guy's going like, he wanted to kill me. All right. I have to sit through a fucking ad. Oh, and of course here we go. Your ad will play. Your video will play after this ad. Remember the Internet when it didn't have a bunch of ads, you know, that was a great fucking time. Now they just, they just punish you. I mean, it's not as bad as listening to me read ads and you always have the option of fast 40 through mine. He's fucking assholes. While let me do it. Come on. I want to see it.

Speaker 1:          00:39:56       I want to see it. All right. This is gonna take too long, unfortunately. But this fucking guy grabbed onto was, I don't want your fucking channels. Fuck we meet alone. You don't know he's a fuck. I mean, when you're on the plane and the, and the and the, they shut off your movie to do a God damn commercial, but some who the fuck is going to sign up for a credit card? 60,000 free air miles. That's enough to get you from here to Chile and Bagley. Say all this dumb shit. It's like, yeah, but you're not going to let me do it. So what's the difference? Right? I'll only be able to use these during like the winter months. You'll let me fly to fucking Alaska. What is pitch black out? All right. Evidently there's can't grab this guy's fucking breaks. What happened? I don't want to blame the victim, but what in God's name did this guy do? Moto GP. Grape break grab. I just have to, let me just read about it here.

Speaker 2:          00:40:59       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:40:59       Moto GP rider grabs competitors break at 140 miles an hour. This guy should be arrested. How the fuck did he think that no one was going to see this? Does he realize it's televised? Oh my God. What a fucking asshole.

Speaker 1:          00:41:23       That's like right out of Wrestlemania and the ref didn't see it. Holy Shit. That guy's an amazing writer. W that was his front brake to, well I guess they always use the front brake. It's a back. You don't want to use, I don't know shit about motorcycles. All right. This grace mode to rider Romano for naughty, all the Italian. Ah, Jesus. Then you know, at this finally, no mob shows on TV. They would turn in their fucking reputation around and this guy's, he's got to go full soprano on him. The guy deservedly lost his spot on the Marinelli snipers team. All they kicked him off the team after he attempt to one of the more dangerous stunts we'll see in competitive racing. Ah, man, he's 22 years old. He's a fucking hothead. He just ruined his career. Uh, boy has fun. Any road beside competitors to Farnum Monsey.

Speaker 1:          00:42:18       I wonder if there's any history between these two families. You never, no kidding. At the San Marino GP. The 22 year old reached out and grab man sees break at 140 miles an hour. Luckily man's, he didn't fall off his bike and Finetti's is it fanatics antiques were completely called for. That's one of the worst sentences. Luckily Mansi didn't fall off his bike. Oh, as for Nannies, antiques were completely uncalled for. Phonetic was shown the black flag and disqualified from the race for attempting to harm an opponent. While he was banned for two races and fired from his team fanatic, he thought the penalty was unfair. Still, he added that he had no plans to race again. What

Speaker 3:          00:43:09       wow,

Speaker 1:          00:43:11       the world is. That world is close to me. I'll not race any more. He said an interview he granted to the Lara Publica. It isn't my world. There is. There's too much injustice. I was wrong. That is true, but nobody cares about my pain. I was in a real man. I was unable to control my anger, but Mansi could have killed me too. Well, what happened before that? Dude, I'm telling you, this is why you have to get into racing. I, it's like the real housewives for men. These fucking guys like how mad they fucking get at each other in the petty shit. That's not really petty. But like days of thunder, all of that, you watch that movie, you like Alice again, this is fucking silly. Like that shit really goes down.

Speaker 2:          00:43:57       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:43:58       I guess it's better than a car cause she could fucking slam into people. It's, you know, for some reason that's not considered attempted murder.

Speaker 3:          00:44:05       MMM. Wow.

Speaker 1:          00:44:09       I guess maybe because I have a temper, I feel bad for that guy or also maybe because I went after a dream and made it come true and that kid did too, and he just fucked up his dream. I actually on some level feel bad for him,

Speaker 3:          00:44:22       uh,

Speaker 1:          00:44:24       that he's, maybe he was just emotional after the fucking race and just said, I'm done. You know?

Speaker 3:          00:44:30       Uh,

Speaker 1:          00:44:32       I hope it just wasn't cause he just couldn't beat the guy. The guy was always getting the best of them. You know, many, we pulled like a bill. Laimbeer you're like those players whatsoever while you're better than me, so I'm just going to wait till you leave your feet and I'm just gonna take your fucking legs out. That's still on my favorite things of all time, Bill and beer saying we tried to play a mind game. It's like, you know, like, like there was a lot of layers to that. It's like, no, you're just out there hurting people. Um, all right. Football and pizza. Oh my God. Oh Jesus Christ. This is one of the best ones ever. Hey Yo, Billy colorless calves. There's never been a truer statement. My legs, I swear to you, they, they, they are the color of milk. Um, I'm happy you're enjoying getting in shape. Most people don't get past the first week of eating, uh, eating well and a, and it's a shame because it, all it takes is one good week of clean food and breaking a sweat. Well, not if you like a hundred pounds overweight, but I know what you mean. He said, I started doing long distance biking in my twenties. You know what's hilarious? I just had my bike fixed up. I bought a bike in 1983 that I still have, I bought a 12 speed with my paper route money. Um,

Speaker 2:          00:45:50       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:45:50       I was 15 years old.

Speaker 2:          00:45:53       Yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:45:53       and I, I quit the my paper route the year before, I think. I don't think, no, I don't think I did. I went from having a paper route to have a part time job. I do remember that I had a paper from third grade to ninth grade and then I had to sign a form or something because I was too young to work on. No. Then I started caddying. I was a caddy for awhile. Did that feel like a fucking year or something? Then I just started. I always had a job. It was great. I always had money. The worst fucking thing in the world now is that little boys and girls, they can't be taking, they can't be paper boys and girls anymore. It was the fucking best. He didn't have to hit your parents up from, I just, I had fucking money. Do you understand that?

Speaker 2:          00:46:45       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:46:45       I was making like eight, nine, 10 bucks a week when I was in third grade.

Speaker 2:          00:46:51       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:46:51       I mean I was stuffing it in the walls. I had like no overhead. I mean I went the fuck was I going to spend it on football cards. That's what I spent it on. And I had a little bank and I just stuffed it in there and uh, anytime I wanted something, if I, if I wanted to, uh, I used to like, I had a job and I was so young. Then when I had a job I would buy toys with it. I Buy Football Cards and candy, soda and all that Shit. I just was fucking great.

Speaker 1:          00:47:27       Or one time I rode my bike all the way to fucking Mcdonald's with a buddy of mine. We both lied to our parents. We were riding down a fucking two lane highway. Nobody reported us cause there was no phones, you know, we drove all the way down there and when didn't, it was the coolest fucking thing I've been at. Parents had no fucking idea. I was exhausted because it was one town over and I just had this little piece of shit read coaster bike. Um, and then when I got older I, I then I, I had, uh, I had the Raleigh Beach Rambler. I remember I pointed the bike as I thought it looked fucking stupid because they had white wall tires on it. And I pointed on it and laughed and my dad was like, oh, I liked that you liked that? And I was afraid of him, so I just said, yeah, but this bike I didn't like and that everybody made fun of me at these giant peewee Herman fucking tires on it. But then one day, you know, we ride down the hill and everyone was slamming on the brakes. Like that's what you did for fun to see it look sort of skid mark, you could leave. The tires was so fucking big. Everybody else's just went like that. When my skin, it actually sounded like a car. I went yep.

Speaker 1:          00:48:37       And everybody thought it was cool, but it had the big fat ass fucking seed on it. Um, but I had a paper route and it's fucking snowed out and, you know, rain, sleet or snow, you had to look, deliver the paper. And Mine, uh, delivered the Herald and then I delivered the Boston Globe. And, uh, I remember the kid down the street, he had the, he had the coveted route. There was used to be this paper called the Patriot ledger and it was an afternoon paper that makes any fucking sense. Um, and it reported on, I guess I don't know what the stories that the other papers already reported on. How am I, how they had advanced over the last, I don't know how many hours, whatever. So anyways, uh, he had it and it was a Monday through Friday fucking route and it was like, that thing was with the holy grail of paper routes in my neighborhood.

Speaker 1:          00:49:32       And the oldest brother got it and he passed it onto his next brother. It's, it's stayed, they had like three boys and they all had the fucking route. And the youngest kid was my age, so there was no way to ever get the fucking paper route. So we had the globe, Harold's first, then the Boston Globe, and that thing was seven days a week, three 65. And I had from third grade to a, yeah, ninth grade. And I, I don't think, I haven't missed a day unless I had a ruptured appendix. I messed up a couple of weeks that time and we took a family trip one time when I was a kid and, uh, and I remember it's sucked. You'd come back, these fucking asshole adults would do your route and he just, you know, I said, put it in the door. It was always dry. They would put a fucking rubber band around it and elastic, whatever, fuck you call it. And they would just drive down the street and fucking throw it. You get all these complaints and everyone would get mad at you and all this shit. Um, so anyways, I ended, I saved up my money and I bought that unit. They get new ovo sport, right. Really Nice fucking bike. And um,

Speaker 3:          00:50:44       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:50:44       I Dunno, my parents never threw it out. And I came home one day in my thirties and I saw it. I was like, I'm gonna fucking take that thing. All right. Because, and you just, you know, represents something to me. Working hard, you know, then if you work hard, you get stuff right. So I fucking got that thing and it was all like originals and all that shit and I just, it just fucking finally died on me from years of fucking riding and stuff. And I decided, um, our guests sitting in my parents' garage, I decided that I was going to fix it up and I finally brought it over to somebody. It literally costs me almost the same amount of money that the bike cost me in like 1983 when I bought it. And, uh, I want to get back to riding. I just have to find where you can ride in La. That's like safe. I know what the Santa Monica you can and fucking, uh,

Speaker 3:          00:51:31       mmm.

Speaker 1:          00:51:33       I don't know, maybe some of the parks along the La River, but I always feel like you're gonna meet some fucking serial killer down there. You know, I'll get attacked by a fucking mountain lion. Ellie is a weird place. Um, so anyways, let me get back. And I used to ride that thing when I got, when I got older, when I was 21.

Speaker 3:          00:51:49       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:51:50       I got into the best shape of my fucking life. Uh, 80 shape, you know, so no squats. But what I did for legs was I rode the bike and I used to ride 11 miles every day, Monday through Friday, after working in a warehouse. That's how young I was. I had the energy to do that. And on the weekends I would write 18 miles and I would take one fucking day off.

Speaker 3:          00:52:08       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:52:12       Needless to say, I won't be doing that again. I'll fucking take a little five mile. John's on the left. One fucking level land. All right. Sorry. That was in my entire history with bicycles. Bikes used to be a big fucking deal, by the way. I don't think they're big deals to kids anymore. Who is freedom? He just fucking left. You'd find other kids. He just fucking wrote around did shit. You know? I don't know. I started doing long distance biking. He said in my twenties, I was never in bad shape, but I certainly wasn't in as good as shape as I am now. Having said all that, I really hope that once this year you are able to order yourself a pizza crack open a highlife and watch nine hours of football. Yeah, that sounds perfect. He said none of the hypothetical. Uh, what would you be, what would be your combination of pizza and beer for that occasion? Uh, I go with a local joint here in Massachusetts, originally from Cleveland. Go browns. Congratulations on your victory. He said Anna Killian's Irish red a beer that no one drinks anymore, but it's delicious.

Speaker 3:          00:53:09       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:53:12       I gotta be honest with you. I am, I am male. I am white trash when it comes to beer. If I could find it, you know what I would do? The first beer I ever got drunk off of was a Michelob light there. My pizza spot was in Stoughton, Massachusetts, the town spa. So I'd have one of their pizzas. I rarely have a plain one extra crispy, whatever they do, you know, well done. And, uh, I would have a Michelob light and I'd have it in one of those giant fucking goblets that they used to have at the end of the Miller lite commercials. Um, less fill in? No. Was it less filling? Tastes great. That's right. That's what I would do. Um, New York, my pizza spot,

Speaker 1:          00:54:02       I haven't lived there a long time. The pizza place, I used to go to his right, right next to danger fields cause I would always ended in that spot and I would go, it was Sutton pizza, I think it was called. And I always thought that they had a nice sauce and the cheese was on it in a, complimented the sauce rather than destroying even being able to taste that there was any sort of sauce there. Uh, but I know there's a bunch of, you know, I haven't lived there in like fucking 11 years, so I have no idea what everybody liked that Joe's pizza down the village was a big one. Um, but I dunno, I liked that. That Sutton pizza man. I fucking like that shit. All right. Old podcast question. Ah, dear Billy. Been doing it forever, uh, was listening to a throwback on the Thursday podcast. Great taste in music by the way. Uh, that's Andrew.

Speaker 1:          00:54:49       That's his taste in music. If you listen to mine, it would just be like, yeah, it'd be bunch of hair metal. And I was wondering if your feelings have changed on downloading music and movies illegally. You are ranting on and on how terrible it is. And I'm too young to remember that controversy. I'm 20, but you had me convinced it was certainly illegal and not cool. Um, I dunno if it was ever a legal, what happened was the technology came about that you could do it. Uh, anyways, it said something said he had naps. My friend said he had Napster in high school and everyone did. Maybe you said your older brother, you left out that word. I guess it's like looking at celebrity leaks. Celebrity nude photos. Yeah, it's wrong. But who doesn't want to get a glimpse of that? I never look at those fucking things, but somebody hacks somebodies phone there.

Speaker 1:          00:55:41       Text messages or emails. That's none of my fucking businessman. I see. I really can't believe like what fucking voyeurs people are. I don't give a shit what anybody does. You know, and I don't give a fuck what you said on your phone. And I think if, you know, like if somebody ever like, oh, can you believe this person texted this? This is offensive. It's like, well they didn't text it to you. They texted privately to somebody else. You're not supposed to be reading that. Don't read other people's text messages. You won't get fucking offended. You have no idea what the tone of that was. This could be a joke. This could be dead serious, no fucking idea. And even still it's like reading stuff, but I love reading somebody else's mail is fucking illegal. But like hacking someone's phone is fine. I have no idea. Anyways, um, I guess the only part that I thought you might have changed your mind on is how people around the world have heard you, cause they got it illegally. Listening to your podcast helps me sort out my feelings on lots of things, but also your points make me realize that the world's has virtually no black or white issue as well. If you're talking about my podcast, my podcast is free.

Speaker 3:          00:56:44       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:56:46       But I would say, um,

Speaker 3:          00:56:50       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:56:51       Has it changed? Yeah, I still pay for music.

Speaker 3:          00:56:54       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:56:56       I go to a iTunes is where I do it. I don't like those streaming services because they fuck over the musicians and I know app I iTunes, they just fuck him over, man. It's ridiculous. Itunes does it too. But like I know, like one of them, I remember they were talking about me possibly streaming my, one of my albums, they're like, yeah, for every thousand plays we'll give you a, we'll give you a half a cent. It's like, go fuck yourself. They had all his advertising and shit on the side and everything. So they getting all this credit and making all this fucking money and then you're not even roll in a penny towards me there that shopping it in half and then sliding it across the fucking table. Um, I will say like, you know, I don't police a lot of shit too much on youtube. I should probably do that more. But um,

Speaker 3:          00:57:44       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:57:45       You know, I definitely saw the advantages. You know, when I went to, uh, when I went over to Europe, I gave up my DVDs for free and told people to upload them onto their youtube pages because I wanted to get into the, you know, different language areas on youtube. You know, cause I one time I was trying to learn to play the rhythm, um, diverse section of walk this way on the good on the guitar. And the only guy did a lesson was a French guy and I clicked on his fucking video and then all of a sudden all my videos to the right word in French and I was like, wow, what part of youtube has this? So when I went to Norway and Sweden and all those, I was like, you know, put clips to this up on your page. I don't give a fuck. You know, it's on Pirate Bay anyways. What the fuck do I care? I might as well get in on this somehow. So I kind of had to roll with it. But, um,

Speaker 3:          00:58:33       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:58:33       No, I, it's, it's still stealing, but I pay for all my movies. I paid for a, now that isn't necessarily true though. There'll be a few, like I try, I try to pay for movies. Like if I go on like a Netflix and it isn't there and I can't find it playing on cable, you know, and it's something I really want to fucking see. I will watch a movie for free. I'll let, I'll admit that I, I've definitely done that shit. Hey, here's something I want to speak into that I actually watched a couple of movies when I was on the plane there.

Speaker 3:          00:59:05       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:59:07       I gotta I gotta show. I gotta get a shout out to, uh, you know what sucks is one of the fucking movies. I can't even remember the name of the movie and I really fucking enjoyed it.

Speaker 7:          00:59:23       Um, fuck. What the hell was I? I literally watched it's, Oh, something. Was it Gringo? Is that the name of the fucking movie? Charlie's Daren was in it and she was fucking hilarious. And her character was, was fucking, I love the movie. Absolutely loved the movie. Um, let's see. Gringo, Charlie's Theron, right? Is that the name of the movie? Did I get it right? Yeah. Gringo. Check that one out. Love that movie. And then I saw a, Oh fuck. I gotta answer this. Hang on. All right, I'm back. Uh, so anyways, then I watched this other movie called superfly and was fucking blown away. Like I couldn't get the fucking, all the actors names and there was so many great actors and there was this kid, I hope it says name it. It's k a l a n Kr Walker collide. Kaylon I'll buy say right K or walk to fucking white to get it right.

Speaker 7:          01:00:24       Walker. He, his character was so fucking good. I don't want to ruin the movie. I just thought the last time you saw him should have been more of an event with how good his performance was. And then the kid who played Superfly's righthand man was fucking great. Uh, I, I don't know how to do this without ruining the fucking move. Sony. Oh, it's just, it's a really fun fucking movie. Um, I've seen some good ones lately, but, uh, you know, I'm writing this fucking script. I got into the whole world are writing scripts now. So now I'm actually watching movies. I'm trying to find people, just remember them. Oh, were in, in Gringo. That the fucking dude who played the guys accountant in the beginning was fucking great. Uh, everybody in that movie was great. So check those out, man. I hope I'm not doing this shit where I saw it on a plane.

Speaker 7:          01:01:17       So you're just like, this is fucking great. It's taken up two and a half hours, but these were legit could find, I think. I think they'll hold up. Even if you just hanging out at your house, you know, with your fucking virtual reality glasses and whatever the fucking internet porn you're watching, I think you can get through them. All right. Those are my recommendations from movies. Uh, congratulations to the fucking lions, man. A huge, huge fucking victory for you guys. He turned around. I'm liking seeing, you know, the chiefs and all these, these teams being, I mean, I obviously don't want the patriots run to ever fucking end and uh, I've enjoyed the hell out of it. And you know, I remember coming up, it was all about the cowboys and Steelers and I remember thinking when the fucks our time and so when we finally had our time, I enjoyed the whole thing. I hope it's not over. Um, but if it is, you know, it fucking is and I'll be happy for the rest of my fucking life is what I mean. What am I going to do? I'm going to bitch about fucking 10 11 championships straight across the fucking board in a 15 year period. It was incredible. But the red sox is still coming, you know, who knows. Good

Speaker 7:          01:02:20       keep could keep going on the Celtics look fucking good. I still believe in the Patriots so, but uh, it is a lot of fun to see all these different teams doing well and I'm like beyond excited to see the next Brown's game cause I want to see this. Baker may feel kids. See if he lights it up again. That's exciting. All right. That's it. That's the podcast. Have a great couple of days. I'll check on Thursday. Go fuck yourselves.
