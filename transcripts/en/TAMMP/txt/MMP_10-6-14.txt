Speaker 1:          00:00:01       Hey, what's going on is bill burn? It's the Monday morning podcasts about the October six, 2014 hello? It's me. I haven't podcast for a long, long time. Actually it was last Monday in the morning due to Ooh, it's important too.

Speaker 2:          00:00:28       Hey,

Speaker 1:          00:00:29       what's going on? How are Ya? Um, as you can tell, I screamed and yelled all this fucking weekend and that only means one thing. Oh, Billy red face had a standup gig. If you're new to my podcast, well why is your voice gets raspy? FTF His show because I don't know how to write a joke. So what I have to do is I have to scream my ideas. I asked, I have to use the f word right and left and left and right. You know, and then make silly faces. I was actually up in San Francisco. If you're going to San Fran [inaudible] goal, um, I'm going to put some flowers in your hair. Yeah. And some change in your pockets for the fucking 9,000 homeless people that have up there. Jesus Christ just inundated with them. You know, it was great. It was towards the end of the month and two great things.

Speaker 1:          00:01:22       Wait, that doesn't make sense. The beginning of the month was back when you wouldn't see the homeless people in San Francisco because they actually gave them a stipend, which was a, you know, a little bit of money so they could get them off the fucking streets. You know, like these fucking people know how to handle money. They knew how to handle money. They wouldn't have been homeless. Hey, this guy sucks at math. I know. Let's give them an Algebra book. All right, see a fella. Good luck with that. We're not going to teach you on any level. That's not even true. That's, that's even worse that, that, that example doesn't even make sense. That wasn't the correct example. Because if somebody sucks with money and you just give them money, you know, so he sucks at math. He give him an Algebra book. They could actually learn about math. How do you just give somebody some math, give him a bag and numbers, whatever you want.

Speaker 1:          00:02:17       You know what I'm trying to say? All right. And even if you don't, I don't know that you don't because you can't call into to this show. All right. The phone lines, the nonexistent phone lines cannot light up. I'm trying to write down in Alabama, so I don't forget to talk about them this week. Alabama, the dream ended this weekend. Um, anyway, so I was up there in San Francisco and I was working Davies Symphony Hall and a, I had a great time. And you know, my favorite part of the fucking weekend was j law had Jason Lawhead Rosebowl tailgate legend Jason Law head, uh, before he's gonna bring me out. He's like,

Speaker 3:          00:03:06       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:03:06       He's like, what do you want to have fast? She turned on the fucking air conditioning. Can he hear that stupid thing rattling? I tried to tell her, you know, you try to tell your wife you don't want something. And what did they fucking do it anyways? Because they think that they know. I know what's good for him. I know it's good from, hang on, I gotta shut this fucking thing off.

Speaker 3:          00:03:27       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:03:27       All right. I'm back. Unfucking believable. I swear to God they they, you know for all their bitch moaning and complaining they do on all those, those fucking Yap Yap and shows their, you know, I know I was what's better than one woman running her? Yap. Well let's get three others and have them all sit around with their shoes, you know. Yap, Yap, Yap. And about all the fucking shit that's going on are those shows by the way, the view, the talk and all those are those like women's versions of like a guy watching those stupid pregame NFL shows, you know rather than four broads, you get fucking four meathead guys in their suits.

Speaker 3:          00:04:07       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:04:07       You know it's, it's a bit of bubble screen. John Gruden says fucking bubble screen. One more goddamn time this fucking week. I got it. It's a bubble screen. There's a screen and there's a

Speaker 4:          00:04:20       bubble and he's got an option and they're going to fucking have the Lyman go this way and see what their doors you. I took her to abroad broad. Okay, now you guys just saw option over here. If he wants to, we could throw it burger Gertrude to keep a fork, a ball. And you could try to run it with your cues to Corny book. Her's door. Understood were to make the decision to Eagle with loose the pool or to hold on to it. Oh, tell you work when you, when you start to join no dirt, dirt. When good things will be helping it. The, this you don't put pool.

Speaker 1:          00:04:49       Um, so just all of that dumb shit that I just fucking said that I don't need to know. I don't need to know any of that. I don't need to know what a fucking bubble screen is to watch a God damn gay. It's a hot read. It's a hot read or you, yeah, it comes up in the line. It's a fucking hot. Is it a heart rate? It's a hot read. I can't, it just be, he goes up to the line and if he sees something, yeah, let's fucking do it. And if he doesn't, let's just stick with the play. It's a hot read on a bubble screen in a cupboard to tango, Sierra Alpha. Um, anyways, so I'm up there in San Fransisco and for once every, I was up there Friday, Saturday and Sunday, and it was beautiful weather every single day. 85 degrees, 80 degrees, global warming at its finest. Right? This is how miserable the fucking weather is in San Francisco. They, most places don't have air conditioning because they don't fucking need it. They're in California and they don't need air conditioning.

Speaker 3:          00:06:08       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:06:08       All right. Why don't you wrap your little fucking podcasting listening brain around that? Alright. I'm not sure when you think about a California goes pretty much almost the entire coast of the west coast of the continental United States, the lower 48. Anyways, so I guess at some point, right? You gotta be as far north is like Wyoming. I know they get snow, but I know people in Wyoming got to have fucking air conditioning.

Speaker 3:          00:06:41       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:06:41       Does anybody in Wyoming listen to this? You out there right now on a horse, just sitting there staring a cattle, trying to figure out what's out there that keeps killing one or your cows every fucking eight days.

Speaker 3:          00:06:57       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:06:58       Sitting there arguing with your buddies. Look at the [inaudible] Lou, the bite marks there. I ain't no fucking coyote. Coyote can't kill fucking dumb bitch. You know you get that from you get that from your mother. I knew she was fucking dumb the moment I looked down at her boots. All right, butter titch wire hanging out. My favorite song was on the Jukebox, so I said fuck it. I ain't got nothing in the back of my truck. I layered her down there, stick my cores, lied on her forehead and I'll, I'll tell you I'm a put a rod in there. Well next thing you know, she starts calling me up. All my SAP come in, they're good buddy. My stomach's getting bigger and I ain't been eating shit. I faked I'm pregnant. And I'm like, why ain't this the sum bitch? All right, let us, Jesus is coming back again as a baby. It must be mine. Say you are here you are half a fucking stupid telling me that a goddamn coyote killed his fucking cow. I will tell you one more time then it was a pack of wolves. And if you keep having that dumb look on your face, I swear to fucking God, I'm a shoot you on my own God damn property. Is that understood?

Speaker 1:          00:08:21       Oh, quit your crying and you're just like your mother. If you're out there in Wyoming. All right. Yeah, I know you got air conditioning. You might not have teeth, but I know you have Eric and I'm sorry. Why do I keep doing this? You know what's funny about Wyoming? Um, a lot of it is fucking rich people who've gone out there and bought property like Ted fucking Turner, like Ted Turner I think can ride his horse from the border of the United States, Mexico

Speaker 5:          00:08:56       and ride his fucking horse all the way up to Canada. Please. That's his goal without ever not being on his own property. You know, and like most driven men, at any point does he even think about the fucking horse that does not want to walk Gallup or trot all the things that horses do shit in public. It doesn't want to do it. Doesn't want to do that.

Speaker 3:          00:09:25       Okay.

Speaker 5:          00:09:25       They never wanted you on its back to begin with. Why the fuck would it want you on its back?

Speaker 3:          00:09:32       Yeah.

Speaker 5:          00:09:32       Jesus Christ. You're Ted Turner. You can't afford a robot horse. Hi with your jeopardy mustache. Having said all that great investment, I got to tell you that tech journey, you know when it comes to money, he understands it. You know, it'd be great if Ted Turner just walked up to a homeless guy and rather than explain money to him, just started yelling at him about money, dressing them down. You know, like a head coach pissed off at his fucking starting quarterback who's making a bunch of mistakes. Right. And his job is like right on the bubble. You know, if he just came walking up to the homeless guy, throws a fucking clipboard down at his feet after he sees the guy by some fucking heroin with a bunch of nickels.

Speaker 3:          00:10:22       Okay.

Speaker 5:          00:10:22       I don't fucking, I don't got an immediate FGL again. All right. I'm sorry. I just set up a total comedy scenario and now I'm baling. All right. I'm fucking rolling right out of it. You know what? I can't do a Ted Turner. I even know what he sounds like.

Speaker 3:          00:10:36       Okay.

Speaker 5:          00:10:36       I just, when I picture him, I picture Norm Mcdonald. When he used to imitate that guy used to hold the pan and run for President Bob Dole or the above though. That's how I pictured Ted Turner. Ted Turner talking a new talk show. He's so fucking rich. He doesn't have any guests. Um, all right. So anyways, I go up to som slams, see school and the weather's beautiful and um, you know, I got some family and friends up there. We fucking hang out. What do we do? What did we do Friday night? Oh, went out to this unbelievable Italian restaurant and uh, I actually have been craving a pork chop for a while, for years. I actually am not gonna lie to you. I got to, I got a great pork shop. Why is that word sounds so annoying. Pork Chop. I'm at this restaurant out here in la and it was so fucking unbelievably good. All right, so unbelievably fucking that. I came back like 10 days later going, I got to get this pork chop again. Pork chops and applesauce g that swell, right Brady bunch, Brady bunch reference there wold champion Apple, Shush, shush match. Well, um, and I fucking, I went back and they had taken it off the menu

Speaker 5:          00:11:59       and idea or just something else since sucked. In fact, everything's sucked. The offense shocked. The defense sacked. We sucked. Um, the whole fucking, the whole meal stunk. So I went years just thinking about this fucking pork shop, waiting for the right fucking restaurant with the right level of quality of food that if it was on the God damn menu, I was going to order it. There's not a lot of plate. Not a lot of Nice restaurants will serve via fucking pork chop. You know, your choices are usually, you know, stake some sort of chicken fish, maybe lamp.

Speaker 5:          00:12:41       All right? They might do a pull pork. Uh, they might do a piggy or fucking sandwich, a brisket or whatever, but, but to try to get somebody to get dim, to make a fucking pork chop, all right. The way that your mom never did. Cause who's kidding who, whose kid? No moms do not know how to cook pork chops. All right? They just date as my dad would say, Christ, you're cut the shit out of it. Right? They cook the shit out of it, which is very easy to do with pork. I don't know why, but it's very easy for that thing to taste like one of the fucking tiles that's on the floor. Your kitchen. Um, so anyways, I went to this restaurant and this Italian restaurant that had homemade fucking pasta, one of my favorites, and I saw that pork chop and I said, fuck that pasta. All right there, Luigi, you tell Clemenza and the kitchen. I don't need his fucking pasta. All right, I want, I want to fucking porkchop. Solera this portrait. I got a side of pasta. The Pasta was fucking outstanding. And I know like most times, most shows like Anthony Bordain would tell you what fucking restaurant he went to. I don't do that. You know why? Because I want to be able to go back there without standing in any sort of a fucking line. So why don't you go to San Francisco and figure it out for yourself?

Speaker 5:          00:14:10       That would be my cooking show. Do you like how arrogant I am? Anthony Bordain has this huge fucking millions and millions of fans watching his show. I just got, you know, I got a couple thousand fans listen to this fucking thing and I want to make sure I cannot guys, I can't say the names of things on my podcast, the, the, the, the crush of people that will be showing up to get a fucking porch up at God damn. Oh my God. Are you kidding me? Oh my God. Are you kidding me? Oh my God. All right. I thought the,

Speaker 1:          00:14:52       I just thought this whole fucking thing just shut off. When I set it back down, I'm doing this right as I woke up.

Speaker 6:          00:15:01       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:15:01       The law many times that's happened to me. Like I go to restart it and then I fucking riff for 20 minutes and I look in the fucking recorders off and I'm like, oh my God. Just like I just said, oh my God, are you fucking Katie? I got to do it all over again. I had a really funny character from Wyoming. I'll never be recreated. Um, all right, good. I just fucking panicked. And you know what, that brings me into a fucking unbelievable story that I got to talk about later. Let me finish with the pork chop, then I'll do a little bit of advertising. All right. That's your second course. They're right in the dessert will be my little fucking story about panicking that will not be enjoyable and listened to it. Absolutely terrified me. Alright, so I ordered this fucking pork chop. Absolutely delicious.

Speaker 6:          00:15:43       Yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:15:44       absolutely. Fucking delicious. You know, and um, I was I talking about it yet and I'm not going to tell you where I got it. Not only what, I never tell you if I know I can't even remember the name of it. So now I'm fucked. I don't know who gives a shit. You heard me trying to remember the name of the fucking x men as a Goddamn zillion dollar movie. I'm going to remember the name of a restaurant. The fuck was it called? It was a number in it. I remember that.

Speaker 6:          00:16:12       Okay,

Speaker 1:          00:16:12       that Jesus Christ, this is when the cops would just put away their little fucking, you know that little pad that they write on their part. We have an iPad now.

Speaker 6:          00:23:34       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:23:35       And Oh my God, I almost forgot about the fucking steam room.

Speaker 6:          00:23:39       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:23:39       I got to tell you about the fucking steam room.

Speaker 6:          00:23:43       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:23:43       I gotta make sure I remembered to tell you that. All right, so let's just get to the show. So I go over to a Davies Symphony Hall, beautiful venue. Bunch of people showed up. And uh, so before I, I go out on stage or whatever, before we starting to show Jason Law had goes, hey bill. He's like, what do you want me to say about you? And I was like, you know, I'm going to see them on Netflix, Letterman. And he goes, you want me to hype the new special? And I said, yeah, if you don't mind doing that. He said, absolutely. When does it come out? What's it called? They said, it comes out December 5th on Netflix and it's called, I'm sorry you feel that way. And he goes, okay, all right, cool. And then five minutes later he goes, Hey, what's your special called again?

Speaker 1:          00:24:25       I keep thinking, why do I do this? What did I go? It's called, I'm sorry you feel this way. He goes, okay, I got it. I got it. And I looked at him, I go, Jay, he's like, what? I go, you're going to fuck this up. And he goes, no, I'm not. I'm a professional. And he laughs and he leaves. So he goes out and he does his thing. He gets to his clothes and bit, it crushes right. And uh, and I'm like, okay, you know, I'm getting a bubble. I'm getting ready to get brought out. So I'm ready to get brought up and I'm waiting for him know to do as little fighting out of the red corner. He stands at five foot 10. He can't get a Tan. He's got freckles on his ass though. Rating. Right. Um, but he doesn't do that.

Speaker 1:          00:25:10       He just starts talking. He finished his fucking act like he always does. He kills like he always does. And now we supposed to fucking bring me up and instead of bringing me up, he starts Yammer and all and on going, you know, it's been great out here to be here in San Francisco, a beautiful weather today. You know, me and bill were out there a sampling, some of the local fare Blahblahblahblahblah and he just starts just not telling jokes, not really telling a story. Just sort of vaguely describing the day. Yeah. It was about 82 degrees out there, barometric pressure. And I'm sitting there going, what the fuck is this guy doing it? And then he just goes, all right, you guys ready for the man? He came to see, you know, you know, he is, uh, he's got a special coming out on Netflix and then he just looks over at me and he goes and he's like, I can't remember what it's called. And then I fuckin died laughing, died laughing. Cause then I realized what he was doing, he wasn't even talking to the crowd, he was just saying English words that they'd understand is in his brain. He was going, what the fuck is it called? So I went out there and for five minutes just trashed him for saying sampling some of the local fair and looking back, I should have trashed the crowd for not immediately heckling him for saying fucking sampling some of the local fare. What the fuck does that mean? Do you

Speaker 5:          00:26:44       realize what a creepy, creepy fucking expression that is? Sampling the local fare. Anybody who just blew into town could be talking about anything from getting something to eat, to being a fucking serial rapist. And that was sampling some of the local fare. You know, something like Hannibal Lecter would say 50 fucking took a bite out of your neck. Um, so anyways, so I went out there and I tried a bunch of new shit and it seemed to work and then we did a

Speaker 6:          00:27:15       okay.

Speaker 5:          00:27:15       It was just, it was just a perfect show, man. That first show was just awesome, right? Not saying the second one wasn't, but I had such a funny moment, uh, during the show where I'm in the middle of my act and the giants.

Speaker 6:          00:27:29       Okay.

Speaker 5:          00:27:29       You know, they were in the playoffs, playoffs. And um, I'm in the middle of one of my jokes and I have no idea what's going on in the game. And all of a sudden this guy just yells out in the upper deck. He just goes, and the crowd just fucking erupts into chairs. So I immediately do the math. I might, San Francisco giants. It's fucking October. That's right. I've been watching some of the minutes to playoffs and I was like, all right. Yeah. I can't get mad at that. I can't get mad at that. Your giants fans, you want to be watching the games, but you fucking bought tickets to my show so you know you're going to do a little multitask in there. So I said, all right, two to one and I was like, what? Editing is it? And the crowd starts yelling, you know when a bunch of people are yelling and you standing up on stage, it bounced. The sound bounces off the wall behind you and it can be very hard to understand what people are saying. So I was like, what? Anything is it? And they're like, Yay. I'm like, why? Why don't you know, Yay Jay.

Speaker 5:          00:28:32       And then I go, I go, I can't hear you. There you go. Hey Jay.

Speaker 6:          00:28:37       Okay.

Speaker 5:          00:28:38       Oh gone. 88 80 come on. What? What? And just fucking hold up your fingers. And they kept yelling out and it sounded like they was saying eight. I go, you know what? It sounds like you're saying 18 what inning? Just one person. One person was holding up seven fingers. So I was like the seventh and they were like, hey, chain. I sorta kept sounding like I kept the goal. He keeps sounding like you're saying the 18th a minute, 90 excruciating seconds to this.

Speaker 6:          00:29:09       Yeah,

Speaker 5:          00:29:10       until I find out they were actually saying 18. It was the fucking eighth inning.

Speaker 6:          00:29:16       Okay.

Speaker 5:          00:29:17       The national score to run in like the third fucking inning to go up one to nothing.

Speaker 6:          00:29:23       Okay.

Speaker 5:          00:29:24       And then the giants scored one in the top of the ninth to tie it up or the bottom of the night. Oh No. Top of the night. That's right. It was in Washington.

Speaker 6:          00:29:33       Yeah.

Speaker 5:          00:29:33       To tie it at one to one and then they didn't score again until the fucking top of the 18th and neither did the nationals.

Speaker 1:          00:29:42       The nationals went 15 fucking innings without scoring a run. The giants played a whole nother baseball game before they scored another fucking run. And uh, unfucking believable. And you know what? It's odd enough that happened in the middle of July. You'd want to kill yourself, but if it happens in October, it's unbelievable.

Speaker 1:          00:30:05       You know, for as much shit as people give me as a hockey fan. Why do you watch the regular season? It doesn't even count. Everybody makes it, but like four fucking teams. It's like, yeah, but there's exciting games. They're allowed to fight. Okay. There's great things that can happen. You know, baseball on the other fucking hand other than the beginning in April where you're excited because it's a new season. Other than that, I mean it's just, it's fucking brutal until you get to October. And I would put baseball playoffs right up playoffs. I put it up there with any other fucking playoffs. Um, I actually, I love October baseball. Um, it's, this is the best time of fucking year. October a playoff baseball, national football league. The national football league has been going on long enough where he's starting to know who's going to be competitive and who isn't. And then hockey's coming up and then right after that basketball, it's unfucking believable. Unbelievable. My life is perfect. Um, and I actually watched that first. Um, cod knows Dodgers game. I didn't see game too. I watched game one and I was, I am 100% convinced that Donnie baseball is cursed.

Speaker 1:          00:31:26       I mean, they had their race. What's the guy? Kershaw, I don't even know. I don't even watch baseball. I have no fucking idea. And all I do is I, I just keep hearing about this guy that he's basically having like a seasoned better than Pedro Martinez in like 1999. I'm like, I gotta Watch this guy. And, uh, I start watching the game and I know the Dodgers have this debt. Unbelievable, right fielder. He's like fucking Willie Mays on steroids. Not Literally steroids, but you know, people are just bigger now. And uh, so he gets drilled in the fucking arm when he's up there and I guess the cardinals were doing that shit last year. So all of a sudden the next guy that comes up there, first base, when he was like my height, he gets in the face of fucking some guy named Benji. I don't know anybody's name anymore. They start fucking screaming at each other. And uh, I was, I was totally hooked. I was into it. The fucking Dodgers were up six to two going into the seventh or eighth fucking ending. All right. I think Clayton Kershaw is the name of the pitcher. I have no fucking idea. But now they all have beards and all that crazy shit. They all stole it from the Red Sox who stole it from the homeless guys, right? And uh, you know, they've got their fucking ace

Speaker 1:          00:32:42       guys got no, was it six to one or 62? It's got a full run fucking lead. The get Goddamn game is over. All of a sudden he loads up the basis is a single six to three. There's another single six to four Donny baseball comes walking out like, dude, what the fuck are you doing in the little bearded wonder goes, hey, I may not be able to grow a man's beard, but I know how to get out of this fucking Annie. All right. I'm only at a hundred pitches. I won the Cy Young Award. I won every fucking award you can win as a goddamn picture. I've got this Donnie and Donnie baseball makes the right choice. That's a fucking locally. This is the move to make. We've got to win game one. We got to do it on your arm, right? Fucking comes up. This other fucking dude who owns them. This is the worst fucking sports coverage ever. I don't know anybody's name. He fucking, it's a a God damn double. That just clears the basis. Three run score, six to five, six to six. Now it's six to seven. They're down by a fucking run and they've got a man on second. Now Donnie baseball comes up, poses fucking kid brings in this fucking pull Luca, he comes in, serves up a fucking meatball,

Speaker 1:          00:34:03       right? That's gotta be the Saint Louis fucking announcer. They score two more runs. It is now nine to six. They started the inning, six to two, up for fucking runs with the greatest picture of the last 15 fucking years. By the end of the inning, they are down by three runs. How does that happen? You know how bad I'm rooting for the Dodgers to win. There's so many teams that I love this year. Kansas City, you got to love that. They're back in at the Baltimore Orioles. You gotta love that. They're back in it. You know, don Mattingly, you got to want that guy to win a fucking, uh, you know, when a ring and then he got the giants. I mean, I, you know, they've just one, two, I mean, I like seeing a fucking dynasty,

Speaker 1:          00:34:52       whatever the fuck they would be called. It's great, right? A lot of fucking teams to root for. And then they'd sit, nick, uh, suggested that maybe the cardinals is steel and signs from second base and that they have a reputation for doing that. And once I found out that's not illegal, it's like a fucking love these guys. And even if it was illegal, that's the kind of cheating that you got to respect. You know, if you can look over at your fucking neighbors paper and they're smarter than you are, you know, are you're really cheating. Oh, you just delegating power. Um, anyways. Oh, what the fuck I'm talking about? So I watched that whole game beside myself. I just can't fucking believe it. And the thing about don Mattingly's such a class act and he just sits there expressionless and you know, it's just ripping his fucking hard out. I want to see that guy get a ring. So God damn bad if he doesn't, I would love to see either the royals or the Orioles. Because when I first started watching playoff baseball, it was always the royals would always win the west and they could not get past the Yankees. Um,

Speaker 1:          00:35:58       and then there was a, when do they all they find got by him in 1980 and then lost to the Phillies with Pete rose at first base dribbling the ball up to the picture on the fucking astro turf. And um, and the Orioles,

Speaker 1:          00:36:15       I, I have to see, I saw them when it in 83 and a, the first world series, well, the Third World series that I watched, 1979, the orals versus the pirate. So I was hoping the pirates are going to win that one game playoff and maybe I could have a rematch in 1979 and nine different, they'd bring back. We Ah, Woo Hoo. Who? Um, sorry. Um, anyways, uh, so I watch that shit so that I'm rooting for a Donny baseball. So anyway, so I'm watching that shit. Then I go on and I go do my show, smoke a cigar. And one of the greatest things you can do after you smoke cigars, besides take a fucking shower and gargle with mouthwash for an hour, you still gonna wake up with that taste in the back of your throat. So if you have access to a steam shower, you go down and you'd take a state, you take a steam and you're fucking sweat out all the impurities and um,

Speaker 6:          00:37:06       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:37:07       And then you get, yeah, you, you're good to go. You go out and you're fucking jump in a cold shower. A lot of people don't know how to take a fucking steam. You know, they fucking go into this steam sweat, they're fucking nuts off. And then they walk out and they stand there. Oh God, it's hot as shit. And they just stand there and then they fucking go back in and then they come back out and then they go, I got one more session and mean they fucking go back in again. Morons fucking morons. All right, this is how you take a steam. You just stay in there for like 10 minutes. That's all you need. And as you're in there for 10 minutes, be wiping the fucking sweat off of you. Your body is, is when he made you sweat. It's releasing toxins. Your skin is like a sponge.

Speaker 1:          00:37:50       If you let it sit there on you, okay, you're gonna fucking reabsorb some of it. As you're sitting there in the fucking steam shower, these fucking guys do that. Then you supposed to walk out of the steam shower and immediately walk in and take an ice cold shower immediately. So your poor state closed and your wash off as much of the fucking toxins that you sweat it out as possible and you will feel like a fucking million bucks. All right? And all you need to do is just be in the water, the ice cold water for like, you know, whatever. Five, six seconds,

Speaker 6:          00:38:27       okay,

Speaker 1:          00:38:27       oh long it takes you to fucking hoes off your body and then he could turn it on to an acceptable temperature and then you're good to go. And you always wear flops, so you don't get fucking plantars warts or athlete's foot or any other fucking awful bacteria. That's, that's, it's in the God damn thing there. Right. So, um, anyways, the fucking, uh, how's it going to say? So we fucking go there and there's, I, I walk in one with law head and I walk in to see if there's anybody in the steam shower and I walk and there's the, uh, the sauna, which is just the dry heat. And I look in there and there was this Asian dude completely fucking naked.

Speaker 6:          00:39:09       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:39:10       Okay. He had the decency to put his arm in front of his junk as I walk by, kind of like Burt Reynolds when he did the fucking, uh, the playgirl, whatever the, the playgirls center fold or whatever the fuck he did. Um, I'm like, Oh God, a naked Asian and Asian. We've got an Asian in their law it, and he's like, and then he's sitting there butt ass naked on the fucking seat that someone else has to sit on.

Speaker 6:          00:39:38       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:39:39       Fucking unbelievable. So meanwhile I had, you know, because I was walking in and make sure that the steam was on. Uh, so then we fucking come walking back in. And as we walked back in the, the naked Asian, the nation there is, he had gone into the shower, he knew to take the cold shower and he just comes walking out completely fucking naked. All right, so I'm laughing. There's always the fucking naked guy. All right. So then I, uh, I opened the sauna and in, no, no, no, no, no. If I fucked up as, as we go, that's right. Then we went back to the lockers. We change. Now we're walking back in and we'll laugh. And about the naked Asian dude. And right as we go to turn the fucking corner to go into the sauna, like the fucking Truman show for people walk in front of us and go right into the sauna and there's this little fuck, I mean, the steam room is this little ass fucking steam room and they all fucking go in there and I'm thinking, Oh man, maybe it's, maybe there'll be enough room.

Speaker 1:          00:40:39       And I opened the door and then I'll just fucking sit in there. It's just a nice guy, a packed house, whatever. These guys will just being in here for 10 minutes. So me and law had go back and we'd just sitting there and we're laughing about the naked Asian dude, right? Um, long story short, these fucking jerk offs are in this Goddamn a steam room and they're doing that shit with a commonality. So fucking hot and then drinking water, letting it all reabsorb and they just go on back in there in there for like a fucking half hour. So finally me lie, how to like, fuck, we got to go with like, you know, we want to go watch the football. What the fuck are we gonna do?

Speaker 6:          00:41:17       Okay?

Speaker 1:          00:41:18       You know what our options, you got all fucking 20 sweaty ball guys in there or we go in with the nation and in, in the sauna. So we say, well, the naked agent guy had left. At least we thought he did. So we go into the sauna and who comes fucking walking back the naked Asian. But now he's got a fucking towel on. Now he sits down, me and Jay, a fucking wearing towels. Thank God. Generally speaking, they come from a polite culture, so he leaves his towel on. So I'm thinking, all right, we're good here. We're fucking good here. And I'm sitting there and the sauna, the sauna isn't hot enough so the door hasn't clouded up. So we're just sitting there, we can see right out the door and all of a sudden this other naked guy completely fucking naked, comes walking out of the fucking is steam thing, just butt ass naked and is standing there like fucking will Ferrell and old school at the water fountain, Bending over, getting a goddamn drink.

Speaker 1:          00:42:19       And me and Jay are just laughing our asses off, staring down into the floor going, what the fuck is going on? And then the naked Asian guy crosses his fucking legs and starts cracking his toes in the ungodly. Sa Silence in this fucking sauna is this fucking will Pharrel asses in front of us. We're just like, I can't fucking believe it, right? So then we're sitting there and we got this deal. Like I said, the window is in fogged up. Then this fucking World War Two vet comes walking by completely fucking naked. You know the greatest generation, they never put a towel on. He comes fucking walking by all man balls and Dick and everything. And at this point, which is fucking does not to duty, just start laughing. And another guy comes walking in, he has a robe on another tub of shit and he goes into the song, he goes into the steam.

Speaker 1:          00:43:11       And finally we were like, look, if we just don't fucking walk in there, whenever going to be able to take a steam. And I fucking hate us on. I don't like the dry heat. I like the other thing. So we finally come walking in there. All right. And as I walk in, I see a place where I can sit down. This is all fogged up and I see how the corner of my eye, there's someone else sitting there, no towel on Dick and balls hanging out. So I go to shoot the guy at dirty look and who is it? It's the naked Asian. I thought he left. He did. And he left, got in the shower and then fucking went back in there. Fucking nightmare. So then we're sitting in there, all right, the will feral naked dude too. Fat fucks in the naked agent.

Speaker 1:          00:43:50       And then me and Jay law had is sitting in there, right? And the football guys now they're running their yaps totally killing any sorta relaxing, just sort of chilling out. Anyways, royal axes you can be with fucking, you know, naked guys all around you. And this sitting in the, you know, former athletes talking about sports and some sort of benefit that they would do it. Aw Man. Arizona was unbelievable. Is just hookers everywhere. People, Drake and blah blah blah blah, blah. The kids guys telling this story. It was some sort of benefit for kids and in the end he goes, you know, but it's all about the kids. It's all about the kids. Fucking jerk off starts the story talking about hookers. Um, anyways, long short, it finally ends up just being the two of us in there and we're just laughing our covered balls off.

Speaker 6:          00:44:37       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:44:38       I, I've never seen, I've never seen it like that ever.

Speaker 1:          00:44:43       Look like if you go to any sort of fucking gym, any sort of locker room, this going to be the naked guy, the guy just standing there. Right. And for you ladies out there, you'd probably think that, well, it's gotta be the well endowed guy showing off his fucking God damn mule, right. It, it, it usually isn't. It's usually just fucking some average guy, regular old fucking user-friendly Dick just standing there. You know, like the kind of package that they always make when they're like sculptors make, you know, they never make like a fucking huge Dick Statue. They don't, they just draw a regular old Dick. That's what it usually is. And there's usually one of them and he'd just sit there. Got Out is always why? Why the fuck does he fucking not notice? He's the only fucking naked dude in here of yourself. Right. But there's always that one guy, unless you go to the YMC a then there's usually about three because there's older people there. I never seen a fucking Dick and ball display like this in my life.

Speaker 1:          00:45:48       Unfucking believable. We would joke and we were waiting for what's his face, uncle melty to come walk in. Um, anyways, so that's the Dick and balls story.

Speaker 5:          00:48:49       Comp slash bill. All right, so the terrifying story than I have been teasing, teasing you guys about over the last couple of, uh, I don't know, minutes here. Um, so anyways, the shows went great in San Francisco and San Francisco and um, we're flying back and my wife bought, um, vanity fair I think.

Speaker 6:          00:49:16       Okay.

Speaker 5:          00:49:17       I Dunno, it's the magazine where Robert Downey Jr is on the cover and he looks like he's leaning out of the port hole of a ship dressed in a Tuxedo. It makes you think, are they, are they remaking the titanic? It's one of those photos. So she says, Hey, you are a, you know, she knows I'm a fan, obviously guys, unbelievable fucking actor. And she goes, hey, this is a great article. You ought to read it. So I'm looking in the table of contents. You know, it's one of those magazines. You've got to go buy 50 pages of advertiser advertisements before. Um,

Speaker 6:          00:49:50       okay.

Speaker 5:          00:49:50       You know, you get to the actual story. And the table of contents. So I found the table of contents and there was a story about this flight.

Speaker 6:          00:50:00       Okay.

Speaker 5:          00:50:00       Um, that was flying from Brazil to Paris, France. Um, and it was talking about technology and how this thing just basically fell out of the fucking sky because the pilots was the perfect storm of not communicating, getting confused, a malfunction in the, the, the, the system and um, these guys being able to recover.

Speaker 6:          00:50:29       Yeah,

Speaker 5:          00:50:29       it was uneasy. You know what the malfunction was basically they were flying out and the, uh, the captain, you'd only got an hour of sleep and he wanted to go take a nap. They had some thunder storms or whatever, a line of storm clouds coming up there flying at 36,000 feet and this guy wanted to climb up to 38 which is basically the ceiling that that plane could fly at safely. Cause at that point the air is going to be too thin. I and I would assume that the engine has to work too hard to suck in the air, suck, squeeze, Bang, blow, whatever the fuck they say. How a jet engine works. Um, and they said that the guy sounded nervous and it was this weird thing where the guy had like the, the copilot had like over 2,500 hours, which is a significant amount of time flying a fucking this type of an airplane. But most of it was just sitting there while it was on autopilot. And this was kind of the point of, of the um,

Speaker 6:          00:51:28       okay.

Speaker 5:          00:51:29       The article where, how just through the, the whole timeline of aviation back in the day you just had stick and rudder guys and they just flew the fucking thing. MMM. And then gradually they worked on these automated systems and the pilots were arguing against them saying there's nothing better than a thinking human being. And then these automated systems got so good that the um,

Speaker 6:          00:51:55       yeah,

Speaker 5:          00:51:55       basically accidents and everything went through the floor and it became way safer to fly and the automated systems took over. But now they've gotten to the point where, I don't know if they're saying that they can actually be dangerous. So basically what happened was that the captain went to go take a nap and then this other guy goes and he sits down and there was a miscommunication as to who the pilot in command was or who was in command or whatever. And they don't even have sticks anymore up there. They have like a joystick that you move and then the system interprets the movement.

Speaker 6:          00:52:34       Yeah.

Speaker 5:          00:52:35       Like not instantly. It has to have that split second where it interprets it and then it, it, it acts on whatever movement you did and um, the sticks camp, the joysticks can't move at the same time. Like say if both people in both, mmm. Both seats up there. If one was to move the joystick to the right and the other was to move it all the way to the left, what the computer would do would split the difference on the movement. And I dunno, it just, basically all that happened was they went into this storm and the air was cold enough with a water droplet said formed into ice crystals and it blocked there. Pito Tube. The Pito Tube is, you know, is on all aircraft. It's just a tube that points towards the front of the aircraft. And as you fly, as

Speaker 1:          00:53:26       the air is coming in it, that's how you figure out your airspeed. So what happened was they flew through this ice, ice went into the Pito Tube, it froze it up so the air couldn't go in anymore. So they no longer could, they lost their, uh, their air speed indicator. So they immediately lost that. All right. And they had the lights on in the cabinet there out over the ocean. They must've been then, it must have not been any moonlight or anything. So basically they couldn't see a horizon. All right. But all they had to do was just look at that little plane thing that just let you know if your level and not, and for some reason, when they lost their airspeed indicator, they then lost all faith in the entire fucking system. And the nervous Nelly Guy who wanted to climb, you know, above the storm play, he wanted to fly at the absolute height. He's immediate instinct was he started pulling the, or moving the joystick back. And if you lose all faith in your instruments and you, and you don't have any horizon to look at, you don't know where the fuck you're at.

Speaker 1:          00:54:50       And this dude was panicking so he pulled the stick back too far and it got to the point where they were going to stall.

Speaker 6:          00:54:57       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:54:58       And I forget, it's such a long fucking article and it's really involved. So he, they start, the other guy starts going, no, what are you doing? What are you doing? Do this, do this. And he starts moving his thing and then that the computer is going dual input, meaning that they're both moving the fucking thing. So they start going up and down and they basically, the fucking nervous Nelly, he pulls it all the way back and they start feeling the, the airplane starts rocking and that's that point where you're going to stall.

Speaker 6:          00:55:28       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:55:28       Because at that point, the air foil is so far back, you're going to lose lift and it's, the air is just tumbling over the tea. It's like all of a sudden now you might as well have a fucking two pieces of plywood, like flying into the fucking wind. So they start losing altitude. So they see that they're losing altitude, they're basically starting to fall out of the fucking sky.

Speaker 1:          00:55:54       Um, and what kills me is in part of this, as they started to drop, they started to basically fall out of the fucking sky and not recognizing the sound of, of, of basically as the, is the air's rolling over the fucking win over the wings there that they were starting, they were going to stall. They were so in their head looking at the fucking screens going, what the fuck this, this thing's going haywire. Where are we? They panicked and this fucking guy kept pulling back. He pulled back the fucking joy so far. They almost got to get to a 46 degree angle. They said it was so far back that the computer didn't even recognize that as an input that would be possible because no one would do it. So it stops saying, stall that thing that you know or pull up, pull up. It's still not, I wouldn't say pull up there. It stopped warning that they were going to stop. So then it got quiet and that literally just falling out of the fucking sky. They were falling it like, like 10,000 feet per minute at one point. Okay, so do the fucking math. They're like 36,000 feet up to falling 10th that you've got three minutes before you're gonna hit the deck. Right? So these fucking guys,

Speaker 1:          00:57:04       that one guy goes, no level of the nose level to know. So he goes to level it off from 46 degrees to start bringing it back down to something that the computer could actually understand. And as he brings it down again, it starts going stall, stall, stall. So he pulled back again. So it would stop saying that shit. And then they're, they're calling the captain and the captain finally goes up there and now he's come in in the middle of this fucking crisis. He doesn't know what's going on. He had, they, he at no point was informed that the pito tube was frozen. And at this point they had lost so much altitude that they were down into warmer air in it and an unfroze and it was, the airspeed indicator was actually fucking working, but they had no faith in it. And these guys were basically falling out of the fucking sky. And this is the scariest thing when they get to 12,000 feet. That was the last moment that they had where they could have just pushed the joystick forward and started a dive and that they will at the speed that they were falling, that they would have had enough time to try to restart those engines and fucking pull back up again, you know, and basically buzz the surface of the fucking water. And, um, they kept falling. They were fallen at one point 15,000 feet.

Speaker 3:          00:58:21       Okay.

Speaker 5:          00:58:21       Permitted. And uh, the whole thing, they just basically pancaked into the ocean in a perfectly good airplane because they're pido tubes froze. And because they panicked and because I guess most of their hours is just sitting there letting something else fly the fucking plane. I'd never heard of this story. Uh, I believe it's in Vanity Fair. I can, I can't believe I just said all this shit and I can't even tell you. And I'm, and of course I'm reading this on a, uh, on a flight and I remember at the end of my flight, this baby's face looking dude gets out. Um, baby face to me, I'm 46. He looked like he wasn't even 30 and he, oh, he's doing this simple flight, San Francisco to La. Nice quick flight. But whatever. Yeah, we were flying commercial airline, we were flying all the way up there and uh, but it was during the day.

Speaker 5:          00:59:15       So that was one thing that was actually keeping me calm. I'm like, even if the pedal tubes where the frees up the sky can still see the horizon. Um, but anyways, man, it was absolutely terrifying. And they were writing the dialogue or the shit that they were saying and every input that they would like, describe what the plane was doing, what they should've done, and then they would then they would write out the dialogue of what they did and what they said, and I'm telling you to do. My fucking heart was in my throat. Um, so for someone who flies all the fucking time, you know, that wasn't a very fun article to be reading. Um, shit, I got to end this fucking podcast. I didn't even get into any of the questions for this week. A really, really quickly, the Patriots came back against the Bengals and a, I know a lot of people now we're going to go all the way to the other side.

Speaker 5:          01:00:00       Oh, they're gonna win the Super Bowl. Um, I don't think the Patriots were the team that lost to the chiefs and I don't think they, they were necessarily that team last night. I think there's somewhere in the middle. I'm hoping they're more towards the team that beat the Bengals. But I think we got a couple more brutal losses in us. Um, you saw what happened when Reavis went down, and I hate to say it, but he gets injured a lot. Um, the second he got injured, these fucking scored him. God Damn. Two, three plays. But you know what's amazing about Darrelle? Revis even the fact that he's on our fucking team and then I'm actually cheering for that guy who I couldn't, I always respected, but I hate him because he was a jet. He's only 29 years old. I had no idea. It seems like he's been in the league forever and he also looks like he's like 37.

Speaker 5:          01:00:46       Um, all right, let's, uh, let's plow ahead and the jets. Jesus Christ. Jts Jess just jets. They're in a fucking bad way, man. They are in a bad God damn way. I didn't see that one. I, I watched the cowboys Texans, which was a great game, won and I saw a little bit of the bills game. Big Win for them. How about the Cleveland browns coming back? Um, and also the saints. A lot of great games. It was one o'clock games. We'll fucking insane this week. But uh, I got a plow ahead here. Let me just read some of your questions and then I'll get out of here. I'm Aussie with an idea. Bill, how about you shooting your next special in Australia? You draw huge crowds here. And when was the last time someone shot a special down here? Um,

Speaker 1:          01:01:28       you know what a I did this last one down south. I kind of like taping them a different place. I don't know how to fuck. What kind of cameras do you guys have over there? Do you guys make movies over there? Do you wait for us to make them for you? That would be my big question. Do you have the latest in fucking the technology? Cause then maybe you know, maybe I would die. Wasn't hey bill, why don't you get on a plane and fly 14 hours and have jet lag and then do your fucking special? I'm not going to do that. I will definitely be torn your country though. We're looking at January. Um, all right car dear Billy oil rag. I want to get an old car and learn to fix it. Every time I asked someone what make and model year I should buy, they give me horrible answers.

Speaker 1:          01:02:10       Can you please narrow it down to two or three cars from the late sixties to the early mid seventies? That would be a great car to work on. I know there are a ton of just looking for a place to start. I have a little experience with parts and repair, but not a lot. That's why I want to dive right in and learn. Thanks. Uh, well look, you want to call it you want to you will you I would ask, uh, Christopher Titus, he could give you that answer, but I would tell you what I would do if I was you. All right? What I would do is I would buy an old fucking engine, all right? That would buy, I buy that fucking thing that you did. Whatever that engine mount thing is that you can have non engine mount that thing where you can just have it on a rotisserie. All right. And I would take that entire fucking thing apart and rebuild that engine. All right. I might even do that a couple of fucking times just so I got it down so that that's how I would learn. Don't go out and go buy a whole new, a whole fucking car. Just go buy a fucking engine.

Speaker 6:          01:03:16       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:03:16       Just take the, you know, what would you do? You'd be remove the carburetor, then you've got the intake manifold, then you've got the valve covers and you got the valves. Take all of that shit off.

Speaker 6:          01:03:29       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:03:29       Then you're down to your fucking year, your Pistons. Right. I'm not good with the electrical or anything like that, but you go all the way. Do you know the cam shaft all the way down to the crank shaft and if you just start over, even if you just put the thing back to fucking gether with the old shit, although probably they'll probably have a problem trying to get some of the shit off. You might break something, but I would just do that.

Speaker 6:          01:03:50       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:03:51       And I would buy, if you could buy a four cylinder. I look at it the same way I learned how to tune drums. You start with the smallest drum that had the fewest amount of Lug. So it was easier to tune because you couldn't make that many mistakes. So I would actually, if I, if you can't buy an old four cylinder engine at a junkyard, I would buy an old six cylinder. Then you only get six cylinders you've got to worry about, or you could just buy the eight cylinder and then you've got to do everything eight fucking times and you're going to be that much better at it. And I think once you fucking tear down an engine and then just build the thing back up, even if he did it a couple, two, three times. Um, I mean I think that that's the way to go two or three times just by an old engine, by the whole fucking kit on how to replace everything. Go through the hell of fucking getting it apart and shipping stuck and frozen and all goop together. Get that whole fucking thing torn apart and then rebuild the thing, make all your fucking mistakes. And then do it again and then do it again and then do it again and then do it again and then go out and buy the fucking car you want to buy.

Speaker 6:          01:04:54       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:04:55       You know, I mean, dude, you can buy an old piece of shit fucking engine for a couple of hundred bucks and then go buy. What did I forget how much I was going to do this if I ever had fucking time on my life? I think that that's the way to go about doing it, rather than buying a whole God damn car that's going to have all kinds of other fucking problems. If you just learn how to do basically the heart of the goddamn engine, I really feel like all of a sudden

Speaker 5:          01:05:18       the rest of the car is not going to be nearly as intimidating. Um, maybe the transmission could get a little la a little scary, but that's another thing to go out. Buy a fucking transmission, take it apart, rebuild it, put it back together. Do it again. Do it again. Do it again.

Speaker 6:          01:05:34       Okay.

Speaker 5:          01:05:35       Sorry. The battery just crapped out on me there and now I'm fucking late and I got to get going here. So yeah, that's what I would do if, uh, if you want to learn how to, you know, how to fix up a car, I mean that's, that's, that's basic. What I would do maybe if, you know, if people who are into cars gearheads out there, if he, if he know a better way to go about it, um, which I'm sure you do. Um, but that's basic what I would do and a, but if you aren't going to buy a car, man,

Speaker 6:          01:06:01       okay.

Speaker 5:          01:06:01       I don't know. I would, I would maybe one of those cars that I always had the slant six and everybody says like, the greatest engine isn't the easiest thing to work on. You know, everything's like right in a row. All the spark plugs, all of that stuff is like right there. Um, I would work with dodge darts, I think usually had those, the lower level models. I don't know. I'm not, I don't know, cars to that level, but, uh, that is on a mom, you know, I would like to do that at some point. Just take apart a whole engine and then rebuild it and put it back together. Even if I didn't put it in something, just sell it or something and give it to somebody else. Um, because I think that's cool as hell. The Nora do something like that. If I just had the fucking time in my life.

Speaker 5:          01:06:42       And speaking of time, I don't have any time here, so I got to a, I gotta jump off here. Thanks to everybody listened to the podcast and thanks to everybody in San Francisco. That was ridiculous. The amount of people that showed up. Um, I had a great time and I appreciate you guys listening to the new material is I'm working it out as I have a new special, as I mentioned before, coming out on Netflix December 5th called, I'm sorry you feel that way. And, um, oh, by the way, my, uh, new, uh, comedy album, vinyl, um, live and Andrew's house is available for purchase on my website and a, for those of you would like to donate to this podcast and easy way to do it is if you're going to buy something on Amazon, uh, just swing by [inaudible] Dot com first click on the podcast page, click on the link and I'll, it's a bit of a pain in the ass.
