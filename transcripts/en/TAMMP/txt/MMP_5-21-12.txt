Speaker 1:          00:00:01       Hey, what's going on? It's bill burn. It's the Monday morning podcasts for Monday. Uh, the hell month is it? May 21st, 2012. What's going on? How are you? Did you have a nice weekend? Are you looking for, it's a memorial day. Do my buddy's got a fucking boat kid? We're going to get out there with some fucking boy. Wise's dude, guys weekend. Fuck the ladies. Um, yeah, that's coming up right? I had no idea. I had no idea that next week was a three day weekend. You know, because I'm a comedian. Every week's a three day weekend, you know, I don't have shit to do. I just sit around now. Actually, I've been working my ass off. I just did. You know, I didn't, but I've got offered to do another episode of a, of Glee. They liked what I did so much last season. It's a possibility. It's not a definite, all right, so I'm already a going to my vocal coach, you know, just working out some songs, you know, I'm a dreamer or does it go, you know, they probably turn that into like a melody, right?

Speaker 1:          00:01:20       They'd start singing that and then they'd go into another one. Right? I had to run away. Hi Mca. Why do they always do that? And then the crowd always goes, oh my God, it's a different, I didn't see that. They, Dave, they connect all those Sears. I have both those songs on my iPod and I just never saw how they connected. It took a bunch of twinkle toes and a cafeteria to show them. They're always singing in a cafeteria. What is the deal with that? What's the deal with gay people? Sooner? Goober. Dude. Is there something for my, yeah, my gay listeners out there. Do you guys, do you guys feel the need to sing whenever you're in a cafeteria? Is that what it is? You know, come up to the football players. Semi bent at the waist. Snapping your fingers, moving your arms vertically, don't you? Of course you don't, right? Isn't that TV's version of what you do? You just like us. You're looking for a closet to rub one out. Okay. Except you thinking different shit. See that? Bringing people together on the podcast. Speaking of a singing, I'm going to order this thing. You guys know that I hate country music. You know, I, I liked the oldest shit. I don't like the new stuff where they just pander to their audience. You know what I mean? I lock America puppies, you know, lock it. We're going to put a boot in your ass or whatever that fucking jerk off is with the hat pulled down over his face. Almost like he's ashamed of what he's singing.

Speaker 2:          00:03:05       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:03:06       Ah, what the fuck is, wow. What the hell is his name is? Oh, Toby, Keith, Toby, Keith, that guy. All right. He always has that hat pulled down low. You know, he's a man yet he's wearing chaps. I like that guy, that guy. And he's got, he's a Lotta Lotta Lotta like contradictions, you know what I mean? He's like, you know, rough and tumble guy, yet he's wearing chaps, like the guy in the village people and uh, he looked like a racist yet. His first name is Toby, you know, which I think is a shout out to roots. So you know, I can't figure that guy out. Um, anyways, so I was watching this a risk commercial. They had like 150 of of a country music's greatest duets, you know, a lamb, Dell apartment, Conrad Twitty. That was the only guy I found creepy. I don't know if he was nervous that he was on TV, but he would not move a fucking muscle on his face.

Speaker 1:          00:04:07       And he had this just as big fucking, I don't know, pork shoulder fucking head, you know what I mean? Like if he had shoulder of Bison, like the size that he had a big fucking, you know, just 40 years before P90x no guy was doing cardio. Right. All you doing is yanking your fucking pants up or pushing them down and he's singing some fucking song about some girlies with, I can't, I can't remember how the whole metal he went. But it was something to the effect of being a locking tail when I hold you let, you'd never been this far before, something like that. It was, she had something to do with him holding this trembling virgin in his arms as he sat there with this fucking 600 yard stare, like he's waiting for Charlie to come over the fucking wire, you know? Um, or let, like maybe he was like confessing to being a sexual Predator and like, he was just waiting for the FBI to come out and just arrest him in the middle of singing that song. You know, like after a while you just want to get caught. Isn't that something that they do? I'm not saying that he's a sex offender. I wouldn't say that. All I can say is before he got his perm, he looked like one, you know, he had that Elvis just going straight back, but just a giant fucking head. Just a huge head. Um, you know, he looked like he looked like he was already murdered and was fished out of a lake.

Speaker 2:          00:05:46       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:05:47       Just a fucking bloated, gigantic head and he wasn't moving. He looked like dead dead fucking thing on the other first men in black. Oh, right, Bill. We got it. He's got an awful head. Well, fuck you. I got a whole hour to fill here. I'm only six minutes in, so you do it, Huh? And your cubicle. Somebody sent me the creepiest, creepiest, yeah. Email last week. They said, hey, you know, did you ever know anybody who jerked off in a cubicle.dot. Dot. Well, now you do. You know, and it's not that he jerked off in a cubicle. It's the fact that he emailed me his name, his email, all of that shit. It's just like,

Speaker 1:          00:06:32       I mean, uh, you're playing a dangerous game. Maybe you want to get caught, sir. Is that what it is? Do you habitually jerk off and you're fucking cubicle? What if that went to the wrong person? What if you sent that to your boss? And he just got done yelling at you saying, you need to need to show some initiative in 20 minutes later, you know, he gets an email from you. And he's like, all right, maybe, uh, maybe it finally stuck and I don't have to fire this guy. And he opens it up and he says, hey, did you ever know anybody jerked off in a cubicle.dot. Dot. Well, now you do.

Speaker 3:          00:07:02       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:07:03       Maybe meant to send it to his boss. I mean, that was his way of going out, you know, just fucking impregnated his laptop and walked out. Nah, there's no way he did that. How could you ever get another job? There's no way around that. Um, anyways, it's Monday morning and I'm doing the podcast and for new listeners, I know what you're thinking. Well, I live in fucking a Scandinavia and it's not Monday morning over here, but listen, I don't care. I don't give a fuck. The only Monday morning I care about is in my time zone. It's nine 17 in the morning. All right. Those douchebags on those morning shows are still on being Sassy, showing spunk. You know, those are all morning words, you know what I mean? Nobody has get up and go at 6:00 PM. Right. That's all. That's all 6:00 AM shit. Uh, she, she's just a firecracker, right? Nobody says that if 5:00 PM Ron quit and tech, you know, we got just, well, why do I these, you know what this podcast is just to be me stating the fucking obvious. Um, how much for a drive yesterday and my Prius,

Speaker 1:          00:08:16       um, somebody, actually, some are redneck guy, was talking to me about my Prius go and you know them things ain't, oh no, they don't do anything for the environment. You realize that don't you? I mean them batteries and batteries, they putting them cars, you know, long it takes for them to break down. Ooh, let me tell you they're doing that. They're actually, they're actually doing more damage there and then I can have a regular gas combustion, Corey, you know, telling me all that shit. You know what I mean? Half of it's true. The other half, he's like making up as he's going along, you know, almost like he's talking about the big game. Then he never played in, in high school, but there's no one around that he went to school with. So now he's quarterback. Right. And a, I know it, a lot of people listening right now gone. That's actually true. All right. I don't give a fuck. Okay. I never said I was saving the planet. Did I? I don't think I did. I probably did. I'm hypocritical. Um,

Speaker 3:          00:09:11       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:09:12       I see it. There's nothing you could, everybody should be, you know, if there was the right amount of human beings on this planet, we could all drive tanks and it would have no effect on the ozone layer. Alright? That's my new philosophy. Stop trying to make cars, have better gas mileage. Tried to have less people driving them.

Speaker 3:          00:09:32       Okay?

Speaker 1:          00:09:32       Oh Jesus. Is this my final solution? So many fucking people. People. That's what the problem is. All right. It ain't the cars. Cars don't kill the ozone layer of people do. Um, anyways, I get them into the biggest, dumbest fucking fight last night with my girl. Right? We had this great day. You know, it was on the road again. I could do, do, do, do up above. Oh, hear that. Hear that

Speaker 1:          00:10:09       you that bump up bub bub bub. That's what I have to have it on. If for some reason that that noise that alert on my phone doesn't freak out my dog, but every other sound on it freaks out my dog and it starts fucking shaking like a goddamn junkie. And a, that is an embarrassing tone to have when you're walking around with your friends, you know, and it always comes on when you're in the middle of some story that you're exaggerating what you really did. So I walk up to the guy and I'm like, no buddy. Fuck you. You want to take a fucking swing here? I'll give you the first punch right here. Body pump, pump pump, pump, pump. Yeah, no, fuck it. Then it goes down the Goddamn damn toilet. Um, so anyways, the hell did we do yesterday?

Speaker 3:          00:10:55       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:10:56       Oh, we went out to Brunch, right? I had already eaten breakfast, so she got a brunch and I got up here and uh, some guy next to me with the big red beard. He'd been growing it for like nine years. It was like Zz top level, I think a little bit longer. It was like reverse crystal Gayle, you know, like don't like the guy version of it up as a redhead and uh, so whatever. And then I'm like, Hey, you know, let's go for a drive. She's like, I want to go to some shops. Let's just walk down the street, you know that, and they grab your arm and you're just sitting there, you know, walking down the street,

Speaker 1:          00:11:33       just thinking what have I just elbowed him in the ribs and ran across the street, you know, right there, that fucking bar now was actually a good time. And then after that it was like, you know, I will always fly out lax and I always see the beach and up in Malibu and Santa Barbara and all that type of shit. And I'm like, you know, it's, I sh we should fucking shut that part of the city out. So we drive over there and the Prius, that's not saving the environment, but getting great gas mileage, great gas mileage. Um, and we fucking get up there and what a bunch of Douche bags up there. All right. I got to shut my phone off. What the fuck? Bump. Bump. What the hell is it? You know what, that's just going to go off in the background.

Speaker 3:          00:12:15       Yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:12:16       we put it on mute here. Don't you wish there was a mute button for people? What's the deal? Um, yes, we go up there. What a bunch of cons. What a bunch of cons live in fucking Malibu. I want to go up there and I was trying to find like their town center, I don't even know if they have one or what, but every, it's all gated communities to keep out the riff raff. Like me, I can't even drive by and just look at their houses, you know? So what happened? Whenever we're having a good time, we drive back, we're going through the canyons. I pull over on the side of the road, we buy strawberries off some guy who claims to be an organic farmer, right? Privately stolen from a trader Joe's who gives a shit, right?

Speaker 1:          00:12:56       Everything's going great. So I stay in, take a night off from comedy and I say, Hey, why don't we watch, why don't we watch your movie? You know what I mean? Cap Off this wonderful fucking day. Everything's going great. What could go wrong? This is like the beginning of a horror movie where they just show like the perfect family and everything's great and people are wearing like white linen, you know? And then all of a sudden they just start showing the camera and the bushes like a POV of like Mike Myers. This is basically what happens. So 60 minutes comes on, right? Who doesn't want to watch that show and pretend they're smart? You know, I like it some more Morley safer comes on and you know, we smells like an old person. Some old people don't smell like old people, but he looks like he smells like an old person, you know, smells of cigars, ash trays, you know, couple of wars, maybe a date rape. Um, so he's interviewing Meryl Streep. All right. The Great Meryl Streep when they're going through all our own oral frigging life and all the movies and all the different characters that she's played. Oh, first of all, they start, they start the report off with Morley safer just sitting there. Right. Smelling a fucking Ben Gay in Whiskey, right? And he says, how, you know,

Speaker 1:          00:14:17       wow, over in England, you know, they, you know, I dunno, they make their, their actors, they, they award them by calling them lords and they night them. But over here in America, all we do is just give him the shiny statue and it's just like, starts off right off the bat for some reason just shitting on America. I don't know why like an Oscar is somehow beneath,

Speaker 3:          00:14:42       okay

Speaker 1:          00:14:43       sir. Uh, Anthony Michael Hall. I mean, or, or Lord, what it Lord of what, what are what

Speaker 3:          00:14:52       lease. You can fucking hold our statue, your lord of what kingdom, that phony horse shit that you have with Prince Charles and the popper or whatever the fuck is going on over there. You know, look up the Rothschilds night you over there, then that fucking means something. Then you can come become part of their yacht. Convoy is they go around the world figuring out how to take over another currency, right? Then you're in with them, okay. But if you're, if you're fucking, you know, Lord of this and your, your wing man is the Duke of Elton John. I mean that's the whole thing is fucking stupid, right? So right off the bat, it's already bugging me. But I know Nia hates when I talk to the TV, right? So, you know, I keep my big fucking Yap shut and they start talking about Meryl Streep up a Papaya, gone through the whole thing.

Speaker 3:          00:15:39       And then I'm the old guy there smelling of a, you know, prescription meds goes, uh, you know, whenever they talk about the roles you play, they always say, you know, he play independent minded women, very strong women and Merrill goals. I know that's, yeah, that's what they say. You know, when a guide, they never say to a guy, oh, you're playing a strong willed character, Yadda Yadda Yadda. I let that go. Whatever, no biggie. I'll take that. It's probably true. The fuck do I know I'm not a woman. Right. But then they show her after she played Margaret Thatcher, and she's given a speech to a bunch of women's young girls and she's trying to inspire them and she, she takes a quote from Margaret Thatcher. It was something along the lines of, if you want a bunch of people to talk around, talk is standing around talking about doing something, you know, something a go, yeah, you got to talk to men, but if you want it to actually get done, you got to get a woman. And then all the chicks go, whoo, like flipping out. Right? So I laughed and I'm like, Yay. Reverse sexism. Right. Just seeing, you know,

Speaker 1:          00:16:47       my, my whole fucking theory, how everybody is just a piece of shit. You just don't have the power to act out what the fuck you want to do because that, that right there, if you flip that around as a guy, if you're running for president, it's fucking over. He can't be like, let me tell you. I'll tell you what, after I get you jobs and after I fixed this economy, okay. And I'm the man to do it because I'll tell you right now, if you're looking for someone to stand around and talk about doing something, you get a woman. You want to get it done. You got to get a man, here are my nuts right here on the podium, volt from me, November 4th go fuck yourself. Right? You did that. Your presidential campaigns over. She does it. It's fucking adorable. And it's just this fucking ignorant, you know what I mean? What a fuck do you get off saying that we stand around and do nothing. Meryl Streep. Ah, or quoting Margaret and youtube. Margaret Thatcher

Speaker 1:          00:17:42       me tastes you bitches something. Alright, we faked a fucking lunar landing. Okay. You think that's just talking. Anybody can land on the fucking moon. That's easy. But to pretend you did it all right and get everybody to shut the fuck up about it. That, that, that, that right there, that takes skill. So whatever. So I make that little comment and um, did I just go with that? That, that, that, that, that's the only fucking porky pig. So, so I make that comment and like, you know, I've been with Nia long enough that I can tell by the side of her face when she's just thinking about like, what if I just grabbed everything I really cared about and walked out of this house right now. She got like that fucking mad at me, you know? And I'm like, she's just like right after the story was over, she just shut the fucking thing off. And uh, I don't happen to, cause now I'm walking to seven 11 to get some ice cream. I haven't, I've not even, what happened was all going great. You know, I might be asshole there. What am I? Am I supposed to just fucking sit there with my mouth hanging open with drill coming out when I watch TV, if somebody says something Douchey, I'm not supposed to say it.

Speaker 3:          00:18:54       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:18:54       Yeah, whatever, whatever. So I just finally just said, you know what? Fuck this. I take the dog out. I go around the block. What do I do? I'm calling my guy friends, right? They're all backing me up. I'm not saying who I called, I don't name names. Right. And they're all laughing their ass off and they 100% agree with me, which is all I'm looking for at this point. I just want people to say that I'm right. I don't want to learn anything from this experience. Just tell me I was right so I can be an ignorant ass again. I don't know. Why don't you guys weigh in on that? Am I a Dick for saying that? Should I just let that one go? You know? Ah You know what she said? That fucking drove me up the wall. She goes, why are you, she didn't seem intimidated. She used one of those words.

Speaker 1:          00:19:41       Why you threatened by what she said. It's like I'm not threatened. I Yeah Jesus Christ. Then I take the bait, you know it just sends me right over day like threatened about what? Oh my God, this person that I don't know who has never called me nor will ever call me, who has no effect on my life. How do you get threatened by that? I'm just calling it for the bullshit that it is, cause you know what? This is what fucking drives me nuts. I can't stand when somebody tells me that they're shit sandwich tastes worse than my shit sandwich. Okay, go fuck yourself. At what point am I supposed to have empathy as I'm sitting here eating the shit sandwich and you're telling me how much worse your yours, yours, this, you know, at the end of the fucking day. You know what I mean?

Speaker 1:          00:20:26       Sure. Mine might be on a, you know, a better slice of bread, which I guess would make it taste a little bit better, but at the end of the fucking day, right the end of the fucking day. All right, I'm going to end up in a FEMA camp with you. Okay? You think when the next fucking psycho comes along, I'm going to make the cut. What the fuck do I, what do I bring to the world? Huh? Exactly. I'll be standing right next to you. So go fuck yourself. You just fucking woman. Every time she sneezes, they give her another God damn award. She's still pitching. Still fucking bitching. You know it's rough. I remember when I did this Oscar nominated part. Oh go fuck yourself with your wigs. The whole thing. Just, you know, that's what fucking pisses me off when I watched this shit. If you really want to know my perspective is from where I come from, I can't bitch about shit cause everybody's like, oh go fuck yourself. You hit the lottery. Right. But I got to sit here and listen to you bitch. Even if you fucking killing it, even if you're killing it, you know Yale School of drama and he's still up on the bull. Go Fuck yourself with your God damn yachts. All right, there you go. That felt good. It was probably ignorant, but whatever. Um, all right, let's get to a, and let's get some advertising now that I trashed. Um, Lord Meryl Streep. What did, what does she call, is she a prince princess? Is that what it is?

Speaker 4:          00:21:53       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:21:54       You know what, if I ever get to that fucking level, which God knows I'm not going to cause you have to have an unbelievable body of work by the time you're my age.

Speaker 4:          00:22:04       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:22:04       You know, to even remotely have a shot and then they're not going to give it to you until you're like fucking 60. So that's a, that's out, that's out the door. That's like when I wanted to go to Notre Dame when I was in high school, I wanted to go to that college and by my sophomore year, I knew that that dream was over. And so the same goes for ever getting knighted, but let's just say for some fucking reason, they lowered the standards and I get knighted. Right.

Speaker 4:          00:22:35       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:22:36       Um, or asked to be knighted. Like that's some shit I'm not showing up. Why would you show up for that? You know, do, do you want to, do you want to get knighted in our a fake kingdom? You know, uh, I dunno, but who am I gonna get knighted by fucking, I'm mister McFeely. Is that what I'm going to do? A, you're fucking Weirdos.

Speaker 4:          00:22:56       Okay.

Speaker 4:          00:23:13       Okay.

And everybody, you know, everybody going in there taking carburetors out and uh, radiators and shit. He looks like he's missing some stuff. You know, Princess Di was hot though. She was hot. She had big feet though. Didn't she had big feet right now of losing anybody gay listening to this. Right. That's like their, uh, that's there. Jesus. I think, isn't it that a fucking why do I try?

They turned them sideways and it became fuel injected. I don't even know what the fuck's going on. This guy, Eric, the car guy, you know, I'm telling you, if you're a moron like me, if you just watch this guy after a while you start going like, I could do that. I could unplug all that shit. And yanked that engine out of the car. Same thing with El Cheapo digits to fucking awesome channels. And a, I probably watched just about all of their videos at this point. Um,

Speaker 4:          00:29:11       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:29:12       Like what's his face, Eric? The car guy. Watch that guy like for like an hour.

Speaker 1:          00:29:17       Hour's worth of video is a 45 minutes with the videos. I'm watching them change a water pump on a 2002 Chevy cavalier or something. What the hell? It was, um,

Speaker 1:          00:29:32       unreal and, but you just keep watching it and after awhile I swear to God, it's like you start to Geek, you start building your confidence. Now there's no fucking way I would try do that on my car. All right. But some other stuff that outskirts and going into it a little bit wouldn't be that bed. So there you go. All right, let's get back. Let's get back to the podcast. Everybody. Um, oh, by the way, real quick. Guess who's going to be performing in Burbank, California? Huh?

I'd love you guys come down and I'm gonna be trying out some new stuff while also playing some classics. How about that? You like dead.

Speaker 1:          00:30:22       You want an overrated for this week? Overrated. Underrated. He's overrated. A napkin holder, napkin holder. Overrated. They don't fucking work. All right. You want to make money selling something for 1995 late at night. Why don't you come up with a fucking Napkin holder that works. All right. This is the problem. If you don't put enough napkins in there, gravity takes over and they fucking fall out of the thing. So you've got to always have to put too many in there. So then as you go to pull them out, they start tearing. Then you always got to grab like 40 of 'em out. Take one out and stick the other thing. And you might wanna just leave it in that plastic hunk of shit.

Speaker 1:          00:30:57       Really? Bill, what are you really mad at? Oh go fuck yourself. So this is a rough week for me. You know what? What am I up to here? How much, how much time is left in class? 31 minutes. All right. We're at the halfway point. Good. I go to the bathroom. Can I relieve my bottles? Um, no you can't. You have to sit here and listen to me pontificate about this bullshit that I stopped caring about the third year I taught it. How do high school teachers do that? Teach the same material over and over again. You know, wonder why they always have their hands in their pockets, you know, rubbing that balls. Just trying to do anything.

Speaker 4:          00:31:32       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:31:32       Make it more, I don't know, stimulating for him. All right, Bill, you're not stupid is what this call is. What's this called? Is is what this is called bill. I've been listen to your podcast for the past two months and I honestly don't think you're stupid at all. Just the mere fact, sir, that you have to defend me. You know, if the gloves don't fit, um, you give great advice and it's not just some hollow cookie cutter bullshit. I Dunno about your educational background, but you have an excess of common sense and wisdom. Uh, if I have an issue, I will definitely bring it to you and hopes that you have advice for me. Anyone who thinks you're retarded is just covering up their retardation by taking it out on you. Keep that shit up. Thank you, sir. You know what? That was all good to your last two sentences and then everyone just realized that you had the same intellect I do. Which is why you don't think I'm dumb.

Speaker 4:          00:32:30       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:32:30       Anyone who thinks you're retarded is just covering up their retardation by taking it out on you. Keep that shit up, dude. You Ain't fucking stupid. Keep that fucking shit up. I appreciate that, sir. All right, let's talk sports. All right. At the risk of having all the fucking people got picked last in gym class, wine to me on Twitter, it's somebody's yet another person threatened to unfollow me on Twitter if I didn't stop tweeting about sports threatening. You know, if you don't stop talking about sports, I'm going to stop. I'm, I might stop listening to you. I don't give a fuck.

Speaker 1:          00:33:14       Maybe Meryl Streep is right. I think women just unfollow. You guys sit in there, they talk about it. Um, this is my prediction for the, uh, for the NBA. I think the spurs are gonna win it all. You know why the Spurs play basketball? The way your dad fights, you know he's, your dad is too old to fuck around. Okay. He's just going to end it with the fucking throat shop is just sitting there trying to do some Floyd Mayweather shit that you saw on TV. Okay. That's what's happening to the La Clippers right now. I don't even know if they're still, even if they got swept or not, it was three, three, zip last I saw watching them. They would just do it. You know the fucking clippers. They're out there. Lake Boom, trying to throw fucking alley. Oops. And Shit. Goddamn spurs are sitting in, half of them are fucking bald. It just sitting there picking and rolling them to do

Speaker 4:          00:34:09       death.

Speaker 1:          00:34:12       You know, every 14 year old kid at some point squares off with his dad. Like, all right, I've had enough of your shit. Old Man. Right. And what does he do? Fucking hit you with some shitty learned in the navy and it's over in two seconds. You sitting there watching the UFC and rolling around on the Mat thinking you know some shit. You don't. All right,

Speaker 4:          00:34:32       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:34:32       This is the thing about old guys. They're very fucking efficient. Tim Dunkin doesn't have time for your fucking bullshit. All right? He's going to score as many as he needs to and then he's going to expression with no expression on his face. He's going to walk off the court as you sit there scratching your young, full head of hair, wondering what the fuck just happened. All right. I know a lot of people are thinking, uh, possibly, uh, Oklahoma City who, I love that team, but a, I'm telling you, I think the spurs are going to do it. Um, and I've actually, because uh, I was just in a part of the country where they weren't showing any of the hog or I couldn't, I was in a hotel room and I couldn't get any of the hockey. Every time I was working it was on and I missed it.

Speaker 1:          00:35:16       But I kept catching the basketball games. And I've actually, uh, NBA hoop is way better, way fucking better than I've been given a credit for. The games have been great. And actually in the end, even with the timeouts and all the files, shots does a ton of drama. It is a great sport. You know what it is? I think it's just regular season games when like playing fucking Toronto and they're doing that timeout, timeout shit. I think I judged them on the regular season, which is what a lot of people do with hockey. Right. Who's kitten hopes? So my bed. All right. I have to apologize for that NBA hoop is actually the shit. I'm actually, uh, I'm, I'm back into it and I really want to see the spurs, you know, throat shop, Oklahoma City after they finish off the fucking Lakers. And by the way, though, how right am I about pog with salt? If you ever seen a fucking face like that when he gets called for a foul or if they led a, I saw one where he didn't touch the ball and they said it was a Oklahoma's ball because they claimed it went off him. Dude, his fucking face. I'm telling you.

Speaker 5:          00:36:26       Ooh.

Speaker 1:          00:36:30       And then when he'd dunks it, he's fucking, you know, acting like he's in the Wu Tang clan. That's not who you are. Paul was Saul.

Speaker 5:          00:36:39       Oh Woo.

Speaker 1:          00:36:45       Oh, am I going to enjoy watching them fucking loose? But even as a Celtics fan, I fucking, I love Coby Bryant. That guy is the shit. Um, I saw the, uh, the first Celtics game. You know, I'm bandwagon Celtics. I saw a game one. I saw the highlights of the end of game too. And uh, once again, I was working and I missed three and four. I heard the last game we were up like, like 16 and nothing and still lost the Goddamn game. So I'm going to be watching that one later on tonight. Um, but I'm psyched that the Celtics and sixers are, are playing in the playoffs just because it takes me back to the, the unbelievable. And he has an underrated for you, underrated Boston Celtics, first to Philadelphia, 70 sixers in the early eighties. Those were some of the, the, the greatest wars I saw.

Speaker 1:          00:37:40       Everybody always talks. Celtics Lakers, they forget about the Celtics. 76 years. I remember one year, the sixers were up three games to one, and that was 1981. And uh, we ended up coming back and we, and we beat him for games to three. The next year they go up again, three games to one, then it's three games to two, then it's three games to three games, seven in the Boston Garden. And the sixers came in and were like, fuck this. And they beat the Celtics. And next, I remember that on that week's sports illustrated, the cover was Dr Jay. I still remember it says Julius Jams Jinx. And they had him Duncan and he had this, go fuck yourself. Look on his face. Uh, but the six, I think they lost in the finals to the Lakers. They even made it that far. I can't remember. And then the next year they got Moses Malone in the shit over. And that's the one of the most underrated teams of all times in 1983, Philadelphia, 76 years. I put that team up against anybody. They asked us that classic when they asked Moses Malone, what do you think's going to happen in the playoffs? And he said, full, full, full meaning we're going to sweep everybody think they lost one game. That was the other Celtics got swept by the Milwaukee Bucks to another underrated team. Sidney Moncrief kid. Um, all right. Did that bore you? Did that make you turn off the Goddamn thing?

Speaker 1:          00:39:09       All right. What are we talking about here? All right. Interesting subject. Interesting situation. Hey Bill. I was dating my girlfriend for three years since the end of last summer. We had been on and off. One Week I say I'm done with her and the next week I'm taking her out to dinner. All right. That's codependent. You know what that just says to me? Either you're afraid to be alone or she's fucking the shit out of you. One of the other, uh, we didn't speak for about a month. Then I saw her out with a guy making out with them. I lost my cool and punched the guy. I'm usually a laid back person, but seeing that drove me crazy. I realized that if I continued to play this game with her, I'll lose her. So for the past month, I've been great to her wait time out. Time out. Time out, dude, you already, you saw her in a bar making out with another guy. All right? You, you, you, you got to walk away from this one. This one's over, dude.

Speaker 3:          00:40:09       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:40:10       You guys, you get together, you break up, you're, you're, you're on the outs for a month, then you're back together. You don't want to do this. That's like one of those curtain Courtney fucking, uh, uh, sid vicious kind of fucking relationships. You don't need any punch. This guy in the face. What did that guy do? He's doing what guys are supposed to do. He's trying to get laid. He doesn't know you, right? You punched the wrong person if you ask me, but she can't punch the ladies. So you've got a dumper

Speaker 1:          00:40:39       right before you'd dump or take a really nice, getting a really nice camera and take a picture of a face and then go buy a heavy bag and just put it on that and just go to the fucking ribs. Um, anyways, he goes, I've been great to her dinners, going out with their parents, doing all the little things that she loves. We got close again. So she's been sleeping at my apartment, has been and has been leaving things here and has been asking if she can go, go to my apartment when I'm not there. Dude, if she, if this, this story ends with her bang in some dude in your bed, in your apartment. All right. Then when she sleeps here, she keeps leaving. Well, I already said that one. Blah, blah, blah, blah.

Speaker 1:          00:41:23       Alright. Oh well. Then when she sleeps here, she keeps leaving things here in anticipation for her next sleepover, which is usually the next night. One of my problems has always been that she doesn't give me personal space. So this definitely has been bothering me. Also, I hate making out in public and she loves it. I think it's immature and unnecessary. Last night we were out with my friends and she kept like yelling, let's make out. And I was so annoyed. I said, not right now. She then got off my lap and walked away. She was doing little annoying things like this all night. So, uh, so I left. So now I am very annoyed with this girl and I'm definitely back in. Uh, I don't want to see her stage. Only problem. My Mom's wedding is this Thursday and she's going with me and her parents are invited. So do I pretend that everything is good and continue to lie to her and myself and fake that everything is great.

Speaker 4:          00:42:20       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:42:43       and then you won't be able to go there. And then she, her whole first vibe is she's going to see you with this other girl and you with a scowl on your face. And she's actually gonna feel bad for the girl because of your energy. When you're the God damn victim here as far as I'm concerned. Yeah. Dumper.

Speaker 4:          00:43:00       Okay.

He should have a fucking billboard. He told me one night's these hilarious stories of when he was going to break up with somebody, how he went about it and it was fucking brilliant. Uh, he had had the element of surprise. He was totally prepared. Bing, Bang, boom, go fuck yourself. It was over. It was like a, it was basically the same way a corporation fires a longtime executive. The only thing that's missing with the way Al would break up with somebody with security walking the person out. All right, so email Al Madrigal at minivan. Men just go to that podcast and you'll see a, he'll tell you what to do. He'll tell you how to, I'm telling you what to do, which I think you already know and Al will tell you how to do it. Um, they should really have like courses on that.

Speaker 1:          00:44:29       I don't know why they don't have that, especially for young people when you just don't know how to do it. You know, they should just teach you how to fuck it, do it the most effective way. I think I, I break, I broken up with girls like every possible way from just never calling them again to sitting down and watching them fucking cry their eyes out, which is the fucking worst to, uh, you know, getting dumped myself. I've done all of that shit. I've been the guy where, you know, you know, I think I'm pulling the trigger and then she's like, well good, I don't care. I made out with somebody six months ago, you know, and they, you know, which does hurt, but then also makes you site like, okay, now I'm definitely doing the right thing because I had no clue. You're such, if you have the ability to do something like that and I can't even pick up on it.

Speaker 1:          00:45:22       Like, uh, yeah, your poker face is too fucking dangerous. Um, so anyways, dude, that sucks. But you're going to be site when you go to the wedding and you don't have that fucking lie tied to your ankle. Okay. Macro is just weird. Let's make out like that seems to me. And all your friends are there. There's no like, emotional connection to that. She just wants to, she just wants to like engage in that act. She sounds like she's sort of like an exhibitionist a little bit. Like, you know what, that little thing right there. You know what? I bet that you could, uh, you could probably round third with her in a bar if it was crowded enough, you know, if she was standing up and no one could really see what was going on. She's one of those girls. All right. And uh, you know, to each your own, but uh, that's not the mother your kids, uh, Daddy, tell us how you mad mob.

Speaker 1:          00:46:21       Well, I was finger banging her at a Denny's and I was like, wow. The combination is, and these pigs in a blanket, this must be the one I'm fresh off a date. Hey Bill, I'm writing this directly after getting home from a date. Needless to say, my depression is higher than normal. Uh, I will try to make this as short as possible. In January, I met this girl, this lady, and we really hit it off. We went out for about two weeks and everything seemed great. Then out of nowhere, she stops responding to my texts, slash, calls, et cetera. Yeah, that's one way to do it. Then five months later, she texted me out of nowhere, she's drunk and pretends like nothing happened. She's a psycho and wants to get together again. Mistake. Uh, we went out tonight and we had, we had fun, but the goodbye was fairly awkward realizing that she's sober and you're not the person once again, um, I can't tell if she might be interested, interested in me or if she just bored in one. Is someone around exactly. In any advice for a schmuck like me? Any advice for a schmuck like me? Uh, I don't have any advice. I have a compliment. All right? You actually know what's going on and that's a huge thing. All right? Um, look, this girl is wherever she is in her life, and that's not your fault. You went out on this date with sincerity in your heart. Okay? So you're not a schmuck. All right? You're a patsy. No.

Speaker 2:          00:47:52       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:47:56       I just pictured Lee Harvey Oswald walking into the, uh, you walk in in like Lee Harvey Oswald into the fucking police station with that big knot in your eye. Oh, so on the patsy. So on the, I get it, I'm the guy that this is all getting blamed on doing this. This isn't you. You liked this girl. You thought it was great. She hurt you when she didn't text you back. Five months later she texts you again and you got excited. Then she went out with you because she's, she's trying to figure herself up and she keeps a, you know, coming back into your life, you know, just take, take comfort in this, know that she's miserable and lonely too. All right? You guys aren't right for each other and you're not a schmuck. You're a good guy. All right? You didn't go out there thinking like, I'm going to fuck this chick, you know, and Blah, Blah Blah and all that evil crap that guy's usually think you went out there cause you actually liked her. You're a good guy and there's nothing wrong with that. Okay. Some day. You're going to meet the right girl. This one isn't it, but you're not a schmuck. All right. Just stop looking down at the ground. You know, staring at your fucking shoes

Speaker 1:          00:49:01       as other girls. Right? Fuck her. How's that? Huh? Tell me. Your friends are going to give you better advice than that. Um, all right. Where the hell am I? Why does it keep fucking doing that?

I think I want to try to do just like a new, like 20 minute chunk like some of the shed had been working on and uh, just tell a couple of stories. What did I want to talk about? Oh, I'm going to talk about, uh, sex scenes in movies and why think they're stupid? And that might lead into something, I dunno what, I don't know where I'm going to go with this hour. I mean, I can't really just sit here. Am I really going to dedicate another fucking 20 minutes to ragging on relationships? This gotta be, there's gotta be a left turn in there somewhere. You know, I'm trying out new shit. I'm fucking trying to rebuild this Goddamn carburetor. Just got the parts, uh, the other day. You know what, here's a question for all you gearheads out there. I'm trying to get it. I got the, uh,

Speaker 1:          00:52:25       I got the, uh, what do you call it? The uh, Jesus. I know what the fuck it's called, the fuel bowl. You know, they got the primary and the secondary. I can get both of those off, but then there's that next piece that's behind it, you know, up against the, basically the main body of the carburetor and a, I know there's a gasket on the other side of that. And this thing is really old and it's a piece of shit, so it's really stuck there. So I got a small screwdriver and I'm sorta tapping at it, but I'm worried that I'm going to do damage to the metal and I'm going to have to get it. Machine does. If you have any ideas on how to fucking get it off, I don't want to damage the carburetor. Um, but this is the thing about doing all that type of stuff is uh, there's really no comedy in science. It's just so fucking, you know, reading about the elements and everything. I guess the comedy is how fucking stupid I am or blows your mind or whatever. But like, um, I dunno, I think in a time I'm going to do like four years worth of science classes because I've become obsessed with it. Like my birthday's coming up and I asked Nina to get me this book on, uh, like just a electrical, you know, for houses and that type of stuff because electricity is fucking magic to me. I don't understand it at all. Then I just watched a couple of youtube videos

Speaker 1:          00:53:46       and I, I kinda, I kinda get it now. Like I, I didn't understand like, like this just a power source and all the wires are, are just bringing that electricity. I, you know, I didn't know that's basic to you guys are right. Go Fuck Yourself. What? I give you shit. If he didn't know how to write a joke, I never even thought about any of this stuff. Why is it keeps signing me out of my fucking God damn account

Speaker 1:          00:54:13       signed back in? What is the fucking problem anyways, but I was watching that Eric, the car guy and he was trying to figure out, you know, why? You know, the Dome light and his car was fucked up and a, and I watched him just take the thing off on the side of the car and it's just a little fuse in there and it's just how the whole thing works in it. Actually, it started to make sense. Speaking of Eric, the car guy, he just uploaded another one, Eric decar guy just uploaded another video, a Chevy Tahoe rear shoe replacement.

Speaker 1:          00:54:51       I'm such a fucking psycho. I literally want to get, I want to learn how to weld. I want to learn how to do all this shit. All this shit that it, I don't, my whole fucking life, I watched these guys, I respected what they did, but I always thought like, you know, I remember the kids who took shop class, you know, they were fucking up in every other client. Maybe they just had a gift. I have no idea. You know what it is. You just feel like such a bitch as a guy when you have to bring a, you know, have somebody come up like, you know what, this one actually sometimes I just tap out, like I got to get some screens for a window. One of the windows has like an arch on it, so they go, oh, you got to make like a cardboard cutout of it to measure it like that. I'm like, I'm not fucking doing that. Just come over and do it. Sometimes you just got to tap out. You know, like when it comes to dinner, I can make dinner, but you know, you just got to tell you, you, you, you're a woman to go in there and make it go in there and make me a fucking sandwich. You know what I mean?

Speaker 1:          00:55:45       That's why you're here. I kill it. And then you make it. Except I don't have to kill it anymore. Somebody kills it for me. But I, you know, I bought it. It's the same goddamn thing now. I'm like, I'm like the kingpin, you know, I got this, this fleet of hitman killing cows and fucking chickens in that type of shit. And then they bring it to me, you know, like Al Pachino, I take the tool myself, right? So go in there and prepare it. That's not sexist is it? Um, all right, let's talk about some dates they have coming up. Everybody. This is my whirlwind tour of, uh, of cities. What do we got to hear? What are we going to hear? A San Jose June 15th to the 16th, working with Sacramento's own Chelsea Peretti, um, Ontario, California. I'm going to be at the improv inland empire. June 29th 30th and July 1st they Hampton Beach Ballroom Casino, July 14th and the Newport yacht and set up in Newport, Rhode Island, July 15th.

Speaker 1:          00:56:52       Don't let that yachting center name scare you like you. It's like a $40,000 a plate for Obama's campaign and everybody's going to be there wearing Tuxedos. It's not going to be like that. It's a giant tent in a parking lot in Newport, Rhode Island. All right. You'll get to be able to go down there and be just as dumb and fucking as you would be in any other place. All right, so please come down to that. And uh, let me actually look up. I got a couple others. I got one in Charlotte and one in Jacksonville, Florida that I haven't put up yet. So I'm going to search for this email if you guys could just be patient. Um Oh and I got Cincinnati coming up. There you go. October 19th

Speaker 1:          00:57:41       and 20th. I'm going to be a go bananas and Cincinnati. Bear with me. Bear with me. I'm a blowing through here. Where else? Where else? The comedy zone in Jacksonville, Florida. September 27th, 28th and 29th going to the Jaguar game on that Sunday and I'm going to the Pittsburgh Steelers, Cincinnati Bengals game on the other one. And then the comedy zone in Charlotte, North Carolina. September 13th, 14th and 15th going to the Carolina Panthers game that Sunday. You like that? See, that's how we do the road. Doesn't have to be miserable people. Um, all right. Do we have anything left? I feel like I'm coming up short. This fucking guy's going to be here any minute with the goddamn screens. Oh, 58 minutes. I can tap off. I can leave. Um, all right. You're not stupid. I already read that. Oh, here's something. Here's something a buddy of mine came up with, and this has nothing to do with advertising.

Speaker 1:          00:58:39       This is a friend of mine. I was trying to get an, uh, an iPhone application. He made this new iPhone application. It's a, it's called Word Nair. W. O. R. D. I. N. A. I. R. E. Warden Air. It's a reverse dictionary. So if you think in like a, you know, what's a word for, uh, it'll give you a comprehensive list. Um, God knows I could do something like that cause I'm a fucking moron. Um, all right. Is that the podcast for this week? I think it is. I got a couple more raw, anything else that was going on in my life that I wanted to talk about. Oh, I'll get my truck back today after talking all that shit about learning how to fix stuff. I problems with my brakes and uh, that's not something I'm going to try and do myself. I'll fuck with something that, that after I fuck with it might not make my truck start. I'll fuck with something like that. Like I actually at this point, um, would have the balls to try and change a head gasket to, to put in a new head gasket. You know, my engine, I think, you know,

Speaker 1:          00:59:50       what do I have to do? I just take off the, uh, the air filter housing, you know, take off the carburetor off the manifold. Right. Then I imagine there's some other shit that's in the way, but as long as I take it off, whatever, I probably fuck it up. But the bottom line is nobody would get killed. But when you talk in breaks and that type of Shit, uh, there's no fucking way I'm doing that myself. I'm going to, uh, that was very least would have to have somebody there. So I'm actually getting my truck back today. Um, but yes, I do feel like a little bit of a bitch because I didn't figure it out myself. But you know, fuck you. I'm trying. You want to think about is when you first start to learn how to fix things is the hardest thing I find is not having the balls to just start taking it apart. It's, um,

Speaker 1:          01:00:46       it's the overhead, the amount of fucking money you have to spend in tools, but once you buy him, he got him forever, man. I want, speaking of which member, I bragged that I fixed a blender, it's fucked up. All the lights are coming on. I don't know what I did to it, but uh, but I ain't going to quit. I'm underrated. Overrated, underrated for this week. Uh, overrated. Fucking voicemails leaving them as the most awkward thing. I've always said that I'm terrible at leaving them, but whenever I say that everyone else, whenever I say that, everyone else always says it too. So I'm putting my foot down on the issue and calling it right now, leaving a message for someone on the phone sucks. There's no way to start your message normally without sounding like a Douche. And then five minutes later you realize you've been trailing on and on while saying, uh, um, too many times making you want to kill yourself, ending with the inevitable a.

Speaker 1:          01:01:34       Okay, thanks. By reminding them that you're still a Douche. Fucking awful. Do. This is something that's really like an epidemic in this young generation is everybody just feeling awkward and feeling like a Douche. I don't know what happened to you guys. I think this last generation of fathers, they flipped. Like, I'm not going to beat the shit out of my kid. Not Hug them and never tell him that I that I, that I love him. Uh, you know, I'm going to do all of that shit and you end up with these people who can't even fucking leave voicemails.

Speaker 3:          01:02:07       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:02:07       What is so awkward, you know?

Speaker 3:          01:02:12       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:02:13       I, I, you know what? I have a hard time getting off the phone. I forget. I forget what I used to say, but I don't feel awkward. Well, I just feel like an idiot, I guess. So I guess I kind of relate. I just go. All right. That's it. I'm Outta here.

Speaker 1:          01:02:32       I will say that, but leaving a message, I like leaving messages. I sing on people's voicemails, you know, whenever I call up fucking Blob, Yay. Bobby Kelly, or in fucking Joey roses, I call him up and I, I'll just immediately, I'll just, whatever comes to my mind, I'll just start singing. Who's the con to that? I love the most. Who's that fucker? Who eats the toasted Joey? He's such a big FHEG. Derosa what's going on? It's bill. Give me a call back. You can't click. That's it. Why don't you try singing? You can do it for anybody. Hey Mom, what's up you sweetie? Thanks for having me. 40 years ago I sent you some flowers. You didn't call me. Do you like my siblings better than me? Click right? Why don't you do that? Try that search. Try singing first. Um, all right. Underrated. Overrated, underrated. Sitting Down to pee. If you're a guy, uh, is it that, how old are you? Is it that hard to stand up?

Speaker 1:          01:03:51       What is wrong with this fucking generation of guys? You Know, Sitting Down To pee, it's actually easier and you don't get varicose veins from all those years of stand. There's nothing better than just pulling out your Dick. It just fucking pee and all over everything. You know, you fucking shooting the toilet paper around. It's fucking good time. Um, anyways, it says the guy who drives a fucking hybrid. Um, anyways, there are many benefits to being a guy and sitting down to peace such as not having to hear your chick complain about peeing on the seat, even though it's on the fucking top of the bowl and it's not actually the seat. Yup. Here's a guy. He's, he, he's literally sitting down to pee, so his girlfriend will stop yelling at him. Okay. I don't know what happened. People a hundred years ago, we could hit them with mop handles and I don't know what happened. They got organized and we didn't, and now we're sitting down to pee just still, they'll stop yelling at us. Um, all right, number two, if you like me, if you're like me and you wake up to pee at night, you don't have to fuck with your eyes and turn on the bathroom lights to aim.

Speaker 1:          01:05:04       Oh Dude. You take it all the fun out of it.

Speaker 1:          01:05:08       That's how you train your ear. All right, that sounds like the back of the ball. Where's the water? That's the floor. It is one small step. Um, number three, not bending down to lift up the seat out. You know what, dude? You're a fucking pansy. Not Bending down to clean off the seat. Less bending in general. Why don't you just bend over and Suck Your Own Dick? He's just sit on the bowl. You fucking Douche. Fuck that guy peeing sitting down. Do you know what else, sir? What? What, what else is overrated? Lifting weights. Um, owning a gun. Chewing tobacco. Eating steak. What else? Drinking Scotch. Smoking cigars. Fixing your own car. What? What else? Or what else is fucking overrated? Everything that makes be in a guy fucking awesome. Losing your shit because some guy you don't know the field goal that really has no effect on your life talking shit. Is that all overrated, Lee Marvin?

Speaker 4:          01:06:14       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:06:16       The only thing that saved you surge, you didn't leave your name so that, that's the only thing that I can say is I can at least see that there was sort of some, some sort of shame in your email. All right, what do we got here?
