Speaker 1:          00:00:01       Hey, what's going on? It's built burn. It's the Monday morning podcast from Monday, July 28th, 2014 what's going on?

Speaker 1:          00:00:12       Hi, how's it going? I just got back from Oriol Canada doing the wonderful a Montreal comedy festival. I had an awesome time up there. I hosted one of their Gallus, you know, which is a big deal. And uh, you know, I'm not big on hosting, I'm not big on hosting cause I hit my bitch are long and it's sort of like, I don't really know how to write a joke. So there's a lot of cursing and making faces and I built momentum off of that, so I just keep fucking roll in with that. And before people realize that they've listened to an hour, my shit and I get out of there, but if I host, I got to keep coming back out and I got to get that energy going again. And um, you know, it's fucking exhausting. So, uh, to be honest with you, I didn't want to do it, you know, see probably like we'll build and why the, why the fuck did you say? Yeah, I'll do it. I'll tell you why. Because I bought the money pit house. That's why

Speaker 1:          00:01:17       I am out there whoring myself. I'm gonna tell you right now, cause I was going to take the whole fucking summer off. I was going to take the rest of July and August off cause I toward like fucking 18 months straight at a all over this great global fucking marble and I was just like, look, I'm taking two months off, bounce, bounce, bounce. Right. I was going to have a great fucking time. I'm bringing it barely back. Yeah. And I was just going to fucking chill out and grill. I was going to sit on my fucking back porch. I was going to stare off into the fucking half a yard that I have out here in La, which is actually considered a decent yard. Do you know you can't throw a Frisbee in my backyard without hitting something?

Speaker 1:          00:02:02       I mean it right as it leaves your hand. It probably, if I go the long way, I decide I could maybe float for just under three seconds. It's not really a yard. I have an area. All right, whatever. Um, I live in a metropolis, so anyways, um, yeah, so I was going to take the whole summer off and you know, as these guys finished this one thing that they were going to do, the area that got damaged by the fucking water, and this is what I learned when your house is fucking like a hundred years old, 90 years old, whatever this thing is, it's just you have 90 fucking years. Well, let's say the first 10 years, everything's going pretty smoothly. About from about 80 years in all the way back, 80 all the way up to right now you just have one do it yourself fucking job. Hey, I've got a guy, I got a, Hey, I'll do it for nothing, man. It's a 1930. Say there's a d, there's no code. Nothing.

Speaker 2:          00:03:07       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:03:07       Now when I tell you nothing, I mean nothing, nothing downstairs in my house was up to code. Nothing. I know what you guys are thinking. Like, well wait, didn't you get somebody doing spec the house when you bought it? Yeah, but they can't see into the fucking walls.

Speaker 2:          00:03:26       Okay?

Speaker 1:          00:03:26       You have no idea what's in you all, they can just look at it. You know they're looking for fucking sweat marks on the walls smelling for water damage check and the gas lines. They can do that. Right. But other than that, you're pretty much on your own. And I'll tell you all you guys fucking listen to right now. If you laugh and you have no idea what the fuck's in your walls, you have no idea what some Douche bag did 20 years ago cause he bought the time, life books, those do it yourself fucking things. And you have no idea what that can't rewired in your wall.

Speaker 2:          00:04:01       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:04:01       Under your floorboards. I mean, so basically

Speaker 1:          00:04:07       downstairs is laid open at this point, like at seven open heart surgery. Okay. And every time they think they got to the last thing, there's another thing, I know what you're thinking. Built these guys downstairs to taking you for a ride. Oh yeah, I'm sure they are. But what that finding is fucking undeniable. Do you know we, they got to this wall the other day and of course, you know, it's got this shit fucking rotted out, crap in front of it. They get rid of that. We get underneath that, we get behind that and at the base board it's just dry rot. The guys barely touching it and it's not like it's, it's breaking off. It's turning into powder. Like fucking long. Chaney junior put this board in when he was a struggling fucking actor. That's how old this goddamn houses and showed. They're like, yeah, we've got to rebuild this wall. Costs like four or 500 bucks am I God ride, just fucking do it. Right. So they take down the drywall, plastic, whatever the fuck it is and you know, later on that date, right, I'm, I'm running around doing, I'm around, I'm doing and the contractor calls me up and he's actually laughing. He's like, Bill, you eat it. You got to come over and see and see this. And I'm taking in my fucking head like, dude, this isn't whatever you laughing about. This isn't funny. And I got over there and basically behind the wall

Speaker 1:          00:05:34       is like this dirt, right? They have like a, you know, this crawl space area. And what they had behind the wall is somebody had taken like this, see through like plastic tarp, and that was the, that was the barrier between the dirt and the wall was this plastic fucking thing. And the guy was laugh and go, Ha, you got to tell you, I've never seen anything like this, which he probably has. But, uh, you know, I know I'm just a comedian, but I know that that's not the way you're supposed to do something like that. But the good thing is that is the final wall downstairs. And of course it couldn't have been, it couldn't be built. Right, right. So in other words, I want to be doing some shows on the odd ball toward this later on this summer. Ah, fuck. I swear to God, and this is the thing too. I could have been a cunt. I could have been like, dude, I don't give a shit. Just put a fucking wall in front of it and fuck the next guy. But, uh, that's not the way I'm wired or what are you a hero now, Bill? Now I was raised properly fixed the thing, right. Just fix the fucking thing, right. Cause I'm not going to have you put a beautiful brand new wall in there with that fucking a sandwich bag barrier behind it. And then what?

Speaker 1:          00:06:50       I Dunno what happens seem to be working all right before they cut open the wall. I'm sorry. I'm fucking, I, I've, I've had it. I've had it with the goddamn downstairs. Um, so that's what's going on. So if you hear drilling and you'd be here, all kinds of shit going on. That's the fucking people downstairs. And uh, we're hoping, we're hoping that they're going to be done. You know, initially it was end of June, beginning of July. Now, uh, I don't even ask anymore. Last I heard was end of August, early September and come on

Speaker 1:          00:07:26       and I'm hoping by Thanksgiving I can actually walk down there and my fucking slip us, you know, we won't have any money for a Turkey. I'm going to shoot a fucking pigeon and I'm going to deep fry it and I'll do it the wrong way. I won't take into consideration the space that the pigeon is going to take up and a the grease, we'll go over and I'll like the whole fucking thing on fire. We'll start over again. Oh God. Oh Jesus. This is why I actually like going on the road. I liked going on the road because I don't have to listen to the sounds. That's the sound of the money flying out of your bank account. How? Um, all right, so I had, I had an unbelievable week, uh, aside from I'm going up to Montreal, Montreal comedy festival and seeing a bunch of great comics.

Speaker 1:          00:08:18       Um, guys, I started with people who started before I did and then a bunch of new faces that I went down and checked out. Um, earlier this week I did a show out here in la that I mentioned last week. I was talking to Norton Warner. I was gonna, it's gonna play drums with his band. They had this cool show, like best goddamn comedy. Show us something, uh, hosted by Josh Adam Meyers. Um, and uh, we basically, uh, hang on a second. What the fuck is this now? Getting this fucking text? Come on. It's just, you know what, this is one of these days, like, I should just, I have to get into the right mindset because it's all going to just fuck all right. Anyways, plowing ahead. Josh. Adam Meyers hosts his show. He's got a band and basically, and I was a bunch of comics that play guitar. Are they saying are they play drums or whatever and you basically, you go up, you do standup, you do whatever you want, but you can kind of make it music based and then in the end you a, you interact with the band however you wanted to do it.

Speaker 1:          00:09:21       So, uh, you know, I was like, all right, I'll play drums, will play a Zeppelin song. And I was kinda thinking like I, if I just go back there, I can't remember if I told this story last week. I know I told you guys that I was going to do it, but basically I'll, I'll fly through it here. I basically was thinking, all right, well if I just go back and play drums and I do a decent job that will be interesting for like 30 seconds and then people will have to sit through the rest of the song. So, um, like a year ago I was going to dress up like John Bonam for a, for Halloween and I, they, I ordered the tee shirt, a remake of the tee shirt that he wore on now that that concert film song remains the same. And I had the blue Adidas dragons.

Speaker 1:          00:10:06       Turns out he was wearing a four stripe Adita when he was in Seattle. And then I had the white pants. I went out and bought those and my wife took me to a costume store and we got the fucking wig and the, the led Zeppelin one mustache that he had, you know, I was like a big thing with [inaudible] with like how long it took for his mustache to connect into his beard because his mustache wouldn't connect it to the beard. And for the first, like three, four albums, he had that beard that was, that went like underneath his chin, like a fucking Chin strap. Like he had nothing up there on his face. And you know what's sad is by the time his mustache and beard connected, it's like he died. It was like his life's work was complete. Um, so anyways, um, well I'll post some pictures if you follow me on Twitter.

Speaker 1:          00:10:51       I already posted a few, but I'll, I'll repost them for, uh, for people who have lives and are not on Twitter. But anyway, so I went back there. I had a great fucking time. We screwed it up quite a bit. We butchered it pretty good. But um, but it was still funny, man. It was a fun time. And, uh, and for the longest time I was kind of looking for a way that I could actually play live drums and people would know that I wasn't taking myself too seriously. Um, and going up and dressing up and looking like an idiot was kind of the perfect way to do it. And it also Kinda gave me licensed slur. I didn't have to feel self conscious that people were looking at me cause I had this whole fucking get up on with the sunglasses. I could kind of hide behind it.

Speaker 1:          00:11:30       It was actually pretty, uh, it was pretty cool. So I'm definitely going to do another one. I'm trying to a, I think I already know the song I'm going to do when the drama that I'm going to dress up like, and uh, I dunno, it's going to be a great time. It's gotta be a great time on the show. We'll get big and then somebody's network will come down and they'll turn it into a TV show and then they'll ruin it and they'll take all the fun out of it. So I'll let you know when the next one is. Uh, so before people come in and try to figure out how they're going to make money off of it, it's going to be a great time. So I'll let you know when the next one is and she, you should definitely come down now as we're on the beginning of the, behind the music arc on this idea.

Speaker 1:          00:12:10       Uh, but anyways, but thanks to everybody in the band and Josh and everybody for having me come down. I had a fucking awesome time. So, and with that, so that was my Monday. And um, and then like I said, uh, I went up, what was it, a Thursday I flew up to Montreal, one of my favorite cities with, uh, the team. I don't like the most, the fucking Canadians. I don't mind him. Whatever. Um, oh you know what, PK sue band came down to one of the gals. I thought he was coming down to my gal. I was really excited to meet the guy cause I wanted to ask him about that whole, uh, cause it really seemed when, you know, Sean squirted the water in his face, like we had them and then they did that and then they just fucking rallied and they won game six and seven.

Speaker 1:          00:12:57       I just, I was dying to hear what the fuck he had to say on that. And of course he was at another gala. Um, oh, well. So anyway, so I went up to Thursday and, um, landed, got over and did this show. Uh, Paul presents as a green room and it was like sort of this remembering, uh, all the great comics who've passed. Uh, it was, uh, you know, Patrice Schimmel, Greg Geraldo, uh, John Pinette, you know, Mitch Hedberg and on and on and on and on and on. And we told a bunch of funny stories and gave each other shit. I guess people enjoyed it. Um, Robert Schimmel, I don't know if I said him and, uh, yeah, if it was a, it was actually, it was a good time. Um, even though I was dreading it, it actually turned out to be a really good time. But then afterwards somebody mentioned that we forgot to bring up auto and George Auto in Georgia.

Speaker 1:          00:13:53       And I was just like, oh man. So I felt bad about that, but either way, she started off well and, um, and then just every night and the Versie and, uh, Tony v the Great Tony v ended up at a cigar bar every night at the end, smoking Cuban cigars. And, uh, I gotta be honest with you, I was done after two nights. I can't smoke a cigar three nights in a fucking row, but Versie is a fucking animal. And by the third night, Tony Vee had gone back. So it was just me and versing. I actually, I get like a small one. And even then I feel like, I feel like I've stood, I stood behind a bus. Like usually I buy a box of Cubans and I bring them back. And at this point I didn't even want him. It's like, I need to, I need to take time off of this shit. It's just too much. So, um, I think I'm on the wagon again. You know, I do it. I either, I don't know how to, I even fucking, I'm going to have 20 them and fucking cigars every night, or I just say fuck it for like 60, 70 days. That's it works for me. All right. Just go fuck yourself with your role in, uh, your eyes.

Speaker 3:          00:15:01       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:15:02       Can't help it. If I don't have any willpower. Actually I do have willpower the 70 days and then I'm good. Um, but I want to thank Tony Vee, Tony Vee. Um, I went up there and they were, they had this award show thing and they were giving out these awards for comedy, which is silly, but, uh, you know, what are you going to do? They've done a bunch of shit for me. It was anybody else that would have been like, no, no, I don't want to go, you know what, I'm working, but some aren't comedy fest. Who doesn't want to go to Montreal? So I went up there and I had Tony v do the intro when he fucking absolutely crushed it. Um,

Speaker 3:          00:15:41       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:15:42       And, uh, that was, that was, that was a great time. And then the next night I did the gala and a I got to give a, I gotta give a shout out to, to the people that were on the show. Man, they were great. This dude mocks for what, who I worked with in Toronto was hilarious. And we had worked in Toronto like the end of last year when I saw growth in him, like major growth since the last time I was with them. He was fucking great. God Damn. I hope I don't forget anybody. Michael Che, um, who I wasn't familiar with, I made sure I went on youtube and I watched everybody before I went out there because that wasn't allowed to say he's been on this show or this show because we were up in Canada and I watched his Letterman and she said the guy was phenomenal. And then his jokes at the Gallo or even better, uh, shit, I'm getting old. Oh. Versie Versie was on the show. Uh, Nikki Glaser. She was on it.

Speaker 3:          00:16:41       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:16:43       Was that all day on the show is literally two days ago. Oh. And then Chris Delea, he comes out absolutely fucking murders it. He's a based, and then dom Irrera walked out. Closed it out.

Speaker 3:          00:16:56       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:16:56       Oh wait, uh, um, Kurt Metzger, how much said Bert Kreischer, that's how fucking old and Kurt Metzger came out. He did this fucking bit. And what killed me was the, the, I don't want to ruin the joke because I don't want to do his bits, but he did this bit and he was so clearly being absurd and it was fucking hilarious. It was, it was a bit about, you know, girls in their teens committing suicide and he had a solution as to what to do to prevent them from not killing themselves. And it was fucking hilarious. It was absurd. But the, the, the reviewer was just like, it didn't go over well at the gala. It did go well on the nasty show. It's like, yeah, that's not his fault. You fucking idiots. Do you think he's being serious? That there's nothing that gets all the, a lot of shit gets me gold, but that really fucking annoys me when the critic doesn't even get the joke. And then blaming the comedian, whatever. All right. So he fucking killed.

Speaker 2:          00:18:03       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:18:04       Though everybody, the whole fucking show was great. The show was great, and I was actually, uh, I was dreading doing it because, like I said, I was hosting and that was outside of my comfort zone. Um,

Speaker 1:          00:18:14       you don't wanna you know what it is? It goes back to early in my career where I hosted a show at the comedy connection in Providence, Rhode Island, and I ate my balls so fucking bad. And the thing about it is, is if you're just doing a set, if you go up and bomb is bad as it is, you're tearing that you're tearing the bandaid off. Whatever you're doing, you know, in 10 minutes you're getting it over with. You're doing, it's going by in real time. If you're hosting, you go up and eat your balls, you get off, you got to go back up again, bring up the next, each your balls, bring up the next guy, go back up again. You just have to keep going back up and in. It's not like you get to start over again. They're like, oh yeah, that guy, that guy that we don't like.

Speaker 1:          00:19:05       And it just keeps going on and off for the duration of the show, which is gonna be be at least 90 minutes. So for 90 minutes, you're eating your balls, even when you're not up there eating it, you're in the green room dreading and you're making a set list. What if I did this joke? Freaking the fuck out. Uh, so I think that I actually have a, uh, I have a phobia or I did anyways. I had a phobia fucking hosting and that, ah, that got rid of it. You see that when you've got dry rot on the bottom of your fucking house, you can get over there. A lot of fears. All right, let's get into the, uh, the advertising for this week.

Speaker 1:          00:24:11       You know, one of these weeks I'm actually going to look at the copy before I go to read it. I always do that personal experience. So I go host.

Speaker 4:          00:24:20       Okay,

Speaker 1:          00:24:20       what a Maroon. Um, all right. So anyways, so now that I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm trying to convince myself that I'm going to knock off the drinking. Whenever I quit booze, I have to go like six days.

Speaker 1:          00:24:35       I can go like three, four days and I don't give a shit if I have a beer. But once I get to six days, I feel like I got a little hitting streak going, you know, and I don't want to start back over at zero. So, uh, we'll see how I am this time next week. But I'm going to lay off the stove, going to lay off the booze there. And I'm like, I said, we'll, we'll, we'll, we'll see how it goes and I'm trying to do my final push to tip the scales at a buck 62. The last time I had a flat stomach and a little bit of abs over there. And, uh, I got to be honest, you, a lot of people are giving me shit for my diet advice despite the fact that I know some people that have been, you know, some of the suggestions that I'm making, you know, keen was salads and all that type of stuff. Somebody actually texted me saying, your diet advice is making me angry.

Speaker 1:          00:25:24       It's just like, dude, I think that has less to do with what I'm seeing. I'm suggesting vegetables, vegetables are making you angry. I think that has to do with you probably at, you know, an overbearing father like myself. You know, we didn't let you speak up and express your opinions. You could just write me and just say, hey, you know, why don't you try this instead of sitting there stewing, um, no pun intended. And then there's other people that, you know, you're giving me shit just saying that veggies or for rabbits and all of that, that all of that usual shit. I never said don't eat meat. I'm just saying, I just, what's been working for me, I'm in the best shape. I've been in like three years and everybody's saying my dietary advice, advices bullshit. It's, it's completely working for me. And they're still holding on to that whole like, you know, we like a mad, you know, fucking go kill an animal and go eat it.

Speaker 1:          00:26:14       I'm not saying don't do that Shit, but, uh, here's something. Here's something. Uh, I would like you to try for all the meat eaters out there that had given me shit, and I'm not even saying this, so fucking paranoid carnivores. I'm not even saying don't eat meat. I'm just saying, you know, twice a fucking week. This is what I do with the veggies over there. And they get in the backs up again, not freaked out. Let me ask you this, this steak dinner. I want you to do a experiment, all right? One night, go out and get yourself a lovely, amazing steak dinner with the baked potatoes and the cream has spinach in your glass of wine and all of that. And I want you to honestly tell me how you feel afterwards. I know you feel full, I know you feel great, but I want to know how long after that meal before you just have to lay down and go to sleep, which is basically your body going, wow, look at this fucking mountain of work we got to deal with.

Speaker 1:          00:27:11       Let me just go fucking lie down. That's shut the body down so we can get this through our fucking system. If you go out and you have a fucking Veggie dinner, right. That's of of the same quality of as a good steakhouse. I mean, I'm not talking about going to one of those things where they deep fry fucking Zucchini at that point you might as well go to Mcdonald's. I'm saying actually a really, you know, like comparable to whatever steakhouse you going to go to, a comparable vegetarian place. And uh, tell me how you feel after that. Okay. And I will always eat steak. I love a fucking steak dinner. I love chicken. I love all of that shit. I'm always going to eat that stuff. But, um, it's undeniable as far as I'm concerned, how much better I feel when I do the veggie thing. So I know I'm never going to stop eating cattle, so I just look at it kind of like what the Stovies, Hey, I just take a break for a couple of days. That's all I'm suggesting. All right, so all you guys who were sending me homophobic shit suggesting that I now want to lay down with another man just cause like want to have a fucking Q Columbo.

Speaker 1:          00:28:27       Well, don't look at the shape of it. Q comp was like a fucking porn stars Dick. You know, it's like you're blowing the hall.

Speaker 1:          00:28:38       Um, anyways. Hey, this is a great time with Eo. It's actually getting a little late, you know, I hope you got you. I forgot to bring up again once again to have yourself a little veggie garden. You know, our tomatoes are just starting to become ripe and the other night, okay, one of them fell off the branch there and uh, we cut it up, put a little salt and pepper drizzle a little olive oil, made it a little, I guess less healthy fucking eight. The thing I was unbelievable. Unbelievable what a tomato was actually supposed to taste like versus what the fuck you usually get. Um, so anyway, so all you guys out there who think I'm like, you know, slowly gonna Start, you know, walking on stage wearing yoga, stretchy pants. Um, I mean I might have to do that one night if, uh, if you know that, that uh, Josh is, show them the best God damn comedy show, whatever the fuck he calls it, you know?

Speaker 2:          00:29:42       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:29:43       Depending on what drummer I'm dressing up, like, I mean, if you look at a lot of the hair metal and that type of stuff, some of that spend x, I mean, they were basically wearing yoga pants that were shorts, right? Is that what it was? I want to do a Stryper song joke and I would never do that to people. Um, anyway, so that's all I'm suggesting so everybody can, uh, you know, fucking relax. You can relax. Um, what else did I do up in Montreal besides booze? My face off. Oh, I did radio and did some radio. He did a rich and Bonnie's podcast going in there, knowing full well that it was going to be some of the most awkward moments in the history of, of radio, which is basically what a podcast is. I don't know why they call it a podcast. It's a fucking radio show. Um, what is this podcasting, how would you describe it? Well, have you listened to the radio? It's that, except it's on the Internet. Hmm. Interesting. Um, so if you've never listened to the, uh, rich and Bonnie podcast, my wife hates me. Uh,

Speaker 1:          00:30:49       uh, I, I would highly recommend it. And I went on this thing knowing that it was going to be brutal. And uh, and then me and Bonnie, we, we got this fucking thing where we like each other, but our conversations do not link up. You have to have somebody like that, somebody you just, you just cannot, like you just, it's just been a 20 year misunderstanding between the two of us. I never know what she's saying. She never knows what I'm saying and it just leads us to these fucking dead ends. We'll, we just both looked at each other, shake our heads and walk away and then start over again at the top of the street.

Speaker 1:          00:31:29       So that's essentially, if you'd like to listen to like an hour of that with rich vos telling stories that really have nothing to do with what me and Bonnie are attempting to say to one another. I highly recommend it too. I'm, I'm fucking around. It was a great time. Uh, people really seem to enjoy it. And then also there was some really funny comics in the crowd. Um, Judy Gold, uh, you know, people like that Shyman in and that type of stuff, adding to it. So, and this one old guy who fell asleep two minutes into it and we actually sent him, sorry, she said the hiccups there. I wasn't getting emotional. We actually sent him off into the corner so he could sleep and his friends could watch. And a, he nodded off for the whole show. I think we got a picture of him. Um, all right. And then that was it. I did the opiate Jimmy show.

Speaker 2:          00:32:20       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:32:20       And, uh,

Speaker 1:          00:32:24       I think that that was it. That's what it, that's what I did. That was my festival and another one. Now the Montreal comedy festival down enough fucking tubes. Um, right. Hey, you know, don't look now, but the New York Yankees are making a push for the playoffs. Those sons of bitches, they're actually in the wild cad. And um, as a fan of Derek Jeter, I'd like to see them make it just to CG to do one more post season. Of course, I want to see the hankies loose, which is always bigger, is bigger than my respect for Derek Jeter. But, uh, I don't know, be kind of sad if that was like, you know, fuck it ended the season and then that, that was just it. I do have tickets to the uh,

Speaker 2:          00:33:07       okay

Speaker 1:          00:33:08       to that, that last game he's playing at Fenway Park. Did I tell you guys I bought in half on red sox season tickets this year. Buddy of mine was on a waiting list for 10 years and he got these great seats. He's like, I can't, I can't swing these man. I need some more people to buy in. So I bought in for my little block of tickets, me and a couple of the guys or whatever. And um, cause they're expensive as shit. And I'm thinking like, all right, well, you know, I got enough family and friends back there that I can sell them to them and then I can, you know, the socks don't care if you put them up on stub hub. So I'm like, I'll, I'll, I'll be fine. Right. And uh, you know, the red sox shit, the bed from day one and I can't give these things away. I've lost, I lost my shirt on these tickets once again. Bill Borough and the comedy odd ball tour later on this summer. Um, Jesus fucking Christ. So, but I do have that, you know what's funny is I could actually sell the, and I could sell that pair of tickets on stub hub and I can make a ton of fucking money, a ton of my money back. I would still lose. But especially if the Yankees don't make the playoffs and that could actually be like his last fucking game. I think there's a possibility. Um,

Speaker 2:          00:34:24       uh,

Speaker 1:          00:34:25       this is a sports fan. There's no fucking way I'd rather be there. I've never been like, you know, I remember a long time ago to two of my buddies, they get season tickets to the patriots in 1985 and the patriots ended up going to the Superbowl and they had tickets to go to Superbowl 20 and they both scalped him and I just met him. I thought it was the dumbest thing ever. And even though we lost 46 to 10, even though we got fucking destroyed, it's just like I would, I would still rather go to Superbowl 20 and actually see the 46 defense live. You could've saw Walter Payton, all of those. Uh,

Speaker 1:          00:35:09       you know, Richard Dent, Wilbur Marshall, all of those fucking hall of Famers, all of those people you could have seen. I, you know, Jim McMann versus fucking Tony Eason and then old Steve Grogan coming in that whole file, but it would've been great. And you get to party down in New Orleans. I definitely, I always think the experience, even if your team loses his better than selling them, and maybe, uh, maybe I'm a fucking jackass, but, uh, I always look at it that way. So I'm definitely going back, um, for that game. You know, maybe I'll pick up like a one nighter along the way. Um, but, uh, I'm really looking forward to going to that. Wow. So maybe I should be rooting for the Yankees not to make the playoffs. So that'll be his last game. So actually it will be like, and like the fucking bottom of the eighth of the top of the ninth, Derek Jeter coming up for his final fucking at bat,

Speaker 1:          00:36:03       but if he hoped he hits a home run to right field, like fucking Ted Williams, you know, he's got it. Do something. Um, so anyways, uh, and football is right around the corner. This is such an exciting time. Is there anything more exciting than when you suddenly start going to like fucking training camp? The greatest month of the year for me is September. It's just like I always get depressed at how fast the summer goes by. And then when all of a sudden it's September and it's football and the games count in his college football and all of that type of shit. It's just the, it's the greatest. It's the fucking greatest. I can't wait. I can't wait. So I mean, what else am I going to do for the rest of the summer hunt? Go out and sunbathe over there. All right, let's get into some of your questions here for the week. Uh, the flute, it says, Bill, you took a hammering from a lot of people on all fronts. Twitter, Facebook and emails. Um, nine, 10

Speaker 1:          00:37:03       mentioned, Oh, 90%, I guess mentioned anchorman. Other suggests you youtube jazz flute players. Listen, go fuck yourselves. All right. First of all, you guys who said when I said there's no cool way to play the flute and then you bring up anchorman. He was mocking playing jazz flute. He was making fun of it. It's a fucking movie. Do you think those flames were actually real coming out of the end of it? Do you think he really drank a fucking drink out of the thing? It was using it as a straw. It was a joke. All right. Um, and as far as jazz flute, let me tell you something right now. I don't, I, I'm not saying that there's not virtuoso play. I don't want to hear it. There's certain instruments that listen, if you want to accompany like some shit with the flute. Absolutely. All right?

Speaker 1:          00:37:56       But there's a reason why there's no fucking flute players in the rock and roll hall of fame and don't even bring up that fucking ban. Howdo Pope, pope, whatever that fucking guy is that Jeff Tull guy. I don't even want to fucking hear it. He did not get into the rock and roll hall of fame because of his flute playing. It was the fucking rock music underneath it. Okay, so you can take your flute. Okay. Turn it up sideways and shoved straight up. Yo Carrie Dils. No. Um, yeah, no, I stand by that. I stand by that. I put the flute right up with the oboe. Now if I go watch a, a classic, I guess I was talking to like rock music. All right. Even jazz, you can go fuck yourself. I'd much rather that trumpet has so much more power. Saxophone, trombone, all of that shit. I would when I listen to that than the God damn flute. Now you take a flute and Piccolo and you stick that shit in a a sympathy, sympathy as symphony. I can listen to it then. Then I find it an amazing a company. Mint. If you had, I came to any of the words I'm trying to use right now. If you fucking have 40 other fucking musicians,

Speaker 1:          00:39:04       okay. Helping to flesh out all around a fucking flute. I can listen to it. Or a Piccolo. I can listen to that. If you want to have one little movement where you know you got some dreadful fucking music and all is lost and all of a sudden there's a rail light at the top of the fucking tunnel and you want to, you want to emphasize that with a little, oh Ooh, what is that up there kind of fucking notes with a flute or a Piccolo that have at it have at it, but I don't want to listen to a fucking hour. That shit. I stand by it. Fuck all you flew. Play in fucking assholes out there. Who would have thought? Who would have thought that that would have become a controversy? All right. Um, hey bill, when's your next special going to be available on Netflix?

Speaker 1:          00:39:48       We are shooting for December 5th. Um, December 5th is going to be the release date and I'm editing it right now and I could not be happier with the way that this thing looks. Um, I can't wait for you guys to see it and I am in the process of writing my new hour and I come and right out of the gate with just a rough one. You know, um, it's really just coming off as sexist and I have to be honest because I can't stand outside of myself. I can't have like a Jesus Christ. What are they ripping up downstairs now? You know what I think they're doing? I think they getting rid of, it's, this is actually exciting. I have all this galvanized pipe in my house. Um, and they fucking Yank because like I said, it's been flayed downstairs and he can see all of it and they're like, well, we might as well change it now before it bursts that he's put that fear in your head, hey, we're building this beautiful bathroom. But sure, it'd be a shame if this shit buying a wall burst. I mean, we can risk it. And you're like, all right, just fucking, dude, I'm not gonna make any money off this house. I'm going to have to fucking live to be 150

Speaker 4:          00:41:04       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:41:05       Christ.

Speaker 1:          00:41:08       Yeah. The only good thing about buying a fucking house is that if you want to change something you can, you don't have to clear it with the landlord. But as far as making any money off your house, it's a fucking pipe dream and less, you fucking start fucking over other people. And when the market's hot, you go in and you buy houses and you do a half ass fucking job, you have fast, the whole fucking thing. You don't even know what the fuck you do doing. That's why I hate show where the leaf flipped this house. I can't stand watching those people who aren't caught. Like they sit there and they'll show the guy who bought the house, he's trying to figure out how to use the, the, the, uh, the sander or whatever to, to Redo hardwood floors. He doesn't even know what he's doing. They're playing this silly music and he does a fucking half ass job. And then you watch these suckers come in because what he did is all brand new. So it's still holding together and it hasn't fallen apart yet. And he'd just watching these people getting led off to fucking financial slaughter. Sorry. Anyways. Um, so this opening bit that I'm doing, I can't tell if a

Speaker 3:          00:42:13       okay

Speaker 1:          00:42:13       if it's coming off sexist or I just am sexist. Um, the point of it is, is not the, isn't the sexism, but it's really coming off like that. It's really been a, especially up there in Montreal. Oh Jesus. I opened with that at the gala. I'm sure we'll edit that one out. Um, so anyways, yeah. The next one, it's going to be a December 5th and also my comedy album, um, is finally done. Finally went through all the red tape with Carnegie Hall, Finally got Them, press all the, uh, the records press. Um, I'm going to find out today, I actually have them in my house. I have to find out when I can sell these things to you because they're also going to be available in stores. Um, but the fucker is done and I think I'm going to be doing a co release with a Aziz Ansari on a third man, third man records, which is Jack White's label out of on Nashville, Tennessee. So, uh, that's a little teaser. That should be coming up in the next, um, I dunno when in the next month or so. I hope. I'm really hoping. Uh, I think they're finishing up diseases album. So a, it's going to be pretty cool. And once again I really want to make the stresses okay. The material that's on my Carnegie album is, um, that was November of 2011 and when I taped you people are all the same. That was march of 2012. So that's December,

Speaker 3:          00:43:47       uh,

Speaker 1:          00:43:48       January, February, March, four months later. So this was where my act was at four months earlier. So there's a ton of overlap, which is why I wanted to put it out on vinyl only because I wanted to document that I actually got to perform at Carnegie Hall, but I don't want to fuck any you guys over. Were you thinking this is going to go, oh my God, this is a, this is going to be an hour of completely different shit that I never heard of it. That's not what it is. What you're going to hear is where my act was four months before I recorded it. So there is some different shit, but I'd have to say at least 80% of it is the same, um, jokes, ideas or whatever. And granted I tell them differently. I'm sure someone will listen to and be like, Hey, actually you look the way you did the fucking jerk off joke at Carnegie better than you did it in DC. So there will be that. But I'm letting you guys know that shit. So I don't want to hear any fucking crap from any of you. Like I screwed you over. I'm going out of my way to let you know that this is what it is. But, um, it's really, uh, you know, to have a comedy album, you know, is pretty fucking awesome and it's something that I don't think this will be the last time I do this. I would like to try and, uh,

Speaker 1:          00:45:02       you know, I have a couple of ideas where I could put out just an hour of original shit. Maybe just od on vinyl. That could be a cool thing. We'll see. We shall see. So I'm just letting you know that that is a, I actually have them, I just have to wait to figure out when I'm going to sell it. But, uh, every day that I don't, it's closer to the holidays and it'll make a wonderful gift. There you go. Oh, Jesus. What does that guy drilling down there?

Speaker 2:          00:45:25       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:45:27       If any of the construction people are working on my house, so listening to my podcast, I know you guys are doing a phenomenal job. All right. I'm just being a crabby cont okay, so don't fucking not tighten down the screws down there.

Speaker 2:          00:45:36       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:45:41       Yeah, yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:45:43       You hear that?

Speaker 1:          00:45:45       Yeah. I don't even know. I didn't want to know what the fuck that was. Um, all right, let's plow ahead here. Uh, dude, he didn't call Shit. Versie um, dear bill.

Speaker 2:          00:46:01       Yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:46:02       Ooda Zelie Uber. Uh, I'd like to congratulate Paul Versey when no one else in the world was saying Lebron would go back to Cleveland. He was the only one. Oh No, wait. He wasn't, in fact, he didn't call it until one week before the decision was made and plenty, all in caps of other people had been making that exact same prediction. You can look at his Twitter feed or listened to his podcast for proof. Basically everyone was saying it. It was either Miami, Cleveland, or a few other teams that had made phone call. Does Paul know that guessing correctly by picking one of four choices isn't calling it Jesus Paul. He had taken a pounding. He acts like he's Sam fucking Rothstein and he may any, he made some, some out of left field prediction that Lebron was going to the raptors as something. Here's the thing, I like Paul.

Speaker 1:          00:46:56       I think he's funny, but holy Shit. Cool it on the calling it thing. I can't even imagine having an argument with him in person. Ah, this is fucking hilarious. Paul, look at this guy. This guy is sharing my viewer, you. Uh, he seems like, you know, it's funny, as Paul is listening to this right now, and I know he's got his head down with his looking through his eyebrows going, he gets fucking bullshit. I said it to j law had Jay lie, I can say it. I said it two fucking years ago to j law had an a bar in Cleveland. Um, he goes, he seems like the type of guy who does that thing where he puts the tip of his fingers together when he's making a point now he definitely doesn't do that. Then shakes his hands back and forth, uh, from his chest to the floor like an Italian and Italian and do that annoying thing where you look at someone else in the group besides the guy you're making a point to as if to say, hey, we're all together on this point I'm making against this guy in front of me.

Speaker 1:          00:47:50       Am I right fellas? That's fucking, that's hilarious. That's why I love Italians. I love that they do that. He goes, all due respect to Paul though. Great Guy. Now that you took the piss out of him, he goes, he literally has to be the worst poker player on the planet too. I can't imagine him playing it cool with anything but pocket aces, watching Paul's face and Paul's face alone during the whole process of him chasing a straight would be priceless. Um, I played poker with Paul. Now he has, he has a great, uh, he has a great poker face and then he has a way of looking at you.

Speaker 1:          00:48:25       He's got this face when he's looking at you to try to figure out if you're bluffing, that actually makes you laugh. Um, all right. Paul shot has been fired your way. For those of you not listening to the [inaudible] podcast, this is like, uh, like the old rap battles where Paul's going to have an answer song, um, to this guy. He's going to defend himself. So everybody listened to the, uh, the Versie effect. I will email this, I will copy and paste this and I will email it to him and maybe, uh, maybe he can write back. And, uh, the worst part of all of this is I'm going to have to listen to him defending himself first to me on the phone before I listened to him do it on his podcast. So I have to listen to them do it twice. All right. Okay. Quit drinking would rather be alone. This next person says, uh,

Speaker 1:          00:49:17       Mr [inaudible] embarrassment. Sorry. Um, I thought since you've taken time off from drinking that you'd be a good person to talk to, talk to and ask about this. I'm 22 years old and after hitting the bottle hard since early high school I decided to take some time off after it seemed to get out of control. Yeah, I've been there. I said I'd been sober for nearly five months at this point. The thing is that since putting up the bottle, I've noticed I enjoy spending time alone rather than with other people. I still go out to bars and hang with my buddies who drink and usually just end up being the designated driver. He says I have no problem with people who can control their alcohol. Just thought it would be a good personal choice to take some time away, but being sober slash the sober guy at 22 is pretty damn rough when everyone else is getting shitty. Just wondering if you had any insight on the matter. Thanks and go fuck yourself. Um, well I can actually relate even at 46 of being the sober guy because of, uh, all the free time that comedians have. Um, we can kind of drink like we're still 22, so I know how I'm

Speaker 2:          00:50:34       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:50:35       I Buy, I guess, you know, but I'm not 22, so I guess there is an extra amount of stress with that. But, uh, I think what you're doing is a great thing and a Hello Neil. Um, I think it's a great thing. And um, how do I put this? The w w when you, when you go on a run of not drinking, it's all about you. Okay. And what you want to do and how long you want to do it. And

Speaker 1:          00:51:05       um, I wouldn't give in to any like external pressures as to when and where you start drinking again. Um, I always find it funny when I'm not drinking to go to a bar and watch, basically everybody's slowly roofing themselves and then just watch the behavior. And like I said, I don't do it in a judgmental way because it's more senate kind of observing like, oh, this is how I was acting. Um, it can definitely suck at night, but there's nothing better in the morning when you wake up without a hangover ready to take on the world. And, uh, I would think at 22 to do that, it's pretty mature and you've got a chance of meeting a, your judgment on who you start dating would probably be a lot better rather than you're hammered and she's hammered and you start the relationship off in this cloudy area.

Speaker 1:          00:51:53       Um, you might meet another, you know, smart person your age, uh, who's taken some time off herself. Who knows, who knows. But as far as like, um, if you feel impressed you to start drinking again, that's the wrong reason to start drinking because everybody else is drinking is not the reason to come back it. But you know, if you feel like you have it under control and you know, you, you know, or if there's an event coming up and you're like, okay, I'm going to drink it that and then I'm going to meet at least shut it off. But I gotta be honest with you, that's a tough thing to do because I was like, I'm going to drink when I went to Vegas and then I was immediately and go back on the wagon and I was able to do it for four days and then it was like July 4th weekend.

Speaker 1:          00:52:35       Then I have a bad a beer and then I've just been kinda drinking ever since. But, uh, fortunately I drank so much in Montreal that yeah, that now I don't want to drink. I think that I almost need to do that. I got to hit like a wall where I either make such an ass of myself. It makes such a bad decision or just do something that, uh, it, it's, it's easy for me to kind of like want to walk away from it. But, uh, like I said, it's all up to you. You don't sound like you're an alcoholic. I mean from your fucking email. I can't really judge it, but like I said, what have do whatever you want to do, but don't, don't go. Don't start drinking again because everybody else's, I guess that that would be my advice. Um,

Speaker 4:          00:56:20       okay,

Speaker 1:          00:56:21       I see the results of a abusing your body with booze, drugs, food. People say food is a drug, which I would actually 100% agree with. Um, you see the results of it. And um, unfortunately when I was up in Montreal, I saw a couple of people that are my age in 10 years older and they either look the ones that took care of themselves and kind of quit drinking and tried to eat right and that type of thing. They look great. They still got the light in their eye and then people who've been a, you know, hitting it hard, man, it really catches up with you when you get to be my age where it's like, um, you know, I've been of legal drinking age longer than I've lived when I wasn't. You know what I mean? That tipping point of like 42 years of age when you've, uh, you know, and forget about underage drinking that you've already been doing, I could really, really catches up with you.

Speaker 1:          00:57:19       So what you're doing right now, given your body a break when it's as young as it is, is a phenomenal thing to do. And, um, you know, you could actually experiment steering even more into a healthier lifestyle, like learning how to eat a little bit better because at 22, man, I mean, you can fucking drink a 12 pack and eat McDonald's late at night and wake up the next day with a flat stomach. But like, you're setting yourself up for a, you know, just basically being a human being is no different than being an athlete. It's just the timeline timeline is stretched out a lot longer. Like father time is going to get all of us. But, um, you know, those athletes who throughout their career, early in their career, took care of themselves, have longer careers and if you'd like to have a longer career, in other words, a longer life, like doing what you're doing is a great thing. So, uh, I don't know, when you look at it that way, there's really no peer pressures. They're really peer pressure to, to die sooner. Um, all right. Nia, do you want to chime in on one of these? Um, you want to do dead? Nancy did Nancy Dead Nazi GRANDPA, can I say Nancy? You know hard. They're laughing in England right now. Fucking Nancy boy, uh, breaking up for college. Which one do you want it? Do you want to do that? You want to stay in your wheelhouse?

Speaker 1:          00:58:47       I'll come over here. Who is short shorts. All right. That's really good about quitting drinking. I'm not drinking this week. Come a little closer. I'm not drinking this week. I said okay. That's a good idea. It is a good idea. All right, here we go. Breaking up for college. Uh Oh yeah, look at that. What is this? This is, this is, she just picked up my hotel key for this weekend. That's the w hotels that, that's how they advertise their spa and there's a girl on it wearing a bikini

Speaker 5:          00:59:23       sitting on luggage and holding like a hatbox, so fit Avec Avec Tara stiles. Is she like a trainer there? There's literally a picture of like a half naked woman on your room. Key.

Speaker 1:          00:59:36       Yeah. I mean I said that a long time ago. I did the w hotel. Everything looks like it's been just on. No, they have all they have of that hung over lighting and all of that type of, see you're making a mistake. Lamps, you know, very sexy. Now it's Hacky, sexy, that aquarium lighting that they have in all of it. I, I've decided I'm done with them. I'm done with them. I like those older stuff. Your places with the good breakfast bar. What? Some holiday sauce. I say holidays, holidays, Hollandaise, Hollandaise. Yeah. Many times I've read that and I still can't retain it. All right. Breaking up for college. Dear bill, my girlfriend and I had been dating for awhile throughout high school. It's pretty much the relationship I've always dreamt of. Never really getting tired of each other, no fighting, similar views and tastes a healthy amount of sex. Sounds like a recipe and a healthy scope as sex. Very supportive of each other. However, we both graduated high school and are going off to college. She's going to a liberal arts school in Philly while I'm staying in the state, uh, to go to northern Arizona University. We both agree that would be, it wouldn't be healthy to try and maintain a long distance relationship. So we're spending these last few weeks of the summer together and we'll break it off when she leaves for Philly. Oh Wow. Man, that sounds sad. Um, I could sure.

Speaker 5:          01:00:54       High School, this is a person who just graduated from high school. Yeah. And they're talking about, it's pretty much the relationship I've always dreamt of since when? Since you were five. Yeah. I mean, no, it's, no, it's really nice, but it's like how, how is someone who's graduated from high school? Like I'm in the relationship. I've always dreamed of. Like I didn't know that high school people dreamt of relationships in a way that they really understood.

Speaker 1:          01:01:22       Maybe this person does see. One of the things when you do these questions is it's very easy to superimposed where your head was at it, but it's literally reads like somebody who's like a 30 year old. It's like, it's what I've always wanted. There's like a healthy amount of sex and we don't get tired of each other. It's like this is the highest visit. Someone who just graduated. You know what? Actually see your point. They do sound like they're 35 it's like, whoa. When did you dream of having this great relationship? All right, well let's, let's, let's, let's continue. Let's see what we got here. I could very well symbol shit. Oh, you think this is a bullshit? Well, I dunno. It sounds nice. I'm sorry. Let's let, let's continue. I should, well, I'm very gullible. You can get me. I could very well see myself spending the rest of my life with this girl. But at the same times, four years is a lot of time. I'm Matzoh fucking marriage right there. Everybody has that one couple that wins best couple and then they got together the freshman, sophomore year and they just didn't know how to break up. So then they continue on and continue on, you know, and then you see him at the 10 year reunion. Yeah, we broke it off when last week.

Speaker 1:          01:02:20       Get on with their life. Um, I could very well see myself spending the rest of my life with this girl, but at the same time, four years is a lot of time and a lot can change in that time. So I don't expect us, I don't expect for us to hook up again the second we graduate. However, she's come to be one of my closest friends and I'd like to maintain that friendship and she agrees. I want to watch her life unfold and watch her inevitable inevitable success come alive. Yeah. These very mature people, whether we're romantically involved or not. While this will be a bit of a damper on the beginning of college. I know I'm going to have a blast. My roommate is one of my best friends from high school. He knows how to deal with me and he'll kick my ass to get back in shape if I start getting mopey about this girl.

Speaker 1:          01:03:05       Uh, what's your take on the situation? Any words of advice or encouragement? Thanks in advance? Um, all right. I would say, uh, when you break up with somebody, my thing has always been when you break up with them, you got to get away from him because as much as you have this mutual agreement or something like that, one of you is going to meet somebody first and then it's just going to be rather than enjoying, oh, I met somebody and seeing how that goes, you're going to have to deal with the fact that you're dragging somebody else through it and they'll hear it in your voice. You know, what are you doing? Nothing. Is there somebody over there they're going to figure it out. And, uh, if she finds out before you, you know, find someone before you and yeah, yeah, yeah. Again, you can try to get a back. I mean, I think, I think, I think you guys suggest go cold Turkey until you have your Thanksgiving break. Personally. Maybe an email here, email there. Uh, but I think you guys should, you know, if you're going to break up, you got to break up. I think

Speaker 5:          01:04:15       I'm Neil, I'm actually sure I'm, I'm still trying to understand exactly what the question is because honestly it sounds like from this email, it sounds like you've got it figured out perfectly to me. Cause we see, we both agreed that it wouldn't be healthy to try to maintain a long distance relationship. So we're spending these last few weeks of summer together. Uh, yeah. I mean, you're not going to be the only person in college and Freshman Year of college she was left their boyfriend or girlfriend behind. That's a pretty normal thing. So yeah, spend your summer together. It's, it sounds like a movie actually. You know, I've spent the summer together and then you both go off and yeah, thanksgiving break they'll probably see each other and whatnot. But I mean I, I honestly wouldn't put too much pressure on either one of you to try to, it sounds like you're both really amazing, lovely people and that's really nice. But yes, you are going to meet other people in college and the fact that you're being really realistic about it is, um, if you were to guess, I don't really have much to say about the guests so mature. I can, that's why I'm sort of like

Speaker 1:          01:05:25       stuck. All right. You want to go to dead Nancy? GRANDPA Nazi. All right. So yeah, I can hear you guys seem you got, you got to figure it out.

Speaker 5:          01:05:34       Yeah, I don't really, there's not really much else to say.

Speaker 1:          01:05:37       Well what about me? My, my advice, what I'm saying he should, he shouldn't stay in contact with her.

Speaker 5:          01:05:41       I don't, I don't think that that's possible. I mean, I don't think you should try to continue a relationship. Like let's try to like make it work. You guys have already said it's going to be too hard, but to be friends and things,

Speaker 1:          01:05:53       I made it. Part of her blossoming will be her blowing somebody else's. Some point, I don't want to be crass, but I don't think you want to see grass, but you just talked about, well, you don't want to see those things like blowing somebody. Listen, there's a lot of colors in a sunset. Okay. There's a lot of colors in the sunset. You don't need to see

Speaker 5:          01:06:08       blossoming coloring of this. Let's say you're really trying to make it or sunrise, sunrise blossoming, sunsets, the end. No, I think they, if, if they're going to be friends that they're going to take, they're going to tax, they're gonna email. They're going to see each other's social media activity like it's impossible not to and someone may get jealous.

Speaker 1:          01:06:24       It's not impossible not to. You just don't look at it. You cut it up.

Speaker 5:          01:06:29       Sound like he wants to cut it out because they really enjoy each other. I don't, I don't know.

Speaker 1:          01:06:34       Doing, I'm doing the exact thing that I told you not to do. I'm super imposing my thoughts. The shift if we were to, God forbid if we were to break up or whatever, you, you would never want to like text me or like talks to me. You just be like, no, of course, of course I would, but like I, I wouldn't, I wouldn't be involved in it because I know I know where that's going. I, yeah,

Speaker 5:          01:06:58       yeah, yeah. I don't, but I don't think they should go cold Turkey.

Speaker 1:          01:07:03       Yeah. You'd meet some guy like some guy named Roger, Roger Roy and those are guys. Rick. Oh, he's got a car. He's awesome. Um, all right. Dead Nazi grandpa dear Billy blowhard. Uh, there's been a strong, a story going around in the news here and other Philly story here in Philly for the past few weeks that I want to hear your opinion on. I'm writing because I know you were a big World War II guy. I was for like two months when I was reading and then I fucking gotten, I know enough now I'm into fucking keen Wa and then you became obsessed with something else. That's what bill does. He gets really into something and he's like obsessive about it. And then he moves onto the next thing, which is why I'm a comedian. Why can't write scripts? Because my mind works in bits to take a little of information and then I go, Ooh, there's a spider on the wall.

Speaker 5:          01:07:50       The thing is, is that I gave you a hard time about that all the time and I'm very similar to that finally.

Speaker 1:          01:07:57       Okay. And following this. Okay, I know you're big world. Go to God and fall and following this is weirdly made me feel sympathy for an ex Nazi. So He's been following this story and he feels sympathy for an ex Nazi. He says. Long story short, there was an 89 year old man who had served as a guard in switch when he was 17 his mother was born in the United States. So after the war he moved to the Philadelphia area. He lived here under his original name. Um, and this is June, I guess until June, 2013 there was a word missing there when a Bavarian town passed a law allowing x Nazis to be ex communicated to Germany to face trial. He was eventually arrested and charged with the 158 counts of accessory to murder. There was a big argument about it. The guy just died in US prison this week.

Speaker 1:          01:08:48       I got into an argument about this today. Is it fucked up for this guy to get arrested 70 years later for something he did as a teenager? Even if he is the biggest content, the planet. I think the Philly cops have other shit to worry about that movie apt pupil. That sounds like APP people. Do you remember that movie? Yeah. Except this guy was a, he wasn't, he was in a guard tower where that other guy was like a Rudolf Hess. More type of guy. Um, I don't think it's fucked up for you to get arrested for something that you did in your teenage years, but like 158 but this is the thing, he's a 17. This is the, if, if he can't, if he came at it like this and saying, listen, this guy was a teenager, all right, when this madman took over his country, he doesn't have a choice.

Speaker 1:          01:09:38       He has to join the fucking army. Um, and everybody's like, well, you know, you could say, no, I'm not doing it. And then it's like, then you get your brains blown out. You can't just go, well fuck it. I'm Outta here. It's 17. Where are you going to go? The, not only is your country completely at war, the entire continent is it war? And I think it's very easy to not be 17 in the middle of fucking World War Two. And for you to sit there and go and like, you know what I would've done, I would've been an angel and I would've done this, this, this and this and this. And it's just like, like I can have empathy for the situation that he was put into, but, um, it's, it's one of those things where it's, I mean, what happened there? I mean, they're prosecuting people.

Speaker 1:          01:10:27       I mean, I dunno. Do you think that the 17 year old kid, I mean he's a fucking kid. I the person or the people that would be very concerned about having this person, the rest it would be like, all right. You know what's hilarious is that me and Nia just talked about this subject for like fucking 15 minutes and came to this great place as to why you have to arrest this guy. And the fucking batteries wore out. God dammit. I know. I told you, I told you this is just not a, this just ain't my fucking day. Um, so all I can do is paraphrase. Oh God, what a fucking buzzkill is basically

Speaker 1:          01:11:21       Kyle, what, what I left off saying, it's like he got to prosecute him because he was part of a war crime. So you have to prosecute him. But I, you know, I was basically making the point that if this kid in Philly who I don't agree with the way he seems to be defending him, I'm defending them the way I am. I'm defending that 17 year old kid in this way that everybody, if he was to walk into it, if you, anybody that was to wa, you know, you guys were to walk into a bar and you were to bring that up and you'd ask people what they would do, what they would've done in that situation. Everybody's going to be captain America. Everyone's gonna be like,

Speaker 6:          01:11:59       Dude, you know what? I will die. I will go. I would have fucking shot here the wound phase and now we're done. We're done. Then

Speaker 1:          01:12:06       type of shit. And it's just like, you know, any, it's very easy to be fucking sitting in a bar drinking a fucking rolling rock and a paint yourself out to be this unbelievable hero and all this shit that you would have done. But like a, I think unfortunately this kid was born at the wrong fucking time. I don't think that, like I, I mean, I really don't think that this, this kid wouldn't, you know, he wouldn't, do you think that this kid was just an evil kid and he was like psyched to be up in that guard tower or is he just, I mean, who knows? Like I'm, I'm not, and I'm not saying that, I'm not saying that. I don't really know that. I don't really think that it matters, which was my point. I feel like this person's sympathy is misplaced. I'm not talking about him.

Speaker 1:          01:12:49       I'm talking about me now. Oh, it's about, you know, I'm talking about, I'm talking about my opinion, which is what that you can't, because he was 17 years old. Chances are he wasn't, he didn't want to do it and he was asked to do it. I'm saying it's 17 you're very impressionable. You can get talk that you can get brain like a 30 30 35 year old person, 45 year old, 55 year old person. You know, at that point you, you, you're, you know, so much more about life. Like people can't come up to you and tell you like it's very hard, much, very harder for, for a much more difficult for somebody to come up to you and try to convince you with something that you know isn't true, that you know is not and you can spot crazy from a fucking mile away. But what I was talking about, which of course got lost was what usually, I don't know what it is about people who are smart and people who are like, hey live and let live there because of that intellect.

Speaker 1:          01:13:54       They're also not, they don't choose violence and unfortunately that's, you need to fight fire with fire with the like, well violence doesn't solve anything. It's like violence would have solved this. Like when you were dealing with, when they were first starting to take over and people would choosing self preservation rather than helping out their neighbors is what they should have gone out is they should have gone out and like, I mean like, and this is once again I'm doing this woulda Coulda, Shoulda Shit. Like, oh dude, you know what I would've done? You should have gone out there or you should organize the people on your block. You know, when you, if you had a Jewish family on your block going like, look, we're all down with, well these are our friends. They're not taking them. And if they come down here, you know, we're fucking taking them out. And if, and if you started that movement and you started taking them out before they took everybody else out, you could actually stop it. But the thing is, is decent people, regular people live and let live people are essentially not organized. And that's the only advantage that they had was they were walking around, they were organized. And then I think that people choose the cowardly, uh, decision of self preservation.

Speaker 1:          01:15:13       But I don't think self preservation is cowardly. At 17, I think 17 I mean, you were a boy. You're not, it's like that Brittany Spears, not quite a woman. You're not quite a man there near. And all of a sudden this, this fucking event comes along and you get swept up into it. So, look, if this guy was, let me, this is what I'd say, if this guy was 30 and he was in a guard tower, fuck him. All right. If you're 17 and a guard tower, you still got to prosecute them. But like, I'm, it's like I'm going to sit there and be like, dude, you know what? I would've gone to 17 when the entire continent was at war. I would have fucking walked to Africa and just left it behind. Like, I mean, I don't know what this kid, yeah.

Speaker 4:          01:15:50       Uh,

Speaker 1:          01:15:53       I mean his, his option was basically, uh, he, he had to take a bullet in his own head or go up there. Yeah. I Dunno. I Dunno. I'm out on this one. I think I'm out. I mean, I just don't feel like, I dunno, I don't have anything really to contribute anymore to that question other than what I just said about there's sympathy beam is placed. Yeah. I can't seem to have a conversation with you about what I'm saying. You just keep going back to this kid. I'm not saying that this kit, I'm saying what I'm saying and I'm, I'm, I'm actually talking about how a fucking lunatic, like Hitler comes into power. He doesn't come into power because he makes sense. He comes into power because all these other people that don't think he makes sense.

Speaker 4:          01:16:40       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:16:40       They choose self preservation. Right. Okay. He's not going after me. I'm Protestant. It's not going to have to me. I'm Catholic, he's not going off to me, I'm straight and you and you end the fear of watching your neighbors who he had a fucking cookout with and you hear them screaming as they're getting dragged out of the house and you know, you should be doing something but you don't because of your own self preservation. I think it's very easy for people to hear this story and be like, oh, the fucking nuts, you piece of shit and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. This people as adults would choose self preservation who would criticize what this kid did when he was 17 that's my point. My point is not that, that, uh,

Speaker 3:          01:17:16       mmm

Speaker 1:          01:17:18       that this is wrong, that they're prosecuting. It's, it's, but I also don't look at this dude who when he was 17 who ended up in that, that situation, like this was somebody who was, was okay, like clearly making decisions in his life or even had control over the direction of his life. I mean, there's a reason why you can't drink till you're 21 it's because the level of immaturity you have. You think this kid can, we had 17 has the fucking maturity to be able to handle what's going on, walking down the street and seeing people hanging from, you know, by piano wire and that type of thing. I mean, it's, it's, it's just another ruined life because of, of this fucking psycho.

Speaker 3:          01:17:58       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:17:58       Could you agree with that? Yeah, I could see that for sure. All right. This is way too heavy a fucking topic to be discussed in here. So that's, that's basically the gist of what it is. Maybe it's this, maybe it's just too early. It's too heavy. I Dunno. Maybe I'm still asleep and I can't quite get into it. How much after what meal during the day can you discuss a forming former guard tower, a Nazi guard tower, kids after lunch conversation, I think. Okay. All right.
