Speaker 1:          00:00:01       Hey, what's going on? It's bill burn. It's the Monday morning podcast for Monday, April 21st, 2014 being recorded live on digital tape and the good all you in my fucking bedroom. Oh Man. It's great to be back. Well, let me tell Ya. Well I'll tell ya and a crazy flight color back. Yeah, no, I am. Uh, I'm excited to be back. I'm happy to be back. Uh, I didn't want to leave, but you know, some point you got to grow up, right? Go back to work. You know, put some food, no fucking brown sack. Getting to some fucking car that has a hatchback inch your way into traffic. Can I go? Can I go? Thank you. Thank you. One person who cares, you know, to put on Jack FM and sit there and cry as they call songs that you thought came out two weeks ago. Classics. Good. It's been a long time.

Speaker 1:          00:01:09       That's a 40th anniversary. Some metal heads going to co mutually the cube and the TV would go fuck yourself. All right, take off. You have rob Helford, leather studded gloves and go clean up the garbage to scope disposal. Right. What did I say? Garbage disposal. Cause that's what I think of when I think of those gloves. The ones that go all the way up to your elbows, you know, basically the glove form of superhero boots. Um, anyway, so this is the Monday morning podcast. If you're new to the podcast, welcome. Thank you for listening. I know you have your choice between mine and nine zillion other fucking podcasts. I mean at this point, I mean, you guys could all have a podcast, but why would you do that? Why would you do that when you could just sit down and listen to someone else attempt to do it?

Speaker 1:          00:02:02       I don't fucking know. Um, yes. So back in the United States and uh, I had an unbelievable trip. You know what fucking story I kept trying, I kept forgetting to tell you guys and a helmet on. It's still boring you with stories about France, but I, I did have a fucking great time over there. Um, which is an understatement. Anyways, I know like two weeks ago I told you, or last week I told you the story going to Omaha beach and the uh, the American soldiers cemetery over there and all that type of stuff. And um, one of my podcast listeners sent me an email a couple of months ago talking about how after he took the tour the next morning, he woke up early and went down to Omaha beach when there was nobody there, you know, maybe one guy with a dog and a Frisbee. Right? And he just sat there on the, uh, on the, on the beach and smoked a cigar.

Speaker 1:          00:02:58       And I was like, I got to fucking do that. Right? I gotta fucking do that. So I got my cigar, I take the tour and I got that big stupid Mercedes nine passenger bus that they rented me. Cause I wanted a car one way. And as I've told you guys, time and time again on this podcast, when you rent a car one way, you are getting the fucking ugly duckling, the one that they can't rent out. You get in the Griswold family truckster and that's what they gave me for two fucking people, nine passenger. Right? So I wake up the next morning early nehes still sleeping and um, you know, my phone is dead and I'm not going to take her phone because I don't to be here. Why did you take my phone? I was looking for it. I didn't want to deal with that. Right? So what I have is I have this gps that was the shit in about 2002.

Speaker 2:          00:03:53       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:03:54       I'm in another country. I don't speak the language. It's about eight o'clock in the morning. And I go out and I get it in this fucking nine passenger bus by myself. And I start driving and I already can't get it to say Omaha beach. I can't read half the signs. And I'm just laughing as I'm driving away going, I'm going to get lost. And I keep turning around every time I make a left to turn around. And rather than looking at a sign, I'm trying to look at something that stands out, a billboard or something. And I'm trying to remember like, remember that fucking game, Simon, right. The little colors and it would go all around is a fucking great game. Great electronic game. One of the few that I was allowed to have, my parents never gave his video games, never let us do any of that shit cause they thought it was going to affect our studies. You know, my dad's like, you're not watching that shit. Everybody. But yeah, I want to play asteroids fucking books. You know, it's funny as I still flunked everything in high school, so maybe should've let me play miss [inaudible] man.

Speaker 1:          00:05:03       Um, I didn't flunk it, but I was in the, you know, if, if my high school class was a batting lineup, I was baton eighth, right. Right before the catcher. Um, anyways, so, uh, so I get in this van and I'm fucking laughing and I'm trying to feel my way back to where the tour guy drove us. And you know, every fucking 20 seconds is a goddamn rotary round and round and round. You go and you spit out the van and I have no fucking idea where I'm at. So I'm just laughing. I'm like, I don't give a fuck. I know where the beach, I know the beaches in this direction. I'm just going in this direction. And then I know I go left, go, shh. As the French people say I'm going left and then I'm just going to drive until I see it and I'm going to get there.

Speaker 1:          00:05:50       And when smoke my cigar, I'm going to complete this fucking mission, right. And A and in way. And I'll deal with the fact that I don't know how to get back and that I have a flight to catch, you know, early afternoon. So, uh, actually it wasn't even eight in the morning. He was like nine by the time I got up or whatever. So I kind of blew the early morning part of it, but I still wanted to go smoke the cigar. So I'm driving and this fucking thing is just taken me, you know, I can't figure out how to input it. I can't, there's no enter button. I can't. I'm going Omaha beach and I'm yelling at the fucking thing and I'm screaming at the about the rental car people. How can you rent this fucking piece of shit out and charge somebody fucking 20 francs a day for this God damn thing or euros, whatever the fuck they on.

Speaker 1:          00:06:38       And I'm driving down the road and I got the radio on because I'm trying to immerse myself in the language. That's what you supposed to do when you learn a new language, you just immerse yourself in it. Although I'm sitting there speaking English, which I shouldn't be doing, I should be going mayor zoot or whatever the fuck I was supposed to be yelling. Um, but I wasn't, I was, I was speaking in English. So anyways, I had on, this is the point of the story I had on French talk radio and it was fucking hilarious. First of all to speak at 90 miles an hour. And I'm, I'm just, by the way, they're talking, you can tell basically, I don't know what they're talking about, but you can kind of figure out like what's going on. And somebody was like, you know, is we'll have a zip.

Speaker 1:          00:07:22       And then some other guy goes like [inaudible] and the other guys like [inaudible]. So it says the guy said something and the other guy goes, you know what the fuck's in? And the other guy goes, no, no, no. I'm not saying, I'm not saying it's a bad thing, I'm just, you know, I'm just saying, oh Cleo, what's up buddy? You haven't been on the podcast in a while. No, no, no, no, no, no, no. Get off the bed. Get off to bed. Get off to bed. Sorry. Can a fucking hit stop on the record button. So anyways, these guys are going back to Egypt. The most helpful. You're getting money. No then no, Eh, eh. So anyways, I'm listening to this shit and now I'm driving into fog. I'm completely fucking lost and I'm listening to these guys. And what's funny over there is when people talk and they're searching for a word, they don't go, ah, cause that's actually a word like Isla.

Speaker 1:          00:08:11       So you'd be like, have, so you be going have, you wouldn't do that. So what they do, they say is this is, this is my, I think this is what's going on. So rather than going I or, um, they go, Ooh, like e the EU are almost, Ooh. And so they kept doing that going, Ooh, as I'm driving through the fucking fog and I'm laughing, just go, Ooh, imitating the Shit is, I'm trying to find this beach. And then, you know, like when you trying to make a point in any language, you're like, you know, this guy is, is, is, is, or you know, these people, what they traded do it, whatever you say, like the fucking word, like 15 times in a row. So that's what they kept going. They kept going like

Speaker 3:          00:08:56       a [inaudible] do, do, do.

Speaker 1:          00:09:00       And I'm driving in the fog. Go, go on a

Speaker 1:          00:09:06       stupid fucking French people. I was screaming about them and the stupid thing and long story short, this fucking, this fucking a tare, mapquest, whatever the fuck you call it makes me go left. I'm going down these farm roads. All right. And now it literally feels like it's 1944 and some Germans are going to come around the corner with a motorcycle and a sidecar. I'm driving by the, uh, the hedge rows. I'm getting to like dark roads and I'm just laughing. I have no fucking idea where I'm at. It's foggy. I'm on a road that's so fucking small, like I literally have to pull this bus over to let somebody else go by. They give the wave over there, by the way, and I'm just driving a

Speaker 3:          00:09:55       Ooh,

Speaker 1:          00:09:56       drive on my way through this fucking thing. And I finally make it to the road like an hour later and my flight is leaving at two and a half hours. I have no fucking idea how to get back. And I get to the place where I'm going to make the left to drive up to the beach and it says road closed, you know, and you gotta be sitting there going, Bill, you know, 3000 people died that way that day. I mean on that beach. They saw their mission through, they just kept common and common and common until they fucking met their objective. Are you going to let one little French police barricade that says erect or stop, whatever the fuck it says you're going to let that stop you or are you just going to drive this nine passenger van around it and use the fact that you don't speak the language as a God damn. Excuse it.

Speaker 3:          00:10:54       Ooh, do, do, do, do

Speaker 1:          00:10:56       right. I pussied out. I was just like, I gotta go to the fucking airport. I don't even know where I'm at. And I fucking turned around like the coward that cries in the foxhole. So now I've drive it back into the fog

Speaker 4:          00:11:10       as you, but do you have it? You have to a do a De, de, de, de and all. Uh,

Speaker 1:          00:11:17       those kinds sweats all teeth. Drive it back into this fucking fog.

Speaker 5:          00:11:23       Okay.

Speaker 4:          00:11:23       And will you on Joey? Doo, Doo, Doo Doo.

Speaker 1:          00:11:27       And don't, it took me like fucking, it took me like fucking two hours. We almost missed our goddamn flight. I'm driving around rotary after fucking rotary and I can't find this place. And then finally I came in bay. You, they have like this old part of town, you know, they got all the lead home strip malls and shit. Not Strip malls, but just like just regular shit please to get 1 cent beach, um, awesome. [inaudible] on jewelry. They got all that bullshit, right? But then in the center of town, they have like the old school, like, like the old part of town, like old Montreal, Old Vegas, whatever the fuck you want to call it. So I see this church and I'm like, I remember that fucking church. My hotel is somewhere near that church and there's a little brook near it. So I drive back and it was the most frustrating half hour my life. Cause I knew that I was near my fucking hotel, but I just couldn't find the fucking thing. And finally

Speaker 1:          00:12:33       I found the brook and what I had to do, I had to just, I just got out of the van and started walking around and then I finally, and I'm walking up to people and I'm going, uh, uh, excuse me. Um, why? Uh, I was doing that. I was going, ah, so it's actually going to excuse him. Why subsequent, excuse me, have, um, or has whatever I'm saying. I was like, excuse him, why [inaudible] uh, Winston Churchill Motel, motel day, Winston Churchill, because that wasn't even named my hotel, but I, my hotel was right next to it and then it would be like, uh, Jenna, they go, God dammit, fuck. And I, it took me like five people walking up to him, um, and I finally was able to find the brook and then I found it and I saw them if there's my fucking hotel. And then I just took this, I had to run back to the van and weave my way around it. I'm freaking out, no one, my wife's going to be pissed at me and I finally get to the hotel and, uh, we got enough time to get to the airport and I fucking go in a hotel room and she's still sleeping. She's still sleeping. She's like, hey baby, did you make it to the beach? And I was like, no, I couldn't find it. That stupid piece of shit. Mapquest fucking thing from 1982 took me down a country road and she just goes, oh, why didn't you just take my phone honey? And that's the story.

Speaker 1:          00:14:11       Um, but anyways, I'm keeping up with my, my French shit. Um, I'm going to try to, uh, I dunno, I gave up on the Spanish stuff. I just, there's something about the French language where I flunked it for three years in high school and it's familiar and I, and I feel like maybe through learning French I could somehow learn Spanish. I don't know. A lot of you guys are sitting there going, fuck you, Bill. You're never going to learn this shit. And you know what? I thrive off of that. Go Fuck Yourself. I'm going to learn how to speak it. And when I do, I'm going to do an entire podcast and French on for, I'll say, all right, let's do some advertising for this week. He voice everybody.

Um, oh by the way, uh, I've been obsessed with, um, with German cars ever since. Um, I went on that day, that Dee day trip, you know, and I looked at one of our tanks, you know, our tag basically if a Chevy Chevette was a tank, that's what the fuck we were rolling out a, which once again is, I'm really starting to understand why Tom Brokaw called them the greatest generation because, uh, I, I couldn't even make it to Omaha beach in a fucking Mercedes Benz nine passenger with fucking satellite help you, these tanks compared to what the Germans had.

Speaker 1:          00:17:43       It's unfucking believable. So I actually, I, you guys got to see this video that I watched this week. If you're into, they basically show, um, then putting together the engine that they stick in one of their unbelievable cars. And this guy hand builds the entire thing. What the help of some actually some really cool robots and you know that I'm not into robots, but what I like about these robots is they're doing the pain in the ass job that you don't want to do. Like you know when you squeeze that fucking glue I guess to basically, I don't know if you're sealing the head to the block, I thought there was a gasket there. I have no idea. It was one of those deals. I didn't one of those deals, but this fucking robot thing just, it's got the, the sealer and it fucking goes right around the edge.

Speaker 1:          00:18:27       And then when he get to his screw it goes like around the rotary, like me in the bus and then just fucking continues on and it's perfect. Then you line up. So basically the guy puts the whole glorious engine together and then in the end he has his own seal with his name. He puts his fucking name on the engine and a, I was like, oh my God, I got to get a Mercedes someday. And then I looked up how much they cost and I was like, oh my God, I got to rent a Mercedes someday.

Speaker 1:          00:18:58       I know he can get some of the smaller ones, but you know the one you fucking want, you know, you know the Mercedes you want, you don't want to get those fucking, the lower end ones. Fuck those ones. You want the one that you're walking up to, somebody opens the door for you and you have a briefcase handcuffed to your fucking wrist. That's the model you want. Like the one I looked up, I'm like, well fuck this. What's the best one that got? So they're uh, basically in the BMW's got the m's, the m series, the m five [inaudible] three and all that with Mercedes, they have the AMG. So I'm like, oh, let me check out was a fucking four door sedan. They weren't a $237,000 for this fucking thing, you know? And I was just like, all right, well, you know, that was, that was, that was a fun fantasy.

Speaker 1:          00:19:44       Maybe they'll go buy a used one from somebody getting a goddamned divorce or some shit. I don't know what, but I definitely got to, hopefully I'll remember. Maybe I'll make a note right now. I'll do that. Cause I always say, and I'm going to put that video up. Hey everybody, I'm putting the video up and a, I guess what it's going to be up on the website and it never is. If you guys just saw how I just typed Mercedes with my right hand, I'm lefthanded Mer ces mercies. MERCI. MERCI. Wait a minute. I put the damn, I swear to God. Am I do I am also dyslexia. M. E r. C. E. D. E. S. That looks right. Right? Mercedes video. Stupid. Why do you have to install your yourself? Why can't you love yourself and just tie a string around your finger? Um, anyways. Yes. So I am back in the United States of America and uh, I'm getting back to a, watching American sports and um, Jesus Christ, my picks week, I swear to God and the Nhl.

Speaker 1:          00:20:49       What a fucking train wreck that was. That was like some Paul Versey Shit. I went on there and I only picked one upset. I really hope he hears that. Can you guys please send that link to him like Paul? Like please send to this entire section if he can't. Paul, you listen to this. I went, I did what you did. I went with all the fucking favorites and I'm going to give you my results right now. If you're listening. New Jersey Zone, dude, I called it Paul Versey. Alright. Flyers verse the Rangers. I picked the fucking, that series is actually one one. Boston, Detroit. I picked a Bruins. That series is one. One. Uh, Montreal actually picked Montreal. Jesus Christ. Where the fuck are all my losses? Oh yeah, San Jose, Los Angeles. I picked Los Angeles. I guess they're not the favorites, but I looked at San Jose fucking they like when the president's trophy every year. Then they fucking, they lose usually in the first goddamn round. I'm not shitting on the San Jose Sharks. Come on Jack. Mvp Sports. We got all the jerseys. We got the shacks. The seal is the charges in more. Um, I'll never forget that. Read every time I say San Jose Sharks, I always think about MVP sports in Boston. Um,

Speaker 1:          00:22:08       yeah, so I just, they just stay. They do whatever year. I'm stating a fact. Alright. Pittsburgh. Columbus. I picked the, uh, the penguins. That's one. One. Colorado, Minnesota. Pick Minnesota that download to Chicago. Saint Louis. I picked the blues. I bet. I'm sorry I picked Chicago. They're down o two. I don't know. But anyways, it's been a hell of a fucking, uh, actually my, wait a minute, let's go back here. Was I that bad? Maybe I'm giving versus a compliment. All right. Minnesota while they pick them, they download two black hawks. They down. Oh two. I did pick the ducks. I picked the king's deer down. O Two. I picked J I think that I'm doing all right. Look, if the brewers win this series and the fucking penguins win that series and the flyers when then I, I think I'm all right. And then, you know what I would hope Paul Versey and apology. Um, anyways, how great is the playoffs, man? I swear to God, if you're still watch an NBA hoop, I understand it. It's a great game to watch, but come on. Why don't you watch a real fucking leak instead of the NBA? Who's kidding? Who if you really watched the NBA, I mean that is the most manipulated fucking sport.

Speaker 2:          00:23:21       Okay?

Speaker 1:          00:23:21       I mean, I know it's all, all of them are a God damn business. I would say the NFL is the least manipulated. And I know a lot of people don't like the new rules, but everybody's got to play by him. But like I've said this a zillion times, but everybody's got to fucking Seahawks. Goddamn Seahawks. Just want to fucking Superbowl.

Speaker 2:          00:23:40       Okay,

Speaker 1:          00:23:40       that's great. One of the fuck of the Marin is going to be in a position where they could spend money to compete with the red sox and the Yankees and they can give me a break and ain't fucking happening. Although they just blew a bunch of money on Robinson Cano.

Speaker 5:          00:23:54       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:23:55       Paul versus man crush.

Speaker 5:          00:23:57       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:23:59       They had the fuck. They said what a bunch of idiots they were. Did they learn anything from the Texas fucking ranges? You know, blow 200 million on a shortstop and you have no money for pitching. So you didn't blow 200 oh what if it's on the other side of second base? What's a little fucking blow 200 million on this guy. So anyways, the uh, yeah, the NBA is basically a, I feel like the NBA is like, it's like wrestling two years before they admitted that it's just was all right, you know, were fake fighting but we're really hurting each other and then everybody was just like, all right cool. You know, and we'll, we'll go with this. That's what they should do in the NBA. Just go look, they're really playing the games. But you know, we got to make sure certain teams get to a certain point in the playoffs so we could get the ratings we need so we can all make our money and we refused to pay the referees anything more than we're giving them, despite the fact that an, an NBA official has more power than any other official in the four major sports.

Speaker 5:          00:25:07       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:25:08       Now I just pause there cause I went for all the fucking more on sports fans will be like, yeah, you put the bullshit. It's true. No other sport. Can you just sit at fucking guy down a star player. You can sit them down in the first quarter. Give them two quick ones. Second quarter, give him that. I've said this a zillion fucking time. She can keep them on the bench. The whole God damn game. Yeah. You can't keep Tom Brady on the bench. You, you'd have to kick them out for something. But what does Tom Brady going to do that's gonna make you kick them out? Huh? You could, what are you gonna penalize him for his Dimbleby in too deep. Right? Do you going to take out some measuring things? Stick like woods. Somebody has like a two curve to stick in hockey. You're not throwing them out anyways. I'm not saying you can't manipulate the game, but nowhere can you manipulate it more than the fucking NBA. So I'm just saying come on over and watch the fucking hockey. It's, it's been unbelievable so far. And, uh, the Bruins, uh, Detroit series is, is, is shaping up to go seven games. It's been fucking great. Uh, the game one.

Speaker 5:          00:26:12       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:26:13       I mean, they just made us look old and slow. Detroit is so God damn fast. And let me ask you this. When was the last time you saw Detroit Redwings team where every pass wasn't tape to tape. Like what, 1994. I mean, they going on like fucking 17 years. The puck movement on that team is fucking unbelievable. And that souk is from another planet. That goal that he scored to win game one. It was so fucking good. I couldn't even get mad. I mean, it definitely took the wind out of my sails, but I was just like, Jesus Christ, that was the thing of fucking beauty. Um, that backhand pass he had in game two. He's fucking incredible. And uh, so what, anyways, they basically, for those of you who weren't watching, they, um, they were just flying all around the ice and we look like we were like a division two hockey team trying to keep up with them. So you knew what was going to happen. All right. Game Two, we're going to get physical and that's what we were able to do. So now game three, uh, is coming up. Now they're going to adjust.

Speaker 5:          00:27:16       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:27:17       You know, to us getting physical with them, you know, it's always hard after you won a fucking game too. Um,

Speaker 1:          00:27:26       you know, to win that next game in the playoffs because you know, you won the game, so you're like, yeah, I guess we keep doing what we're doing. You basically have to wait to see the other teams adjustments. That's why I love playoff series and uh, and that type of stuff. So I know there's a bunch of Detroit Redwings fangs and haters or the Bruins fans. Right now you probably have your face like a centimeter away from your Jesus Christ. How long was that in Europe? Like an inch away from your fucking a millimeter away from your, uh, your recording device right now going, is he going to bring up Milan, Lou Cheech in his piece of shit? Yes. Move. Absolutely. Somebody said go. I would love to hear you. Dyfed Milan blue cheese. He basically speared this guy.

Speaker 5:          00:28:09       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:28:11       Like I think he got half taint, half ball bag, hopefully the guys balls, hopefully Milan stick. He basically, he hit the sweet spot of the ball bag that causes both of your fucking balls to go sideways. Like those side impact airbags just fucking to the side. And then his stick came down before they clang back together, which still would definitely hurt. But when are they going to clang back together? You'd rather be bald the ball rather than both balls hitting the fucking wood or the whatever the fuck his sticks made out of. Now that's the second time he's done that in three fucking weeks and I can't defend it. I think he should've got suspended. I think it's a fucking joke that that was a $5,000 fine. $5,000 fine. So basically what you're telling me NHL is you're telling me that Danny Dekeyser, Kaiser's balls are worth no more than 2,500 each. Is that what you're telling me? I'm your for your basically fucking with the man's ability to start a family. This goes beyond the game. A hockey

Speaker 5:          00:29:27       that,

Speaker 1:          00:29:29       look, you know what it is, is it's, it's a new move. I haven't seen anybody do that consistently. I've seen somebody while somebody is looking at him, you know, and it's the shaft of the, and they'll kind of fucking bring it up like that. Oh, he acted it out. You like that? No, fucking bring it up. But to have a guy skating up the fucking ice, not even looking at you and you come there and you turn your stick in the blade up.

Speaker 2:          00:29:55       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:29:56       And give the guy a fucking would up a cut to his Tate and ball area. I mean, Jesus Christ.

Speaker 1:          00:30:03       I'll tell you that. That's, that's some new forensic shit right there. You know, actually you don't use that. That's actually the only person who knows what that bruises looks like is a Gyn forensics. Actually, I got, I got, I got a Bruce Ball bag and taint one time. I don't know if I ever told you guys this story. I was working in a warehouse and a, we had a softball team. I was basically an excuse for people to drink fucking, uh, cause lite and wine coolers. It was the 80s, the lady's tea did drink the wine coolers and then when I played in the league, it was right before, you know, wine coolers suggest come out. So there was actually a few guys having some out of a four pack. Uh, and it was, it was that maybe that three week window before it closed where you're, your entire manhood was judged if you ever had a fucking wine cooler.

Speaker 1:          00:30:57       But there was, when they first came out, you know, Bartles and Jaymes these two fucking cute old guys doing these silly commercials that it was actually, oh, let me try this. You know, they, that was the, that that was like the Zima version of wine. So anyways, anyways, so whatever, I'm on base, I'm trying to go first to third on some fucking single, the right. And My boss is on third base and the ball comes in. Oh, came in from left field. So I must've been on second base. I never had any wheels, so there's no fucking way. I was trying to go first to third on something that's left. So I'm running into second and I come in standing up and they threw the ball was, maybe it was the centerfield cause they throw it to the outside a third base. So he's basically, he's reaching over on the, into foul territory and he back handed backhand. How did he do it? Yay. He backhanded it and then swooped up to try to tag me. And I came in standing up and he fucking with the ball in the web of his glove, went fucking full lop to my fucking under carriage. And I remember standing on third base waiting for the paint,

Speaker 1:          00:32:11       you know, like it didn't happen at first. And then immediately I'm thinking of that Eddie Murphy bit that he did on one of his specials where when you get hit in the balls so bad, there's that delay and then the, uh, then, then, then yeah, that's usually a medium hit. If you get hit in the balls really bad, you just go, oh, and you go down. But if there's that there's that light to medium hit where you get hit and it, there's a delay in the penalty, the penalty, the, the, the pain. Um, I dunno, Eddie Murphy did a fucking phenomenal bid on it. So anyways, and it never came. And I'm standing there and I'm sitting there waiting for people to start giving me shit to be like, dude, you just got hit in the balls and you didn't feel any pain. How small are they? Right. And it wasn't until like fucking like two, three days later, I'm in the shower, right? And I'm cleaning myself and all of a sudden I just fucking, I don't know how I, they all had a fuck. Do you look at your tank? I Dunno. I was washing my ball bag and I saw a little bit of Cola, right. Look down and I swear to God, the back half of my sac right to the tape was like popsicle purple.

Speaker 1:          00:33:34       All right. And I didn't even feel that. So I can't even imagine what fucking poor daddy to cars, his ball bag and fucking taint look when he took a piece of lumber. I mean, it's just completely, and I'm gonna say this, Milan, Lou Cheech, he had up until this point, other than just the haters that don't like it because he's a classic power forward that can score goals and beat the fuck out of anybody on your team if he chooses.

Speaker 5:          00:34:06       Right.

Speaker 1:          00:34:08       And I don't want to hear any of you guys going like, go blue picto he booked on the fucking, who the fuck was the goad the Canadians had back in the day? He was actually one of the, uh, uh, I shouldn't say gone. He was the one, he made it an art form. Charles, uh, George de la rock. He's like, why does he fight that guy? And it's just like, well, okay, we're trying to win a hockey game here is stupid. So we're supposed to have a fucking all star square off with the goat. Okay. Keep calling him a goon square off with the goddamn artist of fighting, fighting a martial artists on skates. He supposed to fight this guy. All right? I'm not saying he would have won, but he couldn't hold, held his zone. He's a fucking big guy, but he's risking injury and he's going to be sitting in the penalty box.

Speaker 1:          00:34:57       We don't have him for five fucking minutes. And you don't have George. Laura could stupid. It's fucking stupid. That's like people yesterday was gay. Well, it gave me shit on Twitter asking why Chara didn't fight that guy that he was a foot taller than that guy was trying to go to him into dropping the gloves. So he sits in the penalty box and anybody who fucking says the chart was a pussy because he didn't fight that guy. You're a fucking moron and you don't understand the game. I don't have any care how many fucking games you watched. So Danal Chara arguably still the best defenseman in the league. If not, he's top two or three.

Speaker 2:          00:35:33       Okay,

Speaker 1:          00:35:34       so he's going to drop the gloves with the forward and then it go sit down and maybe get an extra two. We're an entirely different team. When that guy's in the box, you're, you're a fucking moron. You saw him laughing at the guy going, all right, you drop him first. Even then, that would have been stupid. So anyways, loot Cheech, he only had one bad incident as far as, now granted I'm also prejudice cause I'm a Bruins fan was when he fucking took a run at a Ryan Miller. A hope. I'm getting these names right dude. I'm still a little jet. Like that didn't sound right when I said it. Reggie Miller, Ryan Miller. Um,

Speaker 2:          00:36:13       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:36:13       So he had that one. Everybody has their one, I got pissed and I got far state of Blah Blah. But now he's got that and he's got two Spearings of the under carriage. So I think from Milan to get his rep back, he's going to have to be like lady big for the next seven years. But I think that those two, are they going to haunt them for awhile? You can't fucking do that. You can't do that. And that's a God damn shame that the Nhl said that poor Danny dekeyser is fucking balls and only worth $2,500 each. I mean they come on though. Those guys at pawn shop would have given you more fucking money for those. And those guys don't pay shit. Hey, can I get 2,500 for the my balls? And then that bald headed guy, it'd be like, he'd be like, and how much you really want?

Speaker 1:          00:37:01       2,500 each year, cunt. I hate that everybody a pussy on the, on that fucking show when he comes walking in, you come in with that whatever you got. And he's like, Oh yeah, that looks great. What do you want for it? It would, no matter what you say, can I get 1 cent for this? He is. How much do you really want? He's fucking joke. That's what I want. Fuck off. Now it's 2 cents. Um, anyways, that's why I stopped watching that show. There's something about the way that they do that that I don't enjoy it yet. I can watch fast and loud and I think it's absolutely fucking hilarious watching Richard Rawlings bus, those people down. There's just something, I don't know the way he does it. It's so God damn funny if you guys watch any of the new episodes.

Speaker 2:          00:37:44       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:37:45       Where he went up and he met some guy named so and so, six pack Magoo, whatever his fucking name in the middle of Minnesota and the guys shit faced and he gives Richard's buddy literally Ajara moonshine that that guy starts drinking. I forget what the fuck they went. What were they trying to buy? Oh, a 57 Chevy. Is that what it was? Was that the one with the dent in it? I think he got it from that guy.

Speaker 1:          00:38:12       So he's trying to bust the guy down to like 1500 bucks for this and it is, it is a hunk of shit. But he, but it's a 57 Chevy so he knows that, you know, he can flip this thing and this guy's hammered and he wants 1800 bucks and Richard won't go above 1500 so the guy breaks out some days and they rolled the dice on the hood of the car and he right there. I mean it's just, come on, let's fucking America right there by way he lost and he had to pay an 1800 bucks, but still we got a 57 1800 bucks. It was a good, I'm, I'm, I'm totally on a tangent here. Um, so anyways, so there you go to Detroit, red wings fans and everybody else and I want you to remember this. All right? You myopic cunts. When somebody on your team does something filthy, don't be that Douche in the sports bar who just, who just blindly defend your fucking team. If you have somebody on your team does a piece of shit move, you've got to call him. He got to call it out and say it's a piece of shit move. And that was an unbelievable fucking piece of shit move. He should've got suspended and, and like, come on,

Speaker 1:          00:39:10       my balls are worth more than 2,500 bucks each. And I'm not, I'm not, I'm not in the playoffs. I'm not even in the league. I played pickup hockey. Okay. And if you fucking hit me in the nuts hard enough. All right. When I go to sue you, I'm not suing you for five grand. All right, so there we go. There we go. We are well into the podcast here. The poor like yest uh oh hey Billy red face. It's got to do some standup comedy here cause I have not done any standup comedy since a uh, I did the uh, the all ins. I hosted the all end tore down it

Speaker 1:          00:39:52       and um, so I'm going to shake the rust off. I've got a bunch of Shit I want to talk about cause I'm doing some gigs this week in Portland, Oregon and Oregon. Portland, Maine, sorry, Montpelier, Vermont in Albany, New York. I believe that those are the three gigs I'm doing this weekend. I could probably go to my podcast and my website, maybe get that information for you. I could probably do something like that and be organized. But that then again then if I did that, it would not be the Monday morning podcasts now would it? Um, speaking of, uh, podcast, uh, the wonderful all things comedy.

Speaker 5:          00:40:27       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:40:54       All right. If he dean Edwards name sounds familiar, that's because you've seen him on a Colin Ferguson SNL cast member or now an MTV two's hit the guy code.

So you drag that Dell as blade across your face for two, three, 10 weeks. Who knows? Depends on how broke you are. Why do you do that to yourself? Jesus Christ. Bill, is there a solution?

Hey, they have freckles, the clown. I'm a married guy in my mid thirties. I don't want to bore everyone with the details, but I recently got cheated, got caught cheating on my wife with a 25 year old lady.

Speaker 1:          00:46:08       The affair went on for about four months. And the truth is I really started to like this girl after getting caught and spending a few nights in a hotel, my wife graciously suggest that we work up with that we work on our marriage and try to put this mess behind us. We have two small church children, so all logic points to me agreeing to get the help we need and to move on with our marriage. The only problem is that I can't get this other girl out of my mind. These women are two polar opposites of each other. My wife, uh, a professional, more conservative woman and the other girl is a 25 year old party girl. I know what the clear answer is, but I do. I snap out of this and put this other girl out of my mind. All right? This is a very simple one, sir. First of all, your wife is a saint. All right? That she's going to take you back and I'm not judging you all right? I am a man. We've all been there, all right? She's a sate that she's gonna fucking take you back. All right, so you got to treat it like that one. And secondly, what do you do? How do you get this girl out of your mind? Easy. You wake up in the morning,

Speaker 1:          00:47:22       you walk into a bathroom, you close the door and you'll rub one out tour, and then you get on with your fucking day. All

Speaker 2:          00:47:29       go in there, close the door, rub one out.

Speaker 1:          00:47:33       When you'd done rubbing one out, it's just going to hit you. What am I out of my fucking mind. Let's to you describe, you know these women, they're two polar opposites. My wife is a professional, more conservative woman and the other is a 25 year old party girl. Why don't you just say it? Your wife is a kind of girl you marry and this other girl is a fucking whore. All right? Nah, it's not worth it. Just fucking, just get it out of his, I'm telling you,

Speaker 1:          00:48:03       if you're any sort of an intelligent human being, the second year rub one out, you're going to be thinking, I don't want to call that other girl. What am I a fucking idiot? You're going to look at your kids. What the hell was I thinking? All right, other than that, if you don't, you're an idiot. All right? Because this is what's going to happen, sir. You're going to lose your wife. Your kids are going to hate you. You're gonna lose your house. You could end up on a Futon in a studio apartment and that 25 year old party girl is going to move on to somebody else and you're going to be left daily. Get Dick in your hand. So both scenarios, you ended up with your Dick and your hand. Would you like to do it in a four bedroom house or a fucking studio apartment with empty Chinese food containers all around as you cry yourself to sleep, wondering what the fuck happened? Jesus, I gave him the lumber there. Didn't, I was a little loose cheeks there. I gave him the fucking stick between the balls there. Um, all right, next one. I am a hideous human being. Dear bill, I'll be straight to the point. I am 25 years old and I have been a closet homosexual for as long as I can remember.

Speaker 1:          00:49:07       Well Dude, you're gay so you will gave the second you were born. That's like me being, I'm, I'm a straight as long as I can remember. I guess you've been in the closet is what you're trying to say. I don't you confuse me. Maybe you're right. Maybe this is another example of me being dumb. Maybe I've read the sentence wrong. Who knows, who cares? Let's continue sentence number three. I come from a strict Asian immigrant family and my parents would commit suicide if they found out about my orientation. You know, I got scared when I saw the first you basic, you know, orientation. If you take off the shun and put the elder, that was the word that I thought Oriental was coming on and I was going to get in trouble here. Um, therefore I've been committing petty crimes for the past few years to get into jail so I could pursue and nurture my homosexuality. You calling bullshit on, I'll answer this but I'm calling bullshit on this one. But there is something for the, I gotta tell you though, this is a very unique lie, so this could actually be true. You know what? I'm going to go with this like it's true just in case it is true and I don't want to be yet another person turning my back on this person. All right, so here we go. Recently I was locked up after I took three tabs of acid and I don't really remember how I got into the can when I became sober. During my trip I saw a thousand dog bites.

Speaker 1:          00:50:34       Oh, when you were tripping, you saw a thousand dog bites at me from every direction and it was the worst drug experience of my life. That's why I wasn't surprised when I woke up in jail anyway, I was quite relieved to be away from society until eight hours later I was released by my parents. The cops called them while I was tripping in jail. My question is if it's better to be in jail, happy and away from society or an unhappy and vision individual that satisfies his parents and social excellence. Oh, if it's better, dude, what are you doing? If this is actually true, come on man, you keep,

Speaker 1:          00:51:12       you gotta be who you are. All right? And, uh, I think every day, I don't know where you live in the world, but every single day, uh, I, I just feel like it's that scales are tipping in the more enlightened favorable direction and you know what? You can become a part of that tipping of the scale. Um, seeing that, that, that kid who's going into the NFL, when he talked about my, I read that story how when he finally came out to his teammates and he felt like a cinder block came off as just, I know the feeling of having to carry something around. I don't know where to tell that fucking level. So

Speaker 2:          00:51:52       yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:51:52       I don't think you're going to regret it. All right. Your parents aren't going to fucking kill themselves. It might take them a while

Speaker 2:          00:52:01       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:52:01       To come around. All right. But if they don't, you know what? Fuck them. Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:52:10       Yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:52:11       I think they will because at the end of the day, you're their kid. All right, but what the fuck do I know? But at the end of the day, they're there. Every kid at the end of the day has to make a break with their parents on some level where your philosophies do not line up with theirs. And if you're truly going to pursue what's gonna make you happy in life, there has to be the cutting, you know, the metaphorical cutting of the umbilical cord. And you have to be like, you know what? Fuck them. I know when I was a little kid, to me they were gods and I wanted their approval. And at the end of the day, I now realize that they're human beings and they have their flaws. And what they want me to do does not fit in with what I want to do. And if you're not hurting anybody, which you're not, dude, w what do you think? You could dig it. You gotta go to jail and find love. I mean that it's not a GE. Not exactly going with some healthy fucking people. That's like, that would be like if a woman wanted to find a good boyfriend and she fucking went to a place where raw guys were locked up for abuse and women. You know what I mean?

Speaker 1:          00:53:12       Those are some, uh, yeah, you can find a better boyfriend than that. Just go to a gay bar, I would say. You know, or whatever. I don't pretend to know what the fuck you, that's bad. That's me saying to a woman, hey, you want to be the good guy? Go to a bar. Whatever. We've reached the end of my intelligence on this topic we probably did about five minutes ago, but I'm too dumb to realize it. But Dude, if this is real, I'm treating it real. Hello. It's so fucking crazy. I don't, I don't, I don't know. Don't do that. All right. If this is actually true, I'm choosing to believe it. Don't fucking do that. All right, beloved. God, just sit up doubt. I don't know how you would do it. I, you just got to sit him down. Just say it. Just get it out there and then you set it and that it's out there. Yeah. You know, I don't know what to do after that. You know what? Why don't you go meet a gay guy? I'm sure he can fucking give you some advice. Why you asking me? Why am I yelling at you? I got frustrated because I don't have the answers. I feel bad for you if it's true. All right. I hope it works out. Don't fucking go to jail. All right,

Speaker 1:          00:54:26       big gaze. Great. You fucking in great shape. You've got all this disposable income and wherever you're living you're, you're making the fucking property value go up.

Speaker 5:          00:54:37       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:54:38       It's a lot of advantages,

Speaker 5:          00:54:41       you know?

Speaker 1:          00:54:46       Anyways, let's plow ahead. Where are we? 54 minutes. Okay. X Won't sell house. Dear Bill, big fan met you in Jacksonville a while back. I have a quick question for you. My ex fiance and I were together for four and a half years. Why the fuck did you buy a house with somebody you're not married to? All right. Now that that doesn't help you. But if anybody listening, do not buy a house, do that. Live with somebody you're not going to marry. Do not buy a house with somebody you're not going to if you're not married. Don't do that shit. Anyways. During the relationship she read, she remained loyal while I was deployed to the Middle East and upon my return I used my saved up money to buy a house with her near the beach. Oh my God. If this fucking woman, this is going to somehow make a claim to your house that you bought with your serving for our country, putting your life on the line money. This would be a new level of whoredom. Is that a new word? I think a hoard them.

Speaker 5:          00:55:52       All right.

Speaker 1:          00:55:54       Am I not even really, I know it's a new word, but that night and I'd be the proper use of of it already, which would be very apropos for the type of fucking moron I am. Alright. Hang on a second. Where the hell I am is okay. It was her dream house and I felt that if the deployment didn't ruin us, that nothing would, well, I was wrong. We decided to split and I tried to be Amy a couple. Did I say that right? And let her keep the house. If she could pay me the closing costs of about eight grand. This is what guys do. They just want to cut bait and fucking leave. Women got that fucking, they burrow in. She agreed. All right.

Speaker 1:          00:56:35       Why did you do that? She agreed and I move. You bought the fucking house. Did she kick in for it? Maybe I'm being too hard on her. I Dunno. She agreed and I moved back home to New Jersey to start a new life. It's been nearly a year and she's has stalled every effort to get this resolved. When a contract was finally in place, she decided it needed some amendments to protect herself. That basically left me with less money than we agreed and getting her a house worth 150 grand for 8,000 bucks. Dude, I swear to fucking God if I read one more of these fucking stories. All right, and if you're some fucking woman, all right, and you, you host one of these shows where you always talking about the shit that men do. How about your balance it out? The way I balanced it out saying that Lou cheats did a piece of shit. Fucking move. Why don't you bring this shit up? This is ridiculous.

Speaker 1:          00:57:26       He goes, I throw out the contract and contract, contacted a realtor to list the house. They go, she's refused to sell and her name is on the title because I'm a fucking idiot. Long story short, after I threatened a lawsuit, a mysterious man who called himself a family friend, emailed me and asked to act as the facilitator for the deal between the two of us. My ex do. Don't give into that. My access not been involved since, and this guy is a real cunt who was only out for her. My cousin, who was a lawyer is guiding me through the process, but I need some advice from you on how to resolve this issue. I just found out that the family friend is my new ex's new boyfriend. I could've told you that. My question is how do I let them know that I know I'm like a serial killer who needs to be caught? What? I'm like a serial killer. Who needs to be caught? Her man caught here, man. What typo there? I can't resist them thinking. I don't, I guess no anymore. I thought a nice joke barred her having herpes would be a good start. I joked that she was too selfish to even give me that. Any feedback or advice on the podcast would really be appreciated. Um, I usually say cut bait, but fuck that. Fuck that.

Speaker 2:          00:58:45       Fuck that.

Speaker 1:          00:58:48       Uh, you have two options here and I don't want to tell you what the second one is. Uh, the first one is, well, you have three fight this, which I would walk away from it, which I wouldn't. And number three would involve a convenient accident that happened to the house, but even then, then she probably fight you for the, uh, uh, they'd figured out you started the fire. Don't, don't, I shouldn't even brought that up. Listen, this is what you gotta do. You just got to accept the fact that you were in for a long fight here and that lawyers are going to get most of the money, but that bitch is not going to get the house now to go that route. Oh God, I don't want to tell you to quit, but my world, I would just be like, look, you want 150,000 fucking dollar house, just take the fucking house free and clear.

Speaker 5:          00:59:55       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:59:56       It costs you 150 grand to get rid of this fucking devil woman that's going to take that new guide down. She's going to take that guy down.

Speaker 5:          01:00:04       Yeah,

Speaker 1:          01:00:04       it, I mean, granted, I only heard your side of the story. All right. And I'm taking this as the truth and if this is the truth that, that that's not the, that's not you. You don't want that devil woman in your fucking life. That is some evil fucking shit.

Speaker 5:          01:00:19       MMM.

Speaker 1:          01:00:22       Ah, okay. I got to walk away from this story because it's, it's actually making me fucking mad and I don't have a dog in the fight here. What I'm doing is I am inserting myself into the story, who I would be in this fucking story of, uh, Jesus do. You're young, you're young. Get into the best shape of your life. Hit on women out of your fucking league and then treat her like a fucking Queen Mary her and then walked by this bitch someday on the street. That's what I would do. All right. Oh, you fucking cunt. How long to wait for sex? Short and simple.
