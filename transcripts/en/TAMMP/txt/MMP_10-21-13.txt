Speaker 1:          00:00:01       Hey, what's going on? It's bill burn. It's the Monday morning podcast from Monday. Um, October 21st, 2013. How you're fucking doing. Why is this such an echo in here? Hi.

Speaker 2:          00:00:20       Um, I'm in a hotel room. A splash fully furnished hotel room here. That's why it's echoing a little bit and it'll good. You know what? This will help my awful singing, you know? Oh, you'll know. Dasher and dancer and Prancer and vixen. Um, how are you? How was your weekend? As you could tell him a little banged up, a little banged up. Didn't get a lot of sleep last night. You know what? I've been in the phone

Speaker 1:          00:00:47       fog last 10 days. I was kidding. Who lasts like 10 weeks. I've been on the road. I would work my ass off and a dad, daddy's been taking his medicine every night. And uh, you know what? I'm in a fog. I need to, I need to, uh, you know, I need to turn over a new leaf here. I got to become like that dude. Remember those grape nup commercials? We'd be outside and his fucking bathrobe, you know, one leg up on the fucking wouldn't see couple of squirrels running around the background. Some birds tweeting and he's just eaten as grape nuts. All clearheaded. Right. That's why I need to be all right. I got to quit. I sound like shit. Getting over a cold. I'm a message this week everybody. You know what, this should make you feel better about yourself. You know, we I at least I didn't uh, didn't fucking Bay the way Ya Bill Bandwagon did this weekend. You guys have been following me on Twitter. That's my new character Bill Bandwagon. I was joking on Twitter that the Boston red sox signed the first free agent fan to a three week contract. We'll bandwagon and that is make an I am him. Bill Bandwagon does what bill bandwagon dough. I will actually went over to the red sox pro shop here in Boston and I went over to it. Um,

Speaker 3:          00:02:11       okay.

Speaker 2:          00:02:12       Well during the, whenever the fuck we were playing Detroit this past weekend, uh, I walked into the pro shop and I literally, I got sick to my stomach. How weird is that? Cause I bought so much red sox shit

Speaker 2:          00:02:24       right up during the whole height of that curse to the babe shit trying to end that fucking 86 year drought. I have more red sox shit then. I don't think I'll ever have to buy any more. I mean if they win the championship, I'm guessing. I'm definitely gonna buy a hat. I L I like getting the world series patch, but that, that that's about it. Maybe a shot glass. Your shot Mike yet. But as far as jerseys, dude, I got d I still in mind the back of my closet. I have Derek Lowe tee shirt, Manny, Manny, Ramirez Jersey. No Ma fucking jersey.

Speaker 3:          00:02:59       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:02:59       Somebody

Speaker 3:          00:03:00       got me a jersey. That was like the old school red sox won. It just said Papi on the front of it. Like I'm ever going to fucking wear that, but I can't throw it out, you know. So the last thing I fucking need to do is go into a store and get more of that shit that, that is going to become sentimental and then I can't throw it out. So, uh, I went by there again today to see if they had the world series patches and they don't, I guess they get them tomorrow. Some shit, I don't fucking know. So anyways, congratulations to the Boston red sox. I can actually name a few now. Go around the infield a little bit. Was In Middlebrooks over to drove over to Petrolia and I don't know who plays first base. Is it Napoli or was he out of left field?

Speaker 1:          00:03:44       I don't fucking know. Salting, Yamaka. And then there's those two Asian guys who would just fucking killing him.

Speaker 1:          00:03:52       I can't remember the guy's name. It begins with a u and he's fucking lights out. But [inaudible] it's so sad that I haven't watched this year and I have to sit here like a housewife who's been doing, doing needlepoint all year and acting like I get it. I don't get it. I don't know what's going on. I've been here in Boston the last five days and uh, I'm actually reading the sports page in this hell fucking nuts and spices like Dan Shaughnessy, like three days in a row wrote a positive, a article. It's incredible. But whatever. Let's just get down to brass tacks. You the red sox won the world series. Unbelievable fucking series. We had to win game six. I just said we, I know I did. I'm a fucking hypocrite. They had to win game six because they would, there's no way there'll be in Berlin to twice, so thank God they did. And thank God that guy hit that Grand Slam and he punched himself from the checks just right. Like that chick was sins. Sings the, uh, the titanic song, right? Oh wait, that's Whitney Houston. Well, what was the titanic song?

Speaker 3:          00:04:52       Ugh.

Speaker 1:          00:04:53       I was just a song that made you hate women. You know, you have a do that. You just really, I don't know if women, if you ever do, did you, is there a song that comes on that just makes you hate guys?

Speaker 3:          00:05:09       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:05:10       Eh, a bunch of fucking meathead had guys, bunch of peanuts around the peanut shells around their feet, sitting there screaming and yelling, right? Standing over there in the corner with his shit. Stain draws, drinking beers like it. This has to be a fucking song like that for me. The male version. It was whatever that titanic song was and that stupid mere cat that sang the fucking thing and she'd punch yourself in her little hollow chest. Oh God, the fuck was her name. And then she dated and she'd married that landscaped fucking coke dealer slash maybe did some porn at some point in his life directed at anyways, that Boogie nights looking guy had one of those really fucking, uh, a feminist French names like Renee or Susan or some shit,

Speaker 4:          00:06:03       right?

Speaker 1:          00:06:07       Jackie, whatever the fuck his name was. Jesus am I a mood? Listen to me trashing that, that fucking, uh, the female George Saint Pierre of Canada right there. Basically on the same level. One can choke you out. The other one, uh, chokes you up. There you go. Look at that. That was poetry right there. I'm summing up Canada. Everybody know Gigi. Um, anyways, I found a sick Gab la when I was here in Boston. I got to lay off that shit, dude. I swear to God, I look phenomenal for my age, but if I live another week, the way I've been living the last six weeks, all right, I'm going to catch up to it. What Ron Howard looks like and I'm going to go right by him,

Speaker 1:          00:06:56       you know, and that's no disrespect to Ron. Okay. That guy's like in his sixties, isn't he? Or is he in his fifties? I don't fucking know. Whatever. This is the Monday morning podcast. Everybody, the Boston Red Sox are in the world series against the St Louis Shit, birds and a red bird. Sorry. Why? Why would you start with them? They're very nice fence. Very nice fans out there in the home of Anheuser Busch. Um, and I got to tell you something right now. I cannot name one person on their team. He says the most baseball I've watched since I stopped watching in 2010. I don't know anybody on that fucking team who's pitching for, he had John Today. Who Do you got over there? Huh? Did that guy who finally shaved his fucking head? No. Wait, you traded him to, uh, the angels and then from what I've overheard, he's been shitting the bed out there. What the fuck is his name?

Speaker 1:          00:07:50       I Dunno. I don't fucking know. But you know, I'm going to watch, you know what's the hardest thing about trying to fucking watch the red sox and get all caught up is they all look alike. What? Those fucking beards? There's like three of them. They look, they're the exact same length and color beard. And then there's the backup catcher or whatever, but he's got the gray in it. I don't, I don't fucking know. I don't pretend to know. All right, but if you think I'm not going to be standing there on the child's, is the duck boats go by like I've been there all fucking year. You're sadly mistaken. Yes you are. All right, let's get out. Let's get out of the hole. A sports thing. This is a story than tricked me. Did you guys, did you such a hate that fucking word? I saw it and I was intrigued.

Speaker 1:          00:08:38       You know, like the whole world should be rejoicing that you're fucking fascinated. Just say sparked your interest, you were intrigued. Uh, what a self serve and fucking word that is. That's a deal breaker right there. If you're ever on a date and somebody uses that word on a first date, unless you're a fucking Douche and you want an, you know, maybe cancel out your douchey penis, you know, like two negatives, make a positive and maybe a baby will come out and be a good shit. I'm telling you right now, steer clear of anybody ever uses the word intrigued, you know, as if they're artsy. Fucking glasses didn't give themselves away to begin with. The second that word comes out of their mouth, you know, and if you can't do the math on that, I can't fucking help. Um, here's a story that just piqued my interest. If you guys seen this shit about the Greenpeace 30, basically 28 Greenpeace guys, ladies, whenever the fuck you call them greenpeacers and two journalists for some stupid fucking reason, they decide. They just decide,

Speaker 5:          00:09:49       okay,

Speaker 1:          00:09:49       out of the fucking blue to go over, up into the Arctic circle. All right. And basic. What the F I gotta I gotta say this right. Basically what they did, they tried to board, okay. More than a month ago after Russian coast guards seized 28 Greenpeace activist and two journals, journalists in the Arctic waters following their attempt to board a Russian oil rig. These guys got, these guys had a meeting. These 28 people had a fucking meeting and they were like, all right, here's the plan to help save the environment. Or at the very least try to slow down the changing of the environment because there's always going to be an environment, you know, taking one from George Carlin there. They'll will always be in an environment which just changing. So they don't like the direction that some of the other human beings, the effects they have. And I want to say decide that they can, I don't know, try and stop these guys from drilling in this area that Greenpeace feels they shouldn't be drilling it. So this sitting there in the war room drawing up these plans. All right. And I'm just picturing myself in this fucking meeting cause I, I don't have a problem with Greenpeace. It out. Looks like a very thrilling job. Sit this zig zag and in front of a fucking whaling ship, wind in your hair. You know people from other lands shaking their fist at you. That sounds like a hell of a fight. It sounds way better than tying yourself to a tree going, come on, man.

Speaker 1:          00:11:29       You know, it just seems like, you know, it's a good time.

Speaker 1:          00:11:35       So if I ever a green peace, I could see myself getting sucked into a position where I'm in that meeting. All right, so now you're in the fucking meeting. Somebody up there who God knows who man or a woman is up. They're gone. All right, so we're going to go up to the Arctic circle right there. I'm like, all right, that's going to be fucking cold. What is it? It's October the fucking planet starting to tilt away from the sun up there. I don't know about this. Are we going up there on an ice breaker? Um, that's my first concern. Yeah, yeah, yeah, blah, blah, blah. And now we're going to go fuck with the Russians. Whoa. Right there. I'm looking around the room. Then you just say, [inaudible] am I going to fuck with the, my whole life was a childhood. Those were the guys you didn't want to fuck with.

Speaker 1:          00:12:17       You know what? Fuck the Russians. You know? This isn't like you're going to go over there and you're going to go mess with the, I dunno, fictional buddy. The Estonians. Who the fuck knows anything about Estonia? I don't stone here. What are they doing over there? They eat people. They don't eat people off. Fuck it. Let's go over this. Go mess with him. The second you say Russians, I'm like, wait a minute. What is this? And then they get to the fucking point. Yeah. Then we're going to pull up to the oil rig. We're going to shoot some ropes up it like we're in an action movie and we're going to start climbing up the side of it and we're going to board their oil rig right there. I'm out. I'm not fucking doing that shit. You outta your mind. We're going to get shot. So many is going to take a fucking meat cleaver, right as we get up to the top. I'm going to pour hot water. A fucking oil on us.

Speaker 5:          00:13:14       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:13:15       So anyways, these fucking jerk offs get on this goddamn boat and then two journalists go with them to cover it and they fucking nature they take go out there and what exactly what you would have thought. What happened happened plus fucking like Russian navy seal looking guys with these fucking awesome guns pointed at these, these people, they arrested all of them. They took their boat and the two journalists, the Greenpeace guys are saying that the fucking boat was in international waters. Gives a fuck. You're at the top of the planet. There's no straight sex. Yeah. What are you looking at? You a little fucking watch. Oh, we're on this longitude, this latitude. Nobody gives a fuck. You just tried to board our oil rig. All bets are off. So anyways, they all got arrested in, they're being charged with piracy and they're beside themselves. They're just saying, yeah, the Russians just don't seem to understand. And it's like, no, no, no, no. You don't understand. You fucking morons. You don't, you don't do shit like that.

Speaker 5:          00:14:20       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:14:21       Find my neighbor was planting some ugly bushes and his yard and I wanted to protest. I wouldn't try to fucking repel into his living room. And then when they, they arrest me for fucking breaking and entering, I wouldn't be all what? Playing the victim being like, dude, what the fuck? What are you talking about that was protesting your, your shrubs. You just don't seem to see it to app to see, I have the same sense of humor about this that I do. So, uh,

Speaker 5:          00:14:48       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:14:49       Yeah. So I, I dunno, like everybody's feeling like

Speaker 2:          00:14:52       talking about this. Like they're the victims.

Speaker 6:          00:14:54       It says the organizer, the organizer, the organization's UK executive director has worked every weekend since the incident in the Pecora. See, while Lee, I hope I said that right, the [inaudible], the [inaudible] to see while leading efforts to secure their release, but it's still finding it difficult to sleep. He's in a constant rush or interview, blah, blah, blah. I said Russia, he said Russia is sending out a clear signals saying hands off are part of the Arctic and hands off complaining about our right to drill for oil there. I think the same, something a little more than that. Don't fucking show up to an oil rig. Like, like you got Tom Cruise on the boat. You get to do some mission impossible shit. This is the real world. Jesus Christ. You guys know how dumb I am, right?

Speaker 2:          00:15:43       I know not to go out on a fucking boat. Hey, try and board a Russian oil rig.

Speaker 6:          00:15:52       You know, we'd just be like that guy and platoon the whole time. I got a bad feeling about this man sweet going out there listening to the Mamas and the Papas, some hippy shit. All right.

Speaker 2:          00:16:07       The leaves are Brown. Ah, the sky is gray

Speaker 6:          00:16:15       and these fucking guys started screaming at you in Russian.

Speaker 3:          00:16:19       Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:16:19       Do the guns. They had pointed at him with a shit. I got to tell you that right now. I think that was the, uh, the game over, I think it was called the game over 9,000. That's what the fuck they were pointing at him. So, uh,

Speaker 6:          00:16:31       you know, what are you going to do? There's a lot of dumb ways to go to prison, but a, that I got to say that's that. That's right up there.

Speaker 2:          00:16:39       How awful is it to get arrested for piracy? And you didn't even fucking take the time to dress up like one. Yeah.

Speaker 6:          00:16:46       You know,

Speaker 2:          00:16:48       the only saving grace I'd be looking at, the only way I'm going on this mission is if I get that fucking hamburglar striped shirt. Put a patch over my eye and some sorta cutlass and my fucking mouth. Is that a knife? Is that a gun? I don't fucking know. What do you, what he called it? One of those, one of those. It's not a sword to fat or it's like a meat cleaver that got an erection. Stick that right in your fucking mouth. It's very phallic. And then you climb up to Saigon. Ire, ire. If I can. Hey Chef, really any arctic Mekhi um,

Speaker 6:          00:17:17       but instead you fucking climbing up the side. One, two, three.

Speaker 2:          00:17:23       We don't want you Julian for oil. Okay. All right. Easy guys. Hands up everybody. Jesus heard they're serious. Um, all right,

Speaker 6:          00:17:31       let's get to some advertising here for this week. The Greenpeace 30 everybody. Let's try to keep up on that one. Can you believe it? Who would have thought? Who would have thought you couldn't fucking just pull up to an oil rig, all the fucking ocean, dude, you couldn't do that to Exxon.

Speaker 1:          00:17:50       The very least someones gonna pee on you as you're climbing up the side. Somebody far enough from the ocean. So you might even take his shit. I don't think cell phone cameras work out there because of the Bermuda triangle. Dollar Shave Club. Everybody. Oh yeah. I talk about this every damn week. Um, there's so many things in the world that irritate me. Hippies boarding a Russian oil rig and getting charged for piracy and then sitting there staring at their Bergen stock, shaking their head going, I don't understand. Do you like how much I'm stereotyping them that they're like this. I'm sure they're hippies. Two Point Oh whatever. What else bothers me? Um, the red sox beards. I can't tell one from the other that's been bugging me. And um, I went to my, my, the way I've been living my life lately, very unhealthy. That's been bugging me.

I didn't know how it was going to sell tickets, so you always go to the major cities and um, I've just gotten a bunch of people saying, calling me a cunt, telling me to come to Manchester and you know, that's all I need to hear. That's all I need to hear. A little bit of interest, a little bit of insults. And I'm like, I like these guys. I'm going to go fucking head up there. Um, now I'm, now forgive me for being stupid, but Manchester is that where man United is from? It's gotta be right.

Speaker 1:          00:25:08       That's crazy. To me, you would think that the, the most successful a premier league team would be in London. Does that make sense? Rather than being in the worster of, uh, of England, I'm really, I'm really fucking on two levels stepping on a landmine here. I'm talking sports when I don't even know what the fuck I'm talking about and I'm shitting on cities and I have no idea.

Speaker 3:          00:25:33       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:25:34       Yeah. Jesus Manchester, is that one of those train spotting towns where I'm gonna go there and get fucking headbutted and have my ear bit off. I really don't want to deal with that. That's why I feel safe in London. I just feel like it's a bunch of people skipping around drinking tea and a, I'm not going to get beat down. You know, that's not on my agenda.

Speaker 1:          00:25:52       Taken up soccer hooligan, fucking beat down. I'll tell you, a long time ago, I read that book among the thugs and uh, I'm sure it was exaggerated or even worse. Maybe it wasn't. Maybe they toned it down, but uh, yeah, that was enough for me. That was enough for me. All right. Anyways, I'm just fucking with you guys. I will, I'll definitely, um, you know, the more cities I can have one ad when I go over there and the more shit I can see, the more people I can reach. Each time I go over to, to, uh, Europe, I'm just going to keep adding countries and cities and that type of thing. That's the game plan and a, I'm sticking to it. Oh, by the way, you guys all talked me out of going to Naples. Jesus Christ. I might as well set. I was going to fucking Dayton, Ohio. I've never heard a city get trashed. Trashed. Fucking voice is cracking here the way Naples did. Okay. Enough, enough said. Enough said. I got it. I got it. So I think I'm going to stay in Rome and then Kinda, I think Florence got some good reviews. Venice got some good reviews and having really should do is look at dirty water. I got to go somewhere.

Speaker 1:          00:27:05       Hey, does anybody know a good book on Mussolini? Can recommend a good one. I've just read so much shit about that guy. He reminds me of Paul Versey, you know, they both have a shaved head. They both think they see things and they both predict shit and they prepare for victory and then they lose. Um, and it's it Benito Versie, Paul Mussolini. I told you that day when he fucking Ivy, he was either invading someplace in northern Africa or he was going in Greece and Hitler told them, don't do that shit. All right.

Speaker 5:          00:27:41       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:27:42       And, and mousseline he's like, yeah, I don't why we got this. It's all good. He goes out and he buys a white horse to ride through town, getting ready for the victory party and then they lost it. He's got that big dumb horse. He's got nothing to do. What are you toe? He's already though. It's going to be a bloodbath. I got it. So I want to read more about this guy. Um, he sounds like quite the character. Speaking of characters,

Speaker 1:          00:28:14       um, there's a fucking hilarious, hilarious video. Only because it's all, it seems like they're just everybody's drunk and lethargic. Uh, the name of the video is jet Fan Punches, female patriots fan in the face after their victory. Congratulations to the green country, by the way. Um, that is your Superbowl and you know it is, you're not winning it again this year. You guys realize you're coming up on your 50th anniversary of not winning a super bowl, like the, your golden anniversary. You know, and they, and they said it wouldn't last. Congratulations when you guys don't win it this year. This is me just pissed because you guys won. Um, no. You guys jumping around like you did something yesterday. Ah, you wait, you wait til we come back healthy. You fucks. Um, and that was an excuse. And you know what? When you're losing the number one fucking defensive player on all levels, Vince Wilfork fucking Mayo and a key to leap. I gotta tell you, Geno Smith, dude, that fucking guy, he bet again, a nickname. You Dumb New Yorkers after you've fucking said San Shies.

Speaker 1:          00:29:23       Can you give one to Jane? Oh, you know what? Don't don't jinx the guy because that guy looks like he's the real deal. Man, I really liked that guy as a quarterback, Matt and I don't give a fuck man patriots on winning shit this year anyways. You know, I don't mean that in a bad way, but I'm a realist. Okay. I'm still enjoying the season fucking cons. Um, anyway, so it's at the end of the game. And so the name of the video is like basically mail, jet fan punches, female Patriot's fan in face. What it really should have said was mail jet Fan Punches, female patriots fan in the face after female Patriot's fan was punching him in the face for some reason. You know, because you're not supposed to hit a woman in the face. Whenever they show these videos, they GE the cutout, that part of the video or they show it and the people on TV never commentate on the fact that the woman was punching this guy in the face. Dude, you gotta see this jets fan. It's fucking hilarious. He's so shit faced and like lethargic. That's the thing, because everything is just sorta like in slowly

Speaker 6:          00:30:26       motion round house. And uh, he takes a lot of punishment, buddy. He never, uh, he never loses focus. I call them the big unflappable. If you watch them, you know, Tim Duncan is the big fundamental, this drunk jet fan was, was the big unflappable. And I gotta tell you that female pats fan, she took that punch like a chip pop right back up. Um, I don't know what was going on, but that jet fan, I don't know if he did something. It starts right there at the beginning of the video does something and then it looks like two ladies and some fat guy in a blue shirt. I'll kind of swinging on him and he's just like in slow motion like girl put a but button, just punching people in the face. And uh, I dunno, he obviously shouldn't have done it and deserves to be punished. But uh, this is something I think that I've asked before of a female fans on this. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:31:21       Gas, if I have any. Um, how do you feel about that? Obviously you should never punch a woman in the face, but no. You know what? Fuck this. Let me ask a better question. Any women listen to this podcast? Have you ever just gotten mad at a guy in a bar and just started punching him in the face and when you're doing that are punching him in the head. When you're doing that, is there any fear that the guy's going to hit you back? Are you literally thinking like, well, you can't eat, I'm a lady, you can't hit me, I'm in the safety zone. Or are you just simply so mad you lost your shit and you just throwing punches? Because, um, like I said, I don't think that that jet fan should had done what he did, what he should've done. What a gentleman does when a woman is punching him in the face is you go with, you go with the front kick at like 30% speed.

Speaker 1:          00:32:16       You go with the front kick, 30% power. That's what you do. It's so, it's not quite a kick. It's sort of just pushing her off. You, you know, you just sorta, you just kind of give one of those, keeps her at bay leg is longer than the arm, you know, but then there's that thing where you got to do it fast enough because the second you do it, you know, some guys are going to come in and totally, because you actually made physical contact with this human being that does not have a penis, has a vagina yet is throwing punches at you. It's really, it's a really weird dynamic. But, uh, I gotta tell you the big unflappable. He did all right. He's got it. He's got to wear a jets jersey. He's got something. You guys got to pull some money together after you bail them out and you got to get him a jets Jersey and on the back he got to have the big unflappable. Um, I dunno some he's probably going to get mad at. There is no excuse whatsoever. I'm not saying there is

Speaker 3:          00:33:17       okay,

Speaker 1:          00:33:18       but I just, I dunno. I find that, that that dynamic is interesting. Um, I dunno, I heard a great guy fucking bomb the other day just walking down the street. Just the way he was begging was great. He had some sort of musical background and you went, you walked by him, he had his great voice and you just go, James, James, j, j j change. I can't even do it the way it did. It put a smile on your face. He just went right down the scale. I didn't have any money. I only had fucking ATM money, you know, so you got like a couple of twenties in your pocket and he's like, all right, I want to help you but do it. I'm not trying to help him, you know?

Speaker 3:          00:34:01       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:34:01       Trying to get you a sandwich. I'm not trying to fucking buy you, you know? I don't know. What can you get with 20 minutes at 20 bucks is a bit much.

Speaker 3:          00:34:08       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:34:09       Have you ever given a homeless guy like, uh, like five bucks or 10 bucks and they react the same way as if he gave him a quarter and you kind of get mad kind of adjacent Alexander moment where you wanted to get credit for. Then you also think like, well, you know, if I don't have a house or an apartment,

Speaker 3:          00:34:27       okay,

Speaker 1:          00:34:27       you know, getting $5 really is not a major step in that direction. It's just,

Speaker 3:          00:34:34       okay,

Speaker 1:          00:34:34       maybe I can get the egg and Swiss, you know, the ham and egg, I can get a ham, egg and cheese as opposed to an egg and cheese. And then I'm going to eat that and then in 90 minutes I'm going to be fucking hungry again. So I kind of get it, but it's also kind of annoying. Jj, JJ, Jj, Jj, Jj, Jj, um, so anyways, world series starts tomorrow night. If you want to jump on my bandwagon, I have the Shiny as bandwagon, the newest and Shiny as bandwagon and town. Um, oh dude, I got no fucking arguing with someone. Rarely bill bought a surprise. Don't come at me with that attitude. All right. I've got this big argument with somebody the other day. They were telling me all about Los Angeles.

Speaker 3:          00:35:18       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:35:18       Talking about a fake tits and all that type of thing was making,

Speaker 3:          00:35:24       you know,

Speaker 1:          00:35:25       and nose jobs and you know, I went out to la we, but he's still plastic and fake out their paper. The just like a year fucking more run.

Speaker 3:          00:35:35       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:35:35       Yeah. And everybody back here, just the truth, right?

Speaker 2:          00:35:38       Is that what you're telling me? Fucking blows my mind. It just really does. And that's just like, you know what kills me as I've lived out there for six years and I'm like, look, I know when you first get there, I know what you do. You go down fucking sunset strip, you go down Hollywood boulevard. Yeah. And that's what you see. Okay. You're telling me when you go to the fucking meatpacking district in New York City, it's not a bunch of plastic, phony fucking Paris Hilton types or whoever the fuck the new one is of that ilk. Yeah. You go to the fucking club scene with the beautiful people. It's always going to be a bunch of phony people. But I got to tell you, I don't think the plastic surgery is that bad in la. And I know all you guys were like, oh, like, and what do you even react to it too?

Speaker 3:          00:36:24       Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:36:25       Have you fucking bet this guy. I lived out there for fucking six years and I'm telling him go through it. It's really not like that. There's a lot of really talented good people out there. So, yeah. Yeah. What the fuck do I know? I just live out there. You've been out there six days. I've been up there six years. What the fuck would I know? Please? By all means. You tell me about what you know, I'm somehow missing. I have got to be honest with you. If you really want to see plastic surgery, that's out of control. Um,

Speaker 3:          00:36:52       okay.

Speaker 2:          00:36:52       These are my top three places. And then there's, uh, my, my wildcard pick, I would say Orange County, California, Dallas, Texas, and um,

Speaker 3:          00:37:05       okay.

Speaker 2:          00:37:05       Miami Beach, Florida. Unbelievable. And then my, my, my wildcard.

Speaker 3:          00:37:12       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:37:12       The impossible dream. What might be a, I would say Phoenix, Arizona. But the fake tits. Um, but even then I think fake tits are out, you know, like roller blades, they were there like a 90 thing. At the very least. They don't have them like a, you remember those ones they had in the nineties. Oh Jesus Christ. Those fucking Clint Eastwood Vein on the side of, yeah. Women fortunately stopped doing that.

Speaker 3:          00:37:44       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:37:45       There's never been a pair of fake boobs that looks better than the real thing. Then whatever the, the original real boobs just look way better, regardless of size, way better. You know what I mean? I Dunno. I guess when you have a shirt on,

Speaker 2:          00:38:01       nobody can tell, but I don't, I don't know the fuck. That's just weird. That's fucking insane. To take a plastic bag of chemicals and stick that in. Yeah. Rather than keeping your beautiful normal ones. I'm pro boobs than me talking nicely about boobs here in October. Oh, by the way, uh, I called it with the pink scam. It's finally fucking coming out. You guys see in all these articles, this is all that pink shit, all that ways where need to up kitchen, stove. How can you make of it? Everybody coming down on me. You think I'm the bad guy. I'm wearing the black hat and fucking October, I got a link for you guys to check out that I, I swear to God, a hundred people have tweeted to me, so it's not my fine, I'm not going to take credit for it, but this is how it works with that pink shit. It's basically whatever they sell. So let's say they sell a pink Football Jersey, Nfl Jersey, you buy a Tony Romo Pinky, right? Commie Pinko fucking Jersey, right? Basically like 10% of the wholesale, not the retail price on the Jersey. Now what you pay the 8,000 bucks, whatever the fuck it is, the wholesale, which is probably, we'll say 35 bucks maybe. What does it cost them after the kidneys? The sweatshop makes the fucking thing. I don't know, we'll just say 35 bucks. So 10% of that.

Speaker 5:          00:39:27       Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:39:27       So if it's a $100 Jersey retail for you, 10% of the wholesale, 35 bucks, that's like they donate $3 and 50 cents and then they pocket the other $96 and 50 cents and then it goes over to the Commie Pinkos there. Right. They take that $3 and 50 cents now they have their entire infrastructure.

Speaker 5:          00:39:51       Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:39:51       On all the people that are making money, trying to ways that raise awareness. Like that's their job. That's how they pay their rent. That's how they get themselves a yacht. That $3 and 50 cents has to be thrown into the stockpile to pay all those people for their pink cubicles in this pink staplers and all of that shit. And by the end of it, I don't know what you have left.

Speaker 2:          00:40:15       So there you go. There you go. It's just one big C is shit. I Dunno. I Dunno what the fuck. I don't, I really don't mind. It's one of the dumbest things I've ever seen in my life. I think people are aware of it and I just find it to be this weird thing where you have to be that aware of it. Like it's more important than, it's like they're jockeying for positions in like, you know, this disease march madness, you know, they're running up the score so they can get the number one seat so they can play a 16 rather than being like a five, you know, and playing a 12. I don't know. I didn't do a fucking math on that. Um, all right, let's get into the, um, let's get into the fucking wall. Let us the letters for the week. I need a man's advice. Well, what the fuck are you emailing me for a long time fan? Recent subscriber to the podcast? I had no idea. I'm sorry. Well, I never promoted.

Speaker 5:          00:41:19       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:41:19       You know, so why would you know about my fucking podcast? Isn't there like nine zillion things on the, you don't give yourself a break. This is a zillion things on the Internet is free porn on the Internet. The very fact that you even listen to two seconds of this is, is an unbelievable comment. Compliment.

Speaker 1:          00:41:34       Um, anyways, he said, uh, I'm recent subscriber but I've obsessively caught up and listen to like five months of Monday morning podcast, um, breaking bad date nights, Chappelle show all you stand up. So he recent my hometown of Minneapolis. I'm not a huge football fan. What are we getting to hear? All right, well thank you for, oh, there was an arrow. Sit start here. Thank you for all those compliments, sir. All right. And he says, hope you can see the Arrow down. He Moy. Gee, I love emojis also tipsy for courage to write this. I don't know what the fuck that means. He spelling Shinra. Anyway, she said, I've been manifesting manifesting failings for one of my best guy friends of 15 years. Now I'm 30 years old and it seems like a no

Speaker 1:          00:42:25       brainer. Oh, this guy's drunk. Braining or this woman's drunk, whoever the fuck this is 30 years old and it seems like a no braining that as friends we make the go at seeing if it could be more. I don't, Jesus, let me see if I can fucking get through this. This is like an English person or something. Who's drunk? Um, I feel like what's holding me back are I'm not 100% physically attracted to him. I'm worried if it doesn't be, if I'm worried, if it doesn't work out, I risk the chance of losing a great friend after a night of hanging out and drinking. I texted him. So why have we never messed around in our adult life? To which she responded? Great question. I'm not sure Jesus. To which I said your what? Your epilepsy.

Speaker 3:          00:43:18       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:43:19       E l. L. I. P. S. I. S that's not epilepsy. Ellipsis indicates that admission of words. You know, people, you know, I'm fucking dumb. Don't use this. What the fuck is that?

Speaker 1:          00:43:37       Ellipsis? What did I got to look this up? Ellipsis. You know, a lot of people will laugh at it, but a lot of people also want to hear the definition. Ellipsis is a series of dots that usually indicate an intentional admission of words, sentence or a whole section. Jesus Christ. Okay. All right. My world. That's dot dot, dot. I thought that said epilepsy. You know what it is. I start reading a word and when I can't, I don't know what it is. I panic like Mayor Menino and I just throw out a fucking word. Great question. He said, I'm not sure. Dot Dot. Dot. To which point? I said you're ellipsis indicates and a mission of words. Dot Dot, dot. All right. You know what? Right there. I'm not fucking you. I'm assuming this is a woman at this point. Um,

Speaker 3:          00:44:28       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:44:29       Yeah. Anybody who uses the word, you're not even that the use the word ellipsis. I can, I should own up to my own stupidity or El Ep. Epilepsies um, indicates an admission of words right there. You're already putting him on the defensive.

Speaker 1:          00:44:46       You know, you're already fucking like mine. Fucking him. Anyways, he said hoping to get them to make the text move. He hasn't. Oh, you thought that if you wrote, I'm just gonna keep saying. Dot Dot, dot. Cause I'm, I'm paranoid. Everybody's laughing because I'm saying it wrong. your.dot, dot indicates an emission of words.dot, dot. She says, hoping to get him to make the next move. Dot Dot. Dot. He hasn't, so is it on me to make the next move? Is, is the risk of running the relationship ruining the relationship? Not Worth it? Is it even worthy of your podcast? Ah, what do I do if the person says, I feel like we're good, regardless of if you read this or not. This is where I say thanks and go fuck yourself. All right. Um,

Speaker 7:          00:45:34       well look,

Speaker 1:          00:45:35       if you're actually seriously want to, uh, explore a relationship with somebody, it's probably not a good idea to start the relationship after a night of drinking with texting.

Speaker 5:          00:45:49       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:45:50       I would think, I think that's a, that's a sober move. Now if you just want to fuck the dude, then yeah. Drunk texting is great, but I would leave out the big words in Casey's a dummy like me.

Speaker 7:          00:46:02       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:46:05       I Dunno. What is the next move? Well, if you want to pursue it, I would bring up the text said, sorry. You know, I was a little drunk when I texted you, but, uh, I was, you know, you know what? Don't do this. This whole thing is set up wrong. You just wrote, why have we never messed around in our adult life? He didn't say, how come you've never taken me to a movie? Um, you, you've basically the relationship you're setting up here as a fuck buddy. So if that's what you want, I would say full steam ahead.

Speaker 7:          00:46:39       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:46:41       If that isn't what you want, I don't know how to finesse around the drunk texts that you sent. So why have we never messed around in our adult life? Great question. I'm not sure you're ellipsis saying that right. Indicates in admission of words.

Speaker 5:          00:47:00       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:47:00       Who the fuck would ever text at this? The guy's already drunk.

Speaker 5:          00:47:05       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:47:05       He probably looks at what? He's probably fucking held the phone up to his drunk roommate. What does that say?

Speaker 7:          00:47:12       Huh?

Speaker 1:          00:47:13       Why is she talking about epilepsy? I don't know what to tell you ma'am. Um, but if you want to hook up with them, it's, it's there. It's there. Come on. You're a female. Jesus Christ. How hard can it be you putting it out there like that? You're all, as far as there being a love connection. I don't, I don't, I don't see it that I would do something different. Golf, fucking take a cooking class together. You've got to do some up taking you seriously, um, type of stuff. I don't know. You're not that physically attracted to the guy it drunk texting him.

Speaker 1:          00:47:51       You know what you need to, what you need some halftime adjustments. That's what I would do. All right. You're better than this. You, you can't, you can't go hook up with a guy that you were attracted to. Don't settle for less sweetheart. All right. You need to sober up like me. You need to get out of the fog. I'm doing it this week. You do it to go hang out with some different people. Go find a good looking chap that you're attracted to and uh, you know, go fucking half a cup of tea with them or some shit. Whatever you do. I'm guessing you're from somewhere else because, uh, just the way you are, some of the expressions beyond that word. I couldn't read that I've never heard. Oh, Jesus Christ. I don't know. Anyways, that gave me a headache. All right. Advice dealing with racist family.

Speaker 5:          00:48:37       Okay,

Speaker 1:          00:48:38       Bill. I'm a big fan and they need advice about a problem with you may have experienced, uh, my girlfriend is a different race than me and my family is reacting in a racist way about it. I didn't have that problem. Thank God. The problem is I am very close to my family. I usually talk, well of course you are. I usually talk to my parents once a day, so this means I have to deal with their crap on a daily basis. Um, I love your grandmother comes to town bit and that's similar to the kind of bullshit that I'm dealing with on a daily basis. Uh, here's the backstory. My family is Jewish but not religious. My parents are from Russia and our old school white as far as they can see it, as far as they see it, racism is just the way it is. And there is no shame in telling it like it is by making ignorant statements. Statements. My folks told me exact words that they want my girlfriend to be Jewish.

Speaker 5:          00:49:33       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:49:33       But they, what my folks told me exact words that they want my girlfriends to be Jewish, but that they would settle for someone white. Did you leave something out there, sir? That doesn't make sense to me. So my girlfriend is less Lebanese. Slash. Mexican.

Speaker 5:          00:49:55       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:49:55       Oh wait, wait a second. Wait a second. Wait a second. Oh, your family is Jewish. All right, now I get it. Sorry. So fucking dumb this week. Um,

Speaker 5:          00:50:04       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:50:04       My folks told me that they want my girlfriend to be Jewish, but they would settle for someone white. My girlfriend is Lebanese. Slash. Mexican. Ever since I mentioned to her, to my parents, they've been making all kinds of racist comments about her. Um, they hate us or why can't you date normal people of Jesus and there will be problems you'll see. So I'm stuck. I can't dump my girlfriend because I love her. And two, we have a great relationship in three. Dumping her just because of racist bullshit would make me a hypocrite, but I can't cut off my parents because I loved them too. And they have otherwise been wonderful and supportive. All my life. I've tried explaining to my girlfriend is not a problem and that she won't change my relationship with them, but my folks keep repeating the same racist bullshit. Any advice for dealing with my folks would be greatly appreciated. Thanks. And looking forward to seeing you the next time you're in New York City. All right? Well Dude, you got to live your life. You got to do what's right for you. And um,

Speaker 1:          00:51:05       you know, hopefully your parents will come around, but here's the deal, dude. You're gonna outlive your parents, so they're going to be long gone. And if you do everything that they want you to do, then when they, when they're gone and you're living the life they wanted you to live rather than the life that you wanted to live. Now if they what they want you to do and what you want to do overlap, then fucking by all means full steam ahead. But if you really love this girl, then I would, I would stay with that.

Speaker 7:          00:51:34       All right?

Speaker 1:          00:51:37       You know, what are you, what are you going to do the fuck you gonna do? Fuck people you know, fuck. Would they think a bunch of fucking mouth breathe and morons? Why would you even listen to me? I'm a mugging me. I'm a moron, but I'm not a moron when it comes to that shift. Fuck people live. Live your life and let them, uh, let them deal with it. Math. Jesus. Fucking relationships are hard enough. You don't need that shit. Tell your parents to grow up. All right, girlfriend, sleeping over. All right. Hey Bill on 26 and my girlfriend of about three months has been staying at my house four to six nights a week. Jesus Christ. This started about the second week we were dating when I asked her to stay over, I only meant for that night. I gave it time to get used to it.

Speaker 1:          00:52:23       Get used to someone being my bed. It's killing me. She lives with her dad and I understand why she would rather stay with me. She only has a toothbrush in my house, so it's not like we moved in together, but I have never lived with a girlfriend before. I feel like the relationship moved too fast. The worst part is I have to get up for work at about 6:00 AM and feel like I have to tip toe around so I don't wake her and get dressed and I have to get dressed in the dark. I'm also tired in the, uh, in the day from lack of sleep. I've dropped subtle hints when she hasn't spent the night. Like I slept so good last night. That's fucking hilarious.

Speaker 7:          00:52:59       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:52:59       I also started to be loud in the morning and turning on a lamp. I think she got the hint, but nothing has changed. I asked my roommates it and his girlfriend for advice, but it seemed kind of blunt. My roommate's girlfriend is in college, so his girlfriend is only there on the weekends and he misses her not being there. So he thinks I'm being a bitch. Uh, I don't want to break up with her. Just find a nice way of saying, go the fuck or I'll

Speaker 2:          00:53:26       see you tomorrow. Thanks for the advice. By the way, does everyone say go fuck yourself at the end or do you add that Ah, yeah, no. People say, go fuck yourself. Um, yeah. This is the deal, ya, your sound like you're a younger person and yeah, that's one of the hardest things you have to learn is how to say what you're saying. I will say what you're feeling knowing that the other person doesn't want to hear it, but you say it in a healthy way. So I would just say, um,

Speaker 5:          00:53:52       okay.

Speaker 2:          00:53:52       Yeah. Jesus Christ. Just say, listen, we've got to talk about something. And she'll say, what? And it's just like, uh, listen, I love when you're over here. I love spending time with you, but four to six nights a week it's affecting my sleep and you know, my job and that type of thing. So, uh, I'd like to have it be more than like two nights a week. It just kind of moved a little too fast for me. And then she like, what do you say? What are you saying? Blah, blah, blah, blah. And you just stay. No, I'm not saying that. I'm not say I don't like you. I'm just saying it moved too quickly and this is on me. Um, I didn't, I didn't want to hurt your feelings and I didn't know how to convey it. I know I'm 26, but you know, this is an area in my life that I need to work on. So I'm trying to get better at this. I'm just trying to communicate with you what would make me happy so we can be happy.

Speaker 5:          00:54:46       Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:54:47       And then you know, if she wants to pout and be like, wait, if you think lamean the Eh, and just want to be over here and then you know, what the fuck are you gonna do? You've only seen him for three months. If she's going to act like a fucking baby, then a letter.

Speaker 7:          00:54:59       But um,

Speaker 2:          00:55:01       you mentioned that she lives with her dad and you understand why she would rather stay with me. So is that guy a dick? So if that guy is a dick, then like she's like a stray cat and you gave her some milk and now she's at your door every fucking day. That doesn't mean she likes you. That's, that's not a hell, that's not a fucking healthy reason for it to be over there four to six times a week. She's over there four to six times a week because she loves you. That's one thing. But she's over there four to six times a week because a dad's a fucking asshole.

Speaker 7:          00:55:28       MMM.

Speaker 2:          00:55:30       Then she's just kind of being codependent. So, but that's a whole other can of worms and I don't bring up that part. Do not bring up her dad, by the way, on any fucking level. When you tell her, just say, listen, this moved really quickly and um, all the bullshit that I just said, just say it that way. And if she's going to cry then like Hootie and the blowfish set a long time ago, let her cry. All right. Just let her fucking cry.

Speaker 5:          00:56:01       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:56:01       And you know, that's what they do when they get upset, they cry. So it doesn't mean you're a bad guy. Just understand that she's crying because you conveyed what's going to make you happy. Can you imagine if you did that? If the shoe was on the other foot and she was just saying, you watch an ESPN,

Speaker 6:          00:56:25       he watched sports center like three times in a row. It's the exact same show. Can't you just watch it once? How many times do you have to look at these highlights? What do you think she would do if your bottom lip started quivering and you started crying and then tried to put the entire relationship on that one little thing, you know? Do you think she'd have any fucking guilt? I don't think she would. So neither. Should you grant watching ESPN three times in a row and actually saying, hey, could you not stay over here as much as you know, they're not on the same level, but you know what I'm saying? So good luck to you, sir. Just write down on a piece of paper. That's what I used to do because I wasn't good at it. I just wrote it down on a piece of paper, everything that I wanted to say and I would draw a smiley face above it. So I would remember not to say it in an angry fucking way. I know that sounds stupid, but it worked for me, so good luck to you sir. All right.

Speaker 5:          00:57:17       Yeah.

Speaker 6:          00:57:17       Two guys in a lady, two guys and a girl. All right. A their brother, man. Bill love you show. My wife loves you. Stand up. Ever since I showed her let it go, I've got a situation on my hands here that I would love to hear your input. I had a falling out with one of my closest friends about six years ago. It was all because of a girl that he said he was, that he said was his first love and apparently lost virginity with the girl and I hit it off. And so we started going out. We didn't want to hurt his feelings since we were all best friends. But after he found out he wanted nothing to do with us. Uh, which is understandable.

Speaker 6:          00:57:59       Is nothing worse than somebody banging. Somebody used to be in love with, right? And then they come to you in a mature way. It's the last thing you want. You want it to sneak around so you could be like, how dare you? I thought you were friends when they actually cut. Listen, this is just something that we wanted to talk to talk to you about because we value our friendship with you this same way. We value the feeling that we bought in. They're just being mature, so you have to fucking sit there and not call them cunt. That's the worst. All right. Plowing ahead. As the relationship grew, she told me that she never was intimate with him and that he didn't even know, wait, as the relationship grows, she told me that she was never intimate with him and that he didn't even know he liked her that way. Oh, and that she didn't. He left that out there that she didn't even know that he liked her that way. Fast forward to present day, I'm married to the same girl and have two dogs and in the process of buying our first home together, out of the blue, out of the fucking blue, my friend contacts me via Facebook and keeps asking me

Speaker 6:          00:59:02       to go out with him. When I say that, my wife wants to tag along too.

Speaker 5:          00:59:09       Okay.

Speaker 6:          00:59:10       He keeps repeating the phrase. We got to talk man, man demand before we can start a new, I just got all fucking turned around in there. What the fuck just happened? All right. The wife loves it. Your relationship group, dude, you fucked up a pronoun in there and that just threw me right over the cliff. Has the relationship grew? She told me she never wanted to be, she was never intimate with them. Now wait a minute. This guy said he lost his virginity tour.

Speaker 2:          00:59:39       Jesus Christ. It's like a soap opera.

Speaker 5:          00:59:42       Okay,

Speaker 6:          00:59:42       so you married the girl. He got two dogs and in the process of buying for is out of the blue. My friend contacted me via Facebook and keeps asking me to go out with them off to have a drink. All right. When I say that, that my wife wants to tag along too, we keeps repeating the phrase we gotta talk man to man before we start a new, should I go?

Speaker 5:          01:00:01       Okay?

Speaker 6:          01:00:02       MMM.

Speaker 2:          01:00:06       Uh, no.

Speaker 5:          01:00:09       Okay.

Speaker 2:          01:00:10       No, no you shouldn't.

Speaker 6:          01:00:14       You shouldn't because cause he's a fucking Weirdo. He sounds like he still has a lock of her hair someplace.

Speaker 2:          01:00:23       Got To start, man to man, they'll give me a fee still fucking that's why the f wait, wait a second. Why does he want to hang out with you? He could walk away that easily. How good of friends were you?

Speaker 5:          01:00:35       Okay.

Speaker 2:          01:00:35       You know, if you guys just watch games together cause you work together, you went to school for a couple of years together. I mean, I think it's a fucking rap. Sounds like you've got a great thing with your wife. Why do you want to bring this guy over and then what? Then what he wants to see what she looks like. That's weird, dude. That sets single white female shit. I wouldn't, should you go? No, I wouldn't go fuck him.

Speaker 5:          01:00:59       Yeah.

How about those Bruins? Going down to Florida, showing those two teams down there, how the game's played. Three way relationships are built, sir, a billion of orange. Thanks for the podcast, man. I'll try to keep this short. So my girlfriend and I are 25 and invent together for about four years. Things aren't great, but they aren't horrible either. Recently we started hanging out more with her best friend and everyone, whenever we hang out, it's always a great time. Her friend has been in a bit of a relationship, dry spell lately and recently my girlfriend told me that they've been discussing the possibility of us starting a threeway relationship. All right.

Speaker 1:          01:04:37       Okay. I don't need to read any more dough it they'll always says my girlfriend and I have already gone down this road before with minimal complications, but that was primarily a sex only relationship. Whereas this new one would probably be more serious. Well, you fucking Jack tripper. How would it be more serious? You're going to live with the two of them.

Speaker 1:          01:05:01       Oh, that was a three's company reference for anybody under the age of 50. Um, the problem is I'd really like to date the friend. I think that we could make this trio work, but I could see myself liking the friend more than my current girlfriend and fucking the whole thing up for everyone. I also think that breaking up with my girlfriend at the four years just to date of best friend is a cut move and therefore is off the table. Finally, this fucking Shit, the fucking question. Sorry. So should I encourage this three way as it's the only way I'll ever get to date the friend, which seems quite cunty or should I just break up with the girlfriend? Forget about the whole thing and move west to start fresh.

Speaker 5:          01:05:41       Okay,

Speaker 1:          01:05:41       thanks again. And Go fuck yourself. Pleat. Ps, come do a Gig in Maine before you get

Speaker 5:          01:06:03       okay

Speaker 1:          01:06:03       situation to have your cell phone. You know what I say? I say you fuck them both then you her and then you fucking, you move west and start a fresh, that's what you do. And that's not a dirty move. Okay. Because what's your girlfriend is doing all right? She's into women. She's in the bolt, but you're not going to marry this woman. All right? This girl, she's, she's rogue. She's a renegade. She's going to get a pilot's license to fly around. The fucking world is Amelia Earhart. Man, you don't tie this woman down.

I've performed there one other time, but I was there with Jim Norton, Jim Brewer and David Tell on the antisocial network tour. It was awesome. And I was really hoping when I came out there they'd have that electric blue carpet for some reason I feel like Eddie had the blue carpet. Um,

Speaker 1:          01:09:56       but I think it was just a stage and it was, it was awesome. So to actually, I thought I'd never get to go there again.
