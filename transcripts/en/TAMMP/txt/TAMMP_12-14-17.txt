Speaker 1:          00:00:02       Hey, what's going on is bill burns time for the Thursday afternoon. Just before Friday. Monday morning podcast and yeah, just checking in on you. You liked up. That was my imitation of a car with no balls going from first gear to second gear.

Speaker 2:          00:00:21       Ah,

Speaker 1:          00:00:24       well actually would start in first. So that's, it's sec. My impression of a car with no balls going from second to third gear. That's what it is. Sorry, I just wanted you to know every fucking person out there listening to this. I'll right. We get the joke bill. God, speaking of jokes, I'm going to be at the hard rock cafe tonight in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. Huh? Jesus Christ. How many sexual harassments can happen just on the fucking beaches out here? Good Lord. I mean, is that story ever going to end every time you think they got the last guy? I mean that, that down to like fucking, they're going to have to cook snow.

Speaker 3:          00:01:05       How was making bacon and all of a sudden I felt these heads and I was like, wait, is that squid still alive?

Speaker 1:          00:01:14       Turned around and all I saw was orange and freckles. Oh Christ. Meanwhile, we're spending $1 billion a month. I finally just, I dunno, we're spending $1 billion a month fighting people that train on a fucking jungle gym. I just, I, it's like, it's like throwing $1 billion. If you have a beehive on the side of your fucking house, you got to get rid of the bees. Absolutely. You're going to beat those bees, but you're not gonna have any fucking money.

Speaker 1:          00:01:47       Sorry. Anyways, plowing ahead here. Um, by the way, I am in a week to week two of 'em my Invisalign and I just keep these fuckers in cause I want this to be over as soon as possible. Actually really like him. I'm kind of used to it and now my bite is totally fucking off. I don't know what the fuck's going on with me, but I'm, I'm, I'm riding this out, but I only take these things out to eat. You know, I've already lost the little case. You know that you're supposed to carry him in. They give you a blue one that's blue and the one that's red, the blue one you supposed to take out in public, the other one's red and that means stop leave it at home.

Speaker 4:          00:02:28       Okay.

Speaker 3:          00:02:28       So you know me, you don't know me. You think you know me, but you know a lot of what you think you know about me is right. So I've already fucking lost, uh, my, uh, my container here, but I got this container of icebreakers mints and I noticed that their gum container is the exact same fucking shape as the other containers. So I just figured rather than going to, you know, fuck, I lost my container.org, Oregon,

Speaker 1:          00:02:56       you know, ordering another one. Um, I'll just use the icebreaker mid thinking. That's probably stupid. Then I'll think it's governmental. Shake it and I won't hear any gum in there and I'll throw it out. Oh, well we'll see. You know, I think Alannis Morissette said it best when she said you have man, you learn. Um

Speaker 4:          00:03:18       Huh.

Speaker 1:          00:03:19       Jesus Christ. What an album that was. Huh? My God. Good Lord. You know, looking back now, looking back at that album, it's just like a, I think you, you need to go take like an MMA class.

Speaker 4:          00:03:31       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:03:32       And if you actually learned how to beat the shit out of somebody who wouldn't be so fucking emotional, you could just be like a guy, you know, sitting there all fucking stoic at the end of the bar, stewing in your anger, listening to James Brown, the big payback. Fantasizing about what the fuck you want to do. You could do that. Well, you can be like, you know, freaking people out with the Goddamn Ukulele sitting there going, hey, hey, hey, hey, wait, let us he's, he found somebody else. He's not coming back. All right. Just, you going to have to accept this. What the fuck happened on my computer screen?

Speaker 1:          00:04:16       Yeah, that's, that's, that's computed for go fuck is, oh, it's back. Look, goes back, back again. Um, anyways, a couple of announcements. Uh, Patrice O'Neal benefit. February 20th makes a great Christmas gift. Come on people, you getting down to the fucking why it's December 14th, man. Hanukkah is already three days in. I got to give it, I got to give it up to fucking mainstream people for putting up really going all out with the minorities. This year I was down the Improv. They had a GI at fucking Christmas tree in this little fucking piece of Shit Menorah. You know what I mean? It was fucking nuts.

Speaker 1:          00:05:01       As little piece of shit just sitting on the fucking piano. But there was two days late. That was last night, right. With two nights ago, we were in the fourth day. On the fourth day of Hanukkah, my Jewish friend gave to me a piece of Shit Menorah from the Improv. Um, four days. Then I came to the hard rock cafe. They've got a couple of lights fucking lit up there. I had no idea. It took the red eye in, uh, flew in on a fucking virgin airlines, which by the way, I don't feel comfortable flying that fucking airline cause I think they put more money into their fucking seatbelt song video then they did on the actual plane. Cause every time I get on that fucking plane, you know me, I'm a fancy guy. I spent 20 years in the back of the fucking plane. I ain't going back. Okay? What I have to pay, okay. I want to be breathing down the pilot's neck. That's how I fly commercial.

Speaker 1:          00:05:55       I want to know when one of them gets up to go the bathroom. That's where the fuck I want to fly. All right? That's my one diva demand in this business. I fly up front. That's it. Um, I'm not, I spent 20 years back then. I'm not fucking going back there. You know, I might, you know, you never know what happens in your career, but if I end up back there, I swear to God I'm packing like a rock star when they go on tour for fucking two years where they bring one pair of pants, two tee shirts and a toothbrush. That's the way I'm packing. I'm going to start dressing all in black. Like George Carlin had Johnny Cash. I've already worked it out. If I fucking go back there, okay, if I have to go to the back of the plane again, I'm going Vegan, I'm doing yoga. I'm to become this skinny as I possibly fucking can. And then I'm bringing this little fucking nap sack with me because that's all the back of the plane is. It's just stress. Fuck. How fat is the fat fuck sitting next to me going to be, fuck, is it going to be fucking head space? Let me, sorry. Overhead compartment space for my little fucking bag.

Speaker 1:          00:07:06       That's all it is. The whole fucking thing is that fuck is the person next to me going to be snoring. Fuck. Am I going to sit next to the bathroom? Fuck, I'm in the back of the plane. After awhile I got sick of it after a while. Freckles got sick of it and I just said, fuck this. How much is it? I don't give a shit.

Speaker 1:          00:07:27       Throw it on the fucking card. So anyway, so I said, I'm sitting up front. All right. And uh, he never threw flew virgin airlines. If they have this fucking music video that they did, which I get doing the announcements, you know, there are emergency exits are here. This is fucking there. Don't do this. Don't try to open any windows. While the plane's in flight, you know, whatever the fuck they say, don't try to let your shoes on fire. So they were like, this is boring. Where the hip airline, we have all this aquarium lighting here. You know, let's, we liked the plane. Like everyone's going to get a hand job right after they fucking take golf. Right. How long before they get shit for their sexual harassment. Fucking lighting. Yeah. Everyone should smell like Cologne. That's the way it's fucking lit on those planes. And uh, so they, they, they will make decide they decided out of the bucket blue to make this music video.

Speaker 4:          00:08:26       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:08:27       To like give you the announcements and when I tell you this fucking, it feels like it's 15 fucking minutes long. Yeah. It's so fucking like loud. And then everybody's doing that, you know, Post Christina Aguilera singing.

Speaker 4:          00:08:43       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:08:44       You know where you got to hit every note on the fucking scale. Every three words like Christina Aguilera singing, row, row, row, your

Speaker 1:          00:08:53       doing that fucking Jesus. Like you tickle and a cat and it's not enjoying it. I'm not saying she's a bad singer, but it's like I get it. Jesus Christ, Jesus Christ. So they have all of that fucking uh, you know those fucking women that when they sing, they got a point where their voices go in. Like it's like I get, I'm tone deaf, but you know, I don't need you to be doing like a fucking, you know, leaving breadcrumbs of where the fuck you going on the music scale. Okay. I could tell by the way my eardrums are vibrating. You're getting up into the stratosphere there.

Speaker 5:          00:09:31       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:09:32       So this fucking song goes on forever and ever. And just when you think it's over it, then they do this stupid robot part. I don't even know what they're saying.

Speaker 6:          00:09:39       My grandpa painted bed, bed, bed, bed, bed, Eh, Eh,

Speaker 1:          00:09:47       oh my God. Oh my God, I'm going to light my shoes on, fire up. This fucking thing doesn't end. So, and then what happens is I try to put my headphones on, right? And then you just say, excuse me. See here, nine 11, support the troops. Could you take your fucking headphones off? Fortunately, last night they didn't make me do that cause I took the red eye in and the uh, the stewardesses were were cool. Whatever the fuck you supposed to call them, flight attendees. Um, they were cool and they didn't make me take the fucking things off, but she's as fuck. And then meanwhile they stay, spend like fucking $1 million on this goddamn thing. Um, I'm all these fucking Waylon divas and robot people in all of this shit. And they then they take talks up in the boring announcements that only took like 45 seconds. Now it's like a 10 minute God damn video.

Speaker 5:          00:10:40       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:10:42       And they spent all that fucking money on that and I have never been on virgin, flown up front and after I reclined the seat, had the seat go a back up again. The fucking stewardess always has flight attendees always has to come over and fucking windy to fly. Any 10 year over year always has to come and open that middle part and there's some sort of secret fucking lever to pull it up. So then that makes me think, okay, if this is what's going on with the seats, like what's going on with the engine? Um, all right. I was catastrophizing. All right, but that's something you do when you're on a plane.

Speaker 5:          00:11:15       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:11:15       You know, cause like when we were taken off, it was vibrating a little bit too much. I was just thinking like, you know, it's lax. It's like, ah, fuck. What if we crash into the ocean right now? And even worse, what if we have a really good pilot? Like sully who doesn't have the decency to just fucking knows it in and kill us all instantly. Now we've got to float. They're waiting for sharks. The fucking Itas cause it's nighttime. You know what I mean? During the day. I want selly. Alright. At night, you know, I don't know what I want. I want just, just knows it forward. All right. Uh, we don't get enough fucking thrust to get lift here. Speak for myself. I had a good one. Yeah, just go straight down in. Um,

Speaker 7:          00:11:56       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:11:56       But anyways, uh, Jesus Christ, I went to go buy a fucking magazine before I got on the flight. My God, everything was so fucking depressing. Do you know the cover of Newsweek? They got a picture of the earth, like waterless saying that's what like the future is going to be and it's just like, who in the fuck would buy that? And I'm going to say I'm going to sit there and read that and then do what? Think about my [inaudible], my daughter over there in, in some waterless world.

Speaker 7:          00:12:30       I Dunno. I think, uh,

Speaker 1:          00:12:33       you know, I mean I just don't understand that, how that helps me. And I also don't think that that's the direction we're going to go in as much as everybody's flapping their arms and screaming, yelling and all of that shit. There is some good news out there about all of this type of stuff, you know? Cause you know why I know this. You know, I know this because I'm getting sick of all this fucking negative news and all, you know the fucking iPhone now they want you to fingerprint, which I'm not sure doing so coincidentally enough, all of a sudden my phone, you know, cause I didn't finish air quotes, setting it up by giving a fucking cell phone company.

Speaker 7:          00:13:10       Okay,

Speaker 1:          00:13:10       whoever the fuck it is. Um, my fingerprint, it's like, why would I give you my, why would I give you my fingerprint? You fucking assholes. First of all, I love, oh apple keeps acting like this. This epidemic of people getting their phone's broken into. Like if you set it down, somebody's going to figure out your 46 digit code. Like they're fucking Christopher Walken in the dead zone. All they gotta do is touch, shake your fucking hand, and you're like, it's one, two, three, four. Right? You're like, fuck, he can get into my phone. I've never had my phone broken into because somebody knew my fucking pass code. I'm sure somebody has gone in another way, sitting in the fucking, you know their house. I don't know how the fuck they do it, but I know my thumbprint and showing my face or whatever the fuck it is, these assholes want from me. Um, oh fucking uh, Billy Apocalypto here. I think I'm, I'm, I'm, I dunno, I've made this claim before, but I think I'm going to do it. I might think I'm going to go, but I'm going to go flip phone, MP three player because the only reason why I really liked the smartphone is I loved it. All my music is on there. I really enjoy that. So if I was in the

Speaker 1:          00:14:36       cell phone fucking market, what I would do is I would make flip phones that could fucking carry the music, you know, flip phone slash MP three player and I'm throwing that out there right now so people can write me. Oh, actually there is a phone like that. It's called the MP three player. Flippy. Uh, it's made by sprint or whatever. The fuck it, I'm going to go, I think I'm going to do that. And then when I'm on the road, I'll just Skype on my computer. I guess I'll do that fucking shit. Um, speaking of which, by the way, I've gotten into like fucking, I downloaded this James Brown album a long time ago. That was a,

Speaker 1:          00:15:18       let me see if I can find it. Of course now I'm not going to be able to find the fucking thing, go into library type in his name. But anyways, it's at this point, even if you're a casual fan of James Brown, you know, they basically on the radio and in movies and all of this shit, all they do is they just, they, they play like the same fucking, you know, the same five fucking songs, 20 songs. You know, Dan Patrick got a brand new bay. They play that gut feel good. The same ones. You got to get his fucking albums where you can hear all the, all the beside once. Um, and I've been, you know, I bought this book, this Trump book the other day, which I'm just getting into it and it looks like it's going to be one of the best, uh, drunk books I've seen in a while called the breakbeat Bible.

Speaker 1:          00:16:15       And it kind of breaks down. Um, we're, although all the rappers and everybody, like all the songs that they sample all those drum brakes and then the kids would dance to them, which, why are they will call breakdancers all of that, all that shit that the white guy like me didn't know til I watched a couple of Netflix documentaries and I watched a drum cover of, I forget what the fuck I was watching. I think the funky drummer, like someone was showing me all the ghost notes and stuff and said that they, that they had a good breakdown of it. And this, this, this book, the breakbeat Bible, which I got. And then it came with the little fucking MP three CD. I'm like, what the fuck is that? How I do this? And now all of a sudden I'm getting a flip phone, an MP, three player. So anyways, um,

Speaker 1:          00:16:59       I would highly recommend checking out like some of all of his shit and like alternate takes and stuff. Uh, what the fuck is the name of it? Now, of course, they're not going to show me the name of the fucking thing are they? It's called make it funky. Uh, for God's sakes. I even like it shit in like the 70s when it's kind of over. Like everybody's moved on to like disco and shit and everybody's ripped him off and stuff and he's still fucking like ACDC. He's just doing what the fuck he does. All right, let me see. Yeah, make it funky. Dash the big payback. 1971 to 1975 a I get that album. I would download that shit. Yeah, listen to that man. It's fucking incredible. And um, oh man, I don't know. Anyway,

Speaker 3:          00:17:50       so I'm, I'm, I'm fucking, I'm already thinking of drums, drum songs. I want to fucking be able to play. Uh, speaking of which, I think I'm doing the goddamn comedy jam next month at the Roxy. I think it's January 22nd. Is that a Tuesday? Is that a Tuesday? Let's see here. Let's see here. It's a Monday. It's either the 22nd or the 23rd. Um, in the fucking Song Josh Adam Meyers wants to do, cause I want to do this fucking song and it's just like, it's like, dude, I want to go there and have a good time. I don't want my fucking arms to be fallen off. He wants to do this fucking iron maiden. So I'm one of those Clive burnt ones. We either your arms or your foot is going to fucking fall off. Like I'd love to do a cover of the prisoner, but that one, when he does those for bass drums in a fucking row, on a good day I can get that. But in front of a room full of people where I'll be in my head be like, oh my God, don't tighten up. I know it's just going to fuck it. I'm going to shit the bed. I'll pay like two and a half and then the whole band is going to look back at me and smiling like, yeah, yeah, just a comedian. Um, I don't want to go through that. You know, I want to live the lie. Like, I'm actually, I couldn't like light in myself that I could have done this professionally.

Speaker 3:          00:19:05       That's all you want. Audio. Hobby. Right.

Speaker 1:          00:19:08       Okay.

Speaker 3:          00:19:08       You don't give a fuck about getting compliments that your job, it's all about your fucking hobby.

Speaker 1:          00:19:14       Yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:19:14       Somebody's appreciating that you'd be a goddamn neurosurgeon. Oh my God. I can't believe the way you replace my brain. I just want to thank you. And the guy's not even thinking that he's not even fucking, you know what I mean? Not even hearing it. It's not even listening to you. Then somebody comes walking in and you're like, Hey doc, did you put this ship in this bottle? That's amazing. And the guys, same guys, just like my wife doesn't support me and says I'm bad at it.

Speaker 1:          00:19:41       Um, anyways, I fucked up people. I went to a Goddamn cvs and I bought the wrong fucking disposable fucking raises. I should've gone to dollar shave club and I didn't. I just, in a spur of the moment, I might get some cheap razors. I can need to shape my fucking head when I'm on the road and you can't my experience, you cannot have three blades when you shave your head because you're going to hack up the back of your head. You need the two blades. So now I got like three packs of these fucking thing. Thanks. And um, so next time I do a show in La, if I remember I'm bringing them, I'm just going to give them away to somebody in the crowd cause I'm not fucking fucking throw them out. Um, Jesus Christ too. I always getting patient in the end when I do the back of my head after you shave your head, then you got to go over it one more time to make sure he didn't miss anything.

Speaker 1:          00:20:32       I just, and that's the time I cut my head. Just go quick, quick, quick, quick, quick, quick, quick, quick. Ah Fuck. And then it's just like Jesus Christ.

Speaker 7:          00:29:44       Hmm?

Speaker 1:          00:29:45       Where do I go? Well, I swear to God, I'm so sorry I wore my Invisalign. I'm so sorry you had to listen to my teeth. Get a little straighter during this her thing. Um, you know what? I actually looked up positive news and I found this thing, the good news network, man. God Damn it. If they don't have good news, he lets you want it to say some positive news here. Let's end on a positive note. Good news in history, December 14th, on this day, 40 years ago, Saturday night fever premiered starring a young John Travolta. Is it champion dancer with all this date rape friends, there's something positive. I want to put my little negative spin and all of this, uh, burger king drive through worker goes firewall after it helping a diabetic woman. Well, what in the fuck did he give her on the menu or is that a her? I think that might be, or her. I think that's a, her um, guy shows you how to use Amazon prime to instantly help the homeless. Okay. There's some fucking advertising laden as a positive fucking story.

Speaker 4:          00:30:58       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:30:58       Needle free injections is, it's just all fucking commercials. That was a burger king commercial. This isn't positive. Oh. And a historic announcement. World Bank says it will no longer finance, oil and gas exploration. Okay. The bank is walking away from oil and gas exploration and they're going to give the oil companies the sun.

Speaker 7:          00:31:20       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:31:20       All right. The World Bank has just announced their groundbreaking decision to cease all investments in oil and gas exploration over the course of the next two years. This, this can't be true in two years, they're going to have no money to drill for oil. We're going to flip over to fucking solar that quickly. The announcement comes as a welcome followup to the, you know, it kind of helps if you're reading positive news and I'd have a negative cunt. Fucking, I like to think I'm more cynical. Um, see how, see how much sugar is in honey maple syrup and a Gavi nectar. Mazda announces gasoline engine using compression ignition.

Speaker 4:          00:32:02       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:32:02       Why your pet looks like you and vice versa. How to pack light for easy travel.

Speaker 1:          00:32:11       I don't know what I, I don't know where I am right now in the Internet, but, um, I kinda like it. This is the system kind of light news that I like. Why does my pet look like me? Speaking of which

Speaker 9:          00:32:23       Cleo,

Speaker 1:          00:32:25       who was in town this week, I got to take three days in a row. I got to take her on hikes and I gotta tell you, man, I still love that dog with all my heart. But I, I made the best decision of my life. Uh, she's now living with my trainer who has to skills. The dog has never been happier. She's never looked more relaxed. And for the first time in her life, she's actually friends with another dog. How amazing is that off leash, you know, going up, you know, smelling each other. You know, she's probably about a month and away from laying in the sun with another dog, just being happy as hell. And, um, I wish I had the skill set to get her there. God knows I didn't. Thank God I did what I did. And it's great that my trainer, whenever he comes back to Los Angeles, always brings her along and uh, it's fucking awesome. It's really awesome. I'm so happy for, although I still miss her. I still miss that dog. Um, anyways, but it had a happy ending. Just like good news network.org.

Speaker 5:          00:33:31       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:33:32       Okay. The announcement of the World Bank comes as a week. Welcome followup to the financial institution's decision to trop all investment in the coal industry back in 2010 now, after years of pressuring from environmentalist, the World Bank will draw up almost a billion dollars in annual loans from oil and gas groups. Well, this is just a World Bank. It's not every bank, so I'm sure chase and Wells Fargo will gladly take that business that they just dropped.

Speaker 5:          00:34:01       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:34:04       Related News. Alon must record breaking battery was just switched on in Australia. This'll be the tipping point. This'll when, when, you know, we're not going to have a fucking world without water and we're just not going to do it. Okay. I refuse to, I can't walk around with a kid thinking that that's going to happen. What's going to happen is basically, this is just a bad hundred 20 years or whatever, where we went in a direction we zigged when we should have zagged. Nobody's fucking wrong. All right. Quit pointing fucking fingers at different colored ties. Let's all get on the same fucking page. It's a great way to, I dunno, I went the fuck. Do I know what I'm going to, Goddamn scientist. My whole thing is let's stop fucking spending $1 billion a month to fight the fucking, uh, the, our gang from the little rascals over there.

Speaker 1:          00:34:52       You know, they're bankrupt in us. You get over here, you go fucking Sola, right? And then those people, first of all, you don't even need to bankrupt isis to second. We leave that. Just going to go back to killing each other. Just like when Russia, when Russia left fucking, when Russia collapsed and they're literally nineties. I'm really going on in Olympia. I really don't know much about world history, but when Russia left Eastern Europe right after they collapsed and all those people got their fucking freedom again. And everyone's like, oh, this is great. All these poor, oppressed people they meet. They picked up fights that I had never heard of because my entire, you know, that whole Bosnian Serbs, that whole fucking horrific thing that happened over there, I guess that shit was going on. And then Russia came in, they had a common enemy. They will fight in Russia for the whole time. And then the second they leave they started right back up with their Hatfield and McCoys Shit, you know? So, which is always good. A war is always good. That's another, it's a very pro environmental, I actually know cause the light fucking oil fields on fire and all of that shit. Uh, I dunno, whatever. There's some, something will happen, something will happen. We'll fix it up, you know? Or maybe not. Robots will come along and they'll kill enough. Enough of us,

Speaker 7:          00:36:07       you know,

Speaker 1:          00:36:09       is there any good news on this website about robots? You know what it's really going to take to turn this shit around. It's going to take people like Elon Musk not saying this guy's a fucking saint.

Speaker 7:          00:36:19       All right.

Speaker 1:          00:36:21       I'm just hoping he has a better product. They have to start bribing politicians the way oil companies and banks too. Right? That's where they have to do. They got to get the electric people have to get the politicians on the take. So when the OBAMAS and they're fucking, um, they're run as president when they go around and they give their speeches, you know, the big payback fucking tour, uh, they would actually go to these companies instead of the fucking oil companies and the big banks and all of that type of shit. That's all it is there a day. Did you hear what I just said? People I just solved the world's pollution problems or financial problems and our energy crisis all in one.

Speaker 7:          00:37:04       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:37:04       One minute string of sentences that was not even remotely released, uh, researched.

Speaker 7:          00:37:11       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:37:13       And that's what you should be coming here for. I'm going to make you feel better. I will. I'll give you good news, Dude. By the way, my condolences to Philadelphia Eagle fence.

Speaker 7:          00:37:26       All right.

Speaker 1:          00:37:28       I finally just watched that fucking eagles rams game, which was absolutely, it's just a great fucking game and all these fucking assholes. [inaudible] it felt no. You know what it is. You weren't really a fan. That's what it was. Okay. And what happened was too many of the fucking sex symbols, the quarterbacks went down this year. And I think that that's why the product is going down. All right, Aaron Rodgers, Andrew Luck. Now Carson Wentz is out. You really have to enjoy football to watch all their backups come in and play. And uh, what's great about when they go down and then you get to see like how good it had coached too. They have, can he design a game plan that can fucking deal with the fact like bill Belicheck did when we had a Freddy fingers there when fucking the fuck with that guys. Phil Mutchnik what? That was his name. Now he went to Kansas City and everybody was all excited, including Paul verse. He's saying the guy was a franchise quarterback and I was saying, dude, he was driving a fucking Lamborghini. He was driving a Lamborghini and fucking a new England. Now, now they just gave him a z 28 and it's going to look the same way. He's gonna. He's not gonna look the same.

Speaker 1:          00:38:42       The hell was the guy's name. I want to say his first name was Carson. Considering so many fucking people's name, quarterback named Carson, who? Carson Wentz out for the goddamn season. I'm going to, I'm going to retweet. Did you guys hear that Eagle's fan call the sports show and he started crying.

Speaker 10:         00:38:58       Just let go of your way.

Speaker 1:          00:39:04       There's no way bureau, if you're a Boston sports fan, you're like over the age of like 40, you know? Exactly. I remember I had a buddy of mine after the Aaron Boone home run called up and he was like in tears.

Speaker 10:         00:39:18       There's one year I didn't want to see with it. You too much. I mean, Jesus Christ.

Speaker 1:          00:39:25       Okay,

Speaker 10:         00:39:26       there you go. 26 championships,

Speaker 1:          00:39:28       right? Then all of a sudden it's always, it's always darkest before the Dawn, you know, and now look at us now, we're now, we're the fucking spoiled rich kids with all the goddamn championships. So, um,

Speaker 8:          00:39:43       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:39:43       I Dunno, I dunno what to tell you, but I swear to God, I'm really starting to believe that Philadelphia, Kansas City and San Diego, like they built their stadiums on some like ancient native American burial ground or something. I, there's no other way to explain it and it really comes to, it's not

Speaker 8:          00:40:06       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:40:07       Death they lose. It's still way that they lose. It reminds me of being like a red socks patriots and all a Bruins fan growing up. We had the Celtics, thank God, but it was just like all of those teams, they didn't have the decency to just suck. They had to get right there. And when everybody was watching and they then they had too many men on the ice, Bucky dent roughing the passer, you know, whatever the fuck. You know, our fucking bill Parcells announces to the team before the Superbowl. I'm not going to be back next year. I'm selling my house that fat to an cunt. Um, who by the way, never won shit without bill Belichick. Overrated under it. Overrated bill. Parcells Oh, Bill, you're going to get some shit on that one. I don't think he's fucking overrated. It just pissed me off that he had a fucking goddamn temper tantrum about that cause you know, because the owner overruled them and made them draft Terry Glenn, rest his soul who they then, then everywhere bill Parcells went after he fucking brought Terry Glen. But when he was in New England is a Gui. You want me to cook the meal? They go to buy the groceries. Yeah. Well from the looks of you eating everybody else's fucking meal. Um, anyways, plowing ahead here. Uh, and I didn't fro Cleveland in there and I won't throw Cleveland in there because I don't have

Speaker 1:          00:41:34       any sympathy for Cleveland sports fans the way I don't have. I'd never had sympathy for fucking cubs fans just because everybody gives a shit about you. They're always doing stories about how fucking sad you are. People give a fuck. You know what I mean? You like that little kid that fell down and his mother was right there to hug him and kiss him. That's what Cleveland fans are.

Speaker 4:          00:41:58       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:41:58       Nobody gives a fuck about Philly fan. Somebody gives a shit about what's going on in Kansas City. Nobody gives a fuck about everything that happened to the charger fans that weather's perfect. Fuck them. Nobody cares. And then the team left. Nobody cares. All right. I love the browns. I fucking, they fucked up their uniform. So, and uh, their quarterback has my, my favorite quarterback name in the league right now. The Sean Kaiser.

Speaker 4:          00:42:24       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:42:25       African American, yet possibly a Nazi. I mean, how do you beat that? How'd he beat the duality of that? Um, anyways, what am I do? I think that's the end of the podcast that I did. I talk about everything that I want to talk about. Oh, by the way, coming up, I can't believe this. This'll be my 10th rose bowl in a row. I'm in double digits. And if I keep going, that means at some point when I die, they're going to win. I beat that old guy that they announced, you know, and then

Speaker 11:         00:43:04       we went up 40 Shelburne road bowls in a row.

Speaker 1:          00:43:08       Um, I was actually thinking if I live to a hundred, I'll have gone to 60 in a row or 61.

Speaker 4:          00:43:17       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:43:17       Oh my God. How close to the fucking stadium will I have to park? We'll have to do you know, you, you're parked on a golf course still literally have to send a golf cart out to me. Um, and by the way, I am really fighting, not going off the wagon for one day that day. I keep going back and forth. Like I'll just go off one day, one day I'll get fucking hammered. And then I'm like, no, no, no, no, no. Cause I wanna go, I wanna go a whole calendar year. January, right through to December without booze. And that would put me at 501 days. And then next year's Rosebowl not this one. The next one I would come off the wagon. I Dunno what, I have no idea. I haven't, I haven't figured it out, but um,

Speaker 4:          00:44:07       yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:44:08       let's just put it this way. I'm getting weak.

Speaker 1:          00:44:14       Hey, you guys let me know some good MP, three players, if you don't mind. Oh by the way, Santa Steve Simone, Santa Steve, Steve's Simone and regulate hero are raising money again this year for children fighting cancer and their families. Monday morning podcasts. Listeners help raise 15 grand last year around last time around and it, I dunno if though they just fucked up the set. We raised 50 grand last year and had a huge impact on a lot of families. Their stories are brutal. We're going to spare you this stories and every little bit helps this goal. The goal this year is we're going to try to raise 50 grand a, I'm going to tweet the link today. Retweeted, I should say thank you for everybody who's been helping out. Um, all right. Is that it? Oh, I never talked about the Yankees Getting Giancarlo Stanton. All right. And I know what you guys are thinking.

Speaker 1:          00:45:03       I'm going to be frothing at the mouth and we talking about Derek Jeter, the front office. If the Patriots did some shit like this, they'd waterboard us. Fuck all that. All right. I still will always hate the Yankees, but like, I can't get mad at that fucking move. All right. They've, they're doing everything I wished the red sox were doing. They built from their own system. They have a young team that way over achieved. I mean even without gene Carlisle, I was like, these guys are going to get number 27 they got 26 to 26, 28 they're going to get number 28 within the next five years. That's what I saw this year. And now they added this guy and um, basically that whole fucking team is from their own system essentially. Especially all their great players. This guy became available and they went out and got him. Who gives a fuck? My, my team, the Red Sox, we've been buying up the league forever.

Speaker 1:          00:46:04       Like the Yankees were like that fucking person that your mother said don't hang out with him. He's a bad influence. And then we secretly hung out with them anyways and then we ended up doing what they were doing. Now we're hooked on the junk and they went into fucking rehab but which still strung out trying to fucking buy a championship and they're building one old school shit. And then they're adding a there and a free agent. I don't have a fucking problem with it. And plus the fact that it came from the Miami Marlins who their ownership, I don't know if it's the same one historically does this puts together a good team, then they win a world series and then they just dumped the whole fucking team constantly fucking over the fence. And I actually liked how I want us, Jean Carlos Stanton was about it. So, uh, and it's also, it's good when the Yankees are good. Um, so I don't, I don't have a problem with it. And, uh, I don't think there was some sort of collusion with, with Derek Jeter. I don't think there was that, you know, I don't think he's the main guy in there.

Speaker 5:          00:47:03       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:47:04       And knowing him, I bet he was concerned, like, this is going to make me look bad, which never happened in his entire fucking career. So he's probably thinking, I don't need to start now. I mean, this isn't like when Kevin Mchale sent Kevin Garnett to the Celtics. I mean, if I'm going to get mad at this. And what about the Celtics in 2008 so what are you going to do? That's how the fucking game was played up. Sick of being a grumpy old man. Congratulations to the Yankees and you knew fucking guy. But we now we gotta go buy somebody that can strike out. You know? You know what was funny though? Here's my buddy versus he was like, oh, the Yankees, he didn't see what they did. They never disappoint. This was the same guy flipping out when Katie went to the fucking Golden State Warriors. It's a great move by the Yankees.

Speaker 1:          00:47:48       It's not good for baseball to have a fucking MVP leaving Miami. That's their guy. He should've retired with them, but you have to blame the fucking ownership on that one. Um, it seemed like he wanted to stay. I read a great article where he was saying, listen, I don't want to rebuild. I want to move forward. Let's get some pitching. We got a great fucking team. And they were like, no, no. We're just going to make money off of people coming down to watch you hit home runs as you lose fucking a hundred out of 162 games. He was like, fuck that. I'm out of here. So a good for him. Um, all right. That's the fucking podcast. Uh, or freckles is, um, 119 days in and uh, he starting to get the shakes here. This is a deal. If I can just get past the rose bowl, I think, uh, look, I gotta go. I can't, six months is a good time to stop, right? I'm four months in, you know, I think I'm going to be, I'm going to be doing a college tour. We're trying to put this together in, um, in February,

Speaker 1:          00:48:58       you know, I was going to start possibly the dream is on this tour is to go to a Kansas Jayhawks basketball game and it Kentucky wildcat game start with Kansas. So start with Kentucky and then in Kansas or and in Kentucky, you know, book, end them with Games. And, uh, I was going to do an f is for family

Speaker 1:          00:49:20       college tour, you know, and hopefully get a bunch of free swag, you know, to fucking throw with the kids when I go there. You know what I mean? Um, that's the game plan. That's what that one working out. But if I did that then I'd be road dog in it. So we'd probably rent a bus and then that would be hard. Oh, that would be a hard one. So I don't know if there's always those. Thanks. There's always those times we shall see. Um, all right, that's the podcast. That Thursday afternoon podcasts. I was just checking in on you. Just see now you fucking weeks going a happy Hanukkah to everybody and a happy pre Christmas, merry Christmas. Whatever the fuck I'm supposed to say. Happy Kwanzaa. Happy Ozark Day.

I don't fucking know,

Speaker 2:          00:50:20       Eh.

Speaker 12:         00:50:28       Yeah. Well, as she is my one question, so much time

Speaker 3:          00:51:08       bully, I can beat up. All right. Well if there's a bully you can beat up. He's not really a bully. He's just an asshole. Right? Hey Billy boy, I'm a 15 year old lad from Australia and it's my problem. There was a complete Dick head at my school that always picks on me. But here's, here's the twist. I could smash the shit out of this prick. I'm 182 centimeters. That's six feet tall, fit 15 years old, six feet tall. He goes 74 kilograms. That's 160 pounds. Few people keeping score and every other day what are, and he's about five, eight and weighs about 185 pounds. All right, so he's got, he's got your bike, he's got, you buy 25 pounds, but you have the reach advantage. This is the tale of the tape here. I love this. You got a four inch reach advantage. Unless he has those fucking Kevin Mchale arms that are almost dragging on the ground. All right, you go. I lift weights every other day and he's just fat.

Speaker 4:          00:52:08       Okay.

Speaker 3:          00:52:09       All right. You're definitely the favorite so far. He goes, but this isn't the biggest reason why I could smash this. Can I have about 20 years of martial arts experience?

Speaker 4:          00:52:20       Okay.

Speaker 3:          00:52:21       Wait a minute. You're 15 years old. How do you have 20 years of experience?

Speaker 4:          00:52:27       Okay.

Speaker 3:          00:52:28       Oh, he's going to break it down. I have about 20 years of martial arts experience when you add it all up. I have seven years in karate, five years in movie tie. Oh, Jesus. Dude, you bring those fucking knees so that fat belly, Oh my God. Probably got shins like a fucking street pole. Um, Street Pole, stop sign, whatever the fuck I was trying to say. I pictured a telephone pole and a stop sign made out of metal fun. I came up with St Paul. Look at that. I'm inventing words here. Seven years of karate, five years of Muay Thai, five years a Brazilian Jujitsu, Jesus Christ, standing up, go to the ground. What do you want to dope? And three years of MMA, he constantly calls me name like gay boy and Poof. And he slaps me in the back of the head every day. Dude, you can't have that. Uh, this has been happening for like two months now and I haven't fought back because I'm worried about getting in trouble from teachers at martial arts classes. Any advice as welcome? Uh, thanks for whatever. Whatever helps you. Uh, whatever help you can give me.

Speaker 4:          00:53:34       Okay.

Speaker 3:          00:53:35       Go Fuck yourself and have a good day. All right, sir. Well, this is the deal. You could, or if you actually applied what, you know, you could seriously hurt this guy, but you do have to defend yourself. So is there a way that the next time he goes to slap you in the head, you can put them in one of those fucking, those holds? We're just holding the person's thumb and they're all of a sudden on their tiptoes going, all right. All right. All right. All right. All right. Is there a way to just shoot one across the bow? That's what I'm suggesting. I'm not saying that you fucked this kid up and then ruin your standing with uh, your, uh, your seafoods, your Sensei's, your, your, your pastors, whatever the fuck you call them down at the Dojo. Um,

Speaker 4:          00:54:18       okay.

Speaker 3:          00:54:18       Yeah, but there's no reason for you to go to school and get slapped in the back of the head and being called names. Okay? So what I would do is, uh, oh, what the fuck he asking me? This is what you do. Jesus Christ. Here's your solution. Talk to one of you, your karate masters there and just say, listen, this is the deal. I know after everything that you've taught me that I could wish what? Mop the floor with this fat tub of Shit, but I don't want to get in, you know, bad standing with you. What, what do I do here? Have them, have them tell you what to do and cause they'll, they could probably suggest they know the name of whatever that fucking had a choke out somebody's thumb. Whatever that thing is that you guys do that I wish I knew how to do. Um, but here's the deal. One way or the another. Uh, there has to be a solution with this guy slap and you this slapping you in the back of the fucking head. Um, do you do, do you know how to do a death grip yet? Have they taught you that? Is that an actual thing? Why don't you do a double death grip to his man tits and twist them before he has a chance to slap you in the head. Don't listen to anything that I'm going to suggest here. Uh, why don't you take some Twinkies?

Speaker 3:          00:55:38       What, what could you do with the twinkie and a martial art thing? Why don't you make some nunchuck Twinkies and it says on, instead of slapping them in the face with the, with a piece of wood, it's a, it's a twinkie and it goes across his face. He's humiliated. Plus, you know, he's a fatty, so he's going to have to lick it off his face and he'll get into that sugar rush and his eyes will roll in the back of his head. And by the time his eyes come back down, you're going to be across the room and he can't slap you in the head out of, there's gotta be something. There's gotta be something to do.

Speaker 4:          00:56:07       Okay.

Speaker 3:          00:56:08       I mean, at this point, if you don't want to go physical, I would just go verbal. Oh, I, you know, he's calling you gay boy and poof. I mean, why don't you just talk about his fat tits.

Speaker 4:          00:56:18       Okay.

Speaker 3:          00:56:18       Just Act. Just be jazz used to be really sincere. Just be like, just out of curiosity, how much do your tits way, you know, do you wear a sports bra or are you going to kind of go with the, uh, the giant pocket tee?

Speaker 13:         00:56:31       Yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:56:32       And the fact that you're already this fat and our young age, like how fat do you think you're going to be when you're 40? And these are just questions, sir. You know? And then when he charges you like a rhino, just step out of the way and he won't be able to slow down and maybe go flying into some desks. I don't know sir. But can you please tell me how this I, I w I would go, I would go to your, uh, your Dojo masters there, whatever, and I'd ask them what to do, but there's no fucking way on any level that you should have to tolerate that. Uh,

Speaker 13:         00:57:03       okay.

Speaker 3:          00:57:04       Yeah, I would do that. Ah, Jesus. Are they going to go even really more mature? Well, I think you should talk to your teachers about it and then you become the fucking guy ratted out. Yeah, I like that. It's a selection that's like this, uh, solutions they come up to on like the view. You just turn around and you just face, stop doing that. I, I, I'm not going to tolerate this. You know, I'll give you like a rape whistle or something. I don't fucking know. I don't know, sir. But please let me know how that works out because it's bothering me that, that dude is doing that to you. All right. I don't like bullies. Um, oh Jesus Christ. Do you know what I really want to tell you to do? And I'm not good.

Speaker 12:         00:58:00       Jeez.

Speaker 3:          00:58:21       I've been with my boyfriend for two years now. We're in college together and he's currently taking a semester abroad. Oh Jesus. Where in Brazil? Before he left, we had a running joke that I was going to need a vibrator when he left as a surprise party gift. He got me one. I have a couple of friends whose boyfriends bought them sex toys. So while I was a little surprised, he actually got me a vibrator. I also happen to know that it's a relatively normal, it's relatively normal for a boyfriend and do that. Yeah. That's basically like this era's chastity belt. You know, you're trying to lock down the pussy. That's disgusting. But that's what he's doing now anyway. Yeah. But it's done because those things, you use them too much. They numb up your area there and then the guy can't even remotely try and, you know,

Speaker 3:          00:59:12       do something for her and then you gotta be sitting there banging, banging them as their user. We're using the thing as you know, it's like you want an alien or fucking this girl has this. That's just all dick has no body. All right, whatever. Let's move on. What I'm basing it on based on my fucking life, I did live a little bit of a life before I met you. I realize that. All right. Any way, fast forward to about a week ago, we were on Skype. Uh, he asked you to take this thing out. Um, no, we don't have sex chats. Thank God. And he casually asked me how his gift for me was working out. I told them it was working out pretty well. He then mentioned that he had bought something for himself,

Speaker 7:          00:59:57       a flashlight.

Speaker 3:          01:00:01       Joe Rogan experience is brought to you by the fleshlight every week. He does every very weird, those are very gay. They look like that thing. Boba Fett I fell into when he died and one of those space movies. Okay. Wow. Um, I knew how to be faithful to her. That's nice. Okay. He said, she goes, I knew what this was because I am an avid listener of Joe Rogan's podcast. How you doing? Joe Robbins come up three times in this podcast who raves about it constantly. My boyfriend had never mentioned to me that he was interested in anything like that and I always thought the idea of it was totally creepy. I acted like it was totally cool, but in all honesty, I really don't want him to be

Speaker 7:          01:00:47       fucking a perfect fake wait,

Speaker 3:          01:00:51       I got lost in that. I actually was thinking, is Joe going to get mad that I'm saying that this is weird? Okay. I acted like it was totally cool, but in all honesty, I really don't want them to be fucking of perfect fake vagina whenever he wants to. I'm finding myself getting crazy jealous and angry whenever I think about it. I know, I know I'm jealous of an inanimate object, which seems insane. Let me finish. I'm really struggling with this because part of me wants to be completely okay with it since it's sort of a hypocrite. It's sort of hypocritical to get angry when he got me a vibrator. But now I'm starting to think that maybe he only bought me a Dildo so I wouldn't be able to complete when he got himself a proxy pussy, Pussy. So what do you think? Do I need to suck it up and get over this or is my jealousy legitimate? Thanks and go fuck yourself. Go fuck is fake pussy. As long as he's not faking a real buzzy, I mean fucking a real policy then you know it's all good. Plus you. It's not just like the the pussy that it's, that he's missing. He's also missing like, you know your touch and kissing and the whole other part of it too. And that fake pussy cat low. Am I there? No, he isn't. He's getting right to the dessert.

Speaker 3:          01:02:11       Don't be Japanese. Tried these Brussels sprouts. Don't need them. Don't be jealous. I bring over the trace Lecce when he comes back it will be even better because you both have been like doing it with anatomy and objects and so it's, I don't, you'll be rediscovering each other all over again. I'll be even better. I don't think. We don't even worry. I don't think it's a good thing. Why? Because, uh, once you start down a path sexually, you know, in order to get off that path, you don't just jump over onto another path. You've got to walk all the way back up the path you went down, get to the fork where you fucked up and then head down the other one. What I'm saying is he might get used to just doing that and the sensation of that is what gets him off. And then when her pussy doesn't feel like the fleshlight Hillary don't feel better, he'll, he'll build bang her and then, and then when he needs to finish, he'll be like, oh, hi. And now for me, hey can, can't take a day. What that fucking yeah,

Speaker 1:          01:03:11       no, no. She'll fall even better. If anything, he'll be like, oh my God, I forgot what a real woman feels like and he'll be done in like two minutes. That's what you hope. I don't think she should be jealous of it though. They're both, they're both doing the right thing. When you're in a relationship and you're that far apart from each other because he took, I bang all sorts of Harry European girls, no offense to Harry European girls, but I'm just saying, you know, listen,

Speaker 3:          01:03:37       I watched this thing one time or listen to it on the radio. Uh, one of those Colin's sex shows and this guy had a pull away. He jerked off. I see dry hump, the rug, it was causing like chafing on his deck and it, but it, it, it was the only way he could get off because he wasn't in a relationship for a while and he kept doing that. And I dunno. So I'm just saying like, I would go easy on those. It's like anything, anything in moderation. Yeah. How, how often is he using this and how often is she using that? If use a vibrate too much, you're numb yourself up down there. And then when you guys down there, I, Daddy,

Speaker 1:          01:04:11       I can't feel anything. That's so disgusting.

Speaker 12:         01:04:34       Jeez.

Speaker 13:         01:04:56       Six.
