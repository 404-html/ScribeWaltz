Speaker 1:          00:00:02       Hey, what's going on? It's bill burn. It's time for the Monday morning podcast for Monday, November 21st, 2060 what's going on? How, why, how's it going? Oh, I'm doing good man. I hope you guys would do all, it's a holiday weekend. Dooby dooby do in school to lead Bop. You only have to work three days unless you boss is a fucking cunt. There's always other ones too are if your fucking self employed or if you're not happy with your home life, you'll come up with a reason. Right. To go back into work just to fucking avoid it. Um, yeah. You know what this year, cause uh, you know, we can get in the fucking kitchen done. We don't have time to cook or anything. So we're actually going to a friend's house for Thanksgiving, which is, which is great because they live in the same city as us, so we don't have to go to the fucking airport right now. All these fucking people waddling around, you know, those people just oblivious of other, you know, it's a great fucking human being. Just totally being all about yourself. Oblivious moment is when fucking people, you know, there's a whole herd of people just riding down an escalator and people like this second, they step off it. They don't keep walking and get the fuck out of the way. They just, they're just all fucking oblivious. It's like, ugh. You would just on the escalator, there's 50 people in front of you. 100 people behind your touchdown.

Speaker 1:          00:01:32       Sorry, I got the game on. What a fucking throat. What the fuck is going on with the package this year, man, I don't fucking get it. Um, anyways, sorry about the screaming then. You know, you got 50 people in front of, you got a hundred fucking people behind you. You know, and people are getting off that kind of meander in and you're on the escalator thinking cow, go get out of the way before we all fall down on each other. Right. If for any sort of a thinking human being going like, oh, assessing the problem. Well when in fucking eight seconds when I become that person, I'm going to get the fuck out of the way. So whoever the fuck is 20 people behind me will not be having this panic moment because of me going to become part of part of the solution. Not The fucking problem.

Speaker 1:          00:02:18       Right. I don't even know what I'm talking about at this point. I can't remember the point I was trying to make, but what I know what I'm saying. Yeah. That the kind of fucking people like you know was the top. So thanksgiving. That's right. Right. So we're going to fucking pee. I have no idea why point is, you know what I mean? I just said a bunch of shit out. Hope it was funny cause God knows there was no point and I think that actually is the point of the Monday morning podcast for all you people out there who you know who tend to take it unbelievably seriously. Those of you out there who think that I influenced the fucking election isn't that hilarious. $7 billion was spent to get Trump and all these fucking people a chance to get elected. But you know that all goes out the window.

Speaker 1:          00:03:02       The second, some fuckhead who can't even read out loud, does a podcast all out the window. I'll tell you if that's true. I'm going to start, I'm going to start charging more for my fucking advertising. You know what I mean? Maybe I'll use that as a selling point in 2017. Uh, evidently I was, I was the reason Trump got into fucking office. Oh, Jesus. Hey, Trump's support. Is he liking what you're seeing so far? Uh, you like in these fucking, you know, you thought Trump was old looking at the fucking people. He's surrounded himself with Jesus Christ. If they're not an a Nazi fucking movie, they're like 450 fucking years old. Rudy Giuliani. This is like when some old hair metal band gets back together again thinking they're going to put out a fucking relevant album. You're not, it's over. You had your time. It's fucking done.

Speaker 1:          00:03:53       You know what I mean? These guys are going to get the fucking band back together and start singing about what, uh, girls in a strip club and the devil, maybe the PMRC or whatever the fuck people used to sing about back in the day. I don't pretend to know. Um, you know, we were fucked either way. All these fucking people, by the way, I gotta give a shout out to somebody. Um, what's her name from cosmopolitan magazines. Laura Beck calling out SNL for the horse. Shit that, that was, that was that opening completely agreed when they were singing. The woman who plays a Clinton, Hillary Clinton played ilet Luhya and it was kind of confusing. Like is, was this a true tribute to fucking, uh, Leonard Cohen Dying? Or what, what's this a political fucking statement? And uh, she kind of called them out. Go and did you guys have Trump as a fucking house while he was running for president?

Speaker 1:          00:04:49       And Al of a sudden, you know, you help promote the guide then. Yeah. I mean, shit, if I did by trashing both fucking people, right? She actually said it was bullshit. It was fucking hilarious. It's a great read. I'll give you guys a, uh, a link to it, but I mean it's a TV show. That's what they do. They did that to a buddy of mine. They did that to fucking Dane Cook. They had them fucking a hosted twice. He made him a bunch of fucking money with high ratings and then all of a sudden there's a little blip on the fucking Internet, you know, tide turns a little bit and then they use them as a fucking cheap joke when he wasn't even a, he wasn't even on the shelf. That's what they do over there. That's what they do in this business. Then at your fucking friends.

Speaker 1:          00:05:28       See, that's why you know what you do. You stay where I stay right in my little cave. You do a podcast by yourself and then no one can hurt you. Um, anyways, um, so I, uh, every time I do a standup special, you know, and ends up being a little bit too long, at least the last couple of ones. So you start thinking, what if you take this out here when, if you do a little fucking thing here and we have to do, and he ended up fucking, the whole thing of what you really have to

Speaker 2:          00:05:58       do is you, you just got it. You got to cut off a limb. You know, you've got to remove a kidney. Basically. You just got to take out a chunk. And I figured out what chunk it was going to be or I had an, an idea that that's what I wanted. And then the director Jay had the same idea. We took it out and it flows and it went from a too long of a special. Now it's like fucking perfect. And now we're going to, uh, and all I've seen at this point is just the raw feed of it. So it's not even like an HD and it looks way over lit. And then my fucking pasty God damn Whitehead, I look like an asshole and it still looks like a good special. So I'm very excited. I got that done. F is for family.

Speaker 2:          00:06:37       Second season, we're starting to fucking, you know, tighten these things down for the final fucking edit. And, um, and then next month I'm going to start, uh, the process of which should be a quick editor is editing the audio from what I did, Madison Square Garden a year ago for the New York comedy festival. Sorry, hiccups, New York comedy festival. I didn't almost get emotional, the New York comedy festival. Um, and then if once I get, I get all that shit done right then I'm just like done. I'm done. I can just enjoy the rest of the fucking year. I got nothing to do really. Right. And then, uh, then it starts all over again in January, you know, be nice if I did cardio for the rest of the week and just, you know, then I can fucking throw down. That's another good thing about going to somebody's place for the holidays. They got to clean up.

Speaker 2:          00:07:29       You know, you don't leave with a bunch of fucking food. It's going to be good. Um, I'm excited about when he wants me to make this fucking stuff. And I knew she wouldn't let me just go over there. It's like, why can't I just be the 12 pack guy? You know, that's the best guy you put on a sweater. Right? He go over there, you make people fucking laugh to show up with like a 12 or fucking whatever, whatever the fuck you want. You know, I try this IPA lately and I'm really not an IPA guy. I go in and out of that shit. I usually drink, just drink shit that's considered a white trash beer. And um, cause I just like getting fucked up. You know, I'm going to do the taste. I just want to get fucked up. Right. And I want you guys to say, well those IPA is, have a fucking high alcohol content.

Speaker 2:          00:08:10       I don't give a shit. They're fucking, they're heavy. Fucking heavy as hell. But I tried this one, it was called the Green Line and I got it. I don't even, because they only had a couple beers at this place, was this goofy fucking place and I just wanted a beer. And they were, that's one of the only ones they had. I actually really liked it and mind me living in Boston, fucking going up to fuck and Chestnut Hill and the gray line dote, Kenmore Square, go to the fucking sucks rich Fisk. Um, Gary Allen said, oh Jesus says a couple of red sox names from way back in the day. Anyways, um, I tried that shit. I actually really liked it and uh, I don't even want to did guys, I'm just fucking talking in circles cause I haven't been home. I haven't been to my house and like fucking two months and uh, I've had it, me and Nia had been living on top of each other and uh, you know, I don't know about her, but I'm, I'm pretty sick of us being this close to one another.

Speaker 2:          00:09:11       So hopefully Tuesday we get back in the fucking place. Oh, nice. Fucking throw Aaron Rogers over the top DB complain and say it, he fucking pushed off course. You're going to say that. That's what you say when a guy fucking what a tight end beach. You that deep as a fucking corner. How the hell does that happen? How do you let that happen? I asked you guys, he pushed him within five yards. I think that was all right. Um, anyways, how about those Bruins? Huh? He handled in Winnipeg. I was all nervous day that top two scorers in the league. What did we tell? We'd put fucking three of them. Three goals in the second period, right? Who scored fucking mash and fucking Burgee Belsky whatever the fuck his name is. And then, I don't know fuck suites. We actually went up for nothing. One, four to one.

Speaker 2:          00:10:01       That's another thing when I get back, I got my Bruins and Celtics package. I can start watching that shit so I can really start boring you guys with the sports talk. You know, I didn't see the Patriots game today cause I've been running around and haven't been spending time with my wife. So I took her out someplace today. She'll come on later and tell you all about it. And um, but all he knows, it's the usual shit on my fucking friends who are pats fans like, dude, why'd we trade Chandler George? Why we get rid of Jamie Collins. I fucking defense stank stone. Um, so I think it was, you know what should have been an easy game, I guess. Evidently wasn't, but a, I didn't see any of that. I watched the boxing though. Who the fuck that Russian guy, that ego Larry are enough. Was that his fucking name?

Speaker 2:          00:10:47       Whoever was a real hacky Russian name was Sergei Kovalev, which is like every Russian guy in the NHL. He's either, his first name is Sergei or his last name is called. That's really like the John Smith of Russian names. So he's fighting this American dude. So I got to go for the fucking American and uh, I got to tell you something the fucking first, first fucking round. All right. Ego Iron off comes out and he fucking punches Andre Reed. Was that the guy's name? Was that the guy in the bills? I can't fucking remember. I'm not a big boxing fan. I love the sport. I love it. But uh, it's been ruined. It's been ruined because every three pounds is a new weight class that has yet another fucking champion. And then there's like 15 different fucking boxing federations. It's a shit show like this, more boxing divisions than there are podcasts. And I'll tell you that stayed some, cause there's a lot of, um, you know what I mean? When I was a kid, it was like, it was like fly weight. It was like fly wade, featherweight, middleweight

Speaker 1:          00:11:54       welterweight, heavyweight, something like dad, I can't remember. I can't remember the fucking divisions now. Even things like, there's like 15 off shoots of each one of them. It's, you know what, it's like those superhero movies, like back in the day, like Superman was in a superman movie. Batman was in a bat. They didn't fucking know each other. They weren't all hanging out at the same place. Maybe on the, the super friends, they were super friends. They did at the hall of Justice. But they only did that. They did that when they drew it, but they never had that in movies. You know what I mean? Superman was Christopher Reeves. That was his fucking shit. And uh, see Batman. Right.

Speaker 3:          00:12:35       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:12:36       Oh, they have. They had Michael Keaton, remember that he was all sweaty in the locker room with just a towel around him where the bat mask and he got in the face of val Kilmer and he was like, that's right. Ice Man. I am dangerous. And then Val said, clicked his fucking teeth together and then they all played volleyball, you know? And then they were playing volleyball. Aqua man didn't come out of the Ocean Daddy. You know what I mean? Looking at Batman being like, take my breath away, dude. Who Do you know Kelly McGillis gets in an invisible jet? I can't remember the fucking, I believe the fucking names. I remember from that movie. I saw that movie a bunch of times. That was the one that I owned on VHS. Winnick Danke Danke [inaudible] right. I was in high school and everybody wouldn't want him to get a fucking Ninja motorcycle and fucking flight have sixteens, you know, inverted. We also be, we're going to do that. You know this, every once in a while, like a movie comes out and you're like, you know what? I'm going to fucking do that. Right. And then what happens? You know what happens to geometry, Algebra two and trig. All of that happens. So then you're like, oh, I'll wait a minute. Wait, I thought, oh, thought I think I was going to fly jets. Is that what I thought was going to happen? Oh, I'm sorry. I'm going to be a salesman.

Speaker 1:          00:13:53       You know I make people laugh. You know I, you know, am I coming over room? I make people feel good. You got a product? I'll do it. Huh? Well, you second cutting potatoes like this. What if you had that? I liked the guy with the John Riggins fucking Jersey in the crowd at the Redskins game, man. 44 it was always a bad ass fucking number. That was always a full back number when I was growing up. John Riggins, Robert Newhouse, you know Chuck Foreman? Yeah, I think it was a running back. Was he 44 that was a bad ass fucking number. Reggie Jackson. You know, now you're this guy, Starks. He's got to live. That's it. That's a fucking legendary number. I want to have any fucking hall of famers were 44. I fucked debt. How many fucking, just like skirts were 44. Not a lot. Everybody have a war. 44 was a tough motherfucker. Right. I like to thank John Riggins broke my heart man. Cause that was a big time cowboys fan

Speaker 2:          00:14:52       back then. Um, before, how about them cowboys and they kicked out Tom Landry and Tex Schramm. Uh, that was just the worst. You know, I thought Tom Landry was going to be this forever. You know, I was young. I didn't know. I didn't know people get old and it passes him by fucked up. Right. And uh, I hated the fucking red skins for beating the cowboys so much that when they were in that Superbowl actually rooted for the dolphins and I hated the fucking dolphins because we can never beat him. And uh, when Riggins broke through the line and whoever the fuck that was on the dolphins that came by and just grabbed him by the waist in slid down, I'm like a greased fucking pole. And he just kept running. That dad killed me. Was it age eight Dewey? And I'll fucking remember anyways. Um, how much time have I done?

Speaker 2:          00:15:40       He was a time for the fucking region. I don't think so. Um, hey, Neha, you want to come in here and tell people about your day? I get to tell you this shit, right? So I haven't been, you know, I've been fucking busting my ass. You know, I was getting ready to do this special and then editing all that bullshit I talked about earlier. So, you know, if you don't spend time with your wife, all of a sudden your wife gets all upset with you. Like, oh, you don't spend time with me and boo Hoo Hoo. I have fucking needs. Hey Nia, I'm just, I'm doing a character. What the fuck did I do with the Mike? There's the microphone. Is the microphone. All right. Hello. Talk to me. Talk to me goose. Hello. Um, so anyways, yeah, I haven't been spending time with you. So I figured today, you know what, I gotta go, I gotta do something, I gotta do something.

Speaker 2:          00:16:30       So I took my wife to go see Casap blanket today while the Patriots were on. I got to get credit for that. Okay. So, um, I thought it was at this old theater I was telling you about these guys on, I think Thursday I was telling him about it. Like there was, it was all these old theaters out here then I'm obsessed with where they had the Oscars throughout the years. I just think of all the great, you know, Comedians and actors and directors and everything that had been on. And I love that sense of history, right? So you've got the pantageous, he got the fucking who, some of what's out in Santa Monica, the Kodak Theater, all these fucking places. So, um, I just remember that one from the 80s and I always saw, I guess it was in downtown La. Maybe that's the one down the other way.

Speaker 2:          00:17:12       I don't fucking know. But I just looked him up and I was like, you know what, I'd love to do maybe a show there or I might want to do, um, you know, just go to something. And I, I looked up that one downtown and it said, uh, there was just a bunch of orchestras there and then it said it was Casablanca. I'm like a fucking love Humphrey Bogart. I'll take needed to go see that shit. So we go down and of course we show up in the theater. I want to go into, there's nobody there. They're like, oh yeah. Yeah, it's not here. It's at the theater next door. There's a little old couple. So you go up and um, we're walking around the theater. It's completely

Speaker 4:          00:17:50       deserted. Amari starting to course fucking storm. Yeah. Bill's already getting hot.

Speaker 2:          00:17:56       I'm going to fuck that. I was on the fucking website. It looked it up. I looked it up twice.

Speaker 4:          00:18:03       Couple who are walking with their little bonnets on because it was raining outside. Yup. Bill Ass. Like, oh, is this where they're having the movie? I was a little more frantic than that. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:18:16       Like you got you guys coming from the movie. You're old. And that was my energy

Speaker 4:          00:18:20       [inaudible] across the street at the concert hall. And you had your, one of your classic but you, you, you made the mistake and so you started having a little meltdown.

Speaker 2:          00:18:34       I didn't make a mistake because if you look the fucking theater up and you look okay, and it says it was at the Dorothy Chandler pavilion. No, you click on calendar events and then it just, it lists and it lists that. But I think the same person owns the theater. It's very fucking, you know, it's like buying a car. Yeah, we got it this lot. And all of a sudden you're down the street. It's like you're in good fellas. They're a little further down. I Dunno Jimmy. I think I'll pick it up tomorrow. That's what they did to me. Well anyway, it was across the street at the Walt Disney concert at the symphony looking thing that looks like a fucking exploded golf course designed by Frank Gehry. It's like one of the most like impressive the drummer from extreme, isn't it? No, it's a very famous architect. Zack, go lock what you see here. Get the fuck out. Get the fuck out. Get the fuck out. Get the fuck out. What are you singing? We won't try to, it's one of the widest, trying to be funky songs ever. Get the funk out. That one. And then there's the uh,

Speaker 4:          00:19:36       some big John is my name. Anyway, this building, this building was one of the most like impressive piece of architecture in Los Angeles. It's a beautifully designed space and bill is just like, I couldn't help but laugh at you because you were just muttering and cursing and stomping around in the rain.

Speaker 2:          00:19:58       Oh, go to this one. Oh, wanted to go into the gray ones. Super Modern Shit. I've done shows in those stupid symphony fucking things. You feel like you're in front of like the council and one of those superman movies where you're like down there all fucking up above you in that behind you. I fucking hate those things. So it was like, I don't want to fucking go into this thing. So I end up showing, but it's like I got to take it to this thing. It's fucking raining out. So Nia is all like, whoa, good. Go to the theater. Another time when it said Jan event,

Speaker 4:          00:20:28       so I calm you down cause it's not what? We're going to another building. No big deal. You know we're going to go seek. And then what happened

Speaker 2:          00:20:34       going, we shout. So we show up and I go, Hey, can I get, and I literally said to you, go, now we're going to fucking go to this stupid ass fucking theater, right? It's probably in some small room. It's going to be be you, me and four other old people and the movies, the movies almost ready to start, right? So we fucking show up and I go up to the booth and I go, yeah, I need two tickets to Casablanca. And the person's like, I don't know if there's any tickets left. And I'm like, what are you talking about? It's raining. It's Sunday. Football's on his fucking movies like 80 years old. Who is going to come through check, right? And then she finally goes, well you can't, I should. We found too, and I'm like, thank Christ, trying to do some romantic here. It's not the right fucking theater now they're going to be sold out.

Speaker 2:          00:21:23       She goes, you got to go down to windows. So I say, fine. I kept my cool, they're there, right? The rain and rain enough on my steam and head that I walked over and it cools you off a little bit. Cool me off a little bit. And I walk on my goal, let me get to, and I, they go, okay. And then they go and the guy goes, okay, that's going to be $161 I go $161 he goes, each and we both were like, wait. So it turned out no way. So this is what it turns. It turns out, I think this is way too loud here. I got to turn this down here. It turns out that, um, what was happening was the La Philharmonic was going to be playing the film score while you watched the movie. Turns out this is a major la cultural event that was basically the fall out.

Speaker 2:          00:22:11       Bill was just going to be a movie for a few old people in us. It turns out it's this major event. Every he's got on like sport coats and fucking dresses and shit. I'm sitting there, my wet hoodie going on, Humphrey Bogart in there. What the fuck's going on? Right. We can view the view the body, Aaron Eckhart and like introduces the fucking movie. So you know, you know when you just don't give a shit, I just said fuck it. So I light up the card and I go, let's go in there. And then I start getting this feeling of like, this might be my, this might be fucking amazing. And then there's all these ushers walking around hitting these things that are gone. Boom, boom. Like letting people know that, you know, that whole, like you don't want to disturb rich white people, that the things are about ready to start, whatever that fucking instrument is called. Um, and they fucking go in there. Uh, we go in there and, and like, it's like Holy Shit. Like we're going to listen to what the La Philharmonic while we watched Casablanca and I'll fucking great was, it was amazing. It was such an awesome experience. So bill kind of fumbled, fumbled his way into her. Really amazing romantic day and I get no credit. I get no credit because I picked the wrong fucking theater. I just totally stumped. So Kenny, you'd be like, Hey, you see that with the orchestra? I picked that out on purpose.

Speaker 2:          00:23:37       I feel like you definitely get points for you seeing that you saw something cultural going on and you're, oh, that sounds cool. Like Nini would like that. And we went and it turned out to be amazing. So it was, it was great. Yeah. Erin, it was Carl Marriner was not a hail Mary, the actor, the actor came out and introduced the movie oil man. Is there another famous Aaron Eckhart? I don't know. Are you being sarcastic? I'm being a Dick Right now. Was he in, was he in no, no country for old men. He was in then get out of here. Bitch in the company of men.

Speaker 2:          00:24:12       And he was in Sally. Sally. Oh yeah, the mustache. Yes. He was in that movie. He was in that movie, which, well that was a movie. That was a movie they made up. They made a, evidently they made up all of this other shit. It was just so fucking boring. Can I just say that? You don't have to say it. I'll say, come on. It's Clint Eastwood. It was wrapped up forward Senate. Jerry's in it has a bunch of us. We had, yes, we have friends that are in that movie, but thou are we a Hollywood couple of our friends are in it. That movie was so boring because you know why? Because nobody, this is some sounds so terrible, but nobody died. Nobody got no, he nailed her leg. It was nailed it. He put it right where it was supposed to put it. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:25:00       There was no hype off by engines. Went out at 1500 feet. Should I try to land it in the water or fly back over the most densely populated area in the United States, so he put it in the water. Everyone survived. The whole thing took in real life, 24 minutes for everyone to get rescued. It's like, what is the movie about? Well, they had to have them have to do you to have the evil corporate guys going. You couldn't save the jet. Yeah. Could you push some people out on the way over? It just wasn't exciting. Tom Hanks is, is a, is a wonderful actor. All the acting was great in it. I want to see it play a serial killer. I'm so sick of him always being doing the right thing. That's not his brand. That's not Tom Hanks is brand. He's not a serial killer. Did he die in saving private Ryan?

Speaker 2:          00:25:46       Spoiler alert number. He was just sitting there firing at the tech. You never saw that? No, it's not. I'm not into those kind of, I'm not. It's a war movies. It's not a war movie. Saving Private Ryan is not about a war and soldiers that dye in it. Well, I mean that's literally what it is, but it's more of a metaphor. It is saving private Ryan is a metaphor. Metaphor. What is it? A metaphor for a, please explain. So you don't even know what you're talking about. Even know what a metaphor is. It's an incredible fucking movie and I believe you. All right. Okay. We kind of just killed your credibility to say Sally's boring and then you're like, yeah, I'm not in a war movie. That was private. Ryan. Ryan's almost unbelievable fucking moves ever saw. Why is that? Kill my credibility. Just because I didn't like I said, oh, I see. That's how it works. One thing has to do with the other. I don't know. You've been bugging me lately. Why? Yeah, I dunno. I just, I don't want to be a dick, but he putting on weight. Excuse me.

Speaker 2:          00:27:09       Wait gotta be parents, everybody. I'm so excited for us. Do you know what it is? They don't give a shit. I'm actually, I think people have been people who have, you know who you are. We already tweeted a offline stay offline. Don't become that person. I feel like people care. Listen. Why? Cause it's going to bring out all the people who have nasty things to say about it. No, because people have lives. But people have been actually been very sweet. What, what

Speaker 1:          00:27:39       no, you know is you're watching those fucking, those lady screaming at each other too much and the ones where they sit around, you know, it was one of the funny things I saw lately. It was when you, you had the fucking Kardashians on what the sound down? Yeah. So much of the footage as them just looking at each other with their fucking mouth kind of open like slack jawed because someone else is talking over the top. Just going, I just feel like when Mandy said to sandy that she, you know, she couldn't go during the nose job trip. I felt that she was upset and we, as the person's talking, they just cut to their faces. They're like, dude, I can't, it's official. They look like those little pouty cats.

Speaker 2:          00:28:16       Okay. Let me know. Okay, what the heck. I don't know what that had to do. I don't know. I just want you to turn this into a Kelly rip a moment guys. And this is what were just makes me feel like, you know, I'm starting to understand why Michael Strahan left that show.

Speaker 1:          00:28:36       Um, so anyways, yeah, it's official. It is confirmed. All right. No it is and I'm, and I'm just going, I'm not going to one of these fucking assholes.

Speaker 2:          00:28:44       You're very, no, you're like, you're grudgingly talking about it and I understand why. I know, cause I fucking hate parents. You hate math. I hate it. Why?

Speaker 1:          00:28:53       [inaudible] is just the hardest fucking job, the most rewarding job. Like Blah, blah blah. And you know, and then they all say it, they all fuck. Even like chuck Yeager would say some shit like that. It's like really dude flying a fucking jet up into space. Like trying to get a kids fucking backpack on for first grade is, is more difficult than what the fuck he just went through up there. You know what I mean? I think that they placate to fucking isn't the right word to Joe Sixpack where they gotta be

Speaker 2:          00:29:20       little heroes, panda, panda. They're real people are the real heroes out there. The people out there, they're there. They're, they're baking the tuna fish sandwiches, cutting it into four fucking pieces. You had sex and you didn't use protection. That's what you did. Now here, you're right. You're not Tom Hanks pretending to land a fucking into the Hudson river. Okay. You did. It's not exactly the miracle on the Hudson. So all Billy booze bag's going to get a couple more rights and lefts in before the little, the little one comes. And then I'm going to be, I gotta be, I gotta be, so I've got to pick my spots. Is that, is that the idea is that's what's been happening that you've just got to go on like a little bit of a bender. The, I've been on a bender the whole fucking year and then when the baby comes, you're going to just like cut yourself off.

Speaker 2:          00:30:10       Yeah. I mean, what am I doing? Maybe fucking hung over and we'll be that guy. No, I hope not. Yeah. No, I'm not going to do that. Now that's over. It's done. But then I got all this great hooch back at the house, so I got, I got us kill it, kill it before it comes. You have to like drink all the alcohol before the baby. It's not like you're never going to happen. Do I gotta make space for like fucking sippy cups and shit though? Not Word. A word. A wordle suck in my bottles down. They're not going to go on the bar. You don't have to worry about making sport. You know what? I'll save some of my pappy van winkles. We had more than most spoiled kid ever. When the baby's teething, I'll rub pappy van winkles on. It's on. It's fucking gums.

Speaker 2:          00:30:52       Isn't that what you're supposed to do? I Dunno. I Dunno. I like that. That's an old school thing, but I'm already going to do this shit. Like every time the kid cries, I'm not fucking going in the, I'm going to, there's this great book that I read on Norwegian parenting that says that, you know, when the kid starts crying, he just, it just kind of, you know, you creep up to the bed and then you kind of look and he just go hi and then that's it. You scare the shit out of it and it understands what's going on. You're making fun of, when I told you was in the book that I'm reading, by the way, it's 29 24 fucking Washington Bay just score. This is a great kid. This might just be one of those old San Diego Charger Games. Are you watching the football game while you're doing the podcast? I Dunno. I just thought that's not a push in the back. Get the fuck out of here. Anyways. What were we talking about? Oh, you're having a kid.

Speaker 2:          00:31:46       I'm probably the biggest moment in our relationship ever. Nobody did. Well, let's see what happens. Yeah, so we've been going to like fucking lamaze classes and shit. She's fucking Christ. The classes have been great. The classes have been great, but this, this, this is how far the fucking progressive left has gone, is a fucking line for when she comes in. It says, mom, will you sign up in me? I'm thinking finally name of mother, name of mother and then I'm like, and then my column like I'm finally going to be called a dad after almost living on this planet for half a fucking century and it just says partner fucking ridiculous. And what kills me is everybody in their heterosexual, all in a fucking relationship. Everybody there was was there was all straight couples, straight couples in. All the dads were there. Yeah, yeah, that's true. And then she just keeps going. Coaches, coaches, calling them coach. I swear to God, Dude, I'm to show up with a fucking whistle next week.

Why his last class? I didn't hear it too busy muttering under your breath about every time she says coaches, I say fathers or fathers. I'm not trying to cut out gay people or people who got bag behind a fucking Carl's Jr. You know what I mean? But what about us? That's the solution. I thought it's inclusive. He's supposed to include people. I'll take second and third billing behind a alternative people. What did you think of that? I'm birthing video that we watched the last glass.

Speaker 1:          00:45:47       I walk around with headphones in my house just listening to my own podcast. When Andrew cuts together the clips, he uses the same date from eight years ago. Last Thursday was from November 17th, 2008. Oh, he told me he does it. That's cool. He said in that episode you made a reference to cash cab, which was hosting, which was hosted by your guests this week, Ben Bailey, also a couple of weeks ago. When you first mentioned watching Westworld, the throwback clip had you mentioned the original Westworld once again, eight years ago to the, to the day. Yeah, that back then. That's what I wanted to buy the rights to it until I realized it was zillions of dollars. And I was like, oh, forget it by, by everybody and all. I had in my whole representation all excited. Like, is he going to do something like this? We can get a piece of this. And I was like, oh, that's too much money.

Uh, what are you going to teach us to cook this year? If I don't get another cooking video? Like the pie crust masterpiece. I'm boycotting the season. I'm the single one of my siblings. And last year I showed up with a Pi and waited until everyone was done to let them know I made it. Then I showed them your Wii video and we had some full fully belly last full, I think full belly laughs is what you want to say. Uh, don't let me make a,

Speaker 2:          00:47:30       don't let me make, let my family down. Don't let me let my family down by letting me down. Okay. Thanks for all the free labs. Um, hearing you get through that. So I know my eyes are always 10 words ahead of what I can fucking remember. I think that's what happens. So maybe I'm just dumb. Um, it's going to be sad when our kids, a better reader than me. Fucking six months in her baby's going to teach you how to read. It's going to read you a book. And Maya, I, whenever I've read to like my nieces and nephews, like there's a point when they stopped looking at the book and they just turn around and look at me and then it's like more pressure at him and I'm literally reading like the rabbit goes, hop, hop, hop, hop. It doesn't go hop. It hops.

Speaker 2:          00:48:17       A cow goes moo. And maybe that helps you out there. Fucking old and bald. Um, well I feel like last year, like making a pie crust, it was like a real fucking skill that I had. Like, I don't know what else to show you guys, how to make, um, you know, if Nia lets me get this fucking griddle that I want to get, Oh my God, this great old, oh my God, this fucking griddle. It's like you love when I Cook, but you don't want to be, you don't want to, you know what I mean? It's like you like your freedom, but you don't want to see how it happens. You're the same way with food. You know touchdown fucking Redskins. God dammit,

Speaker 4:          00:48:51       because I don't know what, what are you trying to do here? You're trying to get like every fucking invention that has to do with cooking or grilling or smoking or frying. You want to buy it and it's just like, where are we going to put all this shit? Okay, let's list all the shit that I've bought. I'm not saying that you bought it all. I'm saying that you want to buy it at all.

Speaker 2:          00:49:10       Why? I do want to buy it all and why haven't I bought it all? Because there's no room for it. Oh, and who determined that? I mean, oh, another Ms Dexter point.

Speaker 4:          00:49:24       Who determined that Nia, I you decided that? I thought it was a mutual. Yep.

Speaker 2:          00:49:29       Wasn't all right. I had a buddy of mine was going to hook me up with this smoke up pellet smoker, you said? No. Okay.

Speaker 4:          00:49:36       Well because he tried to act like he told me it was a size of a, of a typewriter and then we'll be a solid and when he actually showed it to me, he was like, come here, let me show you. Let me show you what it looks like and then I looked at it and I'm like, and what universe is this? The size of a typewriter? It's the size of her. I said, it's a sewing, like a sewing machine. He goes, oh yeah, yeah. It's more like a sewing machine. I'm like, a sewing machine is on a typewriter. Okay,

Speaker 2:          00:49:59       tell you something there. That's why guys are great. That's why I love that dude forever because you know we do that for each other. I don't know if women do. I want to speak for you guys, but guys do that

Speaker 4:          00:50:10       for each other. It was a site. It's the size of a wall. You need a kitchen the size of his kitchen in order to do all the things that you want to do.

Speaker 2:          00:50:18       Yeah, portable thing. It's on fucking wheels. It's in the back, but we got like three fucking tables in the backyard and I can't get rid of any of those tables for the fucking potato salad. You know, every piece of furniture I put in the backyard has a function and we have used it in that function. That doesn't make any sense, but you could also mean no, you're, you're, what you're doing is you've become the dictator or the fucking backyard. You're the woman. I own the backyard. I own the fucking garage. If we had a basement, that's my shit. You can have the rest of the fund can house. All right, so what is saying? I'm saying I'm getting that griddle. Okay.

Speaker 3:          00:50:59       Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:51:00       All right. Well, I have Jesus Christ. Yeah, you're going to hear him say that until I fucking make you a nice fucking steak and cheese or make some hash browns or make a grand slam breakfast gains. You've been making all of those things without the grid because it guy, right? So, exactly. So what do you need all this other stuff for if you're so talented? Because just imagine how good it would taste if I actually had a fucking griddle,

Speaker 2:          00:51:28       even though it's fucking stoves that have a griddle. If the thing sucks because it's, it's one heat source, so you can't, you can't have difference. He can't move it around. You can't play with your heat. It sucks. It's like this is the temperature. It's a pain in the fucking ass. It's one thing if you've got a pot or a pan, you can take it on the heat, take it off, but when you're on your fucking Gretel, you know you want one on one off and maybe one a little bit on. Why don't you just get one of those old little electric grills at the little, the little way a freshman in college. Once you can put on your counter, well, when you divorce me. Oh, that's too sad to say. If you ever do that. Do you ever do that? And I'll do everything that it can be as a grown fucking man to buy divorcee kitchen products.

Speaker 2:          00:52:09       Fuck. Are you talking about divorce? I'll go to Mcdonald's and grab some extra packets of ketchup for in the future when I need more ketchup. I've done all that. Nia, I've used shares for tables, ate pasta all fucking day, had pancakes. I've done all that. I've done this. We know. Yeah. Yeah. Yo, you sick of my self made man. Shit, that annoys you, doesn't it? I would eat spaghetti with prego and, and the bread because we fill me up and it will last me all night, do all my spots and I would eat pancakes because it kept me the most full like cement. And you know how I'm doing that for the fucking people out there. Women included. Go on to be one to fucking make something happen and food's a big thing cause you got a fucking habit every day. She got to have that shit that fills you up.

Speaker 2:          00:52:52       Right? Listen, don't let this little ray of Sunshine fucking rain on your parade. Okay. I'm here for all you guys. I'm the positive guy. I'm the motivational speaker. Hey, speaking of motivation of what the fuck's going on with the P90x guy, do you become a Vegan or something? Well first of all, he's not too P90x anymore. He's got a dick thing late night. Yeah. Yeah. But now Tony Horton, he's looking a little like, he's not doing his pull ups anymore. He's getting older. He's looking like, um, I dunno. He's looking all veggie. Hmm. Anyways, so I don't know what I'm going to make this year. I told you.

Speaker 2:          00:53:29       Oh, you mean for the people? For this guy. Yeah. Yeah. You want me to, I'm not showing my family secret family fucking recipe of the best stuffing you're ever going to have admitted. Most people stuffing fucking sucks stuffing that bill. Maggs oh my God. It's so delicious and I've never had good, that's the only stuffing I've ever had that even like it. Me Too. I don't ever like stuffing. I don't roast. It was wet and it already has a bad aftertaste. Yeah, this is nice and crispy and like buttery. Oh, it's so good. Yeah. When you got, you got that fucking barbecue the other night. You didn't like the corn bread. They put that weird ingredient in there. Ah, bumble you so and so. Read another question. Dammit. When the fuck did I become such a packers fan? This is certain old NFL teams I like. I see like the giants. Can you fucking believe that if the what they did to my patriots twice, um, one flew over the cuckoo's nest. All right. Hey, they're all Billy bibbet. Um, it's funny who's vivid? It was a character in one flew over the cuckoo's nest. Oh Shit.

Speaker 2:          00:54:33       What's his face downstairs here and old friend of mine has gone so far down the rabbit hole of conspiracy theories that he really can't even function in society anymore. Oh, that's relatable. Tell him to start telling jokes. Ease. He is unable to hold a conversation for two minutes without going off on some rambling horse shit about chem trails, Freemasons, aliens, and all of that crap. Completely oblivious to the fact that none of us are interested in hearing about all that nonsense he reads on the Internet. It used to be funny, we were driving out west a few years back and he pointed out at some lights moving up in the sky and said, those are the aliens that follow me around. Oh, this sounds like a mental issue, dude. I said, what does that sign on the right said? He said, airport next sex, exit it. And I said, yeah, those are airplanes.

Speaker 2:          00:55:26       You check. Yes. And he said, well, maybe some of them. Wow. He goes, okay. It's been over a decade of that kind of Shit. And it's gotten way, way worse because of this obsession and the resulting paranoia. He can't even hold down a menial job. And all of his friends have abandoned ship. He become addicted to painkillers. I think he already had a mental issue, man. Yeah, of course. Has Been in and out of rehab centers in hospitals because of bizarre health problems and is now bordering on full blown schizophrenia. Well, you don't get that from reading conspiracy theory, sir. Yeah. You really kind of did a fucking thing right here with that question, that whole thing in the beginning, which is like a red herring. It turns out he's got like serious mental problems. What's a red herring? It's just, it's just a distraction.

Speaker 2:          00:56:11       Exactly. It's something that you think is the cause of, you know, I'm not explaining it right, cause I'm tired, but oh, I gotta use that excuse sometimes when I use an expression that it can, oh Jesus, my brain mush Christ. How many points does fucking Aaron Rodgers got to put up? You know, it's like Tom Brady, same thing. How many fucking points is you get a score at the end. It's gonna, you know, defense. Um, I want to respect his right to believe what he wants to believe, but in the end it has only caused him to lead and increasingly miserable and lonely life that will end in a tragedy and a sparsely attended funeral unless something changes soon. So how the fuck do you bring someone back from so far over the edge? Okay, well he might be exaggerating a little bit with maybe he's using, schizophrenia is like a fucking filler word.

Speaker 2:          00:57:01       They're like, you know, this guy, narcissists, guy's a sociopath, but sounds like paranoid schizophrenia answers. Exactly. Oh, Dr. Hill. Or you're going to diagnose that on this fucking fucking email. Unfortunately, a member of my family who went through this exact thing, I do feel that I recognize it a little bit. Yes. As a matter of fact, I do. Okay. But do you feel like that you can make that diagnosis as someone who is not a doctor? No, of course not. A comedian is not even a podcaster that you can on a podcast done by a comedian as not a doctor. Diagnose this person that you've never met based on this four paragraph email to come in here. So I'm giving my opinion. You're going to start a song. You asked me to come here. Are you annoyed that that lady singing about all the ingredients, you get annoyed when black shit goes fucking mainstream and then white people ruin it? Well, I got peas, greens, tomatoes, potatoes. That she,

Speaker 5:          00:57:59       yeah, that thing.

Speaker 2:          00:58:04       I swear to God if, if that's what my whole week long run before everyone else. That was my, my church was like I would, I would go every week if it was only a half hour long. I still see, I just can't get into the fucking, I liked to sing and part of black churches, but even when the priest, regardless of race, when they get up there and they start saying that this invisible guy gives a shit about me, that's, I just, I tap out. I just can't listen to it. Anyway, he wants, he teases tcis she hair that. That's the second flat screen downstair friend needs per chill stuff. You're not going to be a, I like Jola state. He's a very positive guy. Well you know something, he's been out there long enough that you'd think if there was a scandal it would come up. I know, right. Um, this, your friend needs professional help. This is beyond your, um, this is beyond your pay grade. Cheez its don't Shit on the guy. He might have just been being funny just because I'm not shitting on him. I'm saying that you're, his friend needs help and this is not anything that he is qualified to do. So because he listened. Not much nicer way of saying the sanest beyond your pay grade a buddy and she get go pick up your Broman keep sweeping up. This is the job of people with lab coats. Um, hold

Speaker 4:          00:59:21       on a second. But what does he is he said like, I respect his right to believe what he wants to believe, but in the end that Dah, Dah, Dah. Yeah. I don't, I don't even think he necessarily maybe even believes, believes that he's just got, yeah, he's, yeah. He's becoming into paying claims had been in and out of rehab centers and hospitals because of bizarre health problems. Yeah. He is now bordering on full blown schizophrenia. Yeah. I think you just gotta be there for them, but maybe just check in on them and say, Hey, are you taking your meds? Are you going to see your doctor? That type of thing. But sure. I don't think you're going to be able to like help him with this. It's all on you. Is that what I decided to, yeah. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:59:59       You know, it's fucking cool as shit. The Redskins still have a band and they actually have a team song. I think that's fucking cool. It's a professional level. For some reason that all went away. I hope our baby doesn't get your add. Why? It's worked great for me. It has it. Yeah. Yeah, it has. Yeah. I played drums for helicopter still jokes add as far as a fucking great thing to have. It's sucks with some shit, but it's gets, it sucks when you're in school and you're going to do poorly in school and everyone's going to say you're fucking dumb, but when you get out in the world, man, it's fucking tremendous.

Speaker 3:          01:00:45       It's tremendous.

Speaker 2:          01:00:48       I know I run around all day long having very, so you don't have it like severely though. You are able to fucking, you just get, you know, even get the lab glasses on tonight though. Just fucking diagnosed and everything. How do you know what I have at is remember when we tried to do that add questionnaire and you couldn't even pay attention long enough to answer the question you have a part of that was because I was annoyed with it. You want to revisit that real quick? Do an Oldie but goodie. All Right, Bill, my kid is 14 years old, 14 years old and he wants a drone for Christmas. The drone market is huge with kids these days. When I was a kid, we want it to fly something for the sake of flying it. Now they all have cameras attached to them and they hover in a real creepy way.

Speaker 2:          01:01:33       He's not a punk, so he won't flip out if he doesn't get one. His friends have them. So it's not like he, he had never used one. If I did get him one and he's not the type of kid to fly it up to someone's window. So that's not the concern. I'm coming from a place like if I didn't want him to get an earring, uh, more of, don't be that kid. I might be overreacting, but that's just something. But there's just something about drones. What do you think, uh, congrats on the condition. Uh, thank you. Um, I would say, uh, I agree with you. No drowns, no drones with the cameras. That's too much to shoot the shit I would have fucking done. I would have the hottest chick in the neighborhood. I would have had it out there hovering, hovering near a bathroom. Yay.

Speaker 4:          01:02:20       If he's not, then his friends are going to, his friends are going to be like, let's just take it over here and just see,

Speaker 1:          01:02:25       and this is a thing, you know, that the person watching is jerking off if it immediately crashes.

Speaker 4:          01:02:36       So kids are really using drone like that. There are they is that the hot gift? This Christmas is a drone

Speaker 1:          01:02:42       for a teenager. I mean it's, it's an amazing fucking thing. It really is. I mean, I can't imagine like just flying over a neighborhood to see what your neighborhood looks like from the air or your house. All of that would be cool. But the, the, the possibilities, the shit that she could do with those things, uh, in a, with the juvenile brain, I don't know. I would be nervous. One of the best things my parents did was they never let us play video games. They never let us play it. They just, you're not getting that. It's going to fuck with the schoolwork. You know, it's funny as I still fucked up in school, but the great thing is is I'm not a fucking 48 year old gamer. You know like I just think that's, that's really like a I, I, you know, I kind of judges that shit like after a while like like what do you, what are you doing? You know what I mean? Which you want to go outside.

Speaker 1:          01:03:34       Like the amount of time that people spend. You could learn a language, you learn how to play an instrument is I'm literally doing whatever you get delta is. You could go out and do the things that I find interesting the fuck if you're into video games, go ahead and play it. But I'm glad that I didn't cause I wasted enough time watching fucking sports. I can't imagine because I told you I've, I've always said I tapped out after grand theft auto three. It literally took over my life. I'm so sick of this fucking commercial where they showed the Ford F-150 with the aluminum bed and it has, it doesn't have any bed liner and they dropped the fucking toolbox into it and then they showed the Chevy with the steel one. This is such bullshit advertising. What it's really is, is I bet the Ford gets better gas mileage because it has a lighter bed and then all you do is just put that to the same rubber guard that comes in all pickup trucks. What kind of a fucking asshole buys a pickup truck and you don't have the bed liner? The Fuck Outta here. Fuck Chevy. Even though I like this Silverado. All right. Thanksgiving debacle. Oh, Billy Turkey legs. Don't get your kid a drone if you don't want them to have the drone. You're the, you're the parent. All right. Um, it wasn't another add moment that I leave it there. I'm going a little debacle with

Speaker 4:          01:04:39       lady

Speaker 1:          01:04:42       about Thanksgiving. I want my girl to come to my thanksgiving, but it starts like only an hour before hers.

Speaker 1:          01:04:51       I'm going a little bit of a dip out for my lady about Thanksgiving. I want my girl to come to my thanksgiving, but it starts only an hour before hers, but they're in the same time town. Mind you, mine's at my aunt's house in hers. Is that her parents? Mine starts at 12 hers starts at one 30 I wanted her to come to mind for a little bit before hers, but she's not having it because she's got to help her mom cook. Well, this is easy. So you just say you'll be over there at fucking one 30 and you just going to make an appearance, which you can make it nutsy your family on Thanksgiving. He said, on one hand, I'm super salty and want to be a huge in, want to make a huge deal about this because I really want her there and I think she's being selfish, but on the other hand, I understand she's got to help her mom cook and stuff.

Speaker 1:          01:05:32       At least that's her excuse. I know she loves her family, but it really pisses me off because she's never been to my family shit. But I've got gone. I've gone to plenty of hers. Hers offense is that she's never made me miss any of my family gatherings to go to hers. But my family is a bunch of nut jobs and you get the point, uh, old Billy burnt Dick. I could use some words of wisdom. I am a huge fan. Thanks. And Go fuck yourself. Happy holidays. Huge Fan. Well, I mean this is all you're doing so you can undo all of this. All right.

Speaker 3:          01:06:07       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:06:08       You know, you just gotta put your foot down. Just say, listen, I respect, I understand you've got to help you mother cook. But I, you know, I want to see my aunt, my family on Thanksgiving, so I will go over there. I'll be there over the for an hour. All right. And then I'll be over here at one 30 in time to eat and if she has a problem with that, um, just ask her why do you have a problem with that? This is perfect. I, I'll, I'll, you don't have, you don't have to come, you don't have to come to, to, uh, my family of nut jobs as you say. And uh,

Speaker 4:          01:06:42       yeah, she's trying to get out of going to your families is what I'm wondering because most people, I feel like in the situation, you just split it up so she's got to go help her family cook.

Speaker 3:          01:06:53       Okay.

Speaker 4:          01:06:55       You could go over there with her while they're doing that. Talk to the dad of the brothers, whatever. I don't know if they're going to be cooking or whatever. Spend that time, have the meal and then the two of you then go to your, your family's house for dessert and like coffee and a movie or a game night or whatever. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:07:14       There's his starts early. It starts at 12 they're starts at one 30 so I'm saying, I just, I tell, listen, you go over your mom's house, you cook. I'm going over my aunts from 12 to one I'll be back at one 30 show up like, and then you show up at like one 40 you know what? I'm going to spend like an hour though. That's nothing

Speaker 4:          01:07:32       you cause you'd like the food isn't going on the table right at swell. Everyone's going to like saunter and around 1230 1245 sit down then eat. I would take it, it's going to be there.

Speaker 1:          01:07:43       This is what I would do. I would say this deal, I'm going to there for an hour, then I'm gonna go to one 30. Right? One 30, I'll be at your place, but next year we're going to my families. This isn't even about like, I'm not going to like never see my family on Thanksgiving again. Right. I would never do that to you. Are you saying I can't see my family anymore on Thanksgiving? You just do that. Just

Speaker 4:          01:08:01       go, yeah, go to his families and just say, Hey, text me when you guys are about to like sit down because she's going to cook and do all this other stuff. So it was like, text me when you guys are about to sit down. I'll let you know where I'm at with my dinner and then I'll just

Speaker 1:          01:08:16       come over there. And that's what he need to do is say it totally calmly do not trasher do not, do not say anything insulting about her family. Do not let her. Uh, and then when you stay calm, if she does that thing where she then tries to bait you into a fight, do not take the bait. Just ask her why she's reacting that way or just stay calm. Stay on target star wars. Right. You just, you just make your points and that's it. Yeah, that sounds reasonable. Well there you go. So you like how great the movie was Casablanca and it was really nice. I finally understood the fucking movie. I always got confused. I understood the love story, but I, I didn't quite understand, you know, unoccupied France and the talking and like Nazi Germany and shit. It's just like the taking over your country and it's just like, I guess they hadn't there. Their power hadn't gotten to that point cause it was like Italian soldiers there. There was German soldiers and there was fucking these, these German Nazi guys. I don't know. I'll have to watch it again. I'd maybe read a little bit of fucking history, but I actually understood the love story this time. It was fucking great. How beautiful is that woman too, Huh? Yeah, she's beautiful. She was like modern day. Beautiful too. A lot of them back then or back then. Beautiful. You know what I mean? Like, Hey, what'd he say? They're fucking Ellis island.

Speaker 1:          01:09:36       She's a classic. Ah, ah, there she goes. There you go. Sleep and like a damn dog lately because of your condition, because the main condition, very tired. I think you'd be in a jerk about it personally. They think you're being a jerk about it. I'm not. Why is my fucking leg hurt? Oh my God. I'm going to end like those fucking people in the orchestra pit. Just, we'll fucking Lisi that one guy was like 55 just sitting there. He looked like he just fell off a motorcycle. Um, anyways. Well I'm glad you had a good time. I hope you enjoy it because a, I'm watching all the rest of the football Sundays from here on out is they empty the liquor cabinet. So is that our last Sunday out? Is that what you're saying? Until, and I would like to do that. I've been asked and I've been, uh, looking up museums and shit on the download, trying to understand Armoury I never understood it.

Speaker 1:          01:10:29       I find that I, I like, uh, uh, I forget what period is, it's the van Gogh when the period out to van Gogh. I liked that shit. Okay, that's cool. I liked that. The abstract. I'm starting to understand that. Well, you don't need lines. You have colors to suggest moods. It's like, all right, let's get shit. I know it looks like a five year old. It's always going to look like a five year old. Did it? What do you like modern art do you think? Or do you like the more old classic stuff? Uh, like the van Gogh versus the Jeff Koons. I don't know who, Jeff Koons. Andy Warhol. Andy Warhol was the original hipster. His brutally, brutally fucking overrated. Ooh. Heartache and was not a nice person. And what about basket? Yeah. Did

Speaker 2:          01:11:14       you like basket? I like basket. It's not the dude looks like saving and Glover, but he painted safe young Glover. Wow. Oh my God. I haven't heard that name in awhile. Uh, yes. He's sorta like the weekend before he cut his hair, he was doing like an homage to basket. Yeah. Yes. That's, that's the John Michel Basquiat. That's the most modern person I listened to. Yeah. To the point I preordered his next album. I know, I love it. I got it. I got the first two songs. I want to hear it. Oh, he said listen to it after this. Absolutely. As I fall asleep because of my condition. How far are we talking about my condition? Not that much. Right. What do you mean? Like we're not going to get into all like all the specifics. No we're not. I'm just, something's got the sacks and all that pictures.

Speaker 2:          01:12:04       No, none of that shit. It's just like the kitchen. You just get to know it got redone. Just know that after I share enough, there's too many fucking Weirdos on the fucking Internet. I don't, I do not understand people that post pictures of their children, you know, because you get excited because there's so going home address right above your fucking head for them, for the family photo. Cause they're so cute and you just want to like show off, you know. But I definitely understand why we will not be doing that. All right. This is probably a conversation that should have happened off of the podcast. All right, you fucking coolant bill.

Speaker 2:          01:12:46       What the fuck did I do to my leg? I just laid down and I feel like I hyper extended my, who is the comedian? What's his name? You always bring him up, Richard Kind? No. Uh, oh. Robert Klein. Robbery Gla. Robert Klein. I can't stop my look. Very good. Look at you. See I wear, I wear saving Glover. Then you hit me back. White style little Robert Klein. All right, that's the podcast for this week. Go Fuck Yourself. Have a wonderful Thanksgiving and I will be checking in on you on Thanksgiving. No, you will not. You say, well no, you will not. Listen, we're going to eat at one 30 I'm going to do a podcast at 12 at my parents' house. Take. You can, you can take Thanksgiving off. People understand Nia, I believe you are. People said money never sleeps right here. 24 seven. What are some of the stupid shit they asleep?

Speaker 2:          01:13:46       We grind. Yeah. I'll let dumb shit like, like Bill Gates isn't doing that. You're going to do a podcast on thanksgiving. What is wrong with you? Well, maybe you'll do it the day before thanksgiving. That's a big pet peeve of mine. When performers or talk about how fucking hard they work, you know, and they take those pictures of them where they lived, they got their head down like they're fucking exhausted, you know, and then he just said leads to these fucking and posed compliments. You know that people would stop. I feel like I'm just beginning. But that essentially what you're doing, if you're going to be working on thanksgiving, no, nothing. No, that was a really weak way to try to manipulate it back and the, I'm going to do it. So if you just, you want to have the argument now, cause I'm gonna do it. I'm too tired.

Speaker 2:          01:14:32       There you go. Go to sleep. Seriously, you're putting on a lot of weight and Oh my God, I'm not attracted to you right now. I just don't understand what it is. That's not true. Don't say that. Yeah, he just told me I look beautiful. I do look through. You still look great. You're all fucking baby in my belly. You're all belly. So anyways, all right. I'm uh, I dunno. I'm going to figure out how to make a fucking pan into a griddle and make myself something because I'm an adult and I, I can't fucking have a griddle. I'm sure you'll figure it out. No, I'm getting that grill. I'm getting rid of those fucking tables out there. There's too many fucking tables. Huh? What do we have in the last supper? Is Jesus coming back right in our back fucking yard and that longwinded do, she's going to sit there and [inaudible]. Good to do for you. I did the trashy Norman. Yes. He trash in Jesus. Jesus. Is that, is that what county he goes by? Yes. Easy. Hey radio. Fuck you.

Speaker 2:          01:15:35       Um, I want to get, I'm going to get that big. I would just yelling at a fucking what did, what would you call that when his radio form of communication. Yeah. Yell at a form of communication and then cancel a show at the fucking, he has to be a magic Johnson's house. Fuck you. A Internet. You Internet on a string, but you ham radio. We get it. Kevin Hart's funny. But, so, uh, I was a kid I saw in fucking the new def jam, first of all, Tony Rock flushing it as a host. Tony rocks a fucking star by the way.
