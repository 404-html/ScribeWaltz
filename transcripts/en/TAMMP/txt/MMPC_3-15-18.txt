Speaker 1:          00:00:01       Hey, what's going on is bill burns, is Sanford the Thursday afternoon? Just before Friday, Monday morning podcast and

Speaker 1:          00:00:11       just checking in on. You just see now you weeks go in. How your life is, how you're feeling this day. Um, uh, I'm not, I don't know. I don't, you know, you know I was supposed to get my Invisalign off yesterday. Right? I was all excited. This shit was supposed to take 16 weeks and because I wore them like a fucking lunatic, basically 24, seven occasion, I'd smoke a cigar or I do is set. If I did a long set and I didn't feel like spitting all over the stage, I would take him out. But a lot of times it just left them in one time I left them in when I smoked a cigar. That was a bad move. Bad move. I just sit there and brush and pluck an hour so there wouldn't be fucking all brown. Hey.

Speaker 1:          00:01:00       So last time I saw my dentist, he's like, oh gee. Willikers it wouldn't wearing them so much. I think we'll be done by the 13th week. And I was like, you gotta be kidding me. This is a great, I tried not to get excited. I tried to be like, okay, well I'm supposed to be, you know, just mentally just keep being prepared for the end of March when these things are going to be off. So anyway, so I go to the dentist, right? And I'm wearing them and I'm wearing them and I'm driving over, I'm wearing, I'm chewing on the stupid sponge to make sure the fucking trays all the way down and all of that shit. So I show up and he, you know, takes it, takes off. He's all, he's a good, oh man. Wow. You really would. You'd see when you comply, blah, blah, blah blah.

Speaker 1:          00:01:41       But these good, and I'm sitting there going, don't get excited. Don't cause he cause kid comes to however only I think we gave enough two fucking weeks. I was waiting for that shit. Right? But he doesn't, he goes, see these still good enough to take them off today. I was like, you've gotta be kidding me. I did it. Fucking did it. This is like going into the fucking Stanley Cup playoffs. All right. And just sweeping everybody. See you play like fucking, I dunno. Let's see if you went seven games times four, that's 12 above about 28 fucking games or you could just play 16. I felt like I just played 16 games. Fresh is a fucking daisy. I'm ready to go another round. You already handed me the trophy, right? So I said, all right. So he seats taking the fucking clips off or whatever. He's filing them down and shit. And he's like, uh, I go, okay, so an ally you have to do now is just where this tray at night when I sleep for the rest of my life so they don't go back, which is not picked deal. I'm asleep at the fuck. Do I care? All right. He goes, no, no. Uh, this final tray. You have to wear this for the next three months. And then we give to the overnight tray and it's just like,

Speaker 1:          00:02:55       and your initial pitch, I still would have fucking it, but why are you full? Just tear the bandaid off.

Speaker 2:          00:03:04       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:03:04       I could've just mentally got myself like go right the next six months of my life is going to suck. You got me all excited about 16 weeks and then 13 and then it's going to happen and then, oh by the way, by the way, here's another three months onto your sentence. She not out yet. Oh, fucking bug me. You know, cause you know what it was. Cause when he went initially went to sell it to me, he was too afraid that if he told me I was going to be six months that I wasn't going to do it. That's basically what it is that you know, I get it. Capitalism, it's sales. I really wanted to, I didn't say anything. I, you know, what are you going to eat in a day? I got fucking straight teeth and made it works. The shit definitely works. I am thrilled. I am elated with it. I just, you know what I mean? That's like something your wife does.

Speaker 2:          00:03:55       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:03:55       Built the team. Is there anything in the world, Bill, that you can't turn around and blame women for? All right, you're right. I'm being emotional. Being a cunt.

Speaker 2:          00:04:03       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:04:03       Fucking three more months. I turned 53 months. You know, you think I'm gonna have a fucking braces. I don't know about you, but that's not what I might, that's not one of my life's goals.

Speaker 2:          00:04:13       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:04:15       So anyways, so now what's going on is he took the fucking hooks off my tab. I'm just giving you guys the blow by blow. This guy's a great dentist. Okay. You know, could have been a little more straightforward about how long this was going to fucking take. You know, just dump the ball over. My head stopped like taking little spoonfuls and putting him out of his head. Okay. Can you handle that?

Speaker 2:          00:04:35       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:04:37       Anyways. Um,

Speaker 2:          00:04:41       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:04:41       I ain't know what the fuck does he know? Just so now the hooks are off these fucking things

Speaker 1:          00:04:48       and uh, this is like getting out of jail cause you just don't get out of jail. They go from maximum to like medium to minimum two. You're living in some guy's fucking house and you can go out and go get a fucking Bagel and you've got to come back and report to somebody. This is, this is how the Invisalign's going down. Um, I am in the, uh, the halfway house or the fucking minimum security building up this shit now, the three months, whatever. I don't even fucking notice him. I'm, I'm Kinda over it. I did have two event I did at the vent on it, on the podcast about it, but it's, it's just the fucking yellow. Just, just tell me what I'm in for so I can prepare for it. It's like one of those fucking movies where you sit in your God Damn cubicle at your desk and you finish your stack of papers. You're like, ah, and you fucking put your foot up on a desk. Guy Comes back with another stack of papers,

Speaker 2:          00:05:41       you know.

Speaker 1:          00:05:44       Anyways, anyways, um, oh, fucking, uh, Billy Boston Bruin bandwagon is jumping on. I've watched the last three games, to be honest. You, I, I missed, I turned on the last Bruins game or you know, I got a kid now, so I do what I can. All right. I put the game on when it was four to one. All right. I watched a beat the Black Hawks on Saturday. I watched them lose on Sunday and on, I put the game on, it was, they were down four to one. I was like, Jesus Christ, every time I fuck a week, they do nothing. But when, whenever I turned them on, they fucking loose. And um, so I got the game on. You don't medium volume. I'm in the kitchen with my beautiful daughter and I'm making her some dinner. I came in, what the hell? I made her. She likes these meatballs, right? With the vegetables and that type of stuff. And now what are we trying to keep her away from? Uh, you know, all the sugar in that type of shit. However, you know, occasionally, you know, my kid's not going to not have McDonald's. You know what I mean? I'm not going to take it to that level where the kid is like, oh, can I have some dessert and be like, yeah, here's a Kiwi or some shit like that. Even though you probably should do that. I don't know.

Speaker 2:          00:06:53       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:06:56       So anyways, I, I have the game I'm in, I'm out in the kitchen and then I just hear Jack Edwards going crazy.

Speaker 3:          00:07:01       Three goals. It's 77 seconds.

Speaker 1:          00:07:04       It's like come running in. Like what the, what the fuck just happened? Long Story Short, the Bruins scored, they scored five goals in the third period to win six to five. The last one was an empty net.

Speaker 2:          00:07:19       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:07:20       They scored him so fast. I don't even know who fucking scored him. I can't even remember who the hell scored them pasta knock out one of them. Uh, but I do know that we also, uh, lost like three guys got hurt during the game. Tory crew Debraski in fucking Zidane Know Ciara. But I, I looked at the replay because I missed those place. They didn't look a sitting on my couch and not having to do a Dur. The paint, they didn't look too bad. Um, charter went down like someone at a public skating rink is what that looked like. And then he just slid into the board. Looks like he hit his shoulder. He was walking off fine. You don't, when he was off the ice and he was going through the tunnel, he seemed all right. Granted he's also like nine feet tall and can do like over 40 pull ups, which makes no fucking sense at 40 41 years of age.

Speaker 1:          00:08:09       It's easy for the little guys because they don't have to travel as far. But to bring that giant body and all the way the fuck down, it's like, it's like the little guys going up like two, two steps and he's, he's got to run up like nine flights of stairs every time he does. It's, it's unreal. So he's tough as nails. I think we'll be back. I don't know what happened to Tory Craig and uh, the Brusk hopefully if I just, I dunno, got a mild sort of a bounce his brain around a little bit, but uh, anyways, what playing the Florida panthers tonight? Seven 30 my four 30 my time, seven 30 east coast time and the panthers fight the most, have the most fighting majors in the NHL this year. And it's like some pathetically low number. I think they were in the, they've had like 20 fighting majors.

Speaker 1:          00:08:55       They average of fight, like basically, you know, every three games. Um, it's just, it's just completely out of the fucking league and it sucks. But granted, I'm not the guy who I don't have to fight, right. I don't have to walk around dealing with the concussions and all of that shit. But, you know, just as a fan, I miss it. So they got them on, uh, they got them today, Thursday, and then Saturday when I'm up in, uh, Ontario, they got the lightening, so they got some big games coming up Monday. The blue jackets, I don't even know how they're do because I haven't been watching anything, but I'm back. I'm back on fucking bored here. A lot of new faces and shit. But, um, you know, like I said, I've watched so many games in the last 10 years, the 820 regular season games, I bet I saw at least, you know, 500 of them.

Speaker 1:          00:09:45       So I missed like the last fucking 60 that they had this year. Essentially. I only saw maybe five games this year. Uh, it's embarrassing, but, uh, which sucks because I watched them totally dismantled a team, you know, four years ago or something and go all the way back down to rebuilding. And I was like, I'm going to watch this whole rebuild. And this year when it all fucking came together, um, I mean, what am I complaining about? Oh, I had to go and become a dad, which is the most amazing fucking thing ever. Um, my little one's starting to try to run now, which is hilarious. Um, and also we've been doing this thing where, uh, when she's done with the toy and then she wants to play with something else, she has to put away the other toy and she just has it down. She likes it cause we applaud every time she puts some way.

Speaker 1:          00:10:33       She's playing with these giant Lego's today and we, and she wanted that. She wanted to have this bag of like, uh, you know, multicolored fucking little like a, they almost look like ping pong balls, right? She wants to go play with those fucking things. So it's just like, all right, well you got to put away the Lego blocks first. So she starts putting away and I'm applauding on everyone that she does and then there's two stuck together and she fucking, she pulled them apart before she put him away. And as a parent right there, you're like, oh my God, my kid is a genius. You know, like, like you have Einstein as a kid rather than, it was a, uh, a pretty logical step that they would just able to make, but it's still thrilling. Everything is fucking thrilling. So anyways, um, this morning I go outside, right?

Speaker 1:          00:11:15       I play a little game on Thursday when the trash comes out. Um, is, I'm always listening for the garbage truck. All right. Because, um, now that I don't have a dog, I mean, I still do. It's still technically my dog and she's in town this week and I've been taking her on these long hikes every day. It's been awesome. She looks great, she just looks great and she's so freaking happy. And I told you for the first time in her life, she has another dog that she's friends with, which she never did. You know, she was never in that mindset when someone with my limited skill set had her, she tried to do you do, she usually ignored bigger dogs and then little dogs.

Speaker 2:          00:11:58       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:11:58       No little dogs would bark at her and she would ignore them. And then bigger dogs, she would also ignore them until they started some shit, you know?

Speaker 2:          00:12:06       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:12:06       I believe in the hip hop community that's known as, uh, don't start. Nothing, won't be nothing. I believe that that's where my dog, her mindset was from. So anyways, but I always fucking hated is when the trash is out the barrels, once they empty the fucking shit that the trash truck comes by the garbage truck, if you will empties the fucking thing out. You have basically about a minute when you live in loss of Congolese before some fucking dog on and can't comes by and takes a shit bag and throws in deer, you're, uh, you're trashed route, which I don't necessarily give a shit this time of year because it's cold out. But during the hot months, you know, to have some stamen bag of fucking Shit marinating and your thing that's not even from your own dog, it's so, it's a little annoying. I appreciate it. You keeping the city fucking clean.

Speaker 1:          00:12:59       But there is something about that that it's just the, it's a little fucking annoying. So this morning I, I've been hearing phantom garbage trucks had been out there like nine times. I only put away the recycling and, uh, I got a feeling while I'm doing the podcast, I'm going to hear this fucking thing coming up the street and I'm gonna tell you right now, if I do, I'm, I'm throwing down the mic. I'm going to go out there and get in and put that thing back inside. But, um, I got a bunch of shit that I got handled. I am back on Instagram. Everybody. I got to get the check next to my fucking name so it's verified cause I guess there's some people impersonating me, which is really flattering. Um, uh, have not been on there since 2012. Instagram was not something that I gravitated towards, but everybody keeps telling me, you gotta get on it. You got to get on it. And I was sick of fighting the youth there and a, so I'm going to get back on it, I guess. Um, it's been six years since I'd done away. Okay. It feels like I've had Invisalign on for fucking 12 years at this point now. It hasn't been that bad. He says he had been that bad. It's just that I got fucking excited that it was over.

Speaker 2:          00:14:08       Okay,

Speaker 1:          00:14:09       honey, we done, I'm gonna blame women again and we'd done this is it, this is the last store and then it, oh,

Speaker 2:          00:14:14       one claim to want to look at some cosmetics.

Speaker 1:          00:14:18       Asshole. Here's a question. Why don't they have bars at malls? You know, I guess I do the kind of like sports bars and shit.

Speaker 2:          00:14:28       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:14:29       I'm going to go into, hey, what are you going to? How do you take all the time you need? I'm going to go in here and get fucking loaded. Okay. I will. I will do my best to help you with the bags of shit that you don't need, that you get. You're going to be carrying out and then you're driving home. How does that sound? Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:14:44       Well, I wanted to this ticket.

Speaker 1:          00:14:48       That's the thing. This is so good. What's the exact thing that makes them a

Speaker 4:          00:14:51       great mother? Makes them an annoying partner. It's just like, just go do something by yourself. Stop dragging me. Why am I being such a jerk? Because of my fucking Invisalign. I like hanging out with my wife and I had mentioned before when I didn't have the hope that my Invisalign was being taken off, that I actually enjoy going to the mall with my wife and kid there. I said it.

Speaker 2:          00:15:14       Uh, all right.

Speaker 4:          00:15:18       Anyways, I'm starting to understand tea by the way.

Speaker 2:          00:15:21       Yeah,

Speaker 4:          00:15:21       okay. I never understood it. It's like it's hot as fuck. It Burns your tongue. This isn't relaxing. It's like, no stupid. It's hot as fuck. So it activates what's ever in the tea bag. And then once that's done, you then take the fucking teabag out and you throw it out like an Englishman. All right? You don't keep it. If you don't leave it in there, like from sloppy American like me, you take that out and you let it fucking cooled down. Now that everything's been accurate, activate and then you drink it. But the problem is is you've just ordered a tea. That's fine. But if he got something else coming, by the time the fucking thing cools down, you're, you're, you're, you're a little Danish or whatever the hell you ordered is already there. Your crumpet, what the fuck is a crumpet? Is that a biscuit and biscuits? A cookie over there, right?

Speaker 2:          00:16:07       Crump.

Speaker 4:          00:16:08       Oh, it's what the C strumpet crop it. Oh, it's an English muffin.

Speaker 4:          00:16:21       Uh, fuck out of you. That's all it is. Teen crop it. I never, you know, it's funny cause you know what I mean. I, I've been saying that I had no idea it was always picked a little fucking round, like Pale looking rich crack. How to make crumpets BBC good food. [inaudible] it would have been like a good crop, but with their fucking, you know, nobody a fucking crumpet with this shit. Right. That's just something, by the way, has there ever not been an upbeat chef and they always play like that? Everything's going to be okay. Music, you know, flour, salt and sugar. Some Oregano, some tomatoes.

Speaker 4:          00:17:05       Okay. Stirring it all the time. He put it, I could do this shit. I didn't know I could make my own English muffins. Okay. Is this like Philly cheese steak where you don't say Philly cheese steak? When you just say cheese steak, when you're in England, you don't say English muffin. You don't even say muffin. You say crumpet Oh God, this woman is either terrible or unbelievable in bed. I don't know why. I just thought that, oh, she's, she's into the culinary arts. You know, she figured, you know, she's in touch with something. Who knows? You know, sometimes people, they exact given one talent. Sometimes it just, it's an, it's an overall philosophy that goes through. Um, all right. Let me read

Speaker 1:          00:17:49       a little bit of advertising here. Uh, then I'll talk about my pathetic attempts to try to fucking learn this song for the Goddamn comedy jam. It has double bass in it and uh, I haven't even really been noticing, but like, um, I'm left handed and I'm right handed at the same time and that's fucking with my double bass playing because sometimes they have a tendency to lead with my left foot. Other Times I have a tendency to lead with my right foot. You know, like if you're going to do like a, uh, like those separate the bat, right, whatever that is a fucking triplet right before the snare hit where it's going to be like right left, right or left, right, left. I always go left right, left. I kind of feel like it's, it's like if it's on the offbeat or something like that, if it's on, you know, if it's on one and two and three and four and that should be right foot.

Speaker 1:          00:18:46       And if it's on the other ones, I'm going left foot. Right. I don't know. I have no idea. But all I know was I'm trying to learn this fucking song and the crashes on the offbeat. And I do that with my right foot. And then I think what I was doing, I was, when I was playing it up to speed and I was just having fun and I didn't think anybody was, I was actually going to play it in front of people and they were going to watch me. I think I was actually playing left foot lead. But then when I sat down and broke it down, I flipped it and I went from being able to play it to up to tempo to drop in like 30 bpm. And I'm like, what the fuck is going on? And I have to have this song down in like a week or so.

Speaker 1:          00:19:32       So, um, but I got the drum room now, so I've just been, uh, you know, something I learned from, uh, Mike Johnston lessons, which was a rather than practicing at your limit to go down 10, 15, even 20 bpms and just stay there for like 10 minutes of really focused fucking practice. Now I'm combining everything shifted. Davey Lynch taught me. I just kind of combined everything that makes sense. And I've been able to start, you know, going back up again and uh, I get to tell you, I don't know why the fuck I avoided double bass drum and for so fucking long it's, it's awesome. It's incredible. And then all of this shit that I always loved but wouldn't even attempt to play along to prime is, uh, Pantera. All those p bands that I love. Um, all of a sudden it's just like, oh, I kind of understand what's happening right here. I mean, I can't play it up to speed, but it gives me somewhere to go. And I remember I listened to a, one of those lamb of God alums back in the day and I was really fascinated with a lot of the, the, the drum beats that I was at, Chris Adler came up and um, I dunno, it's like a, it's like anything, it's, it's all of a sudden there's all this new shit that you don't know you're excited to sit down and eat if it's like he kind of

Speaker 2:          00:20:59       okay,

Speaker 1:          00:20:59       learned what you know. And then you just sort of sitting there, you actually get, it's fucking weird. You get like board, um, and then you don't have any passion and then you are already playing. It's Shitty. And then you're going to play it even fucking worse. So, uh, very excited about that. Um, and to finally have a fucking drum room, I got to tell you, I was up there fucking Waylon yesterday. Not Saying I was playing well I was, but I was hitting them is fucking hard. Is that going to have us having a great pouring sweat? Just, it's like, it's fucking amazing. Can you played double bass? All of a sudden it's like, I don't think I need to do the elliptical today. Uh, that probably means my techniques sucks. But that's the level of effort that I was exerting. Yeah. So, um, what's great though is darn if I play during the day, my name was

Speaker 2:          00:21:48       okay

Speaker 1:          00:21:49       are at work and there's always somebody with the leaf blower or a fucking lawnmower playing. So I don't think anybody's really going to hear me. And I think it just, every day, it's just middle of the day. I play for like 90 fucking minutes. I can have a great time, not piss anybody off. And um, I don't know. And I, I think, I think the dream has come true. I'll tell you another fucking dream. It would be if my Goddamn fucking computer. Come on man. Come back. Come back. What is the problem? Where did you go? What happened? I need to read advertising. All right. All you computer nerds out there for some reason. Hey there. Oh, now it came back when to like screensaver mode and we wouldn't come back. I don't know why it just, it cause I just wrapped it on the head like when fucking Mel Howard would try to get fucking Larry's attention here. Look, can I get you can't just read the, the uh, the advertising here. I'm all over the place. What did I do with it? Yeah. Jesus Christ belt.

Speaker 2:          00:22:57       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:22:57       Do you see Trump just admitted that he just completely made something up? This guy like, sounds like me. You're talking about how he said that, you know, basically we had a trade deficit with Canada, which I guess was not true. This is when he was trying to attack Nafta, saying, this is the worst deal we ever signed. And evidently, according to this site, the Washington Post, I don't know if this psychotically liberals, so they're just snipping this, I'm sure all you people on the right one, it was the complete opposite. It was Obama's fault. Um, he said, despite having no idea whether that was the case, he said, the man who racked up more than 2000 false and misleading claims, as president said, he insisted in to Canadian prime as well. I mean, I'm sure both sides would debate that number. You know, one side says 2000.

Speaker 1:          00:23:46       The other says three, uh, as president, he insisted to Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau that the United States runs a trade deficit with Canada's despite quote having no idea whether that was the case. Um, he said, I said wrong, Justin, you do. I didn't even know Trump said, I had no idea. I just said, you're wrong. You know why? Because we're so stupid. That's where that guy is out of his fucking mind. And I know people like this. They're just not present in United States. He's admitting that he did something wrong and then when he says why he did it, he then includes how dumb I am. It's just like, dude, I didn't say this shit you did. I'm not saying I'm not dumb. That's like, you know, I've seen some, I saw this guy get in trouble one time and he was just going like, yeah, you know when you fuck up, you know,

Speaker 2:          00:24:42       okay,

Speaker 1:          00:24:42       you have to uh, you have to come clean and own up to it. It's like, it also, why are you talking to me about it? I didn't do it. You did it. I fucked up. I need to come clean. And he was speaking almost in like a third person type of fuck it. That's hilarious.

Speaker 2:          00:25:01       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:25:01       That takes me back to that fucking tee shirt. Enough was enough talking about enough already talking about paid women less than guys. It's like fuck head. You're a corporation. You are the one doing it, not me. Now you going to act like he never did it and profit off. What the fuck he did wrong. It's John Wayne Gacy having a fucking shirt, uh, you know, leave the kids alone enough already. Right. Um, and then he makes money off of it, which she then uses to pay a lawyer and he gets out of jail before they kill him.

Speaker 2:          00:25:35       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:25:36       So anyways, uh, you know why? Because we're so stupid.

Speaker 2:          00:25:41       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:25:42       I would have respected him more if he just said, you know why? Because the American average American is so fucking stupid date. All you have to do is to say some shit. And if you're wearing the right colored tie, they're going to believe it. They're not going to research. He said that. Then I'd be like, yeah, I totally agree with that. And that also includes people that are root for blue ties. Okay. And that also includes people in England and Canada. Everybody know nobody's fucking paying attention. There's very few people that pay attention to the level dead. Like these talking heads on TV who only argue one side. And the fact that you're only arguing one side, then at that point, I dunno. How do you listen to them? That's why I like Jimmy Dore.

Speaker 2:          00:26:24       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:26:24       I like Jimmy Dore because Jimmy Dore also leans left, but he also trashes the shit out of fucking Obama and calls him out on what a fucking company, man he was. That guy left the office, he was worth over 80 million bucks making 500 grand a year. And everybody's looking at him like he's fucking Gandhi. It's just like, don't he see exact same fucking not the exact same, but essentially it's the same thing. He's doing the same thing that the guy before that had the red tie. The guy before they had the blue tie and every eight years were like, it's the fucking blue ties. We need a Red Dye. Um, what you really need is you need a revolution is what you need. You need a revolution, and you would have to literally kill the super rich if you're ever going to change. And who's Kidding Hill? You know that.

Speaker 1:          00:27:09       That's not gonna happen anymore. I spend, that's why they're building these robots. Everybody know these, these robot. Oh God. Bill, you're going off the deep end. Yes, I, yeah, they're building these fucking robots. That's what the fuck. It's four. It's going to eliminate the ability to ever a revolt. Because here's the thing, let's just say they turn this, this country ever into a police state. The people that make up our armed services services, the Bray a Webinar Omega by rob services, they are all Americans. And to have them turn their guns on their own countrymen will be very difficult. They would almost have to go into a robot like mind state. Um, let me see what I did there. See what I did. She had it all fucking hands high right now when you talk to yourself into a microphone and there's nobody to debate or check fact check anything you're saying, you always stick the landing.

Speaker 1:          00:27:57       You always get always standing there, you know, fucking with the gold medal around your neck as they play the national anthem. Uh, you all right? I fucking a Gri were barely bar. He made some great points. That's because no one was able to interrupt, hoard, tell him he doesn't know what he's talking about. Um, all right, well the fuck is my, uh, I'm figuring out all my passwords. I'm really turning a new corner here. I figured out, finally figured out how to upload something properly on a Dropbox without yelling at it. I actually just sat down and figured it out yesterday. I flipped out and I fucking slammed my computer down that because both my wife and my daughter to jump. And I was just like, what am I doing? What am I doing? I walked downstairs and came back up, you know, cooled off, came up.

Speaker 1:          00:28:46       I apologize to him both. You know, this is, this is what I'm doing right now where I'm like the passing the baton of anger in my family tree. Okay. If I continue to tradition, I just would have done that. I would've blamed everybody in the room and never apologize. But now I walk away and um, and I come back a few minutes later, I apologize and I give her a hug, a kiss in the room. That's what I do. Okay. So, you know, I'm not saying I'm not still fucked up. I'm not saying people aren't suffering being around me. I'm just, I'm just saying that I am trying. Uh, all right, let me, uh, Sun basket everybody.

I have no idea. All right, have a great weekend. You Con Bruins verse the Florida Panthers Tonight. Maybe there'll be some fights. And, um, this weekend I'm going to be up and outside of a, I'm in Landcaster, Ontario with Joe Barton, nick the Rosebowl tailgate legend Joe Barden, Nick and Paul Vert, Paul. I know everything that happens in aviation. Versie in other words, anytime there's a crash, he reads up on, by the way, man. Um, that was a horrific helicopter crash in, uh, in New York City. Of course, I've been paying attention to that. And uh, this quick footage of the guy landing the helicopter and he looks like he totally, he totally fucking nailed it. Um, the landing wasn't hard at all and he got out and nobody else did.

Speaker 1:          00:33:46       And I think from what I'm hearing in her circles is a, they were flying with doors off. So, not only did they have the seat belts, which are, I think they're the, the the four ones that connect with the circle in the middle, which you also, you had to turn it like clockwise or counterclockwise cause I was thinking that they panicked and didn't know how to, you know, the once they land like, fuck, I'm in a helicopter crash and then all fuck, I don't want to drown in. Like I remember I went skydiving and um, I did a static line jumps. So there was nobody attached to me. And um, I remember it was awkward towels and thousand two, 1003 1000, 4,000 look, if nothing, look reached pulse. So when you pulled your emergency ripcord you had to talk your way through it, look to see it reached, to grab it, pull to pull the thing.

Speaker 1:          00:34:32       Cause other than you'd be panicking and flailing starting to do somersaults and shit. So I thought maybe that was it. But, um, someone was saying to me that they were possibly flying doors off and as an extra safety precaution, they had them hooked to the helicopter with one of those c clamp type of job. He's there and there's two different kinds. There's the one that's the quick release, um, and then as the extra extra one that you, you screw on. Um, and uh, they were suggesting that it was probably that one and that even if they got this seat belts on that they were, uh, I dunno, basically strapped to the helicopter and went down and drowned. I have no idea of how fucking horrific is that. Why would I end the podcast on that? I have no idea. I have no fucking evidence. That's just what's been suggested to me. So anyways, on that upbeat note, Ah, listen to, uh, some happy music now and then we'll go into some greatest hits. I don't know why I talked to, you know, why cause I in that made me scared. Yeah, maybe happy to see that the guy fucking totally landed at like a stud. And then if what is being suggested happened actually happened, I would can't imagine the pilot, you know, having to deal with those five fucking people. You know, they're going to try to fucking blame him.

Speaker 1:          00:36:01       It, cause it seems like that's one of those things where they made it so safe that they didn't, they created another fucking problem, which means they'll probably then have some sort of new clamp that they design. I don't fucking know. Anyways. Uh, how do I talk my way out of this? I have no idea. I'm sitting here, uh, just flailing. All right. Listen to the fucking music and have a great weekend. You conch and there'll be another half hour greatest hits where hopefully I don't

Speaker 2:          00:36:26       and that's such a gloomy. Nope. Wow.

Speaker 4:          00:37:49       Hey, what's going on? It's bill burr and it is the Monday morning podcast for Monday, March 16th, 2010. How the hell are you? How's it going? It's a daylight savings time if you haven't figured it out yet. If you're wondering why you keep being late for the last 24 hours. It's actually Sunday when I'm doing this thing because, uh, you know, I get sick of people on the east coast bitching dude, you should call it [inaudible] to move fucking Monday afternoon podcast. Should I um, I respect that you want to get to work? Do you want to begin fucking off immediately start your week off, right. I understand. So I tape them on Sundays now when I can and uh, hope you guys all had a good weekend. My Sunday started great. My dog puked on the floor after, you know, three days of threatening dry heaves and every time we go out, walk up the street, the things eating grass like it's a goddamn cow.

Speaker 4:          00:38:46       And my girls always going, stop it. Stop it. Stop eating the grass, stamp it. And uh, I vaguely remember overhearing someone who I hope new, a veterinarian who said something to the effect that a animals eat grass when they're not feeling well. So last night I was taking her out late at night, right at that, that critical fucking moment to scary moment. My neighborhood. All right. There's a moment where, uh, you know, when you're in a bad part of the city and uh, there's that moment around dusk where all the decent, hardworking, honest people are coming in after a nice decent, honest, hardworking days pay, you know, is they try to get out kind of like a good times episode, you know, and then there's, there's that point where then the scumbags come out, you know, who are doing all kinds of illegal shit, which I don't even know what the fuck to even think about that anymore.

Speaker 4:          00:39:43       Now it's just as fucked up. I was going to say, you know, it was fucking crooked is he's God damn banks are, you know, is selling drugs. Yes it is. It is just as fucking bad. So anyways, just stay on. I'm already off fucking track. You know what my fucking bank did to me. I walked in, I had this account in New York that I kind of a, it was a little checking account that had a little bit of money in and all of a sudden I noticed they would taking some fees out. I'm like, well, that shouldn't be. So I get to New York, I walk in, I talked to the Douche bag who works there and he goes, yeah, they're taking $27 a month out. I Dunno why that is. Here, let me check to see what's up. Click and collect. I'll check on his thing.

Speaker 4:          00:40:20       And he goes, yeah, we shouldn't have been doing that. And I go, okay, well can you refund the money? And they go, absolutely. A, and I go, well, well you know, I've had the account for like six years. Can we see how long you've been doing this? And he's like, oh, I'm sorry. Are Our records only go back for four months? Um, really it only goes back for four months. It's amazing because my bank records at home go back the entire time I've had the account. That's incredible. And I just have some piddly summon there while you deal with hundreds of millions of dollars, if not billions, if not trillions. I don't know what the fuck you have. I just know there's a fucking Bank of yours in every God damn state now. But of course it only goes back like four months. So I go, all right, well what if I bring my records in?

Speaker 4:          00:41:04       I look them over and I find out how long you've been doing it. And they're like, Nah, he can only refund it for four months. I'm like, dude, what are you talking about? And he goes, well, the bank kind of looks at it like that, that that was on you. And I was like, it's on me to not to not be like paying attention to make sure the people who supposed to be keeping my money safe aren't fucking stealing from me. And he sort of like laughed. I'm like, dude, this isn't funny. This is ridiculous. You guys just from me. And if you've been doing it for six years, what's that? 270 bucks? Add another fucking Nav. 50 like almost 300 bucks a year for six years. That's like 1500 to 1800 bucks somewhere in there.

Speaker 4:          00:41:47       And the guy's just sitting there fucking laughing and uh, you know, this is a usual shit guy. What are you gonna Sue us? Go ahead. We'll take some of that bailout money, which is part of your tax money and we'll fucking, uh, so I don't know what I'm going to do. I'm going to close out the account and uh, and I don't know. What do I do then I go across the street to one of the bat for banks that are left. If anybody out there is in banking, how do I get my money back beyond the four months? Cause I know that they've been doing it longer than this. Um, can anybody explain that? You know, this is why people, this is why you don't put 100% of your paycheck into the fucking bag. He got to look at it this way. If somebody mugged you last week, would you walk up to the same person and take your paycheck and stick it in their back pockets?

Speaker 4:          00:42:31       You wouldn't, would you? But for some reason we have these fucking bankers. Yeah. I don't know. I think everybody should turn like, I dunno, everybody should have a fucking safe that you have buried somewhere. Yeah, everybody's got a gun in. Anybody can blow anybody away. I know. It's all fucked up. Fucking assholes. You guys sitting there fucking smiling. Nobody sitting there doing, he's doing that little twirly thing. You know that math people do with their pens and people were into finances. I think they do it to hypnotize you and says, the guy's fucking sitting there telling me that they'd been stealing 30 bucks a month from me and all I'm doing is I'm trying to focus on him. I keep looking down at his silver shiny pen, some sort of mind trick. Fortunately, I was aware of it. How am I said, can you stop twirling your fucking pen? But I didn't want to do that cause I was trying to keep my cool, which obviously is a difficult thing for me to do. You know? I don't know right now a pill. It's just 27 bucks a month times how many fucking people you remember superman three when Richard Pryor stole half a cent from everybody and the next day he had a fucking Ferrari. He's Fox had taken 27 bucks a month from everybody. I'm convinced of it.

Speaker 4:          00:43:44       That's the fucking mob. I swear to God the mob went legit or those there will be blood guys. They're the fucking assholes and run the Goddamn bags. He's fucking constant just stealing from me and there's nobody getting, nobody's going to help me. What am I going to go down there? I'm going to get that guy used to be on the fucking, uh, leave it to beaver. What the fuck was the name of that show? A Mayberry. I always hated that show, that old content walking around with their false set of voice earned. You know, you know what that show lacked somebody that I wanted to bang.

Speaker 4:          00:44:18       That's why I didn't watch it. There was nobody fuckable on it. That was the brilliance of the monsters that they were like, this is going to be hilarious. We're gonna turn fucking Frankenstein into DRAC and Dracula into these Kooky characters and it's all going to be funny. But they knew at the end of the day they had to be somebody that the male demographic would want to fuck. So they came up with that girl who was allegedly ugly. Why am I explaining this classic show? You know the deal and she looked like Marilyn Monroe and that's what kept me in there. I Dunno. All right. Batman after a while it's like to what is going on with this 40 year old guy in his ward?

Speaker 2:          00:45:01       Okay.

Speaker 4:          00:45:01       And then all of a sudden they had cat woman walking around that fucking hoary outfit. Is she the one who started that shit? Did women not dress like horrors on uh, on Halloween before Batman are a bad girl or cat woman? Catwoman was a bad one, right?

Speaker 2:          00:45:21       Okay.

Speaker 4:          00:45:22       This such pathetic cons, you know what I mean? It's, we take off that fucking ridiculous outfit.

Speaker 4:          00:45:28       Go stand behind a wall and, and, and start talking to people in the store. How many people even fucking pay attention to you? They don't cause you got nothing to say. All you can do is just dress up your God damn Twat and starts strutting around the fucking place. That had nothing to do with Catwoman. Had nothing to do with her. I had to do with me fucking getting fucked over by that God damn bag, assholes, fucking assholes. And I go to down there, I got to go down and I like to like some fucking guy who's buttoned store just failed after 75 years, you know, Frankie fish face and sons remember those fucking um, those businesses when you were a kid.

Speaker 2:          00:46:09       Okay.

Speaker 4:          00:46:09       It was always something something and sons.

Speaker 2:          00:46:12       Yeah.

Speaker 4:          00:46:13       You know, and like a lot of the times the kids were forced into the business.

Speaker 2:          00:46:17       Okay.

Speaker 4:          00:46:17       Yeah. I'm Italian guy. He opens a fucking prosciutto shop and then that's it. It's like an arranged marriage except that your job and then you got to show up. I have been working in the restaurants and that was the day that, you know, they don't know shit about anything else. Does. Everybody wanted to strike out on their own and now look, everybody ends up in a fucking cubicle worker for these fucking cunts was stealing my money. That's uplifting isn't it? Um, anyways, this is the Monday morning podcast and it's on my website. I'm trying to get it onto iTunes. I'm in between web guys right now. Hopefully this is up on iTunes. We worked on it yesterday. Um, you know, and it was weird. It was up on my web guys computer but it wasn't up on my computer. So if you're listening to this on my website, maybe you go to iTunes and you just hold down the shift button. I mean maybe iTunes just keeps reloading a, you know how it, it remembers a page that you've been to. So when you go back to it a load quicker, hold down the shift button. When you're on that page, um, I believe that then you can see the new one. So now I have three podcasts.

Speaker 2:          00:47:22       Okay.

Speaker 4:          00:47:23       Fucking ridiculous. But eventually we're going to get it all under one. This is the first time I've ever had a web guy who lives down the street from me. Um, I have new video up on my website and buy new video. I mean video that actually works. And um, this is part of a whole new revamping that I've tried to do like 10 times. I know I've always promised that, but, um, I'm going to be uploading video to my website and to start video my video taping myself out on the road, putting up little bullshit things up there. You know, the usual bullshit. Give you guys a couple of crumbs every week. So you still give a fuck about me. So when I come to your town, maybe you'll buy a ticket for you and your best little girl or fucking boyfriend, whatever you got going on out there, whatever it is that you do.

Speaker 4:          00:48:08       Um, there's also a fan page for the Monday morning podcast. Now, uh, www.themmpodcast.com. Uh, there's questions, there's pictures. I make references to fucked up stuff. Like say you haven't watched the Munsters, maybe there'll be a picture of the hottie on the monsters, you know, so, uh, and that's it. My girlfriend just walked in and then tippy toed back out again and then shrugged his shoulders like I wasn't going to address it. You heard me, I was in a lull. So anyways, I really apologize for the horror that has been trying to find my podcast over the last month or so. Um, I didn't think that it was going to be such a big deal, you know. Uh, I, I just thought I could just switch over to a new server server and it wasn't going to be a problem, but evidently it's this major fucking deal. And I've talked to other podcasters out there and they were talking about what a fucking pain in the ass it is to get it up on iTunes because once you do get it up on iTunes, then they have to approve of it as if to say yes, this is in fact a podcast and beyond that we approve of it.

Speaker 4:          00:49:21       So anyways, Jesus Christ, it's already one in the afternoon. I just went out to brunch with my lovely girlfriend and I heard some fucking, oh my God, that goes back to my joke. You really go to a branch to, did somebody have pes? Um, yeah. Went down to this fucking place and we're hanging out down there and uh, this fucking dude, um, I don't know if he was gay, but he had the gay accent, which is always fun to me. Like there's a part of the country that they're from, which is an old joke that I used to do. Um, he was talking about daylight savings times. He was just like, oh my God. Like this is how it should be all the time. You know, it's like, this is Los Angeles, this whole getting out of work at five and it's dark out. It's just like, what is going on with that?

Speaker 4:          00:50:09       That's like one of those things ever. Just hear somebody like that. There's like such a fucking cliche that whoever you're with, you just, you're just sort of staring down at your food. And then when you look at the person that you're with, you don't move your head. You just slowly look up at each other and then all of a sudden it's like you're in grade school again. And there was a teacher said, the next person who fucking laughs is getting detention. It's one of those moments. It was tight quarters so we couldn't like really start laughing at them. But, um, I really wanted to lean over and be like, you know, part of the reason why it's so fucking dark out during the wintertime is the whole planet, the northern hemisphere tilts away from the sun there. Fuck face. All right, so even in December, it would probably.be dark around five. Despite the time change. Actually maybe it would maybe more like five 45 30, depending on where you're at. Right. I mean, am I ignorant? Of course I am, but as far as I know, daylight savings is the bullshit time. Like right now it's not really one o'clock. We're just saying it's one o'clock. So the farm hands out in the Midwest can have more fucking time to harvest the, uh, the beans made out of corn products according to Food Inc. Right.

Speaker 4:          00:51:22       I don't fucking know. I have no idea what they do and I just fucking, why do I have to, I, every week I talk about shit that I don't know anything about it. It's the funniest shit. Like I, I go into it, I start getting anxiety cause I know I don't know what I'm talking about. So why would I literally try to do is I try to use like momentum. Like maybe if I say something dumb quickly, no one's gonna notice. I believe that that's exactly what it is in my world. That made sense. So on to today's topics, I was all excited to wake up this morning and watch the Chicago Blackhawks against the Washington capitals. Why may you ask? I'll tell you why. Because I love the sport of hockey and a, it's a good chance that those two teams could possibly meet in the finals, if not in the finals next year.

Speaker 4:          00:52:07       The two teams that are right there. All right? And everybody always bitches out of hockey sticks and they always blame the fighting. They got to get the fighting out of the fucking game. All right? That's why nobody watches it. Well, I'm going to give you an example of the NHL here. This is what they do today. Okay? During the week, my Bruins played the Pittsburgh penguins and a overall, Pittsburgh's a decent franchise for respectable. I respect them, but they always didn't seem to have one douche bag on the team. The off Samuelson, you know the guy who just can't fucking play, you know, he can't play, he can't fucking fight. He can't even just skate around and annoy you like a Ken Lindeman back in the day. So what he does is he goes out there and he basically tries to end people's careers or their seasons and that's what he did to mark Savara.

Speaker 4:          00:52:55       I even know the fucking guys name and I don't even want to know his name. Kind of like somebody goes up and shoots up a fucking mall so they can get famous. I always make sure I don't remember the fucking name, even though the news can't stop talking about him. So this fucking cunt just basically glides in after survivor took shot. Granted if he hit his body, it was a legal hit, but he didn't, he took, he took his shoulder slash elbow and just blasted him right in the fucking head. And he's so only connected with his head that Savara literally helicoptered around and landed down on the ice. And not only was he not suspended or fine, there wasn't even a penalty. I Dunno what it is about the penguins. For some reason, they always have that one goon who can go in and just blow out Cam Neeley's fucking knee. And then his career, that guy just ended Savardi fucking season or one goal scorer and they then they do nothing.

Speaker 1:          00:53:49       Told the whole hockey world is flipping out like, dude, what the fuck? So what do they do to make it up today? Washington capitals versus the Chicago Blackhawks there. One nationally televised game this week on NBC. You can actually watch it in HD TV. So while you fucking idiots out there who can't see the Puck, I can't fear where is it? I can't see it. Fucking black. Object against the white surface. Can't fucking see it. Why don't you start with looking at the guy that everybody appears to be mad at on the other team? You know, start with that guy. Maybe that's the guy who has the object that they desire. So anyways, you know what they do? They ended up kicking fucking Ovechkin. They gave him a game misconduct out of the game because he did some halfway. I mean, it was a check that deserved a penalty possibly of fucking double minor, and they kicked the best player in the league out of the fucking game on their national telecast. And I'm a tell you right now.

Speaker 4:          00:54:45       Well that is why that is why nobody watches hockey, because they continually make moves like that. I don't know why. Every five years they get back on ESPN and then they go, oh, wait a minute, the USA network is offering us $5 more, or let's go over there. Let's go over to the versus

Speaker 1:          00:55:03       network. How many people you think would be watching the NFL if throughout the years they, you know, they occasionally for three years would disappear onto like the learning channel.

Speaker 4:          00:55:14       You know what I mean? It really has nothing to do with the fighting. It's such a stupid fucking comment that people make and it's hypocritical. If you truly feel that that fighting should be out of that game as much as the whole world enjoys violence. We love violence. Go on Youtube and look at the fucking ones that get the most hits. We like to laugh and we'd like to watch somebody get fucked up. That's what I've learned from going onto youtube. Oh. And people or we'll find a way to uh, talk politics or discuss race on any video that you stick up there. And speaking of that, um, dude, I was so fucking bummed out. I woke up an hour late so I missed the first period and then I find out a vet can isn't even fucking plague and it was laying down. And next thing you know, they Chicago scores, it's three nothing.

Speaker 4:          00:55:59       And the game is basically over for the, or for those of you who don't watch hockey three, nothing is basically, uh, I would, it's like being down 17 points and football. Yeah, sometimes 21, depending on how bad your fucking team is. So, um, I was upset as a hockey fan. I still love the Nhl and I still think you guys should watch the game. I was actually watching a little bit of the Premier League because I'm going to Europe this week and uh, the excitement of that has finally hit me. I'm not excited about the 17 hour or whatever it is, 15 hour flight from Los Angeles. But um, I'm beyond excited to go over there and have killer shows and to begin to build a following over there because a cause why not? Because you only go around once. I was going to get a tour of the fucking Abbey road studios and that fell through.

Speaker 4:          00:56:49       So now I don't know what to do. I don't know what to do over there. And for those of you who haven't been on my website this week, on Thursday, I am playing at the Lester theatre in London, England. How fucking cool does that sound? Then I'm playing the sugar club in uh, in uh, Dublin Ireland on Friday. And then the next night I go to Glasgow, Scotland. A lot of you Americans like me, you are going to want to say glass. Gow cause it looks like it's written like slow, you know, low. But it's Gow glass cow, uh, Scotland. And I actually don't even know the fucking name of the theater I'm playing there, but uh, it's gonna be awesome and I am coming off the wagon. My Good Buddy Joe to Rosa went 70 days sober, so I had to beat him because I'm a competitive fuck and I was going to take myself off last night.

Speaker 4:          00:57:43       It's 71 days, you know, kind of like a nod to Roger Maris 60 home runs 61 70 71. But I decided fuck it. You know, if I'm going to fall off the fucking wagon, it's going to be in a pub in a London, England. That's when I'm going to do it. So I need you English people to tell me where there's a good pup and by a good pub. I don't meet some loud fucking bar with a bunch of douchebags in it, trying to act like they're cooler than they really are. I want some fucking, I want some place I could walk in that's a little bit quieter but I'm not going to get the shit kicked out of me once they realize I'm an American. Okay, I need to know that. I also need to know if I bring DVDs over there to sell to you guys for pounds, euros, whatever the fuck you're on.

Speaker 4:          00:58:25       I believe you guys, you guys haven't accepted the euro, but I think Ireland has, um, I need to know the DVDs, play the American code version, whatever the fucking technical term is. Do those things play over there? Are they formatted correctly? Cause I don't want to go over there and sell you guys a bunch of shit that doesn't work. And then we got to, you know, then I'm like a bank and then I got to be like, well you know that's really on you get home. She should have realized that I was from America and uh, I have a different fucking DVD system than you do. So there you go. My, sorry, my records only go back four minutes. I really don't have any recollection of going over there. So anyways, I don't know what else to do over there. John Bonham's grave, you know, maybe I'll go see that.

Speaker 4:          00:59:09       Um, what else could I do? I don't want to go do that Douchey Shit. Guy Glow Look Big Ben and parliament. I don't wanna I don't wanna look at that stuff. I want to, uh, I don't want, I want to do, I want to walk around and want to look at Sim. Who is, I want to do what? People in London, England. Dope that right. That's what I want to do. Which is what? Eat Indian food right after a plate full of fish and chips. Um, I dunno what the fuck you guys do over there, but if you could tell me some stuff to do. I know stone chat, Stonehenge, I've talked to enough Americans who've gone over there. It's basically sitting on the side of the road like a fucking Starbucks. It's very underwhelming. Um, whenever they film it there, they're real close and they make sure that, that they don't have the highway like 10 feet away from the fucking thing. I'm, I can't wait for somebody to fall asleep at the wheel and just drive right into that thing. That's going to be hilarious.

Speaker 4:          01:00:04       So anyways, this is the podcast this week. I had been kind of Cunty the last couple of weeks I've been in a bad move, but, uh, I'm in a much better mood this week, so, uh, I don't know if that'll make this less funnier or more tolerable. It's up to you. So here's some youtube videos. Speaking of England, uh, this is my nod to, uh, just something I discovered a few years ago, um, through this comedian Jordan Rubin. I was the one on is my space page. Remember that? You remember my space? I was the last one. Um, he had a clip of this on his page and I actually checked it out. It's called the Prince of Wales. And, uh, it's actually spelled w, h a l e s, like the, uh, the mammal and a, it's called Derek and Clive, d. R e c o s r d e r e. K. And Clive Cli. V. E. Alright. And it's actually Dudley Moore and this Guy Peter Cook, who most Americans have never heard of.

Speaker 4:          01:01:01       And um, it's basically just imagine if I was doing a podcast with some other asshole, but 30 years ago and it's this, just them going off on stuff and they made, when you watch the clip, it stem, I believe, recording the album and it was just the most filthiest shit and offensive stuff that they could come up. They talk about religion, a lot of stuff, a lot of stuff that actually, I was watching it and I was like, Jesus Christ, this is a, this is like the original podcast. It's completely over the top and a, I guess, you know, it's Dudley Moore and that Peter Cook and I guess they were supposed to be a, I don't know what they was supposed to be mean. I don't live over there, so obviously, so I don't know what, who they're supposed to be. I'm just imagining it's just a couple of cans.

Speaker 4:          01:01:45       Kevin and I can sit in a bar. I don't know what, but it's fucking hilarious to me and I hope you enjoy it. All right. I have also, by the way, I have a nice, I have a nice variety of youtube videos. So if you're not into the comedy thing, if you want to see a beautiful woman with the most killer body I've ever seen in my fucking life and an accent to match it and her hair done up and fucking pony tails as she works out. Look up fitness, uh, killer five 50 rep workout fitness dash killer five 50 workout. Uh, I can't remember the name of the girl. She's ridiculous and she does this insane workout. She's in shape, I believe her titties or natural, unless you went to Dallas and got those teardrop fucking fake ones that I saw out there. Um, and she just works out and she looks unbelievable and as she gets further into the set, she starts going like, it's fucking awesome.

Speaker 4:          01:02:44       Um, and a comedian, you should checkout, checkout out. Reggie watts are [inaudible] watts, w a t. T. S a lot of the shitty puts up. There was this musical stuff that he does, I think because he doesn't want to burn as material like most comedians. But if you get a chance to see that guy, there you go recommending a video and in a comedian, um, those are all on youtube. And here's another, the last video. I will recommend this something, a break.com and there's something called the tree terminator. And uh, it's just one of those machines that you're going to see that it just shows that human beings were just too fucking smart for our own God. Damn good. Basically this machine, for those of you who are on a treadmill right now, it just each has, it's like a big hand. I Dunno what it is. It just, it looks like a back haul, but it's really like a hand in, it just grabs these trees, pulls them right out of the ground and then it like, imagine if like, okay, you, you fucking, you threw a jab, right. Do that right

Speaker 1:          01:03:50       now when your cubicle several one thinks you're fucking insane and they're just waiting and have a fist so they don't think you're fucking listening to her Hitler video. Um, stick. Yeah. Sticky hand out there like you're about ready to salute Hitler, but have a fist so you don't offend anybody. And then just imagine if if your arm right down to your wrist wouldn't move yet. Your fucking hand could do an entire fucking three 60 that's what this device does except you're holding a tree and then what it does is it fucking, some are holds the tree in place with, I dunno what some device in there and then it loosens its grip and it goes up and down the tree. Like it's jacking it off horizontally. But what it's really doing is removing all the branches and the leaves. So then all you're left with is the fucking is the trunk with the bark still on it.

Speaker 1:          01:04:39       It gives it another fucking Jack and now it's you know, back and forth a few times now all it is is just as round spool of a of wood and then add, it doesn't stop there. Then it goes all the way down to the, I guess where the balls would be. Right? It's very fucking a phallic here. And then what it starts where the weather at, the base of the shaft goes up about three and then tramp that was supposed to be at slicing and half. I really fucking blew it on that. Uh, that was the worst sound effect ever. Clamp. That's not what he doesn't want. That's what it did. That's the right sound effects. Say No. Michael Winslow this week and

Speaker 4:          01:05:18       the edge just in sections, like little fucking six foot sections of wood. And I'm telling you it can do it. One tree every like 20 seconds. And this guy's just a one mic. One guy with a machine is just basically going through this forest so we can all have baseball bats. I don't know what, just you know, button an amount of time. It took me to fucking explain that. You could have looked it up and watched it. It was such an idiot. What am I got to hear? What's coming up next? What's the next subject here on the Monday morning podcast? Oh, here's something it's called, let's get smart is an exclamation ex explanation point. I'm desperately trying to become a, uh, the smartest more on that I can become an I've actually through that Lumosity. Dot. And becoming a better speller. And these are some of the words that I've been, one of the Games I've been trying to come up with, but I don't know how to spell them.

Speaker 4:          01:06:11       So then I, uh, I just write them down and I give myself spelling tests, aesthetic aggressive, allege bizarre Catamaran, cantaloupe, catalyst, catalyst, chloroform, disingenuous, facetious. You know, you know what's great about, these are all words that you can use in print, but if you actually use them a while speaking, you come off like a douchebag, at least in the circle of people that I'm hanging out, like who we're hanging out with that can't use the word infrastructure. Can I use the word melancholy? Huh? Anybody else spell melancholies to spell it? M E. L. L. O. N. K. O. L. L. Y. Like I did, I wasn't that bad, but it was pretty brutal. Like succinct. I was playing this game. And uh, you have to do that. Like when you're texting and you come up with a word that you so can't even spell, like your brain literally locks and lights succinct. I was like, how the fuck do you spell this?

Speaker 4:          01:07:10       Saw as a saint. Is that like sync? Like you brush your teeth? S I. N, k, e. D you know the past tense of sync. Sinked or like sync something up. See why. See I think I spelled s u s y c and then laughed and hit enter and then the computer's like, oh mom, did you mean succinct? You know, you know when Google gets all country like that. Oh my believe when you were trying to say was really, I believe we fucking made you. That might've been my girl. Just laughed at me. What Neil was that one of the dumbest things I've ever said on this that was pretty fucking stupid.

Speaker 4:          01:08:00       Yeah. I believe we made you, you know, in 30 years when I lead the rebellion against the robots that are, uh, that, that are going to replace us, that's, that's are going to be our battle cry when we're sitting there with our p nine dx bodies and I'll be standing there getting a sunburn just standing there with half a blue face going, ohm. I believe we made you don't move. Don't move until their screen shuts down. That's the lights of their eyes, like giving you attitude. It does have an APP. Well, come over here. You're going to be on the podcast. It does have an attitude. Oh, it says to help you out. No, but it's said.

Speaker 4:          01:08:55       Yeah, it is. Well, you know something, I guess it all depends on the voice in your head. Cause did you mean this? The only thing it's missing it, it should just have o.dot, dot. In front of it. What the fuck was that? Yeah, you're supposed to continue. That just made it sound like it. Bob, do you want, yeah. All right. Move on. Where are you going? You're a little Russian mail order bride that you watch on youtube there. Oh, how hard is she? You gotta admit she's hot. She's very hot. What'd you, what I would make out with her answering that question. It's a yes. See fucking champ right here. Fucking champ. Maybe we'll see her when we're over there and uh, pull ups in some war torn country, which he's on the head when she's on that route. When she's on that rooftop and she's doing all her squat thrusts and making noises like a porno star, doesn't she look like she's in the middle of like, they just bomb.

Speaker 4:          01:09:52       First of all, she's, she's tired after her set. She's tired after you fucking talking about it. That's what I'm tired of. So what do you think about that? I think that brings it full circle to me. Have an attitude about Google. I didn't ask you to only know it's going to put it up there. Why can't I enjoy one of God's beautiful creatures? Police fucking break. Fuck you. Every time you see Kevin Garnett on the screen, you got to make that fucking, yeah, yeah. See, go fuck yourself. Get out of here. Can I see your breath for a second? He just said, get out. Get Out. Beat it.

Speaker 4:          01:10:34       You have to leave in 20 minutes. Well, call a cab sweetheart. You know what? Nothing. Don't get that Google attitude with me. Oh, I have to leave in 20 minutes. No one's stopping you. Hey Nia. How do you spell succinct if you're so fucking smart. Cause I told you how to spell it the other day. Fuck you. Shut up. Shut your face. Watch what don't I listen? What succinct as I e. N. Z. Ah, you know it isn't. Can I tell you something? This is when you know you don't know how to spell a word. When for some reason you're looking the right or left and there's nobody there. You don't know how to spell it. The UCC. I. E. N. S. U. C. C. I. N. C. T. Succinct. There's no e. No, that's a hard one. Facetious. It's like face Sacious, right? Like how you say it? F A. Oh my God, I can't breathe with you. We're going to have a dumbest kid ever.

Speaker 2:          01:11:42       Yeah,

Speaker 4:          01:11:43       it's a baby boy. Boy. Oh, well, it'll go. That's why it has school and teachers for dumb parents. Did you just say that's why it has school and teachers? Do you see what cell phones are doing to us? I'm telling you. That's why it good Lord. Would you look at you? Wow. All right. Anyways, that's why they make a beautiful, you just bombed the spelling test. Wow. You're not a good speller. Really? Well, that was a too difficult. Okay. Facetious. His face tee os, fac. E. T. I. O. U s. So I'm actually sitting here. I'm like a psycho, like a Jack Nicholson in the shining and I'm just sitting here writing sentences that don't really make any sense because I just want to use all the words that I've used that I've learned. I mean, the mallow tourist melancholy of the psychotic critics was aesthetically pleasing despite their silhouette, the capitulation of the inmates penitentiary argument could be stated that one doesn't need and as squiz exquisite repertoire, merely a succinct dilemma with a sociopath. Nice fucking restaurant.

Speaker 4:          01:13:05       Sorry, I ran out of words. I just remember all I had left was restaurant and I was like, I need one more sentence and I was tired. One of a fuck you, you spell some of those words. But I'm saying like I'm just listen to how I speak. Okay. And how many words? I mispronounce it. I've lied to myself for years. That the reason why I make such a fool of myself is because my brain works so quickly that it, it's, it's, it's ahead of where my tongue is at and then that's not fucking true. All right. I'm here to tell you that I am an idiot and I'm, I'm really trying desperately to, uh, I've come to the acceptance that I'm a moron and if I can, I just, but I just want it be, but I still don't feel even, I still feel like I can at least improve on.

Speaker 4:          01:13:49       Uh, I can be kicked by big. I can become less of a moron. All right. So this is basically what I've been doing. As I've been saying in the past couple of weeks, I've been writing with my right hand cause I'm lefthanded and I've been throwing with my left hand because I do sports with my right hand, my fucking mess. But um, yeah, I guess it opens different parts of your brain. And I was talking about it and sounding like a moron is always, um, how do you spell cantaloupe as a good one? Huh? You know, cantaloupe, we know those days when you're like, ah, I got to get in shape yet you still go out for breakfast and you still get the pancakes and the eggs, but you go, you know what, I'm not going to get the home fries. Let me get a fruit cup instead. You know?

Speaker 4:          01:14:33       And then they have that look on their face like, holy shit, nobody orders the Fruit Cup. That's why I forgot it was even on the fucking menu. And then they go out there and they bring this Fruit Cup bought back out to you. Right. And it's always that little, uh, you know, he's got a couple of grapes. It's got a melon and this got cantaloupe. And it has little fucking moldy tentacles reaching to each piece of fruit. Cantaloupe. I love cantaloupe. A lot of people don't know that about myself and a for the life of me, I couldn't spell it. I spelled it like, like cantaloupe. Like you cantaloupe, you have to have a wedding. This is how, this is how he spelled c a n t a l o u. P. E if I haven't bored you to fucking tears at this point, nothing I'll talk about.

Speaker 4:          01:15:25       Well let's move on to the next one. Um, so basically I was talking about that stuff where you, you actually use your opposite hand. It all started with this, uh, some comic down the comedy store can't move the fuck it was because my brain's mush was talking about how that improves your brain and actually if you're lefthanded and use your right hand for stuff that usually use with your left hand and actually improves your lefthand allegedly. So this gets scientist, I'm going to call him a scientist rights. And he said, Bill and your podcast, when you talk about using your opposite hand and learning to write with it, the term is called neuroplasticity or Blain plasticity. I don't know how the fuck to say, uh, what are, what you are doing is retraining your brain. That's the science behind brain fitness. Here is a nice little article about it on a p o s I t science.com.

Speaker 4:          01:16:17       Um, and actually, you know something, I've actually seen someone who did something like that. Uh, every morning me and my lovely girlfriend go for this hike. And when we first moved out here, there was this guy who clearly just had a stroke and he would walk up the hill. He was walking like, well, I'm talking to serious like hike here. And this guy was going like, you know, a half, not even a half a mile, quarter of a mile an hour. I was almost going to say a half a mile every two hours. And I quickly did the math. See, I'm getting smarter and stop laughing at me. So, um, I like this. I like you coming in and out of the room laughing. So I know that you kind of like a little mini studio audience so I know that at least some of this is funny. So anyways, this fucking guy is walking with a cane and it's one of those deals where you like, there's no way he's going to make it up to the top. And every morning we would see this guy, you know, if we'd left at the same time and then we go a couple of weeks we wouldn't see him. And he just kept getting better and better and better. And the how unbelievable did that guy look the last time it was his arm and all straightened out, his left leg was working again. Somebody should have made a documentary about that cause that's the part of the movie where we would have been crying as opposed to being like, oh I haven't seen her a couple weeks. You welcome. Great.

Speaker 4:          01:17:34       If you're going to talk, come over towards the microphone. I was saying we were with my mom when we saw him. Right. And how did that add to the story? See, this is why women's stink at telling stories. Yeah, but paint, but paint the story about the thing that we're seeing. My mother was there and I saw a Robin right next to a squirrel. So anyways, using your opposite hand, he's just like, what the fuck are you talking about? You know what, Nia, just sit there and look pretty. Awe. All right. Um, so anyways, if you guys, I'm telling you the truth, um, you can make yourself stroke proof that stroke proof, but you can, you can, you don't have to go through the Rehab. Just blow the doctor's mind. You know, as you're writing a check with your opposite hand for how much they overcharged you and you're already rubbing one out. You're staring at your fucking, was it bed nurse? Is that what it is? Wet nurse. Whatever the fuck they, ah, what nurses said breastfeeding. Wasn't there something in the news about breastfeeding this week? Something about somebody who drinks breastmilk and they're way beyond the age. The John Mayer do another interview for a Max.

Speaker 4:          01:18:53       You don't like John Mayer. He's a fucking moron. He's not a fucking moron. He's fucking okay. What are you basing that on? Everything that comes out of his douche bag. Give me an example.

Speaker 5:          01:19:07       That whole controversy that came out recently, the interview that he gave with Playboy magazine, you know, totally talking shit about everybody and then maybe common. Wow.

Speaker 4:          01:19:17       First of all, it wasn't a controversy really. Was it riding in the streets?

Speaker 5:          01:19:21       It was controversial. It was controversial. He got on stage and started like fake tearing up and apologizing to his fans and being like, I'm sorry I was trying to be clever. I just thank you guys so much for sticking by me and blah, Blah Blah and all that. Wow. Yeah. He, he

Speaker 4:          01:19:37       went to, he had a tear up about it. So Jesus, I haven't seen, I haven't seen that since Marlon Brando went off on the, uh, went off on j town over there. You don't remember that? I already did that. I got to keep it funny. The end of his life. Yeah, he did a little, he did wrote the, uh, the prologue to the, uh, what's his face? I will just say Martin Scorsese. Melle Mel, not Mel Brooks. Mel Gibson, his little rant.

Speaker 5:          01:20:09       Yeah, and just this whole thing about how a black people love him because he's, what did he say? Cause I'm very, whatever that means. And then the interviewer, who admittedly I think asked to douchey question that kind of set him up was like, Oh, do black women throw themselves at you? And he was like, he said something like, yeah, but my dick rejects them. Like I have a whites. I have a United colors of Benetton heart and a white supremacists Dick.

Speaker 4:          01:20:35       Yeah, but you can see how he's trying to make a joke. He plays the Ukulele. Okay. His comic timing is a little off. You can see where he's going with that. He knows what he likes. He knows what he likes. He goes out and he tags it, you know, with his fucking updated mullet. Look, if you've got to be on coke, get another microphone. If you're going to keep interjecting here. I was trying to do a podcast. You keep interrupting. I've had enough of this joking. You fucking control me with that pouty face. It's fucking annoying. Um, all right. Uh, recommending books for the week. See us. Yeah, exactly. What Oprah does it, I can fucking do it, but at least I have the honesty least I'm honest enough to say I don't read them. Nia, as you sit there and looking into Oprah's eyes, here's another wonderful book that I didn't read, but my intern said it was great.

Speaker 4:          01:21:23       I'm a book, uh, Bill, I enjoy the podcast. You have to check out a book called the creature from Jekyll island. It's a book about how the Federal Reserve was started and they planned to be able to have a system in place from the start that would enable certain large banks from being a, from being bailed out if shit went down. Apparently they've bailed out banks before, just not a public. Oh, that's fucking brilliant. So basically they become the bank for all the banks. And then what they do is they bail out some of them every time they tank the economy and some of them they don't. And those things get consumed by the other banks that exist and so on and so forth. Just like, it's like a reverse prowl commercial. Instead of telling two friends and so on and so on, they're going the opposite direction all, all the way towards a one World Bank, which is why, what are we down to? Now we're down to chase wells Fargo, Bank of America, and uh, John Mellencamp trust it. Doesn't he have one out there for the farmers next to that little pink house?

Speaker 5:          01:22:32       Sage Jabil halls show. Don't make it rain. Ethiopia.

Speaker 4:          01:22:38       All right. Also, you should look up a recent article in Philadelphia about how more than a dozen armed state police raided a few small ale houses in Philly to confiscate in air quotes, unregistered beer. They basically stole over seven grand worth of pricey beer, most of which was most of which was actually registered, but not accurately due to a clerical errors made on the end of the city. So it was the city's fall through. That's fucking hilarious. I, that's bad. I know. That's mean. They shouldn't be doing that shit. But you know, they stole beer. I mean, come on. It's like Pauline and the pope of Greenwich Village. I didn't rape his daughter. I didn't spit in his fat face. I took money, Charlie fucking money. They stole some bear, whatever. They want to have a keg party.

Speaker 4:          01:23:24       And how are you going to do, all right, here's one for you. I talked about the uh, going to the cloud nine, a titty bar in Troy, New York. And there's actually an article on there about this fucked up strip club that I went to a number of years ago. February 1st, 2008 CT police shut down the cloud nine and adult entertainment business. That's because they have the video store next to it. I believe that's out in the garage for those of you didn't listen last week. It's a, it's a titty bar that you walk into and it's like walking into somebody's house and the second you walk in there you want to leave. But there's so few people in there. They all look at you literally that moment where the needle goes off the record or the laser goes off the CD or the iPod skips. I don't know what the fuck to say about nowadays, but um, how to say it now for nowadays technology.

Speaker 4:          01:24:14       But anyways, the city shut down the cloud nine, uh, because uh, this afternoon for multiple code violations and charged a 46 year old dancer, a 46 year old dancer with prostitution, city officials said, say that's for all you dancers out there. That's what happens when you're in your 20s. You can have an attitude, but if you're 46 [inaudible] 46 years old and you still dancing, you better drop to your fucking knees, sweetheart, if you want to make the rent, okay? All the more reason to stop lying that you're going to college and actually use those fucking funny, that funny money to go to college. All right. Or you'll be working in the cloud nine at 46. Wow. You know what? I'm going to copy and paste that. I'm going to print that sentence and put it right above my desk. Anytime I'm feeling bad about my life, I'll be like, well, at least I'm not a 46 year old dancer charged with prostitution at the, uh, cloud nine to Troy New York.

Speaker 4:          01:25:10       Uh, the raid followed a five week undercover investigation. Yeah. How hilarious is that? What were the undercover cop got blown by the 46 year old in which Troy and, um, run Sealy, our police officers observe dancers engaged in elicit sexual activities. Do this reeks of a shakedown. Like the cops didn't know that was going on. I did a college gig out there and figured out what the fuck was going on in about four hours. What happened? Did this 46 year old stop given the free blow jobs to the cops, speaking of which, you know, I heard that asshole in the, in the Prius who couldn't stop his car. Um, you guys seen that story? Um, allegedly. All that girls titties are fake by the way. I'm looking at her right now. The tits fake Nia. My fault. Wow. That knocks her looks down by 40%.

Speaker 4:          01:26:08       I got to say, there's nothing, there's nothing worse than fake tits. It's just not, that really just says something about you that's uh, that's right up there with like hair plugs that just says, you know, I don't know what that is. That does it. I don't know. I'm starting to change my fucking attitudes. I guess. You want bigger tits. You think that's bad. And if you go out and get big fake tits, those are fake, right? Look at those. Those are fake probably, you know. Well when, when they were round all the way up to the top, they look fake in that picture. They don't in the training video, you're not near the microphone. Okay. You just sound like some crazy person in a closet. You look adorable. What are you getting all dolled up for? Fuck you. I don't buy it. What do you even meet?

Speaker 4:          01:26:57       Some hipster. Is that what happened? These vans skateboarding shoes and is ironic. ACDC tee shirt or Hardcastle Hardcastle and McCormick backpack. Fucking assholes. A mock. Everything I loved when I was a kid. Remember? Hardcastle and McCormick. You always had a cool car. Some chick he wanted to fucking bang. And then the old guy who was too old for this shit, it's all you needed. BOMP bomp it up. All right. So anyways, this guy had a Prius, he couldn't stop the car, so he had to call the cops. I can't believe I fell for that one. And people go and he was doing like 90 miles, you know, or really in the middle of the day. And he had time to call the fucking police. They caught up with them and he didn't hit anybody. Is anybody out there driven 90 miles an hour in the middle of the afternoon? I don't give a fuck.

Speaker 4:          01:27:42       Even if you're in Kansas, there's going to be some asshole drive and fucking 50 in the left lane. So evidently that guy has a history of a reporting back injuries and that type of stuff. So, uh, I actually, the more I'm thinking about this, I'm really thinking that this is, this is what a Chrysler did to this as Zukie Sam arrive when it was outselling the jeep. They just started a rumor that a tipped over going two miles an hour. And which wasn't true, but everybody heard it and everybody stopped buying them. And that was it. Like they fucked me on the resale resale value on my car. Who the fuck's gonna buy my Prius than not? Even if I have all the documentation, I swear to God they fixed it. Um, I think the, the, the fucking Prius is becoming, not today's a pinto. What do you think about that? I think I just wanted to that point where this podcast should have fucking ended and I'm still talking, or if you want to see more videos of this fucking smoking hot chick, maybe she just got fake tits. It's body rock. Dot. COBB. Did I just get a look from Unia? She is. She's smoking hot.

Speaker 4:          01:28:48       Exactly. Thank you. All right, let's wrap this shit up here. Um, I dunno if I have time to read this. These, these things are getting too fucking long. Let's end with this reality TV. Uh, Bill, I'm originally from Boston. I heard you. I was listening to Greg Fitzsimmons podcasts or as he refers to it fits dog radio and this guy writes beyond the outer limits of gay, uh, the guys on the wrong side of 40. And he's still referring to himself with the sub ebonic hip name with some sub robotic hip name. You know what it really is? It's Chris. Most people are too fucking stupid to Fitz Simmons. I know. Fits dog. Yeah, that's from back in the day. I'm so, um, yeah, fit. Say Well, you know what? He's up. It's a great fucking show. And now I'm going to plug it fits dog radio and uh, the fact that you trashed it.

Speaker 4:          01:29:42       I didn't even notice that. I guess it's gay. I'm Doug. Just, I'm on the wrong side of 42. I'm 40 also, I should say a. Anyways, just wanted to say, I listen to your most recent podcasts and I loved it. You sound exactly like my old friend, uh, Kevin Burke. Uh, but blah, blah, blah. Thank you. All this shit. Anyways, um, your virtual reality TV and your podcast and I couldn't agree with you more. Nobody will remember these assholes. As soon as this, as season two comes around, bring back scripted TV. I don't care if I lose my job, at least I'll have my integrity back. Um, I unfortunately work in reality TV and can tell you from my experience, every cast member I've ever had the unpleasant chance to chat with thinks he or she was meant to be on television. None of these fucking pathetic shitheads ever put in any hard work into it.

Speaker 4:          01:30:31       Making a career out of being on TV and a over never made, never put any hard work into making a career out of being on TV. They make me sick and I have to work with them a lot. Uh, well that's a tough fucking situation. Um, well, you know what, as much as I made fun of that, that cast from the Jersey shore actually came back for 10 grand an episode and a, I want to make a prediction. I think that that that next season is going to fail miserably because they're taking them out of the Jersey shore and now that they're going to take them down to a, I believe Miami Beach, which I might be a mistake. That's like when it's Sitcom has kind of jumped the shark and they don't know what else to do. So they do the trapped in a cabin episode or Greg's trapped in a fucking meat locker with Bobby and Bobby doesn't like being small and now he likes being small because he can crawl through that little fucking window.

Speaker 4:          01:31:24       That's, that's, that's when the show is fucking over. When Fonzie he has to put up fucking jumped the shark with his leather jacket still on. What are some other ones are, oh, you gotta fucking introduce a cute little kid or your dog pukes on the floor. Cleo. Fucking love this dog. Anyways, that's the podcast for this week. Hopefully it's up on iTunes. If it isn't. Yeah, we're working on it. I don't know what to tell. You were fucking working on it. And I appreciate that people are getting meat, getting so mad at me that I haven't been able to figure it out or hire somebody at this point, because that means you give a shit,

Speaker 1:          01:32:01       you know? All right. That's it for the podcast. I'll have video next week up on bill [inaudible] dot com of my wonderful trip to, uh, London, Dublin and, uh, in Glasgow, Scotland. And I'm coming off the wagon and a hard fucking way. All right, so I'm going to be back next week. A little more bloated, a little dumber, add a little something else. So it's the magic number of three. All right. You guys have a great [inaudible].

Speaker 2:          01:32:31       Wow. Wow. Okay.
