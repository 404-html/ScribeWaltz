Speaker 2:          00:00:17       I'm in San Francisco would still Sunday. Uh, the second half has just begun. The saints go marching in verse the Minnesota Vikings. This saints was my pick this weekend. I loved drew Brees going into Minnesota and fucking having everybody crying at the fucking mall of America by the end of the game. And so far the vikings are up 17 to nothing, although I think they just fucking went three and out. Oh, case key to just got put down on his fucking Keester.

Speaker 3:          00:00:51       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:00:52       We'll see. We'll see. You never know what's going to happen, you know. I mean, look, look at the fucking Jaguar's. The Jaguar's when just came right out, gave the Steelers the old right there. Fred, all of a sudden they're running back, twist his ankle. Right. I don't feel, I can't put any weight on it, man. Right. Then all of a sudden the Steelers come roaring fucking back and I'm saying

Speaker 2:          00:01:13       [inaudible] gone. This game's over the Pittsburgh Steelers. It's in Pittsburgh. This shit is over. No Way. Uh, uh, what the fuck's his name? Bryce Bortles. I kicked, by the way, I can't keep up with these fucking names from the 90s. Okay. The cases, the Bryce, the boltons the fuck. I don't know. You know, a lot of comics have done bits about it, but you know, back when it was like, you know, Bill, Bob fucking Steve Joe Greatest quarterback of all fucking time at one point was named Joe. You know Joe Nemeth, Joe Montana, Joe size man Joe.

Speaker 3:          00:01:56       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:01:57       Fucking Blake Bortles I, you know, whatever. I'm just, I'm an old crabby fucking man. I guess the nineties, it was really big to name your kid after a c name, considering all the quarterbacks. Right. Kurt Carson case. It's like, did Roger Clemens fuck all these women now? But he did that. You had like fucking nine kids and he get Cody, Kyle Conti, Chris, right. They're all case. They are all case. Yeah. Why would you have them have their own identity? Let's fuck it. Have their name be about your fucking career. Um,

Speaker 1:          00:02:39       what do you mean you want to be a veterinarian? Get the fuck out there. Pick up a baseball and throw some hay.

Speaker 3:          00:02:46       MMM,

Speaker 2:          00:02:48       sorry. That was my impression of what it's like inside their households. Like I have any idea. All right.

Speaker 3:          00:02:54       Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:02:54       I have nothing against the Clemens family. I love Roger Clemens. You know, fuck it. Did some great things with the red sox before he went to Toronto. Well, we let them go. Right then he fucking jumped on that poor police horse. Jesus Christ. You know, that horse was wishing it was a fucking clydesdale when he got on his goddamn back. Um,

Speaker 3:          00:03:16       okay.

Speaker 2:          00:03:16       Uh, just in a bad mood because I'm in San Francisco, right? I fucking came here yesterday and no guy has even looked at me. No. I came here yesterday and it was sunny up one of the rare sunny beautiful days and San Francisco when it is sunny out, when the weather's nice can fuck with any city. I'll even say in North America, forget about the continental United States, including Alaska, Hawaii, and some of our tributaries like fucking Puerto Rico there. I say Fox with any city. Okay. However, on the usual cloudy, rainy day,

Speaker 2:          00:03:56       this place, there's, there's a misery to this fucking place. This it's cold, wet air blowing against you as you walk up yet another fucking hill, you know, nothing is ever down a hill. It's always up a hill around a corner to an even steeper hill, you know, when they still have all that mamas and Papas, you know, although leaves are brown Hippie vibe going out here a little bit, even all the evil people from fucking a silicone valley, which I still never know quite where that is. It's somewhere down near like San Jose. I just don't know where it begins and where it ends. But silicone to me and my level of intellect, the amount of books that I've read in life, silicone to me is and will always be what's in fake titties. So, you know, I don't know what they're doing. I actually flew up here,

Speaker 3:          00:04:50       okay.

Speaker 2:          00:04:51       Uh, rented a helicopter and flew up here with a couple people, had a great fucking time, picked up a couple of hours and um, we went by this giant building that was this huge circle and I was like, what the fuck is that? That looks like,

Speaker 2:          00:05:07       I dunno, it looks like like the Pentagon. If it was groovy man, right. That's was like, what is that? And my buddy guests, he goes, it's probably, maybe it's apple. I never seen a building like it. It was just a total circle. Then in the middle there was like all of this, like it looked like a jungle in the middle, you know? And if you look down you could see the employees screaming and waving. Don't get me Outta here. He still alive. Steve is still alive. I think that's what it's set up. But I was too busy focusing on not hitting somebody else while I was up there. It turns out it was the apple building. Very impressive, very in fucking impressive structure. And then we went right by Stanford and saw that stadium. I buddy was hitting me with a trivia before we got there. He goes, I went to a game, I went to a Superbowl, he claimed it was the only super bowl ever played at a college or something like

Speaker 1:          00:05:58       that. Which isn't true because they played a bunch of the rose bowl, most of the two lane maybe. He said the last one played it a college stadium. Was it that, I forget what it was. Don't blame him. Blame me for not remembering. And uh, I was able to get sad. I said was the, uh, 40 niners dolphins at Stanford Stadium? Only because I had recently read that that's where they played that game. And because I got that right, he then had to be like, what was the score? I was like, I dunno. But Fulton Walker took a kickoff back for the first time. Super Bowl history. It's like 35, 10. So anyways, we fucking land at San Francisco International Airport, which it's so, it's so much different. You know, when you, and when you actually get to see how cool it, fuck it looks when you sitting in the back of the tube, you know, and you're just looking out the back, just praying, you know, just please get this thing on the fucking ground. It's different when you come up there. It's fucking amazing. It's expensive as shit, but it's amazing, right? So we land, everything's going great. And uh,

Speaker 3:          00:07:07       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:07:08       I ended up doing this thing with the, what is it? The San Francisco, uh, sketch fest and um, I did this, what was it? The, uh, who's the guy from Cuba, Castro, the Castro theater with Kevin Pollak. And we just went out and, uh, sort of an interview, just riff and fucking around that people came up and ask questions afterwards. I want to thank everybody who showed up was like one in the afternoon. All of these people showed up. It was a great time and a campus, just the greatest fucking dude ever. And we actually, I got to do a scene with them in a movie coming up called a front runner. It's coming up this year. Um,

Speaker 1:          00:07:57       we had a great time doing that. And uh, you know, San Francisco, why in a bad mood belt? The south sounds great. It's all great. It's all fucking great. Then I get to my hotel, of course, I show up right in the lady takes my driver's license. I forgot to not just show it to her like she took the driver's license, right? So then she starts clicking on a keyboard and say, Hey, can you do me favor keen, teeny, not type any personal information on a license. And she got all this fucking attitude. She goes, I am not, I will tell you what I'm typing in and bubble and his whole fucking, you know, snap to the 12th to the sex, whatever the fucking kids say, I want to be like Lady Lady, you're not going to tell me what you're going to do. I'm going to tell you what you're not going to do, you fucking cunt. But of course they can't say that, you know, I can't say that too. I don't know what the fuck happened to customer service, but her fucking attitude, the way she talked to me, it was like I told her how to parent or kid.

Speaker 1:          00:08:56       So then she looks at me up. Of course they don't fucking have me down cause I probably miscommunicated when I was going to come up here anyways. I just didn't say a fucking word. Right. And then she went out of her way and actually got me, you know she didn't get it. I mean out of the way she fucking did her job. Fuckers still fuck her sir. I'm going to tell you one bit like what enough. I felt like I was getting booked.

Speaker 1:          00:09:23       I just, I, I fucking, I don't understand what has happened to customer service. So then I was just like, all right, all right, fucking whatever. All right. And then this hotel turns out they don't have the two things that I need in a hotel. The only two fucking things I need other than a fucking door that doesn't open up out into the parking lot. In other words, I'm not staying in a motel. Okay. And all I need is some sort of gym and an ironing board. That's it. This hotel has, neither has, neither has little steam fucking machine. I don't want to steam my fucking clothes. I practice my drum shit, but I'm on the road. It bring a little practice pad. And after all these years of trying to find a fucking table that fits right. The ironing board was there the whole time. He just play standing up. Okay. And you can adjust it down. If it's not high enough, he just put a couple of towels underneath and then it's at the height you need it to be. They don't fucking happen.

Speaker 3:          00:10:17       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:10:19       And then lastly, I went to go get a burrito and I fucked up. Like San Francisco makes the best burritos. Right? They got the best break perfected them. I don't know where they came from. I believe France invented the Burrito. I'm not sure.

Speaker 3:          00:10:31       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:10:34       So there's this fucking, I'm not gonna name the Burrito place, but evidently they got a great spot in the mission and I'm all the way down near the fucking touristy area where they got like rides to Alcatraz. I'm like, I'm not fucking going all the way out there. I want to watch both these fucking football games. And the one behold, I find that there is, there's a guy that, there's a one that's in on everybody's top 10 list that makes a fucking Burrito in the mission but also has another location down near the fishermen place. Right. The wharf down here. So I'm like, all right, well I know it's probably not going to be as good as the original cause that's the original oven and blah blah blah blah blah. So I fucking go to the new, obviously the second one that they opened, I show up. Right. And uh,

Speaker 3:          00:11:18       yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:11:19       dislike fucking, I dunno, a group of Ford Front me in a group of two in front of me and you would have thought the amount of time it took them to order a fucking Burrito, you would've thought that they were trying to like, you know, it was like war time and they were trying to catch the last flight out before the, you know, the impending regime or whatever. It's going to send them to a fucking labor camp. That's like how long they were negotiating this. And what kills me is these four people that took for fucking ever then the two people behind him who had enough time to fucking go on Youtube, find out what's in a Burrito, go to a fucking supermarket, buy the shit and cook one. That's the amount of time they had it. They step up to the register. It's their moment of truth to order a Burrito and they will start looking at the menu. Uh, we're good.

Speaker 3:          00:12:08       Ugh.

Speaker 1:          00:12:12       Fucking ridiculous. Fucking ridiculous. So I get up there. What do you want? Give me an original burrito. Chicken chips and salsa in a water to go cash. Thank you. Step aside over, how hard is that? You know what it is is somewhere in the last century it became illegal to punch somebody in the back of the head when they were taking too long and align. And now everybody, they just, you know, they just a little too comfortable. They just a little too comfortable. So I'm standing there and uh, you know, now in behind the fucking couple that you know, over at the salsa line, Salsa line, salsa, salsa line and uh, I'm behind them again and it's taking them forever to get fucking salsa. Fucking looking around and they're looking at other people. It's like, use your fucking braid. Mild, medium hot.

Speaker 3:          00:13:11       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:13:12       The fuck damn saints. Or when the saints go marching in but up up, oh, oh, plenty of time left. No, there isn't. What am I talking about? I thought that was fucking one 18 into the third quarter. Well, I guess there's plenty of time left, right? This is the way the game is played nowadays. It's like, do they go for two here? There's only a quarter in a minute. 13 left. Kick the fucking extra point.

Speaker 3:          00:13:45       Um, yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:13:50       Jesus Christ. That guy just had a soul patch on the back of his head. Wow. You know, tough. You have to be to have that because if somebody just how hard it would be, do not tell that guy how fucking annoying that. It's like, dude, I just want to fucking, can you just grow it out? A shave it off.

Speaker 3:          00:14:08       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:14:10       All right. Touchdown Saints touched my prediction lives. This is such a disturbing commercial with this guy falls off the cruise ship. This is one of my biggest fucking fears in life. You know what I mean?

Speaker 3:          00:14:25       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:14:26       Just being in the fucking ocean, praying for hypothermia to set it before summer, something comes up to you and just takes a bite out of you. Can you imagine when you see that fucking shark fin? Just break the water, you know, and you know, you smell the thing. Fucking wild animals. You could smell them from a mile away to the point. I don't understand how they're able to kill anybody.

Speaker 2:          00:14:52       You know? You didn't. You ever go to the fucking sue when you just smell those God damn lions? I guess every, everything stinks out there, you know? Um,

Speaker 4:          00:15:04       yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:15:04       Anyways. Then they just leave. The guy in the fucking ocean fucking really bothers me. I this gotta be somebody complaining about that,

Speaker 1:          00:15:15       you know,

Speaker 2:          00:15:16       once a year that seems to happen or every couple of years, like somebody goes on a honeymoon and their spouse fucking falls overboard.

Speaker 1:          00:15:24       You know,

Speaker 2:          00:15:26       I gotta look that up. How many fucking times? What do you, what are the odds? Are the odds higher on a honeymoon or FTE been married for awhile? Like how many times somebody who's like fucking thrown his spouse overboard, you know, and if it's anywhere near the number that I think it is, I want to know why it doesn't have its own Hashtag. I think we need to start a Hashtag on Twitter. Let me just do fucking three seconds of a research here. Spouse, how do you spell spouse? I just spelt spas, spouse, what would I look up? Your spouse,

Speaker 1:          00:16:10       dead

Speaker 2:          00:16:12       cruise ship. Uh, significant other question mark. What a passionate your dyes and see what you need to know. Oh my God, what do they do?

Um, so the guy's name go for the guy became like a senator. Husband pleads not guilty and wife's cruise ship killing. Oh my God. Geez. If they, if they figure out, ah, can you imagine that? Wow. That's, that's just cruel and unusual punishment. It bad enough you killed somebody. The fact that you would send them to that of a lonely, brutal death. I Utah Man who allegedly brutally murdered his wife last month while onboard and Alaska. Oh, he just, he killed her on, yeah.

Speaker 4:          00:17:13       Fourth.

Speaker 1:          00:17:50       Okay. This dude is accused of first degree murder in the death of his 39 year old wife. Uh, she must've fucking choked her and shuffleboard or something. I'm sorry. A Kennis wife was found dead in her cruise ship cabin on July 25th. That's the couple had a domestic dispute. Oh my God. D there's, you know, they should throw this guy overboard. Jesus Christ said blood was spread throughout the room on multiple surfaces. Who's immediately detained by ship security in a witness said that the, the defendant allegedly told him she would not stop laughing at me. Jesus Christ waterfall. She ridiculing him. You know, it's funny if this was the other way around, I think the woman goes free if, if she just said he was fat shaming her, like she put on some baby weight or something like that and he just, he wouldn't stop laughing at me and I just made me feel like I was small each year over 4,000 men laugh at their recently, not pregnant wise, causing them to feel bad about themselves. Um, okay. He had been acting terrible all night. The source claim adding at some point that evening. He, yeah, she wouldn't stay. Somebody not stop laughing at you. You go for a walk.

Speaker 1:          00:19:39       like what the fuck was going on? How many movies could you make out of that relationship? Like if, if that guy never did anything wrong in his life and she was just so fucking sadistic, sadistic and hits, so gotten into his fucking head that her just laughing at him, Pete, that he fucking snap like that. You know, I'm just playing the other side. I'm just playing devil's advocate here. Interception Sal. Window saints. Go marching in yet that day. Dot. Bada boom. How annoying am I?

Speaker 2:          00:20:48       what happened there. You can't see any grade between the white wide gay scheme. Got out a giant IPAD. It's going to play a little donkey Kong put on a hat. There you go. Hugs all around like the game has been one on the safe side. Is it made of the saints? The uniforms look a little cheap. I don't know what's going on. [inaudible] they take some stripe away in their shirt. It looks like they should be playing on half a field inside a hockey arena. Um, I right drill braise. He's got the ball. Hey hands that off and that guy immediately is tackled. What a waste of a play. One or two to go in the fucking third quarter. You want me to announce the rest of the third quarter for you? Some of you guys like when I do this shit. All right.

Speaker 4:          00:21:39       Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:21:39       Number 29 he's upset. What is he upset about? I Dunno, but a guy with fucking night vision glasses is talking to them. Listen, I just got from the gun range. I didn't see what happened, but I believe in you.

Speaker 4:          00:21:52       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:21:53       29. What the fuck is he doing out there? That's a running back number, isn't it?

Speaker 4:          00:21:58       Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:21:59       Maybe he's mad at, maybe he's mad at case.

Speaker 4:          00:22:03       Okay,

Speaker 2:          00:22:03       get off my case. Keenum sorry. Jubilees drops back to pass over the fucking middle. When those sates get a fucking first down. Woo. Why don't I give a shit about this game? It's literally just cause I told Paul Versey that I thought the states are going to win. That I need this to happen to fill me up in life because I'm a married guy and you know, and the compliments, you know, they're, they're on it. They're on a, Oh, we're, we're on. I'm on like a compliment ration. I get one a season and there's only one season in La. I used to get four a year when I lived in New York. Now I'm out in La. I get about one. Um, how'd he get that job as water, water guy? Like how do you know who's fucking thirsty? Nobody ever points to their mouth. You just kind of walk up. You stick it, you know. All right. I swear to God, the Black Guy. And this commercial looks like they stuck his head on like an eight year old's body.

Speaker 4:          00:22:58       Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:22:59       Um, although I do like this commercial build, nobody gives a fuck. Most people aren't even watching this now. They don't even know what you're talking about. You're literally doing common commentary for fucking Youtube video that doesn't exist while they're listening to your podcast. Get back on the fucking game here. Um, fucking Steelers. What are the, what is what this steel is? How many times are they going to look past the opponent that week? That's, that's, that's what they say it out there. They're saying that they focus too much on the New England patriots because you know, who's kidding who they beat the Patriots earlier this year, you know?

Speaker 4:          00:23:37       Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:23:38       That was a touch. I don't know. You know what I don't understand about, you know, whether it's a catch or whether it's not a catch, is the fact that the ground can't cause a fumble if you're running. But if you're, it can, it can cause an incomplete pass San how it works.

Speaker 4:          00:23:57       I Dunno,

Speaker 2:          00:23:59       I have no idea. But I liked that commercial. I just saw that guy was like, practice in speed skating, like in his living room. That'd be like the latest thing people will get. Rather than reading about nutrition, they'll literally spend like fucking 10 grand on that thing and then they'll have some sort of app where they can project it onto their TV, where they can, you can be, you know, in different speedskating arenas around the fucking world. I saw this picture today on the Internet. It just fuck it. And it made me feel so God damn old. It was this woman, right? Where's that place where people go to vacation? Right? It's like the, the ocean looks absolutely perfect. And then Z, these grass, like the, these huts and the hover out over the water, you know, one tsunami and everybody's dead. Right? But it looks like absolute paradise.

Speaker 2:          00:24:47       Okay. And the picture of this woman, she's in a thong, right leaning on one leg. So her butt cheeks sticking out and she's looking at the huts and over her head, she, she's making, you know, those, that stupid thing where you make the heart with your hands. She's still with that. You know, and that it made me feel so fucking old. It's like what even happened to just go into a fucking unbelievable place and just geeking out and taken a picture of yourself and you have that look on your face like you can't believe you. They're like, she literally used that paradise to enhance her whole fucking like,

Speaker 4:          00:25:29       okay,

Speaker 2:          00:25:30       I don't know what the word is. Her Harness, I dunno, the Selfie just, it just makes everybody act like a dude who doesn't know how to behave when they get their road show. In other words, they behave like myself. What's going on? I stepped out of bounds, eight yards. He picked up eight yards. Oh, I'll tell you right now. You know what I tell you? Who's going to make a big a lot of fucking money? Whoever owns the Kleenex store in the mall of America, it's my prediction that every one of these Minnesota fans are going to fucking at the end of this game, or they're all going to go down to the mall of America and they're going to go into the Kleenex store. They gotta get their own fucking, you know, Kleenex with their own initial on it because everybody's fucking special now. And you could take a Selfie, but how sad you are actually, you know it would be amazing is if the vikings go to the Superbowl, okay. And they play a home game. Ah,

Speaker 5:          00:26:31       ah.

Speaker 2:          00:26:34       Oh. When no saints go marching in there down to the fucking two yard line. You guys like Pete Fountain, okay. Huh? Put on the old gray bonnet. I love Pete. Phone. Fucking always had a killer drummer, right? Played the shit out of the clarinet.

Speaker 4:          00:26:57       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:26:57       You know what I mean? And he's never had any sexual harassment scandals. Um, anyways, plowing ahead here. Oh, Jesus Christ. This fucking guy. There's a guy, he's hurt. Now what happened? What happened to the guy? Does he got to go inside the tent? Well, thank God there's an 80 year old bald white guy to help him off the field. The dude was so short, he couldn't even lean on him. He's probably going to have a separated shoulder. By the time he gets over to that little fucking a little pop tent, they put them in.

Speaker 4:          00:27:31       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:27:31       Um, hey, I think I found the MP three player that now that I'm seeing this poor bastard with the umbilical cord hanging on, I'm getting out of the apple world, right as I said that, that Weirdo just stared at me in the galaxy commercial. Like he knew I was going to fucking do it. Um, I'm going to get a new, uh, NP, I'm going to go with one of those. Sonys

Speaker 4:          00:27:54       yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:27:54       You know, and I want to tell you guys the exact model so you can be like, dude, oh my God. Really? You're going to buy? Yeah, I am. I am. Because I have a bunch of music, but I didn't get on fucking a apple and those round building costs. Okay. But the forest in the middle with a reeducate their employees that want to ask for more money or maybe pay the poor bastards that put together their products so they don't jump to their fucking deaths. Uh, how crazy it would be if they still advertise on this podcast after that. Um, yeah, I want to fucking get out of that world. I want to, I'm like, I still want to use this shit, but I suppose I don't like how they were all there. Like fucking a, this is our shit over here. I should only works with our, with our shit. None of about shit works with other people's Shit. Why don't you just shit, you got to buy our other shit to use our shit. Fuck people's other shit. We're going to fucking own everything. I don't say, wait, what is your problem? How many billions of dollars to you? I swear to God at that point. Um, I know a promoted like that, I know promoted like that he wants to make all the money,

Speaker 2:          00:29:06       you know, it's not enough that he's making the most money. He wants to make all the money and it actually gives them joy when, when other people, uh, when other people's, uh, you know, other promoters in his town are not doing well, he'll just say, oh, did you hear about so and sold? They bought I, I took a bath.

Speaker 4:          00:29:28       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:29:28       And I'd be like, ah, I bet that makes you happy. Oh, I fucking love it. Um, anyways, I guess I never gave you guys a Hashtag.

Speaker 4:          00:29:37       Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:29:38       Uh, for the cruise ships. Why don't you guys come up with one? Oh, here comes the tent. The pop up tent. Dick's sporting. Good. All right, let's see a dick. What happened? Did he hit your left ball? You're right, ball. All right, we're going to freeze it here. We're going to do a little fucking put a little desk, sit next on it. And a, I think it'd be all right. All right. Drew Brees hands the ball off. A knee guy runs into everybody. Evidently there was supposed to be a hole there. You know, when I was a kid, I thought that running backs rather than running around the outside, the reason why they ran in the middle's cause they thought they'd get famous for trying to do something so impossible. Um, what do you guys thinks going to happen here? Actually, you already know, I say that they're going to score on third goal,

Speaker 4:          00:30:21       right?

Speaker 2:          00:30:23       Unless they try and run it three fucking times. How about a little play action fake here? Drove for the love of fucking Christ. Oh, by the way, congratulations to Liverpool, Liverpool. Be fucking man city. Cause you guys didn't realize I've been paying attention a little bit to the premier league. That soccer for everybody here at north,

Speaker 6:          00:30:42       it's America. Drew Brees throws a dam and then say it's go ma.

Speaker 2:          00:30:47       Hmm. It's fucking 17 too, mother fucking 13. Oh right. Okay. Case Kate Cascade. [inaudible] he's on the case. Kanombe they must do a bunch of shit like that, right? Anytime. Uh, you know, they always have the punch, right? You must do a bunch of those things. Jesus Christ. This is, that's becoming a tale of two halves. It comes drew Brees. He's going to break their hearts. I'll tell you right now then, there, right now, the last ride on the rollercoaster at the mall of America is happening. There's an overall sadness that is going to descend on that mall right now. There's a bunch of people that do not give a fuck.

Speaker 2:          00:31:33       Okay? Two white guys trying to do a cool handshake. They, uh, I don't know what they just did their, some sort of jerk off fucking motion by drew Brees. Has He gave the okay sign? You know, these are the times. Is it okay that I'm stroking your deck? I think that that's what that meant. I think that was very progressive by drew Brees. Um, all right. If you could tell I'm doing this thing early and I've yet to get any of the advertising. I don't have any fucking, uh, any of the questions or anything. So at some point I'm going to have to fucking hit pause or I could text my fucking guy here to send me the bullshit. Right. That could happen. That could happen. Right. Let me hit pause. You don't listen this fucking crap. Oh, do ya Johnny. Oh, do you? The fuck is going on with the Black Hawks this year.

Speaker 2:          00:32:22       Let me, let me, I got to hit pause and not put you through the shit. All right, I'm back. Oh, you know what I, I was gonna say is if Minnesota wins this game and then goes to the Superbowl and uh, I'm actually a vikings fan from way back in the day, to be honest with you. I don't know why I'm, I'm just being a Douche, right? I, like I said, I just predicted this upset. I don't care if the vikings went, ah, right up the middle for first dad, they're teen oh two to go in the game. He's not, and he's not in like, they didn't just give up 14 points in a row. What a, every fucking guy now acts like they just reinvented football. Look at this. All those people blocked for him. And then when there was finally a fucking guy who could tackle them, then he did. And this guy gets up like he's, he'd ever see Jim Brown get up fucking nod.

Speaker 2:          00:33:09       Oh, the old man, this is, this is what you sound like it, the closer you get to death, you know, he's like, well, why isn't it went away? It used to be case Keenan. He is on a strict no passing diet right now. They saw that last one. They like, fuck this guy just handed off. Now why aren't you nodded? Okay. You're not. No, I don't know if I've got stuff for it that God damn line everybody. Anybody makes a good play at that point. At the name of the back of the Jersey. Anytime they fucking don't make a play that looking for a flag or they run off the field. Anyways, if I can get through this God damn point, if Minnesota actually goes to the God damn Superbowl, it's a fucking home game.

Speaker 3:          00:33:48       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:33:49       All right. Everything there is purple. There's no way you got to have like a prince themed halftime show. Do you think he would have played it and think he would have come to the woulda had to have prince come back? Look at that fucking throat case kingdom shaken off the interception of the saint. Say it's not a catch. They say it's not a catch. Right. Says, oh my God, I can't even deal how fucking great and it's driving me crazy case keyed and everybody stopped shouting, settle down. This is a great fucking throat. Oh, he just drops it right in there. I Dunno. A little bit of wobbly there. In the end, he caught it. But did he catch it long enough? Case Kingdom gets to the, they get it or not in time. Not In time. The challenge flag this degenerate gambling. Looking at head coach. It's fucking wife probably cries herself to sleep. That's such a terrible thing to say. Why would I say that? All right. He's on the ground. He has it. He has it. He has it. He has it. He still has it. If they call this not a fucking catch. Look at a shit. All right. There you go. That's a catch. He's got it. He's got it. He's got it. He's got it. He's got it.

Speaker 3:          00:35:00       He's got it.

Speaker 2:          00:35:03       What are they going to look at? Jesus fucking Christ. How long do you have to have it? Oh my God. Now I got to see this replay. 58 fucking time that he, as you see right there daily as it against his naval and his, his, his fucking happy trail. Um, it's got pleading his case. Take back your Red Hanky.

Speaker 3:          00:35:30       Uh,

Speaker 2:          00:35:32       all right. I know you guys do you guys, I don't think you want to fucking love this. I've really limited my goddamn audience here. Let's talk about fucking, let's limit it even more and I'll talk to my six British fans over there. Um, man city.

Speaker 3:          00:35:46       Oh fuck. Oh Fuck

Speaker 2:          00:35:51       Jesus Christ. It was like a full fucking bottle of water and it's heavy on too. And I fucking hate that shit. Evian. There's minerals in it. Yeah, I can taste it. It tastes fucking weird.

Speaker 3:          00:36:03       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:36:03       The water rushed through a plastic rock. Why does it taste so fucking awful? I, I fucking hate every yard.

Speaker 3:          00:36:10       MMM.

Speaker 2:          00:36:12       Anyways, this was to be like the best bottled water. It tastes like shit. I done. How do I know it's from the French Alps? I answering anything. Poland spring to Disani smartwater. I'll drink that box water. I don't give a shit even though it tastes like you're drinking out of a shoe. Oh, that fucking wet cardboard. I know it's better for the environment, but Jesus Christ,

Speaker 3:          00:36:46       ugh.

Speaker 2:          00:36:48       You know what's the worst was when you were a little kid and you drank out of the garden hose and you didn't realize it was sitting in the sun. You'd had that fucking hot blast of Stale fucking water. They'd probably been in there for a week.

Speaker 3:          00:37:00       Jesus Christ.

Speaker 2:          00:37:03       So you know, they've taken out your fucking small intestine. Um, all right, let's look up this man city shit. All right, man. City Man City lost four to three, to Liverpool. Now. Now for those of you who live in the United States, a Merker of Marg, um, man city evidently was fucking undefeated the whole year. I guess that's really difficult. It's difficult to do on any sports, but I wasn't sure with soccer just seems like you score one goal and the game's over. But I will tell you lately they four to three, seven goals. You've got to love that. Got a fucking love that they lost the Liverpool homer, the fucking Beatles. That's all I know.

Speaker 3:          00:37:43       Yeah,

Speaker 2:          00:37:43       that's all I know about touch shit. Oh, let's talk about, let's talk about dot. Hey, Dani fog case. Kate, I'm sacked. Oh No. He got the ball up, Donald fucking Trump. I got to say something, man, that was a low, that is a low point in modern United States history and that's fucking saying something.

Speaker 3:          00:38:05       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:38:05       You just can't, uh, you know, you know, you just can't, you can't feel it. It's a fairly linear, not even apologize and say, you know, I shouldn't have said it that way, but blah, blah, blah. That was just a fucking like,

Speaker 3:          00:38:20       yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:38:21       I don't know why people still sticking by the guy. What ea she tell it is. All right. This is number two. Guy Number four is going to hold the ball. The little skinny guy, he kicks the ball right down fucking metal. It was one at one horn flash. What? What is the Minnesota Vikings? What is this saints Guide bitching about now?

Speaker 4:          00:38:48       Right?

Speaker 2:          00:38:49       What is he complaining about? I'll tell you right now, okay. If a fuck that fucking apnea, she would've said no catch. Yes. You would've guessed you want. If you just like my wife, you just like my fucking wife.

Speaker 4:          00:39:00       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:39:01       Do you know you're fat? When you can see a Manta Sunday. The windbreaker.

Speaker 2:          00:39:05       Oh, he was saying the guy was down. All right. Nobody cares. Bill. This is one of the worst podcasts I've ever done. I apologize. Okay. And I'm sure you guys will let me know. All right. Oh, so the burrito ended up getting like that. It just sucked. Wasn't wrapped tight or I guess I'm supposed to keep it in the foil. I have no fucking idea. And then the chicken was like overcooked. You don't, this is what happens. This is what happens when you go to a city and you go, you know what? These people are known for this. And then you as a tourist don't know where to go. And you just go out and get one and then you go back to your city with the, the, the wrong information saying, I went there, their burrito's sucked. It didn't take, I could make a better breeder than that. You know, that's like, you know, people go to Chicago, New York and they say that their pizza sucks. It's like, well, who did you hang out with? Will you with people from the city? Did they tell you where the fuck to go? Um, Oh, you know what? I want it to look up because people are sitting there saying, oh, they got it when peach fucking Donald Trump. And it's just like, well, they impeach Bill Clinton. He got impeached. I was like, Holy Shit.

Speaker 4:          00:40:09       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:40:09       Hey, he's going to have to leave. And then he, he didn't, he just, why didn't Bill Clinton leave? And then I'll just write in peach, right, that she gave me. How you spell impeached. There you go. Impeached.

Speaker 2:          00:40:30       If Bill Clinton, why did he finish Cape Bill Clinton was impeached. Why did he finish up? I don't understand how he could have been impeached, but he did not leave office. All right. Being impeached doesn't guarantee the person in peach has to leave office. Here's some historical examples. Uh, the problem with your question is he was not impeached in a way to have to leave office. I see. You really don't understand the difference between impeachment and having to leave office now. You didn't have to be that fucking conti about it. Not True. He wasn't peached for a public official in peach. Well, this is just people arguing. Bill Clinton was acquitted. The Senate did not reach the two thirds majority needed to fully process is impeachment. To further break it down, Clinton was impeached by the House on two charges. The first being perjury, the second being obstruction of justice following this, he was acquitted by the Senate.

Speaker 4:          00:41:22       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:41:23       The impeachment process takes place in two steps. First, the president has to stick a cigar in somebody pussy. No, that's right. First the president, it has to be impeached in the of Representatives. That is the equivalent of an indictment. Ah. Then the president has tried in the Senate with the chief justice of the United States presiding, oh, this is why all the lefties are saying, we got to fucking kill these elections in October so we can get Trump out. I was going, what the fuck are they talking about? So then they could actually indict him in the house and then impeach him in the Senate.

Speaker 3:          00:41:58       Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:41:58       It requires a two thirds vote of the Senate to remove and impeachment. You think if he got impeached, right? If it went to the Senate and he got impeached, like I actually think that he would leave before they took the vote. He would get on his own fucking plane and he would just leave and he'd be on the like just so his ego could handle it. Like, you know, you're not going to come walking in here and have me pack up my shit and have me escorted out like I just get fired at, you know, some fucking corporation. All right? I haven't been, I don't take the amount of time that I take to comb my hair over the top of my fucking head to be treated this way. All right. Seven deadly. They fucking didn't think the guy was down.

Speaker 3:          00:42:41       Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:42:41       I'm literally commentating a game that you already know the results of that you're not watching. This is the stupidest fucking thing I've ever done. All right? I'll be honest with you. I'm just, I'm fucking lonely. Okay. I just felt like talking to somebody can, can you guys just be there for me? All right. The fucking fucking guy did his God damn job. He hit it twice. Hey, how about a round of applause for the person who's making the field goal kickers, helmets. Now they finally, you know, they gave him like two bars.

Speaker 3:          00:43:10       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:43:10       You know I went back in the day, they just had that like Fred Cox, Joe size been all those guys just had that one bar across the front of their fucking, I mean I dunno. I Dunno how those people survived. All right. You know it. This is going to be a mercy pause right here. I'm going to just wait for the all the information to come from my fucking podcast so I can actually do this. Okay. Yes. We'll send over in five getting advertising now. Alright. I still got advertising. Um, all right, I'll talk to you two seconds here.

Speaker 3:          00:43:45       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:43:45       All right. I'm back and I got all the materials I need here. By the way, all when does say it stayed fucking scored again? They were up by one point. That's where I am in the game. They just, Vikings just got a pass interference call with number 19 or some shit on the vikings who has the smallest shoulder pads I've ever seen in my life. Remember the eighties, how big fucking shoulder pads were? What do they make those things out of now? I guess if everybody has small ones, then it's a fucking, it's a fair game. Oh, by the way. So basically what happened with Bill Clinton was he got indicted in the House of Representatives and then when it went to the Senate, the, I needed two thirds of the vote and none of the Democrats voted to impeach him. So that's how we got off the liberals look the other way with the sexual harassment.

Speaker 2:          00:44:40       And you know, it's all just politics. It's not like one side's better than the other. If it was a Republican, they would have voted the, oh, they all would have voted the exact fucking opposite way, except maybe one or two fucking actually decent human beings. Um, Eh, the result. But, so Bill Clinton got acquitted, but he did lose his license to practice law because of that. That fucking unbelievable unfuckable would have. Oh, I, one of the hardest things I think is to become a lawyer. Just all like, like trying to pass the bar and all of that. You go through all of that shit and then what do you do? You stick a cigar. It's some fucking woman's pussy. That is it. Your wife and then you lie about it. And then all that studying goes right out the window. Jesus Christ. I love cigars and I love women, but I'm telling you if I learned anything, you got to keep them separate. All right? Okay, let's do some advertising here. Uh, three reads. All right, honey.

Speaker 2:          00:55:29       I had been a big fan of the podcast and you stand up for several years now. I am writing you to tell you that I owe you a lot. Oh Jesus. Look at this. It was about a year ago. I heard you first say that every now and then you would look into the mirror and call yourself a tub of fuck. I do. I thought it was hilarious and it made me realize I was at top of fuck as wealth. Look at that. We're bonding.

Speaker 1:          00:55:53       MMM.

Since last February, I have woken up every morning and told myself that I am a tub of fuck. I made my phone wallpaper, a picture of me when I was at my heaviest two 55 so whenever I unlock my phone there was a reminder of the tub of fuck I am and no longer want to beat. That's great. I'm proud to announce that I have lost 70 pounds in

Speaker 1:          00:56:24       11 months. Dude, that's awesome. And honestly, I owe you a big thanks for giving me the motivation to do this because of you and Joe Rogan, probably more Joe Rogan. He's actually a shape. I have done a lot of things in the last year that have taken me out of my comfort zone. You've been a great inspiration in my life in many different ways. Hope you and the loving Neil and the baby have a great 2018 from one tub of fuck to another. Go Fuck Yourself.

Speaker 3:          01:09:03       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:09:04       How do I follow this up with questions? I just did all of that. Now my next question, do you miss the Prius? I swear to God. That's the question.

Speaker 3:          01:09:14       MMM.

Speaker 1:          01:09:17       Oh, now they're going to clear the field. We have to fucking kick the extra point. The saints are gone. Now they got to come out of the locker room. Can you imagine if the guy just fucked that play a block, this extra point and ran it back for a touchdown? That would be like watching a tosh point. Oh. Like, you know when he has the people be able to do the redemptions without needing tosh point. Oh, it'd be a self contained episode. Um, alright. Hang on a second. Let me fucking get my password in here. Let me read this Prius. Think while we're waiting. Uh, okay. Do you miss the Prius? What up Billy Buick? I actually love a Buick back in the day. I love [inaudible]. You know when, when a Cadillac was a Cadillac and a Buick was like, you know, you weren't quite a Cadillac guy. I wonder if this would have put them at least in field goal range, the worst fucking attempt ever at a fucking, the fact that that guy is a safety. Oh my God, I don't fight. I seen a lot of shit. I have seen a lot of shit.

Speaker 1:          01:10:39       What the fuck anyways. Do you

Speaker 3:          01:10:41       hmm.

Speaker 1:          01:10:43       I know you're thrifty for years while driving your Prius Bill. I was wondering if you still like driving a nicer vehicle or regret spending the money. I'm in the recovery from buying new vehicles. I wasted money for years on new cars and never really got any satisfaction from it. For the past three years I've been driving a 2007 Honda accord. Awesome. And surprisingly, I'm pretty happy with it. Yeah, dude, once you get it paid off, it's a shit. I still have to fight the urge to buy a new ride often anyways, happy new year from down in Alabama. Um, uh, no, cause I didn't buy a nice car till I could afford one. Uh, that's a mistake a lot of people do. You know, the trying to get some lady's attention or whatever the fuck it is or they just love cars so much. Like if you're really, really a car guy, I understand like along the way you're going to have like nice cars, but I was always about paying off my house and getting the bankers off my back. I was into that shit. This is what's fucked up is the saints right now. They have a chance, a very small chance, but they have a chance don't they

Speaker 1:          01:11:52       to block the extra point in return for a touchdown. Can't that fucking happen? Um, anyways, yeah, I was always, I was always way into no debt or working my way towards having no debt. Like, um, I, I just, I can't stress that enough to young people, but when you get like a credit card and all that shit, it's just like be, be really careful with those things and you can't like, um, oh, this is smart. They're just going to go for a two point of conversion and just down the ball so that can't happen. There you go. That's smart. My dumb ass. That's why I don't coach on any level. Um, anyways. The um, yeah, I was, I just was always into like, just not being in debt, you know, it just absolutely paralyzes you and it affects your ability to go after what you want to go after. I've told this story before, like I kept a day job until I moved to New York the first three and a half years. I was a comedian probably the last year. Well actually it's not true cause I was still living at home with my parents. I could have basically, um,

Speaker 1:          01:13:15       you know, said, hey, hey, can you help support me with my dream? And I could have just been sitting around the house, so just making comedy money. But I continued to work and before I moved down to New York, I paid off everything.

Speaker 8:          01:13:29       MMM.

Speaker 1:          01:13:30       I paid off my student loans. I paid off my car, which died right before I went to New York. And I saved up a chunk of money and I just moved down to New York. And, uh, I was never a ramen noodle guy, but I definitely ate a lot of fucking Rigatoni and Spaghetti and shit.

Speaker 8:          01:13:48       MMM.

Speaker 1:          01:13:51       And I just did that. So, um,

Speaker 3:          01:13:54       okay.

Speaker 1:          01:13:55       When I finally got it, when I finally bought myself a nice car, I could afford it and felt like I earned it. And um, yeah, I loved it. But I also love the Prius. The Prius is a fucking great car, you know, cheap as shit to fucking own. It's never a problem. You Park it wherever you want.

Speaker 2:          01:14:12       No one's trying to steal a fucking Prius. You know, I always joked like you don't, once mine was like eight or nine years old, I literally could leave that thing on with the door open in the middle of a fucking, you know, riot and no one would take it. Like, you know, you know, whenever they do the trap car, I try to get people to steal that car. They, they've never, I will be willing to bet they never did that with a fucking Prius. Now I want to know how many of those Viking fan stuck around. You know, some people left, you know that they fucking left and as they were winding down the fucking stairs, they just heard every going, oh my God, Oh my God. And they had to fucking run their fat asses back up there. Congratulations to the vikings. Holy Shit. The Vikings did not win that game. That was a the biggest fuck up I have seen,

Speaker 4:          01:15:02       okay

Speaker 2:          01:15:03       in a long goddamn time. Ah, drew Brees and once again drew Brees to silent assassin. Nobody knows how good that guy is and now he's not going to get to prove in the NFC championship game. Potentially tried to win a super bowl tragedy. All right. Bulletproof glass bullshit. A dear Billy dad bought, you know, that hurts. I was listening to your podcast a while back where you read someone's email concerning owning a store with a bulletproof glass where his grandfather was almost killed and he was outraged at the mandate and claimed the person pushing the bill said, bulletproof windows are racist. I just wanted to point out that it was bullshit. Most people in this country,

Speaker 4:          01:15:45       okay.

Speaker 2:          01:15:46       Who get outraged over things are oftentimes just misinformed. And because we live in a consumer culture where the customer is always right. No, they're not.

Speaker 2:          01:15:57       That's old school. The customer is not right. The customer can go fuck themselves and talk to a fucking robot on the phone. If you're bleeding to death, the press to the mindset has transitioned to politicians saying the citizens are hardworking, honest, honorable Americans rather than saying the truth. Most citizens are ignorant, entitled tribal mouth, tribal mouth breathers. Sir, I don't know at what point in political history politicians were saying that. They never said that either. So you're kind of speaking in hyperbole, I believe is the expression. Uh, but I understand what you're saying. Um, you're trying to build up your point. This is the bill that was proposed regarding bulletproof windows. Um, I have not fucking reading all of that. Uh, it's re regarding restaurants and no other places of business. So that person that wrote you in fear of having his bulletproof glass band is basically an outrage over nothing.

Speaker 4:          01:16:50       Okay.

Speaker 2:          01:16:51       Oh, in outrage and outrage, you mean? No D it, it doesn't even affect him or his grandfather. Well, that's good. It was never called racist. We want to make sure that there isn't this sort of indignity, in my opinion, to serving food through a Plexiglas only in certain neighborhoods. What? That doesn't make sense. Well, who are you to say it's indignant? I, you know what, that's, that's sneaky writing right there. You're going to get offended for people. I don't understand what's going on here. I don't know. It was never called racist.

Speaker 2:          01:17:32       We want to make sure that there isn't this sort of indignity, in my opinion, to serving food through a Plexiglas only in a certain neighborhoods. Well, whenever I was doing gigs and bad neighborhoods and they had that follicle bulletproof glass, I always looked at it. Okay, heads up. Keep your head on a swivel. I appreciated it being there. I didn't feel like fucking, I dunno what you tried to do here, but I am in favor of hurting some people's feelings. If it keeps people who want to just have the honest job of working at a restaurant alive, um, I would be in favor of it. I don't think it's plexiglass is, is it? Plexiglass stops a bullet. I don't fuck it though. Um, that's from Philadelphia. Council woman. Cindy Bass. All right, let's look up Cindy. Cindy can be your friend. Three 10. She's your fucking council man. Why does it always take me to fucking Wikipedia now?

Speaker 2:          01:18:37       Oh, what the fuck? Where are we Cindy bass images. Cindy Bass appears to be African American. All right, so this person was saying that she was being racist. Now, according to some people, it's impossible for a black person to be ray. I don't even know what the fuck is going on right now. I don't know. All I know is if I worked in Oh God damn restaurant and somebody nearby had shot someone in a restaurant to the point that somebody felt that they needed to be some fucking glass up there, uh, I would want it. But who the fuck am I to say what people need in their neighborhood?

Speaker 2:          01:19:12       Ah, well how the fuck did I get signed out of that thing? Hey, when it's signed you out as it goes, you want to make a report? No, I don't have time for that shit like Kuwait where it's time to do that. Um, I was trying to do a podcast and you know who it was, so nobody's showing dope. Um, it was never called Kate. While I still don't agree that any type of business should be mandated to remove a type of security for whatever it was. Websites like steadfast and loyal.com that wrote bulletproof glass is now racist in their title. However, you know what, I actually understand what you're saying here. Cause that type of shit happens to comedians all the time where they just, you know, if they float something out there, Huffington Post, and then they try to get you in trouble or make it more sensationalized so they can get views. Uh, however, in the body of the article, they admitted that the council woman never used those words. But of course, most people don't read beyond this article. Yeah, see, I mean, that's the Internet. There's really no, uh, there's no libel. There's no, there's none. I cannot fucking, I got to hit with this guy said,

Speaker 2:          01:20:30       uh, God cared. God cared that this Guy Yeps God care and the other guy had too much devil in him, Debbie other that the safety on the saints. He prayed to the devil. That's what happened in the devil. Misled to tackle air, to tackle his own fucking teammate. Uh, I know you're a comedian and not some fucking political spot it, so it's not like I'm trying to hold you up to some Barbara Walters type of standard, but I know some people in your audience forget that and believe everything they read and everything they hear that feeds into what they already believe. Like you said, I am bright.com. Yeah, well dude, nobody's coming to this fucking website to become informed. Okay. Um, don't put that on me. Okay. I did not pursue that, which is why I became a comedian. All right. I tried to Siri, the serious world. It didn't fucking work out for me. I failed miserably. Okay. Failed my wife. All right, dear Billy buddy guy. My wife and I had been married for a year and a half. We both have a child from prior relationships and a seventh month old Jada together. She's an angel by the way. Of course she is. She is Latina and I only bring that up because she fits all the fiery stereotypes. Both good and bad. She completes my life with this. Although arguments can get very difficult.

Speaker 2:          01:21:48       Dude, I thought you were talking about your seven month old. That's fucking hilarious. She went right into that. I thought you're good. You already have an arguments with a seven month old and she's fiery, blah blah blah. Fucking talking. Jibberish okay. Your wife. Okay. She's Latina and I only bring that up because she fits all these stereotypes. She completes my life. I Blah Blah Blah. I have some of the same temper issues that you use to describe yourself and your bit about kneeling on the ball when I'm right has paid off huge. Uh, so thank you for that. Yeah. I wish I should probably rewatch that bit cause I have not been doing that lately. I've been airing it out. Anyway to cut to the chase, we decided together to fight for primary custody of my son. The case is very complicated, but for the sake of everyone listening, I'll summarize it with his few details as possible.

Speaker 2:          01:22:40       In family court before appearing in front of a judge, there is a conference where a meteor mediator tries everything they can to make sure you can come to an agreement and avoid a judge. Deciding, my wife and I had a plan going in to not cut a deal with my ex at the conference and hold out for a judge to rule on custody. However, I had no idea the level of pressure that they'd be able to put me and I buckled under it and made a deal for the next year. Then I had to go home and explain to my wife that I had failed our plan. I don't know if you've ever completely disappointed your woman, but this is the worst feeling in the world. Well, wait a minute. She's going to judge you because they probably used your love of your own kid right against you.

Speaker 2:          01:23:27       Anyways, and as you can imagine over the past day or so, she's cutting me into me. It just about every opportunity for all the little failures and I can see it right in and arise that are man had a moment of weakness and didn't come through in the clutch. Worse is that she absolutely hates my ex and feels like I let her get the better of me. US. Yeah. You know, I kinda had a feeling. Yeah. Okay. All right. Oh Geez. You're in the middle of that. You're in the middle of the two ladies. You have ever disappointed you're a woman with a grand fuck up. Yeah. About every three days. I guess a good boxing analogy is that my hands are down and I don't know how long to let her continue jabbing at me until I put them back up. Thanks. And Go fuck yourself. Uh, I wouldn't take another ounce of shit from her. I, you, you just sit down and talk to her and be like, wait a minute. I'm trying to get my kid back. I'm going back with all of this emotion. Wait, let me make sure this is

Speaker 3:          01:24:25       okay.

Speaker 2:          01:24:26       You decided together to get primary custody of your son. Now who's idea was that? Was that totally yours or was the hatred your wife has of your ex wife played into the thing? Um, I don't know, Dude. I don't know what's going on, but it sounds when it went into my head. Okay, now no notice. No that everything that you say is now perverted cause it went into my brain. As I say, once you say something, it's not what you said anymore. It's cut with the other person's experiences. It's like drugs that have been stepped on. What you said was pure cocaine. Now it's in my head and there's all this x selects, fucking laxatives, getting fucking put it. Um, all I hear is that your wife, uh, your current wife presents your previous fucking wife and uh, she's doing that woman thing where they don't solve things with their fists. They tried to fucking make, they just

Speaker 3:          01:25:24       okay.

Speaker 2:          01:25:24       Do that thing where they tried to make the other woman as miserable as they possibly can and she knows probably how much it would break.

Speaker 3:          01:25:31       Okay.

Speaker 2:          01:25:31       Your ex, why it's hard to lose a primary custody of your son. And she really wanted to do that to her because that would make her feel better and more secure in your relationship. I don't fucking know. I have no idea too. There's too many fucking variables here. But um, I wouldn't take an ounce of shit if I had a son from a previous marriage and you know, I was trying to do what you were doing and then I caved under that pressure. My wife won't understand it and if she ever gave me shit, I would be stunned. And then I would fucking read her the riot act and I would go out to a bar and have a couple of cold ones there. That's what I would do. Okay. Now I get into a lot of arguments in my relationships. We probably don't want to listen to me. I have no professional background. Okay? I'm the type of man that once that already types out, dude, I called it with 25 seconds left in fucking jinx is the saints. Maybe it was my fault. Um, all right. I don't know what the fuck that was, but he can't say it wasn't compelling. If you're a football fan, everybody else, I apologize to, uh, go fuck yourselves and I'll check in on, yeah, on a Thursday.
