Speaker 1:          00:00:02       Hey, what's going on? It's bill burn. It's time for the Thursday afternoon. Just before Friday. Monday morning podcast. And I'm just checking in on you. All right? I can't even tell you what a great mood I was in seven minutes ago, seven minutes ago. Everything was fucking fine. And then what happens? What happens in my whole technology fucking world? Just it just, you know, Internet's not working. I got to go into the one room in my house where the Internet works for whatever fucking reason. Uh, you know, it's a cloudy day. Uh, you gotta upgrade your fucking something or other, you know, all I wanted to see, you know, I found out that Liverpool lost the cup final and I know what all you assholes and doing the fuck do you find out now? You know why? You know, I just found out now because I have American Internet.

Speaker 1:          00:00:55       Okay. Do you know how many pages I have to scroll through to find fucking soccer highlights and meet? It's after the Germans scat films. Okay. That's where the fuck it is in this country. And by the way, I found out that most solid guy got his shoulder yank out by some content, the other team. And, and good luck trying to find a video of the actual God damn play. I swear to God, I want to fucking find every content out there that is acting like they have the video. Do you don't, one of the websites I went to head it had the silence of the crowd. That was the video. I don't know. I see that. I want to see the injury. Fuck. I want to sit there and look at some fat cunt crying over his fish and chips. I want to see what happened. Cause this, the picture that I saw looked like that guy grabbed adi, pulled the Kelly Olynyk you fucking grabbed onto the thing and fucking yanked it out.

Speaker 2:          00:01:52       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:01:54       Anyways, uh, I mean, what, what kind of fucking world do you live in? Okay, we'll you're trying to get more money off of advertising by pulling some shit like that. Swear to fucking God will get legal. We'll have fun. Edge babbled. We'll have them walking out of the stadium with his fucking arm in a sling. Hey, you got you got, you got the Zapruder film. Oh yeah, we got it. You know, what do they do? They show somebody fucking with it. They hand over their mouth. They don't show the actual fucking assassination.

Speaker 1:          00:02:33       God, I was in such a good fucking mood since such a great mood. You know, I woke up, daughter woke me up. Who's kidding? Who Right. Made a breakfast as I always do. We had a great time. We sang the Itsy bitsy spider 5,000 times. I was in a great mood and then for whatever reason, my stupid recorder, the metronome got turned on. I did not turn that off. So, uh, rather than relaxing and trying to figure it out, I broke my headphones. Can you believe this? This all all unraveled. You don't, my wife loved me seven minutes ago. I'm turning 50 and I'm still behaving like this. I just broke one of my toys, like a goddamn toddler. Do you guys realize that? That's you? You're listening to a child? Maybe that's why God had me go bald because I was acting like a baby. He wanted me to look like

Speaker 3:          00:03:25       one

Speaker 1:          00:03:26       big old baby, a big old bearded baby. I should be down in Coney island. Right. And they should just have me one of the cages next to the bearded lady and just have me trying to fucking figure out something that involves any remote basic technology. You know, look at that big all angry baby. He's 50 years old, but you wouldn't know it. Just watching me breaking fucking headphones and recorders. Ah God. And I'd love to tell you that turned 50 is this profound thing and that I'm going to change, but I swear to God I'm not all going to be, I'm going to be breaking my walkers when I'm fucking 90. Alma said 80 and then I bumped it up to 90 cause I just said walkers. Um, just no fucking way, you know, speaking of which, um, I'm back to working out to get yet another time attempting with the shoulder. Cause I, I'm impatient, I moved to up too quickly and weight and I reactivate my shoulder. I don't hurt it again, I just aggravate it. But, uh, I really do miss, I miss working out and lifting weights and all that shit. Get a little pump going, you know, so I'm doing it with very lightweight, like put it this way. This is how light the dumbbells are. Uh, my dumbbells are, are like pink baby blue. I have one pound. It's a girls. I have, uh, three pounds. It's a boy.

Speaker 1:          00:04:52       All right. Are those no, I don't wait. No. Two pound, two pounds or purple.

Speaker 1:          00:04:58       I got the purple rain to pounders the, it's a girl, one pounder. And then I got the, it's a boy, five pounder, and then I got a six pound color. They're orange. All right. It's like I'm living, I'm working out with Fisher price weights here. Um, anyways, but I got that TRX band and that thanks kind of been saving me a little bit. Um, it's weird. I can't, like, I can't bring weighed up to the side and up to this side, w like much more than three pounds is out reaggregate my shoulder. But for some reason I could do 50 pushups.

Speaker 4:          00:05:40       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:05:42       I don't know why I just told you that. Cause now every person was even remotely a personal trainer. You know, they're gonna start giving me advice. You can't bring up dogs working out or uh, I don't know. Something else. How to shade your beaver. I don't, I don't fucking off. You need three examples. I'm sorry. I choked. I ran out of out of thinks they're anyways, do you, have you guys been watching the Stanley Cup final? Not Finals, the NBA finals start tonight, but the standing Stanley Cup final, the first two games in Las Vegas. And I gotta tell you something I really wanted to hate on the intro that the vikings, the Vikings thought the nights the Vegas Knights had that game of Thrones shit that they were doing. Uh, but I get it. I get it. It's Vegas. They got to put on a show. They can't have strippers out there cause there's kids there.

Speaker 1:          00:06:34       It was a kid friendly Vegas show. I thought that shit that they were doing on the ice was amazing. But, uh, it was kind of funny how I remember in the NBA when guys would dunk, Aka black guys would dunk and then they would do make that, that motion across the neck. Like we just slit your throat. And they were like, that's too violet. That A, is that a gang side? They can't do that Eddie by right. And then you turn on hockey. It's a basically a bunch of white people there out there dressed like nights. They're not even miming going across the neck. They literally have a fucking sword right across the neck. Does all those kids there? You know what I mean? Maybe because he's dressed up like a a night or something. Maybe, you know, I have no fucking idea. But anyways, uh, the games have been outstanding. Uh, it's really hard to root against the Vegas Knights with that story, whatever that GM or that coach said at the beginning of the year than being an expansion franchise. He said to the players, all of you are here for the same reasons. Whoever you were just playing with tin think you are worthy of being protected. Something like that. And that's like the beginning of all those fucking movies. What, you know, they're going to win the championship, you know,

Speaker 1:          00:07:47       sneak away from the Nazis like that Sylvester Stallone movie where they played soccer. Right. That's what the, how this whole thing's playing out. But, uh, I've become a capitals fan just because, uh, been hanging with Josh Adam Meyers all these years, so I got a root for his capitals. Plus they've been waiting since 1974. Who gives a shit? It's been great hockey. I loved, uh, the shootout in game one. Um, as far as 10 goals being scored, I was blown away by how fast uh, Vegas was and just how relentless there for check was. But, um,

Speaker 1:          00:08:25       and I did like that the, uh, capitol stuck up for Tj, Yoshi and knocked that one guy in the nights on his fucking ass, uh, which he got off easy by the way, compared to what the fuck you guys have been through and to a t j Oci. They just decided that we're just going to fucking go after this guy. Huh? Is that what it is? Because he's getting facewash slash boarded crosschecked end. He finally fucking snapped and takes a dump penalty. What's that guy? Well, set needs to come and beat the fuck out of somebody. But I loved how the capitols in the second game played a really physical game and they slowed them down. And um, and Jesus Christ, that fucking safe. That is the save of that might've saved. Like if the capital's win the Stanley Cup, he got us today, right there, that, that, that fucking saved.

Speaker 1:          00:09:15       They go, they go back to Washington. I'm going to go out on a limb here and say really obvious stuff out there. They got a big uphill climb to escape, although the Cavalier's foot down o two to the Celtics and came back at one four out of five. Oh God am I see when the red sox lost to the mets and 86 we won the first two. You realize that if you win, the first to the other team has to have to win four out of the next five and all you gotta do is go two and three and you're fucking blow it. Oh, it hurts. Um, hats off to the Vegas crowd. I got to give it up. You know, the NHL chose so many wrong cities throughout the years, you know, to try to get excitement going. You know, Carolina, Phoenix, Atlanta, I mean, you know, Miami, it just, you know, and I just was, I was of that mindset of what the fuck are they doing? You know, why don't you just put one in mobile, Alabama, nobody gives a fuck about this shit. You're going down into basketball and football, country stock, car racing in moon moon shining. Well, you know, I mean they, they would rather stand along the Appalachian trail and cheer on a hiker, then go to a fucking hockey came south of the Mason Dixon line. That was my, my belief and my God, am I fucking a, I'm quoting Paul and Scott, that's mad.

Speaker 1:          00:10:47       Dabbin Jip. Um, but I, I stand corrected because I got to tell you something. Fucking Nashville in Las Vegas, the level that the fans are going crazy in the stands, that they're going more nuts than anybody in the original six. Granted we understand the game more so we don't have to fucking scream and yell like that, but I think the Trifecta is going to be Seattle as much as I trashed him earlier. Those are great fans in Seattle. They don't need any help to be any louder than they already are. But I will always contest the volume of that football stadium cause I went to a home game there and people were just chatting before the game and I was like, this is really fucking loud. And people just talking normally. Um, anyways, it was like that fucking Metallica album would, they made it like louder than 10. The one that looked like a coffin in a pussy on the, on the, on the, uh, the album cover you had to like halfway up and it was still blowing your eardrums out. Did the owner of the Seahawks produce that one better? Um, anyways, uh, I don't know. I'm just think that that's going to be this research and, and resurgence after some missteps and some of these cities by the NHL. And I don't think that it will ever quite go mainstream though. You know? I actually watched game one at this cigar butt. Oh look who's here. The lovely Nia. What's that? Who's that from your agent when the one of the batteries for her little uh, toy going to come?

Speaker 1:          00:12:31       Yeah, they are like watch batteries. She has this little creepy little purple monkey that she absolutely loves and it just freaks me out. It's like this. It's something you'd seen a horror movie right with that high pitched voice? Yeah. It's fucking head spinning around. Stays on your finger. Can you, can you close the door near so she doesn't hear all my feel filthy talking here. Oh, bringing red. Bring a red. Oh, it's the kid hour

Speaker 1:          00:13:03       she's coming in. Oh, the itsy bitsy spider went up the water spot of saying this thousand times today, Dow came the rain and washed the spider out. Hi. Can you say hi? Can you say hi? Yeah. Yeah, go. Can you say, can you say Dada? Say Mama. Yes. Right. You know where your bread's buttered. Can you say Mama? There you go. Can you say baby you go, can you say thanks? Can you say please? Can you say dog? What else should she, she could say, Hi Dad. Nice. Very. Hi Mama. Yeah, that's right. No love for Mama. My favorite thing, I love that I get the mornings are mine, but with her. Ah, that's right. I wake, I wake, you wake me up a change a diaper. If we give you your Baba, right. And then I always make a breakfast. That's right. Jitsu breakfast. And after every bite she has to go. Yeah. Yeah. Um, yeah. What did you think about what the capital's didn't game to how they, uh, oh my God, it was a real showing and saw you. They got out there and they played that game and I was like, whoa. Can you say whoa? Wow. Yeah. She likes you. The bubbles, those little bubble things. She likes, she blow the bubbles. She likes to run into them and break them with their face and go, whoa. Bubbles. Right. You like bubbles.

Speaker 1:          00:15:13       Um, all right, so nia, can you, can you break down for the white audience? What's going on with Drake and push your tea? I actually listened to the song, I'm like, all right. So, you know, he knocked up a porn star, allegedly, allegedly, uh, this isn't going to end with a gun battle, is it? No, that is not. No, that's not, a lot of those guys are, those days are over by that. Oh, it is. Okay. No more gangster. You shot me in my live or you shot me. You shot me. Like I, that guy drives me up the wall. No push. See had, I can't listen to Drake that took shots at Drake. Drake shout back, Pusha t shot back and Pusha t shot back in a way that was even more devastating than Drake's. Do you ever listen to white music when that happens?

Speaker 1:          00:16:09       Uh, white music when, what happens? Uh, answer songs, whatever, giving each other crap, but whatever. Do you know what the original one was as far as I know, the original one? Uh, well maybe it was the Flintstones when they had bug music. Bug Music. I can't stand bug music. Yeah, yeah, yeah. He said, yeah. Yeah. You remember that episode? They will. They were trashing the Beatles and the Beatles never answered it. They were above. I'm kidding. The, uh, the first, the first one was a Neil young made a song called southern man. Okay, good. Tom Petty trashing them? No, no, no, no, no, no. Sweet Home Alabama. Okay. Is An answer song. Okay. It's all in the thing. I hope Neil young will remember southern man. Don't need them around anyhow. Sweet home, Alabama, you know, and they, they never, uh, they never shout at each other anything. Wait, why are you being an asshole? Because you're like, wow. Yeah. Wow. Heatedly that's impressive. Why are you being an a hole? I don't know what happened. Neil young and who saying, all right, I'm done with you. Leonard Skinner, lynching and skin. And what is it? You're always unit. Did you hear her? She just talked to me. That's the way she talks to it. Like wait, staff people going out to eat with you. It's just like, oh my God.

Speaker 1:          00:17:37       Telling you. Oh my gosh, you get so upset when I say that. Leave. Oh, I think, uh, yeah. Jesus. What just happened? What happened? I'm glad I'm not on watch because she just heat this backup cause this was, yeah. Oh, I'm going to tease you out of that. Bye. Bye.

Speaker 5:          00:18:03       Why? Why?

Speaker 1:          00:18:12       All right. She gets so mad at me when I bring that up. Um, anyways. Yeah. I actually listened to the song, the Pusha t song so I could be informed about what was going on and uh, you know, I thought he brought up a lot of points and a, I don't know my answer song be like, Ya. Yeah, I banged a porn star. We got a kid and it's costing me a lot of buddy.

Speaker 1:          00:18:38       Anyways, I still got enough of my own Lamborghini. I Dunno what, what, what, what do you say? What do I have no idea? What am I talking about here? Why? Why can somebody please send me the video of this most solid guy getting a, this, this cheap shot here. That is what happened, right? Because I was thinking, how the hell do you separate your shoulder playing soccer? You're not allowed to use your hands. I would think like the one thing that never happens is you don't have any fingers, hand, wrists, any of that type of stuff. Injuries in soccer, right. Although with all the diving, I'm sure you know, if you dove a little too hard, maybe you could break your wrist. Why do I trust soccer? I actually really, really starting to enjoy it. I have no idea why. You know, why I started off?

Speaker 1:          00:19:26       I was in a crabby mood. I just tease my wife about the fact that she, um, you know, is less than cordial to wait staff. You know what's funny is when she goes into a restaurant, she becomes me, which is she has expectations of people and when they're not met she like, you know, gets a fucking attitude. I'm not saying she starts throwing plates or anything like that, but good Lord. Um, anyways, uh, let me read some of the advertising here for this this week. This is an offer Thursday, isn't it? Hey.

Speaker 1:          00:30:24       That's my doctor Phil. Um, right now I'm copying and pasting that wine advice, uh, wine town advice to my wife too, my wife. Um, why did I give a shit about being rude to the wait staff? You know, why? Cause she always trashes me and my behavior. I'm going to use that in the future when you start treating the people and in and out burger a little nicer. Maybe I will work on my attempt, but you know what's so weird about ft? Ft you flip up and then you calm down and then you just looking at your broken headphones on the floor.

Speaker 1:          00:31:00       It's just that sadness, you know, why did I do that? Where's the other piece of plastic that used to hold this thing in? Um, anyways, that's 31 minutes. I wouldn't say it was inspired, wasn't inspiring podcasting today. It was kind of, you know, I kind of fed off the energy of the weather, which is a little bit Thad. Um, I'm going to be running my hour around La, wherever I can get up. I'll be doing 10 minutes spots, 20 minutes, boy, fuck, I can do it. Getting ready next week for Dublin in London, England. Um, some people would ask me, why aren't you playing more cities over there? Uh, it's because I'm going over there for my birthday. That's why. And I'm doing two quick shows and um, and then I'm going to just, you know, turned 50, I guess. I don't know what the fuck I'm doing, but I'm definitely going to come back and um, I dunno, maybe next year or something like that.

Speaker 1:          00:32:08       I want to go back and do a, a toy like I did the last time. Um, except I dunno, I just, you know, I got the kid now, so I don't know how long I could go over there for. And there is just something weird leaving the country with your wife and kid. You know, maybe I could bring them along. Maybe I'll do that. Maybe that's the fucking move. Maybe I'll, I'll, I'll, I'll do it that way. Um, you know what, I'm getting off the phone and I'm talking to my agent right now. How about look at that. It just worked that out right in front of you guys. Uh, that's how much thought I put into my career. I just talked to myself while talking to you guys and there you go. Look at my broken headphones. I'm sorry, headphones. Now I'm going to have to throw you out because you know they don't make that plastic piece there.

Speaker 1:          00:32:54       It's going to end up in the fucking ocean floating around. They didn't even have to be out there. I kept these things so long that they like, like the shit was flaking off, you know, that goes up and over your head and people always be like, you got something on your head. It's like, oh, it's just the spongy shit from my old headphones. I'm sorry, old headphones. You know, this is like when somebody kills their wife like fucking 50 years into the marriage, you know, a fit of rage. I feel really bad right now. Are you comparing women to inanimate objects? Uh, yes I am. All right, that's the podcast. I have a great weekend. [inaudible] can somebody please send me the video? Dee Dee got a flip phone video of most solid get in his fucking shoulder yanked out. I just want to see if it's his filthy as the pictures.

Speaker 3:          00:33:39       All right. That's it. Have a wonderful day.

Speaker 8:          00:33:50       No. Was God Danton God and come back. I turned from black and white was from Gaza and smash.

Speaker 3:          00:34:17       Oh

Speaker 1:          00:34:29       mmm.

Speaker 9:          00:34:31       Here's something that I actually read a quote from one of these magazines. I guess evidently a Clint Eastwood was hyping that movie. Gran Gran Torino. I don't know if you guys have seen that movie. I'm sure you see any ads for it. Where he basically is. I get up late a lot and you fucking person of another race. I'm a white man and I represented my car represents back when America was good in the early seventies. Um, I guess when he was doing the interview for that movie, uh, he called I guess the current generation, the pussy generation. And at first it made me laugh and I'm thinking like, yeah, Clint Eastwood obviously has earned the right to call people pussies. And I'm thinking, wait a minute, Cleese was, is an actor.

Speaker 9:          00:35:25       Okay. Who plays tough guys who never loses a fight? Rarely any of it. If he does lose a fight in a movie, it's a fake fight. So at the risk of making second sack religious comment, first trash and the Great Mickey Mantle, uh, now I'm going to go off to Clint Eastwood. Unlike where has Clint Eastwood, I want it. This is my question for you guys this week. Where's Queenie's would god off like where's he earned the right that he's this tough guy? Cause like he plays a tough guy. I've known one. Understand that with like actors, like I remember like after nine, 11, like, um, for some reason they wheeled out Tom Hanks and like that was supposed to make me feel relaxed as an American. And I remember during that time I was doing a joke on stage going and talking about Tom Hanks saying he's done so many army movies.

Speaker 9:          00:36:18       He thinks he's a veteran. You know what I mean? It's not like you did army well, but he played an astronaut. He was in saving private Ryan. You know what I mean? And like all of a sudden like he becomes like a, all these guys, like I said, you know, here's, here's one for you. I got fucking, you know, friends out here. So we're doing the touristy shit out here in La and I take them down to Mann's Chinese theater or grooming's, whatever the fuck they calling it now. And they got those, uh, they got the hand prints in the feet prints and the, uh, footprints there in the, uh, the cement. And I found John Wayne. I swear to God, John Wayne had the smallest fucking feet I've ever seen him. I couldn't believe it. This is the Duke John Wayne. This is the guy. Everyone's one.

Speaker 9:          00:37:04       Just thought if even breathed on you, he fucking knock you in into next week. This guy had like, I think he went to fucking lady gap to buy his cowboy boots. He's fucking the smallest fucking things. He could have fit both his boots and his cowboy hat. That's how small his fucking Fida. If you ever go to La and you go to Mann's Chinese theater, it's on the right hand side. He had tiny little ass feet, you know, actors a fucking annoying, you know what I mean? Sit. Then they put on fucking leather jackets and they play these bad asses and it's just like, dude, you're a fucking, you're an actor. Have you had any real fights, Clint?

Speaker 9:          00:37:48       Somebody of a fucking rear engine. The drive through at Burger King and you got out and you settled. The score maybe has, I don't know what, but you know, I don't know. I don't know fucking, it just fucking annoyed me and moving on from that, somebody actually sent me an email that kind of ties into this, right? I'm not saying clean is in a tough guy. The guy's fucking ridiculous. He's 80 years old. He's still lifting weights, you know, the way his eyes are squinted. He definitely seems like a bad ass, but you know, I want to see his fight card. I want to see his arrest record. You know, maybe he was a juvenile delinquent before he came up. I Dunno. I haven't Wiki PD them yet.

Speaker 8:          00:38:47       Collide. Explain.

Speaker 10:         00:39:15       Hey, what's going on? It's bill burr and it is the Monday morning podcast for Monday, May 31st, 2010. How the hell are you? Happy Memorial Day. Let's start. Let's, let's start with that. Let's show a little bit of respect. Okay. What are you doing right now? Why don't you get off the fucking Treadmill, Huh? Stared at attention and give a salute to the troops. Seriously. Big shout out. Big shout out half. What am I a hip hop Gj over here. Big Guy. Big hello from America to everybody over there and uh, Iraq, Afghanistan. Where else do we have troops? Germany, right. Still got people over there just in case they start acting up again. You know them. That's what you get. Germany starting a couple of world wars, you know, I'm glad you did it. I'm glad you did it. It gave us a nice rain at the top after you lost for the second time. And then us and Russia, we carved it up and stared at each other for fucking 40 years going, oh yeah, yeah. Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.

Speaker 10:         00:40:21       And then we just like, all right, fuck it. Yeah. And Russia just said, forget it. I think my mom's calling me, I got to go, but you know, fuck you. Anyway. All right. And then they walk away and then we're standing there like, Holy Shit. You mean this is all ours? I mean, technically it's not ours, but there's nobody stopping us. Right. It's like Bo Jackson when he comes around and all of a sudden he just sees 80 yards of fucking green. Okay. You know, Kenny Easley ain't gonna Catch Ya, even though he's got the fucking right angle. It ain't happening. That's what our corporations did. They will like, we are going to put a fucking best buy and every God damn corner of this fucking planet. And we're starting in Iraq because as far as I can tell on my map that looks about the middle. Everybody go at that. Huh? Show of hands. All right then. Oh right dead. Let's fucking rally the troops is the best one out of all the songs. No disrespect to the air force. Army and navy.

Speaker 8:          00:41:28       Okay

Speaker 10:         00:41:29       Udo show us off trip Boli. I'm a stupid fucking man. Red Cans. So I don't know where triple Lee is. What a fuck is Tripoli? That's an a fucking awesome name. They really picked the right fucking city, town or country. When they said tripling. I know it's not a country. Go Fuck Yourself. Are you European snobs or listen to this shit who think you're better, right? Cause you had, you know more about geography and your jeans are tighter. You think you're impressing me? You're not. All right. Bunch of fuck ups. Really. Amy Winehouse, that fucking Pete Doherty Douche bag who's never done anything. His big claim to fame is he looks like paste stumbling down the fucking street and you guys can't get enough of them and you have the fucking balls to look at us like we're a bunch of fat fucks. All right, stand down Europe. This is our day.

Speaker 10:         00:42:31       Ah Shit. So anyways, I was actually supposed to go over to Japan. Right. A little fucking sucky. Now I wouldn't do that. I would not do that. Um, I was going to go over there to go entertain the troops and I don't know what the fuck's going on with that Gig was supposed to be a nice three base. Bang, Bang, boom. Right. I was going to come in in a chopper. I was going to do it up just like an apocalypse. Now I have a couple of chicks coming out. These boots are made for walking right tassels on their titties. America throw some place stations out into the crowd, play a drum solo with some fucking chop sticks, you know, little America. That's what I was going to do and I don't know what happened. All of a sudden now it's like I'm playing a rec room on a fucking Navy reserve base in Rhode Island.

Speaker 10:         00:43:17       I don't know what happened to the tour, but I was supposed to be going over there and I was going to go over there and I was going to give it my all and I was going to hang for next thing, you know, four or five days eating Sushi, hanging out in Tokyo. You know, just looking at a city like what if all of New York look like Times Square? I want to see it go to what? Go to a Japanese garden. You don't, you probably don't call it a Japanese garden. When you go over to Japan, you know, kind of like when you go to Philadelphia, you don't go, can I get a Philly cheese steak? It's like, dude, you're in Philly. Just say, can I get a cheese steak? All right, everything is a Philly here. See that yogurt? That's Philly yogurt. How could with 30 oh play.

Speaker 10:         00:43:55       I don't give a fuck what it says. All right, you're in Philly. So all this food is ours. Um, yeah, so I guess you say I want to go see a garden. So I go see a garden and then be like thought tie dyed by downside, speak English, and then I'd be an asshole American. Like you don't speak English. Learn the fucking language. You know how fucking, how bad would that be if you just walk down the streets of Tokyo? Just sort of yelling out to nobody in general and just sorta over everybody's head English. All right. I think I've been ignorant enough on this podcast. I right now you're probably wondering, you're probably wondering going bill last week according to the MM podcast.com the one and only official fan page of the Monday morning podcast. For those of you who like to follow along at home with every reference that I make when I bring up youtube videos, you want to at your fingertips.

Speaker 10:         00:44:59       When I mentioned old actors, when I Talk About Yo play yogurt, you want to look at the carton? Oh yeah, that is what it looks like. It's all up on the mmp.mm. podcast.com. All right, actually made a little video there. Uh, let's see. Like Archie bunker. Hey, I made a little bit bit a little video there. Edith eating bad. I made a video for the uh, um, it's a long story. You'll see I got, we have an exclusive video. It's not even up on youtube or maybe it is. I Dunno. I don't handle that shit. I just see the red light and I just start talking to people cause I'm a professional just like all of those band members on fucking Lawrence Welk. Okay. The light comes on. I start doing whatever it is that I do to pay the fucking rent. I didn't know what I'm talking about.

Speaker 10:         00:45:46       But anyways, I told you guys that I was going to be interviewing the, uh, the wonderfully talented Nicholas Swartzman. Is it Schwartzen or swore Zin or Swartzman? I think it's Swartzman with the Real Nicholas Swartz. And please stand up. Um, Minnesota, his own nick Swardson grandma's boy. Don't mess with the Zohan Blades of glory. All those fucking, all those movies that fucking every college kid and immature 41 year old, soon to be 42 year old like myself. Absolutely fucking loves. I love those movies. Okay. First of all, I didn't even know. I didn't even, somehow grandma's boy went under my radar. I don't know what I was doing, but I miss when that movie came out and I started watching some clips on it. It's fucking, it's funny as hell and I'm going to rent it this week. So anyways, I was supposed to, um, and that's what I was doing. I was ready for an inside the actor's studio, you know, I was, I was looking at his body of work and all that Shit, getting ready, you know, I wanted to have a good interview.

Speaker 10:         00:46:49       And then, uh, you know, when you have everything all planned out and then just, you know, this is what happened. Okay. I called Nicholas and uh, and I said, you know, are we good for today? He goes, yeah, no problem. Uh, gimme and whatever. We're supposed to meet in like an hour or something. So I'm sitting there and my fucking, you know, my boxers play my guitar, right. Doing what I do. I'm trying to learn these fucking surf, you know, that Surf Guitar, you know, for those of you trying to learn guitar, you know, try to learn to play by ear. So then you're not like, you know, borderline retarded in an instrumental kind of way. Instrumental in an instrument kind of way. So, uh, you know, there's simple songs down Aaron, Aaron, Aaron are

Speaker 11:         00:47:30       now now and I remember her married,

Speaker 10:         00:47:31       it's not one fucking string. You can figure it out. You know, you'll learn some courts. I'm fucking doing that shit and I'm a girl goes up.

Speaker 12:         00:47:38       Okay. Oh good to take the dog out.

Speaker 10:         00:47:42       So she walks down the street and just like in life when tragedy strikes, you have no idea it's coming. All right. I'm sitting there trying to learn how to play, waiting on a friend went in in a bed, bed and beauty you, you know, and knowing my neighbors, having the window open, not giving a fuck, right? I'm trying to slowly kill the old man who lives down below me on a holiday weekend. I might add fucking three minutes goes by. My girl is taking the dog around the block. What could happen, right? All of a sudden she comes in

Speaker 12:         00:48:21       opposite dawn. She looks look at me and she's like, I just got bit by a dog

Speaker 10:         00:48:26       freaking out, and I was like, I couldn't even fucking, I couldn't, I couldn't process it. I was like, you just walked outside to go take the dark for walking down. You're bleeding on your leg. What? What's, what's going on? She had a little, was a nip. Fortunately she didn't need stitches, but now my whole day is in shambles. It's like, what the f what did you get bit by? Was it a coyote? Was was, it was. It was a dog. It was a dog. Okay. Who's dog was it? I don't know. They, they weren't around. There was some lady there. She helped me. I all his shit. The next thing you know, I go from sitting in my underwear and trying to learn some Bill Haley and the comets next seen on walking up the street. I fucking don't even have socks on him walking up on my stupid old sneakers with my feet squishing in my old new balance. Right. Why am why you staring at me, Neil and I talking about, I'm telling the story as to why Nick Schwartzen isn't on this podcast. Come over here. Huh? What did I do? What? Come here. What did I say? What? Why didn't you go? Oh God, no, I wasn't. I was trying to act like you crying.

Speaker 12:         00:49:30       That's good. Whoo.

Speaker 10:         00:49:33       That's making fun of me. I'm not making fun of you fucking told Nick a god. The a movie star. I couldn't do the podcast. I have to take my girl to get her to get her up a little booster shot. Well, I mean, what the fuck is, you don't realize I'm recording right now. I'm sorry. Yes, yes. He's, why don't you go over on your laptop and go on Youtube? He's clearly and more movies than I've ever been in, so I should probably shut up. All right. This is ladies and gentlemen, if you ever wanted to look up back pedaling and the dictionary. Oh, sorry.

Speaker 10:         00:50:08       Sorry. I'm just explaining this. All right. I thought you were mocking me. I wasn't. I was mocking the situation where you just sit there and like nothing's going on and I'll, you know, you walked up to fucking take the dog out. What could happen? Remember I was sitting in my underwears oh my leg ripped out. Well yeah, not that chomped it Tom. Tom, what you did was you broke up a rape in progress. Yes, that's right. That's right. This dog was trying to, you know, take advantage of my dog's neck. Say Rape. She tried to rape her and she wasn't having it. And you know, dogs can't hold pepper spray because they don't have index fingers. Thumbs. That's right. And so they bare teeth and they go at it and a fight and said, I was proud of her. She's not one of those dogs.

Speaker 10:         00:50:53       Just let other dogs come up and have their way. She's a fucking dime, not a slut. She's not a slut. She's a dominant female. She's not taking it. Right. Well that's what I was, that was a story I was telling. Well will you draw a parallel to, and so what happens to me earlier in the day at the farmer's market when you get to, I know it's not about me. Oh, in the creepy homeless guy hit on you had an awful day. I told him, you know, I, you know this guy came up to me and I was at the front, I'm sorry, I'm going to see you're really just taking this over. And he came out, he was like, Yo, yeah I was, I was, I was buying bread from the farmer's market and this guy comes up to me and he's right in my ear, like all breathing on my neck really close.

Speaker 10:         00:51:30       And he's like, Yo, can I get some bread or something. Like it was so awful. And I was like, what is that? Some new street slang for pussy. Yo, let me get someone at brand sugar, 1972 slang salad. It was terrible. And so I'm like, what? And he got a mumbled something and I'm like, all right, you need to step off and whatever their needs trades getting close to me again. And I said, if you don't get out of my face, I'm going to punch you in the fucking face. I was so pissed off. Say face twice cause it really kills your momentum. If you don't get out of my face, I'm going to punch you in your face because you're in my face with your face and I'm not having that with your face. No, I think I said, if you don't get away from me, I'm gonna Punch on your fucking face.

Speaker 10:         00:52:18       That's what I said. If you don't get away from me, I'm gonna Punch you in your fucking face. And he was a Ho Ho you're not that pretty. You're not that pretty in any walkthrough. Hang on, hang on one second. You just sounded like you don't get out away from me. I'm going to punch you in the fucking face. Do you remember the cop and reservoir dogs? One of the most underrated performances ever in the bathroom with Tim Roth. It's in there. I said, buddy, I am going to shoot you in the face. You know, put your fucking hands in that dashboard, that classic cop speak buddy. That's what you just sounded like. All right, so, so you almost got raped. The dog almost got raped.

Speaker 10:         00:53:01       We both bared our teeth and fought off, you know, these fucking advances, you know what I'm saying? So I write, go write the script. It's going to be a nice lifetime movie. Okay. Taking over the podcast, they want to hear about me. That's what happened to Johnny Carson. All of a sudden he led a couple of people, guest host. Next thing you know, you're playing golf. Wondering what happened. Yeah. Beat it. All right. So anyways, so that was the story. Somebody tried to let some person left the gate open, uh, up to street. And uh, this dog came out with another dog. One was the lookout and the other one fucking, you know, came running up. You know, probably there's a little pink dog. He Dick and you know, tried to mount my dog. You know, I gotta tell you, I got to respect the dog up to street for its belief in itself that it could rape a pit bull.

Speaker 10:         00:54:00       You know, you know, when they make those movies about the fucking, you know, the, uh, the, the white guy from the suburbs who's wrongly convicted, you know, and he, and he goes, uh, he, he goes to prison. You know, I just realized in those movies, when it's the black guy who wrongly goes to prison, who's wrongly convicted and goes to prison, there's never any issues about him getting raped. You know, it's [inaudible] he's a black guy. He'll fucking, you know, kick the shit out of everybody in there, you know, and then dunk on the fucking warden when they have the annual fucking warden prison, fucking whatever game. Right. But the white guy goes to jail. It's always worried about getting raped. So anyways, if, because they've made that movie so many God damn times, and you couldn't make it any better than Shawshank redemption. But Tom Selleck made that movie.

Speaker 10:         00:54:47       Somebody else made them. I came up with who the fuck else made them. We, Tom Selleck went to jail and he fucking, you know, he ended up running shit and they respected his intelligence and all in all this fucking stupid white guy. Shit that they do, right. So I'm saying if you want to write that movie, okay, if you want to bring that genre back, if you're sick of seeing to a boyfriend and a girlfriend who are actually secretly hit, men are spies. Okay? If you're not tired of that genre yet, when the fuck did that start, by the way, was it Mr and Mrs. Smith and they've made like 52 of 'em. Ashton Kutcher has one coming out with some other broad, and they're standing back to back with guns in the, in the titles written in like pink lipstick. Okay, I'm digressing here, but anyways, this is how you, this is how you take that one to the next level.

Speaker 10:         00:55:34       This is a tip for all you Hollywood screenwriters out there. This is how you fucking do it. You, uh, you have the white guy not only be able to handle himself in the prison, but he rapes the toughest guy in the prison. Basically the pit bull version of, of, of a fucking human being, whatever, the big, the big fucking just jacked, you know, you ever see a dude just so big? It's like you look at the, he, he's like a, you know, had an aluminum baseball bat anywhere on his body that I hit. He wouldn't even feel it, you know, even his head, it would be like three times he'd be like banging them on the head as he slowly turned around doing that. That cheesy Bruce Bruce Willis. Look, you know, Bruce Willis has one. Look, once something's going to happen, he makes his eyes a little wide.

Speaker 10:         00:56:26       He makes his eyebrows tents. One of them goes up a little high and then he, he makes his mouth like a little round. Oh. And he turns around. That's what he does. That's what he did all through pulp fiction. He did it in die hard. And, uh, why am I shitting on Bruce Willis? I like his movies. What am I trying to talk? I'm trying to explain why. Uh, Nick Swardson's not on the podcast right now. So yeah, I was playing guitar and trying to learn some fucking, you know, whatever the firing or the names of the bands. I'm so new to the shit. Next scene. I'm going up the fucking street and uh, with Nia who's still bleeding. Okay. I did try to, you know, clean it up a little bit, but we also have to figure out, you know, if she's slowly getting Raby. So long story short, we get in the vicinity now we have to start knocking on fucking doors to try to figure out, uh, whose dog it was and I'm opening the gates and the gates of creek and easy to walk into these people's house.

Speaker 10:         00:57:22       We live on like one of those streets. Reveries House looks like the monsters, you know, so we, you know, to a much lesser degree rather than the gates being like, you know, 10 feet high, they like sort of waist, chest height depending on your height, you know, so I'm walking in there worrying that this rape his dog is going to attack me. So I have this fucking stick that has a ball on the end of it. I look like a fucking wizard that doesn't know how to walk with the cane. You know, I got it upside down. I basically looked like some blue collared guy who was wronged and he's about to take the law in his own hands, but I'm not going to get fucking bit right. I got a weapon Memorial Day, weekend, hand to hand combat. I grabbed the shovel out of my pack, so I'm walking up, I ring the doorbell and I hear Oh, and the other side, I'm like fucking great.

Speaker 10:         00:58:09       Right. And then this, you know, and then I'm waiting for the sound of the feet. Boom, boom, boom. Come walking up on the hardwood floors. This lady ups door. Hi, I'm Mike. Yeah, your uh, your girl. Your dog just attacked my girlfriend and then she does just, you know, ah, oh my God, I'm 30 I thought thought that fucking La Shit. We get lazy by the end of the sentence and you can't even finish the word. Oh my God. That's my favorite. You're what? My favorite. Your your favorite? Favorite. Favorite? Yeah. Rit. Not Raw. That's my favorite. Anyways, so she wasn't really like that. You know what she was, it's, it's the way fucking, I dunno, I can't speak for other countries, but the way this country is right now where everybody is just so fucking sue happy, she can't even express concern or like a sorrow or apology apologetic, whatever that fucking word is and whatever Tencent supposed to use that she can't express it because she's worried about a

Speaker 1:          00:59:20       fucking, you know,

Speaker 1:          00:59:22       okay. Incriminating herself. Like we're just going to sue the shit out of her because of, cause my girlfriends got bit, you know, and all I'm trying to do is find out if it has rabies. And my girlfriend told me that the dog was either black and white or brown and black turned out it was brown and black that she said, and I couldn't remember what the fuck she said. And I knew that she had two dogs and now I can't say to her the black and white one. And then she'd be like, I don't have one. You have the wrong dog. You just fucking, a unencrypted hated me and that she slams the fucking door. So anyway, so I had to figure it out. They had fucking rabies. Long story short and you know, and then I got to call nick and say, Hey, you know, remember how we were going to do that three seconds ago.

Speaker 1:          01:00:01       Well since then my dog almost got raped and my girlfriend got a chunk of her leg taken out so she's got to go get a tetanus shot. What happened? Long story short was I cleaned up to fucking cut, you know, little peroxide, little bass to tracing. I'd fucking covered the shit up and then it went back up the street cause I realized I didn't even get their names and their phone numbers and crap. And I know that the doctor's going to be like, well did you get proof that it doesn't have rabies? So I had to do that and the next time I went up the street, the husband was there and he was actually cool as hell. He said, sorry about that. Uh, don't worry about it.

Speaker 10:         01:00:31       You know, I'll pay for the trip to the hospital and that's all I wanted to hear. You know, not trying to get a second Prius out of a God damn nip on, on the inside of a knee cap. I'm not trying to do that, but I understand. I understand why the fuck they did it. But that's basically the reason why, um,

Speaker 10:         01:00:50       the reason why that uh, I Nicholas isn't on it and this week I'm going to try, I'm going to actually try to hook up and do a very special version. You might, you might get lucky. It's either going to be next Monday or maybe sometime this week. You might get lucky. I might do an extra one. Uh, and if I am going to do an extra one, just keep checking in with the uh, the m podcast.com the second I figured out that we are going to do what I will let, I will let you know the powers that be know over on that page and uh, they will put it up and you'll have the inside fucking scoops. So maybe you'll get something on a Thursday or a Friday this week. Huh? How much you guys love in life? It's a short work week.

Speaker 10:         01:01:28       Well you got to do is Olympia way through fucking Tuesday through Friday. You might get an extra podcasts with sliding into June here. Good Times, good fucking ties. But I was really looking forward to, uh, I was actually watching a ton. If you get a few guys for some reason are familiar with Nica Swartz and you really should just youtube some of his stuff and then go out, buy all his comedy DVDs because like I said, I'm not putting anybody on this podcast that I don't think is a, you know, is fucking hilarious. And I was seriously watching his stuff

Speaker 10:         01:02:02       just fucking dying laughing by myself. Even like the, the quick little videos that he makes, he's just, he's hilarious. And I'm written a, that's your homework assignment this week. Rent Grandma's boy. So you're up to speed and a or any of the other ones that he's in, but grandma's boy, it seems like he has the most lines in it. And uh, I don't know. He's got a bunch of movies coming out. God dammit. I had a fucking movie star coming on despite what my girlfriend, thanks. And I was just me sitting here under my goddamn ceiling fan again. So anyways. Yeah. So what are you guys disappointed? It's just me again. I understand that. I think I'm fucking thrilled. Thought I'd get a God damn week off somebody else talk. Somebody else talk for a while, do some shit jokes. Um, anyways. Anyways, oh, I got an email this week.

Speaker 10:         01:02:50       Um, remember the old Douche bag of the week award. Remember that? I haven't given one of those out in a while. Um, I got this really bizarre email from somebody the other day. He said, uh, it said, hey man, I sent you an email about a year ago and it was something to the effect of, fuck you, you really turned into a pussy, et cetera. I think though that I was wrong for saying that I will continue listening to your podcasts and look and looking forward to any new shit you come out with. Um, I wasn't thrilled with your California dog loving bullshit. I mean, we all love dogs, but we really don't, don't all talk about it. You know, this is like one of these guys. This is what fucking annoying me about those emails. You know, those people where they realize they're wrong and then they apologize to you and it starts off as, as an apology and then you quickly realize that it's really just an excuse to start reiterating the shit that fucking pissed you off to begin with.

Speaker 10:         01:03:52       Hey, listen, dude, uh, you know, can I talk to you for a second? Yeah. Listen, man, I got, I got, I don't know, I was in, I was in a bad mood yesterday. I was, you know, I've been dealing with flood of stuff, a lot of personal stuff and I just figured, you know, I just, I just want to say sorry. You know, I, uh, got a little out of line yesterday and, um, uh, you know, it was totally my fault and nothing to do with you, you know, uh, just, you know, you're doing that faggy shit that I can't stand, you know, acting like a, it's like, wait a minute. Wait, wait, wait. What? This is an appalling, just stop right there. Just say you fucking sorry. Don't, don't, don't bring it around again and start shitting on me. So the guy's like, you know, but fuck it.

Speaker 10:         01:04:35       Everyone's entitled to their own opinions, speech, et Cetera. What the fuck ever. I was think it's cool you actually write people back now he's being nice to me again. And you're also out there. I actually liked your material. Thanks again. You know, and you are really annoyed me about his fucking email is that he wrote I'm back. That was the name of the title. Like I'm actually like, I fucking like, he's the only guy who shits on me and emails. Like I've been sitting around going, gee, whatever happened to that guy. I don't even remember when this fucking happened. Why not? Why couldn't you just fucking come back and start a listening to the podcast? I don't give a shit what you're doing. Any kid, he told me to go fuck myself and called me a pussy, you know? Do you know how many of those I get? The only one I remember was with somebody gave me shit for supporting. So take two for taking the side of a celebrity you use like supporting celebrities and what the fuck did he said? Uh,

Speaker 2:          01:05:33       yeah.

Speaker 10:         01:05:33       Fuck you. Bye. Like he was all done with me and I just wrote back. All right. Take it easy.

Speaker 2:          01:05:48       Okay.

Speaker 10:         01:05:48       I don't know. It just cracks me up that people are so like, you know, I'm the supposed to be the guy that thinks the world is wrapped around them, not you. Right? I mean, I, these people make me feel better about myself. It's fucking guys think like, you know, yeah. Listen, I know you're still fucking, uh, you know, emotionally distraught about that time. I told you, go fuck yourself in November of 2006. I don't remember that. All right. Or if you've got to apologize, just apologize. Just sales guys kind of being a cunt. Sorry about that. All right. And then, and then just fucking start listening again. I don't need an Elisa and you listen to your fucking explanations. Douche bag of the week right there. God bless you. Welcome back, sir. Welcome back. Okay. And you became part of the podcast. Is that stroke your ego?

Speaker 2:          01:06:35       Okay.

Speaker 10:         01:06:36       Hope you get run over by that fire truck at the end of the parade today. I never understood the firetruck. Is that because it's always during the day and they don't have money for fireworks or you couldn't really see the fireworks? So in the end they got to have those poor fucking firemen in their raincoats sweating their asses off. Huh? Sweating off that fucking hooker funk that half of them have on their body, those heroes. That's one thing I've learned about firemen and have to talking to the cops. Firemen love hookers. They love him. You know, I'm telling you right now, half the time you see a fucking fire truck going down the street. Half the time they're going to get hookers. So what they're doing, I think they have all those extra seats. Why do you think they have that? That that fucking intense look on their face. The site, the site, they're going to go get their dick sucked. You know what was the last time you even saw fire? Every fucking three seconds. You see a fire truck going down the Damn Street. There's no fire. They're getting hookers. But everybody comes down on the cops.

Speaker 10:         01:07:50       Happy Memorial Day everybody. I'm winging this one. I'm winging this one. I thought I was going to ask somebody else talk for the entire fucking time. Um, you know, in my, my youtube research, everybody, when I was sitting there in my lab coat, my safety goggles doing youtube research, um, you know, lately we've been talking about, you know, bad covers and people actually started sending me some covers that were bad, but they actually thought were good. Like there's some Ukrainian group that does like this sort of a, I don't know what it is, old school, old school like European folk, um, version of highway to hell. So just search Ukrainian highway to hell, you know, the Malcolm and Angus parts or running an accordion and Phil Rudd's part is basically an empty suitcase and somebody hitting a, an empty water bottle against it and somehow it's actually pretty bad ass, pretty bad ass.

Speaker 10:         01:08:45       Those guys, like they really, they bring a great energy to it and I got a mid, I kind of enjoyed it because you would think it would be a train wreck. So that's your first video to watch Ukrainian highway to hell. And um, anyway, so I was, I was kind of looking up that, uh, that some of that surf guitar stuff and uh, they all use those fender strats and I got one of those this year and I was never really a fan. I always like the Gibson sound with a Marshall amp cause I, you know, Zeplin ACDC, like that's what I came up on. You know, Joe Perry always had that 59 Les Paul, he used, you know the deal and um, I dunno, I was into the beach boys for like two seconds and then they just annoyed the shit out of me. Um, but I dunno just trying to learn how to play guitar.

Speaker 10:         01:09:28       I graduate, you know, he listened to a little blues. It's funny when you go back and listen to those old blues guys like Lightening Hopkins is concerned, you know, called lightening cause he was so fast and compared to how fast guys are today, he's not that fast. So you kind of go back to those guys because you can at least figure out the rhythm. I've just explained if anybody out there is trying to learn how to play guitar, I'm really trying to learn how to play by ear. So I'm not like one of those Douche bags you see on youtube where somebody shows you how to play the guitar, but then they still want the tabs, you know what I mean? Um, so anyways, so then I graduated to two other Surf Guitar and like I said, it's a lot of the thought of the rips are all on one string.

Speaker 10:         01:10:07       But what I noticed in it was a, I came across this group called the shadows and they got a song called Fbi and you just have to see the synchronized dancing, the choreography that they're doing. Um, you know, you guys can keep sending me the bad covers. But a whole nother level of funny is some of the bad choreography because nowadays when you look at the choreography that people do, it's like a, I mean the, the, the dancers nowadays are so good. They'll have 20 people on stage and you're watching them and they're all moving. They're doing the exact same move at the exact same time. And back then in the 60s, it was basically, as long as you were doing the same movement within three seconds of the person to either side of you, it was considered a, it's considered, I guess, decent. So checkout, uh, search shadows, FBI, this is some of the worst choreography I've seen.

Speaker 10:         01:11:11       And a, if you want some bad, heavy metal, this is a whole nother genre and I haven't even tip even even like tapped the surface of this. Look up Brittany Fox and Brittany's B R I t and why Fox girls' school live and just watched the first 10 seconds of this stupid and back and forth that I thought was fucking cool as hell. I literally saw it and I was like, oh my God, this is, this is, uh, I was like, oh my God. No. I was like, I literally said, Oh my God, I know a fucking ditzy girls have ruined saying, oh my God. But it used to exist, you know, like when you saw a Zepplin fucking burning back to the goddamn earth with people on fire jumping out of it. Oh, that was all the humanity. Um, and then the last one isn't even synchronized dancing.

Speaker 10:         01:12:00       But this is the main reason why it took me so long. And I never really got into Dave Matthews was that stupid dance, that White Guy, James Brown fucking dance that Dave Matthews used to do. Just search Dave Matthews dance. And it's, it's, you know, you really just want John Belushi to come back from the dead and do that animal house scene where he smashes the guy's guitar, except you really want them just hit Dave right over his fucking head. And the only reason why I ever got in to listening to Dave Matthews was, uh, their drummer. And then I really liked, there was a saxophone solo that I just thought was the shit on one of their earlier, uh, earlier ones. Other than that, I just, I don't know, I just haven't been into them. So, and you know, if you, you know now, right there, that's a lot of work.

Speaker 10:         01:12:55       That's a lot of shit to go look up. What? You know what? Why don't you take the express checkout line? Okay, the automated checkout line and just go to the [inaudible] podcast.com we'll have all those fucking videos right up there. You can watch them. We'll have them in order the highway to hell, right to Dave Matthews, I mean very little times in life. Do what would I ever be on the side of a bully? But I swear to God, if right in the middle of his dance, if the stereotypical high school football player walked up to him with his jersey, still on with two of his other meat, had friends and they just stuffed him into some locker that they brought on stage and smashed his guitar. You could hear me laughing from the back of the fucking stadium that they were playing. I would completely enjoy it and I don't know what that says about me.

Speaker 10:         01:13:44       Oh, we're 34 minutes in. I want to give a shout out to all the joggers on the treadmill. You only got another word. Another fucking 13 minutes left. 13 minutes left. All right. How smelly is the person next to you? You know, are you on a treadmill right now? You know what I love is those, those fucking people who don't even need to do cardio and yet they still get on the machines and they always get on like that. That old school stair master, you know people who just cheat. They have like a magazine open and they're reading and then they look, they're like hunched over looking like a question mark and that just sort of moving their feet like flat, flat, flat, flat, flat, flat, flat. That it, it's like, what are you, what are you doing now? You're trying to burn fat off of your ankles.

Speaker 10:         01:14:27       Is that all you're doing? You're not doing anything you have full makeup on. Maybe that's just La. Do you know what time I was at the gym? I'm actually going to go outside the outside the bounds of this podcast. I actually did. I'm going to, I'm going to soar to name a name here. I was on a, I was on the fucking, the elliptical, you know, cause I want to have a hip replacement when I'm 55, I went to dual, the fucking Earl Campbell special. That's what the fuck I want. Right? Actually I don't, I don't universe. I don't. Okay. I've learned that. Be careful what you say your word is your wand. Um, so I'm at the fucking gym. All right. And uh, there's this girl in front of me, this beautiful girl, but she's got tattoos all over herself and I'm just calling. Why the fuck did this gorgeous girl get all those God damn tattoos right there.

Speaker 10:         01:15:18       Fucking sweatpants. They're hanging down. They can see about a 16th of an inch of fucking ass crack. And I'm just going like that girl. I swear to God, if he, if he just erased all those tattoos. Okay. And you put her in a address that that showed off, you know, the beauty of a woman, but it wasn't trashy. Like this girl is like a classy, gorgeous woman. Right. But she didn't know. She said, you met sweating, fucking sweat pants hanging off her and everything, and then like four days later she's in the exact same one. I'm fucking sitting there. I'm doing the elliptical. There she is against sweat pants hanging off and just so happened I was done before and I'm walking by or cause I got to go, you know, get the little fucking bottle of whatever and spray down the machine I just used. I looked at her and it was a, Oh, this is such a Kathy Griffin moment. I can't, I have Jesus. I, you know, I can't tell. I can't fucking name names that would, that would ruin the podcast. All right, I can't do that. I can't do that.

Speaker 10:         01:16:20       I'll fucking annoying is that I couldn't do it. Kathy Griffin has already ruined the reputation of redheads. No one's ever going to trust us with his secret again. She fucking hangs out with famous people, right? And they're all going, oh wow. Isn't this cool? I'm hanging out with a fucking comedian. And then she goes on TV and rats out everything. Then she picked her nose and I was like, Oh my God, Michael Landon just picked his fucking nose. I know he's dead. What the fuck? Right. So what am I going to do? I'm going to do that on my podcast.

Speaker 10:         01:16:53       I can't do it. All right? I gave you enough of a description. It was a beautiful girl with way too many tattoos. Figure it out, you know? Do you know any movie stars who are beautiful with way too many tattoos? You don't. All right, so now we're out here. We're out of the movies. Wasn't a musician. It's a TV star. Beautiful. Too many tattoos. There you go. You figure what? Are you laughing at? Nia? Am I totally giving it away? No, I'm not. I don't name names. She just said you're ridiculous. The amateur thrill I get because I have no idea if I'm making people laugh. If you actually left knee, I know that I'm not wasting my time here. Yeah, I see that. I just got an awe. Um, all right. What am I reading here? Uh, all right. He did. Anybody notice last week when you watch that?

Speaker 10:         01:17:54       That sabbath fan going crazy. How much he sounded like he could do a dead on Sam Kinison. I really thought that that guy was awesome. Somebody actually sent me a fucking hilarious email going like, come on bill, you think that that cause I said that that guy is actually probably a parent cause he's at that age and he was like, dude, you really think anybody's fucking that guy. I mean look at him. And uh, I would say this, if there was an even amount of men and women on this planet, I would say that he would be in trouble. All right? There would be a pussy shortage in his life that would rival what the fuck we went through in the early seventies with the gas, with the, with the gas crunch. All right. There was a long fucking way to go. Um, but no, fortunately there's three women to every one guy.

Speaker 10:         01:18:42       So as a man, if you're dating a loser chick or someone who's just a total country, you really have no excuse. But women, they actually, they haven't excuse, you know, when they say a good man is hard to find a there. Right. I would think a man would be hard to find if this fucking, you know, you know, three who host every fucking a hang down there paying down over there, you know. All right, let's read this fucking question here on, you know what? I don't want to do that. I don't wanna do that. I don't want to do that just yet. Beautiful woman, not a movie star with a lot of tattoo. It's not a musician. She also does not own an ice cream store. Okay. That's it. I'm done with it. I'm done with the hints. Um, anyways, and I'm not going to confirm or deny him either, but I do know the answer.

Speaker 10:         01:19:31       Huh? You like, I just went political. That's one of the greatest quotes I've ever heard. Some lawyer for some fucking guy or worked in Congress or whatever the fuck it was, came walking out and they go, they go, is it true that blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. And this guy just looked at the camera. He goes, I can neither confirm nor deny that I can either. Oh, I fucked it up. He goes, I can neither confirm nor deny that, but I do know the answer. And he walked away. All right, put that one in your back pocket. Next time you're in a fucking jam. When the cops are asking you a question, when your girlfriend and La, you're, oh, you're cheating on me. You know, give her that Bruce Willis. Look from die hard. Just look over your shoulder and then just do that.

Speaker 10:         01:20:11       Alec Baldwin sort of whisper. I can neither confirm nor deny that, but I do know the answer. And then just sort of look off right over a shoulder staring at something and don't break a gaze and just walk right by the side of her face. And I'll tell you, you're, you're completely mind fucked you. You know your mind fucked her. Okay. And then run down to the corner and try when the fucking fire trucks coming down the street grabbed the side and jump on. Go down the street. Get yourself a blowjob. Celebrate Memorial Day weekend. All right, let's get into the questions for this week. Um, I want to remind me to talk about the 1958 Oldsmobile 88. That's my new fucking car, you know, fuck it. You know what, I'm going to, I'm going to put some pictures up there and some of my favorite old cars and uh, the Malibu, the fucking Chevy impalas, those early 60 Chevy and pile is the Lincoln continental error.

Speaker 10:         01:21:08       JFK getting his brains blown out. That fucking Eric Carr. The uh, I have never been a big Oldsmobile guy. Even like the muscle cars. For me it was either the Mustang and there was certain years of the uh, certain years of the um, the Camaro that I really liked. Like as much as I liked the late sixties one, I think that 19 seventy's Camaro where they got like death fucking sharp nose on it is the meanest looking God damn car and has got the corvette round brake lights, the cars, the shit and always seem like whenever, I don't, cause it was a little bigger. It always just seemed like the gear heads always figure out how to put like some fucking 700 cubic fucking whatever the fuck. I don't know about engines. They put a Goddamn jet engine in the thing. Oh, and here's another thing too.

Speaker 10:         01:21:56       Jay Leno, I'm fucking obsessed with his car collection and I'm always going on his website. Jay Leno's garage or whatever. We'll have the link on the [inaudible] podcast.com. Um, he has a fucking look up Jay Leno. Here's another youtube video. Look up Jay Leno tank car, this fucking maniac. But uh, uh, an engine, he took it out of a tank, never get dentally Chrysler or dodge made it cause it's a Hemi, but it's like a fucking 58 cylinder and he made a hot rod out of it and open wheel hot rod. The fucking car was like, I swear to God, it's like 25 feet long. It's longer than the 58 continental right near one of the longest production cars of all time. I was actually talking to my dad about old cars. He knows all about all cars. You know he's do that. When we were kids all the time be driving down the street and we see a co they care.

Speaker 10:         01:22:52       I'd be like, dad is a 1955 Buick special at a three 50 God, there was a beautiful car. That's what we always ended with. God. That was a beautiful car. Actually met him one time watching one of those Dudley movies where he plays a drunk and you know, he drives his Rolls Royce and he comes screeching in hammered and he rear ends another car and my dad loves cars so much. He's literally watching it and as, as the dude is coming in and the screeching in the car and it's so clear he's going to hit a fire hydrant or whatever with that, that $5,000 grill, remember that 16 candles, you can have five grand and I've got five grand, right? He comes flying. My Dad is literally going making that noise, you know, liquid. Something precious is going to break and it fuck he rear ends the car.

Speaker 10:         01:23:40       Then my dad's like, no. Why did they have to do that? I'm just sitting there laughing going, dad, it's probably a fake Royal Rolls Royce, you know? And he just goes, yes, but I know. But whenever the fuck that means my dad's hilarious and he and I and I, whatever is in his DNA about loving cars from the 50s, forties and, and uh, the 60s, I got that. I don't know what happened. I tapped into that shit. But like I said, I've never been an Oldsmobile guy, but there is a fucking 1958 Oldsmobile 88 that this guy really did. That is, um, it's gold and just those front four headlights. It's amazing because the Chevys went from, from two headlights to, for between 57 and 58. I always hated that. I hated how the Bel Air looked cause it just ended up looking like a checker cab. I like the 55 to 57 Bel air when it had the single headlight.

Speaker 10:         01:24:38       And it wasn't just the classic, you know, for Memorial Day American car designs. How the fuck we went to that. And I was actually thinking, you know, I have a kid here, you know, am I really going to drive down the street going Deta fucking 1987 Chevy Lumina. God, that was a beautiful car. I'm not even gonna know what the fuck it was. Ford Astro, I'm not going to know what it was. They all look the same, but back then they had like, it was like, you know what I liked about the cars back then. I might be wrong here because this is a, you know, like I said, I'm not, I'm not a fucking mechanic obviously and shit, but like back then, the way they had things broken down was, you know, nowadays like, um, I like how can I put this like it, like Toyota, we'll make everything from uh, from a, uh, like a Prius, low end car.

Speaker 10:         01:25:35       Like what? I drive all the way up to a high end car that'll still say Toyota. I know they have Alexis and all that, but Toyota, we'll make like a, like a 50,000, $60,000 car and they'll make like an 18,000, $20,000 car. And in all, it's all under the brand name Toyota. Well, back in the day as far as my understanding of it was Catholic. They went Cadillac, Buick, Oldsmobile, Plymouth, Chevrolet and Chevy's were like bottom end cars, you know. And then if you drove up, it was like the status was like, what? Uh, what make you a drive? And I believe, at least that's the way I kind of understand if you drove a Chevy, you'll kind of a young guy, you know, I'm making your way up the ladder and you go back to your high school reunion. It'd be like, what? What's he driving?

Speaker 10:         01:26:25       Driving a Plymouth ag fucking shitty was driving a Chevy and high school. The fuck, how old is he? You know, but if you, if you got up to, you know, Buick and Oldsmobile you're doing are right, but if you driving a Cadillac, he will fucking run and shit. And I think that work the same way with like Chrysler where when Chrysler Desoto, Plymouth and then dodge, I dunno, I just met when I was in, when I was sitting, I was in a bar in, uh, Colorado. And they had this old school poster that said, buy your wife a Chevy, which is funny. It's like, Hey, buy one of those low end cars that'll shut her the fuck up. It probably doesn't even mean that tissue sound. My chauvinistically mine took dead. Anyways, let's, let's, uh, we'll, we'll, we'll have a picture of like, I'll say like, uh, like three or four of my most favorite American cars in celebration of a memorial day weekend and all the troops, you know, uh, you know what I mean?

Speaker 10:         01:27:19       I can barely handle being in Arizona. I don't know how the fuck I would ever survive. You know, if I was ever going to go to war, I should have gone to war back in the day when we were, uh, well, I guess we used to fight in the tropics. Jesus Christ. That would have been, you know, I probably could do they let red heads into the fucking army. You probably, that's is that, can I get a deferment for having no pigment? I've never seen an albino marine, you know what I mean? Can I get, that's like having flat feet. I got a bad back. I'm a redhead. Where are you going to stick me? All right. You want to fucking have hand to hand combat and Greenland. I'm there baby. I'm fucking right there of a knife for my teeth. I'll take out a polar bear. I swear to God I won't. Oh cower in my little fucking Igloo. Crying someone else's going private Burke. Get your shit together. I don't want to go out there. It's scary.

Speaker 10:         01:28:16       Nia, I am killing with you this week. I'm fucking funny today. See how women, they always got to clarify it. Why can't you just say your fucking funny? I'm funny today. You know what? That's why God made you so beautiful. Lead coming in here with your hair looking all glamorous. I was really mad at you too. I saw you come walking in here like some old school movie star. See that? See how I do that? I insult him and then I quickly compliment him and then I get the uh, what do you have in your hand? I am so why you like me and women like the assholes they do, right? Cause you know, we know what the fuck. Wow.

Speaker 10:         01:28:57       Anyways, AH, whatever. I'm shit talking. It's the holidays and be rubbing my balls. Drinking a beer in a minute. Cause I'm an American. You think I'm going to read, I'm not that extra day. Going to get dumber. That's what I'm doing. And we'll be puking in a fucking BFI. Been behind Dennis. All right, here we go. Here's a question for a week, a bill. Let me start by saying this. This question stems from events spanning over the last six years or so. About six years ago at the age of 20, I was about a year and a half into what at the time seem to be a really great relationship. Coincidentally, my job and money situation was also doing really well. Um, so I decided instead of throwing my money away on rent, I'd buy a house. There you go. This guy's making the moves. He's doing well in life. It's buying a house.

Speaker 10:         01:29:47       Everything's good. So far, being that I always plan ahead. I purchased a rather nice house for a first home, even though I thought, uh, he said, even thought I knew it, even though I knew it was a little too much money and now I didn't decide I didn't buy this to start a family or for her. I just wanted a fucking house, uh, in the year or so after the relationship really went downhill, mainly because I was working more in spending less time and money on her. Um, okay. Uh, long story short, we split about two years later. Since then, I've had many encounters with girls. Okay. So let me, let me fix this with my awful reading. All right. Basically, this guy's dating a girl. He's making good money. He doesn't want to throw his money down the toilet paying rent. So he goes and he buys a house and then now he's got a nut to fucking crack.

Speaker 10:         01:30:40       Every month he works a little bit more. He's not spending time with his woman and it goes downhill. Plus he's younger. That's pretty normal except the fact that he owns a house. So now he's in this situation, he's single. He has this really nice house and this is what's been happening since. All right. Since then, I've had many encounters with girls. The one thing they have all had in common is their hatred and animosity towards my ex girlfriend and my house. I've even heard them say things about sleeping in a bed I bought with her or how they don't like it that I did all this with uh, with the other girl. I've been dating a girl for about two years now and she's the same way. Uh, she even has problems with my dogs because she says they were her dogs, meaning the ex. My question is this, why is it never good enough?

Speaker 10:         01:31:28       Well, if you're a fan of this podcast, you've already asked that question, but I think it's timeless. So I'm going to, that's why I'm reading this again. Am I suppose to start my life over every time I want to begin a new relationship or is it that girls really always want to have what they can. They cannot have half the country nowadays are just waiting for some guy to put them up in a house and take care of everything. But when you give him the chance, the they bitch because they didn't get to pick the fucking drapes.

Speaker 10:         01:32:00       Oh this guy's making some good points. Knee, I'm going to need your help here. He said, uh, I don't, uh, I don't get it. I've done really well for myself and I've done it on my own. None of that had anything to do with who I was dating at the time. And I hate the feeling bad because I'm trying to make, because I'm trying to better myself. What's your take? All right, Nia, what did you say on this? US? She summed it up really well here. What do you, what do you think about this guy? Just to, just to reiterate, you know, the deal. What, what, what is, uh, what is his problem? I think the problem is the kind of people that he dates cause I don't think that there mature enough. So like let go of the past, you know what I mean?

Speaker 10:         01:32:39       It's like, of course he stayed at other women of course. You know what I mean? It's not, yeah, but let me ask you this. If, if when I met you already had a house, right. And uh, it was, you know, it had a little bit of the female touch to it, you know what I mean? Yeah. You know what I mean? It's not like you walked in and there was just a coffee table and like fucking a play station, you know, popcorn in the cushions or whatever. Right. I'm not saying this house looks like that, but you know. Right. Yeah. No. If it looked like, and I still had the bed that I used to bang the other one. I mean I'll say at least she can do, dude, you can leave, switch out the bed. You know what I mean? Bad though. I thought.

Speaker 10:         01:33:12       I think that's a little, I think that's a little much, honestly. What did the little much to still have it. Yeah. He's going to buy it. And you know how much better, cause you don't have him buy a whole new bed just cause he's slept with somebody else and it ladies, can you see why this is my girl? You're the shit. Yeah, because I mean how many, when you're dating somebody and you have sex with them in their house, chances are they've had sex with somebody else in their bed before you anyway. So now all of a sudden it's like a big deal because no, he, he needs to date some more mature girls. But he's been dating someone for two years. I don't know what he's been doing. I thought you said he, I just focus on saying the words, right.

Speaker 10:         01:33:54       Yeah. He says, you know what? You know what this, this house could be like the lock, the lock, the door test in a Bronx tale. Oh yeah, that's true. Yeah. Like if they can't deal with it and they start giving me shit, you give him the heave Ho. Exactly. I think they should get the heave Ho this is my house. This is where I fuck you want in. Not Quite. So absolutely. But if anything, he could, you know, get some new sheets or something. You know what? Oh obviously, yeah, bed, bath and beyond. I'm thinking about some new sheets. You want to help me pick out? Some girl would love that. Love it. Yeah. There you go. Yeah, there you go. Yeah. And at what point in the relationship should he do that? You know, cause we don't like being tied down. I want to send the wrong message.

Speaker 10:         01:34:36       I don't want to say that I love you, but I want you to still bang me. Like at what point? I think when it's like official date, like monogamous type thing is when you can say, Hey, let's, you know. Okay. All right. Really? You answered the question, don't oversell it. You answered it. It gets really annoying that these girls would be like, my God, I can't believe that you know, this is already decorated and these are her dogs and her house and I can tell that there. That's stupid. That's really hard to say how la girls say favorite athletic fabric.

Speaker 10:         01:35:18       That's going to be the podcast for this week. So I guess, so that's your answer right there on, you know, I'm not going to always defer those to Nia, but I just think sometimes you're, you're really asking me what women are thinking and I, I think I've done enough trashing of women and, uh, shut up. Um, I've done enough trash enough. Um, and you know, that's actually a serious question here because still you, you don't want to get to that in a situation where, I mean, you have to, I mean, literally sell the house. What if it's a bad fucking market just to appease her? That's ridiculous. But, uh, I, I would, I, you know something, yeah, I would actually say that if they were actually going to be getting married, you know, if, if he take it to that level and, uh, there'll be a weird thing because when you do get married and you want to pick out a house, it's the house that for both of you that you want to live in. And you know, this houses out there that I just don't get like that though. You know that gingerbread looking house sits up to fucking street. Like you know if I met the girl of my dreams and she lived in that house and every day driving, Ugh, I hate this fucking house. You know all those ones that look like the, the castles, that employee but they're, they're just the house so it looks stupid. You know, Rapunzel let down your hair or just sorta hop out that window.

Speaker 10:         01:36:35       No, I I do. I know, I respect that but I'm saying I, this is what I was saying like you know, come on in and live here. I get that. But then you know, I'm sure he didn't buy a house that's big enough to have like a, like a big family. I don't know if he does. I'm not know. I'm just trying to kind of balance it out. Allow what the fuck am I trying to do? Nia, are you going to be designated driver because I'm going to get hammered today. Why? I was designated driver last time, last time, last time. Last time, like fucking three weeks ago when we were in Boston and you guys all got Hamad is they say, oh yeah, but we're going to somebody. We don't know these people. We can't go get hammered. I can, I'm going to, you know what my mission is? I'm going to make you look good today. I'm gonna you're gonna people are gonna feel bad for you.

Speaker 10:         01:37:25       We'll figure it out. Come on then I send you those songs than I make up. You know when I get drunk. Yeah. Be Fun. No, we, I'll be asleep halfway, halfway through with my mouth open, looking like the asshole next to you on a fucking transcontinental flight. All right. That's it. Happy Memorial Day to everybody. Sorry. The Knicks Swartz and things didn't work out. I'm going to try to sneak in an extra podcast this week. Um, I'm going to figure this shit out. Okay. I promised you a movie star. God dammit. I'm going to bring you one and uh, that's it. A Happy Memorial Day to everybody. Have a nice safe, happy holiday. Get to where the fuck you going to be at and just start Busan. All right. Okay. Don't be that ass, so I'm fine. I'm fine. You're not fine. All right. Two Sec. You, you have grass stains on your face. Okay. You're not fine. Have you been drinking today? A couple Saad hanging off your fucking left ear. All right, everybody, that's it. Have a great weekend and a happy holiday and,

Speaker 8:          01:38:32       uh, that's it. God bless the troops. Okay. No, it was come direct charge. Charged charge.

Speaker 3:          01:39:37       Yeah.
