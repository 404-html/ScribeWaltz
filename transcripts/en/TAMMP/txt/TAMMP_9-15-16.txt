Speaker 1:          00:00:01       Hey, what's going on is bill burn his time for the Thursday afternoon? Just before Friday, Monday morning podcast and

Speaker 2:          00:00:10       Ah,

Speaker 1:          00:00:13       just checking in on you. I'm just checking in on you like a friend, like a pal, just calling to say hello. You know what I mean? You know when somebody calls just to say air quote hello. And you know as much as you sitting there going, oh, you want to believe it? Uh, this is so nice. He's just saying hello. The thing is the first seven minutes, the first seven minutes, she got to be on pins and needles. Like, when's it coming? When's it coming? When's the favor going to be asked? I never hear from this motherfucker. And now he's called, Hey, just called to see what's going on, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. And they wind their fucking way around. They dosey doe year round the room. You're like, wow, isn't this nice? He just called to say hello. He's really asking me how I'm doing and my wife are doing.

Speaker 1:          00:00:57       And then all of a sudden Eric comes star. That's great. You know? Interesting. You should say that because dude, I could use your boat. I could use about two grand. You know, I know what's a lot, I'm embarrassed to even ask you, but like I just, you know, I hit a little bit of a rough patch. I'll get it back to you probably by the end of the month or maybe never. Worst case scenario, I'll never bring it up again, but when you do, I'll make it seem like you're the asshole. Like, really? You're going to do this now. You're going to do this now in front of my family that they're not here, dude, they left you years ago. Oh, then you're going to bring that up. You know, one of those fucking guys, no matter what you do, somehow you're the Douche. Samiah you're the one at fault. You know that works. People, you know, they, they don't take responsibility for themselves, like make, you know, I'm a fucking pillar of this community.

Speaker 1:          00:01:57       That's when you know it's time to move. If I'm saying that type of shit and you live anywhere near me. Um, so guess what? MMM, my old ass kitchen. My old ass fucking kitchen yeah. Is uh, they started to work on it today. So we rented a small house around the corner because last time, longtime listeners, you know, we fucking ended up getting like smoker coughs. You can't live in a house where they're doing demolition. You just can't. I've done it twice. I did it once in New York. Um, once again, I was putting a kitchen and it was the ugly, the kitchen I had was the ugliest fucking kitchen you've ever seen in your life. The cabinets were like this, um, you know, like when, when they try to have like the flesh color of a, of a slightly less pasty person than me, you know, that color. It's not white. It's not peach. It's not 10. It's just that fucking color. It was that color counters and cabinets. And then it was a dark brown outline on the cabinets with that far. It was like, you know, when they make a doll and it's supposed to be a Caucasian doll, like back in the day you remember that? Fuck it was that fun. Oh, that's perfect. Minus the rosy cheeks. It was that color, right? Like the color that thinks fucking foot. I had a doll foot colored kitchen was shit brown and I mean Shit Brown.

Speaker 3:          00:03:27       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:03:27       Yeah, no shit. Fucking brown. Jesus Christ. You're an animal. Shit Brown outline around the cabinet. And then I had this fucking stove that like, I swear to God was from like the Serpico era of New York.

Speaker 3:          00:03:43       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:03:45       And I want to say the walls were yellow, like the used to be a sun yellow and then that basically over the years faded into your dreams have died in, this is your lot in life yellow.

Speaker 3:          00:03:56       Um, and you know,

Speaker 1:          00:04:00       I could barely afford to get the kitchen done, so I had to be there and I was in a one bedroom apartment and they did the ceiling to floor fucking plastic shit. It, it means it gets most of it, but the rest of it goes right into your fucking lungs. I mean, it just took for fucking ever.

Speaker 3:          00:04:16       Um, uh,

Speaker 1:          00:04:20       but when it was done, it was the shit, oh, it was finally fucking done. But I remember, you know what they forgot to do, they forgot to give me a little place to put a wastebasket and you're like, oh fuck. And then they just, Jerry rigged this fucking horse shit that never made sense. I never even used it. And I lost a little cabinet space, which is crucial in any kitchen. Forget about when you got a little ass fucking one bedroom apartment in New York. So the next time I did anything and you know, left New York, sold the old digs, came out here, you know, went back to rent and then got a fucking house and we did the whole downstairs, which turned into a fucking nightmare because my house is a 93 years old at this point.

Speaker 3:          00:05:01       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:05:02       So we had all kinds of cloth wiring. We had all sense galvanized pipe. We had a gas leak. We just, every fuck we did. At one point they were rodents in the wall. So when we took the wall out, there was a bunch of road in Shit in the wall.

Speaker 3:          00:05:17       You know,

Speaker 1:          00:05:18       when they listed that thing and I went to buy it, they did. They didn't say that they, they, they, they didn't disclose that. You don't have to disclose to the prospective buyer that, oh, by the way, we had some sort of mouse or rat problem and they ate through the fucking walls and they shit wherever they wanted to, shit in. It was just, it was literally a shit show. So that took a fucking year to undo. The whole downstairs was completely fucked up, not up to code on. I took the whole fucking year to get that fixed and now that's fixed, so,

Speaker 3:          00:05:51       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:05:52       And then upstairs they'll fucking jumped. The floors were warped.

Speaker 3:          00:05:56       I,

Speaker 1:          00:05:58       if you put a marble on my floor, it would roll as fast as that thing that chased Indiana Jones. Like that's how fucking walk day where that giant fucking ball, you know. Um, by the way, that's the only Scifi type movie. I can handle it. Cause you know, it was weird. It was like science fiction, but it was like back in the day, you know, so there was still like people's, there were people walking around with like fucking 0.8 years and uh, you know, grabbing you by your fucking Scapula and then for some reason pass out, even though it makes no fucking sense whatsoever. That's a Vulcan nerve. What? I mean there's nerves everywhere. What exactly is there? Fuck. Is that dude's name Spock? Right? Did he have a last name or was that not logical? You fucking Douche with your mo from the three stooges haircuts, unit, Fullan. Anybody. Right. And your diva fucking eyebrows. I too was a fraud.

Speaker 4:          00:06:52       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:06:53       Anyways, the fuck I started talking about Spock. No, I bit my fucking kitchen. So today, today was a big day, so he moved into the little fucking small place. Right. And uh, you know, just grab clothes and Shit, you know, that's it. Bottle of booze. I hate to say that I actually packed up a bottle of booze. I mean, Bill, how many fucking red flags do you need to see? Um, I took that thing with me like, Ooh, I got to bring that like I forgot my checkbook. Um, I to tell you it was delicious. Delicious. A little bourbon called Yippy Kai. Yay. Not Mother Fucker for all your diehard fans. Just Ki Yay. Might be a whiskey. I don't even know. All I know is when you poured into the glass, you can't put a fucking ice cube in it because it's just that fucking beautiful. It would be. It would, it would be absolutely religious. Um, and my wife's fucking texting, calling me right now. What is the problem? What is the problem? I heard you pull up. I can't figure out the keys. Youth. I sense that you're laying down enjoying yourself. Is there any way you could get up and not be relaxed? All right, here we go. Doing podcast.

Speaker 1:          00:08:12       Oh, I can't do that. That's too blunt. What's up?

Speaker 1:          00:08:18       All right. All right. What's up? What should I go with? Qt. Let's go with sweetie. Sweetie. Pies. That too much. Is that too pandering? Want to go with sweetie? Question Mark? No. Emoji emojis for, for fucking voice, right? Real men. Don't Emoji. All right. They take that big fucking deviled egg, Eaton thumbs, and they try to, they did. They do the best they can. I use emojis. My favorite thing to do is to use emojis with another man who fucking for some reason we'll get like homophobic if you send them one, you know, and once you sense that on them, you just keep sending more and more emojis and you gradually build your way up that the, the little fucking smiley face that's blowing the kiss. That's a little hard, you know? Um, anyways, so we fucking um, where guesthouse, Dunno. What the fuck are we talking about? Oh, Jesus Christ. What the fuck does it matter where the fuck I'm doing it?

Speaker 4:          00:09:20       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:09:21       Guest House. You mean garage? They're always trying to fucking hook shit up. No fucking downstairs. She's out in the driveway. All right. Anyways, um,

Speaker 4:          00:09:35       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:09:36       Plowing ahead. Why? Why, why would you answer it bill? Why would you answer it? When am I going to learn that? You just don't fuck an answered and then they'll be like, where were you? What were you doing when you see them? Then you just get it all out and it's so easy to s much easier to say it. Then the fried try to fucking texts if forget about that whole voice message saying they'd always ends up fucking something up, especially pronouns. So whenever it makes any sense that there or maybe I'm a mumble. And Jack, I said, I'll tell you right now who could not voice text is Shannon Sharpe. Jesus Christ. I dunno who's hard to understand him. It understand is him or that fucking guy will pick me up in Scotland.

Speaker 5:          00:10:18       Bull Bull. Bull Bull. Well yeah, but futbol. Whoa.

Speaker 1:          00:10:25       Okay. You're looking at me. I don't know what yeah, you literally talking to me.

Speaker 5:          00:10:30       Yup, I'll follow.

Speaker 1:          00:10:32       MMM. Anyway, so today was the first day that they did the, uh,

Speaker 4:          00:10:37       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:10:38       Did the fucking, the demolition for the fucking, um, the kitchen. Right. So I go over there, cause you know, I gotta get some mail and I forgot some dumb shit, like mouthwash and shit like that. So I went over there to go get the mail and all that crap and I, dude, I went in there and it's unfucking believable.

Speaker 4:          00:10:57       Yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:10:57       it's unreal how long it takes to build a kitchen, but to take one apart. I mean these guys, they were down to the tile. Shit was just gone and this is what was killing me. It was, you know, cause it's all grout and all that type of shit. Like I was downstairs getting the mouthwash and I heard him upstairs like Bam, Bam, Bam, Bam. It's like I have to get the fuck outta here. You, you don't want to hear that sound ever in your house. I just kept picturing these old revolutionary war nails coming out of like fucking, what do they call that? Uh,

Speaker 4:          00:11:30       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:11:30       Support beams. What do they call them? The main thing like you can't fuck with that wall because that wall is a load bearing wall coming out. One of the load bearing walls. Um, so anyways, allegedly it's going to take eight weeks. So, uh, what's the over under on that guys? Come on. It's football season.

Speaker 4:          00:11:47       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:11:48       I'll tell you right now, like the, if, if you had a bet, the over under on a home improvement project, if you went to bed on that Vegas like the fucking over would be off the charts. You, you'd have to bet a thousand to make a buck and the under would be pro. Well they never give you that go to odds, but you know what I mean. Um, so anyways, uh, that shit began today. Um, and we'll finally going to, we're going to fix everything because we had, you know, oh you can see the kitchen in the pie crust making video and you'll see me on this little island. And that was back when I having an island was list this thing to have in a kitchen and whether you had the space or not and we completely did not have the space and none of it made sense.

Speaker 1:          00:12:37       They had to sync up against the wall and set up against the windows. The stove instead of being up on the wall against the wall was like the size of like, I mean, I could barely get a fucking cookie sheet in there. And you guys know how I like the sweet staff. So, uh, they're finally getting rid of all that. They're going to open it up a little bit, uh, hopefully. And uh, you know, it's not the biggest kitchen, but I would just like to, you know, like have shit work and I'd have some big fat fuck hippo of an island in the middle, push it up against the wall. The, so they're getting rid of everything. By the way. They, the last people who fucking put the kitchen and rather than doing it the right way and digging up the old floor, they just put the tile on top of the old floor.

Speaker 1:          00:13:15       You know, that thing. Let's just keep fucking building on top of Shit. That's fucked up. Right? So, um, and then that we had this beautiful swinging door, like this old school servant door back when people had people coming over cooking. I'm not talking slavery here. I don't to make people uncomfortable. I'm talking just indentured servants. These are white people coming over. The latest group of white people from a Europe, we'll say, we'll say this is a politically correct house. They only had a same colored indentured servants. Right. So when they raised the floor, they had that, they cut the door, they cut it up top and it just kills me because I want to keep the fucking door. But this guy's claiming that there's a lot of doors like that around here cause a lot of people read them the houses. So hopefully I can get one that fits.

Speaker 1:          00:14:00       So I'm taking, I'm having them take it off the fucking tile and underneath that I'm guessing is a hardwood kitchen floor that has now been fucked up because of this tile and all the glue and shit that they put on it. So taking that up right down to the plywood, which I know is rotted the fuck out. I know it is because when we put a pantry in there, I could, when we got down to the plywood, I literally could have, like if I gave a karate instruction with that you guys would want to take my class would be like Jesus Christ. How did you punch through four layers of fucking plywood? Well, I let it marinate for 23 years under water, 23 years, I mean since 1923 anyways, so they're going to pull all of that shit up and just get it down to whatever you call the, the braces and then they're going to look down there and if there's any wiring that's fucked up, if there's any pipes of fucked up that taking it out, they're not going around the shit that taken it all out. And then they're putting it in and doing it the right fucking way. And I'm telling you, I'm telling you, whoever gets this house after me, all right, I don't know how long I'm going to stay there. Whoever gets his fucking house after me, you're not going to have to do shit unless I stay in it so long that the fucking kitchen goes out of style or some shit. But whatever. All I know is when you go into the walls, it's going to have done right. Um,

Speaker 1:          00:15:20       I don't know. I don't have that fucking in me. I don't have it in me to just sort of half ass something. You know, people do that today. It's just bricks and mortar. Fuck the next guy. Why would you do that to him? What if he's a good shit? Right? What if he's a good freckled fuck like me? You know what I mean? He just going to stick me with that. She can't. Um, so anyways, that's what's happening today. Uh, tomorrow I'm going to, I'm flying out to Durham, North Carolina to do a three nights of shows with the FEC and former front man of a rock band for 20 years. Dean del Rey turned comedian, uh, one of the great guys in standup comedy. Uh, and I'm psyched because, uh, you know, he's been dropping all kinds of weight. That's the kind of person I want to be around.

Speaker 1:          00:16:07       And uh, you know, he, you know, he's like all those rock stars. He's fucking sober. You know what I mean? They all get fucking stories and doing heroin with law. You know, the lead singer of fucking whoever, pick a fucking pen. I don't want to say heroin. Whatever. They did blow with the fucking guy from quiet, right? Kevin? Dobro rest, his soul rest is fucking sold in. Um, so I got that going on. But last night, last night I sat in with the fucking band. And uh, it was funny because I told you when I, when I went over to, uh, I was in Italy, I was just, you know, I was jet lagged and I always end up stumbling on some sort of fucking shit on youtube. Like the first time I went over to Europe, since I've been doing the podcast, I somehow stumbled upon somebody who had uploaded all four of the Pittsburgh Steelers first four wins in the Superbowl, the games in their entirety. And I just sat and watched and I, I binged watch him cause I was afraid the NFL was going to take them down. And um,

Speaker 1:          00:17:14       every time I go over there, I find something fucker just, I just end up in some weird part of the fucking Internet where I find something cool. And I ended up gutting across, uh, I dunno, it was just thinking about back in the day somebody had asked a question about like me taking drum lessons and Hawaii who I studied with and a, and now I used to, I was used to be at this music store that was in downtown Brockton. I don't even know if it's there anymore that was yet another victim of a guitar center. But, uh,

Speaker 1:          00:17:45       that reminded me that one of the big drums are, they was that, uh, Bobby Shoe and art, I'm saying his name right Chouinard, will you say it? And um, and I was like, he used to play for Billy Squier and I started watching [inaudible] wire and that was like, this fucking guy was great. It's a great front man. He's sort of straddled the line of fucking rock band. Pop Band did a great, and even the video that they said, you know, took him down. If you close your eyes, that was a hit song in the 80s total hit song. They just said the wrong video. And unfortunately they didn't have another hit after that. So that's the last thing everybody remembers, right? Your last season. You only good as your last game. Right? So anyways, long story short, a friend of mine hit me up and he mentioned he was doing a show,

Speaker 1:          00:18:34       uh, Frankie Perez. Um, who, if you guys ever saw that time, I got to sit in with Dave Kush during a couple of his buddies, wink, wink, and play highway to hell. Um, he was the lead singer's guys just like a fucking amazing singer. So he mentioned that he was going to be down at the, there's a bowling alley. The fuck is it giving, I'd never know the names of places. It's right on Hollywood boulevard. Right, right around the corner from where they do the Os. Yes. And uh, so he said his band was playing. I was like, yeah, I'd love to go down and fucking see you play or whatever, Yada, Yada, Yada. And then he goes, hey man, you want to sit in or a song? And I told you, that's my fucking rule. I don't force my Hollywood, my Hollywood. I don't fault my Hollywood.

Speaker 1:          00:19:16       I don't force my hobby. Jesus Christ. There's a fucking Freudian slip. I don't force my ego, I don't force my hobby on you. But if you ask me, I was, I'm gonna say yes. I don't give a shit how terrifying this situation is. I'm going to say yes. So I go, all right, well we'll figure out this song. I said, by the way, man, this guy is way better than people remember. And I sent them this Billy squire, the lonely is the night. And then he wrote back, he goes, dude, I fucking love that guy cause you want to do that song. And that just struck me as funny. I was like, yeah, let's fucking do it. Everybody's always play an ACDC Zeplin and all that shit. I'm like, fuck it, let's do it. Um, so then I was texting my other buddies saying, yeah man, we're going to do lonely night by Billy Squier.

Speaker 1:          00:20:00       And they were all like, ah, that's an interesting choice by knew Frankie was going to kill it. So anyways, so I go down there and he just has this fucking monster band, monster fucking band, a players like this sitting at tuning up to play. And they were going to do a cover of dazed and confused and the other bands like, you know, load in this shit and just a guitar player played the first sort of notes of the song. And I don't mean like the baseline, I just mean some of the licks and he had a telecast. It just like Jimmy had, you know, when he first came over here and played at the whiskey and I was just like, oh fuck, are they gonna do dazed and confused? And then he fucking,

Speaker 1:          00:20:40       he see breaks out the boat and I swear to God, man, it sounded like the album. Then the whole band kicks in. And, uh, the woman on drums, Valerie Franco, right? She, there's like a house drunk kid. She says, you know, get that shit out of the act. Puts in her own fucking kid. She's got a vista like kit, you know, like, what do they call it, the candy striped, um, vintage one. They start miking it up. It sounds fucking unbelievable. And I'm listening to a play and I'm going like, Oh shit, I got to go on after that. Like, you know, they're going to pass off one song to me after she plays. Right. This is just the sound check. Um, I didn't realize that she was only going like 40%. Uh, I'm actually good. I tweeted a video of her playing a cover to a mute math of all people.

Speaker 1:          00:21:24       Um, and I heard that she's going to be doing something with Darren King, that drummer. But dude, I gotta tell you when that fucking show started, the woman that I saw at sound check was, was like, it was, it was not the same person. And I was blown away by the sound check though. She fucking destroyed, fucking destroyed. She, the set began. She just hit the symbols like twice. And I was like, what the fuck? It sounded better than anything I've played 20 years. Absolutely fucking was murdering on the drums and what it was common time for me to play the song I was sitting in, I was literally getting the same butterflies I used to get way back in the day when I first started doing standup and there was somebody killed it on stage and I was just stuck. Comedians know this, we're all of a sudden you feel like you're two inches tall going like, I can't follow that.

Speaker 1:          00:22:15       So, uh, she gets off right? They finished think murders it for six, seven songs, and then she comes back, hands me the sticks. She just like, all right, you're up. And I'm like, yeah, yeah, yeah, no problem. Right? So I sit down and we go to play it at the whole fucking thing went great. Except I fucked up one major part. Right? Like the guitar riff Bannon and then Annette is a part where the whole band drops out and the guitar plays, right. Donna? None. And then on the snare and the floor, Tom, you and the bass player at Saint Tango took, okay, good. Just like that data. Then Annette Bannon a nun. And a right. I fucking forgot to do that part. So the guitar player, a total rock star goes bad. Alan, Alan, that miss my cue. And then so it's just the bass player going boo boo boo boo boo boo boo boop.

Speaker 1:          00:23:10       I felt like fuck such a fucking asshole. I think I literally said oops. Like if anybody for whatever reason you know was filming during that, you know, everybody's got the fucking iPhones. If anybody, you might even see me say oops. But I don't think anybody noticed cause I think most of the crowd was like what fucking song is this? Um, but it ended up going, I was, I was nervous about the, the first part because the first time they drop out, you know, he does all this simple barks and a couple of nods to bottom there and those things went off without a hitch. So then you start, dude, it's all like, I've found a few times ever sat and with Ben the second you lose your focus, you just can't do it. All those years I played. You just play along with, with like, you know, playing along with records versus just being the only person playing is an entirely different game.

Speaker 1:          00:24:00       And then if you sit in at a sound check in the singers not singing, then you really have to be fucking paying attention. And uh, yeah, I just, once I got past those, that little fucking shit on the high hat and the little bottom lik I was like, Oh man, it's all fucking downhill from here. This is all pretty much straightforward shit. And uh, oh fucking freckles as always, at some point whenever I'm, no matter how well I'm playing, I always turned back into the Pumpkin, which I think is apropos considering this the shape of my head. Um, but anyways, I want to thank all those guys for letting me sit in and then they were fucking amazing. This other guy, salad and keys, I apologize to, uh, some of the other people. I mean, there was like five or six people up there, uh, another woman, Kayla singing her ass off. It was, it was fucking awesome, man. And, uh, I swear to God in another life, in another life, the same way I would've done comedy and continued to sleep on a Futon, right until my forties, right up to my forties. Like I basically did. I would have done that to try and make it as a drummer. It's just too much fucking fun. Um, but anyways, let's get down to the fucking thing at hand. I saved to the end. Oh Shit.

Speaker 1:          00:25:14       Who the fuck wants the football? Huh? You know the big story? Tom Brady suspended for four games. The Baltimore, that fucking Indianapolis Colts. What other always be Baltimore to me. The Indianapolis Colts. Whoa. A good coach. Air Air out. That's why we lost by 90 fucking points. Um, which really losing by 35 really is about 70 fucking point. She had dopes. So anyways, and now we've got our backup quarterback coming in there. You know, not only do we win, the fucking colts lose and you know, it's the greatest thing about it. We got another matinee. Idol is a quarterback. Does that guy look, he does not have the looks of a backup quarterback, right? He looks like the fucking lead and all those coming of age eighties movies. The guy who's dating the checked at the nerd wants to go out with, right? That fucking guy that says this, what? Indianapolis. You never going to understand our quarterback is better than your quarterback. Our backup is better than your quarterback. They're better looking. They're better in the clutch. They got more jewelry over the year.

Speaker 1:          00:26:27       How do you like dad? Chimor say, what the fuck are you going to bitch about it now? I love it. I love all I'll, I'll Jimmy has to do is just get one more victory. Fucking terrible. Tom Comes back all fucking, you know, fucking anger. Snort. None of his fucking flared out nostrils. A Nice pissed off. 38 year old Tom Brady coming back to fifth game of the season to get the fucking Indianapolis Colts, the old fucking spank and they deserve, it's going to be tremendous. I can't fucking wait. Oh, can you imagine the dream of all dreams is the Patriots go for no and the fucking colts go oh and four and then we hang that fifth loss around their fucking head and then I guarantee you there'll be some sort of fucking rule change spearheaded by Jim or say I'm telling you the, the, the, the biggest bullshit suspension of all fucking time. Biggest bullshit. Suspense of all time. Fucking vikings. Heat up the ball. Get a $50,000. Fine. That's it. Jesus fucking Christ off poor Tom Brady. But this is is, is Matt Nay good looks and his supermodel wife and is a hundreds of millions of dollars. This poor bastard has to sit there and rest.

Speaker 1:          00:27:41       Oh, he's going to come back fresh as a daisy. It's going to drive. It's going to drive cold fence. Nuts. Do you have any idea how clear his pores are going to be having not sweated for four fucking games? All coat fans a shit and right now, well it's your dead. He's going to be rusty. Tom Bailey. Rusty is better than any Indianapolis Colts fucking quarterback in the history of them being an in Indianapolis. Now if you want to go back to Baltimore, they got Johnny Unitas, alright. But Baltimore is a real fucking football town, which is why this such Baltimore, such a great football town, they accepted the sad sack, Cleveland browns and the second day went there. What happened? The whole fucking thing turned around. The whole thing turned around. They got out of the pollution and the vibe of Cleveland and look what the fuck happened. You know what I mean? But there's hope now for the startup. Cleveland browns. All right, so to the Gallagher part, two of the Cleveland Browns, right? The ravens sold direct to them. The original Brown sold direct to the fucking the junior ones. Right. And now the Cleveland, they then, now they want to fucking championship right now. All they need. Like this year I'm jumping on, I've got to jump on the Fucking Red Sox bandwagon. This is how much I'm on the bandwagon. I'm going to name every red sock. I know right now. All right, big PAPI

Speaker 1:          00:29:07       in Petrolia. That's all I fucking know. I told you like fucking 2010, you know, by then like the 90th fucking person had tested positive for roids and I gave up on baseball. It was just like, all right, either fucking make this shit legal or get it out of the game. I'm so sick of getting excited about shit. That's six years you'd tell me it doesn't really count. So, um,

Speaker 4:          00:29:33       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:29:34       You know, this is the best time of fucking year. I can't wait. Uh, and my tooth, my first team is obviously the red sox and then my second team is the, uh, the Cleveland Indians. And then of course I got to root for the cubs so I'm not a bad guy. Roof my own team. And then whoever's had the longest fucking drought and root for them. You can't get mad at that. I, I have an idea right now and I don't even want any money for major league baseball. I have got an idea. This is for people like me. All right? We're all of a sudden your teams in first place in September. The only reason why I'm not paying

Speaker 1:          00:30:10       right now for the MLB package is you're gonna make me pay for the whole fucking season. All right? This is what you should have come September 1st. You offer, uh, you offer the Mlb Bandwagon bandwagon package. All right? You charge people for a month. I mean, I'm telling you right now, you leaving a bunch of money on the table, all right? Cause there's a whole bunch of fucking, especially if it's a team like the red sox, they got fans all around the world, the world, the world, you know, Yankee fans, Yankee fans really have fans all around the world. And I just traveling, you will always see Yankee gear the same way. Like over here, if you're going to see some fucking a soccer where you're going to see man United for the longest fucking time. So the amount of fucking money that you're leaving on the goddamn table telling him, just throwing it out there, the Mlb bandwagon package, you know, you know what and you let the people sign up and then what you do is whatever team they sign up for a is like a gift.

Speaker 1:          00:31:12       You give them like a, uh, like a prewarn out baseball hat with the team logo on it. Like for me, like a red sox one, you put like a little salt there. You don't make it seem like I've been working out where in this fucking thing for years when I really just got it, you know, just a suggestion. Just throwing it out there. Oh, by the way, so somebody sent me a great link. Uh, I should retweet. This is um, you know, had the origins of all the NFL football teams. So I went ahead and looked up the rams. Now that I brought up that question, like how do they, how do they become the, the rams when they started in Cleveland, there's no rams out there are mountain sheep, whatever the fuck they call them. Uh, just turns out somebody related to the people that bought the team was a big fan of this college team. And a lot of people don't realize this for the first, like I think decade and a half or so of, um,

Speaker 3:          00:32:01       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:32:01       You know, I mean, a couple of decades for the first couple of decades, college football was way bigger than, than the pros. The pros was considered boring and that, and old guys and no one gave a fuck. And all these colleges because they'd already been playing there like a 30 year head start had all these followings already. I mean, the Ohio State, Michigan thing was already happening before the NFL even fucking took a snap, I believe.

Speaker 3:          00:32:24       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:32:26       Might be wrong on that. It's been a while since I read up on that shit. So anyways, um, the way that they came up with the rams, there was somebody associated with the first people that owned that Cleveland Ram Franchise. And that person was a big fan of this college program and football program. And their, their mascot was the ramps and they were very successful and everything. So they took the same thing. So that's how you got the Cleveland Rams. Um, and by the way, here's the sad tale of Saint Louis Sports.

Speaker 4:          00:32:59       All right. Um,

Speaker 1:          00:33:03       I read this the other day, so I'm going off the top of my fucking dumb dumb, so I might fuck this up. Saint Louis, as far as their football goes.

Speaker 4:          00:33:14       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:33:14       They have lost two different franchises now, but here's the, here's the reason why they can't be mad. I'll tell you next time I do a show in St Louis, this is going to be a rough one, you know, is they got the cardinals from Chicago.

Speaker 4:          00:33:27       Yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:33:28       Saint Louis Cardinals started in Chicago and then the now Arizona car started in Chicago. And how they became the cardinals was, they just had these red jerseys and they said it was a cardinal red and then it just stuck with them. But they never put the bird on the side of the helmet to 1960, believe it or not. So they started in Chicago. So this is like when Ray Allen came to the Celtics and then he left for the heat and everybody was getting pissed in Boston. Like, Oh, what the fuck? That guy's a trade. It's like, dude, that's how we got this guy. All right. If you sign a free agent, it just put, as a sports fan, you have to understand that's like dating a stripper. All right? Don't fucking get too emotionally involved in that person. All right? That person has figured out that sports at the professional level is just that it's a fucking business so they don't give a fuck. They're going to bounce around the God damn leak.

Speaker 4:          00:34:18       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:34:20       So anyways, stay. They fucking started in Chicago, moved to Saint Louis, was there from like 1960 or something like that in 1950 [inaudible] to 1987.

Speaker 4:          00:34:30       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:34:31       Then they left. Then they got the Saint Louis Rams in 1996 and they stayed there for 20 seats. Uh, 20 years. 21 seasons, and then they went back to la. All right. An La got 'em from fucking Cleveland. So La couldn't get mad because you got them for Cleveland. Saint Louis can't be mad that they went back to la cause you got them from La, you know this, these are these StreetEasy, these hoary stripper fucking franchises, which why it would be so fucking perfect if Oakland ends up in Las Vegas much to their fans, sorrow. I mean that's one of the biggest hoary franchise of all fucking time where the Oakland Raiders as well. We're going to move to la. It's better here. Oh fuck this. Oh we get take us back Oakland. And they do with open arms. Oakland went back in with open fucking arbs and look at them now. Now they're talking about how they're going to fucking move to Vegas. That's a travesty, man. That is a fucking travesty. I think that the city of Oakland ought to be able to retain the rights to that fucking logo because that's the best logo, best uniform. Certainly in football, if not all a sports. And um,

Speaker 1:          00:35:43       yeah, somehow retain it the way the fucking brown state. It's like, all right, you want to fuck you Cleveland fans too. It's like, all right, you want to fucking go to Vegas? Yeah, go be the be the fucking Vegas gamblers, you know? Um, you know, but NFL would do that because they're so fucking pure, even though they, I, you know, it's funny, I can't even remember the name of that fucking gambling site that they were in bed with last year. Was it daily something or other

Speaker 1:          00:36:07       draft kings. Remember those guys? Everybody fucking walked away from that shitter. Um, because everybody bitched at the state level. They're like, hey, you're cured. You're gambling in our state. This, we don't approve of that. You have, fuck you, you don't approve it. This is all those kids that draft kings fucked up is they didn't give everybody a taste. If they gave everybody a little taste off the Skimm like casino, give them the skim, every state would have been fucking fine with it. But anyway, so getting back to St Louis, so they've had two s sports franchises. They've never had their own, though. They were never awarded a fucking franchise, which I'm, I'm calling right now is going to happen maybe in the next 20 years. When all freckles is 68, closing in on 70. Still doing pullups still doing the podcast, still yelling at his fucking whatever the fuck it is at that the computer chip in his head at that point. Right. I think that they're gonna build a fucking state of the art stadium and they finally going to get their own fucking franchise.

Speaker 1:          00:37:11       Okay. Not some, not some fucking, uh, you know, you know, in some retread or some bullshit like that, right? Some old shoe, you put a new sole on, fuck that. They're getting a brand new one. Um, so then you move to that basketball, they had the saint Louis Hawks, right, who I want to say won a championship. I know we beat them in the NBA finals and like 58 or something like that. They fucking move to Atlanta. So they've lost one basketball team. They lost to fucking football teams. And then he, that brings us to the Saint Louis browns. The Saint Louis Browns were initially were designated, I guess to be in Saint Louis, but for whatever fucking reason they played one lame duck year in the early like 1900 or something like that. 1899 assumption. Like I said, I read all of this stuff a few days ago. It's not like I'm some fucking, I don't take it to this level, but it just, for me, it was interesting to me, they fucking played in 1,901 season lame duck in Milwaukee and weren't actually called the brewers.

Speaker 1:          00:38:19       Like I don't know how many years before the Seattle pilots moved over there and became the brewers. I believe that's who they were before that. That was like, and I don't know what the fuck that was, the sixties early seventies but anyways, they were the brewers for one year and then they moved to St Louis and became the Saint Louis Browns and I forget what the fuck they were named after a, they took the name from something else so that they actually one point had two teams. They had the Saint Louis Cardinals, which is still there, thank God. Right. And then they had the Saint Louis Proud to Saint Louis Browns, eventually moved to Baltimore and became the second coming of the Baltimore Orioles. Cause the first port of Baltimore Oriole team moved to New York, was called the New York islanders. And then they became the New York Yankees. Believe it or not, they originally from fucking Baltimore Self. That brings us back to Saint Louis.

Speaker 1:          00:39:10       All right. The Saint Louis Baseball cardinals and the St Louis Blues. All right. That stuff that has to be the heart of the city. Even though, you know, the St Louis Blues had been breaking their fucking arts every year. They still, you still got a level right. And the cardinals, other than the Yankees have the most, the most championships with like 11. How fucking nuts is that? That's the closest team to the Yankees. It's still 16 a decade and a half of winning straight plus one year. Um, no wait, is that right? Yeah, yeah. Anyways. Um, so they've lost two football teams, a basketball team in a baseball team. They've lost four fucking teams. Okay. And I'm trying to have empathy for the Saint Louis Fan, but at some point people of Saint Louis, you gotta be looking at yourself and you got to start asking the right questions. Like, what am I bringing to the table?

Speaker 1:          00:40:05       What am I not bring it to the table that is making this franchise turn around and look up in the stands and be like, we gotta get the Fuck Outta here. You know, you've got no one to blame but yourself, Saint Louis not fucking with you. Um, it sucks. Hopefully they'll get their own, they'll get their own franchise some day. They deserve it. Right? I would think so. Like the level of hockey fan and baseball fan. I mean, Saint Louis Fans, people, uh, routinely say are the greatest baseball fans out there, you know, as knowledgeable as Boston, red sox fans without a, what's up g? It's going on, don't you feeling all right buddy. None and none of the aggression, you know.

Speaker 1:          00:40:45       Um, so anyways, so that should be enough time, right? Oh Geez. I did 40 minutes. They did a little overtime for you there. Um, I want to say there was one of the things I wanted to talk about. Oh, so I, I watched the first rams game. I've decided that, uh, I'm gonna, you know, I'm going, I'm going to root for the ramps that they're out. I mean, I'm Patriots Fan, but like I'm going to watch them out here because, uh, it's cool man. There in the division with the cardinals, 40 niners Seattle, I never get to watch this division. It's fucking great. And uh, I was sick of watching charger games for God's sakes. Jesus fucking Christ, you know, this is certain diseases, certain level of fucking uh, masochism you have to have to be a fucking San Diego charger fan. I don't know what the fuck they did.

Speaker 1:          00:41:29       I don't know if that stadium is built on an old native American grave site. I don't know what the fuck those people ever got. Dad Did. But Jesus Christ, Jesus Christ, not only the way they lose the way they just rip those people and maybe they're just paying the price for the absolute most perfect weather in the United States. San Diego, something has to give. What do you want? You want perfect weather, three 65 or you want fucking 16 Sundays, you know of right there Fred. You know what I mean? That didn't make sense. I'm saying you the tradeoff, the tradeoff is you get the old right there, Fred for 16 Sundays out of the year, three 65 minus 16 is three 49 of beautiful, of absolute fucking beauty. Most people would take that. Certainly not sports fans. All right, I think I'm done here. Yeah. That rams camp, Jesus Christ.

Speaker 1:          00:42:20       Was that a fucking, was that brutal of what Steve Young said? The funniest shit. And if you guys caught a right before halftime, he goes, uh, he, they showed, I guess, um, the rams have some high level draft pick or something like that. Or are they traded for somebody? It's like a backup quarterback or some kid just learn it. And Steve Young's like, yeah, he's going to stand there on the sideline, you know, hold a clipboard and a, you know, just watch and try and learn, you know, and then he paused and he goes, I don't know what he's learned. Yeah.

Speaker 6:          00:42:44       Tonight. I can't believe the only had 85 yards of total offense, something like that. It seemed to me like they add a little more than that, but um, whatever. So I'm happy. Philosophy. Angela, she finally got NFL football back here. My condolences to St Louis, but I'm calling it right now. Putting the good vibes out there. The next time you get your own. Not a fucking retread. Not the Jacksonville Jaguars. Moving in at the fucking Oakland Raiders. Fuck Vegas. We're going to Saint Louis. You're going to get your own.

Speaker 2:          00:50:05       Slash birth please.

Speaker 6:          00:51:07       You know a few weeks ago somebody was asking me, Oh, you know, they wanted to break up with somebody and I was saying, listen, you gotta listen. You know, the person who has it down how to do the breakup was minivan men podcast, own celebrity star Al Madrigal. But if you don't have time to email Al Madrigal just listening to ll cool j a big old, but I don't know why. I never really listened to him when I was growing up. You know, Mama said knock you out. Oh, did chic? Is that what she said? Ll Cool J I don't care. You know, I just wasn't into it. And his deodorant and his armpits when he was jamming with those white guys. I just, I never got into it. But lately, lately, I dunno. I Dunno what happened. I, Geez, just come onto my youtube shit. I don't know what it is, but I was listening to some of his stuff.

Speaker 6:          00:52:05       Oh, I know why. Yesterday I was trying to remember like, what was that song he used to have that I'm the type of guy and you're the type of guy, but what the fuck was that? And then I listened to it and I kind of liked it, but I hated that. Oh, we owe part of it really annoyed me. I'm like, oh, that's why I never downloaded this shit. But then on the side they had a ll cool j big old, but you know, I play drums at Michael. Let me hear what this track sounds like. Can I put it on? And he basically teaches you how to break up with a girl and that song, but that rap or that, uh, that rhyme, whatever, however you supposed to say it, he breaks it down and just in like fucking 11 seconds, he sits his girls down.

Speaker 6:          00:52:50       He's basically hanging out and like some sunglass hut or some shit and some girl comes in with an insane ass and he does what every guy does. He stares at and he thinks I want to fuck that. But Oh shit, I have a girlfriend. So what does he do? Does he sneak around on her? No, he goes home and he sits her down and he says, listen, I met this girl named Tina. Okay. Tina's got a big old, but I know that I said I'd be true really whiteness up. But Tina a big old butt. So I'm leaving you. It's, I mean that's just fucking air tight. You can't fuck with that. He was 100% I don't know. She could get mad. I think that's that. I think women's show expect guys to be lion weaselly pieces of shit that if you actually hit him with that level of honesty, I think they would just be stunned. Just like the check in the video. Like I didn't think that that was bad acting. I think that they would absolutely be stunned if you just came home and said, listen, I met this girl. I know that I said it'd be faithful to you, but she's better looking than you, so I'm breaking up with you.

Speaker 6:          00:54:11       Oh well what is the comeback? There's nothing that'd be like if your girl came home and said, listen, I know we're together, but this guy, you know I met him at the mall is Dick is twice the size of yours and he's got a better car. So it's kind of a no brainer. Amati what are you going to do? What are you gonna do with your little dick in your fucking Domino's pizza? It's over. You just got to fucking be like, you know, you only go around once. So, uh, yeah, I, I, I get it. So anyway, so if you don't have time to a email Al Madrigal, which you should, which you should just listen to a ll cool j big old bud.

Speaker 6:          00:54:58       You got to see his face when he goes. So I'm leaving you. It's, it's w I don't, can't explain it. It's way meaner than it has to be. That's what it makes it funny cause there's a way to read that where you're kind of letting them down easily, you know, but he, then he just did it like, yeah, this is how it works. So they, you'd go look at that on a holiday. Um, anyways, this is the Monday morning podcast. It is the end of May. Everybody. All right. How many days are in May? 30 days has September sodas, April and November. All the rest have a bunch of other dates except for February. Yeah. Go Fuck yourself with your song. Um, so you got 30 31 fuck, what is it? April has 30 June has 30 maze. 31 I got the little thing. I can click right here. Oh, I have a computer. I don't need to think right. It has. Why is it in September? Oh, for Christ sake, do I have to click another button? It has 31 days.

Speaker 6:          00:56:09       All right, so you had till have you guys have until Thursday midnight to make something of May, 2012 all right, are you on a fucking relationship? You don't want to be in? Do you want to be in this? You don't want to be in, in June. Why don't you celebrate the end of May by getting out of your fucking relationship and sitting down and basically just go with the ll cool j vibe. Hold her hand and just go straight up honesty and then what she going to do. But what's he going to do if they're going to flip the fuck out, but the the die has been cast to ship is said sale. The ball is already rolling, the sun is setting, the rain has fallen. Whatever the fuck you want to call it. It's out there. Just put it out there. Let them scream and yell. And in your head as much as it sucks, you're going to be like, okay, I did it.

Speaker 6:          00:57:05       I did it. Now I just got to sit here and get yelled at and uh, how long could somebody really yelled before they lose their voice? An hour, 90 minutes and an hour and a half. I'm going to be in the car listening to ll cool j driving away from that thing I didn't want to be in. All right then. I know I talk about this shit a lot, but I think a lot of people are in situations like this and they don't know how to sit. Somebody dumb it just say, so I'm leaving you.

Speaker 3:          00:57:35       Yeah.

Speaker 6:          00:57:37       You know, if I was ll cool J and I stop, you know, selling tickets and all that type of shit, that would be a side business that I would have. I would take,

Speaker 7:          00:57:45       okay,

Speaker 6:          00:57:46       that little fucking rhyme that he had and I would custom do it for everybody in their life and just, and then people could just write you all right, I need to charge it. You charge them 100 bucks and he would write you a, you know, four bars. It all rhymes and you just get out exactly what you say it, you know.

Speaker 7:          00:58:10       Okay.

Speaker 6:          00:58:11       Just be like you eat with your mouth open. I know I said that. That'd be true. But you eat with your mouth open so I'm leaving you. It just get right. You just get right down to it. Your mom is a fucking con. I know, I said I'd be true, but she's fucking always coming over here and something that rhymes with Katya and I, you got, you got the idea by Jesus Christ. What am I going to be yellow?

Speaker 2:          00:58:47       One thing was missing.

Speaker 6:          00:59:12       Oh my God. Here's one for you guys. My boyfriend wants to have his four skin restored. By the way, how fresh and new are these, uh, these emails here? Just because it's coming from the female perspective. I love this shit. All right, that's saying, I don't want guys to email it, but I would like to have a nice balance here. I already say enough shit. Trash and women. So it helps if women come and trash and guys, because, uh, I, you know, it'll, it'll be a nice balance here. All right. My boyfriend wants to have his for skin restored. Dear bill, I wanted to get your take on a situation I'm in with my current boyfriend. Uh, I'm a girl. All right. A few weeks ago, my boyfriend of two years told me that he's become totally upset that he circumcised and wants to restore his for skin via taping and stretching methods. What, and basically why he wants to do this is because everybody, they say that, um, intercourse you, you lose like, I don't know, some percentage of sensitivity when you have, you're forced skin removed and um,

Speaker 8:          01:00:21       okay.

Speaker 6:          01:00:21       All I can say is no guy can tell the difference whether he has a four skin or whether he doesn't. Because unless you got laid when you were fucking six weeks old, you don't know what you're gaining or what you're missing. So I don't understand why you would do this. So t by restore his forced can via taping and stretching methods, she goes, I know, I know. It makes me want to throw up just thinking about it. I want him to tell him, I think he's out of his mind. Uh, but I don't want to hurt his feelings. The thing is, I'm totally grossed out by the idea of for skin penises are gross enough already. There's no need to make it even grosser. Uh, you know, what am I the only guy that totally agrees with that? Is there anything more fucking disgusting? Then I'll fucking flacid for skin covered dish. I didn't know what it looks like.

Speaker 8:          01:01:19       Yeah,

Speaker 6:          01:01:19       it looks like I got a fucking, I don't know what it looks like. I, it's, it's just fucking disgusting. I don't even have like a reference.

Speaker 6:          01:01:33       Looks like an Elephant Dick. I don't even know what to say. It's just gross. It's fucking disgusting. Um, she goes, obviously I can't tell him how I feel. He's clearly having a really hard time with this. He tells me that he feels violated and disfigured. This guy's a pussy, this throat, this throw this guy into the fucking pussy, Ben, and get on with your life. He also claims that for skins has a lot of advantage for both partners, but it's hard for me to totally buy that considering the fact I have slept with a couple uncircumcised guy and I didn't notice any extra pleasure. Although I did use a condom with both guys. Yeah, he's full of Shit. He's full of Shit. It may be more pleasure for him. I don't know what I mean. I think it's amazing that women will put a dick in their mouths, you know? At least you can do is try and tidy up down there. You know? How about happened? Little fucking empathy.

Speaker 8:          01:02:29       Okay.

Speaker 6:          01:02:30       I've asked you this discussion. It's just fucking extra skin. Yeah. Nothing more sexy or then extra skin. Yeah. Yeah. It's like your Dick used to be obese and then lost a ton of weight, but didn't have enough money to have that surgery. They get rid of the extra. Ah, that's gross. There's another two paragraphs, people just just preparing you for another two paragraphs of having an uncircumcised stretch taped dick in your head. Anyway, I think it's absolutely disgusting and totally weird that he wants to do this and I'm starting to get really turned off by the idea of sleeping with him while he's stretching out. As for good, he told me he's going to tape it

Speaker 8:          01:03:13       okay.

Speaker 6:          01:03:14       To an elastic strap, which is going to tie around his leg. I know. What the fuck is he just coming up with this shit on his own. I told him that he should see a doctor before he starts to do this, but he doesn't want, but he doesn't think that doctors know much about this sort of thing. Oh, so he's just going to take it in his own hands. Congratulations sweetheart. You're dating a fucking moron.

Speaker 8:          01:03:40       Okay,

Speaker 6:          01:03:41       come on. This is the father. You had children?

Speaker 8:          01:03:44       Yeah.

Speaker 6:          01:03:45       Coming up with, you know, taking an erector set to his fucking Dick. It was, it's the you.

Speaker 8:          01:03:51       Yeah.

Speaker 6:          01:03:51       Do I have to finish reading this?

Speaker 8:          01:03:54       Yeah.

Speaker 6:          01:03:54       I'm thinking of breaking it off with them really. Course you are. I thought he was a normal guy, but I had no idea he had all this freaky shit going on underneath the surface. Anyways. What do you think about all of this? You got to go ll cool J. Yeah, it's got to do what he did.

Speaker 8:          01:04:16       Okay.

Speaker 6:          01:04:17       You're stretching out your fucking Dick. I know. I said I'd be true. You're stretching out your fucking Dick. So I'm leaving you go fuck yourself. It's over. Yeah. Fucking gross. Anyway, what do you think? All this, am I justified dumping him away or would that make me an insensitive comment? No, it would make you as strong person.

Speaker 8:          01:04:41       Okay.

Speaker 6:          01:04:42       All right. You go with your gut on this one.

Speaker 8:          01:04:47       Yeah.

Speaker 6:          01:04:47       This guy is trying to to do the impossible, like, uh, like he said, fucking scientist in that Michael J. Fox movie back to the future.

Speaker 8:          01:04:57       Okay.

Speaker 6:          01:04:58       He's basically, you know, doing the Delorean bullshit with his Dick and he doesn't want to go see a doctor. Any doctor would tell them, you can't do that.

Speaker 8:          01:05:08       Okay.

Speaker 6:          01:05:08       You'll be funny though, was if you dumped this guy right, and it actually works and then he starts screaming like Billy Mays on TV with his, his Dick Stretcher and he sells it for 1995. It makes a zillion dollar. I'm just playing devil's advocate here. You know, there's a 99% chance you're doing the right thing, but there is a 1% chance you could be walking away from a, a potential millionaire. Cause I gotta be honest with you, if that guy actually pulls this off, no pun intended, he pulls this off.

Speaker 8:          01:05:43       Okay.

Speaker 6:          01:05:43       And he's able to do it with some household material and then he, you know, Pete, they already make millions of dollars with those, those pills that say they're going to make your Dick Bigger, which we all know it doesn't work because of it fucking work. That would be an international story. And um, and then it still wouldn't work because then what would happen was everybody would take big dick pills, even guys with big dicks because they don't want everybody else catching up with them. So then having a little dick would then be like having a six inch dick as opposed to a three inch, four inch Dick. Right.

Speaker 8:          01:06:19       Okay.

Speaker 6:          01:06:19       It's a math workout on that or get bumped up. You've got to six, seven inch Dick. He just, he just regular, no, you're actually not regular. Yeah, you'd have a little Dick.

Speaker 8:          01:06:28       Okay,

Speaker 6:          01:06:29       so if this guy actually fucking is able to pull this, that doesn't even make sense. He's going, he, if he thought he was disfigured, now wait till he tries to fucking do this. I mean his dick is going to look like, you know when those people put that shit their ear lobes.

Speaker 8:          01:06:46       Okay.

Speaker 6:          01:06:47       They put those fucking, those circular circular things. You could shoot a God damn fucking bow and Arrow through somebody's ear lobe and not drawing any blood. He's going to do that to his deck except he's not going to have that thing in there and he's just going to be hanging out. Wrightsville we got it. It's disgusting.

Speaker 6:          01:07:56       Hey, what's going on? It's bill burr and it's the Monday morning podcast for Monday, June 25th could you hear me looking for the date there? I kind of like was looking and I, June 25th June 25th and this, sorry. I'm actually excited because doing it Sunday night, so this fucking thing is going to be up at midnight west coast time in the continental United States, which means I don't have to deal with anybody, you know, giving me shit. Yeah. They went to fleck. You know what? What the fuck right back at you. I'm going to Greg. Goddamn move my Lady Lady. You have left this state and I am all alone now and I'm remembering what it was like.

Speaker 4:          01:08:48       Okay.

Speaker 6:          01:08:50       Oh Man. I just made my freckled ass so motherfucking chicken. I had boneless id bone, those thighs too, like a motherfucker. I'm a such a stupid move. I A had a, had boneless chicken breasts. No boneless chicken thighs. Um, and brought Brock. Sorry, I can't say that word without, I can't say Broccoli without a, an Asian accent. I don't know why. I know why. Because when I lived in New York City and I was broke, there was a Chinese restaurant around the corner and I always ordered chicken and Broccoli. Okay. If I wasn't eating sketti with fucking Prego, I would call up every once in a while. I would treat myself with little Chinese food and I would call up. They like hello, number one. I'm like, Hey, number one, what's up? Can I get a good, I get chicken and Broccoli. They made chicken, Broccoli.

Speaker 6:          01:09:44       And ever since that I've said that. So just in case you thought I had any, uh, Chinese blood in me, I don't, I consider those people, my friends for all the chicken, Broccoli, they made me back in the late 90. So sounds like an apology. Like a corporate apology. I had no dealings with number one Chinese food. Uh, I did stop in there on a number of occasions. I did partake in some of the cuisine that was offered, but at no time was there any inappropriate touching underneath that filthy fucking glass that I don't think it was bulletproof. You know, I'll tell you the Chinese restaurants in fucking New York where I lived anyways when I was on the upper east side, Jesus Christ, you know what I mean? It was like you'd have some either it was either rusty, rusty, great. Between you and the other person or just filthy glass plastic or some shit. I Dunno. Why don't I don't, oh Christ. I don't even know what I'm saying. Look at my dog. Just fucking lay in there. Can you, can he get a God damn job and you know, contribute.

Speaker 4:          01:10:53       Okay.

Speaker 6:          01:10:54       Actually Jealous. Thanks. Fucking skinny as hell dude with dogs. Emaciated. Dropped her off at the trainer. I don't know what the fuck happened.

Speaker 6:          01:11:05       Yeah, we'll be, what were you doing over there? All right, let's, let's get the podcast. Let's get it. Let's get it back under control. I didn't do shit to this anyways, so my woman's out of town. My Lady, she's out of town. So, uh, you know what's funny is she keeps checking in on me. You know, what are you doing? What's going on? You know, and you don't want it is, it's one because she misses me into, because they think that we're fucking morons and she just wants to hear. I like how, what a difficult time I'm having without her, you know, like, ah, I don't really know how to make cereal like, like I'm some Sitcom fucking guy. All right? It's not, I was going down. I did the fucking laundry. I made myself a healthy dinner. A protein, no bigger than the size of my head. Isn't that what we supposed to eat? And uh, in some fun. A vegetable.

Speaker 6:          01:11:58       All right, go fuck yourself if you know what, I had a great time doing it. I haven't cooked in years. And you know why? Because my woman is oppressive in the kitchen. She loves cooking. So anytime I go to cook, she comes in there. She's looking over my fucking shoulder. Just why you kind of come up that way. Why don't you think you're like, I fucking fuck you. You fucking do it. Why? I'm fucking trying to make you a God damn meals. One of the nicest thing somebody can do for you. Prepare a meal for you. Just sit there. Shut the fuck up and let me do you think. What do you think I did? 800 800 gut damn garbage kids before I met you. She just gives me shit about the way I make my eggs because she, you know, we, he says, I always, whenever I make scrambled eggs or whatever, like there's too much egg gets stuck to the fucking pan and it's a pain in the ass to watch, to wash.

Speaker 6:          01:12:52       I mean, you know, it's like, I'm sorry I don't spray it with, you know, fuck the ozone layer Pam. Every God damn time dripping with the shit and when it doesn't stick, I'm surprised it doesn't fucking slide right off onto the floor. This is, you know what, this is what, this year just listening to a pathetic man whose site that he's finally in his place by himself and he can just deliver his entire argument without being interrupted. So, uh, I'm telling you, she wants to come back and as much as she wants the place to be neat, she wants it to be a fucking disaster. She wants to feel needed. She wants to feel that I am fucking lost without her and I'm such a cunt. I am not going to let that happen. This place is going to be spotless. It's going to be ready for one of those movie drill sergeants.

Speaker 6:          01:13:43       You know those guys that get in your face, you know he can come over here and bounce a fucking quarter right off my God damn face ever. Whatever the fuck they do off the beds. She's the very thing I wouldn't ever make it in the military. I'm supposed to be able to bounce a fucking court. Why? Why you supposed to be able to bounce a quarter? Why does that somehow make me uh, you know better at fighting the enemy. If I can throw dirty change at a blanket and then, and then catch it like the fonts. You know, what happened to you sir? What did you really want to do? Get? Oh, did you really want to do this and scream at Pete? That was your, that was your dream to scream at people for your entire fucking life. That's what you wanted to do with that Hitler Fade.

Speaker 6:          01:14:32       Do you know Hitler had like a fresh prince from Bel Air Haircut mixed with a Martin Sheen in apocalypse. He was Martin Sheen, apocalypse now on top. But he had like, he had a fade down below that, that will Smith's character with the eight ball leather jacket would have, would have loved you would've loved it. I'm sorry. I've been watching a lot of shit about fucking mass murderer lately and he always comes up. Of course. You know what I mean? Gay and have a think about mass murders without Hitler, right? Just can't fucking do it. Can't have a rock show without Zeplin man, stairway to heaven. You know, that's what it is. You got to fucking ham. That shit in there. So I'm, so that's my goal. That's my goal. And I'm actually wrestling with this. Should I leave the place a little bit dirty so she feels like wanted or should I be, should I just go fucking like, you know,

Speaker 6:          01:15:30       just come with the pimp vibe. Like this place is fucking spotless. All right? So you need to be on Umi. Need to mind your p's and q's. Whatever the fuck those letters stand for, what does it stand for? Somebody is going to know somebody actually knows what, when you know, when you say mind your p's and q's, there's some Douche. Listen to this. Yeah, you're a dose. All right. That knows what the fuck that stands for and they've just been waiting for somebody. You'll fuck it up all excited so they can be like, I know what it means. Well, send me a god damn email and by the way, I haven't said the email for a while here. Oh, what a segue. Fucking classic right there. I should teach a fucking podcast class. Uh, you know somebody's going to do that. Someone's got to teach a podcast class the same way somebody teach a comedy class and that's what you do when you're failing.

Speaker 6:          01:16:18       Whenever you're failing at what you do, you teach it. All right, there we go. We just insulted teachers. Um, all right, the email is bill@themmpodcast.com. Bill at the capital m, capital m, capital P odcast.com bill at the end, podcast.com. All right. If you don't fucking know what it by now, just hit stop and rewind on your little player and you'll be fine. Um, oh, by the way, can you guys, I know, I really appreciate all the input and all that stuff that you guys send to me because God knows if he didn't send it to me, I wouldn't be able to do this podcast. See without you, I'm nothing is, they slowly dim the lights and I go into some sort of pandering fucking song like that Jackson Browne song singing about the roadies. Like he gives a shit, you know, I think he fucking pissed them off and they weren't set in his piano upright. So he wrote them a song just so they stopped fucking with them so he could get worried of his tour and then somehow he goes out of that. Right? Just fucking the whole thing is, I hate pandering.

Speaker 5:          01:17:29       I don't like it.

Speaker 6:          01:17:30       And you know, the only one of the worst part of pandering is watching a performer go on stage and pander to the audience is watching you fucking animals. Eat it up. Eat it up every God damn time,

Speaker 5:          01:17:42       okay?

Speaker 1:          01:17:42       I go to jail. You Sob did we played a lot of cities but Hartford, you guys, you guys are the best in every way.

Speaker 5:          01:17:52       Okay?

Speaker 6:          01:17:53       Give me a fucking break.

Speaker 5:          01:17:56       Okay?

Speaker 6:          01:17:56       There's nothing good about Hartford.

Speaker 5:          01:17:59       Okay?

Speaker 6:          01:17:59       You know, you don't believe me? Ask The whalers. Why do you think they left? You couldn't even hold onto the fucking whalers. How does that make you feel? Hard for too.

Speaker 5:          01:18:10       Okay.

Speaker 6:          01:18:11       You know why they left? Because that's stupid ass song. You splay. Bam, Bam, Bam, Bam. What's it called? The the, the brass city orchestra.

Speaker 2:          01:18:20       [inaudible] good.
