Speaker 1:          00:00:01       Hey what's going on. It's Bill Burr. It is time for the Monday morning podcast for Monday July 9th 2018.

Speaker 2:          00:00:11       When a man loves you will he'll do some dumb shit like get a ring.

Speaker 3:          00:00:20       Then all of a sudden he's married he's like What did I do.

Speaker 2:          00:00:25       Did he will say Are you mad at me.

Speaker 4:          00:00:30       She'll just shake her hand and say no.

Speaker 5:          00:00:34       And then she'll treat you like shit for the next five days what's going on.

Speaker 6:          00:00:46       It never ends.

Speaker 7:          00:00:46       People never it's.

Speaker 8:          00:00:51       How are you. What's going on. I'm out here in a heat wave. I'm still getting over this fucking ball that I caught.

Speaker 9:          00:00:59       I don't know what I have it you know they're just lingering. I'm just I'm all congested.

Speaker 10:         00:01:05       You know don't take it down. Put it over your head and then sit behind your car and have somebody stand it up. All right. You make sure you have a lemming in your mouth.

Speaker 11:         00:01:15       You know that's what it might swat my fucking day has been like for the last eight days. Everybody has it's fucking hilarious. All these people who aren't pharmacists right.

Speaker 12:         00:01:27       All of these people have never invented anything in their life. I mean even just some dumb shit like you you take some wire and you fucking twist it. Then you bend it and it's like look for nineteen ninety five.

Speaker 11:         00:01:38       It's your very own but it's your right back massager Yeah.

Speaker 13:         00:01:46       They've all been telling me how to fucking cure this shit and it's just like okay all right I'll Oh I'll try that.

Speaker 14:         00:01:51       Oh what you say zinc the man over there in the plaid shirt says zinc What are you what say you vitamin D. You say vitamin D but you would say yeah. I feel like I'm on a game show right. When you are the price is right and everybody's yelling out a price like a different number and the person's looking with their deer in the headlights that's what it's like when you have a fucking cold. By the way me and my wife who isn't mad at me who isn't.

Speaker 13:         00:02:15       Not not talking to me but isn't actually really chatty either you know. You know you get them out of that mood you're happy you can't say it out loud.

Speaker 15:         00:02:27       You can't say I don't you know I don't give a shit anymore at this point.

Speaker 9:          00:02:30       I've gone through enough hours of torture here what you do is you just think you know what. I don't give a fuck. And they are so smart they sense the second you do that and then immediately they want to sit down and talk about it because once you give a fuck the game's over okay.

Speaker 13:         00:02:49       And they don't want you to settle into not giving a fuck because then you won't be able to listen to their lecture and nod and go OK. Yes I will work on that. OK. You know what.

Speaker 16:         00:03:01       I didn't know that. Oh I'll do I do that. Is that what I do. Wow. It's it's so great to have somebody outside myself to let me know what it is that I'm doing. You know you're like a mom like just going around my fucking the planet of my head observing not a moon honey.

Speaker 11:         00:03:18       May maybe be like a an alien aircraft you know of higher intelligence.

Speaker 15:         00:03:24       Does that make you feel better.

Speaker 13:         00:03:27       Anyways it was on godly fucking hot ungodly fuck it was the hottest it's ever been it was like palm desert out here it was 109 fucking degrees on Friday and I'm not I'm not even talking about in the valley. Maybe that was the valley. I don't know what it was but it was like you were what it was like. I feel like I was standing inside a dryer and I've used that reference a lot but this time was like Oh yeah I could dry my clothes in this you know by the way those idiots who like you could fuck and fried egg on the sidewalk you could probably do that when it's like 80 degrees out.

Speaker 12:         00:04:03       You know I mean it'd be like frying it on low.

Speaker 9:          00:04:07       I don't know what it would be like me you know but like on Friday when I was 109 degrees out at around 2:00 in the afternoon I like your shit would be over medium before you even flicked it then you wouldn't have to season it because of all the rock salt right. For those you back east and so the inevitable happens is there's then after human beings in their own way have made it. I don't know how many degrees hotter but we have made it harder. I think even scientists that wear red coats a red ties even they have been like you know we're kind of having an effect on the environment. I mean if gypsy moth caterpillars have to be stopped I mean what about human beings. Say what you want about gypsy moth caterpillars. You know they they don't make you know nuclear waste they they've never you know invested in plastics you know they're pretty green for what it is that they do right and they are part of nature so they probably really don't need to be stopped by an outside force like us we're stopping them for our own fucking survival.

Speaker 9:          00:05:22       And the problem is his mother nature up until this point has been bringing a knife to a gunfight with like fucking gypsy moth caterpillars it's some bullshit like that and I think now she's realizing that she needs to go down to the local fuckin what he called the place to go down to the place where there's always like a bad keyboard in the fucking window pawnshop go down in the pawn shop she's gonna get herself a fucking heater boner powder a burner whatever the fuck you call them and I'm fucking a boner she's going to come out with a fucking dick move she's going she's going to do a reverse Bruce she's gonna fuck all of us in the ass with the weather I think that that's sort of a stretch to say I have no idea but all I know was you know it was fucking insane. So the inevitable happens is then there's a power surge there was like nobody on the roads like that's how fucking hot it was everybody was just staying inside sitting in air conditioning like Oh my God.

Speaker 13:         00:06:21       And that fucking guy out there and then we all after making it harder you know I'm not saying it wouldn't be answered four degrees or whatever.

Speaker 11:         00:06:29       I don't even know if we made it five degrees higher or whatever but we sit inside and we don't get to feel we don't feel the effects of what the fuck we're doing. It's like buying a shirt. You know what I mean. You don't see the fucking 8 year old that sewed it together. Does this shirt make me look good. Right. It's like it's painless. So now we're all sitting there in the AC and inevitably we don't have enough power.

Speaker 17:         00:06:55       So now they have to have a blackout. Now where are they going to do it. Okay now I already gave it away. Okay. The keyword here is Blackout Black would be the keyword. You know I don't you know where they did it but I know they didn't fucking go.

Speaker 12:         00:07:06       Well we have to shut down the grid somewhere. Where should we shut it down. Should we shut it down in Beverly Hills or fuckin Bel Air or these people with their fucking infinity pools that fall off into the goddamn ocean with their panoramic views.

Speaker 18:         00:07:23       You can only see the roundness of the planet.

Speaker 12:         00:07:26       You know these people with their MTV Cribs stocked fuckin refrigerators they're giant carbon footprint or now. Now

Speaker 19:         00:07:38       those people fund our campaigns.

Speaker 12:         00:07:40       Let's fuckin let's if I can go down here. These people who can barely rub two fucking nickels together will shut down their shit just an evil fuckin world.

Speaker 13:         00:07:54       And oddly enough this weekend as I sat in my air conditioned house you know not in Beverly Hills but not the hood either. You don't know me like if I was on a chessboard I wouldn't be a pawn but I wouldn't be in the castle either.

Speaker 20:         00:08:10       You know I don't think I'd be the horse I wouldn't be a bishop I think I'd be a rook you know basic forward sideways you know weight gain no lateral fucking movement went dark diagonal I'd fucking trip over myself or try to run a fuckin it or an outright route like a fuckin horse I would still think I'd make it you know cause the fuckin bride can do whatever she wants right.

Speaker 12:         00:08:40       John all the goddamn power at the fucking king they'll just sit there back it up Whoa whoa hey guys surround me she's pissed she's pissed or she said she's not pissed but she's not talking to me.

Speaker 21:         00:08:50       She is but you know what I mean it's really quick and serviceable conversation would you like some dinner okay. It's ready salmon likes talking to nothing.

Speaker 22:         00:09:16       Anyways they should have like this is such a hacky idea of what they should literally. I wish they had right now if they had like a fuckin like a relationship to me or someone must have done a bit like this. Like you have like a relationship.

Speaker 9:          00:09:27       Meteorologist you know what I mean. That could give you a five day fucking forecast. Let you know what kind of coat to wear. Basically what kind of kind of shit am I going to try to avoid. So I don't step into it. You know what I mean. So anyways I'm in the fucking house right. And you know I got the kid now and she's getting bigger and eventually she's going to need her own room. All right. And I have all and I don't even have a lot of shit but I have all I have a lot of shit. I didn't figure out a lot of shit. I wrote a lot of furniture but I have a lot of shit you know just over the years going on the road buying a little thing here little thing their fan giving you something the venue giving you something and all of a sudden you just got a bunch of shit. And then what happens is if enough time goes by Easter I don't know I'm sentimental. I start to develop feelings for it and it's hard to get rid of it.

Speaker 23:         00:10:33       Well I don't have a choice now people.

Speaker 9:          00:10:38       So in the near future I'm going to I am going to have a massive massive fucking giveaway of memorabilia and shit and an old drums stuff. And like you know I try to give some people my my old drum magazines and just nobody wanted them all these fucking young kids are like you know I stick it out and fold bra. And is good fucking I can read this on my phone like I like. I don't know what like you'd think I was handed and like a hammer and chisel in a rock and be like you I draw pictures with this. So I didn't feel too bad because they're made out of paper although I'm sure the ink is bad for the environment. But I I put like 20 years of all of these fucking magazines that I saved like I was going to go back and peruse through two decades of fucking drum magazines and I kept some of them you know John Theodore's the fucking Nico brain the fuckin Steve Jordan you know all the way back all the drummers and I fucking love right. Tommy Lee you know but then you know the latest ones were the easiest ones to get rid of because I'm an old man and I probably didn't know a lot of those players although I probably should but you know I don't know I just wish I could go back in time and that by anything you know Jimmy The Gent don't what the fuck that I say don't buy anything you know as much as he was a murderous psychopath he was very environmentally conscious in that part of Goodfellas you know.

Speaker 9:          00:12:30       So anyways just giving you guys a heads up I I got it all out in front of me here. I got it all laid out. My wife who's not mad at me is. You know she was like Well what do you get like a storage shed. You know you like this stuff and it's like I'm not fucking doing that I'm not doing that like whenever I see those places I get like I have a fucking almost a physical reaction to them when I see a storage facility. And it's the second I did that before and I fucking do with them. You have to go back and check in on your stuff. It's like your stuff went to jail and then you know.

Speaker 24:         00:13:16       You can just fuckin hang on a second I got a fuckin text escape back.

Speaker 15:         00:13:27       There's no way for me to continue talking.

Speaker 25:         00:13:28       Call you in in a 45 minute anyways.

Speaker 24:         00:13:43       This just than you do in the George Carlin bit. You just have shit just spread out all over the fucking world and it's just like if there's not like.

Speaker 7:          00:13:54       Fox shut up all right.

Speaker 9:          00:13:59       If there's not Roman it in your house. Like we have more rooms that could be bedrooms and people here. Okay. It's just me why I want my wife for my daughter. So there's no fucking reason why there should be no room other than the fact that we just have too much shit. And I'm not throwing it out. I thought the magazines because I made out of paper and I don't obviously give a shit about it but I'm really trying to fucking think about where this stuff is going to end up. OK and I don't know. So I'm going to try to like you know I figured if I could just take some of this shit if you guys wanted. You know I'll just fucking give the stuff away or whatever. I hope some people aren't going to get mad cause some of the stuff is like shit that venues have given me you know some sports jerseys with my name on the back of them and stuff which is fucking cool or whatever but like you know I'm not going Oh I'm not I never wore it and I always appreciated the gesture but I just took it and I put it in a box and then I just started piling these fucking things up and I don't know any fuckin room I don't know what to do with them so my new fuckin thing from here on out fifty fucking years old is Jimmy The Gent I'm not fuckin buying anything I'm not buying anything you know I'm trying to get my wife on the same fuckin page but you know you know that's not work it ought to be Jesus Christ telling her not to go on Amazon is like her telling me not to get shitfaced on a Tuesday I mean it's just not happening by the way speaking of drinking I haven't drank you wouldn't know it from my voice sound like shit but I haven't drinks at the end of June and it's so it's so fucked up it's so fucked up how it's just like food I made the same relationship with food that I have with booze that I do is I just fucking walk away for a few days what the fuck am I doing when I see food walking away it's like sugar and shit and bad food and I start eating well and then all of a sudden if I look at bad foods I want to fucking eat that and I feel that way and I do the same thing with booze like you know when I'm drinking and I see a bottle of booze I swear to God it's like you know it's backlit at the bar I mean it just looks like you're drinking life it just looks golden you know so inviting and then when I just stopped drinking I just looked at him like Jesus I don't fucking mess with that shit.

Speaker 7:          00:16:38       What the fuck did I do now.

Speaker 8:          00:16:41       What I got to apologize for I know I'm wrong that's the worst thing about it you know what I mean Jesus does it ever fucking end you don't I mean it's like when I was a kid my mother was mad at me and I didn't she wouldn't tell me I got to fucking figure out what I did I love on all these fucking tv shows where they sit there and they always sit there they talk about how we're living to see twice as many fucking words in a day and how they got great at communicating it's like No they're not they're not then I go to communicating.

Speaker 9:          00:17:09       They speak in fucking riddles. Can you tell she's home. I keep whispering so speak in fucking riddles. I'm so no body mind today younger right.

Speaker 17:         00:17:19       Now sit in a telephone like to which you're going to understand about a woman is by the time they're eight they get the whole fucking thing planned out. Not all of them but enough of them. He is still sitting there playing in a fucking mud puddle or jumping off a jungle gym going Hey Mom look what the fuck I can do whatever kids do nowadays you know fucking dancing with your fucking toy robot whatever you guys do. They got it all planned out. That's why. How many times guys have you been out on a date with a woman and she said some shit to you that sounded like a riddle and you're like What the fuck.

Speaker 16:         00:17:50       And then you answer the question then she goes I know you're supposed to say blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah. Like I didn't know there was a script nobody sent me the sides for my part like they have the whole fucking thing the whole fucking thing mapped out.

Speaker 21:         00:18:10       And you basically you have three options you really just accept it or die alone.

Speaker 12:         00:18:23       Or you go out by a wife beater and you become that guy and she don't want to do that is he playing women it's a mythic village.

Speaker 26:         00:18:36       Shut up. God. Just fucking around. You know I was on Twitter right.

Speaker 15:         00:18:43       And Sony wrote some fucking hilarious smart ass thing about me.

Speaker 12:         00:18:50       So I clicked on their profile because I was just like you know that is above average shit talk. Is this another comic. Is this an up and coming comic I don't know. I was like go with a comedian level funny so I went to this person's thread and I you know read a little blurb figure what they did so I scrolled down to try to figure out are they a comedian look for a standup picture and one of the things this person had retweeted was from this.

Speaker 13:         00:19:14       Something something feminist was talking about Donald Trump and and was saying like Donald Trump just made fun of the victims of me too and the crowd roared with approval period. And then again she wrote roared with approval right and then she had the leg.

Speaker 12:         00:19:39       Oh my God oh my God are you kidding me. This is what he did today. This guy's fucking crazy.

Speaker 27:         00:19:44       So I clicked on it and he made a roundabout reference to me to you know he was using me to the way some people use millennials which is not right.

Speaker 13:         00:19:55       I'm not saying it's right to do that but you know I'm not trying to be a cunt here but I am a comedian and I've been on stage for 26 years. They did not roar with approval okay.

Speaker 21:         00:20:08       He got a chuckle he got a polite chuckle.

Speaker 8:          00:20:14       I'm not saying they weren't meat heads. I'm not saying what he said was back in right. But the crowd did not roar with approval period.

Speaker 11:         00:20:21       Roared with approval and it just as a comedian that fucking annoyed me because I went back in the day you'd see these fucking comics get offstage after I crushed a fucking crushed NBC if I could. You got the job done.

Speaker 16:         00:20:36       That's not telling. You can't stop walking around saying you killed it didn't Donald Trump didn't kill OK. If that was his fucking audition set for a club and those were the laughs he was getting.

Speaker 27:         00:20:48       They would say you know what. He's he's not ready yet.

Speaker 16:         00:20:52       Well I'd say he's not funny. He she she was getting some laughs but he was all right buddy. I don't think he's ready for a weekend spot yet like he was getting like Monday Tuesday level laughs.

Speaker 9:          00:21:04       Like back you know when there was some sort of fucking system in the clubs when they would actually build talent. They used to have you know Monday was like an open mike night at Nick's. And then the big deal was your next move and next time you stop in Boston the next move was the host Billy Martin who's now like you know one of the made men over there at Bill Marshall. He then had a show Wednesday night at the Kowloon and that was the first big fucking move out of the open mikes. I got a spot at the Kowloon and you'd say that to the other open makers in. Did you just burn through the crowd of open makers doing it for a burger spot at the Kowloon. And then I remember thinking like the first time I did a spot at the Kowloon.

Speaker 17:         00:21:52       I was so fucking nervous because this was the first time I went out in front of a crowd that was not expecting to see an open maker. They did not go to an open mike show going all right. Let's see what these fucking people have or I'm here to see a friend of mine like they came out to see a comedy show and they were like All right we're gonna give you that we're gonna hand you the keys for five minutes let's see what the fuck you do right.

Speaker 22:         00:22:15       So I would say I would say that that's where Trump was in that speech.

Speaker 9:          00:22:21       He was doing five minutes at the counter all right. This has nothing to do about what the fuck he said or whatever but I did find it interesting though. But that's how she heard it.

Speaker 25:         00:22:31       She heard them roaring with laughter Yeah like anywhere you fucking elicit a Trump go in fake news Fake news like it wasn't necessary.

Speaker 22:         00:22:48       Well sometimes it's fake but it's more just people hear shit and then whatever they're passionate with it just it raises the fucking levels you know like you know with me this you know you know you guys at this point if you listened long enough you know this shit that sets me off.

Speaker 28:         00:23:08       All right.

Speaker 17:         00:23:09       And like the amount of fuckin times I lose my shit and I think it's go it's going a certain way. And then I find out not only am I not right I am 100 percent. It's a complete 180 it's going in the other direction.

Speaker 9:          00:23:23       Now I'm not saying that this woman should not have been upset you know and also get upset that people chuckled you know but they did not roar with laughter. I'm just being a country comedian right now. You know there's just certain things that people say that that goes into the terminology terminology of a comedian. And it bugs me. Like the thing that I you know I talked about a part a year ago or two years ago was this fucking phenomenon where all of a sudden people started saying I love when the comedian heckled the crowd it's like no no the community doesn't heckle the crowd. Comedian gets heckled a heckler goes to a performance and tries to disrupt a performance speech.

Speaker 21:         00:24:12       Anything that is a heckler all right for a comedian to be heckling a crowd.

Speaker 18:         00:24:18       The crowd to be had to be collectively giving some sort of fucking performance that he he's interrupting.

Speaker 29:         00:24:25       All right.

Speaker 21:         00:24:27       You could say the comedian snapped a loved one you fucking just lost your shit on that go.

Speaker 27:         00:24:34       But I'm not heckling the crowd like oh look at I you sit in your seats.

Speaker 7:          00:24:41       You call that a show. Sorry. Whatever. So anyways how many documents and that's 24 minutes got them then a bad day pay a bad at all.

Speaker 16:         00:24:55       Hey let's talk about World Cup soccer huh. What's what. You know Asia we talk about NFL football. I know the theme song.

Speaker 30:         00:25:04       I don't know what the the World Cup thing is you know but I've watched enough of it that I know in the end they're going to go to the wrap up with the fashionable lady.

Speaker 9:          00:25:17       Then there's the old black guy looks he's like you know fell off a stool at a pub. He's probably some old fucking football player you know. And then there's the excitable like sort of fat guy who looks like you with the mustache.

Speaker 22:         00:25:31       You know that may allow to say Latino as a white guy. I mean he is a latino dude. He looks like the guy though when the first guys that gets killed in a fuckin mob movie and then the other ones it seemed like they just we had a revolving chair like I recognized this black dude with dreads as being like. Wasn't he on our fucking Team USA Team.

Speaker 8:          00:25:52       Oh by the way I finally figured out how to fucking tell who the fuck is ho.

Speaker 9:          00:25:59       In a world cup game if you didn't get there at the beginning this is how works at American TV on Fox Sports they basically right next to the team name.

Speaker 18:         00:26:10       They'll have the smallest little sliver of color and that's the color of the uniform like I watched Russia first Croatia and I'm just sitting there literally waiting for somebody to fuckin score so I can figure out who the fuck is who have set their course you know if I can get it all to three hours I'm kidding man it was it was a fucking unbelievable game but I finally just figured out now some explain it to me on Twitter I just start tweeting about go and you know I I don't I don't know who the fuck is who here you know and I had this weird thing like I didn't know who to root for because there was something so fucking funny to me if the Russians won the World Cup I would just would have been so awesome.

Speaker 9:          00:26:58       Listening.

Speaker 22:         00:27:01       Two people losing their shit over here and getting all wound up again saying that they you know tampered with the election over here you know and then everybody just starts yelling at each other again it's just I was looking forward to that. You know just adding to the fucking heat out here. But anyways it was an incredible game and I can not fucking I root for Croatia. You know although every time they cut to the Russians in the crowd I was just like you know those are some good looking people. You know there's really no middle ground with Russians so you know what I mean. Already Eastern European. So either they'd look like fucking supermodels or they look like it's still like medieval times. You don't mean.

Speaker 9:          00:27:42       I mean they got some women over there that looked like they could easily fucking impress some NFL scouts you know in the in the we know the NFL Combine when they're pushing up to 25. How many reps they can do much. You know. Course they wouldn't get drafted after the 40 but I'm just saying that they. You know. But then they got some other ones it's like Oh my God. Gorgeous.

Speaker 22:         00:28:04       I'm fucking with you I'm not saying that you know there's not a lot of weird looking Americans but that was one of the really cool things looking at that thinking of all the fucking bullshit that goes on at a political level. You know with the missiles and all of that shit and then just to watch all these Russians losing their fucking minds every time Russia would score a goal so long story short that's their game with the Croatian crowd. Same thing.

Speaker 20:         00:28:30       Fucking really good looking people that I mentioned that I'm gonna be doing an Eastern European tour at the beginning of next year you know and I will be bringing all of Europe fuckin good looking numbers down a half a degree during the time in your fucking country.

Speaker 31:         00:28:48       Please come up to me in your native tongue and tell me that you can fix my bald problem balding problem. It's a bowling ball that you can yeah I can fix that. I am the greatest in Transylvania.

Speaker 14:         00:29:02       That's why I approach people on the street with my fuckin business card.

Speaker 28:         00:29:06       I'm sweating as I'm watching this fucking game and like I'm doing the typical American thing like.

Speaker 32:         00:29:12       I can't think you will do this. Look at this level. Fuck you you'll be sued soon.

Speaker 15:         00:29:16       Do you love doing that shit and all of a sudden Croatia scores a goal and I just don't. I couldn't control myself. I just fucking lost my shit right.

Speaker 9:          00:29:29       And then Russia comes back immediately. I believe I watched some of the games I forget. They fuckin scored and fucking the Russian fans are going nuts and I'm like all these motherfuckers you know you know me I'm always good spirits today. Vladimir Lenin and Putin you know he's got it he's got the fucking he's got the it's got the invisible hand you know and then Croatia scores and it's fucking 2 to 1 there's like barely any time left and I just I almost made my daughter jump out of the chair in the other room I yelled so loud when they scored and I was like Holy fuck this is gonna be on bleep that fucking guy number 10. Number 10 is a beast of Croatia right. And there's like no time left and all of a sudden Russia gets like a fucking corner kick and I was just sitting there I had my hands over my mouth just going like Oh no no come on come on. And then he fucking kicks it this beautiful whatever the fuck you call it you know it was like a pass into the slot you know in hockey like a sausage pass just right over everybody's fucking head and it just goes right to this one Russian dude who just makes it glances it off his head into the back of the net and I just go.

Speaker 12:         00:30:46       And every time I yelled I've surprised myself.

Speaker 13:         00:30:49       I can't believe how fucking into this game I saw my wife and my and my daughter are getting ready to leave. And I'm like I'm sorry I. We can't leave. I have to see the end of this game. She's like Are you serious. Like is that this is yet another thing that you're fucking into.

Speaker 9:          00:31:06       I'm like Yeah I go it's the shoot out whatever the penalty whatever fuck they call it and I sat there like literally like I was like that Tarkanian guy like chewing on a fucking towel. I was in the kitchen yo because I had to keep you know leave in the fucking room and I had like the fucking towel you dry dishes with to make my wife is gone you're going to throw that in the hamper I'm like I'm fucking non on the thing and just the level the level of fucking pressure. And if you miss one of those penalty kicks and your team only loses by one like you just get shit for the rest of your life you know I mean there was a guy in Columbia and they don't know if he got killed because of that but me it's pretty fucking suspicious. It was an incredible game.

Speaker 18:         00:31:51       And like it's safe to say that I 100 percent get it and I actually love the game now.

Speaker 21:         00:32:00       There I said it. I love soccer. It's a fucking great game. I finally get it. I fucking get it you know. And then how great the World Cup is. Where it's truly is a world championship.

Speaker 17:         00:32:14       And then what's great is if you lose okay that other team can talk shit to you for the next three fucking years and it's once every four years but you're not even guarantee that you're going to get in.

Speaker 33:         00:32:31       So when you get to that fucking close when you lose. Now I get it. Now I get why I'm sitting there watching grown man cry who are in their 50s and 60s because they're sitting there going like it's not going to happen in my lifetime.

Speaker 8:          00:32:46       I'm going to die without ever see them holding up an astoundingly small trophy for a true World Championship to see how big the fucking Stanley Cup is. That's 30 teams 30 one whatever the fuck they're up to.

Speaker 34:         00:33:03       It's not the whole world. You got the whole world. Why the fuck is the trophy so small.

Speaker 3:          00:33:14       It's so funny when they win it and they all try to run around with it.

Speaker 22:         00:33:16       They're all like know trying to hold it up there like bumping heads and shit like they keep their cake they should make it bigger. You know what. That's classic fucking. That's how an American thinks. That's how we think you know bigger is better. It is. And you know something as much as you guys sit there and you shit on us in the back of your heads you're jealous of it. You're jealous how fat we get. He jealous how big they make the jeans of you and your jealousy. You could actually be that fat still get down the fucking street because you guys are over there driving around in your fucking cow path you know past all your ruins in your fucking castles and all that shit.

Speaker 15:         00:43:53       All right let's get on.

Speaker 13:         00:43:55       Well we can't get onto the letters I have to talk about the F1 race.

Speaker 38:         00:43:58       That was in Great Britain back to back.

Speaker 18:         00:44:02       I'd have to say these are the two most exciting races I've seen since I've been watching which has been Monaco 2016.

Speaker 9:          00:44:08       I've seen almost every race since then. What a fucking race.

Speaker 18:         00:44:15       Lewis Hamilton was trying to get the pole position for like the eighth fucking time in a row there I think he's won like the last six or seven. He always dominates there. He had a rough showing didn't even finish it it did not finish his last one wherever the fuck they were. I remember in Austria and you knew Mercedes was going to come back strong. So the race starts all right.

Speaker 13:         00:44:35       I believe Lewis Hamilton was in first Vettel was in second Kimi Reagan and was somewhere in there. Normally they go into the first fucking turn.

Speaker 33:         00:44:46       Lewis Hamilton something you hardly ever see has a bad start. Fatal blows by Hamilton gets his fucking car going. I don't understand did he pop the clutch I don't get how they have a bad start. I don't understand that Atari fuckin steering wheel that they're doing there I don't get it. There is no clutch anymore. I don't even know what they did get a little paddle thing there I have no fucking idea but sometimes they don't hit the right button and they just go on too slow. I don't know but they blame the driver right. So anyway so they get into the first fucking turn and all of a sudden factory boats comes screaming in out of nowhere Venables in first place Lewis Hamilton's all of a sudden in third. I was like no fucking way.

Speaker 9:          00:45:31       And then out of nowhere you just see all this smoke and shit and now just go nuts in Lewis Hamilton got hit by Kimi reckoning and any fuckin spun out and he went from like one Turner to turns from being first in the race to being last and it was just like What the fuck. And then I believe at that point it was Vettel. Bow ties and then Kimi reckoning or maybe max for Stamper went up there.

Speaker 16:         00:46:03       But you know the Red Bull team was right there by the way the United States the fucking Haas team we were we've qualified fifth and sixth we were killing it until we fucking slammed into each other like assholes and took ourselves out of the points and we may be at one point I think we came in 10th means fuck it sucked but we do it better than we are doing better than I.

Speaker 9:          00:46:27       That's the team that I want really want to win anything anybody has to do with American racing but where we're having a great season.

Speaker 38:         00:46:34       If we could just quit fucking up and bought our plowing ahead so Lewis Hamilton is not out of the race he gets his car going again and which is one of my favorite things.

Speaker 13:         00:46:49       What a great driver like him Sebastian Vettel gets knocked all over the back of the race. Then you get to watch him go through the field.

Speaker 9:          00:46:57       And he was driving go in my car and messed up it's messed up the rear and they go No you find your phone you're fine and he just tears through the whole field basically up until the top five and then even when he got top five he's still like 25 seconds behind that's how superior basically Red Bull really Mercedes Ferrari is and then Red Bull and so Mercedes adopted this. We're just going to stop once like an hour if you're not into this shit. It's actually like fascinating like petting and all of that stuff. You can win and lose it. And long story fucking short is by the end of the race. Like the final five laps.

Speaker 9:          00:47:42       Because Mercedes only pitted one time and Ferrari's period at least twice because I think one time they went in like I never understand out works well with the safety car out there or whatever the fuck they call it pace car some shit right. But anyways all of a sudden with five laps left it's felt terrible task is in first place Sebastian Vettel is right behind him with fresher tires what's his face. Lewis Hamilton driving like a maniac once again with not as fresh tires because they only stopped once so they're all fucking chewed up and they're right on his ass. Is that fucking psycho. Kimmy Regan who I fucking love drives like a maniac and a 10 second penalty by the way because they said he smashed into Lewis Hamilton he didn't need to do that and he was yelling at his fucking pit crew and all that shit was fucking great.

Speaker 9:          00:48:33       So they're all driving like absolute fucking maniacs. And once again I'm screaming at the TV Young once again at a sport I never thought I would be into. And unfortunately for Vanna like his his tires just crapped out and he just didn't have enough grip and I'm sorry you felt terrible to us. I'm sorry his tires just crapped out and Vettel was able to duck underneath them and then he then he gave way to Lewis Hamilton which I thought was really cool that Hamilton was trying to stay on his ass. They just didn't have the fucking tyres. And what's his face. Bolton set it up. I think it went all the way down Fifth or Sixth but the final was Sebastian Vettel for Ferrari. Lewis Hamilton from Mercedes and that can be reckoned on the podium there was two Ferraris and a Mercedes. Sebastian Vettel is now eight points up and the Ferrari team I think is like 20 points up for the year and we've got two more races before the summer break.

Speaker 39:         00:49:37       There couldn't be any closer it's going to be fucking great fuck anyways.

Speaker 9:          00:49:47       Jesus Christ. By the way I just hit pause there. Coughing What flick another nine fucking seconds. I must read some advertising here. So anyways the next one I believe is I think it's in Germany or is it the Hungarian or is it the next two. But I got to think a lot of jeeps coming up. I hope I didn't fucking make my stupid recorder is it fucking not. Isn't recording those things because sometimes it gets bumped down in priority or another fact that works. All right. Okay. In regard to Eastern European tour. Dear Bill you mentioned planning East European tour.

Speaker 13:         00:50:27       I just want to make just one as a mention to think about visiting one of former Yugoslavian countries in the parklands. If this plan moves forward I emailed you from Belgrade Serbia but anything here like Croatia Bosnia or even Slovenia can work for local fans. Check out some stats. We have the most site visits or something as it would be interesting to see you live somewhere near. Stand up is still relatively rising here but I am sure it might be interesting for you to visit if you are around here.

Speaker 16:         00:50:59       Dude I will go there and fucking eat my balls in a second. What am I ever gonna go there. I'll be close enough that you can jump on a train. All right. Your papers please. However the fuck it works over there you know Eastern Europe scares me.

Speaker 18:         00:51:16       That is still behind the communist bloc like for most of my life. So then I know you know once Russia went out of there you guys kind of picked up some Hatfield McCoy shit that you.

Speaker 13:         00:51:30       Hadn't finished you know got a little crazy there with the fucking genocide stuff you know get a little nuts over there so you know you guys don't fuck around over there is what I'm trying to say. It's not like you're going to Canada. Oh hey how you doing. You know it's not like someone loves sex. I feel like I'm gonna go over there it's going to happen like that same vibe like Belfast had where I was just like if you didn't know some shit went down the second you go eat sleep well some fucking shit went down here and you just immediately act accordingly like I will not be fucking with anybody here.

Speaker 16:         00:52:06       All the best for you and your family. I will.

Speaker 9:          00:52:10       I'm very very excited to see that part of the world and we are putting it together. I wouldn't bring it up if we weren't putting it together.

Speaker 16:         00:52:20       All right. Okay. Possible Eastern European tour. Another one. Hey chief. I was just listening to your latest podcast July 2nd where you mentioned putting together an Eastern European tour. Look at this look at all the fans. This is two people. I knew this tour be successful. Hopefully you'll have the balls to come to Belgrade Serbia so I can see you perform in person. Well the second you tell me I need balls to go where the fuck are you from. Yeah. Go fuck yourself no go in there. Why don't I what I need to have balls to go there. Don't even talk about the weather. It's not Siberia it's Serbia because I'm going to go there and take a fucking farm tool to the side of my head. I don't need that shit. We had vampires are considered as I'm sure you'll have a blast here. I like how he scares the fuck out of me. I there. Go go to the waterpark.

Speaker 18:         00:53:14       Also I don't know when you're playing to do this tour but I'd recommend sometime between September and November. Hopefully you'll put some more specific information out of this plan. So now I was thinking like January or February. Why is that a bad time.

Speaker 27:         00:53:31       What happens in those months anyway.

Speaker 3:          00:53:34       Love your oh lows during January we everybody stays inside and they let the inmates run down the street.

Speaker 18:         00:53:42       It's like running of bulls with murder. Anyways love your shtick and wacky antics with the occasion random high jinks. Rock on you crazy bastard right. Just where you're talking. I think I'll be fine if I go over all right.

Speaker 13:         00:53:54       Obama's Money Hi Bill. I'm eager to get the shit kicked out of me on this one.

Speaker 8:          00:54:03       He signed a book deal you unread douche Oh stop it stop it.

Speaker 9:          00:54:07       I don't want to hear this shit. I don't want to hear this shit.

Speaker 8:          00:54:13       I don't want to hear this dude. He's going to go around and he's got to do it. He had 70 million dollars with a fucking tour dates. He also had that you selectively UN reading douche bag. Don't tell me he fucked you. He had a fucking 900 million dollar book deal. Obama 65 million dollar book deal.

Speaker 19:         00:54:33       All right. Wait a second wait a second. Now I'm going to fucking hit you back with my shit.

Speaker 40:         00:54:37       Obama speaking dates. Money tour.

Speaker 18:         00:54:45       Here we go. Come on man. Big number big no big number.

Speaker 8:          00:54:49       Michelle Obama tickets for two thousand eighty. Barack Obama four hundred thousand dollars. Speaking fees. Reveal what few.

Speaker 41:         00:55:00       Here we go.

Speaker 8:          00:55:02       Obama secures eight hundred grand for two speaking and we think he's talking to.

Speaker 18:         00:55:09       These go to a homeless shelter. The reason many of us have been critical Barack Obama's outrageous for those TV ads is it robs us of a fantasy that sooner or later the first black president was going to use his considerable powers in or out of office to help the economic ravages of the poor who are disproportionately black.

Speaker 9:          00:55:26       But you know a white person probably wrote this. I want to know who he's talking to huh. Who the fuck has 400 grand to throw at this fucking guy.

Speaker 16:         00:55:38       They're all. I don't I don't know how to talk to you fucking assholes. So am I really supposed to sit here and I'm supposed to think that these fucking guys like everybody with the blue tie. I just don't buy it. I don't fucking buy it. All right. OK. Sixty five billion dollar book deal. OK. After taxes sir. After taxes and all the bullshit that'll probably be about 30 billion bucks. And I guarantee fucking T you he is gonna be worth when it's all said and done about 200 million bucks.

Speaker 8:          00:56:09       OK. And it's not going to be because he wrote a fucking book. All right. He's also going to go out and they do these speaking engagements to all these corporations that they'll pay them 400 fucking grand. And these are the same people that got him into office and he went in there and did what the fuck they wanted. And this is just them washing their bribe money. I mean honestly dude what changed when he was in office that everybody is so enamored with. Did we stop torturing people down in Guantanamo that we fucking end the war over there. Are we finally going like hey wait a minute ISIS doesn't have a plane or a boat why are we acting like Germany got back together now it's the same fucking thing. It's the same god damn. It's the same guy with a different colored tie. All right.

Speaker 18:         00:56:58       I will fuckin read up on this. Hi Bill. Love these shows you work in our little world. Our most recent party you talked about the House Obama just bought and wondered where the money came from. Here's a piece that explains it.

Speaker 42:         00:57:09       It doesn't it doesn't.

Speaker 8:          00:57:12       Sixty five million dollars you don't turn around and you're only going to get 30 million dollars of that OK. And then you're gonna go out buy an 80 billion dollar fucking house you're gonna pay at the 30 year note on that paying interest on that because you just basically got 30 million dollars after taxes.

Speaker 21:         00:57:32       That makes no fucking sense all right.

Speaker 8:          00:57:36       And also I would say I would actually be willing to suggest that I am a fucking paranoid maniac that the information that you're going to they're not going to tell you. Can someone explain to me how did the Clintons become worth hundreds of millions of dollars. Let me guess they both wrote a book for one hundred million dollars each and they what they don't pay taxes. And that was it. And then other than that they like Jimmy Carter driving around the world fucking you know building houses for the poor. I never claimed sir to be 100 percent fucking read up on this shit. I'm not even 2 percent read up on it but neither are you. OK. This is not a piece that explains it. This is a piece that just shows this guy cashing the fucking sixty million is the gross he's gonna get about 30 million bucks that's it because he's got to kick in for this never ending war too. All right. So now he's got 30 million bucks. He owes 82 million. Like what is the fucking payment on that a month. Now he's going to go around and he's gonna give all these fucking speeches. Okay.

Speaker 13:         00:58:47       And at schools do not have the fucking you know I would say Ivy League schools some of these bigger fucking schools maybe they have that but generally speaking they go round and they talk to these fucking these corporations.

Speaker 14:         00:59:02       Who got him into fucking office. Hey dude what the fuck me what do you do with it but putting you know every fucking one of them. I don't I think the whole fucking thing is weird.

Speaker 18:         00:59:12       It's all weird it's all weird that he's a public servant and blah blah blah blah. And in the end of the rainbow you were two hundred fucking million dollars and you're living in the same neighborhood is all those corporate cunts who pour shit into the fucking water supply. Like the fact that that doesn't bother you on any goddamn level and you're going to just sit that way yet you get 65 million for a book.

Speaker 16:         00:59:32       I mean there you go. I'm satisfied with that. I don't think the political system is corrupt at all. I don't think it's a bad thing that now corporations can dump unlimited amount of funds into presidential candidates. I don't think that that influences their decisions on foreign policy whatsoever.

Speaker 29:         00:59:54       I don't know.

Speaker 16:         00:59:56       Hey you know what sir. Agree to fucking disagree.

Speaker 41:         01:00:00       All right.

Speaker 18:         01:00:03       Anyways I've been rather restless and despite the fact that I disagree with you I will say that there are assholes on both sides.

Speaker 8:          01:00:08       However I however believe that there is a lot to be said about how one conducts themselves which is why I side with Hillary over Trump. Yeah I love you people who like it's how you conduct yourself as long as you continue murdering innocent people. It's like it's not a problem. But but is so eloquent when they give a speech do you know why the president ages the way they do.

Speaker 13:         01:00:34       It's because of the dead bodies. That's why it's not the economy. It's not the sketches on SNL which is what always cracks me up when you see like people in Hollywood talking about how they want to run for president you're basically saying that you're so fucked in their head that that you will that you want to go to bed put your head on the pillow go and like that I do the right thing we thought they were the enemy. It turned out to be a family. There were children there. And you have to fucking go to bed. And then the next day fuck and smile and give some goddamn speech. It is the most fucked that maybe maybe they deserve the money. I don't know. Maybe I'm oversimplifying I am. I always oversimplify you know what sir I agree with you. You're probably right. You know I think that's how we got the house. He wrote a book. He could be declared duck.

Speaker 16:         01:01:26       This chick was sucking my cock clubs to do forget about Andrew Dice Clay. God bless you. All right.

Speaker 13:         01:01:32       Podcast topic table wondering if on an upcoming podcast you can talk about how your views may or may not have changed on being a stay at home mom that you are a parent yourself.

Speaker 21:         01:01:48       No they haven't changed they haven't changed. I think everybody exaggerates how difficult their fucking Jarvis alright. Listen. Being a single parent is difficult. I would say they would probably unbelievably fucking difficult. However if you fucking married you know what I mean. It's and you got one kid. It's not that hard. The first three months. Yeah.

Speaker 9:          01:02:18       You're hallucinating you know but you get somebody to help you out a friend a family member something to help you out see state that whole fucking thing where people try to do it themselves this is goddamn and it's fucking insane it's fucking insane. That's not that people didn't do that back in the day.

Speaker 12:         01:02:34       They say it takes a village to raise a child back in the day you didn't fuckin move to the other side of the goddamn forest you just built a fucking log cabin right next to your parents. That was it. They came over they helped you out.

Speaker 28:         01:02:45       Follow a grizzly bear. OK.

Speaker 15:         01:02:51       Now my views have have not changed. Other than that I gave you answer to when I watched my kid I'm fucking psyched.

Speaker 28:         01:02:59       I love it. I have a great goddamn time.

Speaker 22:         01:03:02       We play games were screaming and yelling with throwing balls all over the living room.

Speaker 28:         01:03:06       And you know I don't what the problem is. You know my buddy was bitching about something talking money or do something difficult.

Speaker 9:          01:03:18       I said Do you realize there's probably some guy from Cuba right now that you know made a boat out of the discarded desk and he's using a fucking sport coat is a sail. Trying to get into this fucking country risking the fact that he's gonna get cut sent back and God knows what the fuck out. I still don't know what exactly is the problem with your day.

Speaker 18:         01:03:43       It's what I would say ma'am is it's about perspective which is what that bit was about.

Speaker 13:         01:03:51       I'm not saying it's not a challenging job I'm not saying it's not an important job.

Speaker 28:         01:03:55       I just said it's not the most difficult job on the planet.

Speaker 13:         01:04:00       I would say that that people who fucking were trying when the lava was coming down at their house and they didn't have lava insurance I would say some more trying day than when your kid just would not stop crying.

Speaker 12:         01:04:13       You know your hero could not stop crying when that fucking lava is at the front to help.

Speaker 28:         01:04:21       Should I tell my boyfriend I'm a prostitute OK.

Speaker 9:          01:04:27       Now you and I know sometimes these these these e-mails get a little fuckin not believable. Like what am I supposed to do with this shit here. Is this actually sir. Help. Exclamation point. Should I tell my boyfriend I'm a prostitute.

Speaker 18:         01:04:42       All right. What do I do here people do I ignore this to actually act like this is real. All right let's wait until Dear Billy ball Baggins.

Speaker 11:         01:04:49       I'm a 25 year old semi single lady living in the Netherlands OK.

Speaker 37:         01:04:56       I've got good qualifications masters degree in social. Well sounds like an outgoing am I going to argue and try to treat other people with kindness and respect. God bless you. You're the prostitute with a heart of gold Adam. You really have a master's degree. I'd really like to build a special relationship in my life and I'm currently dating a nice guy from Brazil. Oh boy. But there's a catch. For the past three years I've been working in the sex industry. I like my job make good money and always practice safe sex. Oh boy oh boy. Get out of that business sweetheart. I don't want to quit as it would mean busting my ass to some corporate job working for the man. Yikes.

Speaker 43:         01:05:41       You can't just be a stripper you know.

Speaker 12:         01:05:46       No offense to strippers but Jesus Christ. You gotta shake your ass a little bit you know close yourself off in the green room and just walk away like it never happened.

Speaker 27:         01:05:57       For me it's not a big deal to balance my job in a loving relationship as I don't find the work side of things emotionally intimate at all.

Speaker 37:         01:06:07       However my boyfriend seldom sees it the same way. My boyfriend's I am sure if I should be honest with my new potential boyfriend about my profession I'm unsure if I should be.

Speaker 12:         01:06:22       Normally I'm very honest and upfront my boyfriend's about my job and normally it kills the relationship I see. I'm starting to wonder if honesty is really the best policy as the truth always seems to add extra pressure in the strained the relationship and it hurts me when I get attached to people and they finish with me. What do you think. I hope you and Nia had a nice time in Paris and go fuck yourself. We had a great time all right. Okay if this is true sweetheart.

Speaker 13:         01:06:48       Yeah. If you want to find a loving relationship I think you need to stop being a prostitute.

Speaker 43:         01:06:54       Okay. You know.

Speaker 13:         01:06:59       I understand. You know nobody understands. Not want to ending up in a cubicle more than me. But I mean it's a fucking dangerous job.

Speaker 9:          01:07:08       You know it's a very dangerous job. It's a bunch of creeps out there and I practice safe sex but you know there's always problems.

Speaker 44:         01:07:13       It's just you know. I don't know.

Speaker 9:          01:07:18       I don't know something I'm looking at this as a you know what that Puritan American fucking viewpoint.

Speaker 18:         01:07:25       I don't know if you're free you're over there man.

Speaker 13:         01:07:27       I don't know what the deal is but let's say I could actually handle the fact the physical aspects of the girl I was dating being a prostitute which I could. Let's just say I could I would be so worried. Every time she went out that someone was gonna beat her up or kill her. I mean you're in the sex industry. It's a fucking horrible industry.

Speaker 43:         01:07:51       You know I would I think you know at least I would be worried about is how I tell this fucking guy.

Speaker 15:         01:08:02       I mean the sex industry. I would be more worried. How the fuck do I get out of the sex industry. Because what's going to happen is eventually you're going to be an old prostitute all right. And I don't know what you're investing your money in Bitcoin or you know your own whorehouse. I have no idea what you're doing here but like you know then all of a sudden there's this big gap in your resume.

Speaker 45:         01:08:26       Well you weren't in a cubicle you're trying to get a corporate job and you're like you know what did you do from 2010 to 2021. Oh I I. I had sex for money. Oh.

Speaker 15:         01:08:42       Oh okay. Well all right. I don't think we have any more questions.

Speaker 46:         01:08:46       I mean you know assuming this is all true I would love it if you got out of that industry.

Speaker 47:         01:08:57       Just get out of it. You know what I mean. There's easy money in my business too. You know I could go fucking do it like a whore myself out you know. But you know what. You always leave a piece of yourself there back in that room.

Speaker 15:         01:09:13       I don't know you have a tremendous attitude. I mean you make it sound fun. I love it that you know don't get emotionally attached to making good fucking money.

Speaker 3:          01:09:20       You know this is when any woman group would be like That's because she's so numb from the Zapotec be that both you know they start throwing their thoughts into your fucking head.

Speaker 15:         01:09:30       I don't know how you're wired it might be fucking true it might not be true.

Speaker 13:         01:09:34       I don't have any if I don't know if this is way above my pay grade. I have no idea but I you should fucking tell somebody that you're you know having sex for money.

Speaker 38:         01:09:44       You know you probably want to know that because it is dangerous you know there's FTD or all that shit out there.

Speaker 13:         01:09:52       Yeah I guess I would I would you know I would tell fuck it you know I guess you can continue being a prostitute you're soul mates gonna be the person you don't have to lie to and you can't accept me for who I am. You know.

Speaker 38:         01:10:15       All right. I don't know what I got to do to get rid of this fucking called.

Speaker 13:         01:10:21       It just came on slow. My doctor was telling me if it comes out fast it goes away fast comes on slow it goes way slow I guess that's what the fuck's going on here.

Speaker 45:         01:10:30       But anyways that is the podcast. Good luck to all four teams left to the World Cup.

Speaker 15:         01:10:38       Good luck to that prostitute and Brazilian guy.

Speaker 48:         01:10:42       God bless the United States of America and congratulations to Obama for signing a 900 million dollar book deal.

Speaker 47:         01:10:50       That's how he got that house. That's how he's gonna pay for it. All you need is 30 million bucks or 80 to fuck it.

Speaker 48:         01:11:01       If I get a 60 million dollar fucking book deal and I was gonna get was 30 million bucks out of it I was getting 40 grand a night. I still wouldn't go out buy an 82 million dollar house I wouldn't fucking do it in a two million dollar house is a fuckin white elephant. No offense to the Obamas.

Speaker 15:         01:11:17       All right. I mean when you turn around to sell that thing I mean there's like point one percent of people that can actually fucking afford it.

Speaker 48:         01:11:25       You got to hope that they're in the goddamn market.

Speaker 26:         01:11:32       Do you think of flight drones are it for old time's sake.

Speaker 49:         01:11:37       Oh I was a low blow see Bill this is why people think you voted for Trump.

Speaker 15:         01:11:43       I don't like making fun of Trump it's too fucking easy there's two idiots in paying attention to him it's too fucking depressing. You know. Oh by the way that I got a of that dopey Brad thing on fucking Instagram and I can't get over that clip that little shit yelled at that bouncer the bouncer goes can I get out of my face you little shit or whatever and the kid is so beside himself.

Speaker 16:         01:12:10       He's. Oh my God. Oh my God. Do you have any idea what the fuck my dad does. I cannot believe that a man said that to another man.

Speaker 11:         01:13:01       They all walked away right but they were so convinced that this bouncer was fucked.

Speaker 16:         01:13:05       It's the point I was sitting there like I was feel like unsatisfied. Like do I want to know what the fuck your dad does do you have any idea what the fuck my dad does.

Speaker 49:         01:13:17       I just always says Oh my God oh my god oh my God.

Speaker 15:         01:13:53       I apologize to Obama and all presidents. Evidently they just do book deals. Just make 40 grand a night giving speeches to banking colored conglomerates and that type of shit. No they don't they go around a homeless shelter so they all scrape together fucking nickels that they they pay for that. I have no fucking idea. And you know what. Neither does the guy who I love how he looked up one fucking thing. That's why I just I love doing a podcast as I get a good day.
