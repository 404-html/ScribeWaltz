Speaker 1:          00:00:01       Hey, what's going on? It's bill bird. It's time for the Thursday afternoon. Just before Friday. Monday morning podcast and, Huh?

Speaker 1:          00:00:09       Just checking in on. Yeah, just checking in to see how your week's going and that type of shit. And uh, you know, we're doing this podcast. It's usually just sold freckles here talking by himself, acting like a fucking maniac, solving world problems by himself. No one to debate it. So it all makes sense. Um, and every once in a while I have a special guests, which I do. I do have a special guest and my special guests as promoted like a week ago, whatever on my podcast is a the one and only Dave Ilitch, a drumming sensation, teachers sensation, human being sensation owner of plenty of t shirts. Dave, what's going on dude? Happy to be here at brother. Yeah, welcome to the podcast. I told you before we started, I made a major fuck up on my last podcast. Yes. I called the band the specials. The smiths.

Speaker 1:          00:01:02       Okay. And oh boy. You know, that is not good at all. And that was going on and on about how much I love this set and all that and I fucked up and I want to apologize to everybody that actually met the lead singer of the band and the guitarist and the lead singer. That band, uh, said, uh, he real quick, it was just like, oh, I love the way you say the word cat. You say it right. And I was just, and it was like the greatest compliment ever. Absolutely. It's like when my buddy Joe to Rosa was in Scotland in a bar at like four in the morning. And some Scottish guy said too, it was like, oh, you can fucking drink. And he's just like, it was like the greatest compliment ever. So I got to apologize to them. Okay. It's, it's, it's my fault.

Speaker 1:          00:01:42       The fucking music I listened to in the 80s, you know, I was into the fucking metal and all these skater guys and everything up the street. My brother hung out with, uh, you know, stopped a mess and Oh, around ball. And I'm like, these guys aren't singing about the devil. They're not wearing women's clothes. I'm not listening to these guys. I mean, I was, you know, I was very, I was closed off back then, you know, so, um, you know, so you saw it, you saw it when I, I've been taking lessons with you for about what, a year and a half or so. They can come in and Margaret and all that man we get to right is, it felt like 10 I went in there, I came in there like the crypt keeper, like I'll fucking crunched over and shit, holding the sticks, wrong forums, everything all jacked up.

Speaker 1:          00:02:28       And I got to tell you like, um, you're on here besides the fact that you're a good friend of mine, you're on here because you have a new, uh, a new drum instructional video route called getting out of your own way. True. Which I actually got to watch a lot of, uh, last night and it's all this stuff, you know, that you've been teaching me, which was I was basically fighting the kit and yourself. Yeah. I was like, yeah, it was all crunched over. I was holding the sticks wrong. I was just playing uphill. Nothing was at the right. And uh, for the drummers out there who listened to this podcast, I cannot tell you like the stuff that you showed me just getting me to sit up straight, hold the sticks right and have shit where I can hit it, do to my body type. Yeah. It's made so much stuff that used to be really difficult, like borderline effortless now, however, I still suck because at the end of the day, no matter how much you teach me to sit up straight, I am still at the mercy of the talents that I was blessed with. But um, but I'm still, you know,

Speaker 2:          00:03:31       yeah. But it's a whole different ball game than when I first saw you man. I mean, oh you work your ass off too. It's like I can show you show people how to do things, but at the don't put in the work, nothing's going to change. You know, you work your ass off. So

Speaker 1:          00:03:44       I'm a lunatic Dave. Yeah, I know. I get into shit. That's my point. That's exactly what I'm saying. That's why I always stayed away from hard drugs because I would have like, I'd have like a fucking monogram coke spoon. I would just be, I would be a coke heads coke head. I know if I did it. So I try to, I try to send it into a positive areas. So, uh, it's a good point. Well, look, I gotta ask you, I don't know if I've ever even talked to this talk to you about this, where it's just like, so you grew up in northern California, you said Hell or this Hella Dad, I'm sure. Right? Yes. I got made fun of a lot when I moved to La Sacramento Kings Fan. Maybe I didn't see the sharks

Speaker 2:          00:04:27       for hockey when I was,

Speaker 1:          00:04:28       oh fuck. I just realized, I mean this fucking leather chair, if this is gonna make a bunch of noise when I'm moving around like that Benny Hill sketch, you'll see that one where he wore the leather pants when the great sketches, no, every time he had to deliver a line, he would walk across the room and it was just a sign of his leather pants and he was sitting down crossing his legs and then the other person would talk fucking genius. I have to check it out. Um, anyways. Um, so when you start, what made you like want to play drums? Like what got you started? What band?

Speaker 2:          00:04:55       Oh, what band? You know, I don't know if there was a, I mean I had a friend who was taking drum lessons and I like slept over at his house. I was like nine or something. And he's like, all my drum teachers coming over to give me a lesson. And I was like, oh, hang out and watch. And then I was like, oh, this seems fun. And then I sat down and I could just kind of do it like it was you had that gift? Yeah. It was like, oh, I can kind of do this. And uh, I'd never really had that experience before, so I just immediately got hooked. Uh, and so I was like nine or 10. So this is like 93 94. Right. So this is like

Speaker 1:          00:05:31       God, I'm old when I was 25 and 26. Yeah, that's crazy. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:05:37       But this is like old dude. But remember when we were sending each other youtube clips about, uh, um, I sent you that faith, no more clip and you sent me the was a skid row. Is that what it was? I don't remember. Probably skewed. I love skid row. It was that, it was like SNL performances and yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:05:54       Oh my God. Skid row on fucking SNL and it was like the same year and it was like check out the, we were talking about the shift in music like right around like 91 92 I think it was. And it was like how, like right when grunge and all this stuff was coming out and it was just like hair metal to grunge was just like, you were like, what the fuck they was. It was abrupt. Yes. It was like a, how a lot of divorces go down in la where there's like the day after the prenup expires, Bam, divorce papers. Thank, that's the way the musical shift was. But like as a kid, I was, I at that point like, uh, what year was that? When, when, when think it was [inaudible] 91 [inaudible] 92 yeah. Yeah. And that's good roll album. I fucking love that album. Right.

Speaker 1:          00:06:41       And they were crushing. Crushing, yes. Sebastian's voice was just like this one of the great front men. Yes, absolutely. Of all time. And I had, I didn't see that shift in music coming. I think a way a lot of those bands didn't, cause I remember when Nirvana came out, I was like, what the fuck is this? And I couldn't really even hear how good a band they were. And then that first video they had the teen spirit when he was like doing like uh, uh, basic solo and he was kind of acting like he was doing the tap on Solo. It was clearly making fun of all the guys that I like. Totally. I was like, dude, fuck these guys, fuck this band. And it wasn't until I saw them on unplugged and I got in Utero and everything and I was just like, wow, this, these guys are making like this is a beautiful album night.

Speaker 1:          00:07:30       And it took me, but it took me like two and a half years of of being like, wait a minute. The 80s or over? Yeah, because I'm old now because you have that shit juxtaposed right next to each other and you're growing from spandex and lipstick and straightened hair to like flannel shirts and Glam thing was only about three years. Okay. It was right around 85, 86 everybody got the kick started dressing like men again around 87 88 they had a round table meeting and we're like, look, stop blowing up the hair. Let's go back to, let's try to get a limo, Allman brothers here and a little less, uh, grease, whatever the fuck they were doing. But so yeah, so that was the scene I was growing up and when I started playing was what we're talking about right now. So you missed all, all this shit. You would just, you know, 10 years old. I mean, I mean, I definitely listened to a Shitload of Phil Collins when I was like a little Katie's Phil Collins or like, like the later stuff that everyone makes fun of. Well [inaudible] yeah, I mean, you know, yeah. I wasn't like listening to that song specifically, but like you're sure about that.

Speaker 1:          00:08:34       A little bearded 10 year old day dancing around sue sue Tsuneo I did come out of the wound with a beard by the way. Oh, you did? Yeah. Just always been hearing. It's what it is. That's why you went to the drums. You were fucking animal. That's true. I've heard that more than once. Um, did you, uh, so then when, when, when you, uh, when all that grunge stuff came out,

Speaker 2:          00:08:56       was that just sort of music to you as opposed to like being like all this is a choice. You weren't old enough to realize like, wow, we just went from this to that? Not at all. That's what I'm saying is like, because that happened. I remember listening to sir, it's actually funny like saying this, like, I listened to it so much Phil Collins, but I would hear like new wave stuff or 80 stuff like tears for fears and be like, oh, gross. And now I love, love that stuff. Right. But at the time it was like the least cool shit ever. You know, I went back to the eighties a bunch of times going, oh wow, this band was actually pretty good. Yeah. Yeah. And it's, and a lot of that stuff is so like interesting and esoteric and weird ways that you check it out now.

Speaker 2:          00:09:38       And some of it's aged poorly, but some of it's aged in like a really cool way. Yeah. I didn't like a lot of just the sound. Yeah. Shit that came out in the 80s, whatever that sound was, I saw somebody sent me a video and you know about how they came up with that, that sound for the drums, right. That was the Phil Collins [inaudible] sent me. And that was just a complete accident where there was a Mike on in this studio and somebody played a Phil. Yeah. And it was, yeah, it was, it was in the control room or something like that. Phil Collins was apparently, there's various stories, but apparently Phil Collins was playing drums on one, a Peter Gabriel's solo albums and he was trying out fills or whatever and someone hit the talk back, Mike. Uh, so if you, you know, for people who haven't recorded in a recording studio, when you're in the control room, you hit the talkback Mike and they, you can then hear what the person's saying, uh, or, or if you're in the studio or tracking drums, you can't hear what anyone is saying in the control room.

Speaker 2:          00:10:37       Right. So they have to hit a talk back Mike a button so you can hear what's going on. And basically they went to talk to Phil and they hit the talk back Mike and he played a drum fill over that and the, the, the talkback might picked it. I'm just got super blown out and they were like, whoa, that was crazy. It was like a complete accident. And that's how that gated, like Peter Gabriel was like, I liked that sound. And then, which is probably, I imagined a cool sound initially and then it, it, it was just overused and then, and that's how everything happens now. It's totally like in vogue again, like everyone, I mean it's sort of starting to get overused now, but it just went through a whole thing over the past five years where that was super hip again. Let's go on in my business right now where they just, they, I don't know what's they just rebooting everything that I already watched that just going the point through IMDP to be like, is this guy still alive? Do you think he wants to do a WHO's the boss again and fucking now who's the boss? Uh, I'm trying to think of something more obscure than that. Um, she's the sheriff. Is that a show that wasn't show? Really no reason why. I know that is because a friend of mine was on it for a couple of episodes and he said at one night and it was just like, dude, that's one of the great fucking references. I don't even know what that is. That was a, uh, beautiful

Speaker 1:          00:11:54       woman who was on, um, Suzanne Somers. Um, she started it and evidently she was a sheriff. She's the sheriff and she was just this hottie who was the sheriff and everybody had to listen to what she did. It, you know, I think it was for like people who were into like dominatrix and like women tell him that piece of shit and they're under arrest. It was sort of something, there was an underlying sexual thing. Everything that was done back then, you know, you can't do any of that now. Now she'd be a fucking hero, you know, whatever the fuck I, whatever the, you know, the pendulums completely swung the other way now. So every guy's a fucking taking his dick out and peanut and on a plant blocking a door. And women are all like fucking Joan of arc. There's no middle ground, there's no middle ground. That's what it is. We're going to go from not listening to women to not vetting any of them and then saying every fucking guy's a complete piece of shit through some of the shit that's coming. Like some of these guys got friends of mine now. It's like literally ex girlfriends who are mad that they're famous now. Totally just coming out, going like, oh,

Speaker 2:          00:12:53       lives get ruined. They're like, man, I don't like you anymore if I'm going to ruin your life.

Speaker 1:          00:12:57       I mean, well, the fact that this, if, if, if there's gonna be no due process, I mean, who is safe? No one. It's crazy. Yeah. I think it was emotionally abusive and said, I haven't got it. I've got emotionally abused and like at least 85% of my relationships. I spent the last fucking week in my own fucking house on eggshells. What? Back in a good place. But it's just constantly, you know, emotional abuse. I mean, women have the fucking market cornered on that. This is, this is a different podcast. So anyways, that's a different topic. So your, your, uh, your, your, your, um, uh, instructional videos. Yeah. You put it though, first of all, you know, you're, you're already ahead of 90% of people. Just by the way it looks, the quality of the way it's shot because so much of it is just somebody, you know, literally wearing a Gopro, staring into a mirror, why they play drums. So you supposed to try to fucking learn something out of that.

Speaker 2:          00:13:51       That's, well, that's exactly why I made this thing. I mean, I've been teaching for like 20 years and I work with, you know, a lot of pros, a lot of my contemporaries, a lot of big name dudes who are out in the real world touring with big bands. Um, in addition to me touring and recording and, um, I never, you know, I always wanted to do an instructional thing, but with the way technology's evolved with Instagram and youtube and everything, like everyone's a quote unquote teacher now. Yeah. So, um,

Speaker 1:          00:14:21       by the way, there's, so there's this inside thing that I always see something and I think it's fucking amazing. A drum thing and then I send it to you and you're just like, eh. You know what that reminds me of is when I, you know, it's when people come up to me and then they just pick like some, somebody super popular at the moment, like, what do you think is so it's, that person is really funny. Huh? He got to be like, yeah. I mean they're up there talking and well Mike, yeah, they're on stage doing things. Yeah. They're saying things that people are really reacting with. Laughter. You just have to say straight up facts. Yeah, I know. I what I do, I just like, I would never take down another comment publicly, but on the phone with my friends or which it is, we fucking eviscerate so many people and then eventually it comes around to us and then we just start trashing each other and just laughing our ass off.

Speaker 1:          00:15:13       And then the end, everyone we trashed, we just go, Hey God bless them. Bless them. They're out there. That's what it's all about. I do that same shit too. I have text threads with friends of mine where we do with the same, same thing and were just as brutal to work to each other and towards cells. Do you know how many jokes like back in the day when I, when I was working in the comedy cellar in New York, how many jokes I lost, how many shirts I could never wear again. And all of this cause we sit, just sit there and like the guys used to go down and they would watch you on stage and they would be staring at you with like the, it would be Patrice rest his soul. Oh Man. Uh, Voss Norton. And they would just stand in there in the doorway.

Speaker 1:          00:15:50       We could see and none of the crowd could see him. And you had to like totally commit to your fucking act. Wow. And uh, I remember Kevin Hart when he first fucking came down and he's like 20 years old and they were doing that to him. And I remember he didn't get rattled. He did a little bit. And then the first time and then he didn't and we'll have to once he didn't get rattled and I remember thinking like, wow man, this kid is uh, he's got the force. Wow. Yeah, because I was sitting there, those guys were all my contemporary. Sure. We were like 10 15 years older than Kevin and these guys are my contemporary. Then I could fall. I was like, Oh God, they're going to stare at me. And then you almost felt yucky. Deliberately had to say something to bomb or some shit like that.

Speaker 1:          00:16:26       So I don't know. Do you guys ever do stuff like uh, do you have a watch to go out and see, see if like for a comedian to watch a friend of yours bomb. If not, if it's like if the set means something, but if they just stuck there and they try a joke and they just eat shit, it's one of the funniest things ever. Like when you watch a friend of yours play drums, they go for a fill or something. If they eat shit on it yet it's totally different. Just by the nature of what your doing. So much of it is just throwing shit against the wall and seeing what sticks and just being like, Hey, I fucking try it like that. I love Comedians and I respect Canadians so much because you know, I'll go around town and see you or other builders go out one night and go to the comedy store or something and someone will walk up on stage with a slip.

Speaker 1:          00:17:07       I've seen you do this and a bunch of other people like, oh yeah, just like, Oh, I'm just working some shit out. Oh yeah. You know, like subjects like Ah, that didn't fucking work. You know, and, and like that, you can't do that with music. Like people were there to see a show and they botch something. It's like you, you want to put up a bit about the, uh, the jam section. Isn't that what you guys call it? When you look at each other then you just wait and like there are, there are like this, there's not a different musical situations with this. There's some bands go out like we're planning exactly like the record. Sure. And then there's other people, like if we play it like the record one more time, I'm going to blow my brains out. Can we? Yeah, absolutely. And there's certain situations where you can jam and improvise and uh, you know, like I would do that

Speaker 2:          00:17:50       with the Mars Volta or like, or like anti mass. There would be certain sections or are we just go way out into outer space for half an hour. What was that like when, when you got that Gig and, and you had to follow? It was crazy. All of those amazing drummers that were in the band, all this shit that they came up with and didn't even have some like something ridiculously, uh, a short amount of time they have to learn it and all that. Um, basically, uh, I got the call to do it. And um, and Juan, the bass player who, who used to play bass in racer x, by the way, for the last, I heard of the band. I don't know who they are. Okay. I'm sure I'll fuck up their name on the next podcast. We'll talk about eighties in spandex and feathered hair. They're pretty deep into that scene.

Speaker 2:          00:18:38       But yeah, so Juan came over to my studio with a fellow Bass player. This Guy Jonathan Hirschi, really good buddy of mine now. And John came over just to watch me like so, so Juan came over and we plugged in my iPod and he's like, do you know this song? You know? And I'm like, I don't know. I've never played along to this stuff. I just kind of like the first record. So one's playing with me and John's just sitting there like two feet in front of me just staring at me, watching me like, and then Jesus Christ. Yeah, I know it's stressful and a, and I never played the music. I was just like, I kinda know this thing. Or you know, just from being a fan of that. What sort of prep did you do before then? Nothing. It was like, Hey, I'm lying. I'm in line at Starbucks when he called me and then I had to go to a recording session all day.

Speaker 2:          00:19:22       And then I was like, I can meet you after I'm done with this session at night. And then he was like, okay. And like, you know what I mean? How bad did you need that Mars Volta Gig at that point, your career? Was that something that was huge? Yeah, it really put me on the map. I mean, because of the lineage of dudes that were in that band and how like the reputation that band has. Um, I mean I had done things before that, but nothing of that level, you know, so, um, it was huge. So I had about two weeks, you know, to learn the music and it was a two and a half hour set. Uh, you know? Yeah. And what did you do? Shut it out. Yeah, I charted everything out. Um, how long does it take you to and when, when like how true to the original, like John Theater was shit.

Speaker 2:          00:20:04       Well, yeah. Well I'd love, I'd love John's playing. I think he's amazing and I think his parts are incredible. I think that first record is really a masterpiece. So I wanted to do everything that I could in the time that I had to play everything. Note for note. Cause I think that's really important with that. It's like, it's like what situation we're talking about earlier. Like people go to see those songs off that first record and they want it exactly right. Like I would want to see that. So I went out of my way to get everything totally note for note, which, you know, it was easier and more difficult in some certain circumstances. But, um, there were other, you know, other songs where it wasn't really important as much. Um, so two and a half weeks to get it together and, and, and like how often were you jamming with the band?

Speaker 2:          00:20:46       I didn't meet the band until I got to Amsterdam and then we, I mean me and Omar, the guitar player and won like got the three of us jammed a little bit. Uh, I went down to Mexico and the three of us played through the arrangements and it was like, he was like, yeah, this is one. I was like, this is fine. Like, you're fine. But then I went to Amsterdam. How much of a relief was it to hear that? Well, we rehearsed everything without vocals, which is difficult because I used vocals to like sort of know where I am in the song a lot.

Speaker 1:          00:21:13       Oh yeah, I've made that mistake, I've done that. So he was like, dude,

Speaker 2:          00:21:20       you know, you don't even need to be here. This is fine. It's all good. And I was like, okay, great, but you're still like freaking out, you know. So, uh, I get to Amsterdam, meet the rest of the band, then we run through the set. And this is kind of funny cause I, I wrote out all my charts and I put an extra floor, Tom on my left and like a crash cymbal on my left, the left of the high hat. And I just put my charts on the floor, Tom, like hoping like no one would see, you know. Right. And I get up halfway through and to go to the bathroom and I came back, it was all gone. Oh, somebody took it. Yeah. And I like look over it one and he's like, dude, you don't need that shit. You're good. And I was like, okay. And then everything was fine.

Speaker 1:          00:21:56       We ran through the rent or the two and a half hours because there's a lot of visual cues I was going to sink. But if, if they liked that, yeah. If, if they, if you went there and they weren't during the first rehearsal wanting it, note for note, that must have been something a little bit easier where it's like, okay, these guys aren't going to be like Nazis about this and this, this going to be room for me to kind of,

Speaker 2:          00:22:16       yeah. Pull based on the situation based on sort of where they were coming, the situation they were coming out of there were so like exhausted. Um, so there were just like, you know, this is, this sounds like they were basically like, we sound like a band again and it sounds like a record. Oh, cool. Which is great because I was did that first gig. Yeah. What was, uh, that was, um, it was in Oslo. Um, I love that. Then those people, a great comedy fence. Oh my God. I, some of my fucking lunatic, some of my all time best friends are from, are from Oslo. So many of them. Uh, and so many amazing musicians from there. It's insane. My first

Speaker 1:          00:22:55       really good show I ever had in Europe was in Oslow. Really? I don't know if it was them or I just found it was just like, just cause I was too much in my head. [inaudible] and other places like I'm in a different country. Are they going to get this right? I'm talking about shirts. Do they have shirts yesterday dude, they are wearing shirts. Oh Shit, my timing is completely up. And I was so fucking fed up with mediocre sets. I think that when I was in Oslo I just didn't give a fuck. And then they were also like picked up on it. No, they were kind of maniacs where they would like drinking and shit. It's just like, ah, these are the kinds of people I hang out with. Right. And then just Kinda, I felt comfortable and uh, and then the rest of the tour.

Speaker 1:          00:23:34       And then I wanted to Stockholm and all that and it just, everything else I've just sort of fell into place and saying, oh just act like you're here, which I've got here in Oslo. No, no, no. Act like I'm in America. Oh Oh, oh Gotcha. Cause then even if they don't get it, you get to play the arrogant American of like, oh you should know everything about my country and I should know nothing about chores. And they almost want you to say that cause you, you feed into their stereotype of like, yes they are self-involved conch and we're better than they are and they love it. Um, I jumped around a lot.

Speaker 2:          00:24:05       No, that's okay. I get it. It's not like I've never listened to this before. Yeah. It's a shit show. So yeah. So that first show, yeah man, I was insanely nervous. Um, but it went fine. And then as soon as I was like halfway through the show, I remember I was like, yeah, I'm feeling good luck. I'm going to try and like put on a little bit of a show here. Like visually. Right. Cause that's always very important to me. Like there's nothing more boring than seeing someone just up there just like looking like they're doing their taxes.

Speaker 1:          00:24:34       That's me. That's how I look. Not Anymore. A little bit better, but holy Shit. Oh we got to talk about videotaping yourself. Well, playing drums, which you made me do and Oh my God. Yeah. My self esteem has never been lower. I've never looked worse doing anything ever. Even my early standup tapes, which I have on Vhs, which I can't even watch. I don't look as bad. Yeah. Cause you

Speaker 2:          00:24:59       word slouching. You know like, but you won't. So you don't slide this, you know, you don't slouch when you, when you walk around and when you, when you do stand up, it's when you sit down.

Speaker 1:          00:25:09       No, but actually, you know something, my posture is, my posture I've learned from my shoulder being fucked up is all my weight is on my knees. And I've noticed a lot of people do this. When they stand up, they actually their, their um, their hips are forward and you're sort of leaning back like standing like this and what you're actually supposed to do. You like to stand up totally straight like this. Okay. I feel like I'm puffing my chest out. Acting like you like you want to fucking fight. Yes. Uh, especially coming from where I grew up in such an angry crazy state isn't outside of Boston. Forget about Boston itself. I was in the suburbs and that shit was fucking nuts. Stand up straight and then your knees are just slightly bent and your arms had just hanging down and your shoulders are a little, you know, I feel like their back but they're not, that just lines up. Exactly. This is what I have to like learn how to do.

Speaker 2:          00:26:02       But this is exactly what I've said to you and what I say to everyone, especially all these big, big name working pros is it's like if you're slouching, that's your sort of normal goto setting and you think that that's you sitting up straight. Right. So that when you sit up straight or stand up straight, it feels like you're puffing your chest out. Cause that's that cognitive disconnect. So he has to rewire everything. So it's much more accurate. So that's, that's the thing, when I work on all this technique, body mechanics stuff with people, like that's why I tell them to videotape themselves because you can't tell what you actually look like. It's brutal. It's brutal for everyone. It's brutal for everyone, including me. It's never, it never gets easier. So when I started to talk about it, yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:26:46       So when you were, you started playing drums and everything, I imagine you just sat down and grabbed the sticks the way any other kid would have. Like when did you start to break down what you were doing? Did you get hurt or did you just see a video of some guy where he made it look effortless?

Speaker 2:          00:27:02       Good question. Uh, I think when I started getting really serious when I was like 14 or 15, it was a matter of me just constantly going, how lazy can I possibly be? Like, how can I play all the stuff I want to play and just be as like, how, like how much, how can I continually just make this easier on myself? Like, why would I do this if I could just do that instead? Why do you think he thought that? I don't know. Maybe I'm just lazy. No, I was going to say that, but you're not, you're, you're a driven guy. Sure. I think I've just became obsessed with like efficiency. Um, not like for the sake of it in and of itself, but to be like, I can play in more or say more or do more, the more efficient I am, there's more I can do.

Speaker 2:          00:27:50       It's more, I can say the more it can emote that way. Maybe it comes from, you know, my dad collects cars. Maybe it comes from growing up in that culture of like talking about, you know, how, you know, a difference between like a Hemi and a wedge. Right. You know, like the different having dual sparkplugs versus single, like, I don't know. I mean maybe it all sort of mashed up together. Um, I think it just, I w you know, if I wanted to play everything and I realized from a young age probably subconsciously like I need to be as efficient as possible so I'm not getting in my own way so I can play this stuff. I want to play. You know, it's like the first time you heard becoming, you know that Penn terra song, first time I heard it I had to put it on a cassette tape and put it in a handheld recorder and slow the speed down. Right. I remember standing in my mom's kitchen putting it up to my pump up to my ear, slowing the speed down, going what the fuck is going on right now? Like having no clue how he could possibly do that physically and then just sitting there and breaking it down and going, well that wouldn't work. I still feel that way about a lot of this stuff. Which by the way,

Speaker 1:          00:28:54       way man, you got to give a shout out to Vinny. Good Lord Man. That I was literally talking about it texting with you.

Speaker 2:          00:29:00       Yup. Cause talking on the phone.

Speaker 1:          00:29:03       Yeah. And I was just going like, why is this guy so fucking good in, in like two hours later you sent me the texts that he had

Speaker 2:          00:29:08       passed away. Man, it's fucking brutal. I know, man. I was really, I haven't been that bummed out or I haven't been like affected that much by someone's death. Like who? I, I hadn't really know him. I met him once, you know, but I mean he was a real hero of mine and, and to a lot of people, uh, and he just had such a commitment to an a very specific aesthetic. Like he's like, this is the sound, this is the feel, this is the vibe. And like I'm 100% committed. Like,

Speaker 1:          00:29:39       and the fact that they were doing, when all the shit that I was talking about that I was listening to that's just face planted and then all this grunge came out and they were just like, Nah, we're going to keep doing this.

Speaker 2:          00:29:51       That's a great southern train kill. That's the records of bow. As them being like, fuck all these trends. Like fuck this crunch shit. Like we're going to stay true to our metal roots and just keep doing this, you know, and like all that on that live record, that live hundred and one proof record like I love that dude. Fill in some holes in between Song Banter is incredible.

Speaker 1:          00:30:12       There's your for all your spoken pretty blown after show recording for control. Normal Ward Faulconer Obama nerve ball shoot. I always love it. That's pretty before can log in American Harget Larry to strop from Auschwitz. It's just like all this shit that you, if you set it now you'd be my favorite thing and I always talk about on this is when he, when when Vinny counts off broken. It's like in the middle of Phil talking like why are strong or knowledge called on broker and I'm a look in the excess. Yeah. The I'm having a good job. That time is already playing and it was just like, did they do that? Cause that was fucking cool. Always Vinnie. Like Oh God, shut up. I want to drink. I think it was part of it.

Speaker 2:          00:30:58       Yeah. I think he was probably just like, fucking here we go. You know, like, I love that. That's such a great moment in that record because you can tell they're just fucking having fun dude. And that's why that shit, that's part of the reason why that shit

Speaker 1:          00:31:09       feels like never went to go see them because I heard the music and I had an idea in my head what the crowd was going to be like. I'm going to get the shit kicked out of me at this thing.

Speaker 2:          00:31:19       But that's one of the funny things. I was just talking to a buddy of mine, Jamie, who I've been giving Skype lessons to in London. It's an every week for years. And he was telling me he went to see the Bronx the other recently, it's like, you know, pretty heavy like punk rock band. And he said like, he brought his wife and she was like, they left. They had a great time at the show and like everyone, you know, someone falls down in the pit, someone picks him up. Like everyone's looking out for each other. And he said like, they left the show and his wife was like, or he said, I forget. They were like, we felt more unsafe walking the streets.

Speaker 1:          00:31:55       Then you did it at the show, like with all these dudes beating the shit out of each other. Yeah. It just sounded like when I listened to their music, this a bunch of guys that were mad at their dad, we're going to show up and then they were going to take the childhood out on me. I just, you know, and I had fucking orange hair and it was just like, I just didn't think it was going to end well. So it's just like, but that is one of my big regrets that I didn't, there was a number of those bands that I didn't go out and go see because I was just like, dude, I love this music, but I'm going to go, I'm going to get the fucking shit kicked out of me. And you know, I was also in my fucking, my stupid single Bass Drum Barnum d dope pedal.

Speaker 1:          00:32:29       The music didn't require it, Bill, I don't care. He could do more with one foot. Did this guy just saying all this shit that other people and just completely ignoring the, this entirely new, uh, type of drumming and in all of these pioneers who were just, it was like, there was no roadmap on what to do when I was listening to all these other fucking guys who were just saying shit that had already been said. And like, and if basically if you could have a foot is fastest bottom right, then you were bought them. Something like that mean it this way. My head was,

Speaker 2:          00:33:01       this is what I love doing when we're doing lessons together and just shooting the shit or whatever is, is, is that massive amount of carry over between drumming and standup comedy. I mean, it's huge. And that's what's so fun about it. Difference.

Speaker 1:          00:33:16       It's the exact same fucking thing of like, you know, uh, the difference between a guy who change comedy versus a guy who's just sort of, you know, doing comedy or if you're on stage, like just reciting your act versus being up there and having an idea and the crowd reacts one way, which actually affects how the show goes. And everything. And um, I used to be so envious of musicians that could just sit down and play what they could feel or react to what another musician did. And I just did not have that ability. So when I got into stand up, I remember like stand up. I had the same feeling you had like when you got down, when you sat it at a kid. When I first time I remember when I went to a, it was my second show is at this place stitches comedy club, which no longer exists.

Speaker 1:          00:34:10       And um, I went in there for this open mic and I remember just walking into all of these open makers up at the bar, all in different levels. And I just remembered feeling like, like, like for the first time, like I was with a demographic of people that like, I, I didn't know, I was just like, yeah, these guys are the same kind of fucking weird that I am, this, these Weirdos feel normal to me. And it was the first time when I went to stand up, you know, even though I obviously had to learn from all these people, there was, I, I had like this feeling of, I know I don't really know exactly where I'm going, but I kind of know where I'm going. Like I know that I, I just have to do this a bunch of times and what I feel in me is t his is like that this is the right thing is going to kind of come out.

Speaker 1:          00:34:56       And uh, so when I am in the, I'm trying to think, one of the first guys I ever saw, just a winger set. I saw this Guy Frank Santa Rally and he went up there and knowing what I know now about comedy, I think it was because the host brought them up and they were playing this weird music and she started doing this dump dance and he did it with her and he had this totally serious look on his face. He was already killing before we even took the mic and the mic stand. But I think that little improv exercise opened him up and he just went up there and it was like he was just fucking talking and I'd seen his act a bunch of times and a then I remember thinking like, oh he should be, should do that again. He should do like everything was so precious. She got to hang on to every Friday thing you ever said. And it wasn't like listen to the musicians were the, that whole those types of bands where it's just like, yeah, just how the song came out that night. That was the mood we were in. And I remember trying like I tried to apply that.

Speaker 2:          00:35:56       Yeah. Cause it's the exact same thing I have people say it's still hard at what you do cause you wake up when you're a baby mama. Dot. Dot. You were already playing. You're already talking. I'm just talking into a microphone. I have to learn how to speak. Yeah, but use through sounds. Yeah, but putting an instrument but you being able to stand up and wing a set. You have to be just funny. Inherently funny. Obviously it takes work, but you have to be a funny person to be able to do that as opposed to someone who has, all you do is when it, if it doesn't work, you just make fun of yourself. It's the, it's the, it's like literally, you know, if he can't dance, you just learn a little two step and let the woman do all the fucking work and sane, it's over.

Speaker 2:          00:36:33       It's the same fucking thing. But go up there, you wing an idea. If it doesn't either just make fun of yourself or you blame the crowd. Yeah. But that's like he's saying like, Oh yeah, when I go to do a drum solo, it's like, yeah, just kind of played the Tom's a little bit and then the symbol. No, it isn't. That's what I'm saying. It isn't. Yeah. So I'm saying the same thing to you. It's not, it's not that easy. Like, I mean, but that, that, you know, I have, uh, you know, to, to I teach who are like mainly Torin guys put with like pop acts or whatever. They're like, I can sit down and play the shit out of a show, like from start to finish nail everything. But if I sit down and someone's like, Hey, play a little bit like I don't know what the fuck to do. Like I can't just play by myself and that's the same also type of a thing. Someone has a routine or bits of show put together, they could kill it but then if they just walk up and talk to somebody heckles him and fucks up there. Yeah, I guess that's the exactly the same in music and comedy. Someone throws a fucking beer bottle at you or whatever.

Speaker 1:          00:37:27       Yeah. People throw shit at you guys. That does not happen. I mean I've had shit thrown at me but like usually to serve this you guys would just be up there singing and for some reason somebody just wants to throw a bottle. I don't know why. In a lot of times it's like the band is like the crowd is enjoying the show. It's like they just want to connect with you less. I hit him with the bottle, like the plastic water bottle I was drinking at my fingerprints are on it and it touched him. So, and then he yelled at me. It was epic. People are crazy. What, um, what's the most fucked up thing you ever saw in a show? Cause you're the drummer, you get to see that he'd be, he sad, your lead singer go to crowd surf and just sort of disappear in the crowd and the people can't find them and you guys are looking at each other like, how are we going to end this song?

Speaker 2:          00:38:12       You know, one of the most brutal things I ever saw, it was, I wasn't involved. I was just a spectator. But um, I was seeing, I think it was with some, it was some Mike Patton band who's he look Melvin's or Fanta Moss or he's in that dead crust now, right? Yeah. I got to see them in Bartow. Yeah. Yeah. Um, I can't remember who it was. Um, anyway, they brought up like a jelaby off road to like sing a song and he went to go like, this is maybe five, 10 years ago. And he went to go like state like stage dive or whatever. And it's the first step he took. He said that on some girl's face. Oh No. Then just ate shit like, like family guy fall, how it's like one frame and then your arms are behind your back. Oh Shit. And it was just like, took him like 10 minutes to get back on stage and it was just like, oh, what is the band doing where they just blank kept playing and you know, it was just like, oh God.

Speaker 2:          00:39:12       Brutal. So what do you do? Does the guitar player play a Solo? Like how do you eat? I mean, I think they just kept, you know, patent was up there. I think they just kept like going, you know, and he eventually made his way back on stage or whatever, but it was just like, boom. It was like, whoa. Oh yeah. Um, I mean, maybe you like for me playing, there's a drum cam video on, on, on Youtube. I think it's the first thing you saw of me. The, the volt, the Goliath. Oh yeah. And I didn't understand your technique. I'm like, this guy's fucking arms are going to fall off. Yeah, yeah. Cause I was going ape shit and go nuts and hitting super hard and um, or it looks like it's hitting hard. Um, and one thing Cedric he used to love to do is he would just like take my crash cymbals away from me.

Speaker 2:          00:39:56       Like, so there's a part in that video where he just takes my crash, uh, and I only have two. So he takes my crash and then like, you know, like basically just jumps on it, uh, and like throws it up and down and then takes the symbol often stomps on it, and then takes the cymbal stand and throws it over my head and almost hit it, takes out the camera. And I'm like, this is the, this was the first time he'd ever done this. So like, did you know that he did shit? Like, no, no, I mean, not really. I don't think so. Did you think it was because of your playing? No, he was just like rock and rock and roll, you know, like my fucking self esteem. It'd be like, he hates me, I'm getting fired and then it'd be getting mad at me like, dude, a fucking trash my shit.

Speaker 2:          00:40:37       Well, I did get mad eventually. Um, uh, and my company was like, what the fuck? Um, but anyway, yeah, cause he had to keep sending you shit. Yeah. They were like, Shit, what the fuck? We send you symbols to play knock to get broken by the lead singer, you know? So, uh, so yeah, this is the first time he ever did it. So you can see me like turning around to my tech, like, hey fucking give me another symbol and a stand, like, come on dude. Like, and a, and he's like, hold on a sec. You know, and then, uh, and then he was just like, I got to make sure and wait until he's actually done. I don't know how far he's going to take this. Oh yeah, yeah, no, they wait until he's out of that mood. Yeah. And then he eventually, you know, eventually brought another one up and it was fine.

Speaker 2:          00:41:14       But like, uh, well not to get into the gossip, we, you able to just kind of sit there and say, hey buddy, I love being in the band man, but I need my sympathy. I mean, it was, I got to a certain point where I was like, dude, like really? You know, like, come on, cause he actually plays drums too. I was like, you know, you know how much, you know, annoying that that would be right. You know, he's like, Oh shit. Yeah, you're right. Sorry man. Let's get carried away. You know, I used to, when I was five, eight, if I ever saw that on TV or if I was in the crowd or whatever, when I was a kid and I was playing drums and everything, I used to just be a tech to just give it to me. Right, right. I need a simple, totally need to sit there and just break it in front of me. It's just like I would have loved to have had that. Yup.

Speaker 1:          00:41:51       Like when I ever watched like the WHO or whatever. Yeah. And you know, it's funny cause I don't know if they just had like some piece of shit, you know, the Japanese version of the lesser or whatever. Or if it was an actual one eat now, like all those vintage instruments, how much they're worth. Like I Pete towns in his probably, you know, no, my God, probably seven figures and guitars.

Speaker 2:          00:42:12       Oh, at least. Yeah. Yeah. My Buddy, my buddy Jerry plays with Dick Dale, you know, and uh, he brings out this like, I don't know what it is if it's like an explorer or a Les Paul or something, but it's like from the 50s and his amp has also from the 50s and it's like that shit's worth several hundred thousand dollars and he tours with it. It's crazy.

Speaker 1:          00:42:34       Well, yeah. And, and he's the guy who did, who's to plays or frock, but he plays like, Oh, right handed guitar, lefty upside down. It doesn't change the strings.

Speaker 2:          00:42:42       That sounds right to me. Yeah. He does something super fucked up and weird. Yeah. That's all that, that pulp fiction song. Yup. That's it. Yeah. Okay. Well where can people get this video? They can go to my website, [inaudible] dot com spell your name. We're dumb dumb over here. L I, T, c h, Dave [inaudible] dot com. And you can just click on instructional course. It'll pop up there and you can get everything there. It's just streaming and uh, you know, everybody does these sort of subscription based courses now and then they just take your money forever. Then I didn't want to do that, so I'm like, you know, you just pay for it once you stream it forever, as long as you want. I'm not going to charge your credit card for seven years and you know, like I don't want to do that. So, uh, I've had a couple of those and then you forget you have exactly. Somebody is looking at your stuff going like, dude, what the fuck is this dude? I haven't tell you. I had, I had a cell phone number for like 15 years.

Speaker 1:          00:43:32       Never used. Are you serious? Yeah. Like, I was bitching to my wife going like, uh, is that mine? Oh, Siri, you know, worse. Um, I was paying, just seemed like a ton of money. All of a sudden for my cell phone. It just kept going up and up and up. I said, I don't understand why I'm paying. Why am I paying so much more than fuck? It was going up to like fucking three, 400 bucks. Right. So she goes, let me see it. And she looked at it. She goes, all right, first of all, I think I had three cell phone numbers. Why? Yeah, she's looking at me. Yeah. Like, like I got like fucking chicks on the side and I'm like, no, I don't know. We looked at up, all right, here's what it was back in the day. Um, when you were on the road, you know, you'd bring you your fucking big thick laptop or whatever.

Speaker 1:          00:44:18       And all these hotel rooms were charging anywhere from seven, 10, $11 a day for the Internet. So I went and I was working places Tuesday through Sunday, so it was like six times, you know, 10, 11 bucks. It was like, man with the tax has cost me like $70 to be on the Internet. So, uh, my buddy Robert Kelly, right? He's like, dude, you want to do a Gig? He knows all the fucking technology goes. Did you get the fucking, it's, this was his hotspot thing. So it had its own number. You plugged it in to your computer and blah, blah blah. Right. So I tried to use it twice and it never worked. Now says he's fucking digs, never fucking work. And I knew in the back of my head it's like I gotta call these guys up and cancel it or whatever. And I just, I just never did.

Speaker 1:          00:45:05       And I just forgot about it. Oh, recently I actually founded, I still have the thing. So that was one of them. I forget what the other one was, but it was like two things that were of that. One was like a fax machine number and the other one's like, like all this outdated shit. So she got, she got that taken off. And then I think one time when I left the country I switched my plan and they didn't quite switch it back or something. So now, now it's down to like a buck 80 a month. It was your, was your mobile hotspot like the size of this fridge? No, you know, it was the size of a hockey puck. I mean it was big, was a big plastic thing and you just had a, and you had to come up with a, all this stuff that trips me up, you know, you got to come up with a password and just like, oh, just a couple, two, three of those hoops that I have to jump through.

Speaker 1:          00:45:48       But yeah, that's too much. But I've been working on lately though. Um, I remember seeing, maybe I was watching one of the interviews you did or whatever you said, how you think everyone should have a therapist if you just talk to somebody, the world be a better place. Well, um, I haven't gone to therapy and like I finally, at one point I was just going like, dude, I'm always going to be fucked up. I mean, I can sit here like, well, I'm done talking about my childhood, so I'm just going to be talking about the dumb shit that happens every day. I'm like, it was, it was Phil started feeling a reality show, but one on one reality show. But, um, recently I've been really been working on my not snapping over little things. Uh, and I, I started to snap this morning for the first time in like four days and it actually felt a little weird, but, um, I want, I'm just gonna keep trying to do what I'm doing with it and I keep talking about it and loud, so I remember it because, you know, it's like, Hey, I'm going to go to the gym, you know, and then that week you fucking crush it.

Speaker 1:          00:46:43       Next week you three quarters, he crushed it. By a month later you've eating Oreos. Sit on a couch. So what do you, so what are you doing? Like you just like breathe deeply years. Like when you say Aye, well, big thing is driving. Sure. So when I get in the fucking car, I just say like, uh, first of all, I leave enough fucking time to get there. I don't leave the utopia time. This should take a half hour. Nope. How dare these other people in front of me have other plans in other lives. So I leave plenty of time and then I, it's just weird. I drive slow, slow early. I'm probably driving somebody nuts behind me. I drive slower. I stop at yellow lights. I let people go. I, I chill out. I actually, uh, is another thing. I swear to God, this is like, they use this for premature ejaculation.

Speaker 1:          00:47:31       I'm actually using this. I've listened to baseball. He's day think I'll think about baseball. I never understood that be, if you don't want to fucking bus the nut. I started thinking a fucking Carl Yastrzemski now fucking get a hard dick thinking about the fucking left field or the red sox. And it's just confusing. It's like, wait, am I attracted to this guy? Um, I just didn't feel like you were present. Uh, sorry, I was busy. I was thinking about fucking a Jerry Remy. No, I put on like, there's something about smoking a cigar and listening, listening to baseball on a radio. It's like some old man shit and it's slows life down. I don't know what it is. So I uh, I just have it on and they just have a wonderful day for a ball game, man. It's just crazy. The lineups, blah blah blah blah blah.

Speaker 1:          00:48:21       You know, he's just extending is bratty of Aa and you just sort of drift along. And I just, and I just know and I just, I don't have a hate saying this, but you know that people always say like, you know, you got to give up like expectations and shit. First of all, I also like googled how to stop snapping over little things in the first thing I clicked on was this woman going, did you ever hand is you have a blunt in to say everything that I've done? Like yes, yes, yes, yes, yes. So she goes, here's four techniques and I'm reading this shit and I am like five minutes into reading this and before she says, you know, I've been doing this for like a week and I'm like, what? Literally started snapping.

Speaker 1:          00:49:04       Like you don't change in a week. Okay, this is, this is going to take me. I just turned 50 this will take, if I work my ass off, this will take all of my fifties to not to not do that. That's why I was joking with a buddy of mine, why one of the most realest characters ever in any movie was was private hawks in police academy. Remember she was always held mousy. That black girl hang and then the end she'd be like, no. And I remember joking, you know every movie she'd go back to being mousy again. She had the exact same character arc and it's just like when does she, you know, in reality is is that's what it's like to try to change yourself as a person, as you have, you know, fucking up, fuck it up it up for 90 minutes and then whatever or whatever.

Speaker 1:          00:49:52       How much time the move goes by in the movie and then you had that breakthrough moment and you don't move dirt bag and then the next day you know you're going to fall back again or maybe two days later or whatever. So yeah, but that's, that's the, but when you, you know, if you continued to do that work on yourself where you fall back isn't as far down the ladder as you were before. You know what I'm saying? Yeah, no, no, I, yeah, believe me dude, like I'm, I am committed to this because it's going to make my relationship with my wife so much better. I'm telling you, dude, if I could just stop snapping at little shit, dude, she's got nothing. He's got a real motivation. She's got nothing. No, because what I'm still doing, this is something else that I'm going to, I'm starting to let go of is the way when you were in a relationship with a woman, like thinking the way a guy thinks you think I'm going to do this and then it's to then it's den. She's going to be happy with me and she'll be in a good mood and then I'll, the egg shells go away. Right. And what you realize is that, that that's yeah, you're chasing a a, that it's like a Ponzi scheme. Like there's, there's no meaning having expectations for your actions is, ah, no, I just like,

Speaker 3:          00:51:09       okay,

Speaker 1:          00:51:10       I'm just always going to win. Neuer inherently just because I'm a man and I'm not going to see things the way she does because she's a woman and touching that and what, what she views as important versus what I view as, or she views is not a big deal. And I think is a big deal is not going to Mesh. Not because she's a bad person or I'm a bad person, it's just because we are wired differently. And uh, so I forget something happened just this morning and I started to get upset and I was just like, well, why would I think that she would blah, blah, blah. And it just fucking went away. That's great. So I kicked, but I'm afraid of this because now I'm filling in which to become this spineless guy or hell, you know, sitting there holding her purse.

Speaker 2:          00:51:56       You know what I talk about the same shit I have with my, with my therapist a bunch of times. Uh, because coming with not even necessarily talking about that specific thing as a human being, but talking about that specific thing as being the source of your creativity in some way. Yeah. You know what I mean? Like

Speaker 1:          00:52:15       now there's, there, there is a thing with comedians. What's a, if I get happy, I won't be fun anymore. Which is what musicians too. It's a huge myth because I'll tell you why. What happens is, is like once you get everything you want, you know, as far as like, you found love and you have the kid and your kid comes home is going. Dot, dot, dot, dot. Big Smile students. The fucking greatest, greatest fucking thing ever. It's one of the few things in the world that lives up to the hype, right? Other than downloading your fucking video, boom, Bam. Cross promoting. Um, what uh, what replaces all your angsty Lolita is sort of sleeping on a futon and shit. Is this new fear of that you're now going to lose it all? Like what if something happens? Like I can't tell you since having a kid, like any new scenario like, hey, I'm going to go take her on the swing.

Speaker 1:          00:53:04       Like immediately this horror movie that Steven King could not fuck with. Oh, maybe that maybe he has kids or something. That's how he writes. But like the shit that goes through your head about the possible stuff that would happen. And always in the end I'm either murdering a person or an animal, one or the other. Dude, I've actually had fantasies of jumping down on a cougars back in somehow I know that UFC move where your choke it out and I wrapped my legs around its belly so it can't claw me. And I sit there while I'm eating a sandwich thinking of all of this because my wife said that she's going to like just take her out in the backyard, um, turns into a Joe Rogan episode. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:53:49       Yeah. So all of that. And then like those fucking crazy thoughts, we'll then we'll then fuel your, um, your act hopefully. So. Um, and he goes, well, I have to, I got to read a little bit of advertising. Okay, you want to see some comedy here? Um, once again, my apologies to the Special Smith. I feel so fucking bad about that. And I told, I told the singer I'd throw a couple of concent form and then I called his pant, the smiths, and then I had all these fucking mopey Morrissey people. He left at Penn 30 years ago. Man, they're never getting backed in other people freaking out. Did they get back together? Like I caused like this whole fucking thing. I feel like such a f

Speaker 2:          00:54:29       by the way. You're, you're, you need to film like a video of your Morrissey dance.

Speaker 1:          00:54:34       Oh, the Morrissey dance. Oh yeah. Have you done that yet? No, I got to get it down better. It's one of my favorite things I've ever seen. I don't dislike more soon. I just made, I like irritating people that are really into shit. Like star wars fans. Oh, I saw them. I saw one, I saw one of the newer, newer star wars ones. It was fucking great. It was actually really good. Now that it's not like a muppet movie. There was two, like it was like, it was like muppets with space and then some bad self help. You know, this guy's good. He's in the league, his light sabers, blue

Speaker 2:          00:55:06       dude. I think star wars is great, but when people like make their lives revolve around it, I just, it's like there's so much other shit out there in the world.

Speaker 1:          00:55:15       That's why people don't like baby boomers because baby boomers, like they just make so much about what they grew up in and fucking all the stuff they did. If they just fucking just did what they did and just shut the fuck up about it and let them other generations realize how cool they were, they would have been fine. Um, all right.

That wasn't that bad. And before it was bad, it was definitely a dude. That video where you were at Dean's birthday was fucking crushing. Uh, oh my God. Dude, that was so much fun. Yeah. Yeah. The fuck out of everything. That's what it's all about, man. You know. Oh yeah, that was, yeah. I gotta be honest with you. Like those, those fucking, all of those things. When Krishna hooked me up and I got the jams. Yeah. A couple of those guys know those rice stuff and slap, I mean, just like, um, those things are the biggest of anything I've ever done in this business. Um, those are the biggest, those have been the play with fucking Nikki Sixx.

That's what I, cause I always feel like with stand up as much as, you know, doing Letterman, the HBO special dudes like that, it's like I did the hell gigs. Like I fucking earned it. And the cracker barrel at three in the morning and Nebraska or whatever. But there's these drum and gigs. It's not like I had to audition. It's just like, oh, that guy's funny.

Speaker 3:          01:05:08       Okay. [inaudible] what's going on? It's Gilbert,

Speaker 4:          01:05:48       the Monday morning podcast from Monday, June 28th, 2010 right off the bat. You should be thinking, you know what, Bill, there's something weird with your voice. Why does it sound like you're whispering? Because I am fucking whispering. You're fucking Douche bag. Why don't you go with your gut? You know, didn't you fucking brain just tell you that I was whispering? Did your parents beat you down mentally that bad? That you literally question what that fucking voice in in Saudi was even saying. That's the voice. It makes you fucking when you go on a hike and if that little voice in he has gone. Is there a mountain lion staring at me? Yes, there is run. All right. Um, I'm whispering because I'm doing this fucking thing at eight 20 in the morning, my girlfriend is sleeping in the other room. I take this fucking thing last night, but for some reason I screwed up.

Speaker 3:          01:06:50       Okay.

Speaker 4:          01:06:50       And it didn't record 50 minutes. I fucking did it and I was going to upload it at midnight, just like last week. Okay. And just like last week, I am once again Douche bag of the week back to back, just like the Lakers and my douchebag. Two years in a fucking row, uh, two weeks in a row, I should say her two times in a row, whatever. You know the analogy I'm trying to let you guys know that I'm a fucking idiot when it comes to this, the past two weeks and kind of try and trash the Lakers anyways, but they don't give a fuck. They got their rings right. You know what a wonderful organization, they actually had to switch their parade route because they're stupid fans were riding so much bunch of fucking animals. Eric, Billy, ever going to let the Lakers Celtics series go? You know what? I don't think I'm gonna. I'm reminded of it constantly. Like I started watching World Cup soccer and watching all those fucking people flopping around on the ground. Anytime anybody kicked it back of their socks reminded me of watching Pau Gasol play basketball, the fucking flopping. Fag. All right, let's not be this angry. You can't be angry in whisper.

Speaker 4:          01:08:06       Ever seen that? You've see a couple fight in public. They do that angry whispering. That's not what he said. You know, Goddamn well what the fuck's on right here? No kill. Shut the fuck up. That's what I'm going to be doing. So anyways, um, I actually did the podcast last night already and uh, fighting through, I was like sweating. I was so god damn sick. I did Vegas this weekend. I performed at the Orleans casino. Now few standup nerds out there or fee fans of the podcast who listen every week you read, you know that the Orleans casino was the last place. George Carlin did a stand up before he died. So, uh, I went there and I asked them a ton of questions. People who work there with totally cool. Even one of the guys was actually telling me how Carlin put together as hours of material. You know, how he would come in and it would be like an hour and 20 minutes and before a special huge, he'd watch them whittle it down and by the end of the weekend it would be the AEC an hour right on the nose.

Speaker 4:          01:09:14       Gave me chills listening to it and also made me really feel like, uh, I need to start working harder as a fucking comedian. And, uh, someone, they're also gave me a, a ticket stub from his last show was fucking awesome, but I made the mistake. I, um, the Orleans Orleans casino is actually off the strip. It's kind of cool. So my hotel room at a view of the entire Strip and, uh, I would have been content to just stay out there at the Orleans casino cause I liked it. I liked the vibe. The crowd was a little bit older as am I, you know, so there wasn't a lot of craziness going on. It was just straight up, let's booze, let's eat, let's gamble. You know, I wasn't a bunch of people fucking, you know, in Alec, a Gaggle, a chick screaming out the sunroof of a fucking limb out.

Speaker 4:          01:10:10       You know, we got a lemma beaches in Al, you know, everybody tags everything with bitch nowadays. Is that from the Rick James Sketch? I'm Rick James Bitch. Then everything became bitch, whatever long fucking story. You know what I'm doing right now, I'm looking at my laptop and the screen saver just has all, all the albums on my iTunes or all the albums that don't really fucking exist. The covers to the digital singles that I downloaded. I'm actually looking at one that says Elvis speaking of Las Vegas. And I came out to uh, to LVC entire weekend. I had to do it. I came out to that song that's used to be cute and now I realize that it's about stocking someone you know, has a fucking song go had in the kitchen, had in the hall and gonna do you any good it out? It was one side something man. The kids in start a team allowed Hawes is good and Tamar us apart. It's like really? Elvis does. Does the woman have any say in that?

Speaker 5:          01:11:19       Okay,

Speaker 4:          01:11:19       I'm going to fuck and Zaha I'm Volvo. But Elba. Yeah. Stuck on you. Stuck on you. You would think that, uh, that with them, it's a guy in love. But if you really listen to the lyrics, it isn't, it's a guy who can't accept the fact that the relationship is over and her mind and she wants to move on.

Speaker 5:          01:11:41       Okay.

Speaker 4:          01:11:41       Eh, you know, hey, he just

Speaker 4:          01:11:45       won't fucking leave her alone. It keeps pressing his sweaty out of shape, iconic stomach up against her as he kisses her. I mean, that's what I got out of it, but it was a great sign to come out to nonetheless. So anyways, you probably asking, hey bill, you whisper douche. How did you get sick? I don't really know, but I know who I'm going to blame it on. How about that? I was fucking, uh, like I said, I was content to stay off the Strip at the Orleans casino, you know, but I brought my girlfriend, so you know what that means. They want to do stuff.

Speaker 5:          01:12:27       Yeah,

Speaker 6:          01:12:28       that's counter this strip. I heard they had some stores. They are stewards on the strip. Let's go to the Strip and go to the store and see where to go to the stores and the Strip a sweetie. Sweetie, do you want to go to the stores on this strip? Okay.

Speaker 4:          01:12:43       No, of course. I don't. Why know? Why would I want to do that? If I had something I needed to buy, I would go, but I doubt I don't want to go. Yeah. But I fucking learned. I've learned to get through the fucking relationship. You got to say yes to some shit. You don't want to fucking do.

Speaker 4:          01:13:07       So I go, yeah, yeah. Let's go to the fucking stores on the Strip. Right. So we fucking go out there and uh, you know, we go into all these fucking stores. I noticed those really high end stores. When you go into them, they only have like 40 pieces is they call them. You don't, it's very, it's now like when you go into old navy a, what's waist size area? We got a hundred of that. You know, we get a hundred every fucking size and their stack from the floor up to the goddamn ceiling. And we got that ladder at fucking slides right across the wall. That's how much product we have in here. And that's just the goddamn change. And you know why? Cause they're 30 bucks a whack, but you go into those fucking high end places and it stops being jeans and dresses. It starts being called pieces.

Speaker 5:          01:14:00       Yeah.

Speaker 4:          01:14:01       And all of a sudden there's like 28 things and there's a ton of space and everybody in those stores, it looks like Mike Myers and that fucking sketchy used to do, you know, re danced like the fucking German guy who liked to get shit on sprocket or some shit. And I came out with the fuck name was stressed all in black and he put his hands on his hips and he only moved his legs. Can you guys hear that person? There's somebody giggling like a maniac downstairs. The person moved out downstairs, not the old guy. My apartment's over two different apartments. It's a little fucking spread out. So anyways, we start going to those God damn shops. Long story short, I got to actually admit a Louis Vuitton when you go in there. Uh, I really liked their luggage van. That luggage is fucking insane. Like it's handcrafted. Say No, I lied that, you know, look at that handcrafted. Yeah. Some guy took a hammer and nails on the inside, look at that craftsman ship, you know, and they have an old Louis Vuitton trunk from like the early 19 hundreds and it's still functional. You know, why? Cause it was made by hand using great materials. So I was like, you know what, I liked his shit. I like, it wasn't made by a machine. It was made by a human being. So I asked him the smallest fucking piece of luggage they had, which I guess would be considered kind of like a jewelry box.

Speaker 4:          01:15:32       And I asked him how much it was and they were like $4,000 and a, I did the Eddie Murphy in Beverly Hills Cop, you know, you know, I just totally played it off like I could afford it as that guy has. Great, you know? Okay. Now. Why don't you close up this handcrafted thing and put it back up on the fucking shelf? I was actually pissed afterwards for grant. They fucking look me right in the eye when they said four grand for gray. You look at the fucking floor when you throw a goddamn number up like that should be ashamed of yourself charging that much fucking money. I don't understand. Do you know how fucking rich you'd have to be to buy a $4,000 fucking jewelry box?

Speaker 5:          01:16:18       Okay,

Speaker 4:          01:16:19       Jesus Christ. Most people, their jewelry isn't worth that much and then where the fuck do you take it? That's the thing about buying really nice clothes and really nice stuff. I got my legs crossed right now and I'm swinging my foot around. The fuck is wrong with me. She caught myself on a really a feminist moment, whatever I'm allowed on a um, what? What the fuck are you going to do? Like someone will like, that's when you know you're rich. When summer will mug you not for what's in your luggage, still just mug you for your fucking luggage.

Speaker 4:          01:16:56       You know, when I go to do the David Letterman program, I go always go out and I buy a nice God damn suit. I always lose money whenever I do that show, but I'm not going out there looking like a bum and I love the suits and I wearing them. But the second you put them on your freaking out like Oh my God, ah, anything that you go to brush up against you freak out because it's an expensive God damn suit as opposed to when you shop at old navy in the gap, you know the Anti Pussy where that they sell. I wouldn't give a shit if I was walking through a fucking pig sty. I mean I freak all my God pig shit. Oh God. Okay. I'm wearing gap jeans. I've never wore gap jeans. I would never do that. Do you know there was a kid in my high school, his nickname was the gap nerd and he'd, he, he, he had no idea. People use, no one said to his face because he was a bigger guy, but he always wore a gap jeans and he wasn't even that big of a nerd, but he always talked to shirts in cause it was the 80s and a yeah, they called them the gap nerd and that was the end of his pussy getting career. He had no idea, had no idea

Speaker 4:          01:18:15       she had to deal with his big six foot, four inch fucking red corduroy gap jeans, big stupid tag on the back gap. It's like don't you notice that everybody else's says Levi Strauss. That's what you want to have on. And then the couple of kids whose dads have mafioso connections, there's actually actually have guests jeans, you know, which in my world was chick jeans back then. Um, anyways, I'm getting off the fucking beaten track. So anyways, so we will look, we're going through all these, these high end fucking stores. I went into the Tom Ford store, some of the most beautiful suits have ever seen in my life. Also some of the most expensive, but you get caught up in it. I was actually in there because Tom Ford, his entire line is not just the line, it's like a lifestyle and it's like dead dull [inaudible] beer guy. Stay thirsty. My friends, it's like Steve McQueen man's man. They had a fucking raw, a cigar cutter cutter made out of like a fucking, I was going to say a rhino horn. It wasn't, it was an ox horn and ox horn cigar cutter. One of the most manliest fucking things I've ever seen. And I'm actually thinking about buying it. I'm holding this fucking ox horn.

Speaker 4:          01:19:45       Yeah. Now they had a ram horn cigarette lighter. I'm not even lying. I'm not even joking. I'm actually considering buying this fucking thing. Fortunately I walked out of the store, you know, and by 10 minutes went by and then I just kinda had like that little fucking gut check moment there, whatever. Kind of looking at myself like, dude, did you almost just by a fucking [inaudible] Garth cutter. Did you really? Almost too. Did you, did you get that fucking caught up and that bullshit? It's like, yeah, I did. Couple of things kept snapping me back into reality. Um, I don't like my, I don't like buying shit made out of animals unless it's a leather jacket. It's just a stupid cow ate hamburgers anyways. It'd be fucking hypocritical when it fucking cows already dead. Why don't we go to the native American route and use up this whole fucking cow?

Speaker 5:          01:20:41       Yeah.

Speaker 4:          01:20:42       You know, but I don't eat ox, although I did go to a Mario Batali restaurant one time and I got an oxtail fucking stew or something. I can't even remember what the fell it was, but it was delicious. Um, but anyway, since she's just no fucking need, unless the ox was already dead and you're like, well we might as well sof, it's fucking horns and turned it into a cigar cutter. Anyway, so we get out of that thing and speaking of fucking cows,

Speaker 5:          01:21:11       yeah.

Speaker 4:          01:21:11       So I dunno, my girls like, let's go get something to eat. And I said, all right, there's a fucking Mcdonald's right there. And she's like, do you want to eat there? And Soda was looking down at the ground, all sad, you know, just doing that classic female manipulation thing. She knew I wanted to eat there. I just said there's a Mcdonald's there. And then why would she say, do you want to eat there and look down at the ground? This question is for all the young male listeners. If my whispering podcast, why would a female do that? Do, do, do, do, do. I'll tell you why. Because she doesn't want, if not only does she not want to fucking eat there, she already has a place where she wants to eat. She's our, she's already had this place that she's wanting, wanting to eat it for probably a month before you ever went to Vegas.

Speaker 4:          01:22:07       But she's not going to tell you about it because if she tells you about it, they'd give you time to do research on it and find out how fucking expensive it was. So she's like, do you want to eat? And she looks down at the ground. So immediately, despite the fact that I know all this about females, I take the bait. Why? Where do you want to eat sweetheart? Um, there's this burger place at Mandalay bay. I heard it with Israeli. Nice. Do you ever watch top chef? Uh, only when you're watching it, sweetheart. I don't like that show.

Speaker 4:          01:22:41       Fucking show is annoying. I hate when the shift starts screaming at those people. It's fucking foreign accent. He called dead a fucking grilled cheese sandwich. Get the fucker in my kitchen. Hey. Hey, you think I'm fucking afraid of you? You fucking Dosha. You got a fucking problem with my grilled cheese sandwich. You come up like a fucking gentleman and you take me aside. Don't fucking be screaming at me. Why get these fucking knives in my hand? Stick it right to your goddamn trachea when you think about that. Huh? I'll give you a fucking blow hole right out the front of your fucking neck. Get out of my goddamn face before I take you by your fucking hair and Moshe face into this pile of shrimp. Huh? That I haven't taken the shells off. So I'll give you a bunch of little razor cuts. Sorry. Could you actually smell there's somebody there. You know, I used to work in a restaurant where, uh, I worked the mesquite grill. I worked in a fancy restaurant called the sable cafe and Cary North Carolina, very short lived. It was supposed to be five star dining yet they had me working on a mesquite grill. Glassed in with a big chef hat is all these fucking people will be looking at me,

Speaker 4:          01:23:59       you know, and I had to cook up all this shit and I was done, you know, burgers front bro Sheds to chicken sandwiches, whatever the fuck we will make in the swordfish specials. And then I turned around, there was a little window and I'd hand it to the fucking Metallica fan who I worked with who had a stick his hair up in the hat with his pre pubescent fucking mustache even though he was 19 that was a funny thing about that job is I'd be sitting there looking at all these quote on quote elegant people in Cary, North Carolina and then I'd look through the little port hole where I would stick the food through to give to the fucking drug addicts on the lie. I remember who, they had a guy back there who was on a work release program. Like at night he was in jail, but it during the day he cooked at this fucking restaurant. This guy was a douchebag.

Speaker 5:          01:24:49       Okay.

Speaker 4:          01:24:50       And one time we went, we were on our way to going out of business. So at one time I was literally the grill chef, the busboy and a dishwasher. Let's not even get involved in the amount of fucking health code violations that they're involved in there. Cause I would, I did not have time to wash my fucking hands, put it that way. Um, so one day we were slammed, I'm in back going, hey, we need some more glasses. You know, because we were running low on glasses and the fucking Douche on the work release program goes, well, why don't we wash some Aha, a novel idea, you know, like he's fucking intelligent or something. Ah, a novel idea.

Speaker 4:          01:25:39       It was only because the guy was, was in fucking prison that I didn't say anything to him. He had that sort of credibility. But looking back, he was a fucking pussy. God Damn Little Shit. He wasn't even that tall. And this is back in the day though, when you weren't that tall and if you weren't that tall, you weren't that tough. You were tough for a little guy, but you were still a little guy. This is before Jujitsu had made it to America. There was no UFC, you know, remember the first fucking UFC and hoists, Gracie kept fighting all those big guys and you think that he's about ready to get punched in the chest and the fucking face or whatever. And then all of a sudden he grabbed that little finger and bend it back and whatever the fuck he was, he didn't know what he was doing. It was like magic.

Speaker 5:          01:26:24       Okay.

Speaker 4:          01:26:24       He was like, oh, that little guy's going to get the shit kicked out of him. And the other guy would be like, I ran a a ride or rhetoric. So, um,

Speaker 5:          01:26:33       yeah.

Speaker 4:          01:26:35       Isn't that hilarious? There's nothing worse than taking shit from somebody and you don't give him shit back because you know why? Because 23 fucking later years later, it's still bugs Ya.

Speaker 5:          01:26:45       Okay,

Speaker 4:          01:26:45       you guys hit it. There's a, there's a great one. If you guys want it, you want to, you want to, why the fuck is the word I'm trying to say here? If you want to participate in the podcast, what's the law? I want to find out what the longest like who the oldest person is on my podcast. What's the longest you've held on to some shit. All right. There's one that was from 1987 88 at least 22 fucking years ago. It still bugs me every once in a while. Just pop in my head.

Speaker 5:          01:27:12       Yeah.

Speaker 4:          01:27:12       Well, why don't we watch some glasses are a novel idea.

Speaker 5:          01:27:17       Yeah.

Speaker 4:          01:27:18       Hey, why don't we not live a life of fucking crimes so we don't have to go to jail? You fucking piece of shit. You know the fuck did you do to get in jail? You dumb fucking idiot. You do. I bet you one of those guys who pulled his shirt over his fucking head and try to rob a seven 11 on a whim. It was another thing before they had really good security cameras, so this asshole wasn't on America's dumbest criminals. I really fucking hate that guy. Still to this day. I remember I had a math teacher one time and he goes, he was asking questions and he goes for number seven, let's call on the dumbest kid in the room, Bill Barr. And it's still fucking bugs me. That was like fucking 24 years ago. You know what? I think that that's what heaven is to me.

Speaker 4:          01:28:07       When I die, I go to heaven and then there's just the line of fucking people that gave me shit throughout my life and I never punched him in the face and they just come one at a time and I blast them in the, they say what they said to me then and I blast them in the face and it doesn't even hurt my hand cause it's heaven and hell and I always fucking win. Um, wow. It's a lot of anger, isn't it? Okay, let's plow ahead. So I go, all right sweetie, let's fucking go up to the God damn Mandalay Bay. I've never been there. So anyways, like I said, it was, it's run by one of the winners of Hell's kitchen or some shit. And when the reality is, is what I'm not realizing is, um,

Speaker 5:          01:28:54       okay.

Speaker 4:          01:28:54       People who win that show.

Speaker 5:          01:28:57       Yeah.

Speaker 4:          01:28:57       I'm now really starting to believe like,

Speaker 5:          01:29:01       okay,

Speaker 4:          01:29:02       it's like last comic standing. You go to go to the winner of last comic standing. Oh, this guy, one last comic standing and then you, you're going to go see some open miker who's got 10 fucking minutes and material. I'm basing that on the first season. I don't know who won the other fucking seasons, but it's a reality show. So I imagine it, it's, it's a fucking, I dunno, somebody with like a fucking Hula hoop going around their head. Somebody with some Soda Hook. God knows that's how this business works. You gotta have a hook, you know, if anything told me that it was, uh, looking at the people headlining and Las Vegas. Yeah, that's not true. There's actually some real comedians out there. George Wallace. I know Bobby Slayton worked out there for a while. There was real comics out there, but the guys who make the big fucking bucks,

Speaker 5:          01:29:55       okay,

Speaker 4:          01:29:55       they just do shit. But yeah, buff puppets. How the fuck is that still entertaining in 2010

Speaker 5:          01:30:07       you know

Speaker 4:          01:30:09       like what I can't do ventriloquism is that right? Ventriloquism is that the right word?

Speaker 4:          01:30:15       You want to hear me talk without moving my fucking lips? I can do that shit. Hey, there they are. Dummy. What did you do today? Yeah. Fuck you bill. Your darker than I am. Isn't that funny? Huh? The downy thing. You're fucking dumb. Oh wait, I got to have a stupid voice. Right? Take it to another level. Hulu, who? Who could fucking, it's sold out shows at Caesars. 10 million a year entertainer of the year. Bill Barr and fucking ham face. Whatever the fuck you're fucking puppet is. Why is the fucking puppet always smarter? Can't somebody switched that up? I'd be arguing with my puppet. The second the puppets started giving me shit. Oh really? You're so fucking smart. What if I take my hand out of your back now look at you. He just fell on your wooden face, didn't you? He had dumped. Fuck. Then I turned on the crowd with the fuck is wrong with you people. What is it? The 1930s. She's we want, we, what do you want me to do after they see what's my fucking encore come out here. I do the Goddamn Charleston.

Speaker 5:          01:31:22       Yeah.

Speaker 4:          01:31:23       Charleston. I could even say it. All right. 25 whispering minutes in. I'm actually starting to get a louder, but you know what? The Sun is a little higher in the sky. And you liked that. Did I sound like a native American? Um, anyways, uh, so let Jesus Christ, let's get to the fucking Mandalay bay.

Speaker 5:          01:31:39       Okay.

Speaker 4:          01:31:40       So we go over to the man late pay and oh yeah, that, that's what I'm realizing that I'm eating at an open mic. Her's fucking restaurant. I didn't even realize that until afterwards. I eat the Burger. I got one of the Coby beef burgers. All right. Now let me say something positive about Mandalay Bay, uh, before I get out of that day, had some fucking insane shows coming up at their house of Blues. All right. Joe Rogan friend of this podcast and uh, he had me on his podcast last week. Joe Rogan is going to be performing there on July 3rd at Mandalay bay. At the House of Blues the day before the, uh, the big UFC fight you off shoe job, your triple the wound. Um, do you have a seat that Joe Rogan video, the buffer three 60. You got to see that just a fucking search that there's a fucking, I don't know if it's a youtube video or if it's just on his, uh, website Joe rogan.net. But check that one out. Really fucking funny video. But anyways, he's playing there and lamb of God, if you're into that, a tolerable sort of death metal, that guy's still sings in that fucking, uh,

Speaker 4:          01:32:58       you know, Tom waits voice, Tom Waits is really the father of death metal if you listened to is the way that guy sinks. Oh to Dow, Dow, you know, or maybe Louis Armstrong, I think it goes Louie Armstrong, Tom Waits and then fucking death metal. Dossie Drees of green red roses too. Um, anyways, so that's a good shit at Mandalay bay. The bad shit is we go to this fucking burger place, I can't remember the name of it. And we go in there and I, I order a $16 and 50 cent fucking Coby beef burger and they're talking about how it's the greatest Goddamn Burger. I'll, you know, the highest quality fucking meat, Yadda, fucking Yada. My girl orders want to 1615 1650 what is that? Kids, that's 33 bucks plus fries plus drinks, all that bullshit. You know, the mob doesn't run Vegas anymore. You can't go out and get yourself a $2 stake. The whole fucking place out there now as a God damn, it's a fuck over. So whatever costs me like 40 something bucks, 50 bucks with the goddamn tip, I eat it. You know, it wasn't even that good.

Speaker 5:          01:34:15       Okay.

Speaker 4:          01:34:15       My girls like, how's your burger? You know what I said? I said, it's good just keeping the peace, keeping the water nice and smooth. Nice and fucking still on the horizon. Okay. So anyways, I get back to my hotel. My girl already tells me she doesn't feel too good at that burger sitting in or like a God damn boot. And I'm like, you know what? I feel fine. I get ready to do my show. I earned my button down shirt, put a little conditioner in my hair, what's left of it, shape it up a little and I head downstairs to go work the Orleans casino, the last place, Carlin ever the place where the smothers brothers retired,

Speaker 5:          01:35:01       you know,

Speaker 4:          01:35:03       smothers brothers who were so fucking edgy. They actually lost their sketch show during the Vietnam War. They did sign, I forget what the sketch was, but they had the balls to say no to the network and do a sketch that was actually criticizing what the fuck we were doing over there. And they lost the Goddamn show. You know, I don't know about you guys, but for me, that's lifetime for respect. So anyways, I walked down there and I'm going through the Orleans casino and then all of a sudden it just fucking hits me. Boom, right in my stomach. Like some capsule, some time release. CIA, you're going to shit your pants fucking capsule goes off. And I know there is no question that whatever I just ate was not good for my body. And it was about to reject it one way or the other without getting crude people, when something goes into your stomach, if it's coming out, it only has two options. All right. Anyways, I just thought of a really, really bad joke for the fucking third one, and I'm not going to say it, but it involved stabbing yourself in the stomach and you can fill in the blanks on that one. All right. So anyways, um,

Speaker 4:          01:36:26       tell him he gotta be fucking do you got to be shitting me? No Pun intended. So I go in the back way, the same way that Carlin used to go in because I've already asked everybody every fucking question. Literally so much. I'm into Carlin. How did he leave? Did he hang out now? We'd say good night and he would go right out the door and he'd be in the car and he wasn't difficult to work with. I guess he had arthritis at the end of his life. And, uh, the sound guy was saying one show, he forgot to take the bottle caps off the water bottles and he saw the car loan was struggling with them and when he got off because George, I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. And George just like whack Matt. Al, come on man. I don't give a shit. Don't worry.

Speaker 4:          01:37:06       Just walked out. I guess he was a really great guy. So anyways, I'm walking through this legendary door and uh, you know, and what's worse is like, I know what's going to happen, but I know it's not going to happen for like another 15 minutes. And coincidentally the fucking show starts in 15 minutes and I'm going on first. All right. And this guy, when you're backstage literally says 20 minutes till showtime, 20 minutes till showtime. He liked counts it down. I never get nervous before shows, but this guy counting down the show is making me nervous. 15 minutes till showtime. Okay. And it's starting to get worse and fuck it. Get literally gets down to two minutes before showtime and I'm questioning, can I make it through a half set? And I was like, you know what? Fuck this. The show can't start without me. My opening music is Elvis Presley. Anyways, the fuck do I care? They can listen to that song. I'm going robe, buffoon. He goes, lose your long black hair slam you four can fly. You solve the fucking sink a Ho, Ho Hoo. I don't give a shit. And I said, fuck it. And I fucking ran into the bathroom and I will spare you the details. But you know, when something either amazing

Speaker 4:          01:38:31       hello, uh, something amazing happens. They make a statue. If something horrific happens, a lot of times they will preserve the area. You know, like Dealey Plaza. Fuck a president gets his brains blown out. All of a sudden we can't change one blade, a fucking grass.

Speaker 5:          01:38:50       Okay.

Speaker 4:          01:38:50       The horror that happened in that fucking bathroom, ladies and gentlemen, I never do shit jokes. They should have retired that fucking bathroom. That's it. They should've just fucking, uh, air sealed it and just put a glass fucking door. Two people could look in and, and, and realize why they closed that fucking burger joint at the Mandalay bay. And a, I got to met, dude. I have, I haven't, this is Monday. I'm finally back to normal. So there you go. There's my big shit story. I had a burger over at the fucking Mandalay bay and it almost ruined my fucking show over at the Orleans. So if you guys saw me, anybody saw me Saturday night. All right. You want to talk about a professional because I extra fucking killed on that show.

Speaker 4:          01:39:44       If you knew what the fuck happened, just know that the next time you go to Vegas and you go to see Barry Manilow and he's singing that song, Mandy, you sobbed and sobbed and then you stomped there. But I still want to fuck you. Oh Man. D right. Just know that he could have just been shit in his fucking brains out. Two minutes before he put on his ray on fucking slacks with his horrific plastic surgery is yanked back face. I bet. You know I was going to say he need another face lift if he fucking shit the way I did before my show. But that's actually not true. There's no strain. There was no straining. Um, anyways. All right, Bill. Jesus Christ enough already. So anyways, one of the things I like to do when I go out to Vegas, I like to check out some of the acts that are out there because Las Vegas is a viable option for a standup comedian. Um, if things aren't going well for you in, uh, in Hollywood, but you're a huge draw as you could actually go out there like, uh, you know, some of the comedians that are out there, I won't name names, but they're making a ridiculous amount of money, you know, 3 million, four, five, $7 million contracts,

Speaker 5:          01:41:09       okay.

Speaker 4:          01:41:10       For the year. And you don't have to travel, you don't have to go on the road or nothing. And believe me, I have thought about it. I've thought about it. It's like you fucking kidding me. 4 million. I'd stay out there for a year. I just do it. I get a fucking, I think I already talked about this. I'd have a, a, a, this is how I had a plan. I was going to have a fucking of really?

Speaker 5:          01:41:36       Yeah.

Speaker 4:          01:41:37       Fucking slam and house that I would rent. And then I would make the casino, give me a car service and I would just have him pick me up, drive me to the Gig, walk right in the back door, like Carlin do my show and walk. That's probably why I did it. I fucking walk right back out, gave me the car and I get the fuck out of there, you know, that way I wouldn't get sick of the casinos or any of that type of shit or at least it would take longer. But a summary One was telling me that Celine Dion actually has it down and yes, I am comparing myself to Celine Dion. Cause sometimes, I don't know if you guys notice when I'm really feeling a joke, I start punching myself in the chest. Um, her fucking music is horrific. She's like the white version of Beyonce, you know, where she's really successful. I'd actually fucker, but the sound of her voice makes me want to just fucking kill myself, you know? I mean, how hard is Beyonce? But her voice is fucking, it's beyond horrific. It's like, it's unacceptable. It doesn't, she sound like she's singing like two octaves higher than she should be.

Speaker 4:          01:42:45       The worst is when you're in like a restaurant and they just have it on. It's sort of low volume and the background and you're like, is someone choking on their food? Actually that wouldn't make sense because that would mean that you could actually get air out if somebody sort of choking on their food. Is there a an s and m couple in the corner booth and the dude is applying just enough pressure. All right. Whatever. Um, anyway, she had it down the best. Celine Dion like she would live, she had a helicopter pick her up at her fucking house. She the land on top of the casino and I, you guys don't understand how much of a drain, the cysts, any performer who's listening to this is fucking, it's got a fucking hard on at this point. This is the ultimate. All right. Other than just having a fucking evil twin robot who always kills and just goes out and does your shows, you know, and the fucking helicopter would pick her up at the house, Flyer over to the casino, land on top of the casino, and then she would just go down, go out, sing, punch yourself in the chest and then just fucking get back on the helicopter and ride back. Do you realize that means she was doing her vocal warmup in like her bathroom, you know, and like five seconds later or whatever as she sat in her kitchen eating fucking fruit loops or some shit, you know,

Speaker 4:          01:44:25       total, total, total, total, total knee hit the fucking sound of those helicopter blades out doing that. We'd be listening to the theme from Mash, bad band and, and, and, and, and Eh, you know, maybe some of that music that they listened to when like apocalypse now. What are some of the music that they listened to? Was that the one at one of those war movies where they would listen to the doors? This is the end. Doodoodoo my only for Dan. You probably wonder why, Bill, what the fuck are you singing so much for on your podcast this week? I'll tell you why. Because, uh, I went out to Vegas and uh, I saw a group out there that was selling out and it was frustrating to me how much people like singers. This group had the worst fucking name of any group I've ever seen in my life. I, it was four people, three guys and one girl, all with like the fucking face lifts face yanked back the fucking hair dyed all well into their 50s except for one of them who might've been 38. And I thought they were an acapella group. They're not, they sing and they have a band there and the name of the group was vocal soup, vocal soup. Is that not the most disgusting fucking name

Speaker 4:          01:45:57       you've ever fucking heard who came up with that vocal soup? So I'm like, I have to go, I have to go on youtube, look them up, look up vocal soup and click on vocal soup and concert and I'm going to sing you some of their lyrics. They sing vocals, sip, Yay. Yay. You take four cool voices and you make them Ha and you give it everything you get. You get vocal soup. How fucking gross is that? It just makes you gag just to think of it and the in the fucking lyrics, they do nothing to try to make it less gross. There's actually a line in that. Then they're stupid theme song that you won't stop slurping till you're burping up focal soup and the end of the video. I Shit you not speaking of Shit, which is the reoccurring theme of this podcast, they actually have an animated bowl of soup that is shit Brown. It looks like a bowl of fucking diarrhea. I know it's gross but I have to accurately describe it and they have notes coming out of it with the steam.

Speaker 5:          01:47:18       Okay.

Speaker 4:          01:47:19       Vocal soup. Ah, it's fucking horrific. Vocal soup and this is what killed me is the one guy in the band, the rocker is actually this guy from the group foreigner and it's just like, okay, whatever. You know, I dunno. Foreign is broke up right now and you had a bad deal. Some behind the music shit. You need money. A, I respect it, but how the fuck did you sign off on vocal soup? Former person that was in foreigner, you know, you don't, you didn't, you didn't speak up like, hey guys, you know, I don't want a big league anybody, you know?

Speaker 5:          01:47:59       Yeah.

Speaker 4:          01:48:00       But I, I wasn't a band that not, not only sold out arenas, not only had a number one record, but I, I want it to say we actually had a pretty cool fucking name. I think we can do better than vocal soup. I mean, I don't want to go the hacky route here with like what movie the rube shoots. What were the other options? Throat Puke.

Speaker 5:          01:48:31       Ah,

Speaker 4:          01:48:33       fucking throat puke. Yay. Yay. You won't stop yakking until you fucking burping up stomach acid. It's fucking horrific. But of course they sell out, they sell out and everybody loves him. And I guess the piano player worked with Frank Sinatra for 10 fucking years and he also signed off on vocal soup.

Speaker 4:          01:48:56       Oh, it's just, I dunno, but they sell out, you know, that's what the fuck happens at Vegas. And it really, you know, Vegas will really help you understand this business as a performer. Like why good things don't make it and why shit makes it all you gotta do is fucking go out there, you know, put a fucking toilet seat on your head. Toilet seat head. Yay. Yeah. If you don't have a toilet and you want to take fuck and shit, I'm all right. I think that says I'm running out of fucking steam here. Uh, let's recommend some youtube videos here. Um, youtube video. I already told you to check out Volkl soup. Oh, it's just making me sick to my stomach to continue to say that name a youtube video. Look up. Best cry ever. MMM,

Speaker 5:          01:49:48       okay.

Speaker 4:          01:49:48       It's unbelievable. And then of course you gotta hit the auto tune remix of it. It really is the best. Uh,

Speaker 5:          01:49:56       yeah,

Speaker 4:          01:49:56       one ever. But don't look at the Popeye's chicken one. I hate when they, people do those, that racist Shit, you know? Um, anyways, um, and then there's another one. This is just an uncomfortable podcasts. I talked to you about my bodily functions. I brought up vocal soup and just for the Trifecta of disgusting, it's usually not, it's never been this disgust. And this, this, I'm going to nominate this one for the most disgusting podcast of all time. Um, and this is the cherry on top here at the last youtube video, uh, is chimp rapes frog. It's really fucking, I actually had to shut it off.

Speaker 5:          01:50:35       Okay.

Speaker 4:          01:50:35       I had to shut it off. Um,

Speaker 5:          01:50:38       okay.

Speaker 4:          01:50:39       It started off as sort of funny and then it's bizarre. And then the people in the background who were filming it are so fucking dumb that you can't, uh, I dunno. They just, he just listened to him and you hear that their parents and you know, you realize why we shouldn't have tried to stop the swine flu, swine flu. I can't even talk. Sorry. I'm tying to talk and type at the same time. And uh, here's something new. Here's, here's the fucking cool old car of the week. Go on. Um,

Speaker 4:          01:51:18       go on youtube and look up a Nash Metropolitan. Now I'm sure people made fun of this and you're gonna be like a course. You like this car bill because you drive a fucking Prius, which you got to check this. This car was a fucking bad ass car. When they will make an all these huge cars back in the day, they made this little fucking car. I don't know. Check it out. Tell me what you think about it. Some people like redid theirs. Um, I know it's not a fucking Mclaren. Don't be a cunt. Just check it out. It's a cool fucking car. Um, by uh, international, I guess Nash and International is somehow combined or something. I don't what happened, they became American motors. I really should have looked that part up, but that's a fucking cool car. It's got three on the tree, you know, you know the old school cars where you had like the a,

Speaker 4:          01:52:07       you know, the, uh, if it was an automatic, the park neutral, reverse drive, all that shit was right on the steering column. But uh, I think last time they made a car with, if it was at, it was a standard and you shifted up there. They called it three on the tree. And I had never even heard of that until I was like fucking 25 years old because those cars were long gone. But this thing, three on the fucking tree, check it out. A Nash Metropolitan. And you know what that's going to be it for the whispering podcast this week. And maybe it was a good thing that I whispered it because it was so fucking disgusting. Let me, uh, let me hype some of my gigs coming up here. Uh, let me go to the official website of bill. I'm going to be the next Gig I have. I'm not working again until, uh,

Speaker 4:          01:52:50       I actually have, uh, July 12th on my website, but I have to change that. I don't get to Montreal till the 13th people. July 13th through the 17th. I'm going to be in Montreal, Canada. Speaking of cities that riot after they win or loose, just like Los Angeles, another sports town of fucking animals who attack police officers and tip over cars. Even if they fucking win, win our loose. Um, I'm going to be up at the Montreal comedy festival, the just for laughs festival. I'm doing my new one hour of material. So while you fucking frogs up there, who want to pretend like you're from Paris, I'm speaking to that shit. Uh, I love the, uh, my actually going to burn a job Burnett show company. Fucking listeners do. I have actually, you know what, my, uh, the guy who actually set up my entire, a podcast player told me a week ago,

Speaker 5:          01:53:57       okay.

Speaker 4:          01:53:57       That as of the beginning of this month told me this a week ago, I had 1 million, 3000 something downloads of my podcast. Do you want to, do you fucking understand that for a second? Let's think about that for a second. If I charged a dollar a podcast, I wouldn't have to do this fucking podcast anymore. That's actually bullshit. First of all, people wouldn't have, you know, I know a lot of people go back and they download all 150, and if it was a buck a piece, they wouldn't, but if I charged a dime a piece, I would add 100 grant, hundred fucking grant, you know, that's almost as much as vocal soup makes a night. All right. So anyways, maybe I'll do that. Maybe I'll charge like a fucking dime. Cause if he didn't notice from the uh,

Speaker 5:          01:54:55       yeah,

Speaker 4:          01:54:56       from the story I was telling you about working Vegas and not having to do the road and that type of thing, that's what happens to performance after awhile is it's not the doing of the show. It's the fucking travel and you try to figure out how the fuck I can get off the road. Initially the road seems like a cool, fun thing to do when it is. But then as you get older and you've been pretty much everywhere, uh, you try to look for ways, what would you guys do if I charge 10 cents now, what would that be? 10 cents you guys were really going to expose me for how dumb I am. That means you can download the entire podcast for 53 fucking years for 15 bucks.

Speaker 5:          01:55:39       Yeah.

Speaker 4:          01:55:39       You know?

Speaker 5:          01:55:41       Yeah.

Speaker 4:          01:55:41       Be $15.

Speaker 5:          01:55:43       Okay.

Speaker 4:          01:55:44       I'd have a hundred grand in my pocket. Granted it would go down to like fucking 50 after the Goddamn government came in. But you know what? You know what that would do? That would buy me a nude fucking dodge challenger.

Speaker 5:          01:55:57       Okay.

Speaker 4:          01:55:57       The fucking top of the line, one with the fucking stripe on it and shit. Um, don't worry, I'm not, I'm not going to charge a dime, but what I am going to do is I'm going to start, I'm at the beginning of guilting you guys into, to my new DVD, okay? Just for the simple fact, dad, I don't charge for this motherfucker. I am real. I am. I am going to let you guys know that I'm going to guilt you motherfuckers. All right? Pay Forward. It's not a, you can't just buy one of my DVDs. You got to buy two, one for yourself to show all your friends and then you got to buy the second one for somebody that you don't really like, but you have to buy him a gift. It's a great fucking gift. You know your boss, you if Canty fucking sister in law, you know, and you have to get him a gift cause they get you a gift as that's a great gift to get is my fucking DVD. It's only fucking 20 bucks.

Speaker 4:          01:56:52       There you go. You can't shut your face and watch this guy trash women for an hour. Um, that's it. Everybody. That's a podcast for this week. I uh, apologize that it was so fucking graphic. I usually don't tell shit stories, shit jokes, bodily feel fluid stories. But uh, it happened. What do you want from me? But anyways, I want to thank the Orleans casino for having me. I had a fucking great time. If you go out to Vegas, go to the Orleans and casino, you know, if you a little more mature and you don't want to deal with those fucking whores walking around. Oh Hey, I gotta I gotta give you guys the name of this fucking thing. I actually, I'm not one of these guys who was into art really. Bill, you just did a fucking shit joke for fucking 45 minutes. If you guys, next time you go out to Vegas, go out to the Peter Lick.

Speaker 4:          01:57:45       Um, Gat Gallery, Peter Lik l. I. K this guy takes pictures of, of uh, like beautiful scenes in nature and he uses this camera from like the 1930s that it literally takes a minute for the, the camera to take a picture. And obviously, I don't know shit about photography, but I don't know what he does. He opened something, it's wide open and he hits it. And because it takes so long to take the picture, it gets all these unbelievable colors. It literally looks like an HD TV picture and uh, they stick you in these rooms and with these dimmers and what they do is they dim the lights down. You, it looks like the sun is going to, I can't explain it, but they have a gallery in Mandalay bay, the Venetian and the, uh, that mall, that covered mall there at Caesar's palace. Definitely check that out. If you going out to Vegas, Peter Lik, you know when you're done checking out Joe Rogan at the House of Blues July 3rd, go to the, uh, oh, you could do that.

Speaker 7:          01:58:52       Okay.

Speaker 4:          01:58:52       Go up there. Don't get a hamburger. Checkout the Peter Lick, uh, pictures and have them sit you down in one of the, in one of the rooms and have them dim the fucking lights and check it out, man. Peter Lik, man, it's the shit. All right. That's it. I hope it was funny. I hope it was a funny podcast. I felt a little fucking hampered by the fact I had to whisper here,

Speaker 7:          01:59:12       but, uh,

Speaker 4:          01:59:15       what the hell did I do? Did I just shut this fucking thing off? No, I didn't. All right, you guys. Everybody have a good week.

Speaker 3:          01:59:20       Alright. Talk to you next week. [inaudible].
