Speaker 1:          00:00:02       Hey, what's going on? It's bill burn. It's time for the Thursday afternoon. Just before Friday, Monday morning podcast.

Speaker 2:          00:00:15       Just checking in on

Speaker 1:          00:00:18       what's going on. Let me do that. Like I'm falling off a cliff.

Speaker 1:          00:00:26       I woke up this morning by Dubai, Dubai, the dumbest song in my head and I can't get it out and now I'm going to sing it to you so it will be stuck in your head. It's a very vengeful thing for me to do. It's something that, you know, pieces of shit guys. Do you know if I'm going down, I'm taking you down with me and all those kinds of pieces of shits. You know, they do that. Uh, the ladies, the ladies like to dabble in that. Well, fuck you. This isn't a relationship. At least I'm getting some of your t shirts, right? They're going to get something from it. Well, if this song's going to be stuck in my head, I'm sorry to say that it's going to be stuck in yours head too. All right, and I have given you a good, I've been talking about this for a good 18 seconds. That's plenty of time. Even if you're driving in the car to hit pause and you're choosing not to, why do you do this to yourself? Why don't you just choose the road that's going to bring you true happiness? Is that because you grew up and you watch people being abused and you felt like you didn't have a choice in life that this is the way it was? You know what, that last 10 seconds is probably going to be worse than the song, but here it is. Right?

Speaker 3:          00:01:34       Okay. Yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:01:42       and it's something, I don't know who sings that song. I don't think I've ever gotten past those first two lines of that song. It's always comes on session presents love songs from the 70s yeah. This one

Speaker 2:          00:02:02       dude, it make my brown eyes blue.

Speaker 1:          00:02:06       Right? And you say and go look at this fucking horse shit. And he start thinking about your childhood and next thing you know you're on the phone with the operator. Can I get the deluxe edition? Yeah. I still have a CD player in my car. Well, because I'm frugal. It's not because I'm failing and I resent you saying that. Of course. I still want the CDS. I'm speaking of my old car, my car. I've had it since, uh, October of 2007. It's a 2008. Oh, it was a brand new. [inaudible] had fucking stars in its eyes, right. Just stepped off the bus here in Hollywood with a piece of Straw between his teeth, like axl rose and the guns and roses video while welcome to welcome to the jungle. Um, and now look at it. Oh, this thing, it looks like somebody attacked it with the fucking can opener. Right. It did as until as of the other day.

Speaker 4:          00:03:01       My uh, my wife was out of town. She was in New York City for the Great Patrice. So benefit, I want to thank everybody who came out and I want to thank everyone who did the show. I unfortunately was not able to get a fucking flight in, in time, if you can believe that I actually missed the benefit is fucking brutal. I had a flight out, uh, Saturday morning, Saturday, and I believe that one I was on American Airlines and they just gave me a call and they were like, like a, you know, when a one 800 number and I went hello. And they were like, hello. Well it says, oh by American Airlines and flora you there's like two or was three as by Ganzel you'll then relocated. No, you might want to grab a pad. You'll dow bed rebooked it's like rubber. What? Seven five zero out of lax on Tuesday, January 26 at 1:50 PM uh, the benefit was on the 26th I was supposed to be flying out on the 23rd.

Speaker 4:          00:04:03       They pushed it three fucking days and I was going to leave for 15 east coast time when the show starts at seven. So I'm like, well, that's not gonna work. So I call my travel agent, you know? And so she got me a flight on JetBlue, 7:45 AM on Sunday, the 24th. So I'm like, no worries. All right, so I miss a day, no big deal. Blah, blah, blah, blah. Right. And then I get a call, I get a call like the night before, I'm all packed up, got my shit right next to the door, and there's like, there's other Connie from jet blue eel bite, whatever, bad at a piece of paper. Right? And then they fucking pumped me to fucking Tuesday. So I said, fuck these guys. I call my travel agent again. Now I'm on virgin. All right. I don't know why they call it Virgin Airlines and then it looks so Jesse in that fucking thing.

Speaker 4:          00:04:52       It's like at the w hotel was a plane, you know, with the fucking aquarium lighting that just says no one wants to see a good look at their face in a mirror after they do what they do in here. Right. So they booked me on that fucking thing and they're like, well, the time we can get you out is right when the New England patriots game starts. And I'm like, oh, that guy, he got TV, I fucking put me on it. Right. And then that one got canceled. So at that point I did deduced if I'm using the word properly, that, uh, that the fucking every, every poor bastard from Saturday and Sunday, now that those flights, it all been canceled. We're now eating up all the Monday and Tuesday once. So, um, I had my travel agent go after another flight and then meanwhile I called my manager, who knows all these big guys and I said, can you get me a replacement in case I, I'm not going to be able to get it.

Speaker 4:          00:05:50       Long story short, I wasn't able to get in in time. We got a replacement and a, I wish I could have been there because a rich vos who crushed it as a host once again this year. And he said, uh, blah, blah, blah, blah. Unfortunately, Bill Burke can't be here. And everyone's like, oh, what the fuck? Where is the red country? Right. And he said, uh, that's the bad news. He said, the good news is Louis C K and Louis CK walked down and they would fucking absolutely mental. And uh, you know, I was replaced one balding redhead with another balding redhead with more credits. So nobody misses me. Um, and I guess he fucking murdered it and then the all had to do is 15 and he, cause he's such a great guy, did like 25, um, and just fucking destroyed and everybody had a great time. And, uh, somebody sent me a picture of, um, of everybody in the end coming out.

Speaker 4:          00:06:47       Al Del Benny flew in all the way from Sydney, Australia. That's another reason why I didn't want to reschedule cause this guy flew in from the other side of the fucking world. And um, Oh, who else was there? Rachel fine find sign. Greer Barnes who absolutely murdered, you know, one of the greatest, who ever did it? Greer Barnes. Um, Jim Norton. I don't have it in front of me. I wasn't there too, so I know I'm going to end up forgetting somebody. But uh, anyways, everybody Godfrey did it. Everybody fucking killed. And uh, they had a great time. So anyway, so I was out here and I was supposed to be in New York from Saturday until Wednesday, so nobody knew that I was out here, you know, so I was just like, well fuck it. I'm not telling anybody I'm here. And I just started handling a bunch of shit that I've been putting off for months, if not years.

Speaker 4:          00:07:42       Um, I did everything from, uh, get my last will together, my, you know, when I die or whatever. It makes sure that everything goes to the people it needs to go to. So there's no fighting hopefully, uh, which is actually, it's really morbid, but it's also fucking kind of cool. It's like, yeah, fucking you take this and you take that in a, I'm out of here. Good luck to you. I had a great time and a great ass. Um, I rolled change that we hadn't jars. I handled that and I dropped my fucking Prius off and I had all the fucking dense repaired. You should say. It looks brand fucking new. There's a couple of little ones that they just, they left in there, they'd buffed the whole thing up. I didn't get new believers because you know, you have new bumpers out here. They last for about three days before somebody just bumps into him.

Speaker 4:          00:08:39       So, uh, I just had a buff those things up and it looks fucking great. And I'll tell you right now, having a paid off Prius with 80,000 something miles on it in La, La is the greatest fucking car you could ever drive. It's just, it's the shit and it takes the too, it's like Ben Roethlisberger. It just fucking shakes him off and he'd get, keeps going. And no matter how bad the gas prices get, I've never paid more than 40 bucks a gallon. I don't give a fuck if somebody runs into it. Um, I could park it wherever I want. Nobody's going to take it. It's fucking perfect. Right. I bought my wife a nice car. It's nice. I can't stand it. I can't, you know, I feel like when I'm driving that thing. Do you make, do you guys ever see that fucking hilarious Howard Stern's movie, private parts? Do you remember when he would show him himself when he first became a DJ in lake? When he went to put the needle on the record and he, he scratched and he fucked the whole thing up. Remember that noise? Who's making it was going to

Speaker 5:          00:09:37       woo. That's

Speaker 4:          00:09:39       what I feel like when I drive that car. Like I'll be going to the grocery store and I'll just be thinking like, God damn and I need to go in there, buy some fucking hamburger. But you know, if I don't see a bunch of wide open spaces, I want parking in there. Cause I know somebody's going to come in and just park right next to it and fucking oh fun that door right into the side of it and it's gonna make me fucking sick. You know, it's like when you go to a movie, right? Like right now's a great time to go see star wars. Maybe in another fucking weak, right? Nobody's going to be there. You go see a matinee, right. And it's during the work week. You're a comedian, you got a Gig that night. You say, fuck it, I'm going to go. I'm going to go see a matinee showing of star wars fucking six weeks after it came out, right?

Speaker 4:          00:10:24       You go in there, there's nobody fucking there. You get your feet up, you having a great time. It is fucking inevitable that someone's going to walk in during the fucking trailers. They going to sit down and right behind you and they're going to talk or munch popcorn fucking loudly, or they're going to be fucking dressed like Chewbacca and is getting, getting, getting hair in their mouth. The other thing we'll be doing that the entire fucking time, it's an at the same, the same way that is inevitable. If you park in a, in a, in a parking lot, some con, even if there's a bunch of fucking spaces is going to pull in right next to you and they can open the fucking door right into it, you know, and that's just regular people forget about out of shape. People who they got to like put stress on the hinges of their doors to just make it wide enough, you know? You know, that's when you know you're fat. When you get like one of those Formula One fucking steering wheels that just pops out so you can get you to gut out.

Speaker 4:          00:11:20       He keep lying to yourself, I'll tell you. And they don't make these for Broncos as big as they used to. Yeah, they do. Yeah, they do. They most certainly fucking do. Um, so anyway, speaking of cars too, and I saw there's somebody up the street, man. It's got to kill a fucking car. It's one of those Volkswagen. Uh, it's not the bug. It's not the Karmann Ghias it's the fucking station wagon. And they put some white walls on it and some fucking fog lights. They got the luggage rack on it. It's fucking cool as shit. I love station wagon. I love a station wagon. Um, sorry, I got a little fucking, uh, who's that guy? It's as big as a whale and it's about to set sail.

Speaker 3:          00:12:06       Okay.

Speaker 4:          00:12:10       Hang on. Sorry. Sorry. I'm singing all these fucking songs. It's a little old place where you could get together and do what, what kind of depravity goes on in the love shack.

Speaker 3:          00:12:23       Okay.

Speaker 4:          00:12:23       Did that song even makes sense. They just went out to a shack and they fucked, I mean, maybe I'm taking it too literally. Uh, what was I looking up? Oh yeah, the, uh, the Volkswagen station wagon. The Volkswagen will dissolve Volkswagen station wagon, a classic VW station wagon on, let's see what this things called. There it is.

Speaker 3:          00:12:51       Okay.

Speaker 4:          00:12:52       The fuck is it called? So I got all the, uh, the pictures of it. That's such a fucking cool car, man. I love the front end on it. And the guy also had it in a stick shift, which I think is a, a picture below a rear view of the Volkswagen Beetle from 61 to 70, 67. That's not what I wanted. One of these days. One of these days, I'm just going to look shit up.

Speaker 3:          00:13:15       Yeah.

Speaker 4:          00:13:15       You know, before it starts. And I'll have a nice news podcasts. I'm imitating my, my science teacher from uh,

Speaker 3:          00:13:25       yeah,

Speaker 4:          00:13:26       from high school. When he was talking about some sort of biology thing. He said, there's this rough and smooth, I forget what it was. And he was like, there's aura and snooze. It used to make a joke out of it and everybody would laugh and you'd never get it wrong on the test, you know? Do you know why there's not more funny teachers is because they all become comedians cause it just like, all right, I'm basically doing stand up here and uh, I'm not making any money, so fuck these kids and their future Volkswagen type three square back. That's all it's called. Come on. They had to give it a better name than that. Oh, this is some fucking gearhead. Thank God damn fucking bastards. Can you just tell me the name of the fucking car?

Speaker 6:          00:14:10       Where did formation,

Speaker 3:          00:14:14       okay.

Speaker 6:          00:14:14       You think I could look it up

Speaker 4:          00:14:19       by the mid sixties it was clear that Volkswagen's iconoclastic, thinks small campaign on behalf of the lowly beetle had succeeded in transforming the third hike.

Speaker 3:          00:14:29       Okay.

Speaker 4:          00:14:30       Wait a minute. Wait, what is this about Hitler? I'm trying to read about the fucking Karmann Ghias typed to, maybe it is a Karmann Ghia. I, you know what the fuck I'm talking about. You know what? I'll just put a picture of. How about that? How I put a picture of that. Hey, did anybody see bill check a football life? It was a two pipe and I gotta admit I was bored shitless.

Speaker 3:          00:14:52       Okay.

Speaker 4:          00:14:52       I, I've never been more bored watching a football life even when it was him and Tom Brady's sitting in the office. I was, it was fucking eggheads shit, but it was just all monotone. Just going. Yeah. Yeah. Lions have a, uh, a good defense. So, uh, you know, I'm to put together a game plan and then Tom Brady be like smiling, but just going like, yeah. I thought maybe we could have the, uh, the running back come out of the backfield. He could explain some things, uh, the underneath of there a secondary, oh yeah, Tom, I'm going to, I'll look into that. Okay. Ville and that'd be like a scene. It was like fucking,

Speaker 3:          00:15:28       yeah.

Speaker 4:          00:15:29       Even when he got emotional, when he went to giant stadium, I was just like, this is a, you know, he didn't get in volt motion. I'm like, if you want to see the emotional why you got to see the Dick for me or one. But I was, I, I can't even watch it. I feel like a bad patriots fan. I can not get fucking through it. Um, maybe I will eventually. So actually that was another thing I did when I was here. I was just binge watching shit. I watched the whole first season of top boy on Netflix. It's only four episodes a fucking good show. Matt and I just started the second one last night. And uh,

Speaker 4:          00:16:06       I watched this documentary on na's who I never got, I never got it. When illmatic came out, I was like, I don't like this. I don't get it right. And now I went back and listened to it. I was like, oh, wait a minute. This is fucking unbelievable. You got to admit, okay, when you're younger, there's a lot, sometimes there's albums that come out or, or artists that come by and you just don't see him cause you're like, Eh, you know, he's an older guy. Like, like David Bowie. I never went to see that guy live. And now doing the classic, now that he's dead, let me take another listen to his fucking music. And I, you know, I had that fucking album, like everybody has that album. I had the Ziggy stardust one and a, that's still an amazing fucking album. Obviously that's been played to death, but that was killer. But I downloaded diamond dogs and it's fucking on. It's unreal. And I was like, I many times could I have seen this guy, I could have seen him on the let's dance toilet dance

Speaker 7:          00:17:04       shows that dad's little blue.

Speaker 4:          00:17:08       Um, I could have seen him on any of those and I never did. You know, Bob Newhart's playing out Friday night, I'm not going to get a chance to see him. His fucking show is sold out. It's like way the fuck out in the desert. And, uh, I got something nine 30 the next morning, so I can't go fucking see the guy. And, uh, so I'm trying to make a bucket list of guys. I gotta go fucking see. I hope they don't, none of, nobody plays his farm. Cause I'm going to see them because not only I respect him as an artist, but I also saw, I'm afraid they're going to die, you know? Uh, I don't want to jinx anybody, but you know they are. Or even you just want to see him before they quit touring. Right? Everyone. Fuck Tony Bennett. Stevie wonder

Speaker 1:          00:17:50       to Bob Newhart to Morton Downey jr right. I'm joking. I already saw him and he's dead. All right, let's plow ahead. I think I got to do a read for the week here. Um, why don't I do the read and I'll be singing the melody to when I need love

Uh, what did I just want to talk about? Something in there reminded me of something. Oh yeah, the fucking, I'm going to be going to Denver when I go to Denver. They're either going to be super bowl champions or they're going to be depressed that they lost, but they're probably still going to give me shit that they beat my patriots. But I've got to tell you this man, this is pretty cool. Do you know Denver is the only team, the New England patriots have a losing record too. And I know a lot of you guys log ah, fuck or Denver. And I'm actually thinking like, I can't believe that's true because I watched the Patriots before Tom Brady. All right.

Speaker 1:          00:22:20       And I think there was very few people that we had a winning record against and the fact that, uh, who's kidding who bill Bella check came in with drew Bledsoe and that really started turning shit around. And, um, just the way that they've won over the, since like 2000 or 2001 I really like the last 20 years, the way they've won, they were, let's see, 20, 35, they were 35 years or 30, 33 years in or 32 years in when drew Bledsoe took over and drew Bledsoe took over 24 years ago. So, you know, that's what it took. It took two and a half decades to undo fucking three decades of fucking up. And, um, I think that's amazing. Now you're probably going, well, why, why the fuck? What are the Broncos doing? You always got to play in that altitude. It was always snowing. And then they had Craig Morton and the orange crushed defense in the 70s. And, uh, I think before that they had that Floyd little great running back, rainy granite shack, um, haven Moses, Rick UPC church there. They always had some fucking guys. And then they got John Elway in [inaudible] 83 and that fucked after Craig Morton. They went, you know, a few years and then 83 Elway came in and that fucked us from 83 to 98. So even when we had drew Bledsoe

Speaker 4:          00:23:46       for the first fucking Ah, six, seven years, it was against, uh, John Elway who's like top three all time, I think, you know what I mean? Um, I'd actually put him ahead of, uh, Peyton Manning, um, personally, personally speaking. Uh, so I'm actually excited that there's 32 fucking teams were one of them. So of the 31 other teams, 30 of them, we had a winning record against. Can anybody else make that claim? I don't think they can. All right, sorry. So anybody watched 60 minutes this past week? They did a, they did this feature feature on mountain lions and our California is the only state that has mountain lions just walking around. I, I'm going to fuck this up in a, in a park, I guess maybe the size of like Griffith Park or Runyon Canyon or, or whatever those ones are out in, uh, out in the valley. I guess they have these fucking things.

Speaker 4:          00:24:48       And, um, so anyways, I was watching it because a few of the places that was where I hike with my dog and this thing has intermittently this, this group of fucking mountain lions has been around there. But fortunately they try to avoid you I guess, um, at least during the day if then I fucking hungry. But they showed this fucking, uh, these people, this mountain lion, right. Okay. They were having some work done. So they had somebody going underneath the house into the crawlspace of their house and they will write up against this park.

But as pet cobra was missing, this was in his fucking car. Thompson was rushed to a blah, blah, blah, or he later died. Yeah, I don't think in Austin they're going to have shit for a cobra unless they got a zoo nearby. Right. It was located above about police believe that Thompson committed suicide by allowing the venomous snake to bite him. Surely before he was found Tuesday, the team posted a cryptic message to his Facebook page. Writing, I'm sorry. Thompson's family owns a pet shot in temple, Texas. He'd worked for the store most of his life. He could handle tarantulas like they were kittens. He loved animals and love spreading awareness about animals in the community.

Speaker 3:          00:34:49       okay.

Speaker 4:          00:34:50       Wait a minute. What the fuck am I here? Where's the rest of this shit? Ah, Jesus Christ. Bill, what are you doing? All right. That's not it. Is this it?

Speaker 4:          00:35:14       Oh, fuck it. Anyway, so that's the end of the podcast. Jesus Christ, Mike and Dialysis to anybody knew that kid. Holy, you know what are the odds for, there's no way he was covered for that. Huh? And you're fucking insurance. Accidental death accidentally getting bit by a Cobra and the wrist and the parking lot of a Lowe's in Austin, Texas. All right. Anyways, that's a podcast. I hope you guys have a great weekend and a stay away from the snakes. So you know what Australia. All right. That was deliberate. So we can't count that one. So we, we, uh, we had three times as many deaths as you did. So why don't you tone down how fucking nuts you status or your country, whatever it is, right island, you know, it's not that fucking dangerous. You know what it is? We buy into it because of the fucking, uh, the shrimp on the Barbie guy, Paul Hogan and then the crocodile hunter.

Speaker 4:          00:36:12       You know, and when you really think about it, how did the crocodile hunter die? Was it one of those snakes that he was constantly fucking with? Was it any other, the land animals that he was constantly fucking with? It was not, he fucked with the sting ray. And he forgot that those things always are armed. They always have a shank. He got stuck right, like a fucking prisoner. Um, as enough time gone by, then she can actually address the foolishness of that death. Like, let me fucking go. Just jump on the back of a sting ray. You know, and I'm not talking about the corvette people I'm talking about the actual fucking fish were boasting. Ray, you gotta watch that little stab. You in the heart. You swim to the surface and pulleys loud. I'm sorry. Anyways, this is the podcast for this Thursday afternoon. Have a wonderful weekend. You cuts, uh, my condolences to that kid in the Lowe's parking lot into the crocodile hunter. Even a Paul Hogan. You know, I don't know what he's up to. I hope he's got a new hat though, you know. Nice new fresh hat. Um, and with that, here's a little bit of music from Andrew [inaudible] and a little bit of throwback podcasts

Speaker 9:          00:37:35       from a, from a year ago.

Speaker 10:         00:38:03       I'm not crazy. I know Brown with assessment and Brett, what'd Y'all bread? And that was, uh, and that is, it built a bit of a dilemma here for you. I'm an

Speaker 1:          00:38:39       18 year old male who's about to graduate from high school. Congratulations. Um, over the past few years I've been told I'm a really good dancer. Uh, not ballet or artsy stuff, but just good dance floor dancing. Oh my God. I'm going to take over the dance floor. Hey Angie, watch me. Yeah. John Travolta. This is great. Do you go out to the, uh, Staten Island Bridge and do headstands with your, with your buddy Bobby? You know, if he didn't have an Afro, he never would have fell off that bridge if you had it high and tight. Like all these Armenians out here, all, every Armenian looks like they know, uh, they, they know. Um, m m m a moose, last time you saw an Armenian dude in his twenties or thirties and he did not look like he could put you in an arm bar within two seconds if you want it to, if I would, if I was a Dana white and I was running the UFC at one point at this point, what they're up to like what?

Speaker 1:          00:39:38       Like UFC 2006, you know, they like run it, they've run out of adjectives this time. It's really, really personal. Right. Not Saying I'm not a fan, I'm a huge fucking fan. I'm just saying, you know, the way they, they, they have those things like every other week there's only so many, like, you know, redemption. Yeah. I mean, you've running out of words. Um, I'm such a fucking idiot. This is what I would do if I was dating a white. At some point I would have, you know, you know what I would, this is what I would branch off. And when they had those tough man competitions and they would have just people coming in, throwing haymakers, which is some of the best boxing ever is when you watch people who just aren't trained whatsoever and they just start, you know, cause somebody is going to connect.

Speaker 1:          00:40:20       Right. I think that they should have one week they should have the Armenians versus the Russians. Tough man competition. Because I really think that that needs, it needs to be decided who is the tougher of the two, uh, cause up more now when it comes to white people. That's, that's who I got my money on. All right. That, those, those are the crips and the bloods of white people is the army and the Russians, all of them, they just have that vibe. Does something you just like. Yeah, I'm not fucking with that guy. Just really, I'm really not doing it anyways. Uh, not a ballet or artsy stuff. Uh, but just ballroom dance in a fucking dead soon over here. Uh, I kind of think of think dancing is gay from an outside point of view. Um, I, I, it isn't, it really isn't. That's just how white people look at it.

Speaker 1:          00:41:14       It's considered gay cause it involves like letting yourself go and actually admitting that you have emotions as a man, as a white male. Yeah, it's, yeah, it is. It's considered gay. Um, as his crying as is showing any sort of emotion as is not dying for no good God damn. Before you're 56, um Oh, not dying. I should say. If you live to be 60, I believe amongst white men, that's also considered gay. Cause that means at some point you cried something out of your chest and he didn't have a heart attack. Um, anyways, he says, I think dancing is gay from an outside point of view, but I'll be the first one to admit that I'm actually a pretty good dancer if I didn't think so, I wouldn't be out there doing it. Yeah. But Dude, you gotta be getting some, I'll, I'll fucking women love a guy who can dance. Dude, if you can dance and you're wearing like a silk scarf, it's fucking over. It's going to be rain in policy. As far as my outside view, my freckled view from over in the bar trying to stand out from underneath those hot lights so I don't get burned. Uh, do you know red heads where the closest thing to vampires, you know, we have, we have none of the powers of vampires, but the sun affects us the same.

Speaker 1:          00:42:31       A friend of mine who was a female dead keeps telling me I could make money doing it on commercials or music videos. Parentheses close on. Or You could go to fucking Broadway. It'd be like one of the five straight men who dances on Broadway and just tag every fucking lonely chick out there who's all stretched out. Just make sure you keep those shoes on. Dancers' feet are always fucked up. Uh, here's where it gets complicated. I plan on becoming a policeman.

Speaker 8:          00:43:01       Okay?

Speaker 1:          00:43:01       Oh Dude, this is, this is a no brainer. You need to dance it. Bachelorette parties dressed as a cop. All you need, dude, is that a fig uniform on a boombox and you're on your way to making money. Dude, you should fucking do that in a second. And then you write a book about it. I was a gyrate and cop for Bachelorette parties and you write a tell all book about how many fucking broads who bought ready got married? You get married, sucked your Dick. You really need help on this one. I mean, I'm going to read the rest of it, but I think I've already come with a solution anyways. How is anyone supposed to take me seriously on the force? If there's a video going with me, pop and locking next, a little Wayne. At the same time, I'll, dude, you should fucking pull people over.

Speaker 8:          00:43:43       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:43:43       You should pull people over and fucking moon. Walk up to their car and just freak them out. Even if they were reaching for a gun, they'd be laughing too hard and they, they wouldn't shoot you. Then you can rest them and then you move up. Next thing you know, you're a commissioner. Alright. Nothing anyways, at the same time, I'm getting laid a lot because of it. Of course you are. I'm a seven on a scale of 10. I like this guy. He's honest and um, uh, and like having a jump shot. It's put me up to an eight five I'm banging tense. I've always wanted to be a cop at the parks here. Seen better if I was able to make money doing it in the dancing thing, I wouldn't just be getting hammers for letting gross moms off on speeding tickets. I could be bagging J lo.

Speaker 1:          00:44:27       She's into dancers. Right? Thanks. Yeah, Dude. Apps a Fuckin lutely dude. You're basically saying, what should I do here? Should I bang j Lo's beat down at the club and make all this fucking money or should I take a job where I'm going to get shot at and not be appreciated? You know, I'll tell you every cop out there with dance if they could, as opposed to being a cop, I don't care if they had like seven generations in. Dude, this is what I think of as far as like dancing. I think if I, if I like compare it to being a comedian, oh the open mics would be getting a piece of cardboard and being on a subway platform, making money that way. And then when you move up to hosting a show that would be addressed as a cop and you're fucking dance at Bachelorette parties. That's what you do on the side. That's like you fucking day job that bullshit. And then during the day, I, yeah, I would try out for those. Fuck I don't, do they make music videos anymore or fucking uh, I dunno. I, I believe it or not, I don't know how to climb the ladder as a dancer. But dude, apps a Fuckin lutely if you can make money doing that shit.

Speaker 4:          00:45:45       And then what the great thing is, is once you get to a certain level to, to, uh, make more money, you know, once you got some credibility, you can, you always have the, the fall back where you can teach a class they get, you can be like, I danced for nine years and Chitty Chitty Bang Bang and fucking banged every fucking brought on there. And then if you'd like to not have, fuck the women in your cast while still not losing your job, come on down to Frankie's fucking day in studio, whatever. Just, you'll figure it out as you go in there and um, yeah, absolutely. Absolute fucking Luli I would definitely do it. You want to do what? He would've taken the time, um, to write in. So your big fears should be whatever. But everybody's big fear. It's like what if I fucking go after this dream and I'm 30 and I'm sleeping on a Fuckin futon and it hasn't happened yet. Well I've got to tell you something sir. I'd been there. I was there at fucking 34. I was still sleeping on a futon and a fucking studio apartment that they called a one bedroom cause they slammed a fucking wall in there and put a door on it. And then one day I was trying to bang the girl upstairs who had the fucking apartment right above me and

Speaker 1:          00:46:52       it was the exact same unit and hers was a studio, but she had been there longer so they never slammed a wall in there. And I realized, hey wait a minute, I'm getting fucked. You know, I should go down there and try to get some money taken off of this. I should go down to the, uh, they're fucking me over rental board. But I didn't, I said fucking just keep writing jokes, right? So whatever, oh, you got to do, you just got to commit to this shit and uh, and then realize that, you know, sleeping on food tone when you're 30 is not the worst thing. It isn't. You don't see them. You know, it's worse than sleeping on futons if 30, sleeping in a king bed next to a fuck a woman you're not really in love with, but for some reason and uh, you've got a couple of kids and you've got a job that you fucking hate, okay? You'll be laying there fantasizing about fucking sleeping on a, on a, on a, uh, on a futon there. There's no risk when you go after a dream, it's all fucking reward. It's all going to lead to something good. It always does. There's a tremendous amount of risk to playing it safe and uh, that leads to unbelievable levels of the retina, which is something else I've also experienced, cause I'm an old one.

Speaker 10:         00:48:16       Ah, shit shy. This is entitled the freight to

Speaker 1:          00:48:43       break up with girlfriend gonna read slow. So this takes up as much time as possible. Hey Bill. Um, I'd like to get your advice on something. I've been dating my girlfriend for almost a year now and I've been thinking about breaking up with her. Well, it's time to break up with their sir. Alright. In Dayton and for a year, you know, you have to still even thinking about breaking it. It's time. Okay. He says we get along fine and we rarely argue. I was just thinking of a great, a great way to break up with someone they should invent like a breakup suit, right? Just something where you just can not get injured and you just put the thing on with the fucking helmet. You don't wear the helmet, you just put the ones the zip up on and which totally protects everything. Right? And then you get in the passenger seat and you let her drive.

Speaker 1:          00:49:31       Oh, why are you gonna let me drive? Why did you just drive tonight? But you always liked to drive honey, you just drive. Okay, why are you wearing that suit? It's all gonna make sense in about five miles, right? You get out on the fucking highway. He just started talking to her and out of no way, he just put the helmet on, you know, when she says, what are you doing? And just say, listen, I don't want to go out with you anymore. And then she goes, what? And you go, hey, watch this. He just opened the door and you roll out of the fucking car. That's it. You're out. You know, type up a fake police report. You told me you died and then she feels bad for you. You don't have to deal with any sort of repercussions. Um, anyways, he says we get along fine and we rarely argue, but I'm starting to realize I don't really want to be with her for the long haul.

Speaker 1:          00:50:19       And we started dating, oh, this fucking thing. These iPad suck by the way. All right. You know what an Ipad is? It's it's fucking laptop for pussies. What's a matter? You laptop is too heavy. You fucking douchebag this thing doesn't have a keyboard. It's got nothing. You think that they don't know how to make this thing into a fucking laptop already? Of course they do. This is this Steve jobs way of doing things rather than just giving you the whole fucking thing. He's going to give you tea an inch increments, like a God damn drug dealer. You know I, that's why I haven't bought one of these yet. This is knee is by the way, bar of this fucking thing and I am not enjoying it. As you can tell us, I'm throwing a temper tan from here. You know what? I'm going to buy a fucking IPAD.

Speaker 1:          00:51:02       I'm going to buy it when it is a laptop, when it is a little light laptop. Until then I'm not, I'm not having this fucking this. This is like a, this is like when you, you know, you go, I, you know, I really want to get the new Camaro and then you get the one with the v six engine rather than getting the full out one with the stick shift, which is a laptop, right. He's too heavy, you know, fucking deuce. Do Shoulders at the gym next time you do that. Okay. Maybe do that. Maybe to do some stuff to build up your risks. Oh God, they'll can you get through the question? All right. I, well, um, he says, uh, when we first started dating, I loved hanging out with her, but I'm just not into anymore. Does that make me an asshole? No, it doesn't.

Speaker 1:          00:51:41       Why would your own true feelings make you an Asshole, sir? How awful were your parents?

Let's not take out your bad day on everyone else. Okay? You're embarrassing me. All right. I'm 23 years old, but somewhat of a decent job and really just want to go back to being single for a while.

Speaker 1:          00:52:24       Exactly. Dude, you're 23 years old. Dude, you're fucking movie star at that age. I don't care what you're doing for a living. Should definitely be single. I said, the problem is she's got a lot less, she's got a lot of stress in her life right now. Not your problem. She's finishing nursing school and trying to find a job. All right, well tell her to put on the outfit Banger one more time and hey, watch this. You bail out of the car. That's mean. Um, anyways. He says, oh, and she has a history of depression over the past year. I feel like she's becoming emotionally dependent on me. Like I'm keeping her going or something. Well, Jesus Christ and what do you want to get rid of her? You don't want this,

Speaker 11:         00:53:08       you know,

Speaker 1:          00:53:10       you want something that someone that's going to be fun to be around. You don't want her, you know, it's sunny out and she's like, it's raining out that fucking head under the pillow.

Speaker 11:         00:53:22       Okay,

Speaker 1:          00:53:23       well these days, you know he stayed with that long enough one these days you just going to, it's going to smother it with that pillow is anyways. So how do I go about breaking up with her while causing the least amount of damage? Uh, he said also she always leaves some of her shit and my apartment. Yes. Cause she's, she wants to fucking, she's clinging onto you. It says close blanket. Other random shit. I tried to get her to take a shit home with her, but how do I avoid after, uh, the after break up coming over to get my stuff. I hate that. Anyway. Go Fuck Yourself. All right,

Speaker 11:         00:54:01       look,

Speaker 1:          00:54:03       there's no way. There's no easy way to break up with somebody. All right. There's just easier ways. Uh, the sooner the better.

Speaker 11:         00:54:14       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:54:16       Oh Diane, I'll do it. This is like, this is like dismantling a bomb. So you know, what you would like to do is say, Hey, can you come by today? I want to talk to you about something. Right. And she always share. I'll be right over and then immediately just take out a box, put all of her shit in it, tape it up and then she rings the bell. Bing Bong. You opened the door, he got, yeah, don't want to date you anymore. And he just handed the box and close the door. Right to this money to be made in this man. Does anybody have a professional breakup service at such a pussy thing to do? But that would be phenomenal. You know it, you feel, you make a person feel like they got fired. You're like when a corporation fires you and just to security people show up, you know, confiscate your computer and then escort you out of the building.

Speaker 1:          00:55:03       When that be great do, that's what you should do. Just hire to your friends to dress up like security guards. Tell her you want to break up, you know, and then they have all their shit in the box. Then they escort, escort or right out of your apartment building. Like she got fired. They come off as professional rather than like personal. Um, how do you go about breaking up with it? You know what I would do? Uh, I wouldn't put all his shit in the box because that's going to come off cold, you know, and you don't want to hurt her failings like that. So I would just, uh, uh, fuck it. I don't know. I don't know how to do it. Why did I drink last night? And then I got up and did opie and Anthony, what the fuck is wrong with me? I knew I had a podcast to do. He embarrassing. Um,

Speaker 11:         00:55:49       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:55:50       I don't fucking know. Have a come over and just say, listen, I'm not happy. Oh, that's a great one. That's a classic. You know, like if you were a singer songwriter the second he said that the whole crowd would start applauding, recognizing the big hit,

Speaker 11:         00:56:06       you know,

Speaker 1:          00:56:08       of all the girls I do before, you know, they all start fucking clapping. You know, if they just came out, you just had classic breakup monologues, listen, um, I'm just not happy. Everyone just at smattering of applause. You wait for it to die down. Let the orchestra come around again. She jumped back in on the one, um, matched. Tell you're not happy. I'm not happy anymore. And Dude, let me tell you something. Her being depressed is not your fucking problem. All right? Her being depressed is the fucking problem. How can you do this to me? What do you mean? How can I do this too? You don't want to be words. If I fucking stayed with you and I didn't love you, I don't love you anymore. I don't love you. Depressed whore.

Speaker 11:         00:56:50       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:56:51       I just called you a whore as a generic term. You know, I don't, I'm, I'm not happy. I want to, okay. I just feel like want to be single right now. I just don't feel like I'm going to be with you in long haul. Uh, would just be wasting each other's time. My time is important and so is yours. All right? I don't want to go anymore, but I'll tell you what. If you go to stamps.com, they'll give you $55 free stamps to the scale. That's what you do. Just tag every mean thing you say with all the advertising. You know, if you go to amazon.com so bill burrs website, you know, click on the Little Amazon banner, whatever you buy, you know, portion of that money goes back to bill burn. Then the percentage of that goes to the wounded warriors project. So I know I'm breaking up with you right now, but you could, we could also support the troops,

Speaker 11:         00:57:40       right,

Speaker 1:          00:57:42       sir? Look, there's no fucking easy way to do this. And you're going to be sitting there. How many more holidays? How many more birthdays? How many more Christmases, which is a holiday? Sorry, he always need three examples. Do you want to go through with this person? How many more times do you want to go out and rent bikes? Go to a picnic, sit there on a sunny day. Is she sitting there with that cloud over fucking head?

Speaker 11:         00:58:04       You know,

Speaker 1:          00:58:06       don't you know, don't do that to yourself. He might have fucking people who have just wonderful human beings and they just end up with assholes. I swear to God, assholes. They look for wonderful human beings because other assholes are not going to put up with them, you know? So you need to be an ass hole here and you know the, the, the how society looks as an, as an asshole. Like you're being selfish, not being selfish, all right? Choose yourself, choose your own fucking life dumper and get on with your life.

Speaker 11:         00:58:35       You don't,

Speaker 1:          00:58:36       this is what you do. You get yourself by six of fucking Pale Ale or whatever beer you like. You stick a couple of glasses in the fucking freezer.

Speaker 11:         00:58:46       All right?

Speaker 1:          00:58:48       Like anticipation of this championship that you know you're gonna win. You know, like they did in the red sox dugout when they had the champagne on ice in game six in 1986 before they had to quickly wheel it out, okay? Except you're not going to let this one go through your legs. Are you kicking this one right in the cunt and you taking home the fucking championship and when it's over all you got to be just thinking about those frosty fucking bruise in the fridge. Just think about that. Just look at the clock when she walks in. All right. Let's say she comes in at 10 past two. Just say to yourself, worst scenario by three fucking 30, I'm going to be sitting down in this fucking couch. All right, with my goddamn phone off, drinking a couple of five or six of these things and then that's it. All right. And then don't fucking have a post breakup sex. Don't do that. Cause then she'll think that you're back together again. Fuck all of that. All right. In your mind, just think gotta come by. Yeah, my staff. Okay. When do you want to come by? This is coming off really cold. She's got to do all of that and just try to keep dragging you back into the fucking thing. Um,

Speaker 1:          01:00:10       I dunno if this is a punk thing to do, but after you break up with her, just don't answer the phone when she calls and then she'll find, just say, listen, I got a, I got to come by. Get my stuff. Can you text her back? I fucking just be a man. What is she going to do? Body Slam you. She's just going to make you feel bad. All right?

Speaker 3:          01:00:29       Ooh is a good little blue you would do.

Speaker 1:          01:00:37       No, it's cause you're a mopey. You're sucking the life out of me. You know when, when you get that sad look on your face, you look like a muppet there. I said it all right. There's your shit over there in the corner. I got a couple of cool ones in the fridge, so why don't you do me a favor. All right, get over there. Bend Down, lift with your knees, get your shit and get the fuck out of here. When he say that, touch your prince charming is out there somewhere. You know, and it ain't here. I'm not riding that horse anymore. Okay? I just shot it in the back of the head. It's over. Okay, so why don't you trudge on out of here? They're fucking Cinderella. Go look at a mirror. I go climb up in a tower and fucking drop your hair out. Whatever the fuck he supposed to do. Kiss a frog. All right, I got drinking to do [inaudible] beat it. Something like that. Like I said, all that bullshit. I said 10 past two, it's over by three 30. By three 30, you're boozing.

Speaker 11:         01:01:33       All right.

Speaker 1:          01:01:37       I don't know. Now they're fucking brutal breaking up often this at this fight.

Speaker 9:          01:01:43       But other than that [inaudible] [inaudible] I dunno,

Speaker 1:          01:02:42       I've been all over the map politically, but it's why like, you know, certain ways of looking at shit, like when people talk about guns, like let's just make them won't, let's just make them illegal and that nobody will have, um, you know, like that's sort of like thought process is you're, you're acting as though the world is a utopia and that there's not morons and that there's not, uh, people who say, I don't give a fuck what the rules are. You're totally not even taking into consideration sociopath's which is why that new fucking thing that Obama signed, that whole defense package where now they can just arrest people without a trial. Jay put you in jail forever with, without a trial because they just think you're a fucking terrorist. Geeky kid. Give people that level of power. I'm a fucking moron. And I know you can't do that.

Speaker 1:          01:03:32       Historically, no one has ever handled that level of power. Well, anybody here want to go live in China? Oh, we out there practicing and nunchucks wearing your wooden slippers and all of a sudden a van pulls up and you disappear and that's it forever. You want to live there? Of course you don't. You want to live here where they can't fucking do it. Well, they can do it now. You know? They just put in a fucking order for a bunch of black fans. That's what I heard. Gordon Dot. Holy shit.com that's what's going down. I don't understand why stuff at that level that affects citizens to that level. Why we don't get to vote on it. Do you think it's because we'd say, Hey, you know what? Fuck that you want to stand like that is just a jump off point. Do you think like that's just how it's going to smell as well.

Speaker 1:          01:04:19       You're not a terrorist dinner. You ain't got to fuck bro. You think it's just going to stop with that. That's not how you take away freedom. You don't just fucking do it all in one fail swoop. It's incremental. It's just like when you're dating some fucking woman and you're not paying attention and she just gradually, every day it takes another foot of real estate. Next thing you know you're in goal line day going, how the fuck did I end up in this situation? He started at the 50 little push, a little poll, right? Everything was fine. [inaudible] casino, you're up against the Golan. You think that they're just going to keep it with the terrorist thing, you know? You know they'll wait for a whole nother generation of babies to be born and they always grew up with government having that level of power and then they add something else to it. Then they had something else. Then that's it. You can't have, okay, if tiger woods can't handle the level of free pussy on a golf tour, how the fuck is our government going to handle a new defense package? Which basically gave them a mute button.

Speaker 8:          01:05:19       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:05:19       When you love the Ha, how would you handle that if you had that power, do you, how long before you just started abusing that? If you could just hit mute on anybody who ever disagreed with you and it just, and you could have them whisked away. I mean that is just sociopath's wet dream. That's what that is. That is a fucking mute button, Mr Style and don't you think that's it? He hit mute. You're done. You're gone. See Ya. I think, I think it's, it's fucking insane and I'm, the only thing that I get out of it is that I feel like I was proven correct that I don't think it matters at that level. Whether you vote Democrat or Republican Obama, the first black president ever, you would think this would be the most liberal a politician in the history of this country.

Speaker 8:          01:06:17       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:06:18       Because of his background, you would think that he signed off on that shit.

Speaker 8:          01:06:22       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:06:23       All right. I'm telling you, I don't know what happens when you become president, but I think they let you peek just enough behind the curtain and there was a fucking agenda that we are moving towards because it does. I don't think it fucking matters. I really don't, which is why I always vote for the Ralph Nader, the fucking Ron Paul, all those guys that all those fucking idiots go, oh, do Kush. You did that. You've ruined the election. Really? Did I?

Speaker 8:          01:06:55       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:06:56       I feel like those guys wouldn't have signed shit like that. I feel like their track record shows that they would not sign shit like that. I, I dunno. I have no, I imagine I'm going to get a ton of fucking emails I'm going with somebody was yelling at me one time saying that because I voted for Ralph Nader in 2000. That's why George W. Bush won. And they was just going on and on and on about it. And I was like, dude, I live in New York. Al Gore won my state. Okay. Do you understand that? So your whole fucking theory right now is out the window. I voted for Ralph Nader in New York and Al Gore still one mistake. So go fuck yourself. What I'm trying to do, uh, Mister fucking red and blue tie here, I'm trying to fucking encourage more people like that to vote. So mission accomplished. That's what I'm trying to fuck and have to vote to run, you know uncorruptible how far can you get if you're uncorruptible I would say that you can get to the, uh, what, whatever level politics is when you decide whether or not they should put a gazebo in the center of town. I think beat, once you get beyond that, you got it. You got to be a little dirty. Right. I love talking about this shit cause it just stirs people up,

Speaker 4:          01:08:16       you know? Oh you know, maybe you should all read a little more before the next time you fucking own. Really. What are you reading? What are you reading? What they give you? Is that what you're reading? Fuck head. Why you acting like you have clearance to the bottom floors of the fucking Pentagon, you're guessing? Just like I am. All right, Mr informed I read the pamphlet. I don't buy a fucking word of it. You know, you can use coca cola to take rust off of metal. You can use it for that. You know, you understand that yet they're still able to sell it to us. Like it's refreshing.

Speaker 9:          01:09:01       I Dunno what that point meant either [inaudible] [inaudible] no, Jackie Ladies and gentlemen.
