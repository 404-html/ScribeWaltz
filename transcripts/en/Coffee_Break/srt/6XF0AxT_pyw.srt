1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:01,073
Right off the bat.
Let's dispense with the whole 

2
00:00:02,220 --> 00:00:05,060
objectivity thing.
No one's always write objectively,

3
00:00:05,250 --> 00:00:08,820
but you can use tricks and sophistry 
when logic and facts aren't on your side

4
00:00:08,821 --> 00:00:13,080
to always be right in an argument.
The whole goal here is to try to win.

5
00:00:13,081 --> 00:00:13,914
It's an intellectual war.
Air Go all is fair in love and 

6
00:00:15,781 --> 00:00:18,060
arguments.
I think Sun Tzu said that once.

7
00:00:18,390 --> 00:00:19,223
This is going to be an abridged list of 
dirty little tricks taken from Archer 

8
00:00:22,110 --> 00:00:22,710
Schopenhauer,
his book,

9
00:00:22,710 --> 00:00:23,543
the art of being right.
The full book and audio book is linked 

10
00:00:26,011 --> 00:00:27,660
below.
I've just picked my favorites.

11
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:30,450
Let's get into it.
First postulate.

12
00:00:30,451 --> 00:00:31,284
What has to be proved.
This is where you bring up a conclusion 

13
00:00:33,870 --> 00:00:37,260
as if it were a premise.
It's also known as begging the question.

14
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:38,333
Here's an example.

15
00:00:38,680 --> 00:00:39,513
I began this campaign because I was so 
tired of seeing such foolish things 

16
00:00:44,771 --> 00:00:45,730
happen to our country.

17
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:47,113
Notice how he says,
the reason I began this campaign is 

18
00:00:49,311 --> 00:00:52,880
because the country was doing so poorly.
He never proves how the country is doing

19
00:00:52,881 --> 00:00:56,600
poorly or why it's doing poorly.
He states it as a matter of fact,

20
00:00:56,690 --> 00:00:59,630
upfront postulate.
What has to be proved.

21
00:00:59,690 --> 00:01:02,150
This is a great way to sneak your point 
past the goalposts.

22
00:01:02,390 --> 00:01:04,250
Next,
choose your definitions.

23
00:01:04,370 --> 00:01:06,470
This works best at the start of an 
argument.

24
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:10,100
If you want to control the conversation,
try to control the definitions,

25
00:01:10,490 --> 00:01:13,760
what someone might call extremism.
Another person might call passion,

26
00:01:13,761 --> 00:01:14,594
what some call a right to assembly.
Others might call it disrespectful or 

27
00:01:17,421 --> 00:01:20,180
disruptive.
Here's an example from a recent debate.

28
00:01:20,540 --> 00:01:21,373
Pay attention to how much time is spent 
framing the other person's position and 

29
00:01:25,401 --> 00:01:29,150
conversely how much the other one fights
against this framing.

30
00:01:29,540 --> 00:01:30,373
They both know that the words you use to
define the other person's position is 

31
00:01:33,741 --> 00:01:36,850
everything he ran as a socialist,
an honor leaders,

32
00:01:36,870 --> 00:01:37,703
socialists dollar randoms,
it independent and sort of being 

33
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:40,633
independent.
The history of the United States called 

34
00:01:41,670 --> 00:01:43,930
are you a socialist or not?
I am a democratic social.

35
00:01:43,940 --> 00:01:46,780
Okay folks,
but don't tell him I didn't run as often

36
00:01:46,781 --> 00:01:48,680
as I ran to me.
When you told people you were socialists

37
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:50,360
fun runners,
a right winger,

38
00:01:50,361 --> 00:01:51,650
you ran as a Republican,
right?

39
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:56,400
I am happily up and I am happily

40
00:01:58,160 --> 00:02:02,390
frame the conversation in your way.
No matter if you're talking about gender

41
00:02:02,391 --> 00:02:05,390
or unemployment,
how you define it is everything.

42
00:02:06,050 --> 00:02:07,670
Number three,
persuade the audience,

43
00:02:07,730 --> 00:02:10,160
not the opponent.
If you're in front of an audience,

44
00:02:10,161 --> 00:02:10,994
tactically,
it doesn't matter if the person to your 

45
00:02:12,471 --> 00:02:14,540
left or right agrees with you.
Only the crowd.

46
00:02:14,780 --> 00:02:16,820
This is pretty easy.
It's the quip,

47
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:18,800
the one liner.
Whatever gets the laugh.

48
00:02:19,190 --> 00:02:21,980
The most important thing to remember 
here is the audience isn't just there to

49
00:02:21,981 --> 00:02:24,410
see who objectively wins.
It's a spectacle.

50
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:27,590
They want to laugh.
They want to see who looks more composed

51
00:02:27,591 --> 00:02:28,424
under the lights.

52
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:30,313
I have as much spirits in the congress 
as Jack Kennedy did when he sought the 

53
00:02:34,821 --> 00:02:37,130
presidency.
Senator,

54
00:02:38,690 --> 00:02:42,850
I served with Jack Kennedy.
I knew Jackie Kennedy Sanitary.

55
00:02:42,851 --> 00:02:44,090
You got to know Jack Kennedy.

56
00:02:52,530 --> 00:02:53,210
If you notice it,
that's

57
00:02:53,210 --> 00:02:55,230
the opponent seems to wither after this 
mine,

58
00:02:55,620 --> 00:02:59,130
but he really didn't say much at all.
Number four,

59
00:02:59,140 --> 00:02:59,973
the Kafka trap.
This is a particularly rude trick frame 

60
00:03:02,350 --> 00:03:06,280
and accusations such that the denial is 
only further evidence of guilt.

61
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:09,940
Think the red scare or witch hunts.
When you accuse someone of something and

62
00:03:09,941 --> 00:03:10,960
they refuse it,
just say,

63
00:03:10,990 --> 00:03:13,090
oh,
that's what someone like that would say.

64
00:03:13,780 --> 00:03:15,450
Here's an example from monty python.

65
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:22,400
Oh,
nice.

66
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:34,320
If you deny it,
you did it.

67
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:37,950
That's a Kafka trip.
Five arguments ad homonym.

68
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:39,113
If all else fails you.
Personal attacks are always a great 

69
00:03:40,711 --> 00:03:43,050
diversion to get off a particular point.
You're losing.

70
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:44,910
The examples here are endless.

71
00:03:45,340 --> 00:03:46,173
I think we can have a rational political
conversation about balancing rights and 

72
00:03:49,781 --> 00:03:52,300
risks and rewards of all of these 
different policies,

73
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:54,810
but I don't think that what we need to 
do is demonized.

74
00:03:54,811 --> 00:03:57,610
People on the other side is as being 
unfeeling about the,

75
00:03:57,630 --> 00:03:58,463
about what happened in San Antonio.
You accuse me of standing on the graves 

76
00:04:01,110 --> 00:04:03,850
of the children that die that day.
I seen you do it repeatedly.

77
00:04:03,860 --> 00:04:05,320
Peers,
like I say,

78
00:04:05,321 --> 00:04:08,540
how do you hire people illegally and 
enter to 1 million

79
00:04:10,950 --> 00:04:13,530
along with everybody?
You get along with nobody.

80
00:04:13,531 --> 00:04:14,730
You don't have one republic,

81
00:04:15,780 --> 00:04:16,613
have

82
00:04:17,110 --> 00:04:20,680
one Republican senator and you work with
them every day of your life,

83
00:04:20,681 --> 00:04:22,870
although you skipped a lot of time.
These are minor details,

84
00:04:23,470 --> 00:04:26,590
but you don't have one Republican 
senator back in you,

85
00:04:26,620 --> 00:04:27,453
not one.
You don't have the endorsement of one 

86
00:04:29,290 --> 00:04:32,070
Republican senator and you work with 
these senator Cruz.

87
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:33,370
You should be ashamed of yourself.

88
00:04:33,670 --> 00:04:37,150
Notice how in both cases,
ad hominine was used to distract.

89
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:38,193
To deflect the underpinning question.
This technique is very effective and 

90
00:04:42,281 --> 00:04:45,730
finally we come to number six,
the absurd proposition.

91
00:04:46,150 --> 00:04:46,983
This is where you offer an extreme 
scenario where you equate things that 

92
00:04:49,211 --> 00:04:50,044
aren't equal at all,
but if you disguise it well enough and 

93
00:04:51,611 --> 00:04:54,010
if your opponent can't find where your 
argument is falling apart,

94
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:55,930
it can pressure them into agreeing with 
your point.

95
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:58,300
Here's another example.
I love South Park.

96
00:04:58,740 --> 00:05:01,510
Are you guys dub?
We can't beat him even with all of us.

97
00:05:01,570 --> 00:05:02,403
It's a waste of time that if you had a 
chance right now to go back in time and 

98
00:05:05,741 --> 00:05:07,480
stop Hitler,
wouldn't you do it?

99
00:05:08,020 --> 00:05:10,710
I'm just going to stop plague when hit 
the rest power.

100
00:05:10,740 --> 00:05:12,340
There were a lot of people who just 
stopped playing.

101
00:05:12,940 --> 00:05:14,890
You know who those people were?
The French.

102
00:05:15,580 --> 00:05:17,560
Are you French guy?
No.

103
00:05:17,980 --> 00:05:20,670
[inaudible].
All right.

104
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:21,580
All right.
I'll do it.

105
00:05:21,820 --> 00:05:25,320
If your opponent doesn't spot the trick.
This is a particularly effective tactic.

106
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:28,000
That's everything I'm going to give you 
scoundrels right now.

107
00:05:28,180 --> 00:05:30,610
The full list is in Archer Schopenhauer,
his book.

108
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:31,473
The secret is to disguise these within 
an argument so that people don't know 

109
00:05:34,271 --> 00:05:36,430
that you're playing tricks,
and if you can do this well,

110
00:05:36,431 --> 00:05:39,160
you'll find yourself being right more 
often than you thought possible.

111
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:41,800
But even if you're trying to be fair and
honest and an argument,

112
00:05:41,801 --> 00:05:44,740
knowing these is always helpful to keep 
the other guy honest.

113
00:05:45,010 --> 00:05:48,430
Knowing how people want to fight dirty 
is the best defense to fight clean.

114
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:50,333
But either way,
whether you're running for office or in 

115
00:05:51,731 --> 00:05:54,510
a late night argument,
please fallacy responsibility.
