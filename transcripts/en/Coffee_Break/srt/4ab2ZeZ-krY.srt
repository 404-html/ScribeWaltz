1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:02,070
If you've ever worked in a corporate 
setting before,

2
00:00:02,071 --> 00:00:04,410
corporate jargon is a familiar,
hated fact of life.

3
00:00:04,590 --> 00:00:06,180
Stuff like this can be pretty 
frustrating.

4
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:07,373
I will.
Company has a new strategic initiative 

5
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:12,540
to increase market penetration,
maximize brand loyalty.

6
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:15,653
It's easy to wonder if there isn't a 
simpler way to communicate at work and 

7
00:00:18,421 --> 00:00:19,254
it seems like the higher up in the 
corporate ladder you go the worst the 

8
00:00:21,001 --> 00:00:21,834
jargon gets.
Managers are perhaps the most notorious 

9
00:00:24,091 --> 00:00:24,924
for this,
and I'm not criticizing technical 

10
00:00:26,161 --> 00:00:26,994
jargon,
which is necessary to describe specific 

11
00:00:28,441 --> 00:00:31,110
details in every industry and 
criticizing fluff jargon,

12
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:31,973
corporate speak,
the kind of vague lexicon that makes up 

13
00:00:33,841 --> 00:00:37,290
so much of office working life.
It isn't just inefficient.

14
00:00:37,350 --> 00:00:40,380
It allows for confusion and corruption 
to hide in plain sight.

15
00:00:41,190 --> 00:00:43,440
Look,
there are valid reasons to say this,

16
00:00:43,830 --> 00:00:47,340
keep things high level and then go after
the low hanging fruit,

17
00:00:48,330 --> 00:00:50,070
but there aren't that many reasons.

18
00:00:50,370 --> 00:00:51,203
Sometimes it's to soften bad news.
We're restructuring and optimizing 

19
00:00:54,031 --> 00:00:54,864
capital.
Location sounds a lot better than we're 

20
00:00:56,101 --> 00:00:56,934
firing people.
You're a great candidate with a lot of 

21
00:00:58,501 --> 00:01:01,740
exciting prospects is a better intro to 
a job rejection letter.

22
00:01:01,950 --> 00:01:04,140
Then the truth,
you weren't qualified enough.

23
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:06,570
Other times it's to sound more 
professional.

24
00:01:06,571 --> 00:01:09,840
Let's double down on our 80 20 
operations sounds a lot more respectable

25
00:01:09,841 --> 00:01:12,450
than let's do more of the stuff that 
makes us money.

26
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:15,450
These are all legitimate ways to use 
corporate jargon,

27
00:01:15,690 --> 00:01:16,523
but mashed together too much corporate 
speak and it can render speech and 

28
00:01:18,841 --> 00:01:21,270
writing all but incomprehensible.
In fact,

29
00:01:21,271 --> 00:01:22,104
as a testament to this,
Andrew Davidson made a corporate lingo 

30
00:01:24,061 --> 00:01:27,090
generator online that spits out 
professional sounding gibberish.

31
00:01:27,300 --> 00:01:28,133
For example,
we have robust networks of strategic 

32
00:01:29,731 --> 00:01:32,610
assets that we own or have contractual 
access to,

33
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:33,593
which gives us greater flexibility and 
speed to reliably deliver widespread 

34
00:01:36,301 --> 00:01:37,440
logistical solutions.

35
00:01:37,830 --> 00:01:38,663
We have metamorphosed from an asset 
based pipeline and power generating 

36
00:01:40,741 --> 00:01:44,580
company to a marketing and logistic 
company whose biggest assets are.

37
00:01:44,581 --> 00:01:45,414
It's well established business approach 
and innovative people and this is 

38
00:01:47,521 --> 00:01:50,220
exactly where corporate lingo and jargon
has a dark side.

39
00:01:50,580 --> 00:01:53,580
It allows people to hide things in plain
sight without anyone noticing.

40
00:01:53,910 --> 00:01:56,700
As I read that randomly generated 
statement full of jargon in your eyes,

41
00:01:56,701 --> 00:01:57,534
probably glazed over a little.
You probably didn't pay that close of 

42
00:01:59,461 --> 00:02:00,294
attention,
and that's exactly what the people 

43
00:02:01,411 --> 00:02:03,630
writing or saying these things want or 
expect.

44
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:05,760
They're designed that way.
In fact,

45
00:02:05,761 --> 00:02:08,670
what I just read wasn't from Andrew 
Davidson sites at all.

46
00:02:08,850 --> 00:02:11,640
It was jeff skillings final letter to 
the Enron shareholders,

47
00:02:11,641 --> 00:02:13,320
reassuring them that everything was 
fine.

48
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:15,270
You know,
right before it went under as one of the

49
00:02:15,271 --> 00:02:17,340
most blatant and fraudulent companies of
the decade,

50
00:02:17,610 --> 00:02:20,220
and it isn't just using business.
In this clip,

51
00:02:20,250 --> 00:02:21,083
Jack a off and infamous lobbyist in 
Washington reflects on some of the 

52
00:02:24,001 --> 00:02:26,730
tricks of language he used to get things
done for his clients.

53
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:32,320
What we did was we crafted language that
was so obscure,

54
00:02:32,570 --> 00:02:35,360
so confusing,
so uninformative,

55
00:02:35,361 --> 00:02:40,361
but so precise to change the u s k 
here's what you tried to get tacked onto

56
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:42,800
this reform bill.
Yeah.

57
00:02:43,220 --> 00:02:48,220
Public law 100 dash 89 is amended by 
striking section two oh seven Perrin one

58
00:02:50,091 --> 00:02:55,091
o one step period six six eight comma 
six seven to close parenth right now.

59
00:02:56,151 --> 00:02:57,440
Isn't that obvious what that means?

60
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:59,170
Ah,
so that's,

61
00:02:59,380 --> 00:03:00,100
you tried

62
00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:01,420
to get inserted.
Yes.

63
00:03:01,570 --> 00:03:03,520
And that was going to provide for 
casino?

64
00:03:03,580 --> 00:03:04,413
Yes,
and who on earth is going to know that 

65
00:03:06,460 --> 00:03:07,293
no one except the chairman of the 
committees and it was deliberately 

66
00:03:09,551 --> 00:03:11,050
written like that.
Precisely.

67
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:12,900
Precisely.

68
00:03:13,030 --> 00:03:16,720
That's what's so interesting about this.
The word choice is precise.

69
00:03:16,750 --> 00:03:17,583
The meaning intentionally vague.
Sometimes pages of documents are 

70
00:03:20,501 --> 00:03:23,860
dedicated to hiding one message within 
the white noise of platitudes.

71
00:03:24,190 --> 00:03:25,023
That's the old,
you didn't read the fine print trope in 

72
00:03:26,681 --> 00:03:29,650
movies like the social network and it's 
how people get Zuckerberg.

73
00:03:30,250 --> 00:03:31,083
Interestingly,
the noise of corporate jargon is 

74
00:03:32,651 --> 00:03:33,484
measurable.
In 1946 a man named Dr Rudolph Flesch 

75
00:03:36,041 --> 00:03:39,070
designed a formula to calculate how 
easily understood something is.

76
00:03:39,250 --> 00:03:40,990
It's called the flesch readability 
score.

77
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:43,480
The higher the score,
the easier to read and comprehend.

78
00:03:43,510 --> 00:03:45,280
The lower the score,
the more difficult it is.

79
00:03:45,490 --> 00:03:46,323
Just a few landmarks to think about.
Newspaper Comic scored at 93 sports 

80
00:03:48,971 --> 00:03:53,590
illustrated at 63 the Wall Street 
Journal 43 and the irs tax code.

81
00:03:53,591 --> 00:03:54,424
The holy book of confusing corporate 
jargon comes in at an impressive 

82
00:03:56,771 --> 00:03:58,660
negative six.
Now.

83
00:03:58,690 --> 00:03:59,523
Obviously there are complex ideas that 
can never be expressed within 90 plus 

84
00:04:02,171 --> 00:04:03,004
readability score,
but most complex ideas can be expressed 

85
00:04:05,471 --> 00:04:06,304
in the 30 to 50 range,
which is considered to be difficult 

86
00:04:08,141 --> 00:04:08,974
reading below 30 the flesh formula 
considers the document to be very 

87
00:04:12,041 --> 00:04:12,874
confusing.

88
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:15,460
Now let's get back to corruption in the 
book.

89
00:04:15,461 --> 00:04:16,294
Why business people speak like idiots.
The authors use this flesch readability 

90
00:04:19,181 --> 00:04:23,260
test to analyze the shareholder letters 
from ceos at the turn of the century.

91
00:04:23,650 --> 00:04:24,483
They analyze a set of well respected 
companies and a set of companies that 

92
00:04:26,951 --> 00:04:29,590
have been riddled with scandal.
As it turns out,

93
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:33,460
the admired companies all have letters 
in the 40 range of readability.

94
00:04:33,610 --> 00:04:34,443
While the companies that had scandals 
all had much more confusing letters 

95
00:04:36,941 --> 00:04:37,774
coming in at the 20s and below,
and that's because the companies were 

96
00:04:39,921 --> 00:04:40,754
scandals have every incentive to be very
confusing and used vague jargon to do 

97
00:04:44,411 --> 00:04:45,244
it.
While a company that has legitimate 

98
00:04:46,421 --> 00:04:49,150
business practices has every reason to 
be forthcoming,

99
00:04:49,510 --> 00:04:50,080
okay.
Now,

100
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:53,560
obviously not all confusing jargon is 
meant to hide corruption,

101
00:04:53,860 --> 00:04:54,693
but when there is corruption to hide 
corporate language is a great way to do 

102
00:04:57,401 --> 00:04:58,234
it.
You can say a lot without saying 

103
00:04:59,081 --> 00:05:02,110
anything at all or say everything while 
making it sound like nothing.

104
00:05:02,290 --> 00:05:03,123
So let's stop circumventing the normally
understood value added lexicon with 

105
00:05:06,431 --> 00:05:09,190
derivative proxies and instead talk 
normal.

106
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:13,170
By the way,
if you're interested,

107
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:14,033
there's a political movement called the 
plain language movement who have voiced 

108
00:05:16,411 --> 00:05:18,270
a lot of the concerns that you heard in 
this video.

109
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:20,630
You can check out their website in the 
description below.

110
00:05:21,970 --> 00:05:24,130
Oh.
