1
00:00:01,390 --> 00:00:03,520
Wall Street is Las Vegas for smart 
people.

2
00:00:03,580 --> 00:00:04,413
It's where you take your money if you 
want to have the odds on your side and 

3
00:00:06,851 --> 00:00:07,684
like Las Vegas,
it's full of people who think they have 

4
00:00:09,371 --> 00:00:11,680
the winning system to get even further 
ahead.

5
00:00:12,100 --> 00:00:13,540
Hedge funds,
value investors,

6
00:00:13,541 --> 00:00:18,130
your uncle who assured that they connect
is the next big thing and especially Jim

7
00:00:18,130 --> 00:00:18,963
Kramer,
they're all trying to outsmart everyone 

8
00:00:20,231 --> 00:00:21,064
else and this makes sense.
The legend and mystique around Wall 

9
00:00:23,651 --> 00:00:24,484
Street is that if you're clever enough 
you can be like mitis ensuring 

10
00:00:27,820 --> 00:00:28,653
everything you touch will become gold 
and there's a clip from the movie 

11
00:00:31,871 --> 00:00:35,770
limitless that perfectly encapsulates 
this allure of Wall Street.

12
00:00:36,090 --> 00:00:36,923
Super Intelligent guy gets on Wall 
Street and from nothing makes millions 

13
00:00:39,521 --> 00:00:41,500
because he just sees things.
The others don't.

14
00:00:41,710 --> 00:00:42,543
He outsmarts them.
My new friend Kevin Dileo showed me how 

15
00:00:45,281 --> 00:00:48,150
you could leverage two and a half times 
your cash at the day training.

16
00:00:49,980 --> 00:00:50,813
Why are you buying that?
The CEO was just indicted but not for 

17
00:00:53,201 --> 00:00:55,820
the big fat defense contract.
He bribed his way into that.

18
00:00:55,821 --> 00:00:57,880
Still on.
It should be announced next week.

19
00:00:59,140 --> 00:00:59,973
At the end of the week,
my brokerage account contained over $2 

20
00:01:02,350 --> 00:01:03,760
million.
Now,

21
00:01:03,850 --> 00:01:06,760
of course you have to take out the 
exaggerated Hollywood elements,

22
00:01:07,180 --> 00:01:10,180
but for many people,
this is the sexy side of Wall Street.

23
00:01:10,810 --> 00:01:14,590
Bring me your poor masses and if you're 
smart will make you rich.

24
00:01:15,010 --> 00:01:17,320
And many people believe that story and 
chase,

25
00:01:17,321 --> 00:01:18,154
it's promise.
But there was an idea that challenge 

26
00:01:19,991 --> 00:01:20,824
that narrative that radically suggested 
that it may be impossible to improve 

27
00:01:24,071 --> 00:01:27,520
your odds beyond the average.
Even brilliant money managers,

28
00:01:27,550 --> 00:01:28,383
hedge funds,
and the best investors may be no better 

29
00:01:30,581 --> 00:01:34,840
than monkeys at picking stocks.
Number one rule of Wall Street.

30
00:01:36,190 --> 00:01:38,910
Nobody,
okay if you're Warren Buffet,

31
00:01:38,940 --> 00:01:39,773
if you cheer me,
but nobody knows if a stock is going to 

32
00:01:42,161 --> 00:01:43,120
go up,
down,

33
00:01:43,121 --> 00:01:44,650
sideways,
or in fucking circles,

34
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:46,200
at least of all stock brokers.

35
00:01:47,050 --> 00:01:50,230
But before we get to monkeys,
let's first talk about the big question,

36
00:01:50,650 --> 00:01:51,483
the question.
Some of the greatest minds in the world 

37
00:01:52,811 --> 00:01:56,530
have spent their lives trying to answer 
the one that would make you rich.

38
00:01:57,070 --> 00:01:59,530
What will the price of a stock b 
tomorrow?

39
00:02:00,870 --> 00:02:01,703
And the answers to this question are as 
numerous as you might expect for an 

40
00:02:04,331 --> 00:02:07,150
alchemy recipe.
There is fundamental analysis,

41
00:02:07,151 --> 00:02:08,980
technical analysis,
buying hold,

42
00:02:08,981 --> 00:02:10,360
value,
invest in growth investing.

43
00:02:10,690 --> 00:02:11,523
I could go on pretty much forever.
And the point is at this time it was 

44
00:02:15,131 --> 00:02:15,964
thought that if you had money,
you needed to find a genius on Wall 

45
00:02:18,341 --> 00:02:19,174
Street to invest that money for you.
Someone who through some secret 

46
00:02:21,761 --> 00:02:22,594
strategy,
manage your wealth in exchange for a 

47
00:02:24,161 --> 00:02:24,994
fee.
The idea was that their expertise would 

48
00:02:26,621 --> 00:02:30,100
get you returns in your money that would
more than pay for their secret formula,

49
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:31,473
and this is how you made the big bucks 
if you're on Wall Street managing 

50
00:02:34,001 --> 00:02:35,920
people's money and charging a fee for 
it.

51
00:02:39,850 --> 00:02:40,683
Okay?

52
00:02:41,020 --> 00:02:41,853
And amidst these competing views of the 
stock market and wealthy wealth 

53
00:02:44,051 --> 00:02:46,210
managers,
along comes an American economist,

54
00:02:46,270 --> 00:02:47,103
Burton Malkiel,
who looks at the market and essentially 

55
00:02:49,061 --> 00:02:52,450
throws a monkey wrench at the 
traditional theories in his book,

56
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:54,130
a random walk down Wall Street.
He says,

57
00:02:54,310 --> 00:02:55,600
no,
you're all wrong.

58
00:02:56,050 --> 00:02:58,990
The stock market can't be consistently 
predicted by any theory.

59
00:02:59,380 --> 00:03:01,810
The only predictable thing we have about
the market is it.

60
00:03:01,811 --> 00:03:04,060
The whole thing tends to increase over 
time.

61
00:03:04,630 --> 00:03:05,463
No one is able to consistently pick 
winners over anyone else and boldest of 

62
00:03:08,891 --> 00:03:09,724
all,
he predicted a blindfolded monkey 

63
00:03:11,351 --> 00:03:12,184
throwing darts at newspaper's financial 
pages could select a portfolio that 

64
00:03:15,611 --> 00:03:19,270
would do just as well as one carefully 
selected by experts.

65
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:22,330
If this is true Malka,
it goes on to say,

66
00:03:22,630 --> 00:03:23,463
instead of paying big bucks to Wall 
Street to let experts manage your 

67
00:03:25,391 --> 00:03:26,224
wealth,
the best thing to do is to find a 

68
00:03:27,581 --> 00:03:28,414
minimum fee fund that buys up hundreds 
of stocks without discrimination for 

69
00:03:31,571 --> 00:03:32,404
winners and losers and just holds them 
passively because the future of a stock 

70
00:03:35,891 --> 00:03:36,724
is fundamentally unknowable anyways,
because if your average return is the 

71
00:03:40,301 --> 00:03:43,510
same for both strategies,
expert management and monkey management,

72
00:03:43,810 --> 00:03:44,643
why would anyone pay for the experts 
into the index fund of the early 

73
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:52,540
seventies exactly the kind of low fi 
fund that now kale proposes.

74
00:03:53,170 --> 00:03:54,880
You buy it,
pay a tiny maintenance fee,

75
00:03:54,910 --> 00:03:56,920
and it just buys and holds hundreds of 
stocks.

76
00:03:57,220 --> 00:03:58,053
Now,
if you're one of those expert investors 

77
00:03:59,380 --> 00:04:02,320
and index funds seems both silly and 
insulting.

78
00:04:03,130 --> 00:04:05,260
Random stocks,
no technical analysis,

79
00:04:05,261 --> 00:04:07,720
no psychological analysis,
no chart analysis.

80
00:04:08,140 --> 00:04:11,200
This was a challenge to the very ethos 
of Wall Street,

81
00:04:11,230 --> 00:04:16,230
a challenge to the idea of the midas 
investor and over the next decades,

82
00:04:16,300 --> 00:04:17,133
the battle between expert funds and 
monkey funds raged on and after almost 

83
00:04:21,281 --> 00:04:22,114
50 years of data,
the results are in and it's 

84
00:04:24,220 --> 00:04:27,700
overwhelming.
You can find hundreds of studies on this

85
00:04:27,701 --> 00:04:28,534
because this is one of the most 
surprising and over analyze things and 

86
00:04:30,611 --> 00:04:32,710
finance.
But here are the headlines.

87
00:04:33,070 --> 00:04:38,020
Over the last 15 years,
index funds outperformed 90% of actively

88
00:04:38,021 --> 00:04:40,540
managed funds when you account for their
fees.

89
00:04:40,990 --> 00:04:41,823
Let me repeat that.
90% not 50% 90% of the smartest people 

90
00:04:45,881 --> 00:04:50,881
on Wall Street made less money than 
monkeys and the 10% well,

91
00:04:51,010 --> 00:04:53,950
given the averages,
it starts looking a lot like luck rather

92
00:04:53,951 --> 00:04:56,650
than skill.
After all given enough investors,

93
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:57,513
it's self evident that someone will gain
above average returns just by sheer 

94
00:05:00,191 --> 00:05:01,024
luck.
And we also have a study that even the 

95
00:05:02,861 --> 00:05:05,470
funds that do beat the index fund one 
three,

96
00:05:05,471 --> 00:05:09,820
five years struggled to continue that 
positive performance and the number that

97
00:05:09,821 --> 00:05:10,654
do continue that positive performance 
year over year is about the number that 

98
00:05:13,541 --> 00:05:14,374
we'd expect from blind chance.
Just because you won 15 coin flips in a 

99
00:05:17,831 --> 00:05:20,710
row doesn't mean you're any more likely 
to win the next one.

100
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:26,650
Let's talk about why the future of the 
stock market can't be predicted.

101
00:05:26,980 --> 00:05:31,780
This is a long theorized idea called the
efficient market hypothesis and even for

102
00:05:31,781 --> 00:05:33,610
the people who don't subscribe to that 
idea,

103
00:05:33,790 --> 00:05:36,070
there's another confounding problem at 
work here.

104
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:40,300
It's a game theory problem.
It's a situation where there are so many

105
00:05:40,301 --> 00:05:41,134
rational actors in the system that the 
market cannot be reasonably predicted 

106
00:05:44,770 --> 00:05:48,010
because each time someone gets a winning
method of valuing stocks,

107
00:05:48,220 --> 00:05:49,053
the next person will find a way to 
incorporate that strategy into a new 

108
00:05:51,941 --> 00:05:54,820
strategy to be the first strategy.
In other words,

109
00:05:54,850 --> 00:05:55,683
everyone's strategy must take into 
account other investing strategies into 

110
00:05:58,641 --> 00:06:00,710
their formula for how the market will 
swing,

111
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:01,873
but it's self referential because the 
other rational actors will feasibly be 

112
00:06:04,761 --> 00:06:07,970
trying to incorporate your strategy into
their investing strategy.

113
00:06:08,270 --> 00:06:10,040
And this is kind of where it all breaks 
down.

114
00:06:10,220 --> 00:06:11,053
It's an ever evolving game that you'll 
never win it long enough to beat the 

115
00:06:13,521 --> 00:06:16,910
market average.
So while occasionally there are exploits

116
00:06:16,911 --> 00:06:17,744
in the market,
they rarely lasts for long and they 

117
00:06:19,620 --> 00:06:20,453
almost always found by different people.
Even Warren Buffett who is on the very 

118
00:06:24,351 --> 00:06:25,184
short list of people you might argue has
consistently beating the stock market 

119
00:06:28,010 --> 00:06:31,790
when asked what to invest in,
doesn't bother naming his own company or

120
00:06:31,791 --> 00:06:32,624
any other.
Instead he has a simple answer that 

121
00:06:34,611 --> 00:06:35,444
would make Malka smile.
He recommends you go get some index 

122
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:41,720
funds.
It turns out that predicting winners and

123
00:06:41,721 --> 00:06:44,210
losers is impractical over long periods 
of time.

124
00:06:44,570 --> 00:06:47,810
There's no such thing as a consistently 
winning strategy over the long haul.

125
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:51,380
It's much more like gambling where the 
house odds are on your side,

126
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:53,600
you're going to win some and you're 
going to lose them.

127
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:56,720
And you can't predict which,
but if you stay around long enough,

128
00:06:56,900 --> 00:06:57,733
you'll win more than you lose.
Really the only thing you shouldn't do 

129
00:07:00,260 --> 00:07:03,650
is pay someone to come up with fancy 
models and strategies for something that

130
00:07:03,651 --> 00:07:06,740
ultimately comes to chance.
Just go and get some money.

131
00:07:06,770 --> 00:07:07,603
Peace.

132
00:07:18,310 --> 00:07:19,510
Hey,
thanks for watching the video.

133
00:07:20,140 --> 00:07:20,973
This is a huge topic.
So there are things that I didn't get 

134
00:07:22,661 --> 00:07:23,350
to.
Uh,

135
00:07:23,350 --> 00:07:26,080
automatic tax loss harvesting robot 
investors,

136
00:07:26,081 --> 00:07:29,230
which have brought down the cost of 
active management significantly.

137
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:30,513
Smart Beta etfs,
which Malka El himself is a fan of tons 

138
00:07:33,131 --> 00:07:37,570
of stuff that was a little bit outside 
the scope of this video for time's sake,

139
00:07:37,630 --> 00:07:38,463
but I left links below.
So if you're interested in sinking your 

140
00:07:40,601 --> 00:07:43,060
teeth a little more into this topic,
you can do soca.

141
00:07:43,061 --> 00:07:43,894
So go check that out.
Also we're going to be having a 

142
00:07:45,311 --> 00:07:46,144
discussion on the reddits,
so if you want to talk about this a 

143
00:07:49,151 --> 00:07:51,190
little more in detail and interact with 
me,

144
00:07:51,690 --> 00:07:52,660
uh,
go there,

145
00:07:52,870 --> 00:07:56,590
artists to the music as always are 
linked and I will see you guys next time

146
00:07:56,591 --> 00:07:58,810
we got,
we've got a fun one coming up next time,

147
00:07:58,811 --> 00:07:59,644
so keep your eye out for that.
Should be about a week or two out in 

148
