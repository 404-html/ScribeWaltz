1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:00,893
I like to exercise,
but the time it takes up in my day 

2
00:00:02,221 --> 00:00:03,930
bothers me.
The time I spend running,

3
00:00:03,931 --> 00:00:06,230
I could be doing anything else on one of
these days.

4
00:00:06,250 --> 00:00:08,460
A thought occurred to me,
putting aside for a moment,

5
00:00:08,461 --> 00:00:11,010
the ancillary benefits of exercise,
like energy,

6
00:00:11,011 --> 00:00:12,000
physique,
mental clarity,

7
00:00:12,001 --> 00:00:12,834
et cetera.
Do the life length and benefits you get 

8
00:00:14,251 --> 00:00:16,980
from exercising outweigh the time you 
spend doing it?

9
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:18,960
Well,
let's find out.

10
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:20,093
So according to a study in 2012 
published in the peer reviewed BMJ that 

11
00:00:23,671 --> 00:00:26,220
included over 650,000
participants,

12
00:00:26,490 --> 00:00:28,110
moderate exercise,
like briskly walking,

13
00:00:28,111 --> 00:00:29,070
cycling,
etc.

14
00:00:29,071 --> 00:00:30,570
For 2.5
hours per week,

15
00:00:30,571 --> 00:00:33,300
we'll add on average 3.4
to 4.5

16
00:00:33,330 --> 00:00:36,090
years to your life.
But how many hours is that?

17
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:38,040
If you live 3.4
years longer,

18
00:00:38,041 --> 00:00:39,540
which is the low end of what we'd 
expect,

19
00:00:39,810 --> 00:00:42,090
that means that you've gained 30,000
hours.

20
00:00:42,630 --> 00:00:46,230
But not all of that is productive time 
because you have to sleep accounting for

21
00:00:46,231 --> 00:00:46,560
that.

22
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:47,393
You've gained 20,000
but you have to spend time to get this 

23
00:00:49,591 --> 00:00:50,424
reward.
So let's say you work out for your 

24
00:00:51,661 --> 00:00:55,020
entire adult life starting at 20 years 
old and he lived to be 80 so you've been

25
00:00:55,021 --> 00:00:57,990
working out 2.5
hours per week for 60 years.

26
00:00:58,350 --> 00:01:01,140
That comes out to a total cost of 7,800
hours.

27
00:01:01,860 --> 00:01:03,510
So what does this mean?
Well,

28
00:01:03,810 --> 00:01:06,270
it means the way we think about 
exercising is wrong.

29
00:01:06,510 --> 00:01:07,343
You weren't spending time exercising.
You're actually creating time for every 

30
00:01:11,610 --> 00:01:14,250
hour you spend exercising.
You'll get 2.5

31
00:01:14,251 --> 00:01:15,084
hours on the back end of your life.
So don't feel bad going to the gym or 

32
00:01:18,151 --> 00:01:18,984
stealing a few minutes for a walk.
Not only will you get that hour back to 

33
00:01:21,871 --> 00:01:22,704
spend at the office,
but you're also going to get extra time 

34
00:01:24,271 --> 00:01:26,070
to spend with friends and family.
Now,

35
00:01:26,071 --> 00:01:28,020
obviously this isn't the secret to 
eternal youth.

36
00:01:28,021 --> 00:01:28,854
There are diminishing returns on this,
so don't run down the street thinking 

37
00:01:30,931 --> 00:01:33,840
that you've cheated death.
But let's say that you're one of the 80%

38
00:01:33,841 --> 00:01:35,520
of Americans,
80% of British,

39
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:36,473
60% of Australian adults or anyone in 
the developed world who doesn't get to 

40
00:01:40,111 --> 00:01:40,944
wait five hours of exercise a week.
It's not that you don't have time to 

41
00:01:43,921 --> 00:01:45,810
exercise.
Actually the reverse is true.

42
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:47,310
You can't afford not to.

43
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:51,193
Okay.
