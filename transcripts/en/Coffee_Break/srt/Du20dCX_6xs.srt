1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:03,120
Let me tell you a secret.
Wars are being fought for your attention

2
00:00:03,210 --> 00:00:06,090
and today we're going to be looking at 
the new war that's been going on as well

3
00:00:06,091 --> 00:00:08,610
as looking back to see what we can learn
from past wars.

4
00:00:08,670 --> 00:00:12,510
The new battlefield is on youtube and it
involves one really annoying tactic.

5
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:17,730
Morning Guys,
how's her?

6
00:00:17,740 --> 00:00:18,910
When do I pick the kids?

7
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:28,200
[inaudible]

8
00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:36,930
welcome to the excitement.
Wars were fake excitement and hype draws

9
00:00:36,931 --> 00:00:39,240
in more viewers and gets people to watch
longer.

10
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:42,240
If you want to be a part of this,
you have to get excited,

11
00:00:42,270 --> 00:00:44,010
like really excited.
In fact,

12
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:46,800
if they think you're going to have a 
seizure or a heart attack,

13
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:49,680
pets about the right level,
but even though that will keep views,

14
00:00:49,710 --> 00:00:51,810
I don't think fake excitement is a good 
thing.

15
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:53,273
It eventually makes excitement and hype 
on Youtube meaningless because everyone 

16
00:00:55,371 --> 00:00:56,204
is overusing it,
but I'm not going to hate on any 

17
00:00:57,541 --> 00:00:58,374
individual.
They're just playing the system 

18
00:00:59,221 --> 00:01:00,054
exploiting a weakness in our attention.
I just wanted to talk about the 

19
00:01:01,921 --> 00:01:05,130
potential effects and what we can do 
about it because believe it or not,

20
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:07,410
we've already seen this warp play out 
before,

21
00:01:07,770 --> 00:01:10,220
twice.
Both of them bear a striking resemblance

22
00:01:10,250 --> 00:01:11,083
to the excitement of wars and I think we
can examine them to learn lessons about 

23
00:01:13,531 --> 00:01:14,550
our own wars today.

24
00:01:14,940 --> 00:01:16,410
Have you ever heard of the loudness 
wars?

25
00:01:16,950 --> 00:01:17,783
It started in the 1940s when sound 
engineers began to realize that louder 

26
00:01:20,251 --> 00:01:21,084
music stands out on Juke boxes,
so they began telling the record labels 

27
00:01:23,401 --> 00:01:24,234
to record louder so people started 
overusing compressors to artificially 

28
00:01:26,641 --> 00:01:29,340
raise the volume of their whole song to 
be as loud as possible.

29
00:01:30,030 --> 00:01:30,863
And the reason raising the volume 
artificially matters is because it 

30
00:01:32,881 --> 00:01:35,340
destroys something called dynamic range.
Basically.

31
00:01:35,341 --> 00:01:36,174
That's the difference between the 
quietest and loudest part of a song and 

32
00:01:37,981 --> 00:01:40,800
it's hugely responsible for conveying 
emotion and tone.

33
00:01:40,890 --> 00:01:43,440
The problem with the loudness wars is,
as Matt may feel,

34
00:01:43,441 --> 00:01:46,560
puts it when there's no quiet,
there can be no loud.

35
00:01:47,490 --> 00:01:48,323
The first few seconds of Beethoven's 
fifth symphony illustrates this really 

36
00:01:50,701 --> 00:01:51,534
well.
Pay Close attention to the volume and 

37
00:01:53,041 --> 00:01:54,630
how it affects the tone of the piece.

38
00:02:11,270 --> 00:02:12,103
The reason you can really feel those 
loud moments is because of the quiet 

39
00:02:14,841 --> 00:02:15,674
ones right before it,
and we can see these peaks and valleys 

40
00:02:17,421 --> 00:02:20,090
of intensity in the visual way form of a
song.

41
00:02:20,330 --> 00:02:21,163
Here's the song.
Before that loudness wars really 

42
00:02:22,101 --> 00:02:25,070
escalated and here's a way form during 
the loudness wars,

43
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:27,620
simultaneously as the loudness wars were
going on,

44
00:02:27,650 --> 00:02:29,660
there was a similar war going on in the 
media,

45
00:02:30,020 --> 00:02:30,853
a wharf sensationalism with Fox News 
being one of the first 24 hour news 

46
00:02:33,771 --> 00:02:37,190
networks founded in 1996 people soon 
became aware that sensationalist,

47
00:02:37,191 --> 00:02:40,430
even partisan show's got a lot more 
views than moderate even handed ones.

48
00:02:40,700 --> 00:02:41,533
Because of this,
several similar news programs were 

49
00:02:42,741 --> 00:02:43,574
created on the other side of the aisle.
Both sides vying for the attention of 

50
00:02:45,651 --> 00:02:46,484
the television viewer.
This escalation in sensationalism 

51
00:02:49,131 --> 00:02:50,930
resulted in news clips like this.

52
00:02:51,170 --> 00:02:54,050
This does this offend you,
this word.

53
00:02:54,110 --> 00:02:56,990
A lot of people are shocked.
A massive gas line.

54
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,010
Rutgers,
could it happen in your neighborhood?

55
00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:00,933
Marijuana,
could it be in your neighborhood and is 

56
00:03:02,531 --> 00:03:03,364
America ready?
Is the u s next is America dangerously 

57
00:03:06,130 --> 00:03:08,830
under four pair.
The flip flop is the new sneaker,

58
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:11,860
but behind the Sandal nursing,
serious danger,

59
00:03:11,890 --> 00:03:15,250
not only lack of sleep,
it can kill you it sleeping too much

60
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:16,513
and no one critique the dangers of this 
hyper sensationalism better than John 

61
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:20,460
Stewart.

62
00:03:20,460 --> 00:03:25,460
If we amplify everything we hear 
nothing.

63
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:27,633
Okay,

64
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:30,633
sounds a little bit like matt may film.
He echoes this thought later in an 

65
00:03:33,311 --> 00:03:34,070
interview.

66
00:03:34,070 --> 00:03:36,590
Now the problem is how do you keep 
people watching it?

67
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:37,633
Oh,
Jay's not going to kill someone every 

68
00:03:38,300 --> 00:03:39,830
day,
so that's gone.

69
00:03:40,250 --> 00:03:41,083
So what do you have to do?
You have to elevate the passion of 

70
00:03:43,401 --> 00:03:44,234
everything else that happens that might 
even be somewhat mundane and elevate it 

71
00:03:47,811 --> 00:03:50,000
to the extent that this is breaking 
news.

72
00:03:50,180 --> 00:03:55,180
The aggregate effect of that is that you
begin to lose the lexicon.

73
00:03:56,270 --> 00:04:01,270
You begin to lose any meaning of what 
breaking news means or urgent or look at

74
00:04:01,851 --> 00:04:03,410
this or dangerous.
You know,

75
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:07,790
this is a an arms race.
The language then has to become sharper,

76
00:04:08,210 --> 00:04:11,420
louder to cut through more and more of 
the noise.

77
00:04:12,290 --> 00:04:17,290
And when I'm saying is maybe there is a 
way to not engage in the idea,

78
00:04:21,110 --> 00:04:22,640
not to accept the premise

79
00:04:22,970 --> 00:04:23,803
Jon Stewart's mind.
The news had become an arms race to 

80
00:04:25,191 --> 00:04:27,530
become more sensationalist,
fantastic from the rest,

81
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:30,500
but it resulted in a loss of fidelity of
what is important,

82
00:04:30,830 --> 00:04:31,663
just like the loudness wars,
but sensationalists wars were 

83
00:04:33,171 --> 00:04:34,004
obliterating the crescendos of real life
news by amplifying everything into 

84
00:04:37,581 --> 00:04:38,414
meaninglessness.
And now we come back to the excitement 

85
00:04:40,581 --> 00:04:41,414
wars.
All of these guys are emotional actors 

86
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:47,000
playing to what they know that we want,
but just like in media and news,

87
00:04:47,001 --> 00:04:47,834
it's getting to the point where we can 
no longer distinguish what is actually 

88
00:04:49,641 --> 00:04:53,240
fun and exciting because people play 
everything up as if it were so exciting.

89
00:04:53,810 --> 00:04:55,760
But maybe we don't have to accept the 
premise.

90
00:04:56,270 --> 00:04:59,600
Here's something to remember.
These wars eventually get played out.

91
00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:02,330
People get sick of the escalation and 
insanity of it.

92
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:03,433
And we can see these effects happening 
in the loudness wars where we've seen a 

93
00:05:05,361 --> 00:05:06,194
reduction in over compression since 2005
we've also seen a similar reaction into 

94
00:05:09,620 --> 00:05:10,453
sensationalist wars with the rise in 
popularity of websites like politifact 

95
00:05:13,130 --> 00:05:13,963
fact check and all sides that seek to 
lessen the sensationalism in politics 

96
00:05:17,481 --> 00:05:20,540
and seek unbiased.
We will never be rid of people trying to

97
00:05:20,541 --> 00:05:21,374
exploit our biases,
whether it be towards volume 

98
00:05:22,741 --> 00:05:23,574
sensationalism or excitement.
But thankfully we can vote with our 

99
00:05:26,031 --> 00:05:28,310
views to not pay attention to those 
people.

100
00:05:28,550 --> 00:05:31,670
These wars are going to keep going,
but we don't have to be a part of it.

101
00:05:33,970 --> 00:05:34,803
No.

102
00:05:41,940 --> 00:05:43,440
Hey,
thanks for watching that video.

103
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:45,060
Uh,
we just hit 10,000

104
00:05:45,061 --> 00:05:47,430
subscribers on this channel,
which is completely amazing.

105
00:05:47,431 --> 00:05:48,264
I never thought it would be there and 
thanks so much to those of you who have 

106
00:05:50,611 --> 00:05:53,220
been sharing my videos,
liking and commenting on them,

107
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:56,520
that just means so much to the channel 
and really helps my channel grow.

108
00:05:56,880 --> 00:06:01,010
I try not to use clickbait or too much 
like kind of tricks.

109
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:04,370
So I really rely on you guys to get the 
word out there kind of organically.

110
00:06:04,580 --> 00:06:05,413
So thank you so much to those of you who
have done it and are going to continue 

111
00:06:07,431 --> 00:06:08,900
to do that.
And uh,

112
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:10,610
yeah,
I hope you enjoyed that video.

113
00:06:10,611 --> 00:06:11,810
Let me know what you want to see next.
