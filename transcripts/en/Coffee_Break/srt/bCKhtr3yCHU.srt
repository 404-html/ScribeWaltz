00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:03,960
Apple has an advertising style that's as
iconic as it is copied the Internet,

2
00:00:03,961 --> 00:00:06,480
is full of parodies and lookalikes from 
competitors,

3
00:00:06,660 --> 00:00:10,050
yet somehow the magic in apple's 
commercials isn't spoiled even though we

4
00:00:10,051 --> 00:00:12,630
know the formula,
it never ceases to blow our minds to see

5
00:00:12,631 --> 00:00:14,160
the newest iphone commercial come out.

6
00:00:14,670 --> 00:00:16,910
Why?
What makes apple special?

7
00:00:17,590 --> 00:00:20,090
A big reason is thanks to the guidance 
of Mike Markkula.

8
00:00:20,570 --> 00:00:21,403
He was an early investor in apple and 
was the vice president of marketing in 

9
00:00:23,841 --> 00:00:26,330
1977 when apple was first getting off 
the ground.

10
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:27,193
Marcola wrote a three point marketing 
philosophy that has been in the 

11
00:00:29,061 --> 00:00:31,700
forefront of the company ever since.
Apple's marketing focus.

12
00:00:31,701 --> 00:00:33,230
He says,
should be empathy,

13
00:00:33,470 --> 00:00:34,303
focus and impute with empathy.
Apple strive to connect with customers 

14
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:40,880
feelings while other talk about detailed
specs and processor power.

15
00:00:41,150 --> 00:00:41,983
Apple talks a lot about battery life,
the way it feels in your hands and the 

16
00:00:44,451 --> 00:00:45,284
way it will connect you with others.
Focus focused on accomplishing the main 

17
00:00:49,311 --> 00:00:51,530
goals and eliminate unimportant 
opportunities.

18
00:00:51,980 --> 00:00:54,890
While other companies make a million 
different variations of their products.

19
00:00:55,130 --> 00:00:58,280
Apple only makes a few.
When Steve Jobs came back to apple,

20
00:00:58,430 --> 00:00:59,263
he cut down their number of product 
lines from several dozen to four by 

21
00:01:02,421 --> 00:01:03,254
refocusing apple on a few products,
they were able to create a superior 

22
00:01:05,391 --> 00:01:06,224
experience.

23
00:01:06,830 --> 00:01:07,663
Impute.
This is possibly the most important 

24
00:01:08,931 --> 00:01:10,910
principle of Margolis marketing 
manifesto.

25
00:01:11,630 --> 00:01:14,300
Mark Road.
People do judge a book by its cover.

26
00:01:14,660 --> 00:01:17,030
You may have the best products,
but if you present them poorly,

27
00:01:17,270 --> 00:01:18,103
it will be perceived.
If you present them in a creative 

28
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:23,360
professional manner,
you will impute the desired qualities.

29
00:01:23,750 --> 00:01:26,030
In other words,
the way an iphone ad is presented is the

30
00:01:26,031 --> 00:01:29,510
way that the iphone will be perceived 
and that seems obvious,

31
00:01:29,511 --> 00:01:31,670
but this means that even the colors of 
the ad,

32
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:35,420
whether the space is cluttered or clean,
the tone of voice of the narrator,

33
00:01:35,570 --> 00:01:38,600
he animations control the way the iphone
is viewed.

34
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:39,673
Even though all of these have nothing to
do with actual performance and this can 

35
00:01:43,941 --> 00:01:46,700
either hurt or help a company,
which is why mark nature,

36
00:01:46,701 --> 00:01:49,160
apple kept it as a guiding principle to 
their business.

37
00:01:49,430 --> 00:01:50,750
Fast forward,
40 years later,

38
00:01:50,810 --> 00:01:53,240
apple is the master at using this to 
their advantage.

39
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:56,360
If you watch an apple ad,
you can find everything you need to know

40
00:01:56,361 --> 00:01:58,760
from the first few seconds,
even if the audio is muted.

41
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:02,120
Now that we know the three philosophies 
apple uses to advertise,

42
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:03,313
let's talk about the types of 
advertisements apple does in the 

43
00:02:04,941 --> 00:02:05,774
lifecycle of one of their products.
They pretty much fall into three 

44
00:02:07,731 --> 00:02:09,560
categories.
The introduction,

45
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:14,060
this is the first video and it's 
basically a hype video pumped up music,

46
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:16,970
pretty screens everywhere.
Basically just showing off the phone.

47
00:02:20,010 --> 00:02:23,160
Iphone seven makes the things you do 
most even better.

48
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:26,280
It's the best iphone we've ever made.

49
00:02:29,790 --> 00:02:33,150
The specs,
this is the second video they'll make if

50
00:02:33,151 --> 00:02:33,984
they can get johnny ive to do this one.
That's the best point of this video is 

51
00:02:36,961 --> 00:02:39,720
to make people feel like their old 
devices outdated and slow.

52
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:44,460
A ton of talk about redesign and a lot,
a lot of comparative words,

53
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:47,130
and they'll also use pretty sounding,
but ultimately meaningless.

54
00:02:47,131 --> 00:02:49,710
Words like color gamut,
advanced sensors,

55
00:02:49,770 --> 00:02:50,603
and unique.

56
00:02:51,250 --> 00:02:52,083
To put it on a much larger scale,
we designed it's 78 percent more screen 

57
00:02:56,861 --> 00:02:59,080
area,
a greater level of precision.

58
00:02:59,140 --> 00:03:00,010
We completely

59
00:03:00,010 --> 00:03:00,843
re engineered the tuck subsystem,
increasing the sensitivity of the 

60
00:03:04,190 --> 00:03:05,023
sensors,
doubling the touch refresh rate the 

61
00:03:06,971 --> 00:03:08,300
most,
the highest greater risk,

62
00:03:08,340 --> 00:03:09,173
specifically designed for much larger 
display and see more precise multitouch 

63
00:03:13,751 --> 00:03:18,751
technology in entirely new for speaker 
architecture in more an indifferent ways

64
00:03:19,090 --> 00:03:21,910
flexibility,
we've developed a new technology,

65
00:03:22,090 --> 00:03:25,810
more productive,
more creative and entirely new scale.

66
00:03:28,210 --> 00:03:30,490
After the intro inspects,
it's all about narrative.

67
00:03:30,820 --> 00:03:34,090
This is just classic content marketing 
and what is that?

68
00:03:34,180 --> 00:03:35,013
Basically it's when you tell a story 
where your product just so happens to 

69
00:03:37,540 --> 00:03:39,280
facilitate or caused something to 
happen,

70
00:03:39,550 --> 00:03:43,000
but there's no explicit promotion.
Pay attention to this video because it's

71
00:03:43,001 --> 00:03:44,890
the classic case of content marketing.

72
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:55,470
Oh,
you're watching your daughter at a Romeo

73
00:03:55,471 --> 00:03:57,420
and Juliet.
Play in capturing that special moment.

74
00:03:57,750 --> 00:03:59,340
Well,
catch it better with the new iphone.

75
00:04:00,510 --> 00:04:02,400
This is a really good way to sell 
anything.

76
00:04:03,090 --> 00:04:03,923
This phase continues through the rest of
the product life cycle until they 

77
00:04:06,301 --> 00:04:09,690
announced the next device,
at which point we come to distancing.

78
00:04:10,110 --> 00:04:13,230
This really isn't an ad,
but it's necessary for advertising.

79
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:14,753
This is where they wipe all the evidence
and the old advertisements from their 

80
00:04:16,741 --> 00:04:17,574
channel and their webpage.
This is so customers don't get 

81
00:04:19,741 --> 00:04:22,420
distracted when they want to buy a 
refurbished and five,

82
00:04:22,470 --> 00:04:25,530
when the iphone seven is out,
and this is also assuming never realized

83
00:04:25,531 --> 00:04:27,180
they've been saying the same stuff for 
years.

84
00:04:27,420 --> 00:04:29,700
That's pretty much it.
Now you know how apple advertises.

85
00:04:30,510 --> 00:04:31,343
Thanks for watching.
