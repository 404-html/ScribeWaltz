1
00:00:00,660 --> 00:00:03,190
There are 50 slots on the training tab 
and when I last checked,

2
00:00:03,191 --> 00:00:05,380
22 of them were taken up by either a 
movie trailer,

3
00:00:05,381 --> 00:00:06,420
TV,
late night host,

4
00:00:06,430 --> 00:00:07,263
big brand or TV show.
This is ridiculous when you account for 

5
00:00:09,731 --> 00:00:10,564
the fact that youtube only has three 
main tabs to exploit their entire site 

6
00:00:13,690 --> 00:00:16,390
and in one of them about half the 
options or TV related,

7
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:18,820
which means their main product isn't 
even on Youtube.

8
00:00:18,821 --> 00:00:21,670
It's just an advertisement to go watch 
their show or movie.

9
00:00:22,090 --> 00:00:22,923
So in other words,
the trending tab has become a glorified 

10
00:00:25,151 --> 00:00:29,050
TV guide.
This problem isn't new.

11
00:00:29,170 --> 00:00:32,530
Trending has been frustrating you tubers
since 2015 you see,

12
00:00:32,531 --> 00:00:33,364
it all started when youtube released a 
cryptic statement about what kind of 

13
00:00:35,891 --> 00:00:38,320
videos would be featured.
Some trends are predictable,

14
00:00:38,410 --> 00:00:40,960
like a new song from a popular artist or
a new movie trailer.

15
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:43,120
Others are surprising like a viral 
video.

16
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:44,193
We aim to surface videos that a wide 
range of viewers will find interesting 

17
00:00:46,661 --> 00:00:48,280
and novel.
Now this guy,

18
00:00:48,281 --> 00:00:51,790
people excited because it seemed like a 
great way to feature new viral creators,

19
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:54,580
but that's not really what happened in 
the end.

20
00:00:54,610 --> 00:00:55,443
It's led to a stagnant,
predictable system where every day it 

21
00:00:57,161 --> 00:00:57,994
seems like a Mashup of John Oliver meets
buzzfeed glue dominated by videos that 

22
00:01:01,421 --> 00:01:03,370
have lots of marketing resources behind 
them,

23
00:01:03,550 --> 00:01:05,680
whether that be business insider,
the NFL,

24
00:01:05,681 --> 00:01:06,820
snl,
what the hell?

25
00:01:07,090 --> 00:01:09,070
Oh wait,
that's Casey Neistat on trending again.

26
00:01:09,250 --> 00:01:12,910
But he sponsored by CNN so it's okay.
And why is this happening?

27
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:14,193
Is there a conspiracy where youtube 
trying to promote big budget movies or 

28
00:01:16,691 --> 00:01:18,190
TV shows?
I don't think so,

29
00:01:18,191 --> 00:01:20,800
but whenever you rely on an algorithm to
sort things,

30
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:24,370
people are going to find a way to 
exploit an optimize for that algorithm.

31
00:01:24,700 --> 00:01:25,533
When Youtube started the training tab,
they knew they didn't want already big 

32
00:01:27,731 --> 00:01:28,564
youtubers dominating the space everyday 
with their videos to consistently got 

33
00:01:31,001 --> 00:01:32,710
millions of views and that makes sense.

34
00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:35,290
PD Pie on training everyday would get 
super old,

35
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:39,130
but how do you find viral videos when 
you can't use view count as an indicator

36
00:01:39,131 --> 00:01:40,360
of our rally?
Well,

37
00:01:40,361 --> 00:01:41,194
youtube solution was to base who gets on
the training tab on a variety of 

38
00:01:43,331 --> 00:01:44,164
factors.
How vast is the video growing where the 

39
00:01:45,911 --> 00:01:48,160
view is coming from geographically,
but most of all,

40
00:01:48,190 --> 00:01:49,023
where's the traffic being driven from?
This last factor is really important 

41
00:01:52,061 --> 00:01:52,894
because it explains how the Time Warner 
Tab came to be because if your main way 

42
00:01:56,621 --> 00:01:57,454
to push content is through youtube,
you're not considered viral by youtube 

43
00:02:00,431 --> 00:02:01,264
because all your traffic is internal,
but if you're someone like Jimmy Kimmel 

44
00:02:03,641 --> 00:02:06,370
and people love to share your crime 
monologues across twitter,

45
00:02:06,580 --> 00:02:07,413
then your video is going to hit the 
training page because the views from 

46
00:02:09,131 --> 00:02:09,964
twitter account,
it is more valuable because it's coming 

47
00:02:11,111 --> 00:02:13,690
from across platforms.
This is why buzzfeed,

48
00:02:13,691 --> 00:02:14,960
Gopro,
business insider,

49
00:02:14,980 --> 00:02:15,813
big brands hit the trending page so 
often because they have huge marketing 

50
00:02:18,641 --> 00:02:21,160
teams that spread their content across 
all the platforms.

51
00:02:21,310 --> 00:02:24,130
While independent youtube creators tend 
to focus on youtube.

52
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:29,470
I want to talk for a moment why having 
this system this way is a bad thing.

53
00:02:29,860 --> 00:02:30,693
First,
youtube is not great because it houses 

54
00:02:32,381 --> 00:02:35,830
the highlights of TV.
Youtube is great because it isn't tv,

55
00:02:36,100 --> 00:02:36,933
it isn't,
or at least wasn't dominated by big 

56
00:02:38,711 --> 00:02:39,544
corporations.
It was governed by a meritocracy of 

57
00:02:41,110 --> 00:02:42,970
independent creators.
In fact,

58
00:02:42,971 --> 00:02:45,880
the whole reason for you dupes 
popularity is thanks to these people.

59
00:02:46,150 --> 00:02:46,983
So when Youtube makes one of the key 
navigation options of their website 

60
00:02:49,481 --> 00:02:50,314
accessible to a small minority of 
youtubers and to a large majority of 

61
00:02:53,291 --> 00:02:57,280
advertisers in TV influencers,
it seems like a bad move and a step away

62
00:02:57,281 --> 00:02:59,980
from who they are at their core.
And in a weird way,

63
00:03:00,070 --> 00:03:00,903
I'd prefer one of youtube own clickbait 
monsters getting featured over going 

64
00:03:04,001 --> 00:03:04,834
back to the same tv culture ever cycled 
over polished stuff that I could watch 

65
00:03:07,481 --> 00:03:08,314
on the TV.
I no longer pay for it because the 

66
00:03:09,101 --> 00:03:09,934
Internet is better.

67
00:03:10,140 --> 00:03:12,810
How was Nebraska better than North 
Dakota?

68
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:20,860
Hi,
is that Chuck's only funny in Nebraska?

69
00:03:21,990 --> 00:03:26,990
My joke is not funny here.
Wow.

70
00:03:28,310 --> 00:03:30,020
Oh my God,
I really don't believe this.

71
00:03:30,450 --> 00:03:31,283
Second,
it isn't like we don't know where to 

72
00:03:32,251 --> 00:03:34,560
find these brands or TV shows.
If we wanted to watch them,

73
00:03:34,980 --> 00:03:37,860
why shoved them down my throat?
I already know who Seth Meyer is.

74
00:03:38,430 --> 00:03:41,300
Why not show someone who's blowing up on
youtube that I haven't heard of?

75
00:03:42,060 --> 00:03:42,811
I mean,
in a way,

76
00:03:42,811 --> 00:03:43,644
it's kind of ironic.
The trending tab was designed not to 

77
00:03:45,571 --> 00:03:47,970
over promote the already huge channels 
and youtube,

78
00:03:47,971 --> 00:03:51,750
but it ended up doing exactly that only 
instead of promoting their own,

79
00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:52,613
they're over promoting the very media 
structures that they replaced a decade 

80
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:57,300
ago.
And before you say,

81
00:03:57,330 --> 00:03:59,010
okay,
but what about creator on the rise?

82
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:02,010
And that is a start,
but consider this.

83
00:04:02,370 --> 00:04:04,920
There are 2 million people eligible to 
be a creator on the rise,

84
00:04:04,980 --> 00:04:07,290
which means that every day,
if you were dealt a hand of cards,

85
00:04:07,650 --> 00:04:08,483
you draw a royal flush three times 
before you got featured on the creator 

86
00:04:10,861 --> 00:04:11,700
on the rise page.

87
00:04:12,180 --> 00:04:13,013
It's a gesture that looks good,
but it's pretty meaningless now given 

88
00:04:15,661 --> 00:04:18,810
you tube's incredible track record of 
listening to creators,

89
00:04:19,020 --> 00:04:21,120
I don't think this is going to change 
anytime soon.

90
00:04:21,270 --> 00:04:22,103
So it might be worth saying,
if you're a utuber and you ever want a 

91
00:04:24,121 --> 00:04:24,954
shot at hitting the TV guide of Youtube,
you might want to focus on diversifying 

92
00:04:28,051 --> 00:04:31,800
where your views come from because being
successful on youtube isn't enough.

93
00:04:31,801 --> 00:04:34,140
You've got to have a large audience off 
youtube,

94
00:04:34,170 --> 00:04:37,560
which is a lot easier to do when your 
main product isn't youtube.

95
00:04:37,740 --> 00:04:39,990
So in the spirit of that,
if you like this video,

96
00:04:39,991 --> 00:04:43,650
you can help my channel by liking my 
twitter page and my facebook page linked

97
00:04:43,651 --> 00:04:46,410
in the description below and retweet and
share this video.

98
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:49,980
If enough people watch and share this 
video from other social media sites,

99
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:50,993
who knows,
we might just end up on the training 

100
00:04:51,901 --> 00:04:53,430
page,
but probably not.

101
00:04:53,940 --> 00:04:55,980
I need my CNN sponsorship to come in 
first.
