1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:00,953
Viewer discretion is advised.
In part one we learned what the hfs in 

2
00:00:04,321 --> 00:00:08,520
principle is and how social taboos 
affect the profanity of a society.

3
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:09,533
Now I want to dive into American taboos 
and explore how are taboos have changed 

4
00:00:12,691 --> 00:00:15,030
over time and how profanity has 
followed.

5
00:00:15,330 --> 00:00:19,080
Because profanity has drastically 
changed with slurs and words about group

6
00:00:19,081 --> 00:00:22,710
identity quickly becoming the worst 
kinds of profanity of this generation.

7
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:24,113
And we're going to trace this change and
profanity through the lives of 

8
00:00:25,891 --> 00:00:26,724
Comedians,
people who challenged taboos for a 

9
00:00:28,351 --> 00:00:29,184
living.

10
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:43,830
And our story begins in 1961 when lenny 
bruce is arrested for saying cock sucker

11
00:00:43,831 --> 00:00:44,664
on stage.
Now that name may fly over some modern 

12
00:00:46,801 --> 00:00:47,634
heads,
but at the time Lenny Bruce was the 

13
00:00:48,991 --> 00:00:52,470
biggest thing in comedy in rolling 
Stone's best standups of all time.

14
00:00:52,530 --> 00:00:56,310
Bruce is number three on that list and 
if comedy loves being on the edge,

15
00:00:56,370 --> 00:00:58,470
then lenny was the guy dancing off 
cliffs.

16
00:00:58,530 --> 00:00:59,363
His comedy took on every American sacred
cow from race to sexual puritanism and 

17
00:01:03,121 --> 00:01:03,954
he would say anything,
even if it got him arrested and his 

18
00:01:06,511 --> 00:01:07,344
whole life was full of legal issues.
He was in and out of court houses for 

19
00:01:09,931 --> 00:01:10,764
saying the wrong words,
appealing and just dealing with a cold 

20
00:01:13,291 --> 00:01:14,124
legal system and obscenity laws.
All the while he was whittling away 

21
00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:17,933
eventually dying in his home in 1966 
four years before New York's Highest 

22
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:23,820
Appellate Court would vindicate him of 
all charges.

23
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:27,720
One of his prosecutors later said,
we all knew what we were doing.

24
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:28,793
We use the law to kill him.
And this is a pivotal moment because 

25
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:34,770
even though America is prosecuting 
comics for breaking taboos,

26
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:35,873
there was also a shift taking place in 
young people right around the 60s and 

27
00:01:39,361 --> 00:01:42,900
seventies America has the sexual 
revolution and the civil rights movement

28
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:46,650
that totally shake up the value system 
of America and change the taboos.

29
00:01:47,310 --> 00:01:50,130
So 10 years after bruce gets arrested,
another comedian,

30
00:01:50,131 --> 00:01:52,410
George Carlin is coming up,
similar style,

31
00:01:52,411 --> 00:01:53,244
similar anti authoritarian and a similar
fascination with bad words and pushing 

32
00:01:56,731 --> 00:01:59,610
the edge.
But this time the culture has changed,

33
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:02,880
so when Carlin performed seven words,
you can't say on television,

34
00:02:02,881 --> 00:02:05,310
which is loaded with the worst profanity
of the day,

35
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:07,170
it's a huge success.

36
00:02:07,670 --> 00:02:08,503
You know what I mean?
It's just like we've decided there'd be 

37
00:02:09,741 --> 00:02:10,574
somewhere as we won't say all the time 
and I was just trying to find out which 

38
00:02:12,711 --> 00:02:13,544
words they were for sure.
All of them I wanted to list and I 

39
00:02:16,431 --> 00:02:19,670
wanted to know the ones that she could 
never say on television.

40
00:02:19,671 --> 00:02:20,504
I mean the filthy words that are always 
filthy and all I could think of was 

41
00:02:23,751 --> 00:02:24,201
shit,
Piss,

42
00:02:24,201 --> 00:02:25,490
fuck cock cock sucker motherfucker.

43
00:02:27,390 --> 00:02:28,223
He was just as provocative as lenny 
bruce was except time had gone by and 

44
00:02:31,441 --> 00:02:33,840
the taboos of the older generation were 
weakened.

45
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:37,770
The difference between Carlin and Bruce 
was when they did the act.

46
00:02:37,830 --> 00:02:39,780
Carlin mentions this idea in an 
interview.

47
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:44,050
Lenny and I had this language in common 
and he brought,

48
00:02:44,060 --> 00:02:47,270
he was the first one to make language an
issue and he suffered for it.

49
00:02:47,630 --> 00:02:51,230
I was the first one to make a language 
issue and to succeed from it.

50
00:02:51,910 --> 00:02:56,050
Lesson from George Carlin is obvious in 
profanity and in comedy.

51
00:02:56,530 --> 00:02:57,363
Timing is everything.
But this cultural shift that Carlin 

52
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:00,333
built a career on didn't stop there.
Hfs words have continued to weaken and 

53
00:03:04,151 --> 00:03:06,610
as good as Carlin's bit was almost 50 
years later,

54
00:03:06,611 --> 00:03:11,080
his list of dirty words you can't say on
television needs an update because on tv

55
00:03:11,081 --> 00:03:11,914
and especially on the Internet,
you can say any of those words that you 

56
00:03:14,681 --> 00:03:15,514
want.
Now don't be turned this back around 

57
00:03:16,801 --> 00:03:18,700
when we stopped being a con,
that was bob.

58
00:03:19,540 --> 00:03:20,860
Bob had bits,
tips give,

59
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:23,380
give him me to fucking creeps.
You know that Dexter Lt,

60
00:03:23,390 --> 00:03:26,920
this is a waste about damn time.
You pissed me off.

61
00:03:26,921 --> 00:03:28,730
San Francisco Cox,
I can.

62
00:03:28,870 --> 00:03:32,770
This is called cop took up shit on shit.

63
00:03:33,290 --> 00:03:34,340
Shit.
Shit.

64
00:03:34,341 --> 00:03:35,060
Judge,
judge,

65
00:03:35,060 --> 00:03:35,601
judge,
judge,

66
00:03:35,601 --> 00:03:36,000
judge,
judge,

67
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:36,421
judge,
judge,

68
00:03:36,421 --> 00:03:36,890
judge,
judge,

69
00:03:36,890 --> 00:03:37,390
judge.

70
00:03:37,390 --> 00:03:38,223
So to recap what Lenny Bruce got 
arrested for is what Carlin got 

71
00:03:41,051 --> 00:03:43,870
celebrated for and now you can win 
Carlin's bad word Bingo.

72
00:03:43,871 --> 00:03:44,704
Just flipping through a few channels.
These words are hardly taboo or 

73
00:03:47,291 --> 00:03:49,060
forbidden at all anymore.
In fact,

74
00:03:49,061 --> 00:03:52,660
a study came out that just over five 
years across all TV networks,

75
00:03:52,870 --> 00:03:57,610
the usage of traditional profanity went 
up 69% and over 50 years,

76
00:03:57,611 --> 00:03:58,444
authors were 28 times more likely to 
include traditional swearing in the 

77
00:04:01,361 --> 00:04:04,450
books they wrote.
So there's clear empirical evidence that

78
00:04:04,451 --> 00:04:07,960
hfs words have been normalized.
Not that they're completely harmless,

79
00:04:08,020 --> 00:04:09,820
but they've been robbed of most of their
bike.

80
00:04:10,330 --> 00:04:13,420
Hfs words in America are something like 
the queen of England.

81
00:04:13,990 --> 00:04:16,960
There's still the face of profanity,
but there's not much power behind them.

82
00:04:18,280 --> 00:04:19,113
But while hfs words were being declawed,
a special class of words became even 

83
00:04:22,541 --> 00:04:25,750
more toxic and unsayable then before 
slurs,

84
00:04:25,780 --> 00:04:27,670
the inwards hate speech,
microaggressions,

85
00:04:27,850 --> 00:04:28,683
anything targeting identity,
these became the new sacred cow to 

86
00:04:31,841 --> 00:04:32,674
replace the old.

87
00:04:33,130 --> 00:04:35,110
You won't get fired for saying fucking 
the office,

88
00:04:35,111 --> 00:04:37,150
but you might get fired for saying the 
other f word.

89
00:04:37,900 --> 00:04:38,733
Now it's worth taking a moment to say 
that slurs are different from other 

90
00:04:40,931 --> 00:04:42,670
types of profanity.
After all,

91
00:04:42,671 --> 00:04:45,010
they specially target groups,
unlike other bad words,

92
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:46,330
acids,
universal,

93
00:04:46,331 --> 00:04:49,090
because everyone has one,
but not everyone is a homosexual.

94
00:04:49,091 --> 00:04:51,220
So words like Faggot seem much more 
targeted,

95
00:04:51,730 --> 00:04:54,850
so perhaps slurs do deserve a special 
place in our language.

96
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:56,253
That said,
there's something about this profanity 

97
00:04:57,641 --> 00:04:58,474
that I don't like.
Often we judge the word by itself 

98
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:03,730
condemning syllables regardless of 
situation.

99
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:05,073
Chris Rock noted this in an interview 
saying why he stopped performing at 

100
00:05:07,361 --> 00:05:09,020
colleges,
because quote,

101
00:05:09,070 --> 00:05:11,710
they're way too conservative,
not in their political views,

102
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:15,160
but in their social views and in their 
willingness not to offend anybody.

103
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:18,400
You can't even be offensive on your way 
to being inoffensive.

104
00:05:18,820 --> 00:05:19,653
In other words,
even if you have something wholesome to 

105
00:05:21,281 --> 00:05:22,680
say,
you better not use the no,

106
00:05:22,681 --> 00:05:24,550
no language on your way to making that 
point.

107
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:28,120
He goes on to mention someone else who 
also hated the new profanity.

108
00:05:29,020 --> 00:05:29,853
I remember talking to George Carlin 
before he died and him saying the exact 

109
00:05:32,321 --> 00:05:34,270
same thing.
In fact,

110
00:05:34,450 --> 00:05:35,350
he has a bit about it.

111
00:05:36,020 --> 00:05:36,853
Visit different group to get pissed off 
at you in this country for everything 

112
00:05:39,131 --> 00:05:41,560
you're not suppose to say.
Can't say fruit.

113
00:05:41,561 --> 00:05:43,180
Can't say faggot.
Can't say queer.

114
00:05:43,181 --> 00:05:45,430
Can't say Nancy boy.
Can't say pansy.

115
00:05:45,910 --> 00:05:46,743
Can't say nigger.
Boogie Jake Jigaboo skinhead jungle 

116
00:05:48,941 --> 00:05:50,980
bunny.
Morely more than Yana Schweitzer.

117
00:05:51,370 --> 00:05:56,370
There is absolutely nothing wrong with 
any of those words in and of themselves.

118
00:05:58,550 --> 00:06:01,580
It's the intention behind the words that
makes them good or bad.

119
00:06:01,730 --> 00:06:05,630
I get tired of people talking about bad 
words and bad language bullshit.

120
00:06:05,750 --> 00:06:08,450
It's the context that makes them good or
bad,

121
00:06:09,270 --> 00:06:12,420
but despite that eloquent argument for 
the total liberation of words,

122
00:06:12,510 --> 00:06:15,990
I can't help but think that Carlin lost 
his war for total free speech,

123
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:21,320
even if he won his battle for liberating
a type of profanity because profanity is

124
00:06:21,571 --> 00:06:22,404
a human universal,
deeply rooted in societal taboos and 

125
00:06:24,871 --> 00:06:28,860
though these taboos can shift with time,
they never disappear entirely,

126
00:06:28,980 --> 00:06:32,160
so the profanity won't either.
It will only change.

127
00:06:32,190 --> 00:06:35,100
This has been the story in America in 
the last 50 years.

128
00:06:35,101 --> 00:06:35,934
We have shifted from primarily in hfs 
culture to primarily and in cultural 

129
00:06:39,370 --> 00:06:40,830
swearing.
For me,

130
00:06:40,890 --> 00:06:41,723
this suggests that we don't get less 
sensitive as much as we change what 

131
00:06:44,341 --> 00:06:46,980
we're sensitive about and this is 
ultimately brought forward.

132
00:06:46,981 --> 00:06:47,814
A few questions in my mind.
What balance of free speech and 

133
00:06:50,191 --> 00:06:54,390
sensitivity towards social issues do we 
want given that taboos change over time?

134
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:55,553
How can we recognize that word's harm?
People without capitulating towards an 

135
00:06:58,531 --> 00:07:01,350
ideology that condemns words outside of 
their context.

136
00:07:01,650 --> 00:07:02,483
And finally,
is it inevitable that our kids will 

137
00:07:04,171 --> 00:07:07,500
simultaneously think we were being 
prudes and bigots?

138
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:15,200
Only time will tell,
Aye.

139
00:07:16,150 --> 00:07:17,020
Aye.
Aye.

140
00:07:17,410 --> 00:07:18,243
I wish I had the worst.
So express this and that's been his 

141
00:07:20,961 --> 00:07:23,010
thing.
And then my chest and stomach is flatter

142
00:07:23,011 --> 00:07:24,130
him.
When I hear your name,

143
00:07:24,131 --> 00:07:29,131
all those vibrations to hedge rums,
I'm making some soup and I love the cute

144
00:07:29,171 --> 00:07:32,160
things that we do watching me write my 
lyrics and you critique them.

145
00:07:32,190 --> 00:07:35,380
And so that's something you never have 
to put your energy into.

146
00:07:35,381 --> 00:07:37,490
Your said what an answer is something 
that Jay,

147
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:40,330
thank you for watching that video.
Number one.

148
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:43,780
