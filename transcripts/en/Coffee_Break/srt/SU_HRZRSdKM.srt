1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:00,893
Warning.
This video is about profanity across 

2
00:00:02,581 --> 00:00:05,490
cultures,
so profanity is used uncensored.

3
00:00:05,730 --> 00:00:06,630
You were discretion

4
00:00:06,710 --> 00:00:11,710
is advised.
[inaudible]

5
00:00:18,280 --> 00:00:21,250
where do bad words come from and what 
are the similarities,

6
00:00:21,251 --> 00:00:22,084
if any,
across languages and cultures in 

7
00:00:23,841 --> 00:00:24,674
swearing?
What causes some words to be worse than 

8
00:00:27,821 --> 00:00:28,654
others?
These questions have fascinated 

9
00:00:30,251 --> 00:00:33,670
linguists for centuries and today we're 
going to look at some of the answers.

10
00:00:34,060 --> 00:00:34,893
When you look across the world,
profanity is almost a universal feature 

11
00:00:37,631 --> 00:00:38,464
of language.
We have created thousands of different 

12
00:00:40,091 --> 00:00:40,924
profane words,
but despite some moderate variation 

13
00:00:42,941 --> 00:00:43,774
between languages,
the types of words we classify as 

14
00:00:46,031 --> 00:00:46,864
unsayable in public share.
A lot of overlap and this is because we 

15
00:00:50,081 --> 00:00:53,110
all create bad words around social 
taboos.

16
00:00:53,530 --> 00:00:56,710
Taboos are things in a society that are 
considered to private,

17
00:00:56,711 --> 00:00:58,300
gross,
ugly or sacred.

18
00:00:58,510 --> 00:01:02,200
Their topics so delicate that they can 
only be allowed in certain places.

19
00:01:02,650 --> 00:01:04,060
Bodily functions,
for example,

20
00:01:04,061 --> 00:01:06,070
have taboos that are confined to the 
bathroom.

21
00:01:06,310 --> 00:01:08,650
Sex has taboos that are confined to the 
bedroom,

22
00:01:09,010 --> 00:01:12,100
uncomfortable past events contained 
taboos that are confined to history,

23
00:01:12,101 --> 00:01:12,934
class and religious rituals have taboos 
that are confined to the temple or 

24
00:01:15,881 --> 00:01:17,620
church and these taboos.

25
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:18,513
Sometimes though not always will lead to
certain words describing them becoming 

26
00:01:22,061 --> 00:01:25,750
themselves off limits due to the 
association with the taboo itself.

27
00:01:26,110 --> 00:01:26,943
In other words,
not only do we have a contextual 

28
00:01:28,841 --> 00:01:30,910
allowance for sensitive parts of our 
lives,

29
00:01:31,030 --> 00:01:33,400
we do the same with the words describing
them.

30
00:01:33,490 --> 00:01:36,100
For example,
you can say poop or but just fine,

31
00:01:36,101 --> 00:01:36,934
but if you talk about shit or an ass,
well now you've crossed the line even 

32
00:01:39,581 --> 00:01:41,260
though they are words for the same 
thing.

33
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:44,920
One has been deemed culturally 
appropriate and the other has not.

34
00:01:45,100 --> 00:01:45,933
Now,
some cultures create different taboos 

35
00:01:47,351 --> 00:01:49,180
and others,
but looking across the world,

36
00:01:49,420 --> 00:01:51,940
we generally find the same big four 
taboos,

37
00:01:51,941 --> 00:01:55,840
creating most of the bad language,
the four horsemen of profanity,

38
00:01:56,380 --> 00:01:58,000
sex,
bodily function,

39
00:01:58,060 --> 00:02:01,960
religion and slurs and this pattern of 
fairly common taboos,

40
00:02:01,961 --> 00:02:05,950
breeding similar bad words because 
Benjamin k Bergen in his book,

41
00:02:05,980 --> 00:02:09,730
what the F to come up with a 
categorization method for profanity that

42
00:02:09,731 --> 00:02:12,130
he calls the holy fucking Shit nigger 
principle.

43
00:02:12,490 --> 00:02:14,290
Yeah,
that's actually what he calls it.

44
00:02:14,860 --> 00:02:15,693
Here's the idea.
Benjamin Bergen says that nearly all so 

45
00:02:18,041 --> 00:02:18,874
called bad or forbidden words fall into 
one or more of the following types of 

46
00:02:22,121 --> 00:02:22,954
profanity.
Holy meaning religious or sacred Glass 

47
00:02:25,750 --> 00:02:26,583
Homie,
fucking meaning relating to sex shit 

48
00:02:29,321 --> 00:02:30,154
relating to bodily functions.
And finally nigger relating to slurs 

49
00:02:33,341 --> 00:02:34,174
towards groups.
Any nasty pejorative to describe groups 

50
00:02:36,431 --> 00:02:37,264
of people fall here.
Now of course some bad words like slut 

51
00:02:40,810 --> 00:02:41,643
might fall into multiple categories.
It's both a slur about a group and also 

52
00:02:45,071 --> 00:02:45,904
a word about sex.
So bear in mind that bad words can fall 

53
00:02:48,371 --> 00:02:51,070
into multiple camps.
As a quick note from here out,

54
00:02:51,071 --> 00:02:51,904
as we discuss this principal,
I'll be referring to it as the h f s in 

55
00:02:55,541 --> 00:02:57,430
principle.
This is because one,

56
00:02:57,431 --> 00:02:58,264
it's a mouthful and two,
it's safe way to start the conversation 

57
00:03:00,581 --> 00:03:03,220
without requiring a disclaimer at the 
beginning of your discussion.

58
00:03:03,490 --> 00:03:07,240
So now that we have that out of the way,
besides being disconcertingly memorable,

59
00:03:07,450 --> 00:03:11,350
why did Benjamin Bergen find the hfs in 
principles so useful?

60
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:12,633
The answer is because it does a great 
job to categorize most swearing and 

61
00:03:15,370 --> 00:03:18,490
profanity by the human taboo.
They draw power from,

62
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:21,580
and this is valuable because while all 
our words differ,

63
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:22,593
the things we described are the same.
So it's reasonable to suggest that 

64
00:03:25,031 --> 00:03:25,864
studying the roots of profanity will 
reveal something about the profanity 

65
00:03:28,930 --> 00:03:29,763
itself.
And the first thing you find is that 

66
00:03:31,181 --> 00:03:33,700
taboos are definitely tendencies and 
culture,

67
00:03:33,940 --> 00:03:34,773
but you also find that they are not 
guaranteed to take ruth and the taboos 

68
00:03:37,691 --> 00:03:38,524
that had culture does.
Carrie tells you something about their 

69
00:03:40,391 --> 00:03:41,680
history.
For example,

70
00:03:41,710 --> 00:03:42,543
some languages like Cantonese,
Chinese that come from more secular 

71
00:03:45,101 --> 00:03:45,934
cultures,
perhaps unsurprisingly don't possess 

72
00:03:48,020 --> 00:03:50,470
Coley profanity in their lexicon.
They do,

73
00:03:50,471 --> 00:03:51,304
however,
have some swear words about their 

74
00:03:52,301 --> 00:03:55,240
ancestors due to their history of 
ancestor reverence.

75
00:03:55,540 --> 00:03:56,373
But that's not all.
When we look at the top five words that 

76
00:03:58,271 --> 00:04:02,110
are considered most defensive in Chinese
known as the outstanding five,

77
00:04:02,380 --> 00:04:06,490
all of them have to do with sex.
So we can safely say that Chinese is not

78
00:04:06,491 --> 00:04:09,640
a holy language,
instead primarily a fucking language,

79
00:04:09,970 --> 00:04:10,803
but other languages like Quebecois 
French can be considered holy languages 

80
00:04:13,930 --> 00:04:16,060
because of their deep Catholic roots.
They're profane.

81
00:04:16,061 --> 00:04:19,780
Dictionary has what are called Saccos,
literally meaning consecrations,

82
00:04:20,080 --> 00:04:23,950
which are Catholic liturgical terms like
sacrament that when uttered in the right

83
00:04:23,951 --> 00:04:26,560
context are seen as some of their 
strongest swear words.

84
00:04:27,130 --> 00:04:27,963
Deb Neck for example,
is stronger than their word for fuck or 

85
00:04:30,581 --> 00:04:31,900
shit.
So we can say that,

86
00:04:31,901 --> 00:04:34,630
wow,
Quebecois French has F and s words.

87
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:37,030
It's more of a holy language than 
anything else.

88
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:38,313
Moving on.
You can also add English to the list of 

89
00:04:39,971 --> 00:04:44,020
holy languages coming from a Judeo 
Christian religious tradition where it's

90
00:04:44,021 --> 00:04:44,980
like damn or hell.

91
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:45,873
Obviously our references to religious 
ideas and English is an interesting 

92
00:04:49,571 --> 00:04:54,520
swearing language in general in that we 
are an h f s and in language.

93
00:04:54,790 --> 00:04:55,623
And a good example of the second lesson 
we learned from the hfs in principle 

94
00:04:58,750 --> 00:04:59,583
within the same culture,
the relative strength of taboos usually 

95
00:05:01,901 --> 00:05:04,390
correlates to the relative strength of 
the profanity.

96
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:05,673
So in America for example,
both sex and the scatological are 

97
00:05:08,861 --> 00:05:11,380
considered taboo,
but of the two of them sexist,

98
00:05:11,430 --> 00:05:13,690
more taboo hints,
fuck and is related.

99
00:05:13,691 --> 00:05:14,524
Cousins are considered more offensive 
than shit or ass and all of the taboo 

100
00:05:17,961 --> 00:05:20,590
strengths very heavily by culture.
In German,

101
00:05:20,591 --> 00:05:22,750
for example,
this situation is totally reversed.

102
00:05:22,780 --> 00:05:27,220
German is primarily a shit language.
The German word for fuck Israeli used in

103
00:05:27,221 --> 00:05:28,054
swearing instead,
some variant of shit or ass is used 

104
00:05:30,521 --> 00:05:33,830
constantly such as the German word for 
asshole phase,

105
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:35,330
born from an ass shit head.

106
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:38,020
You get the idea.
Now last but not least,

107
00:05:38,050 --> 00:05:40,060
are there similar languages?
Well,

108
00:05:40,061 --> 00:05:42,580
up until recently,
those slurs have been common across many

109
00:05:42,581 --> 00:05:45,550
cultures.
A general taboo around slurs hasn't been

110
00:05:45,551 --> 00:05:46,384
present.
What I mean by this is those slurs were 

111
00:05:48,401 --> 00:05:52,210
used for nefarious purposes and to 
promote tribalism and ingroup behavior.

112
00:05:52,420 --> 00:05:55,060
They were not considered taboo by the 
culture itself,

113
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:56,193
but in the last century,
there's a very good argument to make 

114
00:05:57,711 --> 00:05:58,544
that in America at least slurs have 
quickly become the most universally 

115
00:06:01,521 --> 00:06:05,630
powerful taboo we have,
and a good question might be why.

116
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:09,650
Why did we shift and why are some slurs 
seen as worse than others?

117
00:06:10,070 --> 00:06:14,630
Let me suggest one possible explanation.
The civil rights movement in America did

118
00:06:14,631 --> 00:06:15,464
more than change laws.
They highlighted a history of 

119
00:06:17,781 --> 00:06:19,850
disenfranchisement amongst certain 
groups,

120
00:06:20,060 --> 00:06:22,430
which none of us really want to think or
talk about.

121
00:06:22,910 --> 00:06:23,743
In other words,
this unseemly part of American history 

122
00:06:25,701 --> 00:06:28,970
became taboo.
And what happens when we have a powerful

123
00:06:28,971 --> 00:06:31,070
cultural taboo?
Well,

124
00:06:31,071 --> 00:06:31,904
the words that called back to that 
uncomfortable history in an 

125
00:06:33,801 --> 00:06:34,634
inappropriate way become forbidden.
And once you see that slurs became 

126
00:06:37,191 --> 00:06:39,770
powerful when connected with their 
historical context,

127
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:43,010
it's easy to see why in America the 
inward is way,

128
00:06:43,011 --> 00:06:45,380
way,
way more offensive to most people.

129
00:06:45,381 --> 00:06:46,214
Then even words like fuck.
Whereas if you visit a culture without 

130
00:06:49,041 --> 00:06:49,874
the history of slavery,
they wouldn't find that word is 

131
00:06:51,201 --> 00:06:53,840
offensive because the word isn't linked 
to the history.

132
00:06:57,770 --> 00:07:02,150
What's up my Nigga?
What did you just say?

133
00:07:04,490 --> 00:07:05,900
What's up my Nigga?

134
00:07:11,490 --> 00:07:13,290
Okay,
so now that we've talked about the age,

135
00:07:13,291 --> 00:07:14,124
the FDS and the n in hfs in principle,
now let's spend some time talking about 

136
00:07:18,900 --> 00:07:22,410
a few exceptions to these roles that we 
find scattered across cultures.

137
00:07:22,980 --> 00:07:23,813
Interesting.
Cultural variance include profane 

138
00:07:24,991 --> 00:07:26,730
language about animals.
In Korea,

139
00:07:26,731 --> 00:07:27,564
for example,
calling someone a dog is deeply 

140
00:07:28,831 --> 00:07:31,500
offensive.
There's also profanity around disease.

141
00:07:31,501 --> 00:07:32,334
In Dutch,
Profane language includes words for 

142
00:07:33,601 --> 00:07:34,610
cancer,
typhoid,

143
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:35,453
tuberculosis.
Often the severity of the disease 

144
00:07:37,410 --> 00:07:39,420
emphasizes the strength of the 
profanity.

145
00:07:39,870 --> 00:07:44,100
And a final interesting taboo that pops 
up sometimes is a taboo around death and

146
00:07:44,101 --> 00:07:46,350
death related words.
For example,

147
00:07:46,351 --> 00:07:47,184
in some Australian aboriginal cultures 
you can't say the name of someone who 

148
00:07:49,591 --> 00:07:50,424
has died for up to a year or in more 
extreme instances like with the 

149
00:07:53,460 --> 00:07:54,293
[inaudible] tribe of Columbia.
This same rule is enforced under the 

150
00:07:57,091 --> 00:08:00,720
penalty of death.
However,

151
00:08:00,750 --> 00:08:03,210
even though are local taboos which buck 
the trend,

152
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:04,073
most of the time when you find stable 
profane language it tends to follow the 

153
00:08:07,141 --> 00:08:12,141
h f s and if you can look past the 
offensive charged words we can't say and

154
00:08:12,451 --> 00:08:16,560
instead examine the taboos themselves,
we learn what is actually going on.

155
00:08:16,620 --> 00:08:17,453
It isn't the words themselves,
it's the parts of our life that they're 

156
00:08:19,651 --> 00:08:23,090
connected to the parts that our society 
is uncomfortable with.

157
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:25,753
Yeah.

158
00:08:25,910 --> 00:08:26,743
Yup.

159
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:31,753
Thank you for watching.
This is the first of a two part series 

160
00:08:33,951 --> 00:08:34,784
on profanity,
both of which will probably be 

161
00:08:36,141 --> 00:08:38,720
demonetized by youtube.
So if you enjoyed this video,

162
00:08:38,721 --> 00:08:39,554
consider supporting me on Patrion and a 
big thank you to the patrons who make 

163
00:08:42,261 --> 00:08:44,630
long research intensive videos like this
possible.

164
00:08:44,690 --> 00:08:46,940
Even when the topics aren't advertiser 
friendly.

165
00:08:47,300 --> 00:08:49,790
Mecca 83 provided both of the songs for 
this video,

166
00:08:49,791 --> 00:08:50,624
so if you like the tracks,
you can support them on soundcloud or 

167
00:08:52,161 --> 00:08:54,800
spotify links below.
Lastly,

168
00:08:54,830 --> 00:08:57,080
if you want to know more about this 
fascinating subject,

169
00:08:57,140 --> 00:08:57,973
further reading and listening 
suggestions can be found in the 

170
00:08:59,481 --> 00:09:01,090
footnotes.
I'll see you in part two.
