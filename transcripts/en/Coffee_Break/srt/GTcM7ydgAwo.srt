1
00:00:00,810 --> 00:00:01,643
These guys realized quick,
if they were going to claim that 

2
00:00:03,011 --> 00:00:05,340
cigarettes were not addictive,
they better have proof.

3
00:00:06,690 --> 00:00:07,523
This is the man who rely on,
he's been testing the link between 

4
00:00:09,691 --> 00:00:13,290
nicotine and lung cancer for 30 years 
and hasn't found any conclusive results.

5
00:00:13,830 --> 00:00:16,110
The man's a genius.
He could disprove gravity.

6
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:19,940
This is called industry funded research.
And while it is a science,

7
00:00:19,941 --> 00:00:20,774
unfortunately,
it's oftentimes a science of deception 

8
00:00:23,510 --> 00:00:24,343
when faced with inconvenient facts,
companies will sometimes pay for 

9
00:00:26,841 --> 00:00:30,260
research to find the opposite conclusion
so they can deny guilt.

10
00:00:30,680 --> 00:00:31,513
The most notorious example for this was 
the tobacco industry who famously 

11
00:00:34,521 --> 00:00:35,354
created an organization called the 
council for Tobacco Research to fight 

12
00:00:38,061 --> 00:00:40,490
the idea that cigarettes caused lung 
cancer.

13
00:00:41,080 --> 00:00:43,990
Uh,
Dr Liddle have any cancer causing agents

14
00:00:43,991 --> 00:00:46,540
been identified and cigarettes?
No,

15
00:00:46,660 --> 00:00:48,840
none had ever,
uh,

16
00:00:48,990 --> 00:00:53,470
either in cigarette.
So in any of product of smoking.

17
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:54,520
As such.

18
00:00:54,990 --> 00:00:56,340
Now,
fast forward a few decades,

19
00:00:56,341 --> 00:01:00,060
the public eventually found out the 
truth and the CTR was exposed as a sham,

20
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:02,790
but as the world turned it into 
attention to new problems,

21
00:01:02,791 --> 00:01:05,820
one industry found itself in familiar 
crosshairs.

22
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:11,630
We Americans spend more money on slots 
then on movies,

23
00:01:11,810 --> 00:01:16,220
baseball and theme parks combined,
but with the modern slot machines,

24
00:01:16,250 --> 00:01:17,083
there's a greater potential for a 
dangerous side effect gambling 

25
00:01:20,420 --> 00:01:23,660
addiction.
Problem gambling has become an epidemic.

26
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:26,600
Last year,
the American Psychiatric Association,

27
00:01:26,770 --> 00:01:30,140
we classified pathological gambling as 
an addiction.

28
00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:35,340
A Las Vegas and other casinos are like 
giant laboratories and the features that

29
00:01:35,481 --> 00:01:39,020
earn higher will stick and those that 
don't will drop away.

30
00:01:39,110 --> 00:01:43,310
The formula they've hit upon happens to 
be one that's highly addictive.

31
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:44,233
The gambling industry was being accused 
of preying on the wallets of addicted 

32
00:01:47,031 --> 00:01:47,864
gamblers,
addicted gamblers that they helped 

33
00:01:49,641 --> 00:01:52,160
create with their carefully designed 
machines.

34
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:53,113
Howard Shaffer,
researcher at Harvard noted this 

35
00:01:54,771 --> 00:01:55,604
increased addictiveness of modern games 
like slots by calling them the crack 

36
00:01:58,491 --> 00:02:02,150
cocaine of gambling.
In the midst of all this horrible press,

37
00:02:02,180 --> 00:02:05,120
the gambling industry needed a strategy 
to stay alive.

38
00:02:05,780 --> 00:02:08,450
Luckily for them,
they had watched someone else go through

39
00:02:08,451 --> 00:02:12,260
this and had learned a few things.
You can't completely deny the facts.

40
00:02:12,410 --> 00:02:15,050
The cigarette industry tried it and it 
didn't work.

41
00:02:15,110 --> 00:02:18,620
The truth eventually comes out,
so they came up with a different plan.

42
00:02:19,010 --> 00:02:19,843
Instead of denying gambling addiction,
they would embrace the problem publicly 

43
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:23,473
and also take an extremely active role 
in researching the science of gambling 

44
00:02:26,091 --> 00:02:27,620
addiction.
By doing this,

45
00:02:27,621 --> 00:02:28,454
they could frame the discussion of the 
addiction the way they wanted to and so 

46
00:02:31,431 --> 00:02:32,264
the National Center for responsible 
gaming was created funded by casino 

47
00:02:35,541 --> 00:02:36,374
dollars,

48
00:02:41,780 --> 00:02:44,210
and here's how they described gambling 
addiction today,

49
00:02:44,630 --> 00:02:45,463
so what exactly is a gambling disorder 
and why do some people struggle with it 

50
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:52,010
while others do not?
One point that research clearly shows is

51
00:02:52,011 --> 00:02:52,844
that gambling disorders are closely 
linked with other psychological 

52
00:02:55,161 --> 00:02:55,994
problems,
including depression and substance 

53
00:02:57,321 --> 00:03:00,340
abuse.
We also know that over time,

54
00:03:00,340 --> 00:03:04,210
proximity to casinos does not impact the
prevalence of gambling disorders,

55
00:03:04,420 --> 00:03:07,150
and one of the vast majority of people 
gamble responsibly.

56
00:03:07,390 --> 00:03:11,080
Approximately one percent of Americans 
are diagnosed with a gambling disorder.

57
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:12,910
Now,
it might not surprise you.

58
00:03:12,940 --> 00:03:16,150
Many of their findings are in direct 
contradiction to scientific studies that

59
00:03:16,180 --> 00:03:19,720
aren't backed by casino dollars,
but rather than nitpicking everything,

60
00:03:19,721 --> 00:03:20,554
I want to focus on their macro message.
The biggest thing is that they want to 

61
00:03:23,561 --> 00:03:27,520
imply that addicts are born that way 
they're not created from a product.

62
00:03:27,850 --> 00:03:30,730
If you can blame addiction on brain 
problems within the addict,

63
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:33,550
your indirectly vindicating the gambling
machines,

64
00:03:34,030 --> 00:03:34,863
of course this is what the casinos want.
The most dangerous idea is that they 

65
00:03:38,051 --> 00:03:40,630
have anything to do with creating 
addicts,

66
00:03:40,780 --> 00:03:43,630
so instead they say it's not the product
that causes the problem.

67
00:03:43,990 --> 00:03:44,823
The problem is already within the addict
and just expresses itself in the 

68
00:03:47,471 --> 00:03:48,160
addiction.

69
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:50,400
The senior research director for the 
NCRG,

70
00:03:50,410 --> 00:03:52,810
Christine Riley makes this bias 
explicit.

71
00:03:53,350 --> 00:03:55,450
Things are not addictive.
They're just not.

72
00:03:55,690 --> 00:03:56,523
If you don't have that vulnerability,
the odds are you won't get addicted and 

73
00:03:59,861 --> 00:04:00,694
the NCRG is willing to put up a lot of 
money to any scientist who will agree 

74
00:04:03,971 --> 00:04:04,804
with them and surprisingly one of the 
people who took them up on that offer 

75
00:04:07,751 --> 00:04:09,430
was Howard Schaefer,
the main,

76
00:04:09,431 --> 00:04:12,790
quoted it earlier as calling slots the 
crack cocaine of gambling.

77
00:04:13,270 --> 00:04:14,103
Today he tells a much different story 
that casino games like slots aren't 

78
00:04:16,811 --> 00:04:19,750
addictive,
and if this seems like a one 80 to you,

79
00:04:19,780 --> 00:04:22,600
you're not the only one.
When asked about this contradiction,

80
00:04:22,601 --> 00:04:24,970
he tried really hard to square the two 
opinions,

81
00:04:25,450 --> 00:04:26,283
but at one point you said slot machines.
Where the crack cocaine of gambling and 

82
00:04:34,180 --> 00:04:36,760
how does that square with what you're 
telling me today,

83
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:39,660
not everybody who uses crack cocaine 
becomes addicted.

84
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:41,793
Nobody's going to sit here and try to 
tell me crack cocaine isn't addictive 

85
00:04:45,070 --> 00:04:49,810
and if this is like crack cocaine,
the conclusion is that it's addictive.

86
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:55,150
I don't come to the same conclusion 
because the majority of people that have

87
00:04:55,151 --> 00:04:58,030
used cocaine have not developed cocaine 
addiction.

88
00:04:58,510 --> 00:04:59,343
Only a small minority.
And the same would be true with 

89
00:05:01,781 --> 00:05:02,180
gambling.

90
00:05:02,180 --> 00:05:03,230
Oh,
okay.

91
00:05:03,290 --> 00:05:04,123
Now obviously Howard shaffer would say 
the millions of dollars in research 

92
00:05:06,981 --> 00:05:09,530
funding he's received hasn't tainted his
research,

93
00:05:09,531 --> 00:05:11,360
but uh,
in Schaefer's words,

94
00:05:11,670 --> 00:05:13,930
I,
I don't come to the same conclusion

95
00:05:13,940 --> 00:05:15,500
because we started to say the wrong 
things.

96
00:05:15,501 --> 00:05:16,334
A lot of that funding would disappear.
Research funding from places like C or 

97
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:20,353
g,
but also mgm resorts and draft kings 

98
00:05:22,011 --> 00:05:22,844
just to name a few.
And this strategy to by scientific 

99
00:05:25,461 --> 00:05:26,294
research to shift the burden of 
responsibility onto the addict and away 

100
00:05:29,001 --> 00:05:31,040
from the product has been great for 
casinos,

101
00:05:31,041 --> 00:05:31,874
public image,
but it isn't the first time someone 

102
00:05:33,771 --> 00:05:34,604
tried it.

103
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:35,993
Assessment of the published data seemed 
to show an association between certain 

104
00:05:41,211 --> 00:05:46,211
types of cancer and excessive use of 
cigarettes.

105
00:05:46,460 --> 00:05:50,360
Now,
very interested in finding out what kind

106
00:05:50,361 --> 00:05:51,194
of people are heavy smokers.
Is it a different nervous type of 

107
00:05:54,801 --> 00:05:55,634
person?
Is it a person who is differently to 

108
00:05:58,191 --> 00:05:59,024
strain stress because it is very clear 
that certain people just couldn't take 

109
00:06:05,061 --> 00:06:05,894
it.

110
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:15,850
Certain people just can't take it.
This is exactly the same framing casinos

111
00:06:15,851 --> 00:06:16,684
use.
Why do some people struggle with it 

112
00:06:18,460 --> 00:06:19,293
while others do not?

113
00:06:19,430 --> 00:06:21,980
Certain people just can't take it.

114
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:23,233
It's a simple,
powerful argument and whether or not 

115
00:06:25,611 --> 00:06:28,010
anyone fully believes them,
that isn't the point.

116
00:06:28,580 --> 00:06:31,610
The gambling industry winds,
even if all they do is confuse you.

117
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:32,713
If they can cast doubt on the scientific
consensus of what causes gambling 

118
00:06:35,601 --> 00:06:36,434
addiction,
they've won because nobody's going to 

119
00:06:38,151 --> 00:06:38,984
legislate on something that the 
scientific community isn't agreed upon 

120
00:06:41,660 --> 00:06:44,600
and the problem of deliberate 
misinformation is widespread.

121
00:06:44,630 --> 00:06:46,730
It goes beyond just smoking and 
gambling.

122
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:47,833
You can find it at Exxon where knowledge
of climate change was deliberately 

123
00:06:50,481 --> 00:06:51,314
ignored and you can find it in the sugar
industry when they paid for research to 

124
00:06:54,321 --> 00:06:56,540
blame heart disease on fat instead of 
sugar.

125
00:06:56,750 --> 00:06:59,000
You can even find it in my favorite Soda
Company.

126
00:06:59,001 --> 00:06:59,834
Coca Cola,
when they publicly said they care about 

127
00:07:01,521 --> 00:07:04,310
the problem of soft drinks,
but deny it in the science.

128
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:06,740
So if we know this problem is 
widespread,

129
00:07:06,770 --> 00:07:08,540
why do we continue to fall for it?

130
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:10,513
There are two main models we use to deal
with research that has a conflict of 

131
00:07:12,861 --> 00:07:13,694
interest.
You can completely prohibit it or you 

132
00:07:15,501 --> 00:07:16,334
can disclose the conflict of interest 
and use peer review as a check and 

133
00:07:19,011 --> 00:07:19,844
balance for a long time.
We've used the ladder and assumed peer 

134
00:07:22,221 --> 00:07:25,520
review would be enough because 
prohibition just seems extreme,

135
00:07:25,790 --> 00:07:29,170
but many critics are now wondering 
whether this is effective at keeping out

136
00:07:29,171 --> 00:07:30,004
bad science because the NCRG disclosed 
it and yet they still manage to shove 

137
00:07:33,470 --> 00:07:35,630
200 papers through the peer review 
process.

138
00:07:35,990 --> 00:07:39,380
Even the tobacco industry funded 
research that slipped favorable articles

139
00:07:39,381 --> 00:07:41,900
past the peer review process.
In my view,

140
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:42,793
the risk is too great.
I think that more journals should 

141
00:07:45,021 --> 00:07:48,890
seriously consider the prohibition model
when dealing with papers with an obvious

142
00:07:48,891 --> 00:07:49,724
conflict of interest.
We live in a world where the truth is 

143
00:07:52,341 --> 00:07:53,174
not agreed upon very often,
and the last thing we need is for 

144
00:07:56,031 --> 00:08:00,290
science of beacon of objectivity to be 
cluttered by bad actors who just want to

145
00:08:00,291 --> 00:08:03,560
confuse the scientific consensus and 
prevent progress.

146
00:08:03,950 --> 00:08:06,020
So far,
what are the conclusions reached by your

147
00:08:06,021 --> 00:08:07,790
organization,
in my opinion,

148
00:08:07,791 --> 00:08:11,840
to single out smoking as a causal agent 
is on the evidence today.

149
00:08:11,860 --> 00:08:12,980
Complete down.
Gus,

150
00:08:13,940 --> 00:08:14,773
thank you very much for your help.
Thank you very much for letting me put 

151

152

and care

153
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:27,300
before you go.
We have a sponsor,

154

Most of the ideas you see on this 

158
00:08:39,721 --> 00:08:40,554
channel art inspired by books and one of
the ways I get through books is by 

159
00:08:43,651 --> 00:08:46,170
listening to them in the car,
at the gym,

160
00:08:46,290 --> 00:08:47,280
walking,
whatever.

161
00:08:47,690 --> 00:08:51,210
It's a great way to just take some books
down in your free time today.

162
00:08:51,211 --> 00:08:53,640
I wanted to recommend hooked by Nir 
Eyal,

163
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:56,730
which is about how engineer addictive 
products,

164
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,640
and I think it goes right in line with 
this video if you want to learn more.

165
00:08:59,970 --> 00:09:00,803
So once again,

00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:02,933
