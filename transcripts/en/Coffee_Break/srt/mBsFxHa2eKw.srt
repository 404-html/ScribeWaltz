1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:01,043
For as long as there have been poor and 
rich people have devised clever ways to 

2
00:00:04,531 --> 00:00:07,050
redistribute wealth.
Whether it be taxes,

3
00:00:07,051 --> 00:00:10,110
political manifestos or buy more 
barbaric means,

4
00:00:10,410 --> 00:00:11,243
but you may still be left unsatisfied 
with the current system wondering where 

5
00:00:14,011 --> 00:00:14,844
is your cut you after all are smarter 
than the average person yet stuck with 

6
00:00:18,421 --> 00:00:21,300
an average bank account.
Today we're going to change that.

7
00:00:21,301 --> 00:00:22,134
We're cutting corners and making money 
moves because there is a business plan 

8
00:00:24,961 --> 00:00:25,794
that can create massive amounts of 
wealth for you with minimal effort 

9
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:31,260
though you may have to leave a few 
ethics at the door.

10
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:34,320
I'm talking of course about the pyramid 
scheme.

11
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:36,953
Before we begin,
you should know what you're getting 

12
00:00:37,771 --> 00:00:38,604
yourself into.
A pyramid scheme is a business blend 

13
00:00:40,231 --> 00:00:41,064
where recruits buy in to the scheme by 
paying people above them and then can 

14
00:00:43,861 --> 00:00:47,370
recruit people below them and profit 
from what those new people pay in.

15
00:00:47,580 --> 00:00:51,270
One of the most popular variants of the 
scheme is the airplane game and it works

16
00:00:51,271 --> 00:00:53,850
like this.
You buy in for $1,500

17
00:00:53,851 --> 00:00:54,684
under someone else as a passenger and 
every time the flight gets filled 

18
00:00:57,030 --> 00:00:57,863
everyone gets promoted.
Passenger to crew crew to copilot and 

19
00:01:00,241 --> 00:01:03,240
copilot to pilot until after a few full 
flights.

20
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:05,730
You become the pilot and once you have a
full flight,

21
00:01:05,940 --> 00:01:10,680
you finally exit by getting paid $12,000
eight times your original investment.

22
00:01:10,980 --> 00:01:13,650
It sounds easy enough,
but there's a very serious problem.

23
00:01:13,890 --> 00:01:14,723
This traditional type of pyramid scheme 
involving direct buy-ins is illegal in 

24
00:01:17,671 --> 00:01:20,820
most modern countries because the 
business plan is built on the idea of an

25
00:01:20,821 --> 00:01:21,654
exponential chain of people,
which is unsustainable living the 

26
00:01:23,911 --> 00:01:26,460
majority of the people at the bottom 
having lost money,

27
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:29,580
which is a bummer if you have dreams of 
Egyptian polygons,

28
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,450
but to the less scrupulous among you 
fear not for where there's a way to make

29
00:01:33,451 --> 00:01:34,500
money hand over fist.

30
00:01:34,530 --> 00:01:38,520
There's usually a legal way to do that 
and that holds true for pyramid schemes.

31
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:42,330
So here are the six steps to creating a 
perfectly legal pyramid scheme.

32
00:01:43,810 --> 00:01:45,310
Step one,
find a product.

33
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:46,353
Don't worry.
It doesn't have to be that good of a 

34
00:01:47,291 --> 00:01:48,124
product or competitive in the open 
market because you're not really going 

35
00:01:50,501 --> 00:01:52,530
to be selling this product in the 
traditional sense.

36
00:01:52,830 --> 00:01:56,620
A product to a pyramid scheme is more 
like poker chips to a casino there.

37
00:01:56,621 --> 00:01:58,840
The legal way you make money change 
hands.

38
00:01:59,140 --> 00:01:59,973
Imagine we take the structure of a 
pyramid scheme and instead of the buy 

39
00:02:01,931 --> 00:02:03,970
end being cash,
you make it a product.

40
00:02:04,630 --> 00:02:05,463
This way you can say you're providing a 
good or service to your customers even 

41
00:02:08,231 --> 00:02:10,540
if your customers are just the people 
working for you.

42
00:02:10,810 --> 00:02:11,643
Now,
there is one thing to think about when 

43
00:02:12,581 --> 00:02:13,414
choosing a product in order to pay every
person along the chain of the pyramid 

44
00:02:16,450 --> 00:02:18,640
enough.
It's important that you have high profit

45
00:02:18,641 --> 00:02:22,240
margins and typical wholesale margins 
just aren't going to cut it,

46
00:02:22,390 --> 00:02:24,970
so triple the price of your product and 
call it premium.

47
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:26,560
Again,
don't worry about demand.

48
00:02:26,561 --> 00:02:29,800
Your employees will be purchasing your 
overpriced products hoping to get rich,

49
00:02:29,830 --> 00:02:31,870
not to save money.
Step two,

50
00:02:31,871 --> 00:02:32,704
make a payout structure.
You might think this should be 

51
00:02:34,211 --> 00:02:35,740
straightforward,
but whatever you do,

52
00:02:35,741 --> 00:02:38,170
do not make this simple or 
understandable.

53
00:02:38,470 --> 00:02:40,690
You should have two goals in mind when 
doing this.

54
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:41,793
One,
keep most of the profits going to the 

55
00:02:42,971 --> 00:02:47,260
top while making people feel like the 
bottom has a chance of making it because

56
00:02:47,261 --> 00:02:49,690
poor people need hope to.
And secondly,

57
00:02:49,930 --> 00:02:52,810
you need a constant stream of new 
recruits joining and buying in,

58
00:02:52,811 --> 00:02:56,860
so make sure the path to wealth is paved
by constantly recruiting other people,

59
00:02:56,890 --> 00:02:57,723
not actually selling the product.
Besides your best customers are people 

60
00:03:00,371 --> 00:03:01,204
who work for you anyways.
You've made a good payout structure at 

61
00:03:03,481 --> 00:03:04,314
when people feel like making it is 
always a year or two away and they felt 

62
00:03:07,181 --> 00:03:08,320
like that for five years.

63
00:03:08,650 --> 00:03:09,483
That completes the fundamentals.
You've got your business plan up and 

64
00:03:11,381 --> 00:03:13,210
running and now you need some 
underlings.

65
00:03:13,390 --> 00:03:16,990
This is where we get to marketing.
Selling your pyramid scheme is all about

66
00:03:16,991 --> 00:03:19,810
messaging,
so focus on what your recruits one money

67
00:03:19,811 --> 00:03:22,390
and time freedom,
which brings us to step three,

68
00:03:22,391 --> 00:03:23,224
so a financial fantasy.
Here's some examples of what that might 

69
00:03:26,081 --> 00:03:28,960
look like.
If you could close your eyes and imagine

70
00:03:28,961 --> 00:03:32,260
your dream lifestyle,
your ideal combination of work and play.

71
00:03:32,530 --> 00:03:35,590
Choose the largest industry in the world
for the biggest opportunity.

72
00:03:35,770 --> 00:03:36,603
Imagine being part of a company that is 
created a life changing financial 

73
00:03:39,821 --> 00:03:41,350
freedom for people just like it.

74
00:03:41,930 --> 00:03:43,000
Hold on.
A golf course,

75
00:03:43,001 --> 00:03:45,730
half a million dollars,
$110,000

76
00:03:45,820 --> 00:03:47,350
a hundred thousand dollars a few 
thousand,

77
00:03:47,351 --> 00:03:48,184
a minimum of 10,000
but the freedom of owning an online 

78
00:03:50,471 --> 00:03:52,990
automated business that's priceless.

79
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:56,120
And bragging about it on the Internet,
even more priceless.

80
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:59,960
But sometimes this fantasy can backfire 
if people don't fully believe in.

81
00:04:00,020 --> 00:04:00,853
If that happens,
this top recruiter says you can still 

82
00:04:02,361 --> 00:04:03,194
close them by pointing out the problems 
in their lives and using it against 

83
00:04:06,141 --> 00:04:06,710
them.

84
00:04:06,710 --> 00:04:07,543
One of the biggest things that I teach 
is stack up enough problems that they 

85
00:04:10,371 --> 00:04:13,640
have in their personal life.
And when you compare it to the money,

86
00:04:13,710 --> 00:04:16,040
I say they're in.
Well,

87
00:04:16,041 --> 00:04:19,010
if you found out that right now that 
relationship is on the rocks,

88
00:04:19,030 --> 00:04:20,090
we were like,
Dang,

89
00:04:20,091 --> 00:04:21,080
dude.
Yeah,

90
00:04:21,110 --> 00:04:22,010
your relationship,
right?

91
00:04:22,011 --> 00:04:22,850
I mean,
are you okay with that?

92
00:04:22,851 --> 00:04:24,740
What's gonna happen with the kids?
Like who's going to get,

93
00:04:24,741 --> 00:04:28,070
who have you thought about that?
So like Joe [inaudible] joint custody.

94
00:04:28,071 --> 00:04:28,970
Is it going to be like,
yeah,

95
00:04:28,971 --> 00:04:31,070
she got to take half and all of a sudden
they're like,

96
00:04:31,071 --> 00:04:32,930
holy crap,
okay,

97
00:04:32,931 --> 00:04:34,310
yeah,
I need a fix this thing.

98
00:04:34,730 --> 00:04:36,050
Now all of a sudden I'm like,
okay,

99
00:04:36,051 --> 00:04:37,370
great.
Here's the solution.

100
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:38,793
All problems can be exploited including 
marital struggles and family problems 

101
00:04:42,310 --> 00:04:43,143
and all problems can be solved by 
joining as a final part of this vision 

102
00:04:46,871 --> 00:04:49,930
for the fantasy life till you recruits,
they aren't getting hired.

103
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:50,793
They're starting their own company.
You should call them independent 

104
00:04:53,051 --> 00:04:55,090
business owners for a couple of reasons.
First,

105
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:58,480
it minimizes your legal liability if 
they aren't full employees.

106
00:04:58,750 --> 00:04:59,583
Second,
if you're going to build a scam off 

107
00:05:00,461 --> 00:05:01,294
hope,
there's no better source than the 

108
00:05:01,871 --> 00:05:04,180
American dream of owning your own 
business.

109
00:05:04,570 --> 00:05:06,790
Now it's time to start thinking about 
audience.

110
00:05:07,300 --> 00:05:08,770
You don't want to try to appeal to 
everyone,

111
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:09,633
otherwise you will appeal to no one.
So you have to think about who you want 

112
00:05:12,701 --> 00:05:15,880
to target with your message,
which brings us to step four,

113
00:05:16,090 --> 00:05:18,220
the three key groups,
group one,

114
00:05:18,221 --> 00:05:20,470
family and friends.
Biggie smalls once said,

115
00:05:20,471 --> 00:05:22,630
keep your family and business completely
separated.

116
00:05:22,870 --> 00:05:24,550
But Steve Jobs said,
think different.

117
00:05:24,610 --> 00:05:27,130
So while everyone else is following 
common sense advice,

118
00:05:27,340 --> 00:05:28,173
you will make a family business and 
business and family like someone who 

119
00:05:31,061 --> 00:05:31,894
can't help but shoe horn in politics.
They every single conversation you want 

120
00:05:34,721 --> 00:05:35,554
to teach your followers that all 
conversations can be turned into sales 

121
00:05:37,811 --> 00:05:38,644
pitches group to young people.
Nobody is more gullible and sure of 

122
00:05:42,161 --> 00:05:44,950
themselves than an 18 to 22 year old.
So get them while they're hot,

123
00:05:45,190 --> 00:05:48,820
naive and young group three poor people,
whatever you do,

124
00:05:48,850 --> 00:05:52,870
don't waste money targeting big fish.
Rich people don't join pyramid schemes.

125
00:05:52,900 --> 00:05:55,840
They start them.
So instead you want to think differently

126
00:05:55,841 --> 00:05:59,750
and go for the poorest you can find.
You'd be shocked with hardworking people

127
00:05:59,751 --> 00:06:03,380
can scrape together if you tell them 
success is only a purchase away.

128
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:04,633
Immigrant families,
poor areas of town or going overseas to 

129
00:06:06,711 --> 00:06:07,544
find entire populations of poor people 
are all great options as this recruiter 

130
00:06:11,211 --> 00:06:12,044
will show.
There really is no such thing as not 

131
00:06:13,611 --> 00:06:14,444
having enough money.

132
00:06:14,780 --> 00:06:15,613
Nobody never doesn't have the money to 
go to the same job for emergency 

133
00:06:25,730 --> 00:06:27,020
purchasing operation.

134
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:30,393
Look,
I know it's your first time and by this 

135
00:06:31,661 --> 00:06:32,494
point you may feel a little sick about 
all this exploitation and there's no 

136
00:06:34,841 --> 00:06:35,674
shame in that.
Queasiness is just ethics leaving the 

137
00:06:37,511 --> 00:06:38,560
body.
But don't worry,

138
00:06:38,561 --> 00:06:42,490
after your fifth time delivering empty 
promises to the hopeful eyes of a single

139
00:06:42,491 --> 00:06:45,550
mother of two,
you really don't feel anything anymore.

140
00:06:46,030 --> 00:06:46,863
And so you know,
many of your business counterparts have 

141
00:06:48,311 --> 00:06:50,860
already achieved success targeting 
Hispanics.

142
00:06:51,010 --> 00:06:52,860
So make sure you're not late to the 
party though.

143
00:06:53,140 --> 00:06:55,570
And don't forget to utilize technology 
as you do.

144
00:06:55,571 --> 00:06:56,404
So with Google ads,
you can target the bottom 50% of 

145
00:06:58,931 --> 00:07:01,180
society.
Choose your target demographic,

146
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:03,880
lower that add rate,
and away you go.

147
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:06,970
So you've got your fundamentals,
you've got your marketing and recruiting

148
00:07:06,971 --> 00:07:08,710
done,
you've got your Google ads running,

149
00:07:08,890 --> 00:07:12,430
but soon your workers may get burnt out.
And to extend their mileage.

150
00:07:12,460 --> 00:07:15,460
It's important to learn how to manage 
discontent workers.

151
00:07:15,670 --> 00:07:16,503
This is a vital part of any company,
but especially one where your employees 

152
00:07:19,481 --> 00:07:20,314
are doing all the recruiting and buying.
And most of them aren't making any 

153
00:07:23,081 --> 00:07:24,850
money.
Step five,

154
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:26,073
the training attempt failure event loop.
The way to keep your independent 

155
00:07:29,651 --> 00:07:32,140
business owners committed isn't to make 
them happy,

156
00:07:32,410 --> 00:07:35,620
but rather keep them thinking success is
right around the corner.

157
00:07:35,830 --> 00:07:38,890
You can do this by first innercising 
that proper training takes time.

158
00:07:38,891 --> 00:07:39,724
You'll tell them that learning to be an 
effective leader is a process and takes 

159
00:07:42,161 --> 00:07:42,994
practice.
This is followed by an attempt by them 

160
00:07:44,531 --> 00:07:46,240
to recruit and sell with minimal 
results.

161
00:07:46,241 --> 00:07:47,074
They don't pay much.
They will get down on themselves for 

162
00:07:48,551 --> 00:07:52,240
their failure at which point you need to
make sure to step in and throw a massive

163
00:07:52,241 --> 00:07:53,074
pump up event or meeting.
It's imperative that each of these 

164
00:07:55,661 --> 00:07:56,494
meetings,
do you have a couple examples of people 

165
00:07:57,521 --> 00:07:58,354
who have achieved monetary success with 
your scheme because this will signal to 

166
00:08:01,721 --> 00:08:02,554
everyone else that they can make it.
Prop up those winners on stage and let 

167
00:08:05,861 --> 00:08:08,140
the survivorship bias do the talking.

168
00:08:09,970 --> 00:08:11,620
That was awesome.

169
00:08:22,110 --> 00:08:24,240
Anybody can do it should be your 
message.

170
00:08:24,780 --> 00:08:25,650
In reality.
Of course,

171
00:08:25,651 --> 00:08:30,060
studies of over 350 of your competitors 
have found that 99.6%

172
00:08:30,061 --> 00:08:33,180
of recruits lose money.
But we don't have to tell them that.

173
00:08:33,570 --> 00:08:35,330
Just keep focusing on the winning.

174
00:08:35,590 --> 00:08:36,423
We're going to,
which so much you may even get tired of 

175
00:08:38,681 --> 00:08:39,880
winning.
I just say,

176
00:08:39,881 --> 00:08:41,290
please,
please,

177
00:08:41,560 --> 00:08:44,680
it's two bucks winning.
We can't take it anymore.

178
00:08:45,350 --> 00:08:48,360
And unfortunately,
some people may get tired of winning and

179
00:08:48,361 --> 00:08:50,910
if that happens,
it's time to move to step six.

180
00:08:51,180 --> 00:08:52,013
Cut off the bad apples.
Legal pyramid schemes eventually get a 

181
00:08:55,170 --> 00:08:57,360
reputation because they all resemble one
another.

182
00:08:57,390 --> 00:08:59,520
And no matter how much you convince 
people that you're different,

183
00:08:59,550 --> 00:09:02,160
you will get a bad reputation in the 
world at large,

184
00:09:02,161 --> 00:09:04,260
which can in turn discourage your 
recruits.

185
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:05,393
The way to get around this is not by 
denying the bad opinions are out there 

186
00:09:08,010 --> 00:09:10,770
instead,
except misdirect and discredit them.

187
00:09:10,860 --> 00:09:12,900
In the past,
people want stock.

188
00:09:12,901 --> 00:09:15,610
The earth was flat,
seems pretty ridiculous,

189
00:09:15,611 --> 00:09:16,540
right?
At the time,

190
00:09:17,050 --> 00:09:17,883
people didn't know any differently.
The same can be said for the direct 

191
00:09:20,741 --> 00:09:22,950
selling and multilevel marketing 
industry.

192
00:09:22,951 --> 00:09:27,550
So when comparing legitimate direct 
selling companies to a pyramid scheme or

193
00:09:27,610 --> 00:09:31,870
any type of scam will seem as ridiculous
as the earth being flat.

194
00:09:33,030 --> 00:09:36,120
You've done a good job when you don't 
have to look over your workers shoulders

195
00:09:36,330 --> 00:09:39,450
you've taught them to monitor for hate 
themselves and they will go out of their

196
00:09:39,451 --> 00:09:43,320
own way to avoid negative opinions about
your company all on their own.

197
00:09:44,610 --> 00:09:48,460
Once you have these six steps handled,
you will at last be a successful illegal

198
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:50,910
pyramid scheme,
controlling millions of workers,

199
00:09:50,911 --> 00:09:51,744
paying pennies on the dollar for worth 
this products you sell back to your 

200
00:09:54,241 --> 00:09:55,074
workers at triple the price workers who,
well trying to make their own fortune 

201
00:09:58,011 --> 00:10:02,450
don't realize they're busy building 
doors off nothing but hope alone.

202
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:03,313
You have designed a wealth 
redistribution system of such hubris 

203
00:10:06,140 --> 00:10:10,400
that Marx himself ought to be envious 
except your taking from the mediocre and

204
00:10:10,401 --> 00:10:13,080
giving to those who truly deserve it.
You,

205
00:10:13,430 --> 00:10:17,750
you who have sacrificed everything,
ethics and all for this dream,

206
00:10:18,170 --> 00:10:20,750
this dream of being successful,
of having it all.

207
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:22,910
And finally you can taste it.

208
00:10:23,970 --> 00:10:24,803
Ah,
ah,

209
00:10:24,990 --> 00:10:25,910
ah,
ah,

210
00:10:26,140 --> 00:10:27,110
ah,
ah,

211
00:10:27,780 --> 00:10:32,010
ah,
ah,

212
00:10:39,910 --> 00:10:40,743
oh,

213
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:42,860
oh got a little carried away there.

214
00:10:48,740 --> 00:10:49,573
I've got a few more things to say at the
end of this video and also a word from 

215
00:10:51,891 --> 00:10:52,724
our president.
But first we have to talk about today's 

216
00:10:55,661 --> 00:10:58,490
sponsor skillshare.
Do you like learning things?

217
00:10:58,670 --> 00:11:00,590
I think you do.
I do too.

218
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:02,870
And skillshare is a great place to do 
that.

219
00:11:03,140 --> 00:11:08,120
It's got thousands of classes and 
tutorials from experts to help you learn

220
00:11:08,121 --> 00:11:09,590
things.
Things like animation,

221
00:11:09,620 --> 00:11:11,450
things like editing,
things like photography.

222
00:11:12,140 --> 00:11:15,080
But mostly for me,
I liked the editing part but um,

223
00:11:15,290 --> 00:11:17,390
pretty much you can find whatever you 
want.

224
00:11:17,570 --> 00:11:18,403
If you can think of it.
They probably have it even stuff from 

225
00:11:20,721 --> 00:11:22,400
people like Chris Cause that in a 
nutshell,

226
00:11:22,430 --> 00:11:24,450
I think that's how you say his name.
Um,

227
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:27,890
they did a great class on breaking down 
their animation style.

228
00:11:28,130 --> 00:11:30,650
It's really cool.
So go check them out.

229
00:11:30,710 --> 00:11:31,543
Their annual subscription is less than 
$10 a month and if you use Promo code

Okay,

234
00:11:45,411 --> 00:11:47,960
so back to pyramid schemes real quick 
before you go,

235
00:11:48,390 --> 00:11:49,800
pause,
pause.

236
00:11:49,950 --> 00:11:51,770
I'm at the end of editing this video.
You probably could.

237
00:11:52,540 --> 00:11:54,280
Um,
but I realized

238
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:59,050
I didn't say explicitly that this is 
sarcastic or kind of sad tire.

239
00:11:59,350 --> 00:12:02,950
I know I probably shouldn't have to say 
that because it's rather obvious but um,

240
00:12:03,070 --> 00:12:05,500
I don't know if 2019 we'll have sarcasm 
anymore.

241
00:12:05,501 --> 00:12:06,880
So yes,
yes,

242
00:12:06,970 --> 00:12:08,890
it is sad to her.
Don't do that.

243
00:12:08,891 --> 00:12:12,310
Don't start a pyramid scheme.
I just wanted to be explicit about it so

244
00:12:12,311 --> 00:12:14,100
no one could misunderstand me.
Um,

245
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:15,113
I want to just point you towards some 
amazing resources that I found really 

246
00:12:17,651 --> 00:12:20,590
useful while doing research and creating
this video.

247
00:12:20,620 --> 00:12:23,590
Originally I was going to do it a very 
serious look at,

248
00:12:23,650 --> 00:12:24,510
um,
you know,

249
00:12:24,820 --> 00:12:25,653
multilevel marketing,
that sort of thing and I found super 

250
00:12:27,731 --> 00:12:32,620
useful the following three resources for
maybe a first,

251
00:12:32,621 --> 00:12:34,810
the dream podcast.
Go check it out.

252
00:12:34,811 --> 00:12:35,644
It's pretty new,
incredible deep dive research if you 

253
00:12:39,701 --> 00:12:41,710
like,
kind of getting into the nitty gritty.

254
00:12:41,740 --> 00:12:42,610
That's what those people do.

255
00:12:42,940 --> 00:12:45,820
Also Robert Fitts Patrick,
he's an mlm experts,

256
00:12:45,821 --> 00:12:48,110
been working on it more than 15 years.
Um,

257
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:48,993
he let me interview him.
He's been a great resource throughout 

258
00:12:50,501 --> 00:12:51,790
this,
so I thank him,

259
00:12:52,070 --> 00:12:53,740
uh,
Christine Richards,

260
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:55,230
Richard,
uh,

261
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:56,073
of Orion research.
She also let me kind of talk to her for 

262
00:12:58,640 --> 00:13:01,360
awhile.
She's also an expert on mlms.

263
00:13:01,390 --> 00:13:02,223
So go check out her research and what 
she's done as well as she had a great 

264
00:13:05,141 --> 00:13:06,580
interview on quotes,
the Raven.

265
00:13:07,030 --> 00:13:09,190
And then finally Dr.
John Taylor.

266
00:13:09,430 --> 00:13:12,640
He was one of the main sources that I 
cited here of,

267
00:13:12,660 --> 00:13:13,493
from the FTC government where he tracked
how often people succeed in these type 

268
00:13:17,691 --> 00:13:21,190
of like legal pyramid schemes.
He is an incredible resource as well.

269
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:22,233
And now I just want to,
I just want to leave you with this 

270
00:13:24,581 --> 00:13:27,050
little gym that I found,
um,

271
00:13:27,820 --> 00:13:30,520
from our president.
If you're in America,

272
00:13:31,260 --> 00:13:35,490
ladies and gentlemen,
Americans need a new plan.

273
00:13:35,670 --> 00:13:39,540
The trump network wants to give millions
of people renewed hope.

274
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:40,433
Let's get out of this recession right 
now with cutting edge health and 

275
00:13:43,971 --> 00:13:44,804
wellness formulas and a system where you
can develop your own financial 

276
00:13:47,781 --> 00:13:48,614
independence.
The trump network offers people the 

277
00:13:51,231 --> 00:13:54,050
opportunity to achieve their American 
dream.

278
00:13:54,470 --> 00:13:57,740
I'm still looking for dreams.
I'm doing damn well in life,

279
00:13:57,770 --> 00:13:59,570
but I'm still looking for the dream.
