1
00:00:03,570 --> 00:00:06,380
Let me break it down.
Jay High School,

2
00:00:07,110 --> 00:00:08,730
they don't come through their door and 
be good cop.

3
00:00:08,731 --> 00:00:10,200
Bad Cop.
Don't fall for that.

4
00:00:10,290 --> 00:00:11,123
All right.

5
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:17,520
In Hollywood,
everything important in an interrogation

6
00:00:17,550 --> 00:00:21,270
is seen or heard.
The cops grimace allowed yelling,

7
00:00:21,510 --> 00:00:24,360
treating a suspect hostile.
The light that's way too bright,

8
00:00:24,780 --> 00:00:26,970
but in a real interrogation,
it's flipped around.

9
00:00:27,210 --> 00:00:31,170
Everything important is unseen,
unheard on the surface.

10
00:00:31,171 --> 00:00:34,770
Real interrogations look boring.
The cop is nice to you.

11
00:00:34,771 --> 00:00:36,910
They give you a drink,
they dressed in plain clothes.

12
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:37,973
It's almost disarming,
especially if this is more of what you 

13
00:00:40,171 --> 00:00:41,004
were expecting,

14
00:00:43,770 --> 00:00:47,490
but that's the point.
Under the boring disarming surface of an

15
00:00:47,491 --> 00:00:48,324
interrogation,
you find a whole host of psychological 

16
00:00:50,641 --> 00:00:54,090
traps and mental tricks that are 
designed to make you confess.

17
00:00:54,990 --> 00:00:55,823
It starts from the moment you walk in.
Every inch of an interrogation room has 

18
00:00:59,101 --> 00:01:01,830
been designed to make you feel isolated 
and powerless.

19
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:03,930
The room is small,
cramped.

20
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:06,390
The walls are blank and there are no 
windows.

21
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:07,253
You'll be placed in an uncomfortable 
straight back off in metal chair while 

22
00:01:09,691 --> 00:01:11,550
the cops chair,
we'll be able to roll.

23
00:01:11,610 --> 00:01:15,480
This becomes important later on.
The next move is a hurdle that cops have

24
00:01:15,481 --> 00:01:17,070
to get over.
When you go to jail,

25
00:01:17,071 --> 00:01:20,040
a cop is legally required to tell you 
you have the right to shut up.

26
00:01:20,370 --> 00:01:22,950
This actually turns out to be the only 
great advice you're going to get.

27
00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:26,430
Talking to cops is always a bad move and
for the cop,

28
00:01:26,431 --> 00:01:27,264
what this means is that their first 
priority is making you ignore this 

29
00:01:29,911 --> 00:01:32,160
advice and go against everything you've 
ever heard.

30
00:01:32,730 --> 00:01:34,890
They have to convince you to play the 
game with them.

31
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:38,040
The first questions are deliberately not
about the investigation.

32
00:01:38,070 --> 00:01:40,920
They want to appear trustworthy so that 
you'll talk to them about the case.

33
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:46,280
41 point mama stay downtown.
I don't think I've tried that one yet.

34
00:01:48,110 --> 00:01:48,943
I'm a big coffee.
I don't know if you're a coffee guy 

35
00:01:51,460 --> 00:01:52,950
right in front of us,
so no,

36
00:01:52,951 --> 00:01:53,990
I appreciate that.
All right,

37
00:01:53,991 --> 00:01:55,670
go ahead.
There's a plane going up.

38
00:01:57,310 --> 00:01:59,060
You get hungry or anything else,
just let me know.

39
00:01:59,061 --> 00:01:59,894
Okay.
How come you get more than one bill 

40
00:02:00,951 --> 00:02:01,784
name?
You know,

41
00:02:03,210 --> 00:02:04,043
my uncles and my grandfather,
I got to three middle name and that's 

42
00:02:08,281 --> 00:02:10,190
really because my parents thought I was 
gonna be an only child.

43
00:02:10,290 --> 00:02:11,100
Amy,
after everybody.

44
00:02:11,100 --> 00:02:14,070
So I get named after your grandfather 
and two uncles,

45
00:02:14,071 --> 00:02:15,930
so I know what you're,
I know what you're going through there.

46
00:02:15,931 --> 00:02:17,320
Cause my initials,
I get teased about.

47
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:18,473
The other goal behind these innocent 
questions is to establish a behavioral 

48
00:02:20,881 --> 00:02:23,280
baseline.
They want to see how you act when you're

49
00:02:23,281 --> 00:02:25,110
telling the truth.
Finally,

50
00:02:25,111 --> 00:02:27,570
when they're ready,
they'll ask you something like this.

51
00:02:27,730 --> 00:02:29,410
Well let's,
let's do this.

52
00:02:30,130 --> 00:02:33,190
You sound like you will.
You won't talk to me.

53
00:02:33,670 --> 00:02:36,520
Okay?
I want to hear what you have to say.

54
00:02:36,521 --> 00:02:39,400
But before Ashley Quish,
she got to know your rights.

55
00:02:39,401 --> 00:02:42,250
Okay?
You have the right to remain silent.

56
00:02:42,990 --> 00:02:43,823
Uh,
what this says here is that I've read 

57
00:02:46,421 --> 00:02:47,750
you your rights.
Do you understand them?

58
00:02:49,070 --> 00:02:51,290
Once you're talking,
they'll first get a statement about what

59
00:02:51,291 --> 00:02:52,124
happened after hearing it.
If the cop thinks you might have done 

60
00:02:54,261 --> 00:02:55,094
it.
If the facts aren't lining up or if 

61
00:02:56,001 --> 00:02:56,834
you're acting shady,
they may move to the accusation phase 

62
00:02:59,470 --> 00:03:00,303
and the accusation phase.
They will confidently accuse you of the 

63
00:03:02,261 --> 00:03:04,780
crime and the cop will say,
in no uncertain terms,

64
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:05,913
you did it.
We know you did it and we've got 

65
00:03:07,271 --> 00:03:08,110
evidence for it.

66
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:12,300
Your vehicle drove up the side of 
Jessica Lewis House,

67
00:03:13,740 --> 00:03:18,740
your boots walked to the back of Jessica
Lloyd's House on the evening of the 28th

68
00:03:19,681 --> 00:03:20,514
and 29th of January.
You and I both know you were at Jessica 

69
00:03:25,050 --> 00:03:27,570
Lloyd toughs and I need to know why,

70
00:03:30,610 --> 00:03:31,443
but here's the catch.
They'll claim they have evidence for 

71
00:03:33,941 --> 00:03:36,100
your guilt even when they don't.

72
00:03:36,580 --> 00:03:37,413
This nosy neighbor or whatever we're 
going to call on him has monitored and 

73
00:03:41,771 --> 00:03:43,710
I'm not going to tell you how.
Okay,

74
00:03:44,010 --> 00:03:48,370
just think about it.
With today's technology monitored,

75
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:49,833
what was going on in front of this 
residence that they were calling to 

76
00:03:52,451 --> 00:03:55,990
complain about until police arrive and I
can prove it.

77
00:03:55,991 --> 00:03:58,300
I can go in front of the judge and say,
hey look bro,

78
00:03:58,301 --> 00:04:00,670
we want to fucking do you want us to 
play this video?

79
00:04:00,850 --> 00:04:02,770
You want us to show you the fingerprint 
results?

80
00:04:02,950 --> 00:04:05,820
You want us to show you the gre test on 
on this gentleman,

81
00:04:05,821 --> 00:04:07,870
I did not have a firearm in mine hand.

82
00:04:08,460 --> 00:04:11,100
The goal here is to make you think that 
you're already caught.

83
00:04:11,101 --> 00:04:11,934
They already have you.
Why bother resisting and lying about it 

84
00:04:14,161 --> 00:04:16,470
when they already know you did it?
Just confess.

85
00:04:17,370 --> 00:04:18,650
So it's,
it's,

86
00:04:18,710 --> 00:04:19,543
it's a it.
It's one of the easiest investigations 

87
00:04:21,421 --> 00:04:22,254
I've had.
It's fucking there and you can't lie 

88
00:04:24,271 --> 00:04:25,104
about that,
bro.

89
00:04:25,230 --> 00:04:29,190
You can't tell us how you then fucking 
fire that fourth shot anymore.

90
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:31,440
You can't tell us.
We can prove otherwise

91
00:04:31,620 --> 00:04:32,453
during this phase of the interrogation,
the interrogator doesn't want you to 

92
00:04:35,281 --> 00:04:38,370
deny the crime even though you'll want 
to vocalize denials,

93
00:04:38,371 --> 00:04:41,790
reinforces your position.
So Cox make an interesting move.

94
00:04:42,060 --> 00:04:44,880
They try to not let you vocalize Denalis
in the first place.

95
00:04:44,881 --> 00:04:47,550
If possible,
they'll often interrupt you or not.

96
00:04:47,551 --> 00:04:49,890
Stop talking to allow brakes to let you 
speak up.

97
00:04:50,370 --> 00:04:51,203
Instead,
they'll keep the pressure on by 

98
00:04:52,171 --> 00:04:55,320
reinforcing the idea that they a hundred
percent already have you caught.

99
00:04:55,590 --> 00:04:57,870
I'm giving you an opportunity to listen 
to me.

100
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:00,920
Listen to me,
listen to,

101
00:05:00,980 --> 00:05:01,813
I did not have a firearm in mind.
We can prove that we're beyond that 

102
00:05:04,501 --> 00:05:05,334
point,
buddy.

103
00:05:05,540 --> 00:05:07,150
We'll be on that man.
No,

104
00:05:07,190 --> 00:05:09,960
they did not do what you think I did.
I know you did.

105
00:05:10,010 --> 00:05:11,890
Were passed,
passed.

106
00:05:12,620 --> 00:05:13,910
You know it.
They know it.

107
00:05:13,911 --> 00:05:18,380
Let's just drop the charade.
The next phase is themed development.

108
00:05:18,890 --> 00:05:19,723
After accusing someone,
the cops will try to provide themes to 

109
00:05:21,741 --> 00:05:25,040
offer moral or psychological 
justifications for the crime.

110
00:05:25,430 --> 00:05:26,263
Nobody's going to confess if they think 
it makes them look bad or their 

111
00:05:28,101 --> 00:05:28,934
dignities at stake.
So the cops want to give you a way to 

112
00:05:31,221 --> 00:05:35,060
lose without losing face.
This will never be used in your favor.

113
00:05:35,061 --> 00:05:36,950
When the confession goes to trial,
of course,

114
00:05:37,070 --> 00:05:39,470
these are simply mind games that are 
used to get the confession.

115
00:05:39,790 --> 00:05:42,430
We sort of believe that it could have 
been a fucking accident.

116
00:05:42,850 --> 00:05:45,010
It could have been accidental discharge.
Okay.

117
00:05:45,020 --> 00:05:47,280
But when you don't,
when you're completely denying it,

118
00:05:47,281 --> 00:05:49,210
and then I got to think another way,
Bro,

119
00:05:49,540 --> 00:05:51,190
I don't believe you're a cold blooded 
killer.

120
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:53,380
No,
I don't believe that at all.

121
00:05:54,750 --> 00:05:57,200
Nothing's suggested it to me.
I think you're a smart guy,

122
00:05:57,201 --> 00:05:58,034
and I think you got involved in a 
situation that you probably shouldn't 

123
00:06:00,231 --> 00:06:01,064
have.
There's a difference between you going 

124
00:06:02,301 --> 00:06:05,740
in and saying,
I'm gonna kill somebody and you're going

125
00:06:05,741 --> 00:06:07,880
in.
I'm trying to help somebody,

126
00:06:07,881 --> 00:06:11,150
and then shit goes bad.
They're just waiting different things as

127
00:06:11,151 --> 00:06:13,400
we're talking about.
What other options?

128
00:06:14,110 --> 00:06:16,670
I don't think you want the cold blooded 
psychopaths function.

129
00:06:18,140 --> 00:06:21,050
I might be wrong because I don't get me 
wrong.

130
00:06:21,051 --> 00:06:24,230
I've met guys who actually kind of 
enjoyed the notoriety,

131
00:06:24,740 --> 00:06:26,660
got off on it.
I don't see that.

132
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:29,150
If I saw that you have when he'd be back
in,

133
00:06:29,151 --> 00:06:33,560
you're talking to you quite frankly,
but maybe I'm wrong.

134
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:35,060
Maybe you got me fooled.
I don't know.

135
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:38,620
This is where most people start to 
break.

136
00:06:38,860 --> 00:06:42,220
Most people often go into a passive mood
when they're about to confess,

137
00:06:42,370 --> 00:06:43,203
looking beat down and acting quiet.
This is the first time that you'll 

138
00:06:46,031 --> 00:06:46,864
seriously start considering confession.
There's even a physical tell called the 

139
00:06:49,511 --> 00:06:52,810
surrender position that cops look for to
know when you're about to confess.

140
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:55,180
It looks like this.
When the cop sees this,

141
00:06:55,181 --> 00:06:59,110
he will continue to reiterate all the 
themes that have been developed so far.

142
00:06:59,710 --> 00:07:00,543
We know you did it.
We have evidence and good guys come 

143
00:07:03,161 --> 00:07:03,994
clean.
In addition to deploying psychological 

144
00:07:05,861 --> 00:07:08,290
measures,
the cup full also deploy physical ones.

145
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:09,393
Remember that the cops chair can roll 
and during this time he will often move 

146
00:07:12,851 --> 00:07:13,684
closer.
In order to ramp up the tension in the 

147
00:07:15,551 --> 00:07:16,384
room,
you will feel trapped like there's 

148
00:07:17,831 --> 00:07:18,664
nowhere to go and meanwhile a physically
intimidated cop is telling you that you 

149
00:07:23,050 --> 00:07:25,930
have to confess.
You must confess.

150
00:07:26,290 --> 00:07:27,123
Finally,
there's a moment when the tension that 

151
00:07:28,151 --> 00:07:30,670
has been building up for hours finally 
breaks.

152
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:31,750
You can almost see it

153
00:07:37,910 --> 00:07:42,910
minimizing sort of way that'd be do 
that.

154
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:49,670
Wow.
You start out by telling the truth.

155
00:07:55,190 --> 00:07:56,390
Okay,
okay,

156
00:07:58,950 --> 00:08:00,220
where is she man?

157
00:08:04,390 --> 00:08:05,223
And once the cop gets their confession,
it's all over your chance of being let 

158
00:08:07,631 --> 00:08:08,890
off.
Go to almost zero.

159
00:08:08,891 --> 00:08:09,724
Your plea deals.
Get a lot worse and you have gained 

160
00:08:10,841 --> 00:08:11,674
absolutely nothing from the exchange 
except for the knowledge of just how 

161
00:08:14,321 --> 00:08:17,170
good cops are at beating you in the 
interrogation room.

162
00:08:17,910 --> 00:08:21,330
I just think I'd look guilty if I hired 
a lawyer.

163
00:08:21,930 --> 00:08:22,763
Actually,
it's getting arrested that makes people 

164
00:08:25,561 --> 00:08:27,360
look guilty.
Even the innocent ones,

165
00:08:27,361 --> 00:08:31,800
an innocent people get arrested every 
day and they find themselves in a little

166
00:08:31,801 --> 00:08:35,730
room with a detective who acts like he's
their best friend.

167
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:37,170
Talked to me,
he says,

168
00:08:37,630 --> 00:08:39,840
help me clear this thing up,
but you don't need a lawyer.

169
00:08:39,841 --> 00:08:42,090
Only guilty people need lawyers and 
boom,

170
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:44,190
hey,
that's when it all goes south.

171
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:48,960
It's time to come clean.
Are you following me on these platforms?

172
00:08:48,961 --> 00:08:51,960
We have communities on reddit and 
discord and the bigger they grow,

173
00:08:51,961 --> 00:08:53,610

174
00:08:53,611 --> 00:08:56,190

twitter and Instagram,

00:08:56,191 --> 00:08:57,870

stuff.

176
00:08:58,380 --> 00:09:00,180
Finally,
thank you to my patrons,

177
00:09:00,210 --> 00:09:01,770
guys,
if you're not a patron,

178
00:09:01,950 --> 00:09:02,783
please.
It helps my life so much to be making a 

179
00:09:05,461 --> 00:09:08,190
little bit of money from this channel.
I don't need to make a lot,

180
00:09:08,191 --> 00:09:11,340
but every little bit counts so much.
So thank you guys.

181
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:12,193
Everyone who is supporting me,
music producers are as always linked 

182
00:09:15,091 --> 00:09:17,760
here and below.
And I will see you guys next time.

183
00:09:19,670 --> 00:09:20,600
Got Conviction

184
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:21,980
of your conviction,
man.

185
00:09:21,981 --> 00:09:26,981
It's simple addition and the dentis with
has gone to put you in prison.

186
00:09:27,890 --> 00:09:31,640
So give us a sentence talking about Yo 
contrition.

187
00:09:31,670 --> 00:09:32,503
It's just a simple admission that may 
help yo condition and that's the story 

188
00:09:36,561 --> 00:09:39,710
of how they get you.
Here's one final admonition.

189
00:09:39,711 --> 00:09:42,980
Don't talk without a lawyer.
