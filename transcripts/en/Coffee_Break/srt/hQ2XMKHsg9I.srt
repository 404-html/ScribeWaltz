1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:04,230
The stories we tell ourselves,
echo affecting our behavior and what our

2
00:00:04,231 --> 00:00:08,280
future stories will eventually say.
Rebounding from expectations to action,

3
00:00:08,430 --> 00:00:09,263
bringing to life.
We are creatures that live on 

4
00:00:11,401 --> 00:00:12,234
narratives,
entertained by the stories we hear and 

5
00:00:14,251 --> 00:00:17,940
directed by the stories we believe about
ourselves and our world.

6
00:00:18,810 --> 00:00:19,643
For example,
if you're convinced you're not a runner 

7
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:22,193
and you don't enjoy running,
you will prove yourself right because 

8
00:00:24,151 --> 00:00:25,950
you're unlikely to lace up every morning
to run.

9
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:29,760
If you don't believe the goal you're 
chasing is attainable and that will lead

10
00:00:29,761 --> 00:00:30,594
you to drop out of high school cross 
country after less than a couple of 

11
00:00:32,701 --> 00:00:35,130
weeks,
siding dubious claims of an inability to

12
00:00:35,131 --> 00:00:38,100
get up early enough in the morning.
Alternatively,

13
00:00:38,130 --> 00:00:41,490
if four years later,
you're a silly experiment in college kid

14
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:42,353
and you try playing a sound bite in your
head everyday that despite your history 

15
00:00:44,791 --> 00:00:45,624
of failure at rapid bipedal locomotion,
you're actually a runner at heart and 

16
00:00:48,841 --> 00:00:49,674
you love it.

17
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:51,840
In that case,
since you're a runner who loves running,

18
00:00:51,990 --> 00:00:52,823
you're probably going to get out there,
which given a few months training will 

19
00:00:55,261 --> 00:00:57,630
make your fictional narrative come to 
fruition.

20
00:00:58,230 --> 00:01:01,710
I'm bringing this up because it's 
valuable to know that to some extent you

21
00:01:01,711 --> 00:01:05,760
can decide what stories you believe and 
in turn live with meaning.

22
00:01:05,761 --> 00:01:06,594
If you want to say pick up the guitar,
it might be worth mentally doing some 

23
00:01:09,331 --> 00:01:10,164
work to tell yourself a story that 
you're a guitar player instead of 

24
00:01:12,781 --> 00:01:16,050
thinking of yourself as just another 
person with a guitar in the closet.

25
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:17,393
This shift in mindset,
if you believe it can have a profound 

26
00:01:19,651 --> 00:01:20,484
impact in the way that you relate to 
that instrument and how much you 

27
00:01:22,861 --> 00:01:23,694
practice over the next few years.
It's worth noting here that this isn't 

28
00:01:26,821 --> 00:01:30,180
some secret that will miraculously make 
you able to achieve anything.

29
00:01:30,390 --> 00:01:31,223
This is just a way to use the power that
stories have in making our identity to 

30
00:01:34,351 --> 00:01:35,184
help you get into the right type of 
behavioral patterns for the results you 

31
00:01:37,561 --> 00:01:38,394
want.
More than just at the beginner level 

32
00:01:39,751 --> 00:01:42,900
though at the highest level of 
competition and performance,

33
00:01:43,110 --> 00:01:43,943
storytelling seems to matter the most 
because there's a level of focus 

34
00:01:46,531 --> 00:01:50,580
required that almost demands a narrative
that has nothing to do with reality.

35
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:51,893
Here's Arnold Schwarzenegger talking 
about this concept on Tim Ferriss's 

36
00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:57,090
podcast for how he won his first junior,
Mr Europe.

37
00:01:57,510 --> 00:01:58,343
It was so clear to me that you were 
going to win and that you knew or 

38
00:02:00,691 --> 00:02:03,690
believed you were going to win.
Your face was so confident.

39
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:08,660
Where did that confidence come from?
My confidence came from my vision.

40
00:02:09,050 --> 00:02:12,110
If you have a very clear vision of where
you want to go,

41
00:02:12,950 --> 00:02:17,950
then the rest of it is much easier 
because you know always why you training

42
00:02:18,131 --> 00:02:18,964
five hours a day,
you always know why you pushing and 

43
00:02:20,861 --> 00:02:21,694
going through the pain barrier.
I see myself clearly on that stage 

44
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:30,720
winning the Mr Universe as cms itself,
very clearly of getting the trophy,

45
00:02:31,081 --> 00:02:32,640
standing,
debit the trophy,

46
00:02:32,641 --> 00:02:33,474
raising it above my head,
and having hundreds of bodybuilders 

47
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:38,710
around me on stage,
uh,

48
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:39,593
looking up and idolizing me,
including the thousands of people that 

49
00:02:41,701 --> 00:02:42,534
are watching the event.
So there was always made clear vision 

50
00:02:44,460 --> 00:02:46,790
and that always inspired me,
uh,

51
00:02:46,890 --> 00:02:47,820
to go all out.

52
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:51,530
Now he relates to this concept through 
visualization and vision,

53
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:52,393
but this is just the kind of 
storytelling about the future and this 

54
00:02:54,831 --> 00:02:55,664
deliberate storytelling was the key to 
his success because before he had won 

55
00:02:59,140 --> 00:03:01,450
first competition,
if you were an outsider looking in,

56
00:03:01,690 --> 00:03:05,410
arnold had no reason to be that 
confident except for his internal story.

57
00:03:05,710 --> 00:03:07,450
He was enrolled in the military,
he was poor,

58
00:03:07,451 --> 00:03:10,960
and he wasn't bodyboarding full time.
Most impartial observers would have seen

59
00:03:10,961 --> 00:03:11,794
his dream is a bad bet,
but you can't train five hours a day on 

60
00:03:14,891 --> 00:03:15,724
a bad bet.
You can only train that much if you 

61
00:03:17,441 --> 00:03:19,690
believe that you're destined to be 
number one.

62
00:03:20,350 --> 00:03:21,183
And he believed that and because he 
believed that he trained as if it were 

63
00:03:23,891 --> 00:03:24,724
true,
eventually making the story as true in 

64
00:03:26,321 --> 00:03:30,730
the real world as it was in his head.
Now this doesn't just apply to athletics

65
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:31,593
or skills,
that's just a sphere where it's easiest 

66
00:03:33,101 --> 00:03:34,180
to see how this works.

67
00:03:34,420 --> 00:03:36,880
The same is true of our beliefs about 
the world.

68
00:03:37,270 --> 00:03:39,220
If you tell yourself that the world is 
cruel,

69
00:03:39,250 --> 00:03:40,083
you might subconsciously explain away 
good things happening is just setting 

70
00:03:42,791 --> 00:03:43,624
you up to fall harder to later and 
explain bad things happening as part of 

71
00:03:46,511 --> 00:03:50,620
a raked chaotic system that inexorably 
is leading you to a cold grave.

72
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:52,810
You can also tell a much different 
story,

73
00:03:52,990 --> 00:03:53,823
but the world is on the whole good,
which will lead you to a much different 

74
00:03:56,231 --> 00:03:57,064
interpretation of the data,
a much brighter and happier 

75
00:03:59,411 --> 00:04:01,900
interpretation I might add.
And it's your choice.

76
00:04:01,901 --> 00:04:02,734
What narrative you believe,
even in the face of seemingly difficult 

77
00:04:05,260 --> 00:04:06,093
experience.
Take Malala who chose to believe in a 

78
00:04:08,681 --> 00:04:12,850
narrative of love and forgiveness even 
after being attacked by the Taliban.

79
00:04:13,460 --> 00:04:14,293
So you were shot in the face at 15 years
old and you have no anger towards the 

80
00:04:20,451 --> 00:04:22,550
man who shot you.
How is that possible?

81
00:04:22,980 --> 00:04:25,870
I think they made a big mistake,
um,

82
00:04:26,130 --> 00:04:26,963
because I was fighting for the right of 
education right from the beginning when 

83
00:04:29,551 --> 00:04:31,530
the Taliban stop cars from going to 
school.

84
00:04:31,890 --> 00:04:35,550
But I had this little bit of fear that 
what would happen to me?

85
00:04:35,551 --> 00:04:39,180
How would I feel if someone it takes me.
But after that incident,

86
00:04:39,181 --> 00:04:41,490
when I was attacked,
that fear just went away.

87
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:46,110
And as I said in my speech at the United
Nations that my weakness,

88
00:04:46,111 --> 00:04:50,580
my fear and my hopelessness died on that
day and I became stronger than before.

89
00:04:50,860 --> 00:04:51,693
Rather than responding with rage,
she uses it as fuel to double down on 

90
00:04:54,881 --> 00:04:57,040
her courage,
belief and hope for the world.

91
00:04:58,060 --> 00:04:58,893
Just like in the world of skills,
the philosophical narratives you 

92
00:05:00,911 --> 00:05:05,170
subscribed to have affects on more than 
just the internal interpreted experience

93
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:10,030
because that interpreted experience then
bins back and behaves in the world.

94
00:05:10,300 --> 00:05:11,133
So if you expect the bad,
you might just experience more of it 

95
00:05:13,270 --> 00:05:15,230
because you find yourself frowning at 
others,

96
00:05:15,231 --> 00:05:18,220
suspecting them and being guarded.
Conversely,

97
00:05:18,250 --> 00:05:21,810
if you expect the good,
you just might find it like Malala did.

98
00:05:22,900 --> 00:05:26,230
Stories we tell ourselves are more than 
just important fables.

99
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:27,273
They make up the fabric of our identity 
and influence the dance of the main 

100
00:05:30,311 --> 00:05:32,710
actor in our story.
So listen,

101
00:05:32,711 --> 00:05:33,544
look and read broadly.
But we have to carefully curate the 

102
00:05:36,281 --> 00:05:38,740
stories in our libraries that we tell 
ourselves.

103
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:42,610
Knowing that the next chapter will 
reflect the last one we read.

104
00:05:43,540 --> 00:05:46,330
Curiously,
the idea that you can change your future

105
00:05:46,331 --> 00:05:50,110
story by believing a different one is 
itself a kind of narrative.

106
00:05:50,470 --> 00:05:51,303
Is this idea nothing more than an 
idealistic fairy tale or will you add 

107
00:05:54,881 --> 00:05:57,380
this to your library?
It's up to you.

108
00:06:05,070 --> 00:06:05,903
I haven't gone in a quick thank you to 
those of you who have supported me on 

109
00:06:20,180 --> 00:06:21,013
Patrion.
Thank you for allowing me to tell 

110
00:06:22,701 --> 00:06:25,220
stories that I think are rich and 
valuable.

111
00:06:25,490 --> 00:06:27,530
These are the stories in my library.
