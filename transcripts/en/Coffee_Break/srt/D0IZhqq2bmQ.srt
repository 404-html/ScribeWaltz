1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:00,893
Signing credit card receipts or one of 
those antiquated systems of record 

2
00:00:02,971 --> 00:00:06,570
keeping that use to make more sense,
but now through preservation of only the

3
00:00:06,571 --> 00:00:07,404
tradition and not the purpose has lost 
most of its meaning and desperately 

4
00:00:09,991 --> 00:00:10,824
needs to be replaced.
Kind of like that collection of vhs 

5
00:00:13,051 --> 00:00:13,884
tapes you still have from the 90s even 
though you no longer have a vhs player 

6
00:00:16,230 --> 00:00:17,063
to understand this,
let's go back to the credit card 

7
00:00:18,091 --> 00:00:19,170
receipt.
Glory days.

8
00:00:19,350 --> 00:00:23,040
Actually we have to rewind a little bit 
before that and talk about credit.

9
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:28,150
As a rule,
people hate spending money but they love

10
00:00:28,151 --> 00:00:28,984
getting stuff.
People will spend more if they don't 

11
00:00:30,071 --> 00:00:30,904
have to spend now but can get stuff now 
and businesses love getting more money 

12
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:34,533
even if they have get it later.
This is where the idea of a tab or 

13
00:00:36,751 --> 00:00:38,640
credit comes from.
At first lines of credit,

14
00:00:38,641 --> 00:00:40,230
we're limited in where they can be used.

15
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:41,333
Sometimes I borrow would give you a coin
or token is proof of you being a loyal 

16
00:00:43,171 --> 00:00:44,004
customer and lets you build a tab and 
their bar or a gas station would give 

17
00:00:45,961 --> 00:00:46,794
you a paper card as credit to a few 
exclusive stores within the area and it 

18
00:00:49,531 --> 00:00:50,364
built in.
I didn't do protection existed because 

19
00:00:51,451 --> 00:00:52,284
in most of these places everyone in the 
town knew everybody so they would know 

20
00:00:55,171 --> 00:00:56,790
if the card wasn't held by the right 
person,

21
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,580
but as they need for a more universal 
credit system came about,

22
00:00:59,581 --> 00:01:00,414
credit card issuers had to find some way
of securing their cars to protect 

23
00:01:02,431 --> 00:01:03,870
against fraud.
After all,

24
00:01:03,871 --> 00:01:06,870
if you're from Ohio and someone uses 
your card in New York,

25
00:01:06,871 --> 00:01:08,550
how's the merchant to no,
it isn't you.

26
00:01:08,850 --> 00:01:11,280
So this is where the signature on the 
back of your card comes in.

27
00:01:11,740 --> 00:01:12,573
Merchant has you sign your credit card 
receipt and is supposed to check it to 

28
00:01:14,761 --> 00:01:16,720
signatures matched to prove it is really
you.

29
00:01:16,950 --> 00:01:17,783
Now,
even when that system kind of made 

30
00:01:18,751 --> 00:01:19,584
sense,
it had all sorts of flaws in comparing 

31
00:01:20,881 --> 00:01:21,714
signatures properly,
takes too much time with the average 

32
00:01:23,371 --> 00:01:24,204
clerk isn't a signature expert and 
because your signature is right on the 

33
00:01:26,251 --> 00:01:27,084
back of the card,
any industrious thief could just 

34
00:01:28,351 --> 00:01:31,950
practice your signature for a day before
actually going out on a spending spree.

35
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:33,713
But this system makes even less sense 
now because when's the last time anyone 

36
00:01:36,211 --> 00:01:37,800
actually compared your signatures like 
that?

37
00:01:38,370 --> 00:01:42,420
So why do we still have to sign?
It all has to do with blame.

38
00:01:42,660 --> 00:01:43,493
If merchants don't have you signed and 
you decide that you wanted to speak to 

39
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:46,313
charge,
the credit card company will make the 

40
00:01:47,401 --> 00:01:49,770
merchant reimburse it.
But if they did make you sign,

41
00:01:49,771 --> 00:01:53,130
they can say they used reasonable fraud 
prevention methods to verify that it was

42
00:01:53,131 --> 00:01:54,300
you.
In that case,

43
00:01:54,330 --> 00:01:56,850
either you or the credit card company,
it would have to pay.

44
00:01:57,300 --> 00:01:59,520
But let's not get lost in business 
buzzwords here.

45
00:01:59,550 --> 00:02:00,383
It's important to note that what 
everyone considers to be reasonable 

46
00:02:02,821 --> 00:02:06,420
fraud prevention is not reasonable at 
all because they never checked.

47
00:02:06,450 --> 00:02:09,240
If your signature matches anything.
Let me give you an analogy.

48
00:02:09,510 --> 00:02:10,343
Imagine bars were tired of the time it 
takes to individually check everyone's 

49
00:02:12,571 --> 00:02:13,404
Id that the government tells them they 
still need to check if everyone's 21 

50
00:02:15,451 --> 00:02:16,284
because the law says so.
So in efforts of reasonable age 

51
00:02:18,601 --> 00:02:20,220
identification,
they ask everyone,

52
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:22,710
are you 21 and if they say yes,
they can drink,

53
00:02:23,430 --> 00:02:24,263
this system would help the barb prove 
that they were trying to stop underage 

54
00:02:26,250 --> 00:02:27,083
drinking,
but the actual results would be the 

55
00:02:28,531 --> 00:02:31,860
equivalent of having no check it all.
And that's my point.

56
00:02:31,861 --> 00:02:32,694
Your credit card signature is equivalent
to no signature at all because it will 

57
00:02:34,981 --> 00:02:36,960
never stop anyone from using your credit
card.

58
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:39,300
So what do we do about it?
Well,

59
00:02:39,301 --> 00:02:40,134
the good news is technology is making 
fraud protection easier and better than 

60
00:02:42,751 --> 00:02:43,680
ever.
And Europe,

61
00:02:43,681 --> 00:02:44,514
they rolled out a chip and pin system,
which requires a pin every time you try 

62
00:02:47,441 --> 00:02:48,274
to buy something.
This is at least as fast as signing a 

63
00:02:49,651 --> 00:02:51,930
receipt and actually has some real 
security in it.

64
00:02:52,050 --> 00:02:54,480
But in America,
although we've adopted the chip cards,

65
00:02:54,481 --> 00:02:58,620
we're still using our signature system.
Why you ask one credit card company,

66
00:02:58,650 --> 00:02:59,650
explain the kiss.

67
00:03:06,940 --> 00:03:10,030
If you can possibly ignore the dripping 
condescension in the statement.

68
00:03:10,031 --> 00:03:10,864
What it boils down to is that you're 
only going to get a credit card with 

69
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:16,000
actual security when you want it.
And for that to happen,

70
00:03:16,010 --> 00:03:19,330
people everywhere need to realize that 
the story of the signature is a lie.

71
00:03:19,510 --> 00:03:22,870
It doesn't protect you and worse,
it breeds a false sense of security in a

72
00:03:22,871 --> 00:03:25,060
system that needed to be replaced 
decades ago.
