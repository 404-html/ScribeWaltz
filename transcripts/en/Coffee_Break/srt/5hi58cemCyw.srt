00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,500
Hey,
I've been gone for a while.

2
00:00:01,620 --> 00:00:03,810
Part of the reason is I just got back 
from my honeymoon,

3
00:00:03,811 --> 00:00:04,644
which was awesome,
and also for the past few weeks I've 

4
00:00:07,321 --> 00:00:08,154
been working partly on a new coffee 
break and partly on a brand new series 

5
00:00:12,001 --> 00:00:12,834
called coffee with,
which is an interview show where I 

6
00:00:15,751 --> 00:00:16,584
explore the lives of creators,
the first one being well or a fellow 

7
00:00:19,261 --> 00:00:20,880
video sas.
If you like me,

8
00:00:20,881 --> 00:00:21,714
if you like what I do,
you feel like people like me and you're 

9
00:00:23,761 --> 00:00:26,130
going to love this show,
so please go check it out.

10
00:00:26,370 --> 00:00:28,230
Support the channel.
Now,

11
00:00:28,231 --> 00:00:29,940
just so you know,
it's a new channel,

12
00:00:29,941 --> 00:00:32,640
so if you're subscribed to me,
you're not going to be subscribed to the

13
00:00:32,641 --> 00:00:34,710
new channel.
Please also subscribe to that.

14
00:00:34,730 --> 00:00:36,540
If you like content,
you want to see more of it.

15
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:38,010
Thank you so much and,
uh,

16
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:39,510
leave some feedback.
Let me know what you think.

17
00:00:39,511 --> 00:00:42,000
It's the first episodes.
Of course there are some problems,

18
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:43,973
but I think it's the start of something 
that could be really cool and I think 

19
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:48,750
you guys might really like it.
So,

20
00:00:48,751 --> 00:00:50,640
uh,
here's a trailer.

21
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:51,870
The link is down below.

22
00:00:56,820 --> 00:00:57,740
Okay.

23
00:01:00,170 --> 00:01:01,170
Welcome to New York.

24
00:01:04,490 --> 00:01:07,110
So I tried shooting this intro live 
several times,

25
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:09,990
but each time I miserably failed.
So let me start again.

26
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:11,933
This is an interview show called coffee 
with where I have interesting 

27
00:01:14,161 --> 00:01:17,940
conversations over coffee with youtube 
or anyone that's interesting.

28
00:01:18,300 --> 00:01:21,030
This is the first episode where but 
amazing will scooter,

29
00:01:21,330 --> 00:01:23,580
but before we get to who he is and start
the show,

30
00:01:23,581 --> 00:01:25,770
I want to tell you why I created coffee 
with,

31
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:28,800
now that I finished the interview and 
have had time to collect my thoughts.

32
00:01:29,130 --> 00:01:30,450
If you don't know me,
I run coffee,

33
00:01:30,451 --> 00:01:32,640
break a video as a channel where I break
down big ideas,

34
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:33,713
but besides being a creator myself,
I'm also a really big fan of other 

35
00:01:36,391 --> 00:01:37,224
youtubers that break down big ideas.
I love when someone can teach complex 

36
00:01:40,321 --> 00:01:41,154
ideas and are on the cutting edge of 
using media to do so and I want to talk 

37
00:01:44,521 --> 00:01:46,320
with some of these people,
discuss their ideas,

38
00:01:46,321 --> 00:01:48,120
inspirations and origins.

39
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:49,433
Usually these people are behind a 
curtain and professionalism and their 

40
00:01:51,541 --> 00:01:53,730
videos,
but if you strip that away and just talk

41
00:01:53,731 --> 00:01:54,564
with them,
you find that there unexpectedly witty 

42
00:01:56,671 --> 00:01:57,504
or funny or kind,
and I want to show that over a cup of 

43
00:01:59,881 --> 00:02:02,880
coffee.
This will be available as a podcast,

44
00:02:02,910 --> 00:02:06,210
as a video interview on Youtube and 
highlight should also be going up soon.

45
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:08,220
For our first guest.
We have will scooter.

46
00:02:08,310 --> 00:02:10,260
He makes videos on culture,
irony,

47
00:02:10,261 --> 00:02:13,830
postmodernism philosophy,
that brain and even Mr Rogers.

48
00:02:14,220 --> 00:02:17,010
In this interview we talk about what it 
means to be a video sas.

49
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:19,050
We Talk Philosophy,
the age of distraction.

50
00:02:19,051 --> 00:02:22,530
We live in will's gratitude notes.
He writes every morning and more.

51
00:02:22,860 --> 00:02:25,770
It's a little slow going at first,
but I think we hit our stride toward the

52
00:02:25,771 --> 00:02:28,590
middle and some really cool stuff comes 
out of the conversation.

53
00:02:29,330 --> 00:02:31,230
Grab a cup of coffee,
grab a cozy couch.

54
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:33,960
Here's me fund in New York City and 
here's what we talked about.
