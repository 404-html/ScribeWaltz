1
00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:03,270
I started a patriotic,
it's another way to support me.

2
00:00:03,300 --> 00:00:04,133
The first is to watch my videos.
The second is to share them with 

3
00:00:06,031 --> 00:00:06,864
friends.
And the third is to back this channel 

4
00:00:08,101 --> 00:00:09,840
with money.
You don't have to do this,

5
00:00:09,841 --> 00:00:12,210
you're not a second class viewer.
If you don't become a patron,

6
00:00:12,330 --> 00:00:15,450
these videos will always be free.
But I do want to give you,

7
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:18,510
if you're able and don't mind signing up
for yet another website,

8
00:00:18,511 --> 00:00:22,320
the opportunity to help me take this 
small one man channel to the next level.

9
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:24,420
What do I mean?
Well here on coffee break,

10
00:00:24,630 --> 00:00:25,463
I do everything on a shoe string budget.
Ever noticed there's not much pizazz in 

11
00:00:28,291 --> 00:00:29,124
these videos and not much Polish.
Not to mention a while back people saw 

12
00:00:33,001 --> 00:00:36,540
me buying Maxwell House coffee.
What with your support we can get better

13
00:00:36,541 --> 00:00:39,420
fuel for these videos and we can get 
some much needed Polish.

14
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:41,220
So let's talk a little bit more about 
the site.

15
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:43,740
The website patrion originally comes 
from the word patron,

16
00:00:43,741 --> 00:00:44,574
which has Roman origins and it's a word 
for some wealthy person who supported 

17
00:00:47,641 --> 00:00:50,790
and artists to do his work.
And while it may be a stretch to call my

18
00:00:50,791 --> 00:00:51,624
work art,
it isn't a stretch to become one of my 

19
00:00:52,891 --> 00:00:55,500
patrons because there's only two levels 
of support,

20
00:00:55,770 --> 00:00:56,603
$1 a month and $5 a month.
$1 a month is less than the cost of a 

21
00:00:59,911 --> 00:01:00,744
hot and spicy chicken at Mcdonald's.
The standard metric of value back from 

22
00:01:03,391 --> 00:01:06,330
my college days and if you choose to 
support my channel with his amount,

23
00:01:06,570 --> 00:01:09,720
you'll be joining the proletariat 
members of the coffee break economy.

24
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:11,033
You are the backbone of everything we 
will achieve in this channel from here 

25
00:01:13,081 --> 00:01:15,210
on out,
and I want to thank you sincerely.

26
00:01:15,211 --> 00:01:17,070
If you choose me over a delicious 
sandwich,

27
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:19,110
I'd be torn over the dilemma myself.

28
00:01:19,380 --> 00:01:21,660
The second level of support is $5 a 
month.

29
00:01:21,690 --> 00:01:22,523
This is some big papa dollars and 
roughly equal to your average trip to 

30
00:01:24,661 --> 00:01:25,494
starbucks if you choose to support me 
instead of buying yourself a frothy 

31
00:01:28,141 --> 00:01:28,974
caffeine infused beverage,
you've achieved true self sacrifice for 

32
00:01:31,861 --> 00:01:33,780
this,
you will rise to the prestigious rank of

33
00:01:33,781 --> 00:01:36,390
the Burj Wallasey,
a member of the burrs.

34
00:01:36,391 --> 00:01:39,600
Rosie is not fundamentally different 
from the proletariat in any way,

35
00:01:39,601 --> 00:01:40,434
but they think they're better people and
they definitely have more money for 

36
00:01:43,291 --> 00:01:44,124
being in either group.
You will get a title that you can load 

37
00:01:45,571 --> 00:01:48,480
over people in or discord as well as 
when we start our separate it.

38
00:01:48,481 --> 00:01:51,000
You can have your title there as well.
Over time,

39
00:01:51,001 --> 00:01:53,970
I also will be releasing patrion 
exclusive videos and more.

40
00:01:54,390 --> 00:01:58,110
Please note there are no material perks 
associated with being in either of these

41
00:01:58,111 --> 00:02:00,690
groups other than my sincere gratitude 
for supporting me,

42
00:02:00,900 --> 00:02:04,020
but I do plan on fostering some healthy 
class warfare between the two.

43
00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:04,853
So if you were going to support me 
anyways and you want the fun of 

44
00:02:06,601 --> 00:02:10,290
belonging to a community and the joys of
hating outsiders for no reason,

45
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:14,250
this is the Patrion free you goals.
Now for my goals,

46
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:17,280
I'm going to keep it simple at $150 a 
month.

47
00:02:17,310 --> 00:02:19,500
My monthly coffee needs,
we'll have been met.

48
00:02:19,830 --> 00:02:20,910
Yes,
I drink too much coffee.

49
00:02:20,911 --> 00:02:22,260
Yes,
I should cut back and yes,

50
00:02:22,290 --> 00:02:23,123
I can quit anytime I want it to.
It's just that now isn't really a great 

51
00:02:25,081 --> 00:02:25,860
time.
You know,

52
00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:29,190
quit judging me,
but my big goal and it is a big one,

53
00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:30,990
is to get $3,000
a month.

54
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:31,913
This gets me to the place where I can 
officially drop my day job and do this 

55
00:02:34,261 --> 00:02:35,094
full time.
It would also increase my videos per 

56
00:02:36,421 --> 00:02:40,020
month from about one to one and a half 
per month to more like three to four per

57
00:02:40,021 --> 00:02:43,440
month and it would mean I could create 
bigger and more ambitious videos.

58
00:02:43,590 --> 00:02:46,620
This is my dream goal and it's where I 
want to be.

59
00:02:46,650 --> 00:02:50,250
I find the work that I do on coffee 
break to be extremely meaningful.

60
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:54,090
I love stimulating conversations,
telling stories and diving into research

61
00:02:54,091 --> 00:02:57,030
topics and if you'll help me,
I want to do more of it.

62
00:02:58,470 --> 00:03:00,610
Ultimately don't know what to expect 
from all this.

63
00:03:00,611 --> 00:03:01,444
It's kind of an experiment.
People have been mentioning that they 

64
00:03:03,311 --> 00:03:04,144
want to support my channel,
but I don't know how big of a minority 

65
00:03:06,281 --> 00:03:08,980
of my channel that is.
If none of you guys support the channel,

66
00:03:08,981 --> 00:03:10,510
that's fine.
I'll keep making videos,

67
00:03:10,810 --> 00:03:15,250
but if you can and want to,
I sincerely thank you and I'm excited to

68
00:03:15,251 --> 00:03:16,600
see where this journey takes us.

69
00:03:29,140 --> 00:03:29,973
Okay.
