00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:01,680
This video represents a hundred percent 
fact,

2
00:00:01,681 --> 00:00:04,020
and it's not at all an opinion.
If you disagree with this video,

3
00:00:04,021 --> 00:00:04,854
this merely implies that you are 
misaligned with reality or miseducated 

4
00:00:06,620 --> 00:00:08,220
on the facts.
If the former,

5
00:00:08,221 --> 00:00:10,800
I suggested psychiatrist the latter,
I suggest watching this video.

6
00:00:11,250 --> 00:00:14,370
Let's start this up.
The piano is the greatest sytropin ever,

7
00:00:14,371 --> 00:00:16,260
and I'm going to give you five reasons 
why.

8
00:00:16,620 --> 00:00:18,630
Number one,
most instruments like the voice,

9
00:00:18,631 --> 00:00:19,464
wind,
and brass instruments can only play one 

10
00:00:20,791 --> 00:00:23,280
note at a time.
This means to even play simple pieces.

11
00:00:23,281 --> 00:00:25,650
These instruments require you to have 
several friends to play with.

12
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:27,850
With piano,
you can forego all of that in play,

13
00:00:27,851 --> 00:00:30,270
several notes at the same time,
which is one of the main reasons.

14
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:31,890
It's the most popular singles 
instrument.

15
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:34,350
I mean,
solo instrument number two,

16
00:00:34,710 --> 00:00:35,543
a lot of instruments take a ton of 
practice just to create a good sound 

17
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:38,633
like trumpet or Violin,
which leads everyone with an earshot to 

18
00:00:41,041 --> 00:00:42,270
hate you.
Why you practice?

19
00:00:42,330 --> 00:00:47,330
Yeah,
with just one press of the Canada,

20
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:50,230
anyone can get a reasonable sound.
Okay,

21
00:00:56,740 --> 00:00:58,990
so even though the piano is incredibly 
tough to master,

22
00:00:58,991 --> 00:01:00,730
at least people won't hate you while you
do it.

23
00:01:00,940 --> 00:01:02,710
Number three,
the layout is intuitive.

24
00:01:03,010 --> 00:01:03,843
Now,
I know this might sound confusing to 

25
00:01:04,451 --> 00:01:07,060
some of you who look at the piano like I
might look at Chinese menu,

26
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:09,430
but trust me compared to some of these 
monstrosities,

27
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:13,030
the piano is really easy to understand.
All you really have to know is the pitch

28
00:01:13,031 --> 00:01:15,850
of these notes go up in ascending order,
low to high.

29
00:01:16,150 --> 00:01:18,430
What's your brain expects is exactly how
it's laid out.

30
00:01:18,670 --> 00:01:20,500
This is always higher than anything 
below it.

31
00:01:21,190 --> 00:01:24,280
Add to this the fact that the piano is a
very visual instrument and this makes it

32
00:01:24,281 --> 00:01:25,114
the perfect learning tool.
This is why if you seriously study any 

33
00:01:26,981 --> 00:01:27,814
instrument,
you will at some point be asked to pick 

34
00:01:28,991 --> 00:01:31,930
up a little bit of piano on the side in 
order to help you understand music.

35
00:01:31,931 --> 00:01:33,400
Period.
Number four,

36
00:01:34,030 --> 00:01:35,290
whether it be Chopin,
Bach,

37
00:01:35,291 --> 00:01:36,124
or billy Joel,
the overwhelming majority of great 

38
00:01:37,511 --> 00:01:39,970
composers play piano.
Number five,

39
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:41,313
check this out,

40
00:01:46,130 --> 00:01:46,963
Huh?

41
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:50,080
Now that's a pretty compelling reason to
learn sacks,

42
00:01:50,730 --> 00:01:51,563
but

43
00:01:51,730 --> 00:01:53,810
actually it was played on a keyboard.
Okay.

44
00:01:53,860 --> 00:01:55,210
A an electric piano using

45
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:57,090
call instrument.

46
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:58,233
These are becoming more common in some 
more realistic as technology gets 

47
00:02:00,371 --> 00:02:02,740
better.
So eventually you'll be able to play any

48
00:02:02,741 --> 00:02:07,741
instrument from the greatest instrument 
of all the piano check mate.

49
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:11,650
But now that I'm done ripping on every 
other musician,

50
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:12,513
let me just save this.
I'll hope for you guys is not lost less 

51
00:02:15,221 --> 00:02:16,560
pianists have one crucial,
yeah,

52
00:02:17,750 --> 00:02:18,583
there it is.
