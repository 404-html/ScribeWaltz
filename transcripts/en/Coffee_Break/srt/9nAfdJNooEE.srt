1
00:00:02,550 --> 00:00:03,383
Are you a sociopath?
Have you been caught with your pants 

2
00:00:05,131 --> 00:00:07,740
down figuratively or literally in some 
cases?

3
00:00:08,850 --> 00:00:09,683
Do you want to rejoin your moral 
community and wind back the respect of 

4
00:00:11,551 --> 00:00:12,384
your peers,
but don't want to admit that you're 

5
00:00:13,051 --> 00:00:14,070
wrong.
Well,

6
00:00:14,071 --> 00:00:14,904
you've come to the right place today.
We're going to learn about the art of 

7
00:00:17,461 --> 00:00:20,520
the non-apology.
We're going to take you from this.

8
00:00:20,700 --> 00:00:25,700
I did not have sexual relations with 
that woman to this from this.

9
00:00:35,290 --> 00:00:36,130
Hey everybody.
It's me,

10
00:00:36,131 --> 00:00:36,964
Kathy Griffin.
I'm just now seeing the reaction of 

11
00:00:38,711 --> 00:00:43,711
these images.
I made a mistake and I was wrong to this

12
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:46,540
year.
This month.

13
00:00:46,540 --> 00:00:49,420
That picture was released by the way you
take the apology back

14
00:00:54,410 --> 00:00:56,270
if you're lucky from this

15
00:00:56,430 --> 00:00:58,000
and when you were starting to let you do
it.

16
00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:01,660
I can do anything

17
00:01:02,290 --> 00:01:02,980
to this.

18
00:01:02,980 --> 00:01:03,813
What a great honor to be able to 
introduce for the first time ever 

19
00:01:07,031 --> 00:01:07,864
anywhere.
The 45th president of the United States 

20
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:13,660
of America,
Donald J dot trump.

21
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:14,753
Grandmother.

22
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:23,360
Alright,
let's do this number one.

23
00:01:23,390 --> 00:01:25,910
Don't apologize.
Let's start with the bread and butter.

24
00:01:26,180 --> 00:01:30,110
Have you tried not apologizing?
This is called the John Wayne Approach.

25
00:01:30,220 --> 00:01:31,960
Oh No,
so just out by the waterfall,

26
00:01:31,961 --> 00:01:33,730
but I'm sorry.
It's never apologize,

27
00:01:33,731 --> 00:01:35,170
Mr.
to sign of weakness.

28
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:39,270
This is often perceived by your 
supporters as being strong and powerful.

29
00:01:39,510 --> 00:01:41,910
You don't have to apologize.
No matter what you do.

30
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:43,980
This technique is endorsed by Donald 
Trump.

31
00:01:44,330 --> 00:01:49,130
We are not going to apologize for 
America no more apologies,

32
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:50,273
and before you say there goes crazy,
trump changing American politics to be 

33
00:01:52,981 --> 00:01:54,810
insensitive.
Just remember,

34
00:01:54,990 --> 00:01:57,660
this has been an American stands for 
pretty much forever.

35
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:01,950
I'll never apologize for the United 
States of America ever.

36
00:02:02,070 --> 00:02:06,060
I don't care what the facts are,
no matter what the facts are.

37
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:10,800
This is America number two account.
Don't apologize.

38
00:02:11,130 --> 00:02:12,300
Okay,
so if not,

39
00:02:12,301 --> 00:02:15,390
apologizing isn't an option.
You've really stepped in the Doodoo.

40
00:02:15,630 --> 00:02:18,600
Try Accounting.
This is when you don't apologize.

41
00:02:18,630 --> 00:02:19,463
You explained the context of when you 
messed up and that supposedly justifies 

42
00:02:22,711 --> 00:02:24,690
the action.
If they hadn't bought the liquor,

43
00:02:24,691 --> 00:02:27,030
you wouldn't have been drinking,
and if you hadn't been drinking,

44
00:02:27,031 --> 00:02:29,130
you wouldn't have sent those 
embarrassing photos of yourself.

45
00:02:29,730 --> 00:02:33,270
Roseanne put on a clinic of accounting a
few weeks ago when she said,

46
00:02:33,540 --> 00:02:35,700
oh no,
I didn't mean to tweet something.

47
00:02:35,701 --> 00:02:38,730
People interpreted as racist.
I was on Ambien,

48
00:02:38,731 --> 00:02:39,570
which made me sleep.

49
00:02:39,570 --> 00:02:43,800
Tweet.
Rosanne has her CPA in accounting.

50
00:02:44,130 --> 00:02:46,950
Great stuff.
Roseanne sets the bar.

51
00:02:47,940 --> 00:02:50,490
Number three,
apologize but don't change.

52
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:52,260
Now,
this next one is a long con.

53
00:02:52,530 --> 00:02:53,363
You're going to say that you're sorry,
but then commit a string of activities 

54
00:02:56,911 --> 00:02:58,530
that show that you really haven't 
changed.

55
00:02:59,140 --> 00:02:59,973
This next example is a little long.
I of course am talking of Anthony's 

56
00:03:02,441 --> 00:03:04,990
wieners apology.
This is him in 2011.

57
00:03:04,991 --> 00:03:07,480
When the scandal first breaks last 
Friday night,

58
00:03:07,481 --> 00:03:08,314
I tweeted a photograph of myself that I 
intended to send us a direct message as 

59
00:03:11,441 --> 00:03:12,274
part of a joke to a woman in Seattle.
So today I'm announcing my resignation 

60
00:03:16,181 --> 00:03:21,181
from Congress and two years later he 
tries to repair his image.

61
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:23,153
Look,
I made some big mistakes and I know I 

62
00:03:24,341 --> 00:03:27,640
let a lot of people down,
but I've also learned some tough lessons

63
00:03:28,050 --> 00:03:29,010
breaking news.

64
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:33,830
I'm responsible for this behavior that 
led us to be in this place.

65
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:34,873
I want you again say sorry to anyone who
has received receiving end of these 

66
00:03:38,391 --> 00:03:39,224
messages.

67
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:42,020
This is a pretty risky maneuver.
A can backfire pretty hard,

68
00:03:42,021 --> 00:03:46,030
so please be careful with this one.
Number four clarified.

69
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:46,873
Don't apologize.
Another tactic is to say that your 

70
00:03:49,221 --> 00:03:51,680
accuser misunderstood or misinterpreted 
you.

71
00:03:52,130 --> 00:03:54,470
You really meant something else.
For this example,

72
00:03:54,471 --> 00:03:55,304
take a look at Megan Kelly,
confronting Donald trump about his own 

73
00:03:57,711 --> 00:03:59,150
record.
History of misogyny.

74
00:03:59,540 --> 00:04:01,250
I don't want to sound too much like a 
chauvinist,

75
00:04:01,251 --> 00:04:03,290
but you wouldn't have your job if you 
weren't beautiful.

76
00:04:03,291 --> 00:04:05,000
It's very sad.
I'd look at right in that fat,

77
00:04:05,001 --> 00:04:06,890
ugly face.
She's gotten a little bit larger.

78
00:04:07,090 --> 00:04:09,790
Person who's flat chested is very hard 
to be a 10.

79
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:11,050
She ate like a pig,

80
00:04:11,430 --> 00:04:13,350
but what does he do?
Does he sit there and take it?

81
00:04:13,380 --> 00:04:15,340
Does he apologize?
No,

82
00:04:15,510 --> 00:04:17,910
he clarifies it.
He says,

83
00:04:17,911 --> 00:04:21,030
I wasn't talking about women.
I was talking about Rosie O'donnell.

84
00:04:21,970 --> 00:04:24,430
You've called women.
You don't like fat pigs,

85
00:04:24,850 --> 00:04:26,560
dogs,
slobs,

86
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:30,040
and disgusting animals.
Your twitter account,

87
00:04:30,090 --> 00:04:31,530
only rosie o'donnell.

88
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:43,790
This can be extremely effective.
Onto the next example.

89
00:04:44,030 --> 00:04:44,863
Number five,
issue a statement but never actually 

90
00:04:46,941 --> 00:04:47,774
say,
sorry.

91
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:48,913
So let's say you're Hillary Clinton,
someone running under the banner of 

92
00:04:50,661 --> 00:04:51,494
women's rights and you find yourself in 
trouble for not firing in 2008 campaign 

93
00:04:54,291 --> 00:04:56,180
advisor who is accused of sexual 
harassment.

94
00:04:56,930 --> 00:04:58,160
Well,
what is she going to do?

95
00:04:58,340 --> 00:04:59,173
Watch this play by play.
She issues a series of tweets where she 

96
00:05:02,271 --> 00:05:03,104
explains herself,
but notice she never uses apologize or 

97
00:05:06,110 --> 00:05:07,730
sorry,
anywhere in here.

98
00:05:08,090 --> 00:05:11,510
Now you amateurs out there pay special 
attention to this next part.

99
00:05:11,511 --> 00:05:14,150
See we call this.
The Washington doubled down.

100
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:15,313
She gets caught out for that and then 
she goes on to explain herself further 

101
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:19,033
in a really long facebook apologies,
but still doesn't use words like 

102
00:05:22,881 --> 00:05:23,930
apologizer.
Sorry.

103
00:05:24,260 --> 00:05:27,050
So it looks like she's apologizing,
but she really isn't.

104
00:05:27,850 --> 00:05:31,100
Now before we move onto our last type of
non-apology in this video,

105
00:05:31,340 --> 00:05:35,060
let's take a second to analyze why 
someone might use not apologies.

106
00:05:35,550 --> 00:05:38,540
Non-Apology is used for two reasons.
First,

107
00:05:38,541 --> 00:05:41,450
apologizing is all about not making 
excuses,

108
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:44,630
taking blame and putting yourself in the
hands of the offended.

109
00:05:45,230 --> 00:05:47,570
This is difficult if you're in a 
position of power,

110
00:05:47,571 --> 00:05:48,404
it can make you feel weak.
It can cause legal issues because 

111
00:05:50,211 --> 00:05:51,044
apologizing means you're admitting guilt
and some people simply don't like 

112
00:05:53,991 --> 00:05:57,020
admitting when they're wrong.
The second reason is maybe in your.

113
00:05:57,290 --> 00:06:00,290
You haven't committed a large enough 
offense to warrant an apology.

114
00:06:00,650 --> 00:06:02,360
For this reason,
you might issue a halfhearted.

115
00:06:02,361 --> 00:06:03,194
Sorry.
Different people have different 

116
00:06:04,341 --> 00:06:07,160
thresholds for what deserves an apology.
Either way,

117
00:06:07,161 --> 00:06:10,520
it's worth knowing that if you do decide
to go the route of the non-apology,

118
00:06:10,820 --> 00:06:14,360
they often come off as unsatisfying at 
best and unfeeling.

119
00:06:14,361 --> 00:06:16,700
At worst.
As you may have noticed in this video,

120
00:06:16,701 --> 00:06:17,534
humans have a natural instinct for 
sensing if an apology is sincere and if 

121
00:06:20,811 --> 00:06:23,630
the apologizers just trying to weasel 
their way out of the offense.

122
00:06:24,020 --> 00:06:24,853
If you doubt this,
think of how unsatisfying these phrases 

123
00:06:26,811 --> 00:06:28,580
are.
I'm sorry you got offended,

124
00:06:28,581 --> 00:06:30,800
or if I hurt anybody,
then I apologize.

125
00:06:31,460 --> 00:06:33,980
Still not.
Apologies do have their place.

126
00:06:34,130 --> 00:06:34,963
Sometimes they have social utility and 
sometimes they're all you can do as 

127
00:06:39,201 --> 00:06:41,150
Edwin [inaudible] Astella points out in 
his book.

128
00:06:41,270 --> 00:06:43,640
Sorry about that.
The language of public apology.

129
00:06:44,780 --> 00:06:47,570
To illustrate this,
he brings up a historical example.

130
00:06:47,571 --> 00:06:48,404
When in 1968 during the Vietnam war,
North Korean forces captured the USS 

131
00:06:52,910 --> 00:06:53,743
Pueblo,
a ship gathering Intel on the North 

132
00:06:55,100 --> 00:06:55,933
Koreans,
North Korea claimed the Pueblo had 

133
00:06:56,931 --> 00:06:57,764
crossed the territory lines,
making them fair game for capture while 

134
00:07:00,351 --> 00:07:04,160
the US insisted it hadn't.
The crew was tortured and forced to sign

135
00:07:04,161 --> 00:07:04,994
confessions,
and North Korea threatened that if the 

136
00:07:06,231 --> 00:07:07,064
US didn't give a written apology for 
straying into their territory that 

137
00:07:09,861 --> 00:07:10,694
killed the crew.
After being stalled and diplomacy for 

138
00:07:13,101 --> 00:07:14,870
almost a year,
Gilbert Woodward,

139
00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:15,733
the Army Major General at the time,
signed an agreement that the US was at 

140
00:07:18,441 --> 00:07:19,190
fault.

141
00:07:19,190 --> 00:07:21,260
While simultaneously releasing this 
remark,

142
00:07:21,860 --> 00:07:24,410
my signature will not and cannot alter 
the facts.

143
00:07:24,411 --> 00:07:27,740
I will sign the document to free the 
crew and only to free the crew.

144
00:07:27,980 --> 00:07:28,813
This non apology that was signed by 
Woodward is a perfect example of how 

145
00:07:31,490 --> 00:07:34,310
insincere apology is can sometimes be 
the only answer.

146
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:37,340
The next day the Pueblos crew was 
released safely,

147
00:07:38,750 --> 00:07:41,690
but now that we've talked about why 
someone might use a non-apology,

148
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:45,740
how they come off as insincere and the 
rare cases where they're needed.

149
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:48,920
Let's move onto our final example.
Number six.

150
00:07:49,010 --> 00:07:50,510
I'm sorry,
but apologies.

151
00:07:51,470 --> 00:07:52,303
Let's say you're Caitlyn Jenner.
You just ran a 69 year old from behind 

152
00:07:55,190 --> 00:07:56,023
with your car,
so you're being held accountable for 

153
00:07:57,621 --> 00:07:58,970
murder.
How do you get out of it?

154
00:07:59,450 --> 00:08:03,170
This one we're going to play along at 
home a say you're sorry.

155
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:04,273
Be Blaming on the Paparazzi.
See settled the lawsuit with your 

156
00:08:06,831 --> 00:08:09,620
enormous wealth and don't face jail time
or d,

157
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:13,560
all of the above.
Yes,

158
00:08:13,561 --> 00:08:15,390
that's right.
To all of you who gets d,

159
00:08:15,391 --> 00:08:16,224
You are correct.
You do it all when you can't totally 

160
00:08:19,651 --> 00:08:22,110
dodged the apology.
You can say you're sorry,

161
00:08:22,230 --> 00:08:25,710
but that it wasn't all your fault.
This is what Caitlyn does.

162
00:08:25,860 --> 00:08:26,693
She says she's sorry,
but the Paparazzi were the ones 

163
00:08:28,021 --> 00:08:30,870
distracting her and they should also be 
held responsible.

164
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:35,880
She has it all figured out and for the 
record she never face jail time.

165
00:08:35,970 --> 00:08:37,620
Totally got away with manslaughter.

166
00:08:41,630 --> 00:08:46,630
He just said manslaughter.
No,

167
00:08:55,540 --> 00:08:56,110
a lot

168
00:08:56,110 --> 00:08:58,940
of my recent remarks you've got up here 
before you to say to.

169
00:08:58,941 --> 00:09:00,130
I'm deeply

170
00:09:01,730 --> 00:09:02,820
Lisa,

171
00:09:13,590 --> 00:09:15,900
I think fortunate video.
First of all,

172
00:09:15,930 --> 00:09:17,430
music Mecca,
83.

173
00:09:17,431 --> 00:09:19,230
You've seen them on here before.
Incredible guy.

174
00:09:19,231 --> 00:09:22,830
Go check him out.
We've got a new artist named Ebraheem.

175
00:09:22,890 --> 00:09:25,110
I think that's how you pronounce it.
Anyway,

176
00:09:25,170 --> 00:09:27,120
incredible producer.
If you like his sounds,

177
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:28,193
go check them out.
All the links to the music art down 

178
00:09:30,030 --> 00:09:33,030
below discussion.
Go to the reddit will have a thread.

179
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:34,133
I also want to discuss with you guys 
Patrion I've realized after doing this 

180
00:09:37,861 --> 00:09:38,694
channel for a little while,
that that's gonna have to be the main 

181
00:09:41,431 --> 00:09:43,860
income source for this channel.
Um,

182
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:48,480
I just don't release videos fast enough.
I prefer quality.

183
00:09:48,481 --> 00:09:52,140
I prefer spending my time on videos,
so that's going to be,

184
00:09:52,141 --> 00:09:56,160
have to be the direction of the channel.
So you will see more pitches for that.

185
00:09:56,161 --> 00:09:56,994
I apologize if you're annoyed by that,
but the patrons had that have been 

186
00:10:00,001 --> 00:10:00,690
supporting me.

187
00:10:00,690 --> 00:10:03,030
Those guys are the kind of the lifeblood
of this channel.

188
00:10:03,180 --> 00:10:06,360
So I'm pushing more towards that.
Along those lines.

189
00:10:06,420 --> 00:10:08,370
I want to change up kind of what we do 
with that.

190
00:10:08,371 --> 00:10:10,050
So as you know,
we have two tiers.

191
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:12,960
Some of you know we have the proletariat
and the bourgeoisie.

192
00:10:13,290 --> 00:10:16,410
Proletarian is $1 a month,
virtually cs $5 a month.

193
00:10:17,220 --> 00:10:18,810
In the past.
I haven't done anything with it.

194
00:10:19,290 --> 00:10:21,720
I want to change that.
I'm not exactly sure how I'm going to,

195
00:10:21,721 --> 00:10:22,554
but for now I want to try this.
If you are currently supporting me or 

196
00:10:26,281 --> 00:10:29,460
you are considering supporting me,
go to Patrion.

197
00:10:29,461 --> 00:10:30,294
I'm going to create a thread and I'm 
asking for input on what you'd like to 

198
00:10:34,141 --> 00:10:35,760
see.
Would you like to see perks?

199
00:10:35,761 --> 00:10:39,270
Would you like to see more recognition?
Would you like to see nothing at all?

200
00:10:39,870 --> 00:10:43,920
I need your feedback to know kind of the
direction I want to go with this.

201
00:10:44,070 --> 00:10:46,500
What makes you want to support your 
input?

202
00:10:46,501 --> 00:10:51,330
Really means the world to me,
so please go and put in your two cents a

203
00:10:51,450 --> 00:10:53,550
one last little announcement and then 
we're done.

204
00:10:54,180 --> 00:10:55,013
I'm about to leave for my honeymoon so I
will be gone for about little over a 

205
00:10:58,290 --> 00:10:59,123
week and then I will be back.
I think I'm going to do a look back at 

206
00:11:02,551 --> 00:11:05,400
one of my first viral videos for the 
next one.

207
00:11:05,401 --> 00:11:08,430
Maybe something people got mad at me 
for,

208
00:11:08,490 --> 00:11:12,090
so look forward to that.
Thank you for watching.
