1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:02,610
This isn't your everyday article 13 
video,

2
00:00:02,670 --> 00:00:03,503
which unfortunately I know because I 
wrote that script and had to throw it 

3
00:00:06,721 --> 00:00:10,110
out because of new changes that the EU 
has made to their final proposal.

4
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:11,153
They rewarded article 13 to take every 
enforceable part of the bill and all 

5
00:00:14,761 --> 00:00:15,594
they left is a giant pile of legal mush,
but before we get into all the changes 

6
00:00:18,931 --> 00:00:20,760
and what it means,
let's start with the basics.

7
00:00:20,850 --> 00:00:21,683
Article 13 is part of a European 
copyright reform that says that 

8
00:00:24,091 --> 00:00:27,810
copyrighted content has to be banned 
upon upload by content hosting websites,

9
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:30,960
and in the original document.
This meant that all copyrighted content,

10
00:00:30,961 --> 00:00:31,794
even copyright exceptions like parody,
fair dealing and educational videos 

11
00:00:34,381 --> 00:00:36,300
would be affected.
Needless to say,

12
00:00:36,301 --> 00:00:38,810
the Internet was pretty angry and 
worried about this

13
00:00:38,870 --> 00:00:39,703
new law.
The current proposal of article 13 will 

14
00:00:42,210 --> 00:00:46,140
create large unintended consequences.
Article 13,

15
00:00:46,141 --> 00:00:49,350
when the content is uploaded,
unless they know for sure who owns every

16
00:00:49,351 --> 00:00:51,450
single part of it,
it would make sense for youtube to allow

17
00:00:51,451 --> 00:00:54,360
for it to go up.
Most talented creatives you know who are

18
00:00:54,361 --> 00:00:58,170
based in the EU will be banned from 
Youtube.

19
00:00:58,720 --> 00:01:02,260
We're all going to be banned was the 
general consensus because it's true.

20
00:01:02,290 --> 00:01:04,270
The first drafts of this law were 
horrible,

21
00:01:04,630 --> 00:01:05,463
but no one has spent much time talking 
about the massive changes that this law 

22
00:01:08,141 --> 00:01:10,030
went through and what it means.
See,

23
00:01:10,031 --> 00:01:13,570
when I started my original script,
this was a much different article 13,

24
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:15,400
it was 900 words,
eight sections,

25
00:01:15,550 --> 00:01:16,383
and it talked far more specifically 
about repercussions who would be 

26
00:01:18,521 --> 00:01:20,200
affected and how it would be 
implemented,

27
00:01:20,260 --> 00:01:24,220
but after months of discussion,
the EU has settled on a new version that

28
00:01:24,221 --> 00:01:25,054
takes out every specific guideline and 
leaves us with vague words like best 

29
00:01:28,181 --> 00:01:30,520
practices,
cooperation with rights holders,

30
00:01:30,730 --> 00:01:33,580
large amounts appropriate and 
proportionate.

31
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:35,193
You still get the feeling reading it 
that it will have big implications for 

32
00:01:37,301 --> 00:01:38,134
copyright,
but there's nothing to build rules 

33
00:01:39,461 --> 00:01:40,294
around because nothing is clearly 
defined for people like youtube or 

34
00:01:42,911 --> 00:01:44,860
facebook that will be affected by this 
bill.

35
00:01:45,070 --> 00:01:48,670
This thing turned from a law about 
copyright enforcement to be more like an

36
00:01:48,671 --> 00:01:49,504
announcement about a law about copyright
enforcement that someday in the future 

37
00:01:52,571 --> 00:01:55,180
will be further defined,
which as it turns out,

38
00:01:55,181 --> 00:01:59,920
is kind of an EU strategy.
Making laws vague has its advantages,

39
00:02:00,430 --> 00:02:01,263
but this is a huge problem for companies
outside of the EU and leaves us with a 

40
00:02:04,421 --> 00:02:07,660
question,
what should we do with vague laws?

41
00:02:08,180 --> 00:02:13,180
What are the rules when you kept your 
brain,

42
00:02:16,821 --> 00:02:19,430
but the world is insane.
How the hail you,

43
00:02:19,460 --> 00:02:20,293
Donna.

44
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:24,233
Let's start by talking about the U.
S which actually has laws about vague 

45
00:02:27,331 --> 00:02:28,164
laws in the US.
There's something called the vagueness 

46
00:02:30,181 --> 00:02:31,014
doctrine.
It says the criminal laws and sometimes 

47
00:02:32,641 --> 00:02:33,474
civil laws that aren't clear as to be 
understandable by a man of common 

48
00:02:36,331 --> 00:02:39,420
intelligence are void or to put it 
another way,

49
00:02:39,540 --> 00:02:41,430
you can't be punished for breaking the 
law.

50
00:02:41,460 --> 00:02:45,330
You're not sure how to keep in the US.
There was a case of the FCC,

51
00:02:45,331 --> 00:02:46,164
Verse Fox,
which illustrates how this works using 

52
00:02:47,791 --> 00:02:50,820
America's two favorite things,
bad words and nudity.

53
00:02:51,090 --> 00:02:51,923
The FCC has these rules on broadcasting 
that are called obscenity laws that say 

54
00:02:55,831 --> 00:02:59,130
what you can and cannot show on tv what 
is appropriate and what is not.

55
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:00,153
The problem is that obscenity is an 
incredibly difficult thing to define 

56
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:04,870
because as we discussed in a previous 
video,

57
00:03:05,170 --> 00:03:06,003
what's obscene is always changing and 
rather than take a stab at any ways and 

58
00:03:09,641 --> 00:03:13,150
make specific rules,
the FCC decided to be ambiguous.

59
00:03:13,330 --> 00:03:14,163
They described what is inappropriate 
using words like patently offensive by 

60
00:03:17,591 --> 00:03:18,424
contemporary community standards and 
this all came to a head when during an 

61
00:03:22,511 --> 00:03:26,710
award show a couple people dropped f 
bombs and later Fox aired partial nudity

62
00:03:26,990 --> 00:03:29,950
as really,
really fucking brands.

63
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:35,040
So after these programs were aired,
FCC sent out a new ruling,

64
00:03:38,301 --> 00:03:40,490
further defining they're vague obscenity
laws,

65
00:03:40,820 --> 00:03:41,653
and then tried to hold Fox accountable 
for breaking those new descriptions of 

66
00:03:44,391 --> 00:03:45,224
what obscenities look like.
The case of whether the FCC could find 

67
00:03:48,231 --> 00:03:49,064
Fox for breaking their newly defined 
obscenity laws when all the way up to 

68
00:03:52,191 --> 00:03:53,024
the Supreme Court who eventually decided
that because Fox didn't know ahead of 

69
00:03:55,821 --> 00:03:58,670
time what constituted obscenity and 
indecent anus,

70
00:03:58,910 --> 00:04:03,590
the law was too vague to prosecute them.
That is how the US handles vagueness.

71
00:04:03,860 --> 00:04:04,693
Now back to the EU.
They don't have an explicit vagueness 

72
00:04:07,191 --> 00:04:08,024
doctrine and this has caused a lot of 
problems for American tech companies in 

73
00:04:11,271 --> 00:04:12,104
a similar way to how Fox almost got in 
trouble for breaking rules that weren't 

74
00:04:14,541 --> 00:04:15,374
clearly defined.

75
00:04:15,740 --> 00:04:18,170
Google did get in trouble in Europe for 
the same reason.

76
00:04:18,710 --> 00:04:22,370
They were reasonably fine for breaking 
antitrust laws that ruled that they were

77
00:04:22,371 --> 00:04:26,480
being anti competitive by pre installing
certain apps on their android devices.

78
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:27,793
The problem,
Google says they didn't know this was 

79
00:04:29,970 --> 00:04:32,690
anti competitive in their statement back
to the EU.

80
00:04:32,691 --> 00:04:33,524
They argue that the EU has reason to 
impose a fine rested on a novel legal 

81
00:04:36,831 --> 00:04:38,120
theory.
In conclusion,

82
00:04:38,121 --> 00:04:38,954
they say there is no precedent for 
characterize and Google's conduct as an 

83
00:04:41,781 --> 00:04:45,380
illegal abuse.
The rules must be knowable in advance,

84
00:04:45,950 --> 00:04:47,750
but there aren't any vagueness laws in 
Europe,

85
00:04:47,780 --> 00:04:48,613
which means that that line of reasoning 
didn't stop the EU from leveling of 

86
00:04:51,231 --> 00:04:52,064
$5,000,000,000
fine against Google all for violating a 

87
00:04:55,041 --> 00:04:58,370
rule that Google says they didn't know 
at the time they were breaking.

88
00:04:58,940 --> 00:04:59,773
This is the problem with vague laws.
Either you can't enforce them or the 

89
00:05:02,421 --> 00:05:05,420
enforcement seems arbitrary and unfair 
and look,

90
00:05:05,450 --> 00:05:07,670
there are compelling reasons to make 
vague laws.

91
00:05:07,940 --> 00:05:08,773
Judges get more latitude to interpret 
with the changing times and if you can 

92
00:05:11,721 --> 00:05:14,480
give the member states the ability to 
interpret those vague laws,

93
00:05:14,780 --> 00:05:15,613
but many people say that that doesn't 
outweigh the huge cons that come with 

94
00:05:18,201 --> 00:05:19,034
ambiguous legislation.
The number one problem being nobody 

95
00:05:21,561 --> 00:05:22,394
knows how to follow your rules and 
example of this can be seen in another 

96
00:05:25,101 --> 00:05:25,934
EU law.
The general data protection regulation 

97
00:05:27,770 --> 00:05:29,930
has also been accused of being too 
vague.

98
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:30,913
They defined personal data in such a way
that it could mean basically anything 

99
00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:35,083
which has left tech companies scrambling
to try to get into compliance with the 

100
00:05:37,821 --> 00:05:38,654
law.
They aren't sure they understand and 

101
00:05:40,701 --> 00:05:45,020
this is the EU playbook.
They declare really broad guidelines but

102
00:05:45,021 --> 00:05:47,330
won't specifically define the rules of 
the road.

103
00:05:47,630 --> 00:05:48,463
Instead,
it's just left to these companies to 

104
00:05:49,191 --> 00:05:53,270
self define and the price of being wrong
is devastating to companies,

105
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:54,313
which is why everyone seems to be an 
edge with what the EU will do next as 

106
00:05:57,140 --> 00:06:01,610
flex their regulatory muscles,
and this brings us back to article 13.

107
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:02,713
Nobody's quite sure what the EU means 
when they say measures to ensure the 

108
00:06:05,421 --> 00:06:06,254
functioning of agreements with rights 
holders or means when they say use of 

109
00:06:09,141 --> 00:06:09,974
effective content recognition 
technologies shall be appropriate and 

110
00:06:13,011 --> 00:06:13,844
proportionate,
but what is clear is that article 13 

111
00:06:16,101 --> 00:06:21,101
means a lot more than it says because if
the first proposals of article 13 or any

112
00:06:21,651 --> 00:06:25,310
indication of the longterm plan,
copyright exceptions,

113
00:06:25,311 --> 00:06:29,930
memes and fair dealing will not be 
protected or worse allowed at all in the

114
00:06:29,931 --> 00:06:32,750
EU,
which threatens content creators like me

115
00:06:32,780 --> 00:06:34,010
and many,
many,

116
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:34,873
many others.
If we look at the EU history of vague 

117
00:06:37,491 --> 00:06:39,650
law,
making it clear that Google,

118
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:40,520
facebook,
reddit,

119
00:06:40,550 --> 00:06:41,383
all these tech companies and all these 
youtubers have every reason to be very 

120
00:06:44,811 --> 00:06:47,180
scared over these new laws and protest 
them.

121
00:06:47,181 --> 00:06:48,014
Defiantly.
I think we all should not because 

122
00:06:50,091 --> 00:06:54,950
article 13 says all that much,
but because of what the EU can later say

123
00:06:55,250 --> 00:06:56,200
it,
mental alarm,

124
00:07:01,290 --> 00:07:05,950
this thing on this is a new mic so 
you'll have to bear with me as we figure

125
00:07:05,951 --> 00:07:09,130
out how to use it together.
Our sponsor today is Nord Vpn,

126
00:07:09,131 --> 00:07:09,964
which is a very timely sponsored,
if you're going to be affected by 

127
00:07:12,010 --> 00:07:15,790
article 13 or any of these other wacky 
Internet regulations that a lot of these

128
00:07:15,791 --> 00:07:17,430
countries are pursuing.
A,

129
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:21,130
you need to be protected and you'll be 
protected by a vpn.

130
00:07:21,220 --> 00:07:23,770
I've used vpns when I did a study abroad
in college.

131
00:07:24,130 --> 00:07:27,550
I went to cutter or Qatar,
however you prefer to say it,

132
00:07:27,610 --> 00:07:29,660
and I had to use vpns all the time.
Um,

133
00:07:29,710 --> 00:07:31,810
because the internet there is very 
regulated.

134
00:07:31,900 --> 00:07:33,820
Even a simple thing like watching a 
football game,

135
00:07:33,821 --> 00:07:37,510
you want to go to a local server,
just hop on your vpn and you get there.

136
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:40,220
But vpns go a lot further than just,
you know,

137
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:42,550
looking like you're from somewhere else.

138
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:45,400
A really,
they're about data privacy and this is a

139
00:07:45,401 --> 00:07:47,460
big problem in our modern world.
People are getting better and better,

140
00:07:47,461 --> 00:07:48,610
uh,
stealing your information,

141
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:49,713
especially if you like to go to coffee 
shops or hotels or you're in airports a 

142
00:07:53,501 --> 00:07:55,330
lot.
This is a huge problem.

143
00:07:55,331 --> 00:07:56,164
You're data is unprotected and the 
things you're sending over the Internet 

144
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:01,360
can be looked at,
can be stolen,

145
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:03,490
so that's something you want to protect 
yourself from.

146
00:08:03,580 --> 00:08:06,880
And one way to do that is a vpn.
The way I think about vpns is there kind

147
00:08:06,881 --> 00:08:11,170
of like a seatbelt for the data world.
You don't need them very often,

148
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:12,033
but when you do you're really glad you 
have them because they keep you from a 

149
00:08:16,061 --> 00:08:16,894
disaster.
And one of the really big cells of Nord 

150
00:08:18,881 --> 00:08:19,714
for me is the simplicity of use because 
I've used vpns in the past and they're 

151
00:08:23,940 --> 00:08:24,773
very complicated and they're hard to set
up a nord is probably the simplest that 

152
00:08:28,661 --> 00:08:29,494
I've tried at least.

153
00:08:29,740 --> 00:08:31,930
And I'm going to show you just how easy 
it is,

154
00:08:31,931 --> 00:08:34,510
like on something like your phone,
which I use all the time.

155
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:36,153
So let's say you're just browsing the 
internet as you do and you realize 

156
00:08:40,001 --> 00:08:43,510
suddenly you're on public Wifi and your 
data is out there for anybody.

157
00:08:43,970 --> 00:08:44,920
Um,
what you're gonna want to do.

158
00:08:44,950 --> 00:08:47,650
You go to North Vpn,
all you do,

159
00:08:47,710 --> 00:08:51,310
press quick connect and boom,
it is that easy.

160
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:54,070
For me,
the simplicity is pretty much everything

161
00:08:54,130 --> 00:08:55,920
because like I said,
it's like a seatbelt.

162
00:08:55,980 --> 00:08:58,590
You want it there,
but you don't want it in your way.

163
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:01,800
So if you're thinking about getting a 
vpn and you're a fan of the show,

164
00:09:01,950 --> 00:09:06,380
you can go to north vpn.com/coffee
break to get 75 percent off,

165
00:09:06,430 --> 00:09:07,263
three years and an extra month free.
That's [inaudible] dot com slash coffee 

166
00:09:11,191 --> 00:09:12,024
break.
