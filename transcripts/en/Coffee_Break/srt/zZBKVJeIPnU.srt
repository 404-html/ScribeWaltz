1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:04,260
Casey neistat represents to most people,
I think what's possible through a career

2
00:00:04,261 --> 00:00:07,140
on youtube.
He's had a successful short film career,

3
00:00:07,320 --> 00:00:08,153
landed a multimillion dollar acquisition
from CNN for his company and his 

4
00:00:10,801 --> 00:00:11,634
insanely popular.
So how did [inaudible] get here after 

5
00:00:14,281 --> 00:00:16,710
being a high school dropout?
I think if you'd ask him,

6
00:00:16,711 --> 00:00:18,780
he'd say what he has said a million 
times already.

7
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:22,190
It was a lot of work.
Nice.

8
00:00:22,280 --> 00:00:23,113
That's hardly the only one doing this.
He's part of a growing trend of people 

9
00:00:25,201 --> 00:00:28,140
that have been selling the silver bullet
of success to be

10
00:00:29,420 --> 00:00:34,420
[inaudible].

11
00:00:39,100 --> 00:00:42,490
The simple answer here is very simply 
that you need to,

12
00:00:43,540 --> 00:00:46,810
you need to work harder and faster.
There's really nothing else.

13
00:00:49,060 --> 00:00:51,440
This idea of working harder is always 
the answer.

14
00:00:51,441 --> 00:00:54,250
It has an almost frat boy has fallen 
into it and it's hard to Ms.

15
00:00:54,250 --> 00:00:55,083
White.
So appealing.

16
00:00:55,330 --> 00:00:57,460
It's an athlete's mentality.
Hardware,

17
00:00:58,150 --> 00:00:58,983
there's a real drama and excitement to 
the struggle and everything's always 

18
00:01:01,421 --> 00:01:02,254
within your control.
But is that all it took for Neistat to 

19
00:01:04,901 --> 00:01:07,690
go from broke to here?
I don't think so.

20
00:01:08,460 --> 00:01:10,420
Hard work was necessary for nice debt 
success,

21
00:01:10,421 --> 00:01:13,630
but not sufficient.
Success is not solely a function of hard

22
00:01:13,631 --> 00:01:14,464
work.
It's highly dependent on the quality of 

23
00:01:15,611 --> 00:01:18,130
the career opportunity or idea that 
you're pursuing.

24
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:19,833
Think of the millions of people working 
minimum wage jobs in America who are 

25
00:01:22,061 --> 00:01:26,260
working hard sometimes 80 hours a week 
just to stay afloat for these people.

26
00:01:26,350 --> 00:01:29,020
It's not about hard work,
but if hard work isn't enough,

27
00:01:29,050 --> 00:01:31,000
how did Neistat becomes so successful?

28
00:01:31,330 --> 00:01:34,600
So let me explain.
In the book outliers,

29
00:01:34,630 --> 00:01:37,900
Malcolm Gladwell analyzes people who 
excel at their craft.

30
00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:39,333
He finds that good timing plays a big 
role in why many people become 

31
00:01:41,921 --> 00:01:43,960
successful.
Even Bill Gates,

32
00:01:44,950 --> 00:01:45,783
he talks about one of the secrets to 
Bill Gates success was that he had 

33
00:01:47,531 --> 00:01:48,364
access to a computer.
That key could practice coding on years 

34
00:01:50,681 --> 00:01:54,100
before most people did.
So Bill Gates literally had thousands of

35
00:01:54,100 --> 00:01:54,933
hours of programming practice under his 
belt before anyone else got started in 

36
00:01:58,011 --> 00:01:58,844
this competitive advantage position in 
perfectly to take advantage of the pc 

37
00:02:01,541 --> 00:02:06,370
revolution they started when the Altair 
computer came out in 1975 well,

38
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:07,233
just like the computer revolution,
there has been a filmmaking revolution 

39
00:02:09,970 --> 00:02:13,180
since youtube came out in 2005 and light
gates.

40
00:02:13,270 --> 00:02:14,103
Nice tech,
got a critical headstart in filmmaking 

41
00:02:15,371 --> 00:02:18,160
before most would be youtube or had even
picked up a camera.

42
00:02:18,430 --> 00:02:22,060
See Neistat first got into professional 
filmmaking with a guy named Tom Sachs in

43
00:02:22,061 --> 00:02:22,894
2001 he developed a lot of his style 
here and he continued honing his craft 

44
00:02:26,441 --> 00:02:27,274
of filmmaking with several videos and an
hbo special so that later in 2010 when 

45
00:02:31,601 --> 00:02:32,434
he fully embraced the youtube space,
his content was noticeably more refined 

46
00:02:35,501 --> 00:02:36,334
and substantive than his peers,
and this is part of the magic of 

47
00:02:38,411 --> 00:02:39,100
watching Neistat.

48
00:02:39,100 --> 00:02:41,800
His style seems to come fully formed 
right out of the gate,

49
00:02:42,100 --> 00:02:45,100
whereas most youtubers have to find 
their voice within the first few years.

50
00:02:45,220 --> 00:02:47,590
Nice.
That had already found his with nearly a

51
00:02:47,590 --> 00:02:50,560
decade of practice and your spelling.
So with this in mind,

52
00:02:50,590 --> 00:02:52,540
the final piece of this story becomes 
obvious.

53
00:02:52,810 --> 00:02:56,220
Neistat's rise to be youtube favorite 
blogger when nice.

54
00:02:56,221 --> 00:03:00,970
That entered the vlog space in 2015 he 
was joining group of loggers with little

55
00:03:00,971 --> 00:03:03,320
film experience,
which makes it clear why nice.

56
00:03:03,321 --> 00:03:05,110
That's quality stands above the rest.

57
00:03:05,390 --> 00:03:09,080
[inaudible]

58
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:13,630
it's also why you see comments like this
on his luck all the time.

59
00:03:14,140 --> 00:03:16,300
It's a bit like watching a professional 
baseball player

60
00:03:16,410 --> 00:03:19,950
play in a high school game.
He just had way more experience.

61
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:20,993
So Nice.
That's timing with filmmaking was 

62
00:03:22,111 --> 00:03:24,090
perfect.
How'd he started filmmaking earlier?

63
00:03:24,091 --> 00:03:26,550
He might have been too far into a career
to switch to youtube,

64
00:03:26,730 --> 00:03:30,330
which is why most career filmmakers miss
the youtube and how he started later.

65
00:03:30,331 --> 00:03:32,760
He'd just be another Vlog or trying to 
figure out his style.

66
00:03:33,270 --> 00:03:34,103
But what happened was the combination of
the right idea at the right work ethic 

67
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:37,793
and the right timing,
that's what made Casey Neistat 

68
00:03:40,171 --> 00:03:41,550
successful.
Okay,

69
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:42,593
so why does it matter?
The nice that somewhat undersells the 

70
00:03:44,931 --> 00:03:46,830
role luck played in his success.

71
00:03:47,850 --> 00:03:48,451
Luck,
you know,

72
00:03:48,451 --> 00:03:50,850
all that other education,
all that,

73
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:53,010
like it's not even in the same pie 
chart.

74
00:03:53,030 --> 00:03:53,863
I think what bothers me is a lot of 
people see nice that I want to become 

75
00:03:56,271 --> 00:03:57,104
filmmakers like him and are told that 
work because the only thing that's 

76
00:04:00,591 --> 00:04:03,290
standing in their way,
but this isn't actually true.

77
00:04:03,740 --> 00:04:04,573
What made nice that go from a small 
indie filmmaker to the cover of Gq 

78
00:04:07,341 --> 00:04:11,990
magazine in less than two years was 
bringing nearly 15 years of professional

79
00:04:11,991 --> 00:04:15,470
film experience into a field where most 
people were total amateurs.

80
00:04:15,830 --> 00:04:16,663
But that has changed.
The idea of being a Vlogger is worth a 

81
00:04:18,981 --> 00:04:19,814
lot less now.
Now that there are hundreds of people 

82
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:22,393
occupying that space and producing 
regular content and their contents 

83
00:04:24,711 --> 00:04:25,544
getting better.
And I guess I just want to tell anybody 

84
00:04:27,381 --> 00:04:28,214
with the hunger to be successful that 
the next neistat probably won't be a 

85
00:04:30,681 --> 00:04:33,230
Vlogger.
It will be someone who utilizes a timely

86
00:04:33,231 --> 00:04:37,100
competitive advantage to dominate the 
market space or something like that.

87
00:04:37,220 --> 00:04:39,970
I don't know.
I'm just a youtuber and as a Youtuber,

88
00:04:39,971 --> 00:04:42,470
and this is the part of the video where 
I tell you for the millionth time,

89
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:43,333
which you already know,
that you can subscribe and like and 

90
00:04:45,531 --> 00:04:46,970
watch another video if you want.
So,

91
00:04:46,971 --> 00:04:47,720
uh,
yeah.

92
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:48,553
Thanks for watching.
I'll see you guys next Wednesday with 

93
00:04:49,641 --> 00:04:50,474
another video.
