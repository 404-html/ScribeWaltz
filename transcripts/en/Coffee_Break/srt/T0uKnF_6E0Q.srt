1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:03,060
The school of life is a youtube channel,
online business and physical school that

2
00:00:03,061 --> 00:00:06,210
professors to teach people about 
philosophy and emotional intelligence,

3
00:00:06,270 --> 00:00:07,103
but unfortunately they fall far short of
their own standard to the point it's 

4
00:00:09,210 --> 00:00:10,043
almost offensive.
The problem with the school of life is 

5
00:00:12,070 --> 00:00:13,980
threefold.
They pretend to be unbiased.

6
00:00:14,100 --> 00:00:14,933
They're selling a shallow,
narrow view of philosophy and they are 

7
00:00:16,921 --> 00:00:18,810
relentless profit tears in the worst 
possible way,

8
00:00:19,230 --> 00:00:21,330
but first,
who exactly is the school of life?

9
00:00:21,570 --> 00:00:24,210
I say who because while many people work
for the school of life,

10
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:25,860
one man in particular,
the founder,

11
00:00:26,140 --> 00:00:27,840
the main creator of most of their 
content,

12
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:29,393
alon to Bhutan.
If you're unfamiliar with Alonda 

13
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:32,033
Bhutan's work,
he's a sort of self stylized pop 

14
00:00:33,601 --> 00:00:34,434
philosopher,
but his works are really more something 

15
00:00:35,971 --> 00:00:36,804
like opinion pieces on life with a 
ragtag assortment of philosophy 

16
00:00:38,941 --> 00:00:39,774
sprinkled in some of his works include 
how to think more about sex art as 

17
00:00:43,051 --> 00:00:44,490
therapy on love.

18
00:00:44,970 --> 00:00:45,803
If you're thinking that you already 
sounds closer to oprah than he does to 

19
00:00:47,491 --> 00:00:48,324
aristotle,
that's not far from the opinion of many 

20
00:00:49,621 --> 00:00:52,200
others.
Alon is a polarizing figure.

21
00:00:52,230 --> 00:00:53,063
He's in disrepute by many philosophers 
as well as many book reviewers who both 

22
00:00:55,831 --> 00:00:56,664
criticized him for Lauren,
his books to appeal to a mass market 

23
00:00:58,441 --> 00:00:59,820
crowd.
On the other hand,

24
00:00:59,821 --> 00:01:01,920
his books have been widely sold and the 
school of life,

25
00:01:01,921 --> 00:01:02,754
his brainchild,
both one of the biggest audiences for 

26
00:01:04,411 --> 00:01:05,244
any philosophy channel on Youtube and 
Alon is important to understand because 

27
00:01:08,431 --> 00:01:11,040
he is the father of many of the ideas 
pedaled from the school of life,

28
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:13,320
but now that we're clear on who's behind
this,

29
00:01:13,350 --> 00:01:15,210
let's get on with the problems at the 
school of life.

30
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:16,313
Number one,
they pretend to be unbiased and this is 

31
00:01:18,271 --> 00:01:19,980
what started my dislike of the school of
life.

32
00:01:20,310 --> 00:01:21,143
They pretend to be unbiased,
will actually having a very particular 

33
00:01:22,921 --> 00:01:24,720
world view and perspective on 
philosophy.

34
00:01:25,980 --> 00:01:27,540
Here's such a claim in their intro 
video.

35
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:28,433
What is the school of life?
This school of life and openminded 

36
00:01:33,070 --> 00:01:33,903
rigorous on ideological organization.
Let's hear that again and open minded 

37
00:01:37,531 --> 00:01:39,810
and rigorous on ideological 
organization,

38
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:43,440
openminded and an ideological,
but then when you click on their videos,

39
00:01:43,470 --> 00:01:44,303
all you get is a constant stream of 
alonzo values and thoughts without even 

40
00:01:47,041 --> 00:01:47,874
the slightest critique of them as an 
example are open minded and an 

41
00:01:50,821 --> 00:01:53,520
ideological organization has this to say
about children.

42
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:55,830
It's almost a biological level.

43
00:01:56,290 --> 00:01:58,840
Kids will kill the relationship that 
produce them.

44
00:01:59,370 --> 00:02:02,010
I don't know where Alon gets this 
massive chip on his shoulder,

45
00:02:02,011 --> 00:02:04,980
but not all kids are harbingers of doom 
to a relationship,

46
00:02:05,190 --> 00:02:06,930
but maintaining the status of being 
unbiased.

47
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:11,080
Alon also manages to quash several 
millennia of debate with this nuance,

48
00:02:11,190 --> 00:02:12,990
an ideological statement about religion,

49
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:16,770
what religion teachers isn't about 
what's true,

50
00:02:17,130 --> 00:02:21,210
but about what many of us here on earth 
desperately wanted to be true.

51
00:02:21,330 --> 00:02:24,420
Openminded,
rigorous on ideological organization.

52
00:02:24,660 --> 00:02:27,330
Religious beliefs are of course 
technically falls,

53
00:02:27,590 --> 00:02:28,423
but that coming from a very tender and 
vulnerable place which needs our 

54
00:02:31,981 --> 00:02:32,814
empathy.
Of course atheists are technically 

55
00:02:34,951 --> 00:02:35,784
right,
but there's no point getting mad and by 

56
00:02:37,561 --> 00:02:40,140
the apparent irrationality of the 
religious

57
00:02:40,380 --> 00:02:41,400
pack up your bags,
boys,

58
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:44,070
Alon and the crack team of philosophers.
At the school of life,

59
00:02:44,071 --> 00:02:46,740
have it all figured out and I wanted to 
be clear,

60
00:02:47,070 --> 00:02:49,560
I don't have a problem with the school 
of life producing a video like this.

61
00:02:49,770 --> 00:02:50,603
They're welcome to their opinion,
but don't tell your viewer that you're 

62
00:02:52,321 --> 00:02:53,154
open minded and an ideological so while 
the school of life claims to be 

63
00:02:56,011 --> 00:02:57,420
unbiased,
they make videos.

64
00:02:57,421 --> 00:02:59,830
They give a singular,
narrow ideological answer to some of the

65
00:02:59,831 --> 00:03:02,620
most important philosophical questions.
At their best.

66
00:03:02,621 --> 00:03:04,870
This means they're self deceptive and 
saying that they are unbiased.

67
00:03:04,871 --> 00:03:05,704
At worst,
they are deliberately misleading their 

68
00:03:06,641 --> 00:03:08,920
audience in order to gain the appearance
of objectivity,

69
00:03:09,310 --> 00:03:13,480
and in this one point I think alon just 
might be a philosopher in the definition

70
00:03:13,481 --> 00:03:16,720
of nature himself.
Nisha had this to say about philosophers

71
00:03:16,721 --> 00:03:18,850
and their prejudices.
Philosophers,

72
00:03:18,910 --> 00:03:21,550
they're all advocates who do not wish to
be regarded as such.

73
00:03:21,730 --> 00:03:25,540
Generally astute defenders also have 
their prejudices which they dove is true

74
00:03:27,190 --> 00:03:29,560
problem to.
They're selling bad philosophy.

75
00:03:29,890 --> 00:03:30,723
They do this by delivering a shallow 
reductionist viewpoint that lets people 

76
00:03:32,981 --> 00:03:33,814
stoke a sense of pseudo intellectual ism
and spares them from the pains of 

77
00:03:36,101 --> 00:03:37,990
contradiction to be found in many 
worldviews.

78
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:39,153
Many defenders of the school of life 
might say that they are best viewed as 

79
00:03:41,081 --> 00:03:41,914
an introduction to philosophy and a 
seven minute video on plato can't 

80
00:03:43,931 --> 00:03:47,770
possibly be expected to carry everything
that he said and I would agree with you,

81
00:03:47,771 --> 00:03:49,870
but that's not what bothers me about the
school of life's work.

82
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:52,210
The problem is instead of conveying a 
true,

83
00:03:52,211 --> 00:03:54,640
albeit simplistic view of the 
philosophers ideas,

84
00:03:54,970 --> 00:03:55,803
many times instead they extract a 
philosopher's ideas and mesh them into 

85
00:03:58,691 --> 00:04:00,940
their viewpoint until they resemble some
sort of self help.

86
00:04:00,941 --> 00:04:03,340
Nonsense,
which is not at all how the philosophers

87
00:04:03,341 --> 00:04:04,390
work was meant to be taken.

88
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:05,710
For example,
with Plato,

89
00:04:05,711 --> 00:04:06,544
they can turn them into a dating coach 
offering the following relationship 

90
00:04:08,801 --> 00:04:11,110
advice.
Second big idea.

91
00:04:11,620 --> 00:04:14,710
Let your lover change you.
That sounds weird.

92
00:04:14,770 --> 00:04:15,603
If you think that love means finding 
someone who wants you just the way you 

93
00:04:18,461 --> 00:04:19,294
are in the symposium,
Plato's play about a dinner party where 

94
00:04:22,931 --> 00:04:25,690
a group of friends drink too much and 
get talking about love,

95
00:04:25,691 --> 00:04:26,980
sex,
and relationships.

96
00:04:27,340 --> 00:04:30,430
Plato says,
True Love is admiration,

97
00:04:31,030 --> 00:04:32,860
and on the surface it seems like,
well,

98
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:34,480
yeah,
maybe plato did say that,

99
00:04:34,570 --> 00:04:35,403
but the point is they're totally 
contorting the author's work and 

100
00:04:36,890 --> 00:04:37,723
achievement played his major 
contribution to philosophy or his 

101
00:04:39,851 --> 00:04:40,684
theories of forum,
dialectical method and political 

102
00:04:42,311 --> 00:04:44,350
theories,
not his thoughts and the ladies.

103
00:04:44,530 --> 00:04:46,720
If you're going to reduce a philosopher 
down to seven minutes,

104
00:04:46,750 --> 00:04:47,583
at least fill it with their major 
contributions to the philosophical 

105
00:04:49,451 --> 00:04:52,330
world,
and sometimes they do worse than this in

106
00:04:52,331 --> 00:04:54,610
this video,
along completely misunderstands the mind

107
00:04:54,611 --> 00:04:55,444
body problem,
which is the question of how our mental 

108
00:04:57,071 --> 00:04:59,320
thought and consciousness controls our 
physical body.

109
00:04:59,860 --> 00:05:01,270
Completely missing this.
Instead,

110
00:05:01,290 --> 00:05:02,890
alon explains that,
wow,

111
00:05:02,891 --> 00:05:03,724
it's a darn shame that everyone judges 
you so much on your luck's instead of 

112
00:05:05,831 --> 00:05:06,664
what's in your head.
The so called mind body problem is one 

113
00:05:10,871 --> 00:05:14,770
of the greatest and most quietly painful
conundrums in philosophy.

114
00:05:14,980 --> 00:05:18,130
The problem is rooted in the fact that 
in the eyes of other people,

115
00:05:18,550 --> 00:05:23,170
all of us are automatically and stop and
associated with our bodies,

116
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:24,393
which includes,
of course our faces and this kind of 

117
00:05:26,561 --> 00:05:28,630
feel good.
Philosophy is more than just unhelpful.

118
00:05:28,631 --> 00:05:29,464
It's counterproductive because it can 
cause people to think that they possess 

119
00:05:31,541 --> 00:05:32,374
and understanding of philosophy when in 
reality they have only been taught 

120
00:05:34,990 --> 00:05:37,090
shallow and disfigured elements of it.
Finally,

121
00:05:37,091 --> 00:05:37,924
as if that wasn't all enough,
we come to the third and final problem 

122
00:05:40,241 --> 00:05:42,940
of the school of life.
They're hucksters and profiteers.

123
00:05:43,150 --> 00:05:43,983
They established themselves as some sort
of guide of life and use that position 

124
00:05:46,361 --> 00:05:49,270
to sell merchandise that is priced so 
high it borders on the insane.

125
00:05:49,660 --> 00:05:52,120
How much would you say this imperfect 
pot is worth?

126
00:05:53,230 --> 00:05:55,210
It's literally a pot with blemishes on 
it.

127
00:05:56,230 --> 00:05:59,000
While it can be yours,
$75 or how about this?

128
00:05:59,001 --> 00:06:01,070
Regular Candle?
$50,

129
00:06:01,430 --> 00:06:05,300
but best of all and so telling of how 
money grubbing this operation really is.

130
00:06:05,570 --> 00:06:06,403
Is there an anticapitalist notebooks 
which they shamelessly ironically sell 

131
00:06:10,071 --> 00:06:12,830
for the very pro capitalistic price of 
$20.

132
00:06:14,780 --> 00:06:19,370
How does some of this video,
I think alon his whole school of life as

133
00:06:19,371 --> 00:06:22,940
best criticized through his own view of 
business businesses should not.

134
00:06:22,941 --> 00:06:25,640
He says so desires,
but instead cell needs,

135
00:06:25,910 --> 00:06:28,730
and this is the crucial distinction he 
makes between desires and needs.

136
00:06:29,150 --> 00:06:31,490
A desire is what you feel like you want 
at the moment,

137
00:06:31,730 --> 00:06:32,563
and Anita is something that serves your 
longterm wellbeing and I think you're 

138
00:06:35,451 --> 00:06:36,284
right alone,
so why in the world are you selling a 

139
00:06:37,670 --> 00:06:40,040
who should you be with card game for 
$15,

140
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:41,473
I guess,
at that doesn't fall under the need 

141
00:06:42,470 --> 00:06:43,303
section for most people,
and the same is true for their actual 

142
00:06:45,321 --> 00:06:46,154
content in the same way at the school of
life should stop selling the desires of 

143
00:06:48,771 --> 00:06:49,850
the people.
Cheap,

144
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:50,713
watery self-help philosophy,
drivel that reinforces their belief 

145
00:06:52,851 --> 00:06:53,684
system and instead sell to the needs of 
the people are real examination of what 

146
00:06:57,111 --> 00:06:57,944
the philosophers have been saying all 
along and help explain how one best 

147
00:07:00,621 --> 00:07:01,454
ought to examine their lives because in 
the end it's these true needs being met 

148
00:07:04,431 --> 00:07:07,850
that Plato and Aristotle would say 
produces a life full of eudaimonia.

149
00:07:08,270 --> 00:07:10,340
In other words,
