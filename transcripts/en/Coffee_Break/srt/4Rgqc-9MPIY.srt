1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:01,163
If you're like me,
you assume the rest of the world 

2
00:00:02,641 --> 00:00:03,474
revolves around you,
but every now and then I'll pop my head 

3
00:00:05,191 --> 00:00:08,040
out of the sand to try to take stock of 
what's going on outside of my world,

4
00:00:08,070 --> 00:00:08,903
America and English speaking youtube,
and it's a good time to start paying 

5
00:00:12,001 --> 00:00:12,834
attention because some of the new 
biggest channels in the world are 

6
00:00:14,911 --> 00:00:17,610
building their audiences totally outside
of Western countries,

7
00:00:17,850 --> 00:00:19,770
which means you probably haven't heard 
of them yet.

8
00:00:20,370 --> 00:00:23,850
And the one we're going to pay attention
to today is t series from India.

9
00:00:24,090 --> 00:00:28,470
T series is growing so fast they're set 
to pass pewdie pie in subscriber numbers

10
00:00:28,650 --> 00:00:29,483
in fewer than six months.
We're going to talk about why and how t 

11
00:00:32,461 --> 00:00:34,410
series got to the top.
Was it luck,

12
00:00:34,411 --> 00:00:35,490
timing,
fortune.

13
00:00:35,970 --> 00:00:37,350
We're going to talk all of that and 
more,

14
00:00:37,830 --> 00:00:40,410
but before we get into how t series shot
up the youtube ladder,

15
00:00:40,590 --> 00:00:42,030
let's give it a little bit of 
background.

16
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:44,880
T series is a bollywood music production
company started by gold,

17
00:00:44,881 --> 00:00:45,714
Sean Kumar.
They originally sold bootleg bollywood 

18
00:00:47,821 --> 00:00:49,620
songs,
but after some smart moves,

19
00:00:49,621 --> 00:00:53,190
explosive growth and their founder being
assassinated by the Mumbai underworld,

20
00:00:53,490 --> 00:00:55,950
they emerged on top in the Bollywood 
music scene,

21
00:00:55,980 --> 00:00:56,813
especially on youtube where they're the 
second largest channel in the world 

22
00:00:59,521 --> 00:01:00,354
right now,
but let's make that more tangible with 

23
00:01:02,101 --> 00:01:02,934
numbers.
PD Pie is set to grow by 9 million 

24
00:01:05,101 --> 00:01:08,880
subscribers this year.
In that same time period t series,

25
00:01:08,881 --> 00:01:09,714
we'll get 38 million subscribers.
To give you more context for how fast 

26
00:01:14,311 --> 00:01:15,144
that growth is,
there are only three channels in the 

27
00:01:17,011 --> 00:01:17,844
world with more than 38 million 
subscribers total and they're going to 

28
00:01:21,390 --> 00:01:25,230
gain that many subscribers in one year 
according to growth trends.

29
00:01:25,740 --> 00:01:28,890
At first glance,
this growth is completely baffling.

30
00:01:29,190 --> 00:01:31,800
How is this possible?
At this point,

31
00:01:31,801 --> 00:01:34,410
I'm just going to show you a few of 
their videos to give you a flavor of the

32
00:01:34,411 --> 00:01:35,520
kind of work that they do.

33
00:01:35,660 --> 00:01:36,493
Hi.

34
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:49,753
I mean it's good,
but good content doesn't explain the 

35
00:01:52,791 --> 00:01:53,624
full picture.
There are tons of good music video 

36
00:01:55,281 --> 00:01:57,200
channels that aren't growing nearly this
fast.

37
00:01:57,650 --> 00:02:00,110
So what else is going on here?
Well,

38
00:02:00,140 --> 00:02:02,660
it's ironic.
The same thing that helped a cutie pie,

39
00:02:02,690 --> 00:02:03,523
the youtube king get to where he is,
is now what is creating the new king of 

40
00:02:06,921 --> 00:02:09,320
Youtube.
It comes down to two factors.

41
00:02:09,380 --> 00:02:13,880
These factors are geographic opportunity
and content ecosystems.

42
00:02:15,050 --> 00:02:18,410
Let's start with geographic opportunity.
Five years ago,

43
00:02:18,411 --> 00:02:19,244
Matt Pat made a video called how Pewdie 
pie conquered youtube and in it he 

44
00:02:21,981 --> 00:02:25,790
argued Qd by had a unique advantage 
based on where he was from.

45
00:02:26,570 --> 00:02:27,403
Basically Pewdie Pie was able to draw 
from a larger audience pulled in his 

46
00:02:29,931 --> 00:02:30,764
contemporaries,
which gave him the geographic 

47
00:02:32,571 --> 00:02:33,404
opportunity to get ahead.
Today the place to be if you want 

48
00:02:36,171 --> 00:02:39,440
geographic opportunity in the largest 
audience is India.

49
00:02:41,750 --> 00:02:46,160
India has always had a huge population,
but what held India back in the past was

50
00:02:46,161 --> 00:02:49,550
having bad or no Internet connection.
But recently,

51
00:02:49,551 --> 00:02:53,270
especially in the last decade,
this has been radically changing.

52
00:02:53,750 --> 00:02:55,340
I don't want to bore you with too many 
numbers,

53
00:02:55,341 --> 00:02:57,710
but India has been coming online 
rapidly.

54
00:02:58,010 --> 00:02:58,843
To illustrate this,
there's a metric called Internet 

55
00:03:00,311 --> 00:03:01,144
penetration,
which just measures the percentage of 

56
00:03:02,471 --> 00:03:04,570
the country using the Internet.
Simple,

57
00:03:04,930 --> 00:03:08,560
so to get a baseline here are the last 
two decades in the US,

58
00:03:08,770 --> 00:03:09,603
pretty stagnant and nearly everyone who 
wants to be on the Internet is on the 

59
00:03:12,281 --> 00:03:13,114
Internet.
Now compare this with the last two 

60
00:03:14,861 --> 00:03:17,260
decades of Internet penetration in 
India.

61
00:03:17,740 --> 00:03:22,150
It's pretty staggering and as far as 
absolute number of Internet users,

62
00:03:22,450 --> 00:03:26,740
India is already well past the u s and 
Europe and is only behind China in total

63
00:03:26,741 --> 00:03:27,574
users,
and that's despite the fact that they 

64
00:03:29,471 --> 00:03:30,970
still have a long way to grow.

65
00:03:31,210 --> 00:03:32,043
Having only reached 30% penetration 
compared to the 80% of most modern 

66
00:03:35,201 --> 00:03:36,034
countries and leaving the geopolitical 
implications of this aside for a moment 

67
00:03:40,030 --> 00:03:42,160
on youtube,
this means only one thing.

68
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:43,353
Holy Cow.
There are a lot of people looking for 

69
00:03:45,581 --> 00:03:50,380
content in India and more new users log 
on every single day.

70
00:03:50,710 --> 00:03:53,140
Let's do the math.
Exponential audience size,

71
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:56,680
hungry for content.
Who is the biggest channel in India?

72
00:03:56,681 --> 00:04:00,010
Ready to give the people what they want?
T series.

73
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:03,700
They're soaking up all those new users 
like a sponge,

74
00:04:04,300 --> 00:04:05,133
but as if that wasn't enough.
Teasers has one other advantage that 

75
00:04:07,121 --> 00:04:10,720
seals the coffin for the borough.
Pewdie pie and just the rest of Youtube.

76
00:04:11,410 --> 00:04:16,410
The India content ecosystem is young and
because of that competition is weaker in

77
00:04:17,441 --> 00:04:18,850
America.
You may not realize it,

78
00:04:18,851 --> 00:04:21,430
but we have a pretty mature content 
ecosystem.

79
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:24,940
What I mean by that is while in the 
beginning things were like the wild west

80
00:04:24,941 --> 00:04:25,774
on Youtube,
the environment has grown with its 

81
00:04:27,311 --> 00:04:28,144
creators.

82
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:30,850
We've had people creating fulltime for a
while now.

83
00:04:30,970 --> 00:04:33,640
We've had a large companies use youtube 
for success.

84
00:04:33,850 --> 00:04:37,630
We've even had a generation of creators 
like me who grew up watching youtube.

85
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:40,360
Everyone's just had time to learn and 
adapt.

86
00:04:40,630 --> 00:04:41,463
This is a great thing for content.
It means there's more content than ever 

87
00:04:43,660 --> 00:04:45,700
and it's better than ever generally 
speaking,

88
00:04:45,970 --> 00:04:50,110
but it also means that competition for 
your eyeballs is fiercer than ever.

89
00:04:50,111 --> 00:04:50,944
In America and Europe today,
we have plenty of established channels 

90
00:04:53,741 --> 00:04:56,890
with professional budgets all competing 
with one another.

91
00:04:57,220 --> 00:04:58,053
This makes it hard to cut through and to
really stand out even for the biggest 

92
00:05:01,031 --> 00:05:04,390
and best channels.
This is also why people who start gaming

93
00:05:04,391 --> 00:05:07,720
channels today have no chance of 
becoming as big as purity clyde.

94
00:05:07,900 --> 00:05:10,900
He did it when the John was new young,
an undefined,

95
00:05:11,290 --> 00:05:13,690
don't get me wrong,
someone can still succeed on youtube,

96
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:17,350
but being first to market is always a 
unique advantage.

97
00:05:17,590 --> 00:05:18,423
If pewdie pie started today,
he'd be just one of a thousand similar 

98
00:05:21,041 --> 00:05:21,874
personalities all shouting for the same 
breathing room and just contrast this 

99
00:05:25,181 --> 00:05:26,014
with India where new creators are just 
starting to take advantage of the huge 

100
00:05:29,621 --> 00:05:30,454
opportunity over there.
Most of the audience and the creators 

101
00:05:33,101 --> 00:05:35,530
have only recently gotten Internet 
access,

102
00:05:36,100 --> 00:05:36,933
which means that India is youtube 
content environment is at minimum 

103
00:05:39,461 --> 00:05:41,890
several years younger than most 
developed countries.

104
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:43,473
This has created a unique moment for 
professional operationally t series who 

105
00:05:46,571 --> 00:05:51,010
can afford to mass produce big budget 
music videos to dominate the competition

106
00:05:51,011 --> 00:05:53,770
and grab the market share before anyone 
else gets there.

107
00:05:55,330 --> 00:05:58,310
Now I know what you're thinking.
What about elephant in the room?

108
00:05:58,420 --> 00:05:59,560
China,
China,

109
00:05:59,561 --> 00:06:00,970
China,
because China,

110
00:06:01,930 --> 00:06:04,900
you would think all these factors apply 
equally to them as well.

111
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:08,020
Why aren't we seeing the t series of 
China after all?

112
00:06:08,021 --> 00:06:11,380
They have just as large of a population.
They're actually ahead of India in their

113
00:06:11,381 --> 00:06:12,214
technological boom,
which means a larger potential audience 

114
00:06:14,321 --> 00:06:16,030
size.
What's holding them back?

115
00:06:16,390 --> 00:06:19,030
Well,
China is the story of what might've been

116
00:06:19,060 --> 00:06:21,520
except for a little something called the
Great Wall of China,

117
00:06:22,060 --> 00:06:22,893
the great firewall it is.
You may have heard the Chinese 

118
00:06:25,151 --> 00:06:28,780
government sensors the Internet and 
starting from the 2008 rights in Tibet.

119
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:29,793
One website they blocked is youtube.
So while China has their own youtube 

120
00:06:33,161 --> 00:06:36,130
called [inaudible],
which is a totally original title,

121
00:06:36,430 --> 00:06:37,263
it's mostly a national brand.
So for now at least it looks like 

122
00:06:39,521 --> 00:06:40,354
India's friendliness towards 
globalization will make it a stronger 

123
00:06:42,281 --> 00:06:43,114
competitor in worldwide entertainment.
While China's nationalist policies have 

124
00:06:46,421 --> 00:06:47,980
meant that national brands like you,
cool,

125
00:06:47,981 --> 00:06:50,140
we'll succeed,
which is an interesting trade off.

126
00:06:50,530 --> 00:06:53,140
China prevents their population from 
engaging with global,

127
00:06:53,141 --> 00:06:53,974
sometimes better products,
but in turn it gives their local 

128
00:06:56,321 --> 00:06:58,900
companies that normally would have been 
out competed a long time ago.

129
00:06:58,910 --> 00:07:00,850
The chance to grow into huge 
corporations,

130
00:07:00,851 --> 00:07:03,490
which can fight on the world stage for 
influence,

131
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:04,473
but it's hard to tell how successful any
of their creators have been since 

132
00:07:06,971 --> 00:07:09,640
they're not playing on the same field as
any other country.

133
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:12,610
You really can't compare numbers.
If you don't go to the Olympics,

134
00:07:12,611 --> 00:07:15,760
you can't win a medal no matter how many
people you have banging your drops.

135
00:07:16,630 --> 00:07:19,720
So to summarize this video,
China's playing by themselves insulating

136
00:07:19,721 --> 00:07:20,554
their internet platform so that it can 
survive and grow while any is choosing 

137
00:07:23,231 --> 00:07:24,064
to leverage its huge population to 
participate in the larger community and 

138
00:07:27,281 --> 00:07:30,730
with its technological boom only getting
started soon.

139
00:07:30,731 --> 00:07:33,700
India will be a major player in the 
youtube ecosystem.

140
00:07:34,030 --> 00:07:36,280
It looks like Bollywood Music is here to
stay,

141
00:07:36,610 --> 00:07:39,820
which is cool with me because have you 
ever seen a bollywood movie?

142
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:44,680
Their action heroes have a level of bad 
ass Uri that breaks the Badass meter and

143
00:07:44,681 --> 00:07:48,070
turns into comedy,
which is hilariously amazing.

144
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:49,353
Yeah,
I'll just outro with the future of 

145
00:07:50,231 --> 00:07:51,064
Youtube here.

146
00:08:08,310 --> 00:08:08,930
Yeah.

147
00:08:08,930 --> 00:08:11,400
Hey,
are you tired of talking about land lock

148
00:08:11,401 --> 00:08:12,234
nationalistic governments?
Is Bollywood dominating your favorite 

149
00:08:14,901 --> 00:08:18,380
creators is all this geo,
you tubical talk boring you to death.

150
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:20,980
Well you've come to the right place,
the coffee breaks,

151
00:08:20,981 --> 00:08:21,814
shilling,
outro because we're done with that 

152
00:08:23,571 --> 00:08:24,404
international stuff and going back to 
what matters my life in America because 

153
00:08:27,681 --> 00:08:29,930
I need your support after some 
reflection,

154
00:08:29,931 --> 00:08:30,764
based on the research I showed today,
I realized that I have essentially 

155
00:08:32,691 --> 00:08:33,524
started an anti popularity channel.
I started a year ago in an already 

156
00:08:36,591 --> 00:08:37,424
matured environment.
My style of video meets infrequent 

157
00:08:39,081 --> 00:08:39,914
uploads and because I came after Evan 
Puschak somehow monopolize the video 

158
00:08:42,711 --> 00:08:44,720
essay,
everyone thinks I'm nerd writer too.

159
00:08:45,050 --> 00:08:48,380
I need all the help I can get.
So if you've got money,

160
00:08:48,410 --> 00:08:50,840
if you're swimming in the cheese,
that makes one of us.

161
00:08:50,930 --> 00:08:51,763
So if you found this video valuable and 
you want to take this relationship to 

162
00:08:53,991 --> 00:08:54,824
the next level,
consider supporting me on Patriot and 

163
00:08:56,341 --> 00:08:59,640
making that two of us that are rolling 
in the dough one or $5 a month.

164
00:08:59,670 --> 00:09:01,170
It's up to you.
Stop whenever you want.

165
00:09:01,830 --> 00:09:03,680
All right.
Thanks for coming to the coffee breaks.

166
00:09:03,681 --> 00:09:04,411
