1
00:00:00,750 --> 00:00:01,583
Axes approach to marketing has been one 
of the most unique and brilliant 

2
00:00:03,931 --> 00:00:04,764
campaigns in history,
but their marketing genius has been 

3
00:00:07,021 --> 00:00:09,720
traded by what appears to just be a 
cheap tactic,

4
00:00:10,050 --> 00:00:13,530
advertising sex.
But what made it successful was not what

5
00:00:13,531 --> 00:00:15,080
they were advertising.
Instead,

6
00:00:15,100 --> 00:00:17,970
he was who they were advertising to and 
how they did it.

7
00:00:17,971 --> 00:00:20,160
By ignoring all social roles of 
delicacy,

8
00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:23,280
love them or hate them,
acts as a beautifully consistent brand.

9
00:00:23,610 --> 00:00:25,830
Their marketing style matches their 
product perfectly,

10
00:00:26,280 --> 00:00:27,113
just like their cheap,
almost overpoweringly fragrant body 

11
00:00:28,951 --> 00:00:29,784
spray that punches you in the mouth 
within stench acts as marketed to the 

12
00:00:32,131 --> 00:00:32,964
male ego with one singular thought.
Men especially pubescent boys don't 

13
00:00:37,141 --> 00:00:39,000
understand subtlety.
In fact,

14
00:00:39,030 --> 00:00:41,160
it may never be possible to be clear 
enough.

15
00:00:41,310 --> 00:00:42,143
And so while other Cologne brands,
we're timidly dancing around the notion 

16
00:00:44,791 --> 00:00:45,624
that mindware fragrances to give women 
acts decided skip the foreplay and go 

17
00:00:48,421 --> 00:00:49,254
for the Jaguar.

18
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:51,600
Their brand won't make you slightly less
smelly,

19
00:00:51,601 --> 00:00:53,850
slightly more classy,
or make you fall in love.

20
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:57,090
Their brand will get you laid and not 
just by one woman,

21
00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:00,360
but as many women as you want and no six
pack required.

22
00:01:00,361 --> 00:01:01,194
You can be the biggest loser in school,
but the second you spray on axe body 

23
00:01:03,511 --> 00:01:05,160
spray,
you become a chick magnet.

24
00:01:05,161 --> 00:01:05,994
So powerful it would make James Bond 
jealous all for the low low price of 

25
00:01:09,001 --> 00:01:09,834
four 99 but before they launched in 
America in 2002 as a bottle of sex 

26
00:01:13,171 --> 00:01:15,980
pheromone x had to figure out who they 
stood for.

27
00:01:16,410 --> 00:01:18,120
After all,
if you try to appeal to everyone,

28
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:18,993
you appeal to no one.
So an efforts of figuring out the 

29
00:01:20,581 --> 00:01:22,920
perfect audience for their over the top 
marketing campaign.

30
00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:23,783
They decided to do a study.
Acts took nearly a hundred men out to 

31
00:01:26,221 --> 00:01:27,054
bars and watch them try to pick up girls
trying to classify different kinds of 

32
00:01:30,061 --> 00:01:30,894
potential acts consumers,
they eventually realized that their 

33
00:01:33,061 --> 00:01:35,940
target audience would not be the already
confident mail.

34
00:01:36,390 --> 00:01:37,223
They didn't need help getting them.
They would sell to the awkward acne 

35
00:01:39,691 --> 00:01:41,850
faced average Joe who didn't have a 
chance,

36
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:45,060
but the kind of guy who blushes at the 
mere thought of approaching his crush,

37
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:48,570
the technical term for their audience 
was the insecure novice.

38
00:01:48,810 --> 00:01:50,520
And you can see this play out in their 
ads.

39
00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:51,443
Up until now.
Brands like old spice and colognes had 

40
00:01:53,161 --> 00:01:56,880
always cast male models to get the 
female model but not acts.

41
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:57,953
They decided that with their body spray,
the Dorky male would get the female 

42
00:02:00,181 --> 00:02:01,770
model.
They cast it.

43
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:05,730
Anybody except the stereotypical hump.
It was the kid with glasses,

44
00:02:05,731 --> 00:02:07,800
the average guy who's on an unlucky 
streak.

45
00:02:08,070 --> 00:02:09,660
But as for the female lead,
they applied,

46
00:02:09,661 --> 00:02:13,560
their enough is never enough role and 
Swan dove into the deep end of the nerds

47
00:02:13,561 --> 00:02:14,394
fantasy life.
They consistently cast the perfect 10 

48
00:02:16,741 --> 00:02:17,574
Amazonia Bikini clad female lead doesn't
care that acts hasn't transformed you 

49
00:02:20,881 --> 00:02:23,130
into a hunk.
You don't need to be a hunt when you can

50
00:02:23,131 --> 00:02:23,964
smell like a $5 candy backs.
And this has worked beautifully for a 

51
00:02:27,001 --> 00:02:28,740
long time.
And even right now,

52
00:02:28,741 --> 00:02:29,574
access had the lion's share at the male 
fragrance industry with the only real 

53
00:02:32,311 --> 00:02:34,320
casualty being high school hallways 
everywhere.

54
00:02:34,890 --> 00:02:35,723
But the way they did it wasn't just 
selling sex acts reinvented how to sell 

55
00:02:40,081 --> 00:02:41,820
sex and who to sell it to.

56
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:55,273
Okay.
