Speaker 1:          00:00          If you're like me, you assume the rest of the world revolves around you, but every now and then I'll pop my head out of the sand to try to take stock of what's going on outside of my world, America and English speaking youtube, and it's a good time to start paying attention because some of the new biggest channels in the world are building their audiences totally outside of Western countries, which means you probably haven't heard of them yet. And the one we're going to pay attention to today is t series from India. T series is growing so fast they're set to pass pewdie pie in subscriber numbers in fewer than six months. We're going to talk about why and how t series got to the top. Was it luck, timing, fortune. We're going to talk all of that and more, but before we get into how t series shot up the youtube ladder, let's give it a little bit of background.

Speaker 1:          00:42          T series is a bollywood music production company started by gold, Sean Kumar. They originally sold bootleg bollywood songs, but after some smart moves, explosive growth and their founder being assassinated by the Mumbai underworld, they emerged on top in the Bollywood music scene, especially on youtube where they're the second largest channel in the world right now, but let's make that more tangible with numbers. PD Pie is set to grow by 9 million subscribers this year. In that same time period t series, we'll get 38 million subscribers. To give you more context for how fast that growth is, there are only three channels in the world with more than 38 million subscribers total and they're going to gain that many subscribers in one year according to growth trends. At first glance, this growth is completely baffling. How is this possible? At this point, I'm just going to show you a few of their videos to give you a flavor of the kind of work that they do.

Speaker 2:          01:35          Hi.

Speaker 1:          01:48          I mean it's good, but good content doesn't explain the full picture. There are tons of good music video channels that aren't growing nearly this fast. So what else is going on here? Well, it's ironic. The same thing that helped a cutie pie, the youtube king get to where he is, is now what is creating the new king of Youtube. It comes down to two factors. These factors are geographic opportunity and content ecosystems. Let's start with geographic opportunity. Five years ago, Matt Pat made a video called how Pewdie pie conquered youtube and in it he argued Qd by had a unique advantage based on where he was from. Basically Pewdie Pie was able to draw from a larger audience pulled in his contemporaries, which gave him the geographic opportunity to get ahead. Today the place to be if you want geographic opportunity in the largest audience is India.

Speaker 1:          02:41          India has always had a huge population, but what held India back in the past was having bad or no Internet connection. But recently, especially in the last decade, this has been radically changing. I don't want to bore you with too many numbers, but India has been coming online rapidly. To illustrate this, there's a metric called Internet penetration, which just measures the percentage of the country using the Internet. Simple, so to get a baseline here are the last two decades in the US, pretty stagnant and nearly everyone who wants to be on the Internet is on the Internet. Now compare this with the last two decades of Internet penetration in India. It's pretty staggering and as far as absolute number of Internet users, India is already well past the u s and Europe and is only behind China in total users, and that's despite the fact that they still have a long way to grow.

Speaker 1:          03:31          Having only reached 30% penetration compared to the 80% of most modern countries and leaving the geopolitical implications of this aside for a moment on youtube, this means only one thing. Holy Cow. There are a lot of people looking for content in India and more new users log on every single day. Let's do the math. Exponential audience size, hungry for content. Who is the biggest channel in India? Ready to give the people what they want? T series. They're soaking up all those new users like a sponge, but as if that wasn't enough. Teasers has one other advantage that seals the coffin for the borough. Pewdie pie and just the rest of Youtube. The India content ecosystem is young and because of that competition is weaker in America. You may not realize it, but we have a pretty mature content ecosystem. What I mean by that is while in the beginning things were like the wild west on Youtube, the environment has grown with its creators.

Speaker 1:          04:28          We've had people creating fulltime for a while now. We've had a large companies use youtube for success. We've even had a generation of creators like me who grew up watching youtube. Everyone's just had time to learn and adapt. This is a great thing for content. It means there's more content than ever and it's better than ever generally speaking, but it also means that competition for your eyeballs is fiercer than ever. In America and Europe today, we have plenty of established channels with professional budgets all competing with one another. This makes it hard to cut through and to really stand out even for the biggest and best channels. This is also why people who start gaming channels today have no chance of becoming as big as purity clyde. He did it when the John was new young, an undefined, don't get me wrong, someone can still succeed on youtube, but being first to market is always a unique advantage.

Speaker 1:          05:17          If pewdie pie started today, he'd be just one of a thousand similar personalities all shouting for the same breathing room and just contrast this with India where new creators are just starting to take advantage of the huge opportunity over there. Most of the audience and the creators have only recently gotten Internet access, which means that India is youtube content environment is at minimum several years younger than most developed countries. This has created a unique moment for professional operationally t series who can afford to mass produce big budget music videos to dominate the competition and grab the market share before anyone else gets there. Now I know what you're thinking. What about elephant in the room?

Speaker 3:          05:58          China, China, China, because China,

Speaker 1:          06:01          you would think all these factors apply equally to them as well. Why aren't we seeing the t series of China after all? They have just as large of a population. They're actually ahead of India in their technological boom, which means a larger potential audience size. What's holding them back? Well, China is the story of what might've been except for a little something called the Great Wall of China, the great firewall it is. You may have heard the Chinese government sensors the Internet and starting from the 2008 rights in Tibet. One website they blocked is youtube. So while China has their own youtube called [inaudible], which is a totally original title, it's mostly a national brand. So for now at least it looks like India's friendliness towards globalization will make it a stronger competitor in worldwide entertainment. While China's nationalist policies have meant that national brands like you, cool, we'll succeed, which is an interesting trade off.

Speaker 1:          06:50          China prevents their population from engaging with global, sometimes better products, but in turn it gives their local companies that normally would have been out competed a long time ago. The chance to grow into huge corporations, which can fight on the world stage for influence, but it's hard to tell how successful any of their creators have been since they're not playing on the same field as any other country. You really can't compare numbers. If you don't go to the Olympics, you can't win a medal no matter how many people you have banging your drops. So to summarize this video, China's playing by themselves insulating their internet platform so that it can survive and grow while any is choosing to leverage its huge population to participate in the larger community and with its technological boom only getting started soon. India will be a major player in the youtube ecosystem. It looks like Bollywood Music is here to stay, which is cool with me because have you ever seen a bollywood movie? Their action heroes have a level of bad ass Uri that breaks the Badass meter and turns into comedy, which is hilariously amazing. Yeah, I'll just outro with the future of Youtube here.

Speaker 3:          08:08          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          08:08          Hey, are you tired of talking about land lock nationalistic governments? Is Bollywood dominating your favorite creators is all this geo, you tubical talk boring you to death. Well you've come to the right place, the coffee breaks, shilling, outro because we're done with that international stuff and going back to what matters my life in America because I need your support after some reflection, based on the research I showed today, I realized that I have essentially started an anti popularity channel. I started a year ago in an already matured environment. My style of video meets infrequent uploads and because I came after Evan Puschak somehow monopolize the video essay, everyone thinks I'm nerd writer too. I need all the help I can get. So if you've got money, if you're swimming in the cheese, that makes one of us. So if you found this video valuable and you want to take this relationship to the next level, consider supporting me on Patriot and making that two of us that are rolling in the dough one or $5 a month. It's up to you. Stop whenever you want. All right. Thanks for coming to the coffee breaks. Shilling. Outro. We appreciate you being here. A big thanks to my patrons. Big thanks to the music producers linked below and here and thanks to social blade for making youtube analytics so accessible. Stay awesome. Youtube.
