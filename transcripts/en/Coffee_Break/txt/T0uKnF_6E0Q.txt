Speaker 1:          00:00          The school of life is a youtube channel, online business and physical school that professors to teach people about philosophy and emotional intelligence, but unfortunately they fall far short of their own standard to the point it's almost offensive. The problem with the school of life is threefold. They pretend to be unbiased. They're selling a shallow, narrow view of philosophy and they are relentless profit tears in the worst possible way, but first, who exactly is the school of life? I say who because while many people work for the school of life, one man in particular, the founder, the main creator of most of their content, alon to Bhutan. If you're unfamiliar with Alonda Bhutan's work, he's a sort of self stylized pop philosopher, but his works are really more something like opinion pieces on life with a ragtag assortment of philosophy sprinkled in some of his works include how to think more about sex art as therapy on love.

Speaker 1:          00:44          If you're thinking that you already sounds closer to oprah than he does to aristotle, that's not far from the opinion of many others. Alon is a polarizing figure. He's in disrepute by many philosophers as well as many book reviewers who both criticized him for Lauren, his books to appeal to a mass market crowd. On the other hand, his books have been widely sold and the school of life, his brainchild, both one of the biggest audiences for any philosophy channel on Youtube and Alon is important to understand because he is the father of many of the ideas pedaled from the school of life, but now that we're clear on who's behind this, let's get on with the problems at the school of life. Number one, they pretend to be unbiased and this is what started my dislike of the school of life. They pretend to be unbiased, will actually having a very particular world view and perspective on philosophy. Here's such a claim in their intro video. What is the school of life? This school of life and openminded rigorous on ideological organization. Let's hear that again and open minded and rigorous on ideological organization, openminded and an ideological, but then when you click on their videos, all you get is a constant stream of alonzo values and thoughts without even the slightest critique of them as an example are open minded and an ideological organization has this to say about children. It's almost a biological level.

Speaker 2:          01:56          Kids will kill the relationship that produce them.

Speaker 1:          01:59          I don't know where Alon gets this massive chip on his shoulder, but not all kids are harbingers of doom to a relationship, but maintaining the status of being unbiased. Alon also manages to quash several millennia of debate with this nuance, an ideological statement about religion,

Speaker 2:          02:13          what religion teachers isn't about what's true, but about what many of us here on earth desperately wanted to be true.

Speaker 1:          02:21          Openminded, rigorous on ideological organization.

Speaker 2:          02:24          Religious beliefs are of course technically falls, but that coming from a very tender and vulnerable place which needs our empathy. Of course atheists are technically right, but there's no point getting mad and by the apparent irrationality of the religious

Speaker 1:          02:40          pack up your bags, boys, Alon and the crack team of philosophers. At the school of life, have it all figured out and I wanted to be clear, I don't have a problem with the school of life producing a video like this. They're welcome to their opinion, but don't tell your viewer that you're open minded and an ideological so while the school of life claims to be unbiased, they make videos. They give a singular, narrow ideological answer to some of the most important philosophical questions. At their best. This means they're self deceptive and saying that they are unbiased. At worst, they are deliberately misleading their audience in order to gain the appearance of objectivity, and in this one point I think alon just might be a philosopher in the definition of nature himself. Nisha had this to say about philosophers and their prejudices. Philosophers, they're all advocates who do not wish to be regarded as such.

Speaker 1:          03:21          Generally astute defenders also have their prejudices which they dove is true problem to. They're selling bad philosophy. They do this by delivering a shallow reductionist viewpoint that lets people stoke a sense of pseudo intellectual ism and spares them from the pains of contradiction to be found in many worldviews. Many defenders of the school of life might say that they are best viewed as an introduction to philosophy and a seven minute video on plato can't possibly be expected to carry everything that he said and I would agree with you, but that's not what bothers me about the school of life's work. The problem is instead of conveying a true, albeit simplistic view of the philosophers ideas, many times instead they extract a philosopher's ideas and mesh them into their viewpoint until they resemble some sort of self help. Nonsense, which is not at all how the philosophers work was meant to be taken.

Speaker 1:          04:04          For example, with Plato, they can turn them into a dating coach offering the following relationship advice. Second big idea. Let your lover change you. That sounds weird. If you think that love means finding someone who wants you just the way you are in the symposium, Plato's play about a dinner party where a group of friends drink too much and get talking about love, sex, and relationships. Plato says, True Love is admiration, and on the surface it seems like, well, yeah, maybe plato did say that, but the point is they're totally contorting the author's work and achievement played his major contribution to philosophy or his theories of forum, dialectical method and political theories, not his thoughts and the ladies. If you're going to reduce a philosopher down to seven minutes, at least fill it with their major contributions to the philosophical world, and sometimes they do worse than this in this video, along completely misunderstands the mind body problem, which is the question of how our mental thought and consciousness controls our physical body.

Speaker 1:          04:59          Completely missing this. Instead, alon explains that, wow, it's a darn shame that everyone judges you so much on your luck's instead of what's in your head. The so called mind body problem is one of the greatest and most quietly painful conundrums in philosophy. The problem is rooted in the fact that in the eyes of other people, all of us are automatically and stop and associated with our bodies, which includes, of course our faces and this kind of feel good. Philosophy is more than just unhelpful. It's counterproductive because it can cause people to think that they possess and understanding of philosophy when in reality they have only been taught shallow and disfigured elements of it. Finally, as if that wasn't all enough, we come to the third and final problem of the school of life. They're hucksters and profiteers. They established themselves as some sort of guide of life and use that position to sell merchandise that is priced so high it borders on the insane.

Speaker 1:          05:49          How much would you say this imperfect pot is worth? It's literally a pot with blemishes on it. While it can be yours, $75 or how about this? Regular Candle? $50, but best of all and so telling of how money grubbing this operation really is. Is there an anticapitalist notebooks which they shamelessly ironically sell for the very pro capitalistic price of $20. How does some of this video, I think alon his whole school of life as best criticized through his own view of business businesses should not. He says so desires, but instead cell needs, and this is the crucial distinction he makes between desires and needs. A desire is what you feel like you want at the moment, and Anita is something that serves your longterm wellbeing and I think you're right alone, so why in the world are you selling a who should you be with card game for $15, I guess, at that doesn't fall under the need section for most people, and the same is true for their actual content in the same way at the school of life should stop selling the desires of the people. Cheap, watery self-help philosophy, drivel that reinforces their belief system and instead sell to the needs of the people are real examination of what the philosophers have been saying all along and help explain how one best ought to examine their lives because in the end it's these true needs being met that Plato and Aristotle would say produces a life full of eudaimonia. In other words, a life well lived.
