Speaker 1:          00:00          I like to exercise, but the time it takes up in my day bothers me. The time I spend running, I could be doing anything else on one of these days. A thought occurred to me, putting aside for a moment, the ancillary benefits of exercise, like energy, physique, mental clarity, et cetera. Do the life length and benefits you get from exercising outweigh the time you spend doing it? Well, let's find out. So according to a study in 2012 published in the peer reviewed BMJ that included over 650,000 participants, moderate exercise, like briskly walking, cycling, etc. For 2.5 hours per week, we'll add on average 3.4 to 4.5 years to your life. But how many hours is that? If you live 3.4 years longer, which is the low end of what we'd expect, that means that you've gained 30,000 hours. But not all of that is productive time because you have to sleep accounting for that.

Speaker 1:          00:46          You've gained 20,000 but you have to spend time to get this reward. So let's say you work out for your entire adult life starting at 20 years old and he lived to be 80 so you've been working out 2.5 hours per week for 60 years. That comes out to a total cost of 7,800 hours. So what does this mean? Well, it means the way we think about exercising is wrong. You weren't spending time exercising. You're actually creating time for every hour you spend exercising. You'll get 2.5 hours on the back end of your life. So don't feel bad going to the gym or stealing a few minutes for a walk. Not only will you get that hour back to spend at the office, but you're also going to get extra time to spend with friends and family. Now, obviously this isn't the secret to eternal youth. There are diminishing returns on this, so don't run down the street thinking that you've cheated death. But let's say that you're one of the 80% of Americans, 80% of British, 60% of Australian adults or anyone in the developed world who doesn't get to wait five hours of exercise a week. It's not that you don't have time to exercise. Actually the reverse is true. You can't afford not to.

Speaker 2:          01:50          Okay.
