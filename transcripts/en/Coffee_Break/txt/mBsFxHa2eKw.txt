Speaker 1:          00:00          For as long as there have been poor and rich people have devised clever ways to redistribute wealth. Whether it be taxes, political manifestos or buy more barbaric means, but you may still be left unsatisfied with the current system wondering where is your cut you after all are smarter than the average person yet stuck with an average bank account. Today we're going to change that. We're cutting corners and making money moves because there is a business plan that can create massive amounts of wealth for you with minimal effort though you may have to leave a few ethics at the door. I'm talking of course about the pyramid scheme.

Speaker 1:          00:36          Before we begin, you should know what you're getting yourself into. A pyramid scheme is a business blend where recruits buy in to the scheme by paying people above them and then can recruit people below them and profit from what those new people pay in. One of the most popular variants of the scheme is the airplane game and it works like this. You buy in for $1,500 under someone else as a passenger and every time the flight gets filled everyone gets promoted. Passenger to crew crew to copilot and copilot to pilot until after a few full flights. You become the pilot and once you have a full flight, you finally exit by getting paid $12,000 eight times your original investment. It sounds easy enough, but there's a very serious problem. This traditional type of pyramid scheme involving direct buy-ins is illegal in most modern countries because the business plan is built on the idea of an exponential chain of people, which is unsustainable living the majority of the people at the bottom having lost money, which is a bummer if you have dreams of Egyptian polygons, but to the less scrupulous among you fear not for where there's a way to make money hand over fist.

Speaker 1:          01:34          There's usually a legal way to do that and that holds true for pyramid schemes. So here are the six steps to creating a perfectly legal pyramid scheme.

Speaker 1:          01:43          Step one, find a product. Don't worry. It doesn't have to be that good of a product or competitive in the open market because you're not really going to be selling this product in the traditional sense. A product to a pyramid scheme is more like poker chips to a casino there. The legal way you make money change hands. Imagine we take the structure of a pyramid scheme and instead of the buy end being cash, you make it a product. This way you can say you're providing a good or service to your customers even if your customers are just the people working for you. Now, there is one thing to think about when choosing a product in order to pay every person along the chain of the pyramid enough. It's important that you have high profit margins and typical wholesale margins just aren't going to cut it, so triple the price of your product and call it premium.

Speaker 1:          02:25          Again, don't worry about demand. Your employees will be purchasing your overpriced products hoping to get rich, not to save money. Step two, make a payout structure. You might think this should be straightforward, but whatever you do, do not make this simple or understandable. You should have two goals in mind when doing this. One, keep most of the profits going to the top while making people feel like the bottom has a chance of making it because poor people need hope to. And secondly, you need a constant stream of new recruits joining and buying in, so make sure the path to wealth is paved by constantly recruiting other people, not actually selling the product. Besides your best customers are people who work for you anyways. You've made a good payout structure at when people feel like making it is always a year or two away and they felt like that for five years.

Speaker 1:          03:08          That completes the fundamentals. You've got your business plan up and running and now you need some underlings. This is where we get to marketing. Selling your pyramid scheme is all about messaging, so focus on what your recruits one money and time freedom, which brings us to step three, so a financial fantasy. Here's some examples of what that might look like. If you could close your eyes and imagine your dream lifestyle, your ideal combination of work and play. Choose the largest industry in the world for the biggest opportunity. Imagine being part of a company that is created a life changing financial freedom for people just like it.

Speaker 2:          03:41          Hold on. A golf course, half a million dollars, $110,000 a hundred thousand dollars a few thousand, a minimum of 10,000 but the freedom of owning an online automated business that's priceless.

Speaker 1:          03:53          And bragging about it on the Internet, even more priceless. But sometimes this fantasy can backfire if people don't fully believe in. If that happens, this top recruiter says you can still close them by pointing out the problems in their lives and using it against them.

Speaker 3:          04:06          One of the biggest things that I teach is stack up enough problems that they have in their personal life. And when you compare it to the money, I say they're in. Well, if you found out that right now that relationship is on the rocks, we were like, Dang, dude. Yeah, your relationship, right? I mean, are you okay with that? What's gonna happen with the kids? Like who's going to get, who have you thought about that? So like Joe [inaudible] joint custody. Is it going to be like, yeah, she got to take half and all of a sudden they're like, holy crap, okay, yeah, I need a fix this thing. Now all of a sudden I'm like, okay, great. Here's the solution.

Speaker 1:          04:37          All problems can be exploited including marital struggles and family problems and all problems can be solved by joining as a final part of this vision for the fantasy life till you recruits, they aren't getting hired. They're starting their own company. You should call them independent business owners for a couple of reasons. First, it minimizes your legal liability if they aren't full employees. Second, if you're going to build a scam off hope, there's no better source than the American dream of owning your own business. Now it's time to start thinking about audience. You don't want to try to appeal to everyone, otherwise you will appeal to no one. So you have to think about who you want to target with your message, which brings us to step four, the three key groups, group one, family and friends. Biggie smalls once said, keep your family and business completely separated.

Speaker 1:          05:22          But Steve Jobs said, think different. So while everyone else is following common sense advice, you will make a family business and business and family like someone who can't help but shoe horn in politics. They every single conversation you want to teach your followers that all conversations can be turned into sales pitches group to young people. Nobody is more gullible and sure of themselves than an 18 to 22 year old. So get them while they're hot, naive and young group three poor people, whatever you do, don't waste money targeting big fish. Rich people don't join pyramid schemes. They start them. So instead you want to think differently and go for the poorest you can find. You'd be shocked with hardworking people can scrape together if you tell them success is only a purchase away. Immigrant families, poor areas of town or going overseas to find entire populations of poor people are all great options as this recruiter will show. There really is no such thing as not having enough money.

Speaker 4:          06:14          Nobody never doesn't have the money to go to the same job for emergency purchasing operation.

Speaker 1:          06:29          Look, I know it's your first time and by this point you may feel a little sick about all this exploitation and there's no shame in that. Queasiness is just ethics leaving the body. But don't worry, after your fifth time delivering empty promises to the hopeful eyes of a single mother of two, you really don't feel anything anymore. And so you know, many of your business counterparts have already achieved success targeting Hispanics. So make sure you're not late to the party though. And don't forget to utilize technology as you do. So with Google ads, you can target the bottom 50% of society. Choose your target demographic, lower that add rate, and away you go. So you've got your fundamentals, you've got your marketing and recruiting done, you've got your Google ads running, but soon your workers may get burnt out. And to extend their mileage. It's important to learn how to manage discontent workers.

Speaker 1:          07:15          This is a vital part of any company, but especially one where your employees are doing all the recruiting and buying. And most of them aren't making any money. Step five, the training attempt failure event loop. The way to keep your independent business owners committed isn't to make them happy, but rather keep them thinking success is right around the corner. You can do this by first innercising that proper training takes time. You'll tell them that learning to be an effective leader is a process and takes practice. This is followed by an attempt by them to recruit and sell with minimal results. They don't pay much. They will get down on themselves for their failure at which point you need to make sure to step in and throw a massive pump up event or meeting. It's imperative that each of these meetings, do you have a couple examples of people who have achieved monetary success with your scheme because this will signal to everyone else that they can make it. Prop up those winners on stage and let the survivorship bias do the talking.

Speaker 5:          08:09          That was awesome.

Speaker 1:          08:22          Anybody can do it should be your message. In reality. Of course, studies of over 350 of your competitors have found that 99.6% of recruits lose money. But we don't have to tell them that. Just keep focusing on the winning.

Speaker 4:          08:35          We're going to, which so much you may even get tired of winning. I just say, please, please, it's two bucks winning. We can't take it anymore.

Speaker 1:          08:45          And unfortunately, some people may get tired of winning and if that happens, it's time to move to step six. Cut off the bad apples. Legal pyramid schemes eventually get a reputation because they all resemble one another. And no matter how much you convince people that you're different, you will get a bad reputation in the world at large, which can in turn discourage your recruits. The way to get around this is not by denying the bad opinions are out there instead, except misdirect and discredit them. In the past, people want stock. The earth was flat, seems pretty ridiculous, right? At the time, people didn't know any differently. The same can be said for the direct selling and multilevel marketing industry. So when comparing legitimate direct selling companies to a pyramid scheme or any type of scam will seem as ridiculous as the earth being flat. You've done a good job when you don't have to look over your workers shoulders you've taught them to monitor for hate themselves and they will go out of their own way to avoid negative opinions about your company all on their own.

Speaker 1:          09:44          Once you have these six steps handled, you will at last be a successful illegal pyramid scheme, controlling millions of workers, paying pennies on the dollar for worth this products you sell back to your workers at triple the price workers who, well trying to make their own fortune don't realize they're busy building doors off nothing but hope alone. You have designed a wealth redistribution system of such hubris that Marx himself ought to be envious except your taking from the mediocre and giving to those who truly deserve it. You, you who have sacrificed everything, ethics and all for this dream, this dream of being successful, of having it all. And finally you can taste it.

Speaker 4:          10:23          Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, oh,

Speaker 1:          10:41          oh got a little carried away there.

Speaker 1:          10:48          I've got a few more things to say at the end of this video and also a word from our president. But first we have to talk about today's sponsor skillshare. Do you like learning things? I think you do. I do too. And skillshare is a great place to do that. It's got thousands of classes and tutorials from experts to help you learn things. Things like animation, things like editing, things like photography. But mostly for me, I liked the editing part but um, pretty much you can find whatever you want. If you can think of it. They probably have it even stuff from people like Chris Cause that in a nutshell, I think that's how you say his name. Um, they did a great class on breaking down their animation style. It's really cool. So go check them out. Their annual subscription is less than $10 a month and if you use Promo code coffee break link below the first 500 people, we'll get two months free. So that's it. Skillshare, click the link below first 500 people two months free. Okay, so back to pyramid schemes real quick before you go, pause, pause. I'm at the end of editing this video. You probably could. Um, but I realized

Speaker 6:          11:54          I didn't say explicitly that this is sarcastic or kind of sad tire. I know I probably shouldn't have to say that because it's rather obvious but um, I don't know if 2019 we'll have sarcasm anymore. So yes, yes, it is sad to her. Don't do that. Don't start a pyramid scheme. I just wanted to be explicit about it so no one could misunderstand me. Um, I want to just point you towards some amazing resources that I found really useful while doing research and creating this video. Originally I was going to do it a very serious look at, um, you know, multilevel marketing, that sort of thing and I found super useful the following three resources for maybe a first, the dream podcast. Go check it out. It's pretty new, incredible deep dive research if you like, kind of getting into the nitty gritty. That's what those people do.

Speaker 6:          12:42          Also Robert Fitts Patrick, he's an mlm experts, been working on it more than 15 years. Um, he let me interview him. He's been a great resource throughout this, so I thank him, uh, Christine Richards, Richard, uh, of Orion research. She also let me kind of talk to her for awhile. She's also an expert on mlms. So go check out her research and what she's done as well as she had a great interview on quotes, the Raven. And then finally Dr. John Taylor. He was one of the main sources that I cited here of, from the FTC government where he tracked how often people succeed in these type of like legal pyramid schemes. He is an incredible resource as well. And now I just want to, I just want to leave you with this little gym that I found, um, from our president. If you're in America, ladies and gentlemen, Americans need a new plan. The trump network wants to give millions of people renewed hope. Let's get out of this recession right now with cutting edge health and wellness formulas and a system where you can develop your own financial independence. The trump network offers people the opportunity to achieve their American dream. I'm still looking for dreams. I'm doing damn well in life, but I'm still looking for the dream.
