Speaker 1:          00:00          This video represents a hundred percent fact, and it's not at all an opinion. If you disagree with this video, this merely implies that you are misaligned with reality or miseducated on the facts. If the former, I suggested psychiatrist the latter, I suggest watching this video. Let's start this up. The piano is the greatest sytropin ever, and I'm going to give you five reasons why. Number one, most instruments like the voice, wind, and brass instruments can only play one note at a time. This means to even play simple pieces. These instruments require you to have several friends to play with. With piano, you can forego all of that in play, several notes at the same time, which is one of the main reasons. It's the most popular singles instrument. I mean, solo instrument number two, a lot of instruments take a ton of practice just to create a good sound like trumpet or Violin, which leads everyone with an earshot to hate you. Why you practice? Yeah, with just one press of the Canada, anyone can get a reasonable sound. Okay,

Speaker 1:          00:56          so even though the piano is incredibly tough to master, at least people won't hate you while you do it. Number three, the layout is intuitive. Now, I know this might sound confusing to some of you who look at the piano like I might look at Chinese menu, but trust me compared to some of these monstrosities, the piano is really easy to understand. All you really have to know is the pitch of these notes go up in ascending order, low to high. What's your brain expects is exactly how it's laid out. This is always higher than anything below it. Add to this the fact that the piano is a very visual instrument and this makes it the perfect learning tool. This is why if you seriously study any instrument, you will at some point be asked to pick up a little bit of piano on the side in order to help you understand music. Period. Number four, whether it be Chopin, Bach, or billy Joel, the overwhelming majority of great composers play piano. Number five, check this out,

Speaker 1:          01:57          These are becoming more common in some more realistic as technology gets better. So eventually you'll be able to play any instrument from the greatest instrument of all the piano check mate. But now that I'm done ripping on every other musician, let me just save this. I'll hope for you guys is not lost less pianists have one crucial, yeah,
