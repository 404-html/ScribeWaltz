Speaker 1:          00:00          Signing credit card receipts or one of those antiquated systems of record keeping that use to make more sense, but now through preservation of only the tradition and not the purpose has lost most of its meaning and desperately needs to be replaced. Kind of like that collection of vhs tapes you still have from the 90s even though you no longer have a vhs player to understand this, let's go back to the credit card receipt. Glory days. Actually we have to rewind a little bit before that and talk about credit. As a rule, people hate spending money but they love getting stuff. People will spend more if they don't have to spend now but can get stuff now and businesses love getting more money even if they have get it later. This is where the idea of a tab or credit comes from. At first lines of credit, we're limited in where they can be used.

Speaker 1:          00:40          Sometimes I borrow would give you a coin or token is proof of you being a loyal customer and lets you build a tab and their bar or a gas station would give you a paper card as credit to a few exclusive stores within the area and it built in. I didn't do protection existed because in most of these places everyone in the town knew everybody so they would know if the card wasn't held by the right person, but as they need for a more universal credit system came about, credit card issuers had to find some way of securing their cars to protect against fraud. After all, if you're from Ohio and someone uses your card in New York, how's the merchant to no, it isn't you. So this is where the signature on the back of your card comes in. Merchant has you sign your credit card receipt and is supposed to check it to signatures matched to prove it is really you.

Speaker 1:          01:16          Now, even when that system kind of made sense, it had all sorts of flaws in comparing signatures properly, takes too much time with the average clerk isn't a signature expert and because your signature is right on the back of the card, any industrious thief could just practice your signature for a day before actually going out on a spending spree. But this system makes even less sense now because when's the last time anyone actually compared your signatures like that? So why do we still have to sign? It all has to do with blame. If merchants don't have you signed and you decide that you wanted to speak to charge, the credit card company will make the merchant reimburse it. But if they did make you sign, they can say they used reasonable fraud prevention methods to verify that it was you. In that case, either you or the credit card company, it would have to pay.

Speaker 1:          01:57          But let's not get lost in business buzzwords here. It's important to note that what everyone considers to be reasonable fraud prevention is not reasonable at all because they never checked. If your signature matches anything. Let me give you an analogy. Imagine bars were tired of the time it takes to individually check everyone's Id that the government tells them they still need to check if everyone's 21 because the law says so. So in efforts of reasonable age identification, they ask everyone, are you 21 and if they say yes, they can drink, this system would help the barb prove that they were trying to stop underage drinking, but the actual results would be the equivalent of having no check it all. And that's my point. Your credit card signature is equivalent to no signature at all because it will never stop anyone from using your credit card. So what do we do about it? Well, the good news is technology is making fraud protection easier and better than ever. And Europe, they rolled out a chip and pin system, which requires a pin every time you try to buy something. This is at least as fast as signing a receipt and actually has some real security in it. But in America, although we've adopted the chip cards, we're still using our signature system. Why you ask one credit card company, explain the kiss.

Speaker 1:          03:06          If you can possibly ignore the dripping condescension in the statement. What it boils down to is that you're only going to get a credit card with actual security when you want it. And for that to happen, people everywhere need to realize that the story of the signature is a lie. It doesn't protect you and worse, it breeds a false sense of security in a system that needed to be replaced decades ago.
