Speaker 1:          00:02          Are you a sociopath? Have you been caught with your pants down figuratively or literally in some cases? Do you want to rejoin your moral community and wind back the respect of your peers, but don't want to admit that you're wrong. Well, you've come to the right place today. We're going to learn about the art of the non-apology. We're going to take you from this. I did not have sexual relations with that woman to this from this.

Speaker 2:          00:35          Hey everybody. It's me, Kathy Griffin. I'm just now seeing the reaction of these images. I made a mistake and I was wrong to this year. This month. That picture was released by the way you take the apology back

Speaker 1:          00:54          if you're lucky from this

Speaker 2:          00:56          and when you were starting to let you do it. I can do anything

Speaker 1:          01:02          to this.

Speaker 3:          01:02          What a great honor to be able to introduce for the first time ever anywhere. The 45th president of the United States of America, Donald J dot trump.

Speaker 4:          01:13          Grandmother.

Speaker 1:          01:21          Alright, let's do this number one. Don't apologize. Let's start with the bread and butter. Have you tried not apologizing? This is called the John Wayne Approach.

Speaker 3:          01:30          Oh No, so just out by the waterfall, but I'm sorry. It's never apologize, Mr. to sign of weakness.

Speaker 1:          01:35          This is often perceived by your supporters as being strong and powerful. You don't have to apologize. No matter what you do. This technique is endorsed by Donald Trump.

Speaker 3:          01:44          We are not going to apologize for America no more apologies,

Speaker 1:          01:49          and before you say there goes crazy, trump changing American politics to be insensitive. Just remember, this has been an American stands for pretty much forever. I'll never apologize for the United States of America ever. I don't care what the facts are, no matter what the facts are. This is America number two account. Don't apologize. Okay, so if not, apologizing isn't an option. You've really stepped in the Doodoo. Try Accounting. This is when you don't apologize. You explained the context of when you messed up and that supposedly justifies the action. If they hadn't bought the liquor, you wouldn't have been drinking, and if you hadn't been drinking, you wouldn't have sent those embarrassing photos of yourself. Roseanne put on a clinic of accounting a few weeks ago when she said, oh no, I didn't mean to tweet something. People interpreted as racist. I was on Ambien, which made me sleep.

Speaker 1:          02:39          Tweet. Rosanne has her CPA in accounting. Great stuff. Roseanne sets the bar. Number three, apologize but don't change. Now, this next one is a long con. You're going to say that you're sorry, but then commit a string of activities that show that you really haven't changed. This next example is a little long. I of course am talking of Anthony's wieners apology. This is him in 2011. When the scandal first breaks last Friday night, I tweeted a photograph of myself that I intended to send us a direct message as part of a joke to a woman in Seattle. So today I'm announcing my resignation from Congress and two years later he tries to repair his image. Look, I made some big mistakes and I know I let a lot of people down, but I've also learned some tough lessons breaking news.

Speaker 5:          03:30          I'm responsible for this behavior that led us to be in this place. I want you again say sorry to anyone who has received receiving end of these messages.

Speaker 1:          03:39          This is a pretty risky maneuver. A can backfire pretty hard, so please be careful with this one. Number four clarified. Don't apologize. Another tactic is to say that your accuser misunderstood or misinterpreted you. You really meant something else. For this example, take a look at Megan Kelly, confronting Donald trump about his own record. History of misogyny. I don't want to sound too much like a chauvinist, but you wouldn't have your job if you weren't beautiful. It's very sad. I'd look at right in that fat, ugly face. She's gotten a little bit larger.

Speaker 6:          04:07          Person who's flat chested is very hard to be a 10. She ate like a pig,

Speaker 1:          04:11          but what does he do? Does he sit there and take it? Does he apologize? No, he clarifies it. He says, I wasn't talking about women. I was talking about Rosie O'donnell.

Speaker 7:          04:21          You've called women. You don't like fat pigs, dogs, slobs, and disgusting animals. Your twitter account,

Speaker 1:          04:30          only rosie o'donnell.

Speaker 1:          04:39          This can be extremely effective. Onto the next example. Number five, issue a statement but never actually say, sorry. So let's say you're Hillary Clinton, someone running under the banner of women's rights and you find yourself in trouble for not firing in 2008 campaign advisor who is accused of sexual harassment. Well, what is she going to do? Watch this play by play. She issues a series of tweets where she explains herself, but notice she never uses apologize or sorry, anywhere in here. Now you amateurs out there pay special attention to this next part. See we call this. The Washington doubled down. She gets caught out for that and then she goes on to explain herself further in a really long facebook apologies, but still doesn't use words like apologizer. Sorry. So it looks like she's apologizing, but she really isn't. Now before we move onto our last type of non-apology in this video, let's take a second to analyze why someone might use not apologies.

Speaker 1:          05:35          Non-Apology is used for two reasons. First, apologizing is all about not making excuses, taking blame and putting yourself in the hands of the offended. This is difficult if you're in a position of power, it can make you feel weak. It can cause legal issues because apologizing means you're admitting guilt and some people simply don't like admitting when they're wrong. The second reason is maybe in your. You haven't committed a large enough offense to warrant an apology. For this reason, you might issue a halfhearted. Sorry. Different people have different thresholds for what deserves an apology. Either way, it's worth knowing that if you do decide to go the route of the non-apology, they often come off as unsatisfying at best and unfeeling. At worst. As you may have noticed in this video, humans have a natural instinct for sensing if an apology is sincere and if the apologizers just trying to weasel their way out of the offense.

Speaker 1:          06:24          If you doubt this, think of how unsatisfying these phrases are. I'm sorry you got offended, or if I hurt anybody, then I apologize. Still not. Apologies do have their place. Sometimes they have social utility and sometimes they're all you can do as Edwin [inaudible] Astella points out in his book. Sorry about that. The language of public apology. To illustrate this, he brings up a historical example. When in 1968 during the Vietnam war, North Korean forces captured the USS Pueblo, a ship gathering Intel on the North Koreans, North Korea claimed the Pueblo had crossed the territory lines, making them fair game for capture while the US insisted it hadn't. The crew was tortured and forced to sign confessions, and North Korea threatened that if the US didn't give a written apology for straying into their territory that killed the crew. After being stalled and diplomacy for almost a year, Gilbert Woodward, the Army Major General at the time, signed an agreement that the US was at fault.

Speaker 1:          07:19          While simultaneously releasing this remark, my signature will not and cannot alter the facts. I will sign the document to free the crew and only to free the crew. This non apology that was signed by Woodward is a perfect example of how insincere apology is can sometimes be the only answer. The next day the Pueblos crew was released safely, but now that we've talked about why someone might use a non-apology, how they come off as insincere and the rare cases where they're needed. Let's move onto our final example. Number six. I'm sorry, but apologies. Let's say you're Caitlyn Jenner. You just ran a 69 year old from behind with your car, so you're being held accountable for murder. How do you get out of it? This one we're going to play along at home a say you're sorry. Be Blaming on the Paparazzi. See settled the lawsuit with your enormous wealth and don't face jail time or d, all of the above. Yes, that's right. To all of you who gets d, You are correct. You do it all when you can't totally dodged the apology. You can say you're sorry, but that it wasn't all your fault. This is what Caitlyn does. She says she's sorry, but the Paparazzi were the ones distracting her and they should also be held responsible. She has it all figured out and for the record she never face jail time. Totally got away with manslaughter.

Speaker 4:          08:41          He just said manslaughter. No, a lot

Speaker 1:          08:56          of my recent remarks you've got up here before you to say to. I'm deeply

Speaker 4:          09:01          Lisa,

Speaker 1:          09:13          I think fortunate video. First of all, music Mecca, 83. You've seen them on here before. Incredible guy. Go check him out. We've got a new artist named Ebraheem.

I also want to discuss with you guys Patrion I've realized after doing this channel for a little while, that that's gonna have to be the main income source for this channel. Um, I just don't release videos fast enough. I prefer quality. I prefer spending my time on videos, so that's going to be, have to be the direction of the channel. So you will see more pitches for that. I apologize if you're annoyed by that, but the patrons had that have been supporting me.

Speaker 1:          10:00          Those guys are the kind of the lifeblood of this channel. So I'm pushing more towards that. Along those lines. I want to change up kind of what we do with that. So as you know, we have two tiers. Some of you know we have the proletariat and the bourgeoisie. Proletarian is $1 a month, virtually cs $5 a month. In the past. I haven't done anything with it. I want to change that. I'm not exactly sure how I'm going to, but for now I want to try this. If you are currently supporting me or you are considering supporting me, go to Patrion. I'm going to create a thread and I'm asking for input on what you'd like to see. Would you like to see perks? Would you like to see more recognition? Would you like to see nothing at all?

Maybe something people got mad at me for, so look forward to that. Thank you for watching.
