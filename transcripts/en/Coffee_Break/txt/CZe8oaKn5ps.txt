Speaker 1:          00:00          Viewer discretion is advised. In part one we learned what the hfs in principle is and how social taboos affect the profanity of a society. Now I want to dive into American taboos and explore how are taboos have changed over time and how profanity has followed. Because profanity has drastically changed with slurs and words about group identity quickly becoming the worst kinds of profanity of this generation. And we're going to trace this change and profanity through the lives of Comedians, people who challenged taboos for a living.

Speaker 1:          00:39          And our story begins in 1961 when lenny bruce is arrested for saying cock sucker on stage. Now that name may fly over some modern heads, but at the time Lenny Bruce was the biggest thing in comedy in rolling Stone's best standups of all time. Bruce is number three on that list and if comedy loves being on the edge, then lenny was the guy dancing off cliffs. His comedy took on every American sacred cow from race to sexual puritanism and he would say anything, even if it got him arrested and his whole life was full of legal issues. He was in and out of court houses for saying the wrong words, appealing and just dealing with a cold legal system and obscenity laws. All the while he was whittling away eventually dying in his home in 1966 four years before New York's Highest Appellate Court would vindicate him of all charges.

Speaker 1:          01:24          One of his prosecutors later said, we all knew what we were doing. We use the law to kill him. And this is a pivotal moment because even though America is prosecuting comics for breaking taboos, there was also a shift taking place in young people right around the 60s and seventies America has the sexual revolution and the civil rights movement that totally shake up the value system of America and change the taboos. So 10 years after bruce gets arrested, another comedian, George Carlin is coming up, similar style, similar anti authoritarian and a similar fascination with bad words and pushing the edge. But this time the culture has changed, so when Carlin performed seven words, you can't say on television, which is loaded with the worst profanity of the day, it's a huge success.

Speaker 2:          02:07          You know what I mean? It's just like we've decided there'd be somewhere as we won't say all the time and I was just trying to find out which words they were for sure. All of them I wanted to list and I wanted to know the ones that she could never say on television. I mean the filthy words that are always filthy and all I could think of was shit, Piss, fuck cock cock sucker motherfucker.

Speaker 1:          02:27          He was just as provocative as lenny bruce was except time had gone by and the taboos of the older generation were weakened. The difference between Carlin and Bruce was when they did the act. Carlin mentions this idea in an interview.

Speaker 2:          02:40          Lenny and I had this language in common and he brought, he was the first one to make language an issue and he suffered for it. I was the first one to make a language issue and to succeed from it.

Speaker 1:          02:51          Lesson from George Carlin is obvious in profanity and in comedy. Timing is everything. But this cultural shift that Carlin built a career on didn't stop there. Hfs words have continued to weaken and as good as Carlin's bit was almost 50 years later, his list of dirty words you can't say on television needs an update because on tv and especially on the Internet, you can say any of those words that you want. Now don't be turned this back around when we stopped being a con, that was bob. Bob had bits, tips give, give him me to fucking creeps. You know that Dexter Lt, this is a waste about damn time. You pissed me off. San Francisco Cox, I can. This is called cop took up shit on shit.

Speaker 3:          03:33          Shit. Shit. Judge, judge, judge, judge, judge, judge, judge, judge, judge, judge, judge.

Speaker 1:          03:37          So to recap what Lenny Bruce got arrested for is what Carlin got celebrated for and now you can win Carlin's bad word Bingo. Just flipping through a few channels. These words are hardly taboo or forbidden at all anymore. In fact, a study came out that just over five years across all TV networks, the usage of traditional profanity went up 69% and over 50 years, authors were 28 times more likely to include traditional swearing in the books they wrote. So there's clear empirical evidence that hfs words have been normalized. Not that they're completely harmless, but they've been robbed of most of their bike. Hfs words in America are something like the queen of England. There's still the face of profanity, but there's not much power behind them. But while hfs words were being declawed, a special class of words became even more toxic and unsayable then before slurs, the inwards hate speech, microaggressions, anything targeting identity, these became the new sacred cow to replace the old.

Speaker 1:          04:33          You won't get fired for saying fucking the office, but you might get fired for saying the other f word. Now it's worth taking a moment to say that slurs are different from other types of profanity. After all, they specially target groups, unlike other bad words, acids, universal, because everyone has one, but not everyone is a homosexual. So words like Faggot seem much more targeted, so perhaps slurs do deserve a special place in our language. That said, there's something about this profanity that I don't like. Often we judge the word by itself condemning syllables regardless of situation. Chris Rock noted this in an interview saying why he stopped performing at colleges, because quote, they're way too conservative, not in their political views, but in their social views and in their willingness not to offend anybody. You can't even be offensive on your way to being inoffensive. In other words, even if you have something wholesome to say, you better not use the no, no language on your way to making that point. He goes on to mention someone else who also hated the new profanity. I remember talking to George Carlin before he died and him saying the exact same thing. In fact, he has a bit about it.

Speaker 4:          05:36          Visit different group to get pissed off at you in this country for everything you're not suppose to say. Can't say fruit. Can't say faggot. Can't say queer. Can't say Nancy boy. Can't say pansy. Can't say nigger. Boogie Jake Jigaboo skinhead jungle bunny. Morely more than Yana Schweitzer. There is absolutely nothing wrong with any of those words in and of themselves.

Speaker 1:          05:58          It's the intention behind the words that makes them good or bad. I get tired of people talking about bad words and bad language bullshit. It's the context that makes them good or bad, but despite that eloquent argument for the total liberation of words, I can't help but think that Carlin lost his war for total free speech, even if he won his battle for liberating a type of profanity because profanity is a human universal, deeply rooted in societal taboos and though these taboos can shift with time, they never disappear entirely, so the profanity won't either. It will only change. This has been the story in America in the last 50 years. We have shifted from primarily in hfs culture to primarily and in cultural swearing. For me, this suggests that we don't get less sensitive as much as we change what we're sensitive about and this is ultimately brought forward. A few questions in my mind. What balance of free speech and sensitivity towards social issues do we want given that taboos change over time? How can we recognize that word's harm? People without capitulating towards an ideology that condemns words outside of their context. And finally, is it inevitable that our kids will simultaneously think we were being prudes and bigots?

Speaker 1:          07:10          Only time will tell, Aye. Aye. Aye. I wish I had the worst. So express this and that's been his thing. And then my chest and stomach is flatter him. When I hear your name, all those vibrations to hedge rums, I'm making some soup and I love the cute things that we do watching me write my lyrics and you critique them. And so that's something you never have to put your energy into. Your said what an answer is something that Jay, thank you for watching that video. Number one.
