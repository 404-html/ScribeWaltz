Speaker 1:          00:01          Wall Street is Las Vegas for smart people. It's where you take your money if you want to have the odds on your side and like Las Vegas, it's full of people who think they have the winning system to get even further ahead. Hedge funds, value investors, your uncle who assured that they connect is the next big thing and especially Jim Kramer, they're all trying to outsmart everyone else and this makes sense. The legend and mystique around Wall Street is that if you're clever enough you can be like mitis ensuring everything you touch will become gold and there's a clip from the movie limitless that perfectly encapsulates this allure of Wall Street. Super Intelligent guy gets on Wall Street and from nothing makes millions because he just sees things. The others don't. He outsmarts them. My new friend Kevin Dileo showed me how you could leverage two and a half times your cash at the day training.

Speaker 1:          00:49          Why are you buying that? The CEO was just indicted but not for the big fat defense contract. He bribed his way into that. Still on. It should be announced next week. At the end of the week, my brokerage account contained over $2 million. Now, of course you have to take out the exaggerated Hollywood elements, but for many people, this is the sexy side of Wall Street. Bring me your poor masses and if you're smart will make you rich. And many people believe that story and chase, it's promise. But there was an idea that challenge that narrative that radically suggested that it may be impossible to improve your odds beyond the average. Even brilliant money managers, hedge funds, and the best investors may be no better than monkeys at picking stocks. Number one rule of Wall Street. Nobody, okay if you're Warren Buffet, if you cheer me, but nobody knows if a stock is going to go up, down, sideways, or in fucking circles, at least of all stock brokers.

Speaker 1:          01:47          But before we get to monkeys, let's first talk about the big question, the question. Some of the greatest minds in the world have spent their lives trying to answer the one that would make you rich. What will the price of a stock b tomorrow? And the answers to this question are as numerous as you might expect for an alchemy recipe. There is fundamental analysis, technical analysis, buying hold, value, invest in growth investing. I could go on pretty much forever. And the point is at this time it was thought that if you had money, you needed to find a genius on Wall Street to invest that money for you. Someone who through some secret strategy, manage your wealth in exchange for a fee. The idea was that their expertise would get you returns in your money that would more than pay for their secret formula, and this is how you made the big bucks if you're on Wall Street managing people's money and charging a fee for it.

Speaker 2:          02:39          Okay?

Speaker 1:          02:41          And amidst these competing views of the stock market and wealthy wealth managers, along comes an American economist, Burton Malkiel, who looks at the market and essentially throws a monkey wrench at the traditional theories in his book, a random walk down Wall Street. He says, no, you're all wrong. The stock market can't be consistently predicted by any theory. The only predictable thing we have about the market is it. The whole thing tends to increase over time. No one is able to consistently pick winners over anyone else and boldest of all, he predicted a blindfolded monkey throwing darts at newspaper's financial pages could select a portfolio that would do just as well as one carefully selected by experts. If this is true Malka, it goes on to say, instead of paying big bucks to Wall Street to let experts manage your wealth, the best thing to do is to find a minimum fee fund that buys up hundreds of stocks without discrimination for winners and losers and just holds them passively because the future of a stock is fundamentally unknowable anyways, because if your average return is the same for both strategies, expert management and monkey management, why would anyone pay for the experts into the index fund of the early seventies exactly the kind of low fi fund that now kale proposes.

Speaker 1:          03:53          You buy it, pay a tiny maintenance fee, and it just buys and holds hundreds of stocks. Now, if you're one of those expert investors and index funds seems both silly and insulting. Random stocks, no technical analysis, no psychological analysis, no chart analysis. This was a challenge to the very ethos of Wall Street, a challenge to the idea of the midas investor and over the next decades, the battle between expert funds and monkey funds raged on and after almost 50 years of data, the results are in and it's overwhelming. You can find hundreds of studies on this because this is one of the most surprising and over analyze things and finance. But here are the headlines. Over the last 15 years, index funds outperformed 90% of actively managed funds when you account for their fees. Let me repeat that. 90% not 50% 90% of the smartest people on Wall Street made less money than monkeys and the 10% well, given the averages, it starts looking a lot like luck rather than skill. After all given enough investors, it's self evident that someone will gain above average returns just by sheer luck. And we also have a study that even the funds that do beat the index fund one three, five years struggled to continue that positive performance and the number that do continue that positive performance year over year is about the number that we'd expect from blind chance. Just because you won 15 coin flips in a row doesn't mean you're any more likely to win the next one.

Speaker 1:          05:23          Let's talk about why the future of the stock market can't be predicted. This is a long theorized idea called the efficient market hypothesis and even for the people who don't subscribe to that idea, there's another confounding problem at work here. It's a game theory problem. It's a situation where there are so many rational actors in the system that the market cannot be reasonably predicted because each time someone gets a winning method of valuing stocks, the next person will find a way to incorporate that strategy into a new strategy to be the first strategy. In other words, everyone's strategy must take into account other investing strategies into their formula for how the market will swing, but it's self referential because the other rational actors will feasibly be trying to incorporate your strategy into their investing strategy. And this is kind of where it all breaks down.

Speaker 1:          06:10          It's an ever evolving game that you'll never win it long enough to beat the market average. So while occasionally there are exploits in the market, they rarely lasts for long and they almost always found by different people. Even Warren Buffett who is on the very short list of people you might argue has consistently beating the stock market when asked what to invest in, doesn't bother naming his own company or any other. Instead he has a simple answer that would make Malka smile. He recommends you go get some index funds. It turns out that predicting winners and losers is impractical over long periods of time. There's no such thing as a consistently winning strategy over the long haul. It's much more like gambling where the house odds are on your side, you're going to win some and you're going to lose them. And you can't predict which, but if you stay around long enough, you'll win more than you lose. Really the only thing you shouldn't do is pay someone to come up with fancy models and strategies for something that ultimately comes to chance. Just go and get some money. Peace.

Speaker 1:          07:18          Hey, thanks for watching the video. This is a huge topic. So there are things that I didn't get to. Uh, automatic tax loss harvesting robot investors, which have brought down the cost of active management significantly. Smart Beta etfs, which Malka El himself is a fan of tons of stuff that was a little bit outside the scope of this video for time's sake, but I left links below. So if you're interested in sinking your teeth a little more into this topic, you can do soca. So go check that out. Also we're going to be having a discussion on the reddits, so if you want to talk about this a little more in detail and interact with me, uh, go there, artists to the music as always are linked and I will see you guys next time we got, we've got a fun one coming up next time, so keep your eye out for that. Should be about a week or two out in other news. Got a little bit of an announcement to make. Pretty excited about that. Uh, I'll link some pictures or something.
