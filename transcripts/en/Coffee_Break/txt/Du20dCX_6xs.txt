Speaker 1:          00:00          Let me tell you a secret. Wars are being fought for your attention and today we're going to be looking at the new war that's been going on as well as looking back to see what we can learn from past wars. The new battlefield is on youtube and it involves one really annoying tactic.

Speaker 2:          00:16          Morning Guys, how's her? When do I pick the kids?

Speaker 3:          00:23          [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          00:33          welcome to the excitement. Wars were fake excitement and hype draws in more viewers and gets people to watch longer. If you want to be a part of this, you have to get excited, like really excited. In fact, if they think you're going to have a seizure or a heart attack, pets about the right level, but even though that will keep views, I don't think fake excitement is a good thing. It eventually makes excitement and hype on Youtube meaningless because everyone is overusing it, but I'm not going to hate on any individual. They're just playing the system exploiting a weakness in our attention. I just wanted to talk about the potential effects and what we can do about it because believe it or not, we've already seen this warp play out before, twice. Both of them bear a striking resemblance to the excitement of wars and I think we can examine them to learn lessons about our own wars today.

Speaker 1:          01:14          Have you ever heard of the loudness wars? It started in the 1940s when sound engineers began to realize that louder music stands out on Juke boxes, so they began telling the record labels to record louder so people started overusing compressors to artificially raise the volume of their whole song to be as loud as possible. And the reason raising the volume artificially matters is because it destroys something called dynamic range. Basically. That's the difference between the quietest and loudest part of a song and it's hugely responsible for conveying emotion and tone. The problem with the loudness wars is, as Matt may feel, puts it when there's no quiet, there can be no loud. The first few seconds of Beethoven's fifth symphony illustrates this really well. Pay Close attention to the volume and how it affects the tone of the piece.

Speaker 1:          02:11          The reason you can really feel those loud moments is because of the quiet ones right before it, and we can see these peaks and valleys of intensity in the visual way form of a song. Here's the song. Before that loudness wars really escalated and here's a way form during the loudness wars, simultaneously as the loudness wars were going on, there was a similar war going on in the media, a wharf sensationalism with Fox News being one of the first 24 hour news networks founded in 1996 people soon became aware that sensationalist, even partisan show's got a lot more views than moderate even handed ones. Because of this, several similar news programs were created on the other side of the aisle. Both sides vying for the attention of the television viewer. This escalation in sensationalism resulted in news clips like this.

Speaker 2:          02:51          This does this offend you, this word. A lot of people are shocked. A massive gas line. Rutgers, could it happen in your neighborhood?

Speaker 4:          03:00          Marijuana, could it be in your neighborhood and is America ready? Is the u s next is America dangerously under four pair. The flip flop is the new sneaker, but behind the Sandal nursing, serious danger, not only lack of sleep, it can kill you it sleeping too much

Speaker 1:          03:15          and no one critique the dangers of this hyper sensationalism better than John Stewart.

Speaker 5:          03:20          If we amplify everything we hear nothing.

Speaker 3:          03:26          Okay,

Speaker 1:          03:29          sounds a little bit like matt may film. He echoes this thought later in an interview.

Speaker 5:          03:34          Now the problem is how do you keep people watching it? Oh, Jay's not going to kill someone every day, so that's gone. So what do you have to do? You have to elevate the passion of everything else that happens that might even be somewhat mundane and elevate it to the extent that this is breaking news. The aggregate effect of that is that you begin to lose the lexicon. You begin to lose any meaning of what breaking news means or urgent or look at this or dangerous. You know, this is a an arms race. The language then has to become sharper, louder to cut through more and more of the noise. And when I'm saying is maybe there is a way to not engage in the idea, not to accept the premise

Speaker 1:          04:22          Jon Stewart's mind. The news had become an arms race to become more sensationalist, fantastic from the rest, but it resulted in a loss of fidelity of what is important, just like the loudness wars, but sensationalists wars were obliterating the crescendos of real life news by amplifying everything into meaninglessness. And now we come back to the excitement wars. All of these guys are emotional actors playing to what they know that we want, but just like in media and news, it's getting to the point where we can no longer distinguish what is actually fun and exciting because people play everything up as if it were so exciting. But maybe we don't have to accept the premise. Here's something to remember. These wars eventually get played out. People get sick of the escalation and insanity of it. And we can see these effects happening in the loudness wars where we've seen a reduction in over compression since 2005 we've also seen a similar reaction into sensationalist wars with the rise in popularity of websites like politifact fact check and all sides that seek to lessen the sensationalism in politics and seek unbiased. We will never be rid of people trying to exploit our biases, whether it be towards volume sensationalism or excitement. But thankfully we can vote with our views to not pay attention to those people. These wars are going to keep going, but we don't have to be a part of it.

Speaker 3:          05:33          No.
