Speaker 1:          00:00          Axes approach to marketing has been one of the most unique and brilliant campaigns in history, but their marketing genius has been traded by what appears to just be a cheap tactic, advertising sex. But what made it successful was not what they were advertising. Instead, he was who they were advertising to and how they did it. By ignoring all social roles of delicacy, love them or hate them, acts as a beautifully consistent brand. Their marketing style matches their product perfectly, just like their cheap, almost overpoweringly fragrant body spray that punches you in the mouth within stench acts as marketed to the male ego with one singular thought. Men especially pubescent boys don't understand subtlety. In fact, it may never be possible to be clear enough. And so while other Cologne brands, we're timidly dancing around the notion that mindware fragrances to give women acts decided skip the foreplay and go for the Jaguar.

Speaker 1:          00:49          Their brand won't make you slightly less smelly, slightly more classy, or make you fall in love. Their brand will get you laid and not just by one woman, but as many women as you want and no six pack required. You can be the biggest loser in school, but the second you spray on axe body spray, you become a chick magnet. So powerful it would make James Bond jealous all for the low low price of four 99 but before they launched in America in 2002 as a bottle of sex pheromone x had to figure out who they stood for. After all, if you try to appeal to everyone, you appeal to no one. So an efforts of figuring out the perfect audience for their over the top marketing campaign. They decided to do a study. Acts took nearly a hundred men out to bars and watch them try to pick up girls trying to classify different kinds of potential acts consumers, they eventually realized that their target audience would not be the already confident mail.

Speaker 1:          01:36          They didn't need help getting them. They would sell to the awkward acne faced average Joe who didn't have a chance, but the kind of guy who blushes at the mere thought of approaching his crush, the technical term for their audience was the insecure novice. And you can see this play out in their ads. Up until now. Brands like old spice and colognes had always cast male models to get the female model but not acts. They decided that with their body spray, the Dorky male would get the female model. They cast it. Anybody except the stereotypical hump. It was the kid with glasses, the average guy who's on an unlucky streak. But as for the female lead, they applied, their enough is never enough role and Swan dove into the deep end of the nerds fantasy life. They consistently cast the perfect 10 Amazonia Bikini clad female lead doesn't care that acts hasn't transformed you into a hunk. You don't need to be a hunt when you can smell like a $5 candy backs. And this has worked beautifully for a long time. And even right now, access had the lion's share at the male fragrance industry with the only real casualty being high school hallways everywhere. But the way they did it wasn't just selling sex acts reinvented how to sell sex and who to sell it to.
