Speaker 1:          00:18          where do bad words come from and what are the similarities, if any, across languages and cultures in swearing? What causes some words to be worse than others? These questions have fascinated linguists for centuries and today we're going to look at some of the answers. When you look across the world, profanity is almost a universal feature of language. We have created thousands of different profane words, but despite some moderate variation between languages, the types of words we classify as unsayable in public share. A lot of overlap and this is because we all create bad words around social taboos. Taboos are things in a society that are considered to private, gross, ugly or sacred. Their topics so delicate that they can only be allowed in certain places. Bodily functions, for example, have taboos that are confined to the bathroom. Sex has taboos that are confined to the bedroom, uncomfortable past events contained taboos that are confined to history, class and religious rituals have taboos that are confined to the temple or church and these taboos.

Speaker 1:          01:17          Sometimes though not always will lead to certain words describing them becoming themselves off limits due to the association with the taboo itself. In other words, not only do we have a contextual allowance for sensitive parts of our lives, we do the same with the words describing them. For example, you can say poop or but just fine, but if you talk about shit or an ass, well now you've crossed the line even though they are words for the same thing. One has been deemed culturally appropriate and the other has not. Now, some cultures create different taboos and others, but looking across the world, we generally find the same big four taboos, creating most of the bad language, the four horsemen of profanity, sex, bodily function, religion and slurs and this pattern of fairly common taboos, breeding similar bad words because Benjamin k Bergen in his book, what the F to come up with a categorization method for profanity that he calls the holy fucking Shit nigger principle.

Speaker 1:          02:12          Yeah, that's actually what he calls it. Here's the idea. Benjamin Bergen says that nearly all so called bad or forbidden words fall into one or more of the following types of profanity. Holy meaning religious or sacred Glass Homie, fucking meaning relating to sex shit relating to bodily functions. And finally nigger relating to slurs towards groups. Any nasty pejorative to describe groups of people fall here. Now of course some bad words like slut might fall into multiple categories. It's both a slur about a group and also a word about sex. So bear in mind that bad words can fall into multiple camps. As a quick note from here out, as we discuss this principal, I'll be referring to it as the h f s in principle. This is because one, it's a mouthful and two, it's safe way to start the conversation without requiring a disclaimer at the beginning of your discussion.

Speaker 1:          03:03          So now that we have that out of the way, besides being disconcertingly memorable, why did Benjamin Bergen find the hfs in principles so useful? The answer is because it does a great job to categorize most swearing and profanity by the human taboo. They draw power from, and this is valuable because while all our words differ, the things we described are the same. So it's reasonable to suggest that studying the roots of profanity will reveal something about the profanity itself. And the first thing you find is that taboos are definitely tendencies and culture, but you also find that they are not guaranteed to take ruth and the taboos that had culture does. Carrie tells you something about their history. For example, some languages like Cantonese, Chinese that come from more secular cultures, perhaps unsurprisingly don't possess Coley profanity in their lexicon. They do, however, have some swear words about their ancestors due to their history of ancestor reverence.

Speaker 1:          03:55          But that's not all. When we look at the top five words that are considered most defensive in Chinese known as the outstanding five, all of them have to do with sex. So we can safely say that Chinese is not a holy language, instead primarily a fucking language, but other languages like Quebecois French can be considered holy languages because of their deep Catholic roots. They're profane. Dictionary has what are called Saccos, literally meaning consecrations, which are Catholic liturgical terms like sacrament that when uttered in the right context are seen as some of their strongest swear words. Deb Neck for example, is stronger than their word for fuck or shit. So we can say that, wow, Quebecois French has F and s words. It's more of a holy language than anything else. Moving on. You can also add English to the list of holy languages coming from a Judeo Christian religious tradition where it's like damn or hell.

Speaker 1:          04:45          Obviously our references to religious ideas and English is an interesting swearing language in general in that we are an h f s and in language. And a good example of the second lesson we learned from the hfs in principle within the same culture, the relative strength of taboos usually correlates to the relative strength of the profanity. So in America for example, both sex and the scatological are considered taboo, but of the two of them sexist, more taboo hints, fuck and is related. Cousins are considered more offensive than shit or ass and all of the taboo strengths very heavily by culture. In German, for example, this situation is totally reversed. German is primarily a shit language. The German word for fuck Israeli used in swearing instead, some variant of shit or ass is used constantly such as the German word for asshole phase, born from an ass shit head.

Speaker 1:          05:35          You get the idea. Now last but not least, are there similar languages? Well, up until recently, those slurs have been common across many cultures. A general taboo around slurs hasn't been present. What I mean by this is those slurs were used for nefarious purposes and to promote tribalism and ingroup behavior. They were not considered taboo by the culture itself, but in the last century, there's a very good argument to make that in America at least slurs have quickly become the most universally powerful taboo we have, and a good question might be why. Why did we shift and why are some slurs seen as worse than others? Let me suggest one possible explanation. The civil rights movement in America did more than change laws. They highlighted a history of disenfranchisement amongst certain groups, which none of us really want to think or talk about. In other words, this unseemly part of American history became taboo. And what happens when we have a powerful cultural taboo? Well, the words that called back to that uncomfortable history in an inappropriate way become forbidden. And once you see that slurs became powerful when connected with their historical context, it's easy to see why in America the inward is way, way, way more offensive to most people. Then even words like fuck. Whereas if you visit a culture without the history of slavery, they wouldn't find that word is offensive because the word isn't linked to the history.

Speaker 3:          06:57          What's up my Nigga? What did you just say? What's up my Nigga?

Speaker 1:          07:11          Okay, so now that we've talked about the age, the FDS and the n in hfs in principle, now let's spend some time talking about a few exceptions to these roles that we find scattered across cultures. Interesting. Cultural variance include profane language about animals. In Korea, for example, calling someone a dog is deeply offensive. There's also profanity around disease. In Dutch, Profane language includes words for cancer, typhoid, tuberculosis. Often the severity of the disease emphasizes the strength of the profanity. And a final interesting taboo that pops up sometimes is a taboo around death and death related words. For example, in some Australian aboriginal cultures you can't say the name of someone who has died for up to a year or in more extreme instances like with the [inaudible] tribe of Columbia. This same rule is enforced under the penalty of death. However, even though are local taboos which buck the trend, most of the time when you find stable profane language it tends to follow the h f s and if you can look past the offensive charged words we can't say and instead examine the taboos themselves, we learn what is actually going on. It isn't the words themselves, it's the parts of our life that they're connected to the parts that our society is uncomfortable with. Yeah.

Speaker 4:          08:25          Yup.
