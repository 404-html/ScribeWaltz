Speaker 1:          00:03          Let me break it down. Jay High School, they don't come through their door and be good cop. Bad Cop. Don't fall for that. All right.

Speaker 2:          00:14          In Hollywood, everything important in an interrogation is seen or heard. The cops grimace allowed yelling, treating a suspect hostile. The light that's way too bright, but in a real interrogation, it's flipped around. Everything important is unseen, unheard on the surface. Real interrogations look boring. The cop is nice to you. They give you a drink, they dressed in plain clothes. It's almost disarming, especially if this is more of what you were expecting,

Speaker 2:          00:43          but that's the point. Under the boring disarming surface of an interrogation, you find a whole host of psychological traps and mental tricks that are designed to make you confess. It starts from the moment you walk in. Every inch of an interrogation room has been designed to make you feel isolated and powerless. The room is small, cramped. The walls are blank and there are no windows. You'll be placed in an uncomfortable straight back off in metal chair while the cops chair, we'll be able to roll. This becomes important later on. The next move is a hurdle that cops have to get over. When you go to jail, a cop is legally required to tell you you have the right to shut up. This actually turns out to be the only great advice you're going to get. Talking to cops is always a bad move and for the cop, what this means is that their first priority is making you ignore this advice and go against everything you've ever heard. They have to convince you to play the game with them. The first questions are deliberately not about the investigation. They want to appear trustworthy so that you'll talk to them about the case.

Speaker 1:          01:41          41 point mama stay downtown. I don't think I've tried that one yet. I'm a big coffee. I don't know if you're a coffee guy right in front of us, so no, I appreciate that. All right, go ahead. There's a plane going up. You get hungry or anything else, just let me know. Okay. How come you get more than one bill name? You know, my uncles and my grandfather, I got to three middle name and that's really because my parents thought I was gonna be an only child. Amy, after everybody. So I get named after your grandfather and two uncles, so I know what you're, I know what you're going through there. Cause my initials, I get teased about.

Speaker 2:          02:17          The other goal behind these innocent questions is to establish a behavioral baseline. They want to see how you act when you're telling the truth. Finally, when they're ready, they'll ask you something like this.

Speaker 3:          02:27          Well let's, let's do this. You sound like you will. You won't talk to me. Okay? I want to hear what you have to say. But before Ashley Quish, she got to know your rights. Okay? You have the right to remain silent. Uh, what this says here is that I've read you your rights. Do you understand them?

Speaker 2:          02:49          Once you're talking, they'll first get a statement about what happened after hearing it. If the cop thinks you might have done it. If the facts aren't lining up or if you're acting shady, they may move to the accusation phase and the accusation phase. They will confidently accuse you of the crime and the cop will say, in no uncertain terms, you did it. We know you did it and we've got evidence for it.

Speaker 1:          03:09          Your vehicle drove up the side of Jessica Lewis House, your boots walked to the back of Jessica Lloyd's House on the evening of the 28th and 29th of January. You and I both know you were at Jessica Lloyd toughs and I need to know why,

Speaker 2:          03:30          but here's the catch. They'll claim they have evidence for your guilt even when they don't.

Speaker 1:          03:36          This nosy neighbor or whatever we're going to call on him has monitored and I'm not going to tell you how. Okay, just think about it. With today's technology monitored, what was going on in front of this residence that they were calling to complain about until police arrive and I can prove it. I can go in front of the judge and say, hey look bro, we want to fucking do you want us to play this video? You want us to show you the fingerprint results? You want us to show you the gre test on on this gentleman, I did not have a firearm in mine hand.

Speaker 2:          04:08          The goal here is to make you think that you're already caught. They already have you. Why bother resisting and lying about it when they already know you did it? Just confess.

Speaker 1:          04:17          So it's, it's, it's a it. It's one of the easiest investigations I've had. It's fucking there and you can't lie about that, bro. You can't tell us how you then fucking fire that fourth shot anymore. You can't tell us. We can prove otherwise

Speaker 2:          04:31          during this phase of the interrogation, the interrogator doesn't want you to deny the crime even though you'll want to vocalize denials, reinforces your position. So Cox make an interesting move. They try to not let you vocalize Denalis in the first place. If possible, they'll often interrupt you or not. Stop talking to allow brakes to let you speak up. Instead, they'll keep the pressure on by reinforcing the idea that they a hundred percent already have you caught.

Speaker 1:          04:55          I'm giving you an opportunity to listen to me. Listen to me, listen to, I did not have a firearm in mind. We can prove that we're beyond that point, buddy. We'll be on that man. No, they did not do what you think I did. I know you did. Were passed, passed.

Speaker 2:          05:12          You know it. They know it. Let's just drop the charade. The next phase is themed development. After accusing someone, the cops will try to provide themes to offer moral or psychological justifications for the crime. Nobody's going to confess if they think it makes them look bad or their dignities at stake. So the cops want to give you a way to lose without losing face. This will never be used in your favor. When the confession goes to trial, of course, these are simply mind games that are used to get the confession.

Speaker 1:          05:39          We sort of believe that it could have been a fucking accident. It could have been accidental discharge. Okay. But when you don't, when you're completely denying it, and then I got to think another way, Bro, I don't believe you're a cold blooded killer. No, I don't believe that at all. Nothing's suggested it to me. I think you're a smart guy, and I think you got involved in a situation that you probably shouldn't have. There's a difference between you going in and saying, I'm gonna kill somebody and you're going in. I'm trying to help somebody, and then shit goes bad. They're just waiting different things as we're talking about. What other options? I don't think you want the cold blooded psychopaths function. I might be wrong because I don't get me wrong. I've met guys who actually kind of enjoyed the notoriety, got off on it. I don't see that. If I saw that you have when he'd be back in, you're talking to you quite frankly, but maybe I'm wrong. Maybe you got me fooled. I don't know.

Speaker 2:          06:36          This is where most people start to break. Most people often go into a passive mood when they're about to confess, looking beat down and acting quiet. This is the first time that you'll seriously start considering confession. There's even a physical tell called the surrender position that cops look for to know when you're about to confess. It looks like this. When the cop sees this, he will continue to reiterate all the themes that have been developed so far. We know you did it. We have evidence and good guys come clean. In addition to deploying psychological measures, the cup full also deploy physical ones. Remember that the cops chair can roll and during this time he will often move closer. In order to ramp up the tension in the room, you will feel trapped like there's nowhere to go and meanwhile a physically intimidated cop is telling you that you have to confess. You must confess. Finally, there's a moment when the tension that has been building up for hours finally breaks. You can almost see it

Speaker 1:          07:37          minimizing sort of way that'd be do that. Wow. You start out by telling the truth. Okay, okay, where is she man?

Speaker 2:          08:04          And once the cop gets their confession, it's all over your chance of being let off. Go to almost zero. Your plea deals. Get a lot worse and you have gained absolutely nothing from the exchange except for the knowledge of just how good cops are at beating you in the interrogation room.

Speaker 4:          08:17          I just think I'd look guilty if I hired a lawyer. Actually, it's getting arrested that makes people look guilty. Even the innocent ones, an innocent people get arrested every day and they find themselves in a little room with a detective who acts like he's their best friend. Talked to me, he says, help me clear this thing up, but you don't need a lawyer. Only guilty people need lawyers and boom, hey, that's when it all goes south.

Speaker 2:          08:45          It's time to come clean. Are you following me on these platforms? We have communities on reddit and discord and the bigger they grow, the more fun they are.

Speaker 5:          09:20          of your conviction, man. It's simple addition and the dentis with has gone to put you in prison. So give us a sentence talking about Yo contrition. It's just a simple admission that may help yo condition and that's the story of how they get you. Here's one final admonition. Don't talk without a lawyer.
