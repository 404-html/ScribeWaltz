Speaker 1:          00:00          Apple has an advertising style that's as iconic as it is copied the Internet, is full of parodies and lookalikes from competitors, yet somehow the magic in apple's commercials isn't spoiled even though we know the formula, it never ceases to blow our minds to see the newest iphone commercial come out.

Speaker 2:          00:14          Why? What makes apple special? A big reason is thanks to the guidance of Mike Markkula. He was an early investor in apple and was the vice president of marketing in 1977 when apple was first getting off the ground. Marcola wrote a three point marketing philosophy that has been in the forefront of the company ever since. Apple's marketing focus. He says, should be empathy, focus and impute with empathy. Apple strive to connect with customers feelings while other talk about detailed specs and processor power. Apple talks a lot about battery life, the way it feels in your hands and the way it will connect you with others. Focus focused on accomplishing the main goals and eliminate unimportant opportunities. While other companies make a million different variations of their products. Apple only makes a few. When Steve Jobs came back to apple, he cut down their number of product lines from several dozen to four by refocusing apple on a few products, they were able to create a superior experience.

Speaker 2:          01:06          Impute. This is possibly the most important principle of Margolis marketing manifesto. Mark Road. People do judge a book by its cover. You may have the best products, but if you present them poorly, it will be perceived. If you present them in a creative professional manner, you will impute the desired qualities. In other words, the way an iphone ad is presented is the way that the iphone will be perceived and that seems obvious, but this means that even the colors of the ad, whether the space is cluttered or clean, the tone of voice of the narrator, he animations control the way the iphone is viewed. Even though all of these have nothing to do with actual performance and this can either hurt or help a company, which is why mark nature, apple kept it as a guiding principle to their business. Fast forward, 40 years later, apple is the master at using this to their advantage. If you watch an apple ad, you can find everything you need to know from the first few seconds, even if the audio is muted. Now that we know the three philosophies apple uses to advertise, let's talk about the types of advertisements apple does in the lifecycle of one of their products. They pretty much fall into three categories. The introduction, this is the first video and it's basically a hype video pumped up music, pretty screens everywhere. Basically just showing off the phone.

Speaker 3:          02:20          Iphone seven makes the things you do most even better. It's the best iphone we've ever made.

Speaker 2:          02:29          The specs, this is the second video they'll make if they can get johnny ive to do this one. That's the best point of this video is to make people feel like their old devices outdated and slow. A ton of talk about redesign and a lot, a lot of comparative words, and they'll also use pretty sounding, but ultimately meaningless. Words like color gamut, advanced sensors, and unique.

Speaker 1:          02:51          To put it on a much larger scale, we designed it's 78 percent more screen area, a greater level of precision. We completely

Speaker 3:          03:00          re engineered the tuck subsystem, increasing the sensitivity of the sensors, doubling the touch refresh rate the most, the highest greater risk, specifically designed for much larger display and see more precise multitouch technology in entirely new for speaker architecture in more an indifferent ways flexibility, we've developed a new technology, more productive, more creative and entirely new scale.

Speaker 2:          03:28          After the intro inspects, it's all about narrative. This is just classic content marketing and what is that? Basically it's when you tell a story where your product just so happens to facilitate or caused something to happen, but there's no explicit promotion. Pay attention to this video because it's the classic case of content marketing.

Speaker 2:          03:53          Oh, you're watching your daughter at a Romeo and Juliet. Play in capturing that special moment. Well, catch it better with the new iphone. This is a really good way to sell anything. This phase continues through the rest of the product life cycle until they announced the next device, at which point we come to distancing. This really isn't an ad, but it's necessary for advertising. This is where they wipe all the evidence and the old advertisements from their channel and their webpage. This is so customers don't get distracted when they want to buy a refurbished and five, when the iphone seven is out, and this is also assuming never realized they've been saying the same stuff for years. That's pretty much it. Now you know how apple advertises. Thanks for watching.
