Speaker 1:          00:00          I started a patriotic, it's another way to support me. The first is to watch my videos. The second is to share them with friends. And the third is to back this channel with money. You don't have to do this, you're not a second class viewer. If you don't become a patron, these videos will always be free. But I do want to give you, if you're able and don't mind signing up for yet another website, the opportunity to help me take this small one man channel to the next level. What do I mean? Well here on coffee break, I do everything on a shoe string budget. Ever noticed there's not much pizazz in these videos and not much Polish. Not to mention a while back people saw me buying Maxwell House coffee. What with your support we can get better fuel for these videos and we can get some much needed Polish.

Speaker 1:          00:39          So let's talk a little bit more about the site. The website patrion originally comes from the word patron, which has Roman origins and it's a word for some wealthy person who supported and artists to do his work. And while it may be a stretch to call my work art, it isn't a stretch to become one of my patrons because there's only two levels of support, $1 a month and $5 a month. $1 a month is less than the cost of a hot and spicy chicken at Mcdonald's. The standard metric of value back from my college days and if you choose to support my channel with his amount, you'll be joining the proletariat members of the coffee break economy. You are the backbone of everything we will achieve in this channel from here on out, and I want to thank you sincerely. If you choose me over a delicious sandwich, I'd be torn over the dilemma myself.

Speaker 1:          01:19          The second level of support is $5 a month. This is some big papa dollars and roughly equal to your average trip to starbucks if you choose to support me instead of buying yourself a frothy caffeine infused beverage, you've achieved true self sacrifice for this, you will rise to the prestigious rank of the Burj Wallasey, a member of the burrs. Rosie is not fundamentally different from the proletariat in any way, but they think they're better people and they definitely have more money for being in either group. You will get a title that you can load over people in or discord as well as when we start our separate it. You can have your title there as well. Over time, I also will be releasing patrion exclusive videos and more. Please note there are no material perks associated with being in either of these groups other than my sincere gratitude for supporting me, but I do plan on fostering some healthy class warfare between the two.

Speaker 1:          02:04          So if you were going to support me anyways and you want the fun of belonging to a community and the joys of hating outsiders for no reason, this is the Patrion free you goals. Now for my goals, I'm going to keep it simple at $150 a month. My monthly coffee needs, we'll have been met. Yes, I drink too much coffee. Yes, I should cut back and yes, I can quit anytime I want it to. It's just that now isn't really a great time. You know, quit judging me, but my big goal and it is a big one, is to get $3,000 a month. This gets me to the place where I can officially drop my day job and do this full time. It would also increase my videos per month from about one to one and a half per month to more like three to four per month and it would mean I could create bigger and more ambitious videos.

Speaker 1:          02:43          This is my dream goal and it's where I want to be. I find the work that I do on coffee break to be extremely meaningful. I love stimulating conversations, telling stories and diving into research topics and if you'll help me, I want to do more of it. Ultimately don't know what to expect from all this. It's kind of an experiment. People have been mentioning that they want to support my channel, but I don't know how big of a minority of my channel that is. If none of you guys support the channel, that's fine. I'll keep making videos, but if you can and want to, I sincerely thank you and I'm excited to see where this journey takes us.

Speaker 2:          03:29          Okay.
