Speaker 1:          00:00          Hey, I've been gone for a while. Part of the reason is I just got back from my honeymoon, which was awesome, and also for the past few weeks I've been working partly on a new coffee break and partly on a brand new series called coffee with, which is an interview show where I explore the lives of creators, the first one being well or a fellow video sas. If you like me, if you like what I do, you feel like people like me and you're going to love this show, so please go check it out. Support the channel. Now, just so you know, it's a new channel, so if you're subscribed to me, you're not going to be subscribed to the new channel. Please also subscribe to that.

Speaker 2:          00:56          Okay.

Speaker 3:          01:00          Welcome to New York.

Speaker 1:          01:04          So I tried shooting this intro live several times, but each time I miserably failed. So let me start again. This is an interview show called coffee with where I have interesting conversations over coffee with youtube or anyone that's interesting. This is the first episode where but amazing will scooter, but before we get to who he is and start the show, I want to tell you why I created coffee with, now that I finished the interview and have had time to collect my thoughts. If you don't know me, I run coffee, break a video as a channel where I break down big ideas, but besides being a creator myself, I'm also a really big fan of other youtubers that break down big ideas. I love when someone can teach complex ideas and are on the cutting edge of using media to do so and I want to talk with some of these people, discuss their ideas, inspirations and origins.

Speaker 1:          01:48          Usually these people are behind a curtain and professionalism and their videos, but if you strip that away and just talk with them, you find that there unexpectedly witty or funny or kind, and I want to show that over a cup of coffee. This will be available as a podcast, as a video interview on Youtube and highlight should also be going up soon. For our first guest. We have will scooter. He makes videos on culture, irony, postmodernism philosophy, that brain and even Mr Rogers. In this interview we talk about what it means to be a video sas. We Talk Philosophy, the age of distraction. We live in will's gratitude notes. He writes every morning and more. It's a little slow going at first, but I think we hit our stride toward the middle and some really cool stuff comes out of the conversation. Grab a cup of coffee, grab a cozy couch. Here's me fund in New York City and here's what we talked about.
