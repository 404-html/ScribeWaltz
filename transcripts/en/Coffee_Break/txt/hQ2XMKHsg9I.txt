Speaker 1:          00:00          The stories we tell ourselves, echo affecting our behavior and what our future stories will eventually say. Rebounding from expectations to action, bringing to life. We are creatures that live on narratives, entertained by the stories we hear and directed by the stories we believe about ourselves and our world. For example, if you're convinced you're not a runner and you don't enjoy running, you will prove yourself right because you're unlikely to lace up every morning to run. If you don't believe the goal you're chasing is attainable and that will lead you to drop out of high school cross country after less than a couple of weeks, siding dubious claims of an inability to get up early enough in the morning. Alternatively, if four years later, you're a silly experiment in college kid and you try playing a sound bite in your head everyday that despite your history of failure at rapid bipedal locomotion, you're actually a runner at heart and you love it.

Speaker 1:          00:49          In that case, since you're a runner who loves running, you're probably going to get out there, which given a few months training will make your fictional narrative come to fruition. I'm bringing this up because it's valuable to know that to some extent you can decide what stories you believe and in turn live with meaning. If you want to say pick up the guitar, it might be worth mentally doing some work to tell yourself a story that you're a guitar player instead of thinking of yourself as just another person with a guitar in the closet. This shift in mindset, if you believe it can have a profound impact in the way that you relate to that instrument and how much you practice over the next few years. It's worth noting here that this isn't some secret that will miraculously make you able to achieve anything. This is just a way to use the power that stories have in making our identity to help you get into the right type of behavioral patterns for the results you want. More than just at the beginner level though at the highest level of competition and performance, storytelling seems to matter the most because there's a level of focus required that almost demands a narrative that has nothing to do with reality. Here's Arnold Schwarzenegger talking about this concept on Tim Ferriss's podcast for how he won his first junior, Mr Europe.

Speaker 2:          01:57          It was so clear to me that you were going to win and that you knew or believed you were going to win. Your face was so confident. Where did that confidence come from? My confidence came from my vision. If you have a very clear vision of where you want to go, then the rest of it is much easier because you know always why you training five hours a day, you always know why you pushing and going through the pain barrier. I see myself clearly on that stage winning the Mr Universe as cms itself, very clearly of getting the trophy, standing, debit the trophy, raising it above my head, and having hundreds of bodybuilders around me on stage, uh, looking up and idolizing me, including the thousands of people that are watching the event. So there was always made clear vision and that always inspired me, uh, to go all out.

Speaker 1:          02:48          Now he relates to this concept through visualization and vision, but this is just the kind of storytelling about the future and this deliberate storytelling was the key to his success because before he had won first competition, if you were an outsider looking in, arnold had no reason to be that confident except for his internal story. He was enrolled in the military, he was poor, and he wasn't bodyboarding full time. Most impartial observers would have seen his dream is a bad bet, but you can't train five hours a day on a bad bet. You can only train that much if you believe that you're destined to be number one. And he believed that and because he believed that he trained as if it were true, eventually making the story as true in the real world as it was in his head. Now this doesn't just apply to athletics or skills, that's just a sphere where it's easiest to see how this works.

Speaker 1:          03:34          The same is true of our beliefs about the world. If you tell yourself that the world is cruel, you might subconsciously explain away good things happening is just setting you up to fall harder to later and explain bad things happening as part of a raked chaotic system that inexorably is leading you to a cold grave. You can also tell a much different story, but the world is on the whole good, which will lead you to a much different interpretation of the data, a much brighter and happier interpretation I might add. And it's your choice. What narrative you believe, even in the face of seemingly difficult experience. Take Malala who chose to believe in a narrative of love and forgiveness even after being attacked by the Taliban.

Speaker 3:          04:13          So you were shot in the face at 15 years old and you have no anger towards the man who shot you. How is that possible?

Speaker 4:          04:22          I think they made a big mistake, um, because I was fighting for the right of education right from the beginning when the Taliban stop cars from going to school. But I had this little bit of fear that what would happen to me? How would I feel if someone it takes me. But after that incident, when I was attacked, that fear just went away. And as I said in my speech at the United Nations that my weakness, my fear and my hopelessness died on that day and I became stronger than before.

Speaker 1:          04:50          Rather than responding with rage, she uses it as fuel to double down on her courage, belief and hope for the world. Just like in the world of skills, the philosophical narratives you subscribed to have affects on more than just the internal interpreted experience because that interpreted experience then bins back and behaves in the world. So if you expect the bad, you might just experience more of it because you find yourself frowning at others, suspecting them and being guarded. Conversely, if you expect the good, you just might find it like Malala did. Stories we tell ourselves are more than just important fables. They make up the fabric of our identity and influence the dance of the main actor in our story. So listen, look and read broadly. But we have to carefully curate the stories in our libraries that we tell ourselves. Knowing that the next chapter will reflect the last one we read. Curiously, the idea that you can change your future story by believing a different one is itself a kind of narrative. Is this idea nothing more than an idealistic fairy tale or will you add this to your library? It's up to you.

Speaker 1:          06:05          I haven't gone in a quick thank you to those of you who have supported me on Patrion. Thank you for allowing me to tell stories that I think are rich and valuable. These are the stories in my library.
