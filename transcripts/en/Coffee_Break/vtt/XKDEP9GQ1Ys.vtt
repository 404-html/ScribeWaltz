1
00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:03.270
<v Speaker 1>I started a patriotic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's another way to support me.</v>

2
00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:04.133
<v Speaker 1>The first is to watch my videos.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The second is to share them with </v>

3
00:00:06.031 --> 00:00:06.864
<v Speaker 1>friends.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the third is to back this channel </v>

4
00:00:08.101 --> 00:00:09.840
<v Speaker 1>with money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't have to do this,</v>

5
00:00:09.841 --> 00:00:12.210
<v Speaker 1>you're not a second class viewer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you don't become a patron,</v>

6
00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:15.450
<v Speaker 1>these videos will always be free.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I do want to give you,</v>

7
00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:18.510
<v Speaker 1>if you're able and don't mind signing up</v>
<v Speaker 1>for yet another website,</v>

8
00:00:18.511 --> 00:00:22.320
<v Speaker 1>the opportunity to help me take this </v>
<v Speaker 1>small one man channel to the next level.</v>

9
00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:24.420
<v Speaker 1>What do I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well here on coffee break,</v>

10
00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:25.463
<v Speaker 1>I do everything on a shoe string budget.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ever noticed there's not much pizazz in </v>

11
00:00:28.291 --> 00:00:29.124
<v Speaker 1>these videos and not much Polish.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not to mention a while back people saw </v>

12
00:00:33.001 --> 00:00:36.540
<v Speaker 1>me buying Maxwell House coffee.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What with your support we can get better</v>

13
00:00:36.541 --> 00:00:39.420
<v Speaker 1>fuel for these videos and we can get </v>
<v Speaker 1>some much needed Polish.</v>

14
00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:41.220
<v Speaker 1>So let's talk a little bit more about </v>
<v Speaker 1>the site.</v>

15
00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:43.740
<v Speaker 1>The website patrion originally comes </v>
<v Speaker 1>from the word patron,</v>

16
00:00:43.741 --> 00:00:44.574
<v Speaker 1>which has Roman origins and it's a word </v>
<v Speaker 1>for some wealthy person who supported </v>

17
00:00:47.641 --> 00:00:50.790
<v Speaker 1>and artists to do his work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And while it may be a stretch to call my</v>

18
00:00:50.791 --> 00:00:51.624
<v Speaker 1>work art,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it isn't a stretch to become one of my </v>

19
00:00:52.891 --> 00:00:55.500
<v Speaker 1>patrons because there's only two levels </v>
<v Speaker 1>of support,</v>

20
00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:56.603
<v Speaker 1>$1 a month and $5 a month.</v>
<v Speaker 1>$1 a month is less than the cost of a </v>

21
00:00:59.911 --> 00:01:00.744
<v Speaker 1>hot and spicy chicken at Mcdonald's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The standard metric of value back from </v>

22
00:01:03.391 --> 00:01:06.330
<v Speaker 1>my college days and if you choose to </v>
<v Speaker 1>support my channel with his amount,</v>

23
00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:09.720
<v Speaker 1>you'll be joining the proletariat </v>
<v Speaker 1>members of the coffee break economy.</v>

24
00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:11.033
<v Speaker 1>You are the backbone of everything we </v>
<v Speaker 1>will achieve in this channel from here </v>

25
00:01:13.081 --> 00:01:15.210
<v Speaker 1>on out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I want to thank you sincerely.</v>

26
00:01:15.211 --> 00:01:17.070
<v Speaker 1>If you choose me over a delicious </v>
<v Speaker 1>sandwich,</v>

27
00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:19.110
<v Speaker 1>I'd be torn over the dilemma myself.</v>

28
00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:21.660
<v Speaker 1>The second level of support is $5 a </v>
<v Speaker 1>month.</v>

29
00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:22.523
<v Speaker 1>This is some big papa dollars and </v>
<v Speaker 1>roughly equal to your average trip to </v>

30
00:01:24.661 --> 00:01:25.494
<v Speaker 1>starbucks if you choose to support me </v>
<v Speaker 1>instead of buying yourself a frothy </v>

31
00:01:28.141 --> 00:01:28.974
<v Speaker 1>caffeine infused beverage,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've achieved true self sacrifice for </v>

32
00:01:31.861 --> 00:01:33.780
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you will rise to the prestigious rank of</v>

33
00:01:33.781 --> 00:01:36.390
<v Speaker 1>the Burj Wallasey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a member of the burrs.</v>

34
00:01:36.391 --> 00:01:39.600
<v Speaker 1>Rosie is not fundamentally different </v>
<v Speaker 1>from the proletariat in any way,</v>

35
00:01:39.601 --> 00:01:40.434
<v Speaker 1>but they think they're better people and</v>
<v Speaker 1>they definitely have more money for </v>

36
00:01:43.291 --> 00:01:44.124
<v Speaker 1>being in either group.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You will get a title that you can load </v>

37
00:01:45.571 --> 00:01:48.480
<v Speaker 1>over people in or discord as well as </v>
<v Speaker 1>when we start our separate it.</v>

38
00:01:48.481 --> 00:01:51.000
<v Speaker 1>You can have your title there as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Over time,</v>

39
00:01:51.001 --> 00:01:53.970
<v Speaker 1>I also will be releasing patrion </v>
<v Speaker 1>exclusive videos and more.</v>

40
00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:58.110
<v Speaker 1>Please note there are no material perks </v>
<v Speaker 1>associated with being in either of these</v>

41
00:01:58.111 --> 00:02:00.690
<v Speaker 1>groups other than my sincere gratitude </v>
<v Speaker 1>for supporting me,</v>

42
00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:04.020
<v Speaker 1>but I do plan on fostering some healthy </v>
<v Speaker 1>class warfare between the two.</v>

43
00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:04.853
<v Speaker 1>So if you were going to support me </v>
<v Speaker 1>anyways and you want the fun of </v>

44
00:02:06.601 --> 00:02:10.290
<v Speaker 1>belonging to a community and the joys of</v>
<v Speaker 1>hating outsiders for no reason,</v>

45
00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:14.250
<v Speaker 1>this is the Patrion free you goals.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now for my goals,</v>

46
00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:17.280
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to keep it simple at $150 a </v>
<v Speaker 1>month.</v>

47
00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:19.500
<v Speaker 1>My monthly coffee needs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll have been met.</v>

48
00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:20.910
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I drink too much coffee.</v>

49
00:02:20.911 --> 00:02:22.260
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I should cut back and yes,</v>

50
00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:23.123
<v Speaker 1>I can quit anytime I want it to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just that now isn't really a great </v>

51
00:02:25.081 --> 00:02:25.860
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

52
00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:29.190
<v Speaker 1>quit judging me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but my big goal and it is a big one,</v>

53
00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:30.990
<v Speaker 1>is to get $3,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>a month.</v>

54
00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:31.913
<v Speaker 1>This gets me to the place where I can </v>
<v Speaker 1>officially drop my day job and do this </v>

55
00:02:34.261 --> 00:02:35.094
<v Speaker 1>full time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It would also increase my videos per </v>

56
00:02:36.421 --> 00:02:40.020
<v Speaker 1>month from about one to one and a half </v>
<v Speaker 1>per month to more like three to four per</v>

57
00:02:40.021 --> 00:02:43.440
<v Speaker 1>month and it would mean I could create </v>
<v Speaker 1>bigger and more ambitious videos.</v>

58
00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:46.620
<v Speaker 1>This is my dream goal and it's where I </v>
<v Speaker 1>want to be.</v>

59
00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:50.250
<v Speaker 1>I find the work that I do on coffee </v>
<v Speaker 1>break to be extremely meaningful.</v>

60
00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:54.090
<v Speaker 1>I love stimulating conversations,</v>
<v Speaker 1>telling stories and diving into research</v>

61
00:02:54.091 --> 00:02:57.030
<v Speaker 1>topics and if you'll help me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to do more of it.</v>

62
00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:00.610
<v Speaker 1>Ultimately don't know what to expect </v>
<v Speaker 1>from all this.</v>

63
00:03:00.611 --> 00:03:01.444
<v Speaker 1>It's kind of an experiment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People have been mentioning that they </v>

64
00:03:03.311 --> 00:03:04.144
<v Speaker 1>want to support my channel,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I don't know how big of a minority </v>

65
00:03:06.281 --> 00:03:08.980
<v Speaker 1>of my channel that is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If none of you guys support the channel,</v>

66
00:03:08.981 --> 00:03:10.510
<v Speaker 1>that's fine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll keep making videos,</v>

67
00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:15.250
<v Speaker 1>but if you can and want to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I sincerely thank you and I'm excited to</v>

68
00:03:15.251 --> 00:03:16.600
<v Speaker 1>see where this journey takes us.</v>

69
00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:29.973
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
