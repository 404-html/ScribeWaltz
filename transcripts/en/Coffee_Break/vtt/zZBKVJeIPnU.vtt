00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:04.260
<v Speaker 1>Casey neistat represents to most people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think what's possible through a career</v>

2
00:00:04.261 --> 00:00:07.140
<v Speaker 1>on youtube.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's had a successful short film career,</v>

3
00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:08.153
<v Speaker 1>landed a multimillion dollar acquisition</v>
<v Speaker 1>from CNN for his company and his </v>

4
00:00:10.801 --> 00:00:11.634
<v Speaker 1>insanely popular.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So how did [inaudible] get here after </v>

5
00:00:14.281 --> 00:00:16.710
<v Speaker 1>being a high school dropout?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think if you'd ask him,</v>

6
00:00:16.711 --> 00:00:18.780
<v Speaker 1>he'd say what he has said a million </v>
<v Speaker 1>times already.</v>

7
00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:22.190
<v Speaker 1>It was a lot of work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nice.</v>

8
00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:23.113
<v Speaker 1>That's hardly the only one doing this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's part of a growing trend of people </v>

9
00:00:25.201 --> 00:00:28.140
<v Speaker 1>that have been selling the silver bullet</v>
<v Speaker 1>of success to be</v>

10
00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:34.420
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible].</v>

11
00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:42.490
<v Speaker 1>The simple answer here is very simply </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you need to,</v>

12
00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:46.810
<v Speaker 1>you need to work harder and faster.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's really nothing else.</v>

13
00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:51.440
<v Speaker 1>This idea of working harder is always </v>
<v Speaker 1>the answer.</v>

14
00:00:51.441 --> 00:00:54.250
<v Speaker 1>It has an almost frat boy has fallen </v>
<v Speaker 1>into it and it's hard to Ms.</v>

15
00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:55.083
<v Speaker 1>White.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So appealing.</v>

16
00:00:55.330 --> 00:00:57.460
<v Speaker 1>It's an athlete's mentality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hardware,</v>

17
00:00:58.150 --> 00:00:58.983
<v Speaker 1>there's a real drama and excitement to </v>
<v Speaker 1>the struggle and everything's always </v>

18
00:01:01.421 --> 00:01:02.254
<v Speaker 1>within your control.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But is that all it took for Neistat to </v>

19
00:01:04.901 --> 00:01:07.690
<v Speaker 1>go from broke to here?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think so.</v>

20
00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:10.420
<v Speaker 1>Hard work was necessary for nice debt </v>
<v Speaker 1>success,</v>

21
00:01:10.421 --> 00:01:13.630
<v Speaker 1>but not sufficient.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Success is not solely a function of hard</v>

22
00:01:13.631 --> 00:01:14.464
<v Speaker 1>work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's highly dependent on the quality of </v>

23
00:01:15.611 --> 00:01:18.130
<v Speaker 1>the career opportunity or idea that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're pursuing.</v>

24
00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:19.833
<v Speaker 1>Think of the millions of people working </v>
<v Speaker 1>minimum wage jobs in America who are </v>

25
00:01:22.061 --> 00:01:26.260
<v Speaker 1>working hard sometimes 80 hours a week </v>
<v Speaker 1>just to stay afloat for these people.</v>

26
00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:29.020
<v Speaker 1>It's not about hard work,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if hard work isn't enough,</v>

27
00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:31.000
<v Speaker 1>how did Neistat becomes so successful?</v>

28
00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:34.600
<v Speaker 1>So let me explain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In the book outliers,</v>

29
00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:37.900
<v Speaker 1>Malcolm Gladwell analyzes people who </v>
<v Speaker 1>excel at their craft.</v>

30
00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:39.333
<v Speaker 1>He finds that good timing plays a big </v>
<v Speaker 1>role in why many people become </v>

31
00:01:41.921 --> 00:01:43.960
<v Speaker 1>successful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even Bill Gates,</v>

32
00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:45.783
<v Speaker 1>he talks about one of the secrets to </v>
<v Speaker 1>Bill Gates success was that he had </v>

33
00:01:47.531 --> 00:01:48.364
<v Speaker 1>access to a computer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That key could practice coding on years </v>

34
00:01:50.681 --> 00:01:54.100
<v Speaker 1>before most people did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So Bill Gates literally had thousands of</v>

35
00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:54.933
<v Speaker 1>hours of programming practice under his </v>
<v Speaker 1>belt before anyone else got started in </v>

36
00:01:58.011 --> 00:01:58.844
<v Speaker 1>this competitive advantage position in </v>
<v Speaker 1>perfectly to take advantage of the pc </v>

37
00:02:01.541 --> 00:02:06.370
<v Speaker 1>revolution they started when the Altair </v>
<v Speaker 1>computer came out in 1975 well,</v>

38
00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:07.233
<v Speaker 1>just like the computer revolution,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there has been a filmmaking revolution </v>

39
00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:13.180
<v Speaker 1>since youtube came out in 2005 and light</v>
<v Speaker 1>gates.</v>

40
00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:14.103
<v Speaker 1>Nice tech,</v>
<v Speaker 1>got a critical headstart in filmmaking </v>

41
00:02:15.371 --> 00:02:18.160
<v Speaker 1>before most would be youtube or had even</v>
<v Speaker 1>picked up a camera.</v>

42
00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:22.060
<v Speaker 1>See Neistat first got into professional </v>
<v Speaker 1>filmmaking with a guy named Tom Sachs in</v>

43
00:02:22.061 --> 00:02:22.894
<v Speaker 1>2001 he developed a lot of his style </v>
<v Speaker 1>here and he continued honing his craft </v>

44
00:02:26.441 --> 00:02:27.274
<v Speaker 1>of filmmaking with several videos and an</v>
<v Speaker 1>hbo special so that later in 2010 when </v>

45
00:02:31.601 --> 00:02:32.434
<v Speaker 1>he fully embraced the youtube space,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his content was noticeably more refined </v>

46
00:02:35.501 --> 00:02:36.334
<v Speaker 1>and substantive than his peers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is part of the magic of </v>

47
00:02:38.411 --> 00:02:39.100
<v Speaker 1>watching Neistat.</v>

48
00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:41.800
<v Speaker 1>His style seems to come fully formed </v>
<v Speaker 1>right out of the gate,</v>

49
00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:45.100
<v Speaker 1>whereas most youtubers have to find </v>
<v Speaker 1>their voice within the first few years.</v>

50
00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:47.590
<v Speaker 1>Nice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That had already found his with nearly a</v>

51
00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:50.560
<v Speaker 1>decade of practice and your spelling.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So with this in mind,</v>

52
00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:52.540
<v Speaker 1>the final piece of this story becomes </v>
<v Speaker 1>obvious.</v>

53
00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:56.220
<v Speaker 1>Neistat's rise to be youtube favorite </v>
<v Speaker 1>blogger when nice.</v>

54
00:02:56.221 --> 00:03:00.970
<v Speaker 1>That entered the vlog space in 2015 he </v>
<v Speaker 1>was joining group of loggers with little</v>

55
00:03:00.971 --> 00:03:03.320
<v Speaker 1>film experience,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which makes it clear why nice.</v>

56
00:03:03.321 --> 00:03:05.110
<v Speaker 1>That's quality stands above the rest.</v>

57
00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:09.080
<v Speaker 3>[inaudible]</v>

58
00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:13.630
<v Speaker 1>it's also why you see comments like this</v>
<v Speaker 1>on his luck all the time.</v>

59
00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:16.300
<v Speaker 3>It's a bit like watching a professional </v>
<v Speaker 3>baseball player</v>

60
00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:19.950
<v Speaker 1>play in a high school game.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He just had way more experience.</v>

61
00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:20.993
<v Speaker 1>So Nice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's timing with filmmaking was </v>

62
00:03:22.111 --> 00:03:24.090
<v Speaker 1>perfect.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How'd he started filmmaking earlier?</v>

63
00:03:24.091 --> 00:03:26.550
<v Speaker 1>He might have been too far into a career</v>
<v Speaker 1>to switch to youtube,</v>

64
00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:30.330
<v Speaker 1>which is why most career filmmakers miss</v>
<v Speaker 1>the youtube and how he started later.</v>

65
00:03:30.331 --> 00:03:32.760
<v Speaker 1>He'd just be another Vlog or trying to </v>
<v Speaker 1>figure out his style.</v>

66
00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:34.103
<v Speaker 1>But what happened was the combination of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the right idea at the right work ethic </v>

67
00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:37.793
<v Speaker 1>and the right timing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what made Casey Neistat </v>

68
00:03:40.171 --> 00:03:41.550
<v Speaker 1>successful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

69
00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:42.593
<v Speaker 1>so why does it matter?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The nice that somewhat undersells the </v>

70
00:03:44.931 --> 00:03:46.830
<v Speaker 1>role luck played in his success.</v>

71
00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:48.451
<v Speaker 3>Luck,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

72
00:03:48.451 --> 00:03:50.850
<v Speaker 3>all that other education,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all that,</v>

73
00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:53.010
<v Speaker 3>like it's not even in the same pie </v>
<v Speaker 3>chart.</v>

74
00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:53.863
<v Speaker 1>I think what bothers me is a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 1>people see nice that I want to become </v>

75
00:03:56.271 --> 00:03:57.104
<v Speaker 1>filmmakers like him and are told that </v>
<v Speaker 1>work because the only thing that's </v>

76
00:04:00.591 --> 00:04:03.290
<v Speaker 1>standing in their way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but this isn't actually true.</v>

77
00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:04.573
<v Speaker 1>What made nice that go from a small </v>
<v Speaker 1>indie filmmaker to the cover of Gq </v>

78
00:04:07.341 --> 00:04:11.990
<v Speaker 1>magazine in less than two years was </v>
<v Speaker 1>bringing nearly 15 years of professional</v>

79
00:04:11.991 --> 00:04:15.470
<v Speaker 1>film experience into a field where most </v>
<v Speaker 1>people were total amateurs.</v>

80
00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:16.663
<v Speaker 1>But that has changed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The idea of being a Vlogger is worth a </v>

81
00:04:18.981 --> 00:04:19.814
<v Speaker 1>lot less now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now that there are hundreds of people </v>

82
00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:22.393
<v Speaker 1>occupying that space and producing </v>
<v Speaker 1>regular content and their contents </v>

83
00:04:24.711 --> 00:04:25.544
<v Speaker 1>getting better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I guess I just want to tell anybody </v>

84
00:04:27.381 --> 00:04:28.214
<v Speaker 1>with the hunger to be successful that </v>
<v Speaker 1>the next neistat probably won't be a </v>

85
00:04:30.681 --> 00:04:33.230
<v Speaker 1>Vlogger.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It will be someone who utilizes a timely</v>

86
00:04:33.231 --> 00:04:37.100
<v Speaker 1>competitive advantage to dominate the </v>
<v Speaker 1>market space or something like that.</v>

87
00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:39.970
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm just a youtuber and as a Youtuber,</v>

88
00:04:39.971 --> 00:04:42.470
<v Speaker 1>and this is the part of the video where </v>
<v Speaker 1>I tell you for the millionth time,</v>
