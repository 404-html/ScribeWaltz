00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:03.383
<v Speaker 1>Are you a sociopath?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Have you been caught with your pants </v>

2
00:00:05.131 --> 00:00:07.740
<v Speaker 1>down figuratively or literally in some </v>
<v Speaker 1>cases?</v>

3
00:00:08.850 --> 00:00:09.683
<v Speaker 1>Do you want to rejoin your moral </v>
<v Speaker 1>community and wind back the respect of </v>

4
00:00:11.551 --> 00:00:12.384
<v Speaker 1>your peers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but don't want to admit that you're </v>

5
00:00:13.051 --> 00:00:14.070
<v Speaker 1>wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

6
00:00:14.071 --> 00:00:14.904
<v Speaker 1>you've come to the right place today.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're going to learn about the art of </v>

7
00:00:17.461 --> 00:00:20.520
<v Speaker 1>the non-apology.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're going to take you from this.</v>

8
00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:25.700
<v Speaker 1>I did not have sexual relations with </v>
<v Speaker 1>that woman to this from this.</v>

9
00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:36.130
<v Speaker 2>Hey everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's me,</v>

10
00:00:36.131 --> 00:00:36.964
<v Speaker 2>Kathy Griffin.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm just now seeing the reaction of </v>

11
00:00:38.711 --> 00:00:43.711
<v Speaker 2>these images.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I made a mistake and I was wrong to this</v>

12
00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:46.540
<v Speaker 2>year.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This month.</v>

13
00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:49.420
<v Speaker 2>That picture was released by the way you</v>
<v Speaker 2>take the apology back</v>

14
00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:56.270
<v Speaker 1>if you're lucky from this</v>

15
00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:58.000
<v Speaker 2>and when you were starting to let you do</v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

16
00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:01.660
<v Speaker 2>I can do anything</v>

17
00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:02.980
<v Speaker 1>to this.</v>

18
00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:03.813
<v Speaker 3>What a great honor to be able to </v>
<v Speaker 3>introduce for the first time ever </v>

19
00:01:07.031 --> 00:01:07.864
<v Speaker 3>anywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The 45th president of the United States </v>

20
00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:13.660
<v Speaker 3>of America,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Donald J dot trump.</v>

21
00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:14.753
<v Speaker 4>Grandmother.</v>

22
00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:23.360
<v Speaker 1>Alright,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's do this number one.</v>

23
00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:25.910
<v Speaker 1>Don't apologize.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's start with the bread and butter.</v>

24
00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:30.110
<v Speaker 1>Have you tried not apologizing?</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is called the John Wayne Approach.</v>

25
00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:31.960
<v Speaker 3>Oh No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so just out by the waterfall,</v>

26
00:01:31.961 --> 00:01:33.730
<v Speaker 3>but I'm sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's never apologize,</v>

27
00:01:33.731 --> 00:01:35.170
<v Speaker 3>Mr.</v>
<v Speaker 3>to sign of weakness.</v>

28
00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:39.270
<v Speaker 1>This is often perceived by your </v>
<v Speaker 1>supporters as being strong and powerful.</v>

29
00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:41.910
<v Speaker 1>You don't have to apologize.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No matter what you do.</v>

30
00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:43.980
<v Speaker 1>This technique is endorsed by Donald </v>
<v Speaker 1>Trump.</v>

31
00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:49.130
<v Speaker 3>We are not going to apologize for </v>
<v Speaker 3>America no more apologies,</v>

32
00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:50.273
<v Speaker 1>and before you say there goes crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>trump changing American politics to be </v>

33
00:01:52.981 --> 00:01:54.810
<v Speaker 1>insensitive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just remember,</v>

34
00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:57.660
<v Speaker 1>this has been an American stands for </v>
<v Speaker 1>pretty much forever.</v>

35
00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:01.950
<v Speaker 1>I'll never apologize for the United </v>
<v Speaker 1>States of America ever.</v>

36
00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:06.060
<v Speaker 1>I don't care what the facts are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no matter what the facts are.</v>

37
00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:10.800
<v Speaker 1>This is America number two account.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't apologize.</v>

38
00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:12.300
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so if not,</v>

39
00:02:12.301 --> 00:02:15.390
<v Speaker 1>apologizing isn't an option.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You've really stepped in the Doodoo.</v>

40
00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:18.600
<v Speaker 1>Try Accounting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is when you don't apologize.</v>

41
00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:19.463
<v Speaker 1>You explained the context of when you </v>
<v Speaker 1>messed up and that supposedly justifies </v>

42
00:02:22.711 --> 00:02:24.690
<v Speaker 1>the action.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If they hadn't bought the liquor,</v>

43
00:02:24.691 --> 00:02:27.030
<v Speaker 1>you wouldn't have been drinking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and if you hadn't been drinking,</v>

44
00:02:27.031 --> 00:02:29.130
<v Speaker 1>you wouldn't have sent those </v>
<v Speaker 1>embarrassing photos of yourself.</v>

45
00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:33.270
<v Speaker 1>Roseanne put on a clinic of accounting a</v>
<v Speaker 1>few weeks ago when she said,</v>

46
00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:35.700
<v Speaker 1>oh no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't mean to tweet something.</v>

47
00:02:35.701 --> 00:02:38.730
<v Speaker 1>People interpreted as racist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was on Ambien,</v>

48
00:02:38.731 --> 00:02:39.570
<v Speaker 1>which made me sleep.</v>

49
00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:43.800
<v Speaker 1>Tweet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Rosanne has her CPA in accounting.</v>

50
00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:46.950
<v Speaker 1>Great stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Roseanne sets the bar.</v>

51
00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:50.490
<v Speaker 1>Number three,</v>
<v Speaker 1>apologize but don't change.</v>

52
00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:52.260
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this next one is a long con.</v>

53
00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:53.363
<v Speaker 1>You're going to say that you're sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then commit a string of activities </v>

54
00:02:56.911 --> 00:02:58.530
<v Speaker 1>that show that you really haven't </v>
<v Speaker 1>changed.</v>

55
00:02:59.140 --> 00:02:59.973
<v Speaker 1>This next example is a little long.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I of course am talking of Anthony's </v>

56
00:03:02.441 --> 00:03:04.990
<v Speaker 1>wieners apology.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is him in 2011.</v>

57
00:03:04.991 --> 00:03:07.480
<v Speaker 1>When the scandal first breaks last </v>
<v Speaker 1>Friday night,</v>

58
00:03:07.481 --> 00:03:08.314
<v Speaker 1>I tweeted a photograph of myself that I </v>
<v Speaker 1>intended to send us a direct message as </v>

59
00:03:11.441 --> 00:03:12.274
<v Speaker 1>part of a joke to a woman in Seattle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So today I'm announcing my resignation </v>

60
00:03:16.181 --> 00:03:21.181
<v Speaker 1>from Congress and two years later he </v>
<v Speaker 1>tries to repair his image.</v>

61
00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:23.153
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I made some big mistakes and I know I </v>

62
00:03:24.341 --> 00:03:27.640
<v Speaker 1>let a lot of people down,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I've also learned some tough lessons</v>

63
00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:29.010
<v Speaker 1>breaking news.</v>

64
00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:33.830
<v Speaker 5>I'm responsible for this behavior that </v>
<v Speaker 5>led us to be in this place.</v>

65
00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:34.873
<v Speaker 5>I want you again say sorry to anyone who</v>
<v Speaker 5>has received receiving end of these </v>

66
00:03:38.391 --> 00:03:39.224
<v Speaker 5>messages.</v>

67
00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:42.020
<v Speaker 1>This is a pretty risky maneuver.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A can backfire pretty hard,</v>

68
00:03:42.021 --> 00:03:46.030
<v Speaker 1>so please be careful with this one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Number four clarified.</v>

69
00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:46.873
<v Speaker 1>Don't apologize.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Another tactic is to say that your </v>

70
00:03:49.221 --> 00:03:51.680
<v Speaker 1>accuser misunderstood or misinterpreted </v>
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>

71
00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:54.470
<v Speaker 1>You really meant something else.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For this example,</v>

72
00:03:54.471 --> 00:03:55.304
<v Speaker 1>take a look at Megan Kelly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>confronting Donald trump about his own </v>

73
00:03:57.711 --> 00:03:59.150
<v Speaker 1>record.</v>
<v Speaker 1>History of misogyny.</v>

74
00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:01.250
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to sound too much like a </v>
<v Speaker 1>chauvinist,</v>

75
00:04:01.251 --> 00:04:03.290
<v Speaker 1>but you wouldn't have your job if you </v>
<v Speaker 1>weren't beautiful.</v>

76
00:04:03.291 --> 00:04:05.000
<v Speaker 1>It's very sad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd look at right in that fat,</v>

77
00:04:05.001 --> 00:04:06.890
<v Speaker 1>ugly face.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's gotten a little bit larger.</v>

78
00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:09.790
<v Speaker 6>Person who's flat chested is very hard </v>
<v Speaker 6>to be a 10.</v>

79
00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:11.050
<v Speaker 6>She ate like a pig,</v>

80
00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:13.350
<v Speaker 1>but what does he do?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Does he sit there and take it?</v>

81
00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:15.340
<v Speaker 1>Does he apologize?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

82
00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:17.910
<v Speaker 1>he clarifies it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He says,</v>

83
00:04:17.911 --> 00:04:21.030
<v Speaker 1>I wasn't talking about women.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was talking about Rosie O'donnell.</v>

84
00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:24.430
<v Speaker 7>You've called women.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You don't like fat pigs,</v>

85
00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:26.560
<v Speaker 7>dogs,</v>
<v Speaker 7>slobs,</v>

86
00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:30.040
<v Speaker 7>and disgusting animals.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Your twitter account,</v>

87
00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:31.530
<v Speaker 1>only rosie o'donnell.</v>

88
00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:43.790
<v Speaker 1>This can be extremely effective.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Onto the next example.</v>

89
00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:44.863
<v Speaker 1>Number five,</v>
<v Speaker 1>issue a statement but never actually </v>

90
00:04:46.941 --> 00:04:47.774
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sorry.</v>

91
00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:48.913
<v Speaker 1>So let's say you're Hillary Clinton,</v>
<v Speaker 1>someone running under the banner of </v>

92
00:04:50.661 --> 00:04:51.494
<v Speaker 1>women's rights and you find yourself in </v>
<v Speaker 1>trouble for not firing in 2008 campaign </v>

93
00:04:54.291 --> 00:04:56.180
<v Speaker 1>advisor who is accused of sexual </v>
<v Speaker 1>harassment.</v>

94
00:04:56.930 --> 00:04:58.160
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what is she going to do?</v>

95
00:04:58.340 --> 00:04:59.173
<v Speaker 1>Watch this play by play.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She issues a series of tweets where she </v>

96
00:05:02.271 --> 00:05:03.104
<v Speaker 1>explains herself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but notice she never uses apologize or </v>

97
00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:07.730
<v Speaker 1>sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>anywhere in here.</v>

98
00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:11.510
<v Speaker 1>Now you amateurs out there pay special </v>
<v Speaker 1>attention to this next part.</v>

99
00:05:11.511 --> 00:05:14.150
<v Speaker 1>See we call this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Washington doubled down.</v>

100
00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:15.313
<v Speaker 1>She gets caught out for that and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>she goes on to explain herself further </v>

101
00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:19.033
<v Speaker 1>in a really long facebook apologies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but still doesn't use words like </v>

102
00:05:22.881 --> 00:05:23.930
<v Speaker 1>apologizer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sorry.</v>

103
00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:27.050
<v Speaker 1>So it looks like she's apologizing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but she really isn't.</v>

104
00:05:27.850 --> 00:05:31.100
<v Speaker 1>Now before we move onto our last type of</v>
<v Speaker 1>non-apology in this video,</v>

105
00:05:31.340 --> 00:05:35.060
<v Speaker 1>let's take a second to analyze why </v>
<v Speaker 1>someone might use not apologies.</v>

106
00:05:35.550 --> 00:05:38.540
<v Speaker 1>Non-Apology is used for two reasons.</v>
<v Speaker 1>First,</v>

107
00:05:38.541 --> 00:05:41.450
<v Speaker 1>apologizing is all about not making </v>
<v Speaker 1>excuses,</v>

108
00:05:41.480 --> 00:05:44.630
<v Speaker 1>taking blame and putting yourself in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>hands of the offended.</v>

109
00:05:45.230 --> 00:05:47.570
<v Speaker 1>This is difficult if you're in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>position of power,</v>

110
00:05:47.571 --> 00:05:48.404
<v Speaker 1>it can make you feel weak.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It can cause legal issues because </v>

111
00:05:50.211 --> 00:05:51.044
<v Speaker 1>apologizing means you're admitting guilt</v>
<v Speaker 1>and some people simply don't like </v>

112
00:05:53.991 --> 00:05:57.020
<v Speaker 1>admitting when they're wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The second reason is maybe in your.</v>

113
00:05:57.290 --> 00:06:00.290
<v Speaker 1>You haven't committed a large enough </v>
<v Speaker 1>offense to warrant an apology.</v>

114
00:06:00.650 --> 00:06:02.360
<v Speaker 1>For this reason,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you might issue a halfhearted.</v>

115
00:06:02.361 --> 00:06:03.194
<v Speaker 1>Sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Different people have different </v>

116
00:06:04.341 --> 00:06:07.160
<v Speaker 1>thresholds for what deserves an apology.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Either way,</v>

117
00:06:07.161 --> 00:06:10.520
<v Speaker 1>it's worth knowing that if you do decide</v>
<v Speaker 1>to go the route of the non-apology,</v>

118
00:06:10.820 --> 00:06:14.360
<v Speaker 1>they often come off as unsatisfying at </v>
<v Speaker 1>best and unfeeling.</v>

119
00:06:14.361 --> 00:06:16.700
<v Speaker 1>At worst.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As you may have noticed in this video,</v>

120
00:06:16.701 --> 00:06:17.534
<v Speaker 1>humans have a natural instinct for </v>
<v Speaker 1>sensing if an apology is sincere and if </v>

121
00:06:20.811 --> 00:06:23.630
<v Speaker 1>the apologizers just trying to weasel </v>
<v Speaker 1>their way out of the offense.</v>

122
00:06:24.020 --> 00:06:24.853
<v Speaker 1>If you doubt this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>think of how unsatisfying these phrases </v>

123
00:06:26.811 --> 00:06:28.580
<v Speaker 1>are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sorry you got offended,</v>

124
00:06:28.581 --> 00:06:30.800
<v Speaker 1>or if I hurt anybody,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then I apologize.</v>

125
00:06:31.460 --> 00:06:33.980
<v Speaker 1>Still not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Apologies do have their place.</v>

126
00:06:34.130 --> 00:06:34.963
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes they have social utility and </v>
<v Speaker 1>sometimes they're all you can do as </v>

127
00:06:39.201 --> 00:06:41.150
<v Speaker 1>Edwin [inaudible] Astella points out in </v>
<v Speaker 1>his book.</v>

128
00:06:41.270 --> 00:06:43.640
<v Speaker 1>Sorry about that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The language of public apology.</v>

129
00:06:44.780 --> 00:06:47.570
<v Speaker 1>To illustrate this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he brings up a historical example.</v>

130
00:06:47.571 --> 00:06:48.404
<v Speaker 1>When in 1968 during the Vietnam war,</v>
<v Speaker 1>North Korean forces captured the USS </v>

131
00:06:52.910 --> 00:06:53.743
<v Speaker 1>Pueblo,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a ship gathering Intel on the North </v>

132
00:06:55.100 --> 00:06:55.933
<v Speaker 1>Koreans,</v>
<v Speaker 1>North Korea claimed the Pueblo had </v>

133
00:06:56.931 --> 00:06:57.764
<v Speaker 1>crossed the territory lines,</v>
<v Speaker 1>making them fair game for capture while </v>

134
00:07:00.351 --> 00:07:04.160
<v Speaker 1>the US insisted it hadn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The crew was tortured and forced to sign</v>

135
00:07:04.161 --> 00:07:04.994
<v Speaker 1>confessions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and North Korea threatened that if the </v>

136
00:07:06.231 --> 00:07:07.064
<v Speaker 1>US didn't give a written apology for </v>
<v Speaker 1>straying into their territory that </v>

137
00:07:09.861 --> 00:07:10.694
<v Speaker 1>killed the crew.</v>
<v Speaker 1>After being stalled and diplomacy for </v>

138
00:07:13.101 --> 00:07:14.870
<v Speaker 1>almost a year,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Gilbert Woodward,</v>

139
00:07:14.900 --> 00:07:15.733
<v Speaker 1>the Army Major General at the time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>signed an agreement that the US was at </v>

140
00:07:18.441 --> 00:07:19.190
<v Speaker 1>fault.</v>

141
00:07:19.190 --> 00:07:21.260
<v Speaker 1>While simultaneously releasing this </v>
<v Speaker 1>remark,</v>

142
00:07:21.860 --> 00:07:24.410
<v Speaker 1>my signature will not and cannot alter </v>
<v Speaker 1>the facts.</v>

143
00:07:24.411 --> 00:07:27.740
<v Speaker 1>I will sign the document to free the </v>
<v Speaker 1>crew and only to free the crew.</v>

144
00:07:27.980 --> 00:07:28.813
<v Speaker 1>This non apology that was signed by </v>
<v Speaker 1>Woodward is a perfect example of how </v>

145
00:07:31.490 --> 00:07:34.310
<v Speaker 1>insincere apology is can sometimes be </v>
<v Speaker 1>the only answer.</v>

146
00:07:34.760 --> 00:07:37.340
<v Speaker 1>The next day the Pueblos crew was </v>
<v Speaker 1>released safely,</v>

147
00:07:38.750 --> 00:07:41.690
<v Speaker 1>but now that we've talked about why </v>
<v Speaker 1>someone might use a non-apology,</v>

148
00:07:41.960 --> 00:07:45.740
<v Speaker 1>how they come off as insincere and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>rare cases where they're needed.</v>

149
00:07:46.040 --> 00:07:48.920
<v Speaker 1>Let's move onto our final example.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Number six.</v>

150
00:07:49.010 --> 00:07:50.510
<v Speaker 1>I'm sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but apologies.</v>

151
00:07:51.470 --> 00:07:52.303
<v Speaker 1>Let's say you're Caitlyn Jenner.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You just ran a 69 year old from behind </v>

152
00:07:55.190 --> 00:07:56.023
<v Speaker 1>with your car,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you're being held accountable for </v>

153
00:07:57.621 --> 00:07:58.970
<v Speaker 1>murder.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How do you get out of it?</v>

154
00:07:59.450 --> 00:08:03.170
<v Speaker 1>This one we're going to play along at </v>
<v Speaker 1>home a say you're sorry.</v>

155
00:08:03.440 --> 00:08:04.273
<v Speaker 1>Be Blaming on the Paparazzi.</v>
<v Speaker 1>See settled the lawsuit with your </v>

156

<v Speaker 1>enormous wealth and don't face jail time</v>
<v Speaker 1>or d,</v>

157

<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

158
00:08:13.561 --> 00:08:15.390
<v Speaker 1>that's right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>To all of you who gets d,</v>

159
00:08:15.391 --> 00:08:16.224
<v Speaker 1>You are correct.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You do it all when you can't totally </v>

160
00:08:19.651 --> 00:08:22.110
<v Speaker 1>dodged the apology.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can say you're sorry,</v>

161
00:08:22.230 --> 00:08:25.710
<v Speaker 1>but that it wasn't all your fault.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is what Caitlyn does.</v>

162
00:08:25.860 --> 00:08:26.693
<v Speaker 1>She says she's sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the Paparazzi were the ones </v>

163
00:08:28.021 --> 00:08:30.870
<v Speaker 1>distracting her and they should also be </v>
<v Speaker 1>held responsible.</v>

164
00:08:31.320 --> 00:08:35.880
<v Speaker 1>She has it all figured out and for the </v>
<v Speaker 1>record she never face jail time.</v>

165
00:08:35.970 --> 00:08:37.620
<v Speaker 1>Totally got away with manslaughter.</v>

166
00:08:41.630 --> 00:08:46.630
<v Speaker 4>He just said manslaughter.</v>

00:09:33.300 --> 00:09:34.133
<v Speaker 1>I also want to discuss with you guys </v>
<v Speaker 1>Patrion I've realized after doing this </v>

180
00:09:37.861 --> 00:09:38.694
<v Speaker 1>channel for a little while,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that that's gonna have to be the main </v>

181
00:09:41.431 --> 00:09:43.860
<v Speaker 1>income source for this channel.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

182
00:09:43.920 --> 00:09:48.480
<v Speaker 1>I just don't release videos fast enough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I prefer quality.</v>

183
00:09:48.481 --> 00:09:52.140
<v Speaker 1>I prefer spending my time on videos,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that's going to be,</v>

184
00:09:52.141 --> 00:09:56.160
<v Speaker 1>have to be the direction of the channel.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you will see more pitches for that.</v>

185
00:09:56.161 --> 00:09:56.994
<v Speaker 1>I apologize if you're annoyed by that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the patrons had that have been </v>

186
00:10:00.001 --> 00:10:00.690
<v Speaker 1>supporting me.</v>

187
00:10:00.690 --> 00:10:03.030
<v Speaker 1>Those guys are the kind of the lifeblood</v>
<v Speaker 1>of this channel.</v>

188
00:10:03.180 --> 00:10:06.360
<v Speaker 1>So I'm pushing more towards that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Along those lines.</v>

189
00:10:06.420 --> 00:10:08.370
<v Speaker 1>I want to change up kind of what we do </v>
<v Speaker 1>with that.</v>

190
00:10:08.371 --> 00:10:10.050
<v Speaker 1>So as you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have two tiers.</v>

191
00:10:10.120 --> 00:10:12.960
<v Speaker 1>Some of you know we have the proletariat</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the bourgeoisie.</v>

192
00:10:13.290 --> 00:10:16.410
<v Speaker 1>Proletarian is $1 a month,</v>
<v Speaker 1>virtually cs $5 a month.</v>

193
00:10:17.220 --> 00:10:18.810
<v Speaker 1>In the past.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I haven't done anything with it.</v>

194
00:10:19.290 --> 00:10:21.720
<v Speaker 1>I want to change that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not exactly sure how I'm going to,</v>

195
00:10:21.721 --> 00:10:22.554
<v Speaker 1>but for now I want to try this.</v>

<v Speaker 1>asking for input on what you'd like to </v>

<v Speaker 1>I need your feedback to know kind of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>direction I want to go with this.</v>

<v Speaker 1>week and then I will be back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think I'm going to do a look back at </v>

206
00:11:02.551 --> 00:11:05.400
<v Speaker 1>one of my first viral videos for the </v>
<v Speaker 1>next one.</v>

207
00:11:05.401 --> 00:11:08.430
<v Speaker 1>Maybe something people got mad at me </v>
