1
00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:03.190
<v Speaker 1>There are 50 slots on the training tab </v>
<v Speaker 1>and when I last checked,</v>

2
00:00:03.191 --> 00:00:05.380
<v Speaker 1>22 of them were taken up by either a </v>
<v Speaker 1>movie trailer,</v>

3
00:00:05.381 --> 00:00:06.420
<v Speaker 1>TV,</v>
<v Speaker 1>late night host,</v>

4
00:00:06.430 --> 00:00:07.263
<v Speaker 1>big brand or TV show.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is ridiculous when you account for </v>

5
00:00:09.731 --> 00:00:10.564
<v Speaker 1>the fact that youtube only has three </v>
<v Speaker 1>main tabs to exploit their entire site </v>

6
00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:16.390
<v Speaker 1>and in one of them about half the </v>
<v Speaker 1>options or TV related,</v>

7
00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:18.820
<v Speaker 1>which means their main product isn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>even on Youtube.</v>

8
00:00:18.821 --> 00:00:21.670
<v Speaker 1>It's just an advertisement to go watch </v>
<v Speaker 1>their show or movie.</v>

9
00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:22.923
<v Speaker 1>So in other words,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the trending tab has become a glorified </v>

10
00:00:25.151 --> 00:00:29.050
<v Speaker 1>TV guide.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This problem isn't new.</v>

11
00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:32.530
<v Speaker 1>Trending has been frustrating you tubers</v>
<v Speaker 1>since 2015 you see,</v>

12
00:00:32.531 --> 00:00:33.364
<v Speaker 1>it all started when youtube released a </v>
<v Speaker 1>cryptic statement about what kind of </v>

13
00:00:35.891 --> 00:00:38.320
<v Speaker 1>videos would be featured.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some trends are predictable,</v>

14
00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:40.960
<v Speaker 1>like a new song from a popular artist or</v>
<v Speaker 1>a new movie trailer.</v>

15
00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:43.120
<v Speaker 1>Others are surprising like a viral </v>
<v Speaker 1>video.</v>

16
00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:44.193
<v Speaker 1>We aim to surface videos that a wide </v>
<v Speaker 1>range of viewers will find interesting </v>

17
00:00:46.661 --> 00:00:48.280
<v Speaker 1>and novel.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now this guy,</v>

18
00:00:48.281 --> 00:00:51.790
<v Speaker 1>people excited because it seemed like a </v>
<v Speaker 1>great way to feature new viral creators,</v>

19
00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:54.580
<v Speaker 1>but that's not really what happened in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the end.</v>

20
00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:55.443
<v Speaker 1>It's led to a stagnant,</v>
<v Speaker 1>predictable system where every day it </v>

21
00:00:57.161 --> 00:00:57.994
<v Speaker 1>seems like a Mashup of John Oliver meets</v>
<v Speaker 1>buzzfeed glue dominated by videos that </v>

22
00:01:01.421 --> 00:01:03.370
<v Speaker 1>have lots of marketing resources behind </v>
<v Speaker 1>them,</v>

23
00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:05.680
<v Speaker 1>whether that be business insider,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the NFL,</v>

24
00:01:05.681 --> 00:01:06.820
<v Speaker 1>snl,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what the hell?</v>

25
00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:09.070
<v Speaker 1>Oh wait,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's Casey Neistat on trending again.</v>

26
00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:12.910
<v Speaker 1>But he sponsored by CNN so it's okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And why is this happening?</v>

27
00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:14.193
<v Speaker 1>Is there a conspiracy where youtube </v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to promote big budget movies or </v>

28
00:01:16.691 --> 00:01:18.190
<v Speaker 1>TV shows?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think so,</v>

29
00:01:18.191 --> 00:01:20.800
<v Speaker 1>but whenever you rely on an algorithm to</v>
<v Speaker 1>sort things,</v>

30
00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:24.370
<v Speaker 1>people are going to find a way to </v>
<v Speaker 1>exploit an optimize for that algorithm.</v>

31
00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:25.533
<v Speaker 1>When Youtube started the training tab,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they knew they didn't want already big </v>

32
00:01:27.731 --> 00:01:28.564
<v Speaker 1>youtubers dominating the space everyday </v>
<v Speaker 1>with their videos to consistently got </v>

33
00:01:31.001 --> 00:01:32.710
<v Speaker 1>millions of views and that makes sense.</v>

34
00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:35.290
<v Speaker 1>PD Pie on training everyday would get </v>
<v Speaker 1>super old,</v>

35
00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:39.130
<v Speaker 1>but how do you find viral videos when </v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't use view count as an indicator</v>

36
00:01:39.131 --> 00:01:40.360
<v Speaker 1>of our rally?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

37
00:01:40.361 --> 00:01:41.194
<v Speaker 1>youtube solution was to base who gets on</v>
<v Speaker 1>the training tab on a variety of </v>

38
00:01:43.331 --> 00:01:44.164
<v Speaker 1>factors.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How vast is the video growing where the </v>

39
00:01:45.911 --> 00:01:48.160
<v Speaker 1>view is coming from geographically,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but most of all,</v>

40
00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:49.023
<v Speaker 1>where's the traffic being driven from?</v>
<v Speaker 1>This last factor is really important </v>

41
00:01:52.061 --> 00:01:52.894
<v Speaker 1>because it explains how the Time Warner </v>
<v Speaker 1>Tab came to be because if your main way </v>

42
00:01:56.621 --> 00:01:57.454
<v Speaker 1>to push content is through youtube,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not considered viral by youtube </v>

43
00:02:00.431 --> 00:02:01.264
<v Speaker 1>because all your traffic is internal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if you're someone like Jimmy Kimmel </v>

44
00:02:03.641 --> 00:02:06.370
<v Speaker 1>and people love to share your crime </v>
<v Speaker 1>monologues across twitter,</v>

45
00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:07.413
<v Speaker 1>then your video is going to hit the </v>
<v Speaker 1>training page because the views from </v>

46
00:02:09.131 --> 00:02:09.964
<v Speaker 1>twitter account,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it is more valuable because it's coming </v>

47
00:02:11.111 --> 00:02:13.690
<v Speaker 1>from across platforms.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is why buzzfeed,</v>

48
00:02:13.691 --> 00:02:14.960
<v Speaker 1>Gopro,</v>
<v Speaker 1>business insider,</v>

49
00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:15.813
<v Speaker 1>big brands hit the trending page so </v>
<v Speaker 1>often because they have huge marketing </v>

50
00:02:18.641 --> 00:02:21.160
<v Speaker 1>teams that spread their content across </v>
<v Speaker 1>all the platforms.</v>

51
00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:24.130
<v Speaker 1>While independent youtube creators tend </v>
<v Speaker 1>to focus on youtube.</v>

52
00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:29.470
<v Speaker 1>I want to talk for a moment why having </v>
<v Speaker 1>this system this way is a bad thing.</v>

53
00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:30.693
<v Speaker 1>First,</v>
<v Speaker 1>youtube is not great because it houses </v>

54
00:02:32.381 --> 00:02:35.830
<v Speaker 1>the highlights of TV.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Youtube is great because it isn't tv,</v>

55
00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:36.933
<v Speaker 1>it isn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or at least wasn't dominated by big </v>

56
00:02:38.711 --> 00:02:39.544
<v Speaker 1>corporations.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was governed by a meritocracy of </v>

57
00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:42.970
<v Speaker 1>independent creators.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

58
00:02:42.971 --> 00:02:45.880
<v Speaker 1>the whole reason for you dupes </v>
<v Speaker 1>popularity is thanks to these people.</v>

59
00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:46.983
<v Speaker 1>So when Youtube makes one of the key </v>
<v Speaker 1>navigation options of their website </v>

60
00:02:49.481 --> 00:02:50.314
<v Speaker 1>accessible to a small minority of </v>
<v Speaker 1>youtubers and to a large majority of </v>

61
00:02:53.291 --> 00:02:57.280
<v Speaker 1>advertisers in TV influencers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it seems like a bad move and a step away</v>

62
00:02:57.281 --> 00:02:59.980
<v Speaker 1>from who they are at their core.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And in a weird way,</v>

63
00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:00.903
<v Speaker 1>I'd prefer one of youtube own clickbait </v>
<v Speaker 1>monsters getting featured over going </v>

64
00:03:04.001 --> 00:03:04.834
<v Speaker 1>back to the same tv culture ever cycled </v>
<v Speaker 1>over polished stuff that I could watch </v>

65
00:03:07.481 --> 00:03:08.314
<v Speaker 1>on the TV.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I no longer pay for it because the </v>

66
00:03:09.101 --> 00:03:09.934
<v Speaker 1>Internet is better.</v>

67
00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:12.810
<v Speaker 2>How was Nebraska better than North </v>
<v Speaker 2>Dakota?</v>

68
00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:20.860
<v Speaker 2>Hi,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that Chuck's only funny in Nebraska?</v>

69
00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:26.990
<v Speaker 2>My joke is not funny here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

70
00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:30.020
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I really don't believe this.</v>

71
00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:31.283
<v Speaker 1>Second,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it isn't like we don't know where to </v>

72
00:03:32.251 --> 00:03:34.560
<v Speaker 1>find these brands or TV shows.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If we wanted to watch them,</v>

73
00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:37.860
<v Speaker 1>why shoved them down my throat?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I already know who Seth Meyer is.</v>

74
00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:41.300
<v Speaker 1>Why not show someone who's blowing up on</v>
<v Speaker 1>youtube that I haven't heard of?</v>

75
00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:42.811
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in a way,</v>

76
00:03:42.811 --> 00:03:43.644
<v Speaker 1>it's kind of ironic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The trending tab was designed not to </v>

77
00:03:45.571 --> 00:03:47.970
<v Speaker 1>over promote the already huge channels </v>
<v Speaker 1>and youtube,</v>

78
00:03:47.971 --> 00:03:51.750
<v Speaker 1>but it ended up doing exactly that only </v>
<v Speaker 1>instead of promoting their own,</v>

79
00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:52.613
<v Speaker 1>they're over promoting the very media </v>
<v Speaker 1>structures that they replaced a decade </v>

80
00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:57.300
<v Speaker 1>ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And before you say,</v>

81
00:03:57.330 --> 00:03:59.010
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what about creator on the rise?</v>

82
00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:02.010
<v Speaker 1>And that is a start,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but consider this.</v>

83
00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:04.920
<v Speaker 1>There are 2 million people eligible to </v>
<v Speaker 1>be a creator on the rise,</v>

84
00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:07.290
<v Speaker 1>which means that every day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you were dealt a hand of cards,</v>

85
00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:08.483
<v Speaker 1>you draw a royal flush three times </v>
<v Speaker 1>before you got featured on the creator </v>

86
00:04:10.861 --> 00:04:11.700
<v Speaker 1>on the rise page.</v>

87
00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:13.013
<v Speaker 1>It's a gesture that looks good,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's pretty meaningless now given </v>

88
00:04:15.661 --> 00:04:18.810
<v Speaker 1>you tube's incredible track record of </v>
<v Speaker 1>listening to creators,</v>

89
00:04:19.020 --> 00:04:21.120
<v Speaker 1>I don't think this is going to change </v>
<v Speaker 1>anytime soon.</v>

90
00:04:21.270 --> 00:04:22.103
<v Speaker 1>So it might be worth saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're a utuber and you ever want a </v>

91
00:04:24.121 --> 00:04:24.954
<v Speaker 1>shot at hitting the TV guide of Youtube,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you might want to focus on diversifying </v>

92
00:04:28.051 --> 00:04:31.800
<v Speaker 1>where your views come from because being</v>
<v Speaker 1>successful on youtube isn't enough.</v>

93
00:04:31.801 --> 00:04:34.140
<v Speaker 1>You've got to have a large audience off </v>
<v Speaker 1>youtube,</v>

94
00:04:34.170 --> 00:04:37.560
<v Speaker 1>which is a lot easier to do when your </v>
<v Speaker 1>main product isn't youtube.</v>

95
00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:39.990
<v Speaker 1>So in the spirit of that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you like this video,</v>

96
00:04:39.991 --> 00:04:43.650
<v Speaker 1>you can help my channel by liking my </v>
<v Speaker 1>twitter page and my facebook page linked</v>

97
00:04:43.651 --> 00:04:46.410
<v Speaker 1>in the description below and retweet and</v>
<v Speaker 1>share this video.</v>

98
00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:49.980
<v Speaker 1>If enough people watch and share this </v>
<v Speaker 1>video from other social media sites,</v>

99
00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:50.993
<v Speaker 1>who knows,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we might just end up on the training </v>

100
00:04:51.901 --> 00:04:53.430
<v Speaker 1>page,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but probably not.</v>

101
00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:55.980
<v Speaker 1>I need my CNN sponsorship to come in </v>
<v Speaker 1>first.</v>
