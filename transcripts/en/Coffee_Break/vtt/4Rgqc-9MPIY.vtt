00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:01.163
<v Speaker 1>If you're like me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you assume the rest of the world </v>

2
00:00:02.641 --> 00:00:03.474
<v Speaker 1>revolves around you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but every now and then I'll pop my head </v>

3
00:00:05.191 --> 00:00:08.040
<v Speaker 1>out of the sand to try to take stock of </v>
<v Speaker 1>what's going on outside of my world,</v>

4
00:00:08.070 --> 00:00:08.903
<v Speaker 1>America and English speaking youtube,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's a good time to start paying </v>

5
00:00:12.001 --> 00:00:12.834
<v Speaker 1>attention because some of the new </v>
<v Speaker 1>biggest channels in the world are </v>

6
00:00:14.911 --> 00:00:17.610
<v Speaker 1>building their audiences totally outside</v>
<v Speaker 1>of Western countries,</v>

7
00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:19.770
<v Speaker 1>which means you probably haven't heard </v>
<v Speaker 1>of them yet.</v>

8
00:00:20.370 --> 00:00:23.850
<v Speaker 1>And the one we're going to pay attention</v>
<v Speaker 1>to today is t series from India.</v>

9
00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:28.470
<v Speaker 1>T series is growing so fast they're set </v>
<v Speaker 1>to pass pewdie pie in subscriber numbers</v>

10
00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:29.483
<v Speaker 1>in fewer than six months.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're going to talk about why and how t </v>

11
00:00:32.461 --> 00:00:34.410
<v Speaker 1>series got to the top.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Was it luck,</v>

12
00:00:34.411 --> 00:00:35.490
<v Speaker 1>timing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fortune.</v>

13
00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:37.350
<v Speaker 1>We're going to talk all of that and </v>
<v Speaker 1>more,</v>

14
00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:40.410
<v Speaker 1>but before we get into how t series shot</v>
<v Speaker 1>up the youtube ladder,</v>

15
00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:42.030
<v Speaker 1>let's give it a little bit of </v>
<v Speaker 1>background.</v>

16
00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:44.880
<v Speaker 1>T series is a bollywood music production</v>
<v Speaker 1>company started by gold,</v>

17
00:00:44.881 --> 00:00:45.714
<v Speaker 1>Sean Kumar.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They originally sold bootleg bollywood </v>

18
00:00:47.821 --> 00:00:49.620
<v Speaker 1>songs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but after some smart moves,</v>

19
00:00:49.621 --> 00:00:53.190
<v Speaker 1>explosive growth and their founder being</v>
<v Speaker 1>assassinated by the Mumbai underworld,</v>

20
00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:55.950
<v Speaker 1>they emerged on top in the Bollywood </v>
<v Speaker 1>music scene,</v>

21
00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:56.813
<v Speaker 1>especially on youtube where they're the </v>
<v Speaker 1>second largest channel in the world </v>

22
00:00:59.521 --> 00:01:00.354
<v Speaker 1>right now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but let's make that more tangible with </v>

23
00:01:02.101 --> 00:01:02.934
<v Speaker 1>numbers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>PD Pie is set to grow by 9 million </v>

24
00:01:05.101 --> 00:01:08.880
<v Speaker 1>subscribers this year.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In that same time period t series,</v>

25
00:01:08.881 --> 00:01:09.714
<v Speaker 1>we'll get 38 million subscribers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>To give you more context for how fast </v>

26
00:01:14.311 --> 00:01:15.144
<v Speaker 1>that growth is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are only three channels in the </v>

27
00:01:17.011 --> 00:01:17.844
<v Speaker 1>world with more than 38 million </v>
<v Speaker 1>subscribers total and they're going to </v>

28
00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:25.230
<v Speaker 1>gain that many subscribers in one year </v>
<v Speaker 1>according to growth trends.</v>

29
00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:28.890
<v Speaker 1>At first glance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this growth is completely baffling.</v>

30
00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:31.800
<v Speaker 1>How is this possible?</v>
<v Speaker 1>At this point,</v>

31
00:01:31.801 --> 00:01:34.410
<v Speaker 1>I'm just going to show you a few of </v>
<v Speaker 1>their videos to give you a flavor of the</v>

32
00:01:34.411 --> 00:01:35.520
<v Speaker 1>kind of work that they do.</v>

33
00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:36.493
<v Speaker 2>Hi.</v>

34
00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:49.753
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's good,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but good content doesn't explain the </v>

35
00:01:52.791 --> 00:01:53.624
<v Speaker 1>full picture.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are tons of good music video </v>

36
00:01:55.281 --> 00:01:57.200
<v Speaker 1>channels that aren't growing nearly this</v>
<v Speaker 1>fast.</v>

37
00:01:57.650 --> 00:02:00.110
<v Speaker 1>So what else is going on here?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

38
00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:02.660
<v Speaker 1>it's ironic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The same thing that helped a cutie pie,</v>

39
00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:03.523
<v Speaker 1>the youtube king get to where he is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is now what is creating the new king of </v>

40
00:02:06.921 --> 00:02:09.320
<v Speaker 1>Youtube.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It comes down to two factors.</v>

41
00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:13.880
<v Speaker 1>These factors are geographic opportunity</v>
<v Speaker 1>and content ecosystems.</v>

42
00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:18.410
<v Speaker 1>Let's start with geographic opportunity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Five years ago,</v>

43
00:02:18.411 --> 00:02:19.244
<v Speaker 1>Matt Pat made a video called how Pewdie </v>
<v Speaker 1>pie conquered youtube and in it he </v>

44
00:02:21.981 --> 00:02:25.790
<v Speaker 1>argued Qd by had a unique advantage </v>
<v Speaker 1>based on where he was from.</v>

45
00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:27.403
<v Speaker 1>Basically Pewdie Pie was able to draw </v>
<v Speaker 1>from a larger audience pulled in his </v>

46
00:02:29.931 --> 00:02:30.764
<v Speaker 1>contemporaries,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which gave him the geographic </v>

47
00:02:32.571 --> 00:02:33.404
<v Speaker 1>opportunity to get ahead.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Today the place to be if you want </v>

48
00:02:36.171 --> 00:02:39.440
<v Speaker 1>geographic opportunity in the largest </v>
<v Speaker 1>audience is India.</v>

49
00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:46.160
<v Speaker 1>India has always had a huge population,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what held India back in the past was</v>

50
00:02:46.161 --> 00:02:49.550
<v Speaker 1>having bad or no Internet connection.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But recently,</v>

51
00:02:49.551 --> 00:02:53.270
<v Speaker 1>especially in the last decade,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this has been radically changing.</v>

52
00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:55.340
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to bore you with too many </v>
<v Speaker 1>numbers,</v>

53
00:02:55.341 --> 00:02:57.710
<v Speaker 1>but India has been coming online </v>
<v Speaker 1>rapidly.</v>

54
00:02:58.010 --> 00:02:58.843
<v Speaker 1>To illustrate this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a metric called Internet </v>

55
00:03:00.311 --> 00:03:01.144
<v Speaker 1>penetration,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which just measures the percentage of </v>

56
00:03:02.471 --> 00:03:04.570
<v Speaker 1>the country using the Internet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Simple,</v>

57
00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:08.560
<v Speaker 1>so to get a baseline here are the last </v>
<v Speaker 1>two decades in the US,</v>

58
00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:09.603
<v Speaker 1>pretty stagnant and nearly everyone who </v>
<v Speaker 1>wants to be on the Internet is on the </v>

59
00:03:12.281 --> 00:03:13.114
<v Speaker 1>Internet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now compare this with the last two </v>

60
00:03:14.861 --> 00:03:17.260
<v Speaker 1>decades of Internet penetration in </v>
<v Speaker 1>India.</v>

61
00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:22.150
<v Speaker 1>It's pretty staggering and as far as </v>
<v Speaker 1>absolute number of Internet users,</v>

62
00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:26.740
<v Speaker 1>India is already well past the u s and </v>
<v Speaker 1>Europe and is only behind China in total</v>

63
00:03:26.741 --> 00:03:27.574
<v Speaker 1>users,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's despite the fact that they </v>

64
00:03:29.471 --> 00:03:30.970
<v Speaker 1>still have a long way to grow.</v>

65
00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:32.043
<v Speaker 1>Having only reached 30% penetration </v>
<v Speaker 1>compared to the 80% of most modern </v>

66
00:03:35.201 --> 00:03:36.034
<v Speaker 1>countries and leaving the geopolitical </v>
<v Speaker 1>implications of this aside for a moment </v>

67
00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:42.160
<v Speaker 1>on youtube,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this means only one thing.</v>

68
00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:43.353
<v Speaker 1>Holy Cow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are a lot of people looking for </v>

69
00:03:45.581 --> 00:03:50.380
<v Speaker 1>content in India and more new users log </v>
<v Speaker 1>on every single day.</v>

70
00:03:50.710 --> 00:03:53.140
<v Speaker 1>Let's do the math.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Exponential audience size,</v>

71
00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:56.680
<v Speaker 1>hungry for content.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who is the biggest channel in India?</v>

72
00:03:56.681 --> 00:04:00.010
<v Speaker 1>Ready to give the people what they want?</v>
<v Speaker 1>T series.</v>

73
00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:03.700
<v Speaker 1>They're soaking up all those new users </v>
<v Speaker 1>like a sponge,</v>

74
00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:05.133
<v Speaker 1>but as if that wasn't enough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Teasers has one other advantage that </v>

75
00:04:07.121 --> 00:04:10.720
<v Speaker 1>seals the coffin for the borough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pewdie pie and just the rest of Youtube.</v>

76
00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:16.410
<v Speaker 1>The India content ecosystem is young and</v>
<v Speaker 1>because of that competition is weaker in</v>

77
00:04:17.441 --> 00:04:18.850
<v Speaker 1>America.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You may not realize it,</v>

78
00:04:18.851 --> 00:04:21.430
<v Speaker 1>but we have a pretty mature content </v>
<v Speaker 1>ecosystem.</v>

79
00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:24.940
<v Speaker 1>What I mean by that is while in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>beginning things were like the wild west</v>

80
00:04:24.941 --> 00:04:25.774
<v Speaker 1>on Youtube,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the environment has grown with its </v>

81
00:04:27.311 --> 00:04:28.144
<v Speaker 1>creators.</v>

82
00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:30.850
<v Speaker 1>We've had people creating fulltime for a</v>
<v Speaker 1>while now.</v>

83
00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:33.640
<v Speaker 1>We've had a large companies use youtube </v>
<v Speaker 1>for success.</v>

84
00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:37.630
<v Speaker 1>We've even had a generation of creators </v>
<v Speaker 1>like me who grew up watching youtube.</v>

85
00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:40.360
<v Speaker 1>Everyone's just had time to learn and </v>
<v Speaker 1>adapt.</v>

86
00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:41.463
<v Speaker 1>This is a great thing for content.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It means there's more content than ever </v>

87
00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:45.700
<v Speaker 1>and it's better than ever generally </v>
<v Speaker 1>speaking,</v>

88
00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:50.110
<v Speaker 1>but it also means that competition for </v>
<v Speaker 1>your eyeballs is fiercer than ever.</v>

89
00:04:50.111 --> 00:04:50.944
<v Speaker 1>In America and Europe today,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have plenty of established channels </v>

90
00:04:53.741 --> 00:04:56.890
<v Speaker 1>with professional budgets all competing </v>
<v Speaker 1>with one another.</v>

91
00:04:57.220 --> 00:04:58.053
<v Speaker 1>This makes it hard to cut through and to</v>
<v Speaker 1>really stand out even for the biggest </v>

92
00:05:01.031 --> 00:05:04.390
<v Speaker 1>and best channels.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is also why people who start gaming</v>

93
00:05:04.391 --> 00:05:07.720
<v Speaker 1>channels today have no chance of </v>
<v Speaker 1>becoming as big as purity clyde.</v>

94
00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:10.900
<v Speaker 1>He did it when the John was new young,</v>
<v Speaker 1>an undefined,</v>

95
00:05:11.290 --> 00:05:13.690
<v Speaker 1>don't get me wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 1>someone can still succeed on youtube,</v>

96
00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:17.350
<v Speaker 1>but being first to market is always a </v>
<v Speaker 1>unique advantage.</v>

97
00:05:17.590 --> 00:05:18.423
<v Speaker 1>If pewdie pie started today,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he'd be just one of a thousand similar </v>

98
00:05:21.041 --> 00:05:21.874
<v Speaker 1>personalities all shouting for the same </v>
<v Speaker 1>breathing room and just contrast this </v>

99
00:05:25.181 --> 00:05:26.014
<v Speaker 1>with India where new creators are just </v>
<v Speaker 1>starting to take advantage of the huge </v>

100
00:05:29.621 --> 00:05:30.454
<v Speaker 1>opportunity over there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Most of the audience and the creators </v>

101
00:05:33.101 --> 00:05:35.530
<v Speaker 1>have only recently gotten Internet </v>
<v Speaker 1>access,</v>

102
00:05:36.100 --> 00:05:36.933
<v Speaker 1>which means that India is youtube </v>
<v Speaker 1>content environment is at minimum </v>

103
00:05:39.461 --> 00:05:41.890
<v Speaker 1>several years younger than most </v>
<v Speaker 1>developed countries.</v>

104
00:05:42.640 --> 00:05:43.473
<v Speaker 1>This has created a unique moment for </v>
<v Speaker 1>professional operationally t series who </v>

105
00:05:46.571 --> 00:05:51.010
<v Speaker 1>can afford to mass produce big budget </v>
<v Speaker 1>music videos to dominate the competition</v>

106
00:05:51.011 --> 00:05:53.770
<v Speaker 1>and grab the market share before anyone </v>
<v Speaker 1>else gets there.</v>

107
00:05:55.330 --> 00:05:58.310
<v Speaker 1>Now I know what you're thinking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What about elephant in the room?</v>

108
00:05:58.420 --> 00:05:59.560
<v Speaker 3>China,</v>
<v Speaker 3>China,</v>

109
00:05:59.561 --> 00:06:00.970
<v Speaker 3>China,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because China,</v>

110
00:06:01.930 --> 00:06:04.900
<v Speaker 1>you would think all these factors apply </v>
<v Speaker 1>equally to them as well.</v>

111
00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:08.020
<v Speaker 1>Why aren't we seeing the t series of </v>
<v Speaker 1>China after all?</v>

112
00:06:08.021 --> 00:06:11.380
<v Speaker 1>They have just as large of a population.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're actually ahead of India in their</v>

113
00:06:11.381 --> 00:06:12.214
<v Speaker 1>technological boom,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which means a larger potential audience </v>

114
00:06:14.321 --> 00:06:16.030
<v Speaker 1>size.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's holding them back?</v>

115
00:06:16.390 --> 00:06:19.030
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>China is the story of what might've been</v>

116
00:06:19.060 --> 00:06:21.520
<v Speaker 1>except for a little something called the</v>
<v Speaker 1>Great Wall of China,</v>

117
00:06:22.060 --> 00:06:22.893
<v Speaker 1>the great firewall it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You may have heard the Chinese </v>

118
00:06:25.151 --> 00:06:28.780
<v Speaker 1>government sensors the Internet and </v>
<v Speaker 1>starting from the 2008 rights in Tibet.</v>

119
00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:29.793
<v Speaker 1>One website they blocked is youtube.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So while China has their own youtube </v>

120
00:06:33.161 --> 00:06:36.130
<v Speaker 1>called [inaudible],</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is a totally original title,</v>

121
00:06:36.430 --> 00:06:37.263
<v Speaker 1>it's mostly a national brand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So for now at least it looks like </v>

122
00:06:39.521 --> 00:06:40.354
<v Speaker 1>India's friendliness towards </v>
<v Speaker 1>globalization will make it a stronger </v>

123
00:06:42.281 --> 00:06:43.114
<v Speaker 1>competitor in worldwide entertainment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>While China's nationalist policies have </v>

124
00:06:46.421 --> 00:06:47.980
<v Speaker 1>meant that national brands like you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cool,</v>

125
00:06:47.981 --> 00:06:50.140
<v Speaker 1>we'll succeed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is an interesting trade off.</v>

126
00:06:50.530 --> 00:06:53.140
<v Speaker 1>China prevents their population from </v>
<v Speaker 1>engaging with global,</v>

127
00:06:53.141 --> 00:06:53.974
<v Speaker 1>sometimes better products,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but in turn it gives their local </v>

128
00:06:56.321 --> 00:06:58.900
<v Speaker 1>companies that normally would have been </v>
<v Speaker 1>out competed a long time ago.</v>

129
00:06:58.910 --> 00:07:00.850
<v Speaker 1>The chance to grow into huge </v>
<v Speaker 1>corporations,</v>

130
00:07:00.851 --> 00:07:03.490
<v Speaker 1>which can fight on the world stage for </v>
<v Speaker 1>influence,</v>

131
00:07:03.640 --> 00:07:04.473
<v Speaker 1>but it's hard to tell how successful any</v>
<v Speaker 1>of their creators have been since </v>

132
00:07:06.971 --> 00:07:09.640
<v Speaker 1>they're not playing on the same field as</v>
<v Speaker 1>any other country.</v>

133
00:07:09.760 --> 00:07:12.610
<v Speaker 1>You really can't compare numbers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you don't go to the Olympics,</v>

134
00:07:12.611 --> 00:07:15.760
<v Speaker 1>you can't win a medal no matter how many</v>
<v Speaker 1>people you have banging your drops.</v>

135
00:07:16.630 --> 00:07:19.720
<v Speaker 1>So to summarize this video,</v>
<v Speaker 1>China's playing by themselves insulating</v>

136
00:07:19.721 --> 00:07:20.554
<v Speaker 1>their internet platform so that it can </v>
<v Speaker 1>survive and grow while any is choosing </v>

137
00:07:23.231 --> 00:07:24.064
<v Speaker 1>to leverage its huge population to </v>
<v Speaker 1>participate in the larger community and </v>

138
00:07:27.281 --> 00:07:30.730
<v Speaker 1>with its technological boom only getting</v>
<v Speaker 1>started soon.</v>

139
00:07:30.731 --> 00:07:33.700
<v Speaker 1>India will be a major player in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>youtube ecosystem.</v>

140
00:07:34.030 --> 00:07:36.280
<v Speaker 1>It looks like Bollywood Music is here to</v>
<v Speaker 1>stay,</v>

141
00:07:36.610 --> 00:07:39.820
<v Speaker 1>which is cool with me because have you </v>
<v Speaker 1>ever seen a bollywood movie?</v>

142
00:07:40.240 --> 00:07:44.680

<v Speaker 1>ass Uri that breaks the Badass meter and</v>

143
00:07:44.681 --> 00:07:48.070
<v Speaker 1>turns into comedy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is hilariously amazing.</v>

144
00:07:48.520 --> 00:07:49.353
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll just outro with the future of </v>

154
