1
00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:01.073
<v Speaker 1>Right off the bat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's dispense with the whole </v>

2
00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:05.060
<v Speaker 1>objectivity thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No one's always write objectively,</v>

3
00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:08.820
<v Speaker 1>but you can use tricks and sophistry </v>
<v Speaker 1>when logic and facts aren't on your side</v>

4
00:00:08.821 --> 00:00:13.080
<v Speaker 1>to always be right in an argument.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The whole goal here is to try to win.</v>

5
00:00:13.081 --> 00:00:13.914
<v Speaker 1>It's an intellectual war.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Air Go all is fair in love and </v>

6
00:00:15.781 --> 00:00:18.060
<v Speaker 1>arguments.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think Sun Tzu said that once.</v>

7
00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:19.223
<v Speaker 1>This is going to be an abridged list of </v>
<v Speaker 1>dirty little tricks taken from Archer </v>

8
00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:22.710
<v Speaker 1>Schopenhauer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his book,</v>

9
00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:23.543
<v Speaker 1>the art of being right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The full book and audio book is linked </v>

10
00:00:26.011 --> 00:00:27.660
<v Speaker 1>below.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've just picked my favorites.</v>

11
00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:30.450
<v Speaker 1>Let's get into it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>First postulate.</v>

12
00:00:30.451 --> 00:00:31.284
<v Speaker 1>What has to be proved.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is where you bring up a conclusion </v>

13
00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:37.260
<v Speaker 1>as if it were a premise.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's also known as begging the question.</v>

14
00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:38.333
<v Speaker 1>Here's an example.</v>

15
00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:39.513
<v Speaker 2>I began this campaign because I was so </v>
<v Speaker 2>tired of seeing such foolish things </v>

16
00:00:44.771 --> 00:00:45.730
<v Speaker 2>happen to our country.</v>

17
00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:47.113
<v Speaker 1>Notice how he says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the reason I began this campaign is </v>

18
00:00:49.311 --> 00:00:52.880
<v Speaker 1>because the country was doing so poorly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He never proves how the country is doing</v>

19
00:00:52.881 --> 00:00:56.600
<v Speaker 1>poorly or why it's doing poorly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He states it as a matter of fact,</v>

20
00:00:56.690 --> 00:00:59.630
<v Speaker 1>upfront postulate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What has to be proved.</v>

21
00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:02.150
<v Speaker 1>This is a great way to sneak your point </v>
<v Speaker 1>past the goalposts.</v>

22
00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:04.250
<v Speaker 1>Next,</v>
<v Speaker 1>choose your definitions.</v>

23
00:01:04.370 --> 00:01:06.470
<v Speaker 1>This works best at the start of an </v>
<v Speaker 1>argument.</v>

24
00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:10.100
<v Speaker 1>If you want to control the conversation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>try to control the definitions,</v>

25
00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:13.760
<v Speaker 1>what someone might call extremism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Another person might call passion,</v>

26
00:01:13.761 --> 00:01:14.594
<v Speaker 1>what some call a right to assembly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Others might call it disrespectful or </v>

27
00:01:17.421 --> 00:01:20.180
<v Speaker 1>disruptive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here's an example from a recent debate.</v>

28
00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:21.373
<v Speaker 1>Pay attention to how much time is spent </v>
<v Speaker 1>framing the other person's position and </v>

29
00:01:25.401 --> 00:01:29.150
<v Speaker 1>conversely how much the other one fights</v>
<v Speaker 1>against this framing.</v>

30
00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:30.373
<v Speaker 1>They both know that the words you use to</v>
<v Speaker 1>define the other person's position is </v>

31
00:01:33.741 --> 00:01:36.850
<v Speaker 1>everything he ran as a socialist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>an honor leaders,</v>

32
00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:37.703
<v Speaker 1>socialists dollar randoms,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it independent and sort of being </v>

33
00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:40.633
<v Speaker 1>independent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The history of the United States called </v>

34
00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:43.930
<v Speaker 1>are you a socialist or not?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I am a democratic social.</v>

35
00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:46.780
<v Speaker 1>Okay folks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but don't tell him I didn't run as often</v>

36
00:01:46.781 --> 00:01:48.680
<v Speaker 1>as I ran to me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you told people you were socialists</v>

37
00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:50.360
<v Speaker 1>fun runners,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a right winger,</v>

38
00:01:50.361 --> 00:01:51.650
<v Speaker 1>you ran as a Republican,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

39
00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:56.400
<v Speaker 3>I am happily up and I am happily</v>

40
00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:02.390
<v Speaker 1>frame the conversation in your way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No matter if you're talking about gender</v>

41
00:02:02.391 --> 00:02:05.390
<v Speaker 1>or unemployment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how you define it is everything.</v>

42
00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:07.670
<v Speaker 1>Number three,</v>
<v Speaker 1>persuade the audience,</v>

43
00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:10.160
<v Speaker 1>not the opponent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're in front of an audience,</v>

44
00:02:10.161 --> 00:02:10.994
<v Speaker 1>tactically,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't matter if the person to your </v>

45
00:02:12.471 --> 00:02:14.540
<v Speaker 1>left or right agrees with you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Only the crowd.</v>

46
00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:16.820
<v Speaker 1>This is pretty easy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the quip,</v>

47
00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:18.800
<v Speaker 1>the one liner.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whatever gets the laugh.</v>

48
00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:21.980
<v Speaker 1>The most important thing to remember </v>
<v Speaker 1>here is the audience isn't just there to</v>

49
00:02:21.981 --> 00:02:24.410
<v Speaker 1>see who objectively wins.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a spectacle.</v>

50
00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:27.590
<v Speaker 1>They want to laugh.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They want to see who looks more composed</v>

51
00:02:27.591 --> 00:02:28.424
<v Speaker 1>under the lights.</v>

52
00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:30.313
<v Speaker 2>I have as much spirits in the congress </v>
<v Speaker 2>as Jack Kennedy did when he sought the </v>

53
00:02:34.821 --> 00:02:37.130
<v Speaker 2>presidency.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Senator,</v>

54
00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:42.850
<v Speaker 2>I served with Jack Kennedy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I knew Jackie Kennedy Sanitary.</v>

55
00:02:42.851 --> 00:02:44.090
<v Speaker 2>You got to know Jack Kennedy.</v>

56
00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:53.210
<v Speaker 4>If you notice it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's</v>

57
00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:55.230
<v Speaker 1>the opponent seems to wither after this </v>
<v Speaker 1>mine,</v>

58
00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:59.130
<v Speaker 1>but he really didn't say much at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Number four,</v>

59
00:02:59.140 --> 00:02:59.973
<v Speaker 1>the Kafka trap.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is a particularly rude trick frame </v>

60
00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:06.280
<v Speaker 1>and accusations such that the denial is </v>
<v Speaker 1>only further evidence of guilt.</v>

61
00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:09.940
<v Speaker 1>Think the red scare or witch hunts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you accuse someone of something and</v>

62
00:03:09.941 --> 00:03:10.960
<v Speaker 1>they refuse it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just say,</v>

63
00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:13.090
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what someone like that would say.</v>

64
00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:15.450
<v Speaker 1>Here's an example from monty python.</v>

65
00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:22.400
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>nice.</v>

66
00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:34.320
<v Speaker 1>If you deny it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you did it.</v>

67
00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:37.950
<v Speaker 1>That's a Kafka trip.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Five arguments ad homonym.</v>

68
00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:39.113
<v Speaker 1>If all else fails you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Personal attacks are always a great </v>

69
00:03:40.711 --> 00:03:43.050
<v Speaker 1>diversion to get off a particular point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're losing.</v>

70
00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:44.910
<v Speaker 1>The examples here are endless.</v>

71
00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:46.173
<v Speaker 6>I think we can have a rational political</v>
<v Speaker 6>conversation about balancing rights and </v>

72
00:03:49.781 --> 00:03:52.300
<v Speaker 6>risks and rewards of all of these </v>
<v Speaker 6>different policies,</v>

73
00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:54.810
<v Speaker 6>but I don't think that what we need to </v>
<v Speaker 6>do is demonized.</v>

74
00:03:54.811 --> 00:03:57.610
<v Speaker 6>People on the other side is as being </v>
<v Speaker 6>unfeeling about the,</v>

75
00:03:57.630 --> 00:03:58.463
<v Speaker 6>about what happened in San Antonio.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You accuse me of standing on the graves </v>

76
00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:03.850
<v Speaker 6>of the children that die that day.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I seen you do it repeatedly.</v>

77
00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:05.320
<v Speaker 6>Peers,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like I say,</v>

78
00:04:05.321 --> 00:04:08.540
<v Speaker 6>how do you hire people illegally and </v>
<v Speaker 6>enter to 1 million</v>

79
00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:13.530
<v Speaker 7>along with everybody?</v>
<v Speaker 7>You get along with nobody.</v>

80
00:04:13.531 --> 00:04:14.730
<v Speaker 7>You don't have one republic,</v>

81
00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:16.613
<v Speaker 4>have</v>

82
00:04:17.110 --> 00:04:20.680
<v Speaker 7>one Republican senator and you work with</v>
<v Speaker 7>them every day of your life,</v>

83
00:04:20.681 --> 00:04:22.870
<v Speaker 7>although you skipped a lot of time.</v>
<v Speaker 7>These are minor details,</v>

84
00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:26.590
<v Speaker 7>but you don't have one Republican </v>
<v Speaker 7>senator back in you,</v>

85
00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:27.453
<v Speaker 7>not one.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You don't have the endorsement of one </v>

86
00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:32.070
<v Speaker 7>Republican senator and you work with </v>
<v Speaker 7>these senator Cruz.</v>

87
00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:33.370
<v Speaker 7>You should be ashamed of yourself.</v>

88
00:04:33.670 --> 00:04:37.150
<v Speaker 1>Notice how in both cases,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ad hominine was used to distract.</v>

89
00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:38.193
<v Speaker 1>To deflect the underpinning question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This technique is very effective and </v>

90
00:04:42.281 --> 00:04:45.730
<v Speaker 1>finally we come to number six,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the absurd proposition.</v>

91
00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:46.983
<v Speaker 1>This is where you offer an extreme </v>
<v Speaker 1>scenario where you equate things that </v>

92
00:04:49.211 --> 00:04:50.044
<v Speaker 1>aren't equal at all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if you disguise it well enough and </v>

93
00:04:51.611 --> 00:04:54.010
<v Speaker 1>if your opponent can't find where your </v>
<v Speaker 1>argument is falling apart,</v>

94
00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:55.930
<v Speaker 1>it can pressure them into agreeing with </v>
<v Speaker 1>your point.</v>

95
00:04:56.320 --> 00:04:58.300
<v Speaker 1>Here's another example.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love South Park.</v>

96
00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:01.510
<v Speaker 5>Are you guys dub?</v>
<v Speaker 5>We can't beat him even with all of us.</v>

97
00:05:01.570 --> 00:05:02.403
<v Speaker 5>It's a waste of time that if you had a </v>
<v Speaker 5>chance right now to go back in time and </v>

98
00:05:05.741 --> 00:05:07.480
<v Speaker 5>stop Hitler,</v>
<v Speaker 5>wouldn't you do it?</v>

99
00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:10.710
<v Speaker 5>I'm just going to stop plague when hit </v>
<v Speaker 5>the rest power.</v>

100
00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:12.340
<v Speaker 5>There were a lot of people who just </v>
<v Speaker 5>stopped playing.</v>

101
00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:14.890
<v Speaker 5>You know who those people were?</v>
<v Speaker 5>The French.</v>

102
00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:17.560
<v Speaker 5>Are you French guy?</v>
<v Speaker 5>No.</v>

103
00:05:17.980 --> 00:05:20.670
<v Speaker 5>[inaudible].</v>
<v Speaker 5>All right.</v>

104
00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:21.580
<v Speaker 5>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'll do it.</v>

105
00:05:21.820 --> 00:05:25.320
<v Speaker 1>If your opponent doesn't spot the trick.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is a particularly effective tactic.</v>

106
00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:28.000
<v Speaker 1>That's everything I'm going to give you </v>
<v Speaker 1>scoundrels right now.</v>

107
00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:30.610
<v Speaker 1>The full list is in Archer Schopenhauer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his book.</v>

108
00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:31.473
<v Speaker 1>The secret is to disguise these within </v>
<v Speaker 1>an argument so that people don't know </v>

109
00:05:34.271 --> 00:05:36.430
<v Speaker 1>that you're playing tricks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and if you can do this well,</v>

110
00:05:36.431 --> 00:05:39.160
<v Speaker 1>you'll find yourself being right more </v>
<v Speaker 1>often than you thought possible.</v>

111
00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:41.800
<v Speaker 1>But even if you're trying to be fair and</v>
<v Speaker 1>honest and an argument,</v>

112
00:05:41.801 --> 00:05:44.740
<v Speaker 1>knowing these is always helpful to keep </v>
<v Speaker 1>the other guy honest.</v>

113
00:05:45.010 --> 00:05:48.430
<v Speaker 1>Knowing how people want to fight dirty </v>
<v Speaker 1>is the best defense to fight clean.</v>

114
00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:50.333
<v Speaker 1>But either way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether you're running for office or in </v>

115
00:05:51.731 --> 00:05:54.510
<v Speaker 1>a late night argument,</v>
<v Speaker 1>please fallacy responsibility.</v>
