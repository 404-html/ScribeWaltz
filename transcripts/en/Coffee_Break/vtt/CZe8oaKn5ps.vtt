1
00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:00.953
<v Speaker 1>Viewer discretion is advised.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In part one we learned what the hfs in </v>

2
00:00:04.321 --> 00:00:08.520
<v Speaker 1>principle is and how social taboos </v>
<v Speaker 1>affect the profanity of a society.</v>

3
00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:09.533
<v Speaker 1>Now I want to dive into American taboos </v>
<v Speaker 1>and explore how are taboos have changed </v>

4
00:00:12.691 --> 00:00:15.030
<v Speaker 1>over time and how profanity has </v>
<v Speaker 1>followed.</v>

5
00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:19.080
<v Speaker 1>Because profanity has drastically </v>
<v Speaker 1>changed with slurs and words about group</v>

6
00:00:19.081 --> 00:00:22.710
<v Speaker 1>identity quickly becoming the worst </v>
<v Speaker 1>kinds of profanity of this generation.</v>

7
00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:24.113
<v Speaker 1>And we're going to trace this change and</v>
<v Speaker 1>profanity through the lives of </v>

8
00:00:25.891 --> 00:00:26.724
<v Speaker 1>Comedians,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people who challenged taboos for a </v>

9
00:00:28.351 --> 00:00:29.184
<v Speaker 1>living.</v>

10
00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:43.830
<v Speaker 1>And our story begins in 1961 when lenny </v>
<v Speaker 1>bruce is arrested for saying cock sucker</v>

11
00:00:43.831 --> 00:00:44.664
<v Speaker 1>on stage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now that name may fly over some modern </v>

12
00:00:46.801 --> 00:00:47.634
<v Speaker 1>heads,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but at the time Lenny Bruce was the </v>

13
00:00:48.991 --> 00:00:52.470
<v Speaker 1>biggest thing in comedy in rolling </v>
<v Speaker 1>Stone's best standups of all time.</v>

14
00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:56.310
<v Speaker 1>Bruce is number three on that list and </v>
<v Speaker 1>if comedy loves being on the edge,</v>

15
00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:58.470
<v Speaker 1>then lenny was the guy dancing off </v>
<v Speaker 1>cliffs.</v>

16
00:00:58.530 --> 00:00:59.363
<v Speaker 1>His comedy took on every American sacred</v>
<v Speaker 1>cow from race to sexual puritanism and </v>

17
00:01:03.121 --> 00:01:03.954
<v Speaker 1>he would say anything,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even if it got him arrested and his </v>

18
00:01:06.511 --> 00:01:07.344
<v Speaker 1>whole life was full of legal issues.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was in and out of court houses for </v>

19
00:01:09.931 --> 00:01:10.764
<v Speaker 1>saying the wrong words,</v>
<v Speaker 1>appealing and just dealing with a cold </v>

20
00:01:13.291 --> 00:01:14.124
<v Speaker 1>legal system and obscenity laws.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All the while he was whittling away </v>

21
00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:17.933
<v Speaker 1>eventually dying in his home in 1966 </v>
<v Speaker 1>four years before New York's Highest </v>

22
00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:23.820
<v Speaker 1>Appellate Court would vindicate him of </v>
<v Speaker 1>all charges.</v>

23
00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:27.720
<v Speaker 1>One of his prosecutors later said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we all knew what we were doing.</v>

24
00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:28.793
<v Speaker 1>We use the law to kill him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this is a pivotal moment because </v>

25
00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:34.770
<v Speaker 1>even though America is prosecuting </v>
<v Speaker 1>comics for breaking taboos,</v>

26
00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:35.873
<v Speaker 1>there was also a shift taking place in </v>
<v Speaker 1>young people right around the 60s and </v>

27
00:01:39.361 --> 00:01:42.900
<v Speaker 1>seventies America has the sexual </v>
<v Speaker 1>revolution and the civil rights movement</v>

28
00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:46.650
<v Speaker 1>that totally shake up the value system </v>
<v Speaker 1>of America and change the taboos.</v>

29
00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:50.130
<v Speaker 1>So 10 years after bruce gets arrested,</v>
<v Speaker 1>another comedian,</v>

30
00:01:50.131 --> 00:01:52.410
<v Speaker 1>George Carlin is coming up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>similar style,</v>

31
00:01:52.411 --> 00:01:53.244
<v Speaker 1>similar anti authoritarian and a similar</v>
<v Speaker 1>fascination with bad words and pushing </v>

32
00:01:56.731 --> 00:01:59.610
<v Speaker 1>the edge.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But this time the culture has changed,</v>

33
00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:02.880
<v Speaker 1>so when Carlin performed seven words,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't say on television,</v>

34
00:02:02.881 --> 00:02:05.310
<v Speaker 1>which is loaded with the worst profanity</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the day,</v>

35
00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:07.170
<v Speaker 1>it's a huge success.</v>

36
00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:08.503
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just like we've decided there'd be </v>

37
00:02:09.741 --> 00:02:10.574
<v Speaker 2>somewhere as we won't say all the time </v>
<v Speaker 2>and I was just trying to find out which </v>

38
00:02:12.711 --> 00:02:13.544
<v Speaker 2>words they were for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All of them I wanted to list and I </v>

39
00:02:16.431 --> 00:02:19.670
<v Speaker 2>wanted to know the ones that she could </v>
<v Speaker 2>never say on television.</v>

40
00:02:19.671 --> 00:02:20.504
<v Speaker 2>I mean the filthy words that are always </v>
<v Speaker 2>filthy and all I could think of was </v>

41
00:02:23.751 --> 00:02:24.201
<v Speaker 2>shit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Piss,</v>

42
00:02:24.201 --> 00:02:25.490
<v Speaker 2>fuck cock cock sucker motherfucker.</v>

43
00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:28.223
<v Speaker 1>He was just as provocative as lenny </v>
<v Speaker 1>bruce was except time had gone by and </v>

44
00:02:31.441 --> 00:02:33.840
<v Speaker 1>the taboos of the older generation were </v>
<v Speaker 1>weakened.</v>

45
00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:37.770
<v Speaker 1>The difference between Carlin and Bruce </v>
<v Speaker 1>was when they did the act.</v>

46
00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:39.780
<v Speaker 1>Carlin mentions this idea in an </v>
<v Speaker 1>interview.</v>

47
00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:44.050
<v Speaker 2>Lenny and I had this language in common </v>
<v Speaker 2>and he brought,</v>

48
00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:47.270
<v Speaker 2>he was the first one to make language an</v>
<v Speaker 2>issue and he suffered for it.</v>

49
00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:51.230
<v Speaker 2>I was the first one to make a language </v>
<v Speaker 2>issue and to succeed from it.</v>

50
00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:56.050
<v Speaker 1>Lesson from George Carlin is obvious in </v>
<v Speaker 1>profanity and in comedy.</v>

51
00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:57.363
<v Speaker 1>Timing is everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But this cultural shift that Carlin </v>

52
00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:00.333
<v Speaker 1>built a career on didn't stop there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hfs words have continued to weaken and </v>

53
00:03:04.151 --> 00:03:06.610
<v Speaker 1>as good as Carlin's bit was almost 50 </v>
<v Speaker 1>years later,</v>

54
00:03:06.611 --> 00:03:11.080
<v Speaker 1>his list of dirty words you can't say on</v>
<v Speaker 1>television needs an update because on tv</v>

55
00:03:11.081 --> 00:03:11.914
<v Speaker 1>and especially on the Internet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can say any of those words that you </v>

56
00:03:14.681 --> 00:03:15.514
<v Speaker 1>want.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now don't be turned this back around </v>

57
00:03:16.801 --> 00:03:18.700
<v Speaker 1>when we stopped being a con,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was bob.</v>

58
00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:20.860
<v Speaker 1>Bob had bits,</v>
<v Speaker 1>tips give,</v>

59
00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:23.380
<v Speaker 1>give him me to fucking creeps.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know that Dexter Lt,</v>

60
00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:26.920
<v Speaker 1>this is a waste about damn time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You pissed me off.</v>

61
00:03:26.921 --> 00:03:28.730
<v Speaker 1>San Francisco Cox,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can.</v>

62
00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:32.770
<v Speaker 1>This is called cop took up shit on shit.</v>

63
00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:34.340
<v Speaker 3>Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Shit.</v>

64
00:03:34.341 --> 00:03:35.060
<v Speaker 3>Judge,</v>
<v Speaker 3>judge,</v>

65
00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:35.601
<v Speaker 3>judge,</v>
<v Speaker 3>judge,</v>

66
00:03:35.601 --> 00:03:36.000
<v Speaker 3>judge,</v>
<v Speaker 3>judge,</v>

67
00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:36.421
<v Speaker 3>judge,</v>
<v Speaker 3>judge,</v>

68
00:03:36.421 --> 00:03:36.890
<v Speaker 3>judge,</v>
<v Speaker 3>judge,</v>

69
00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:37.390
<v Speaker 3>judge.</v>

70
00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:38.223
<v Speaker 1>So to recap what Lenny Bruce got </v>
<v Speaker 1>arrested for is what Carlin got </v>

71
00:03:41.051 --> 00:03:43.870
<v Speaker 1>celebrated for and now you can win </v>
<v Speaker 1>Carlin's bad word Bingo.</v>

72
00:03:43.871 --> 00:03:44.704
<v Speaker 1>Just flipping through a few channels.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These words are hardly taboo or </v>

73
00:03:47.291 --> 00:03:49.060
<v Speaker 1>forbidden at all anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

74
00:03:49.061 --> 00:03:52.660
<v Speaker 1>a study came out that just over five </v>
<v Speaker 1>years across all TV networks,</v>

75
00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:57.610
<v Speaker 1>the usage of traditional profanity went </v>
<v Speaker 1>up 69% and over 50 years,</v>

76
00:03:57.611 --> 00:03:58.444
<v Speaker 1>authors were 28 times more likely to </v>
<v Speaker 1>include traditional swearing in the </v>

77
00:04:01.361 --> 00:04:04.450
<v Speaker 1>books they wrote.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's clear empirical evidence that</v>

78
00:04:04.451 --> 00:04:07.960
<v Speaker 1>hfs words have been normalized.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not that they're completely harmless,</v>

79
00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:09.820
<v Speaker 1>but they've been robbed of most of their</v>
<v Speaker 1>bike.</v>

80
00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:13.420
<v Speaker 1>Hfs words in America are something like </v>
<v Speaker 1>the queen of England.</v>

81
00:04:13.990 --> 00:04:16.960
<v Speaker 1>There's still the face of profanity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's not much power behind them.</v>

82
00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:19.113
<v Speaker 1>But while hfs words were being declawed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a special class of words became even </v>

83
00:04:22.541 --> 00:04:25.750
<v Speaker 1>more toxic and unsayable then before </v>
<v Speaker 1>slurs,</v>

84
00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:27.670
<v Speaker 1>the inwards hate speech,</v>
<v Speaker 1>microaggressions,</v>

85
00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:28.683
<v Speaker 1>anything targeting identity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these became the new sacred cow to </v>

86
00:04:31.841 --> 00:04:32.674
<v Speaker 1>replace the old.</v>

87
00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:35.110
<v Speaker 1>You won't get fired for saying fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>the office,</v>

88
00:04:35.111 --> 00:04:37.150
<v Speaker 1>but you might get fired for saying the </v>
<v Speaker 1>other f word.</v>

89
00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:38.733
<v Speaker 1>Now it's worth taking a moment to say </v>
<v Speaker 1>that slurs are different from other </v>

90
00:04:40.931 --> 00:04:42.670
<v Speaker 1>types of profanity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>After all,</v>

91
00:04:42.671 --> 00:04:45.010
<v Speaker 1>they specially target groups,</v>
<v Speaker 1>unlike other bad words,</v>

92
00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:46.330
<v Speaker 1>acids,</v>
<v Speaker 1>universal,</v>

93
00:04:46.331 --> 00:04:49.090
<v Speaker 1>because everyone has one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but not everyone is a homosexual.</v>

94
00:04:49.091 --> 00:04:51.220
<v Speaker 1>So words like Faggot seem much more </v>
<v Speaker 1>targeted,</v>

95
00:04:51.730 --> 00:04:54.850
<v Speaker 1>so perhaps slurs do deserve a special </v>
<v Speaker 1>place in our language.</v>

96
00:04:55.420 --> 00:04:56.253
<v Speaker 1>That said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's something about this profanity </v>

97
00:04:57.641 --> 00:04:58.474
<v Speaker 1>that I don't like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Often we judge the word by itself </v>

98
00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:03.730
<v Speaker 1>condemning syllables regardless of </v>
<v Speaker 1>situation.</v>

99
00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:05.073
<v Speaker 1>Chris Rock noted this in an interview </v>
<v Speaker 1>saying why he stopped performing at </v>

100
00:05:07.361 --> 00:05:09.020
<v Speaker 1>colleges,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because quote,</v>

101
00:05:09.070 --> 00:05:11.710
<v Speaker 1>they're way too conservative,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not in their political views,</v>

102
00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:15.160
<v Speaker 1>but in their social views and in their </v>
<v Speaker 1>willingness not to offend anybody.</v>

103
00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:18.400
<v Speaker 1>You can't even be offensive on your way </v>
<v Speaker 1>to being inoffensive.</v>

104
00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:19.653
<v Speaker 1>In other words,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even if you have something wholesome to </v>

105
00:05:21.281 --> 00:05:22.680
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you better not use the no,</v>

106
00:05:22.681 --> 00:05:24.550
<v Speaker 1>no language on your way to making that </v>
<v Speaker 1>point.</v>

107
00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:28.120
<v Speaker 1>He goes on to mention someone else who </v>
<v Speaker 1>also hated the new profanity.</v>

108
00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:29.853
<v Speaker 1>I remember talking to George Carlin </v>
<v Speaker 1>before he died and him saying the exact </v>

109
00:05:32.321 --> 00:05:34.270
<v Speaker 1>same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

110
00:05:34.450 --> 00:05:35.350
<v Speaker 1>he has a bit about it.</v>

111
00:05:36.020 --> 00:05:36.853
<v Speaker 4>Visit different group to get pissed off </v>
<v Speaker 4>at you in this country for everything </v>

112
00:05:39.131 --> 00:05:41.560
<v Speaker 4>you're not suppose to say.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Can't say fruit.</v>

113
00:05:41.561 --> 00:05:43.180
<v Speaker 4>Can't say faggot.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Can't say queer.</v>

114
00:05:43.181 --> 00:05:45.430
<v Speaker 4>Can't say Nancy boy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Can't say pansy.</v>

115
00:05:45.910 --> 00:05:46.743
<v Speaker 4>Can't say nigger.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Boogie Jake Jigaboo skinhead jungle </v>

116
00:05:48.941 --> 00:05:50.980
<v Speaker 4>bunny.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Morely more than Yana Schweitzer.</v>

117
00:05:51.370 --> 00:05:56.370
<v Speaker 4>There is absolutely nothing wrong with </v>
<v Speaker 4>any of those words in and of themselves.</v>

118
00:05:58.550 --> 00:06:01.580
<v Speaker 1>It's the intention behind the words that</v>
<v Speaker 1>makes them good or bad.</v>

119
00:06:01.730 --> 00:06:05.630
<v Speaker 1>I get tired of people talking about bad </v>
<v Speaker 1>words and bad language bullshit.</v>

120
00:06:05.750 --> 00:06:08.450
<v Speaker 1>It's the context that makes them good or</v>
<v Speaker 1>bad,</v>

121
00:06:09.270 --> 00:06:12.420
<v Speaker 1>but despite that eloquent argument for </v>
<v Speaker 1>the total liberation of words,</v>

122
00:06:12.510 --> 00:06:15.990
<v Speaker 1>I can't help but think that Carlin lost </v>
<v Speaker 1>his war for total free speech,</v>

123
00:06:16.320 --> 00:06:21.320
<v Speaker 1>even if he won his battle for liberating</v>
<v Speaker 1>a type of profanity because profanity is</v>

124
00:06:21.571 --> 00:06:22.404
<v Speaker 1>a human universal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>deeply rooted in societal taboos and </v>

125
00:06:24.871 --> 00:06:28.860
<v Speaker 1>though these taboos can shift with time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they never disappear entirely,</v>

126
00:06:28.980 --> 00:06:32.160
<v Speaker 1>so the profanity won't either.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It will only change.</v>

127
00:06:32.190 --> 00:06:35.100
<v Speaker 1>This has been the story in America in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the last 50 years.</v>

128
00:06:35.101 --> 00:06:35.934
<v Speaker 1>We have shifted from primarily in hfs </v>
<v Speaker 1>culture to primarily and in cultural </v>

129
00:06:39.370 --> 00:06:40.830
<v Speaker 1>swearing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For me,</v>

130
00:06:40.890 --> 00:06:41.723
<v Speaker 1>this suggests that we don't get less </v>
<v Speaker 1>sensitive as much as we change what </v>

131
00:06:44.341 --> 00:06:46.980
<v Speaker 1>we're sensitive about and this is </v>
<v Speaker 1>ultimately brought forward.</v>

132
00:06:46.981 --> 00:06:47.814
<v Speaker 1>A few questions in my mind.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What balance of free speech and </v>

133
00:06:50.191 --> 00:06:54.390
<v Speaker 1>sensitivity towards social issues do we </v>
<v Speaker 1>want given that taboos change over time?</v>

134
00:06:54.720 --> 00:06:55.553
<v Speaker 1>How can we recognize that word's harm?</v>
<v Speaker 1>People without capitulating towards an </v>

135
00:06:58.531 --> 00:07:01.350
<v Speaker 1>ideology that condemns words outside of </v>
<v Speaker 1>their context.</v>

136
00:07:01.650 --> 00:07:02.483
<v Speaker 1>And finally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is it inevitable that our kids will </v>

137
00:07:04.171 --> 00:07:07.500
<v Speaker 1>simultaneously think we were being </v>
<v Speaker 1>prudes and bigots?</v>

138
00:07:10.200 --> 00:07:15.200
<v Speaker 1>Only time will tell,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Aye.</v>

139
00:07:16.150 --> 00:07:17.020
<v Speaker 1>Aye.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Aye.</v>

140
00:07:17.410 --> 00:07:18.243
<v Speaker 1>I wish I had the worst.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So express this and that's been his </v>

141
00:07:20.961 --> 00:07:23.010
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then my chest and stomach is flatter</v>

142
00:07:23.011 --> 00:07:24.130
<v Speaker 1>him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When I hear your name,</v>

143
00:07:24.131 --> 00:07:29.131
<v Speaker 1>all those vibrations to hedge rums,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm making some soup and I love the cute</v>

144
00:07:29.171 --> 00:07:32.160
<v Speaker 1>things that we do watching me write my </v>
<v Speaker 1>lyrics and you critique them.</v>

145
00:07:32.190 --> 00:07:35.380
<v Speaker 1>And so that's something you never have </v>
<v Speaker 1>to put your energy into.</v>

146
00:07:35.381 --> 00:07:37.490
