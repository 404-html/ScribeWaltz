00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:01.680
<v Speaker 1>This video represents a hundred percent </v>
<v Speaker 1>fact,</v>

2
00:00:01.681 --> 00:00:04.020
<v Speaker 1>and it's not at all an opinion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you disagree with this video,</v>

3
00:00:04.021 --> 00:00:04.854
<v Speaker 1>this merely implies that you are </v>
<v Speaker 1>misaligned with reality or miseducated </v>

4
00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:08.220
<v Speaker 1>on the facts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If the former,</v>

5
00:00:08.221 --> 00:00:10.800
<v Speaker 1>I suggested psychiatrist the latter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I suggest watching this video.</v>

6
00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:14.370
<v Speaker 1>Let's start this up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The piano is the greatest sytropin ever,</v>

7
00:00:14.371 --> 00:00:16.260
<v Speaker 1>and I'm going to give you five reasons </v>
<v Speaker 1>why.</v>

8
00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:18.630
<v Speaker 1>Number one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>most instruments like the voice,</v>

9
00:00:18.631 --> 00:00:19.464
<v Speaker 1>wind,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and brass instruments can only play one </v>

10
00:00:20.791 --> 00:00:23.280
<v Speaker 1>note at a time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This means to even play simple pieces.</v>

11
00:00:23.281 --> 00:00:25.650
<v Speaker 1>These instruments require you to have </v>
<v Speaker 1>several friends to play with.</v>

12
00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:27.850
<v Speaker 1>With piano,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can forego all of that in play,</v>

13
00:00:27.851 --> 00:00:30.270
<v Speaker 1>several notes at the same time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is one of the main reasons.</v>

14
00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:31.890
<v Speaker 1>It's the most popular singles </v>
<v Speaker 1>instrument.</v>

15
00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:34.350
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>solo instrument number two,</v>

16
00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:35.543
<v Speaker 1>a lot of instruments take a ton of </v>
<v Speaker 1>practice just to create a good sound </v>

17
00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:38.633
<v Speaker 1>like trumpet or Violin,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which leads everyone with an earshot to </v>

18
00:00:41.041 --> 00:00:42.270
<v Speaker 1>hate you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why you practice?</v>

19
00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:47.330
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with just one press of the Canada,</v>

20
00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:50.230
<v Speaker 1>anyone can get a reasonable sound.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

21
00:00:56.740 --> 00:00:58.990
<v Speaker 1>so even though the piano is incredibly </v>
<v Speaker 1>tough to master,</v>

22
00:00:58.991 --> 00:01:00.730
<v Speaker 1>at least people won't hate you while you</v>
<v Speaker 1>do it.</v>

23
00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:02.710
<v Speaker 1>Number three,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the layout is intuitive.</v>

24
00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:03.843
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know this might sound confusing to </v>

25
00:01:04.451 --> 00:01:07.060
<v Speaker 1>some of you who look at the piano like I</v>
<v Speaker 1>might look at Chinese menu,</v>

26
00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:09.430
<v Speaker 1>but trust me compared to some of these </v>
<v Speaker 1>monstrosities,</v>

27
00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:13.030
<v Speaker 1>the piano is really easy to understand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All you really have to know is the pitch</v>

28
00:01:13.031 --> 00:01:15.850
<v Speaker 1>of these notes go up in ascending order,</v>
<v Speaker 1>low to high.</v>

29
00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:18.430
<v Speaker 1>What's your brain expects is exactly how</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's laid out.</v>

30
00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:20.500
<v Speaker 1>This is always higher than anything </v>
<v Speaker 1>below it.</v>

31
00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:24.280
<v Speaker 1>Add to this the fact that the piano is a</v>
<v Speaker 1>very visual instrument and this makes it</v>

32
00:01:24.281 --> 00:01:25.114
<v Speaker 1>the perfect learning tool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is why if you seriously study any </v>

33
00:01:26.981 --> 00:01:27.814
<v Speaker 1>instrument,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you will at some point be asked to pick </v>

34
00:01:28.991 --> 00:01:31.930
<v Speaker 1>up a little bit of piano on the side in </v>
<v Speaker 1>order to help you understand music.</v>

35
00:01:31.931 --> 00:01:33.400
<v Speaker 1>Period.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Number four,</v>

36
00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:35.290
<v Speaker 1>whether it be Chopin,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bach,</v>

37
00:01:35.291 --> 00:01:36.124
<v Speaker 1>or billy Joel,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the overwhelming majority of great </v>

38
00:01:37.511 --> 00:01:39.970
<v Speaker 1>composers play piano.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Number five,</v>

39
00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:41.313
<v Speaker 1>check this out,</v>

40
00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.963
<v Speaker 2>Huh?</v>

41
00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:50.080
<v Speaker 1>Now that's a pretty compelling reason to</v>
<v Speaker 1>learn sacks,</v>

42
00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:51.563
<v Speaker 2>but</v>

43
00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:53.810
<v Speaker 1>actually it was played on a keyboard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

44
00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:55.210
<v Speaker 1>A an electric piano using</v>

45
00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:57.090
<v Speaker 2>call instrument.</v>

46
00:01:57.400 --> 00:01:58.233
<v Speaker 1>These are becoming more common in some </v>
<v Speaker 1>more realistic as technology gets </v>

47
00:02:00.371 --> 00:02:02.740
<v Speaker 1>better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So eventually you'll be able to play any</v>

48
00:02:02.741 --> 00:02:07.741
<v Speaker 1>instrument from the greatest instrument </v>
<v Speaker 1>of all the piano check mate.</v>

49
00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:11.650
<v Speaker 1>But now that I'm done ripping on every </v>
<v Speaker 1>other musician,</v>

50
00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:12.513
<v Speaker 1>let me just save this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll hope for you guys is not lost less </v>

51
00:02:15.221 --> 00:02:16.560
<v Speaker 1>pianists have one crucial,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

52
00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:18.583
<v Speaker 3>there it is.</v>
