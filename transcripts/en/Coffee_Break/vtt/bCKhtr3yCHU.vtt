00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:03.960
<v Speaker 1>Apple has an advertising style that's as</v>
<v Speaker 1>iconic as it is copied the Internet,</v>

2
00:00:03.961 --> 00:00:06.480
<v Speaker 1>is full of parodies and lookalikes from </v>
<v Speaker 1>competitors,</v>

3
00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:10.050
<v Speaker 1>yet somehow the magic in apple's </v>
<v Speaker 1>commercials isn't spoiled even though we</v>

4
00:00:10.051 --> 00:00:12.630
<v Speaker 1>know the formula,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it never ceases to blow our minds to see</v>

5
00:00:12.631 --> 00:00:14.160
<v Speaker 1>the newest iphone commercial come out.</v>

6
00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:16.910
<v Speaker 2>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What makes apple special?</v>

7
00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:20.090
<v Speaker 2>A big reason is thanks to the guidance </v>
<v Speaker 2>of Mike Markkula.</v>

8
00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:21.403
<v Speaker 2>He was an early investor in apple and </v>
<v Speaker 2>was the vice president of marketing in </v>

9
00:00:23.841 --> 00:00:26.330
<v Speaker 2>1977 when apple was first getting off </v>
<v Speaker 2>the ground.</v>

10
00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:27.193
<v Speaker 2>Marcola wrote a three point marketing </v>
<v Speaker 2>philosophy that has been in the </v>

11
00:00:29.061 --> 00:00:31.700
<v Speaker 2>forefront of the company ever since.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Apple's marketing focus.</v>

12
00:00:31.701 --> 00:00:33.230
<v Speaker 2>He says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>should be empathy,</v>

13
00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:34.303
<v Speaker 2>focus and impute with empathy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Apple strive to connect with customers </v>

14
00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:40.880
<v Speaker 2>feelings while other talk about detailed</v>
<v Speaker 2>specs and processor power.</v>

15
00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.983
<v Speaker 2>Apple talks a lot about battery life,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the way it feels in your hands and the </v>

16
00:00:44.451 --> 00:00:45.284
<v Speaker 2>way it will connect you with others.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Focus focused on accomplishing the main </v>

17
00:00:49.311 --> 00:00:51.530
<v Speaker 2>goals and eliminate unimportant </v>
<v Speaker 2>opportunities.</v>

18
00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:54.890
<v Speaker 2>While other companies make a million </v>
<v Speaker 2>different variations of their products.</v>

19
00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:58.280
<v Speaker 2>Apple only makes a few.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When Steve Jobs came back to apple,</v>

20
00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:59.263
<v Speaker 2>he cut down their number of product </v>
<v Speaker 2>lines from several dozen to four by </v>

21
00:01:02.421 --> 00:01:03.254
<v Speaker 2>refocusing apple on a few products,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they were able to create a superior </v>

22
00:01:05.391 --> 00:01:06.224
<v Speaker 2>experience.</v>

23
00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:07.663
<v Speaker 2>Impute.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is possibly the most important </v>

24
00:01:08.931 --> 00:01:10.910
<v Speaker 2>principle of Margolis marketing </v>
<v Speaker 2>manifesto.</v>

25
00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:14.300
<v Speaker 2>Mark Road.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People do judge a book by its cover.</v>

26
00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:17.030
<v Speaker 2>You may have the best products,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if you present them poorly,</v>

27
00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:18.103
<v Speaker 2>it will be perceived.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you present them in a creative </v>

28
00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:23.360
<v Speaker 2>professional manner,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you will impute the desired qualities.</v>

29
00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:26.030
<v Speaker 2>In other words,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the way an iphone ad is presented is the</v>

30
00:01:26.031 --> 00:01:29.510
<v Speaker 2>way that the iphone will be perceived </v>
<v Speaker 2>and that seems obvious,</v>

31
00:01:29.511 --> 00:01:31.670
<v Speaker 2>but this means that even the colors of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the ad,</v>

32
00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:35.420
<v Speaker 2>whether the space is cluttered or clean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the tone of voice of the narrator,</v>

33
00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:38.600
<v Speaker 2>he animations control the way the iphone</v>
<v Speaker 2>is viewed.</v>

34
00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:39.673
<v Speaker 2>Even though all of these have nothing to</v>
<v Speaker 2>do with actual performance and this can </v>

35
00:01:43.941 --> 00:01:46.700
<v Speaker 2>either hurt or help a company,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is why mark nature,</v>

36
00:01:46.701 --> 00:01:49.160
<v Speaker 2>apple kept it as a guiding principle to </v>
<v Speaker 2>their business.</v>

37
00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:50.750
<v Speaker 2>Fast forward,</v>
<v Speaker 2>40 years later,</v>

38
00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:53.240
<v Speaker 2>apple is the master at using this to </v>
<v Speaker 2>their advantage.</v>

39
00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:56.360
<v Speaker 2>If you watch an apple ad,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can find everything you need to know</v>

40
00:01:56.361 --> 00:01:58.760
<v Speaker 2>from the first few seconds,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even if the audio is muted.</v>

41
00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:02.120
<v Speaker 2>Now that we know the three philosophies </v>
<v Speaker 2>apple uses to advertise,</v>

42
00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:03.313
<v Speaker 2>let's talk about the types of </v>
<v Speaker 2>advertisements apple does in the </v>

43
00:02:04.941 --> 00:02:05.774
<v Speaker 2>lifecycle of one of their products.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They pretty much fall into three </v>

44
00:02:07.731 --> 00:02:09.560
<v Speaker 2>categories.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The introduction,</v>

45
00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:14.060
<v Speaker 2>this is the first video and it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>basically a hype video pumped up music,</v>

46
00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:16.970
<v Speaker 2>pretty screens everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Basically just showing off the phone.</v>

47
00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:23.160
<v Speaker 3>Iphone seven makes the things you do </v>
<v Speaker 3>most even better.</v>

48
00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:26.280
<v Speaker 3>It's the best iphone we've ever made.</v>

49
00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:33.150
<v Speaker 2>The specs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is the second video they'll make if</v>

50
00:02:33.151 --> 00:02:33.984
<v Speaker 2>they can get johnny ive to do this one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the best point of this video is </v>

51
00:02:36.961 --> 00:02:39.720
<v Speaker 2>to make people feel like their old </v>
<v Speaker 2>devices outdated and slow.</v>

52
00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:44.460
<v Speaker 2>A ton of talk about redesign and a lot,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of comparative words,</v>

53
00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:47.130
<v Speaker 2>and they'll also use pretty sounding,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but ultimately meaningless.</v>

54
00:02:47.131 --> 00:02:49.710
<v Speaker 2>Words like color gamut,</v>
<v Speaker 2>advanced sensors,</v>

55
00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:50.603
<v Speaker 2>and unique.</v>

56
00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:52.083
<v Speaker 1>To put it on a much larger scale,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we designed it's 78 percent more screen </v>

57
00:02:56.861 --> 00:02:59.080
<v Speaker 1>area,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a greater level of precision.</v>

58
00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:00.010
<v Speaker 1>We completely</v>

59
00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:00.843
<v Speaker 3>re engineered the tuck subsystem,</v>
<v Speaker 3>increasing the sensitivity of the </v>

60
00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:05.023
<v Speaker 3>sensors,</v>
<v Speaker 3>doubling the touch refresh rate the </v>

61
00:03:06.971 --> 00:03:08.300
<v Speaker 3>most,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the highest greater risk,</v>

62
00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:09.173
<v Speaker 3>specifically designed for much larger </v>
<v Speaker 3>display and see more precise multitouch </v>

63
00:03:13.751 --> 00:03:18.751
<v Speaker 3>technology in entirely new for speaker </v>
<v Speaker 3>architecture in more an indifferent ways</v>

64
00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:21.910
<v Speaker 3>flexibility,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we've developed a new technology,</v>

65
00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:25.810
<v Speaker 3>more productive,</v>
<v Speaker 3>more creative and entirely new scale.</v>

66
00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:30.490
<v Speaker 2>After the intro inspects,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's all about narrative.</v>

67
00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:34.090
<v Speaker 2>This is just classic content marketing </v>
<v Speaker 2>and what is that?</v>

68
00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:35.013
<v Speaker 2>Basically it's when you tell a story </v>
<v Speaker 2>where your product just so happens to </v>

69
00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:39.280
<v Speaker 2>facilitate or caused something to </v>
<v Speaker 2>happen,</v>

70
00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:43.000
<v Speaker 2>but there's no explicit promotion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Pay attention to this video because it's</v>

71
00:03:43.001 --> 00:03:44.890
<v Speaker 2>the classic case of content marketing.</v>

72
00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:55.470
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're watching your daughter at a Romeo</v>

73
00:03:55.471 --> 00:03:57.420
<v Speaker 2>and Juliet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Play in capturing that special moment.</v>

74
00:03:57.750 --> 00:03:59.340
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>catch it better with the new iphone.</v>

75
00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:02.400
<v Speaker 2>This is a really good way to sell </v>
<v Speaker 2>anything.</v>

76
00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:03.923
<v Speaker 2>This phase continues through the rest of</v>
<v Speaker 2>the product life cycle until they </v>

77
00:04:06.301 --> 00:04:09.690
<v Speaker 2>announced the next device,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at which point we come to distancing.</v>

78
00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:13.230
<v Speaker 2>This really isn't an ad,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's necessary for advertising.</v>

79
00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:14.753
<v Speaker 2>This is where they wipe all the evidence</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the old advertisements from their </v>

80
00:04:16.741 --> 00:04:17.574
<v Speaker 2>channel and their webpage.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is so customers don't get </v>

81
00:04:19.741 --> 00:04:22.420
<v Speaker 2>distracted when they want to buy a </v>
<v Speaker 2>refurbished and five,</v>

82
00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:25.530
<v Speaker 2>when the iphone seven is out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and this is also assuming never realized</v>

83
00:04:25.531 --> 00:04:27.180
<v Speaker 2>they've been saying the same stuff for </v>
<v Speaker 2>years.</v>

84
00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:29.700
<v Speaker 2>That's pretty much it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now you know how apple advertises.</v>

85
00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:31.343
<v Speaker 2>Thanks for watching.</v>
