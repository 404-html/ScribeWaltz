00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:00.893
<v Speaker 1>Warning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This video is about profanity across </v>

2
00:00:02.581 --> 00:00:05.490
<v Speaker 1>cultures,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so profanity is used uncensored.</v>

3
00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:06.630
<v Speaker 1>You were discretion</v>

4
00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:11.710
<v Speaker 2>is advised.</v>
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible]</v>

5
00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:21.250
<v Speaker 1>where do bad words come from and what </v>
<v Speaker 1>are the similarities,</v>

6
00:00:21.251 --> 00:00:22.084
<v Speaker 1>if any,</v>
<v Speaker 1>across languages and cultures in </v>

7
00:00:23.841 --> 00:00:24.674
<v Speaker 1>swearing?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What causes some words to be worse than </v>

8
00:00:27.821 --> 00:00:28.654
<v Speaker 1>others?</v>
<v Speaker 1>These questions have fascinated </v>

9
00:00:30.251 --> 00:00:33.670
<v Speaker 1>linguists for centuries and today we're </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to look at some of the answers.</v>

10
00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:34.893
<v Speaker 1>When you look across the world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>profanity is almost a universal feature </v>

11
00:00:37.631 --> 00:00:38.464
<v Speaker 1>of language.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have created thousands of different </v>

12
00:00:40.091 --> 00:00:40.924
<v Speaker 1>profane words,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but despite some moderate variation </v>

13
00:00:42.941 --> 00:00:43.774
<v Speaker 1>between languages,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the types of words we classify as </v>

14
00:00:46.031 --> 00:00:46.864
<v Speaker 1>unsayable in public share.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A lot of overlap and this is because we </v>

15
00:00:50.081 --> 00:00:53.110
<v Speaker 1>all create bad words around social </v>
<v Speaker 1>taboos.</v>

16
00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:56.710
<v Speaker 1>Taboos are things in a society that are </v>
<v Speaker 1>considered to private,</v>

17
00:00:56.711 --> 00:00:58.300
<v Speaker 1>gross,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ugly or sacred.</v>

18
00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:02.200
<v Speaker 1>Their topics so delicate that they can </v>
<v Speaker 1>only be allowed in certain places.</v>

19
00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:04.060
<v Speaker 1>Bodily functions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

20
00:01:04.061 --> 00:01:06.070
<v Speaker 1>have taboos that are confined to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>bathroom.</v>

21
00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:08.650
<v Speaker 1>Sex has taboos that are confined to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>bedroom,</v>

22
00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:12.100
<v Speaker 1>uncomfortable past events contained </v>
<v Speaker 1>taboos that are confined to history,</v>

23
00:01:12.101 --> 00:01:12.934
<v Speaker 1>class and religious rituals have taboos </v>
<v Speaker 1>that are confined to the temple or </v>

24
00:01:15.881 --> 00:01:17.620
<v Speaker 1>church and these taboos.</v>

25
00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:18.513
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes though not always will lead to</v>
<v Speaker 1>certain words describing them becoming </v>

26
00:01:22.061 --> 00:01:25.750
<v Speaker 1>themselves off limits due to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>association with the taboo itself.</v>

27
00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:26.943
<v Speaker 1>In other words,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not only do we have a contextual </v>

28
00:01:28.841 --> 00:01:30.910
<v Speaker 1>allowance for sensitive parts of our </v>
<v Speaker 1>lives,</v>

29
00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:33.400
<v Speaker 1>we do the same with the words describing</v>
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>

30
00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:36.100
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can say poop or but just fine,</v>

31
00:01:36.101 --> 00:01:36.934
<v Speaker 1>but if you talk about shit or an ass,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well now you've crossed the line even </v>

32
00:01:39.581 --> 00:01:41.260
<v Speaker 1>though they are words for the same </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>

33
00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:44.920
<v Speaker 1>One has been deemed culturally </v>
<v Speaker 1>appropriate and the other has not.</v>

34
00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:45.933
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some cultures create different taboos </v>

35
00:01:47.351 --> 00:01:49.180
<v Speaker 1>and others,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but looking across the world,</v>

36
00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:51.940
<v Speaker 1>we generally find the same big four </v>
<v Speaker 1>taboos,</v>

37
00:01:51.941 --> 00:01:55.840
<v Speaker 1>creating most of the bad language,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the four horsemen of profanity,</v>

38
00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:58.000
<v Speaker 1>sex,</v>
<v Speaker 1>bodily function,</v>

39
00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:01.960
<v Speaker 1>religion and slurs and this pattern of </v>
<v Speaker 1>fairly common taboos,</v>

40
00:02:01.961 --> 00:02:05.950
<v Speaker 1>breeding similar bad words because </v>
<v Speaker 1>Benjamin k Bergen in his book,</v>

41
00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:09.730
<v Speaker 1>what the F to come up with a </v>
<v Speaker 1>categorization method for profanity that</v>

42
00:02:09.731 --> 00:02:12.130
<v Speaker 1>he calls the holy fucking Shit nigger </v>
<v Speaker 1>principle.</v>

43
00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:14.290
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's actually what he calls it.</v>

44
00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:15.693
<v Speaker 1>Here's the idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Benjamin Bergen says that nearly all so </v>

45
00:02:18.041 --> 00:02:18.874
<v Speaker 1>called bad or forbidden words fall into </v>
<v Speaker 1>one or more of the following types of </v>

46
00:02:22.121 --> 00:02:22.954
<v Speaker 1>profanity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Holy meaning religious or sacred Glass </v>

47
00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:26.583
<v Speaker 1>Homie,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking meaning relating to sex shit </v>

48
00:02:29.321 --> 00:02:30.154
<v Speaker 1>relating to bodily functions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And finally nigger relating to slurs </v>

49
00:02:33.341 --> 00:02:34.174
<v Speaker 1>towards groups.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Any nasty pejorative to describe groups </v>

50
00:02:36.431 --> 00:02:37.264
<v Speaker 1>of people fall here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now of course some bad words like slut </v>

51
00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:41.643
<v Speaker 1>might fall into multiple categories.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's both a slur about a group and also </v>

52
00:02:45.071 --> 00:02:45.904
<v Speaker 1>a word about sex.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So bear in mind that bad words can fall </v>

53
00:02:48.371 --> 00:02:51.070
<v Speaker 1>into multiple camps.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As a quick note from here out,</v>

54
00:02:51.071 --> 00:02:51.904
<v Speaker 1>as we discuss this principal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll be referring to it as the h f s in </v>

55
00:02:55.541 --> 00:02:57.430
<v Speaker 1>principle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is because one,</v>

56
00:02:57.431 --> 00:02:58.264
<v Speaker 1>it's a mouthful and two,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's safe way to start the conversation </v>

57
00:03:00.581 --> 00:03:03.220
<v Speaker 1>without requiring a disclaimer at the </v>
<v Speaker 1>beginning of your discussion.</v>

58
00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:07.240
<v Speaker 1>So now that we have that out of the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>besides being disconcertingly memorable,</v>

59
00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:11.350
<v Speaker 1>why did Benjamin Bergen find the hfs in </v>
<v Speaker 1>principles so useful?</v>

60
00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:12.633
<v Speaker 1>The answer is because it does a great </v>
<v Speaker 1>job to categorize most swearing and </v>

61
00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:18.490
<v Speaker 1>profanity by the human taboo.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They draw power from,</v>

62
00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:21.580
<v Speaker 1>and this is valuable because while all </v>
<v Speaker 1>our words differ,</v>

63
00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:22.593
<v Speaker 1>the things we described are the same.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's reasonable to suggest that </v>

64
00:03:25.031 --> 00:03:25.864
<v Speaker 1>studying the roots of profanity will </v>
<v Speaker 1>reveal something about the profanity </v>

65
00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:29.763
<v Speaker 1>itself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the first thing you find is that </v>

66
00:03:31.181 --> 00:03:33.700
<v Speaker 1>taboos are definitely tendencies and </v>
<v Speaker 1>culture,</v>

67
00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:34.773
<v Speaker 1>but you also find that they are not </v>
<v Speaker 1>guaranteed to take ruth and the taboos </v>

68
00:03:37.691 --> 00:03:38.524
<v Speaker 1>that had culture does.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Carrie tells you something about their </v>

69
00:03:40.391 --> 00:03:41.680
<v Speaker 1>history.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>

70
00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:42.543
<v Speaker 1>some languages like Cantonese,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Chinese that come from more secular </v>

71
00:03:45.101 --> 00:03:45.934
<v Speaker 1>cultures,</v>
<v Speaker 1>perhaps unsurprisingly don't possess </v>

72
00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:50.470
<v Speaker 1>Coley profanity in their lexicon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They do,</v>

73
00:03:50.471 --> 00:03:51.304
<v Speaker 1>however,</v>
<v Speaker 1>have some swear words about their </v>

74
00:03:52.301 --> 00:03:55.240
<v Speaker 1>ancestors due to their history of </v>
<v Speaker 1>ancestor reverence.</v>

75
00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:56.373
<v Speaker 1>But that's not all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When we look at the top five words that </v>

76
00:03:58.271 --> 00:04:02.110
<v Speaker 1>are considered most defensive in Chinese</v>
<v Speaker 1>known as the outstanding five,</v>

77
00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:06.490
<v Speaker 1>all of them have to do with sex.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we can safely say that Chinese is not</v>

78
00:04:06.491 --> 00:04:09.640
<v Speaker 1>a holy language,</v>
<v Speaker 1>instead primarily a fucking language,</v>

79
00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:10.803
<v Speaker 1>but other languages like Quebecois </v>
<v Speaker 1>French can be considered holy languages </v>

80
00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:16.060
<v Speaker 1>because of their deep Catholic roots.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're profane.</v>

81
00:04:16.061 --> 00:04:19.780
<v Speaker 1>Dictionary has what are called Saccos,</v>
<v Speaker 1>literally meaning consecrations,</v>

82
00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:23.950
<v Speaker 1>which are Catholic liturgical terms like</v>
<v Speaker 1>sacrament that when uttered in the right</v>

83
00:04:23.951 --> 00:04:26.560
<v Speaker 1>context are seen as some of their </v>
<v Speaker 1>strongest swear words.</v>

84
00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:27.963
<v Speaker 1>Deb Neck for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is stronger than their word for fuck or </v>

85
00:04:30.581 --> 00:04:31.900
<v Speaker 1>shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we can say that,</v>

86
00:04:31.901 --> 00:04:34.630
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Quebecois French has F and s words.</v>

87
00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:37.030
<v Speaker 1>It's more of a holy language than </v>
<v Speaker 1>anything else.</v>

88
00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:38.313
<v Speaker 1>Moving on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can also add English to the list of </v>

89
00:04:39.971 --> 00:04:44.020
<v Speaker 1>holy languages coming from a Judeo </v>
<v Speaker 1>Christian religious tradition where it's</v>

90
00:04:44.021 --> 00:04:44.980
<v Speaker 1>like damn or hell.</v>

91
00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:45.873
<v Speaker 1>Obviously our references to religious </v>
<v Speaker 1>ideas and English is an interesting </v>

92
00:04:49.571 --> 00:04:54.520
<v Speaker 1>swearing language in general in that we </v>
<v Speaker 1>are an h f s and in language.</v>

93
00:04:54.790 --> 00:04:55.623
<v Speaker 1>And a good example of the second lesson </v>
<v Speaker 1>we learned from the hfs in principle </v>

94
00:04:58.750 --> 00:04:59.583
<v Speaker 1>within the same culture,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the relative strength of taboos usually </v>

95
00:05:01.901 --> 00:05:04.390
<v Speaker 1>correlates to the relative strength of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the profanity.</v>

96
00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:05.673
<v Speaker 1>So in America for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>both sex and the scatological are </v>

97
00:05:08.861 --> 00:05:11.380
<v Speaker 1>considered taboo,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but of the two of them sexist,</v>

98
00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:13.690
<v Speaker 1>more taboo hints,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fuck and is related.</v>

99
00:05:13.691 --> 00:05:14.524
<v Speaker 1>Cousins are considered more offensive </v>
<v Speaker 1>than shit or ass and all of the taboo </v>

100
00:05:17.961 --> 00:05:20.590
<v Speaker 1>strengths very heavily by culture.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In German,</v>

101
00:05:20.591 --> 00:05:22.750
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this situation is totally reversed.</v>

102
00:05:22.780 --> 00:05:27.220
<v Speaker 1>German is primarily a shit language.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The German word for fuck Israeli used in</v>

103
00:05:27.221 --> 00:05:28.054
<v Speaker 1>swearing instead,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some variant of shit or ass is used </v>

104
00:05:30.521 --> 00:05:33.830
<v Speaker 1>constantly such as the German word for </v>
<v Speaker 1>asshole phase,</v>

105
00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:35.330
<v Speaker 1>born from an ass shit head.</v>

106
00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:38.020
<v Speaker 1>You get the idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now last but not least,</v>

107
00:05:38.050 --> 00:05:40.060
<v Speaker 1>are there similar languages?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

108
00:05:40.061 --> 00:05:42.580
<v Speaker 1>up until recently,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those slurs have been common across many</v>

109
00:05:42.581 --> 00:05:45.550
<v Speaker 1>cultures.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A general taboo around slurs hasn't been</v>

110
00:05:45.551 --> 00:05:46.384
<v Speaker 1>present.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What I mean by this is those slurs were </v>

111
00:05:48.401 --> 00:05:52.210
<v Speaker 1>used for nefarious purposes and to </v>
<v Speaker 1>promote tribalism and ingroup behavior.</v>

112
00:05:52.420 --> 00:05:55.060
<v Speaker 1>They were not considered taboo by the </v>
<v Speaker 1>culture itself,</v>

113
00:05:55.360 --> 00:05:56.193
<v Speaker 1>but in the last century,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a very good argument to make </v>

114
00:05:57.711 --> 00:05:58.544
<v Speaker 1>that in America at least slurs have </v>
<v Speaker 1>quickly become the most universally </v>

115
00:06:01.521 --> 00:06:05.630
<v Speaker 1>powerful taboo we have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and a good question might be why.</v>

116
00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:09.650
<v Speaker 1>Why did we shift and why are some slurs </v>
<v Speaker 1>seen as worse than others?</v>

117
00:06:10.070 --> 00:06:14.630
<v Speaker 1>Let me suggest one possible explanation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The civil rights movement in America did</v>

118
00:06:14.631 --> 00:06:15.464
<v Speaker 1>more than change laws.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They highlighted a history of </v>

119
00:06:17.781 --> 00:06:19.850
<v Speaker 1>disenfranchisement amongst certain </v>
<v Speaker 1>groups,</v>

120
00:06:20.060 --> 00:06:22.430
<v Speaker 1>which none of us really want to think or</v>
<v Speaker 1>talk about.</v>

121
00:06:22.910 --> 00:06:23.743
<v Speaker 1>In other words,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this unseemly part of American history </v>

122
00:06:25.701 --> 00:06:28.970
<v Speaker 1>became taboo.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what happens when we have a powerful</v>

123
00:06:28.971 --> 00:06:31.070
<v Speaker 1>cultural taboo?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

124
00:06:31.071 --> 00:06:31.904
<v Speaker 1>the words that called back to that </v>
<v Speaker 1>uncomfortable history in an </v>

125
00:06:33.801 --> 00:06:34.634
<v Speaker 1>inappropriate way become forbidden.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And once you see that slurs became </v>

126
00:06:37.191 --> 00:06:39.770
<v Speaker 1>powerful when connected with their </v>
<v Speaker 1>historical context,</v>

127
00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:43.010
<v Speaker 1>it's easy to see why in America the </v>
<v Speaker 1>inward is way,</v>

128
00:06:43.011 --> 00:06:45.380
<v Speaker 1>way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>way more offensive to most people.</v>

129
00:06:45.381 --> 00:06:46.214
<v Speaker 1>Then even words like fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whereas if you visit a culture without </v>

130
00:06:49.041 --> 00:06:49.874
<v Speaker 1>the history of slavery,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they wouldn't find that word is </v>

131
00:06:51.201 --> 00:06:53.840
<v Speaker 1>offensive because the word isn't linked </v>
<v Speaker 1>to the history.</v>

132
00:06:57.770 --> 00:07:02.150
<v Speaker 3>What's up my Nigga?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What did you just say?</v>

133
00:07:04.490 --> 00:07:05.900
<v Speaker 3>What's up my Nigga?</v>

134
00:07:11.490 --> 00:07:13.290
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so now that we've talked about the age,</v>

135
00:07:13.291 --> 00:07:14.124
<v Speaker 1>the FDS and the n in hfs in principle,</v>
<v Speaker 1>now let's spend some time talking about </v>

136
00:07:18.900 --> 00:07:22.410
<v Speaker 1>a few exceptions to these roles that we </v>
<v Speaker 1>find scattered across cultures.</v>

137
00:07:22.980 --> 00:07:23.813
<v Speaker 1>Interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cultural variance include profane </v>

138
00:07:24.991 --> 00:07:26.730
<v Speaker 1>language about animals.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In Korea,</v>

139
00:07:26.731 --> 00:07:27.564
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>calling someone a dog is deeply </v>

140
00:07:28.831 --> 00:07:31.500
<v Speaker 1>offensive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's also profanity around disease.</v>

141
00:07:31.501 --> 00:07:32.334
<v Speaker 1>In Dutch,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Profane language includes words for </v>

142
00:07:33.601 --> 00:07:34.610
<v Speaker 1>cancer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>typhoid,</v>

143
00:07:34.620 --> 00:07:35.453
<v Speaker 1>tuberculosis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Often the severity of the disease </v>

144
00:07:37.410 --> 00:07:39.420
<v Speaker 1>emphasizes the strength of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>profanity.</v>

145
00:07:39.870 --> 00:07:44.100
<v Speaker 1>And a final interesting taboo that pops </v>
<v Speaker 1>up sometimes is a taboo around death and</v>

146
00:07:44.101 --> 00:07:46.350
<v Speaker 1>death related words.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>

147
00:07:46.351 --> 00:07:47.184
<v Speaker 1>in some Australian aboriginal cultures </v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't say the name of someone who </v>

148
00:07:49.591 --> 00:07:50.424
<v Speaker 1>has died for up to a year or in more </v>
<v Speaker 1>extreme instances like with the </v>

149
00:07:53.460 --> 00:07:54.293
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] tribe of Columbia.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This same rule is enforced under the </v>

150
00:07:57.091 --> 00:08:00.720
<v Speaker 1>penalty of death.</v>
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

151
00:08:00.750 --> 00:08:03.210
<v Speaker 1>even though are local taboos which buck </v>
<v Speaker 1>the trend,</v>

152
00:08:03.240 --> 00:08:04.073
<v Speaker 1>most of the time when you find stable </v>
<v Speaker 1>profane language it tends to follow the </v>

153
00:08:07.141 --> 00:08:12.141
<v Speaker 1>h f s and if you can look past the </v>
<v Speaker 1>offensive charged words we can't say and</v>

154
00:08:12.451 --> 00:08:16.560
<v Speaker 1>instead examine the taboos themselves,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we learn what is actually going on.</v>

155
00:08:16.620 --> 00:08:17.453
<v Speaker 1>It isn't the words themselves,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the parts of our life that they're </v>

156
00:08:19.651 --> 00:08:23.090
<v Speaker 1>connected to the parts that our society </v>
<v Speaker 1>is uncomfortable with.</v>

157
00:08:24.920 --> 00:08:25.753
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

158
00:08:25.910 --> 00:08:26.743
<v Speaker 4>Yup.</v>

159
00:08:30.920 --> 00:08:31.753
<v Speaker 1>Thank you for watching.</v>

160
00:08:33.951 --> 00:08:34.784
<v Speaker 1>on profanity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>both of which will probably be </v>

161
00:08:36.141 --> 00:08:38.720
<v Speaker 1>demonetized by youtube.</v>
