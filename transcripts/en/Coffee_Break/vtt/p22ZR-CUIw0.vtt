1
00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:06.380
<v Speaker 1>Let me break it down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jay High School,</v>

2
00:00:07.110 --> 00:00:08.730
<v Speaker 1>they don't come through their door and </v>
<v Speaker 1>be good cop.</v>

3
00:00:08.731 --> 00:00:10.200
<v Speaker 1>Bad Cop.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't fall for that.</v>

4
00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:11.123
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>

5
00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:17.520
<v Speaker 2>In Hollywood,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everything important in an interrogation</v>

6
00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:21.270
<v Speaker 2>is seen or heard.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The cops grimace allowed yelling,</v>

7
00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:24.360
<v Speaker 2>treating a suspect hostile.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The light that's way too bright,</v>

8
00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:26.970
<v Speaker 2>but in a real interrogation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's flipped around.</v>

9
00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:31.170
<v Speaker 2>Everything important is unseen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>unheard on the surface.</v>

10
00:00:31.171 --> 00:00:34.770
<v Speaker 2>Real interrogations look boring.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The cop is nice to you.</v>

11
00:00:34.771 --> 00:00:36.910
<v Speaker 2>They give you a drink,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they dressed in plain clothes.</v>

12
00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:37.973
<v Speaker 2>It's almost disarming,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially if this is more of what you </v>

13
00:00:40.171 --> 00:00:41.004
<v Speaker 2>were expecting,</v>

14
00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:47.490
<v Speaker 2>but that's the point.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Under the boring disarming surface of an</v>

15
00:00:47.491 --> 00:00:48.324
<v Speaker 2>interrogation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you find a whole host of psychological </v>

16
00:00:50.641 --> 00:00:54.090
<v Speaker 2>traps and mental tricks that are </v>
<v Speaker 2>designed to make you confess.</v>

17
00:00:54.990 --> 00:00:55.823
<v Speaker 2>It starts from the moment you walk in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Every inch of an interrogation room has </v>

18
00:00:59.101 --> 00:01:01.830
<v Speaker 2>been designed to make you feel isolated </v>
<v Speaker 2>and powerless.</v>

19
00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:03.930
<v Speaker 2>The room is small,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cramped.</v>

20
00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:06.390
<v Speaker 2>The walls are blank and there are no </v>
<v Speaker 2>windows.</v>

21
00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:07.253
<v Speaker 2>You'll be placed in an uncomfortable </v>
<v Speaker 2>straight back off in metal chair while </v>

22
00:01:09.691 --> 00:01:11.550
<v Speaker 2>the cops chair,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we'll be able to roll.</v>

23
00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:15.480
<v Speaker 2>This becomes important later on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The next move is a hurdle that cops have</v>

24
00:01:15.481 --> 00:01:17.070
<v Speaker 2>to get over.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When you go to jail,</v>

25
00:01:17.071 --> 00:01:20.040
<v Speaker 2>a cop is legally required to tell you </v>
<v Speaker 2>you have the right to shut up.</v>

26
00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:22.950
<v Speaker 2>This actually turns out to be the only </v>
<v Speaker 2>great advice you're going to get.</v>

27
00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:26.430
<v Speaker 2>Talking to cops is always a bad move and</v>
<v Speaker 2>for the cop,</v>

28
00:01:26.431 --> 00:01:27.264
<v Speaker 2>what this means is that their first </v>
<v Speaker 2>priority is making you ignore this </v>

29
00:01:29.911 --> 00:01:32.160
<v Speaker 2>advice and go against everything you've </v>
<v Speaker 2>ever heard.</v>

30
00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:34.890
<v Speaker 2>They have to convince you to play the </v>
<v Speaker 2>game with them.</v>

31
00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:38.040
<v Speaker 2>The first questions are deliberately not</v>
<v Speaker 2>about the investigation.</v>

32
00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:40.920
<v Speaker 2>They want to appear trustworthy so that </v>
<v Speaker 2>you'll talk to them about the case.</v>

33
00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:46.280
<v Speaker 1>41 point mama stay downtown.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think I've tried that one yet.</v>

34
00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:48.943
<v Speaker 1>I'm a big coffee.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if you're a coffee guy </v>

35
00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:52.950
<v Speaker 1>right in front of us,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so no,</v>

36
00:01:52.951 --> 00:01:53.990
<v Speaker 1>I appreciate that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>

37
00:01:53.991 --> 00:01:55.670
<v Speaker 1>go ahead.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a plane going up.</v>

38
00:01:57.310 --> 00:01:59.060
<v Speaker 1>You get hungry or anything else,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just let me know.</v>

39
00:01:59.061 --> 00:01:59.894
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How come you get more than one bill </v>

40
00:02:00.951 --> 00:02:01.784
<v Speaker 1>name?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

41
00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:04.043
<v Speaker 1>my uncles and my grandfather,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got to three middle name and that's </v>

42
00:02:08.281 --> 00:02:10.190
<v Speaker 1>really because my parents thought I was </v>
<v Speaker 1>gonna be an only child.</v>

43
00:02:10.290 --> 00:02:11.100
<v Speaker 1>Amy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>after everybody.</v>

44
00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:14.070
<v Speaker 1>So I get named after your grandfather </v>
<v Speaker 1>and two uncles,</v>

45
00:02:14.071 --> 00:02:15.930
<v Speaker 1>so I know what you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know what you're going through there.</v>

46
00:02:15.931 --> 00:02:17.320
<v Speaker 1>Cause my initials,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I get teased about.</v>

47
00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:18.473
<v Speaker 2>The other goal behind these innocent </v>
<v Speaker 2>questions is to establish a behavioral </v>

48
00:02:20.881 --> 00:02:23.280
<v Speaker 2>baseline.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They want to see how you act when you're</v>

49
00:02:23.281 --> 00:02:25.110
<v Speaker 2>telling the truth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Finally,</v>

50
00:02:25.111 --> 00:02:27.570
<v Speaker 2>when they're ready,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they'll ask you something like this.</v>

51
00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:29.410
<v Speaker 3>Well let's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's do this.</v>

52
00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:33.190
<v Speaker 3>You sound like you will.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You won't talk to me.</v>

53
00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:36.520
<v Speaker 3>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want to hear what you have to say.</v>

54
00:02:36.521 --> 00:02:39.400
<v Speaker 3>But before Ashley Quish,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she got to know your rights.</v>

55
00:02:39.401 --> 00:02:42.250
<v Speaker 3>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You have the right to remain silent.</v>

56
00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:43.823
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what this says here is that I've read </v>

57
00:02:46.421 --> 00:02:47.750
<v Speaker 3>you your rights.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you understand them?</v>

58
00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:51.290
<v Speaker 2>Once you're talking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they'll first get a statement about what</v>

59
00:02:51.291 --> 00:02:52.124
<v Speaker 2>happened after hearing it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If the cop thinks you might have done </v>

60
00:02:54.261 --> 00:02:55.094
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If the facts aren't lining up or if </v>

61
00:02:56.001 --> 00:02:56.834
<v Speaker 2>you're acting shady,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they may move to the accusation phase </v>

62
00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:00.303
<v Speaker 2>and the accusation phase.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They will confidently accuse you of the </v>

63
00:03:02.261 --> 00:03:04.780
<v Speaker 2>crime and the cop will say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in no uncertain terms,</v>

64
00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:05.913
<v Speaker 2>you did it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We know you did it and we've got </v>

65
00:03:07.271 --> 00:03:08.110
<v Speaker 2>evidence for it.</v>

66
00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:12.300
<v Speaker 1>Your vehicle drove up the side of </v>
<v Speaker 1>Jessica Lewis House,</v>

67
00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:18.740
<v Speaker 1>your boots walked to the back of Jessica</v>
<v Speaker 1>Lloyd's House on the evening of the 28th</v>

68
00:03:19.681 --> 00:03:20.514
<v Speaker 1>and 29th of January.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You and I both know you were at Jessica </v>

69
00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:27.570
<v Speaker 1>Lloyd toughs and I need to know why,</v>

70
00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:31.443
<v Speaker 2>but here's the catch.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They'll claim they have evidence for </v>

71
00:03:33.941 --> 00:03:36.100
<v Speaker 2>your guilt even when they don't.</v>

72
00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:37.413
<v Speaker 1>This nosy neighbor or whatever we're </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to call on him has monitored and </v>

73
00:03:41.771 --> 00:03:43.710
<v Speaker 1>I'm not going to tell you how.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

74
00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:48.370
<v Speaker 1>just think about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>With today's technology monitored,</v>

75
00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:49.833
<v Speaker 1>what was going on in front of this </v>
<v Speaker 1>residence that they were calling to </v>

76
00:03:52.451 --> 00:03:55.990
<v Speaker 1>complain about until police arrive and I</v>
<v Speaker 1>can prove it.</v>

77
00:03:55.991 --> 00:03:58.300
<v Speaker 1>I can go in front of the judge and say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey look bro,</v>

78
00:03:58.301 --> 00:04:00.670
<v Speaker 1>we want to fucking do you want us to </v>
<v Speaker 1>play this video?</v>

79
00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:02.770
<v Speaker 1>You want us to show you the fingerprint </v>
<v Speaker 1>results?</v>

80
00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:05.820
<v Speaker 1>You want us to show you the gre test on </v>
<v Speaker 1>on this gentleman,</v>

81
00:04:05.821 --> 00:04:07.870
<v Speaker 1>I did not have a firearm in mine hand.</v>

82
00:04:08.460 --> 00:04:11.100
<v Speaker 2>The goal here is to make you think that </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're already caught.</v>

83
00:04:11.101 --> 00:04:11.934
<v Speaker 2>They already have you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why bother resisting and lying about it </v>

84
00:04:14.161 --> 00:04:16.470
<v Speaker 2>when they already know you did it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just confess.</v>

85
00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:18.650
<v Speaker 1>So it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

86
00:04:18.710 --> 00:04:19.543
<v Speaker 1>it's a it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's one of the easiest investigations </v>

87
00:04:21.421 --> 00:04:22.254
<v Speaker 1>I've had.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's fucking there and you can't lie </v>

88
00:04:24.271 --> 00:04:25.104
<v Speaker 1>about that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>bro.</v>

89
00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:29.190
<v Speaker 1>You can't tell us how you then fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>fire that fourth shot anymore.</v>

90
00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:31.440
<v Speaker 1>You can't tell us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We can prove otherwise</v>

91
00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:32.453
<v Speaker 2>during this phase of the interrogation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the interrogator doesn't want you to </v>

92
00:04:35.281 --> 00:04:38.370
<v Speaker 2>deny the crime even though you'll want </v>
<v Speaker 2>to vocalize denials,</v>

93
00:04:38.371 --> 00:04:41.790
<v Speaker 2>reinforces your position.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So Cox make an interesting move.</v>

94
00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:44.880
<v Speaker 2>They try to not let you vocalize Denalis</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the first place.</v>

95
00:04:44.881 --> 00:04:47.550
<v Speaker 2>If possible,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they'll often interrupt you or not.</v>

96
00:04:47.551 --> 00:04:49.890
<v Speaker 2>Stop talking to allow brakes to let you </v>
<v Speaker 2>speak up.</v>

97
00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:51.203
<v Speaker 2>Instead,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they'll keep the pressure on by </v>

98
00:04:52.171 --> 00:04:55.320
<v Speaker 2>reinforcing the idea that they a hundred</v>
<v Speaker 2>percent already have you caught.</v>

99
00:04:55.590 --> 00:04:57.870
<v Speaker 1>I'm giving you an opportunity to listen </v>
<v Speaker 1>to me.</v>

100
00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:00.920
<v Speaker 1>Listen to me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>listen to,</v>

101
00:05:00.980 --> 00:05:01.813
<v Speaker 1>I did not have a firearm in mind.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We can prove that we're beyond that </v>

102
00:05:04.501 --> 00:05:05.334
<v Speaker 1>point,</v>
<v Speaker 1>buddy.</v>

103
00:05:05.540 --> 00:05:07.150
<v Speaker 1>We'll be on that man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

104
00:05:07.190 --> 00:05:09.960
<v Speaker 1>they did not do what you think I did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know you did.</v>

105
00:05:10.010 --> 00:05:11.890
<v Speaker 1>Were passed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>passed.</v>

106
00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:13.910
<v Speaker 2>You know it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They know it.</v>

107
00:05:13.911 --> 00:05:18.380
<v Speaker 2>Let's just drop the charade.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The next phase is themed development.</v>

108
00:05:18.890 --> 00:05:19.723
<v Speaker 2>After accusing someone,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the cops will try to provide themes to </v>

109
00:05:21.741 --> 00:05:25.040
<v Speaker 2>offer moral or psychological </v>
<v Speaker 2>justifications for the crime.</v>

110
00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:26.263
<v Speaker 2>Nobody's going to confess if they think </v>
<v Speaker 2>it makes them look bad or their </v>

111
00:05:28.101 --> 00:05:28.934
<v Speaker 2>dignities at stake.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the cops want to give you a way to </v>

112
00:05:31.221 --> 00:05:35.060
<v Speaker 2>lose without losing face.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This will never be used in your favor.</v>

113
00:05:35.061 --> 00:05:36.950
<v Speaker 2>When the confession goes to trial,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of course,</v>

114
00:05:37.070 --> 00:05:39.470
<v Speaker 2>these are simply mind games that are </v>
<v Speaker 2>used to get the confession.</v>

115
00:05:39.790 --> 00:05:42.430
<v Speaker 1>We sort of believe that it could have </v>
<v Speaker 1>been a fucking accident.</v>

116
00:05:42.850 --> 00:05:45.010
<v Speaker 1>It could have been accidental discharge.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

117
00:05:45.020 --> 00:05:47.280
<v Speaker 1>But when you don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you're completely denying it,</v>

118
00:05:47.281 --> 00:05:49.210
<v Speaker 1>and then I got to think another way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bro,</v>

119
00:05:49.540 --> 00:05:51.190
<v Speaker 1>I don't believe you're a cold blooded </v>
<v Speaker 1>killer.</v>

120
00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:53.380
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't believe that at all.</v>

121
00:05:54.750 --> 00:05:57.200
<v Speaker 1>Nothing's suggested it to me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think you're a smart guy,</v>

122
00:05:57.201 --> 00:05:58.034
<v Speaker 1>and I think you got involved in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>situation that you probably shouldn't </v>

123
00:06:00.231 --> 00:06:01.064
<v Speaker 1>have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a difference between you going </v>

124
00:06:02.301 --> 00:06:05.740
<v Speaker 1>in and saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm gonna kill somebody and you're going</v>

125
00:06:05.741 --> 00:06:07.880
<v Speaker 1>in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm trying to help somebody,</v>

126
00:06:07.881 --> 00:06:11.150
<v Speaker 1>and then shit goes bad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're just waiting different things as</v>

127
00:06:11.151 --> 00:06:13.400
<v Speaker 1>we're talking about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What other options?</v>

128
00:06:14.110 --> 00:06:16.670
<v Speaker 1>I don't think you want the cold blooded </v>
<v Speaker 1>psychopaths function.</v>

129
00:06:18.140 --> 00:06:21.050
<v Speaker 1>I might be wrong because I don't get me </v>
<v Speaker 1>wrong.</v>

130
00:06:21.051 --> 00:06:24.230
<v Speaker 1>I've met guys who actually kind of </v>
<v Speaker 1>enjoyed the notoriety,</v>

131
00:06:24.740 --> 00:06:26.660
<v Speaker 1>got off on it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't see that.</v>

132
00:06:27.640 --> 00:06:29.150
<v Speaker 1>If I saw that you have when he'd be back</v>
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>

133
00:06:29.151 --> 00:06:33.560
<v Speaker 1>you're talking to you quite frankly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but maybe I'm wrong.</v>

134
00:06:33.680 --> 00:06:35.060
<v Speaker 1>Maybe you got me fooled.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

135
00:06:36.880 --> 00:06:38.620
<v Speaker 2>This is where most people start to </v>
<v Speaker 2>break.</v>

136
00:06:38.860 --> 00:06:42.220
<v Speaker 2>Most people often go into a passive mood</v>
<v Speaker 2>when they're about to confess,</v>

137
00:06:42.370 --> 00:06:43.203
<v Speaker 2>looking beat down and acting quiet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is the first time that you'll </v>

138
00:06:46.031 --> 00:06:46.864
<v Speaker 2>seriously start considering confession.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's even a physical tell called the </v>

139
00:06:49.511 --> 00:06:52.810
<v Speaker 2>surrender position that cops look for to</v>
<v Speaker 2>know when you're about to confess.</v>

140
00:06:52.840 --> 00:06:55.180
<v Speaker 2>It looks like this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When the cop sees this,</v>

141
00:06:55.181 --> 00:06:59.110
<v Speaker 2>he will continue to reiterate all the </v>
<v Speaker 2>themes that have been developed so far.</v>

142
00:06:59.710 --> 00:07:00.543
<v Speaker 2>We know you did it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We have evidence and good guys come </v>

143
00:07:03.161 --> 00:07:03.994
<v Speaker 2>clean.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In addition to deploying psychological </v>

144
00:07:05.861 --> 00:07:08.290
<v Speaker 2>measures,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the cup full also deploy physical ones.</v>

145
00:07:08.560 --> 00:07:09.393
<v Speaker 2>Remember that the cops chair can roll </v>
<v Speaker 2>and during this time he will often move </v>

146
00:07:12.851 --> 00:07:13.684
<v Speaker 2>closer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In order to ramp up the tension in the </v>

147
00:07:15.551 --> 00:07:16.384
<v Speaker 2>room,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you will feel trapped like there's </v>

148
00:07:17.831 --> 00:07:18.664
<v Speaker 2>nowhere to go and meanwhile a physically</v>
<v Speaker 2>intimidated cop is telling you that you </v>

149
00:07:23.050 --> 00:07:25.930
<v Speaker 2>have to confess.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You must confess.</v>

150
00:07:26.290 --> 00:07:27.123
<v Speaker 2>Finally,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a moment when the tension that </v>

151
00:07:28.151 --> 00:07:30.670
<v Speaker 2>has been building up for hours finally </v>
<v Speaker 2>breaks.</v>

152
00:07:30.700 --> 00:07:31.750
<v Speaker 2>You can almost see it</v>

153
00:07:37.910 --> 00:07:42.910
<v Speaker 1>minimizing sort of way that'd be do </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

154
00:07:46.960 --> 00:07:49.670
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You start out by telling the truth.</v>

155
00:07:55.190 --> 00:07:56.390
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

156
00:07:58.950 --> 00:08:00.220
<v Speaker 1>where is she man?</v>

157
00:08:04.390 --> 00:08:05.223
<v Speaker 2>And once the cop gets their confession,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's all over your chance of being let </v>

158
00:08:07.631 --> 00:08:08.890
<v Speaker 2>off.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Go to almost zero.</v>

159
00:08:08.891 --> 00:08:09.724
<v Speaker 2>Your plea deals.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Get a lot worse and you have gained </v>

160
00:08:10.841 --> 00:08:11.674
<v Speaker 2>absolutely nothing from the exchange </v>
<v Speaker 2>except for the knowledge of just how </v>

161
00:08:14.321 --> 00:08:17.170
<v Speaker 2>good cops are at beating you in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>interrogation room.</v>

162
00:08:17.910 --> 00:08:21.330
<v Speaker 4>I just think I'd look guilty if I hired </v>
<v Speaker 4>a lawyer.</v>

163
00:08:21.930 --> 00:08:22.763
<v Speaker 4>Actually,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's getting arrested that makes people </v>

164
00:08:25.561 --> 00:08:27.360
<v Speaker 4>look guilty.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Even the innocent ones,</v>

165
00:08:27.361 --> 00:08:31.800
<v Speaker 4>an innocent people get arrested every </v>
<v Speaker 4>day and they find themselves in a little</v>

166
00:08:31.801 --> 00:08:35.730
<v Speaker 4>room with a detective who acts like he's</v>
<v Speaker 4>their best friend.</v>

167
00:08:35.760 --> 00:08:37.170
<v Speaker 4>Talked to me,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he says,</v>

168
00:08:37.630 --> 00:08:39.840
<v Speaker 4>help me clear this thing up,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you don't need a lawyer.</v>

169
00:08:39.841 --> 00:08:42.090
<v Speaker 4>Only guilty people need lawyers and </v>
<v Speaker 4>boom,</v>

170
00:08:42.120 --> 00:08:44.190
<v Speaker 4>hey,</v>
