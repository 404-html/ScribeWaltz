00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:01.043
<v Speaker 1>For as long as there have been poor and </v>
<v Speaker 1>rich people have devised clever ways to </v>

2
00:00:04.531 --> 00:00:07.050
<v Speaker 1>redistribute wealth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whether it be taxes,</v>

3
00:00:07.051 --> 00:00:10.110
<v Speaker 1>political manifestos or buy more </v>
<v Speaker 1>barbaric means,</v>

4
00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:11.243
<v Speaker 1>but you may still be left unsatisfied </v>
<v Speaker 1>with the current system wondering where </v>

5
00:00:14.011 --> 00:00:14.844
<v Speaker 1>is your cut you after all are smarter </v>
<v Speaker 1>than the average person yet stuck with </v>

6
00:00:18.421 --> 00:00:21.300
<v Speaker 1>an average bank account.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Today we're going to change that.</v>

7
00:00:21.301 --> 00:00:22.134
<v Speaker 1>We're cutting corners and making money </v>
<v Speaker 1>moves because there is a business plan </v>

8
00:00:24.961 --> 00:00:25.794
<v Speaker 1>that can create massive amounts of </v>
<v Speaker 1>wealth for you with minimal effort </v>

9
00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:31.260
<v Speaker 1>though you may have to leave a few </v>
<v Speaker 1>ethics at the door.</v>

10
00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:34.320
<v Speaker 1>I'm talking of course about the pyramid </v>
<v Speaker 1>scheme.</v>

11
00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:36.953
<v Speaker 1>Before we begin,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you should know what you're getting </v>

12
00:00:37.771 --> 00:00:38.604
<v Speaker 1>yourself into.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A pyramid scheme is a business blend </v>

13
00:00:40.231 --> 00:00:41.064
<v Speaker 1>where recruits buy in to the scheme by </v>
<v Speaker 1>paying people above them and then can </v>

14
00:00:43.861 --> 00:00:47.370
<v Speaker 1>recruit people below them and profit </v>
<v Speaker 1>from what those new people pay in.</v>

15
00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:51.270
<v Speaker 1>One of the most popular variants of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>scheme is the airplane game and it works</v>

16
00:00:51.271 --> 00:00:53.850
<v Speaker 1>like this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You buy in for $1,500</v>

17
00:00:53.851 --> 00:00:54.684
<v Speaker 1>under someone else as a passenger and </v>
<v Speaker 1>every time the flight gets filled </v>

18
00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:57.863
<v Speaker 1>everyone gets promoted.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Passenger to crew crew to copilot and </v>

19
00:01:00.241 --> 00:01:03.240
<v Speaker 1>copilot to pilot until after a few full </v>
<v Speaker 1>flights.</v>

20
00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.730
<v Speaker 1>You become the pilot and once you have a</v>
<v Speaker 1>full flight,</v>

21
00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:10.680
<v Speaker 1>you finally exit by getting paid $12,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>eight times your original investment.</v>

22
00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:13.650
<v Speaker 1>It sounds easy enough,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's a very serious problem.</v>

23
00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:14.723
<v Speaker 1>This traditional type of pyramid scheme </v>
<v Speaker 1>involving direct buy-ins is illegal in </v>

24
00:01:17.671 --> 00:01:20.820
<v Speaker 1>most modern countries because the </v>
<v Speaker 1>business plan is built on the idea of an</v>

25
00:01:20.821 --> 00:01:21.654
<v Speaker 1>exponential chain of people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is unsustainable living the </v>

26
00:01:23.911 --> 00:01:26.460
<v Speaker 1>majority of the people at the bottom </v>
<v Speaker 1>having lost money,</v>

27
00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:29.580
<v Speaker 1>which is a bummer if you have dreams of </v>
<v Speaker 1>Egyptian polygons,</v>

28
00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.450
<v Speaker 1>but to the less scrupulous among you </v>
<v Speaker 1>fear not for where there's a way to make</v>

29
00:01:33.451 --> 00:01:34.500
<v Speaker 1>money hand over fist.</v>

30
00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:38.520
<v Speaker 1>There's usually a legal way to do that </v>
<v Speaker 1>and that holds true for pyramid schemes.</v>

31
00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:42.330
<v Speaker 1>So here are the six steps to creating a </v>
<v Speaker 1>perfectly legal pyramid scheme.</v>

32
00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:45.310
<v Speaker 1>Step one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>find a product.</v>

33
00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:46.353
<v Speaker 1>Don't worry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't have to be that good of a </v>

34
00:01:47.291 --> 00:01:48.124
<v Speaker 1>product or competitive in the open </v>
<v Speaker 1>market because you're not really going </v>

35
00:01:50.501 --> 00:01:52.530
<v Speaker 1>to be selling this product in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>traditional sense.</v>

36
00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:56.620
<v Speaker 1>A product to a pyramid scheme is more </v>
<v Speaker 1>like poker chips to a casino there.</v>

37
00:01:56.621 --> 00:01:58.840
<v Speaker 1>The legal way you make money change </v>
<v Speaker 1>hands.</v>

38
00:01:59.140 --> 00:01:59.973
<v Speaker 1>Imagine we take the structure of a </v>
<v Speaker 1>pyramid scheme and instead of the buy </v>

39
00:02:01.931 --> 00:02:03.970
<v Speaker 1>end being cash,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you make it a product.</v>

40
00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:05.463
<v Speaker 1>This way you can say you're providing a </v>
<v Speaker 1>good or service to your customers even </v>

41
00:02:08.231 --> 00:02:10.540
<v Speaker 1>if your customers are just the people </v>
<v Speaker 1>working for you.</v>

42
00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:11.643
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there is one thing to think about when </v>

43
00:02:12.581 --> 00:02:13.414
<v Speaker 1>choosing a product in order to pay every</v>
<v Speaker 1>person along the chain of the pyramid </v>

44
00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:18.640
<v Speaker 1>enough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's important that you have high profit</v>

45
00:02:18.641 --> 00:02:22.240
<v Speaker 1>margins and typical wholesale margins </v>
<v Speaker 1>just aren't going to cut it,</v>

46
00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:24.970
<v Speaker 1>so triple the price of your product and </v>
<v Speaker 1>call it premium.</v>

47
00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:26.560
<v Speaker 1>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't worry about demand.</v>

48
00:02:26.561 --> 00:02:29.800
<v Speaker 1>Your employees will be purchasing your </v>
<v Speaker 1>overpriced products hoping to get rich,</v>

49
00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:31.870
<v Speaker 1>not to save money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Step two,</v>

50
00:02:31.871 --> 00:02:32.704
<v Speaker 1>make a payout structure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You might think this should be </v>

51
00:02:34.211 --> 00:02:35.740
<v Speaker 1>straightforward,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but whatever you do,</v>

52
00:02:35.741 --> 00:02:38.170
<v Speaker 1>do not make this simple or </v>
<v Speaker 1>understandable.</v>

53
00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:40.690
<v Speaker 1>You should have two goals in mind when </v>
<v Speaker 1>doing this.</v>

54
00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:41.793
<v Speaker 1>One,</v>
<v Speaker 1>keep most of the profits going to the </v>

55
00:02:42.971 --> 00:02:47.260
<v Speaker 1>top while making people feel like the </v>
<v Speaker 1>bottom has a chance of making it because</v>

56
00:02:47.261 --> 00:02:49.690
<v Speaker 1>poor people need hope to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And secondly,</v>

57
00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:52.810
<v Speaker 1>you need a constant stream of new </v>
<v Speaker 1>recruits joining and buying in,</v>

58
00:02:52.811 --> 00:02:56.860
<v Speaker 1>so make sure the path to wealth is paved</v>
<v Speaker 1>by constantly recruiting other people,</v>

59
00:02:56.890 --> 00:02:57.723
<v Speaker 1>not actually selling the product.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Besides your best customers are people </v>

60
00:03:00.371 --> 00:03:01.204
<v Speaker 1>who work for you anyways.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You've made a good payout structure at </v>

61
00:03:03.481 --> 00:03:04.314
<v Speaker 1>when people feel like making it is </v>
<v Speaker 1>always a year or two away and they felt </v>

62
00:03:07.181 --> 00:03:08.320
<v Speaker 1>like that for five years.</v>

63
00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:09.483
<v Speaker 1>That completes the fundamentals.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You've got your business plan up and </v>

64
00:03:11.381 --> 00:03:13.210
<v Speaker 1>running and now you need some </v>
<v Speaker 1>underlings.</v>

65
00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:16.990
<v Speaker 1>This is where we get to marketing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Selling your pyramid scheme is all about</v>

66
00:03:16.991 --> 00:03:19.810
<v Speaker 1>messaging,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so focus on what your recruits one money</v>

67
00:03:19.811 --> 00:03:22.390
<v Speaker 1>and time freedom,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which brings us to step three,</v>

68
00:03:22.391 --> 00:03:23.224
<v Speaker 1>so a financial fantasy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here's some examples of what that might </v>

69
00:03:26.081 --> 00:03:28.960
<v Speaker 1>look like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you could close your eyes and imagine</v>

70
00:03:28.961 --> 00:03:32.260
<v Speaker 1>your dream lifestyle,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your ideal combination of work and play.</v>

71
00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:35.590
<v Speaker 1>Choose the largest industry in the world</v>
<v Speaker 1>for the biggest opportunity.</v>

72
00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:36.603
<v Speaker 1>Imagine being part of a company that is </v>
<v Speaker 1>created a life changing financial </v>

73
00:03:39.821 --> 00:03:41.350
<v Speaker 1>freedom for people just like it.</v>

74
00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:43.000
<v Speaker 2>Hold on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A golf course,</v>

75
00:03:43.001 --> 00:03:45.730
<v Speaker 2>half a million dollars,</v>
<v Speaker 2>$110,000</v>

76
00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:47.350
<v Speaker 2>a hundred thousand dollars a few </v>
<v Speaker 2>thousand,</v>

77
00:03:47.351 --> 00:03:48.184
<v Speaker 2>a minimum of 10,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the freedom of owning an online </v>

78
00:03:50.471 --> 00:03:52.990
<v Speaker 2>automated business that's priceless.</v>

79
00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:56.120
<v Speaker 1>And bragging about it on the Internet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even more priceless.</v>

80
00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:59.960
<v Speaker 1>But sometimes this fantasy can backfire </v>
<v Speaker 1>if people don't fully believe in.</v>

81
00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:00.853
<v Speaker 1>If that happens,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this top recruiter says you can still </v>

82
00:04:02.361 --> 00:04:03.194
<v Speaker 1>close them by pointing out the problems </v>
<v Speaker 1>in their lives and using it against </v>

83
00:04:06.141 --> 00:04:06.710
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>

84
00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:07.543
<v Speaker 3>One of the biggest things that I teach </v>
<v Speaker 3>is stack up enough problems that they </v>

85
00:04:10.371 --> 00:04:13.640
<v Speaker 3>have in their personal life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And when you compare it to the money,</v>

86
00:04:13.710 --> 00:04:16.040
<v Speaker 3>I say they're in.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

87
00:04:16.041 --> 00:04:19.010
<v Speaker 3>if you found out that right now that </v>
<v Speaker 3>relationship is on the rocks,</v>

88
00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:20.090
<v Speaker 3>we were like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Dang,</v>

89
00:04:20.091 --> 00:04:21.080
<v Speaker 3>dude.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

90
00:04:21.110 --> 00:04:22.010
<v Speaker 3>your relationship,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

91
00:04:22.011 --> 00:04:22.850
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>are you okay with that?</v>

92
00:04:22.851 --> 00:04:24.740
<v Speaker 3>What's gonna happen with the kids?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like who's going to get,</v>

93
00:04:24.741 --> 00:04:28.070
<v Speaker 3>who have you thought about that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So like Joe [inaudible] joint custody.</v>

94
00:04:28.071 --> 00:04:28.970
<v Speaker 3>Is it going to be like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

95
00:04:28.971 --> 00:04:31.070
<v Speaker 3>she got to take half and all of a sudden</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're like,</v>

96
00:04:31.071 --> 00:04:32.930
<v Speaker 3>holy crap,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

97
00:04:32.931 --> 00:04:34.310
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I need a fix this thing.</v>

98
00:04:34.730 --> 00:04:36.050
<v Speaker 3>Now all of a sudden I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

99
00:04:36.051 --> 00:04:37.370
<v Speaker 3>great.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Here's the solution.</v>

100
00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:38.793
<v Speaker 1>All problems can be exploited including </v>
<v Speaker 1>marital struggles and family problems </v>

101
00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:43.143
<v Speaker 1>and all problems can be solved by </v>
<v Speaker 1>joining as a final part of this vision </v>

102
00:04:46.871 --> 00:04:49.930
<v Speaker 1>for the fantasy life till you recruits,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they aren't getting hired.</v>

103
00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:50.793
<v Speaker 1>They're starting their own company.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You should call them independent </v>

104
00:04:53.051 --> 00:04:55.090
<v Speaker 1>business owners for a couple of reasons.</v>
<v Speaker 1>First,</v>

105
00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:58.480
<v Speaker 1>it minimizes your legal liability if </v>
<v Speaker 1>they aren't full employees.</v>

106
00:04:58.750 --> 00:04:59.583
<v Speaker 1>Second,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're going to build a scam off </v>

107
00:05:00.461 --> 00:05:01.294
<v Speaker 1>hope,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's no better source than the </v>

108
00:05:01.871 --> 00:05:04.180
<v Speaker 1>American dream of owning your own </v>
<v Speaker 1>business.</v>

109
00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:06.790
<v Speaker 1>Now it's time to start thinking about </v>
<v Speaker 1>audience.</v>

110
00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:08.770
<v Speaker 1>You don't want to try to appeal to </v>
<v Speaker 1>everyone,</v>

111
00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:09.633
<v Speaker 1>otherwise you will appeal to no one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you have to think about who you want </v>

112
00:05:12.701 --> 00:05:15.880
<v Speaker 1>to target with your message,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which brings us to step four,</v>

113
00:05:16.090 --> 00:05:18.220
<v Speaker 1>the three key groups,</v>
<v Speaker 1>group one,</v>

114
00:05:18.221 --> 00:05:20.470
<v Speaker 1>family and friends.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Biggie smalls once said,</v>

115
00:05:20.471 --> 00:05:22.630
<v Speaker 1>keep your family and business completely</v>
<v Speaker 1>separated.</v>

116
00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:24.550
<v Speaker 1>But Steve Jobs said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>think different.</v>

117
00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:27.130
<v Speaker 1>So while everyone else is following </v>
<v Speaker 1>common sense advice,</v>

118
00:05:27.340 --> 00:05:28.173
<v Speaker 1>you will make a family business and </v>
<v Speaker 1>business and family like someone who </v>

119
00:05:31.061 --> 00:05:31.894
<v Speaker 1>can't help but shoe horn in politics.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They every single conversation you want </v>

120
00:05:34.721 --> 00:05:35.554
<v Speaker 1>to teach your followers that all </v>
<v Speaker 1>conversations can be turned into sales </v>

121
00:05:37.811 --> 00:05:38.644
<v Speaker 1>pitches group to young people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nobody is more gullible and sure of </v>

122
00:05:42.161 --> 00:05:44.950
<v Speaker 1>themselves than an 18 to 22 year old.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So get them while they're hot,</v>

123
00:05:45.190 --> 00:05:48.820
<v Speaker 1>naive and young group three poor people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever you do,</v>

124
00:05:48.850 --> 00:05:52.870
<v Speaker 1>don't waste money targeting big fish.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Rich people don't join pyramid schemes.</v>

125
00:05:52.900 --> 00:05:55.840
<v Speaker 1>They start them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So instead you want to think differently</v>

126
00:05:55.841 --> 00:05:59.750
<v Speaker 1>and go for the poorest you can find.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You'd be shocked with hardworking people</v>

127
00:05:59.751 --> 00:06:03.380
<v Speaker 1>can scrape together if you tell them </v>
<v Speaker 1>success is only a purchase away.</v>

128
00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:04.633
<v Speaker 1>Immigrant families,</v>
<v Speaker 1>poor areas of town or going overseas to </v>

129
00:06:06.711 --> 00:06:07.544
<v Speaker 1>find entire populations of poor people </v>
<v Speaker 1>are all great options as this recruiter </v>

130
00:06:11.211 --> 00:06:12.044
<v Speaker 1>will show.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There really is no such thing as not </v>

131
00:06:13.611 --> 00:06:14.444
<v Speaker 1>having enough money.</v>

132
00:06:14.780 --> 00:06:15.613
<v Speaker 4>Nobody never doesn't have the money to </v>
<v Speaker 4>go to the same job for emergency </v>

133
00:06:25.730 --> 00:06:27.020
<v Speaker 4>purchasing operation.</v>

134
00:06:29.560 --> 00:06:30.393
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know it's your first time and by this </v>

135
00:06:31.661 --> 00:06:32.494
<v Speaker 1>point you may feel a little sick about </v>
<v Speaker 1>all this exploitation and there's no </v>

136
00:06:34.841 --> 00:06:35.674
<v Speaker 1>shame in that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Queasiness is just ethics leaving the </v>

137
00:06:37.511 --> 00:06:38.560
<v Speaker 1>body.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But don't worry,</v>

138
00:06:38.561 --> 00:06:42.490
<v Speaker 1>after your fifth time delivering empty </v>
<v Speaker 1>promises to the hopeful eyes of a single</v>

139
00:06:42.491 --> 00:06:45.550
<v Speaker 1>mother of two,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you really don't feel anything anymore.</v>

140
00:06:46.030 --> 00:06:46.863
<v Speaker 1>And so you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>many of your business counterparts have </v>

141
00:06:48.311 --> 00:06:50.860
<v Speaker 1>already achieved success targeting </v>
<v Speaker 1>Hispanics.</v>

142
00:06:51.010 --> 00:06:52.860
<v Speaker 1>So make sure you're not late to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>party though.</v>

143
00:06:53.140 --> 00:06:55.570
<v Speaker 1>And don't forget to utilize technology </v>
<v Speaker 1>as you do.</v>

144
00:06:55.571 --> 00:06:56.404
<v Speaker 1>So with Google ads,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can target the bottom 50% of </v>

145
00:06:58.931 --> 00:07:01.180
<v Speaker 1>society.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Choose your target demographic,</v>

146
00:07:01.360 --> 00:07:03.880
<v Speaker 1>lower that add rate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and away you go.</v>

147
00:07:04.120 --> 00:07:06.970
<v Speaker 1>So you've got your fundamentals,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've got your marketing and recruiting</v>

148
00:07:06.971 --> 00:07:08.710
<v Speaker 1>done,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've got your Google ads running,</v>

149
00:07:08.890 --> 00:07:12.430
<v Speaker 1>but soon your workers may get burnt out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And to extend their mileage.</v>

150
00:07:12.460 --> 00:07:15.460
<v Speaker 1>It's important to learn how to manage </v>
<v Speaker 1>discontent workers.</v>

151
00:07:15.670 --> 00:07:16.503
<v Speaker 1>This is a vital part of any company,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but especially one where your employees </v>

152
00:07:19.481 --> 00:07:20.314
<v Speaker 1>are doing all the recruiting and buying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And most of them aren't making any </v>

153
00:07:23.081 --> 00:07:24.850
<v Speaker 1>money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Step five,</v>

154
00:07:25.240 --> 00:07:26.073
<v Speaker 1>the training attempt failure event loop.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The way to keep your independent </v>

155
00:07:29.651 --> 00:07:32.140
<v Speaker 1>business owners committed isn't to make </v>
<v Speaker 1>them happy,</v>

156
00:07:32.410 --> 00:07:35.620
<v Speaker 1>but rather keep them thinking success is</v>
<v Speaker 1>right around the corner.</v>

157
00:07:35.830 --> 00:07:38.890
<v Speaker 1>You can do this by first innercising </v>
<v Speaker 1>that proper training takes time.</v>

158
00:07:38.891 --> 00:07:39.724
<v Speaker 1>You'll tell them that learning to be an </v>
<v Speaker 1>effective leader is a process and takes </v>

159
00:07:42.161 --> 00:07:42.994
<v Speaker 1>practice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is followed by an attempt by them </v>

160
00:07:44.531 --> 00:07:46.240
<v Speaker 1>to recruit and sell with minimal </v>
<v Speaker 1>results.</v>

161
00:07:46.241 --> 00:07:47.074
<v Speaker 1>They don't pay much.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They will get down on themselves for </v>

162
00:07:48.551 --> 00:07:52.240
<v Speaker 1>their failure at which point you need to</v>
<v Speaker 1>make sure to step in and throw a massive</v>

163
00:07:52.241 --> 00:07:53.074
<v Speaker 1>pump up event or meeting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's imperative that each of these </v>

164
00:07:55.661 --> 00:07:56.494
<v Speaker 1>meetings,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you have a couple examples of people </v>

165
00:07:57.521 --> 00:07:58.354
<v Speaker 1>who have achieved monetary success with </v>
<v Speaker 1>your scheme because this will signal to </v>

166
00:08:01.721 --> 00:08:02.554
<v Speaker 1>everyone else that they can make it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Prop up those winners on stage and let </v>

167
00:08:05.861 --> 00:08:08.140
<v Speaker 1>the survivorship bias do the talking.</v>

168
00:08:09.970 --> 00:08:11.620
<v Speaker 5>That was awesome.</v>

169
00:08:22.110 --> 00:08:24.240
<v Speaker 1>Anybody can do it should be your </v>
<v Speaker 1>message.</v>

170
00:08:24.780 --> 00:08:25.650
<v Speaker 1>In reality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of course,</v>

171
00:08:25.651 --> 00:08:30.060
<v Speaker 1>studies of over 350 of your competitors </v>
<v Speaker 1>have found that 99.6%</v>

172
00:08:30.061 --> 00:08:33.180
<v Speaker 1>of recruits lose money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But we don't have to tell them that.</v>

173
00:08:33.570 --> 00:08:35.330
<v Speaker 1>Just keep focusing on the winning.</v>

174
00:08:35.590 --> 00:08:36.423
<v Speaker 4>We're going to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which so much you may even get tired of </v>

175
00:08:38.681 --> 00:08:39.880
<v Speaker 4>winning.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I just say,</v>

176
00:08:39.881 --> 00:08:41.290
<v Speaker 4>please,</v>
<v Speaker 4>please,</v>

177
00:08:41.560 --> 00:08:44.680
<v Speaker 4>it's two bucks winning.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We can't take it anymore.</v>

178
00:08:45.350 --> 00:08:48.360
<v Speaker 1>And unfortunately,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some people may get tired of winning and</v>

179
00:08:48.361 --> 00:08:50.910
<v Speaker 1>if that happens,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's time to move to step six.</v>

180
00:08:51.180 --> 00:08:52.013
<v Speaker 1>Cut off the bad apples.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Legal pyramid schemes eventually get a </v>

181
00:08:55.170 --> 00:08:57.360
<v Speaker 1>reputation because they all resemble one</v>
<v Speaker 1>another.</v>

182
00:08:57.390 --> 00:08:59.520
<v Speaker 1>And no matter how much you convince </v>
<v Speaker 1>people that you're different,</v>

183
00:08:59.550 --> 00:09:02.160
<v Speaker 1>you will get a bad reputation in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>world at large,</v>

184
00:09:02.161 --> 00:09:04.260
<v Speaker 1>which can in turn discourage your </v>
<v Speaker 1>recruits.</v>

185
00:09:04.560 --> 00:09:05.393
<v Speaker 1>The way to get around this is not by </v>
<v Speaker 1>denying the bad opinions are out there </v>

186
00:09:08.010 --> 00:09:10.770
<v Speaker 1>instead,</v>
<v Speaker 1>except misdirect and discredit them.</v>

187
00:09:10.860 --> 00:09:12.900
<v Speaker 1>In the past,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people want stock.</v>

188
00:09:12.901 --> 00:09:15.610
<v Speaker 1>The earth was flat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>seems pretty ridiculous,</v>

189
00:09:15.611 --> 00:09:16.540
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>At the time,</v>

190
00:09:17.050 --> 00:09:17.883
<v Speaker 1>people didn't know any differently.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The same can be said for the direct </v>

191
00:09:20.741 --> 00:09:22.950
<v Speaker 1>selling and multilevel marketing </v>
<v Speaker 1>industry.</v>

192
00:09:22.951 --> 00:09:27.550
<v Speaker 1>So when comparing legitimate direct </v>
<v Speaker 1>selling companies to a pyramid scheme or</v>

193
00:09:27.610 --> 00:09:31.870
<v Speaker 1>any type of scam will seem as ridiculous</v>
<v Speaker 1>as the earth being flat.</v>

194
00:09:33.030 --> 00:09:36.120
<v Speaker 1>You've done a good job when you don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>have to look over your workers shoulders</v>

195
00:09:36.330 --> 00:09:39.450
<v Speaker 1>you've taught them to monitor for hate </v>
<v Speaker 1>themselves and they will go out of their</v>

196
00:09:39.451 --> 00:09:43.320
<v Speaker 1>own way to avoid negative opinions about</v>
<v Speaker 1>your company all on their own.</v>

197
00:09:44.610 --> 00:09:48.460
<v Speaker 1>Once you have these six steps handled,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you will at last be a successful illegal</v>

198
00:09:48.480 --> 00:09:50.910
<v Speaker 1>pyramid scheme,</v>
<v Speaker 1>controlling millions of workers,</v>

199
00:09:50.911 --> 00:09:51.744
<v Speaker 1>paying pennies on the dollar for worth </v>
<v Speaker 1>this products you sell back to your </v>

200
00:09:54.241 --> 00:09:55.074
<v Speaker 1>workers at triple the price workers who,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well trying to make their own fortune </v>

201
00:09:58.011 --> 00:10:02.450
<v Speaker 1>don't realize they're busy building </v>
<v Speaker 1>doors off nothing but hope alone.</v>

202
00:10:02.480 --> 00:10:03.313
<v Speaker 1>You have designed a wealth </v>
<v Speaker 1>redistribution system of such hubris </v>

203
00:10:06.140 --> 00:10:10.400
<v Speaker 1>that Marx himself ought to be envious </v>
<v Speaker 1>except your taking from the mediocre and</v>

204
00:10:10.401 --> 00:10:13.080
<v Speaker 1>giving to those who truly deserve it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You,</v>

205
00:10:13.430 --> 00:10:17.750
<v Speaker 1>you who have sacrificed everything,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ethics and all for this dream,</v>

206
00:10:18.170 --> 00:10:20.750
<v Speaker 1>this dream of being successful,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of having it all.</v>

207
00:10:20.960 --> 00:10:22.910
<v Speaker 1>And finally you can taste it.</v>

208
00:10:23.970 --> 00:10:24.803
<v Speaker 4>Ah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>ah,</v>

209
00:10:24.990 --> 00:10:25.910
<v Speaker 4>ah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>ah,</v>

210
00:10:26.140 --> 00:10:27.110
<v Speaker 4>ah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>ah,</v>

211
00:10:27.780 --> 00:10:32.010
<v Speaker 4>ah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>ah,</v>

212
00:10:39.910 --> 00:10:40.743
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

213
00:10:41.360 --> 00:10:42.860
<v Speaker 1>oh got a little carried away there.</v>

214
00:10:48.740 --> 00:10:49.573
<v Speaker 1>I've got a few more things to say at the</v>
<v Speaker 1>end of this video and also a word from </v>

<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

234
00:11:45.411 --> 00:11:47.960
<v Speaker 1>so back to pyramid schemes real quick </v>
<v Speaker 1>before you go,</v>

235
00:11:48.390 --> 00:11:49.800
<v Speaker 1>pause,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pause.</v>

236
00:11:49.950 --> 00:11:51.770
<v Speaker 1>I'm at the end of editing this video.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You probably could.</v>

237
00:11:52.540 --> 00:11:54.280
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I realized</v>

238
00:11:54.280 --> 00:11:59.050
<v Speaker 6>I didn't say explicitly that this is </v>
<v Speaker 6>sarcastic or kind of sad tire.</v>

239
00:11:59.350 --> 00:12:02.950
<v Speaker 6>I know I probably shouldn't have to say </v>
<v Speaker 6>that because it's rather obvious but um,</v>

240
00:12:03.070 --> 00:12:05.500
<v Speaker 6>I don't know if 2019 we'll have sarcasm </v>
<v Speaker 6>anymore.</v>

241
00:12:05.501 --> 00:12:06.880
<v Speaker 6>So yes,</v>
<v Speaker 6>yes,</v>

242
00:12:06.970 --> 00:12:08.890
<v Speaker 6>it is sad to her.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Don't do that.</v>

243
00:12:08.891 --> 00:12:12.310
<v Speaker 6>Don't start a pyramid scheme.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I just wanted to be explicit about it so</v>

244
00:12:12.311 --> 00:12:14.100
<v Speaker 6>no one could misunderstand me.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>
