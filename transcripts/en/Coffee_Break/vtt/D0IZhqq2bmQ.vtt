1
00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:00.893
<v Speaker 1>Signing credit card receipts or one of </v>
<v Speaker 1>those antiquated systems of record </v>

2
00:00:02.971 --> 00:00:06.570
<v Speaker 1>keeping that use to make more sense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but now through preservation of only the</v>

3
00:00:06.571 --> 00:00:07.404
<v Speaker 1>tradition and not the purpose has lost </v>
<v Speaker 1>most of its meaning and desperately </v>

4
00:00:09.991 --> 00:00:10.824
<v Speaker 1>needs to be replaced.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kind of like that collection of vhs </v>

5
00:00:13.051 --> 00:00:13.884
<v Speaker 1>tapes you still have from the 90s even </v>
<v Speaker 1>though you no longer have a vhs player </v>

6
00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:17.063
<v Speaker 1>to understand this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's go back to the credit card </v>

7
00:00:18.091 --> 00:00:19.170
<v Speaker 1>receipt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Glory days.</v>

8
00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:23.040
<v Speaker 1>Actually we have to rewind a little bit </v>
<v Speaker 1>before that and talk about credit.</v>

9
00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:28.150
<v Speaker 1>As a rule,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people hate spending money but they love</v>

10
00:00:28.151 --> 00:00:28.984
<v Speaker 1>getting stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People will spend more if they don't </v>

11
00:00:30.071 --> 00:00:30.904
<v Speaker 1>have to spend now but can get stuff now </v>
<v Speaker 1>and businesses love getting more money </v>

12
00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:34.533
<v Speaker 1>even if they have get it later.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is where the idea of a tab or </v>

13
00:00:36.751 --> 00:00:38.640
<v Speaker 1>credit comes from.</v>
<v Speaker 1>At first lines of credit,</v>

14
00:00:38.641 --> 00:00:40.230
<v Speaker 1>we're limited in where they can be used.</v>

15
00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:41.333
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes I borrow would give you a coin</v>
<v Speaker 1>or token is proof of you being a loyal </v>

16
00:00:43.171 --> 00:00:44.004
<v Speaker 1>customer and lets you build a tab and </v>
<v Speaker 1>their bar or a gas station would give </v>

17
00:00:45.961 --> 00:00:46.794
<v Speaker 1>you a paper card as credit to a few </v>
<v Speaker 1>exclusive stores within the area and it </v>

18
00:00:49.531 --> 00:00:50.364
<v Speaker 1>built in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't do protection existed because </v>

19
00:00:51.451 --> 00:00:52.284
<v Speaker 1>in most of these places everyone in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>town knew everybody so they would know </v>

20
00:00:55.171 --> 00:00:56.790
<v Speaker 1>if the card wasn't held by the right </v>
<v Speaker 1>person,</v>

21
00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.580
<v Speaker 1>but as they need for a more universal </v>
<v Speaker 1>credit system came about,</v>

22
00:00:59.581 --> 00:01:00.414
<v Speaker 1>credit card issuers had to find some way</v>
<v Speaker 1>of securing their cars to protect </v>

23
00:01:02.431 --> 00:01:03.870
<v Speaker 1>against fraud.</v>
<v Speaker 1>After all,</v>

24
00:01:03.871 --> 00:01:06.870
<v Speaker 1>if you're from Ohio and someone uses </v>
<v Speaker 1>your card in New York,</v>

25
00:01:06.871 --> 00:01:08.550
<v Speaker 1>how's the merchant to no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it isn't you.</v>

26
00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:11.280
<v Speaker 1>So this is where the signature on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>back of your card comes in.</v>

27
00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:12.573
<v Speaker 1>Merchant has you sign your credit card </v>
<v Speaker 1>receipt and is supposed to check it to </v>

28
00:01:14.761 --> 00:01:16.720
<v Speaker 1>signatures matched to prove it is really</v>
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>

29
00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:17.783
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even when that system kind of made </v>

30
00:01:18.751 --> 00:01:19.584
<v Speaker 1>sense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it had all sorts of flaws in comparing </v>

31
00:01:20.881 --> 00:01:21.714
<v Speaker 1>signatures properly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>takes too much time with the average </v>

32
00:01:23.371 --> 00:01:24.204
<v Speaker 1>clerk isn't a signature expert and </v>
<v Speaker 1>because your signature is right on the </v>

33
00:01:26.251 --> 00:01:27.084
<v Speaker 1>back of the card,</v>
<v Speaker 1>any industrious thief could just </v>

34
00:01:28.351 --> 00:01:31.950
<v Speaker 1>practice your signature for a day before</v>
<v Speaker 1>actually going out on a spending spree.</v>

35
00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:33.713
<v Speaker 1>But this system makes even less sense </v>
<v Speaker 1>now because when's the last time anyone </v>

36
00:01:36.211 --> 00:01:37.800
<v Speaker 1>actually compared your signatures like </v>
<v Speaker 1>that?</v>

37
00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:42.420
<v Speaker 1>So why do we still have to sign?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It all has to do with blame.</v>

38
00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:43.493
<v Speaker 1>If merchants don't have you signed and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you decide that you wanted to speak to </v>

39
00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:46.313
<v Speaker 1>charge,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the credit card company will make the </v>

40
00:01:47.401 --> 00:01:49.770
<v Speaker 1>merchant reimburse it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if they did make you sign,</v>

41
00:01:49.771 --> 00:01:53.130
<v Speaker 1>they can say they used reasonable fraud </v>
<v Speaker 1>prevention methods to verify that it was</v>

42
00:01:53.131 --> 00:01:54.300
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In that case,</v>

43
00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:56.850
<v Speaker 1>either you or the credit card company,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it would have to pay.</v>

44
00:01:57.300 --> 00:01:59.520
<v Speaker 1>But let's not get lost in business </v>
<v Speaker 1>buzzwords here.</v>

45
00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:00.383
<v Speaker 1>It's important to note that what </v>
<v Speaker 1>everyone considers to be reasonable </v>

46
00:02:02.821 --> 00:02:06.420
<v Speaker 1>fraud prevention is not reasonable at </v>
<v Speaker 1>all because they never checked.</v>

47
00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:09.240
<v Speaker 1>If your signature matches anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let me give you an analogy.</v>

48
00:02:09.510 --> 00:02:10.343
<v Speaker 1>Imagine bars were tired of the time it </v>
<v Speaker 1>takes to individually check everyone's </v>

49
00:02:12.571 --> 00:02:13.404
<v Speaker 1>Id that the government tells them they </v>
<v Speaker 1>still need to check if everyone's 21 </v>

50
00:02:15.451 --> 00:02:16.284
<v Speaker 1>because the law says so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So in efforts of reasonable age </v>

51
00:02:18.601 --> 00:02:20.220
<v Speaker 1>identification,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they ask everyone,</v>

52
00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:22.710
<v Speaker 1>are you 21 and if they say yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they can drink,</v>

53
00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:24.263
<v Speaker 1>this system would help the barb prove </v>
<v Speaker 1>that they were trying to stop underage </v>

54
00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:27.083
<v Speaker 1>drinking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the actual results would be the </v>

55
00:02:28.531 --> 00:02:31.860
<v Speaker 1>equivalent of having no check it all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's my point.</v>

56
00:02:31.861 --> 00:02:32.694
<v Speaker 1>Your credit card signature is equivalent</v>
<v Speaker 1>to no signature at all because it will </v>

57
00:02:34.981 --> 00:02:36.960
<v Speaker 1>never stop anyone from using your credit</v>
<v Speaker 1>card.</v>

58
00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:39.300
<v Speaker 1>So what do we do about it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

59
00:02:39.301 --> 00:02:40.134
<v Speaker 1>the good news is technology is making </v>
<v Speaker 1>fraud protection easier and better than </v>

60
00:02:42.751 --> 00:02:43.680
<v Speaker 1>ever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And Europe,</v>

61
00:02:43.681 --> 00:02:44.514
<v Speaker 1>they rolled out a chip and pin system,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which requires a pin every time you try </v>

62
00:02:47.441 --> 00:02:48.274
<v Speaker 1>to buy something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is at least as fast as signing a </v>

63
00:02:49.651 --> 00:02:51.930
<v Speaker 1>receipt and actually has some real </v>
<v Speaker 1>security in it.</v>

64
00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:54.480
<v Speaker 1>But in America,</v>
<v Speaker 1>although we've adopted the chip cards,</v>

65
00:02:54.481 --> 00:02:58.620
<v Speaker 1>we're still using our signature system.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why you ask one credit card company,</v>

66
00:02:58.650 --> 00:02:59.650
<v Speaker 1>explain the kiss.</v>

67
00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:10.030
<v Speaker 1>If you can possibly ignore the dripping </v>
<v Speaker 1>condescension in the statement.</v>

68
00:03:10.031 --> 00:03:10.864
<v Speaker 1>What it boils down to is that you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>only going to get a credit card with </v>

69
00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:16.000
<v Speaker 1>actual security when you want it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And for that to happen,</v>

70
00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:19.330
<v Speaker 1>people everywhere need to realize that </v>
<v Speaker 1>the story of the signature is a lie.</v>

71
00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:22.870
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't protect you and worse,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it breeds a false sense of security in a</v>

72
00:03:22.871 --> 00:03:25.060
<v Speaker 1>system that needed to be replaced </v>
<v Speaker 1>decades ago.</v>
