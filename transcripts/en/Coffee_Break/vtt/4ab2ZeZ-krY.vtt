00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:02.070
<v Speaker 1>If you've ever worked in a corporate </v>
<v Speaker 1>setting before,</v>

2
00:00:02.071 --> 00:00:04.410
<v Speaker 1>corporate jargon is a familiar,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hated fact of life.</v>

3
00:00:04.590 --> 00:00:06.180
<v Speaker 1>Stuff like this can be pretty </v>
<v Speaker 1>frustrating.</v>

4
00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:07.373
<v Speaker 1>I will.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Company has a new strategic initiative </v>

5
00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:12.540
<v Speaker 1>to increase market penetration,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maximize brand loyalty.</v>

6
00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:15.653
<v Speaker 1>It's easy to wonder if there isn't a </v>
<v Speaker 1>simpler way to communicate at work and </v>

7
00:00:18.421 --> 00:00:19.254
<v Speaker 1>it seems like the higher up in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>corporate ladder you go the worst the </v>

8
00:00:21.001 --> 00:00:21.834
<v Speaker 1>jargon gets.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Managers are perhaps the most notorious </v>

9
00:00:24.091 --> 00:00:24.924
<v Speaker 1>for this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I'm not criticizing technical </v>

10
00:00:26.161 --> 00:00:26.994
<v Speaker 1>jargon,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is necessary to describe specific </v>

11
00:00:28.441 --> 00:00:31.110
<v Speaker 1>details in every industry and </v>
<v Speaker 1>criticizing fluff jargon,</v>

12
00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:31.973
<v Speaker 1>corporate speak,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the kind of vague lexicon that makes up </v>

13
00:00:33.841 --> 00:00:37.290
<v Speaker 1>so much of office working life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It isn't just inefficient.</v>

14
00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:40.380
<v Speaker 1>It allows for confusion and corruption </v>
<v Speaker 1>to hide in plain sight.</v>

15
00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:43.440
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are valid reasons to say this,</v>

16
00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:47.340
<v Speaker 1>keep things high level and then go after</v>
<v Speaker 1>the low hanging fruit,</v>

17
00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:50.070
<v Speaker 1>but there aren't that many reasons.</v>

18
00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:51.203
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes it's to soften bad news.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're restructuring and optimizing </v>

19
00:00:54.031 --> 00:00:54.864
<v Speaker 1>capital.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Location sounds a lot better than we're </v>

20
00:00:56.101 --> 00:00:56.934
<v Speaker 1>firing people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're a great candidate with a lot of </v>

21
00:00:58.501 --> 00:01:01.740
<v Speaker 1>exciting prospects is a better intro to </v>
<v Speaker 1>a job rejection letter.</v>

22
00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:04.140
<v Speaker 1>Then the truth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you weren't qualified enough.</v>

23
00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:06.570
<v Speaker 1>Other times it's to sound more </v>
<v Speaker 1>professional.</v>

24
00:01:06.571 --> 00:01:09.840
<v Speaker 1>Let's double down on our 80 20 </v>
<v Speaker 1>operations sounds a lot more respectable</v>

25
00:01:09.841 --> 00:01:12.450
<v Speaker 1>than let's do more of the stuff that </v>
<v Speaker 1>makes us money.</v>

26
00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:15.450
<v Speaker 1>These are all legitimate ways to use </v>
<v Speaker 1>corporate jargon,</v>

27
00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:16.523
<v Speaker 1>but mashed together too much corporate </v>
<v Speaker 1>speak and it can render speech and </v>

28
00:01:18.841 --> 00:01:21.270
<v Speaker 1>writing all but incomprehensible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

29
00:01:21.271 --> 00:01:22.104
<v Speaker 1>as a testament to this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Andrew Davidson made a corporate lingo </v>

30
00:01:24.061 --> 00:01:27.090
<v Speaker 1>generator online that spits out </v>
<v Speaker 1>professional sounding gibberish.</v>

31
00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:28.133
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have robust networks of strategic </v>

32
00:01:29.731 --> 00:01:32.610
<v Speaker 1>assets that we own or have contractual </v>
<v Speaker 1>access to,</v>

33
00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:33.593
<v Speaker 1>which gives us greater flexibility and </v>
<v Speaker 1>speed to reliably deliver widespread </v>

34
00:01:36.301 --> 00:01:37.440
<v Speaker 1>logistical solutions.</v>

35
00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:38.663
<v Speaker 1>We have metamorphosed from an asset </v>
<v Speaker 1>based pipeline and power generating </v>

36
00:01:40.741 --> 00:01:44.580
<v Speaker 1>company to a marketing and logistic </v>
<v Speaker 1>company whose biggest assets are.</v>

37
00:01:44.581 --> 00:01:45.414
<v Speaker 1>It's well established business approach </v>
<v Speaker 1>and innovative people and this is </v>

38
00:01:47.521 --> 00:01:50.220
<v Speaker 1>exactly where corporate lingo and jargon</v>
<v Speaker 1>has a dark side.</v>

39
00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:53.580
<v Speaker 1>It allows people to hide things in plain</v>
<v Speaker 1>sight without anyone noticing.</v>

40
00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:56.700
<v Speaker 1>As I read that randomly generated </v>
<v Speaker 1>statement full of jargon in your eyes,</v>

41
00:01:56.701 --> 00:01:57.534
<v Speaker 1>probably glazed over a little.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You probably didn't pay that close of </v>

42
00:01:59.461 --> 00:02:00.294
<v Speaker 1>attention,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's exactly what the people </v>

43
00:02:01.411 --> 00:02:03.630
<v Speaker 1>writing or saying these things want or </v>
<v Speaker 1>expect.</v>

44
00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:05.760
<v Speaker 1>They're designed that way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

45
00:02:05.761 --> 00:02:08.670
<v Speaker 1>what I just read wasn't from Andrew </v>
<v Speaker 1>Davidson sites at all.</v>

46
00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:11.640
<v Speaker 1>It was jeff skillings final letter to </v>
<v Speaker 1>the Enron shareholders,</v>

47
00:02:11.641 --> 00:02:13.320
<v Speaker 1>reassuring them that everything was </v>
<v Speaker 1>fine.</v>

48
00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:15.270
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right before it went under as one of the</v>

49
00:02:15.271 --> 00:02:17.340
<v Speaker 1>most blatant and fraudulent companies of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the decade,</v>

50
00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:20.220
<v Speaker 1>and it isn't just using business.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In this clip,</v>

51
00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:21.083
<v Speaker 1>Jack a off and infamous lobbyist in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Washington reflects on some of the </v>

52
00:02:24.001 --> 00:02:26.730
<v Speaker 1>tricks of language he used to get things</v>
<v Speaker 1>done for his clients.</v>

53
00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:32.320
<v Speaker 2>What we did was we crafted language that</v>
<v Speaker 2>was so obscure,</v>

54
00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:35.360
<v Speaker 2>so confusing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so uninformative,</v>

55
00:02:35.361 --> 00:02:40.361
<v Speaker 2>but so precise to change the u s k </v>
<v Speaker 2>here's what you tried to get tacked onto</v>

56
00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:42.800
<v Speaker 2>this reform bill.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

57
00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:48.220
<v Speaker 2>Public law 100 dash 89 is amended by </v>
<v Speaker 2>striking section two oh seven Perrin one</v>

58
00:02:50.091 --> 00:02:55.091
<v Speaker 2>o one step period six six eight comma </v>
<v Speaker 2>six seven to close parenth right now.</v>

59
00:02:56.151 --> 00:02:57.440
<v Speaker 2>Isn't that obvious what that means?</v>

60
00:02:57.800 --> 00:02:59.170
<v Speaker 1>Ah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that's,</v>

61
00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:00.100
<v Speaker 1>you tried</v>

62
00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:01.420
<v Speaker 2>to get inserted.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

63
00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:03.520
<v Speaker 2>And that was going to provide for </v>
<v Speaker 2>casino?</v>

64
00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:04.413
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and who on earth is going to know that </v>

65
00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:07.293
<v Speaker 2>no one except the chairman of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>committees and it was deliberately </v>

66
00:03:09.551 --> 00:03:11.050
<v Speaker 2>written like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Precisely.</v>

67
00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:12.900
<v Speaker 2>Precisely.</v>

68
00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:16.720
<v Speaker 1>That's what's so interesting about this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The word choice is precise.</v>

69
00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:17.583
<v Speaker 1>The meaning intentionally vague.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes pages of documents are </v>

70
00:03:20.501 --> 00:03:23.860
<v Speaker 1>dedicated to hiding one message within </v>
<v Speaker 1>the white noise of platitudes.</v>

71
00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:25.023
<v Speaker 1>That's the old,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you didn't read the fine print trope in </v>

72
00:03:26.681 --> 00:03:29.650
<v Speaker 1>movies like the social network and it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>how people get Zuckerberg.</v>

73
00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:31.083
<v Speaker 1>Interestingly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the noise of corporate jargon is </v>

74
00:03:32.651 --> 00:03:33.484
<v Speaker 1>measurable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In 1946 a man named Dr Rudolph Flesch </v>

75
00:03:36.041 --> 00:03:39.070
<v Speaker 1>designed a formula to calculate how </v>
<v Speaker 1>easily understood something is.</v>

76
00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:40.990
<v Speaker 1>It's called the flesch readability </v>
<v Speaker 1>score.</v>

77
00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:43.480
<v Speaker 1>The higher the score,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the easier to read and comprehend.</v>

78
00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:45.280
<v Speaker 1>The lower the score,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the more difficult it is.</v>

79
00:03:45.490 --> 00:03:46.323
<v Speaker 1>Just a few landmarks to think about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Newspaper Comic scored at 93 sports </v>

80
00:03:48.971 --> 00:03:53.590
<v Speaker 1>illustrated at 63 the Wall Street </v>
<v Speaker 1>Journal 43 and the irs tax code.</v>

81
00:03:53.591 --> 00:03:54.424
<v Speaker 1>The holy book of confusing corporate </v>
<v Speaker 1>jargon comes in at an impressive </v>

82
00:03:56.771 --> 00:03:58.660
<v Speaker 1>negative six.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now.</v>

83
00:03:58.690 --> 00:03:59.523
<v Speaker 1>Obviously there are complex ideas that </v>
<v Speaker 1>can never be expressed within 90 plus </v>

84
00:04:02.171 --> 00:04:03.004
<v Speaker 1>readability score,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but most complex ideas can be expressed </v>

85
00:04:05.471 --> 00:04:06.304
<v Speaker 1>in the 30 to 50 range,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is considered to be difficult </v>

86
00:04:08.141 --> 00:04:08.974
<v Speaker 1>reading below 30 the flesh formula </v>
<v Speaker 1>considers the document to be very </v>

87
00:04:12.041 --> 00:04:12.874
<v Speaker 1>confusing.</v>

88
00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:15.460
<v Speaker 1>Now let's get back to corruption in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>book.</v>

89
00:04:15.461 --> 00:04:16.294
<v Speaker 1>Why business people speak like idiots.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The authors use this flesch readability </v>

90
00:04:19.181 --> 00:04:23.260
<v Speaker 1>test to analyze the shareholder letters </v>
<v Speaker 1>from ceos at the turn of the century.</v>

91
00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:24.483
<v Speaker 1>They analyze a set of well respected </v>
<v Speaker 1>companies and a set of companies that </v>

92
00:04:26.951 --> 00:04:29.590
<v Speaker 1>have been riddled with scandal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As it turns out,</v>

93
00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:33.460
<v Speaker 1>the admired companies all have letters </v>
<v Speaker 1>in the 40 range of readability.</v>

94
00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:34.443
<v Speaker 1>While the companies that had scandals </v>
<v Speaker 1>all had much more confusing letters </v>

95
00:04:36.941 --> 00:04:37.774
<v Speaker 1>coming in at the 20s and below,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's because the companies were </v>

96
00:04:39.921 --> 00:04:40.754
<v Speaker 1>scandals have every incentive to be very</v>
<v Speaker 1>confusing and used vague jargon to do </v>

97
00:04:44.411 --> 00:04:45.244
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>While a company that has legitimate </v>

98
00:04:46.421 --> 00:04:49.150
<v Speaker 1>business practices has every reason to </v>
<v Speaker 1>be forthcoming,</v>

99
00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:50.080
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

100
00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:53.560
<v Speaker 1>obviously not all confusing jargon is </v>
<v Speaker 1>meant to hide corruption,</v>

101
00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:54.693
<v Speaker 1>but when there is corruption to hide </v>
<v Speaker 1>corporate language is a great way to do </v>

102
00:04:57.401 --> 00:04:58.234
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can say a lot without saying </v>

103
00:04:59.081 --> 00:05:02.110
<v Speaker 1>anything at all or say everything while </v>
<v Speaker 1>making it sound like nothing.</v>

104
00:05:02.290 --> 00:05:03.123
<v Speaker 1>So let's stop circumventing the normally</v>
<v Speaker 1>understood value added lexicon with </v>

105
00:05:06.431 --> 00:05:09.190
<v Speaker 1>derivative proxies and instead talk </v>
<v Speaker 1>normal.</v>

106
00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:13.170
<v Speaker 1>By the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're interested,</v>

107
00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:14.033
<v Speaker 1>there's a political movement called the </v>
<v Speaker 1>plain language movement who have voiced </v>

108
00:05:16.411 --> 00:05:18.270
<v Speaker 1>a lot of the concerns that you heard in </v>
<v Speaker 1>this video.</v>

109
00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:20.630
<v Speaker 1>You can check out their website in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>description below.</v>

110
00:05:21.970 --> 00:05:24.130
<v Speaker 3>Oh.</v>
