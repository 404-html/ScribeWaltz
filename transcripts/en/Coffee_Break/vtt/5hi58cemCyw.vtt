<v Speaker 1>The link is down below.</v>

22
00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:57.740
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

23
00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:01.170
<v Speaker 3>Welcome to New York.</v>

24
00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:07.110
<v Speaker 1>So I tried shooting this intro live </v>
<v Speaker 1>several times,</v>

25
00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:09.990
<v Speaker 1>but each time I miserably failed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So let me start again.</v>

26
00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:11.933
<v Speaker 1>This is an interview show called coffee </v>
<v Speaker 1>with where I have interesting </v>

27
00:01:14.161 --> 00:01:17.940
<v Speaker 1>conversations over coffee with youtube </v>
<v Speaker 1>or anyone that's interesting.</v>

28
00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:21.030
<v Speaker 1>This is the first episode where but </v>
<v Speaker 1>amazing will scooter,</v>

29
00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:23.580
<v Speaker 1>but before we get to who he is and start</v>
<v Speaker 1>the show,</v>

30
00:01:23.581 --> 00:01:25.770
<v Speaker 1>I want to tell you why I created coffee </v>
<v Speaker 1>with,</v>

31
00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:28.800
<v Speaker 1>now that I finished the interview and </v>
<v Speaker 1>have had time to collect my thoughts.</v>

32
00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:30.450
<v Speaker 1>If you don't know me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I run coffee,</v>

33
00:01:30.451 --> 00:01:32.640
<v Speaker 1>break a video as a channel where I break</v>
<v Speaker 1>down big ideas,</v>

34
00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:33.713
<v Speaker 1>but besides being a creator myself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm also a really big fan of other </v>

35
00:01:36.391 --> 00:01:37.224
<v Speaker 1>youtubers that break down big ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love when someone can teach complex </v>

36
00:01:40.321 --> 00:01:41.154
<v Speaker 1>ideas and are on the cutting edge of </v>
<v Speaker 1>using media to do so and I want to talk </v>

37
00:01:44.521 --> 00:01:46.320
<v Speaker 1>with some of these people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>discuss their ideas,</v>

38
00:01:46.321 --> 00:01:48.120
<v Speaker 1>inspirations and origins.</v>

39
00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:49.433
<v Speaker 1>Usually these people are behind a </v>
<v Speaker 1>curtain and professionalism and their </v>

40
00:01:51.541 --> 00:01:53.730
<v Speaker 1>videos,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if you strip that away and just talk</v>

41
00:01:53.731 --> 00:01:54.564
<v Speaker 1>with them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you find that there unexpectedly witty </v>

42
00:01:56.671 --> 00:01:57.504
<v Speaker 1>or funny or kind,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I want to show that over a cup of </v>

43
00:01:59.881 --> 00:02:02.880
<v Speaker 1>coffee.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This will be available as a podcast,</v>

44
00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:06.210
<v Speaker 1>as a video interview on Youtube and </v>

51
00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:25.770
<v Speaker 1>It's a little slow going at first,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think we hit our stride toward the</v>

52
00:02:25.771 --> 00:02:28.590
<v Speaker 1>middle and some really cool stuff comes </v>
<v Speaker 1>out of the conversation.</v>
