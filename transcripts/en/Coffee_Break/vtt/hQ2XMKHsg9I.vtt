00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:04.230
<v Speaker 1>The stories we tell ourselves,</v>
<v Speaker 1>echo affecting our behavior and what our</v>

2
00:00:04.231 --> 00:00:08.280
<v Speaker 1>future stories will eventually say.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Rebounding from expectations to action,</v>

3
00:00:08.430 --> 00:00:09.263
<v Speaker 1>bringing to life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We are creatures that live on </v>

4
00:00:11.401 --> 00:00:12.234
<v Speaker 1>narratives,</v>
<v Speaker 1>entertained by the stories we hear and </v>

5
00:00:14.251 --> 00:00:17.940
<v Speaker 1>directed by the stories we believe about</v>
<v Speaker 1>ourselves and our world.</v>

6
00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:19.643
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're convinced you're not a runner </v>

7
00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:22.193
<v Speaker 1>and you don't enjoy running,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you will prove yourself right because </v>

8
00:00:24.151 --> 00:00:25.950
<v Speaker 1>you're unlikely to lace up every morning</v>
<v Speaker 1>to run.</v>

9
00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:29.760
<v Speaker 1>If you don't believe the goal you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>chasing is attainable and that will lead</v>

10
00:00:29.761 --> 00:00:30.594
<v Speaker 1>you to drop out of high school cross </v>
<v Speaker 1>country after less than a couple of </v>

11
00:00:32.701 --> 00:00:35.130
<v Speaker 1>weeks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>siding dubious claims of an inability to</v>

12
00:00:35.131 --> 00:00:38.100
<v Speaker 1>get up early enough in the morning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Alternatively,</v>

13
00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:41.490
<v Speaker 1>if four years later,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're a silly experiment in college kid</v>

14
00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:42.353
<v Speaker 1>and you try playing a sound bite in your</v>
<v Speaker 1>head everyday that despite your history </v>

15
00:00:44.791 --> 00:00:45.624
<v Speaker 1>of failure at rapid bipedal locomotion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're actually a runner at heart and </v>

16
00:00:48.841 --> 00:00:49.674
<v Speaker 1>you love it.</v>

17
00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:51.840
<v Speaker 1>In that case,</v>
<v Speaker 1>since you're a runner who loves running,</v>

18
00:00:51.990 --> 00:00:52.823
<v Speaker 1>you're probably going to get out there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which given a few months training will </v>

19
00:00:55.261 --> 00:00:57.630
<v Speaker 1>make your fictional narrative come to </v>
<v Speaker 1>fruition.</v>

20
00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:01.710
<v Speaker 1>I'm bringing this up because it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>valuable to know that to some extent you</v>

21
00:01:01.711 --> 00:01:05.760
<v Speaker 1>can decide what stories you believe and </v>
<v Speaker 1>in turn live with meaning.</v>

22
00:01:05.761 --> 00:01:06.594
<v Speaker 1>If you want to say pick up the guitar,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it might be worth mentally doing some </v>

23
00:01:09.331 --> 00:01:10.164
<v Speaker 1>work to tell yourself a story that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're a guitar player instead of </v>

24
00:01:12.781 --> 00:01:16.050
<v Speaker 1>thinking of yourself as just another </v>
<v Speaker 1>person with a guitar in the closet.</v>

25
00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:17.393
<v Speaker 1>This shift in mindset,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you believe it can have a profound </v>

26
00:01:19.651 --> 00:01:20.484
<v Speaker 1>impact in the way that you relate to </v>
<v Speaker 1>that instrument and how much you </v>

27
00:01:22.861 --> 00:01:23.694
<v Speaker 1>practice over the next few years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's worth noting here that this isn't </v>

28
00:01:26.821 --> 00:01:30.180
<v Speaker 1>some secret that will miraculously make </v>
<v Speaker 1>you able to achieve anything.</v>

29
00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:31.223
<v Speaker 1>This is just a way to use the power that</v>
<v Speaker 1>stories have in making our identity to </v>

30
00:01:34.351 --> 00:01:35.184
<v Speaker 1>help you get into the right type of </v>
<v Speaker 1>behavioral patterns for the results you </v>

31
00:01:37.561 --> 00:01:38.394
<v Speaker 1>want.</v>
<v Speaker 1>More than just at the beginner level </v>

32
00:01:39.751 --> 00:01:42.900
<v Speaker 1>though at the highest level of </v>
<v Speaker 1>competition and performance,</v>

33
00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:43.943
<v Speaker 1>storytelling seems to matter the most </v>
<v Speaker 1>because there's a level of focus </v>

34
00:01:46.531 --> 00:01:50.580
<v Speaker 1>required that almost demands a narrative</v>
<v Speaker 1>that has nothing to do with reality.</v>

35
00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:51.893
<v Speaker 1>Here's Arnold Schwarzenegger talking </v>
<v Speaker 1>about this concept on Tim Ferriss's </v>

36
00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:57.090
<v Speaker 1>podcast for how he won his first junior,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mr Europe.</v>

37
00:01:57.510 --> 00:01:58.343
<v Speaker 2>It was so clear to me that you were </v>
<v Speaker 2>going to win and that you knew or </v>

38
00:02:00.691 --> 00:02:03.690
<v Speaker 2>believed you were going to win.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Your face was so confident.</v>

39
00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:08.660
<v Speaker 2>Where did that confidence come from?</v>
<v Speaker 2>My confidence came from my vision.</v>

40
00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:12.110
<v Speaker 2>If you have a very clear vision of where</v>
<v Speaker 2>you want to go,</v>

41
00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:17.950
<v Speaker 2>then the rest of it is much easier </v>
<v Speaker 2>because you know always why you training</v>

42
00:02:18.131 --> 00:02:18.964
<v Speaker 2>five hours a day,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you always know why you pushing and </v>

43
00:02:20.861 --> 00:02:21.694
<v Speaker 2>going through the pain barrier.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I see myself clearly on that stage </v>

44
00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:30.720
<v Speaker 2>winning the Mr Universe as cms itself,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very clearly of getting the trophy,</v>

45
00:02:31.081 --> 00:02:32.640
<v Speaker 2>standing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>debit the trophy,</v>

46
00:02:32.641 --> 00:02:33.474
<v Speaker 2>raising it above my head,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and having hundreds of bodybuilders </v>

47
00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:38.710
<v Speaker 2>around me on stage,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

48
00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:39.593
<v Speaker 2>looking up and idolizing me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>including the thousands of people that </v>

49
00:02:41.701 --> 00:02:42.534
<v Speaker 2>are watching the event.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there was always made clear vision </v>

50
00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:46.790
<v Speaker 2>and that always inspired me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

51
00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:47.820
<v Speaker 2>to go all out.</v>

52
00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:51.530
<v Speaker 1>Now he relates to this concept through </v>
<v Speaker 1>visualization and vision,</v>

53
00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:52.393
<v Speaker 1>but this is just the kind of </v>
<v Speaker 1>storytelling about the future and this </v>

54
00:02:54.831 --> 00:02:55.664
<v Speaker 1>deliberate storytelling was the key to </v>
<v Speaker 1>his success because before he had won </v>

55
00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:01.450
<v Speaker 1>first competition,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you were an outsider looking in,</v>

56
00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:05.410
<v Speaker 1>arnold had no reason to be that </v>
<v Speaker 1>confident except for his internal story.</v>

57
00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:07.450
<v Speaker 1>He was enrolled in the military,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was poor,</v>

58
00:03:07.451 --> 00:03:10.960
<v Speaker 1>and he wasn't bodyboarding full time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Most impartial observers would have seen</v>

59
00:03:10.961 --> 00:03:11.794
<v Speaker 1>his dream is a bad bet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you can't train five hours a day on </v>

60
00:03:14.891 --> 00:03:15.724
<v Speaker 1>a bad bet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can only train that much if you </v>

61
00:03:17.441 --> 00:03:19.690
<v Speaker 1>believe that you're destined to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>number one.</v>

62
00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:21.183
<v Speaker 1>And he believed that and because he </v>
<v Speaker 1>believed that he trained as if it were </v>

63
00:03:23.891 --> 00:03:24.724
<v Speaker 1>true,</v>
<v Speaker 1>eventually making the story as true in </v>

64
00:03:26.321 --> 00:03:30.730
<v Speaker 1>the real world as it was in his head.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now this doesn't just apply to athletics</v>

65
00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:31.593
<v Speaker 1>or skills,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's just a sphere where it's easiest </v>

66
00:03:33.101 --> 00:03:34.180
<v Speaker 1>to see how this works.</v>

67
00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:36.880
<v Speaker 1>The same is true of our beliefs about </v>
<v Speaker 1>the world.</v>

68
00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:39.220
<v Speaker 1>If you tell yourself that the world is </v>
<v Speaker 1>cruel,</v>

69
00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:40.083
<v Speaker 1>you might subconsciously explain away </v>
<v Speaker 1>good things happening is just setting </v>

70
00:03:42.791 --> 00:03:43.624
<v Speaker 1>you up to fall harder to later and </v>
<v Speaker 1>explain bad things happening as part of </v>

71
00:03:46.511 --> 00:03:50.620
<v Speaker 1>a raked chaotic system that inexorably </v>
<v Speaker 1>is leading you to a cold grave.</v>

72
00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:52.810
<v Speaker 1>You can also tell a much different </v>
<v Speaker 1>story,</v>

73
00:03:52.990 --> 00:03:53.823
<v Speaker 1>but the world is on the whole good,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which will lead you to a much different </v>

74
00:03:56.231 --> 00:03:57.064
<v Speaker 1>interpretation of the data,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a much brighter and happier </v>

75
00:03:59.411 --> 00:04:01.900
<v Speaker 1>interpretation I might add.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's your choice.</v>

76
00:04:01.901 --> 00:04:02.734
<v Speaker 1>What narrative you believe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even in the face of seemingly difficult </v>

77
00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:06.093
<v Speaker 1>experience.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Take Malala who chose to believe in a </v>

78
00:04:08.681 --> 00:04:12.850
<v Speaker 1>narrative of love and forgiveness even </v>
<v Speaker 1>after being attacked by the Taliban.</v>

79
00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:14.293
<v Speaker 3>So you were shot in the face at 15 years</v>
<v Speaker 3>old and you have no anger towards the </v>

80
00:04:20.451 --> 00:04:22.550
<v Speaker 3>man who shot you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How is that possible?</v>

81
00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:25.870
<v Speaker 4>I think they made a big mistake,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

82
00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:26.963
<v Speaker 4>because I was fighting for the right of </v>
<v Speaker 4>education right from the beginning when </v>

83
00:04:29.551 --> 00:04:31.530
<v Speaker 4>the Taliban stop cars from going to </v>
<v Speaker 4>school.</v>

84
00:04:31.890 --> 00:04:35.550
<v Speaker 4>But I had this little bit of fear that </v>
<v Speaker 4>what would happen to me?</v>

85
00:04:35.551 --> 00:04:39.180
<v Speaker 4>How would I feel if someone it takes me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But after that incident,</v>

86
00:04:39.181 --> 00:04:41.490
<v Speaker 4>when I was attacked,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that fear just went away.</v>

87
00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:46.110
<v Speaker 4>And as I said in my speech at the United</v>
<v Speaker 4>Nations that my weakness,</v>

88
00:04:46.111 --> 00:04:50.580
<v Speaker 4>my fear and my hopelessness died on that</v>
<v Speaker 4>day and I became stronger than before.</v>

89
00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:51.693
<v Speaker 1>Rather than responding with rage,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she uses it as fuel to double down on </v>

90
00:04:54.881 --> 00:04:57.040
<v Speaker 1>her courage,</v>
<v Speaker 1>belief and hope for the world.</v>

91
00:04:58.060 --> 00:04:58.893
<v Speaker 1>Just like in the world of skills,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the philosophical narratives you </v>

92
00:05:00.911 --> 00:05:05.170
<v Speaker 1>subscribed to have affects on more than </v>
<v Speaker 1>just the internal interpreted experience</v>

93
00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:10.030
<v Speaker 1>because that interpreted experience then</v>
<v Speaker 1>bins back and behaves in the world.</v>

94
00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:11.133
<v Speaker 1>So if you expect the bad,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you might just experience more of it </v>

95
00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:15.230
<v Speaker 1>because you find yourself frowning at </v>
<v Speaker 1>others,</v>

96
00:05:15.231 --> 00:05:18.220
<v Speaker 1>suspecting them and being guarded.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Conversely,</v>

97
00:05:18.250 --> 00:05:21.810
<v Speaker 1>if you expect the good,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you just might find it like Malala did.</v>

98
00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:26.230
<v Speaker 1>Stories we tell ourselves are more than </v>
<v Speaker 1>just important fables.</v>

99
00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:27.273
<v Speaker 1>They make up the fabric of our identity </v>
<v Speaker 1>and influence the dance of the main </v>

100
00:05:30.311 --> 00:05:32.710
<v Speaker 1>actor in our story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So listen,</v>

101
00:05:32.711 --> 00:05:33.544
<v Speaker 1>look and read broadly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But we have to carefully curate the </v>

102
00:05:36.281 --> 00:05:38.740
<v Speaker 1>stories in our libraries that we tell </v>
<v Speaker 1>ourselves.</v>

103
00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:42.610
<v Speaker 1>Knowing that the next chapter will </v>
<v Speaker 1>reflect the last one we read.</v>

104
00:05:43.540 --> 00:05:46.330
<v Speaker 1>Curiously,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the idea that you can change your future</v>

105
00:05:46.331 --> 00:05:50.110
<v Speaker 1>story by believing a different one is </v>
<v Speaker 1>itself a kind of narrative.</v>

106
00:05:50.470 --> 00:05:51.303
<v Speaker 1>Is this idea nothing more than an </v>
<v Speaker 1>idealistic fairy tale or will you add </v>

107
00:05:54.881 --> 00:05:57.380
<v Speaker 1>this to your library?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's up to you.</v>

108
00:06:05.070 --> 00:06:05.903
<v Speaker 1>I haven't gone in a quick thank you to </v>
<v Speaker 1>those of you who have supported me on </v>

109
00:06:20.180 --> 00:06:21.013
<v Speaker 1>Patrion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thank you for allowing me to tell </v>

110
00:06:22.701 --> 00:06:25.220
<v Speaker 1>stories that I think are rich and </v>
<v Speaker 1>valuable.</v>

111
00:06:25.490 --> 00:06:27.530
<v Speaker 1>These are the stories in my library.</v>
