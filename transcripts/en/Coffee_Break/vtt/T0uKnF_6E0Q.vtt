00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:03.060
<v Speaker 1>The school of life is a youtube channel,</v>
<v Speaker 1>online business and physical school that</v>

2
00:00:03.061 --> 00:00:06.210
<v Speaker 1>professors to teach people about </v>
<v Speaker 1>philosophy and emotional intelligence,</v>

3
00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:07.103
<v Speaker 1>but unfortunately they fall far short of</v>
<v Speaker 1>their own standard to the point it's </v>

4
00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:10.043
<v Speaker 1>almost offensive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The problem with the school of life is </v>

5
00:00:12.070 --> 00:00:13.980
<v Speaker 1>threefold.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They pretend to be unbiased.</v>

6
00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:14.933
<v Speaker 1>They're selling a shallow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>narrow view of philosophy and they are </v>

7
00:00:16.921 --> 00:00:18.810
<v Speaker 1>relentless profit tears in the worst </v>
<v Speaker 1>possible way,</v>

8
00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:21.330
<v Speaker 1>but first,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who exactly is the school of life?</v>

9
00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:24.210
<v Speaker 1>I say who because while many people work</v>
<v Speaker 1>for the school of life,</v>

10
00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:25.860
<v Speaker 1>one man in particular,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the founder,</v>

11
00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:27.840
<v Speaker 1>the main creator of most of their </v>
<v Speaker 1>content,</v>

12
00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:29.393
<v Speaker 1>alon to Bhutan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're unfamiliar with Alonda </v>

13
00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:32.033
<v Speaker 1>Bhutan's work,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's a sort of self stylized pop </v>

14
00:00:33.601 --> 00:00:34.434
<v Speaker 1>philosopher,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but his works are really more something </v>

15
00:00:35.971 --> 00:00:36.804
<v Speaker 1>like opinion pieces on life with a </v>
<v Speaker 1>ragtag assortment of philosophy </v>

16
00:00:38.941 --> 00:00:39.774
<v Speaker 1>sprinkled in some of his works include </v>
<v Speaker 1>how to think more about sex art as </v>

17
00:00:43.051 --> 00:00:44.490
<v Speaker 1>therapy on love.</v>

18
00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:45.803
<v Speaker 1>If you're thinking that you already </v>
<v Speaker 1>sounds closer to oprah than he does to </v>

19
00:00:47.491 --> 00:00:48.324
<v Speaker 1>aristotle,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's not far from the opinion of many </v>

20
00:00:49.621 --> 00:00:52.200
<v Speaker 1>others.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Alon is a polarizing figure.</v>

21
00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:53.063
<v Speaker 1>He's in disrepute by many philosophers </v>
<v Speaker 1>as well as many book reviewers who both </v>

22
00:00:55.831 --> 00:00:56.664
<v Speaker 1>criticized him for Lauren,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his books to appeal to a mass market </v>

23
00:00:58.441 --> 00:00:59.820
<v Speaker 1>crowd.</v>
<v Speaker 1>On the other hand,</v>

24
00:00:59.821 --> 00:01:01.920
<v Speaker 1>his books have been widely sold and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>school of life,</v>

25
00:01:01.921 --> 00:01:02.754
<v Speaker 1>his brainchild,</v>
<v Speaker 1>both one of the biggest audiences for </v>

26
00:01:04.411 --> 00:01:05.244
<v Speaker 1>any philosophy channel on Youtube and </v>
<v Speaker 1>Alon is important to understand because </v>

27
00:01:08.431 --> 00:01:11.040
<v Speaker 1>he is the father of many of the ideas </v>
<v Speaker 1>pedaled from the school of life,</v>

28
00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:13.320
<v Speaker 1>but now that we're clear on who's behind</v>
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

29
00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:15.210
<v Speaker 1>let's get on with the problems at the </v>
<v Speaker 1>school of life.</v>

30
00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:16.313
<v Speaker 1>Number one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they pretend to be unbiased and this is </v>

31
00:01:18.271 --> 00:01:19.980
<v Speaker 1>what started my dislike of the school of</v>
<v Speaker 1>life.</v>

32
00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:21.143
<v Speaker 1>They pretend to be unbiased,</v>
<v Speaker 1>will actually having a very particular </v>

33
00:01:22.921 --> 00:01:24.720
<v Speaker 1>world view and perspective on </v>
<v Speaker 1>philosophy.</v>

34
00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:27.540
<v Speaker 1>Here's such a claim in their intro </v>
<v Speaker 1>video.</v>

35
00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:28.433
<v Speaker 1>What is the school of life?</v>
<v Speaker 1>This school of life and openminded </v>

36
00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:33.903
<v Speaker 1>rigorous on ideological organization.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's hear that again and open minded </v>

37
00:01:37.531 --> 00:01:39.810
<v Speaker 1>and rigorous on ideological </v>
<v Speaker 1>organization,</v>

38
00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:43.440
<v Speaker 1>openminded and an ideological,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then when you click on their videos,</v>

39
00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:44.303
<v Speaker 1>all you get is a constant stream of </v>
<v Speaker 1>alonzo values and thoughts without even </v>

40
00:01:47.041 --> 00:01:47.874
<v Speaker 1>the slightest critique of them as an </v>
<v Speaker 1>example are open minded and an </v>

41
00:01:50.821 --> 00:01:53.520
<v Speaker 1>ideological organization has this to say</v>
<v Speaker 1>about children.</v>

42
00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:55.830
<v Speaker 1>It's almost a biological level.</v>

43
00:01:56.290 --> 00:01:58.840
<v Speaker 2>Kids will kill the relationship that </v>
<v Speaker 2>produce them.</v>

44
00:01:59.370 --> 00:02:02.010
<v Speaker 1>I don't know where Alon gets this </v>
<v Speaker 1>massive chip on his shoulder,</v>

45
00:02:02.011 --> 00:02:04.980
<v Speaker 1>but not all kids are harbingers of doom </v>
<v Speaker 1>to a relationship,</v>

46
00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:06.930
<v Speaker 1>but maintaining the status of being </v>
<v Speaker 1>unbiased.</v>

47
00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:11.080
<v Speaker 1>Alon also manages to quash several </v>
<v Speaker 1>millennia of debate with this nuance,</v>

48
00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:12.990
<v Speaker 1>an ideological statement about religion,</v>

49
00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:16.770
<v Speaker 2>what religion teachers isn't about </v>
<v Speaker 2>what's true,</v>

50
00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:21.210
<v Speaker 2>but about what many of us here on earth </v>
<v Speaker 2>desperately wanted to be true.</v>

51
00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:24.420
<v Speaker 1>Openminded,</v>
<v Speaker 1>rigorous on ideological organization.</v>

52
00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:27.330
<v Speaker 2>Religious beliefs are of course </v>
<v Speaker 2>technically falls,</v>

53
00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:28.423
<v Speaker 2>but that coming from a very tender and </v>
<v Speaker 2>vulnerable place which needs our </v>

54
00:02:31.981 --> 00:02:32.814
<v Speaker 2>empathy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Of course atheists are technically </v>

55
00:02:34.951 --> 00:02:35.784
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there's no point getting mad and by </v>

56
00:02:37.561 --> 00:02:40.140
<v Speaker 2>the apparent irrationality of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>religious</v>

57
00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:41.400
<v Speaker 1>pack up your bags,</v>
<v Speaker 1>boys,</v>

58
00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:44.070
<v Speaker 1>Alon and the crack team of philosophers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>At the school of life,</v>

59
00:02:44.071 --> 00:02:46.740
<v Speaker 1>have it all figured out and I wanted to </v>
<v Speaker 1>be clear,</v>

60
00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:49.560
<v Speaker 1>I don't have a problem with the school </v>
<v Speaker 1>of life producing a video like this.</v>

61
00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:50.603
<v Speaker 1>They're welcome to their opinion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but don't tell your viewer that you're </v>

62
00:02:52.321 --> 00:02:53.154
<v Speaker 1>open minded and an ideological so while </v>
<v Speaker 1>the school of life claims to be </v>

63
00:02:56.011 --> 00:02:57.420
<v Speaker 1>unbiased,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they make videos.</v>

64
00:02:57.421 --> 00:02:59.830
<v Speaker 1>They give a singular,</v>
<v Speaker 1>narrow ideological answer to some of the</v>

65
00:02:59.831 --> 00:03:02.620
<v Speaker 1>most important philosophical questions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>At their best.</v>

66
00:03:02.621 --> 00:03:04.870
<v Speaker 1>This means they're self deceptive and </v>
<v Speaker 1>saying that they are unbiased.</v>

67
00:03:04.871 --> 00:03:05.704
<v Speaker 1>At worst,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they are deliberately misleading their </v>

68
00:03:06.641 --> 00:03:08.920
<v Speaker 1>audience in order to gain the appearance</v>
<v Speaker 1>of objectivity,</v>

69
00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:13.480
<v Speaker 1>and in this one point I think alon just </v>
<v Speaker 1>might be a philosopher in the definition</v>

70
00:03:13.481 --> 00:03:16.720
<v Speaker 1>of nature himself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nisha had this to say about philosophers</v>

71
00:03:16.721 --> 00:03:18.850
<v Speaker 1>and their prejudices.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Philosophers,</v>

72
00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:21.550
<v Speaker 1>they're all advocates who do not wish to</v>
<v Speaker 1>be regarded as such.</v>

73
00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:25.540
<v Speaker 1>Generally astute defenders also have </v>
<v Speaker 1>their prejudices which they dove is true</v>

74
00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:29.560
<v Speaker 1>problem to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're selling bad philosophy.</v>

75
00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:30.723
<v Speaker 1>They do this by delivering a shallow </v>
<v Speaker 1>reductionist viewpoint that lets people </v>

76
00:03:32.981 --> 00:03:33.814
<v Speaker 1>stoke a sense of pseudo intellectual ism</v>
<v Speaker 1>and spares them from the pains of </v>

77
00:03:36.101 --> 00:03:37.990
<v Speaker 1>contradiction to be found in many </v>
<v Speaker 1>worldviews.</v>

78
00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:39.153
<v Speaker 1>Many defenders of the school of life </v>
<v Speaker 1>might say that they are best viewed as </v>

79
00:03:41.081 --> 00:03:41.914
<v Speaker 1>an introduction to philosophy and a </v>
<v Speaker 1>seven minute video on plato can't </v>

80
00:03:43.931 --> 00:03:47.770
<v Speaker 1>possibly be expected to carry everything</v>
<v Speaker 1>that he said and I would agree with you,</v>

81
00:03:47.771 --> 00:03:49.870
<v Speaker 1>but that's not what bothers me about the</v>
<v Speaker 1>school of life's work.</v>

82
00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:52.210
<v Speaker 1>The problem is instead of conveying a </v>
<v Speaker 1>true,</v>

83
00:03:52.211 --> 00:03:54.640
<v Speaker 1>albeit simplistic view of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>philosophers ideas,</v>

84
00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:55.803
<v Speaker 1>many times instead they extract a </v>
<v Speaker 1>philosopher's ideas and mesh them into </v>

85
00:03:58.691 --> 00:04:00.940
<v Speaker 1>their viewpoint until they resemble some</v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of self help.</v>

86
00:04:00.941 --> 00:04:03.340
<v Speaker 1>Nonsense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is not at all how the philosophers</v>

87
00:04:03.341 --> 00:04:04.390
<v Speaker 1>work was meant to be taken.</v>

88
00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:05.710
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with Plato,</v>

89
00:04:05.711 --> 00:04:06.544
<v Speaker 1>they can turn them into a dating coach </v>
<v Speaker 1>offering the following relationship </v>

90
00:04:08.801 --> 00:04:11.110
<v Speaker 1>advice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Second big idea.</v>

91
00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:14.710
<v Speaker 1>Let your lover change you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That sounds weird.</v>

92
00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:15.603
<v Speaker 1>If you think that love means finding </v>
<v Speaker 1>someone who wants you just the way you </v>

93
00:04:18.461 --> 00:04:19.294
<v Speaker 1>are in the symposium,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Plato's play about a dinner party where </v>

94
00:04:22.931 --> 00:04:25.690
<v Speaker 1>a group of friends drink too much and </v>
<v Speaker 1>get talking about love,</v>

95
00:04:25.691 --> 00:04:26.980
<v Speaker 1>sex,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and relationships.</v>

96
00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:30.430
<v Speaker 1>Plato says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>True Love is admiration,</v>

97
00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:32.860
<v Speaker 1>and on the surface it seems like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

98
00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:34.480
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe plato did say that,</v>

99
00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:35.403
<v Speaker 1>but the point is they're totally </v>
<v Speaker 1>contorting the author's work and </v>

100
00:04:36.890 --> 00:04:37.723
<v Speaker 1>achievement played his major </v>
<v Speaker 1>contribution to philosophy or his </v>

101
00:04:39.851 --> 00:04:40.684
<v Speaker 1>theories of forum,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dialectical method and political </v>

102
00:04:42.311 --> 00:04:44.350
<v Speaker 1>theories,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not his thoughts and the ladies.</v>

103
00:04:44.530 --> 00:04:46.720
<v Speaker 1>If you're going to reduce a philosopher </v>
<v Speaker 1>down to seven minutes,</v>

104
00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:47.583
<v Speaker 1>at least fill it with their major </v>
<v Speaker 1>contributions to the philosophical </v>

105
00:04:49.451 --> 00:04:52.330
<v Speaker 1>world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and sometimes they do worse than this in</v>

106
00:04:52.331 --> 00:04:54.610
<v Speaker 1>this video,</v>
<v Speaker 1>along completely misunderstands the mind</v>

107
00:04:54.611 --> 00:04:55.444
<v Speaker 1>body problem,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is the question of how our mental </v>

108
00:04:57.071 --> 00:04:59.320
<v Speaker 1>thought and consciousness controls our </v>
<v Speaker 1>physical body.</v>

109
00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:01.270
<v Speaker 1>Completely missing this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Instead,</v>

110
00:05:01.290 --> 00:05:02.890
<v Speaker 1>alon explains that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>

111
00:05:02.891 --> 00:05:03.724
<v Speaker 1>it's a darn shame that everyone judges </v>
<v Speaker 1>you so much on your luck's instead of </v>

112
00:05:05.831 --> 00:05:06.664
<v Speaker 1>what's in your head.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The so called mind body problem is one </v>

113
00:05:10.871 --> 00:05:14.770
<v Speaker 1>of the greatest and most quietly painful</v>
<v Speaker 1>conundrums in philosophy.</v>

114
00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:18.130
<v Speaker 1>The problem is rooted in the fact that </v>
<v Speaker 1>in the eyes of other people,</v>

115
00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:23.170
<v Speaker 1>all of us are automatically and stop and</v>
<v Speaker 1>associated with our bodies,</v>

116
00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:24.393
<v Speaker 1>which includes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of course our faces and this kind of </v>

117
00:05:26.561 --> 00:05:28.630
<v Speaker 1>feel good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Philosophy is more than just unhelpful.</v>

118
00:05:28.631 --> 00:05:29.464
<v Speaker 1>It's counterproductive because it can </v>
<v Speaker 1>cause people to think that they possess </v>

119
00:05:31.541 --> 00:05:32.374
<v Speaker 1>and understanding of philosophy when in </v>
<v Speaker 1>reality they have only been taught </v>

120
00:05:34.990 --> 00:05:37.090
<v Speaker 1>shallow and disfigured elements of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Finally,</v>

121
00:05:37.091 --> 00:05:37.924
<v Speaker 1>as if that wasn't all enough,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we come to the third and final problem </v>

122
00:05:40.241 --> 00:05:42.940
<v Speaker 1>of the school of life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're hucksters and profiteers.</v>

123
00:05:43.150 --> 00:05:43.983
<v Speaker 1>They established themselves as some sort</v>
<v Speaker 1>of guide of life and use that position </v>

124
00:05:46.361 --> 00:05:49.270
<v Speaker 1>to sell merchandise that is priced so </v>
<v Speaker 1>high it borders on the insane.</v>

125
00:05:49.660 --> 00:05:52.120
<v Speaker 1>How much would you say this imperfect </v>
<v Speaker 1>pot is worth?</v>

126
00:05:53.230 --> 00:05:55.210
<v Speaker 1>It's literally a pot with blemishes on </v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

127
00:05:56.230 --> 00:05:59.000
<v Speaker 1>While it can be yours,</v>
<v Speaker 1>$75 or how about this?</v>

128
00:05:59.001 --> 00:06:01.070
<v Speaker 1>Regular Candle?</v>
<v Speaker 1>$50,</v>

129
00:06:01.430 --> 00:06:05.300
<v Speaker 1>but best of all and so telling of how </v>
<v Speaker 1>money grubbing this operation really is.</v>

130
00:06:05.570 --> 00:06:06.403
<v Speaker 1>Is there an anticapitalist notebooks </v>
<v Speaker 1>which they shamelessly ironically sell </v>

131
00:06:10.071 --> 00:06:12.830
<v Speaker 1>for the very pro capitalistic price of </v>
<v Speaker 1>$20.</v>

132
00:06:14.780 --> 00:06:19.370
<v Speaker 1>How does some of this video,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think alon his whole school of life as</v>

133
00:06:19.371 --> 00:06:22.940
<v Speaker 1>best criticized through his own view of </v>
<v Speaker 1>business businesses should not.</v>

134
00:06:22.941 --> 00:06:25.640
<v Speaker 1>He says so desires,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but instead cell needs,</v>

135
00:06:25.910 --> 00:06:28.730
<v Speaker 1>and this is the crucial distinction he </v>
<v Speaker 1>makes between desires and needs.</v>

136
00:06:29.150 --> 00:06:31.490
<v Speaker 1>A desire is what you feel like you want </v>
<v Speaker 1>at the moment,</v>

137
00:06:31.730 --> 00:06:32.563
<v Speaker 1>and Anita is something that serves your </v>
<v Speaker 1>longterm wellbeing and I think you're </v>

138
00:06:35.451 --> 00:06:36.284
<v Speaker 1>right alone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so why in the world are you selling a </v>

139
00:06:37.670 --> 00:06:40.040
<v Speaker 1>who should you be with card game for </v>
<v Speaker 1>$15,</v>

140
00:06:40.640 --> 00:06:41.473
<v Speaker 1>I guess,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at that doesn't fall under the need </v>

141
00:06:42.470 --> 00:06:43.303
<v Speaker 1>section for most people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the same is true for their actual </v>

142
00:06:45.321 --> 00:06:46.154
<v Speaker 1>content in the same way at the school of</v>
<v Speaker 1>life should stop selling the desires of </v>

143
00:06:48.771 --> 00:06:49.850
<v Speaker 1>the people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cheap,</v>

144
00:06:49.880 --> 00:06:50.713
<v Speaker 1>watery self-help philosophy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>drivel that reinforces their belief </v>

145
00:06:52.851 --> 00:06:53.684
<v Speaker 1>system and instead sell to the needs of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the people are real examination of what </v>

146
00:06:57.111 --> 00:06:57.944
<v Speaker 1>the philosophers have been saying all </v>
<v Speaker 1>along and help explain how one best </v>

147
00:07:00.621 --> 00:07:01.454
<v Speaker 1>ought to examine their lives because in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the end it's these true needs being met </v>

148
00:07:04.431 --> 00:07:07.850
<v Speaker 1>that Plato and Aristotle would say </v>
<v Speaker 1>produces a life full of eudaimonia.</v>

149
00:07:08.270 --> 00:07:10.340
<v Speaker 1>In other words,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a life well lived.</v>
