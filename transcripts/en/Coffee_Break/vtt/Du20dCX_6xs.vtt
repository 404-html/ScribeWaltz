1
00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:03.120
<v Speaker 1>Let me tell you a secret.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wars are being fought for your attention</v>

2
00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:06.090
<v Speaker 1>and today we're going to be looking at </v>
<v Speaker 1>the new war that's been going on as well</v>

3
00:00:06.091 --> 00:00:08.610
<v Speaker 1>as looking back to see what we can learn</v>
<v Speaker 1>from past wars.</v>

4
00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:12.510
<v Speaker 1>The new battlefield is on youtube and it</v>
<v Speaker 1>involves one really annoying tactic.</v>

5
00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:17.730
<v Speaker 2>Morning Guys,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how's her?</v>

6
00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:18.910
<v Speaker 2>When do I pick the kids?</v>

7
00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:28.200
<v Speaker 3>[inaudible]</v>

8
00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:36.930
<v Speaker 1>welcome to the excitement.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wars were fake excitement and hype draws</v>

9
00:00:36.931 --> 00:00:39.240
<v Speaker 1>in more viewers and gets people to watch</v>
<v Speaker 1>longer.</v>

10
00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:42.240
<v Speaker 1>If you want to be a part of this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to get excited,</v>

11
00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:44.010
<v Speaker 1>like really excited.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

12
00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:46.800
<v Speaker 1>if they think you're going to have a </v>
<v Speaker 1>seizure or a heart attack,</v>

13
00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:49.680
<v Speaker 1>pets about the right level,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but even though that will keep views,</v>

14
00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:51.810
<v Speaker 1>I don't think fake excitement is a good </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>

15
00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:53.273
<v Speaker 1>It eventually makes excitement and hype </v>
<v Speaker 1>on Youtube meaningless because everyone </v>

16
00:00:55.371 --> 00:00:56.204
<v Speaker 1>is overusing it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm not going to hate on any </v>

17
00:00:57.541 --> 00:00:58.374
<v Speaker 1>individual.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're just playing the system </v>

18
00:00:59.221 --> 00:01:00.054
<v Speaker 1>exploiting a weakness in our attention.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just wanted to talk about the </v>

19
00:01:01.921 --> 00:01:05.130
<v Speaker 1>potential effects and what we can do </v>
<v Speaker 1>about it because believe it or not,</v>

20
00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:07.410
<v Speaker 1>we've already seen this warp play out </v>
<v Speaker 1>before,</v>

21
00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:10.220
<v Speaker 1>twice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Both of them bear a striking resemblance</v>

22
00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:11.083
<v Speaker 1>to the excitement of wars and I think we</v>
<v Speaker 1>can examine them to learn lessons about </v>

23
00:01:13.531 --> 00:01:14.550
<v Speaker 1>our own wars today.</v>

24
00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:16.410
<v Speaker 1>Have you ever heard of the loudness </v>
<v Speaker 1>wars?</v>

25
00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:17.783
<v Speaker 1>It started in the 1940s when sound </v>
<v Speaker 1>engineers began to realize that louder </v>

26
00:01:20.251 --> 00:01:21.084
<v Speaker 1>music stands out on Juke boxes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so they began telling the record labels </v>

27
00:01:23.401 --> 00:01:24.234
<v Speaker 1>to record louder so people started </v>
<v Speaker 1>overusing compressors to artificially </v>

28
00:01:26.641 --> 00:01:29.340
<v Speaker 1>raise the volume of their whole song to </v>
<v Speaker 1>be as loud as possible.</v>

29
00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:30.863
<v Speaker 1>And the reason raising the volume </v>
<v Speaker 1>artificially matters is because it </v>

30
00:01:32.881 --> 00:01:35.340
<v Speaker 1>destroys something called dynamic range.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Basically.</v>

31
00:01:35.341 --> 00:01:36.174
<v Speaker 1>That's the difference between the </v>
<v Speaker 1>quietest and loudest part of a song and </v>

32
00:01:37.981 --> 00:01:40.800
<v Speaker 1>it's hugely responsible for conveying </v>
<v Speaker 1>emotion and tone.</v>

33
00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:43.440
<v Speaker 1>The problem with the loudness wars is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as Matt may feel,</v>

34
00:01:43.441 --> 00:01:46.560
<v Speaker 1>puts it when there's no quiet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there can be no loud.</v>

35
00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:48.323
<v Speaker 1>The first few seconds of Beethoven's </v>
<v Speaker 1>fifth symphony illustrates this really </v>

36
00:01:50.701 --> 00:01:51.534
<v Speaker 1>well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pay Close attention to the volume and </v>

37
00:01:53.041 --> 00:01:54.630
<v Speaker 1>how it affects the tone of the piece.</v>

38
00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:12.103
<v Speaker 1>The reason you can really feel those </v>
<v Speaker 1>loud moments is because of the quiet </v>

39
00:02:14.841 --> 00:02:15.674
<v Speaker 1>ones right before it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we can see these peaks and valleys </v>

40
00:02:17.421 --> 00:02:20.090
<v Speaker 1>of intensity in the visual way form of a</v>
<v Speaker 1>song.</v>

41
00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:21.163
<v Speaker 1>Here's the song.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Before that loudness wars really </v>

42
00:02:22.101 --> 00:02:25.070
<v Speaker 1>escalated and here's a way form during </v>
<v Speaker 1>the loudness wars,</v>

43
00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:27.620
<v Speaker 1>simultaneously as the loudness wars were</v>
<v Speaker 1>going on,</v>

44
00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:29.660
<v Speaker 1>there was a similar war going on in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>media,</v>

45
00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:30.853
<v Speaker 1>a wharf sensationalism with Fox News </v>
<v Speaker 1>being one of the first 24 hour news </v>

46
00:02:33.771 --> 00:02:37.190
<v Speaker 1>networks founded in 1996 people soon </v>
<v Speaker 1>became aware that sensationalist,</v>

47
00:02:37.191 --> 00:02:40.430
<v Speaker 1>even partisan show's got a lot more </v>
<v Speaker 1>views than moderate even handed ones.</v>

48
00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:41.533
<v Speaker 1>Because of this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>several similar news programs were </v>

49
00:02:42.741 --> 00:02:43.574
<v Speaker 1>created on the other side of the aisle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Both sides vying for the attention of </v>

50
00:02:45.651 --> 00:02:46.484
<v Speaker 1>the television viewer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This escalation in sensationalism </v>

51
00:02:49.131 --> 00:02:50.930
<v Speaker 1>resulted in news clips like this.</v>

52
00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:54.050
<v Speaker 2>This does this offend you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this word.</v>

53
00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:56.990
<v Speaker 2>A lot of people are shocked.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A massive gas line.</v>

54
00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.010
<v Speaker 2>Rutgers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>could it happen in your neighborhood?</v>

55
00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:00.933
<v Speaker 4>Marijuana,</v>
<v Speaker 4>could it be in your neighborhood and is </v>

56
00:03:02.531 --> 00:03:03.364
<v Speaker 4>America ready?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Is the u s next is America dangerously </v>

57
00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:08.830
<v Speaker 4>under four pair.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The flip flop is the new sneaker,</v>

58
00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:11.860
<v Speaker 4>but behind the Sandal nursing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>serious danger,</v>

59
00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:15.250
<v Speaker 4>not only lack of sleep,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it can kill you it sleeping too much</v>

60
00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:16.513
<v Speaker 1>and no one critique the dangers of this </v>
<v Speaker 1>hyper sensationalism better than John </v>

61
00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:20.460
<v Speaker 1>Stewart.</v>

62
00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:25.460
<v Speaker 5>If we amplify everything we hear </v>
<v Speaker 5>nothing.</v>

63
00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:27.633
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>

64
00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:30.633
<v Speaker 1>sounds a little bit like matt may film.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He echoes this thought later in an </v>

65
00:03:33.311 --> 00:03:34.070
<v Speaker 1>interview.</v>

66
00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:36.590
<v Speaker 5>Now the problem is how do you keep </v>
<v Speaker 5>people watching it?</v>

67
00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:37.633
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Jay's not going to kill someone every </v>

68
00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:39.830
<v Speaker 5>day,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so that's gone.</v>

69
00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:41.083
<v Speaker 5>So what do you have to do?</v>
<v Speaker 5>You have to elevate the passion of </v>

70
00:03:43.401 --> 00:03:44.234
<v Speaker 5>everything else that happens that might </v>
<v Speaker 5>even be somewhat mundane and elevate it </v>

71
00:03:47.811 --> 00:03:50.000
<v Speaker 5>to the extent that this is breaking </v>
<v Speaker 5>news.</v>

72
00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:55.180
<v Speaker 5>The aggregate effect of that is that you</v>
<v Speaker 5>begin to lose the lexicon.</v>

73
00:03:56.270 --> 00:04:01.270
<v Speaker 5>You begin to lose any meaning of what </v>
<v Speaker 5>breaking news means or urgent or look at</v>

74
00:04:01.851 --> 00:04:03.410
<v Speaker 5>this or dangerous.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

75
00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:07.790
<v Speaker 5>this is a an arms race.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The language then has to become sharper,</v>

76
00:04:08.210 --> 00:04:11.420
<v Speaker 5>louder to cut through more and more of </v>
<v Speaker 5>the noise.</v>

77
00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:17.290
<v Speaker 5>And when I'm saying is maybe there is a </v>
<v Speaker 5>way to not engage in the idea,</v>

78
00:04:21.110 --> 00:04:22.640
<v Speaker 5>not to accept the premise</v>

79
00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:23.803
<v Speaker 1>Jon Stewart's mind.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The news had become an arms race to </v>

80
00:04:25.191 --> 00:04:27.530
<v Speaker 1>become more sensationalist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fantastic from the rest,</v>

81
00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:30.500
<v Speaker 1>but it resulted in a loss of fidelity of</v>
<v Speaker 1>what is important,</v>

82
00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:31.663
<v Speaker 1>just like the loudness wars,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but sensationalists wars were </v>

83
00:04:33.171 --> 00:04:34.004
<v Speaker 1>obliterating the crescendos of real life</v>
<v Speaker 1>news by amplifying everything into </v>

84
00:04:37.581 --> 00:04:38.414
<v Speaker 1>meaninglessness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And now we come back to the excitement </v>

85
00:04:40.581 --> 00:04:41.414
<v Speaker 1>wars.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All of these guys are emotional actors </v>

86
00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:47.000
<v Speaker 1>playing to what they know that we want,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but just like in media and news,</v>

87
00:04:47.001 --> 00:04:47.834
<v Speaker 1>it's getting to the point where we can </v>
<v Speaker 1>no longer distinguish what is actually </v>

88
00:04:49.641 --> 00:04:53.240
<v Speaker 1>fun and exciting because people play </v>
<v Speaker 1>everything up as if it were so exciting.</v>

89
00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:55.760
<v Speaker 1>But maybe we don't have to accept the </v>
<v Speaker 1>premise.</v>

90
00:04:56.270 --> 00:04:59.600
<v Speaker 1>Here's something to remember.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These wars eventually get played out.</v>

91
00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:02.330
<v Speaker 1>People get sick of the escalation and </v>
<v Speaker 1>insanity of it.</v>

92
00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:03.433
<v Speaker 1>And we can see these effects happening </v>
<v Speaker 1>in the loudness wars where we've seen a </v>

93
00:05:05.361 --> 00:05:06.194
<v Speaker 1>reduction in over compression since 2005</v>
<v Speaker 1>we've also seen a similar reaction into </v>

94
00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:10.453
<v Speaker 1>sensationalist wars with the rise in </v>
<v Speaker 1>popularity of websites like politifact </v>

95
00:05:13.130 --> 00:05:13.963
<v Speaker 1>fact check and all sides that seek to </v>
<v Speaker 1>lessen the sensationalism in politics </v>

96
00:05:17.481 --> 00:05:20.540
<v Speaker 1>and seek unbiased.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We will never be rid of people trying to</v>

97
00:05:20.541 --> 00:05:21.374
<v Speaker 1>exploit our biases,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether it be towards volume </v>

98
00:05:22.741 --> 00:05:23.574
<v Speaker 1>sensationalism or excitement.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But thankfully we can vote with our </v>

99
00:05:26.031 --> 00:05:28.310
<v Speaker 1>views to not pay attention to those </v>
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>

100
00:05:28.550 --> 00:05:31.670
<v Speaker 1>These wars are going to keep going,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we don't have to be a part of it.</v>

101
00:05:33.970 --> 00:05:34.803
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>

102
00:05:41.940 --> 00:05:43.440
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>
