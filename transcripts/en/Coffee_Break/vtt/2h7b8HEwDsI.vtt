00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:00.893
<v Speaker 1>I like to exercise,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the time it takes up in my day </v>

2
00:00:02.221 --> 00:00:03.930
<v Speaker 1>bothers me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The time I spend running,</v>

3
00:00:03.931 --> 00:00:06.230
<v Speaker 1>I could be doing anything else on one of</v>
<v Speaker 1>these days.</v>

4
00:00:06.250 --> 00:00:08.460
<v Speaker 1>A thought occurred to me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>putting aside for a moment,</v>

5
00:00:08.461 --> 00:00:11.010
<v Speaker 1>the ancillary benefits of exercise,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like energy,</v>

6
00:00:11.011 --> 00:00:12.000
<v Speaker 1>physique,</v>
<v Speaker 1>mental clarity,</v>

7
00:00:12.001 --> 00:00:12.834
<v Speaker 1>et cetera.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do the life length and benefits you get </v>

8
00:00:14.251 --> 00:00:16.980
<v Speaker 1>from exercising outweigh the time you </v>
<v Speaker 1>spend doing it?</v>

9
00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:18.960
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's find out.</v>

10
00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:20.093
<v Speaker 1>So according to a study in 2012 </v>
<v Speaker 1>published in the peer reviewed BMJ that </v>

11
00:00:23.671 --> 00:00:26.220
<v Speaker 1>included over 650,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>participants,</v>

12
00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:28.110
<v Speaker 1>moderate exercise,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like briskly walking,</v>

13
00:00:28.111 --> 00:00:29.070
<v Speaker 1>cycling,</v>
<v Speaker 1>etc.</v>

14
00:00:29.071 --> 00:00:30.570
<v Speaker 1>For 2.5</v>
<v Speaker 1>hours per week,</v>

15
00:00:30.571 --> 00:00:33.300
<v Speaker 1>we'll add on average 3.4</v>
<v Speaker 1>to 4.5</v>

16
00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:36.090
<v Speaker 1>years to your life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But how many hours is that?</v>

17
00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:38.040
<v Speaker 1>If you live 3.4</v>
<v Speaker 1>years longer,</v>

18
00:00:38.041 --> 00:00:39.540
<v Speaker 1>which is the low end of what we'd </v>
<v Speaker 1>expect,</v>

19
00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:42.090
<v Speaker 1>that means that you've gained 30,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>hours.</v>

20
00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:46.230
<v Speaker 1>But not all of that is productive time </v>
<v Speaker 1>because you have to sleep accounting for</v>

21
00:00:46.231 --> 00:00:46.560
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

22
00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:47.393
<v Speaker 1>You've gained 20,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you have to spend time to get this </v>

23
00:00:49.591 --> 00:00:50.424
<v Speaker 1>reward.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So let's say you work out for your </v>

24
00:00:51.661 --> 00:00:55.020
<v Speaker 1>entire adult life starting at 20 years </v>
<v Speaker 1>old and he lived to be 80 so you've been</v>

25
00:00:55.021 --> 00:00:57.990
<v Speaker 1>working out 2.5</v>
<v Speaker 1>hours per week for 60 years.</v>

26
00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:01.140
<v Speaker 1>That comes out to a total cost of 7,800</v>
<v Speaker 1>hours.</v>

27
00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:03.510
<v Speaker 1>So what does this mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

28
00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:06.270
<v Speaker 1>it means the way we think about </v>
<v Speaker 1>exercising is wrong.</v>

29
00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:07.343
<v Speaker 1>You weren't spending time exercising.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're actually creating time for every </v>

30
00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:14.250
<v Speaker 1>hour you spend exercising.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You'll get 2.5</v>

31
00:01:14.251 --> 00:01:15.084
<v Speaker 1>hours on the back end of your life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So don't feel bad going to the gym or </v>

32
00:01:18.151 --> 00:01:18.984
<v Speaker 1>stealing a few minutes for a walk.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not only will you get that hour back to </v>

33
00:01:21.871 --> 00:01:22.704
<v Speaker 1>spend at the office,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you're also going to get extra time </v>

34
00:01:24.271 --> 00:01:26.070
<v Speaker 1>to spend with friends and family.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

35
00:01:26.071 --> 00:01:28.020
<v Speaker 1>obviously this isn't the secret to </v>
<v Speaker 1>eternal youth.</v>

36
00:01:28.021 --> 00:01:28.854
<v Speaker 1>There are diminishing returns on this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so don't run down the street thinking </v>

37
00:01:30.931 --> 00:01:33.840
<v Speaker 1>that you've cheated death.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But let's say that you're one of the 80%</v>

38
00:01:33.841 --> 00:01:35.520
<v Speaker 1>of Americans,</v>
<v Speaker 1>80% of British,</v>

39
00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:36.473
<v Speaker 1>60% of Australian adults or anyone in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the developed world who doesn't get to </v>

40
00:01:40.111 --> 00:01:40.944
<v Speaker 1>wait five hours of exercise a week.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not that you don't have time to </v>

41
00:01:43.921 --> 00:01:45.810
<v Speaker 1>exercise.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Actually the reverse is true.</v>

42
00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:47.310
<v Speaker 1>You can't afford not to.</v>

43
00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:51.193
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
