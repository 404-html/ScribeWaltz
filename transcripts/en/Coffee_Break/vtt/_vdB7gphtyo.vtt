1
00:00:01.390 --> 00:00:03.520
<v Speaker 1>Wall Street is Las Vegas for smart </v>
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>

2
00:00:03.580 --> 00:00:04.413
<v Speaker 1>It's where you take your money if you </v>
<v Speaker 1>want to have the odds on your side and </v>

3
00:00:06.851 --> 00:00:07.684
<v Speaker 1>like Las Vegas,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's full of people who think they have </v>

4
00:00:09.371 --> 00:00:11.680
<v Speaker 1>the winning system to get even further </v>
<v Speaker 1>ahead.</v>

5
00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:13.540
<v Speaker 1>Hedge funds,</v>
<v Speaker 1>value investors,</v>

6
00:00:13.541 --> 00:00:18.130
<v Speaker 1>your uncle who assured that they connect</v>
<v Speaker 1>is the next big thing and especially Jim</v>

7
00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:18.963
<v Speaker 1>Kramer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're all trying to outsmart everyone </v>

8
00:00:20.231 --> 00:00:21.064
<v Speaker 1>else and this makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The legend and mystique around Wall </v>

9
00:00:23.651 --> 00:00:24.484
<v Speaker 1>Street is that if you're clever enough </v>
<v Speaker 1>you can be like mitis ensuring </v>

10
00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:28.653
<v Speaker 1>everything you touch will become gold </v>
<v Speaker 1>and there's a clip from the movie </v>

11
00:00:31.871 --> 00:00:35.770
<v Speaker 1>limitless that perfectly encapsulates </v>
<v Speaker 1>this allure of Wall Street.</v>

12
00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:36.923
<v Speaker 1>Super Intelligent guy gets on Wall </v>
<v Speaker 1>Street and from nothing makes millions </v>

13
00:00:39.521 --> 00:00:41.500
<v Speaker 1>because he just sees things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The others don't.</v>

14
00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:42.543
<v Speaker 1>He outsmarts them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My new friend Kevin Dileo showed me how </v>

15
00:00:45.281 --> 00:00:48.150
<v Speaker 1>you could leverage two and a half times </v>
<v Speaker 1>your cash at the day training.</v>

16
00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:50.813
<v Speaker 1>Why are you buying that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The CEO was just indicted but not for </v>

17
00:00:53.201 --> 00:00:55.820
<v Speaker 1>the big fat defense contract.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He bribed his way into that.</v>

18
00:00:55.821 --> 00:00:57.880
<v Speaker 1>Still on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It should be announced next week.</v>

19
00:00:59.140 --> 00:00:59.973
<v Speaker 1>At the end of the week,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my brokerage account contained over $2 </v>

20
00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:03.760
<v Speaker 1>million.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

21
00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:06.760
<v Speaker 1>of course you have to take out the </v>
<v Speaker 1>exaggerated Hollywood elements,</v>

22
00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:10.180
<v Speaker 1>but for many people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is the sexy side of Wall Street.</v>

23
00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:14.590
<v Speaker 1>Bring me your poor masses and if you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>smart will make you rich.</v>

24
00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:17.320
<v Speaker 1>And many people believe that story and </v>
<v Speaker 1>chase,</v>

25
00:01:17.321 --> 00:01:18.154
<v Speaker 1>it's promise.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But there was an idea that challenge </v>

26
00:01:19.991 --> 00:01:20.824
<v Speaker 1>that narrative that radically suggested </v>
<v Speaker 1>that it may be impossible to improve </v>

27
00:01:24.071 --> 00:01:27.520
<v Speaker 1>your odds beyond the average.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even brilliant money managers,</v>

28
00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:28.383
<v Speaker 1>hedge funds,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the best investors may be no better </v>

29
00:01:30.581 --> 00:01:34.840
<v Speaker 1>than monkeys at picking stocks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Number one rule of Wall Street.</v>

30
00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:38.910
<v Speaker 1>Nobody,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay if you're Warren Buffet,</v>

31
00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:39.773
<v Speaker 1>if you cheer me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but nobody knows if a stock is going to </v>

32
00:01:42.161 --> 00:01:43.120
<v Speaker 1>go up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>down,</v>

33
00:01:43.121 --> 00:01:44.650
<v Speaker 1>sideways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or in fucking circles,</v>

34
00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:46.200
<v Speaker 1>at least of all stock brokers.</v>

35
00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:50.230
<v Speaker 1>But before we get to monkeys,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's first talk about the big question,</v>

36
00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:51.483
<v Speaker 1>the question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some of the greatest minds in the world </v>

37
00:01:52.811 --> 00:01:56.530
<v Speaker 1>have spent their lives trying to answer </v>
<v Speaker 1>the one that would make you rich.</v>

38
00:01:57.070 --> 00:01:59.530
<v Speaker 1>What will the price of a stock b </v>
<v Speaker 1>tomorrow?</v>

39
00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:01.703
<v Speaker 1>And the answers to this question are as </v>
<v Speaker 1>numerous as you might expect for an </v>

40
00:02:04.331 --> 00:02:07.150
<v Speaker 1>alchemy recipe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There is fundamental analysis,</v>

41
00:02:07.151 --> 00:02:08.980
<v Speaker 1>technical analysis,</v>
<v Speaker 1>buying hold,</v>

42
00:02:08.981 --> 00:02:10.360
<v Speaker 1>value,</v>
<v Speaker 1>invest in growth investing.</v>

43
00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:11.523
<v Speaker 1>I could go on pretty much forever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the point is at this time it was </v>

44
00:02:15.131 --> 00:02:15.964
<v Speaker 1>thought that if you had money,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you needed to find a genius on Wall </v>

45
00:02:18.341 --> 00:02:19.174
<v Speaker 1>Street to invest that money for you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Someone who through some secret </v>

46
00:02:21.761 --> 00:02:22.594
<v Speaker 1>strategy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>manage your wealth in exchange for a </v>

47
00:02:24.161 --> 00:02:24.994
<v Speaker 1>fee.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The idea was that their expertise would </v>

48
00:02:26.621 --> 00:02:30.100
<v Speaker 1>get you returns in your money that would</v>
<v Speaker 1>more than pay for their secret formula,</v>

49
00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:31.473
<v Speaker 1>and this is how you made the big bucks </v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're on Wall Street managing </v>

50
00:02:34.001 --> 00:02:35.920
<v Speaker 1>people's money and charging a fee for </v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

51
00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:40.683
<v Speaker 2>Okay?</v>

52
00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:41.853
<v Speaker 1>And amidst these competing views of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>stock market and wealthy wealth </v>

53
00:02:44.051 --> 00:02:46.210
<v Speaker 1>managers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>along comes an American economist,</v>

54
00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:47.103
<v Speaker 1>Burton Malkiel,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who looks at the market and essentially </v>

55
00:02:49.061 --> 00:02:52.450
<v Speaker 1>throws a monkey wrench at the </v>
<v Speaker 1>traditional theories in his book,</v>

56
00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:54.130
<v Speaker 1>a random walk down Wall Street.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He says,</v>

57
00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:55.600
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're all wrong.</v>

58
00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:58.990
<v Speaker 1>The stock market can't be consistently </v>
<v Speaker 1>predicted by any theory.</v>

59
00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:01.810
<v Speaker 1>The only predictable thing we have about</v>
<v Speaker 1>the market is it.</v>

60
00:03:01.811 --> 00:03:04.060
<v Speaker 1>The whole thing tends to increase over </v>
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>

61
00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:05.463
<v Speaker 1>No one is able to consistently pick </v>
<v Speaker 1>winners over anyone else and boldest of </v>

62
00:03:08.891 --> 00:03:09.724
<v Speaker 1>all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he predicted a blindfolded monkey </v>

63
00:03:11.351 --> 00:03:12.184
<v Speaker 1>throwing darts at newspaper's financial </v>
<v Speaker 1>pages could select a portfolio that </v>

64
00:03:15.611 --> 00:03:19.270
<v Speaker 1>would do just as well as one carefully </v>
<v Speaker 1>selected by experts.</v>

65
00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:22.330
<v Speaker 1>If this is true Malka,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it goes on to say,</v>

66
00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:23.463
<v Speaker 1>instead of paying big bucks to Wall </v>
<v Speaker 1>Street to let experts manage your </v>

67
00:03:25.391 --> 00:03:26.224
<v Speaker 1>wealth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the best thing to do is to find a </v>

68
00:03:27.581 --> 00:03:28.414
<v Speaker 1>minimum fee fund that buys up hundreds </v>
<v Speaker 1>of stocks without discrimination for </v>

69
00:03:31.571 --> 00:03:32.404
<v Speaker 1>winners and losers and just holds them </v>
<v Speaker 1>passively because the future of a stock </v>

70
00:03:35.891 --> 00:03:36.724
<v Speaker 1>is fundamentally unknowable anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because if your average return is the </v>

71
00:03:40.301 --> 00:03:43.510
<v Speaker 1>same for both strategies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>expert management and monkey management,</v>

72
00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:44.643
<v Speaker 1>why would anyone pay for the experts </v>
<v Speaker 1>into the index fund of the early </v>

73
00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:52.540
<v Speaker 1>seventies exactly the kind of low fi </v>
<v Speaker 1>fund that now kale proposes.</v>

74
00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:54.880
<v Speaker 1>You buy it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pay a tiny maintenance fee,</v>

75
00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:56.920
<v Speaker 1>and it just buys and holds hundreds of </v>
<v Speaker 1>stocks.</v>

76
00:03:57.220 --> 00:03:58.053
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're one of those expert investors </v>

77
00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:02.320
<v Speaker 1>and index funds seems both silly and </v>
<v Speaker 1>insulting.</v>

78
00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:05.260
<v Speaker 1>Random stocks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no technical analysis,</v>

79
00:04:05.261 --> 00:04:07.720
<v Speaker 1>no psychological analysis,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no chart analysis.</v>

80
00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:11.200
<v Speaker 1>This was a challenge to the very ethos </v>
<v Speaker 1>of Wall Street,</v>

81
00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:16.230
<v Speaker 1>a challenge to the idea of the midas </v>
<v Speaker 1>investor and over the next decades,</v>

82
00:04:16.300 --> 00:04:17.133
<v Speaker 1>the battle between expert funds and </v>
<v Speaker 1>monkey funds raged on and after almost </v>

83
00:04:21.281 --> 00:04:22.114
<v Speaker 1>50 years of data,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the results are in and it's </v>

84
00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:27.700
<v Speaker 1>overwhelming.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can find hundreds of studies on this</v>

85
00:04:27.701 --> 00:04:28.534
<v Speaker 1>because this is one of the most </v>
<v Speaker 1>surprising and over analyze things and </v>

86
00:04:30.611 --> 00:04:32.710
<v Speaker 1>finance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But here are the headlines.</v>

87
00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:38.020
<v Speaker 1>Over the last 15 years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>index funds outperformed 90% of actively</v>

88
00:04:38.021 --> 00:04:40.540
<v Speaker 1>managed funds when you account for their</v>
<v Speaker 1>fees.</v>

89
00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:41.823
<v Speaker 1>Let me repeat that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>90% not 50% 90% of the smartest people </v>

90
00:04:45.881 --> 00:04:50.881
<v Speaker 1>on Wall Street made less money than </v>
<v Speaker 1>monkeys and the 10% well,</v>

91
00:04:51.010 --> 00:04:53.950
<v Speaker 1>given the averages,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it starts looking a lot like luck rather</v>

92
00:04:53.951 --> 00:04:56.650
<v Speaker 1>than skill.</v>
<v Speaker 1>After all given enough investors,</v>

93
00:04:56.680 --> 00:04:57.513
<v Speaker 1>it's self evident that someone will gain</v>
<v Speaker 1>above average returns just by sheer </v>

94
00:05:00.191 --> 00:05:01.024
<v Speaker 1>luck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we also have a study that even the </v>

95
00:05:02.861 --> 00:05:05.470
<v Speaker 1>funds that do beat the index fund one </v>
<v Speaker 1>three,</v>

96
00:05:05.471 --> 00:05:09.820
<v Speaker 1>five years struggled to continue that </v>
<v Speaker 1>positive performance and the number that</v>

97
00:05:09.821 --> 00:05:10.654
<v Speaker 1>do continue that positive performance </v>
<v Speaker 1>year over year is about the number that </v>

98
00:05:13.541 --> 00:05:14.374
<v Speaker 1>we'd expect from blind chance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just because you won 15 coin flips in a </v>

99
00:05:17.831 --> 00:05:20.710
<v Speaker 1>row doesn't mean you're any more likely </v>
<v Speaker 1>to win the next one.</v>

100
00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:26.650
<v Speaker 1>Let's talk about why the future of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>stock market can't be predicted.</v>

101
00:05:26.980 --> 00:05:31.780
<v Speaker 1>This is a long theorized idea called the</v>
<v Speaker 1>efficient market hypothesis and even for</v>

102
00:05:31.781 --> 00:05:33.610
<v Speaker 1>the people who don't subscribe to that </v>
<v Speaker 1>idea,</v>

103
00:05:33.790 --> 00:05:36.070
<v Speaker 1>there's another confounding problem at </v>
<v Speaker 1>work here.</v>

104
00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:40.300
<v Speaker 1>It's a game theory problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a situation where there are so many</v>

105
00:05:40.301 --> 00:05:41.134
<v Speaker 1>rational actors in the system that the </v>
<v Speaker 1>market cannot be reasonably predicted </v>

106
00:05:44.770 --> 00:05:48.010
<v Speaker 1>because each time someone gets a winning</v>
<v Speaker 1>method of valuing stocks,</v>

107
00:05:48.220 --> 00:05:49.053
<v Speaker 1>the next person will find a way to </v>
<v Speaker 1>incorporate that strategy into a new </v>

108
00:05:51.941 --> 00:05:54.820
<v Speaker 1>strategy to be the first strategy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In other words,</v>

109
00:05:54.850 --> 00:05:55.683
<v Speaker 1>everyone's strategy must take into </v>
<v Speaker 1>account other investing strategies into </v>

110
00:05:58.641 --> 00:06:00.710
<v Speaker 1>their formula for how the market will </v>
<v Speaker 1>swing,</v>

111
00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:01.873
<v Speaker 1>but it's self referential because the </v>
<v Speaker 1>other rational actors will feasibly be </v>

112
00:06:04.761 --> 00:06:07.970
<v Speaker 1>trying to incorporate your strategy into</v>
<v Speaker 1>their investing strategy.</v>

113
00:06:08.270 --> 00:06:10.040
<v Speaker 1>And this is kind of where it all breaks </v>
<v Speaker 1>down.</v>

114
00:06:10.220 --> 00:06:11.053
<v Speaker 1>It's an ever evolving game that you'll </v>
<v Speaker 1>never win it long enough to beat the </v>

115
00:06:13.521 --> 00:06:16.910
<v Speaker 1>market average.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So while occasionally there are exploits</v>

116
00:06:16.911 --> 00:06:17.744
<v Speaker 1>in the market,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they rarely lasts for long and they </v>

117
00:06:19.620 --> 00:06:20.453
<v Speaker 1>almost always found by different people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even Warren Buffett who is on the very </v>

118
00:06:24.351 --> 00:06:25.184
<v Speaker 1>short list of people you might argue has</v>
<v Speaker 1>consistently beating the stock market </v>

119
00:06:28.010 --> 00:06:31.790
<v Speaker 1>when asked what to invest in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't bother naming his own company or</v>

120
00:06:31.791 --> 00:06:32.624
<v Speaker 1>any other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Instead he has a simple answer that </v>

121
00:06:34.611 --> 00:06:35.444
<v Speaker 1>would make Malka smile.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He recommends you go get some index </v>

122
00:06:38.160 --> 00:06:41.720
<v Speaker 1>funds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It turns out that predicting winners and</v>

123
00:06:41.721 --> 00:06:44.210
<v Speaker 1>losers is impractical over long periods </v>
<v Speaker 1>of time.</v>

124
00:06:44.570 --> 00:06:47.810
<v Speaker 1>There's no such thing as a consistently </v>
<v Speaker 1>winning strategy over the long haul.</v>

125
00:06:48.080 --> 00:06:51.380
<v Speaker 1>It's much more like gambling where the </v>
<v Speaker 1>house odds are on your side,</v>

126
00:06:51.560 --> 00:06:53.600
<v Speaker 1>you're going to win some and you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to lose them.</v>

127
00:06:53.840 --> 00:06:56.720
<v Speaker 1>And you can't predict which,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if you stay around long enough,</v>

128
00:06:56.900 --> 00:06:57.733
<v Speaker 1>you'll win more than you lose.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really the only thing you shouldn't do </v>

129
00:07:00.260 --> 00:07:03.650
<v Speaker 1>is pay someone to come up with fancy </v>
<v Speaker 1>models and strategies for something that</v>

130
00:07:03.651 --> 00:07:06.740
<v Speaker 1>ultimately comes to chance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just go and get some money.</v>

131
00:07:06.770 --> 00:07:07.603
<v Speaker 1>Peace.</v>
