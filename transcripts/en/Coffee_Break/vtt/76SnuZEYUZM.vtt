00:00:00.750 --> 00:00:01.583
<v Speaker 1>Axes approach to marketing has been one </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the most unique and brilliant </v>

2
00:00:03.931 --> 00:00:04.764
<v Speaker 1>campaigns in history,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but their marketing genius has been </v>

3
00:00:07.021 --> 00:00:09.720
<v Speaker 1>traded by what appears to just be a </v>
<v Speaker 1>cheap tactic,</v>

4
00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:13.530
<v Speaker 1>advertising sex.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But what made it successful was not what</v>

5
00:00:13.531 --> 00:00:15.080
<v Speaker 1>they were advertising.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Instead,</v>

6
00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:17.970
<v Speaker 1>he was who they were advertising to and </v>
<v Speaker 1>how they did it.</v>

7
00:00:17.971 --> 00:00:20.160
<v Speaker 1>By ignoring all social roles of </v>
<v Speaker 1>delicacy,</v>

8
00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:23.280
<v Speaker 1>love them or hate them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>acts as a beautifully consistent brand.</v>

9
00:00:23.610 --> 00:00:25.830
<v Speaker 1>Their marketing style matches their </v>
<v Speaker 1>product perfectly,</v>

10
00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:27.113
<v Speaker 1>just like their cheap,</v>
<v Speaker 1>almost overpoweringly fragrant body </v>

11
00:00:28.951 --> 00:00:29.784
<v Speaker 1>spray that punches you in the mouth </v>
<v Speaker 1>within stench acts as marketed to the </v>

12
00:00:32.131 --> 00:00:32.964
<v Speaker 1>male ego with one singular thought.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Men especially pubescent boys don't </v>

13
00:00:37.141 --> 00:00:39.000
<v Speaker 1>understand subtlety.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

14
00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:41.160
<v Speaker 1>it may never be possible to be clear </v>
<v Speaker 1>enough.</v>

15
00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:42.143
<v Speaker 1>And so while other Cologne brands,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're timidly dancing around the notion </v>

16
00:00:44.791 --> 00:00:45.624
<v Speaker 1>that mindware fragrances to give women </v>
<v Speaker 1>acts decided skip the foreplay and go </v>

17
00:00:48.421 --> 00:00:49.254
<v Speaker 1>for the Jaguar.</v>

18
00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:51.600
<v Speaker 1>Their brand won't make you slightly less</v>
<v Speaker 1>smelly,</v>

19
00:00:51.601 --> 00:00:53.850
<v Speaker 1>slightly more classy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or make you fall in love.</v>

20
00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:57.090
<v Speaker 1>Their brand will get you laid and not </v>
<v Speaker 1>just by one woman,</v>

21
00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:00.360
<v Speaker 1>but as many women as you want and no six</v>
<v Speaker 1>pack required.</v>

22
00:01:00.361 --> 00:01:01.194
<v Speaker 1>You can be the biggest loser in school,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the second you spray on axe body </v>

23
00:01:03.511 --> 00:01:05.160
<v Speaker 1>spray,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you become a chick magnet.</v>

24
00:01:05.161 --> 00:01:05.994
<v Speaker 1>So powerful it would make James Bond </v>
<v Speaker 1>jealous all for the low low price of </v>

25
00:01:09.001 --> 00:01:09.834
<v Speaker 1>four 99 but before they launched in </v>
<v Speaker 1>America in 2002 as a bottle of sex </v>

26
00:01:13.171 --> 00:01:15.980
<v Speaker 1>pheromone x had to figure out who they </v>
<v Speaker 1>stood for.</v>

27
00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:18.120
<v Speaker 1>After all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you try to appeal to everyone,</v>

28
00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:18.993
<v Speaker 1>you appeal to no one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So an efforts of figuring out the </v>

29
00:01:20.581 --> 00:01:22.920
<v Speaker 1>perfect audience for their over the top </v>
<v Speaker 1>marketing campaign.</v>

30
00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:23.783
<v Speaker 1>They decided to do a study.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Acts took nearly a hundred men out to </v>

31
00:01:26.221 --> 00:01:27.054
<v Speaker 1>bars and watch them try to pick up girls</v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to classify different kinds of </v>

32
00:01:30.061 --> 00:01:30.894
<v Speaker 1>potential acts consumers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they eventually realized that their </v>

33
00:01:33.061 --> 00:01:35.940
<v Speaker 1>target audience would not be the already</v>
<v Speaker 1>confident mail.</v>

34
00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:37.223
<v Speaker 1>They didn't need help getting them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They would sell to the awkward acne </v>

35
00:01:39.691 --> 00:01:41.850
<v Speaker 1>faced average Joe who didn't have a </v>
<v Speaker 1>chance,</v>

36
00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:45.060
<v Speaker 1>but the kind of guy who blushes at the </v>
<v Speaker 1>mere thought of approaching his crush,</v>

37
00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:48.570
<v Speaker 1>the technical term for their audience </v>
<v Speaker 1>was the insecure novice.</v>

38
00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:50.520
<v Speaker 1>And you can see this play out in their </v>
<v Speaker 1>ads.</v>

39
00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:51.443
<v Speaker 1>Up until now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Brands like old spice and colognes had </v>

40
00:01:53.161 --> 00:01:56.880
<v Speaker 1>always cast male models to get the </v>
<v Speaker 1>female model but not acts.</v>

41
00:01:57.120 --> 00:01:57.953
<v Speaker 1>They decided that with their body spray,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Dorky male would get the female </v>

42
00:02:00.181 --> 00:02:01.770
<v Speaker 1>model.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They cast it.</v>

43
00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:05.730
<v Speaker 1>Anybody except the stereotypical hump.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was the kid with glasses,</v>

44
00:02:05.731 --> 00:02:07.800
<v Speaker 1>the average guy who's on an unlucky </v>
<v Speaker 1>streak.</v>

45
00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:09.660
<v Speaker 1>But as for the female lead,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they applied,</v>

46
00:02:09.661 --> 00:02:13.560
<v Speaker 1>their enough is never enough role and </v>
<v Speaker 1>Swan dove into the deep end of the nerds</v>

47
00:02:13.561 --> 00:02:14.394
<v Speaker 1>fantasy life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They consistently cast the perfect 10 </v>

48
00:02:16.741 --> 00:02:17.574
<v Speaker 1>Amazonia Bikini clad female lead doesn't</v>
<v Speaker 1>care that acts hasn't transformed you </v>

49
00:02:20.881 --> 00:02:23.130
<v Speaker 1>into a hunk.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't need to be a hunt when you can</v>

50
00:02:23.131 --> 00:02:23.964
<v Speaker 1>smell like a $5 candy backs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this has worked beautifully for a </v>

51
00:02:27.001 --> 00:02:28.740
<v Speaker 1>long time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And even right now,</v>

52
00:02:28.741 --> 00:02:29.574
<v Speaker 1>access had the lion's share at the male </v>
<v Speaker 1>fragrance industry with the only real </v>

53
00:02:32.311 --> 00:02:34.320
<v Speaker 1>casualty being high school hallways </v>
<v Speaker 1>everywhere.</v>

54
00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:35.723
<v Speaker 1>But the way they did it wasn't just </v>
<v Speaker 1>selling sex acts reinvented how to sell </v>

55
00:02:40.081 --> 00:02:41.820
<v Speaker 1>sex and who to sell it to.</v>

56
00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:55.273
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
