1
00:00:00.810 --> 00:00:01.643
<v Speaker 1>These guys realized quick,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if they were going to claim that </v>

2
00:00:03.011 --> 00:00:05.340
<v Speaker 1>cigarettes were not addictive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they better have proof.</v>

3
00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:07.523
<v Speaker 1>This is the man who rely on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's been testing the link between </v>

4
00:00:09.691 --> 00:00:13.290
<v Speaker 1>nicotine and lung cancer for 30 years </v>
<v Speaker 1>and hasn't found any conclusive results.</v>

5
00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:16.110
<v Speaker 1>The man's a genius.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He could disprove gravity.</v>

6
00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:19.940
<v Speaker 2>This is called industry funded research.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And while it is a science,</v>

7
00:00:19.941 --> 00:00:20.774
<v Speaker 2>unfortunately,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's oftentimes a science of deception </v>

8
00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:24.343
<v Speaker 2>when faced with inconvenient facts,</v>
<v Speaker 2>companies will sometimes pay for </v>

9
00:00:26.841 --> 00:00:30.260
<v Speaker 2>research to find the opposite conclusion</v>
<v Speaker 2>so they can deny guilt.</v>

10
00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:31.513
<v Speaker 2>The most notorious example for this was </v>
<v Speaker 2>the tobacco industry who famously </v>

11
00:00:34.521 --> 00:00:35.354
<v Speaker 2>created an organization called the </v>
<v Speaker 2>council for Tobacco Research to fight </v>

12
00:00:38.061 --> 00:00:40.490
<v Speaker 2>the idea that cigarettes caused lung </v>
<v Speaker 2>cancer.</v>

13
00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:43.990
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dr Liddle have any cancer causing agents</v>

14
00:00:43.991 --> 00:00:46.540
<v Speaker 1>been identified and cigarettes?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

15
00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:48.840
<v Speaker 1>none had ever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

16
00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:53.470
<v Speaker 1>either in cigarette.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So in any of product of smoking.</v>

17
00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:54.520
<v Speaker 1>As such.</v>

18
00:00:54.990 --> 00:00:56.340
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fast forward a few decades,</v>

19
00:00:56.341 --> 00:01:00.060
<v Speaker 2>the public eventually found out the </v>
<v Speaker 2>truth and the CTR was exposed as a sham,</v>

20
00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:02.790
<v Speaker 2>but as the world turned it into </v>
<v Speaker 2>attention to new problems,</v>

21
00:01:02.791 --> 00:01:05.820
<v Speaker 2>one industry found itself in familiar </v>
<v Speaker 2>crosshairs.</v>

22
00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:11.630
<v Speaker 3>We Americans spend more money on slots </v>
<v Speaker 3>then on movies,</v>

23
00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:16.220
<v Speaker 3>baseball and theme parks combined,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but with the modern slot machines,</v>

24
00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:17.083
<v Speaker 3>there's a greater potential for a </v>
<v Speaker 3>dangerous side effect gambling </v>

25
00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:23.660
<v Speaker 3>addiction.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Problem gambling has become an epidemic.</v>

26
00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:26.600
<v Speaker 3>Last year,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the American Psychiatric Association,</v>

27
00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:30.140
<v Speaker 3>we classified pathological gambling as </v>
<v Speaker 3>an addiction.</v>

28
00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:35.340
<v Speaker 3>A Las Vegas and other casinos are like </v>
<v Speaker 3>giant laboratories and the features that</v>

29
00:01:35.481 --> 00:01:39.020
<v Speaker 3>earn higher will stick and those that </v>
<v Speaker 3>don't will drop away.</v>

30
00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:43.310
<v Speaker 3>The formula they've hit upon happens to </v>
<v Speaker 3>be one that's highly addictive.</v>

31
00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:44.233
<v Speaker 2>The gambling industry was being accused </v>
<v Speaker 2>of preying on the wallets of addicted </v>

32
00:01:47.031 --> 00:01:47.864
<v Speaker 2>gamblers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>addicted gamblers that they helped </v>

33
00:01:49.641 --> 00:01:52.160
<v Speaker 2>create with their carefully designed </v>
<v Speaker 2>machines.</v>

34
00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:53.113
<v Speaker 2>Howard Shaffer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>researcher at Harvard noted this </v>

35
00:01:54.771 --> 00:01:55.604
<v Speaker 2>increased addictiveness of modern games </v>
<v Speaker 2>like slots by calling them the crack </v>

36
00:01:58.491 --> 00:02:02.150
<v Speaker 2>cocaine of gambling.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In the midst of all this horrible press,</v>

37
00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:05.120
<v Speaker 2>the gambling industry needed a strategy </v>
<v Speaker 2>to stay alive.</v>

38
00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:08.450
<v Speaker 2>Luckily for them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they had watched someone else go through</v>

39
00:02:08.451 --> 00:02:12.260
<v Speaker 2>this and had learned a few things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can't completely deny the facts.</v>

40
00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:15.050
<v Speaker 2>The cigarette industry tried it and it </v>
<v Speaker 2>didn't work.</v>

41
00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:18.620
<v Speaker 2>The truth eventually comes out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so they came up with a different plan.</v>

42
00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:19.843
<v Speaker 2>Instead of denying gambling addiction,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they would embrace the problem publicly </v>

43
00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:23.473
<v Speaker 2>and also take an extremely active role </v>
<v Speaker 2>in researching the science of gambling </v>

44
00:02:26.091 --> 00:02:27.620
<v Speaker 2>addiction.</v>
<v Speaker 2>By doing this,</v>

45
00:02:27.621 --> 00:02:28.454
<v Speaker 2>they could frame the discussion of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>addiction the way they wanted to and so </v>

46
00:02:31.431 --> 00:02:32.264
<v Speaker 2>the National Center for responsible </v>
<v Speaker 2>gaming was created funded by casino </v>

47
00:02:35.541 --> 00:02:36.374
<v Speaker 2>dollars,</v>

48
00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:44.210
<v Speaker 1>and here's how they described gambling </v>
<v Speaker 1>addiction today,</v>

49
00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:45.463
<v Speaker 1>so what exactly is a gambling disorder </v>
<v Speaker 1>and why do some people struggle with it </v>

50
00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:52.010
<v Speaker 1>while others do not?</v>
<v Speaker 1>One point that research clearly shows is</v>

51
00:02:52.011 --> 00:02:52.844
<v Speaker 1>that gambling disorders are closely </v>
<v Speaker 1>linked with other psychological </v>

52
00:02:55.161 --> 00:02:55.994
<v Speaker 1>problems,</v>
<v Speaker 1>including depression and substance </v>

53
00:02:57.321 --> 00:03:00.340
<v Speaker 1>abuse.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We also know that over time,</v>

54
00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:04.210
<v Speaker 2>proximity to casinos does not impact the</v>
<v Speaker 2>prevalence of gambling disorders,</v>

55
00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:07.150
<v Speaker 2>and one of the vast majority of people </v>
<v Speaker 2>gamble responsibly.</v>

56
00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:11.080
<v Speaker 2>Approximately one percent of Americans </v>
<v Speaker 2>are diagnosed with a gambling disorder.</v>

57
00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:12.910
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it might not surprise you.</v>

58
00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:16.150
<v Speaker 2>Many of their findings are in direct </v>
<v Speaker 2>contradiction to scientific studies that</v>

59
00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:19.720
<v Speaker 2>aren't backed by casino dollars,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but rather than nitpicking everything,</v>

60
00:03:19.721 --> 00:03:20.554
<v Speaker 2>I want to focus on their macro message.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The biggest thing is that they want to </v>

61
00:03:23.561 --> 00:03:27.520
<v Speaker 2>imply that addicts are born that way </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're not created from a product.</v>

62
00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:30.730
<v Speaker 2>If you can blame addiction on brain </v>
<v Speaker 2>problems within the addict,</v>

63
00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:33.550
<v Speaker 2>your indirectly vindicating the gambling</v>
<v Speaker 2>machines,</v>

64
00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:34.863
<v Speaker 2>of course this is what the casinos want.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The most dangerous idea is that they </v>

65
00:03:38.051 --> 00:03:40.630
<v Speaker 2>have anything to do with creating </v>
<v Speaker 2>addicts,</v>

66
00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:43.630
<v Speaker 2>so instead they say it's not the product</v>
<v Speaker 2>that causes the problem.</v>

67
00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:44.823
<v Speaker 2>The problem is already within the addict</v>
<v Speaker 2>and just expresses itself in the </v>

68
00:03:47.471 --> 00:03:48.160
<v Speaker 2>addiction.</v>

69
00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:50.400
<v Speaker 2>The senior research director for the </v>
<v Speaker 2>NCRG,</v>

70
00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:52.810
<v Speaker 2>Christine Riley makes this bias </v>
<v Speaker 2>explicit.</v>

71
00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:55.450
<v Speaker 2>Things are not addictive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're just not.</v>

72
00:03:55.690 --> 00:03:56.523
<v Speaker 2>If you don't have that vulnerability,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the odds are you won't get addicted and </v>

73
00:03:59.861 --> 00:04:00.694
<v Speaker 2>the NCRG is willing to put up a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 2>money to any scientist who will agree </v>

74
00:04:03.971 --> 00:04:04.804
<v Speaker 2>with them and surprisingly one of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>people who took them up on that offer </v>

75
00:04:07.751 --> 00:04:09.430
<v Speaker 2>was Howard Schaefer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the main,</v>

76
00:04:09.431 --> 00:04:12.790
<v Speaker 2>quoted it earlier as calling slots the </v>
<v Speaker 2>crack cocaine of gambling.</v>

77
00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:14.103
<v Speaker 2>Today he tells a much different story </v>
<v Speaker 2>that casino games like slots aren't </v>

78
00:04:16.811 --> 00:04:19.750
<v Speaker 2>addictive,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and if this seems like a one 80 to you,</v>

79
00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:22.600
<v Speaker 2>you're not the only one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When asked about this contradiction,</v>

80
00:04:22.601 --> 00:04:24.970
<v Speaker 2>he tried really hard to square the two </v>
<v Speaker 2>opinions,</v>

81
00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:26.283
<v Speaker 3>but at one point you said slot machines.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Where the crack cocaine of gambling and </v>

82
00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:36.760
<v Speaker 3>how does that square with what you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>telling me today,</v>

83
00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:39.660
<v Speaker 4>not everybody who uses crack cocaine </v>
<v Speaker 4>becomes addicted.</v>

84
00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:41.793
<v Speaker 3>Nobody's going to sit here and try to </v>
<v Speaker 3>tell me crack cocaine isn't addictive </v>

85
00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:49.810
<v Speaker 3>and if this is like crack cocaine,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the conclusion is that it's addictive.</v>

86
00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:55.150
<v Speaker 4>I don't come to the same conclusion </v>
<v Speaker 4>because the majority of people that have</v>

87
00:04:55.151 --> 00:04:58.030
<v Speaker 4>used cocaine have not developed cocaine </v>
<v Speaker 4>addiction.</v>

88
00:04:58.510 --> 00:04:59.343
<v Speaker 4>Only a small minority.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And the same would be true with </v>

89
00:05:01.781 --> 00:05:02.180
<v Speaker 4>gambling.</v>

90
00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:03.230
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

91
00:05:03.290 --> 00:05:04.123
<v Speaker 2>Now obviously Howard shaffer would say </v>
<v Speaker 2>the millions of dollars in research </v>

92
00:05:06.981 --> 00:05:09.530
<v Speaker 2>funding he's received hasn't tainted his</v>
<v Speaker 2>research,</v>

93
00:05:09.531 --> 00:05:11.360
<v Speaker 2>but uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in Schaefer's words,</v>

94
00:05:11.670 --> 00:05:13.930
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't come to the same conclusion</v>

95
00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:15.500
<v Speaker 2>because we started to say the wrong </v>
<v Speaker 2>things.</v>

96
00:05:15.501 --> 00:05:16.334
<v Speaker 2>A lot of that funding would disappear.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Research funding from places like C or </v>

97
00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:20.353
<v Speaker 2>g,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but also mgm resorts and draft kings </v>

98
00:05:22.011 --> 00:05:22.844
<v Speaker 2>just to name a few.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And this strategy to by scientific </v>

99
00:05:25.461 --> 00:05:26.294
<v Speaker 2>research to shift the burden of </v>
<v Speaker 2>responsibility onto the addict and away </v>

100
00:05:29.001 --> 00:05:31.040
<v Speaker 2>from the product has been great for </v>
<v Speaker 2>casinos,</v>

101
00:05:31.041 --> 00:05:31.874
<v Speaker 2>public image,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it isn't the first time someone </v>

102
00:05:33.771 --> 00:05:34.604
<v Speaker 2>tried it.</v>

103
00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:35.993
<v Speaker 1>Assessment of the published data seemed </v>
<v Speaker 1>to show an association between certain </v>

104
00:05:41.211 --> 00:05:46.211
<v Speaker 1>types of cancer and excessive use of </v>
<v Speaker 1>cigarettes.</v>

105
00:05:46.460 --> 00:05:50.360
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very interested in finding out what kind</v>

106
00:05:50.361 --> 00:05:51.194
<v Speaker 1>of people are heavy smokers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is it a different nervous type of </v>

107
00:05:54.801 --> 00:05:55.634
<v Speaker 1>person?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is it a person who is differently to </v>

108
00:05:58.191 --> 00:05:59.024
<v Speaker 1>strain stress because it is very clear </v>
<v Speaker 1>that certain people just couldn't take </v>

109
00:06:05.061 --> 00:06:05.894
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

110
00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:15.850
<v Speaker 2>Certain people just can't take it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is exactly the same framing casinos</v>

111
00:06:15.851 --> 00:06:16.684
<v Speaker 2>use.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why do some people struggle with it </v>

112
00:06:18.460 --> 00:06:19.293
<v Speaker 2>while others do not?</v>

113
00:06:19.430 --> 00:06:21.980
<v Speaker 1>Certain people just can't take it.</v>

114
00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:23.233
<v Speaker 2>It's a simple,</v>
<v Speaker 2>powerful argument and whether or not </v>

115
00:06:25.611 --> 00:06:28.010
<v Speaker 2>anyone fully believes them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that isn't the point.</v>

116
00:06:28.580 --> 00:06:31.610
<v Speaker 2>The gambling industry winds,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even if all they do is confuse you.</v>

117
00:06:31.880 --> 00:06:32.713
<v Speaker 2>If they can cast doubt on the scientific</v>
<v Speaker 2>consensus of what causes gambling </v>

118
00:06:35.601 --> 00:06:36.434
<v Speaker 2>addiction,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they've won because nobody's going to </v>

119
00:06:38.151 --> 00:06:38.984
<v Speaker 2>legislate on something that the </v>
<v Speaker 2>scientific community isn't agreed upon </v>

120
00:06:41.660 --> 00:06:44.600
<v Speaker 2>and the problem of deliberate </v>
<v Speaker 2>misinformation is widespread.</v>

121
00:06:44.630 --> 00:06:46.730
<v Speaker 2>It goes beyond just smoking and </v>
<v Speaker 2>gambling.</v>

122
00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:47.833
<v Speaker 2>You can find it at Exxon where knowledge</v>
<v Speaker 2>of climate change was deliberately </v>

123
00:06:50.481 --> 00:06:51.314
<v Speaker 2>ignored and you can find it in the sugar</v>
<v Speaker 2>industry when they paid for research to </v>

124
00:06:54.321 --> 00:06:56.540
<v Speaker 2>blame heart disease on fat instead of </v>
<v Speaker 2>sugar.</v>

125
00:06:56.750 --> 00:06:59.000
<v Speaker 2>You can even find it in my favorite Soda</v>
<v Speaker 2>Company.</v>

126
00:06:59.001 --> 00:06:59.834
<v Speaker 2>Coca Cola,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when they publicly said they care about </v>

127
00:07:01.521 --> 00:07:04.310
<v Speaker 2>the problem of soft drinks,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but deny it in the science.</v>

128
00:07:04.640 --> 00:07:06.740
<v Speaker 2>So if we know this problem is </v>
<v Speaker 2>widespread,</v>

129
00:07:06.770 --> 00:07:08.540
<v Speaker 2>why do we continue to fall for it?</v>

130
00:07:09.680 --> 00:07:10.513
<v Speaker 2>There are two main models we use to deal</v>
<v Speaker 2>with research that has a conflict of </v>

131
00:07:12.861 --> 00:07:13.694
<v Speaker 2>interest.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can completely prohibit it or you </v>

132
00:07:15.501 --> 00:07:16.334
<v Speaker 2>can disclose the conflict of interest </v>
<v Speaker 2>and use peer review as a check and </v>

133
00:07:19.011 --> 00:07:19.844
<v Speaker 2>balance for a long time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We've used the ladder and assumed peer </v>

134
00:07:22.221 --> 00:07:25.520
<v Speaker 2>review would be enough because </v>
<v Speaker 2>prohibition just seems extreme,</v>

135
00:07:25.790 --> 00:07:29.170
<v Speaker 2>but many critics are now wondering </v>
<v Speaker 2>whether this is effective at keeping out</v>

136
00:07:29.171 --> 00:07:30.004
<v Speaker 2>bad science because the NCRG disclosed </v>
<v Speaker 2>it and yet they still manage to shove </v>

137
00:07:33.470 --> 00:07:35.630
<v Speaker 2>200 papers through the peer review </v>
<v Speaker 2>process.</v>

138
00:07:35.990 --> 00:07:39.380
<v Speaker 2>Even the tobacco industry funded </v>
<v Speaker 2>research that slipped favorable articles</v>

139
00:07:39.381 --> 00:07:41.900
<v Speaker 2>past the peer review process.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In my view,</v>

140
00:07:41.960 --> 00:07:42.793
<v Speaker 2>the risk is too great.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that more journals should </v>

141
00:07:45.021 --> 00:07:48.890
<v Speaker 2>seriously consider the prohibition model</v>
<v Speaker 2>when dealing with papers with an obvious</v>

142
00:07:48.891 --> 00:07:49.724
<v Speaker 2>conflict of interest.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We live in a world where the truth is </v>

143
00:07:52.341 --> 00:07:53.174
<v Speaker 2>not agreed upon very often,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the last thing we need is for </v>

144
00:07:56.031 --> 00:08:00.290
<v Speaker 2>science of beacon of objectivity to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>cluttered by bad actors who just want to</v>

145
00:08:00.291 --> 00:08:03.560
<v Speaker 2>confuse the scientific consensus and </v>
<v Speaker 2>prevent progress.</v>

146
00:08:03.950 --> 00:08:06.020
<v Speaker 1>So far,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what are the conclusions reached by your</v>

147
00:08:06.021 --> 00:08:07.790
<v Speaker 1>organization,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in my opinion,</v>

148
00:08:07.791 --> 00:08:11.840
<v Speaker 1>to single out smoking as a causal agent </v>
<v Speaker 1>is on the evidence today.</v>

149
00:08:11.860 --> 00:08:12.980
<v Speaker 1>Complete down.</v>
