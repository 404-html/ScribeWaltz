00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:02.610
<v Speaker 1>This isn't your everyday article 13 </v>
<v Speaker 1>video,</v>

2
00:00:02.670 --> 00:00:03.503
<v Speaker 1>which unfortunately I know because I </v>
<v Speaker 1>wrote that script and had to throw it </v>

3
00:00:06.721 --> 00:00:10.110
<v Speaker 1>out because of new changes that the EU </v>
<v Speaker 1>has made to their final proposal.</v>

4
00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:11.153
<v Speaker 1>They rewarded article 13 to take every </v>
<v Speaker 1>enforceable part of the bill and all </v>

5
00:00:14.761 --> 00:00:15.594
<v Speaker 1>they left is a giant pile of legal mush,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but before we get into all the changes </v>

6
00:00:18.931 --> 00:00:20.760
<v Speaker 1>and what it means,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's start with the basics.</v>

7
00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:21.683
<v Speaker 1>Article 13 is part of a European </v>
<v Speaker 1>copyright reform that says that </v>

8
00:00:24.091 --> 00:00:27.810
<v Speaker 1>copyrighted content has to be banned </v>
<v Speaker 1>upon upload by content hosting websites,</v>

9
00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:30.960
<v Speaker 1>and in the original document.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This meant that all copyrighted content,</v>

10
00:00:30.961 --> 00:00:31.794
<v Speaker 1>even copyright exceptions like parody,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fair dealing and educational videos </v>

11
00:00:34.381 --> 00:00:36.300
<v Speaker 1>would be affected.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Needless to say,</v>

12
00:00:36.301 --> 00:00:38.810
<v Speaker 1>the Internet was pretty angry and </v>
<v Speaker 1>worried about this</v>

13
00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:39.703
<v Speaker 2>new law.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The current proposal of article 13 will </v>

14
00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:46.140
<v Speaker 2>create large unintended consequences.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Article 13,</v>

15
00:00:46.141 --> 00:00:49.350
<v Speaker 2>when the content is uploaded,</v>
<v Speaker 2>unless they know for sure who owns every</v>

16
00:00:49.351 --> 00:00:51.450
<v Speaker 2>single part of it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it would make sense for youtube to allow</v>

17
00:00:51.451 --> 00:00:54.360
<v Speaker 2>for it to go up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Most talented creatives you know who are</v>

18
00:00:54.361 --> 00:00:58.170
<v Speaker 2>based in the EU will be banned from </v>
<v Speaker 2>Youtube.</v>

19
00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:02.260
<v Speaker 1>We're all going to be banned was the </v>
<v Speaker 1>general consensus because it's true.</v>

20
00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:04.270
<v Speaker 1>The first drafts of this law were </v>
<v Speaker 1>horrible,</v>

21
00:01:04.630 --> 00:01:05.463
<v Speaker 1>but no one has spent much time talking </v>
<v Speaker 1>about the massive changes that this law </v>

22
00:01:08.141 --> 00:01:10.030
<v Speaker 1>went through and what it means.</v>
<v Speaker 1>See,</v>

23
00:01:10.031 --> 00:01:13.570
<v Speaker 1>when I started my original script,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this was a much different article 13,</v>

24
00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:15.400
<v Speaker 1>it was 900 words,</v>
<v Speaker 1>eight sections,</v>

25
00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:16.383
<v Speaker 1>and it talked far more specifically </v>
<v Speaker 1>about repercussions who would be </v>

26
00:01:18.521 --> 00:01:20.200
<v Speaker 1>affected and how it would be </v>
<v Speaker 1>implemented,</v>

27
00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:24.220
<v Speaker 1>but after months of discussion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the EU has settled on a new version that</v>

28
00:01:24.221 --> 00:01:25.054
<v Speaker 1>takes out every specific guideline and </v>
<v Speaker 1>leaves us with vague words like best </v>

29
00:01:28.181 --> 00:01:30.520
<v Speaker 1>practices,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cooperation with rights holders,</v>

30
00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:33.580
<v Speaker 1>large amounts appropriate and </v>
<v Speaker 1>proportionate.</v>

31
00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:35.193
<v Speaker 1>You still get the feeling reading it </v>
<v Speaker 1>that it will have big implications for </v>

32
00:01:37.301 --> 00:01:38.134
<v Speaker 1>copyright,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's nothing to build rules </v>

33
00:01:39.461 --> 00:01:40.294
<v Speaker 1>around because nothing is clearly </v>
<v Speaker 1>defined for people like youtube or </v>

34
00:01:42.911 --> 00:01:44.860
<v Speaker 1>facebook that will be affected by this </v>
<v Speaker 1>bill.</v>

35
00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:48.670
<v Speaker 1>This thing turned from a law about </v>
<v Speaker 1>copyright enforcement to be more like an</v>

36
00:01:48.671 --> 00:01:49.504
<v Speaker 1>announcement about a law about copyright</v>
<v Speaker 1>enforcement that someday in the future </v>

37
00:01:52.571 --> 00:01:55.180
<v Speaker 1>will be further defined,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which as it turns out,</v>

38
00:01:55.181 --> 00:01:59.920
<v Speaker 1>is kind of an EU strategy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Making laws vague has its advantages,</v>

39
00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:01.263
<v Speaker 1>but this is a huge problem for companies</v>
<v Speaker 1>outside of the EU and leaves us with a </v>

40
00:02:04.421 --> 00:02:07.660
<v Speaker 1>question,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what should we do with vague laws?</v>

41
00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:13.180
<v Speaker 3>What are the rules when you kept your </v>
<v Speaker 3>brain,</v>

42
00:02:16.821 --> 00:02:19.430
<v Speaker 3>but the world is insane.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How the hail you,</v>

43
00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:20.293
<v Speaker 3>Donna.</v>

44
00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:24.233
<v Speaker 1>Let's start by talking about the U.</v>
<v Speaker 1>S which actually has laws about vague </v>

45
00:02:27.331 --> 00:02:28.164
<v Speaker 1>laws in the US.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's something called the vagueness </v>

46
00:02:30.181 --> 00:02:31.014
<v Speaker 1>doctrine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It says the criminal laws and sometimes </v>

47
00:02:32.641 --> 00:02:33.474
<v Speaker 1>civil laws that aren't clear as to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>understandable by a man of common </v>

48
00:02:36.331 --> 00:02:39.420
<v Speaker 1>intelligence are void or to put it </v>
<v Speaker 1>another way,</v>

49
00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:41.430
<v Speaker 1>you can't be punished for breaking the </v>
<v Speaker 1>law.</v>

50
00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:45.330
<v Speaker 1>You're not sure how to keep in the US.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was a case of the FCC,</v>

51
00:02:45.331 --> 00:02:46.164
<v Speaker 1>Verse Fox,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which illustrates how this works using </v>

52
00:02:47.791 --> 00:02:50.820
<v Speaker 1>America's two favorite things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>bad words and nudity.</v>

53
00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:51.923
<v Speaker 1>The FCC has these rules on broadcasting </v>
<v Speaker 1>that are called obscenity laws that say </v>

54
00:02:55.831 --> 00:02:59.130
<v Speaker 1>what you can and cannot show on tv what </v>
<v Speaker 1>is appropriate and what is not.</v>

55
00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:00.153
<v Speaker 1>The problem is that obscenity is an </v>
<v Speaker 1>incredibly difficult thing to define </v>

56
00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:04.870
<v Speaker 1>because as we discussed in a previous </v>
<v Speaker 1>video,</v>

57
00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:06.003
<v Speaker 1>what's obscene is always changing and </v>
<v Speaker 1>rather than take a stab at any ways and </v>

58
00:03:09.641 --> 00:03:13.150
<v Speaker 1>make specific rules,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the FCC decided to be ambiguous.</v>

59
00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:14.163
<v Speaker 1>They described what is inappropriate </v>
<v Speaker 1>using words like patently offensive by </v>

60
00:03:17.591 --> 00:03:18.424
<v Speaker 1>contemporary community standards and </v>
<v Speaker 1>this all came to a head when during an </v>

61
00:03:22.511 --> 00:03:26.710
<v Speaker 1>award show a couple people dropped f </v>
<v Speaker 1>bombs and later Fox aired partial nudity</v>

62
00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:29.950
<v Speaker 1>as really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really fucking brands.</v>

63
00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:35.040
<v Speaker 1>So after these programs were aired,</v>
<v Speaker 1>FCC sent out a new ruling,</v>

64
00:03:38.301 --> 00:03:40.490
<v Speaker 1>further defining they're vague obscenity</v>
<v Speaker 1>laws,</v>

65
00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:41.653
<v Speaker 1>and then tried to hold Fox accountable </v>
<v Speaker 1>for breaking those new descriptions of </v>

66
00:03:44.391 --> 00:03:45.224
<v Speaker 1>what obscenities look like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The case of whether the FCC could find </v>

67
00:03:48.231 --> 00:03:49.064
<v Speaker 1>Fox for breaking their newly defined </v>
<v Speaker 1>obscenity laws when all the way up to </v>

68
00:03:52.191 --> 00:03:53.024
<v Speaker 1>the Supreme Court who eventually decided</v>
<v Speaker 1>that because Fox didn't know ahead of </v>

69
00:03:55.821 --> 00:03:58.670
<v Speaker 1>time what constituted obscenity and </v>
<v Speaker 1>indecent anus,</v>

70
00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:03.590
<v Speaker 1>the law was too vague to prosecute them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is how the US handles vagueness.</v>

71
00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:04.693
<v Speaker 1>Now back to the EU.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't have an explicit vagueness </v>

72
00:04:07.191 --> 00:04:08.024
<v Speaker 1>doctrine and this has caused a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 1>problems for American tech companies in </v>

73
00:04:11.271 --> 00:04:12.104
<v Speaker 1>a similar way to how Fox almost got in </v>
<v Speaker 1>trouble for breaking rules that weren't </v>

74
00:04:14.541 --> 00:04:15.374
<v Speaker 1>clearly defined.</v>

75
00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:18.170
<v Speaker 1>Google did get in trouble in Europe for </v>
<v Speaker 1>the same reason.</v>

76
00:04:18.710 --> 00:04:22.370
<v Speaker 1>They were reasonably fine for breaking </v>
<v Speaker 1>antitrust laws that ruled that they were</v>

77
00:04:22.371 --> 00:04:26.480
<v Speaker 1>being anti competitive by pre installing</v>
<v Speaker 1>certain apps on their android devices.</v>

78
00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:27.793
<v Speaker 1>The problem,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Google says they didn't know this was </v>

79
00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:32.690
<v Speaker 1>anti competitive in their statement back</v>
<v Speaker 1>to the EU.</v>

80
00:04:32.691 --> 00:04:33.524
<v Speaker 1>They argue that the EU has reason to </v>
<v Speaker 1>impose a fine rested on a novel legal </v>

81
00:04:36.831 --> 00:04:38.120
<v Speaker 1>theory.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In conclusion,</v>

82
00:04:38.121 --> 00:04:38.954
<v Speaker 1>they say there is no precedent for </v>
<v Speaker 1>characterize and Google's conduct as an </v>

83
00:04:41.781 --> 00:04:45.380
<v Speaker 1>illegal abuse.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The rules must be knowable in advance,</v>

84
00:04:45.950 --> 00:04:47.750
<v Speaker 1>but there aren't any vagueness laws in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Europe,</v>

85
00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:48.613
<v Speaker 1>which means that that line of reasoning </v>
<v Speaker 1>didn't stop the EU from leveling of </v>

86
00:04:51.231 --> 00:04:52.064
<v Speaker 1>$5,000,000,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>fine against Google all for violating a </v>

87
00:04:55.041 --> 00:04:58.370
<v Speaker 1>rule that Google says they didn't know </v>
<v Speaker 1>at the time they were breaking.</v>

88
00:04:58.940 --> 00:04:59.773
<v Speaker 1>This is the problem with vague laws.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Either you can't enforce them or the </v>

89
00:05:02.421 --> 00:05:05.420
<v Speaker 1>enforcement seems arbitrary and unfair </v>
<v Speaker 1>and look,</v>

90
00:05:05.450 --> 00:05:07.670
<v Speaker 1>there are compelling reasons to make </v>
<v Speaker 1>vague laws.</v>

91
00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:08.773
<v Speaker 1>Judges get more latitude to interpret </v>
<v Speaker 1>with the changing times and if you can </v>

92
00:05:11.721 --> 00:05:14.480
<v Speaker 1>give the member states the ability to </v>
<v Speaker 1>interpret those vague laws,</v>

93
00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:15.613
<v Speaker 1>but many people say that that doesn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>outweigh the huge cons that come with </v>

94
00:05:18.201 --> 00:05:19.034
<v Speaker 1>ambiguous legislation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The number one problem being nobody </v>

95
00:05:21.561 --> 00:05:22.394
<v Speaker 1>knows how to follow your rules and </v>
<v Speaker 1>example of this can be seen in another </v>

96
00:05:25.101 --> 00:05:25.934
<v Speaker 1>EU law.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The general data protection regulation </v>

97
00:05:27.770 --> 00:05:29.930
<v Speaker 1>has also been accused of being too </v>
<v Speaker 1>vague.</v>

98
00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:30.913
<v Speaker 1>They defined personal data in such a way</v>
<v Speaker 1>that it could mean basically anything </v>

99
00:05:34.250 --> 00:05:35.083
<v Speaker 1>which has left tech companies scrambling</v>
<v Speaker 1>to try to get into compliance with the </v>

100
00:05:37.821 --> 00:05:38.654
<v Speaker 1>law.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They aren't sure they understand and </v>

101
00:05:40.701 --> 00:05:45.020
<v Speaker 1>this is the EU playbook.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They declare really broad guidelines but</v>

102
00:05:45.021 --> 00:05:47.330
<v Speaker 1>won't specifically define the rules of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the road.</v>

103
00:05:47.630 --> 00:05:48.463
<v Speaker 1>Instead,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just left to these companies to </v>

104
00:05:49.191 --> 00:05:53.270
<v Speaker 1>self define and the price of being wrong</v>
<v Speaker 1>is devastating to companies,</v>

105
00:05:53.480 --> 00:05:54.313
<v Speaker 1>which is why everyone seems to be an </v>
<v Speaker 1>edge with what the EU will do next as </v>

106
00:05:57.140 --> 00:06:01.610
<v Speaker 1>flex their regulatory muscles,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this brings us back to article 13.</v>

107
00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:02.713
<v Speaker 1>Nobody's quite sure what the EU means </v>
<v Speaker 1>when they say measures to ensure the </v>

108
00:06:05.421 --> 00:06:06.254
<v Speaker 1>functioning of agreements with rights </v>
<v Speaker 1>holders or means when they say use of </v>

109
00:06:09.141 --> 00:06:09.974
<v Speaker 1>effective content recognition </v>
<v Speaker 1>technologies shall be appropriate and </v>

110
00:06:13.011 --> 00:06:13.844
<v Speaker 1>proportionate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what is clear is that article 13 </v>

111
00:06:16.101 --> 00:06:21.101
<v Speaker 1>means a lot more than it says because if</v>
<v Speaker 1>the first proposals of article 13 or any</v>

112
00:06:21.651 --> 00:06:25.310
<v Speaker 1>indication of the longterm plan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>copyright exceptions,</v>

113
00:06:25.311 --> 00:06:29.930
<v Speaker 1>memes and fair dealing will not be </v>
<v Speaker 1>protected or worse allowed at all in the</v>

114
00:06:29.931 --> 00:06:32.750
<v Speaker 1>EU,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which threatens content creators like me</v>

115
00:06:32.780 --> 00:06:34.010
<v Speaker 1>and many,</v>
<v Speaker 1>many,</v>

116
00:06:34.040 --> 00:06:34.873
<v Speaker 1>many others.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If we look at the EU history of vague </v>

117
00:06:37.491 --> 00:06:39.650
<v Speaker 1>law,</v>
<v Speaker 1>making it clear that Google,</v>

118
00:06:39.680 --> 00:06:40.520
<v Speaker 1>facebook,</v>
<v Speaker 1>reddit,</v>

119
00:06:40.550 --> 00:06:41.383
<v Speaker 1>all these tech companies and all these </v>
<v Speaker 1>youtubers have every reason to be very </v>

120
00:06:44.811 --> 00:06:47.180
<v Speaker 1>scared over these new laws and protest </v>
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>

121
00:06:47.181 --> 00:06:48.014
<v Speaker 1>Defiantly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think we all should not because </v>

122
00:06:50.091 --> 00:06:54.950
<v Speaker 1>article 13 says all that much,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but because of what the EU can later say</v>

123
00:06:55.250 --> 00:06:56.200
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>mental alarm,</v>

124
00:07:01.290 --> 00:07:05.950
<v Speaker 4>this thing on this is a new mic so </v>
<v Speaker 4>you'll have to bear with me as we figure</v>

125
00:07:05.951 --> 00:07:09.130
<v Speaker 4>out how to use it together.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Our sponsor today is Nord Vpn,</v>

126
00:07:09.131 --> 00:07:09.964
<v Speaker 4>which is a very timely sponsored,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you're going to be affected by </v>

127
00:07:12.010 --> 00:07:15.790
<v Speaker 4>article 13 or any of these other wacky </v>
<v Speaker 4>Internet regulations that a lot of these</v>

128
00:07:15.791 --> 00:07:17.430
<v Speaker 4>countries are pursuing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>A,</v>

129
00:07:17.680 --> 00:07:21.130
<v Speaker 4>you need to be protected and you'll be </v>
<v Speaker 4>protected by a vpn.</v>

130
00:07:21.220 --> 00:07:23.770
<v Speaker 4>I've used vpns when I did a study abroad</v>
<v Speaker 4>in college.</v>

131
00:07:24.130 --> 00:07:27.550
<v Speaker 4>I went to cutter or Qatar,</v>
<v Speaker 4>however you prefer to say it,</v>

132
00:07:27.610 --> 00:07:29.660
<v Speaker 4>and I had to use vpns all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

133
00:07:29.710 --> 00:07:31.810
<v Speaker 4>because the internet there is very </v>
<v Speaker 4>regulated.</v>

134
00:07:31.900 --> 00:07:33.820
<v Speaker 4>Even a simple thing like watching a </v>
<v Speaker 4>football game,</v>

135
00:07:33.821 --> 00:07:37.510
<v Speaker 4>you want to go to a local server,</v>
<v Speaker 4>just hop on your vpn and you get there.</v>

136
00:07:37.960 --> 00:07:40.220
<v Speaker 4>But vpns go a lot further than just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

137
00:07:40.960 --> 00:07:42.550
<v Speaker 4>looking like you're from somewhere else.</v>

138
00:07:42.840 --> 00:07:45.400
<v Speaker 4>A really,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're about data privacy and this is a</v>

139
00:07:45.401 --> 00:07:47.460
<v Speaker 4>big problem in our modern world.</v>
<v Speaker 4>People are getting better and better,</v>

140
00:07:47.461 --> 00:07:48.610
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>stealing your information,</v>

141
00:07:48.880 --> 00:07:49.713
<v Speaker 4>especially if you like to go to coffee </v>
<v Speaker 4>shops or hotels or you're in airports a </v>

142
00:07:53.501 --> 00:07:55.330
<v Speaker 4>lot.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is a huge problem.</v>

143
00:07:55.331 --> 00:07:56.164
<v Speaker 4>You're data is unprotected and the </v>
<v Speaker 4>things you're sending over the Internet </v>

144
00:07:59.200 --> 00:08:01.360
<v Speaker 4>can be looked at,</v>
<v Speaker 4>can be stolen,</v>

145
00:08:01.600 --> 00:08:03.490
<v Speaker 4>so that's something you want to protect </v>
<v Speaker 4>yourself from.</v>

146
00:08:03.580 --> 00:08:06.880
<v Speaker 4>And one way to do that is a vpn.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The way I think about vpns is there kind</v>

147
00:08:06.881 --> 00:08:11.170
<v Speaker 4>of like a seatbelt for the data world.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You don't need them very often,</v>

148
00:08:11.200 --> 00:08:12.033
<v Speaker 4>but when you do you're really glad you </v>
<v Speaker 4>have them because they keep you from a </v>

149
00:08:16.061 --> 00:08:16.894
<v Speaker 4>disaster.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And one of the really big cells of Nord </v>

150
00:08:18.881 --> 00:08:19.714
<v Speaker 4>for me is the simplicity of use because </v>
<v Speaker 4>I've used vpns in the past and they're </v>

151
00:08:23.940 --> 00:08:24.773
<v Speaker 4>very complicated and they're hard to set</v>
<v Speaker 4>up a nord is probably the simplest that </v>

152
00:08:28.661 --> 00:08:29.494
<v Speaker 4>I've tried at least.</v>

153
00:08:29.740 --> 00:08:31.930
<v Speaker 4>And I'm going to show you just how easy </v>
<v Speaker 4>it is,</v>

154
00:08:31.931 --> 00:08:34.510
<v Speaker 4>like on something like your phone,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which I use all the time.</v>

155
00:08:35.320 --> 00:08:36.153
<v Speaker 4>So let's say you're just browsing the </v>
<v Speaker 4>internet as you do and you realize </v>

156
00:08:40.001 --> 00:08:43.510
<v Speaker 4>suddenly you're on public Wifi and your </v>
<v Speaker 4>data is out there for anybody.</v>

157
00:08:43.970 --> 00:08:44.920
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what you're gonna want to do.</v>

158
00:08:44.950 --> 00:08:47.650
<v Speaker 4>You go to North Vpn,</v>
<v Speaker 4>all you do,</v>

159
00:08:47.710 --> 00:08:51.310
<v Speaker 4>press quick connect and boom,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it is that easy.</v>

160
00:08:51.400 --> 00:08:54.070
<v Speaker 4>For me,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the simplicity is pretty much everything</v>

161
00:08:54.130 --> 00:08:55.920
<v Speaker 4>because like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's like a seatbelt.</v>

162
00:08:55.980 --> 00:08:58.590
<v Speaker 4>You want it there,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you don't want it in your way.</v>

163
00:08:58.920 --> 00:09:01.800
<v Speaker 4>So if you're thinking about getting a </v>
<v Speaker 4>vpn and you're a fan of the show,</v>

164
00:09:01.950 --> 00:09:06.380
<v Speaker 4>you can go to north vpn.com/coffee</v>
<v Speaker 4>break to get 75 percent off,</v>

165
00:09:06.430 --> 00:09:07.263
<v Speaker 4>three years and an extra month free.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's [inaudible] dot com slash coffee </v>

166
00:09:11.191 --> 00:09:12.024
<v Speaker 4>break.</v>
