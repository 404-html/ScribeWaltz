1
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:05,310
I told you and have it applied.

2
00:00:06,910 --> 00:00:07,743
Okay.

3
00:00:08,810 --> 00:00:12,620
I think the first time I watched rick
reunite with Ilsa was during one of my

4
00:00:12,621 --> 00:00:16,880
film classes in College Larson.
I have watched a great many old films

5
00:00:16,881 --> 00:00:19,880
during those lectures.
Most of which I think both of us don't

6
00:00:19,881 --> 00:00:23,360
really remember that well is we had the
tendency to doze off and those

7
00:00:23,361 --> 00:00:26,420
comfortable sit in my seats.
That was until Cassa blank.

8
00:00:26,421 --> 00:00:30,330
I came around and managed to firmly
break that cycle of it's quick witted

9
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:35,360
dialogue
and sambal memorable characters and of

10
00:00:37,341 --> 00:00:38,510
course it's music.

11
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:42,410
Ooh,

12
00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:46,280
the most of all is the film's overall
story that makes her such an enjoyable

13
00:00:46,281 --> 00:00:51,140
viewing experience and it was only after
I'd read Robert McKee aptly named book

14
00:00:51,141 --> 00:00:54,430
story that I fully came to understand
why kiss a blank.

15
00:00:54,431 --> 00:00:58,010
I can be seen as a sort of gold standard
for great storytelling.

16
00:00:58,340 --> 00:01:01,340
Soon this video,
I'd like to deviate from our usual

17
00:01:01,341 --> 00:01:05,660
format and provide you a more practical
look into the realm of storytelling as a

18
00:01:05,661 --> 00:01:06,980
whole.
To do this.

19
00:01:06,981 --> 00:01:10,340
I'll guide you through and Mickey's
guidelines for scene analysis and we'll

20
00:01:10,341 --> 00:01:12,900
take an in depth look and one of gas
blankets.

21
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:15,200
Most pivotal scenes.
It's

22
00:01:21,510 --> 00:01:24,210
not a scene that I,
once you analyze its guests of Blanco's

23
00:01:24,211 --> 00:01:27,590
midair climax,
which is being set up right here as rick

24
00:01:27,591 --> 00:01:29,660
spots.
It'll saw walking around to market,

25
00:01:30,260 --> 00:01:32,990
but before we get into that,
we first need to answer the following

26
00:01:32,991 --> 00:01:33,710
question.

27
00:01:33,710 --> 00:01:36,380
What makes a scene work?
Some might say it,

28
00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:40,490
it's good dialogue or nice visuals and
although these things definitely help

29
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:43,820
when key notes to the determining factor
lies within the subjects.

30
00:01:43,821 --> 00:01:45,800
Then the underlying structure of the
scene.

31
00:01:46,190 --> 00:01:49,700
Now what does this mean within scenes,
we can make the distinction between

32
00:01:49,701 --> 00:01:52,460
texts,
sensory service off the image or an auto

33
00:01:52,461 --> 00:01:54,420
words.
Everything that we see and here on

34
00:01:54,421 --> 00:01:57,650
screen and subutex,
which are all defaults,

35
00:01:57,651 --> 00:02:00,680
feelings and conscious as well as
unconscious desires.

36
00:02:00,681 --> 00:02:02,860
If the characters on screen and not a
words,

37
00:02:02,870 --> 00:02:06,890
everything that is unseen or actively
being veiled behind the sensory surfers

38
00:02:06,891 --> 00:02:11,891
of the text.
If characters lack multiple layers,

39
00:02:19,051 --> 00:02:22,230
they tend to feel bland,
which causes them to feel fake and

40
00:02:22,231 --> 00:02:25,650
dialogue to suffer as a consequence
which take a look at the segment from

41
00:02:25,651 --> 00:02:26,484
bill harbor.

42
00:02:30,030 --> 00:02:31,150
It's your nose.

43
00:02:35,110 --> 00:02:38,050
What has happened here is that the
subtext has been written directly into

44
00:02:38,051 --> 00:02:40,660
the text,
which is commonly known as writing on

45
00:02:40,661 --> 00:02:42,310
the nose.
Good films,

46
00:02:42,311 --> 00:02:44,650
on the other hand,
generally have derek characters express

47
00:02:44,651 --> 00:02:49,330
themselves through subtext seems move
because conscious and unconscious

48
00:02:49,331 --> 00:02:52,540
desires clash.
That's writers continuously up the

49
00:02:52,541 --> 00:02:55,870
stakes and with dark characters on the
spot because they know it's the

50
00:02:55,871 --> 00:02:59,830
decisions they make,
the actions they take that tell us more

51
00:02:59,831 --> 00:03:03,800
about a character then any piece of
surface level dialogue ever could just

52
00:03:03,910 --> 00:03:05,330
try them too.
You

53
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:07,960
not so fast,
lilly,

54
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:10,770
nobody is going to be arrested,
not for a while yet.

55
00:03:11,250 --> 00:03:14,190
Now that we've covered that,
let's go back to the mid at climax and

56
00:03:14,191 --> 00:03:18,000
analyze how it gets a blank.
I use subutex to move to seeing forward.

57
00:03:18,570 --> 00:03:22,260
The first two things that we want to do
is one defined a conflict at the scene

58
00:03:22,261 --> 00:03:25,440
and to note the opening value.
To do this.

59
00:03:25,441 --> 00:03:28,080
We will need to briefly cover the
context of the scene.

60
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:30,830
So for those of you are already very
familiar with the movie,

61
00:03:30,831 --> 00:03:34,470
you feel free to skip ahead.
Rick Blaine is a former freedom fighter

62
00:03:34,471 --> 00:03:38,060
turned saloon owner and castle blank,
or during the Second World War as

63
00:03:38,090 --> 00:03:41,970
cynical nature's revealed early on to be
caused by a devastating heartbreak he

64
00:03:41,971 --> 00:03:46,860
experienced the year earlier in Paris,
his goal friend and soon to be wife Ilsa

65
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:49,050
Lund abandoned him.
Today you were supposed to escape the

66
00:03:49,051 --> 00:03:52,860
city from the Nazis together.
Fast forward a year and a to run into

67
00:03:52,861 --> 00:03:54,840
each other by coincidence and rick's
bar,

68
00:03:55,020 --> 00:03:55,770
it'll sound,
however,

69
00:03:55,770 --> 00:03:57,990
is not come alone.
And during the late nine meetup,

70
00:03:57,991 --> 00:04:00,230
rick drunkenly,
he calls her out for being a horror as

71
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:01,530
she attempts to explain herself.

72
00:04:01,670 --> 00:04:04,760
Tell me,
what did you left me?

73
00:04:06,190 --> 00:04:11,190
Lazlo are there others in between?
Aren't you the kind of tell

74
00:04:11,450 --> 00:04:14,540
after which you angrily barges out,
which takes us back to the market scene.

75
00:04:14,750 --> 00:04:17,900
So did define the conflict.
We need to note the desires of the main

76
00:04:17,901 --> 00:04:21,140
characters and play.
Rick initiated the Seton and despite his

77
00:04:21,141 --> 00:04:25,070
inner resentment,
has goal is clear to when sub back her

78
00:04:25,071 --> 00:04:27,200
motivations on the other hand aren't
clear yet,

79
00:04:27,230 --> 00:04:31,190
but they're encounter tonight before
plus her guarded attitude right now give

80
00:04:31,191 --> 00:04:33,170
away to,
she has an active interest in keeping

81
00:04:33,171 --> 00:04:36,980
her affair with rick in the past.
The opening value of the scene is love

82
00:04:37,310 --> 00:04:40,730
else's relationship to victor.
Laszlo has not been made clear yet,

83
00:04:40,731 --> 00:04:43,970
so rick sees an opportunity to reunite
with his former lover.

84
00:04:44,170 --> 00:04:47,330
The value is there for a positive,
which brings us to the first step.

85
00:04:47,420 --> 00:04:51,050
Breaking the scene and two beats.
Now beat is an exchange of action

86
00:04:51,051 --> 00:04:55,790
reaction in character behavior both on a
textual as well and more importantly on

87
00:04:55,791 --> 00:04:58,490
a subtextual level.
So let's see if we can mark all the

88
00:04:58,491 --> 00:04:59,390
beats in this scene.

89
00:04:59,820 --> 00:05:04,050
You will not find a trade like this in
only 700 francs.

90
00:05:04,140 --> 00:05:07,220
The first one is established right here
before either rick or hills.

91
00:05:07,221 --> 00:05:10,860
I have even uttered a single word.
Rick's action is to approach her.

92
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:12,030
It was a,
on the other hand,

93
00:05:12,031 --> 00:05:14,160
sensing his presence,
chooses to ignore him,

94
00:05:15,310 --> 00:05:16,143
cheated

95
00:05:17,590 --> 00:05:21,490
rick opens by protecting her from the
salesman and are now acknowledges his

96
00:05:21,491 --> 00:05:24,280
existence but chooses to reject his
advances.

97
00:05:24,340 --> 00:05:27,010
Rick's Voris who,
whoever seem to hint that more heals us

98
00:05:27,011 --> 00:05:28,450
relationship with Laszlo.

99
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:32,130
Hi there ladies kinds of weeks.
We have a small discount.

100
00:05:32,310 --> 00:05:36,180
Did I say 700 francs?
You can have a 200 I'm sorry I was in no

101
00:05:36,181 --> 00:05:38,430
condition to receive you when you called
on me last night.

102
00:05:38,570 --> 00:05:39,520
It doesn't matter.
No,

103
00:05:39,530 --> 00:05:43,530
no special friends Albany cause we have
a special discount of 100 flags.

104
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:46,820
Brick now tries to hide his
embarrassment by using excessive for

105
00:05:46,821 --> 00:05:50,510
melody to apologize for his behavior,
but it also remains unimpressed.

106
00:05:50,670 --> 00:05:54,010
The story had me a little confused.
Maybe it was a boy bourbon.

107
00:05:54,100 --> 00:05:56,940
I have some table called some neck pain.
I'm really not.

108
00:05:57,020 --> 00:05:58,190
Please one minute please.

109
00:05:58,270 --> 00:06:01,570
Still attempting to open up the
conversation he moves to excuse making,

110
00:06:01,571 --> 00:06:04,120
but yet again hills or we'll have none
of it yet.

111
00:06:04,121 --> 00:06:07,390
She doesn't choose to leave.
Also notice how the role of the salesman

112
00:06:07,391 --> 00:06:11,230
is not really at all about comically
selling his lace to Ilsa,

113
00:06:11,290 --> 00:06:13,450
but rather about selling rick to Elsa.

114
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:17,440
Why did you come back to tell me why you
ran out on me at the railway station?

115
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:18,833
Yes.

116
00:06:19,140 --> 00:06:22,380
Rick desperately tries to get his foot
in the door by asking her a question

117
00:06:22,381 --> 00:06:25,020
that provides his own answer and it
works.

118
00:06:25,070 --> 00:06:26,910
It was,
that opens up just a tiny bit.

119
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:28,390
I do.
You can tell me now.

120
00:06:28,391 --> 00:06:31,080
I'm reasonably showgirls.
I don't think I will rick

121
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:33,150
by insulting them.
Rick is at this point,

122
00:06:33,151 --> 00:06:37,590
essentially begging tools are in his own
way where she's no longer rejecting him

123
00:06:37,591 --> 00:06:40,200
completely,
but opposing him and asking for more.

124
00:06:40,850 --> 00:06:42,320
Why not?
After all that got stuck with the

125
00:06:42,321 --> 00:06:45,980
railway ticket,
I think I'm entitled to know last night

126
00:06:45,981 --> 00:06:49,400
I saw what has happened to you,
the rain can you in Paris?

127
00:06:49,401 --> 00:06:52,910
I could tell him he don't understand at
the one who looked at me with such

128
00:06:52,911 --> 00:06:53,744
hatred,

129
00:06:53,790 --> 00:06:57,090
rick losing his patient slightly moves
to guilt tripping ill zones to be an

130
00:06:57,091 --> 00:06:58,910
explanation.
But both parties feel like dare to

131
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:00,630
victims.
So it'll say guilt trips,

132
00:07:00,631 --> 00:07:01,470
rick right back.

133
00:07:04,010 --> 00:07:06,640
How believing Casablanca soon and we'll
never see each other again.

134
00:07:08,170 --> 00:07:10,900
We knew very little about each other
when we were in love in Paris.

135
00:07:12,580 --> 00:07:14,860
We'll leave it that way.
Maybe we'll remember those days.

136
00:07:14,861 --> 00:07:18,430
Not Casablanca,
not last night.

137
00:07:19,490 --> 00:07:22,490
Ilsa now takes over to the initiative by
trying to see her goodbye to rick,

138
00:07:22,580 --> 00:07:26,030
who then completely refuses to react and
instead starts to next beat.

139
00:07:26,220 --> 00:07:28,990
Did you run out me because you couldn't
take it because you knew what it would

140
00:07:28,991 --> 00:07:31,990
be like hiding from the police running
away all the time.

141
00:07:32,830 --> 00:07:34,110
It can believe that if you want to.

142
00:07:34,340 --> 00:07:37,370
So now he decides to hit her with his
best guests for an extra nation by

143
00:07:37,371 --> 00:07:40,490
calling her a coward.
Those are no cysts to be false.

144
00:07:40,491 --> 00:07:43,550
So she insults him,
ride back by basically calling him a

145
00:07:43,551 --> 00:07:44,210
fool.

146
00:07:44,210 --> 00:07:45,980
Well,
I'm not running away anymore.

147
00:07:45,981 --> 00:07:48,290
I'm settled now above us alone.
That's true.

148
00:07:48,291 --> 00:07:51,810
But the walk up a flight,
I'll be expecting you.

149
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:57,780
The spider continuous denials,
rick sends us her true feelings in

150
00:07:57,781 --> 00:08:01,980
sexually propositions for two facts and
she tries to hide her blush on her hat

151
00:08:01,981 --> 00:08:04,580
brim.
Rick now feels like she's almost within

152
00:08:04,620 --> 00:08:05,453
his reach,

153
00:08:05,670 --> 00:08:08,040
all the same.
Someday you'll lie the Laszlo,

154
00:08:08,580 --> 00:08:12,210
you'll be there.
No,

155
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:17,820
no.
You say Victor Laszlo is my husband and

156
00:08:17,821 --> 00:08:20,040
was even when I knew you in Paris.

157
00:08:20,590 --> 00:08:22,720
But again,
rick can contain his pain and calls her

158
00:08:22,721 --> 00:08:25,870
out for being a whore.
It was a haven't been called a slut for

159
00:08:25,871 --> 00:08:28,520
the second time.
Reaches for the one thing she knows who

160
00:08:28,521 --> 00:08:31,600
will hit the hardest because the
revelation that she'd always been

161
00:08:31,601 --> 00:08:35,110
married to Laszlo would imply that she
just used rick for her own pleasure in

162
00:08:35,111 --> 00:08:38,110
Paris and that our love had never been
real all along.

163
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:40,690
However,
the subtext of the scene gives away to

164
00:08:40,691 --> 00:08:43,990
quite the opposite is the truth.
But of course rick doesn't know that yet

165
00:08:43,991 --> 00:08:46,360
and was left devastated as Ilsa walks
off.

166
00:08:47,590 --> 00:08:51,520
So at the end of the scene to hopeful
positive opening value has changed into

167
00:08:51,521 --> 00:08:54,580
a deep and dark negative.
And the final step of our analysis,

168
00:08:54,581 --> 00:08:57,810
we can see how to writers of guests a
blank and I've built a rapid progression

169
00:08:57,811 --> 00:09:00,810
of beets,
each placing in governing value of love

170
00:09:00,811 --> 00:09:04,320
at greater risk,
the 11 beat marks to climax and turning

171
00:09:04,321 --> 00:09:07,830
point of the scene after which the
opening value changes to its closing

172
00:09:07,831 --> 00:09:08,520
value.

173
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:11,130
Of course the scene is,
but a minor part in the massive full

174
00:09:11,131 --> 00:09:15,300
piece of writing that is Casablanca has
basically every scene in a movie as

175
00:09:15,301 --> 00:09:18,390
great if not greater than the one we
just analyze.

176
00:09:18,660 --> 00:09:22,290
But it goes to show how much attention
to scene structure and subutex has gone

177
00:09:22,291 --> 00:09:24,570
into the film.
And by having explored that,

178
00:09:24,571 --> 00:09:29,310
I hope to shed a light minor as it may
be on a craft of screenwriting as a

179
00:09:29,311 --> 00:09:32,010
whole.
Because even though your scripts like

180
00:09:32,011 --> 00:09:34,230
Casablanca mine of a surface level
story,

181
00:09:34,231 --> 00:09:37,680
that's as Corny as they come.
If the writing is good and if the

182
00:09:37,681 --> 00:09:41,310
emotions are real and if the scenes
aren't what they seem to be about,

183
00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:44,040
you might just have something special in
your hands

184
00:09:45,540 --> 00:09:46,780
looking at you kid.

185
00:09:55,210 --> 00:09:56,890
All right guys,
thanks for watching.

186
00:09:56,891 --> 00:10:00,400
So obviously this video is quite
different from what we usually do and

187
00:10:00,401 --> 00:10:03,460
it's something that I've been wanting to
make since we first started the channel.

188
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:07,060
I just felt like it didn't really have
the editing capabilities to pull off

189
00:10:07,090 --> 00:10:08,950
just yet,
so it tells if you'd like.

190
00:10:08,951 --> 00:10:12,400
These types of our practical slash
informative video is in between her

191
00:10:12,430 --> 00:10:14,920
regular analysis and we'll be sure to
make more of them.

192
00:10:15,340 --> 00:10:18,280
Also if you like what we do and one more
check at our patrion page where we

193
00:10:18,281 --> 00:10:22,990
produce additional content and followers
on social media and all that good stuff.

194
00:10:23,110 --> 00:10:24,940
Also,
one more thing if my voice sounds a

195
00:10:24,941 --> 00:10:28,210
little off in this one towards the end
it's because I got a little sick during

196
00:10:28,211 --> 00:10:31,300
the production of this video,
have recently moved halfway across the

197
00:10:31,301 --> 00:10:33,220
globe,
so that probably has something to do

198
00:10:33,221 --> 00:10:34,330
with it.
Anyways,

199
00:10:34,331 --> 00:10:36,790
I think that wraps things up.
Thanks again for watching and see you

200
00:10:36,791 --> 00:10:37,450
all the next one.
