Really relating to these archetypes in
the master.

5
00:00:20,860 --> 00:00:25,860
You don't have energy,
you will not have a sense of

6
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:32,420
if they have
that stuff out in ways that are

7
00:00:33,631 --> 00:00:35,220
destructive coming from you and others.

8
00:00:36,570 --> 00:00:40,260
What is masculinity?
Is it an outdated and overall

9
00:00:40,261 --> 00:00:45,261
destructive construct or is it a
necessary aspect of our humanity and the

10
00:00:45,301 --> 00:00:48,840
maturation of the individual?
These are some of the questions that

11
00:00:48,841 --> 00:00:52,980
pervade the work of Michael Mann in
general and his film collateral in

12
00:00:52,981 --> 00:00:57,480
particular because even though it's
story of a gabby being forced to drive a

13
00:00:57,481 --> 00:01:01,650
contract at killer from hit to hit
during one night in la might seem

14
00:01:01,651 --> 00:01:03,210
shallow.
On the surface level,

15
00:01:03,390 --> 00:01:07,230
I believe it's symbolic and thematic
structure provides a meaningful

16
00:01:07,231 --> 00:01:11,310
meditation on what it means to adopt
they healthy masculinity and what

17
00:01:11,311 --> 00:01:14,950
happens when we attempt to repress it
within ourselves and our societies.

18
00:01:18,810 --> 00:01:21,910
In one of his early seminars,
Dr [inaudible] discussed the

19
00:01:21,911 --> 00:01:26,490
mythological symbol of the men or the
rider and the bull and the necessity of

20
00:01:26,491 --> 00:01:30,240
taming once interval,
once masculine and animal nature.

21
00:01:30,990 --> 00:01:35,130
It is still the old hero cold of the man
who was capable of teaming his own bull

22
00:01:35,131 --> 00:01:38,070
like fashions,
the man who can overcome himself as

23
00:01:38,071 --> 00:01:43,071
almost a god and soda man who a has
deemed himself he's overcome his fears.

24
00:01:44,490 --> 00:01:46,590
Thus,
the catching of the ball in the net is

25
00:01:46,591 --> 00:01:49,410
an age old symbol for the self education
of men.

26
00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:53,610
When we're first introduced to Max,
we initially get a sentence that this is

27
00:01:53,611 --> 00:01:56,520
a man who's got his life together.
He used to Gabby,

28
00:01:56,521 --> 00:01:59,700
who goes above and beyond to keep things
orderly and clean.

29
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:04,380
He used to driver who knows his roots by
heart and ain't for maximum efficiency

30
00:02:04,540 --> 00:02:09,270
and take the 105 to 1:10 this fast,
but he's also a people's person

31
00:02:09,390 --> 00:02:12,780
perceptive in his ability to put himself
in his passenger shoes,

32
00:02:13,170 --> 00:02:18,030
compassionate to their struggles,
to take the ticket because you needed a

33
00:02:18,031 --> 00:02:21,420
lot more than I do.
Next is a man who excels at what he

34
00:02:21,421 --> 00:02:22,710
does,
who blends them,

35
00:02:22,711 --> 00:02:26,940
doing so much more limo company.
I'm putting together island limos and

36
00:02:26,941 --> 00:02:30,900
who even gets the number of the girl he
likes without even having to ask for it.

37
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:36,560
Max Truly seems to have it all.
It's not until after a mysterious man

38
00:02:37,261 --> 00:02:40,650
from out of town and enters a scab that
the facade begins to crumble.

39
00:02:41,130 --> 00:02:42,360
Denver,
Oh,

40
00:02:42,370 --> 00:02:45,290
you been driving 12 years.
Really

41
00:02:45,420 --> 00:02:48,330
suddenly,
Max is excellence and orderliness as a

42
00:02:48,331 --> 00:02:52,770
cab driver are exposed to be barred if
it's a weakness for in reality,

43
00:02:52,771 --> 00:02:57,480
Max is all order.
No risk it chronic clunker of life like

44
00:02:57,481 --> 00:03:02,140
a faceless writer or missing action.
He's become complacent,

45
00:03:02,170 --> 00:03:04,720
stuck in a routine,
afraid of getting dirty,

46
00:03:05,140 --> 00:03:08,530
of taking a chance.
If the girl he likes of delving into the

47
00:03:08,531 --> 00:03:12,100
unknown of facing his inner bull,
why don't you just take the cat?

48
00:03:12,970 --> 00:03:15,840
Is Realistic.
Ambitions have turned into an escapist

49
00:03:15,850 --> 00:03:20,500
dream meant to deceive himself as well
as others from facing his reality.

50
00:03:20,650 --> 00:03:23,860
He grabs famous people around limousine
companies,

51
00:03:23,861 --> 00:03:27,880
and that's what an achievement for.
It's when we repress our inner

52
00:03:27,881 --> 00:03:30,940
masculinity,
when we don't listen to our instincts,

53
00:03:31,150 --> 00:03:33,850
forfeit our assertiveness,
our healthy aggression,

54
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:38,860
you tell them to take next cab,
and when we don't take responsibility

55
00:03:38,861 --> 00:03:41,470
for our lives,
that life itself becomes rigid,

56
00:03:41,620 --> 00:03:43,390
constricting,
claustrophobic,

57
00:03:43,391 --> 00:03:46,300
even the car becomes not a symbol of
freedom,

58
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:50,380
but one of bondage in a world seemingly
indifferent to our existence

59
00:03:52,930 --> 00:03:55,690
like Max,
we might dream or deceive ourselves and

60
00:03:55,691 --> 00:03:57,880
others into believing that nothing is
wrong,

61
00:03:58,060 --> 00:04:00,430
but in reality when we repress our inner
bull,

62
00:04:00,431 --> 00:04:03,610
we've become small,
the pendant harmless and therefore

63
00:04:03,611 --> 00:04:04,444
vulnerable.

64
00:04:04,510 --> 00:04:09,070
Not much more than cogs in a machine
marionettes stuck in an endless loop

65
00:04:09,190 --> 00:04:11,890
naively waiting for the universe to give
us our do.

66
00:04:12,620 --> 00:04:14,630
Someday,
someday my dream will come

67
00:04:16,220 --> 00:04:18,260
when you wake up and you'll discover it
never happened.

68
00:04:18,990 --> 00:04:22,860
You can avoid places where bools are to
be found and if you don't see them,

69
00:04:22,861 --> 00:04:26,190
you will not be bothered,
but you must be dodging all the time in

70
00:04:26,191 --> 00:04:28,610
order to avoid every possibility of a
rousing.

71
00:04:29,340 --> 00:04:32,550
And since life provides endless
opportunities for the emotions,

72
00:04:32,551 --> 00:04:37,170
there is no end of dodging which amounts
to a panic or a chronic flunking of

73
00:04:37,171 --> 00:04:40,650
life.
Vincent is in all aspects the opposite

74
00:04:40,651 --> 00:04:42,030
of Max,
his shadow.

75
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:46,500
He seems to fully identify with the
masculinity of the symbolic bull.

76
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:50,190
Everything Max is not.
He shows himself to be assertive,

77
00:04:50,220 --> 00:04:51,570
alert,
and most of all,

78
00:04:51,571 --> 00:04:56,571
aggressive and unpredictable.
If Max is constricted by too much order

79
00:04:59,701 --> 00:05:02,730
and routine.
Vincent relishes in chaos and

80
00:05:02,731 --> 00:05:03,780
improvisation

81
00:05:03,950 --> 00:05:06,930
tough now behind the notes,
not what's expected.

82
00:05:07,660 --> 00:05:08,493
Compromise.

83
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:13,510
And yet vincent is not the perfect
manifestation of the writer who is

84
00:05:13,511 --> 00:05:17,580
deemed the passions of the bull.
He believes that compassion and emotion

85
00:05:17,581 --> 00:05:20,280
of Max to be a hypocritical weakness of
character,

86
00:05:20,310 --> 00:05:24,390
tens of thousands kill before sundown.
Nobody's killed people that fastens,

87
00:05:24,391 --> 00:05:26,970
Nagasaki and Hiroshima.
Did you bat an Imax?

88
00:05:27,090 --> 00:05:31,590
Do Vincent who grew up in an abusive
household life has no inherent meaning

89
00:05:31,591 --> 00:05:34,350
or value.
And the people who claim the opposite

90
00:05:34,351 --> 00:05:35,490
are lying to themselves.

91
00:05:35,530 --> 00:05:37,780
Six hours.
He's riding the subway before anybody

92
00:05:37,781 --> 00:05:41,730
notices his corpse doing laps around La
people on an opposite next to him.

93
00:05:43,390 --> 00:05:44,350
Nobody notices.

94
00:05:44,730 --> 00:05:48,380
I didn't notice the way he shot.
He shot as a part of the landscape.

95
00:05:48,590 --> 00:05:52,010
All that kind of stuff was to kind of
make him feel like an animal in la,

96
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:55,730
that he is a product of this great urban
sprawl that we live in,

97
00:05:55,731 --> 00:05:56,564
kind of a thing.

98
00:05:57,140 --> 00:05:58,370
Vincent is a product

99
00:05:58,370 --> 00:06:03,370
of modern urban society,
an extreme rationalist nihilist his gray

100
00:06:03,651 --> 00:06:06,530
and colorless attire,
revealing his inner hollowness

101
00:06:06,980 --> 00:06:10,280
ultimately act only to prove as
resentful belief that the world is

102
00:06:10,281 --> 00:06:11,570
disconnected,
cruel,

103
00:06:11,571 --> 00:06:15,140
and indifferent to existence or bringing
death and misery jewelers.

104
00:06:15,620 --> 00:06:19,550
Vincent has become possessed by what
Robert Moore termed the archetypical

105
00:06:19,590 --> 00:06:23,090
shadow warrior,
the destructive side of masculinity.

106
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:26,450
He's become detached from emotion and
human relationships.

107
00:06:26,630 --> 00:06:31,310
He's disgusted by human pettiness and
weakness and lifts only for his mission

108
00:06:31,790 --> 00:06:33,780
to him,
the emotional bastions of the bull

109
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:36,410
orbits,
silly constructs of society or the human

110
00:06:36,411 --> 00:06:41,060
imagination ultimately holding one back
from taking unrestrained action to

111
00:06:41,061 --> 00:06:42,320
achieve one's goals.

112
00:06:44,410 --> 00:06:47,780
He takes what he needs from it.
Symbolic animal for his own egoistic

113
00:06:47,781 --> 00:06:51,780
needs and things he can leave to carcass
behind Giran now,

114
00:06:51,790 --> 00:06:55,640
double should not be killed.
It is not a bull sacrifice because we

115
00:06:55,641 --> 00:06:59,240
have learned what that means.
It means that you are deprived of life,

116
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:03,290
drained if the very juice of life,
if you kill the emotional powers in

117
00:07:03,291 --> 00:07:05,690
yourself,
you get absolutely petrifying,

118
00:07:05,750 --> 00:07:09,770
dried up that therefore you must try to
keep that ball live under certain

119
00:07:09,771 --> 00:07:12,710
conditions symbolized by the net and the
tight feed.

120
00:07:12,980 --> 00:07:16,720
The ball must live,
and so as these two opposites embarked

121
00:07:16,721 --> 00:07:20,720
together on their murderous night,
an interplay of personalities and sue's

122
00:07:20,990 --> 00:07:25,760
visually Max's self-contained window
into the world is cracked and his life

123
00:07:25,761 --> 00:07:29,120
is thrown into chaos.
After you realize the true identity of

124
00:07:29,121 --> 00:07:33,320
his diabolical passenger,
as he drives Vincent from hit to hit,

125
00:07:33,321 --> 00:07:37,490
his own insufficiency becomes clear as
the veil of his lying is slowly being

126
00:07:37,491 --> 00:07:38,140
lifted.

127
00:07:38,140 --> 00:07:41,060
I'm not up for this and as much as you'd
love to escape,

128
00:07:41,061 --> 00:07:44,630
his reality is dependence on others will
only bring him in the world.

129
00:07:44,631 --> 00:07:46,340
More pain.
You attract attention.

130
00:07:46,341 --> 00:07:48,350
You're going to get people killed.
He didn't need to be.

131
00:07:48,740 --> 00:07:52,940
He stuck into cab in the enclosed arena
with his bull beside him.

132
00:07:53,660 --> 00:07:57,800
The only way out is to move forward into
the unknown and it's in spending time

133
00:07:57,801 --> 00:07:59,960
with him that he slowly becomes more
comfortable,

134
00:08:00,140 --> 00:08:03,020
more level headed,
and begins to learn from Vincent's

135
00:08:03,021 --> 00:08:06,890
behavior slowly becoming more assertive.
I'm going to have to stick this yellow

136
00:08:06,891 --> 00:08:11,891
cab of your fat ass and improvisational
to realization dawns on Max that the

137
00:08:14,301 --> 00:08:18,650
only way to survive the night and to
beat Vincent is to be like Vincent.

138
00:08:19,100 --> 00:08:23,130
The only way to team to dangerous bull
is to consciously act like the bull.

139
00:08:23,450 --> 00:08:27,020
One of the aspects of that becoming a
man is becoming dangerous if you're not

140
00:08:27,021 --> 00:08:32,021
dangerous.
Power masking the maturation has to do

141
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:38,500
with being empowered and knowing how to
use it and when not to use.

142
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:42,780
Tell the guy behind me to put his gun
away before I take it into Peter's

143
00:08:42,790 --> 00:08:45,990
bitter as definitely an embodying.
His inner vincent.

144
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:49,920
Max has discovered a new found power he
previously didn't know he had,

145
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:54,780
but by acting like the board of warrior,
there's always the danger of becoming or

146
00:08:54,781 --> 00:08:56,340
being as its opposite

147
00:08:57,160 --> 00:09:00,720
Vincent Vincent.
So what I'm hearing seemingly blurring

148
00:09:00,721 --> 00:09:03,600
the line between the warrior and it's
shadow counterpart,

149
00:09:03,630 --> 00:09:06,990
confusing to police on who the real
hitman is supposed to be.

150
00:09:07,700 --> 00:09:09,930
It is only through to murder of
detective fenning.

151
00:09:09,931 --> 00:09:12,840
That then since true ethological nature
is exposed,

152
00:09:12,900 --> 00:09:14,880
there's no reason,
good reason,

153
00:09:14,881 --> 00:09:17,760
there's no bad reason they've ordered
that a cop.

154
00:09:17,761 --> 00:09:20,770
You may
notice this

155
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:26,130
in complete shock of incense.
Nihilistic worldview Max makes a final

156
00:09:26,131 --> 00:09:30,420
move towards the completion of his inner
journey by taking full responsibility

157
00:09:30,421 --> 00:09:31,254
for his life

158
00:09:31,700 --> 00:09:35,880
straight up and looked at it.
Sure.

159
00:09:36,860 --> 00:09:40,640
His own hesitance to act,
his passive defendants have caused them

160
00:09:40,641 --> 00:09:44,960
to stagnate in life,
is weakness in lines if not only held

161
00:09:44,961 --> 00:09:47,510
himself back,
but have also contributed to the

162
00:09:47,511 --> 00:09:52,511
suffering of others is fail of the seed
has now been lifted completely and can

163
00:09:52,581 --> 00:09:55,260
therefore exists.
No longer you don't want that's

164
00:09:57,010 --> 00:10:02,010
fucked yourself.
Is deliberate.

165
00:10:02,871 --> 00:10:06,320
Crashing of this gap then becomes an
image of a symbolic death and

166
00:10:06,321 --> 00:10:11,321
resurrection is shedding of weakness.
The marionette dies and a writer arises.

167
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:15,860
The bull has been teamed and the shadow
warrior has failed in his attempt to

168
00:10:15,861 --> 00:10:19,100
convert him into his ranks.
And the sleeves is sign,

169
00:10:19,460 --> 00:10:22,820
but there's one more step needed for Max
to complete his inner journey,

170
00:10:23,250 --> 00:10:28,250
the capacity to be a long time on
whether or not you can care enough or

171
00:10:29,421 --> 00:10:34,421
something that is totally unrelated to
your personal interests that you can see

172
00:10:37,340 --> 00:10:38,173
the trend,

173
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:43,760
egoic,
Max strength sentences own being by

174
00:10:44,371 --> 00:10:49,350
sacrificing his own safety in order to
save the woman he cares about who also

175
00:10:49,351 --> 00:10:53,490
comes to represent the society as a
whole in her role as assistant attorney.

176
00:10:54,030 --> 00:10:58,140
And so by taking responsibility,
by embodying the archetype of the

177
00:10:58,141 --> 00:11:00,870
warrior,
Max is not only fighting for another

178
00:11:00,871 --> 00:11:03,780
individual,
but for the good of society as a whole.

179
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:08,220
He surprises to shadow warrior and this
new found ability to take decisive

180
00:11:08,221 --> 00:11:09,020
action.
Why?

181
00:11:09,020 --> 00:11:14,020
What are you going to do about it?
But he also exposes the weakness and

182
00:11:14,071 --> 00:11:17,400
Vincent's character.
Max ultimately does not win the final

183
00:11:17,401 --> 00:11:20,910
clash because of his competence with
firearms or through his aggression,

184
00:11:21,250 --> 00:11:25,500
but by improvising on the spot.
Whereas Vincent sticks to is rigid and

185
00:11:25,501 --> 00:11:30,501
pathological nature to sternum.
When the head is inability to

186
00:11:30,841 --> 00:11:34,320
emotionally connect with others,
and the one person who made himself

187
00:11:34,321 --> 00:11:37,770
conscious of is flawed nature ultimately
become his downfall.

188
00:11:38,310 --> 00:11:42,840
He stoically accepts death almost as
part of his job and yet in his final

189
00:11:42,841 --> 00:11:44,010
words,
we hear it a boy,

190
00:11:44,011 --> 00:11:46,500
so he broken men,
a forgotten child.

191
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:50,490
It's on the MTA.
Hearing guys

192
00:11:55,270 --> 00:11:59,860
for Max life begins again.
The repressed passive men who started

193
00:11:59,861 --> 00:12:04,420
the night is no more in display stands a
writer with a ball in this net.

194
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:07,780
He is not killed it for he knows it to
be impossible,

195
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:09,430
naive,
immoral,

196
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,790
and so yes,
tamed his masculinity without becoming

197
00:12:12,791 --> 00:12:15,520
possessed by,
by embodying his inner pool,

198
00:12:15,521 --> 00:12:19,000
not for chaos and destruction,
but for the good of himself and those

199
00:12:19,001 --> 00:12:22,120
around him.
He opens the door to a meaningful life,

200
00:12:22,510 --> 00:12:25,450
to an existence with purpose to a new
beginning

201
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:34,270
is the cause.
We have such a little experience of the

202
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:39,280
positive side of this and where your mum
that we become so cynical and sometimes

203
00:12:39,801 --> 00:12:44,750
even I listed about masculinity and
begin to equate masculinity was

204
00:12:44,780 --> 00:12:48,440
patriarchy,
which is very common and intellectual

205
00:12:48,441 --> 00:12:53,441
rounds today in my view.
The two are not to be equated at all at

206
00:12:53,661 --> 00:12:54,494
all.

207
00:12:56,350 --> 00:13:00,460
