00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:02,430
Thank you to dollar Shave Club for
sponsoring this video.

2
00:00:02,490 --> 00:00:07,490
Okay,
let's go five minutes,

3
00:00:08,301 --> 00:00:09,520
sir.
Let's make some sandwiches.

4
00:00:30,230 --> 00:00:32,010
I think it's done.
Let's see,

5
00:00:44,740 --> 00:00:45,573
maybe two hours

6
00:00:48,210 --> 00:00:51,600
cooking and cooked food or almost as
ubiquitous in our films,

7
00:00:51,601 --> 00:00:55,650
Sdr aspects of our daily lives,
but whether you see cooked food as

8
00:00:55,651 --> 00:00:59,070
nothing more than fuel to keep your body
from buying give it does me.

9
00:00:59,250 --> 00:00:59,641
No,
no,

10
00:00:59,641 --> 00:01:00,330
no,
no,

11
00:01:00,330 --> 00:01:02,310
no.
Get that out right now.

12
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:06,450
Or as a piece of art that almost doesn't
deserve to be eaten.

13
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:09,090
Oh my God.
People eat because they're hungry.

14
00:01:09,300 --> 00:01:12,690
I want to make food and makes people
stop eating for eight good filmmaker or

15
00:01:12,691 --> 00:01:15,240
writer.
The Cuc Ennis food are always more than

16
00:01:15,241 --> 00:01:19,650
just a nutter prop in a scene or a cheap
way to cover up a lifeless story with

17
00:01:19,651 --> 00:01:21,840
some pleasant ICANDY.
That's a chef's knife.

18
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:25,260
Look to hire

19
00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:30,620
the role of the chef as the passionate
mediator of raw nature to high culture

20
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:34,370
has served as an APP allegory for the
process and frustrations of the

21
00:01:34,371 --> 00:01:39,371
Hollywood filmmaker bay.
Like the filmmaker to chef is often

22
00:01:39,471 --> 00:01:43,850
depicted as a visionary artist of sorts
who's creativity has been shackled by

23
00:01:43,851 --> 00:01:46,850
his superiors and now suddenly you're
going to be an audience will be an

24
00:01:46,851 --> 00:01:50,740
artist on your own time or who believes
his workers under appreciated?

25
00:01:50,770 --> 00:01:52,520
No,
she's the Philistines.

26
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:56,960
I'm going live on a dog to add or overly
critiqued by those who don't have

27
00:01:56,961 --> 00:02:01,961
anything to add themselves for the chef
to overcharge us for his insecurity and

28
00:02:02,451 --> 00:02:05,930
lack of imagination,
but beyond sly allegories the ubiquity

29
00:02:05,931 --> 00:02:09,860
of Kooks and hot dishes and cinema can
also reveal something meaningful about

30
00:02:09,861 --> 00:02:14,390
our humanity and his boot catching fire.
How cooking made us human primatologist

31
00:02:14,391 --> 00:02:17,830
Richard Wrangham made to controversial
but thought provoking claim that this is

32
00:02:17,831 --> 00:02:21,800
the act of cooking that is the primary
distinguishing feature of humanity.

33
00:02:22,070 --> 00:02:25,280
And it has played an enormous part in
our evolution as a species.

34
00:02:25,490 --> 00:02:28,910
Fucking unbelievable.
We are tied to our adaptive diet of

35
00:02:28,911 --> 00:02:31,940
cooked food.
And the results pervade our lives from

36
00:02:31,941 --> 00:02:35,680
our bodies to our minds.
We humans are at a cooking apes your

37
00:02:35,681 --> 00:02:38,770
creatures of the flame,
and so we should indeed been our

38
00:02:38,771 --> 00:02:39,950
humanity on Kooks.

39
00:02:43,210 --> 00:02:45,910
In Ratatouille,
we can see this notion of cooking as a

40
00:02:45,911 --> 00:02:49,750
civilizing process play out in a
transformation of remy to country rat

41
00:02:49,980 --> 00:02:53,200
and to a five star chef in the culinary
capital of the world.

42
00:02:53,620 --> 00:02:57,370
Contrary to his fellow rats,
remy chooses to walk on two feet,

43
00:02:57,670 --> 00:03:00,040
cares about hygiene,
self control,

44
00:03:01,780 --> 00:03:06,780
just fork it down and learns how to read
all because of his passion for cooking.

45
00:03:08,730 --> 00:03:10,880
It's only one way to weed a brace of
Kone,

46
00:03:12,340 --> 00:03:16,780
but if cooked food can be seen as being
universally connected to civility films

47
00:03:16,781 --> 00:03:19,180
can also use this to show us its
opposite.

48
00:03:23,110 --> 00:03:24,470
What did you say?
Sorry.

49
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:29,020
Get
an old boyd.

50
00:03:29,021 --> 00:03:33,060
The main character of the story,
he eats a life on cooked octopus both in

51
00:03:33,061 --> 00:03:37,450
a desire to touch something living,
but also to reveal as d humanize state.

52
00:03:37,451 --> 00:03:42,451
After 15 years of isolated imprisonment,
he'll fight back on that menu bar,

53
00:03:44,710 --> 00:03:48,390
but consuming raw food can also serve
more practical purposes.

54
00:03:49,140 --> 00:03:53,310
The raw can come to be synonymous with
gaining natural strength and adapting

55
00:03:53,311 --> 00:03:55,530
oneself.
Do an uncivilized environment.

56
00:03:56,820 --> 00:04:01,170
Similarly to rules and expectations of a
warm meal can be broken to acquaint to

57
00:04:01,171 --> 00:04:04,320
civilized with the realities of an
uncivilized world.

58
00:04:10,580 --> 00:04:13,690
It's like a piece of chalk called bring
it all back,

59
00:04:14,070 --> 00:04:18,840
but this desire for the natural and the
Ra can also showcase once in capability

60
00:04:18,841 --> 00:04:22,290
of building and maintaining civilized
human relationships.

61
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:29,880
Food can also be used to indicate it
perceived level of Savitri on a societal

62
00:04:29,881 --> 00:04:32,670
level,
be it in our own community or in those

63
00:04:32,671 --> 00:04:37,380
of others depicting morally despicable
or highly unconventional foods as

64
00:04:37,381 --> 00:04:41,490
markers of uncivility setting more
culture protagonists apart from the

65
00:04:41,491 --> 00:04:43,920
exotic and wild world which they
inhabit,

66
00:04:46,170 --> 00:04:49,770
and that when taken to its extreme,
can degenerate into perhaps the ultimate

67
00:04:49,771 --> 00:04:52,470
symbol for Savitri.
Right.

68
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:56,280
We're going to fucking eat your ass.
This in turn can be used as a tool to

69
00:04:56,281 --> 00:05:01,281
completely break a character
or it can serve as a menacing and highly

70
00:05:02,971 --> 00:05:05,640
disturbing form of antagonism and in
humanity.

71
00:05:10,610 --> 00:05:11,443
Yeah.
Nope.

72
00:05:13,490 --> 00:05:14,323
Okay.
Okay.

73
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:19,020
Okay.
Steven Manel argue set another essential

74
00:05:19,021 --> 00:05:22,350
element of civilized food consumption is
a regulated appetite.

75
00:05:22,590 --> 00:05:25,080
The civilized don't merely eat out of
the immediate hunger,

76
00:05:25,980 --> 00:05:28,530
but collectively decide when to do so.
Together.

77
00:05:30,420 --> 00:05:34,760
I love you darling girl.
And so it dinner can be to see enough

78
00:05:34,770 --> 00:05:38,010
civilized harmony,
but it can also be used to invert this

79
00:05:38,011 --> 00:05:40,140
harmony,
revealing tensions between polar

80
00:05:40,141 --> 00:05:44,040
opposite characters and even devolving
into gluttony and depravity.

81
00:05:44,310 --> 00:05:48,090
Often mockingly depicting in our
problems of characters and society's

82
00:05:48,091 --> 00:05:53,091
alike.
And if over abundance and wastefulness

83
00:05:55,111 --> 00:05:58,220
of food are connected to uncivility.
So with scarcity,

84
00:05:58,580 --> 00:05:59,810
you're going to die for some chickens.

85
00:06:03,020 --> 00:06:06,080
Just like in real life,
a lack of food can be utilized to bring

86
00:06:06,081 --> 00:06:08,360
about the deepest forms of humanity in
people.

87
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:11,150
And at times the very darkest aspects
will be characters,

88
00:06:11,151 --> 00:06:16,151
personality,
cooked food can be a battle ground for

89
00:06:16,611 --> 00:06:21,611
perceived moral superiority and higher
social status and will be serving those

90
00:06:22,461 --> 00:06:24,260
who own the food,
have the most of it,

91
00:06:24,261 --> 00:06:26,810
or have the final say in how it should
be prepared,

92
00:06:26,990 --> 00:06:30,610
hold a sense of power over others.
And so did we.

93
00:06:30,611 --> 00:06:34,430
Zenes of entire countries can come to be
the objects of a bitter and at times

94
00:06:34,431 --> 00:06:37,010
hilarious rivalry.
Similarly,

95
00:06:37,011 --> 00:06:39,810
an over abundant fees can shoot agreed
and hypocrisy.

96
00:06:39,811 --> 00:06:41,750
UV,
tyrannical government and the

97
00:06:41,751 --> 00:06:45,560
meticulously crafted dessert can be used
to reveal the roofless and unpredictable

98
00:06:45,561 --> 00:06:48,890
nature of a character who likes to hide
behind a gentle masco.

99
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:51,770
Be civilized friend.
Send the deposit

100
00:06:52,070 --> 00:06:56,270
doctor
I said are totally booked to it.

101
00:06:56,271 --> 00:06:57,260
Nine.
Perfect.

102
00:06:57,530 --> 00:06:58,363
See you then.

103
00:06:58,770 --> 00:07:03,150
Food is a status symbol we can use to
impress others with and you Seville our

104
00:07:03,151 --> 00:07:04,440
own real personality.

105
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:07,070
Well,
you have to promote general social

106
00:07:07,090 --> 00:07:07,923
concern.

107
00:07:08,540 --> 00:07:11,810
It's a symbol through which we can gauge
the matter of control a character has

108
00:07:11,811 --> 00:07:15,440
over his life and it means through which
to maintain an artificial sense of

109
00:07:15,441 --> 00:07:20,270
civility juxtaposed against a contrast.
In reality you'll be character or of the

110
00:07:20,271 --> 00:07:21,230
outside world.

111
00:07:21,550 --> 00:07:26,550
Yeah,
we made it dude,

112
00:07:31,410 --> 00:07:33,300
but just as cooked food can height
faults,

113
00:07:33,301 --> 00:07:37,080
any person or society.
It can also serve as a symbol of freedom

114
00:07:37,081 --> 00:07:40,110
and hope.
I think it's going daddy cooking and

115
00:07:40,111 --> 00:07:42,690
cooked food as civilized.
There's can be used to bring people

116
00:07:42,691 --> 00:07:44,820
together.
I know the thing about good food.

117
00:07:45,690 --> 00:07:48,390
It brings folks together from all walks
of life.

118
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:51,330
We had our people with wildly varying
personalities,

119
00:07:51,331 --> 00:07:54,870
sculpture or even those in an active
state of war II,

120
00:07:54,871 --> 00:07:58,140
belly well filled functions as one of
the prime factors in creating a

121
00:07:58,141 --> 00:08:03,141
civilized environment.
It is perhaps no wonder then that we've

122
00:08:03,151 --> 00:08:04,980
chosen.
The dinner table is one of the prime

123
00:08:04,981 --> 00:08:08,100
places from where intimate relationships
can grow and bloom.

124
00:08:08,460 --> 00:08:09,293
Now you'll know

125
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:13,040
do we eat?
The good food is to be close to God,

126
00:08:14,010 --> 00:08:16,650
meticulously cooked food like an
exceptional book.

127
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:20,940
A painting or a great piece of cinema
can have a transformative effect on

128
00:08:20,941 --> 00:08:25,941
characters and people alike.
Bringing back memories this instantly

129
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:31,650
and brings you back to my time and
taking our breaths away in a moment of

130
00:08:31,651 --> 00:08:32,580
peaceful bliss.

131
00:08:42,980 --> 00:08:45,580
It's so fucking good.
I should kill you.

132
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:53,950
And Cinema as well as in the real world.
Cooking and cooked food reveal their

133
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:56,940
connectedness with argument.
He by making dose who engage in it,

134
00:08:56,941 --> 00:08:59,850
more human,
bringing us closer to ourselves and we

135
00:08:59,851 --> 00:09:04,851
can link old passions and relationships.
This uniquely human trait has gone hand

136
00:09:05,641 --> 00:09:09,300
in hand with the evolution of our
species from a wild group of primates

137
00:09:09,330 --> 00:09:13,710
and two cultured civilizations who owe a
great deal to the very first chefs of

138
00:09:13,711 --> 00:09:17,670
our race for filmmakers.
The interest and usage of cooking and

139
00:09:17,671 --> 00:09:22,500
food and film is and perhaps ought to be
not just limited to an allegory about

140
00:09:22,501 --> 00:09:25,530
the frustrations of art,
but it's about cooked food as one of the

141
00:09:25,531 --> 00:09:30,531
main civilizing drives of our species
because the food we eat in our daily

142
00:09:30,691 --> 00:09:35,490
lives and especially to food characters,
Cook and consume and movies is in a lot

143
00:09:35,491 --> 00:09:39,300
of ways universally connected to the
overarching topics of all story,

144
00:09:39,810 --> 00:09:42,450
who we are as people and what it means
to be human.

145
00:09:51,430 --> 00:09:52,263
Okay,

146
00:09:53,140 --> 00:09:56,650
thank you all for watching and now onto
a special reveal.

147
00:09:57,430 --> 00:09:59,920
Most of us have our daily grooming
routines.

148
00:10:00,010 --> 00:10:03,820
Unless you're like me and you don't buy
new razors because you hate going out to

149
00:10:03,821 --> 00:10:07,060
buy grooming products and you actually
start to believe that you could
