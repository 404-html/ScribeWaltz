1
00:00:10,010 --> 00:00:10,843
Yeah.

2
00:00:20,340 --> 00:00:25,140
As someone who was born two years after
the official collapse of the Soviet

3
00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:27,060
Union,
it is hard to imagine the constant

4
00:00:27,061 --> 00:00:32,061
possibility of global nuclear war and
the which the world lift for so long.

5
00:00:32,430 --> 00:00:35,200
Do I have to know what happens when an
atomic bomb explode?

6
00:00:35,980 --> 00:00:38,800
You all know when it come,
we hope it never comes,

7
00:00:38,801 --> 00:00:39,910
but they to get ready.

8
00:00:40,030 --> 00:00:45,030
There seems to be a substantial mount
off existential worry right now in 2017

9
00:00:46,151 --> 00:00:49,090
births.
I wonder if it can compare to the way in

10
00:00:49,091 --> 00:00:54,040
which the world must have been honing in
spreads in 90 62 when doing the Cuba

11
00:00:54,041 --> 00:00:57,550
crisis.
Nuclear War seems births a moments away.

12
00:00:58,020 --> 00:01:03,020
It arrogantly recommend that the United
States and the Soviet Union pump,

13
00:01:05,910 --> 00:01:10,910
we'll remove the existing threat to the
security of the western hemisphere and

14
00:01:11,431 --> 00:01:12,300
the peace of the world.

15
00:01:12,810 --> 00:01:17,670
Isn't it therefore strange that when
Stanley Kubrick's 90 64 movie doctor

16
00:01:17,671 --> 00:01:21,510
strange love opens with a nuclear bomb
of being refused,

17
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:26,540
it is this romantic song we are hearing.
It becomes clear that Kubrick has chosen

18
00:01:26,851 --> 00:01:30,210
to turn the biggest threat to the world
into satire.

19
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:35,600
Existential dread is a great source for
satirical comedy and doing the 60s to

20
00:01:36,151 --> 00:01:39,330
nuclear tensions were also satirized but
others,

21
00:01:39,630 --> 00:01:43,290
Tom Lehrer,
both Harvard educated mathematician and

22
00:01:43,291 --> 00:01:45,330
satirical songwriter roads.
This,

23
00:01:45,331 --> 00:01:46,230
for example,

24
00:01:46,290 --> 00:01:51,290
more of the bomb that drops on.
You get your friends and neighbor,

25
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:59,880
they'll be nobody left behind to debris
and we all go together when we

26
00:02:04,260 --> 00:02:09,260
come back to that is to know you never
sold bereavement and inspiring

27
00:02:11,371 --> 00:02:12,450
achievement.
Yes,

28
00:02:12,451 --> 00:02:15,330
we all will go together when we go.

29
00:02:16,150 --> 00:02:19,050
However,
I think no one's satirize the cult word

30
00:02:19,051 --> 00:02:22,330
better than Stelly Kubrick with doctor
strange love.

31
00:02:22,900 --> 00:02:27,900
It sends audiences books into laughter
and also serious worry about why anyone

32
00:02:28,601 --> 00:02:33,010
could even love about worlds possibly
ending in a nuclear holocaust.

33
00:02:33,550 --> 00:02:36,730
In this video,
I want to explore both the symbolism and

34
00:02:36,731 --> 00:02:41,500
set of the film birth connected also to
the politics of den and the politics of

35
00:02:41,501 --> 00:02:46,501
today by choosing this romantic song,
Kubrick tunes refueling the bombers in a

36
00:02:46,721 --> 00:02:49,990
sexual act.
Dr Strange Laugh is a movie dead

37
00:02:50,020 --> 00:02:55,020
ridicules the Cold War and nuclear arms
race by turning it into an allegory for

38
00:02:55,211 --> 00:02:59,040
sex.
Johnathan swift describes one of Kuric

39
00:02:59,050 --> 00:03:03,700
central teams in multiple of his movies
instead of the damned animal man.

40
00:03:03,970 --> 00:03:07,840
Kubrick's characters are inherently
sexual and aggressive,

41
00:03:07,900 --> 00:03:11,200
is weapons extensions of a sexual
organs.

42
00:03:11,710 --> 00:03:16,000
He escapable off creating sophisticated
and complicated systems,

43
00:03:16,001 --> 00:03:19,810
birth incapable of using them
responsibly and Morley.

44
00:03:24,870 --> 00:03:25,703
Yeah.

45
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:41,070
Dr. Strange Loft presents in the film,
two kinds of men,

46
00:03:41,130 --> 00:03:46,130
first of which is the military type.
These men cannot wait to drop a nuclear

47
00:03:46,201 --> 00:03:49,500
bomb or Russia,
the main characters that embody this.

48
00:03:49,501 --> 00:03:54,210
Our Channel Jack the ripper who sets the
whole plan to bomb Russia into motion

49
00:03:54,270 --> 00:03:58,230
and general buck to Richardson,
Two d military men.

50
00:03:58,260 --> 00:04:02,820
The Cold War is incredibly frustrating.
The movie ella crisis,

51
00:04:02,821 --> 00:04:07,140
this frustration from a lack of military
action into sexual frustration.

52
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:11,340
Jack the ripper refuels the reason for
ordering the nuclear bomb,

53
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:17,120
I can no longer sit back and allow
communist infiltration.

54
00:04:18,080 --> 00:04:19,520
Communist indoctrination.

55
00:04:20,540 --> 00:04:20,980
Yeah.

56
00:04:20,980 --> 00:04:22,270
Communist subversion.

57
00:04:23,740 --> 00:04:24,230
Yeah,

58
00:04:24,230 --> 00:04:26,630
and the international communist
conspiracy.

59
00:04:27,690 --> 00:04:28,070
Okay.

60
00:04:28,070 --> 00:04:33,070
The sapien and purify all of our
impressionists bodily fluids.

61
00:04:34,460 --> 00:04:34,950
Okay.

62
00:04:34,950 --> 00:04:39,120
And then later refuels he discovered
this infiltration when trying to have

63
00:04:39,121 --> 00:04:39,954
sex.

64
00:04:40,060 --> 00:04:44,570
Well.
I first became aware of it and then

65
00:04:44,580 --> 00:04:49,580
drink during the physical act of love
as a,

66
00:04:50,230 --> 00:04:51,930
yeah,
a profound sense of

67
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:55,350
feeling of emptiness motto.

68
00:04:56,130 --> 00:05:00,960
The Cold War has taken away a sexual
virility and the only solution he sees

69
00:05:00,990 --> 00:05:03,750
is dropping a load into modern Russia as
it were.

70
00:05:04,020 --> 00:05:06,880
The same goes for general bucks.
30 Hudson.

71
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:10,740
He leaves his rather bimbo which
girlfriend right before having sex with

72
00:05:10,741 --> 00:05:14,810
her to go through the ballroom.
He even says that his girl can already

73
00:05:14,820 --> 00:05:18,300
start the countdown,
clear referral to the countdown off

74
00:05:18,301 --> 00:05:19,830
launching nuclear strikes.

75
00:05:20,340 --> 00:05:23,760
You just start your comp down and old
bucky,

76
00:05:23,761 --> 00:05:27,300
we'll be back here,
but boy you can say stop.

77
00:05:28,350 --> 00:05:30,960
You stand.
Of course sexually frustrated and can't

78
00:05:30,961 --> 00:05:32,130
wait to bomb Russia

79
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:37,540
indicate that we would strive 90% of
their nuclear capabilities.

80
00:05:37,541 --> 00:05:42,541
We went there for prevail and suffer
only modest and acceptable civilian

81
00:05:42,641 --> 00:05:46,110
casualties from the remaining forest,
which would be badly damaged and I'm

82
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:46,953
uncoordinated

83
00:05:47,060 --> 00:05:49,040
when the precedent for futures to do
this.

84
00:05:49,041 --> 00:05:52,700
He starts chewing gum like a smoker,
chewing gum to not smoke.

85
00:05:52,701 --> 00:05:56,210
He is chewing gum to distract him from
his sexual frustration.

86
00:05:56,780 --> 00:06:01,700
Now movie is filled with Phallic symbols
such as the aforementioned refueling of

87
00:06:01,701 --> 00:06:05,420
the bombers,
the Cigar General Jack The ripper smokes

88
00:06:05,510 --> 00:06:09,130
the lung machine on the uses.
And at the end of the movie aircrewman

89
00:06:09,140 --> 00:06:13,250
the Kong who symbolizes the biggest
direction note to men when he quote

90
00:06:13,251 --> 00:06:15,860
unquote writes the bomb.
As Joan says,

91
00:06:15,861 --> 00:06:20,120
swift said these are extensions of the
mill sexual organs.

92
00:06:20,330 --> 00:06:24,320
The other kind of men in the film is the
one that doesn't want to drop the bomb.

93
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:29,440
He is a fiscally week sexually impotent
men plays by the same Ectera Dsr English

94
00:06:29,871 --> 00:06:33,760
captain Lionel Mandrake,
the precedent Merkin muffly and doctor

95
00:06:33,761 --> 00:06:37,580
strange love himself.
The English Captain Mandrake who tries

96
00:06:37,581 --> 00:06:42,110
to stop General Jack The ripper is
fiscally impaired and enabled to use the

97
00:06:42,111 --> 00:06:45,330
rather phallic machinegun referring to a
sexual impotence.

98
00:06:45,331 --> 00:06:46,164
Yeah,

99
00:06:47,110 --> 00:06:51,400
I uh,
I haven't had any much experience,

100
00:06:51,401 --> 00:06:54,190
you know,
with those machines.

101
00:06:54,390 --> 00:06:55,223
Yeah.
Got It.

102
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:58,210
Any of a professed a bathroom in my
sales pitch.

103
00:06:58,220 --> 00:07:01,030
Heinrich in the name of the magazine in
the continental congress come in and

104
00:07:01,031 --> 00:07:01,950
treatment.
That's a boy.

105
00:07:02,380 --> 00:07:05,630
Yeah.
I'd love to come back time.

106
00:07:06,070 --> 00:07:09,100
What's happened.
You'll see the string and my legs gone.

107
00:07:11,030 --> 00:07:12,360
One,
Craig,

108
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:16,300
I've never told you what you see.
Gammy leg.

109
00:07:16,810 --> 00:07:17,643
Yeah.

110
00:07:17,780 --> 00:07:22,780
The precedent who dismisses all of the
military passion is rather wimpy and

111
00:07:22,881 --> 00:07:25,610
weak looking when he calls the Russian
precedent.

112
00:07:25,611 --> 00:07:29,990
It sounds like an all sexist marriage
where the emasculated precedent tries,

113
00:07:29,991 --> 00:07:33,470
but Phil's to control his annoying
complaining wife.

114
00:07:33,670 --> 00:07:34,121
Well,
listen.

115
00:07:34,121 --> 00:07:38,590
How do you think I feel about it?
Can you imagine how I feel about it?

116
00:07:38,591 --> 00:07:43,591
Dimitri,
why do you think I'm calling you just to

117
00:07:43,601 --> 00:07:48,340
say hello?
Of course I like to speak to you.

118
00:07:48,910 --> 00:07:50,560
Of course.
I like to say hello.

119
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:53,170
Not now,
but anytime.

120
00:07:53,171 --> 00:07:55,150
Dimitri,
I'm just calling up to tell you

121
00:07:55,151 --> 00:07:59,140
something terrible has happened.
It's a friendly call.

122
00:07:59,141 --> 00:08:00,580
Of course,
it's a friendly call.

123
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:04,760
The last of the sexually impotent men is
doctor strange love,

124
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:09,330
also weak and physically impaired.
He is a scientist who used to work for

125
00:08:09,331 --> 00:08:13,020
the Nazis.
He represents the Nazi scientist that

126
00:08:13,021 --> 00:08:17,250
started working in the u s after World
War Two searches when from Brown,

127
00:08:17,251 --> 00:08:19,770
who was also satirized by Tom Lehrer

128
00:08:20,190 --> 00:08:24,160
gather round while I sing you a banner.
Fun Brown.

129
00:08:24,730 --> 00:08:29,730
A man who's that lead jams Isru the by
expedia bought him a Nazi.

130
00:08:30,900 --> 00:08:35,900
He won't even fry Nazi schmaltzy.
Sas Van are fine.

131
00:08:39,310 --> 00:08:42,120
Doctor Strange love symbolizes
paralyzed.

132
00:08:42,260 --> 00:08:46,570
It's not destroyed Nazi ideology.
When it becomes clear that the bomb will

133
00:08:46,571 --> 00:08:49,750
be dropped.
He suggests a Bronco with many women

134
00:08:49,751 --> 00:08:53,530
chosen for their sexual attributes to
repopulate the earth.

135
00:08:53,710 --> 00:08:57,360
A suggestion that the Mescaleros
precedent likes,

136
00:08:57,560 --> 00:09:02,560
you mentioned the ratio of 10 women to
each man.

137
00:09:03,380 --> 00:09:07,940
Wouldn't that necessitate the
abandonment of the so called a

138
00:09:07,970 --> 00:09:10,550
monogamous sexual relationship?
I mean,

139
00:09:10,790 --> 00:09:12,350
as far as men were concerned,

140
00:09:14,060 --> 00:09:15,740
yes,
it is.

141
00:09:15,741 --> 00:09:18,410
You know,
a sacrifice is required for the future

142
00:09:18,411 --> 00:09:23,030
of the human race.
I hasten to add that since each man the

143
00:09:23,050 --> 00:09:25,430
it will be required to do,
but to just

144
00:09:27,410 --> 00:09:32,060
service along these lines there women
will have to be selected for this sexual

145
00:09:32,450 --> 00:09:34,850
characteristics,
which you have to be of a highly

146
00:09:35,270 --> 00:09:36,590
stimulating nature.

147
00:09:37,300 --> 00:09:40,180
Well,
book is showing about preventing a

148
00:09:40,181 --> 00:09:42,850
nuclear missile gap after they leave the
bunkers.

149
00:09:42,851 --> 00:09:45,670
After the nuclear Holocaust,
Dr. Strange loss,

150
00:09:45,671 --> 00:09:50,671
paralyzed body is healed by this idea of
pure breeding inside the bunker while he

151
00:09:51,061 --> 00:09:51,910
shouts out,

152
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:54,873
right.

153
00:09:57,410 --> 00:09:59,900
Ending the movie with the nuclear
Holocaust.

154
00:09:59,930 --> 00:10:02,630
While we hear a song about two lovers
death,

155
00:10:02,631 --> 00:10:03,660
we will meet again.

156
00:10:07,340 --> 00:10:10,230
No,
no,

157
00:10:10,350 --> 00:10:14,270
no,
no.

158
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:19,280
We need again,
sunny today.

159
00:10:23,110 --> 00:10:28,110
When the film came out in 90 64 it's fit
in and satirize perfectly.

160
00:10:28,331 --> 00:10:31,720
The political situation of it's time.
On the one hand,

161
00:10:31,750 --> 00:10:35,950
it's ridicules Republicans search as
young Reagan and the presidential

162
00:10:35,951 --> 00:10:38,590
candidates.
Very cool toddler who is aggressive

163
00:10:38,591 --> 00:10:43,330
anticommunist pro nuclear expansion.
We're Toyak was criticized strongly by

164
00:10:43,331 --> 00:10:46,300
Democrats who saw him this dangerous
warmongering.

165
00:10:46,540 --> 00:10:51,430
See it sounds like it's a side job.
I'm big claim like a 52 jet exhaust,

166
00:10:51,450 --> 00:10:55,000
fry them tickets to the bar.
He got a chance

167
00:10:59,860 --> 00:11:01,360
in the week.
You miss escalators.

168
00:11:01,370 --> 00:11:05,330
Characters in doctor strange love.
We see the so called wimpy EC has

169
00:11:05,331 --> 00:11:09,490
Democrats search as Adelaide Stevenson.
He was called [inaudible] Bay.

170
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:14,500
Richard Nixon in 1952 the term refers to
intellectuals that are too out of touch

171
00:11:14,901 --> 00:11:16,880
with reality,
the common people,

172
00:11:16,910 --> 00:11:18,920
sexual interests,
et cetera.

173
00:11:19,070 --> 00:11:22,760
In today's politics.
I think it's no surprise why so many.

174
00:11:22,761 --> 00:11:27,710
We're worried about trump having access
to the nuclear codes with his sexual

175
00:11:27,711 --> 00:11:30,260
remarks and x from the guts,
aggressive,

176
00:11:30,261 --> 00:11:31,610
reactionary.
We're toric.

177
00:11:31,611 --> 00:11:34,070
We seen him clearly,
Kubrick stamps,

178
00:11:34,071 --> 00:11:35,790
animal men,
the passionate,

179
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:39,440
sexually aggressive military characters
in doctor strange love.

180
00:11:40,310 --> 00:11:44,750
That is why many solid him,
a serious threat to nuclear stability.

181
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:49,310
Even though trump supporters pointed out
that when looking at actual policy,

182
00:11:49,340 --> 00:11:54,340
Clinton Syrian policy would be much
worse for us relations and nuclear

183
00:11:54,911 --> 00:11:59,911
stability or so people thought.
It's very clear that Dr strange loves

184
00:12:00,421 --> 00:12:05,290
still holds up today in the movie,
the sexual tension was released sending

185
00:12:05,291 --> 00:12:09,280
the world into nuclear holocaust.
Luckily in reality,

186
00:12:09,281 --> 00:12:12,580
this never happens,
but the cold war and doesn't seem to

187
00:12:12,581 --> 00:12:15,040
have ended after the fall of the Soviet
Union.

188
00:12:15,041 --> 00:12:18,040
He bird has been simmering on below the
surface.

189
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:21,010
We hope it's willing to come to an
eruption birth.

190
00:12:21,011 --> 00:12:26,011
It's still good time to rewatch Dr.
Strange laugh to become aware again and

191
00:12:26,051 --> 00:12:30,640
also have a good laugh about the
possibility of nuclear annihilation.

192
00:12:31,290 --> 00:12:33,080
I wish we had one of them.
Don't stay machine

193
00:12:34,780 --> 00:12:39,280
because s Tom Lehrer sings,
at least we will all go together when we

194
00:12:39,281 --> 00:12:40,114
go

195
00:12:40,370 --> 00:12:45,370
and we were all go together when we go
boarding.

196
00:12:46,730 --> 00:12:51,730
Back to that is to know you never sold
bereavement and inspiring achievement.

197
00:12:53,510 --> 00:12:58,460
Yes.
We all will go together when we go all

198
00:12:58,461 --> 00:13:02,840
go together.
When we go all suffused with an

199
00:13:02,841 --> 00:13:07,841
incandescent glow,
no one will have the endurance to

200
00:13:07,941 --> 00:13:12,050
collect on his insurance.
Lloyd's of London will be loaded when

201
00:13:12,070 --> 00:13:15,950
they go
all fried together.

202
00:13:15,951 --> 00:13:20,810
When we Friday,
we'll be French fried potatoes by and

203
00:13:22,130 --> 00:13:25,310
there will be no more misery when the
world is.

204
00:13:25,311 --> 00:13:26,600
I wrote disagree.
Yes.

205
00:13:26,601 --> 00:13:30,020
We all will fry together when we fry.
