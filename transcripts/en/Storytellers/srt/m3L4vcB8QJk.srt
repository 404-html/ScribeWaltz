1
00:00:04,870 --> 00:00:07,840
No,
a couple of days after the remembrance

2
00:00:07,841 --> 00:00:11,320
of d day on the sixth of June,
1944.

3
00:00:11,321 --> 00:00:16,321
I think it is a good moment to reflect
upon how alive we'll talk to still is in

4
00:00:17,231 --> 00:00:22,231
our culture and in our hearts.
Although every year there are new films

5
00:00:22,301 --> 00:00:25,180
and TV stead deal with the Second World
War.

6
00:00:25,330 --> 00:00:30,330
The most defining of the last decades is
still by far saving private Ryan.

7
00:00:31,430 --> 00:00:36,430
The movie has taken an important role in
the public memory of words or to ask

8
00:00:36,741 --> 00:00:41,000
Mathias fiedler states now that the
generation that fought in the war is

9
00:00:41,001 --> 00:00:44,450
slowly leaving us.
Our post memory of the war becomes

10
00:00:44,451 --> 00:00:48,350
increasingly reliant on mediated images
of the past.

11
00:00:49,010 --> 00:00:53,500
Those were two movies hold a cultural
position where they actively engaged

12
00:00:53,501 --> 00:00:58,400
younger generations with the older
generation that experienced and fought

13
00:00:58,430 --> 00:01:00,760
in the war.
Ryan moonroof rq,

14
00:01:00,761 --> 00:01:01,760
Istats,
watching,

15
00:01:01,761 --> 00:01:06,390
saving private Ryan became a cultural
event where different generations

16
00:01:06,391 --> 00:01:11,391
sometimes saw the movie together and
then discuss some of the pain and trauma

17
00:01:11,421 --> 00:01:13,520
that came with remembrance.

18
00:01:14,210 --> 00:01:18,890
Marianna Hirsch has coined this practice
where younger generations engaged with

19
00:01:18,891 --> 00:01:23,350
traumatic memories of all the
generations to cultural artifacts as

20
00:01:23,380 --> 00:01:25,100
post memory.
Now,

21
00:01:25,101 --> 00:01:29,600
to make an argument about how Saving
Private Ryan Folks Post Memory,

22
00:01:29,601 --> 00:01:34,250
we have to look at how the movie creates
a connection between the audience and

23
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:38,960
the characters on screen since the
characters represent the soldiers that

24
00:01:38,961 --> 00:01:43,470
fought in world war two.
We can do this by exploring Marie Smith

25
00:01:43,471 --> 00:01:48,471
structure or sympathy moray device
audience identification with cinematic

26
00:01:48,831 --> 00:01:52,970
characters into central imagining and
essential imagining.

27
00:01:53,750 --> 00:01:58,700
Central imagining is when the audience
literally fuels while to characters on

28
00:01:58,701 --> 00:02:00,980
screen feel fear,
anger,

29
00:02:01,010 --> 00:02:04,790
happiness,
etc. This is what's buber primarily

30
00:02:04,791 --> 00:02:08,630
tries to achieve in the opening sequence
of saving private ryan

31
00:02:15,390 --> 00:02:20,390
using the handheld shaky cam that moves
and tax to the violence on the beach.

32
00:02:20,780 --> 00:02:25,530
Spielberg simulaTes the actual
experience of a soldier in the middle of

33
00:02:25,531 --> 00:02:29,610
it as the camera functions as the eyes
of the viewer,

34
00:02:29,940 --> 00:02:34,520
humorous made to feel as if he is in the
middle of the violence and trauma of

35
00:02:34,530 --> 00:02:37,710
war.
Closing the gap between the audience and

36
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:41,700
the characters on screen.
Spew book then in fights is food into

37
00:02:41,701 --> 00:02:45,690
the subjective experience of the
soldiers on screen by using sound

38
00:02:45,691 --> 00:02:48,780
effects that conveyed the shell shock of
the soldiers

39
00:02:55,150 --> 00:02:58,510
central imagining,
however asked me criticized since it is

40
00:02:58,511 --> 00:03:02,050
impossible,
achieve it completely in spite of all

41
00:03:02,051 --> 00:03:05,410
the cinematic techniques,
the audience contrary to the characters

42
00:03:05,411 --> 00:03:09,250
on screen and soldiers they represent
back in 1944,

43
00:03:09,340 --> 00:03:14,340
is still safely watching in a theater,
turning the violence and horror of war

44
00:03:14,820 --> 00:03:18,580
into spectacle.
Therefore,

45
00:03:18,670 --> 00:03:23,440
one straw to foa one stated that there
is no such thing as an antiwar movie.

46
00:03:23,740 --> 00:03:26,290
Stills,
spielberg takes a mighty shots at

47
00:03:26,350 --> 00:03:30,850
evoking an effective central imagining
and not completely successful,

48
00:03:30,851 --> 00:03:35,590
I would say since there were reports or
federal having ptsd attacks.

49
00:03:35,591 --> 00:03:39,370
Upon screening a movie,
it is clear that spielberg has in a way

50
00:03:39,371 --> 00:03:43,480
succeeded in having us audience
experienced the horrors of war.

51
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:48,840
Contrary to central imagining a or
imagining is where the fewer stones

52
00:03:49,151 --> 00:03:52,060
literally fueled the same things as the
characters.

53
00:03:52,061 --> 00:03:52,841
Birth.
Instead,

54
00:03:52,841 --> 00:03:57,841
sympathize with their experience.
Smith subdivides this into recognition,

55
00:03:58,270 --> 00:04:03,270
alignment and allegiance recognition
being simply recognizing characters as

56
00:04:04,541 --> 00:04:05,790
who they are,
men,

57
00:04:05,830 --> 00:04:07,480
women,
american soldiers,

58
00:04:07,481 --> 00:04:09,220
german soldiers,
etc.

59
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:14,520
Alignment is when the audience gets
access to the experience and thinking of

60
00:04:14,591 --> 00:04:17,980
the characters,
and allegiance is when the audience has

61
00:04:17,981 --> 00:04:22,300
evaluated the characters moral choices
and start rooting for them.

62
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:27,670
I would argue that safe and private
ryan's narrative structure is designed

63
00:04:27,671 --> 00:04:31,150
to have the audience build a strong
allegiance with the characters on

64
00:04:31,151 --> 00:04:33,520
screen.
After the opening sequence,

65
00:04:33,521 --> 00:04:36,610
the film narrows in on a small group of
soldiers.

66
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:39,730
Those costs were 12,
saving private ryan.

67
00:04:40,060 --> 00:04:43,060
Throughout the film,
we stay close to these men and their

68
00:04:43,061 --> 00:04:46,600
experiences creating a lot of time to
bond with them.

69
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:52,320
Saving private ryan is not unique in
this many war films focus on a small set

70
00:04:52,601 --> 00:04:57,390
of characters in the myths of huge
historical offense as stalin wants.

71
00:04:57,391 --> 00:04:59,740
Sets one.
Death is a tragedy.

72
00:05:00,010 --> 00:05:03,970
A million deaths is a statistic in
saving private ryan.

73
00:05:03,971 --> 00:05:07,390
The audience connects strongly with a
small group of soldiers.

74
00:05:07,390 --> 00:05:11,890
She has these characters represent the
american soldiers in world war two as a

75
00:05:11,891 --> 00:05:15,340
whole.
This is a much more effective way of

76
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:17,110
evoking posts memory,
dan,

77
00:05:17,111 --> 00:05:18,180
for example,
90,

78
00:05:18,210 --> 00:05:23,210
60 to the longest day where we see dna
from a lot more angles and with a lot

79
00:05:23,891 --> 00:05:27,250
more characters.
This gives some more complete oversight

80
00:05:27,251 --> 00:05:30,280
of dda,
yet it feels to establish a strong

81
00:05:30,281 --> 00:05:34,840
connection between the audience and the
characters on screen and this who they

82
00:05:34,841 --> 00:05:37,540
represent.
Finally,

83
00:05:37,541 --> 00:05:42,541
saving private ryan begins and ends with
a scene of private ryan in current day

84
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:46,180
attending the crosses of his fallen
saviors.

85
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:48,880
This is a clear reminder to the
audience.

86
00:05:48,881 --> 00:05:52,990
They're the generation that followed in
and survived the second world war is

87
00:05:52,991 --> 00:05:56,500
still among us.
I was arguing with speed work and tom

88
00:05:56,501 --> 00:06:00,560
hanks achieved the same effect even
better in band of brothers and two

89
00:06:00,561 --> 00:06:04,630
pacific.
My opens each episode with interviews of

90
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:07,490
the actual soldiers that are portrayed
on screen.

91
00:06:08,030 --> 00:06:12,560
My generation is I think the last
generation that can personally talk to

92
00:06:12,561 --> 00:06:15,980
veterans of world war two.
As roy metcalfe states,

93
00:06:16,010 --> 00:06:20,890
the gis are leaving us now,
leaving us a priceless legacy and this

94
00:06:20,910 --> 00:06:25,910
the responsibility of keeping a life.
Their experiences in our cultural memory

95
00:06:26,061 --> 00:06:30,680
will rest more and more upon the films
and series that's portrayed him.

96
00:06:34,010 --> 00:06:37,310
Thank you all for watching.
This video turned out a little bit

97
00:06:37,311 --> 00:06:41,600
different than our plans since I wanted
to compare saving private ryan tuerck

98
00:06:41,630 --> 00:06:46,630
german show called muto until father a
that uses the same techniques to give a

99
00:06:47,211 --> 00:06:49,850
different perspective on the german side
of the war.

100
00:06:50,270 --> 00:06:54,940
It has to audience sympathize with
normal german soldiers also being fixed

101
00:06:54,941 --> 00:06:57,190
in terms of the nazi regime.
Uh,

102
00:06:57,200 --> 00:07:00,950
unfortunately german copyright law made
it impossible anyway.
