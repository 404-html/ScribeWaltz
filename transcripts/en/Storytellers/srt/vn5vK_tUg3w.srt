00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:02,620
Thank you to squarespace for sponsoring
this video

2
00:00:07,220 --> 00:00:11,900
for as long as we know the existence of
border walls and boundaries have gone

3
00:00:11,901 --> 00:00:16,310
hand in hand with the development of
civilization and the human experience as

4
00:00:16,311 --> 00:00:21,311
a whole and the evilness 2015 film
sicario disorder manifests itself in the

5
00:00:21,980 --> 00:00:25,190
physical fence,
separating cartel infested Mexico from

6
00:00:25,191 --> 00:00:26,870
the United States.
However,

7
00:00:26,871 --> 00:00:30,410
the violence and chaos of the
neighboring country is slowly but surely

8
00:00:30,411 --> 00:00:33,560
creeping its way into the backyard of
the American society,

9
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:38,420
unseen by most yet visible and ever
grown to dos who know where to look.

10
00:00:38,680 --> 00:00:42,560
Kate Macer as part of an FBI getting
that response unit that's been engaged

11
00:00:42,561 --> 00:00:46,820
in cleaning up the mess of this ever
expanding problem in a lot of ways.

12
00:00:46,821 --> 00:00:49,970
Her story is similar to that of Keller
Dover from Vilnius,

13
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,390
prisoners,
kate or Macer to her colleagues is again

14
00:00:53,391 --> 00:00:58,010
a character with a strong moral compass
and a principle belief system as a

15
00:00:58,011 --> 00:01:01,670
strict agent of order and the law she
believes in speaking the truth without

16
00:01:01,671 --> 00:01:05,090
question the statement,
what do you want me to stay to work the

17
00:01:05,091 --> 00:01:07,130
truth with our last name?

18
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:11,480
Appropriately reflecting her disposition
as a strong representative of justice

19
00:01:11,481 --> 00:01:14,660
and the law and liked the inciting
incident of the illness,

20
00:01:14,690 --> 00:01:17,790
kidnapping mystery.
It is a southern and unexpectedly

21
00:01:17,810 --> 00:01:21,590
malevolent event that kickstarts the
protagonist journey into a confusing,

22
00:01:21,770 --> 00:01:26,300
morally chaotic world where her belief
system will be tested and blur to its

23
00:01:26,301 --> 00:01:28,680
core.
Just traumatic event push escapes.

24
00:01:28,700 --> 00:01:33,650
You volunteer for a task force led by
the ambiguous and unconventional Matt

25
00:01:33,650 --> 00:01:37,550
Graves with a mission devil take her to
the border of a country as well as the

26
00:01:37,551 --> 00:01:41,090
boundary of her own lawful world.
According to Jonathan,

27
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:45,200
the archetype of the board are commonly
symbolizes the world at the limit,

28
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:47,780
a place at the bottom,
and at the margin.

29
00:01:48,050 --> 00:01:51,410
It's a symbol of a place in the
periphery that protects the order of the

30
00:01:51,411 --> 00:01:55,610
center from the chaos of the unknown,
but it's often also a realm Verdi's.

31
00:01:55,700 --> 00:01:59,300
Two categories meet and become
interlinked and where it a difference

32
00:01:59,301 --> 00:02:03,290
between the two isn't always obvious and
thus it's a place where to garden.

33
00:02:03,291 --> 00:02:06,170
Heroes tend to be shown as hybrid beings
of sorts.

34
00:02:06,350 --> 00:02:08,660
Possessing elements from both sides of
the border

35
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:14,970
for Matt and his team working in between
the lines of the law is the only way to

36
00:02:14,971 --> 00:02:18,390
effectively protect the center.
Matt is shown to be both a

37
00:02:18,391 --> 00:02:23,370
representative of order
as well as an agent of chaos.

38
00:02:23,540 --> 00:02:26,400
Doing here is you're giving us the
opportunity to shake the tree,

39
00:02:26,430 --> 00:02:27,890
create chaos.
That's what it is.

40
00:02:28,130 --> 00:02:31,520
There's moral hybridity is further
depicted through aerial shots of the

41
00:02:31,521 --> 00:02:34,700
boarder landscape with it's beige colors
and rugged terrain,

42
00:02:34,701 --> 00:02:39,680
promoting descents of moral ambiguity.
Kate being an emissary of law and order

43
00:02:39,681 --> 00:02:43,190
with the illuminating light of moral
truth shining onto her,

44
00:02:43,370 --> 00:02:46,970
goes into the unknown.
Unprepared and ill equipped attempting

45
00:02:46,971 --> 00:02:50,960
to stay within the confines of the law,
but ultimately being unable to keep the

46
00:02:50,961 --> 00:02:55,070
chaos from invading her world.
Symbolical level of Kate's initial

47
00:02:55,071 --> 00:02:57,930
vision of our journey starts off fairly
archetypical.

48
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:02,120
The cartels did devils that threatened
to order and harmony of the center or

49
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:05,110
seem to be infiltrating ever deeper into
the country.

50
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:08,410
To restore this order and bring those
responsible to justice,

51
00:03:08,411 --> 00:03:12,940
she has to descend into chaos,
into the layer of the snake or the Cave

52
00:03:12,941 --> 00:03:16,090
of the beast.
This beast initially become strongly

53
00:03:16,091 --> 00:03:18,850
identified with the violence of the
cartels in general,

54
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,010
and the city of chorus in particular

55
00:03:21,890 --> 00:03:24,020
is obese.

56
00:03:24,820 --> 00:03:27,100
However,
her fellow task force members seemed to

57
00:03:27,101 --> 00:03:30,610
be participating and even reveling in
the lawlessness of the city.

58
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:34,650
Brilliant what they do when they
mutilated body like that.

59
00:03:35,210 --> 00:03:38,630
As a representative of the law.
Kate's presence then begins to put an

60
00:03:38,631 --> 00:03:42,860
increasing amount of physical and mental
pressure on her conscience as she

61
00:03:42,861 --> 00:03:45,950
quickly picks up smoking to cope with
this new reality.

62
00:03:46,310 --> 00:03:49,100
This evolution is mirrored by the
character of Sylvio,

63
00:03:49,220 --> 00:03:53,660
serving as a cautionary tale for Kate
Sylvio is her Mexican counterpart in law

64
00:03:53,661 --> 00:03:55,520
enforcement,
a godly man,

65
00:03:55,521 --> 00:03:59,540
and a father of a son who is desperately
trying to keep away from the chaos of

66
00:03:59,541 --> 00:04:02,240
the outside world as much as possible.
No.

67
00:04:02,900 --> 00:04:04,730
However,
it's revealed that Sylvia has been

68
00:04:04,731 --> 00:04:08,570
corrupted by the cartel and is quite
obviously struggling with this reality

69
00:04:08,571 --> 00:04:12,950
as he's often framed in a shadow smoking
cigarettes by the dozens and using

70
00:04:12,980 --> 00:04:15,950
alcohol to set up a barrier for his own
conscience,

71
00:04:16,220 --> 00:04:19,280
but whereas Sylvia's principals have
already been sacrificed,

72
00:04:19,281 --> 00:04:21,510
skate is showing you still be fighting
for hers.

73
00:04:21,590 --> 00:04:23,480
Yeah,
that was fucking illegal.

74
00:04:23,510 --> 00:04:26,740
You want to start a war,
but it's not long thereafter that she to

75
00:04:26,741 --> 00:04:31,110
realize is that the order she represents
has been turning a blind eye to the

76
00:04:31,111 --> 00:04:33,320
activities of maths,
hybrid heroes.

77
00:04:33,410 --> 00:04:36,080
So if your fear is operating out of
bounds,

78
00:04:36,410 --> 00:04:38,900
I am telling you you are not.

79
00:04:41,090 --> 00:04:44,750
Boundaries been moved.
This granting or permission by Kate

80
00:04:44,750 --> 00:04:48,260
Superior symbolizes the archetype of the
wise skiing or fodder culture,

81
00:04:48,380 --> 00:04:52,790
turning a blind eye or being naive or
oblivious due to dealing with chaotic,

82
00:04:52,791 --> 00:04:54,770
tyrannical,
broader or advisor,

83
00:04:55,100 --> 00:04:58,370
and it's this looking away that allows
for the boundary of operational

84
00:04:58,371 --> 00:05:02,450
procedures to be shifted across the
border and it has a helping hand and

85
00:05:02,451 --> 00:05:06,790
blurring the boundaries of order and
chaos and that represents gates own or

86
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:10,490
change in her world view.
Pivotal in this individual shift of

87
00:05:10,491 --> 00:05:13,220
boundaries are to characters of Reggie
and Alejandro.

88
00:05:13,550 --> 00:05:17,270
Reggie is shown to be kate's most
trusted friend into force and symbolizes

89
00:05:17,271 --> 00:05:19,670
every aspect of kate that aligns with
truth,

90
00:05:19,730 --> 00:05:22,730
law and order,
and it's precisely because of this that

91
00:05:22,731 --> 00:05:27,731
Matt does not want him on his team.
Reggie functions as irrational moral

92
00:05:29,391 --> 00:05:33,470
guide of order for Kate always seeing
dressed in blue and guiding k to seek

93
00:05:33,471 --> 00:05:35,870
the truth and state in line with the
code of law

94
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:36,913
cake,
but

95
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:40,140
you don't have to do this.

96
00:05:40,370 --> 00:05:44,420
Alejandro on the other hand is somewhat
of the polar opposite of Reggie being

97
00:05:44,421 --> 00:05:47,130
driven by strong emotional feelings of
hatred.

98
00:05:47,150 --> 00:05:51,410
The former prosecutor turned lawless,
hitman works for anyone who will set him

99
00:05:51,411 --> 00:05:54,020
loose on the people who killed his wife
and daughter.

100
00:05:54,350 --> 00:05:57,740
Alejandro is an agent of chaos,
a mysterious man.

101
00:05:57,741 --> 00:06:00,590
A few words often seen shrouded by
darkness,

102
00:06:00,740 --> 00:06:04,940
but ever present in the background.
He is a man who seems to have lost most

103
00:06:04,941 --> 00:06:09,230
of his humanity along the way,
either being referred to bias John Wick

104
00:06:09,231 --> 00:06:12,750
like nickname or as an animal or
fencing,

105
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:19,670
and even a Frankenstein monster or
emissary of the devil as he sets his

106
00:06:19,671 --> 00:06:21,640
sights on Fausto,
all our con,

107
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:26,530
the man responsible for the destruction
of his family appropriately named effort

108
00:06:26,531 --> 00:06:29,450
go to faust,
a man who has sold his soul to the devil

109
00:06:29,451 --> 00:06:31,970
and who ultimately has to face the
consequences.

110
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:35,750
Both these two characters influenced
gate and seem to function as agents of

111
00:06:35,780 --> 00:06:39,530
order and chaos respectively,
both from the real world as well as

112
00:06:39,531 --> 00:06:42,050
symbolically indicates own internal
world.

113
00:06:42,110 --> 00:06:46,160
We can see how Reggie's influence over
gate starts to dwindle as he unknowingly

114
00:06:46,161 --> 00:06:49,310
sets her up with her would be hitman
with our orderly site,

115
00:06:49,311 --> 00:06:50,960
blinded.
It's only fitting then at.

116
00:06:50,980 --> 00:06:54,800
Alondra appears over her like a shadow
just at the right time.

117
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:58,010
After this moment,
it is Alejandro who moves into the

118
00:06:58,011 --> 00:07:00,440
foreground and takes on a role as her
guardian.

119
00:07:00,980 --> 00:07:05,240
This unconscious shift into chaos can
also be seen in Kate's increasing lack

120
00:07:05,241 --> 00:07:10,241
of personal hygiene,
and it's a shift that comes to a climax

121
00:07:13,551 --> 00:07:15,560
in the mace,
like layer of the beast,

122
00:07:15,950 --> 00:07:20,330
both Reggie and all 100 venture into
different paths and although Reggie

123
00:07:20,331 --> 00:07:25,070
orders k to stay behind him,
she chooses to follow 100 instead and

124
00:07:25,071 --> 00:07:28,530
it's here at the center of the maze that
she discovers that her supposed to

125
00:07:28,531 --> 00:07:33,290
protect her and her and Zack agonist are
one and the same and ironically it's in

126
00:07:33,291 --> 00:07:37,910
her personal mission to tame chaos back
into order that she herself is the one

127
00:07:37,911 --> 00:07:42,230
who was brought to her knees in the end
to perceive archetypal narrative of the

128
00:07:42,231 --> 00:07:46,690
hero slaying the beast who terrorizes
the land is then suddenly subverted by a

129
00:07:46,691 --> 00:07:51,460
story more akin to that of the garden of
Eden cade wanting to deal with the

130
00:07:51,461 --> 00:07:56,090
increasing infestation of chaos as a
representative of order was unknowingly

131
00:07:56,091 --> 00:07:58,340
lured into tigray world of the
periphery.

132
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:02,030
Tempted by the potential outcome of
finally dealing with the layer of the

133
00:08:02,031 --> 00:08:06,230
snake to goodbye from the apple.
Only to realize that dealing with one

134
00:08:06,231 --> 00:08:09,440
snake would only allow for another to
rise to power.

135
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:16,580
In the end,
she's left shrouded from the light that

136
00:08:16,581 --> 00:08:20,870
had one shine onto her having been made
conscious overall mortality and

137
00:08:20,871 --> 00:08:23,690
fragility as well as that of the order
she serves.

138
00:08:23,990 --> 00:08:27,680
Alejandro forces her to finally sign
away her principles,

139
00:08:27,830 --> 00:08:32,150
the last holdout for the boundary that
is now collapsing all around her and

140
00:08:32,151 --> 00:08:34,160
escaped his left,
broken and alone.

141
00:08:34,430 --> 00:08:39,320
A new force moves into the foreground
emerging as a representative of chaos.

142
00:08:39,590 --> 00:08:43,250
Alejandro replaces the core stuff.
The father who's death has just been

143
00:08:43,251 --> 00:08:48,020
signed and echoes in a new era in which
the boundaries of the order of law have

144
00:08:48,021 --> 00:08:48,854
no place.

145
00:09:02,710 --> 00:09:05,040
Alright guys,
thank you all so much for watching and

146
00:09:05,041 --> 00:09:07,830
thank you to squarespace for sponsoring
this video.

147
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:10,800
As far as easy and convenient website
bill and goes,

148
00:09:10,801 --> 00:09:14,690
squarespace is a godsend.
People have been asking me whether

149
00:09:14,730 --> 00:09:16,870
storytellers has its own website.
As you know,

150
00:09:16,890 --> 00:09:19,230
it's pretty much a necessity in today's
world,

151
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:22,890
but since I don't know a single thing
about coding and I don't feel

152
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:26,490
comfortable spending money on something,
I might not be satisfied with the end

153
00:09:26,730 --> 00:09:28,740
we've gotten,
have been holding off on building one

154
00:09:28,741 --> 00:09:29,860
until now,
uh,

155
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:33,180
with squarespace or wherever.
You get a free trial so you can build

156
00:09:33,181 --> 00:09:37,140
your website before you even have to pay
for a single thing and you know,

157
00:09:37,141 --> 00:09:40,680
you can always change your mind if
you're not satisfied with the result.

158
00:09:40,740 --> 00:09:43,320
Besides that,
you'll get access to countless award

159
00:09:43,321 --> 00:09:46,500
winning templates,
making building a great looking website

160
00:09:46,530 --> 00:09:47,070
easy.

161
00:09:47,070 --> 00:09:50,280
Even for people like myself,
our website isn't quite done yet,

162
00:09:50,281 --> 00:09:54,120
but you can already click on the link in
the description and sign up for your own

163
00:09:54,121 --> 00:09:55,530
free trial.
After that,

164
00:09:55,531 --> 00:09:59,370
you can use our special promo code
storytellers with which you'll get 10

165
00:09:59,371 --> 00:10:03,240
percent off your first purchase.
If you decide to use squarespace and

166
00:10:03,241 --> 00:10:05,670
wants to support us,
make sure you use that code.

167
00:10:05,671 --> 00:10:07,950
Storytellers,
it helps us both out.

168
00:10:08,190 --> 00:10:09,750
Of course,
if you wish to support us in any other

169
00:10:09,751 --> 00:10:12,000
way,
you can also check out our patron page

170
00:10:12,001 --> 00:10:15,420

or you can leave a tip on paypal.

171
00:10:15,930 --> 00:10:18,090
