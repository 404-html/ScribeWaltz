1
00:00:13,510 --> 00:00:16,060
What is the dream?
The meaningless fantasy.

2
00:00:16,061 --> 00:00:20,770
You have the apps and mine
is it the moments in which everything

3
00:00:20,771 --> 00:00:23,110
about life seems to be in blissful
harmony.

4
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:26,260
When a struggles of everyday life don't
seem to exist?

5
00:00:26,890 --> 00:00:30,340
What happens when that dream turns out
to suddenly be nothing more than the

6
00:00:30,341 --> 00:00:35,341
line in the lose Ori Reality?
What happens when our life is suddenly

7
00:00:35,591 --> 00:00:40,060
turned upside down into chaos when we're
two days to even realize we're nearing

8
00:00:40,061 --> 00:00:43,570
rock bottom or when it's been two
lifeless to half men much at all.

9
00:00:43,930 --> 00:00:48,160
When he media comes crashing down and
through our reality and to the Light

10
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:51,690
House that stands at the center of our
unconscious and which we had trust it to

11
00:00:51,710 --> 00:00:56,350
light us a bath in to the unknown and
what happens when we're the ones who are

12
00:00:56,351 --> 00:01:00,460
directly responsible for this collapse,
carrying the burden of guilt.

13
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:02,620
Ever presence.
You remind us of our deeds.

14
00:01:03,220 --> 00:01:04,990
Perhaps you lick of paint will wash it
away.

15
00:01:05,230 --> 00:01:09,280
Covering the stains of who we truly are.
Maybe that way we get to move on.

16
00:01:11,330 --> 00:01:14,060
He's back and miracle that something's
off.

17
00:01:14,510 --> 00:01:16,610
He's changed and he's dying because of
me.

18
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,960
It's my fault.
I'm a space or whatever he has faced

19
00:01:19,961 --> 00:01:24,110
before me and him.
But where and how do we start?

20
00:01:31,810 --> 00:01:36,010
Blackwater National Park reported that a
light house was surrounded by something

21
00:01:36,011 --> 00:01:39,580
they termed a shimmer.
Is it a religious event,

22
00:01:40,060 --> 00:01:43,240
an extra terrestrial event,
perhaps a higher dimension,

23
00:01:43,630 --> 00:01:47,200
something so large and skill and alien
and appearance has to be something

24
00:01:47,201 --> 00:01:50,770
external outside of us.
And yet at the same time it feels

25
00:01:50,771 --> 00:01:54,010
strangely familiar,
like something profoundly internal,

26
00:01:54,011 --> 00:01:56,560
hidden behind in ever-growing fill of
illusion,

27
00:01:57,100 --> 00:02:00,730
staying on its edge and observing it
from a distance might feel safe,

28
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:04,570
but the only real solution is to be
found when we mustered the courage to

29
00:02:04,571 --> 00:02:09,571
venture inside and so we shell and the
unconscious one is unfortunately in the

30
00:02:09,731 --> 00:02:11,980
same situation as an a moonlit
landscape.

31
00:02:12,550 --> 00:02:16,360
All the contents are blurred and merge
into one another and one never knows

32
00:02:16,390 --> 00:02:21,390
exactly what or where anything is or
where one thing begins and ends.

33
00:02:24,190 --> 00:02:26,380
This world within the Dome is the
strangest,

34
00:02:26,381 --> 00:02:30,940
most confusing place.
One could visit and don't know where it

35
00:02:30,941 --> 00:02:33,100
was.
Time,

36
00:02:33,101 --> 00:02:36,520
space and matter merge seamlessly as if
in the dream,

37
00:02:36,940 --> 00:02:39,970
the order and structure of the outside
world don't exist here.

38
00:02:40,330 --> 00:02:43,210
To say one might get lost in this place
would be an understatement,

39
00:02:43,750 --> 00:02:47,500
and yet this is the place we
collectively find ourselves did.

40
00:02:47,501 --> 00:02:51,250
Geomorphologists beyond warning the
physicist without purpose,

41
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:53,710
the addict,
the terminally ill,

42
00:02:53,890 --> 00:02:58,600
the adulterer all in the state of inner
confusion risking their lives to find

43
00:02:58,601 --> 00:02:59,770
answers,
problems,

44
00:02:59,771 --> 00:03:03,330
only dose that are going through deep
inner instability would find himself

45
00:03:03,331 --> 00:03:04,164
Scott up in.

46
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:07,930
It's not exactly something you do if
your life is in perfect harmony,

47
00:03:08,930 --> 00:03:12,890
but if the king of this world is chaos,
then beauty is not the only thing one is

48
00:03:12,891 --> 00:03:17,090
bound to find lurking just below the
surface are those primal creatures that

49
00:03:17,091 --> 00:03:20,000
will test our instinctual abilities when
we least expect it.

50
00:03:22,220 --> 00:03:23,053
Okay.

51
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:27,440
The familiar dream in which to dreamers
pursued by an animal nearly always

52
00:03:27,441 --> 00:03:30,740
indicates that an instinct has been
split off from our consciousness and

53
00:03:30,741 --> 00:03:34,640
ought to be yours trying to be
readmitted and integrated into life.

54
00:03:34,940 --> 00:03:37,640
The more dangerous to behavior of the
animal and the dream.

55
00:03:37,820 --> 00:03:40,570
The more unconscious is the primitive
and instinctual soul.

56
00:03:40,590 --> 00:03:44,330
The dreamer and the more imperative is
its integration into his life.

57
00:03:44,331 --> 00:03:49,260
If some irreparable evil is to be
forestalled facing this dragon head on

58
00:03:49,270 --> 00:03:52,430
is to merge with the primal instincts
that can guide us deeper into this new

59
00:03:52,431 --> 00:03:55,010
world.
Failing to do so can make us stray from

60
00:03:55,011 --> 00:03:57,200
the light and become blinded in the
darkness,

61
00:03:57,500 --> 00:04:00,440
unconscious in Darfur,
a vulnerable to the dangerous that can

62
00:04:00,441 --> 00:04:02,210
emerge into our lives.
At any moment.

63
00:04:07,210 --> 00:04:09,640
We've come upon an abandoned military
base,

64
00:04:09,790 --> 00:04:13,750
a safe haven for those that came before
the memory card is found.

65
00:04:14,180 --> 00:04:18,160
His second revelation reveals itself.
The monsters we believe to be

66
00:04:18,161 --> 00:04:22,690
exclusively external nature dwell
abundantly within our own bodies,

67
00:04:23,020 --> 00:04:26,710
within our souls.
It realization emerges,

68
00:04:26,980 --> 00:04:31,000
am I to veal danger?
Am I nothing bent on self destruction,

69
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:32,850
right?
Drink well,

70
00:04:33,050 --> 00:04:38,050
we smell and taste stabilize the good
job having marriage

71
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:41,080
setting,
it will be to admit to one's own

72
00:04:41,081 --> 00:04:43,600
shortcomings,
which we so often tried to hide behind a

73
00:04:43,601 --> 00:04:46,870
mass personality,
denying it would be to disown its

74
00:04:46,871 --> 00:04:50,350
existence within oneself completely.
There was something alive inside that

75
00:04:50,351 --> 00:04:50,980
man.
No,

76
00:04:50,980 --> 00:04:54,340
that was a trick of the light.
When an individual makes an attempt to

77
00:04:54,341 --> 00:04:57,400
see your shadow,
he becomes aware of and often ashamed of

78
00:04:57,401 --> 00:05:00,040
those qualities and impulses he denies
in himself,

79
00:05:00,041 --> 00:05:03,130
but completely see you and other people
such things as egotism,

80
00:05:03,131 --> 00:05:07,210
mental laziness and sloppiness,
unreal fantasy's schemes and plots,

81
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:11,350
carelessness and cowardice insured all
the little sins about which he might

82
00:05:11,351 --> 00:05:13,840
previously have told himself.
That doesn't matter.

83
00:05:13,900 --> 00:05:15,850
Nobody will notice it,
and in any case,

84
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:20,050
although people do it too for to deny or
the only way out is to project one's own

85
00:05:20,051 --> 00:05:24,070
monsters on two dose around her.
How could I ever be a monster?

86
00:05:24,100 --> 00:05:26,290
Maybe you or you,
but not me.

87
00:05:26,650 --> 00:05:30,100
For it is I who knows the way and who
will save the world from then nation?

88
00:05:30,820 --> 00:05:33,940
It's unconscious failure or to come to
terms with one's own reality then

89
00:05:33,941 --> 00:05:36,580
becomes nothing more than another
ultimate dead end.

90
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:40,090
It is only doe sit on some level.
I've made peace with the fact that

91
00:05:40,091 --> 00:05:44,050
spending time in this world is slowly
changing who we are and how we perceive

92
00:05:44,051 --> 00:05:46,840
ourselves.
It's this growing realization that the

93
00:05:46,841 --> 00:05:50,380
tumor of the Shimmer isn't necessarily
caused by something outside of

94
00:05:50,381 --> 00:05:53,230
ourselves,
but perhaps an echo from our own in our

95
00:05:53,231 --> 00:05:56,800
world.
And so the only way to save the world

96
00:05:56,801 --> 00:06:00,650
would to save oneself.
But why would one bot or to go through

97
00:06:00,651 --> 00:06:04,280
such lengths to salvage something that
wasn't even perceive to contain much

98
00:06:04,281 --> 00:06:07,280
value to begin with?
Life does what it wants,

99
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:11,240
why bought are struggling against its
will and trust wants to face it.

100
00:06:12,380 --> 00:06:13,430
You want to fight it?

101
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:17,870
I don't think I want to either of those
things.

102
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:22,580
Only those who truly desire to return
will have the power to we merge.

103
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:27,200
And so one by one the companions bearish
dissolve and disappear.

104
00:06:27,620 --> 00:06:31,100
And so Lena is the only one left.
Why did they have to succumb to the

105
00:06:31,101 --> 00:06:35,390
darkness and why am I still here where
they really Anya Shepherd,

106
00:06:35,510 --> 00:06:40,340
Josie venturous or do you just
characters every dream fragmented parts

107
00:06:40,341 --> 00:06:44,330
of an unconscious personality seeking to
be integrated onto the body like the

108
00:06:44,331 --> 00:06:46,730
ever continuing cycle of death and
rebirth.

109
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:51,260
The sign of the oral burrows to dramatic
symbol of the snake eating its own till

110
00:06:51,261 --> 00:06:54,650
40 integration and assimilation of the
opposite of the shadow.

111
00:06:55,310 --> 00:06:59,150
The only way to truly find out what all
of this means is to make one final push

112
00:06:59,151 --> 00:07:01,700
towards the center,
towards the light house.

113
00:07:05,690 --> 00:07:09,080
In this final leg of the journey,
we are already well broken down,

114
00:07:09,590 --> 00:07:13,280
but as we enter into the lighthouse,
we slowly began to realize the toughest

115
00:07:13,281 --> 00:07:16,580
challenge is still in front of us,
hidden in the darkness,

116
00:07:16,610 --> 00:07:20,410
deep beneath the shining light at a
tower in Mandela shaped or puberes

117
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:23,840
magnificent in its wholeness,
but equally frightening and appearance.

118
00:07:23,841 --> 00:07:27,620
It shows us a mirror out of which a
figure emerges in shock.

119
00:07:27,621 --> 00:07:30,920
We stumble and we run,
or perhaps we don't run at all,

120
00:07:30,921 --> 00:07:33,140
but lose ourselves in complete
confusion.

121
00:07:33,550 --> 00:07:34,700
People call him the cane.

122
00:07:36,910 --> 00:07:37,660
Yeah.

123
00:07:37,660 --> 00:07:40,780
Now I'm not so sure I can try to fight
it,

124
00:07:40,900 --> 00:07:45,070
but it mirrors my every move,
so perhaps I should desire it for self

125
00:07:45,071 --> 00:07:47,170
destruction is ultimately all that
certain.

126
00:07:47,770 --> 00:07:50,230
What is this creature at acts as if my
shadow,

127
00:07:50,770 --> 00:07:55,030
suddenly a face begins to take form you
sudden realization dawns on us.

128
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:57,873
You May.

129
00:07:58,250 --> 00:08:01,610
If you are mean,
if you are more meat and I am than I am

130
00:08:01,611 --> 00:08:03,920
alive and I can exist no longer.
Okay.

131
00:08:03,921 --> 00:08:08,900
At Baron we finally become fully aware
that this world is not at all alien in

132
00:08:08,901 --> 00:08:11,300
nature,
but a part of her own self that was

133
00:08:11,301 --> 00:08:15,200
hidden away in our unconscious,
desperately trying to be acknowledged.

134
00:08:15,830 --> 00:08:16,830
The only way forward for

135
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:21,070
Dennis to look oneself directly in the
eye and accepting to shadow as it is

136
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:26,520
only then can final illuminating
integration be achieved and miss the

137
00:08:26,621 --> 00:08:30,160
hero is the one who conquers the dragon,
not the one who was devoured by it.

138
00:08:30,610 --> 00:08:33,340
Only one who has risks.
The fight with the dragon and it's not

139
00:08:33,341 --> 00:08:36,550
overcome by winds.
The horde the treasurer hard to attain.

140
00:08:37,150 --> 00:08:41,290
He alone has a genuine claim to self
confidence for he has faced a dark

141
00:08:41,291 --> 00:08:43,840
rounds of the self and dare buying has
gained himself.

142
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:46,390
We now know better.
We truly are.

143
00:08:46,391 --> 00:08:51,190
And if Daryl by dissolved or pathologies
do return to orders there for shown as a

144
00:08:51,191 --> 00:08:54,280
reconciliation of true previously a
strange soles,

145
00:08:54,870 --> 00:08:58,770
both fought and died in one way or
another and both have reemerged as

146
00:08:58,771 --> 00:09:02,340
someone else won a mere shadow of his
former self.

147
00:09:02,370 --> 00:09:06,570
The other more intact strangers but
strangers more attuned to each other

148
00:09:06,571 --> 00:09:08,970
than ever before.
Embracing one another.

149
00:09:08,971 --> 00:09:11,160
So the very first step to start a new.

150
00:09:14,970 --> 00:09:15,803
Okay.

151
00:09:16,610 --> 00:09:19,790
Thank you so much for watching.
If you liked this video and enjoy our

152
00:09:19,791 --> 00:09:22,370
content,
please consider supporting our work on

153
00:09:22,371 --> 00:09:24,830
patron.
We're consider leaving us a one time

154
00:09:24,831 --> 00:09:28,040
donation on paypal.
At this point we cannot rely on ad

155
00:09:28,041 --> 00:09:30,950
revenue alone.
So all of your donations truly help to

156
00:09:30,951 --> 00:09:34,190
sustain a channel and in return you can
get to if our channels stickers.

157
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:36,500
Also,
we are fairly active on twitter,

158
00:09:36,501 --> 00:09:39,980
so consider following us on there if you
want to stay up to date on the channel

159
00:09:40,300 --> 00:09:40,971
at.
Lastly,

160
00:09:40,971 --> 00:09:42,960
I'd like to think our top patrons,
Itas,

161
00:09:43,170 --> 00:09:45,950
mackers and Kevin and grim.
You guys are awesome.

162
00:09:45,951 --> 00:09:48,080
Thank you so much for your continued
support.

163
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:50,330
Thank you all for watching everyone.
See you in the next one.
