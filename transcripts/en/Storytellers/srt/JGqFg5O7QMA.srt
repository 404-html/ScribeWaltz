1
00:00:02,700 --> 00:00:05,190
I've always found it intriguing that
Martin Scorsese,

2
00:00:05,220 --> 00:00:07,560
goodfellas starts it.
Story here,

3
00:00:07,980 --> 00:00:10,240
a car on a deserted road.
Our protagonist,

4
00:00:10,270 --> 00:00:13,560
Henry Hill,
behind wheel is travel companions dozing

5
00:00:13,561 --> 00:00:15,660
off in the background.
No dawn's,

6
00:00:15,661 --> 00:00:18,260
no Tuxedos,
no highbrow melodrama,

7
00:00:18,630 --> 00:00:21,780
just three guys sitting in a car trying
to pass the time,

8
00:00:22,110 --> 00:00:24,110
a scene,
so mundane and so relatable.

9
00:00:24,130 --> 00:00:28,650
Other than these few fleeting seconds
you along with our companions here would

10
00:00:28,651 --> 00:00:30,840
almost forget that this is a gangster
movie.

11
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:36,480
Of course,
Chris says he's just setting us up for

12
00:00:36,481 --> 00:00:40,940
an early shock reveal
and just like that.

13
00:00:40,970 --> 00:00:45,020
We stopped relating and it's through
relative ease in which Tommy and Jimmy

14
00:00:45,021 --> 00:00:47,990
finished off her begging victim.
That throws us off even more.

15
00:00:49,250 --> 00:00:52,520
Yet we're intrigued.
Social Studies switch the focus to

16
00:00:52,521 --> 00:00:54,050
Henry,
his face lit,

17
00:00:54,051 --> 00:00:56,630
read like he's staring straight into
hell itself.

18
00:00:57,040 --> 00:01:01,080
We didn't invites us to join him and be
our guide in this journey of the bace in

19
00:01:01,100 --> 00:01:05,630
sin and what's become known as one of
the most famous lines in gangster film

20
00:01:05,631 --> 00:01:07,910
history.
As far back as I can remember,

21
00:01:07,911 --> 00:01:09,290
I always wanted to be a gangster

22
00:01:17,990 --> 00:01:21,800
opening credits barely having passed by.
We can already tell that Scorsese,

23
00:01:21,801 --> 00:01:24,800
yes,
they can have 180 degree turn away from

24
00:01:24,801 --> 00:01:28,970
another a gangster movie because instead
of directing his attention upwards on

25
00:01:28,971 --> 00:01:32,240
larger than life characters at the very
top of the mafia hierarchy,

26
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:35,920
score says he chooses to put the
spotlight on the blue color gangsters

27
00:01:35,930 --> 00:01:40,620
down below in the streets of Queens.
New York didn't find this focal point

28
00:01:40,621 --> 00:01:43,910
and attempted gays.
Have an everyday kid who's only desire

29
00:01:43,911 --> 00:01:47,840
is to become somebody in a world of
nobodies and restore your,

30
00:01:47,841 --> 00:01:50,150
of course is an adaptation of Nicholas
Pileggi book,

31
00:01:50,151 --> 00:01:52,660
White Sky,
which chronicles the life in crime with

32
00:01:52,661 --> 00:01:56,780
the real Henry Hill Square says you
supposedly was so impressed by the

33
00:01:56,781 --> 00:02:00,800
gritty realism and attention to detail
the boot that he decided to treat his

34
00:02:00,801 --> 00:02:03,200
movie adaptation like a stage
documentary,

35
00:02:03,620 --> 00:02:06,380
and we'd attempt to at least preserve
the spirit of adaptive manner.

36
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,150
The most obvious result of which is
conveyed in score says you still have

37
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:10,993
the voiceover.

38
00:02:16,170 --> 00:02:17,850
One day.
One day,

39
00:02:17,851 --> 00:02:20,880
some of the kids from the neighborhood
carried my mother's groceries all the

40
00:02:20,881 --> 00:02:24,820
way home.
It would perhaps be more fitting to

41
00:02:24,821 --> 00:02:29,380
rebrand Henry's recurring voiceover as a
sort of audio commentary about his own

42
00:02:29,381 --> 00:02:31,960
rise and fall.
It's almost like we're watching the

43
00:02:31,961 --> 00:02:34,330
footage with Henry in every now and
then.

44
00:02:34,331 --> 00:02:38,320
He pauses the film at various important
points you provide us with additional

45
00:02:38,321 --> 00:02:39,760
information.
Henry's wife,

46
00:02:39,761 --> 00:02:42,280
Karen,
is also featured in the voiceover which

47
00:02:42,370 --> 00:02:47,370
adds to the talking heads documentary
like feel of the movie which were says

48
00:02:47,381 --> 00:02:50,560
he stopped just short of actually
showing us Henry watching and

49
00:02:50,561 --> 00:02:54,100
compensating on the food issue himself.
The end result of the strive for realism

50
00:02:54,101 --> 00:02:58,240
is that we get the feeling that what
we're watching is truly authentic slice

51
00:02:58,241 --> 00:03:03,040
of life for you to over romanticizing
with actors behaving redder than acting,

52
00:03:03,390 --> 00:03:06,790
but quite paradoxically.
It's precisely this aspect of the movie

53
00:03:06,791 --> 00:03:10,090
that makes us get drawn into Henry's
experiences even more.

54
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:14,330
Your watch closely how Henry guides us
through his teams as you rationalizes

55
00:03:14,340 --> 00:03:17,290
away,
why he chose the life right up until the

56
00:03:17,291 --> 00:03:20,790
point that we see him as a full grown
self proclaimed wiseguy.

57
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:23,980
From that point on,
we hang out with his friends at the bar

58
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:26,830
you listened to and laugh at Zombie
stories.

59
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:30,700
We share a shock as the tension builds
and we realized that laughing might not

60
00:03:30,701 --> 00:03:32,680
have been such a great idea after all

61
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:40,590
to
talk.

62
00:03:42,460 --> 00:03:46,120
We Watch Henry find love.
We even get to see his personal holiday.

63
00:03:46,121 --> 00:03:50,350
Pictures were sucked in.
We rapidly become part of Henry Story to

64
00:03:50,351 --> 00:03:55,150
such an extent that at times we
experience it through his own eyes or as

65
00:03:55,151 --> 00:03:58,990
a sort of extension of himself as he
introduces us to all of his wife's guy

66
00:03:58,991 --> 00:04:02,140
friends in the bamboo bar,
but of course there's really only one

67
00:04:02,141 --> 00:04:04,480
scene that captures this feeling
perfectly.

68
00:04:05,330 --> 00:04:09,490
Copacabana scene really is the apex of
seduction in the film and this three

69
00:04:09,491 --> 00:04:13,120
minute long tracking shot.
We're positioned right behind Henry and

70
00:04:13,121 --> 00:04:16,240
Karen who are going on our first serious
date in the background,

71
00:04:16,241 --> 00:04:18,180
a song.
Then he kissed me by crystal,

72
00:04:18,250 --> 00:04:22,510
starts to play a playful oh,
to seduction itself by taking it back to

73
00:04:22,511 --> 00:04:24,910
her entrance.
Henry shows that he's no longer waiting

74
00:04:24,911 --> 00:04:28,020
around like everyone else,
ironically is a sentence.

75
00:04:28,021 --> 00:04:33,010
You power is then shown by the sense
into the basement door magically opens

76
00:04:33,030 --> 00:04:36,130
for a couple when we entered a lower
corridors of the venue,

77
00:04:36,430 --> 00:04:40,450
athlete colored red as if the two F
major descends into the realms of the

78
00:04:40,451 --> 00:04:43,660
underworld or hell itself everywhere at
a law.

79
00:04:43,660 --> 00:04:46,390
People read.
Henry is Karen walks beside him and

80
00:04:47,110 --> 00:04:49,720
that's a shot.
Moves on and dawns on us at the scene

81
00:04:49,721 --> 00:04:52,300
isn't just all about Henry's moving with
Karen.

82
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:56,560
No Scorsese has stated himself.
It's also about the lifestyles to

83
00:04:56,561 --> 00:05:01,300
deucing him because it symbolizes
Henry's achieve goals of recognition and

84
00:05:01,301 --> 00:05:05,440
social mobility as he moves into the
club from the back and ends up right at

85
00:05:05,441 --> 00:05:08,500
the center of the stage.
It's a brilliant scene which captures

86
00:05:08,501 --> 00:05:13,180
what scholar folio or Zito as called the
kinetic energy of the film perfectly,

87
00:05:13,660 --> 00:05:16,380
and it's this energy that binds
Scorsese's dry for real,

88
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:19,630
as tendency towards expressive
stylization that you get her,

89
00:05:19,690 --> 00:05:23,020
which seduce us as much as it does Henry
and Karen.

90
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:26,800
It's an energy that moves the story
forward and provides them with an almost

91
00:05:26,801 --> 00:05:29,950
unending momentum is the ease with which
things come.

92
00:05:29,951 --> 00:05:34,120
The amount of freedom and control henry
has over his own life that transport him

93
00:05:34,121 --> 00:05:34,954
forward.

94
00:05:35,740 --> 00:05:38,570
I could do anything.
The fact that Henry says this while he

95
00:05:38,571 --> 00:05:43,270
was parking cars as a fitting metaphor
for his sense of mobility and especially

96
00:05:43,271 --> 00:05:45,610
considering the historical context with
the fifties,

97
00:05:45,611 --> 00:05:49,060
with cars being produced en masse and
President Eisenhower proposing to

98
00:05:49,061 --> 00:05:54,061
interstate highway plan in 1955 square
says he then use it as newly increased

99
00:05:54,071 --> 00:05:58,010
freedom of movement as a Motif for both
Henry's as well as the film's own

100
00:05:58,011 --> 00:06:01,490
momentum as can already be observed here
in the opening.

101
00:06:01,491 --> 00:06:06,440
Credits
for Henry car signify a sense of total

102
00:06:06,441 --> 00:06:09,980
control as he sees himself as a driver
of his own life.

103
00:06:10,070 --> 00:06:13,490
This feeling gives henry the impression
that he can do whatever you desires,

104
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:17,840
like blatantly cheating on his wife and
dealing in cocaine despite of the fact

105
00:06:17,841 --> 00:06:22,330
that Bali told them not to and he's busy
living life in the fast lane,

106
00:06:22,370 --> 00:06:25,490
separated from the rest of us until he
isn't.

107
00:06:28,250 --> 00:06:32,690
Perception does build on and sustained
by the loss of freedom for some and the

108
00:06:32,691 --> 00:06:37,580
loss of life or others are protagonists
are always scared of losing control or

109
00:06:37,581 --> 00:06:39,650
being perceived as someone who founded,
which is white,

110
00:06:39,670 --> 00:06:43,490
Tommy you can handle being put down and
why Jimmy becomes increasingly paranoid

111
00:06:43,491 --> 00:06:46,940
after the Loofah is our rate,
is this combination of fear and greed

112
00:06:46,941 --> 00:06:50,210
that ultimately puts a full stop to the
momentum of Henry's fruit,

113
00:06:50,211 --> 00:06:53,480
a year long ride,
and we come to the conclusion that

114
00:06:53,481 --> 00:06:58,481
despite having had everything actually
had very little sense of control,

115
00:06:58,521 --> 00:07:02,360
has always been in the hands of Bali.
His friends can turn into enemies in

116
00:07:02,361 --> 00:07:05,720
mere seconds,
so he ends his story where he left off

117
00:07:05,810 --> 00:07:09,800
in the state of motionless as a rat.
Moving then drives away from his new

118
00:07:09,801 --> 00:07:11,840
house,
signifying the life,

119
00:07:11,841 --> 00:07:14,720
leaving him behind,
and we of course is aware that we've

120
00:07:14,721 --> 00:07:18,440
been watching as he breaks the fourth
wall right here and the court can mean

121
00:07:18,460 --> 00:07:19,293
anything.

122
00:07:19,330 --> 00:07:24,330
I was broke
or he has consciously been our guide,

123
00:07:24,561 --> 00:07:28,850
our brotherly demon throughout the film,
and we empathize with him because his

124
00:07:28,851 --> 00:07:33,800
desire is to an extent our own henry's
been seduced by life and he doesn't

125
00:07:33,801 --> 00:07:35,800
regret it,
and according to Scorsese,

126
00:07:35,970 --> 00:07:39,710
we are all sinners and we can all
empathize with the characters to do is

127
00:07:39,711 --> 00:07:43,270
my money and power because those
beginning shots of Henry staring out of

128
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:47,090
his window reflect not only his own
longing for wealth recognition and

129
00:07:47,091 --> 00:07:50,060
control,
but also and perhaps more importantly,

130
00:07:50,061 --> 00:07:52,820
our own voyeuristic gaze into our
protagonist,

131
00:07:52,821 --> 00:07:56,510
sinful in the grief world,
and we just just helped us open up the

132
00:07:56,511 --> 00:08:00,470
blinders to give us a better look
consumer life because he knows all too

133
00:08:00,471 --> 00:08:03,530
well that although we've just been
watching from the sidelines,

134
00:08:03,531 --> 00:08:07,490
there's something very deep inside of us
all that might just be asking you

135
00:08:07,630 --> 00:08:08,470
four more.

136
00:08:18,620 --> 00:08:20,990
Right guys.
That's the end of yet another video

137
00:08:20,991 --> 00:08:22,610
analysis.
As always,

138
00:08:22,611 --> 00:08:25,430
I hope you enjoyed the.
There's just so much substance to

139
00:08:25,460 --> 00:08:27,830
goodfellows that it's just really too
much to talk about.

140
00:08:27,860 --> 00:08:29,690
Uh,
but I hope I managed to capture the main

141
00:08:29,691 --> 00:08:31,130
gist of it,
this video.

142
00:08:31,370 --> 00:08:32,570
Well,
if you do want to know more,

143
00:08:32,571 --> 00:08:36,320
I will upload my additional video
commentary on Goodfellas on our Patrion

144
00:08:36,321 --> 00:08:38,030
page tomorrow.
So check that out.

145
00:08:38,031 --> 00:08:40,460
If you love what we do and helps us out
tremendously,

146
00:08:41,030 --> 00:08:44,900
then I'd like to thank offer Fulvio or
Zito for his article on realism and

147
00:08:44,901 --> 00:08:46,910
formalism,
but trust the main inspiration for this

148
00:08:46,911 --> 00:08:48,020
video.
And of course,

149
00:08:48,021 --> 00:08:51,440
Michael Tucker from lessons of the
screenplay for helping me improve my

150
00:08:51,441 --> 00:08:54,230
audio quality just a little bit.
It's still not perfect,

151
00:08:54,231 --> 00:08:56,780
but I think we're slowly getting there.
All right.

152
00:08:56,810 --> 00:08:58,850
Thank you all for watching and see you
in the next one.
