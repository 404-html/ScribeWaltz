1
00:00:02,690 --> 00:00:06,950
I think the dark nights racist will
always be remembered as a film that just

2
00:00:06,980 --> 00:00:09,560
couldn't quite step out of the shadow of
its predecessor.

3
00:00:09,620 --> 00:00:11,990
The dark nights,
and I think we all know who's

4
00:00:12,020 --> 00:00:13,160
responsible for this.

5
00:00:15,370 --> 00:00:18,040
Good evening,
ladies and gentle man.

6
00:00:21,670 --> 00:00:26,670
We are tonight's entertainment.
However,

7
00:00:26,891 --> 00:00:30,280
we can see the dark nights rises on its
own not only as a good,

8
00:00:30,340 --> 00:00:34,360
if not excellent film births as a
closure of the trilogy that's perfectly

9
00:00:34,361 --> 00:00:38,080
built upon and resource the inner
struggle of Batman that has been built

10
00:00:38,081 --> 00:00:40,840
up within the previous films.
To do this,

11
00:00:40,841 --> 00:00:43,180
however,
we must first reject to political

12
00:00:43,181 --> 00:00:47,500
readings of the film that dominated for
fuse and discussions on the dark knight

13
00:00:47,501 --> 00:00:50,410
rises.
We do this by first exploring the ways

14
00:00:50,440 --> 00:00:54,010
in which Christopher Nolan constructs
narratives and then showing the

15
00:00:54,011 --> 00:00:58,210
underlying psychological symbolism to
which the personal story of the dark

16
00:00:58,211 --> 00:01:00,040
knight that's rices escape.
There

17
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:14,730
now in many refuse and discussions of
the dark knight rises the supposed

18
00:01:14,731 --> 00:01:18,900
political meaning of the film.
What's a central topic I have discussed

19
00:01:18,901 --> 00:01:20,130
before,
how in Juneau,

20
00:01:20,131 --> 00:01:24,570
many reviewers and pundits mistakenly
focused on Juno supposed political

21
00:01:24,571 --> 00:01:29,310
message considering abortion and
motherhood's a similar fate has befallen

22
00:01:29,311 --> 00:01:33,420
the dark knight rises Cosworth the
reviewers and pundits clave that the

23
00:01:33,421 --> 00:01:37,500
dark knight rises also clear and it's
important conservative message.

24
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:40,500
According to them,
the dark knight rises shows perfectly.

25
00:01:40,501 --> 00:01:44,810
The evil of leftist political revolution
is beans for Toric,

26
00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:48,960
not the same as that of a Marxist
revolutionary leader or even closer to

27
00:01:48,961 --> 00:01:51,660
home as death of the occupy Wall Street
movement.

28
00:01:52,530 --> 00:01:57,530
Take Gotham from dark car rock.
Those are generations who have kept you

29
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:08,120
down with myths of I'll put shoes on a
team and we give it back to you.

30
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:11,080
The people.

31
00:02:13,270 --> 00:02:16,760
Roundup is yours.
A sentencing trials.

32
00:02:16,761 --> 00:02:19,640
Now,
the spires by the trials of the French

33
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:22,640
Revolution as conservative pundits,
Ben Shapiro states,

34
00:02:22,700 --> 00:02:25,640
dark knight rises was probably not even
meant to be a conservative movie.

35
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:28,730
The entire movie is a diatribe about
Marxism and the French revolution.

36
00:02:28,731 --> 00:02:30,700
I mean,
there's including a full trial,

37
00:02:30,701 --> 00:02:32,360
seen a mock trial team.
Uh,

38
00:02:32,361 --> 00:02:33,410
it's,
it's fantastic.

39
00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:36,900
Even more so.
It is the police as representatives of

40
00:02:36,901 --> 00:02:39,510
order and establishment,
the together with,

41
00:02:39,540 --> 00:02:43,020
well for Fuck Sake,
a billionaire defend the city against

42
00:02:43,021 --> 00:02:47,100
this Marxist revolution of the people
and who are higher of the ferry left

43
00:02:47,130 --> 00:02:51,120
progressive websites alone,
even dare to call the Dark Knight

44
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:53,700
Advices,
a fascist movie stating the Mesas are

45
00:02:53,701 --> 00:02:57,240
the Philippines and the one time
overlords are the heroes.

46
00:02:57,690 --> 00:03:01,930
Although some conservatives to celebrate
Christopher Nolan as much need as

47
00:03:01,931 --> 00:03:06,220
conservative voice in Liberal Hollywood.
He himself was surprised by these

48
00:03:06,221 --> 00:03:11,110
political interpretations of his film.
He stated what was surprising to me is

49
00:03:11,111 --> 00:03:15,220
how many pundits booth right about the
political interpretation of the film and

50
00:03:15,221 --> 00:03:19,360
not understand that any one political
interpretation necessarily involve

51
00:03:19,390 --> 00:03:22,870
ignoring huge chunks of the film.
Nolan argued death.

52
00:03:22,871 --> 00:03:27,550
He simply tried to expose tensions in
society that somebody could exploit and

53
00:03:27,551 --> 00:03:31,060
that you can get falsely different
political interpretations from the

54
00:03:31,061 --> 00:03:32,910
movie.
Slash Boise Sec,

55
00:03:32,911 --> 00:03:35,860
for example,
stated that there is very much a strange

56
00:03:35,861 --> 00:03:39,940
attraction and excitement in the film
considering the idea of power to the

57
00:03:39,941 --> 00:03:42,810
people.
He can see this for example in catwoman

58
00:03:42,850 --> 00:03:46,450
who so seductively whispers to our
billionaire protagonist.

59
00:03:47,210 --> 00:03:52,210
You think all this can last storm coming
story when your friends better because

60
00:03:57,040 --> 00:04:01,810
you're all kind of wonder how you ever
and leave.

61
00:04:01,890 --> 00:04:02,723
So

62
00:04:06,670 --> 00:04:10,540
and the strange satisfaction we gets
when Bain states who his employer,

63
00:04:21,510 --> 00:04:22,350
this gives you,

64
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:28,260
Jesus concludes that the interpretation
of the dark knight rises as conservative

65
00:04:28,290 --> 00:04:30,840
or Liberal,
I have fewer sands for fewer assess more

66
00:04:30,841 --> 00:04:35,340
about them than about the film itself.
Now I think by focusing so much on the

67
00:04:35,341 --> 00:04:38,850
political meaning of the film,
we are not only missing the two team of

68
00:04:38,851 --> 00:04:41,340
the film,
but we are also fundamentally missing

69
00:04:41,341 --> 00:04:44,040
how Christopher Nolan Constructs his
narratives.

70
00:04:44,220 --> 00:04:46,560
The epidermis,
the film supposed to conservative

71
00:04:46,561 --> 00:04:51,110
message can be seen in the final clash
of the good guy police protectors of law

72
00:04:51,111 --> 00:04:55,960
and order to get her with Batman versus
the Marxists proletariats less by bane

73
00:05:20,330 --> 00:05:21,390
totally doors.

74
00:05:24,690 --> 00:05:28,350
But then it turns out that the true
pivotal scene of the film is the one

75
00:05:28,351 --> 00:05:32,400
that comes right off to this clash where
it is revealed that a real villain and

76
00:05:32,401 --> 00:05:34,860
leader of the League of shadows is
affect Miranda,

77
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:36,150
Datto Frosto,
ghoul

78
00:05:37,180 --> 00:05:40,860
child Razia alcohol may decline.
Then he's not the

79
00:05:42,540 --> 00:05:47,540
I
and the lime not ordinary.

80
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:58,370
Such a plot twist is of course typical
for Christopher Nolan.

81
00:05:58,520 --> 00:06:02,240
Famous force layered complicated
narratives where nothing is but it

82
00:06:02,241 --> 00:06:04,220
seems.
Now,

83
00:06:04,221 --> 00:06:08,570
Walter Ben Michael's has analyzed
Nolan's narrative style and concluded

84
00:06:08,571 --> 00:06:12,200
that the key to notice plot twist is
they're building towards the twist.

85
00:06:12,201 --> 00:06:15,140
The information to see the twist coming
is already there.

86
00:06:17,050 --> 00:06:19,810
Never show anyone,
beg you,

87
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:22,600
and they'll fly you for the secret,
but as soon as you give it up,

88
00:06:23,650 --> 00:06:24,483
you'll be nothing to

89
00:06:25,410 --> 00:06:28,560
he states for known as plot twists to be
successful,

90
00:06:28,620 --> 00:06:32,370
the audience must deceive itself.
Must refuse to see the obvious

91
00:06:32,371 --> 00:06:35,340
explanation for what is in front of it's
very eyes.

92
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:39,630
Nolan manipulates the audience desire to
be mystified by what they see.

93
00:06:39,660 --> 00:06:43,470
So deathly effect when the hidden
information is finally revealed,

94
00:06:43,530 --> 00:06:47,340
it's magnified indeed normalness called
filmic narrative itself.

95
00:06:47,370 --> 00:06:50,750
The controlled release of information,
Nolan often heights,

96
00:06:50,751 --> 00:06:54,810
the information in elaborate layers of
narratives search as we can see in films

97
00:06:54,811 --> 00:06:59,790
like the Prestige Memento and inception.
Now the narrative structure of the dark

98
00:06:59,791 --> 00:07:03,150
knight trilogy is more straight forward
than that of these fills,

99
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:06,840
but Nolan's plot twists and hidden
information is still there.

100
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:10,410
By rewatching the dark knight rises with
the plot twist in mind,

101
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:14,090
we can see that the film central team
isn't a straight forward action hero

102
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:18,600
clash off button and for us has been
both a completion of betterment's own

103
00:07:18,601 --> 00:07:21,360
psychological struggle in the dark
knight rises.

104
00:07:21,361 --> 00:07:24,630
We meet Bruce Wayne,
not only in a horrible physical state,

105
00:07:24,690 --> 00:07:27,270
but also in a horrible psychological
state.

106
00:07:27,390 --> 00:07:31,530
Still wallowing in the debt off Rachel
and by extension his parents,

107
00:07:31,531 --> 00:07:34,170
he cannot leave Gotham and the Batman
behind.

108
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:39,540
I did find so I know and you lost him,
but that's all part of living sir,

109
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:42,270
but you're not living.
You're just waiting,

110
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:43,590
hoping,
but things to go bad.

111
00:07:43,591 --> 00:07:44,040
Again.

112
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:48,300
Nolan himself has set that gotten itself
is a symbol for Bruce Wayne's

113
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:51,130
psychological state.
We can also find bruce ways,

114
00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:54,870
psychological struggle in the symbolic
objects of his mother's necklace.

115
00:07:55,780 --> 00:07:58,840
That's a beautiful necklace.
Reminds me of one that belonged to my

116
00:07:58,841 --> 00:08:01,340
mother.
Can't be the same

117
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:05,770
cause.
Her pearls are in this safe,

118
00:08:06,340 --> 00:08:09,250
which is broken.
Rushees shut in Batman begins,

119
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:14,110
but now it's reassembled by bruce and
kept in a safe before it got stolen by

120
00:08:14,111 --> 00:08:18,070
Serena Ak Catwoman.
This necklace in the film contains a

121
00:08:18,071 --> 00:08:21,910
whole array off symbolic gesturing.
We can see it in Bruce repairing the

122
00:08:21,911 --> 00:08:24,340
necklace,
which is symbolic for trying to heal his

123
00:08:24,341 --> 00:08:28,390
wounds to keeping it in a safe as
symbolic for trying to protect his

124
00:08:28,391 --> 00:08:31,450
wounded psych.
This use of a safe as a symbol to

125
00:08:31,451 --> 00:08:36,070
protect one psych is of course also seen
and one of nowness other films inception

126
00:08:37,940 --> 00:08:41,510
to bruce keeping us modest necklace.
We can see that he can't let go of the

127
00:08:41,511 --> 00:08:44,900
past and a distress.
Not a coincidence that the woman who

128
00:08:44,901 --> 00:08:48,410
takes the necklace away from it.
It's also the woman who eventually is

129
00:08:48,411 --> 00:08:51,230
critical for Bruce being able to let go
of this past.

130
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:56,250
Come with me.
Save

131
00:08:56,250 --> 00:09:01,250
yourself.
You don't owe these people anymore.

132
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:04,260
You've given them everything.

133
00:09:04,790 --> 00:09:06,230
Now,
upon second viewing,

134
00:09:06,231 --> 00:09:10,730
we know that the true feeling of the
film is Miranda and she is very much

135
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:15,040
parallel to Bruce Wayne's story,
but Bruce Wayne and Batman begins

136
00:09:15,041 --> 00:09:16,520
Wallace for French,
for a spouse.

137
00:09:16,521 --> 00:09:19,180
Death almost joined the League of
shadows.

138
00:09:19,181 --> 00:09:21,150
Bird thank creates Batman.
We run that.

139
00:09:21,151 --> 00:09:24,890
I had a similar faith where her mother
was killed by criminals as a father by

140
00:09:24,891 --> 00:09:25,970
Bruce Wayne.
Yes,

141
00:09:25,971 --> 00:09:27,920
she does.
Joined the League of shadows.

142
00:09:33,570 --> 00:09:34,403
Rick,

143
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:41,940
in this video on the joker,
lessons from the screenplay explains the

144
00:09:41,941 --> 00:09:45,930
joker is an amazing antagonist because
he exploits the weaknesses of the

145
00:09:45,931 --> 00:09:48,740
protagonists,
Batman and that they both Bethel for the

146
00:09:48,750 --> 00:09:51,480
soft Gotham in the dark.
Knight rises.

147
00:09:51,540 --> 00:09:54,760
This is build upon.
We know that Beth man lost better for

148
00:09:54,761 --> 00:09:59,190
Gotham sold because it's Yoka turned
hockey dance and that's a piece in

149
00:09:59,191 --> 00:10:04,110
Godson is built upon the lie,
which Miranda through Bain exposes in

150
00:10:04,111 --> 00:10:06,340
the dark nights,
Bruce Chooses Rachel A.

151
00:10:06,340 --> 00:10:08,500
Ball off.
Harvey Dent who represents hopeful

152
00:10:08,550 --> 00:10:10,470
Gotham,
but she's still dice.

153
00:10:11,030 --> 00:10:13,830
All right.
Listen some

154
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:17,850
me,
Rhonda as a villain,

155
00:10:17,860 --> 00:10:19,020
dust users,
bruises,

156
00:10:19,021 --> 00:10:20,850
weakest points,
his loneliness,

157
00:10:20,851 --> 00:10:23,580
his heartbreak,
and his desire to love a woman.

158
00:10:23,930 --> 00:10:24,691
Now,
Miranda,

159
00:10:24,691 --> 00:10:28,740
his true identity is of course carefully
hidden and therefore the central team of

160
00:10:28,750 --> 00:10:31,080
bruises,
psychological battle is as well.

161
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:32,670
Yes,
upon rewatching the film,

162
00:10:32,671 --> 00:10:36,480
the information is always there.
Offer plays an interesting role in this

163
00:10:36,540 --> 00:10:38,430
by stating his hope that bruce will
leave,

164
00:10:38,431 --> 00:10:41,670
gotten Beth and his boss behaves to find
happiness.

165
00:10:41,671 --> 00:10:44,360
He creates focus on the two central team
of Boucher.

166
00:10:44,390 --> 00:10:45,600
Psychological journey.

167
00:10:45,810 --> 00:10:48,720
I'll never one need you to come back to
Gotham.

168
00:10:50,490 --> 00:10:52,500
I waste no,
there was nothing here for you.

169
00:10:52,950 --> 00:10:57,420
Pain and tragedy and I wanted something
more for you to know.

170
00:10:58,260 --> 00:11:00,450
Yeah.
It's by explaining pain as a dangerous

171
00:11:00,451 --> 00:11:04,320
villain to bruce offered helps tricking.
The fewer into not seeing the two

172
00:11:04,321 --> 00:11:05,580
villain is Miranda

173
00:11:06,490 --> 00:11:11,470
who's a member of the League of shadows
and then he was actually indicating any

174
00:11:11,471 --> 00:11:13,820
man who is too extreme.
The ratio.

175
00:11:15,010 --> 00:11:18,310
There's not that the,
I didn't realize I was known for

176
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:23,400
trifling criminals.
That was Zane and you could just strap

177
00:11:23,491 --> 00:11:25,540
up your leg and put your mask back on.

178
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:30,650
Oh,
Fred is the moral center of the trilogy,

179
00:11:30,710 --> 00:11:33,680
the Voice of Wisdom.
And especially when in the dark nights

180
00:11:33,681 --> 00:11:36,570
he so beautifully explained,
well it makes a joker tick.

181
00:11:36,740 --> 00:11:41,740
Some men just want to wash the world,
but when he explains why Bain is so

182
00:11:42,171 --> 00:11:43,940
dangerous,
we fully believe him.

183
00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:47,180
Even when we see Miranda suggests a fee
using mosques.

184
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:50,360
Ethan when the camera focuses on the
scar on her back there,

185
00:11:50,361 --> 00:11:53,860
she got from the League of shadows and
Ethan will be clear to see that the

186
00:11:53,861 --> 00:11:58,150
child or the escapes is a girl that even
some of looks like Miranda and doesn't

187
00:11:58,151 --> 00:12:01,480
have to suppose scars,
Death Bain receives in the pit because

188
00:12:01,481 --> 00:12:03,610
we believe all threats.
We do not see it.

189
00:12:04,060 --> 00:12:05,650
Yeah.
To information is there.

190
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:09,500
The thematic resolution of the dark
knight rises isn't Batman Wins.

191
00:12:09,501 --> 00:12:14,140
Spain loses this conservatism wins
occupy losers because Bain isn't the

192
00:12:14,141 --> 00:12:17,230
coal antagonist of the film and if you
don't see this,

193
00:12:17,231 --> 00:12:20,950
then we also missed the importance of
the second twist of the film where we

194
00:12:20,951 --> 00:12:22,990
find out that that man is not death
birth,

195
00:12:22,991 --> 00:12:26,350
indeed the life and that he did truly
leave behind the Batman,

196
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:28,540
Gotham and bane of his past.

197
00:12:29,060 --> 00:12:33,340
The dark knight rises is not about a
fiscally broken Beth man that rises out

198
00:12:33,341 --> 00:12:37,030
of the pit through defeat Bain.
It's about Bruce Wayne who rises out of

199
00:12:37,031 --> 00:12:40,150
his psychological pain to leave the
death of his parents.

200
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:43,030
Rachel,
the city of Carson and his persona as

201
00:12:43,031 --> 00:12:44,830
Batman truly behind.

202
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:17,060
Thank you all so much for watching.
So first of all,

203
00:13:17,061 --> 00:13:19,490
thanks to scholar Benjamin and winter
halter,

204
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:21,800
whose paper,
while some main inspiration for this

205
00:13:21,801 --> 00:13:26,540
video and also two lessons from the
screenplay who gave me the ID to explore

206
00:13:26,541 --> 00:13:28,600
the last installment of the Dark Knight
Trilogy.

207
00:13:28,610 --> 00:13:30,590
Further,
it's going to be the joker,

208
00:13:30,591 --> 00:13:34,100
but there are certainly an important
deeper theme in the last film death

209
00:13:34,101 --> 00:13:37,970
closest Bruce's journey.

you can support us on Patrion tomorrow

211
00:13:42,591 --> 00:13:44,930
for patrons.
I will do another video where I talked

212
00:13:44,931 --> 00:13:47,660
loosely about the film as my essay.
I will,

213
00:13:47,661 --> 00:13:50,360
for example,
explore other symbolic gestures and

214
00:13:50,361 --> 00:13:53,930
explain why so many pundits and
reviewers didn't see the underlying

215
00:13:53,931 --> 00:13:56,590
central team,
but instead focused on the supposed

216
00:13:56,591 --> 00:14:00,170
political arc of better than the first
has been for everyone else.

217
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:01,370
See you next time.
