1
00:00:00,070 --> 00:00:03,380
I'm sure that you've heard that a plane
crashed and Coil Berry

2
00:00:06,110 --> 00:00:06,943
kill

3
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:20,090
early 21st century

4
00:00:21,010 --> 00:00:22,980
today,
our fellow citizens,

5
00:00:23,580 --> 00:00:28,110
our way of life,
our very freedom came under attack in a

6
00:00:28,111 --> 00:00:31,500
series of deliberate and deadly
terrorist acts.

7
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:35,100
The attacks on nine 11 not only shook up
in nation,

8
00:00:35,430 --> 00:00:39,150
but they woke the entire world from a
decade of relative tranquility.

9
00:00:39,210 --> 00:00:43,500
After the end of the Cold War,
the data towers fell would mark the

10
00:00:43,501 --> 00:00:46,920
beginning of a political scientist,
Samuel Huntington coin,

11
00:00:47,220 --> 00:00:50,850
the clash of civilizations,
the West versus the rest.

12
00:00:51,210 --> 00:00:54,000
Now what are you resonate with?
This concept is up to you,

13
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:59,480
but he most certainly did.
Either you're with us where you are with

14
00:01:00,061 --> 00:01:00,960
the terrorists

15
00:01:02,330 --> 00:01:06,080
and in the war against terror.
It's this frame of mind that will

16
00:01:06,170 --> 00:01:10,130
reaffirm American identity and its role
in the world dramatically.

17
00:01:22,780 --> 00:01:27,780
So I think the 2004 puppet sets higher
team America will police does a great

18
00:01:27,971 --> 00:01:31,660
job in depicting this proposed American
view of the war on terror.

19
00:01:31,990 --> 00:01:35,650
The story is about Acthar and spy and
Gary Johnson and his counter terrorism

20
00:01:35,651 --> 00:01:38,140
team as they take on terrorists
worldwide wide.

21
00:01:38,141 --> 00:01:41,230
And ultimately you have to confront the
biggest terrorist of all the late

22
00:01:41,231 --> 00:01:43,210
dictator of North Korea.
Kim Young,

23
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:46,180
ill professional,
James Gow argues that the film reflects

24
00:01:46,181 --> 00:01:50,170
the of this realists interpretation of
international relations.

25
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:53,440
Now what does that mean?
Constructivism is basically to clean.

26
00:01:53,441 --> 00:01:57,130
That's significant aspects of
international relations are historically

27
00:01:57,131 --> 00:02:00,640
and socially constructed and not the
consequence of human nature.

28
00:02:01,330 --> 00:02:04,060
Realism on the other hand,
can be thought of as unified by the

29
00:02:04,061 --> 00:02:08,620
belief that rural politics ultimately is
always and necessarily a field of

30
00:02:08,621 --> 00:02:11,920
conflict among actors pursuing power.
Now if you're thinking,

31
00:02:11,980 --> 00:02:13,990
I don't understand this at all,
don't worry,

32
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:16,870
the film was a brilliant job in
explaining the basic gist of it.

33
00:02:17,030 --> 00:02:19,860
There are three kinds of people,
Dick Pussy,

34
00:02:21,660 --> 00:02:24,060
pussy take,
everyone can get along and takes,

35
00:02:24,070 --> 00:02:26,650
just want to fuck all the time without
thinking it through.

36
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:30,610
But then you got your ass check and all
the assholes.

37
00:02:30,611 --> 00:02:32,500
One got shit all over everything.

38
00:02:33,700 --> 00:02:38,140
So does a little bar room wisdom about
sexual relations actually turns out to

39
00:02:38,141 --> 00:02:42,520
be the most important scene of the movie
as it's ultimately what saves humanity

40
00:02:42,521 --> 00:02:46,270
from nuclear annihilation.
The more importantly it lays bare to

41
00:02:46,271 --> 00:02:47,920
films,
philosophical core,

42
00:02:48,370 --> 00:02:51,220
the decks in the old man's story,
our team America,

43
00:02:51,340 --> 00:02:53,920
and an effect.
Everyone who acknowledges and support as

44
00:02:53,921 --> 00:02:57,040
America's assumed real life role as
beliefs force of the world.

45
00:02:59,540 --> 00:03:03,430
The all American white and blonde team
represents the hyperbole of patriotism,

46
00:03:03,850 --> 00:03:07,060
dressed in American flag combat gear,
and moving around in a similar style

47
00:03:07,090 --> 00:03:09,430
vehicles.
The team operates all over the globe

48
00:03:09,431 --> 00:03:12,400
with a well known American bravado when
the sense of optimism,

49
00:03:12,670 --> 00:03:14,550
their self confidence in their rule as
self,

50
00:03:14,551 --> 00:03:17,710
a clean police of the world.
There's also their main weakness.

51
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:21,220
Although the team is effective in
stopping terrorists around the globe and

52
00:03:21,221 --> 00:03:24,730
it's often crude and clumsy methods,
they end up doing more damage than the

53
00:03:24,731 --> 00:03:25,990
terrorists themselves.

54
00:03:26,140 --> 00:03:31,140
[inaudible]

55
00:03:44,330 --> 00:03:45,163
Damn,
I missed him,

56
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:48,200
but it would be false to say that the
movie is enzyme American.

57
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:50,620
On the contrary,
you to characters who publicly opposed

58
00:03:50,621 --> 00:03:54,740
to team notably to members of the film
actors guild or arguably made fun of the

59
00:03:54,741 --> 00:03:59,210
most met
the members of fag or the policies of

60
00:03:59,211 --> 00:04:01,040
the word.
They don't believe that violence will

61
00:04:01,041 --> 00:04:04,850
sub terrorism and don't want America to
act as a police force of the world.

62
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:06,980
However,
as the old man pointed out,

63
00:04:07,100 --> 00:04:10,310
who sees our only one and a half inches
away from the assholes,

64
00:04:10,430 --> 00:04:13,220
and indeed in a criticism of team
America,

65
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:16,400
the actress slowly started to turn into
terrorists themselves.

66
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:24,690
The hassles of the movie art a
terrorists and Kim Jung,

67
00:04:24,750 --> 00:04:26,730
Il,
they don't care about anything but the

68
00:04:26,731 --> 00:04:29,610
destruction of modern civilization.
And all of these characters are

69
00:04:29,611 --> 00:04:33,270
portrayed and overtly stereotypical way.
In a Alaria segment,

70
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:36,420
the team give Gary and quote unquote
elaborate makeover.

71
00:04:36,510 --> 00:04:39,960
So blend in with the terrorists.
Now you would expect to see a new person

72
00:04:39,961 --> 00:04:42,630
as he comes out of the surgery,
but instead he returns with some brown

73
00:04:42,631 --> 00:04:46,380
paint on the skin and pubic hair on its
face and its whole resembling a turban

74
00:04:46,410 --> 00:04:49,080
on his head.
The joke reaches its climax is gary has

75
00:04:49,081 --> 00:04:51,690
to pass to Garza without raising any
suspicions.

76
00:04:53,310 --> 00:04:54,270
Buck,
Dirk,

77
00:04:54,271 --> 00:04:55,170
dirk or la?

78
00:04:57,140 --> 00:04:57,430
Okay.

79
00:04:57,430 --> 00:04:59,770
Durka Durka Mohammed Jihad.

80
00:05:00,030 --> 00:05:00,863
Yeah.

81
00:05:01,370 --> 00:05:02,151
Oh,
darker.

82
00:05:02,151 --> 00:05:02,984
Darker,
darker

83
00:05:04,470 --> 00:05:06,200
in North Korea.
Kim Jung.

84
00:05:06,201 --> 00:05:10,130
Il speaks broken English and lives in
the city of Chinese takeout boxes.

85
00:05:10,740 --> 00:05:11,720
Wait,
a round ring.

86
00:05:13,260 --> 00:05:16,640
Oh Man.
All of this reinforces the

87
00:05:16,641 --> 00:05:20,180
constructivism president in the film.
The way the world is portrayed as the

88
00:05:20,181 --> 00:05:24,350
way America chooses to perceive it,
and it's this red or naive view that

89
00:05:24,351 --> 00:05:27,320
causes the team to have so many enemies.
However,

90
00:05:27,350 --> 00:05:30,440
Gary does realize in the end and chooses
to come to terms with it.

91
00:05:30,740 --> 00:05:34,250
Maca can definitely do better in their
role as world police,

92
00:05:34,550 --> 00:05:38,380
but they're constructivist.
Realist view does triumph and although

93
00:05:38,381 --> 00:05:41,900
the actors don't wish to accept this day
to ultimately see violence,

94
00:05:41,901 --> 00:05:43,910
it's the only means to protect her own
values.

95
00:05:43,970 --> 00:05:47,720
We can't look weak and powerless.
If violence is all those bastards

96
00:05:47,721 --> 00:05:50,650
understand that violence they'll get.
So despite all the heat,

97
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:52,900
you American managers to dismantle a
cumulus,

98
00:05:52,910 --> 00:05:55,400
devious plan and save humanity from
certain night.

99
00:05:55,401 --> 00:06:00,200
Elation as philosopher and Admin Berg
once famously stated you only thing

100
00:06:00,201 --> 00:06:03,530
necessary for the triumph of evil is for
good men to do nothing.

101
00:06:04,190 --> 00:06:05,590
Or as the movie like suits explain it.

102
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:08,660
I don't know much in this crazy,
crazy world,

103
00:06:09,740 --> 00:06:14,240
but I do know that if you don't let us
fuck this asshole,

104
00:06:15,650 --> 00:06:18,290
we're going to have our dicks and are
pussies

105
00:06:19,310 --> 00:06:23,480
all covered in shit.
It's this sense of pragmatic realism

106
00:06:23,481 --> 00:06:26,210
that writer and director,
Trey Parker and Matt Stone are trying to

107
00:06:26,211 --> 00:06:26,891
convey.
It's you.

108
00:06:26,891 --> 00:06:30,230
America won't beliefs and quiet.
Paradoxically it seems that's the

109
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:33,920
America's goal to prevent and destroyed
terrorism all around the globe will

110
00:06:33,921 --> 00:06:36,530
never be finished.
Their view of the world means that there

111
00:06:36,531 --> 00:06:39,590
will always be a new terrorist in new
enemy to fight.

112
00:06:39,980 --> 00:06:43,460
And so far to the theory seems to have
rung true in real life as well.

113
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:47,270
But in the NTU America doesn't really
care about what do you think their dicks

114
00:06:47,330 --> 00:06:49,040
and as long as there's assholes in the
world,

115
00:06:49,140 --> 00:06:52,520
it's all be Dick's willing to fuck them
again and again.

116
00:06:55,650 --> 00:06:56,483
Okay.

117
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:58,850
All right guys,
thanks for watching.

118
00:06:58,851 --> 00:07:01,460
I hope you enjoyed the video.
There's a couple of things that I

119
00:07:01,461 --> 00:07:03,170
quickly want to talk about.
Uh,

120
00:07:03,171 --> 00:07:04,760
so first off,
as I'm recording this,

121
00:07:04,761 --> 00:07:08,810
we've just surpassed 2000 subscribers
and we honestly couldn't be happier with

122
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:10,940
how things have developed over the last
couple of weeks.

123
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:11,871
Uh,
we never fought.

124
00:07:11,871 --> 00:07:15,590
We gain so many followers in this short
amount of time and we want to thank you

125
00:07:15,591 --> 00:07:18,380
all so much for supporting us and
spreading the word.

126
00:07:18,770 --> 00:07:19,850
It's,
it's good stuff.

127
00:07:19,940 --> 00:07:21,470
Now,
a lot of you have been giving us

128
00:07:21,471 --> 00:07:23,510
constructive feedback on their work so
far.

129
00:07:23,930 --> 00:07:26,030
Uh,
it's mostly people saying that we sound

130
00:07:26,090 --> 00:07:28,670
a lot like the nerd writer did that we
want to say that.

131
00:07:28,671 --> 00:07:31,220
Yes,
we do to an extent and honestly,

132
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:33,410
uh,
I don't actively try to do so.

133
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:37,250
I think it's mostly unconscious and just
the way that I personally like to do my

134
00:07:37,251 --> 00:07:38,530
voiceover,
uh,

135
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:41,360
I think set that we're both trying to
move away from that a little bit and I

136
00:07:41,361 --> 00:07:45,440
believe with time our own personal voice
will start to shine through more and

137
00:07:45,441 --> 00:07:46,820
more.
Secondly,

138
00:07:46,821 --> 00:07:49,520
you've tried turning down the volume on
the background music a little bit,

139
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:51,950
so I believe that shouldn't be an issue
anymore.

140
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:53,930
Thanks for pointing it out to us.
Finally,

141
00:07:53,931 --> 00:07:58,460
I want to invite all of you to follow us
on twitter and facebook as we will be

142
00:07:58,461 --> 00:08:01,280
posting updates on our channel and media
related stuff.

143
00:08:01,340 --> 00:08:03,380
So if you want to stay up to date,
definitely check that out.

144
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:05,930
That's about it.
Thanks again for watching and see you

145
00:08:05,931 --> 00:08:07,190
guys in the next one.
