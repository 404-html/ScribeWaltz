1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,290
Alright,
so before we begin,

2
00:00:01,291 --> 00:00:04,800
I want to say to the video that you're
about to watch is one of our additional

3
00:00:04,801 --> 00:00:06,400
commentary videos,
uh,

4
00:00:06,430 --> 00:00:08,640
they're very low key on the editing
side,

5
00:00:08,641 --> 00:00:12,630
so don't expect anything too fancy.
And they were basically just meant to

6
00:00:12,631 --> 00:00:17,631
add some things or respond to comments
about the original video essay in the

7
00:00:17,941 --> 00:00:20,430
past.
We made these for our patrons only,

8
00:00:20,431 --> 00:00:23,100
but from now on,
these additional commentary that will be

9
00:00:23,101 --> 00:00:26,550
posted on our second channel,
which is called the storytellers

10
00:00:26,551 --> 00:00:29,010
podcasts.
The link for that is in the description.

11
00:00:30,010 --> 00:00:33,810
This is because we're working on a
complete patron and channel makeover,

12
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:37,200
which we're really excited about.
We're working together with a graphic

13
00:00:37,201 --> 00:00:41,970
designer to help us build a or make a
better banner,

14
00:00:41,971 --> 00:00:42,900
more professional,
better,

15
00:00:42,901 --> 00:00:44,470
and it's looking really good.
So I,

16
00:00:44,471 --> 00:00:47,720
I hope it will be up in a couple of
weeks probably.

17
00:00:47,810 --> 00:00:48,720
Um,
and yeah,

18
00:00:48,721 --> 00:00:50,030
we're really excited about it.
Uh,

19
00:00:50,070 --> 00:00:52,410
so our patrons will still get a better
deal of course.

20
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:54,140
Uh,
so from where in front of that checkout,

21
00:00:54,150 --> 00:00:56,280
my comment on this video,
also,

22
00:00:56,281 --> 00:00:57,900
one last note,
I've been seeing a number of people

23
00:00:57,901 --> 00:01:02,580
getting offended by my criticism of high
profile liberal audiences mostly,

24
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:04,920
uh,
although I do not explicitly mentioned

25
00:01:04,921 --> 00:01:09,921
that I'm as much criticizing dose people
as I am the neoconservatives who saw it

26
00:01:10,261 --> 00:01:13,440
as praising the Iraq war.
I'm just trying to provide a,

27
00:01:13,510 --> 00:01:16,290
a new way of looking at the film.
You don't have to agree with me.

28
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:19,020
Um,
I was just trying to show a structural

29
00:01:19,021 --> 00:01:21,150
message of the film in an objective
manner,

30
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:24,440
uh,
or at least as objective as possible.

31
00:01:24,830 --> 00:01:26,240
Anyways,
enjoy guys.

32
00:01:26,690 --> 00:01:28,040
Alright.
Hello everyone.

33
00:01:28,041 --> 00:01:29,830
So three days ago,
uh,

34
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:34,190
I uploaded my American sniper video and
in the meantime we've got a lot of

35
00:01:34,191 --> 00:01:37,160
comments,
questions and criticisms and now I

36
00:01:37,161 --> 00:01:41,510
wanted to make this video to answer and
talk about some of the top comments that

37
00:01:41,511 --> 00:01:45,260
we got and that touch on some important
and the most talked about points.

38
00:01:45,570 --> 00:01:47,480
Uh,
but before I get into any of that,

39
00:01:47,481 --> 00:01:50,810
I want to promote the thesis that I use
for this analysis.

40
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:54,290
And now just just that I use is called
terministic screens and partisan

41
00:01:54,291 --> 00:01:57,670
audiences,
a birkin cluster analysis of Clint

42
00:01:57,670 --> 00:02:00,140
Eastwood's American sniper by Daniel K
dot Mervin.

43
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:04,400
Now he uses the same cluster analysis
method of the sickening to film,

44
00:02:04,700 --> 00:02:08,600
but takes it a step further by combining
it with liberal and conservative

45
00:02:08,870 --> 00:02:13,100
terministic screens or in other words,
the weight at both of those groups look

46
00:02:13,101 --> 00:02:15,800
at the world and which terms they
resonate with.

47
00:02:16,250 --> 00:02:18,710
Um,
and he uses both of these things to

48
00:02:18,711 --> 00:02:22,280
examine how either of the parties
interpreted the film food our own

49
00:02:22,281 --> 00:02:24,950
political screen or misinterpreted,
if you will.

50
00:02:25,740 --> 00:02:28,010
You can pause it here if you want to
read it a little bit.

51
00:02:28,011 --> 00:02:28,570
But yeah,
it's,

52
00:02:28,570 --> 00:02:32,360
it's a fairly thought provoking fingers,
a lot of truth in it.

53
00:02:32,770 --> 00:02:34,640
Uh,
it's available for free online.

54
00:02:34,850 --> 00:02:36,290
Uh,
I'll try to add a link in the

55
00:02:36,291 --> 00:02:39,280
description in the description so you
can check it out if you're interested.

56
00:02:39,690 --> 00:02:40,131
Uh,
yeah.

57
00:02:40,131 --> 00:02:42,770
So yeah,
I mainly use a cluster analysis method

58
00:02:42,771 --> 00:02:46,940
combined with some of his own findings
for my own video,

59
00:02:47,350 --> 00:02:50,060
um,
as it's a great tool to discern the main

60
00:02:50,061 --> 00:02:52,670
themes of a film,
texts objectively,

61
00:02:53,110 --> 00:02:56,620
and to see how to subordinate terms
change value throughout.

62
00:02:57,290 --> 00:02:58,940
All right,
so without further ado,

63
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:02,710
let's go onto some of the comments.
And the first one is by Ellis.

64
00:03:02,711 --> 00:03:03,544
Oh,
oh,

65
00:03:03,550 --> 00:03:04,271
interesting.
Take on.

66
00:03:04,271 --> 00:03:06,190
The film didn't realize it got so much
hate.

67
00:03:06,220 --> 00:03:10,490
You enter into a difficult area though
when labeling American sniper as anti

68
00:03:10,491 --> 00:03:12,730
war,
which I don't think is necessarily

69
00:03:12,731 --> 00:03:15,040
defined by showing the destructiveness
of war,

70
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:19,360
but rather by to what extent the
destruction can be justified in the end

71
00:03:20,260 --> 00:03:21,210
as we're American sniper.

72
00:03:21,220 --> 00:03:25,330
The fact that he did get his bad guy at
the end and got a big funeral parade and

73
00:03:25,331 --> 00:03:26,830
hero status.
Granted,

74
00:03:26,831 --> 00:03:30,700
not by everyone but still to me shows
that this is far from an antiwar film.

75
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,060
I'm pretty sure there are plenty of
folks out there who look at a film like

76
00:03:34,061 --> 00:03:36,370
this and think it was all worth it.
Okay.

77
00:03:36,371 --> 00:03:40,630
So I believe this touches on what now
you see it has said in this video about

78
00:03:40,630 --> 00:03:42,190
war films,
if you don't know him,

79
00:03:42,191 --> 00:03:44,500
he's a,
another video ses who,

80
00:03:44,850 --> 00:03:45,960
uh,
is actually fairly,

81
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,220
fairly popular and makes a lot of great
video.

82
00:03:48,221 --> 00:03:49,054
So,
uh,

83
00:03:49,100 --> 00:03:52,090
I'll put a link to that video in the
description as well.

84
00:03:52,420 --> 00:03:54,430
Basically,
his statement is that a film can be

85
00:03:54,431 --> 00:03:58,180
defined as a pro war film if the
benefits outweigh the costs of the war,

86
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:01,720
which he states is a thing that American
sniper shows.

87
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:06,250
So although I agree with the observation
of what a pro war film is,

88
00:04:06,251 --> 00:04:09,250
I don't believe it fully applies to
American sniper.

89
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:13,690
So as I've shown in my video,
the three pillars of Kyle's thinking or

90
00:04:13,691 --> 00:04:17,530
shown to be completely destructive to
family and in some ways even as military

91
00:04:17,531 --> 00:04:19,360
family as it gets to have his friends
skilled.

92
00:04:19,361 --> 00:04:22,810
So never do we see any progress in the
Iraq war as well.

93
00:04:23,110 --> 00:04:25,180
Instead,
things seem to be escalating and getting

94
00:04:25,181 --> 00:04:28,330
worse every time.
Call Kyle comes back.

95
00:04:28,730 --> 00:04:30,340
Um,
and then in the last battle,

96
00:04:30,341 --> 00:04:33,400
we see that even after he wants to
protect his family,

97
00:04:33,401 --> 00:04:36,850
he's still putting himself and other
soldiers in danger.

98
00:04:37,650 --> 00:04:39,250
Now,
I am going to agree with the fact that

99
00:04:39,251 --> 00:04:41,860
there should've been more of a negative
consequence for him,

100
00:04:41,861 --> 00:04:46,030
especially in that last scene which
could have been shown in one of the

101
00:04:46,031 --> 00:04:49,660
other soldiers getting killed or maimed,
but I'll get back to that in a little

102
00:04:49,661 --> 00:04:50,410
bit.

103
00:04:50,410 --> 00:04:53,140
Overall,
I believe that if American sniper war to

104
00:04:53,141 --> 00:04:58,120
be a heavily pro war film showing the
benefits outweighing the costs,

105
00:04:58,140 --> 00:05:02,680
the values that cow carries with him,
which are those highly conservative or

106
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:06,280
more like neoconservative values,
would definitely not have been depicted

107
00:05:06,281 --> 00:05:09,610
to be so detrimental to family in every
shape and form.

108
00:05:10,030 --> 00:05:12,490
Instead,
those values would have been shown to be

109
00:05:12,491 --> 00:05:16,030
positive and effective in in school and
not entirely flawed.

110
00:05:16,460 --> 00:05:18,120
Also,
I don't believe that the film was pro

111
00:05:18,121 --> 00:05:22,090
war just for portraying someone who
personally was a belief that there isn't

112
00:05:22,510 --> 00:05:24,760
really any benefit over costs in the
film.

113
00:05:24,761 --> 00:05:28,180
We just see to work costing more and
more with less and less benefit.

114
00:05:28,510 --> 00:05:30,460
If we see benefit at all,
in the end,

115
00:05:30,461 --> 00:05:34,330
he dies that the war is and resolve.
The families are still being destroyed

116
00:05:34,410 --> 00:05:38,170
and tries to depict as dogmatic beliefs
the destructiveness of said beliefs and

117
00:05:38,171 --> 00:05:41,710
shows them to be more of a tragic,
a flawed character.

118
00:05:42,340 --> 00:05:44,170
In my opinion.
It is,

119
00:05:44,171 --> 00:05:46,540
however,
still respectful to his intentions as a

120
00:05:46,541 --> 00:05:49,570
person,
which brings us to to portrayal of Chris

121
00:05:49,570 --> 00:05:52,510
Kyle and also our second common by
before the credits.

122
00:05:52,870 --> 00:05:54,880
I would agree with you.
It wasn't for a few things.

123
00:05:54,881 --> 00:05:57,560
I see you mentioned this isn't about
kyle himself,

124
00:05:57,561 --> 00:06:01,910
but he who he was as a real person plays
a part in what the movie became.

125
00:06:02,210 --> 00:06:04,610
It seems he just wasn't a good person at
all.

126
00:06:04,611 --> 00:06:07,160
He lied a lot and it seems to love more
himself,

127
00:06:07,190 --> 00:06:10,880
which isn't shown in a movie that played
a role with the people who watching the

128
00:06:10,881 --> 00:06:13,520
movie dead look more into them.
All right,

129
00:06:13,521 --> 00:06:17,780
so this touches on a part of the films
criticism that I believe hold some

130
00:06:17,781 --> 00:06:21,170
truth.
Clint Eastwood is very obviously careful

131
00:06:21,171 --> 00:06:23,990
to not portray cow as a person in a
negative light,

132
00:06:24,460 --> 00:06:28,610
and as Bradley Cooper has stated,
the film actively tries to put emphasis

133
00:06:28,611 --> 00:06:31,400
on veterans and honors their plight in
the process.

134
00:06:32,110 --> 00:06:35,540
Now,
I think the certain Lakin nuanced depth

135
00:06:35,541 --> 00:06:38,840
and Kyle's character makes that some of
the antiwar elements might've become

136
00:06:38,841 --> 00:06:41,240
overshadowed and angry if that,
um,

137
00:06:41,950 --> 00:06:44,360
I've only read a little bit about the
controversy surrounding him,

138
00:06:44,361 --> 00:06:47,750
so I don't know how much of it is true
or whether this was known to,

139
00:06:47,751 --> 00:06:51,260
to filmmakers are in production.
But what I do know to be true is that

140
00:06:51,261 --> 00:06:54,140
Carl has stated in his autobiography to
have enjoyed,

141
00:06:54,470 --> 00:06:56,930
to have enjoyed killing people in Iraq,
which is,

142
00:06:56,980 --> 00:06:57,940
um,
uh,

143
00:06:58,330 --> 00:06:59,260
something that,
uh,

144
00:06:59,310 --> 00:07:01,300
before the credits touched on in his
comment.

145
00:07:01,700 --> 00:07:03,920
Um,
this is something that's only subtly

146
00:07:03,921 --> 00:07:05,240
hinted at the movie.
I think,

147
00:07:05,310 --> 00:07:06,250
uh,
uh,

148
00:07:06,420 --> 00:07:08,840
as you know,
you can see tyack questioning Kyle's

149
00:07:08,841 --> 00:07:10,080
real intentions,
uh,

150
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:13,300
as he wants to go back for a fourth time
because she doesn't believe that he's

151
00:07:13,310 --> 00:07:15,140
doing it to protect his family's
anymore.

152
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:17,330
But for other,
more personal reasons,

153
00:07:17,580 --> 00:07:19,670
uh,
but I think the film mainly explains

154
00:07:19,671 --> 00:07:22,730
isn't as obsession with killing the
people responsible for murdering his

155
00:07:22,731 --> 00:07:23,530
friends.

156
00:07:23,530 --> 00:07:26,500
Um,
so I would agree that the antiwar

157
00:07:26,510 --> 00:07:30,230
message would have been clear if this
would have been implemented,

158
00:07:30,620 --> 00:07:31,490
uh,
his,

159
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:35,960
his enjoyment of killing and would have
benefited the quality and the honesty of

160
00:07:35,961 --> 00:07:37,850
the film in general if,
if,

161
00:07:37,940 --> 00:07:40,370
if this aspect of college would have
been shown in the movie.

162
00:07:40,730 --> 00:07:41,920
But I do understand that,
you know,

163
00:07:42,030 --> 00:07:44,140
this would have probably never happened,
you know,

164
00:07:44,150 --> 00:07:46,310
even if Clint Eastwood would have wanted
to implement it,

165
00:07:46,340 --> 00:07:50,160
the guy had just been shot.
So I think they were extra careful in

166
00:07:50,161 --> 00:07:51,920
this portrayal.
And besides that,

167
00:07:51,921 --> 00:07:55,340
there's also the possibility that the
studio just wanted to play it safer for

168
00:07:55,341 --> 00:07:59,510
a big audience and that might have
opened the door for a more pro

169
00:07:59,511 --> 00:08:02,270
neoconservative viewing of the film.
Um,

170
00:08:02,690 --> 00:08:05,030
I mean,
this is not Francis Ford Coppola

171
00:08:05,060 --> 00:08:08,240
prancing around half naked in the
Philippine jungles and his own budget.

172
00:08:08,241 --> 00:08:13,241
So I doubt East we'd had complete
liberty in this unless someone can prove

173
00:08:13,281 --> 00:08:13,970
me wrong,
of course.

174
00:08:13,970 --> 00:08:16,460
But that brings us to a number of
questions.

175
00:08:16,850 --> 00:08:21,170
Does Clint Eastwood and directors of war
films in general hold a responsibility

176
00:08:21,171 --> 00:08:25,310
in the interpretation of their films?
So even if you personally wanted to make

177
00:08:25,311 --> 00:08:29,870
it predominantly anti war film,
I'm having part of the audience

178
00:08:29,871 --> 00:08:34,610
interpreted as a pro war film,
does that mean that it is his failure or

179
00:08:34,611 --> 00:08:38,840
failure on his part or is it a failure
on the audience's part to misinterpret

180
00:08:38,841 --> 00:08:41,620
the film?
Does that mean that we have to do away

181
00:08:41,670 --> 00:08:44,060
with subtlety when it comes to sensitive
topics,

182
00:08:44,061 --> 00:08:48,870
does that mean that we have to limit a
director's liberty and in,

183
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:51,250
in showing his own view,
uh,

184
00:08:51,350 --> 00:08:55,890
or to be political correct.
Politically correct in depicting of

185
00:08:55,891 --> 00:08:58,860
these sensitive topics?
Or is it to be found in the apparent,

186
00:08:58,890 --> 00:09:02,670
this honest portrayal of Chris Kyle,
even though it was only meant to be

187
00:09:02,671 --> 00:09:06,690
roughly based on his life,
are in bio pics in essence problematic

188
00:09:06,691 --> 00:09:09,300
when it comes to creating a fake
narrative around a real person?

189
00:09:09,570 --> 00:09:12,960
Or is it all just fiction and people
shouldn't learn history from fiction

190
00:09:12,961 --> 00:09:14,240
films.
Alright.

191
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:17,730
So those are some of the questions that
popped up for me and that could further

192
00:09:17,731 --> 00:09:20,910
the conversation in the comments section
because I want to know what you think

193
00:09:20,911 --> 00:09:24,020
about this personally and,
and what your views are a,

194
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:27,180
I think with that,
I've set most of what I intended to say

195
00:09:27,181 --> 00:09:31,280
and I hope I provided you have some
further context in ways to further the

196
00:09:31,310 --> 00:09:33,030
conversation.
Um,

197
00:09:33,090 --> 00:09:37,380
of course I appreciate constructively,
constructively post varying viewpoints

198
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:40,410
of which I'm looking forward to seeing
more in this common section.

199
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:42,030
Uh,
thank you all for watching.
