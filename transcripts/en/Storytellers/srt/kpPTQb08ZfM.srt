1
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:07,240
Sometimes there was a man,
he's the man for his time and place.

2
00:00:09,770 --> 00:00:14,770
He fits right in there and that's the
dude in Los Angeles and even if he's a

3
00:00:17,871 --> 00:00:22,871
lazy man and the dude was most certainly
that quite possibly the Las Vegas and

4
00:00:24,231 --> 00:00:28,880
Los Angeles County which would place him
high and are running for laziest

5
00:00:28,881 --> 00:00:32,990
worldwide,
but sometimes there's a man,

6
00:00:34,250 --> 00:00:36,830
sometimes there's a man.

7
00:00:43,870 --> 00:00:48,070
I think many would agree when I say that
the big Lebowski can easily be seen as

8
00:00:48,071 --> 00:00:52,120
one of the greatest cult classics off
our time to film that as inspire

9
00:00:52,121 --> 00:00:56,440
thousands of Halloween costumes,
so called Lebowski fest and even a

10
00:00:56,441 --> 00:01:01,090
religion must have received poorly upon
its original release in 1998.

11
00:01:01,510 --> 00:01:05,670
The film was described by critics as
fitbit and spacious.

12
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:09,760
It was only in the early two thousands
that the film started to get into mess

13
00:01:09,790 --> 00:01:13,570
following and appreciation that made it
the classic that it is today.

14
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:18,670
It such a steady increasing in
popularity is really intriguing.

15
00:01:18,850 --> 00:01:21,880
Scholars,
Paul Martin and fellow renegot argued

16
00:01:21,881 --> 00:01:26,470
that is jus to a period of economic and
social prosperity in America when the

17
00:01:26,471 --> 00:01:29,950
big Lebowski was released according to
them chew to this,

18
00:01:29,951 --> 00:01:34,030
many Americans weren't as perceptive to
the social critiques that the big

19
00:01:34,031 --> 00:01:36,500
Lebowski could offer.
This changed however,

20
00:01:36,510 --> 00:01:40,000
during the two thousands with impactful
events or 9:11,

21
00:01:40,060 --> 00:01:44,710
the bloody and problematic war in Iraq
and eventually the economic crash of

22
00:01:44,711 --> 00:01:48,010
2008.
Then the social and political critique

23
00:01:48,011 --> 00:01:52,480
of the Big Lebowski Fountain audience
and important critique that can be found

24
00:01:52,481 --> 00:01:54,940
in the big Lebowski starts in the
opening scene.

25
00:01:55,540 --> 00:01:59,380
The narrative makes a point of stating
the film takes place during the 1991

26
00:01:59,410 --> 00:02:02,950
Gulf War and that the dudes is just the
man for his time.

27
00:02:03,460 --> 00:02:07,690
The golf course was a time in American
politics where aggression most used as a

28
00:02:07,691 --> 00:02:09,160
means of conflict resolution.

29
00:02:09,230 --> 00:02:13,000
This will not stand.
This will not stand this aggression

30
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:14,610
against a Kuwait

31
00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:18,420
aggression as a means of conflict.
Resolution is a major theme in the movie

32
00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:22,260
everywhere around two dudes,
all the characters to violence and

33
00:02:22,261 --> 00:02:25,530
intimidation to resolve conflicts or
pursue their own interests.

34
00:02:27,910 --> 00:02:32,910
Fucking fascist
Lebowski,

35
00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:39,100
only the dude because he is of course a
pacifist.

36
00:02:39,450 --> 00:02:40,340
These guys,
you know,

37
00:02:40,470 --> 00:02:44,130
good like me.
There was a conscientious objector.

38
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:47,050
It is not a coincidence that the other
Lebowski,

39
00:02:47,051 --> 00:02:50,500
the millionaire who was quite willing to
use aggression and clearly is the

40
00:02:50,501 --> 00:02:55,390
personification of American capitalism.
Remarkably looks like the then Secretary

41
00:02:55,391 --> 00:02:56,890
of Defense,
Dick Cheney,

42
00:02:57,970 --> 00:03:00,790
however it is the dude's friend,
Walter,

43
00:03:00,820 --> 00:03:04,420
who embodies this American policy of
aggression during the Gulf War.

44
00:03:04,990 --> 00:03:07,150
I'm talking about drawing a line in the
sand.

45
00:03:07,151 --> 00:03:08,710
Dude,
across this line,

46
00:03:08,770 --> 00:03:11,910
you do not.
Melissa is constantly set off and users

47
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:14,650
aggression and intimidation to achieve
his goals.

48
00:03:16,530 --> 00:03:17,930
Just the whole world.
God crazy.

49
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:23,210
Am I the only one around here?
Just like Jen about the Ra market zero.

50
00:03:23,270 --> 00:03:26,070
They're calling the cops man.
Put the zero

51
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:31,670
piece of Walter fucking around Taro.

52
00:03:35,590 --> 00:03:39,940
He refers to the goal for when he
criticizes to dude for being a pacifist.

53
00:03:40,270 --> 00:03:43,330
You know that's your answer for
everything and we'll be putting out

54
00:03:43,331 --> 00:03:46,120
something.
Pacifism is not looking at our current

55
00:03:46,121 --> 00:03:48,220
situation with that camel.
Fuck her in a wreck.

56
00:03:48,490 --> 00:03:50,380
Pacifism is not something to hide
behind.

57
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:52,900
Just take it easy,
man.

58
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:56,980
I'm perfectly calm.
Do you could even argue that what he is

59
00:03:56,981 --> 00:04:01,480
yelling in this hilarious scene refers
to Iraq treatment of Kuwait and

60
00:04:01,510 --> 00:04:02,890
Americans reaction to this.

61
00:04:03,220 --> 00:04:05,160
Let's see what happens when he fucking
stranger

62
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:12,160
Larry Flurry,
flurry.

63
00:04:14,131 --> 00:04:16,420
When you fuck a stranger in the act,

64
00:04:16,630 --> 00:04:20,630
the film is clearly critical of this
means of conflict resolution and this of

65
00:04:20,631 --> 00:04:24,760
the American politics of starting the
Gulf war against Iraq because throughout

66
00:04:24,761 --> 00:04:27,640
the film,
and especially with regards to Walter

67
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:29,620
Section,
the violence only leads to further

68
00:04:29,621 --> 00:04:31,750
problems,
destruction of their own property,

69
00:04:31,780 --> 00:04:32,980
and even a death.

70
00:04:34,390 --> 00:04:36,320
God,
they shot him.

71
00:04:36,350 --> 00:04:39,880
There
weren't any shots fired.

72
00:04:40,820 --> 00:04:45,340
It's a heart attack
myself,

73
00:04:45,780 --> 00:04:47,090
but I'm pumping blood.
My pants

74
00:04:47,830 --> 00:04:51,080
well kind of course.
Imagine how such a political critique of

75
00:04:51,081 --> 00:04:54,830
American politics of progressions as a
means of conflict resolutions against

76
00:04:54,831 --> 00:04:59,420
Iraq gained popularity in the formations
early two thousands when the highly

77
00:04:59,421 --> 00:05:04,370
criticized second Iraq war started as
Martin and Renner Gar state to both

78
00:05:04,371 --> 00:05:08,780
subtle and explicit commentary.
The Big Lebowski challenges the values

79
00:05:08,781 --> 00:05:13,310
and the dominant national policies of 99
slash one America and celebrates the

80
00:05:13,311 --> 00:05:16,040
qualities of the Common Pacific cystic
citizen.

81
00:05:16,590 --> 00:05:19,340
Yet besides the political critique in
the big Lebowski,

82
00:05:19,341 --> 00:05:22,310
we can also find a broader critique or
society as a whole.

83
00:05:22,730 --> 00:05:26,240
I think that that is from this critique
that we can explain the cultural impact

84
00:05:26,241 --> 00:05:28,400
of the big Lebowski,
the Lebowski fest,

85
00:05:28,460 --> 00:05:32,390
and the religion of Judaism,
which basically preaches going with the

86
00:05:32,391 --> 00:05:36,140
flow and taking it easy.
Martin and renegot explained this to

87
00:05:36,141 --> 00:05:39,080
what they call the carnivalesque
qualities of the big Lebowski.

88
00:05:39,710 --> 00:05:42,110
The carnivalesque can be explained in
different ways,

89
00:05:42,111 --> 00:05:47,000
yet it comes down to a way of humor that
seeks to deconstruct and ridicule social

90
00:05:47,001 --> 00:05:48,230
norms,
hierarchies,

91
00:05:48,260 --> 00:05:50,090
and power,
six,

92
00:05:50,180 --> 00:05:53,900
to exposed to artificial construction or
society and makes fun of it.

93
00:05:54,470 --> 00:05:56,450
Now,
the two most important qualities that

94
00:05:56,451 --> 00:06:00,680
marked a kind arco desk realism and
reversal of hierarchies.

95
00:06:01,850 --> 00:06:06,850
Fucking grotesque realism means taking
down and ridiculing everything that is

96
00:06:08,001 --> 00:06:10,010
considered proper aunts.
Respectable.

97
00:06:10,380 --> 00:06:13,610
It is lowering everything that is
considered holy back to the three of

98
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:18,170
earth and body.
Examples of imagery that are a grotesque

99
00:06:18,171 --> 00:06:21,640
realism are images of bodily functions,
old and fat bodies,

100
00:06:21,641 --> 00:06:22,880
sex,
pregnancy,

101
00:06:22,881 --> 00:06:23,714
and preventing it.

102
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:29,320
Let me tell you something or you pull
any crazy shit with us.

103
00:06:29,570 --> 00:06:34,570
You flash a piece out on the lanes they
got away from you and stick it up your

104
00:06:35,031 --> 00:06:37,730
ass and pulled the fucking trigger.
Delayed goes,

105
00:06:40,690 --> 00:06:42,800
Jesus.
You said in mind,

106
00:06:43,790 --> 00:06:45,830
nobody fucks with Jesus

107
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:49,910
in the big Lebowski.
This starts,

108
00:06:49,911 --> 00:06:52,160
for example,
with the peeing on the rock and the car

109
00:06:52,161 --> 00:06:55,280
that smells like urine,
but it is also seen in a buddy's of the

110
00:06:55,281 --> 00:06:58,880
characters in the big Lebowski.
We don't see beautiful movie star

111
00:06:58,881 --> 00:07:00,040
buddies.
Instead,

112
00:07:00,050 --> 00:07:04,190
the camera focuses on overweight middle
age guys with beer bellies and food

113
00:07:04,191 --> 00:07:07,970
stains on my shirt.
It is to this humoristic focus on the

114
00:07:07,971 --> 00:07:10,940
lower above lead that the audience is
asked to look differently at it.

115
00:07:11,450 --> 00:07:12,560
Fucking interesting,
man.

116
00:07:12,590 --> 00:07:17,590
That's fucking interesting.
Grotesque realism can be seen and

117
00:07:17,641 --> 00:07:20,580
profanity and overtly sexual dialogue as
well.

118
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,880
This is used as a way to break through
social hierarchies.

119
00:07:24,390 --> 00:07:25,560
We can see this,
for example,

120
00:07:25,561 --> 00:07:28,200
in math,
who is very aware of how use of language

121
00:07:28,201 --> 00:07:31,320
can break through social convention and
create social power.

122
00:07:31,580 --> 00:07:34,140
My art has been commended as being
strongly vaginal,

123
00:07:34,170 --> 00:07:36,970
which bothers some men.
The word itself makes someone

124
00:07:36,990 --> 00:07:37,823
uncomfortable,

125
00:07:38,860 --> 00:07:41,010
but Jina oh yeah.

126
00:07:41,220 --> 00:07:42,660
Yes.
I don't like hearing it and find it

127
00:07:42,661 --> 00:07:45,730
difficult to say,
whereas without batting an eye man refer

128
00:07:45,731 --> 00:07:50,731
to his dick or his rod or his Johnson
Johnson,

129
00:07:51,610 --> 00:07:52,720
funnily enough,
however,

130
00:07:52,721 --> 00:07:55,960
since the dude is also very unconcerned
with social convention and

131
00:07:55,961 --> 00:07:59,080
respectability,
he is rather and faced a better example,

132
00:07:59,081 --> 00:08:02,380
therefore will be bunny.
She first becomes characterized as a

133
00:08:02,381 --> 00:08:06,370
trophy wife or for rich old millionaire.
A woman in her position is often

134
00:08:06,371 --> 00:08:10,150
expected to serve as elegant ICANDY and
it has a lack of social power,

135
00:08:10,540 --> 00:08:14,380
yet too overtly sexual dialogue.
She breaks to this convention,

136
00:08:14,410 --> 00:08:17,800
the social construction of what is
considered respectable behavior and

137
00:08:17,860 --> 00:08:19,480
gains in a way social power.

138
00:08:21,410 --> 00:08:26,410
Second Wonderful Woman

139
00:08:29,060 --> 00:08:29,920
Rah,
Rah,

140
00:08:29,921 --> 00:08:32,130
very fond of are very free spirited
brand.

141
00:08:32,170 --> 00:08:37,030
Can't watch that.
That's marvelous.

142
00:08:38,920 --> 00:08:42,640
This brings me to the second and most
important feature of the carnivalesque,

143
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:46,780
the inversion of social hierarchies.
This breaks down hierarchies in society,

144
00:08:46,781 --> 00:08:50,440
but I did the training of rulers and let
alone take their places.

145
00:08:51,130 --> 00:08:53,320
This way,
the audience has shown the artificial

146
00:08:53,321 --> 00:08:57,270
nature of these hierarchies and
encouraged to rethink such a system.

147
00:08:57,480 --> 00:09:00,180
We already see this in a dude as the
protagonist.

148
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:02,130
Instead of the typical American
handsome,

149
00:09:02,131 --> 00:09:05,700
capable of leading men hero,
we get a bathrobe and flip flops wearing

150
00:09:05,730 --> 00:09:09,420
bore bomb who stole to be possibly the
laziest man in the world.

151
00:09:09,540 --> 00:09:11,190
The man for his time and place.

152
00:09:11,630 --> 00:09:16,460
Yeah.
Just like your opinion,

153
00:09:16,461 --> 00:09:17,110
man.

154
00:09:17,110 --> 00:09:19,190
Yeah.
It's the other Lebowski who is referred

155
00:09:19,191 --> 00:09:23,390
to by the dude as the big Lebowski,
a successful millionaire at the top of

156
00:09:23,391 --> 00:09:28,391
the social ladder who gained his wealth
by supposedly a life part work turns out

157
00:09:28,431 --> 00:09:31,970
to be a total failure in business who
lives off an allowance from the trust of

158
00:09:31,971 --> 00:09:36,971
his deceased spouse and to refer back to
the relevance of the Gulf War and the

159
00:09:36,981 --> 00:09:38,950
dudes dream,
the supposedly fearful,

160
00:09:38,990 --> 00:09:42,230
powerful dictator.
Saddam Hussein is working as a bowling

161
00:09:42,231 --> 00:09:45,320
shoe attendant offering.
The dude that unique pair of silver and

162
00:09:45,321 --> 00:09:50,321
gold bowling shoes is reinforces to do
kidney position and show Saddam Hussein

163
00:09:50,361 --> 00:09:53,450
and the lowly status that's modern and
renegade states,

164
00:09:53,690 --> 00:09:56,900
so such inverted rows.
The audiences enabled to see social

165
00:09:56,901 --> 00:10:01,430
reality as a construct under this
encouraged to question it in the end.

166
00:10:01,490 --> 00:10:03,620
This is one of the key concepts of the
film.

167
00:10:03,830 --> 00:10:08,330
It puts us viewers to be aware of the
constructed nature of society and shows

168
00:10:08,331 --> 00:10:10,370
us we are not obliged to take part in
it.

169
00:10:11,060 --> 00:10:14,290
The dude is living a lifestyle
completely in opposition to Alice,

170
00:10:14,300 --> 00:10:18,710
respectfully seen as the American dream.
Yet he is content living by its own

171
00:10:18,711 --> 00:10:21,440
ethics and sense of purpose as he says.

172
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:22,353
Yeah.
Well,

173
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:30,810
the dude abides to construction nature
of society who doesn't conform to it.

174
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:33,990
Instead,
he's out there taking it easy for us all

175
00:10:34,290 --> 00:10:36,180
and invite us to do the same

176
00:10:39,690 --> 00:10:43,720
band song in Turkey or b days.

177
00:10:46,410 --> 00:10:48,270
All right.
Thanks so much for watching everyone.

178
00:10:48,690 --> 00:10:50,550
So it took a while to make this video.
Uh,

179
00:10:50,580 --> 00:10:54,410
I was very busy with my law specialist
subjects in the beginning of [inaudible]

180
00:10:54,510 --> 00:10:56,940
17.
We hope to start producing more videos

181
00:10:56,941 --> 00:10:59,580
more often.
There will be another video for it in

182
00:10:59,581 --> 00:11:01,860
the middle of December.
A good friend of us,

183
00:11:01,861 --> 00:11:05,520
one for patrons wanted to remain chair
that to never forget king's Day,

184
00:11:05,521 --> 00:11:06,900
2015.

185
00:11:06,940 --> 00:11:10,980

videos and get access to more content,
