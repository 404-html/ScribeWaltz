1
00:00:02,970 --> 00:00:06,200
So after having recently watched Black
Mirror,

2
00:00:06,201 --> 00:00:09,810
it struck me at the shows.
Most genuinely unsettling episodes don't

3
00:00:09,811 --> 00:00:13,050
just blatantly show a highly negative
dystopian future.

4
00:00:13,410 --> 00:00:17,250
Instead they take us for a ride and
reflect to us a vision of the future.

5
00:00:17,251 --> 00:00:20,130
Highly compatible with our own current
desires,

6
00:00:20,430 --> 00:00:23,850
the desires you capture,
share and hold onto the past.

7
00:00:24,070 --> 00:00:27,860
Because the way
in the entire history of you,

8
00:00:27,861 --> 00:00:32,010
this desire to hold onto our memories
has manifested itself in the grain.

9
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:36,270
A device connected to our signups is
that records everything your eyes see.

10
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:40,560
You can replay your recordings or your
reduce esther called at any given time,

11
00:00:40,561 --> 00:00:44,140
showed them to your friends and family
or hand them over to to forties when

12
00:00:44,150 --> 00:00:45,690
everyday.
So require you to,

13
00:00:45,850 --> 00:00:47,940
if you just really wanted me,
I lost 24 hours.

14
00:00:48,030 --> 00:00:51,570
The story makes it abundantly clear that
the widespread integration of the grain

15
00:00:51,571 --> 00:00:55,710
in society has enormous implications for
the privacy of its characters.

16
00:00:56,010 --> 00:00:59,140
That's the room that many respects
that's lost nearly all of its meaning in

17
00:00:59,141 --> 00:01:03,150
a since been replaced rather by his
sentiment that can roughly be described

18
00:01:03,151 --> 00:01:04,590
us.
Nothing to hide,

19
00:01:04,650 --> 00:01:07,020
nothing to fear.
We can see the implementation of this

20
00:01:07,021 --> 00:01:09,150
mindset right here and the airport
scene.

21
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:11,730
The big thing,
just how or rally and the government has

22
00:01:11,731 --> 00:01:15,780
become in favor of its own security,
but we also see it manifested in the

23
00:01:15,781 --> 00:01:19,050
workplace as Liam's law firm demands
access to their employees,

24
00:01:19,051 --> 00:01:21,510
reduce in order to ensure their
productivity,

25
00:01:21,511 --> 00:01:23,370
loyalty,
and security for the image of the

26
00:01:23,371 --> 00:01:25,440
company.
And although the implementation of the

27
00:01:25,441 --> 00:01:28,830
grain has not been made mandatory,
it's been highly normalized to the

28
00:01:28,831 --> 00:01:32,730
degree that grainless before stigmatized
as having something to hide and being

29
00:01:32,731 --> 00:01:37,731
degenerate,
which is in turn supported by the fact

30
00:01:38,911 --> 00:01:42,750
that police won't respond to calls for
help from grainless citizens and why

31
00:01:42,751 --> 00:01:45,660
it's is promoted as being cheaper than a
cup of coffee.

32
00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:49,410
It's a power structure that at first
glance seems to benefit the forces in

33
00:01:49,411 --> 00:01:51,910
positions of power.
Calling back to Jeremy Bentham,

34
00:01:51,930 --> 00:01:55,020
Scott set with the Panopticon,
which is a version of a rounded prison

35
00:01:55,021 --> 00:01:58,050
with a tower in the center in which a
guard could watch every individual

36
00:01:58,051 --> 00:02:01,080
prisoner at any time,
but the prisoners and dare turn could

37
00:02:01,081 --> 00:02:04,050
not see to guard and therefore would
never know whether they were being

38
00:02:04,051 --> 00:02:06,780
watched or not.
So if you're radically creating self

39
00:02:06,781 --> 00:02:11,010
disciplinary prisoners now to use this
concept as a metaphor in relation to our

40
00:02:11,011 --> 00:02:14,510
own society is as clear as day in
frankly somewhat on the nose.

41
00:02:14,690 --> 00:02:16,920
The big thing,
the dangers of unlimited surveillance

42
00:02:16,921 --> 00:02:21,060
and personal data mining and the lack of
balance between the watcher and watched

43
00:02:21,150 --> 00:02:22,830
the entire history of you,
however,

44
00:02:22,831 --> 00:02:27,060
shows in near future in which everyone
now effectively has inherited both those

45
00:02:27,061 --> 00:02:29,610
roles acting bove as a living,
breathing,

46
00:02:29,611 --> 00:02:32,260
CCTV camera,
your bitch.

47
00:02:32,730 --> 00:02:36,510
I'd like you to erase that as well as
the object passing through its frame.

48
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:40,350
Not gonna hit anything to freak us out.
How that they're not,

49
00:02:40,930 --> 00:02:43,290
there's no major deletions this quarter.
No,

50
00:02:43,291 --> 00:02:43,550
no,
no.

51
00:02:43,550 --> 00:02:47,050
Everything's a well within prophetess.
However,

52
00:02:47,070 --> 00:02:50,300
it would be a mistake to conclude that
the green is merely a product of some

53
00:02:50,301 --> 00:02:54,030
level in police state as it seems to be
more of a natural outcome of years upon

54
00:02:54,031 --> 00:02:58,680
years of increasingly sharing our
personal lives from taking selfies to

55
00:02:58,681 --> 00:03:02,200
the recording of concerts to
lifestreaming your life for the entire

56
00:03:02,201 --> 00:03:05,250
world.
To see there never was a need to make

57
00:03:05,270 --> 00:03:09,040
grain mandatory because who wouldn't
want to share and relive the good old

58
00:03:09,041 --> 00:03:12,880
times during a nice reunion dinner.
And this is read the entire history of

59
00:03:12,881 --> 00:03:17,460
you shines the most by refraining from
focusing on the more obvious and already

60
00:03:17,470 --> 00:03:21,550
broadly covered bigger picture and
instead minimizing its aim onto what

61
00:03:21,551 --> 00:03:25,270
interests us most,
the personal and the coziness of a warm

62
00:03:25,271 --> 00:03:28,990
lead lid living room it relatable scene
showing nuance and it's social

63
00:03:28,991 --> 00:03:33,991
commentary making us comfortable before
ultimately showing its true ugly face

64
00:03:36,130 --> 00:03:39,670
during this painfully horrific scene at
both the state of Lehman fees,

65
00:03:39,671 --> 00:03:43,480
marriage becomes obvious as well as the
way in which degree in synthetically he

66
00:03:43,481 --> 00:03:47,050
keeps both of them stuck in the past,
completely disconnected from their

67
00:03:47,051 --> 00:03:47,980
present selves.

68
00:03:48,010 --> 00:03:52,030
Liam chosen to be the main focus of the
story functions as a prime example of

69
00:03:52,031 --> 00:03:54,580
this obsession.
We seed in his role as a litigation

70
00:03:54,581 --> 00:03:59,440
lawyer dealing solely with redo cases,
but it's also noticeable in a slight but

71
00:03:59,441 --> 00:04:04,210
consistent social awkwardness seemingly
never being really present to the moment

72
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:08,470
using reduced to remember the name of
one of his wife's best friends because

73
00:04:08,471 --> 00:04:10,930
who needs an actual memory when you have
to grain.

74
00:04:11,290 --> 00:04:14,860
But where it's most evident is in is
mistrust of his wife's faithfulness.

75
00:04:15,100 --> 00:04:17,500
Starting from the moment he sees her
chatting with Jonas,

76
00:04:17,501 --> 00:04:20,500
he rapidly descends into a full blown
paranoia,

77
00:04:20,860 --> 00:04:24,100
effectively prosecuting his wife using
evidence from years ago.

78
00:04:25,970 --> 00:04:30,900
So when week or a month as lean tries to
drink away and perhaps indulge into

79
00:04:30,910 --> 00:04:32,860
pain,
has investigation is causing him.

80
00:04:32,861 --> 00:04:37,000
We noticed that this might very well be
his share behavior seen in friends,

81
00:04:37,001 --> 00:04:39,220
family,
and even the work environment.

82
00:04:39,580 --> 00:04:42,100
And it's really no wonder that the
indulgence of these mind numbing

83
00:04:42,101 --> 00:04:46,120
substances plays such a prevalent role
in the society as various mirror shots

84
00:04:46,121 --> 00:04:49,780
indicate how the grain has caused part
of Liam's personality to split,

85
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:52,600
to stay behind,
and they has been time,

86
00:04:52,660 --> 00:04:56,650
but it has been timed that can never be
automatically let go off and it has the

87
00:04:56,651 --> 00:04:59,860
potential to come crashing down on you
if you're not paying attention.

88
00:05:00,070 --> 00:05:02,500
Liam,
in the end forces his wife to expose him

89
00:05:02,501 --> 00:05:05,620
to the truth.
And the most visceral way imaginable is

90
00:05:05,621 --> 00:05:09,160
marriage now in ruins.
He ponders about better times rewinding

91
00:05:09,161 --> 00:05:12,610
them and perhaps wishing he had really
lift those moments when they were still

92
00:05:12,611 --> 00:05:14,710
real.
And even though he turned out to be

93
00:05:14,711 --> 00:05:18,400
right in this obsessive paranoia,
seeing how Lehman fear almost always

94
00:05:18,401 --> 00:05:21,580
shown apart from each other,
one can only wonder what it was this

95
00:05:21,581 --> 00:05:25,000
brokenness to over analyze,
to live in the past rather than in the

96
00:05:25,001 --> 00:05:27,310
present.
That caused a rift in our marriage long

97
00:05:27,311 --> 00:05:30,760
before the event's shown on screen.
So obsessed.

98
00:05:31,930 --> 00:05:35,870
I'm not,
in the end,

99
00:05:35,890 --> 00:05:38,890
Leah knows that having a grain will
never allow him to move on,

100
00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:42,790
that it would always keep him a prisoner
of his own mind and it's at that point

101
00:05:42,791 --> 00:05:46,690
and he realizes that the only way he
will ever escape this vicious cycle is

102
00:05:46,691 --> 00:05:49,150
to literally cut off that that would
have the past.

103
00:05:49,151 --> 00:05:49,370
And

104
00:05:49,370 --> 00:05:51,410
finally coming back into the now.

105
00:05:59,210 --> 00:06:02,420
That concludes this video essay.

I will drop my additional video
commentary for this video essay on our

109
00:06:13,281 --> 00:06:16,070
patrion page.
I think the entire history view is one

110
00:06:16,071 --> 00:06:18,170
off,
if not the best black mirror episode to

111
00:06:18,171 --> 00:06:20,500
date.
And I hope I showed you why exactly it

112
00:06:20,510 --> 00:06:22,420
is in this video.
Um,

113
00:06:22,450 --> 00:06:23,750
you know,
I think that's it for today.
