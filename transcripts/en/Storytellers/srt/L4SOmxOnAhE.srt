This video is sponsored by Fica Swath

00:00:03,900 --> 00:00:07,200
When I was little,
I spent hours upon hours playing video

3
00:00:07,201 --> 00:00:10,890
games like Rome through the war,
age of empires and by the full middle

4
00:00:10,891 --> 00:00:13,500
earth.
If you had a similar childhood as mine,

5
00:00:13,501 --> 00:00:16,200
you will love faking since its latest
update.

6
00:00:16,201 --> 00:00:20,390
The game is bigger than ever with nation
to nation Bedell's within fucking sure

7
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:22,770
have to ability to choose your own place
town.

8
00:00:22,860 --> 00:00:26,270
Either build a strong economy,
focused on fighting wars or rain.

9
00:00:26,271 --> 00:00:31,080
Your empire faking since now reached
over 20 million players so installed the

10
00:00:31,081 --> 00:00:33,030
game,
clicking my link in the description

11
00:00:33,031 --> 00:00:36,960
below and you'll get 200 gold and an
initial protection shoots for free.

12
00:01:07,790 --> 00:01:08,870
Why would you choose slide

13
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:14,070
one of the most iconic opening scenes
instead of Danny Boyle's 90 96 movie,

14
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:18,120
trainspotting in managers to take
something that is unrelatable for most

15
00:01:18,121 --> 00:01:20,760
of us,
the destructive and self destructive

16
00:01:20,761 --> 00:01:24,540
behavior of drug addicts and draws us in
with a rationalization.

17
00:01:24,541 --> 00:01:26,040
We can all on the stands.

18
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:29,930
She was diy in one time.
You the fuck you on a Sunday morning to

19
00:01:29,931 --> 00:01:33,230
sitting on the couch watching my numbing
spit at Kachin game shorts,

20
00:01:33,470 --> 00:01:36,470
stuffing,
fucking jumped for it and I chose not to

21
00:01:36,471 --> 00:01:40,190
choose life.
I choose something else and the reasons,

22
00:01:41,730 --> 00:01:45,980
but I'm the reasons.
These reasons when you've got hat on,

23
00:01:46,750 --> 00:01:50,430
we are all aware of the mundanity,
your flavor of [inaudible].

24
00:01:50,550 --> 00:01:55,150
What can I get stuck in the boring daily
responsibilities while it has to attend

25
00:01:55,151 --> 00:01:59,470
to choose cleaning your house too is
doing Texas two is going through the

26
00:01:59,471 --> 00:02:03,490
same job every day from nine to five but
why would you choose that?

27
00:02:03,730 --> 00:02:06,760
Why not just choose pleasure,
especially if the pleasure.

28
00:02:07,130 --> 00:02:11,210
Take the backstory guys,
I'm you ever had multiply it by 2000 and

29
00:02:11,211 --> 00:02:12,860
there still are nowhere near it.

30
00:02:13,510 --> 00:02:17,380
Rent and then his friends therefore find
themselves in a similar position as I

31
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:18,670
argued,
similar dosing,

32
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:21,960
the lion king,
the position of choosing escapism that

33
00:02:22,060 --> 00:02:26,650
pleasure over adopting responsibility.
Birth where Simba chooses eating bugs,

34
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:31,610
relaxing and singing over reclaiming his
kingdom rent and his friends to a darker

35
00:02:31,611 --> 00:02:36,370
and more destructive substance in order
to escape the boring identity of normal,

36
00:02:36,371 --> 00:02:40,900
lower to middle class life.
The film then exposes another hypocrisy

37
00:02:40,901 --> 00:02:43,300
about looking down on the heroin
addiction

38
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:46,300
without poisoned my body.
Whether I should.

39
00:02:48,490 --> 00:02:53,140
All the fucking chemicals
move fucking weed.

40
00:02:55,410 --> 00:02:59,740
It's always the life mine.
Is it in your body but shaped

41
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:04,600
cause own to all addicted to something.
Does it really make any difference if we

42
00:03:04,601 --> 00:03:08,440
choose heroin or if you choose alcohol,
violence or smoking?

43
00:03:08,710 --> 00:03:11,260
If we choose benching,
television and movies,

44
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:12,760
instagram or twitter,

45
00:03:13,870 --> 00:03:15,610
choose facebook,
twitter,

46
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:18,030
snapchat,
instagram and oppose and other ways to

47
00:03:18,031 --> 00:03:20,500
spew your bail cross.
People you've never met.

48
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:23,860
Choose updating your profile.
Tell the world what you had for

49
00:03:23,861 --> 00:03:26,680
breakfast and hope that someone
somewhere cares.

50
00:03:27,030 --> 00:03:29,730
The answer to transplanting a guesthouse
is that yes,

51
00:03:29,790 --> 00:03:32,880
it does make a difference cause just as
rent and says,

52
00:03:33,010 --> 00:03:36,160
this was to be my final head,
but let's be clear by this.

53
00:03:37,150 --> 00:03:39,100
That's final pets and final heads

54
00:03:39,310 --> 00:03:41,800
there.
Our addictions and our addictions.

55
00:03:42,010 --> 00:03:46,060
Maybe you are all escaping something
trying to fill a void because although

56
00:03:46,061 --> 00:03:48,460
good addiction can do that,
the ones we choose,

57
00:03:48,461 --> 00:03:51,260
we will have an impact on our lives.
There are addictions,

58
00:03:51,290 --> 00:03:56,200
there's will bring us up addictions that
will bring us down slowly and addictions

59
00:03:56,201 --> 00:04:00,250
that he'll bring us down.
False drove to film the pleasure of how

60
00:04:00,420 --> 00:04:03,640
to escape the boredom and identity and
the harshness of life.

61
00:04:03,641 --> 00:04:07,300
Seeing strengthen,
deepen hell almost destroying himself

62
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:11,020
and everything around him.
The ending of the film then leaves us

63
00:04:11,021 --> 00:04:14,440
with this message.
It is better to choose to responsibility

64
00:04:14,441 --> 00:04:18,880
often normal mundane life than to seek
further into the hell that escape

65
00:04:18,881 --> 00:04:20,200
displeasure creates.

66
00:04:21,070 --> 00:04:25,740
Think I'm going to be just like you.
The job family,

67
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:28,250
the fucking big television,
the washing machine,

68
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:30,410
the car,
the compact desk and electrical,

69
00:04:30,411 --> 00:04:31,760
10 Elkanah,
good health,

70
00:04:31,910 --> 00:04:33,530
low cholesterol,
dental insurance,

71
00:04:33,531 --> 00:04:35,660
mortgage starter,
home leisure wear,

72
00:04:35,780 --> 00:04:36,860
luggage,
three piece,

73
00:04:36,861 --> 00:04:39,350
suite diy gave him shorts,
junk food,

74
00:04:39,410 --> 00:04:43,100
children walks in the park,
the nine to five good at goal washing

75
00:04:43,101 --> 00:04:44,150
the car choices,

76
00:04:50,940 --> 00:04:55,700
but it is not the solution and this is
what the secret of transporting tea two

77
00:04:55,701 --> 00:04:59,720
offers to me.
What makes this film that was critiques

78
00:04:59,721 --> 00:05:04,240
for Wallowing in its own nostalgia.
A brilliant film is that it's complete

79
00:05:04,250 --> 00:05:07,730
so question not fully answered by the
original cause.

80
00:05:07,731 --> 00:05:11,180
What happens where you choose life when
you choose getting away.

81
00:05:11,330 --> 00:05:15,020
We've tried to adopt your
responsibilities and irritating that's

82
00:05:15,021 --> 00:05:17,280
comes with it when you moved from in the
escape,

83
00:05:17,290 --> 00:05:22,220
his position to Waldorf adopting a
normal Monday life where I will leave

84
00:05:22,221 --> 00:05:26,900
you 20 years later choose life,
but as even bremmer a deck to play spot

85
00:05:26,901 --> 00:05:29,000
states.
Life doesn't come for free.

86
00:05:29,090 --> 00:05:32,360
That will be beautiful moments,
but it will also leave you scarred.

87
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:37,490
The sequel explores this question is a
good step to replace her addiction to

88
00:05:37,491 --> 00:05:42,230
heroin with an addiction to running and
addiction to getting away good.

89
00:05:42,420 --> 00:05:44,710
It won't feel the void.
What'd you channel on

90
00:05:47,930 --> 00:05:48,763
getting away?

91
00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:53,340
Choosing life will work out the way you
hoped.

92
00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:58,580
Truest disappointment.
Choose fill dreams filled and and answer

93
00:05:58,581 --> 00:05:59,414
the questions.

94
00:05:59,740 --> 00:06:02,320
Settle for less and keep a brave face on
it.

95
00:06:02,590 --> 00:06:06,130
Choose disappointment and choose losing
the ones you love.

96
00:06:06,140 --> 00:06:08,470
Donuts.
They fold from view a piece of you dies

97
00:06:08,471 --> 00:06:11,170
with them until you can see that one day
in the future,

98
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:14,860
piece by piece they will all be gone and
there'll be nothing left of you to call

99
00:06:14,861 --> 00:06:17,890
alive or dead.
Choose your future Veronica,

100
00:06:18,340 --> 00:06:19,270
choose life

101
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:24,520
and then it is time to return home and
see what you left behind your heroin

102
00:06:24,861 --> 00:06:25,730
addiction.
Yes,

103
00:06:25,750 --> 00:06:28,460
but maybe,
maybe something more

104
00:06:30,470 --> 00:06:35,470
so what you been up to for 20 years
cause maybe you miss something maybe

105
00:06:36,651 --> 00:06:39,320
within the hell threatens heroin,
addiction,

106
00:06:39,510 --> 00:06:40,730
care,
escapism.

107
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:45,760
There was something more worth not music
away from something else was choosing

108
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:49,240
and death I think is the lesson.
Trees.

109
00:06:49,241 --> 00:06:53,510
Putting explorers where we choose to be
addicted to the moving forwards.

110
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:59,060
We forget to look back and more
importantly we forget to be where we are

111
00:06:59,810 --> 00:07:04,070
when there's nowhere to move forward to
anymore renting us no choice but to look

112
00:07:04,071 --> 00:07:09,071
back and realize he mistakes,
things that he didn't appreciate when he

113
00:07:09,081 --> 00:07:13,340
was experiencing the lesson in this
nostalgic film.

114
00:07:13,910 --> 00:07:17,630
This film that is about one that's been
well does be lost.

115
00:07:18,030 --> 00:07:19,760
Having this one on day,

116
00:07:20,530 --> 00:07:25,530
sunny afternoon,
two young minds up to Kevin for our very

117
00:07:26,021 --> 00:07:27,020
first hand offs.
Warning.

118
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:28,530
All right.
Fresh bag.

119
00:07:28,531 --> 00:07:32,920
Your hand is that baby.
Don't just choose your future.

120
00:07:33,340 --> 00:07:38,170
Choose to not choose to be present.
Choose to experience the movies with

121
00:07:38,171 --> 00:07:40,080
your friends.
Choose the lofter.

122
00:07:40,370 --> 00:07:43,120
Say,
choose the one that got away.

123
00:07:43,570 --> 00:07:48,530
Choose to be tooth to sometimes that
still listen to the user.

124
00:07:58,070 --> 00:07:58,903
Okay.

125
00:08:16,450 --> 00:08:18,340
All right.
Thank you all for watching.

126
00:08:18,370 --> 00:08:23,350
So to to moving to a new place and
working from my laptop and dealing with

127
00:08:23,351 --> 00:08:26,470
some internet issues.
I struggled with some of the audio

128
