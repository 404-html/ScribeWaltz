1
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:09,420
It's been five years since black water
originally aired and its explosion of

2
00:00:09,421 --> 00:00:11,760
wildfires,
still a sight to behold,

3
00:00:12,790 --> 00:00:16,500
but besides it's visual appeal,
it's in this moment through the death of

4
00:00:16,501 --> 00:00:20,790
hundreds in which the true nature of the
various characters involved are laid

5
00:00:20,791 --> 00:00:23,640
bare.
It's these reactions they have and the

6
00:00:23,641 --> 00:00:27,990
decisions they make in the face of death
rather than the visual spectacle of war

7
00:00:27,991 --> 00:00:31,710
itself that makes this episode and game
of thrones as a whole,

8
00:00:31,711 --> 00:00:34,530
as great as it is now,
last season,

9
00:00:34,531 --> 00:00:38,220
we got to experience what it's like to
see another battle play out in this time

10
00:00:38,221 --> 00:00:42,090
on a much higher budget,
but the battle of the bastards is in a

11
00:00:42,091 --> 00:00:46,440
lot of ways the opposite of black water.
The main focus here is on the visual

12
00:00:46,470 --> 00:00:50,940
rather than the moral and psychological.
It's about the feeling of chaos for John

13
00:00:50,941 --> 00:00:53,280
and the horror of medieval warfare
itself.

14
00:00:53,490 --> 00:00:54,420
Now,
don't get me wrong,

15
00:00:54,421 --> 00:00:58,620
it's a tremendous visual sequence that
dwarfs every battle previously seen on a

16
00:00:58,621 --> 00:01:02,030
show or TV in general for that matter,
but it's also sequenced.

17
00:01:02,070 --> 00:01:05,100
That's lacking in the aspects that make
game of thrones unique.

18
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:09,540
The Battle of the best verses a struggle
between the forces of good and forces of

19
00:01:09,541 --> 00:01:12,060
evil,
whereas blackwater is a fight between

20
00:01:12,061 --> 00:01:14,550
two sites,
none of which are portrayed as being

21
00:01:14,551 --> 00:01:18,750
more benevolent or ill intention.
Then the other nearby effectively

22
00:01:18,751 --> 00:01:20,940
confusing the audience and who to root
for.

23
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:25,680
It's in this fog of war at writer George
Rr Martin has decided to depict the

24
00:01:25,681 --> 00:01:28,080
battle through the eyes of various
individuals,

25
00:01:28,410 --> 00:01:32,340
individuals from both sides who are all
dealing with the stress and the anxiety

26
00:01:32,341 --> 00:01:35,520
that comes with the reality of death and
their own particular way.

27
00:01:35,850 --> 00:01:38,880
We can see it in devils,
retaining his sense of level headed

28
00:01:38,881 --> 00:01:43,650
pragmatism and in the fanatical faith of
his son we received in Tyrian resorting

29
00:01:43,651 --> 00:01:46,740
to one last night of lovemaking and
accepting his fate.

30
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:51,210
As a military commander,
we see it in prideful nihilism stenosis,

31
00:01:51,330 --> 00:01:52,440
content,
demeanor,

32
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:54,720
bronze drinking,
the hound cynicism.

33
00:01:55,140 --> 00:01:57,380
It's a show of character in the face of
death,

34
00:01:57,420 --> 00:02:01,380
a stripping away of all the
superficialities that normally shout the

35
00:02:01,381 --> 00:02:04,020
true essence of who these people truly
are.

36
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:06,070
Don't get killed.
No,

37
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:07,400
you my friend.
Oh,

38
00:02:08,170 --> 00:02:10,110
are we friends now?
Of course we are,

39
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:12,050
or as we'll showed her,
puts it well.

40
00:02:12,051 --> 00:02:14,520
It was expanding on the thoughts of
William Faulkner,

41
00:02:14,940 --> 00:02:19,110
the only thing or if writing about is
the human heart in conflict with itself.

42
00:02:19,410 --> 00:02:22,680
We all have it in us to be angels and
all of those have it in us to be

43
00:02:22,681 --> 00:02:25,290
monsters.
What matters is the decisions we make at

44
00:02:25,291 --> 00:02:28,980
two crucial periods and times of our
life and it's during the times when

45
00:02:28,981 --> 00:02:30,550
death,
disability stone's throw away,

46
00:02:30,570 --> 00:02:35,400
that our most authentic self will
consciously or unconsciously come to

47
00:02:35,401 --> 00:02:40,401
light
by placing the emphasis on the decisions

48
00:02:41,101 --> 00:02:43,350
and the mortality of individuals in
battle.

49
00:02:43,380 --> 00:02:47,340
Rather than framing this story in a more
conventional and simplistic good versus

50
00:02:47,341 --> 00:02:50,250
bad struggle.
It provides the audience for our very

51
00:02:50,251 --> 00:02:53,970
own conflict of heart as we're now
invited to seed our world in a more

52
00:02:53,971 --> 00:02:58,140
nuance and a more human manner,
no longer rooting for sides,

53
00:02:58,141 --> 00:03:01,600
for instead rooting for the individual,
empathizing with them,

54
00:03:01,601 --> 00:03:04,570
or at the very least,
truly learning something about their

55
00:03:04,571 --> 00:03:06,340
nature.
For King Joffrey,

56
00:03:06,341 --> 00:03:10,540
this means is show of cowardice or
perhaps also evidence of is harmful

57
00:03:10,541 --> 00:03:15,010
upbringing by a cynical mutter who
ultimately shows herself to be akin to

58
00:03:15,011 --> 00:03:17,200
the prideful destructiveness of real
life,

59
00:03:17,230 --> 00:03:20,080
mocked a goebbels,
but on the other hand we also get a

60
00:03:20,081 --> 00:03:23,020
sense of why it is that she became a
hateful person.

61
00:03:23,021 --> 00:03:27,490
She shows herself to be she drunkenly,
spouts out her resentments towards her

62
00:03:27,491 --> 00:03:30,100
father and her role as a woman in the
family.

63
00:03:30,190 --> 00:03:35,190
It was expected of me as it will be a
view if you ever become joffrey's queen,

64
00:03:35,590 --> 00:03:39,020
but in the midst of all the bickering
between main characters in the midst of

65
00:03:39,110 --> 00:03:43,060
our self reflection leadership and the
terminus in the face of the feet,

66
00:03:43,450 --> 00:03:48,130
George Rr Martin also doesn't forget to
show us the humanity on a larger skill

67
00:03:48,370 --> 00:03:52,180
and how the decisions of our high born
characters affect the lives of thousands

68
00:03:52,181 --> 00:03:54,370
otherwise,
nameless and forgotten people.

69
00:03:54,510 --> 00:03:57,490
The lab's called agreement to make,
trying to sneak away with a stolen horse

70
00:03:57,491 --> 00:03:58,440
and some gold cups.

71
00:04:01,090 --> 00:04:05,140
How's the NNC to them?
It's through these brief glimpses in the

72
00:04:05,141 --> 00:04:08,220
background through shots of commoners
fleeing soldiers,

73
00:04:08,250 --> 00:04:12,260
vomiting before battle in a sense that
the good and the righteous only stands

74
00:04:12,261 --> 00:04:16,320
to lose in this war of kings.
Boys will never come back.

75
00:04:17,180 --> 00:04:22,050
Feel free will the west.
It's about showing this that Martin

76
00:04:22,051 --> 00:04:25,950
personalizes and the generalized,
the conflict to the very bottom of the

77
00:04:25,951 --> 00:04:28,500
game of thrones hierarchy.
Throughout the episode,

78
00:04:28,501 --> 00:04:32,310
Tyrian is the one character who truly
grasps the wider humanity at play,

79
00:04:32,580 --> 00:04:36,730
who understands the gap between the ones
of the high born and wants of those

80
00:04:36,731 --> 00:04:37,710
staking their order

81
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:41,150
for your kids.
Don't fight for his kingdom.

82
00:04:41,950 --> 00:04:45,310
Your means the fact that your Katie's.

83
00:04:46,140 --> 00:04:48,630
It's only fitting that Syrian has been
known to be Martins,

84
00:04:48,631 --> 00:04:52,500
own embodiment of who he'd be or who he
wants to be in the world of game of

85
00:04:52,501 --> 00:04:56,190
chromes and it's complete deconstruction
of the US versus them narrative.

86
00:04:56,220 --> 00:05:00,360
Blackwater shows itself to be highly
critical of the feudal succession system

87
00:05:00,361 --> 00:05:04,320
and the senselessness of the conflict
being driven by people who send her

88
00:05:04,460 --> 00:05:05,640
again,
describes as,

89
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:10,100
this is a killer.
Atlanta's just kill us,

90
00:05:11,340 --> 00:05:12,180
kill us.

91
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:16,100
It's in this pessimistic,
yet realistic view of the world of game,

92
00:05:16,101 --> 00:05:19,670
of thrones and fruit,
a depiction of a truly great conflict in

93
00:05:19,671 --> 00:05:23,600
which good and bad exist on both sides
and inside the individual characters

94
00:05:23,601 --> 00:05:25,880
themselves,
but the futility of it all becomes

95
00:05:25,881 --> 00:05:30,170
everclear and in which game of thrones
uniqueness truly shines as George

96
00:05:30,171 --> 00:05:33,740
himself puts it in response to the
battles likeness to deloitte or rings

97
00:05:33,741 --> 00:05:37,410
battle of Helm's deep.
The ward at Tolkien wrote about was war

98
00:05:37,411 --> 00:05:40,040
for the fate of civilization and the
future of humanity,

99
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:43,130
and that's become the template.
I'm not sure that's a good template

100
00:05:43,131 --> 00:05:45,320
though.
It's all key model lead generations of

101
00:05:45,321 --> 00:05:49,490
fantasy writers to produce these endless
series of dark Lord Cinder Evil Minions

102
00:05:49,491 --> 00:05:51,800
who were all very ugly and wear black
clothes,

103
00:05:52,220 --> 00:05:55,280
but the vast majority of wars throughout
history are not like that.

104
00:05:55,370 --> 00:05:57,620
Although structurally very similar its
core,

105
00:05:57,621 --> 00:06:02,150
a black water can really be seen as a
sort of anti helm's deep and whereas the

106
00:06:02,151 --> 00:06:05,780
battle of the bastards might be a
different type of battle in its essence,

107
00:06:05,781 --> 00:06:09,320
it has a lot more in common with helm's
deep and it's all keen template in

108
00:06:09,321 --> 00:06:13,610
general being an outlier and for some
maybe a breath of fresh air.

109
00:06:13,610 --> 00:06:16,070
There's really nothing wrong with this
in itself,

110
00:06:16,490 --> 00:06:18,650
but it seems that the final two seasons
of the show,

111
00:06:18,651 --> 00:06:22,700
we'll perhaps somewhat unavoidably move
ever more into the direction of

112
00:06:22,701 --> 00:06:26,190
conventional talking fantasy.
But before we get there though,

113
00:06:26,210 --> 00:06:29,150
there are still battles to be fought
which could and shoot.

114
00:06:29,151 --> 00:06:32,150
Bring out what makes game of thrones
great in the first place.

115
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:35,720
If visually compelling,
morally gray battle that exposes true

116
00:06:35,721 --> 00:06:38,870
character in the face of death,
the question remains,

117
00:06:38,871 --> 00:06:41,300
however,
how to show will choose to deal with

118
00:06:41,330 --> 00:06:46,010
their very own conflict of heart and to
what extent it has already decided on a

119
00:06:46,011 --> 00:06:49,970
more conventional and perhaps safer path
in the end.

120
00:06:50,010 --> 00:06:53,990
Will door to salvation for our
characters opened at the very last

121
00:06:53,991 --> 00:06:58,991
moment or will it remain closed and will
the story dare to show itself to be to

122
00:06:59,540 --> 00:07:01,580
entitle key truly is

123
00:07:07,020 --> 00:07:10,050
and who.
All right,

124
00:07:10,051 --> 00:07:12,090
that's the end of yet another video
essay.

125
00:07:12,110 --> 00:07:15,630
Black water has to be one of my favorite
game of thrones episodes and I hope this

126
00:07:15,631 --> 00:07:18,720
video gave you his sentence.
Why as I'm recording this,

127
00:07:18,721 --> 00:07:23,040
it's only a couple of hours until the
release of season seven's first episode.

128
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:26,730
Which direction do you guys think the
show will take and how do you think it

129
00:07:26,731 --> 00:07:29,400
will all end next year?
I would love to hear your thoughts on

130
00:07:29,401 --> 00:07:31,710
this anyway.
