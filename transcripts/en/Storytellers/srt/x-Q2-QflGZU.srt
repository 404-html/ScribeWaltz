1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:03,510
A big thank you to squarespace for
sponsoring this video.

2
00:00:04,190 --> 00:00:08,390
It's not easy butchering people's hard
work physically and mentally.

3
00:00:08,391 --> 00:00:11,630
I don't think people realize you need to
vent.

4
00:00:12,260 --> 00:00:17,180
One of the more fascinating aspects of
David fincher's mind hunter is that it

5
00:00:17,181 --> 00:00:21,140
is not just a detective thriller.
Dad Explores the psychology of serial

6
00:00:21,141 --> 00:00:25,370
killers but at it also explores why we
are so fascinated by them,

7
00:00:25,550 --> 00:00:28,760
why we are drawn to the dark,
why we are captivated,

8
00:00:28,910 --> 00:00:33,650
haunted and teased by the unthinkable.
Although collecting serial killer

9
00:00:33,651 --> 00:00:37,310
memorabilia or writing them letters is a
fringe activity.

10
00:00:37,311 --> 00:00:41,720
Serial killers in habits of prominence
position within both our nonfictional

11
00:00:41,721 --> 00:00:46,100
and fictional popular culture,
people are glued to coverage of real

12
00:00:46,101 --> 00:00:49,210
life serial killers such as Ted Bundy,
Eileen wound,

13
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:53,750
and Jeffrey Dahmer who all have their
own documentaries and films.

14
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:57,720
I now present to you Jeffrey Dahmer in
his command performance.

15
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:03,890
These real killers together with popular
fictional depictions of serial killers

16
00:01:03,891 --> 00:01:08,070
such as Hannibal Lecter or dexter and
John Doe demonstrate how eager the

17
00:01:08,071 --> 00:01:13,071
public is to learn more about him.
The way in which mind center treats and

18
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:16,110
thesises with accurate representations
of real life.

19
00:01:16,111 --> 00:01:20,820
Serial killers was described by review
as serial killer fence surface.

20
00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:23,640
Serial killers are this feud in our
culture,

21
00:01:23,641 --> 00:01:25,770
both as despicable monsters,

22
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:28,010
monster,
right?

23
00:01:29,090 --> 00:01:30,050
I think we can all agree

24
00:01:30,950 --> 00:01:33,110
and fascinating cool celebrities.

25
00:01:33,460 --> 00:01:37,970
You would really turn down the chance to
meet Richard Speck is almost up there.

26
00:01:37,971 --> 00:01:41,340
They're advancing.
Or maybe he'll give you an autograph,

27
00:01:41,740 --> 00:01:44,560
but why is this?
Why can't we get enough of them?

28
00:01:45,070 --> 00:01:49,510
The first episode of tend to suggest
that there is a connection between the

29
00:01:49,511 --> 00:01:53,950
behavior of these killers and the
broader state of culture and society,

30
00:01:54,270 --> 00:01:57,300
democracy,
Spanish style.

31
00:01:57,380 --> 00:02:01,730
What are
just a response to turmoil?

32
00:02:02,110 --> 00:02:04,700
The government used to be symbolically a
parental institution.

33
00:02:06,470 --> 00:02:09,080
It's a free for all.
The world barely makes any sense.

34
00:02:09,081 --> 00:02:10,700
So it follows the crime doesn't either.

35
00:02:11,350 --> 00:02:15,910
Is that what we see in serial killers?
Are they an extreme representation of

36
00:02:15,911 --> 00:02:19,150
our broader society for which we are all
responsible?

37
00:02:19,540 --> 00:02:22,120
Of course,
holden and bill soon find out that

38
00:02:22,121 --> 00:02:26,920
serial killers are not crazy rampant
aberrational parallels to the crazy

39
00:02:26,921 --> 00:02:29,440
chaotic culture of the sixties and
seventies

40
00:02:30,050 --> 00:02:32,260
that's that friends eat.
I don't know what the hell is

41
00:02:35,620 --> 00:02:37,900
meticulous,
highly intelligent.

42
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:43,360
The scholars can be intelligent and
organized with very clear motivations

43
00:02:43,361 --> 00:02:45,940
for their quote unquote work such as
sex,

44
00:02:45,941 --> 00:02:47,680
power and domination.

45
00:02:48,270 --> 00:02:52,800
I'm just saying people who hunt other
people for a vocation,

46
00:02:52,890 --> 00:02:55,620
all we want to talk about is what it's
like

47
00:02:55,910 --> 00:02:58,460
this.
If serial killers are an extreme

48
00:02:58,461 --> 00:03:02,140
representation of human culture,
they are so in the way.

49
00:03:02,141 --> 00:03:06,700
Historian Carsten Fisher describes,
he argues that serial killers often

50
00:03:06,701 --> 00:03:09,590
developed in the same way as human
civilizations,

51
00:03:09,591 --> 00:03:12,610
do civilizations in their fields,
the unknown,

52
00:03:12,611 --> 00:03:16,620
half need to organize,
control and dominate nature and other

53
00:03:16,630 --> 00:03:19,300
people.
Therefore first domesticating and

54
00:03:19,301 --> 00:03:22,600
killing animals and so later in
sloughing and it's killing all the

55
00:03:22,601 --> 00:03:24,530
humans.
Just a serial killer,

56
00:03:24,531 --> 00:03:28,930
start with torturing and killing animals
before they move on to people.

57
00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:32,040
So then it became dogs and cats
strangling them,

58
00:03:32,041 --> 00:03:34,530
burying them in the backyard.
Hold on.

59
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:36,113
Sorry.

60
00:03:37,070 --> 00:03:40,920
On an individual level.
This theory is also reflected by

61
00:03:40,990 --> 00:03:44,960
[inaudible] concept of the shadow self.
You argue stairs.

62
00:03:44,980 --> 00:03:48,740
We repress primitive,
negative socially or religiously

63
00:03:48,741 --> 00:03:52,820
depreciate as human emotions and
impulses like sexual loss,

64
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:54,710
power striving,
selfishness,

65
00:03:54,711 --> 00:03:58,730
creeds and anger or rage into our own
consciousness.

66
00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:00,380
Our dark side,
so to speak,

67
00:04:00,620 --> 00:04:04,550
the shadow self is to counterpoint to
what you called a persona,

68
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:08,360
which is our conscious ego.
How we see ourselves and represent

69
00:04:08,361 --> 00:04:09,860
ourselves to watch the worlds.

70
00:04:10,570 --> 00:04:14,210
That's by Erving Goffman.
He posits that life was like theater.

71
00:04:14,690 --> 00:04:19,280
We tailor ourselves to fit the parts
that were playing in a social

72
00:04:19,281 --> 00:04:20,320
interaction.
Awesome.

73
00:04:20,380 --> 00:04:21,290
Yeah.
To put performance,

74
00:04:21,291 --> 00:04:24,670
there's an onstage area where
individuals are actress as the case may

75
00:04:24,671 --> 00:04:29,671
be appear before the origins,
but I must be backstage hidden private

76
00:04:30,531 --> 00:04:33,180
area where individuals can truly be
themselves.

77
00:04:33,181 --> 00:04:33,950
Of course,
emily,

78
00:04:33,950 --> 00:04:37,580
I argued that it's mine.
Tinter explosive notion that this is why

79
00:04:37,581 --> 00:04:42,581
we are fascinated by serial killers
because we seen them extreme versions of

80
00:04:42,801 --> 00:04:47,110
personality traits that are part of us,
but as we repress into our own

81
00:04:47,111 --> 00:04:50,360
consciousness that are part of our
shadow selves,

82
00:04:50,630 --> 00:04:54,770
the series primary Dastis to the
character of Holden Ford.

83
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:58,460
In the early episodes we primarily see
Holden's persona.

84
00:04:58,520 --> 00:05:00,320
He seems smart,
that humble,

85
00:05:00,350 --> 00:05:03,410
idealistic with a real drive to do
goods.

86
00:05:03,740 --> 00:05:05,810
You sure you want me doing that?
You're smart,

87
00:05:05,900 --> 00:05:08,510
you're idealistic,
more than a little sensitive,

88
00:05:09,190 --> 00:05:10,023
they're going to love you.

89
00:05:12,490 --> 00:05:15,520
However,
he already mentioned Sitek that he will

90
00:05:15,521 --> 00:05:18,340
later use in his interviews with serial
killers,

91
00:05:19,060 --> 00:05:21,670
try understanding him instead of trying
to dominate,

92
00:05:22,940 --> 00:05:25,910
look for common ground,
find calming down.

93
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:30,090
Because of this very slowly over the
course of the season,

94
00:05:30,091 --> 00:05:33,150
due to his extensive interactions with
these killers,

95
00:05:33,180 --> 00:05:36,570
personality traits off his shadow self
come forwards,

96
00:05:36,810 --> 00:05:40,770
traits such as envy and fucked up views
of sex and women,

97
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:43,470
which he claims is just an interview
technique,

98
00:05:43,471 --> 00:05:47,160
but it seems fairly much connectors to
the state of this relationship.

99
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:53,240
What gave you the right to take eight
right consent of the world?

100
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:58,610
Some of them looked pretty good.
You would think you were depriving the

101
00:05:58,611 --> 00:05:59,444
rest of us

102
00:06:00,610 --> 00:06:03,790
while also becoming more arrogant and
power hungry.

103
00:06:04,290 --> 00:06:05,580
You think,
I don't know what you're doing with this

104
00:06:05,581 --> 00:06:08,700
principal's office bullshit.
This is what I do with violent

105
00:06:08,701 --> 00:06:10,470
offenders.
Only much better.

106
00:06:10,610 --> 00:06:15,380
Two CDs in contrast in episode three he
is celebrating a successful case like

107
00:06:15,381 --> 00:06:17,450
this.
Thank you for acknowledging what my

108
00:06:17,451 --> 00:06:22,451
partner bill and I are doing
and for embracing that.

109
00:06:22,671 --> 00:06:23,900
If we all work together,

110
00:06:25,210 --> 00:06:28,990
we can venture into the blackest night
and shine a light on the darkness.

111
00:06:29,340 --> 00:06:32,070
Well,
an episode 10 it is a different story.

112
00:06:35,010 --> 00:06:37,220
I don't think I'm speaking at an
attorney or when I say I.

113
00:06:41,140 --> 00:06:44,050
However,
I have heard some people suggest as

114
00:06:44,051 --> 00:06:47,770
holden in the next season might become a
serial killer himself.

115
00:06:47,890 --> 00:06:52,090
I think this would be too easily a plot
twist after such a slow and subtle

116
00:06:52,091 --> 00:06:55,720
transformation into a shadow self.
More importantly,

117
00:06:55,721 --> 00:06:59,770
the concept of the shadow self doesn't
mean we are all secretly murderous

118
00:06:59,771 --> 00:07:02,650
psychopath.
Serial killers represent extreme

119
00:07:02,651 --> 00:07:07,120
versions of negative traits that normal
people would possess in a much more

120
00:07:07,121 --> 00:07:11,530
minor capacity call.
You argue stair to become once complete

121
00:07:11,531 --> 00:07:14,590
self.
The shadow self needs to be recognized,

122
00:07:14,650 --> 00:07:19,650
acknowledged and accepted as Jordan
Peterson argues this can be done to an

123
00:07:19,691 --> 00:07:24,190
intellectual exercise when you
contemplate your own capacity for evil

124
00:07:24,370 --> 00:07:26,390
and I don't think,
and this is something I did learn from

125
00:07:26,391 --> 00:07:31,391
yoga is that you cannot be a good person
until you know how much evil you contain

126
00:07:32,061 --> 00:07:34,640
within you.
It is not possible and it's a very

127
00:07:34,641 --> 00:07:38,990
strange thing because you wouldn't think
that the revelation of the capacity for

128
00:07:38,991 --> 00:07:43,020
evil is a precondition for the
realization of good but I believe at

129
00:07:43,030 --> 00:07:46,970
first of all why would you be serious
enough to even attempt to pursue the

130
00:07:46,971 --> 00:07:51,950
good unless you had some sense of what
the consequence was of not doing it with

131
00:07:51,951 --> 00:07:52,150
you

132
00:07:52,150 --> 00:07:55,450
guards to hold him.
He doesn't seem aware of his own shadow

133
00:07:55,451 --> 00:07:59,170
self coming forwards until possibly the
very ends of the season.

134
00:07:59,770 --> 00:08:02,620
In my opinion,
it is unclear whilst holding force

135
00:08:02,621 --> 00:08:05,740
breakdown signifies two two s clash with
Kemper.

136
00:08:05,741 --> 00:08:09,280
He might've become aware of its own
shadow self coming forwards,

137
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:12,160
becoming a more balanced person and the
next season,

138
00:08:12,550 --> 00:08:15,580
who am I going to fuck him?
Fuck police torture mutilation.

139
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:21,880
This made you paranoid.
It could also mean that he will spin

140
00:08:22,801 --> 00:08:26,460
fruit out of control.
Is Shadow self taking over a while being

141
00:08:26,461 --> 00:08:29,520
unable to catch a new serial killer on
the rice.

142
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:32,160
My in Toronto.
We will continue to explore this

143
00:08:32,161 --> 00:08:36,900
psychology of serial killers profiling
some of the world's most famous ones,

144
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:37,720
but it's me.
Yeah.

145
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:40,390
B It is simultaneously profiling us.

146
00:08:40,780 --> 00:08:41,613
Well.

147
00:08:48,260 --> 00:08:50,540
All right.
Thank you for watching and thank you to

148
00:08:50,541 --> 00:08:54,740
squarespace for sponsoring this video.
You probably have seen a feature in

149
00:08:54,741 --> 00:08:57,210
other videos before,
but it's rightfully so.

150
00:08:57,510 --> 00:09:01,050
As someone who doesn't know how to code,
I've worked with several website

151
00:09:01,051 --> 00:09:05,190
templates systems in the past and
squarespace is by far the most elegant

152
00:09:05,191 --> 00:09:08,430
and easiest to use.
You also don't have to pay for any

153
00:09:08,431 --> 00:09:11,880
subscription or a website domain upfront
using the free trial.

154
00:09:11,881 --> 00:09:15,360
You can design your complete website
before deciding to pay for anything.

155
00:09:15,630 --> 00:09:19,290
So if you want to feature your serial
killer memorabilia or maybe just your

156
00:09:19,291 --> 00:09:22,140
music videos or artwork on the website,

159
00:09:29,191 --> 00:09:31,470

get some stickers,

160
00:09:31,471 --> 00:09:34,320

paypal.

161
00:09:34,380 --> 00:09:36,660
And lastly,
I want to give a shout out to fellow

162
00:09:36,661 --> 00:09:39,480

163
00:09:39,481 --> 00:09:42,090
