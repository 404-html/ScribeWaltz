1
00:00:03,080 --> 00:00:08,080
One of the best films that I saw in 2014
was two grand Budapest hotel,

2
00:00:08,810 --> 00:00:13,810
written and directed by West Anderson
was Edison is of course known for

3
00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:18,860
distinctive style in particular his
fullness for perfectly symmetrical

4
00:00:18,861 --> 00:00:22,580
shots,
which she spoke loft and hated for as

5
00:00:22,581 --> 00:00:26,960
less than some screenplays states.
Some people consider west Anderson a

6
00:00:26,961 --> 00:00:31,940
genius death converse conventional film
language into its own dialectic while

7
00:00:31,950 --> 00:00:36,800
others claim it is artfulness mistake
and for art film devoid of meaning.

8
00:00:37,310 --> 00:00:42,110
I think these opposing opinions own wes
Anderson style stem from a fundamental

9
00:00:42,111 --> 00:00:46,850
paradox in how people look at movies and
even broader nature.

10
00:00:47,630 --> 00:00:52,190
Perfect symmetry is a natural and
conventional cinematic language is

11
00:00:52,191 --> 00:00:55,370
designed to have the audience not notice
consciously,

12
00:00:55,371 --> 00:00:59,000
at least the manufactured nature or what
happens on screen.

13
00:00:59,270 --> 00:01:03,620
West Anderson therefore draws attention
away from the story and characters on

14
00:01:03,621 --> 00:01:06,170
screen and to watch his cinematic style.

15
00:01:06,470 --> 00:01:08,540
Yet,
although symmetry is a natural,

16
00:01:08,570 --> 00:01:13,040
people do find it beautiful.
It's movies therefore function more as a

17
00:01:13,041 --> 00:01:16,700
painting or storybook than conventional
narrative cinema.

18
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:20,320
I was argued this,
that it is critical for us and listen to

19
00:01:20,330 --> 00:01:25,330
match this narrative characters and
dialogue with a cinematic style so that

20
00:01:25,491 --> 00:01:28,610
is fewer accepted as fitting instead of
all natural,

21
00:01:28,670 --> 00:01:33,670
and I think he does this perfectly and
the Grand Budapest hotel where a

22
00:01:33,751 --> 00:01:38,240
moonrise kingdom and as soon alludes to
a cinematic stele mimicking the metrical

23
00:01:38,241 --> 00:01:42,140
storybooks,
susie bishop carries twitter in the

24
00:01:42,140 --> 00:01:44,450
Grand Budapest hotel.
He creates a frame story,

25
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:48,020
a story within a story,
within a story,

26
00:01:48,050 --> 00:01:52,250
within a story.
He even matches the aspect ratio of the

27
00:01:52,251 --> 00:01:54,950
narratives,
different time periods to the aspect

28
00:01:54,951 --> 00:01:58,430
ratio that was confessional for cinema
in the years.

29
00:01:58,450 --> 00:02:01,310
The story finance itself to this frame
story,

30
00:02:01,311 --> 00:02:06,311
the Grand Budapest hotel is submersed in
Ostalgie throwing us back into a more

31
00:02:06,621 --> 00:02:10,640
elegant time or aristocracy is civility
and taste.

32
00:02:11,310 --> 00:02:15,020
This nostalgia is towards the magical
world of the past,

33
00:02:15,290 --> 00:02:18,920
or even as his hinted or Walter Earth is
even older.

34
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:22,870
To be frank,
I think his world had vanished long

35
00:02:22,871 --> 00:02:27,430
before he ever rented it,
but I will say he certainly sustained

36
00:02:27,431 --> 00:02:29,380
the illusion with a marvelous grace.

37
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:34,830
I would say that this nostalgic,
elegant world matches perfectly with

38
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:38,680
innocence painting slash storybook,
like cinematic style.

39
00:02:38,770 --> 00:02:43,750
Even the 40 aspect ratio of the 19
thirties that he uses for the part of

40
00:02:43,751 --> 00:02:48,320
the story that is set in that time
period works excellent for symmetric

41
00:02:48,340 --> 00:02:51,910
shots.
This is all even further complemented by

42
00:02:51,911 --> 00:02:55,690
the dialogue.
Once you Gustaf especially converses in

43
00:02:55,691 --> 00:02:58,990
an elegant aristocratic way which is in
tune.

44
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:01,450
The magical world that is created

45
00:03:02,270 --> 00:03:05,120
rudeness is merely the expression of
fear.

46
00:03:05,540 --> 00:03:07,400
People fear they won't get what they
want.

47
00:03:07,790 --> 00:03:11,780
The most dreadful and unattractive
person earlier needs to be loved and

48
00:03:11,781 --> 00:03:15,500
they will open up like a flower.
I'm reminded of a verse.

49
00:03:15,980 --> 00:03:18,620
The painter's brush touch the incubate
phase,

50
00:03:18,890 --> 00:03:22,920
ends of Nimble bristles and color.
Granted,

51
00:03:22,930 --> 00:03:23,810
her life is cheap.

52
00:03:24,730 --> 00:03:28,900
The danger of this or wherever it is
that this dialogue cool to receive the

53
00:03:28,901 --> 00:03:33,901
same critique as wes Anderson cinematic
style often does that it is pretentious

54
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:40,060
and listen solstice by frequently having
mature Gustaf breaking as elegant.

55
00:03:40,061 --> 00:03:42,190
Speaking with a more professional tone.

56
00:03:42,890 --> 00:03:45,380
I've never seen her like that before.
No,

57
00:03:45,381 --> 00:03:48,140
sir.
She was shaking like a shitting dog.

58
00:03:50,030 --> 00:03:50,863
Truly,

59
00:03:51,210 --> 00:03:55,680
this creates comedic moments and serves
as a wink to the audience.

60
00:03:55,770 --> 00:03:58,610
It shows an awareness of the
criticalness style

61
00:03:59,650 --> 00:04:04,390
you see that are still glimmers of
civilization left and this barbaric

62
00:04:04,391 --> 00:04:06,490
slaughter house that was once known as
humanity.

63
00:04:07,030 --> 00:04:08,800
Indeed,
that's what we provide in our own

64
00:04:08,830 --> 00:04:10,060
modest,
humble,

65
00:04:10,150 --> 00:04:12,810
insignificant.
Okay.

66
00:04:15,570 --> 00:04:19,710
Another problem is that by drawing
attention to a cinematic style,

67
00:04:19,711 --> 00:04:22,950
wes Anderson,
districts and distances to audience from

68
00:04:22,951 --> 00:04:25,410
the emotional lives of the characters on
screen.

69
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:30,560
Most of innocence films are a mixture of
tragedy and comedy is cinematic style

70
00:04:31,411 --> 00:04:35,160
works perfectly for comedic purposes.
For example,

71
00:04:35,190 --> 00:04:37,650
I think people entered a frame in many
ways,

72
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:41,970
just like Edgar Wright sometimes does
birth more central to establish our.

73
00:04:41,971 --> 00:04:44,490
His tracking shots is tableau shots.

74
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:48,390
He's a ruthless adventure of a con
artist who preys on mentally sick.

75
00:04:48,391 --> 00:04:53,070
Old Ladies probably box them to bed with
all my friends.

76
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:07,700
This tableau shot of mature Gustaf in
Jill created an absurdity death folks

77
00:05:07,820 --> 00:05:11,210
after birth.
It also distracts from the seriousness

78
00:05:11,211 --> 00:05:15,650
of his situation because when it comes
to more serious emotional moments,

79
00:05:15,651 --> 00:05:19,550
it is precisely this kind of shot that
can distance the audience from the

80
00:05:19,551 --> 00:05:22,160
characters.
In previous movies,

81
00:05:22,161 --> 00:05:26,090
Edison therefore returned to cinematic
techniques outside of his own style.

82
00:05:26,150 --> 00:05:28,430
During these moments,
for example,

83
00:05:28,431 --> 00:05:32,900
he returns to the more conventional over
the shoulder shots in moonrise kingdom.

84
00:05:32,901 --> 00:05:37,901
When Sam and Susie confessed the love
for each other as bought all states at

85
00:05:38,271 --> 00:05:41,570
an emotional peak,
innocence sharply violates the film's

86
00:05:41,571 --> 00:05:44,690
intrinsic norm by bringing in their
common technique.

87
00:05:45,110 --> 00:05:48,110
West Emerson doesn't do this in the
Grand Budapest hotel,

88
00:05:48,111 --> 00:05:51,240
however,
birth uses lighting color and some

89
00:05:51,740 --> 00:05:55,940
techniques that fit within this
intrinsic style to convey important

90
00:05:55,941 --> 00:06:00,050
emotional moments.
The audience in this tableau shots,

91
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:04,550
a lighting change signifies that a more
serious moment is about to happen,

92
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:08,700
and another line inq combined with a
closeup focuses on the tears.

93
00:06:08,950 --> 00:06:09,950
Old Zero.

94
00:06:10,090 --> 00:06:11,170
You see,
I never speak to him,

95
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:15,070
I guess because even the thought of her
name,

96
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:20,520
I'm unable to control my emotions.
Well,

97
00:06:21,631 --> 00:06:23,100
I suppose there's no way around it.

98
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:27,930
In a similar way,
a shelter is to convey Agatha so love of

99
00:06:27,931 --> 00:06:32,760
serious life center usher in a close up
with soft lighting and light circling

100
00:06:32,761 --> 00:06:36,960
binder.
Wes Anderson also use objects and

101
00:06:36,990 --> 00:06:41,990
positioning to convey emotional cues
when we see more sugary stuff in his

102
00:06:42,481 --> 00:06:45,660
solitary small room where he eats dinner
alone,

103
00:06:45,661 --> 00:06:48,370
which is a break with the royal elegant
self-assured,

104
00:06:48,390 --> 00:06:50,940
Short speaking persona of material
stuff.

105
00:06:51,180 --> 00:06:53,890
The camera lights over a couple of
bottles layer,

106
00:06:53,891 --> 00:06:58,890
the peneche his favorite perfume.
Perfume is this part of his more

107
00:06:58,891 --> 00:07:03,540
intimate and it's rather lonely
personality when he shares this perfume

108
00:07:03,541 --> 00:07:08,541
with zero does signify serious access to
star spiritual world and their deep

109
00:07:09,271 --> 00:07:10,104
friendship.

110
00:07:10,620 --> 00:07:14,690
I owe you my life.
You are my dear friend and process.

111
00:07:15,340 --> 00:07:16,310
Every private,
if you.

112
00:07:16,710 --> 00:07:20,510
You must admit.
I'm so sorry he's here.

113
00:07:22,790 --> 00:07:23,623
We're brothers.

114
00:07:26,460 --> 00:07:29,730
We can also see this in their positions
in the frame,

115
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:33,450
in the beginning of the film,
zero is often seen in the background.

116
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:36,750
While most sugar stuff,
the more dominating character at that

117
00:07:36,751 --> 00:07:40,380
point is shown larger and closer to the
front of the frame.

118
00:07:40,710 --> 00:07:45,030
The same compositional structure can be
seen with the antagonist of the film

119
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:48,780
birth with regards to Ciro and more good
stuff.

120
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:51,630
Later in the film,
their friendship develops and they

121
00:07:51,631 --> 00:07:54,380
become more equals zero rescue of
material,

122
00:07:54,430 --> 00:07:58,020
good stuff from jail.
We see this shift within the mission

123
00:07:58,050 --> 00:08:01,290
seven s,
they both now shared frame more equally

124
00:08:01,780 --> 00:08:05,880
yet it's the most clear example where
wes Anderson cues and important

125
00:08:05,881 --> 00:08:09,930
emotional moments too.
Cinematic style is in the train scene

126
00:08:09,931 --> 00:08:13,560
near the end.
This scene is similar to an earlier

127
00:08:13,561 --> 00:08:16,680
train scene,
yet completely different where the first

128
00:08:16,681 --> 00:08:21,450
train scene is shown in warm colors and
there was room for comedic moments.

129
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:25,120
It's not a very flattering portrait.
I'm afraid I was once considered a great

130
00:08:25,130 --> 00:08:29,400
but
wants the f stand for Fritz France,

131
00:08:29,860 --> 00:08:31,520
France.
I knew it.

132
00:08:31,830 --> 00:08:36,390
West End Shin shows the later train
scene in black and white to convey what

133
00:08:36,391 --> 00:08:41,391
would be one of the saddest days of life
when will show stuff is shoved debt.

134
00:08:43,390 --> 00:08:46,680
What happened in the end and the and

135
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:51,680
they shot him.
The grants Budapest hotel signifies,

136
00:08:52,341 --> 00:08:56,100
I think the peak of West innocence
ability folk,

137
00:08:56,101 --> 00:09:01,101
both comedy as emotional strategy to his
own distinctive cinematic style.

138
00:09:02,130 --> 00:09:05,460
The film is a wonderful mix of charm,
humor,

139
00:09:05,461 --> 00:09:10,461
and sadness accumulation off west
innocence work as a director and writer

140
00:09:11,490 --> 00:09:16,490
that will make you want to revisit the
Grand Budapest hotel again and again and

141
00:09:17,910 --> 00:09:22,910
again and again,
thank you so much for watching.

142
00:09:26,710 --> 00:09:31,480
And every time I see this film I
appreciated more and more and it is

143
00:09:31,481 --> 00:09:34,930
slowly turning into one of my favorite
films ever.
