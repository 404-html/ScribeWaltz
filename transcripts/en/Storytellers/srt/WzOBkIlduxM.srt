Thank you to audible for sponsoring this
video.

00:00:08,200 --> 00:00:09,450
Guys,

3
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:19,060
early in May,
the German offensive began along the

4
00:00:19,061 --> 00:00:21,450
front extending from course the prime
area.

5
00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:35,250
More of the world was afraid.
Russian campaigns have been smaller,

6
00:00:35,251 --> 00:00:37,660
but Germans were the span threshold
would

7
00:00:39,160 --> 00:00:44,160
still fail to simultaneous attacks from
the north,

8
00:00:45,030 --> 00:00:48,650
from the south
was tussled with the banks.

9
00:00:50,220 --> 00:00:52,530
We're getting castle instead of the
Russians

10
00:00:54,740 --> 00:00:59,130
are not only a field barney,
he lost his firearm.

11
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:04,900
One million,
one hundred ninety three thousand five

12
00:01:04,900 --> 00:01:07,320
hundred twenty five million,
800,000.

13
00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:25,100
I just
wanted him because he looked get it,

14
00:01:27,370 --> 00:01:28,800
but she wouldn't be tufted veal.

15
00:01:52,580 --> 00:01:57,410
This is the story of Stalingrad.
This is a story of Stalingrad.

16
00:01:57,950 --> 00:02:02,810
This is the story of Stalingrad,
the story of honorable but naive German

17
00:02:02,811 --> 00:02:05,660
men.
The story of the Soviet fighting spirit

18
00:02:05,661 --> 00:02:09,770
against a brutal enemy,
the story of the victims of a regime

19
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:13,940
during the heroes of their country.
The sort of conflicting stories of

20
00:02:13,941 --> 00:02:14,774
Stalingrad

21
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:29,800
eat mgm and what is that you've asked
them in Manhattan,

22
00:02:34,750 --> 00:02:39,420
is a charging through the heart of the
Soviet Union towards the oil fields of

23
00:02:39,421 --> 00:02:42,690
Asia.
One last obstacle remains.

24
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:48,520
Yeah.
My

25
00:03:24,990 --> 00:03:29,990
vehicle,
which

26
00:03:46,710 --> 00:03:48,710
may
decide

27
00:03:50,510 --> 00:03:52,810
to
get

28
00:03:55,090 --> 00:03:59,030
it,
hopefully

29
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:51,100
I'm annoyed with Sasha for not staying
at home,

30
00:04:51,101 --> 00:04:56,101
has it made you swear to do it?
I'm going to have to do,

31
00:05:43,770 --> 00:05:48,770
which
is kind of minded.

32
00:05:56,090 --> 00:06:01,090
She's making these cleansing plans
to have him come on and

33
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:13,000
try
when you show them

34
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:21,470
intake
to called Leonardo,

35
00:06:22,540 --> 00:06:27,540
we should trust the instate
managed to lead us to victory.

36
00:06:38,980 --> 00:06:43,980
Now,
whatever

37
00:07:32,810 --> 00:07:37,810
the
city

38
00:07:56,390 --> 00:07:59,660
styling,
styling Grad,

39
00:09:07,860 --> 00:09:12,860
no,
just always happening.

40
00:09:46,870 --> 00:09:50,600
Deport the families of the.
I

41
00:09:52,290 --> 00:09:56,130
have no illusions.
That's the learning to socialism in

42
00:09:56,131 --> 00:10:01,131
universal bliss.
Wow.

43
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:18,560
There's always something to
give it up.

44
00:10:47,330 --> 00:10:50,710
He was under the foot soldier,
wasn't worth giving away my position.

45
00:10:55,140 --> 00:11:00,140
Did we just see the dealership
to

46
00:11:24,830 --> 00:11:29,000
the battle of Stalingrad remains such an
ideologically charged and symbolically

47
00:11:29,001 --> 00:11:32,990
important subject that the last word
will not be heard for many years,

48
00:11:33,230 --> 00:11:37,040
and therefore the story of Stalingrad is
to German story of coping with the

49
00:11:37,041 --> 00:11:40,850
darkest chapter in its history.
Attempting to redeem a disgrace

50
00:11:40,851 --> 00:11:44,570
generation by putting the burden of
guilt on those in a position of power.

51
00:11:45,170 --> 00:11:48,710
It's the Russian memory of the patriotic
war against a brutal enemy.

52
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:51,170
His statement for to resolve with the
Red Army,

53
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:55,330
but it's also the western Narrative
Stalin Grad as a struggle for markable

54
00:11:55,331 --> 00:11:58,540
victims,
caught in between two murderous regimes,

55
00:11:59,060 --> 00:12:02,410
more so than actually capturing the
history of or attempting to portray

56
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:05,200
these narratives.
Leave us with a broad variety of

57
00:12:05,201 --> 00:12:09,460
symbolic perspectives on the battle
perspectives that reveal how to involve

58
00:12:09,461 --> 00:12:11,620
countries,
choose to understand their past,

59
00:12:12,010 --> 00:12:16,510
showcasing the subjectivity inherent in
our perception of history and now did

60
00:12:16,511 --> 00:12:19,570
our post memory of the war is becoming
increasingly reliant,

61
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:21,490
unmediated images of the past.

62
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:26,350
The question that arises then is to what
degree evil or cinema and our media both

63
00:12:26,351 --> 00:12:31,210
consciously and unconsciously influence
and perhaps reshape how we come to view

64
00:12:31,211 --> 00:12:33,940
to war in the best in general through
day,

65
00:12:33,941 --> 00:12:38,290
broaden our perspective and help keep
the history alive or are they bound to

66
00:12:38,291 --> 00:12:42,040
distort and revise the actual history in
the minds of the viewer.

67
00:12:42,700 --> 00:12:45,070
Whatever your opinion on the matter may
be.

68
00:12:45,220 --> 00:12:48,390
The film's about styling garage.
Showcase how both filmmakers,

69
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:50,620
storytellers,
and audiences alike.

70
00:12:50,770 --> 00:12:53,860
Shoot at the very least,
be aware of the implications of boasts

71
00:12:53,861 --> 00:12:56,380
memory.
Constructed through two perspectives of

72
00:12:56,381 --> 00:13:00,880
works of fiction and to be mindful of
what we're trying to say and what we're

73
00:13:00,881 --> 00:13:02,470
being shown about our history.

74
00:13:07,810 --> 00:13:11,650
