Thank you to skillshare for sponsoring
this video.

2
00:00:16,840 --> 00:00:21,120
The clash of giant men and monsters is
eight powerful image that has a beard in

3
00:00:21,121 --> 00:00:24,270
many religion,
mythology and forth till throughout the

4
00:00:24,271 --> 00:00:27,420
ancient world,
and it's a concept that in our secular,

5
00:00:27,421 --> 00:00:31,050
modern world continues to live on in the
somewhat different form.

6
00:00:35,230 --> 00:00:39,640
Guillermo del Toro specific written is
one of those manifestations and although

7
00:00:39,641 --> 00:00:42,880
at very consciously embraces the
silliness of the genre,

8
00:00:43,060 --> 00:00:46,810
it nonetheless managers do transcend the
cliche by hinting edits,

9
00:00:46,811 --> 00:00:51,811
very deep symbolic patterns of society
and the individual of how a world or a

10
00:00:52,571 --> 00:00:57,490
center can come both to be destroyed and
reborn on the edge or the rim of the

11
00:00:57,491 --> 00:00:58,324
world.

12
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:07,680
Yeah.

13
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:10,740
To begin with,
the story gives us a mythological

14
00:01:10,741 --> 00:01:15,260
version of the modern world.
Deep in the Pacific Ocean appears a riff

15
00:01:15,261 --> 00:01:20,261
to a dark dimension of giant monsters.
We rubbed out of the water as out of

16
00:01:20,671 --> 00:01:25,671
primordial chaos.
The fact that the rift manifests in the

17
00:01:25,830 --> 00:01:28,980
Pacific Ocean is not arbitrary because
according to how we have mapped in

18
00:01:28,981 --> 00:01:32,160
organize the world,
even though the world is a globe,

19
00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:36,990
it is nonetheless there in the Pacific
Ocean that the rim of the world is

20
00:01:36,991 --> 00:01:41,991
located where East becomes west,
where time jumps from one day to

21
00:01:42,031 --> 00:01:45,690
another.
Her rift in spaced imaged as the gate of

22
00:01:45,691 --> 00:01:48,560
Haiti's out of which chaos and death
erupt,

23
00:01:50,030 --> 00:01:52,820
and so following the analogy,
the edge,

24
00:01:53,060 --> 00:01:57,320
the rim of the world in terms of space
is also where appears the possible end

25
00:01:57,321 --> 00:02:01,280
of the world as cataclysmic destruction
of all civilization.

26
00:02:03,860 --> 00:02:08,860
The possibility of the end appears in
the form of the Kaijene we're emerging

27
00:02:09,171 --> 00:02:13,910
out of the water are monsters in the
fullest sense of that word depicted here

28
00:02:13,911 --> 00:02:18,911
as undefinable hybrid creatures mixtures
of humanized forms and diverse animal

29
00:02:20,151 --> 00:02:23,270
characteristics.
They remind us of the universal sea

30
00:02:23,271 --> 00:02:27,740
monster that has appeared all over the
world in the form of the Leviathan,

31
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:30,740
the Crackin,
trib dis are Cilla.

32
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:35,510
All of these creatures come together as
a representation of chaos and the

33
00:02:35,511 --> 00:02:39,140
destructive forces of nature.
As rally points out,

34
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:42,210
there are things you can fight,
acts of God.

35
00:02:42,630 --> 00:02:46,490
You see a hurricane coming,
you have to get out of the way for when

36
00:02:46,491 --> 00:02:50,700
you're in a yeager,
suddenly you can fight the art game.

37
00:02:51,570 --> 00:02:52,403
You can win.

38
00:02:53,510 --> 00:02:55,220
However,
the eruption of chaos,

39
00:02:55,221 --> 00:02:58,880
which happens on the edge is not just
accidental,

40
00:02:59,020 --> 00:03:03,970
but simultaneously appears as an
invasion of a foreign race of aliens

41
00:03:04,210 --> 00:03:08,680
because if what lies outside the wall of
the city is the danger of the natural

42
00:03:08,681 --> 00:03:11,770
world,
it is also the unknown stranger as

43
00:03:11,771 --> 00:03:15,400
possible invader.
And so unlike other movie monsters such

44
00:03:15,401 --> 00:03:18,280
as Godzilla who represents rod
destruction,

45
00:03:19,330 --> 00:03:22,030
the Kyde,
you linked several aspects of the rim

46
00:03:22,390 --> 00:03:26,590
and the periphery together linking
closer to cosmic symbolism,

47
00:03:26,710 --> 00:03:29,440
the somewhat humanoid forms of these
monsters.

48
00:03:29,441 --> 00:03:34,210
The fact that they often walk on two
legs also links the more general sea

49
00:03:34,211 --> 00:03:39,211
monster to the image of the clash of
titans or the giants which appear in

50
00:03:40,181 --> 00:03:43,930
almost all cultures as preceding the
civilized world.

51
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:49,440
Having had to be defeated in a war or
destroyed in a flood in order to make

52
00:03:49,601 --> 00:03:54,601
way for a current age and just like the
ancient ages of giants founding myth,

53
00:03:55,180 --> 00:03:58,390
we're told the dinosaurs were Kaijene as
well,

54
00:03:59,020 --> 00:04:03,670
linking the edge of the world where
chaos erupts with an ancient forgotten

55
00:04:03,671 --> 00:04:05,560
time populated by monster

56
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:11,930
to answer this unending emergence of
chaos from the rim.

57
00:04:12,170 --> 00:04:17,120
Humanity joins hands to bring forth an
army of giant human controlled robots or

58
00:04:17,150 --> 00:04:20,540
yeager's.
But what makes it so intuitively right

59
00:04:20,541 --> 00:04:24,140
that Earth's line of defense should come
in the form of a giant man.

60
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:28,460
The strange satisfaction of the Mecca
robot is that it is a man that the skill

61
00:04:28,461 --> 00:04:33,020
of society at giant weapon to defend the
world and vision as the physical

62
00:04:33,021 --> 00:04:35,900
embodiment of the spirit,
which represents a communion.

63
00:04:36,260 --> 00:04:39,760
It's the image of the Saint Michael
figure who brings order food defeating

64
00:04:39,761 --> 00:04:42,950
to gray dragon of chaos by slashing him
with his sword.

65
00:04:43,580 --> 00:04:46,280
It's division of the giant man
representing the community and if the

66
00:04:46,281 --> 00:04:49,970
Commonwealth represented and Thomas
Hobbes own version of the Leviathan.

67
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:54,260
This premise of the Jaeger as the
embodiment of communion appears.

68
00:04:54,261 --> 00:04:56,630
First of all,
in the name of the yeager leader

69
00:04:56,750 --> 00:05:01,640
Marshall Pentecost for pentecost as to
possibility of finding unity among

70
00:05:01,641 --> 00:05:05,810
diversity when the Holy Spirit made it
possible for people with all languages

71
00:05:05,811 --> 00:05:10,070
to understand each other and so to the
Jaeger program has shown as diverse

72
00:05:10,071 --> 00:05:14,930
peoples and cultures joining together to
fight a common enemy or more succinctly.

73
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:19,010
The very efficiency of the yeager.
Robots depends on two or more people

74
00:05:19,011 --> 00:05:23,690
coming together into perfect unity,
communing or drifting together with all

75
00:05:23,691 --> 00:05:25,190
their memories,
their faults,

76
00:05:25,191 --> 00:05:29,120
and with all their willpower.
Like any society or people who share a

77
00:05:29,121 --> 00:05:32,240
common identity like the two sides of a
brain,

78
00:05:32,450 --> 00:05:35,330
like the opposites which characterize
the human person,

79
00:05:35,660 --> 00:05:38,990
creativity and discipline,
justice and mercy,

80
00:05:39,350 --> 00:05:42,020
freedom and submission to societal
norms.

81
00:05:42,170 --> 00:05:43,900
It's not obvious.
It is Mr [inaudible].

82
00:05:48,060 --> 00:05:50,820
He defensive.
Unity can only be possible when

83
00:05:50,821 --> 00:05:54,210
opposites come together into focus and
common purpose,

84
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:57,150
but the Jaeger is not only an image of
communion,

85
00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:01,730
but an image of the edge itself,
an extension of technology as the

86
00:06:01,731 --> 00:06:05,930
expansion of human capacity.
Clothing is the most primordial image of

87
00:06:05,931 --> 00:06:09,410
technology.
The most immediate gloving is protection

88
00:06:09,411 --> 00:06:13,730
of weakness and increase in the power to
master to hostilities of the outside,

89
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:17,840
so like a giant night of cosmic
proportions,

90
00:06:17,870 --> 00:06:20,900
the yeager's,
both an armor and a weapon which can

91
00:06:20,901 --> 00:06:24,860
move into the periphery to meet the
challenge which appears on the edge

92
00:06:29,510 --> 00:06:33,110
in their status and in the expression of
the characters.

93
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:38,120
The Jager team itself has depicted as
representatives of the margin.

94
00:06:38,750 --> 00:06:42,280
They are the exception.
They are a rag tag group of drift

95
00:06:42,281 --> 00:06:47,281
compatible couples and they are pushed
out of the center and discarded when in

96
00:06:47,901 --> 00:06:52,901
their overconfidence things start to go
downhill and a society now ops to hide

97
00:06:53,571 --> 00:06:56,870
from chaos behind a giant sea wall
instead.

98
00:06:57,500 --> 00:07:02,270
Visually the move towards the edge is
represented as a descent.

99
00:07:02,660 --> 00:07:07,130
This image is repeated over and over.
The head of the Jager with its human

100
00:07:07,131 --> 00:07:12,131
agents descend unto the body than the
Jager is dropped into the waters and

101
00:07:12,470 --> 00:07:17,470
ultimately the jager moves to the bottom
of the ocean floor in order to descend

102
00:07:17,750 --> 00:07:21,140
even into the pit,
into the chaos of the underworld where

103
00:07:21,141 --> 00:07:22,370
the monsters come from

104
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:27,730
and where to yeager's were at first part
of the military hierarchy of the center.

105
00:07:28,090 --> 00:07:32,200
They now adopt an identity more closely
aligned with the hybrid heroes at the

106
00:07:32,201 --> 00:07:36,970
frontier and they haven't been sort of
the graded into the resistance and I

107
00:07:36,971 --> 00:07:41,971
have them talk in the language of a
western Marshall Ryder outpost,

108
00:07:42,550 --> 00:07:45,100
Jaeger jokey.
You'll see when they moved,

109
00:07:45,101 --> 00:07:48,190
they sound like cowboys instead of
dealing with governments,

110
00:07:48,191 --> 00:07:51,970
they are now forced to do business with
those that dwell in the shadows in

111
00:07:51,971 --> 00:07:54,310
between worlds.
This in between.

112
00:07:54,311 --> 00:07:57,860
This is also noticeable in the
resemblance of the yeager and decayed

113
00:07:57,910 --> 00:08:01,540
you firstly in their name,
which are permutations of each other,

114
00:08:01,870 --> 00:08:06,010
but also in their mirrored appearance as
giant extensions of their societies

115
00:08:06,011 --> 00:08:08,950
engineered by either side to fight
monsters.

116
00:08:09,670 --> 00:08:12,910
We created monsters of our own,
the yeager's,

117
00:08:12,911 --> 00:08:15,850
our emissaries and guardians of order.
On the one hand,

118
00:08:16,300 --> 00:08:18,820
but as giant weapons of nuclear
proportions.

119
00:08:18,820 --> 00:08:21,310
They also like the hive mind control
guide.

120
00:08:21,311 --> 00:08:25,810
You embodied it potential for mass
destruction and here in lies both the

121
00:08:25,811 --> 00:08:30,400
necessity and the danger of the descend
in order to effectively overcome the

122
00:08:30,430 --> 00:08:34,540
unending destruction caused by the riff.
The yeager crews are forced to both

123
00:08:34,541 --> 00:08:37,930
voluntarily and involuntarily be touched
by chaos.

124
00:08:38,290 --> 00:08:42,190
Riley loses his brother and this left
with a print of the cage he was making

125
00:08:42,191 --> 00:08:45,160
on his body,
causing him to resigned to a red or

126
00:08:45,161 --> 00:08:48,190
meaningless life behind the wall.
His partner,

127
00:08:48,191 --> 00:08:49,570
Mako,
on the other hand,

128
00:08:49,571 --> 00:08:52,750
is touched by the chaos of the Chi Jew
and a more mental way,

129
00:08:53,050 --> 00:08:55,740
which takes the form of a severe
childhood trauma,

130
00:08:55,741 --> 00:08:59,820
which has controlled her life in a quest
for vengeance that almost leads or to

131
00:08:59,821 --> 00:09:03,150
point a gun at her own kind.
Decreased scientist.

132
00:09:03,151 --> 00:09:04,380
Newton,
on the other hand,

133
00:09:04,381 --> 00:09:07,500
Holt's an unhealthy desire to be
connected with the guide you,

134
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:11,370
which consequently leads into learn the
secret of their origin,

135
00:09:11,610 --> 00:09:15,750
but it paradoxically also gives them the
information they need to figure out the

136
00:09:15,751 --> 00:09:19,380
intentions of the Jaegers as well as his
own present location.

137
00:09:19,630 --> 00:09:20,080
It's

138
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:25,080
fighting chaos on the edge in this
dissent in which we can both obtain the

139
00:09:25,511 --> 00:09:28,120
power and the knowledge to emerge
victorious,

140
00:09:28,570 --> 00:09:33,550
but in which there's also the danger of
becoming consumed by it perishing or

141
00:09:33,551 --> 00:09:37,840
even reemerging as the very same thing
we had wanted to overcome.

142
00:09:38,890 --> 00:09:39,723
Okay.

143
00:09:40,330 --> 00:09:43,490
In the end,
the men and women of the Jaeger program

144
00:09:43,491 --> 00:09:48,410
have to consciously find a balance on
this slippery slope in between order and

145
00:09:48,411 --> 00:09:50,990
chaos,
and it's not only in the balance that's

146
00:09:50,991 --> 00:09:54,230
found in this relationship or this
harmony of opposites,

147
00:09:54,350 --> 00:09:58,250
but it's the individual as the place
where unity and resolution finder most

148
00:09:58,251 --> 00:10:01,580
immediate form.
All of these characters have to reassess

149
00:10:01,581 --> 00:10:05,480
their opinions and their compulsions in
order to to get our take up the sword.

150
00:10:05,481 --> 00:10:10,481
One last time
in this final clash,

151
00:10:13,161 --> 00:10:15,410
they learned that it is not only an
opposition,

152
00:10:15,411 --> 00:10:19,220
that the guide you are to be defeated.
It's by merging with them in a strange

153
00:10:19,221 --> 00:10:23,330
manner that unlocks the gate for a
yeager to make it's final descend into

154
00:10:23,331 --> 00:10:26,060
the underworld.
This descend into the underworld can be

155
00:10:26,061 --> 00:10:31,061
seen as the embracing of chaos without
being defeated by Riley writing to guide

156
00:10:31,311 --> 00:10:32,400
you in to the rift.

157
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:35,510
This like Gandalf riding the Balrog
through the Ebis,

158
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:39,860
and ultimately it is an image of Christ,
descendants who Haiti's and ultimate

159
00:10:39,861 --> 00:10:43,100
resurrection,
his trampling down death by death.

160
00:10:43,310 --> 00:10:46,490
It's this voluntary acceptance of the
existence of chaos,

161
00:10:46,491 --> 00:10:50,000
both without and within and coming
together in communion.

162
00:10:50,001 --> 00:10:52,790
Despite that,
that the last act of courage and

163
00:10:52,791 --> 00:10:57,560
sacrifice culminates into a single act
of the human person in a moment of

164
00:10:57,561 --> 00:11:01,160
solitude,
destroying the power of the underworld

165
00:11:01,161 --> 00:11:05,780
and finally closing to rift the return
to the surface as dare for shown as a

166
00:11:05,781 --> 00:11:08,600
rebirth,
as the emergence of a new world free

167
00:11:08,601 --> 00:11:12,590
from the madness of destruction,
but also the rebirth into a world where

168
00:11:12,591 --> 00:11:17,591
the two opposites of Riley and Mako find
themselves united floating on an island

169
00:11:17,601 --> 00:11:20,960
in the vast ocean.
As the final image of a new beginning.
