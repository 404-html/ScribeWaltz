00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:23,833
right?

6
00:00:26,570 --> 00:00:29,390
Politics is no longer just theater.
It's show business.

7
00:00:29,750 --> 00:00:34,280
So let's put on the best show in town.
One of the most defining aspects of

8
00:00:34,281 --> 00:00:38,630
house of cards is it's breaking of the
fourth wall inspired by Shakespeare's

9
00:00:38,631 --> 00:00:39,770
King Richard,
the third.

10
00:00:39,950 --> 00:00:44,420
Now he's the wind out of our discontent
made glorious summer.

11
00:00:44,660 --> 00:00:49,070
This method of directly addressing the
audience is very effective in pulling

12
00:00:49,071 --> 00:00:52,680
the audience closer towards the inner
thoughts and motivations of the main

13
00:00:52,681 --> 00:00:54,770
character.
For those of us climbing

14
00:00:54,980 --> 00:00:58,010
top of the food chain,
there can be no mercy.

15
00:00:58,670 --> 00:01:03,020
There is but one hunt or be hunted

16
00:01:04,020 --> 00:01:06,920
and house of cards.
This method is used to call Faye the

17
00:01:06,921 --> 00:01:11,280
dual polarity between frank underwood's
inner thoughts and his personality and

18
00:01:11,281 --> 00:01:14,910
his outwards behavior.
The image he constructs of himself.

19
00:01:15,170 --> 00:01:19,360
We have to hold this sticky fingers and
wipe the filthy mouth.

20
00:01:20,150 --> 00:01:23,880
Teach them right from wrong.
Tell them what to sync and how to see

21
00:01:23,881 --> 00:01:24,830
you and what do we want.

22
00:01:25,450 --> 00:01:29,280
This is central to what makes the show
so successful as a hyper reps inflation

23
00:01:29,540 --> 00:01:33,450
or free or America politics as our
colleagues at waste cracker,

24
00:01:33,451 --> 00:01:37,960
if bonded hours to officials in house of
cards often focus on theater,

25
00:01:37,961 --> 00:01:42,310
aesthetics and art because this points
to the fundamental concepts that

26
00:01:42,311 --> 00:01:46,120
appearance drives politics.
Politics is performance.

27
00:01:46,510 --> 00:01:51,010
It is no coincidence that David fincher
is the executive producer and director

28
00:01:51,011 --> 00:01:55,660
of the first two episodes of the show.
His camera movements are always smooth,

29
00:01:55,690 --> 00:01:57,850
precise,
and in his own words,

30
00:01:57,880 --> 00:02:01,420
moving perfectly.
A screen prison points out the color

31
00:02:01,421 --> 00:02:04,630
Palette of the show is dark,
representing the underworld that the

32
00:02:04,631 --> 00:02:09,610
underwoods move in and to cold blue and
warm yellow color contrasts represents

33
00:02:09,611 --> 00:02:12,640
the pool between human warmness and
Colton ambition.

34
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:17,230
The composition is precise and set
designers thorough the way fincher

35
00:02:17,231 --> 00:02:21,130
carefully constructed images to look
perfectly stands parallel to the way

36
00:02:21,131 --> 00:02:24,250
frank and Claire Underwood Catholic
constructor own images,

37
00:02:24,460 --> 00:02:25,450
images,
of course,

38
00:02:25,451 --> 00:02:28,230
that height a darker reality.
That's right.

39
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:36,360
We don't submit the terror.
We make the terror.

40
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:46,920
Politics as theater is a criticism of
many contemporary scholars on bill life,

41
00:02:46,931 --> 00:02:51,931
American politics just as to underwoods
image s carefully crafted and managed

42
00:02:52,090 --> 00:02:53,650
from Cuba.
Tucsdon speeches,

43
00:02:53,710 --> 00:02:56,560
live free or die,
live free or die

44
00:02:59,420 --> 00:03:00,000
two well,
it's

45
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,770
kind of hairstyle or dress,
claire,

46
00:03:01,771 --> 00:03:05,730
where's the same is true for real life.
American politicians,

47
00:03:05,910 --> 00:03:10,650
so called establishment politicians on
both sides of the aisle tend to adopt

48
00:03:10,660 --> 00:03:14,010
few points that resonate with the
biggest part of that base.

49
00:03:14,130 --> 00:03:16,270
You were against same sex marriage.
Now your Ford,

50
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:18,720
you defended President Obama's
immigration policies.

51
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:22,000
Now you're saying they're too harsh.
He supported his trade deal dozens of

52
00:03:22,001 --> 00:03:24,280
times.
You can call it the gold standard now

53
00:03:24,310 --> 00:03:27,570
suddenly last week you're against it.
When you say anything to get elected,

54
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:32,360
they carefully avoid any controversy and
use catch phrases and slogans instead of

55
00:03:32,361 --> 00:03:35,690
discussing nuance issues,
honestly and intellectually,

56
00:03:35,940 --> 00:03:40,940
but I've tried to figure out how we get
them to have pokemon go to the polls

57
00:03:43,430 --> 00:03:47,570
and we are going to make our country
great again.

58
00:03:48,290 --> 00:03:52,580
The appeal of house of cards lies in its
confirmation or for what we already

59
00:03:52,581 --> 00:03:54,950
suspect that it's behind the Catholic
cross.

60
00:03:54,951 --> 00:03:58,040
The facade or decent politics.
There is dishonesty,

61
00:03:58,041 --> 00:03:59,390
scheming,
blackmill,

62
00:03:59,510 --> 00:04:00,770
rootless power,
hunger,

63
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:04,820
and maybe even criminality,
and this is the reason the audience

64
00:04:04,821 --> 00:04:07,370
roots,
especially in the early seasons for it's

65
00:04:07,371 --> 00:04:08,780
immoral,
may character,

66
00:04:08,810 --> 00:04:12,080
frank underwood's,
he participates in a theater of

67
00:04:12,081 --> 00:04:14,780
politics.
Birth only lets the viewers into the

68
00:04:14,781 --> 00:04:18,010
real truth.
The fewer appreciates frank on the

69
00:04:18,011 --> 00:04:20,210
woods.
Authenticity in those moments of

70
00:04:20,211 --> 00:04:22,460
audience address,
even though it's authentic,

71
00:04:22,461 --> 00:04:26,210
self is deeply immoral.
The road to power is paved with them

72
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:32,800
and casualties,
never,

73
00:04:33,380 --> 00:04:34,213
right?
Correct.

74
00:04:35,210 --> 00:04:39,500
Because we disliked the hypocrisy off
this political theater so much.

75
00:04:39,530 --> 00:04:42,470
We love how frank uses it against
itself.

76
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:46,160
It does becomes clear that people are
hef and moral honesty.

77
00:04:46,220 --> 00:04:50,600
Then moral dishonesty,
we simply detests hypocrisy or fake

78
00:04:50,601 --> 00:04:54,450
morality more than authentic wickedness.
It is here to us.

79
00:04:54,451 --> 00:04:57,800
We can make a comparison to real life.
American politics,

80
00:04:57,830 --> 00:05:01,910
frank and Claire on the woods career
politician power couple dynamic has

81
00:05:01,911 --> 00:05:04,430
often been compared to that of the
Clintons.

82
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:07,430
Just as to underwoods.
The Clintons represent carefully

83
00:05:07,431 --> 00:05:11,200
constructed images and teared up
politics where the standpoints,

84
00:05:11,270 --> 00:05:15,790
they take change according to what is
most popular with the base and as the

85
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:19,310
audience of house of cards like seeing
the Ari suspected power,

86
00:05:19,311 --> 00:05:22,730
hunger and corruption behind the facade
of theater and the show,

87
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:27,170
it became increasingly clear the
citizens of the United States didn't

88
00:05:27,171 --> 00:05:30,380
trust the establishment.
Politicians like the Clintons anymore

89
00:05:30,410 --> 00:05:34,190
during the 2016 election and chose
something else.

90
00:05:34,620 --> 00:05:37,290
Sorry to keep you waiting.
Complicated business

91
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:43,290
raccoon praise that trump receives from
his fence is that at least he tells it

92
00:05:43,291 --> 00:05:45,240
like it is.
It says it like it is,

93
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:50,370
speaks to the truth.
It doesn't mean if what he says is mean

94
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:53,330
immoral or even to whether it's the
truth or not.

95
00:05:53,340 --> 00:05:56,430
I think he tells you the way he feels.
What matters is that he sees what he

96
00:05:56,431 --> 00:06:00,620
thinks filtering or changing his words
to protect this image.

97
00:06:00,780 --> 00:06:04,950
I see the political rhetoric.
Most of the politicians talk and let's

98
00:06:04,951 --> 00:06:09,840
say pastel colors.
They talk for two hours and you go away

99
00:06:09,841 --> 00:06:10,860
saying,
what did they say?

100
00:06:10,861 --> 00:06:12,300
If substance?
Probably nothing,

101
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:16,860
but they haven't offended anybody and
tried to make everybody to that friend.

102
00:06:17,430 --> 00:06:18,680
Well,
if they're passed out,

103
00:06:19,430 --> 00:06:23,670
uh,
Donald Trump is vivid colors because he

104
00:06:24,210 --> 00:06:25,340
says things away.
They are

105
00:06:25,470 --> 00:06:29,280
some fall so far outside of the
political theater that's Clinton

106
00:06:29,281 --> 00:06:33,480
represents and to United States.
Citizens starts at tie off that he

107
00:06:33,481 --> 00:06:34,510
became electable.

108
00:06:34,690 --> 00:06:39,190
It's just awfully good that someone with
the temperament of Donald Trump is not

109
00:06:39,191 --> 00:06:43,030
in charge of the law in our country
because you'd be in jail.

110
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:46,880
Since people will choose and moral
authenticity of both moral,

111
00:06:46,881 --> 00:06:50,050
a dishonesty,
are we always choosing between liars and

112
00:06:50,051 --> 00:06:53,470
crooks,
corrupt politicians and mean idiots?

113
00:06:53,710 --> 00:06:56,590
Is there a place in Washington for
authentic,

114
00:06:56,620 --> 00:06:58,990
idealistic,
honest politicians?

115
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:02,440
Welcome to the death of the age of
reason?

116
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:08,170
There is no right or wrong.
Not Anymore.

117
00:07:09,250 --> 00:07:14,200
There's only being in
and then being out.

118
00:07:15,510 --> 00:07:20,510
Can we move beyond tita politics and
into real intellectual debate where we

119
00:07:20,851 --> 00:07:24,120
argue for our fuse,
both accept each other's differences?

120
00:07:24,210 --> 00:07:29,210
Can we move to genuine politics within
the chaos off the 2016 election?

121
00:07:30,030 --> 00:07:32,400
Hope for this appeared in a curious
form.

122
00:07:32,850 --> 00:07:37,520
Various intellectuals or differing
opinion are holding civilize debates

123
00:07:37,620 --> 00:07:42,620
where the RQ genuine authentic beliefs
without constructing or protecting the

124
00:07:42,811 --> 00:07:46,020
images while also still respecting the
other.

125
00:07:46,380 --> 00:07:48,630
Yes,
although they are gaining in popularity,

126
00:07:48,631 --> 00:07:53,130
the question remains if such politics is
possible on a nationwide level.

127
00:07:53,250 --> 00:07:56,460
Since authenticity also breeds
polarization,

128
00:07:56,850 --> 00:08:01,850
can authentic politics captured the
majority of the masters or are the worst

129
00:08:02,071 --> 00:08:05,040
sites or frank on the woods the best we
can do.

130
00:08:09,340 --> 00:08:11,110
All right.
Thank you for watching everyone.

131
00:08:11,140 --> 00:08:13,750
I know this video might be pretty
polarizing,

132
00:08:13,751 --> 00:08:18,100
but I hope the common skin stay civil.

136
00:08:29,170 --> 00:08:31,120
Uh,
in the past I've had a couple scares

137
00:08:31,121 --> 00:08:33,820
around my internet security.
For example,

138
00:08:33,821 --> 00:08:38,650
with my paypal being hex,
which forced me to having to cancel my

139
00:08:38,651 --> 00:08:39,970
credit cards.
Now,

140
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:44,650
using a vpn or virtual private network
allows you to hide and protect your

141
00:08:44,651 --> 00:08:48,670
privacy and data on the Internet both
easily and safely.

142
00:08:49,180 --> 00:08:52,630
I use snore,
tpn myself and it is incredibly simple

143
00:08:52,631 --> 00:08:55,410
to use,
but don't let that fool you because

144
00:08:55,411 --> 00:08:59,970
behind the simpleness not vpn uses
military grade encryption to connect you

145
00:08:59,971 --> 00:09:04,230

it's being able to connect to the

146
00:09:04,231 --> 00:09:07,710
internet securely if I or different
places in the world is becoming

147
00:09:07,711 --> 00:09:11,460
increasingly important with increased
government surveillance,

148
00:09:11,461 --> 00:09:14,820
which has long been a hotly debated
subject in the us,

149
00:09:15,090 --> 00:09:19,620
but now also the European Union passing
incredibly restrictive copyright loss,

150
