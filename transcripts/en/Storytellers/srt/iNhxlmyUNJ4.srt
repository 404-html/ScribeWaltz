1
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:08,540
This is many of you will undoubtedly
remember.

2
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:12,230
It's the opening shot of Disney's beauty
and the beast.

3
00:00:12,560 --> 00:00:15,740
At first glance,
it's colorful ballot and introduction of

4
00:00:15,741 --> 00:00:19,460
main characters and plot points don't
seem to deviate too much from your

5
00:00:19,461 --> 00:00:22,880
typical Disney movie.
We have her princess or young adult girl

6
00:00:22,881 --> 00:00:27,881
who seeks some sort of fulfillment or
help element of magic evil forces

7
00:00:28,221 --> 00:00:32,810
working against the princess or prince
coming to the rescue and of course the

8
00:00:32,811 --> 00:00:35,030
ensuing love story.
However,

9
00:00:35,031 --> 00:00:39,380
despite first surface level impressions,
this is not at all what beauty in the

10
00:00:39,381 --> 00:00:43,660
beast is about as it goes down a wholly
different and darker path all together,

11
00:00:44,170 --> 00:00:47,780
thereby namely following the principles
of the Gothic John.

12
00:00:48,860 --> 00:00:52,070
Now it's important that we outlined the
difference between the male and the

13
00:00:52,071 --> 00:00:55,220
female gothic.
The mill variant laid the foundations

14
00:00:55,221 --> 00:00:57,170
for today's horror stories.
Wiles,

15
00:00:57,180 --> 00:01:01,040
the female version became the basis for
today's historical romance stories,

16
00:01:01,430 --> 00:01:03,830
if you will.
Version route generally feature a dark

17
00:01:03,831 --> 00:01:07,430
ass or a mansion style with looming
arches in towers,

18
00:01:07,850 --> 00:01:11,900
a young woman thesis of a dark secret to
uncover who runs away at some point

19
00:01:11,901 --> 00:01:16,160
before she discovers her own power.
A flawed romantic lead who must be

20
00:01:16,161 --> 00:01:20,540
taught how to love a rival or
alternative lead who turns out to be

21
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:23,630
evil.
And finally a happy ending through a

22
00:01:23,631 --> 00:01:25,160
process of redemption.

23
00:01:29,790 --> 00:01:34,470
Interestingly to sub genre has long been
characterized by kind of schizophrenia

24
00:01:34,830 --> 00:01:38,400
representing the female leads,
inner struggle with personality or

25
00:01:38,410 --> 00:01:42,990
conscious and unconscious fight between
conforming jurors society and breaking

26
00:01:42,991 --> 00:01:45,450
away from it.
So it's not hard to see that this is

27
00:01:45,451 --> 00:01:49,920
exactly a thing that bell attempting to
deal with in her own small town world.

28
00:01:50,190 --> 00:01:54,630
It's a theme that moves her forward and
drives her decision making and really

29
00:01:54,631 --> 00:01:57,780
encompasses the story of beauty and the
beast in its entirety.

30
00:01:58,290 --> 00:02:00,420
In fact,
I would argue that the film in itself is

31
00:02:00,421 --> 00:02:05,421
not so much about finding law in each
other as it is about finding love and

32
00:02:05,641 --> 00:02:06,990
peace in one itself.

33
00:02:14,750 --> 00:02:17,750
Well of course in order for peace to
exist,

34
00:02:17,780 --> 00:02:22,780
there also has to be war.
As the plot is breaking into its fruit,

35
00:02:23,661 --> 00:02:26,270
I climax,
we are exposed to the peak of beauty and

36
00:02:26,271 --> 00:02:29,750
the beast drama,
the final showdown between guest on his

37
00:02:29,751 --> 00:02:34,580
angry mob and the misunderstood beast.
But as exciting and funny as it may be,

38
00:02:34,581 --> 00:02:37,230
to watch the innovating villagers get
ambushed by it,

39
00:02:37,231 --> 00:02:40,040
to be stool servants.
Looking at it from an outside

40
00:02:40,041 --> 00:02:43,190
perspective also makes it undeniably
silly.

41
00:02:43,630 --> 00:02:46,040
I don't get me wrong,
you're probably thinking,

42
00:02:46,041 --> 00:02:46,821
well,
Thomas,

43
00:02:46,821 --> 00:02:48,830
why wouldn't it be?
It's a fairy tale,

44
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:51,020
and that's exactly right.
It's fantasy.

45
00:02:51,021 --> 00:02:53,120
It's a made up story,
but it's utilized.

46
00:02:53,121 --> 00:02:57,980
You convey a very real message.
One that as is not uncommon for Gothic

47
00:02:57,981 --> 00:03:01,600
novels,
exists on the interior rather than the

48
00:03:01,660 --> 00:03:06,220
exterior because the actual focus of the
story is not really the physical

49
00:03:06,221 --> 00:03:09,040
struggle of Belle and the beast to be
accepted into our world,

50
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:13,210
but rather the emotional and unconscious
struggle between the animal and human

51
00:03:13,211 --> 00:03:17,440
natures within the protagonists scene
first and the Greek myth of arrows and

52
00:03:17,470 --> 00:03:19,900
CCA,
this archetypal story deals with the

53
00:03:19,901 --> 00:03:24,400
reality of the bodied Ron Nature and
sexual side of humans on the one hand

54
00:03:24,670 --> 00:03:28,540
and the more spiritual,
rational soul on the other centuries

55
00:03:28,540 --> 00:03:29,500
later fairytales,
the big,

56
00:03:29,501 --> 00:03:33,430
the same duality and animal groom tills
in which the animal makes the life of

57
00:03:33,431 --> 00:03:38,080
the female protagonists unpleasant but
ultimately turn out to be gentlemen or

58
00:03:38,081 --> 00:03:39,460
princess in disguise.

59
00:03:39,790 --> 00:03:43,840
This recurring characterised also been
described as the image of the wild man

60
00:03:44,230 --> 00:03:48,430
who's part of an archetypal dialectic
that places wildness along with such

61
00:03:48,431 --> 00:03:53,320
things as Savitri madness,
heresy and hatred and conceptual

62
00:03:53,321 --> 00:03:58,321
antithesis to all things civilization.
Now as we look back at the story of

63
00:03:58,991 --> 00:04:01,840
beauty and the beast is dwell,
the becomes highly apparent.

64
00:04:02,290 --> 00:04:04,060
Being to wild men character and his
story.

65
00:04:04,061 --> 00:04:06,850
Beast identifies of a number of animal
motifs.

66
00:04:07,210 --> 00:04:10,660
The first and most obvious one being his
ugliness and physical appearance,

67
00:04:10,690 --> 00:04:13,420
but more importantly,
it's the realization that is hideous.

68
00:04:13,421 --> 00:04:16,660
Appearance is linked directly to his
ugly personality.

69
00:04:16,820 --> 00:04:18,010
Why isn't she here?
Yet?

70
00:04:18,370 --> 00:04:21,160
We know from the voiceover in the
beginning of the movie that he was

71
00:04:21,161 --> 00:04:24,400
spoiled,
selfish and unkind liking law.

72
00:04:24,401 --> 00:04:27,280
Then his heart,
his inner world is mirror directly to

73
00:04:27,281 --> 00:04:30,150
his surroundings as a showcase by the
constant dark and venue.

74
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:34,720
Rhetor has ravaged hidden west wing and
the existence of this tool servants

75
00:04:35,140 --> 00:04:39,520
because he who treats his fellow human
beings as tools will ultimately only see

76
00:04:39,521 --> 00:04:42,760
them as such and nothing more as a side
effect of his appearance.

77
00:04:42,761 --> 00:04:45,880
Bese also identifies with the Motif of
captivity.

78
00:04:46,070 --> 00:04:48,280
Not only does he wrongfully imprisoned
marise,

79
00:04:48,281 --> 00:04:51,910
he initially also doesn't feel remorse
for doing the same to bell.

80
00:04:52,030 --> 00:04:56,560
The for a prisoner in his castle then is
himself having drifted into apathy and

81
00:04:56,561 --> 00:04:59,290
rage over his.
Apparently he cursed fate with this

82
00:04:59,291 --> 00:05:03,700
lowly mental state comes his last Motif
nonthinking which just metaphorically

83
00:05:03,701 --> 00:05:05,610
shown here in is repressed.
The ability to

84
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:10,720
read that I can't.
It's just Ben Guest Oss

85
00:05:15,470 --> 00:05:18,090
is second carrier of the Animal Motif.
Of course,

86
00:05:18,091 --> 00:05:22,170
he starts off as what seems to be the
epitome of perfected humanity with his

87
00:05:22,171 --> 00:05:24,720
handsome looks,
strong physical appearance and

88
00:05:24,721 --> 00:05:28,770
attachment to the freedom motif.
No one says no to guests in reality.

89
00:05:28,771 --> 00:05:32,760
However,
this is only but a facade as he's

90
00:05:32,820 --> 00:05:36,690
covered with hair foreshadows the beast
thickness within his physical beauty.

91
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:42,080
Gustavo sends a freedom is also strongly
egoic and vindictive as it depends on

92
00:05:42,361 --> 00:05:47,100
its ability to control both animal as
well as human whatever the cost may be

93
00:05:48,870 --> 00:05:52,610
fun.
My wife make no mistake about that.

94
00:05:52,980 --> 00:05:57,600
It's no surprise that his character
mirroring beasts also identifies of non

95
00:05:57,601 --> 00:06:00,440
thinking and even sees it as something
malevolent.

96
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:02,060
Ooh,
I'm afraid.

97
00:06:02,061 --> 00:06:07,061
I've been thinking dangerous pastime.
I know bell on the other hand is the one

98
00:06:08,091 --> 00:06:10,940
major carrier of the human motif like a
star.

99
00:06:10,941 --> 00:06:15,110
She identifies a beauty which is really
the only thing the villagers compliment

100
00:06:15,111 --> 00:06:15,944
her for.

101
00:06:15,980 --> 00:06:16,813
There she goes,

102
00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:24,870
or oddity marks the second and third.
Once he has it showcases her sense of

103
00:06:24,871 --> 00:06:26,910
individualism and strive for freedom

104
00:06:32,020 --> 00:06:35,170
because although at the moment she's
torn between fitting in and leaving her

105
00:06:35,171 --> 00:06:38,830
provincial life behind.
She finds solace in reading a lot.

106
00:06:39,030 --> 00:06:42,040
This one,
but you've read it twice.

107
00:06:42,630 --> 00:06:46,800
Film evidently makes no secret about it
that val identify at the thinking with

108
00:06:46,801 --> 00:06:49,600
Eve,
read it and unthinking so much so it at

109
00:06:49,601 --> 00:06:53,740
her entire inner beauty and humanities
seems to originate from the archetypal

110
00:06:53,741 --> 00:06:56,020
stories she has read.
These books have taught her to

111
00:06:56,021 --> 00:07:00,130
archetypes for fighting injustice
against overwhelming odds for seeing

112
00:07:00,131 --> 00:07:04,420
beyond the surface for courage and
strength and once oddities and for

113
00:07:04,421 --> 00:07:07,660
wisdom and decision making and breaking
away from group think.

114
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:10,300
According to Carl Young,
the absolute strength of these

115
00:07:10,301 --> 00:07:14,080
archetypal stories lies in our function
as pointers to to quote unquote

116
00:07:14,081 --> 00:07:17,860
collective unconscious,
that part of self that mediates between

117
00:07:17,861 --> 00:07:22,450
our consciousness and unconsciousness,
the human and the animalistic with the

118
00:07:22,451 --> 00:07:26,890
goal to guide us towards maturity,
to bridge that internal divide.

119
00:07:26,950 --> 00:07:30,130
We see it in bell.
She's slowly developing and trying to

120
00:07:30,131 --> 00:07:33,550
figure out her own individuality,
her own uniqueness,

121
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:38,680
but paradoxically does natural process
of individuation is also at the core of

122
00:07:38,681 --> 00:07:41,950
the growing loss of the ability to live
in the present moment,

123
00:07:42,190 --> 00:07:45,130
a loss of sense of oneness in community
and to you.

124
00:07:45,131 --> 00:07:48,940
Borek force of nature as a whole now
have that knowledge in mind,

125
00:07:48,941 --> 00:07:52,030
a new door in to the uniqueness of
beauty and the beast has suddenly

126
00:07:52,031 --> 00:07:54,790
opened,
revealing to us the films function as an

127
00:07:54,791 --> 00:07:59,110
archetypal Meta narrative of sorts.
We can now see how at first be strikes a

128
00:07:59,111 --> 00:08:02,030
deal with his dwell.
He buys scapegoating and and her

129
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:05,900
awesome eat with me doesn't eat.

130
00:08:07,420 --> 00:08:10,870
We can also see how this method of
victimization has worked for guest on

131
00:08:10,890 --> 00:08:15,460
who was fully identified and content
with his ego until bell comes along,

132
00:08:15,461 --> 00:08:19,240
breaking the fragility of this illusion
and causing guest dawn's humanity to

133
00:08:19,241 --> 00:08:22,600
crumble completely as he slowly descends
into his brutish,

134
00:08:22,601 --> 00:08:25,990
animalistic nature until it ultimately
he destroys him

135
00:08:28,510 --> 00:08:31,210
glee for beasts.
The reverse happens when bell shines a

136
00:08:31,211 --> 00:08:35,050
light on his darker side and invites him
to come to terms with it through axle.

137
00:08:35,051 --> 00:08:36,790
Selflessness and honesty.

138
00:08:43,010 --> 00:08:44,730
Yes,
please.

139
00:08:44,870 --> 00:08:48,470
What happens next is the beginning of
both their transformations as beast

140
00:08:48,471 --> 00:08:52,670
rescues bell from the pack of wolves and
she in turn shoot his honor and

141
00:08:52,671 --> 00:08:55,190
compassion by saving beasts these
actions,

142
00:08:55,370 --> 00:09:00,250
bees to move away from as victimization
and to take self responsibility for the

143
00:09:00,251 --> 00:09:02,940
very first time,
which doesn't go unnoticed.

144
00:09:03,620 --> 00:09:04,453
Now he's

145
00:09:07,890 --> 00:09:12,410
why I didn't see it there before.
And out of bell two is conscious of our

146
00:09:12,411 --> 00:09:15,180
own ignorance.
The seed for their ultimate unification

147
00:09:15,181 --> 00:09:18,030
has been blended.
What follows is a process of growth and

148
00:09:18,031 --> 00:09:21,410
interplay of dwell at ease,
which ends with a dance in which animal

149
00:09:21,411 --> 00:09:24,330
and human are joined together and attack
line of the song.

150
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:29,840
Let me go skate.
Beauty.

151
00:09:30,450 --> 00:09:32,070
And the beast

152
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:35,630
is at this point that beast is ready to
make the final step in his

153
00:09:35,631 --> 00:09:39,650
transformation by show of true love,
through a dramatic act of self

154
00:09:39,651 --> 00:09:42,890
sacrifice.
And after having spent some time alone,

155
00:09:42,891 --> 00:09:47,000
bell realizes the same thing as she
kneels down beside the dying beast.

156
00:09:49,670 --> 00:09:53,420
So to spell is finally broken as both
transformations have now been completed.

157
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:57,530
And so Belle and the beast,
the human and the animal are finally

158
00:09:57,531 --> 00:10:00,650
reunited and reintegrated in coexisting
harmony.

159
00:10:00,830 --> 00:10:04,820
It's an archetypal story that has become
more relevant in today's world than it's

160
00:10:04,821 --> 00:10:08,240
probably ever been.
The upcoming and true search of social

161
00:10:08,241 --> 00:10:12,380
media and in particular dating apps,
f arguably bloated our egos and have

162
00:10:12,381 --> 00:10:16,430
degraded the concept of love and to Amir
and mindless movement off the finger.

163
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:20,360
We suppress and ignore our anxieties and
our feelings of separateness by

164
00:10:20,361 --> 00:10:24,170
connecting evermore.
Yet a lot of us can't help but feel

165
00:10:24,260 --> 00:10:28,940
meaningless alone.
It really is a continuous struggle until

166
00:10:28,941 --> 00:10:33,941
we choose to stop seeing it as such and
instead face it head on and make it into

167
00:10:33,971 --> 00:10:34,804
a dance.

168
00:10:35,060 --> 00:10:37,580
Hello,
Lee.

169
00:10:38,290 --> 00:10:39,230
Hi,
Miss.

170
00:10:39,510 --> 00:10:41,560
Follow me.

171
00:10:42,740 --> 00:10:43,700
I have no,

172
00:10:43,850 --> 00:10:45,920
a three

173
00:10:46,890 --> 00:10:48,010
for my,

174
00:10:52,170 --> 00:10:52,710
hello.
