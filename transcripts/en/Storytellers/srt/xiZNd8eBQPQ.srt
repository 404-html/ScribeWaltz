1
00:00:03,330 --> 00:00:07,170
Just as from many others.
My childhood and adolescence,

2
00:00:07,171 --> 00:00:12,171
we're in a way defines by jk rowling,
magical world of how we boller growing

3
00:00:13,141 --> 00:00:16,740
up about a year or two younger than
Harry Potter was in the books when they

4
00:00:16,741 --> 00:00:21,660
were released a reds and still reread
the magical adventure mysteries that

5
00:00:21,661 --> 00:00:26,070
went from children's books to as the
neuro titus dates increasingly dark,

6
00:00:26,071 --> 00:00:29,600
increasingly nuanced treatments of
character and blood.

7
00:00:30,090 --> 00:00:31,560
This gradual shift,
of course,

8
00:00:31,561 --> 00:00:36,120
whilst carefully planned out by jk
rowling long before she started writing,

9
00:00:36,390 --> 00:00:40,740
she spent several years carefully
constructing the full saga and writing

10
00:00:40,741 --> 00:00:45,090
extensive background stories for the
major characters before she started on

11
00:00:45,091 --> 00:00:46,680
the first book.
Now,

12
00:00:46,681 --> 00:00:51,090
rollings books are filled with
references to mythology and other

13
00:00:51,091 --> 00:00:53,670
writers.
As John granger states,

14
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:58,170
Ronin storytelling reveals traditional
artists three with symbols and themes

15
00:00:58,171 --> 00:01:01,110
borrowed from Dante Shakespeare,
the inklings,

16
00:01:01,111 --> 00:01:05,460
and other literary greats I Republican
things teams like friendship,

17
00:01:05,490 --> 00:01:08,370
good versus evil and racism and
oppression.

18
00:01:08,850 --> 00:01:12,000
However,
I want to focus on what I considered the

19
00:01:12,001 --> 00:01:14,280
two most important themes in how we
bother.

20
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:16,320
It's philosophy of laugh

21
00:01:16,950 --> 00:01:17,783
debt.

22
00:01:31,940 --> 00:01:34,370
From the very beginning.
We can see death.

23
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:39,350
Death's plays a major role in Harry
father and it becomes clear that in jk

24
00:01:39,351 --> 00:01:43,340
Rowling swirls,
death isn't seen in binary terms in the

25
00:01:43,341 --> 00:01:47,690
wizarding world to can be nuances
between being death and being alive.

26
00:01:47,930 --> 00:01:52,930
The primary example of this is of course
for the Moritz who chases immortality by

27
00:01:53,180 --> 00:01:56,420
two murder,
ripping a solo in pieces and storing

28
00:01:56,421 --> 00:02:00,830
them in valuable artifacts.
He cannot die as long as the pieces of

29
00:02:00,831 --> 00:02:04,040
his saw our bounce to earth within these
artifacts,

30
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:09,640
I think for the moth is clearly inspired
by Gothic fill such as Frankenstein

31
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:15,230
Dracula and Jacqueline and hate all our
intelligence scholars who attempt to

32
00:02:15,231 --> 00:02:18,650
meddle with the loss of nature with life
and death.

33
00:02:19,100 --> 00:02:22,540
The law for it already is strikingly
clear from the data's there,

34
00:02:22,550 --> 00:02:25,340
Carrie.
There are doctors counts and involve

35
00:02:25,341 --> 00:02:28,420
them.
Warts case a lord as John granger stays,

36
00:02:28,450 --> 00:02:31,130
they are men of my thin body.
Without spirit,

37
00:02:31,370 --> 00:02:36,370
there is no end even there.
It is out of a bow

38
00:02:43,250 --> 00:02:48,050
like many godick villains for the artist
is only concerned with the eternal life

39
00:02:48,051 --> 00:02:51,890
of his mind and body.
Instead of turn the life of his spirit

40
00:02:51,891 --> 00:02:56,891
and saw these willing to split and maim
has saw into pieces in order to preserve

41
00:02:57,681 --> 00:03:01,150
his earthly might embody.
Even though he's worn that spending your

42
00:03:01,151 --> 00:03:05,620
soul is a terrible natural thing to do
and that's a soul is to remain in tech.

43
00:03:08,050 --> 00:03:08,883
Yes,

44
00:03:10,010 --> 00:03:15,010
healing a nation against nature.
Proning stake on the soul as separate

45
00:03:16,501 --> 00:03:21,130
from the body of course goes against the
way by logical and natural scientists,

46
00:03:21,131 --> 00:03:25,200
he consciousness,
they see physical and chemical processes

47
00:03:25,201 --> 00:03:29,160
in the brain as the cost of emotional
and rational consciousness which

48
00:03:29,161 --> 00:03:33,090
disappears if one dies.
The body is all there is the ID off.

49
00:03:33,100 --> 00:03:35,700
A separate soul is just a kosher
projection.

50
00:03:35,701 --> 00:03:37,440
We create.
However,

51
00:03:37,441 --> 00:03:41,400
although Ronan's notion of splitting a
soul in multiple parts is quite

52
00:03:41,401 --> 00:03:44,550
original.
The idea of a separate soul that needs

53
00:03:44,551 --> 00:03:49,020
to remain in tact or in other words and
tainted is spite of many religions

54
00:03:49,021 --> 00:03:52,290
around the world,
and this brings me to my central

55
00:03:52,291 --> 00:03:55,410
arguments.
That's to Harry pulled the saga is very

56
00:03:55,411 --> 00:04:00,120
much influenced by religious and
specifically Christian symbolism and

57
00:04:00,150 --> 00:04:02,430
narratives.
There are many examples,

58
00:04:02,890 --> 00:04:07,050
specific symbolism in Harry Potter.
That's can be linked to Christianity

59
00:04:07,380 --> 00:04:09,090
starting with the name,
how he father.

60
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:14,710
Some have suggested that it's over first
to Sephora or biblical verses where

61
00:04:14,740 --> 00:04:19,740
[inaudible] is another word for God's
search as is a a 64 eight but now,

62
00:04:19,931 --> 00:04:21,490
oh Louis,
the Arthur follow.

63
00:04:21,491 --> 00:04:24,770
We are the clay and Dow or other.
Well,

64
00:04:24,771 --> 00:04:28,370
heavy according to John Granger is a
wordplay on air.

65
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:30,700
How we polar is this the era of garth.

66
00:04:32,210 --> 00:04:32,940
Okay,

67
00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:35,150
one question.
Push this even further and draw

68
00:04:35,151 --> 00:04:39,260
comparisons between Donadoni and Garth,
which would mean that Harry and

69
00:04:39,261 --> 00:04:42,440
Dumbledore's army represent Jesus and
his disciples

70
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:44,360
professor,
he had nothing to do with that.

71
00:04:44,361 --> 00:04:46,070
It was me,
most noble of you,

72
00:04:46,071 --> 00:04:48,980
Harry,
but as has been pointed out,

73
00:04:49,390 --> 00:04:50,890
apostrophe cleared.
It says

74
00:04:51,110 --> 00:04:51,943
double doors.

75
00:04:54,270 --> 00:04:56,760
Further,
draco is the Latin word for boats,

76
00:04:56,830 --> 00:05:00,610
dragon and a serpent,
which are biblical symbols for Satan.

77
00:05:00,940 --> 00:05:04,600
Revelation 22 states.
He sees the dragon,

78
00:05:04,601 --> 00:05:09,340
that ancient serpent who is the devil
and Satan and bound him for a thousand

79
00:05:09,340 --> 00:05:10,240
years.
Well,

80
00:05:10,241 --> 00:05:15,241
malfoy comes from the French malfoy,
which translates to Beth or evil faith.

81
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:20,030
DRACO malfoy is this a serpent of evil?
Faith.

82
00:05:20,530 --> 00:05:21,490
Seven Sophia,

83
00:05:27,820 --> 00:05:30,640
of course,
the serpent is seen lots in Harry Potter

84
00:05:30,670 --> 00:05:34,870
and it is one of the strongest
representations of the devil starting

85
00:05:34,871 --> 00:05:35,920
with the serpent.
Of course,

86
00:05:35,921 --> 00:05:38,650
that's seducers Adam and eve in the
garden of Eden.

87
00:05:39,190 --> 00:05:43,570
Rolling symbolism based on animals
clearly comes from medieval Christian

88
00:05:43,571 --> 00:05:48,571
bcra which were animal stories where the
animals are infused with biblical

89
00:05:48,701 --> 00:05:53,310
meaning in Christian Bcra,
the snake and bus least equal

90
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:57,680
representations of Satan.
Dare foods are the phoenix and stack

91
00:05:57,710 --> 00:06:00,710
while the lion,
which is of course the symbol different

92
00:06:00,711 --> 00:06:04,940
door represents Jesus.
In revelation five five for example,

93
00:06:04,970 --> 00:06:09,970
Jesus is referred to as the lion of the
tribe of Judah and finally though is a

94
00:06:10,281 --> 00:06:12,030
symbol of maternal off

95
00:06:30,870 --> 00:06:35,000
after all this time
or

96
00:06:39,020 --> 00:06:43,670
John Granger also makes the argument
that and Harry Potter and the Chamber of

97
00:06:43,670 --> 00:06:46,070
Secrets,
the sort of Griffendor is a symbol for

98
00:06:46,071 --> 00:06:50,060
the Christian Cross.
Thus Harry as a representation of Jesus

99
00:06:50,061 --> 00:06:53,660
fights off the devil bus,
at least with a sword that is symbolic

100
00:06:53,661 --> 00:06:58,661
of the Christian Cross.
I could go on,

101
00:07:03,421 --> 00:07:07,920
but I would refer you to John Granger's
book looking for God and Harry Potter

102
00:07:07,921 --> 00:07:11,280
for more symbolism on the brother and
narrative level.

103
00:07:11,281 --> 00:07:14,010
The Harry Potter.
Sarah can of course also be seen as a

104
00:07:14,011 --> 00:07:16,350
Christian narrative.
It is an essence,

105
00:07:16,351 --> 00:07:20,010
a story about laugh,
more specifically sacrificial laugh

106
00:07:20,090 --> 00:07:20,560
conquering

107
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:21,393
Beth.

108
00:07:30,940 --> 00:07:35,500
The forces that defeat evil and Harry
Boulder are almost always forces of

109
00:07:35,501 --> 00:07:37,540
good.
They are healing tears,

110
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:40,570
sort that appears through bakery and
loyalty,

111
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:44,140
a strong force of happiness and of
course laugh itself.

112
00:07:48,290 --> 00:07:52,910
La Fin Christianity put Texas saw and
pro fence a terrible faith in the

113
00:07:52,911 --> 00:07:56,120
afterlife and like Jesus died for our
sins.

114
00:07:56,150 --> 00:07:59,630
Harry sacrifices himself to protect his
loved ones

115
00:08:05,790 --> 00:08:09,150
after which he has resurrected in front
of his disciples.

116
00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:14,130
Now I myself as an atheist,
well most days and an agnostic on Psalm,

117
00:08:14,131 --> 00:08:18,810
was quite surprised to find search,
strong Christian influences in books.

118
00:08:18,811 --> 00:08:23,250
Death defined my childhood,
yet I wouldn't effort dismissed the many

119
00:08:23,251 --> 00:08:27,420
lessons that can be found in how he
father John granger describes how

120
00:08:27,421 --> 00:08:32,340
reporter as novels that satisfy a
spiritual hunger in a secular society,

121
00:08:32,370 --> 00:08:35,190
seasoned them.
The power of traditional Christian

122
00:08:35,191 --> 00:08:38,250
literary arts.
And although I agree for the

123
00:08:38,251 --> 00:08:42,930
nonreligious I see in Harry Potter or a
story that is perfect to introduce to

124
00:08:42,931 --> 00:08:47,931
children or for grownups to reflect upon
the normality and inevitability of

125
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:50,510
death.
In Harry Potter,

126
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:54,000
a fear of death is seen as a filter
relation with death.

127
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:57,510
Although trout,
he put her many people in some way come

128
00:08:57,511 --> 00:09:01,650
back from the afterlife.
This is always described as a temporary

129
00:09:01,651 --> 00:09:03,450
or negative experience.

130
00:09:04,170 --> 00:09:08,700
People resurrected by the resurrection
stone are unhappy and don't belong on

131
00:09:08,701 --> 00:09:13,400
earth anymore and of course there's for
them worth who was fear of death lease

132
00:09:13,401 --> 00:09:16,620
into evil,
x of murder and damaging a saw.

133
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:19,680
This slowly turns him less and less
human,

134
00:09:19,681 --> 00:09:24,681
which is emotive debt and trey to yield
cof traces back to Oscar Wilde's picture

135
00:09:25,021 --> 00:09:29,100
of Dorian Gray.
It's voting's fishing of death and Harry

136
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:32,280
Puller is death.
Death can infect be transcendence.

137
00:09:32,340 --> 00:09:37,290
One can truly become the master of death
by living with laugh and creating death

138
00:09:37,291 --> 00:09:41,430
as an old friend when he comes.
We see this when Harry is in limbo after

139
00:09:41,431 --> 00:09:45,390
for the more it's quote unquote kills
him where Dumbledore tells him he can

140
00:09:45,391 --> 00:09:46,710
move on if he wants to.

141
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:48,360
All right,
thank you.

142
00:09:48,370 --> 00:09:51,570
So desire,
you'll be able to board a train

143
00:09:53,650 --> 00:09:56,960
ready to take me
on.

144
00:10:00,690 --> 00:10:04,740
But I think there's also an important
nonreligious lesson on death,

145
00:10:04,741 --> 00:10:09,330
which can be seen in how he bother the
lesson of accepting the debt or friends

146
00:10:09,331 --> 00:10:12,870
and loved ones.
The lesson of realizing that the death

147
00:10:12,871 --> 00:10:17,730
live on in our hearts and in our
memories as Albus dumbledore tells us in

148
00:10:17,731 --> 00:10:21,240
the third book and Cvs Stenosis in the
third movie,

149
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:25,210
it's cruel that I got to spend so much
time with James and Lillian new,

150
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:30,320
the little note this,
what's the lovefest never,

151
00:10:31,391 --> 00:10:35,770
rarely leaves
and you can always find

152
00:10:39,100 --> 00:10:39,933
it here

153
00:10:43,070 --> 00:10:47,450
and I think it is this lesson that lace
at the core of the story of how he

154
00:10:47,451 --> 00:10:52,310
father in book seven Luna answers the
question from the ego of Raven claw by

155
00:10:52,311 --> 00:10:55,940
suggesting that a circle has no
beginning all the loft ones.

156
00:10:55,941 --> 00:11:00,941
Harris last live farm as an inseparable
part of him and although ODF dice in a

157
00:11:00,951 --> 00:11:04,460
way,
their circles continue because by giving

158
00:11:04,461 --> 00:11:08,600
their names to his kids,
Lily James Serious and the others

159
00:11:08,660 --> 00:11:12,800
Devonne as much in Harris children as
they live on in himself.

160
00:11:29,330 --> 00:11:31,550
All right.
Thank you all so much for watching.

161
00:11:31,930 --> 00:11:36,050
This was a very hard one to make.
I deleted the whole video the first time

162
00:11:36,051 --> 00:11:38,360
because I just felt that it wasn't good
enough.

163
00:11:38,450 --> 00:11:41,360
And I'm still not completely satisfied,
but yeah,

164
00:11:41,390 --> 00:11:42,830
it's a,
it's finally here.

165
00:11:43,130 --> 00:11:46,700
Tomorrow I'm gonna delve deeper into
Harry Potter and it's Christian

166
00:11:46,701 --> 00:11:49,640
symbolism in the patron.
Only video a fire.

167
00:11:49,641 --> 00:11:52,640

So the wait for the next video,
