1
00:00:03,800 --> 00:00:08,190
Director of Gamma Delta opens is 2001
film the Devil's backbone with the

2
00:00:08,191 --> 00:00:13,191
question [inaudible]
the tragedy in question here,

3
00:00:15,871 --> 00:00:19,710
referring to the gruesome murder of the
young orphan boy certainty in a

4
00:00:19,711 --> 00:00:23,580
subsequent haunting of the orphanage by
his restless ghost in search of

5
00:00:23,581 --> 00:00:27,270
recognition and justice,
what does El Toro himself a stated that

6
00:00:27,271 --> 00:00:31,350
drama that unfolds within the confines
of this isolated complex serves merely

7
00:00:31,351 --> 00:00:34,550
as a microcosm of the tragedy.
His question is really it

8
00:00:38,090 --> 00:00:40,910
and the war goes on.
The Spanish civil war was a brutal

9
00:00:40,911 --> 00:00:45,911
conflict at gripped Spain bites throat.
Between the years of 1946 and 1939 it

10
00:00:46,521 --> 00:00:50,000
was a war fought and countless places
spanning the entire country,

11
00:00:50,420 --> 00:00:53,600
a struggle between the fascist and
nationalist forces of soon to be

12
00:00:53,601 --> 00:00:57,410
dictator General Francisco Franco and
Republican forces,

13
00:00:57,411 --> 00:01:00,050
which consisted mainly of communists,
anarchists,

14
00:01:00,051 --> 00:01:02,720
and democratic loyalists of the
Republican government.

15
00:01:03,140 --> 00:01:07,250
When the sounds of war,
we're finally silenced on the 1st of

16
00:01:07,250 --> 00:01:09,120
April,
1949 to Spanish felling as nationalists

17
00:01:09,121 --> 00:01:12,950
Flag Hung Victoria's into capitol of
Madrid and it would remain there until

18
00:01:12,951 --> 00:01:14,960
the fall of the regime with the death of
Franco.

19
00:01:14,961 --> 00:01:19,820
In 1975 more than half a million lives
would be lost in the killing around

20
00:01:19,821 --> 00:01:24,380
450,000 roughly to country numbers only
to be dwarfed by another word.

21
00:01:24,381 --> 00:01:28,610
I would start only five months later.
The Spanish civil war due to its limited

22
00:01:28,611 --> 00:01:30,780
scope and occurrence with the second
world war,

23
00:01:30,810 --> 00:01:34,460
would dare for quickly become but a side
note in the minds of the international

24
00:01:34,461 --> 00:01:36,260
community,
but more importantly,

25
00:01:36,261 --> 00:01:39,860
it was an event that due to it's
indescribable savage killing between

26
00:01:39,861 --> 00:01:41,810
former neighbors,
friends and family,

27
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:45,620
the people of Spain would choose to
forget and they're a national memory and

28
00:01:45,621 --> 00:01:48,860
it was exactly this conscious form of
repression that broad director,

29
00:01:48,861 --> 00:01:51,290
Dan Eltoro Toro to state that the civil
war,

30
00:01:51,291 --> 00:01:53,300
which was never completely healed in
Spain,

31
00:01:53,330 --> 00:01:57,890
is it ghost anything pending as it goes
in recognizing the lingering presence of

32
00:01:57,891 --> 00:02:02,030
this national trauma and the dangers for
getting one's best Deltoro decided to

33
00:02:02,031 --> 00:02:03,710
dedicated free films,
do engage,

34
00:02:03,711 --> 00:02:06,740
explain and find meaning in this still
sensitive topic.

35
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:08,450
The first one,
as I've mentioned,

36
00:02:08,451 --> 00:02:11,600
is what he calls his first real film,
the devil's backbone.

37
00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:15,410
The second one would come out four years
later in the form of Pan's labyrinth,

38
00:02:15,740 --> 00:02:18,560
and the third one in the trilogy is to
this day still to be announced.

39
00:02:19,100 --> 00:02:20,810
Now,
it's important to note that neither of

40
00:02:20,811 --> 00:02:23,540
these films are straightforward
historical war films.

41
00:02:23,630 --> 00:02:27,580
The Devil's backbone unfolding during
the latter stages of the war is a gothic

42
00:02:27,590 --> 00:02:31,670
ghost stories set in an orphanage about
to protagonists Carlos interacting with

43
00:02:31,671 --> 00:02:35,150
the ghost of the murdered some something
Pan's labyrinth found the other hand

44
00:02:35,151 --> 00:02:39,380
taking place in 1944 can be most
accurately described as the twisted

45
00:02:39,381 --> 00:02:43,460
fairy tale of the young Ophelia.
A girl who explores a fantastical world

46
00:02:43,461 --> 00:02:48,020
with the desire to return as a magical
Princess Peter Pan like eternal child of

47
00:02:48,021 --> 00:02:51,500
the underworld decide Christopher
Hartney deltoros decision to use to

48
00:02:51,501 --> 00:02:55,280
fantastical to say something profound
about historical makes sense.

49
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:59,120
Both of these genre seth historically
been utilized to explore and engage

50
00:02:59,290 --> 00:03:00,340
chaos,
drama,

51
00:03:00,341 --> 00:03:04,240
and the repressed parts of a culture in
the collective minds of its citizens.

52
00:03:04,510 --> 00:03:08,500
In awards of young Ian Psychoanalyst,
Donald call check when human resources

53
00:03:08,501 --> 00:03:12,520
are on the available archetype or
resources will present themselves in the

54
00:03:12,521 --> 00:03:15,010
devil's backbone.
Does is manifested through the looming

55
00:03:15,011 --> 00:03:18,310
presence of specters and first one being
the ghost of Sunday,

56
00:03:18,490 --> 00:03:21,210
an orphan boy murdered by the violin.
Jacinto,

57
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:26,350
the oldest orphan into complex is deaf,
go seemingly unrecognized by both the

58
00:03:26,351 --> 00:03:29,200
staff of the orphanage as well as the
altar boys living there.

59
00:03:29,590 --> 00:03:33,580
Kai May the only witness to the murder
has kept his mouth shut and any attempt

60
00:03:33,581 --> 00:03:35,760
to bring up Sunday's fate as quickly
shut down,

61
00:03:36,210 --> 00:03:38,020
chaotic.
In fact,

62
00:03:38,021 --> 00:03:41,590
any mentioned of death or tragedy seems
to have been deemed inappropriate by the

63
00:03:41,591 --> 00:03:43,600
leaders of the orphanage.
Carlos,

64
00:03:43,601 --> 00:03:46,990
the protagonist of the story is never
told of the demise of his father on the

65
00:03:46,991 --> 00:03:50,470
front line and the other kids still seem
to be receiving letters from their

66
00:03:50,471 --> 00:03:52,960
parents.
Parents who haven't been alive since

67
00:03:52,961 --> 00:03:54,850
before.
The moment the boys respect to flee,

68
00:03:54,851 --> 00:03:57,080
set food on the desolate orphanage
grounds.

69
00:03:59,970 --> 00:04:03,100
The second spectrum of the film can then
be identified as the ongoing,

70
00:04:03,101 --> 00:04:06,730
yet physically epson civil war or in
more visual terms,

71
00:04:06,731 --> 00:04:10,390
the always lingering presence off the
unexploded bomb in the middle of the

72
00:04:10,430 --> 00:04:13,420
courtyard dropped on the same night of
something's death.

73
00:04:13,450 --> 00:04:16,030
The device become spiritually connected
to the boys,

74
00:04:16,031 --> 00:04:18,850
restless spirit and the looming presence
of sudden death.

75
00:04:19,390 --> 00:04:23,530
Both are physically debt and yet both
are shown to be alive on a fantastical

76
00:04:23,531 --> 00:04:24,364
level.

77
00:04:25,620 --> 00:04:26,453
Sure.

78
00:04:30,130 --> 00:04:34,030
Not Unlike to unresolved trauma of the
war are asking for recognition and

79
00:04:34,031 --> 00:04:38,230
guiding Carlos along the way in a search
to find answers by engaging with the

80
00:04:38,231 --> 00:04:41,470
specters as similar thing happens in
Pan's labyrinth,

81
00:04:41,530 --> 00:04:45,280
which a fairytale manifests itself in
the world of the younger Ophelia in

82
00:04:45,281 --> 00:04:49,030
order for her to make sense or for life
after the traumatic death of her father

83
00:04:49,031 --> 00:04:53,050
and his replacement by the fascist
captain vidal affiliate has been forced

84
00:04:53,051 --> 00:04:55,240
to leave for us.
It into a world in which to realm of the

85
00:04:55,241 --> 00:04:58,420
fantastical and in material have been
all but forgotten.

86
00:05:01,270 --> 00:05:04,630
We can see this in the affiliates
metaphorical till the magical rows of

87
00:05:04,650 --> 00:05:08,620
immortality sitting at the top of a
mountain and slowly wittering away.

88
00:05:08,621 --> 00:05:10,810
Yes,
the people below with become too scared

89
00:05:10,811 --> 00:05:14,740
of the poisonous foreigns guarding it,
I think become obsessed with their fear

90
00:05:14,741 --> 00:05:18,460
of death and pain.
This mentality manifests itself all

91
00:05:18,461 --> 00:05:20,980
throughout the story,
but it's most evident than captain

92
00:05:20,981 --> 00:05:23,680
Verdell.
He places high value in all things

93
00:05:23,681 --> 00:05:28,681
material and orderly,
but outright despises any story that

94
00:05:29,171 --> 00:05:33,490
doesn't align with his fascist ideology
or that isn't grounded in what he calls

95
00:05:33,491 --> 00:05:38,491
reality of the world.
The reality that for Ophelia is buddy

96
00:05:39,770 --> 00:05:43,360
foreground for what lies underneath.
Right at the start of the movie,

97
00:05:43,361 --> 00:05:47,230
we can already see that she notices
things that others don't pay attention

98
00:05:47,231 --> 00:05:51,700
to or are just unable to see a few les
replacing of the eye back into its

99
00:05:51,701 --> 00:05:54,160
proper place,
signifying the opening of a new

100
00:05:54,161 --> 00:05:54,994
dimension.

101
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:56,920
In fact,
I'll throw it goes out of his way to

102
00:05:56,930 --> 00:06:01,700
depict how Captain Fidel blinds is
victims time and again until he himself

103
00:06:01,701 --> 00:06:05,480
is blinded at the end of the film.
Metaphorically depicting that all of

104
00:06:05,481 --> 00:06:09,020
these characters that have been forced
to leave or unconsciously separated from

105
00:06:09,021 --> 00:06:13,640
the realm of the fantastical and it is
not unique to just pan's labyrinth in

106
00:06:13,641 --> 00:06:15,680
the devil's backbone.
I have the antagonist.

107
00:06:15,681 --> 00:06:20,000
Jacinto is also shown to be bloodshot
displaying his feelings of rage and lack

108
00:06:20,001 --> 00:06:22,760
of clairvoyance.
The world of the Dell and just Cynthia

109
00:06:22,770 --> 00:06:27,770
was one dominated by the material,
one that places rigid and often gri

110
00:06:32,061 --> 00:06:36,050
boundaries on what is accepted as the
story of the nation and of the culture

111
00:06:36,380 --> 00:06:40,490
contrasted by the limitless roundness
and colorfulness of the mythological

112
00:06:40,491 --> 00:06:43,040
world.
It all story in particular as one

113
00:06:43,041 --> 00:06:46,130
dominated by time and is connected
obsession with death,

114
00:06:46,430 --> 00:06:50,360
always checking the watch his father
gave him and physically living in a room

115
00:06:50,361 --> 00:06:52,610
that reminds us of the insight of a
clock,

116
00:06:52,940 --> 00:06:56,510
giving him somewhat of a resemblance to
did time and death obsessed Captain Hook

117
00:06:56,511 --> 00:07:00,680
and Peter Benn is sole purpose in life
being to die and men on the battlefield

118
00:07:00,681 --> 00:07:04,490
like his father before him and to have a
son to do it all over again.

119
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:08,240
He's so certain of his beliefs that he
can't even conceive of any other

120
00:07:08,241 --> 00:07:13,241
outcomes to countered his worldview.
Delta Rho device is fantastical worlds

121
00:07:13,251 --> 00:07:17,780
into a strictly masculine brotherly
story and a sisterly feminine one.

122
00:07:18,170 --> 00:07:22,640
Both can be seen as young in stories of
self maturation in absence of the proper

123
00:07:22,641 --> 00:07:26,500
archetypal parental guidance according
to professor Jordan B.

124
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:29,030
Peterson is research into recurring
archetypal symbolism.

125
00:07:29,031 --> 00:07:32,990
We can distinguish between the great
fodder often representing a society's

126
00:07:32,991 --> 00:07:37,250
culture and order and the great mother
often representing the earth and the

127
00:07:37,251 --> 00:07:41,150
exploration of novelty.
Both these archetypes have a wise,

128
00:07:41,190 --> 00:07:44,240
benevolent side and a tyrannical
destructive side.

129
00:07:44,750 --> 00:07:48,740
Degrade moderate provides the hero with
the promise of a safe haven to fall back

130
00:07:48,741 --> 00:07:51,530
on s he or she makes the journey into
the unknown.

131
00:07:51,890 --> 00:07:53,030
Her opposite,
however,

132
00:07:53,031 --> 00:07:57,260
is over protective and always tries to
shield the protagonist from facing any

133
00:07:57,261 --> 00:08:00,320
adversity.
The wise fodder or king on the other

134
00:08:00,321 --> 00:08:03,950
hand protects the protagonist,
instills confidence and encourages him

135
00:08:03,951 --> 00:08:08,951
or her to face the unknown and to take
self responsibility as an individual is

136
00:08:09,231 --> 00:08:10,450
tyrannical side,
however,

137
00:08:10,460 --> 00:08:14,870
consumes the individual through jealousy
and resentment in order to sustain his

138
00:08:14,871 --> 00:08:15,704
own power.

139
00:08:15,980 --> 00:08:18,410
This particular archetype reveals itself
in the field,

140
00:08:18,411 --> 00:08:20,210
yes,
encountered with the pill men and

141
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:24,230
ghastly humanoid creature who guards
eight lavish feast and consume some

142
00:08:24,231 --> 00:08:27,950
children who tried to eat from it.
That's throw himself as stated that the

143
00:08:27,951 --> 00:08:31,490
bill men represents the power hungry
fascism of Captain Verdell,

144
00:08:31,700 --> 00:08:34,910
the elder leaf,
Francesco Franco and the Spanish

145
00:08:34,910 --> 00:08:38,570
Catholic church also visually mirroring
the monster with these characters as

146
00:08:38,571 --> 00:08:42,470
they dine on a similar lavish feast.
On a more general level,

147
00:08:42,471 --> 00:08:44,660
however,
the creature represents the tyrannical

148
00:08:44,661 --> 00:08:48,590
nature of to tell Terry aneurysm as a
whole is del Toro shows us a pile of

149
00:08:48,591 --> 00:08:52,220
children's shoes echoing the last
generation of the Holocaust and the

150
00:08:52,221 --> 00:08:54,710
Second World War in the devil's
backbone.

151
00:08:54,711 --> 00:08:58,860
Jacinto functions as a similar diamond,
often shown in the same frame with the

152
00:08:58,861 --> 00:09:00,930
unexploded bomb.
He is seen beating,

153
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:03,630
cutting,
and eventually even consciously mass

154
00:09:03,631 --> 00:09:06,030
murdering the other children in this
feelings of power,

155
00:09:06,031 --> 00:09:07,590
hungry,
rage and resentment,

156
00:09:08,010 --> 00:09:10,830
revealing that he has always been the
real ticking time bomb.

157
00:09:11,250 --> 00:09:13,830
On top of that,
his violent behavior has also shown to

158
00:09:13,831 --> 00:09:15,900
be rubbing off on the children around
him,

159
00:09:16,170 --> 00:09:17,960
which is depicted through to character
of crime.

160
00:09:17,961 --> 00:09:21,750
Me who mimics this destructive behavior
during the better first half of the

161
00:09:21,751 --> 00:09:24,120
film.
Even the orphanage itself seems to

162
00:09:24,121 --> 00:09:27,510
represent a place that consumes the
maturation of its children with its

163
00:09:27,511 --> 00:09:30,240
entrance mimicking a mouth eating.
The children who enter.

164
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:34,230
They'll toro then seems to use this to
make a cautionary statement about the

165
00:09:34,231 --> 00:09:36,810
psychology behind the actions of us
antagonist.

166
00:09:37,250 --> 00:09:41,100
Jacinta will so first orphan to be
adopted by Carmen and doctor [inaudible]

167
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:43,890
who would serve as his makeshift barents
of sorts.

168
00:09:44,130 --> 00:09:46,320
However,
a garment is seen engaging in a sort of

169
00:09:46,350 --> 00:09:50,100
oil depaul relationship with the boy and
the doctor confesses that he has never

170
00:09:50,101 --> 00:09:55,101
been fully dedicated to his tasks.
On top of that,

171
00:09:58,081 --> 00:10:01,530
Carmen is openly ashamed that the
relationship and mocks the boy for his

172
00:10:01,531 --> 00:10:03,180
lack of a fulfilled potential.

173
00:10:10,910 --> 00:10:13,700
It isn't perhaps no wonder that just
into stumped itself,

174
00:10:13,701 --> 00:10:18,140
grow for lack of a kingdom gave rise to
his feelings of rage and resentment that

175
00:10:18,141 --> 00:10:21,020
would fuel his desire to burn down as
shameful past.

176
00:10:21,350 --> 00:10:24,440
So besides serving as a means of dealing
with the press trauma,

177
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:29,000
both Carlos and the Helios fantastical
journeys take on the role of cautionary

178
00:10:29,001 --> 00:10:33,380
archetypical tales of self maturation.
Carlos in his friend's masculine journey

179
00:10:33,381 --> 00:10:37,730
is one of the development of unrelenting
courage to increasingly engaged with the

180
00:10:37,731 --> 00:10:41,930
repressed and the unknown.
Learning to take self responsibility and

181
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:46,110
ultimately taking on the tyrant with the
help of lessons from history and a

182
00:10:46,111 --> 00:10:49,030
finally,
enlightened wise father affiliace

183
00:10:49,050 --> 00:10:51,180
journey,
on the other hand is a distinctly

184
00:10:51,181 --> 00:10:53,460
feminine one,
or in the words of del Toro.

185
00:10:53,670 --> 00:10:56,130
And most of them,
the fantasy world I think she wouldn't

186
00:10:56,131 --> 00:10:58,530
dream of,
is really going back to the valley of

187
00:10:58,531 --> 00:11:01,260
her mother.
And that's the reason why she accesses

188
00:11:01,261 --> 00:11:04,980
the magical realm through her mother's
belly and why the film is littered with

189
00:11:04,981 --> 00:11:09,981
Fallopian imagery from the Fonz had to
to old thick tree to her bed frame.

190
00:11:10,710 --> 00:11:14,070
But in order for Ophelia to return to
the womb and become a princess,

191
00:11:14,071 --> 00:11:18,660
she has to show courage,
the fines towards absolute authority and

192
00:11:18,661 --> 00:11:23,200
most importantly on ultimate act of
selflessness and self sacrifice in

193
00:11:23,201 --> 00:11:25,200
servers off an uninvited siblings.

194
00:11:27,300 --> 00:11:30,830
So when a symbolical level,
Ophelia has to prove herself to beat it,

195
00:11:30,831 --> 00:11:34,170
great mudder in order for her to be
reborn as to princess.

196
00:11:34,380 --> 00:11:37,890
But this doesn't mean that they'll toro
revises or sugarcoats history

197
00:11:37,891 --> 00:11:39,420
completely.
In fact,

198
00:11:39,421 --> 00:11:43,740
he actively seems to make a point out of
his trilogies opening question by using

199
00:11:43,741 --> 00:11:47,310
similar story setups,
mirroring certain previous events,

200
00:11:47,311 --> 00:11:51,780
and even using the same motivations and
outfits for similar characters.

201
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:57,840
[inaudible] by the end of their journey,
Carlos and his friends may have overcome

202
00:12:00,581 --> 00:12:04,300
the tyranny of Jacinto,
but they leave the orphanage traumatized

203
00:12:04,301 --> 00:12:07,570
and physically scarred.
Ultimately finding dare to Mys.

204
00:12:07,571 --> 00:12:12,220
Years later in Pan's labyrinth,
Ophelia on her part is still shot and

205
00:12:12,221 --> 00:12:14,590
killed by Captain Verdell.
Ironically,

206
00:12:14,591 --> 00:12:17,350
fulfilling her wish to remain a child
forever,

207
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:21,370
but it's exactly in the selfless act of
protection that she makes room for an

208
00:12:21,371 --> 00:12:25,690
eventual better future by refusing to be
controlled by eight baffle logical

209
00:12:25,691 --> 00:12:29,680
ideology and by giving her brought her
to a generation that would eventually

210
00:12:29,681 --> 00:12:33,850
overthrown a fascist regime and who now
is both a foot in the material as well

211
00:12:33,851 --> 00:12:37,390
as the fantastical world,
his kingdom that was previously denied

212
00:12:37,391 --> 00:12:38,224
from Jacinto.

213
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:39,450
Can you let me,
Jane,

214
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:49,780
it's true all of this that del Toro
ultimately expresses the power of the

215
00:12:49,781 --> 00:12:53,770
fantastical when the archetypal,
although his characters might be faded

216
00:12:53,771 --> 00:12:57,460
to remain kids forever,
their memories for God and repressed

217
00:12:57,461 --> 00:13:01,870
like the real life trauma of the Spanish
civil war and capsulated in time and

218
00:13:01,871 --> 00:13:06,760
nameless in their anonymity.
It's exactly in our engagement with

219
00:13:06,761 --> 00:13:10,750
these fantastical tragedies into
retailing and revival after archetypical

220
00:13:10,751 --> 00:13:14,530
symbolism that there are lessons skin
reemerge into our own lives,

221
00:13:15,100 --> 00:13:19,450
bead in the form of another famous
eternal child and his group of lost boys

222
00:13:19,690 --> 00:13:23,710
facing off against the time and death
obsessed captain hook or in the form of

223
00:13:23,711 --> 00:13:27,880
numerous gothic stories or in Delta
arose own fantastical worlds,

224
00:13:28,210 --> 00:13:32,290
worlds that are asking to be explored
that force us to be honest with

225
00:13:32,291 --> 00:13:35,830
ourselves and our reality.
Do you have the courage to confront

226
00:13:35,831 --> 00:13:38,680
that?
What makes us uncomfortable to recognize

227
00:13:38,681 --> 00:13:43,360
the dangers and pitfalls along the way
whilst trying to navigate ourselves into

228
00:13:43,361 --> 00:13:48,361
to right Beth to dive into the unknown,
to be reborn and then to do it all over

229
00:13:49,121 --> 00:13:49,954
again?

230
00:13:56,950 --> 00:13:59,090
All right guys,
thank you all so much for watching.

231
00:13:59,091 --> 00:14:01,250
Again,
the devil's backbone and Pan's labyrinth

232
00:14:01,251 --> 00:14:03,350
are absolute pieces of art in my
opinion.

233
00:14:03,351 --> 00:14:07,190
And making this video has only increased
my appreciation of these films.

234
00:14:07,430 --> 00:14:11,620
I'm speaking of Art Larson.
I just received two really need hand for

235
00:14:11,630 --> 00:14:15,140
Boudin film posters from the people over
at engravers dungeon.

236
00:14:15,270 --> 00:14:16,910
Uh,
every poster in their assortment is

237
00:14:16,911 --> 00:14:20,300
completely unique because the pattern
and the grain of the wood are never the

238
00:14:20,301 --> 00:14:22,580
same.
They make them on films as well as other

239
00:14:22,581 --> 00:14:24,770
things.
And I even have one on Pan's labyrinth.

240
00:14:24,890 --> 00:14:28,850
They feel great on your hands and they
also come with lifetime durability due

241
00:14:28,851 --> 00:14:32,810
to being treated with a special mix of
wax oils and he handled varnish.

242
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:36,650
So if you like film posters or you know,
