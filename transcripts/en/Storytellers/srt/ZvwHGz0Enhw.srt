1
00:00:12,950 --> 00:00:15,710
So a question.
I think that's many people have been

2
00:00:15,711 --> 00:00:18,600
asking themselves more and more in the
last 15 years.

3
00:00:19,610 --> 00:00:22,640
How could this all happen?
We live in an information age where

4
00:00:22,641 --> 00:00:26,990
government and corporations have more
access to personal information than ever

5
00:00:26,991 --> 00:00:29,390
before.
There's a constant debate between

6
00:00:29,391 --> 00:00:31,520
privacy and safety instead of

7
00:00:31,790 --> 00:00:36,200
people to follow you.
We use the devices that you paid for the

8
00:00:36,201 --> 00:00:41,201
services and the systems that surround
you invisibly every day to watch you on

9
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:42,740
our behalf.

10
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:45,330
So why are so much,
there was a tech slipping through the

11
00:00:45,331 --> 00:00:48,630
cracks of our counter terrorism and
intelligence agencies.

12
00:00:48,900 --> 00:00:52,620
I think it's interesting to look at a
few of counterterrorism ans Howard might

13
00:00:52,621 --> 00:00:55,140
be influenced by the films and series to
watch.

14
00:00:55,290 --> 00:00:59,760
An important aspect or film analysis is
to look at our films and series are not

15
00:00:59,761 --> 00:01:01,320
only shaped by culture,
history,

16
00:01:01,321 --> 00:01:03,660
and politics,
but also how they influence these

17
00:01:03,661 --> 00:01:06,540
things.
As media scholar j Belton status myth

18
00:01:06,541 --> 00:01:09,750
has to become part of the cultural
language by which America on the stance

19
00:01:09,751 --> 00:01:13,620
itself and popular films serve as a
barometer of contemporary political

20
00:01:13,621 --> 00:01:16,180
history.
Examples of this regarding our historic

21
00:01:16,181 --> 00:01:20,160
on standing our movies such as saving
private Ryan and the gladiator.

22
00:01:25,630 --> 00:01:26,463
You're

23
00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:31,620
these films definitely shape and
influence our fuse of this historical

24
00:01:31,621 --> 00:01:35,550
time periods.
Looking at current issues of

25
00:01:35,551 --> 00:01:38,310
counterterrorism,
it would be logical to assume that since

26
00:01:38,311 --> 00:01:41,520
everything is filmed and documents,
we can easily see the differences

27
00:01:41,521 --> 00:01:44,940
between the reality of these issues and
its representation in fiction,

28
00:01:45,450 --> 00:01:47,220
but I would argue it's not that simple.

29
00:01:47,660 --> 00:01:49,730
I want all his phones.
It's blackberry,

30
00:01:50,020 --> 00:01:51,860
the apartment,
his car,

31
00:01:52,460 --> 00:01:54,020
bank accounts,
credit cards,

32
00:01:54,050 --> 00:01:55,880
travel patterns.
I want to know what he's going to think

33
00:01:55,881 --> 00:02:00,200
before he does every dirty little secret
he has and most of all we want the name

34
00:02:00,201 --> 00:02:05,201
and real time location of his source.
This is NSA priority level for any

35
00:02:05,241 --> 00:02:06,074
questions.

36
00:02:07,950 --> 00:02:09,370
All right,
let's get to it.

37
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:13,300
That seems to be more and more distrust
towards the information presented by the

38
00:02:13,301 --> 00:02:17,980
government and to news organizations and
the workings of intelligence agencies

39
00:02:17,981 --> 00:02:21,050
are clouded in secrecy.
So if you don't feel we're an accurate

40
00:02:21,100 --> 00:02:23,380
view of the workings of counter
terrorism,

41
00:02:23,381 --> 00:02:27,430
then it is important to look at my films
and series represented in a certain way.

42
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:30,940
And how does busbee be shapes our
understanding in the words or bad

43
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:35,470
baritones popularity off contemporary
conspiracy films represent a hunger for

44
00:02:35,471 --> 00:02:40,300
explanatory narrative of global
terrorism and counterterrorism in 24

45
00:02:40,301 --> 00:02:44,050
every season there's a new terrorist
threat that check bower with the help of

46
00:02:44,051 --> 00:02:48,730
chloe and the counter terrorist unit or
CPU needs to prevent a reoccurring

47
00:02:48,731 --> 00:02:53,320
aspect off 24 is the use of torture to
gain critical information to prevent an

48
00:02:53,321 --> 00:02:54,154
attack.

49
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:57,090
You gotta tell me what I want to know
what you're going to start losing your

50
00:02:57,091 --> 00:02:57,960
fingers one by one

51
00:03:00,420 --> 00:03:05,420
last chance.
This often proves successful.

52
00:03:14,060 --> 00:03:16,970
Devastating.
That's torture is legitimate strategy to

53
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:19,040
counter terrorist threats.
Jack,

54
00:03:19,041 --> 00:03:21,050
what if this doesn't work?
I'm never fell in pharmaceutical

55
00:03:21,051 --> 00:03:21,980
torture.
All that effect.

56
00:03:22,890 --> 00:03:27,300
And I have it turned out that the dean
of the US Military Academy at westpoint

57
00:03:27,380 --> 00:03:31,520
stated that the series was to direct
costs for wrongful behavioral few as

58
00:03:31,530 --> 00:03:32,960
troops in Iraq.
Of course,

59
00:03:32,961 --> 00:03:37,160
in those years to a few years of torture
became a nationwide debate and newer

60
00:03:37,161 --> 00:03:40,010
films and shows half adopted a different
perspective on it.

61
00:03:40,780 --> 00:03:45,170
Okay.
Okay.

62
00:03:56,030 --> 00:03:59,900
Another interesting aspect is that
within 24 and other films are serious

63
00:03:59,901 --> 00:04:03,260
that deal with terrorism,
although to terrorist threats come from

64
00:04:03,261 --> 00:04:05,600
a wide range or groups and
nationalities,

65
00:04:05,660 --> 00:04:07,910
Chinese radical Muslims,
Russians.

66
00:04:07,970 --> 00:04:11,420
There's almost always an aspect of
internal betrayal by people within the

67
00:04:11,421 --> 00:04:14,690
agencies.
The born shaves even flips it around and

68
00:04:14,691 --> 00:04:17,750
test the horse.
CIS grew up with just one person that is

69
00:04:17,751 --> 00:04:21,710
trying to restore its integrity.
This of course does represent and

70
00:04:21,740 --> 00:04:26,060
reinforced the public distrust in
government and the agencies and ends

71
00:04:26,061 --> 00:04:29,660
when we've won.
The last aspect that I want to discuss

72
00:04:29,661 --> 00:04:33,740
is the representation of the abilities
of these intelligence agencies.

73
00:04:34,130 --> 00:04:38,450
In many films and series and especially
the born serious disabilities are highly

74
00:04:38,451 --> 00:04:43,410
overrated as and states insofar as
counter intelligence narratives utilize

75
00:04:43,411 --> 00:04:47,480
pseudo expert jargon and mucked up
technical imagery to provide an illusion

76
00:04:47,481 --> 00:04:50,120
of scientific accuracy and
sophistication.

77
00:04:50,150 --> 00:04:54,260
They reframed the mundane limitations
off rewards environments as

78
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:56,840
technological fantasies in the bone or
the made them.

79
00:04:56,841 --> 00:05:00,080
For example,
the CIA headquarters can easily switch

80
00:05:00,081 --> 00:05:04,490
from a macro view of Europe to a CCTV
stream of a particular street.

81
00:05:04,820 --> 00:05:07,460
In reality,
the technology and possibilities are

82
00:05:07,461 --> 00:05:08,930
much more limited.
For one,

83
00:05:08,931 --> 00:05:12,860
it's not so easy to switch between
various systems and a big problem

84
00:05:12,861 --> 00:05:16,790
according to Christopher Andrew's book
on secret intelligence is sifting

85
00:05:16,791 --> 00:05:20,510
through massive amounts of collected
data yet and the Bourne ultimatum.

86
00:05:20,511 --> 00:05:23,270
They seem to hear and see everything
instantly.

87
00:05:23,570 --> 00:05:23,880
Hey,
on,

88
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:28,470
I'm on black Friday with pete black
prior looks like it's coming from a

89
00:05:28,471 --> 00:05:30,150
European signal.

90
00:05:30,380 --> 00:05:32,720
As he says.
Even with good intelligence,

91
00:05:32,721 --> 00:05:37,600
we can foresee the future only s Saint
Paul claims heaven to dark and the story

92
00:05:37,601 --> 00:05:40,130
of glass.
I would say that although intelligence

93
00:05:40,131 --> 00:05:44,750
technology is becoming more financed and
the debate about privacy is definitely

94
00:05:44,751 --> 00:05:47,510
worth having,
governments don't have the optical few

95
00:05:47,511 --> 00:05:50,420
of the whole world that they can access
anytime they want.

96
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:55,600
This vast collection of data is not that
useful and infringes a substantially on

97
00:05:57,381 --> 00:05:58,310
personal privacy

98
00:05:58,370 --> 00:06:01,970
should be aware of how our perception
could be partially shaped by popular

99
00:06:01,971 --> 00:06:06,530
culture because although these films and
cvs have to create a freedom of fiction

100
00:06:06,710 --> 00:06:08,720
is to distrust in government,
gross,

101
00:06:08,730 --> 00:06:12,620
the burden off reality may become the
responsibility or fiction.

102
00:06:13,130 --> 00:06:15,960
My name is Edward Snowden.

103
00:06:18,830 --> 00:06:20,500
All right.
Thank you so much for watching.

104
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:22,180
Uh,
the last two weeks we've got some

105
00:06:22,181 --> 00:06:25,270
awesome exposure and you gave us all
amazing feedback.

106
00:06:25,380 --> 00:06:27,640
Uh,
I'm working on my voice and we'll try to

107
00:06:27,641 --> 00:06:31,630
improve it a little bit.
Every video we are also working hard on

108
00:06:31,631 --> 00:06:34,510
sound mixing and of course our skillsets
altogether.

109
00:06:35,180 --> 00:06:37,060
Uh,
almost got some feedback is a little bit

110
00:06:37,061 --> 00:06:38,930
too much like the neuro iterator.
Uh,

111
00:06:38,980 --> 00:06:41,560
but we are taking this as a huge
compliment.

112
00:06:41,590 --> 00:06:44,820
We will definitely try to create more of
our own style in the future.

113
00:06:44,821 --> 00:06:45,670
Though,
of course,

114
00:06:45,671 --> 00:06:48,430
we recently started and we are fully
aware of that.

115
00:06:48,431 --> 00:06:52,060
We have mountains of learning to do and
we are constantly looking for ways to

116
00:06:52,061 --> 00:06:52,940
improve.
Uh,

117
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:54,940
with regards to this video.
I'm sorry.

118
00:06:54,941 --> 00:06:57,160
It was a little bit late.
It was a good lesson for me.

119
00:06:57,161 --> 00:07:00,430
Death needing three films,
a full television show and a lot of

120
00:07:00,431 --> 00:07:03,760
other footage for my video is too much
to handle for right now.

121
00:07:03,910 --> 00:07:06,520
Next time I will focus on one film,
uh,

122
00:07:06,660 --> 00:07:10,930
almost next video will be on team
America and his will come out in the

123
00:07:10,930 --> 00:07:11,380
following days.
Uh,

124
00:07:11,380 --> 00:07:12,160
see you next time.
Yeah.
