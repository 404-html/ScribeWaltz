00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:02,630
Thank you to squarespace for sponsoring
this video.

2
00:00:07,380 --> 00:00:12,380
I think we can all agree that rogue one
is by no means a conventional entry into

3
00:00:12,451 --> 00:00:15,810
the Star Wars Saga,
the black and gray undertones of the

4
00:00:15,811 --> 00:00:18,270
opening sequence,
and it's boots on the ground,

5
00:00:18,271 --> 00:00:22,110
no nonsense approach to it.
Story for veal early on that the film is

6
00:00:22,111 --> 00:00:27,111
the odd one out at a midst a long series
of familiar expectations taking place in

7
00:00:27,511 --> 00:00:31,770
between the overall darker and best and
mystic revenge of the sith and the more

8
00:00:31,771 --> 00:00:36,390
hopeful and optimistic and new hope.
It functions as a mediator of what we

9
00:00:36,391 --> 00:00:39,270
can call the Yin and the Yang of the
star wars saga.

10
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:42,510
Bridging not only to chronological gap
in the timeline,

11
00:00:42,690 --> 00:00:46,440
but also and more importantly,
symbolically crossing the underlying

12
00:00:46,470 --> 00:00:49,230
tonal divide that exists between these
two films.

13
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:53,070
This voyage begins close through the
darkness of revenge of the Sith,

14
00:00:53,310 --> 00:00:56,280
the young gender or so,
and her family who have been hiding in

15
00:00:56,281 --> 00:01:00,870
the shadows of the galaxy are found by
the tyrannical empire who proceed to

16
00:01:00,871 --> 00:01:03,690
shoot her,
define mother and forced her genius

17
00:01:03,691 --> 00:01:06,600
fodder,
Gayland Urso to finish constructing the

18
00:01:06,601 --> 00:01:08,850
death star with the archetype of a
rental.

19
00:01:08,850 --> 00:01:11,520
Figures effectively eliminated the
film's opening.

20
00:01:11,521 --> 00:01:14,970
Sequence not only sets up Jen's
backstory as to protagonist,

21
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:19,590
but it also symbolically establishes the
main dominating theme or undertone of

22
00:01:19,591 --> 00:01:23,670
roughly the first half of the film,
which is the world at the bottom and in

23
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:26,340
the shadow.
Fifteen years down the line,

24
00:01:26,341 --> 00:01:30,480
jen is shown to have become a criminal
and a prisoner in a remote imperial

25
00:01:30,481 --> 00:01:33,450
labor camp,
having grown disillusioned and cynical

26
00:01:33,451 --> 00:01:36,360
throughout the year,
she doesn't rejoice at the prospect of

27
00:01:36,361 --> 00:01:39,630
being rescued by the rebels,
but attempts to fight them off.

28
00:01:39,631 --> 00:01:42,510
Instead.
Her nihilistic worldview has made,

29
00:01:42,511 --> 00:01:46,200
are numb to any sort of belief or dream
anymore benevolent future.

30
00:01:46,530 --> 00:01:50,340
Her only interest are selfish in nature
and grounded at the bottom in the

31
00:01:50,341 --> 00:01:54,270
material world.
You can stand to see the imperial flag.

32
00:01:54,860 --> 00:01:56,220
Brain crossed,

33
00:01:57,850 --> 00:01:58,800
not a problem if you don't.

34
00:01:59,750 --> 00:02:01,700
The rebel alliance on it's Bart is
shown,

35
00:02:01,701 --> 00:02:04,430
fractured its members,
anxious and divided,

36
00:02:04,610 --> 00:02:07,970
separated by conflicting opinions on the
conduct of war.

37
00:02:08,180 --> 00:02:11,210
It's agents operating on the fringes of
morality.

38
00:02:11,550 --> 00:02:13,460
Gas.
Ian is one of these agents and

39
00:02:13,461 --> 00:02:17,140
represents this inner conflict in his
struggle to live with the questionable

40
00:02:17,180 --> 00:02:20,570
things he sees himself forced to do in
servers off the rebellion,

41
00:02:21,170 --> 00:02:23,870
the alliances,
motives are seemingly egoic and

42
00:02:23,871 --> 00:02:27,290
dishonest in nature,
only having rescued gin as a means of

43
00:02:27,291 --> 00:02:31,220
getting to her father and lying to her
about the ultimate goal of the mission.

44
00:02:31,470 --> 00:02:33,780
Forget what you heard in that there will
be no extraction.

45
00:02:34,470 --> 00:02:35,303
You find him.

46
00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:41,890
This morally slippery slope is
accentuated by two character of Saul

47
00:02:41,890 --> 00:02:44,020
Guerrera,
the former mentor of gin and the leader

48
00:02:44,021 --> 00:02:48,460
of an extremist rebel cell function
somewhat as a cautionary tale for the

49
00:02:48,461 --> 00:02:52,030
alliance as a whole.
He and his men have been engaged in a

50
00:02:52,031 --> 00:02:56,470
brutal war against the empire and the
city of Jeddah booting civilian lives in

51
00:02:56,471 --> 00:03:00,910
danger and combating the imperials over
who the moral high ground in the city

52
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:05,860
hiding in a crumbling desert cave with
his window into the world shattered saw

53
00:03:05,861 --> 00:03:10,510
has slowly become more machine than men
having grown exceedingly paranoid of

54
00:03:10,511 --> 00:03:14,020
others as his sanity and humanity
dwindled along the way.

55
00:03:17,590 --> 00:03:20,680
Moving beyond the merely human
representation of the world.

56
00:03:20,681 --> 00:03:23,170
At the bottom is the entire planet of
Jetta,

57
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:24,820
a small desert.
Planet.

58
00:03:24,821 --> 00:03:29,050
Jetta was once a spiritual world of
worship for forest believers and to jet.

59
00:03:29,051 --> 00:03:30,400
I order.
However,

60
00:03:30,401 --> 00:03:32,710
when we get to see is a world in
decline,

61
00:03:32,770 --> 00:03:36,490
the giant statues of Ancient Jetta I
have fallen and are crumbling.

62
00:03:36,820 --> 00:03:39,200
It's city upon a hill like John
winthrop's,

63
00:03:39,220 --> 00:03:42,460
Massachusetts Bay colony.
It was once a place for people to look

64
00:03:42,461 --> 00:03:44,530
up to a place of honor,
hope,

65
00:03:44,710 --> 00:03:47,530
justice,
and the highest possible good in rogue

66
00:03:47,531 --> 00:03:48,221
one.
However,

67
00:03:48,221 --> 00:03:52,030
the city has fallen into decay.
It streets ravaged by war.

68
00:03:52,031 --> 00:03:54,670
It's skies shrouded by a pyramid shape,
star,

69
00:03:54,671 --> 00:03:57,250
destroyer and ultimate symbol of bloated
order,

70
00:03:57,430 --> 00:04:00,730
and it's amongst roaming the streets
without purpose as dare temple is

71
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:05,760
actively being plundered of its most
valuable resource guide holding these

72
00:04:06,670 --> 00:04:10,930
star crystals were formerly used to make
jet I lightsabers and our sources of the

73
00:04:10,931 --> 00:04:14,710
force of the light in the darkness
representing such things as order

74
00:04:14,740 --> 00:04:17,590
justice and moral good gins,
necklace holes,

75
00:04:17,591 --> 00:04:20,170
one of these stones which is noticed by
the blind monk Chirrut

76
00:04:23,020 --> 00:04:26,200
the first thing this quote seems to
address as Jen's inner journey,

77
00:04:26,230 --> 00:04:30,430
perhaps implying that she should listen
to to deepest urgings over hard to let

78
00:04:30,431 --> 00:04:35,140
go of her apathetic nature and to move
yourself upwards towards a higher

79
00:04:35,141 --> 00:04:38,350
purpose to become a beacon of light in
the darkness.

80
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:42,220
The second preference comes into form of
the newly constructed Deathstar,

81
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:46,720
which powered by the ems crystals from
Jetta possesses eight literal heart of

82
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:50,450
Geiber to director Orson Krennic.
This literal manifestation gold,

83
00:04:50,460 --> 00:04:54,760
a star powered by Dick Lehman Crystal
will ultimately translate into a better

84
00:04:54,761 --> 00:04:59,761
world to providing peace cured.
However,

85
00:05:00,671 --> 00:05:04,180
it is notion of the absolute order of
light becomes instead something

86
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:08,620
pathological and highly destructive,
symbolically suggesting that a world

87
00:05:08,621 --> 00:05:13,090
with too much light or too much order is
just as bad as a world consumed by

88
00:05:13,091 --> 00:05:16,570
darkness and chaos.
These two notions of lightness as moral

89
00:05:16,571 --> 00:05:20,550
good and the danger of the excess of
light then come together at the climax

90
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:24,430
of the jetta sequence gins,
existing inner cynical beliefs are

91
00:05:24,431 --> 00:05:28,960
shattered when she's confronted with a
Hologram message of her long lost father

92
00:05:29,260 --> 00:05:33,580
speaking to her as to symbolical spirit
of the fodder to culture and the order

93
00:05:33,581 --> 00:05:36,190
that has been consumed by the tyranny of
the empire.

94
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:39,940
He tells her of his true intentions to
eight to rebellion and the destruction

95
00:05:39,941 --> 00:05:44,500
of the deaths are down by leaving gin
with a message of hope and sacrificed to

96
00:05:44,501 --> 00:05:47,770
a higher purpose.
But at the same time of the resurrection

97
00:05:47,771 --> 00:05:48,820
of the wives.
Father,

98
00:05:48,830 --> 00:05:53,260
his tyrannical counterpart blooms high
above shrouding the light of the sun

99
00:05:53,261 --> 00:05:58,150
before finally destroying the remnants
of the old order like a god thunder on

100
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:03,020
the people of his creation with the land
now shrouded in darkness and chaos.

101
00:06:03,021 --> 00:06:05,060
It's horizon rendered,
nonexistent.

102
00:06:05,330 --> 00:06:10,330
Saw Jim's father figure decides that he
will run no longer with his sacrifice,

103
00:06:10,761 --> 00:06:14,630
symbolizing the embracing of his own
darkness and his message of trust in a

104
00:06:14,631 --> 00:06:17,480
higher good.
The group escapes not only death,

105
00:06:17,510 --> 00:06:21,310
but also manages to climb out of the
symbolical world at the bottom.

106
00:06:21,860 --> 00:06:25,670
The story then starts to take the shape
of the archetypical ascension journey

107
00:06:25,830 --> 00:06:29,720
that has its hero climb out of the
shadow is sending a mountain towards the

108
00:06:29,721 --> 00:06:33,110
highest possible,
good redeeming or changing himself and

109
00:06:33,111 --> 00:06:35,330
the people around him for the better at
the top.

110
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:39,800
This upward journey in rogue one is then
mirrored by a descend into chaos and

111
00:06:39,801 --> 00:06:44,180
into the belly of the beast on the one
hand to embrace and overcome every

112
00:06:44,181 --> 00:06:45,470
character's personal,
dark,

113
00:06:45,471 --> 00:06:47,570
side or shadow,
and on the other hand,

114
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:51,860
to save the spirit of the fodder which
holds the key to the reemergence of hope

115
00:06:51,861 --> 00:06:56,120
and a more benevolent order for gaseous.
This means that he has to confront the

116
00:06:56,121 --> 00:07:00,890
darker nonthinking side of his character
in order to free himself from the mental

117
00:07:00,891 --> 00:07:02,360
prison.
Net clouds is hard.

118
00:07:02,420 --> 00:07:03,530
It was more than once

119
00:07:08,380 --> 00:07:10,520
with the ultimate physical death will
for fodder.

120
00:07:10,530 --> 00:07:15,370
Gin on her part has to finally move
beyond her empathetic nature in favor of

121
00:07:15,371 --> 00:07:18,550
belief and hope and self sacrifice for a
higher good.

122
00:07:18,790 --> 00:07:22,000
I would argue that it's this change in
these two characters that slowly begins

123
00:07:22,001 --> 00:07:26,110
to trickle down into other individuals
and eventually the rebel collective as a

124
00:07:26,111 --> 00:07:28,570
whole.
Jen and her broke one task force are

125
00:07:28,571 --> 00:07:30,580
really the tip of the spear of the
rebellion.

126
00:07:30,610 --> 00:07:32,170
They are at a bow and Arrow,
double,

127
00:07:32,171 --> 00:07:35,590
ultimately pointy entire alliance into a
new direction,

128
00:07:35,830 --> 00:07:39,910
embracing both the light and the dark
and individually choosing to sacrifice

129
00:07:39,911 --> 00:07:44,140
themselves for a greater good,
and it's exactly dispersonal sacrifice

130
00:07:44,141 --> 00:07:48,370
in service of a better future that
allows roque one to make it's final

131
00:07:48,371 --> 00:07:52,570
ascend to the top and to broadcast a
blueprint of the fodder that holds the

132
00:07:52,571 --> 00:07:55,540
key for a better world to reemerge down
the line.

133
00:07:55,690 --> 00:07:59,950
Because even though does sacrifice will
ultimately come at the cost of all of

134
00:07:59,951 --> 00:08:03,400
these characters lives,
it is not so much shown to be a negative

135
00:08:03,460 --> 00:08:06,340
as it is transcendent in his last
moments.

136
00:08:06,341 --> 00:08:10,630
The imperial defector Bodie overcome
this fear and shows courage in his heart

137
00:08:10,631 --> 00:08:14,350
as he establishes the radio connection
needed for the success of the mission.

138
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:17,330
Witnessing the heroic demise of his
friend Charit.

139
00:08:17,350 --> 00:08:21,910
This skeptical realist base has a last
minute change of heart and finally puts

140
00:08:21,911 --> 00:08:24,250
his trust in to force horse.

141
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:32,240
Even the analytical Kaytoo shows a sign
of humanity through his mechanical

142
00:08:32,241 --> 00:08:35,880
exterior in the end.
It's a line of courageous sacrifice

143
00:08:35,881 --> 00:08:39,980
based on hope and trust into force that
really all started with the define death

144
00:08:40,010 --> 00:08:42,530
of gins.
Mother followed by countless other

145
00:08:42,531 --> 00:08:47,531
allied characters from saw and galen to
numerous named and unnamed rebel marines

146
00:08:47,541 --> 00:08:50,990
and air force wings to cash in and jen
themselves.

147
00:08:51,170 --> 00:08:54,770
Their deaths are marked by an exuberant
and transcendent lightness,

148
00:08:54,990 --> 00:08:58,950
giving us a sense of redemption in a
positively charged sacrifice.

149
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:02,340
And it's here at the battle of
[inaudible] that the rebel alliance has

150
00:09:02,341 --> 00:09:06,840
really defined setting itself apart from
the tyrannical pathology and destructive

151
00:09:06,841 --> 00:09:11,340
selfishness of the empire and not just
because of its physical action of moving

152
00:09:11,370 --> 00:09:13,920
out of the shadow and facing the empire
head on.

153
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:17,140
But more importantly,
because of the all of inspiring action

154
00:09:17,230 --> 00:09:20,220
of a select few individuals,
Roque one,

155
00:09:20,221 --> 00:09:23,820
demonstrates that to save oneself is to
save the galaxy.

156
00:09:24,060 --> 00:09:28,560
It's about having the courage to climb
out of the bottom of the pit to defy

157
00:09:28,561 --> 00:09:31,350
overwhelming darkness,
both without and within,

158
00:09:31,670 --> 00:09:35,100
and to move upwards and self sacrifice
of the ICO itself,

159
00:09:35,130 --> 00:09:37,530
in order to retrieve the spirit of the
father,

160
00:09:37,970 --> 00:09:40,860
it's to emulate his star with a heart of
Cairo,

161
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:45,240
to be an inspiration for others to do
the same in hopes of manifesting a

162
00:09:45,241 --> 00:09:46,620
better future for all.

163
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:49,470
Nobody's listening.

164
00:10:08,090 --> 00:10:10,340
All right.
