1
00:00:03,780 --> 00:00:08,100
The breaking of the fourth wall has been
defined as a character acknowledging the

2
00:00:08,101 --> 00:00:10,800
existence of the audience outside of the
film.

3
00:00:11,010 --> 00:00:14,580
But besides merely recognizing the
existence of the separate reality,

4
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:17,130
Martin Scorsese,
shutter island actually invites the

5
00:00:17,131 --> 00:00:21,840
audience to completely identify with its
main character by placing the camera

6
00:00:21,870 --> 00:00:25,240
inside a mirror,
a the,

7
00:00:25,890 --> 00:00:27,710
uh.

8
00:00:36,350 --> 00:00:39,570
Now what's remarkable about this shot is
that it helps you clarify why

9
00:00:39,571 --> 00:00:42,930
consecutive viewings of shutter island
changed the experience of the film

10
00:00:42,931 --> 00:00:44,760
completely.
You could even say it at,

11
00:00:44,761 --> 00:00:47,130
it's like you're watching a completely
different film.

12
00:00:47,190 --> 00:00:51,340
We start off by watching and mystery
thriller about you was martial Teddy

13
00:00:51,340 --> 00:00:54,390
Daniels and a search warrant escape
patients from remote Ashlyn mental

14
00:00:54,391 --> 00:00:57,240
institution.
But mostly the story is about his search

15
00:00:57,241 --> 00:01:00,540
for the killer of his wife,
the arsonist and route latus who

16
00:01:00,541 --> 00:01:04,290
supposedly also a patient on the island.
As the story unravels,

17
00:01:04,291 --> 00:01:07,530
we find out that the two marshals
might've become the victim of a blog by

18
00:01:07,531 --> 00:01:11,130
Ashley through sinus and from revealing
dark secrets about the institution.

19
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:13,980
And it's only you had to climbing.
So the story that we discovered a real

20
00:01:13,981 --> 00:01:17,030
truth,
you're name is andrew latest.

21
00:01:17,140 --> 00:01:20,130
The 67th patient had dash cliff is you
andrew?

22
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:26,740
No.
I suspect most of yours were shocked by

23
00:01:26,741 --> 00:01:29,290
this plot twist and with the evidence
laid out and it's equal,

24
00:01:29,291 --> 00:01:32,050
might have fought and how did I not see
this before?

25
00:01:32,260 --> 00:01:34,860
However,
some people continue to deny teddy's

26
00:01:34,900 --> 00:01:39,850
true identity seeding that Ashlyn is in
fact a sort of of naziesque CIA lab of

27
00:01:39,851 --> 00:01:41,620
some kind.
So clear up some of these

28
00:01:41,621 --> 00:01:44,340
misunderstandings.
I will argue that the fourth wall newer

29
00:01:44,350 --> 00:01:48,280
shot is key to comprehending the truth
behind shutter island and how to fill

30
00:01:48,281 --> 00:01:52,060
manages to make audiences turn a blind
eye towards reality.

31
00:01:52,380 --> 00:01:57,380
Where are the kids?
It's important to note that the rector

32
00:01:57,721 --> 00:02:00,940
of Martin Scorsese stated in an
interview that the entire movie takes

33
00:02:00,941 --> 00:02:04,420
place inside of Teddy's head.
Notice that there's not a single scene

34
00:02:04,421 --> 00:02:08,140
that doesn't depict teddy as the focal
point of the story or even as seen

35
00:02:08,141 --> 00:02:10,690
without his mere presence.
On top of that,

36
00:02:10,691 --> 00:02:14,710
the audience is constantly reminded of
the tragic goodness of Andrew's made up.

37
00:02:14,711 --> 00:02:15,330
Karen.

38
00:02:15,330 --> 00:02:17,970
None an exactly square with teddy.
Danielle's the man,

39
00:02:17,971 --> 00:02:19,230
the legend that give you that

40
00:02:19,340 --> 00:02:23,240
Teddy's profession as a US marshall and
his role as protector of justice also

41
00:02:23,241 --> 00:02:27,770
give his character superiority over to
seemingly untrustworthy doctors of ash

42
00:02:27,771 --> 00:02:29,720
cliff,
and if that wasn't enough for the

43
00:02:29,721 --> 00:02:33,470
audience to aligned with Teddy,
he's also revealed to be a war hero

44
00:02:33,740 --> 00:02:37,280
having liberated victims of the
Holocaust from a Nazi concentration camp

45
00:02:37,550 --> 00:02:39,290
and from the get go.
It is obvious what's Teddy's

46
00:02:39,291 --> 00:02:41,810
preconceptions about the Asheville if
institution are

47
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:44,390
same,
something like that before.

48
00:02:45,110 --> 00:02:48,680
Both the framing and a dramatic,
almost menacing music playing in the

49
00:02:48,681 --> 00:02:52,940
background attitude unparalleled at this
facility might not be any less evil than

50
00:02:52,941 --> 00:02:56,900
the infamous Nazi death camps.
It's a real tragedy about his characters

51
00:02:56,901 --> 00:03:00,610
that he cannot come to terms with the
death of his and suffers from a massive

52
00:03:00,611 --> 00:03:04,300
amount of guilt for having executed a
number of cam guards during the war.

53
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:09,130
Teddy's really shown to be a victim
rather than a perpetrator and all of

54
00:03:09,131 --> 00:03:12,790
this really makes it difficult for the
audience not to fully aligned with the

55
00:03:12,791 --> 00:03:17,791
protagonist and really end up being just
as delusional as the main character

56
00:03:17,861 --> 00:03:18,694
himself.

57
00:03:23,140 --> 00:03:24,130
Andrew,
please do.

58
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,280
However,
even during the first viewing of the

59
00:03:27,281 --> 00:03:29,360
film,
you can already notice that Teddy's

60
00:03:29,380 --> 00:03:33,430
world is a little strange.
Many of the characters don't really seem

61
00:03:33,431 --> 00:03:36,730
to act as one would expect them to in
certain situations.

62
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:40,990
The guards seem to be irrationally on
Agis steadying chuck arrive and that's

63
00:03:40,991 --> 00:03:42,790
supposedly because of the escape
patient,

64
00:03:43,150 --> 00:03:44,870
but later shown to be bored.
When ted,

65
00:03:44,871 --> 00:03:46,990
he launches a search party on the
island.

66
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:49,030
Patients are waving and looking at
setting,

67
00:03:49,050 --> 00:03:52,750
but not a chuck and doctors and nurses
are kind of laughing at Teddy's attempts

68
00:03:52,751 --> 00:03:57,070
to interviewed him.
Very impression defense mechanisms.

69
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:01,030
Even chuck eggs out of character as he
struggles to get his firearm out of his

70
00:04:01,031 --> 00:04:03,490
belt.
Just seems like an odd thing to happen

71
00:04:03,491 --> 00:04:05,710
to you.
As Marshall and especially for film,

72
00:04:05,860 --> 00:04:10,060
it's a bit emphasis on such a subtle and
arguably insignificant occurrence and

73
00:04:10,070 --> 00:04:13,990
even said he shows irrational behavior
as he starts to act on impulse and

74
00:04:13,991 --> 00:04:18,100
becomes increasingly violent and
reckless in a search for a man who looks

75
00:04:18,101 --> 00:04:20,260
almost too fantastical to be real.

76
00:04:20,740 --> 00:04:23,590
Then there's the fact that the film has
a number of continuity errors that are

77
00:04:23,591 --> 00:04:27,000
so obvious that they kind of possibly,
you haven't missed buddy editor on

78
00:04:27,020 --> 00:04:28,540
accident.
In one scene,

79
00:04:28,541 --> 00:04:32,350
the character pretends to drink water
out of a nonexisting glass only for the

80
00:04:32,351 --> 00:04:34,660
glass,
so your peer empty in the next shot.

81
00:04:35,140 --> 00:04:38,450
These jump cuts enhance the feeling that
said he's living in a sort of dreamlike

82
00:04:38,470 --> 00:04:40,590
state.
Hence why both the character and

83
00:04:40,610 --> 00:04:43,900
audience start to question the realness
of the protagonists world.

84
00:04:44,110 --> 00:04:46,390
However,
all of this can still be explained with

85
00:04:46,391 --> 00:04:47,590
the argument.
That's the entire thing.

86
00:04:47,591 --> 00:04:50,800
It was just a set up and said he was
just being drugged and manipulated into

87
00:04:50,801 --> 00:04:53,830
believing that he is in fact the
perpetrator himself.

88
00:04:54,190 --> 00:04:55,060
Why are you here?

89
00:04:59,420 --> 00:05:03,590
I killed my wife.
Now there's really one scene or rather

90
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:07,800
one musical piece that quite subtly
manages to debunk this train of thought

91
00:05:08,250 --> 00:05:10,950
called tip top caroline and string.
It ain't mine.

92
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:14,040
Besides the fact that the music
parallels the general feeling of the

93
00:05:14,041 --> 00:05:16,320
scene.
Courtside for strings and piano and a

94
00:05:16,321 --> 00:05:20,490
minor by Gustav Mahler remains a rat or
odd choice of music to say the least

95
00:05:20,580 --> 00:05:23,490
receipt at the music triggers a response
in Teddy to brings him back to the

96
00:05:23,491 --> 00:05:25,650
headquarters with the Dachau
concentration camp.

97
00:05:25,651 --> 00:05:27,720
We're just seeing music was playing on a
record player.

98
00:05:28,170 --> 00:05:32,430
Now why is this odd?
Because Khrushchev Mahler was Jewish and

99
00:05:32,431 --> 00:05:34,680
his music was subsequently banned by the
Nazis.

100
00:05:34,860 --> 00:05:37,440
Secondly,
the quartet for strings belongs to malls

101
00:05:37,470 --> 00:05:41,100
earlier and lesser known work.
So why on earth would a s s chem water

102
00:05:41,101 --> 00:05:43,590
and a half this exact piece playing in
his headquarters?

103
00:05:43,850 --> 00:05:47,610
It seems highly unlikely that this event
actually happened and it makes us wonder

104
00:05:47,611 --> 00:05:51,720
about the reality of Teddy's memories.
The music adds a sort of grimm brothers'

105
00:05:51,721 --> 00:05:53,820
fairy till like quality to the memory.
Well,

106
00:05:53,821 --> 00:05:56,940
snow was falling everywhere and bodies
life frozen on the ground.

107
00:05:57,410 --> 00:06:01,220
The thing is real life footage shows
that there was no real snow to be seen

108
00:06:01,221 --> 00:06:04,910
during the liberation of the camp.
Adding further doubt about just how

109
00:06:04,911 --> 00:06:09,030
trustworthy you teddy's perspective is.
A little research also reveals the

110
00:06:09,031 --> 00:06:13,310
Mahler actually never finished a quartet
and had trouble finding his own voice

111
00:06:13,340 --> 00:06:15,920
leaving in fragmented and isolated in
between his work.

112
00:06:16,070 --> 00:06:20,480
The parallel of Andrew Dan seems obvious
as he struggles to find his own voice

113
00:06:20,481 --> 00:06:23,810
and hides behind the voice of Teddy
taking the ferry back in the morning,

114
00:06:24,650 --> 00:06:27,800
come on show,
and to prove that Andrew is in fact

115
00:06:27,801 --> 00:06:29,360
hiding behind this fake persona.

116
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:31,910
We only have to look at the opening
scene of the movie.

117
00:06:32,090 --> 00:06:34,040
After Teddy froze up,
he looks into the mirror,

118
00:06:34,070 --> 00:06:37,790
which in film often indicates that the
character has a split personality on top

119
00:06:37,791 --> 00:06:39,320
of that,
and you can see that half of this phase

120
00:06:39,321 --> 00:06:41,900
is illuminated by the sun,
whereas the other half is left in the

121
00:06:41,901 --> 00:06:43,970
dark,
signifying teddy's buried real

122
00:06:43,971 --> 00:06:47,060
personality even unknowingly states his
main goals,

123
00:06:47,061 --> 00:06:51,150
the entire story.
This theme returns multiple times and

124
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:54,770
comes to climates when Andrew's face
fully illuminated and is finally

125
00:06:54,771 --> 00:06:57,650
accepted reality as it is.
Or when did you notice that little

126
00:06:57,651 --> 00:07:00,980
bandaid on his forehead?
Now that's gone here to indicating that

127
00:07:00,981 --> 00:07:03,500
he is no longer covering up his wounded
personality.

128
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:05,180
Oh,
I remember that part where chuck is

129
00:07:05,181 --> 00:07:09,920
praising Daddy.
Notice that the legend also explains

130
00:07:09,921 --> 00:07:13,250
that Teddy's personality is not real,
but just a made up story.

131
00:07:13,370 --> 00:07:16,910
But the most important theme of all to
be found in the opening scene is a

132
00:07:16,911 --> 00:07:20,700
substance that both literally and
figuratively keeps us seen a float

133
00:07:21,020 --> 00:07:23,270
water.
So at the end of the story is revealed

134
00:07:23,271 --> 00:07:25,870
at Andrew's wife drown to children in
the lake and it's wide.

135
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:29,930
Teddy's so nauseated by water and like
psychological practice steady.

136
00:07:29,931 --> 00:07:33,560
You're slowly but surely put an
increasing contact with water until he

137
00:07:33,561 --> 00:07:37,460
ultimately comes as close to a strauma
as possible by diving into the sea.

138
00:07:37,700 --> 00:07:41,090
But Teddy's physical appearance and
demeanor also changed dramatically

139
00:07:41,091 --> 00:07:43,280
during the film.
He starts his journey with a rat or

140
00:07:43,281 --> 00:07:45,860
collected and no nonsense attitude
towards the world.

141
00:07:46,010 --> 00:07:48,680
But as the story progressed,
as he slowly stripped from the things

142
00:07:48,681 --> 00:07:52,130
that make him who he is versus gun,
then his clothes,

143
00:07:52,260 --> 00:07:55,400
then his attitude and ultimately his
entire made up self.

144
00:07:55,550 --> 00:07:58,160
As I stated earlier,
Andrew came up with Teddy's persona only

145
00:07:58,161 --> 00:08:01,370
because he was unable to deal with the
violence and guilt that he's had to

146
00:08:01,371 --> 00:08:06,371
endure in his life.
This sort of cyclical nature of violence

147
00:08:07,281 --> 00:08:11,240
and cruelty that is part of humanity and
in which he actively pursue because what

148
00:08:11,241 --> 00:08:16,241
ultimately drove andrew into insanity,
no matter how much he denies it away.

149
00:08:16,700 --> 00:08:18,920
Thanks for harmless,
but you can be controlled,

150
00:08:18,921 --> 00:08:19,754
but I know,

151
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:23,473
oh,

152
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:28,000
we've known each other for centuries.

153
00:08:29,180 --> 00:08:33,570
I also notice that the sadistic water
isn't named on purpose because wharton

154
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:38,610
is an Anagram for Andrew and there are
more of these anagrams to be found as is

155
00:08:38,611 --> 00:08:40,980
shown by Dr Kali at the climax of the
story,

156
00:08:41,160 --> 00:08:42,810
don't we?
Phil Sue explained to name of Teddy's

157
00:08:42,811 --> 00:08:45,960
faith partner chuck all who turns out
it's speed mysterious.

158
00:08:45,961 --> 00:08:48,480
Dr Nian couldn't tell the US Marshall's
office,

159
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:52,110
but that he's a defense mechanism.
Surprise mother fucker because

160
00:08:52,111 --> 00:08:55,080
fanatically chuck all sounds a lot like
chuckle,

161
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:58,490
which in turn indicates his character's
rule is jester or trickster.

162
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:01,830
Within the realm of story as a whole.
The side of companion characters are

163
00:09:01,831 --> 00:09:05,100
known for their miss chief and their
motivation to push to protagonist

164
00:09:05,130 --> 00:09:08,640
interchange and that only does chuck
trick teddy into believing that he is

165
00:09:08,641 --> 00:09:11,190
his partner,
but he also has an active interest in

166
00:09:11,191 --> 00:09:14,070
helping Andrew to accept reality as it
is.

167
00:09:14,510 --> 00:09:15,480
Nice.
Makes me one.

168
00:09:17,190 --> 00:09:18,023
Yeah.
WHATSAPP,

169
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:21,270
which would be worse.

170
00:09:23,110 --> 00:09:28,110
Live is a monster and a day is a good
man and to me this is the magic and

171
00:09:29,311 --> 00:09:32,400
brilliance of shutter island.
It knows it's burgers and making the

172
00:09:32,401 --> 00:09:36,480
audience identify fully with a fake
character and arguably manages to make

173
00:09:36,481 --> 00:09:40,410
us just as delusional as Andrew himself.
On top of that,

174
00:09:40,411 --> 00:09:44,060
it gives us a fascinating look into the
psychology of this tragic character

175
00:09:44,070 --> 00:09:48,930
trauma and the nature of reality.
It shows us just how powerful our minds

176
00:09:48,931 --> 00:09:53,600
can be and the perspective really is
everything because when we fully aligned

177
00:09:53,601 --> 00:09:55,530
with the point of view or a certain
belief,

178
00:09:55,800 --> 00:10:00,450
we sometimes feel to see the truth even
if it's laid out right in front of her

179
00:10:00,451 --> 00:10:05,451
eyes.
Switch light.

180
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:18,100
All right.
All right.

181
00:10:18,190 --> 00:10:20,700
Thank you guys so much for watching,
man.

182
00:10:20,860 --> 00:10:23,060
This really was a long ass video,
but,

183
00:10:23,061 --> 00:10:25,150
uh,
I hope it paid off for you in the end.

184

Uh,

187
00:10:31,211 --> 00:10:34,450

out and introduced many more people to
