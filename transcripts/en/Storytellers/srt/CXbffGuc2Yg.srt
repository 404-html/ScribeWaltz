1
00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:00,943
Yeah,

2
00:00:04,190 --> 00:00:07,580
inglorious bastards.
Due to my interest in water to in

3
00:00:07,581 --> 00:00:10,040
general,
it's sporadic use of different

4
00:00:10,041 --> 00:00:12,890
languages,
rear end damage and bolts.

5
00:00:12,980 --> 00:00:16,970
Historic revisionism is my favorite
Tarantino film so far.

6
00:00:17,360 --> 00:00:21,160
It was to my surprise,
therefore that film only got a 69 mets

7
00:00:21,210 --> 00:00:25,370
score on MDB.
It turns out that 17 or diverting from

8
00:00:25,371 --> 00:00:28,520
history angered some critics.
Jonathan Rosenbaum,

9
00:00:28,521 --> 00:00:31,400
for example,
call to film deeply offensive and

10
00:00:31,430 --> 00:00:34,910
morally akin to Holocaust denial to dos
critics.

11
00:00:34,911 --> 00:00:39,170
The history of the Holocaust is simply
too serious for Cij revisionism,

12
00:00:39,410 --> 00:00:43,010
too serious for Terantin or style or
cinematic violence,

13
00:00:43,011 --> 00:00:46,220
which is violence of course,
as exciting over the top,

14
00:00:46,230 --> 00:00:48,260
spectacle or even comedy.

15
00:00:52,410 --> 00:00:54,460
Oh man,
a shot in the face.

16
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:56,440
Do you do that?
I didn't mean to do.

17
00:00:56,441 --> 00:00:57,310
It was an accident

18
00:00:57,430 --> 00:00:59,940
check.
Nutrients from now you see it argued

19
00:00:59,950 --> 00:01:03,940
that with inglorious pastors,
Tarantino makes fun of his audience by

20
00:01:03,941 --> 00:01:08,170
drawing a parallel between the way the
Nazis enjoyed the mindless violence and

21
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:12,190
killing innovation sprite.
As we enjoyed the final instantly tino

22
00:01:12,191 --> 00:01:15,010
creates in his own film,
I was arguing for dead.

23
00:01:15,011 --> 00:01:19,090
It is not quite as simple as that.
As some of the comments on now you see

24
00:01:19,091 --> 00:01:22,900
it's video Poland doubts Terentino's
criticizing his audience for liking

25
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:25,630
violence would be the highest form of
hypocrisy.

26
00:01:25,870 --> 00:01:30,790
Terentino's pointed out multiple times
his law for cinematic violence as fun

27
00:01:30,820 --> 00:01:35,620
and entertaining spectacle I was argued
at with inglorious bastards.

28
00:01:35,650 --> 00:01:39,460
Tarantino not so much criticizes his
audience for Liking Violence,

29
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:44,540
bit tune historical Lens Explorers and
reflects upon the cinematic violence and

30
00:01:44,981 --> 00:01:48,610
cinema as a whole.
Many critics have pointed towards the

31
00:01:48,611 --> 00:01:52,600
final scene of inglorious pastors as
Tarantino declaring the film is a

32
00:01:52,620 --> 00:01:53,560
masterpiece.

33
00:01:57,250 --> 00:01:59,400
My
next

34
00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:03,300
yes.
If you look back in the film,

35
00:02:03,301 --> 00:02:06,060
he places himself in question and more
company

36
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:19,020
when now you see it's comparison to
violence in a nation sprites to defiance

37
00:02:19,030 --> 00:02:22,270
of the bastards.
He fills to see important differences in

38
00:02:22,271 --> 00:02:26,200
their cinematic styles.
The Nazi film stills the nutshell or a

39
00:02:26,201 --> 00:02:28,840
nation sprites,
which is featured in the climax of

40
00:02:28,841 --> 00:02:33,841
inglorious bastards is a parallel to
triomphe desk villains from Leni

41
00:02:33,940 --> 00:02:35,920
Riefenstahl,
who is mentioned multiple times in the

42
00:02:35,921 --> 00:02:36,540
movie,

43
00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:41,540
think it kind of getting you up
the

44
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:45,050
violence in the nation.
Sprite is shults into fascist the

45
00:02:45,150 --> 00:02:47,780
headache.
Susan Sonntag also referring to

46
00:02:47,790 --> 00:02:50,390
Riefenstahl states that the fascist
aesthetic,

47
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:55,270
our tales of longing for high places of
the men and Barf to Uber Manch while in

48
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:58,190
the area and ideal that is placed above
all else.

49
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:02,380
The boss is to the contrary,
represented multicultural collective of

50
00:03:02,381 --> 00:03:05,560
the American melting pots.
They come from different places and

51
00:03:05,561 --> 00:03:09,790
backgrounds and in their difference are
challenged to the area in aesthetic that

52
00:03:09,791 --> 00:03:12,100
Google's promotes in a nation.
Surprise.

53
00:03:12,670 --> 00:03:15,580
Now,
the opening scene often pastorates is

54
00:03:15,581 --> 00:03:19,900
already a break with typical Tarantino
West cinematic violence.

55
00:03:19,930 --> 00:03:21,820
Yes,
it is explosive birth.

56
00:03:21,850 --> 00:03:26,770
It doesn't function so much as spectacle
or comedy as Terentino's violence

57
00:03:26,771 --> 00:03:30,400
usually does.
Terentino's constructs the scene in such

58
00:03:30,401 --> 00:03:35,401
a way slowly building to Hans Landa,
that explosion of violence feels quite

59
00:03:35,651 --> 00:03:39,910
horrific and quite cruel.
Making this opening chapter feel more

60
00:03:39,911 --> 00:03:43,690
like a scene from a holocaust film than
Terentino's normal.

61
00:03:43,691 --> 00:03:46,300
Don't worry,
it's only a movie kind of violence.

62
00:03:48,770 --> 00:03:51,410
Of course,
this isn't the case in the next chapter

63
00:03:51,411 --> 00:03:56,330
where we meet the bastards here,
violence is both spectacle and comedy.

64
00:03:56,630 --> 00:04:01,090
Although rain even directly mentioned
the link between cinema and violence as

65
00:04:01,110 --> 00:04:04,730
sources of entertainment,
to hear you say that,

66
00:04:05,090 --> 00:04:06,950
quite frankly,
close,

67
00:04:07,170 --> 00:04:12,080
we're getting going to the movies.
These first two chapters function in two

68
00:04:12,081 --> 00:04:15,380
ways.
Both teens are completely different in

69
00:04:15,381 --> 00:04:19,430
their tone and fuel and violence.
She had two scenes are also very much

70
00:04:19,431 --> 00:04:22,790
alike.
Both feature a commander that claims to

71
00:04:22,791 --> 00:04:27,300
have come down from the mountains to
take part in the war who is in control

72
00:04:27,310 --> 00:04:31,670
of the narrative and directs the scene
to watch its final conclusion.

73
00:04:32,030 --> 00:04:36,590
Yet the violence in the first chapter
feels cruel and horrific while in the

74
00:04:36,591 --> 00:04:38,990
second chapter at a spectacle and the
comedy,

75
00:04:39,260 --> 00:04:41,930
of course,
we're in a culture we naturally and

76
00:04:41,931 --> 00:04:45,920
rightfully so route for the allies and
it's not for the Nazis yet.

77
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:51,200
Tino does hint that the officer who is
beaten to death is an honorable man.

78
00:04:54,510 --> 00:04:55,343
Juice.

79
00:04:59,290 --> 00:05:02,950
Tarantino deffer shows that through
cinematic techniques such as the

80
00:05:02,951 --> 00:05:05,950
soundtrack,
firelands can have two totally different

81
00:05:05,951 --> 00:05:08,430
functions into fairly similar scene.

82
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:16,560
The second function is to make clear the
distinction between the Boston arts and

83
00:05:16,561 --> 00:05:21,180
Shoshana as characters.
Although most of the bosses are Jewish,

84
00:05:21,210 --> 00:05:23,880
they come from different places and
backgrounds.

85
00:05:23,940 --> 00:05:28,380
They are a multicultural ragtag group
that merged into a greater American

86
00:05:28,381 --> 00:05:32,790
whole with the goal to bring terror to
the Nazis were going to be doing one

87
00:05:32,791 --> 00:05:37,260
thing and one thing only.
Killing Nancy's Shoshana,

88
00:05:37,340 --> 00:05:40,380
however,
is defined by her identity as a Jewish

89
00:05:40,381 --> 00:05:44,490
victims of the Holocaust.
For awhile she adopts the identity of a

90
00:05:44,491 --> 00:05:47,280
French girl,
but she never forgets what happened to

91
00:05:47,281 --> 00:05:51,330
her and her family.
Now the film builds towards a claim

92
00:05:51,490 --> 00:05:56,400
where boats have Shana and the Boston
execute a revenge plots on Hitler and

93
00:05:56,440 --> 00:06:01,440
Nazi Mount.
Both French plots together resulted in

94
00:06:03,061 --> 00:06:07,350
what seems to be a typical Terentino's
sheen over the top violence.

95
00:06:07,410 --> 00:06:09,420
Yes,
they are affect different narrative

96
00:06:09,421 --> 00:06:11,910
conclusions that's compete with each
other.

97
00:06:12,450 --> 00:06:16,680
The Boston burst in shoot Hitler and
goebbels to bits and then blow up the

98
00:06:16,681 --> 00:06:18,900
whole theater,
including themselves.

99
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:20,820
Domain boster.
It's all the rain,

100
00:06:20,821 --> 00:06:23,320
however,
survives and Indians to Boston.

101
00:06:23,321 --> 00:06:27,660
It's narrative is one of the rugged
American cowboy that's rights into town,

102
00:06:27,690 --> 00:06:31,950
kills the ins against impossible odds
and writes outs round recently,

103
00:06:35,310 --> 00:06:36,143
scalper Herman

104
00:06:38,090 --> 00:06:41,300
through this Lens.
It is indeed very arguable that

105
00:06:41,301 --> 00:06:45,920
inglorious bastards to field licensed
the horror of the Holocaust and evils of

106
00:06:45,921 --> 00:06:48,290
the Nazi regime against the Jewish
people.

107
00:06:48,590 --> 00:06:52,050
However,
although the film ends with the Boston

108
00:06:52,050 --> 00:06:53,840
Shoshana's for your French still
lingers,

109
00:06:53,930 --> 00:06:58,160
which plays are darker and more
unsettling than that of the bastards

110
00:07:08,490 --> 00:07:12,880
who you French for Christ or own
extinction who refer plays out from

111
00:07:12,881 --> 00:07:15,880
beyond the grave,
while her image becomes embedded in

112
00:07:15,881 --> 00:07:18,820
smoke,
connecting it to otherwise referenced

113
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:23,840
horrors off to concentration camps.
She rises from a moment of greatest

114
00:07:24,191 --> 00:07:28,300
vulnerability as Sheila is dying to
reach an ambivalent triumph,

115
00:07:28,630 --> 00:07:33,460
she has other to refer on the people who
murdered her family and countless

116
00:07:33,461 --> 00:07:36,190
others,
so for people gazing at them from the

117
00:07:36,191 --> 00:07:41,191
smoke and ashes of the very furnished,
constructed to destroyer s with the boss

118
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:44,590
stood staring.
Tino fulfills this revenge fantasy on

119
00:07:44,591 --> 00:07:47,080
the Nazis.
True Shushana's narrative.

120
00:07:47,140 --> 00:07:52,140
Yet her narrative is much more aware of
the Holocaust and Jewish suffering under

121
00:07:52,511 --> 00:07:53,980
the Nazis.
The film.

122
00:07:53,981 --> 00:07:57,760
This offers two distinct narratives and
the question becomes,

123
00:07:57,761 --> 00:08:01,750
who has effect guilty clearer?
Who does the audience see as the main

124
00:08:01,751 --> 00:08:04,270
drive for revenge?
Technically,

125
00:08:04,271 --> 00:08:07,000
the pastor's son,
although gets the last word,

126
00:08:07,060 --> 00:08:11,260
yet for dose watching,
it's Kenneth escaped a haunting sense

127
00:08:11,290 --> 00:08:15,040
that it was someone else,
someone in the smoke that by now it's

128
00:08:15,041 --> 00:08:18,130
dispersed to the winds who really killed
Hitler.

129
00:08:20,790 --> 00:08:23,160
Right.
Thank you everyone for watching and
