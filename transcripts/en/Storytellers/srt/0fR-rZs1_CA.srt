1
00:00:03,570 --> 00:00:06,870
For me.
A movie that's brilliantly combines both

2
00:00:06,871 --> 00:00:11,340
cinematic storytelling and social
critique is David fincher's,

3
00:00:11,341 --> 00:00:16,230
the social network,
the movie centers around it's Mark

4
00:00:16,230 --> 00:00:20,010
Zuckerburg plate by Jesse Eisenberg and
the creation of facebook.

5
00:00:20,450 --> 00:00:25,450
Now the work of director David fincher
is known for dark central teams of

6
00:00:25,471 --> 00:00:29,220
mccarver firelands crime broken
psychology.

7
00:00:29,750 --> 00:00:34,080
His major characters range from
emotionally closed off to depressed and

8
00:00:34,081 --> 00:00:37,420
schizophrenia to complete psychopathic
serial killer.

9
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:42,600
She begged for her life.
She begged for her life set up and for

10
00:00:42,601 --> 00:00:47,601
the life of the baby inside of her.
Knowing this,

11
00:00:49,630 --> 00:00:53,710
I think it's easy to predict the social
network is not going to be your average

12
00:00:53,740 --> 00:00:56,410
run of the mill young struggling
entrepreneur success story.

13
00:00:56,890 --> 00:01:00,460
This already becomes clear in the
soundtrack during the opening credits.

14
00:01:00,910 --> 00:01:04,640
This piece of music that's returns
multiple times in the movie combines the

15
00:01:04,641 --> 00:01:08,650
saft piano tune in an uneasy tension
creating file in behind it.

16
00:01:09,330 --> 00:01:13,090
The score created by Trent reznor
already illustrates the major teams of

17
00:01:13,091 --> 00:01:16,140
the movie named Leah,
broken loneliness and a seating anger,

18
00:01:16,150 --> 00:01:17,650
a thirst for power underneath it.

19
00:01:24,390 --> 00:01:26,880
So the question is,
what does the social network really

20
00:01:26,881 --> 00:01:28,650
about?
Let's get started.

21
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:33,480
The narrative of the movie doesn't rely
so much on the creation of facebook to

22
00:01:33,481 --> 00:01:36,660
be a good story.
The central teams can also be found in

23
00:01:36,661 --> 00:01:38,460
many important stories throughout
history.

24
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:42,920
It's the right off the film.
Aaron Sorkin says it's not a movie about

25
00:01:42,921 --> 00:01:45,080
facebook.
It's a movie set against the backdrop of

26
00:01:45,081 --> 00:01:49,730
facebook,
but really it's the themes and this move

27
00:01:49,731 --> 00:01:51,470
yours.
All the storytelling itself,

28
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:56,920
the as he calls them Shakespearean teams
that and is talking about are things

29
00:01:57,081 --> 00:01:58,010
like power,
hunger,

30
00:01:58,040 --> 00:02:00,220
social class section,
love,

31
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:05,230
friendship,
loyalty and betrayal only friend.

32
00:02:08,590 --> 00:02:09,423
Yeah.

33
00:02:12,770 --> 00:02:17,060
These teams are embedded in a plot that
focuses on the relationships that Mark

34
00:02:17,060 --> 00:02:19,490
Hass and destroys during the creation of
facebook.

35
00:02:19,730 --> 00:02:22,340
The narrative for stores from the
prospective of two hearings,

36
00:02:22,370 --> 00:02:27,050
one buyer market sued by his former best
friend and another where Marc sued by

37
00:02:27,051 --> 00:02:30,500
its competitors.
The opening act and all the seats that's

38
00:02:30,501 --> 00:02:34,790
folks on the creation of facebook are in
fact flashbacks solely ever feeling the

39
00:02:34,791 --> 00:02:39,791
reasons mark it suits for fucking over
as best friends potentially stealing the

40
00:02:39,861 --> 00:02:43,810
idea of facebook from this competition.
Do you see any of your code on facebook?

41
00:02:44,170 --> 00:02:45,800
I,
I use any of your coke,

42
00:02:46,190 --> 00:02:51,190
she stole our whole Goddamn idea.
match.com for hiring and you know,

43
00:02:51,951 --> 00:02:54,800
you really don't need it forensics team
to get to the bottom of this and if you

44
00:02:54,801 --> 00:02:58,670
guys were the inventors of facebook ad
to Facebook,

45
00:02:59,610 --> 00:03:03,570
it is certainly true that the film's
plot can't stand on its own as a strong

46
00:03:03,580 --> 00:03:06,070
end entertaining story.
Yet in my opinion,

47
00:03:06,071 --> 00:03:09,760
to see the creation of facebook and as
just the background of the story does

48
00:03:09,761 --> 00:03:13,000
not do the film justice.
Facebook as the biggest and most

49
00:03:13,001 --> 00:03:16,520
powerful social let's book in the world
is a fascinating subject for media

50
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:20,350
scholars and a lot of questions and
critique and it's working.

51
00:03:20,420 --> 00:03:23,020
Yes,
found within the plot dialogue and

52
00:03:23,170 --> 00:03:25,200
especially the character's personality,

53
00:03:25,940 --> 00:03:28,280
you have part of my attention,
you have a minimum amount.

54
00:03:28,430 --> 00:03:31,730
The rest of my attention is back at the
offices of facebook where my colleagues

55
00:03:31,731 --> 00:03:34,550
and I are doing things that no one in
this room including and especially your

56
00:03:34,551 --> 00:03:37,130
clients or intellectually or creatively
capable of doing.

57
00:03:37,970 --> 00:03:40,460
I want to look at this from a couple of
different perspectives,

58
00:03:40,490 --> 00:03:44,540
building it up and important,
but first I have to say many scholars

59
00:03:44,541 --> 00:03:48,150
have found positive aspects of facebook.
Since you know the nature of finches

60
00:03:48,151 --> 00:03:50,470
work,
we are mainly discussing critique on

61
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:52,970
facebook,
which of course it's very important

62
00:03:52,971 --> 00:03:55,520
critique,
but it does mean facebook is something

63
00:03:55,521 --> 00:03:57,410
evil that only as negative for
infection.

64
00:03:57,440 --> 00:04:00,800
Social life for example,
if facebook has had very positive

65
00:04:00,801 --> 00:04:05,120
effects on weak social ties,
meaning that week social relations such

66
00:04:05,121 --> 00:04:08,080
as holiday friends,
which are problematic because of this.

67
00:04:08,100 --> 00:04:10,430
This can stay active.
Thanks you facebook.

68
00:04:10,730 --> 00:04:12,710
Now back to the fields critique or
facebook.

69
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:16,820
A major issue of the recent years is
incident Boudin and the nature of the

70
00:04:16,821 --> 00:04:20,030
comment sections,
discussions on social and political

71
00:04:20,031 --> 00:04:23,780
issues of quickly escalate right for
comments on mine for victims of

72
00:04:23,781 --> 00:04:25,460
bullying.
Often in high school,

73
00:04:25,461 --> 00:04:29,980
the bullying continues to facebook when
they come home and the social network,

74
00:04:29,981 --> 00:04:34,330
when mark gets broken up with he blocks
hatefully about his ex girlfriend when

75
00:04:34,331 --> 00:04:37,360
he tries to apologize.
She perfectly explains the nature of

76
00:04:37,361 --> 00:04:39,370
Internet bullying in a couple of lights.

77
00:04:39,890 --> 00:04:41,600
The Internet's not written in Pencil
mark.

78
00:04:41,610 --> 00:04:45,990
It's written in ink and you published an
eric all Brits and Bitch right before

79
00:04:45,991 --> 00:04:48,570
you made some ignorant crack about my
family's name,

80
00:04:48,980 --> 00:04:51,330
my bra size,
and then graded women based on their

81
00:04:51,331 --> 00:04:54,420
hotness.
You write your snipe bullshit from a

82
00:04:54,421 --> 00:04:57,300
dark room because that's what the angry
do nowadays,

83
00:04:58,870 --> 00:05:00,970
June,
the beginning of the film off to Moscow

84
00:05:00,971 --> 00:05:02,770
from,
so I'll put him in the opening scene.

85
00:05:03,100 --> 00:05:06,690
Mark also creates a website where you
can rank the university's girls in the

86
00:05:06,691 --> 00:05:09,300
hotness against each other.
The scene intercut,

87
00:05:09,301 --> 00:05:13,750
secretion and immediate popularity of
this website against a fraternity party

88
00:05:13,751 --> 00:05:17,580
where girls are brought in on a bus and
are clearly sexually objectified.

89
00:05:18,310 --> 00:05:21,400
This illustrates beautifully how the
sexual objectification of girls and

90
00:05:21,401 --> 00:05:24,880
college is digitalized,
creating a sort of power shift from the

91
00:05:24,881 --> 00:05:27,550
fraternity,
popular jocks to show called nerds.

92
00:05:27,580 --> 00:05:30,250
That's created the website at the end of
the scene.

93
00:05:30,251 --> 00:05:32,800
Even the jokes at the party are clicking
on the website.

94
00:05:33,010 --> 00:05:37,000
This is the key of the film's critiques.
It's concentrating on the digitalization

95
00:05:37,030 --> 00:05:40,900
of the social experience of college,
not only in the front birds but also the

96
00:05:40,901 --> 00:05:45,190
hard parts such as social hierarchy,
exclusion and rejection

97
00:05:47,370 --> 00:05:52,140
and talking about taking the entire
social experience of college and putting

98
00:05:52,141 --> 00:05:54,030
it online.
I can't feel my legs.

99
00:05:54,150 --> 00:05:56,610
I know I'm totally psyched about this
too,

100
00:05:56,611 --> 00:05:57,770
but pardot.
Yeah,

101
00:05:58,190 --> 00:06:02,480
it would be exclusive.
See in a world where social structure

102
00:06:02,481 --> 00:06:05,870
was everything,
that was the thing.

103
00:06:06,110 --> 00:06:09,350
This brings us back to the original
themes of sadness and anger in the

104
00:06:09,351 --> 00:06:13,550
opening credits soundtrack and we see
facebook as a digitalization of social

105
00:06:13,551 --> 00:06:15,680
life.
We have to look at the social life of

106
00:06:15,681 --> 00:06:18,620
its creator already in the opening scene
of the film,

107
00:06:18,621 --> 00:06:22,280
much becomes clear about mark's
motivations is obsessed with getting

108
00:06:22,281 --> 00:06:25,310
into a final club because of the social
standing it would provide,

109
00:06:25,910 --> 00:06:29,390
but because of this he completely misses
out that his girlfriend is trying to

110
00:06:29,391 --> 00:06:32,570
have real conversation with him and he
has condescending to her social

111
00:06:32,571 --> 00:06:33,050
conditioning.

112
00:06:33,050 --> 00:06:34,550
You want to tell you that?
I think you might want to be a little

113
00:06:34,551 --> 00:06:36,030
more supportive.
I get in,

114
00:06:36,260 --> 00:06:39,770
I will be taking you to the events and
the gatherings and they'll be meeting a

115
00:06:39,771 --> 00:06:41,000
lot of people you wouldn't normally get
to

116
00:06:43,260 --> 00:06:44,093
me.

117
00:06:46,670 --> 00:06:51,230
Mark solution to his inability and anger
about not being able to create authentic

118
00:06:51,231 --> 00:06:55,190
social relations is to become obsessed
with improving his position in the

119
00:06:55,220 --> 00:06:58,070
social hierarchy of college.
GM tyree.

120
00:06:58,071 --> 00:07:00,560
In his paper,
the dislike button says one of the

121
00:07:00,561 --> 00:07:03,800
problems of facebook is that it's like
the Ikea of the mind.

122
00:07:04,250 --> 00:07:08,760
We riding users who generate an endless
flow of good news and consumable tidbits

123
00:07:08,780 --> 00:07:11,690
of their own interiority,
stream of folks' consciousness.

124
00:07:11,691 --> 00:07:14,360
That next one seem more cheerful,
more entrepreneurial,

125
00:07:14,420 --> 00:07:17,610
and more boring than anyone,
but someone ever wants to be friend.

126
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:19,580
This is what we see in Mark's
personality.

127
00:07:19,970 --> 00:07:22,070
Instead of trying to mend broken
relations,

128
00:07:22,290 --> 00:07:23,620
the solution,
it's a train peer,

129
00:07:23,630 --> 00:07:26,240
more successful hoping that people were
accepting,

130
00:07:26,820 --> 00:07:27,653
hey,
that was great.

131
00:07:27,870 --> 00:07:29,730
That was the right thing.
You apologize.

132
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:41,560
At the end of the movie,
Marcus destroying every authentic social

133
00:07:41,561 --> 00:07:43,900
relationship,
living more in the social fantasy of

134
00:07:43,930 --> 00:07:45,370
facebook.
Why it in?

135
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:48,040
As Justin Timberlake's character says,
yeah,

136
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:51,700
mark's former best friend.
Still try it one more time to finally

137
00:07:51,701 --> 00:07:56,701
break to thus revealing a desire for
intimacy for a messy but real human

138
00:07:56,861 --> 00:07:57,694
contact.

139
00:08:03,770 --> 00:08:08,770
Yes.
You wish your 24 million new shares of

140
00:08:10,711 --> 00:08:14,270
stock.
You were told that if you investors come

141
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:16,440
up on your shares diluted,
how much were his,

142
00:08:17,130 --> 00:08:20,970
you signed the papers you sent me.
You're going to blame me because here

143
00:08:20,971 --> 00:08:23,550
were the business head of the company
and you made a bad business deal with

144
00:08:23,551 --> 00:08:25,410
your own company.
It's going to be like I'm not a part of

145
00:08:25,411 --> 00:08:27,450
facebook won't be like you're not a part
of facebook.

146
00:08:27,540 --> 00:08:29,370
You're not a part of facebook names on
the masthead.

147
00:08:29,550 --> 00:08:32,200
You might want to check again cause I
froze the account.

148
00:08:32,230 --> 00:08:34,560
I think we were going to let you parade
around in your ridiculous suits

149
00:08:34,561 --> 00:08:36,850
pretending you were running the second
broad.

150
00:08:36,860 --> 00:08:40,560
Is it the cleaners along with my hoodie
and my fuck you flip flops.

151
00:08:40,710 --> 00:08:43,200
You pretentious Douche back securities
here.

152
00:08:43,201 --> 00:08:45,240
You'll be leaving now not signing those
papers.

153
00:08:45,330 --> 00:08:48,630
We will get the signature.
Tell me this isn't about me Kenny.

154
00:08:48,631 --> 00:08:53,631
It's the phoenix.
I knew you did it.

155
00:08:54,631 --> 00:08:57,360
You planted the story about the chicken.
I didn't find the story.

156
00:08:57,900 --> 00:08:59,930
What's he talking about?
The accused of animal cruelty.

157
00:08:59,931 --> 00:09:01,800
Seriously,
what the hell is the chicken and all

158
00:09:01,801 --> 00:09:03,300
back what?
You hated the off,

159
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:07,140
so they identified me as a cofounder of
facebook,

160
00:09:07,260 --> 00:09:10,500
which I am,
you bet our lawyer up asshole because

161
00:09:10,501 --> 00:09:14,940
I'm not coming back for 30% I'm coming
back for everything.

162
00:09:17,170 --> 00:09:19,450
In the end.
This film is just an interpretation of

163
00:09:19,451 --> 00:09:22,150
the events and great as a facebook,
he had a gift,

164
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:25,810
some strong critique on facebook backers
in a wild story off power,

165
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:30,670
friendship and betrayal suggesting in
the end that the most successful social

166
00:09:30,671 --> 00:09:35,260
network in the world was created by
someone who else just trying to fit in.

167
00:09:38,990 --> 00:09:40,820
Hey guys,
thanks for watching and the social

168
00:09:40,821 --> 00:09:44,690
network is one of my favorite movies and
it was a lot of fun to analyze it.

169
00:09:45,290 --> 00:09:48,080
I still think there's a lot more in this
movie that can be explored,

170
00:09:48,081 --> 00:09:50,690
so I would encourage you to watch it to
yourself.

171
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:55,850
The next video will be about apocalypse
now and a duality for if you have any

172
00:09:55,851 --> 00:10:00,110
ideas or thoughts on this analyze.
I would encourage you to comment in the

173
00:10:00,111 --> 00:10:01,820
comment section below,
