1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:01,073
Yeah,

2
00:00:03,430 --> 00:00:08,430
awhile ago I stumbled upon this poem by
Charles Bukowski on what it takes to be

3
00:00:09,431 --> 00:00:10,264
a writer.

4
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:14,590
If it doesn't come bursting out of you
in spite of everything,

5
00:00:15,560 --> 00:00:20,560
don't do it as it comes out of your
heart and your mind and your mouth and

6
00:00:20,631 --> 00:00:22,250
your gut.
Don't do it.

7
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:27,620
If you have to sit up for hours staring
at your computer screen or hunched over

8
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:30,400
your typewriter,
searching the words,

9
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:33,830
don't do it.
If it's hard work,

10
00:00:33,890 --> 00:00:38,890
just thinking about doing it.
Don't do it unless it comes out of your

11
00:00:39,261 --> 00:00:42,890
soul like a rugged,
unless being still would drive you to

12
00:00:42,891 --> 00:00:47,891
madness or suicide or murder known.
Do it when it is truly time.

13
00:00:49,310 --> 00:00:52,400
If you have been chosen,
it will do it.

14
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:57,520
I itself and then it will keep on doing
it until you die or it dies in you.

15
00:00:59,930 --> 00:01:04,880
There is no other way and never was.

16
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:13,240
His message of course extends to other
creative professions from directing to

17
00:01:13,610 --> 00:01:18,610
composing music to painting or even
sports and although I think it's a

18
00:01:19,371 --> 00:01:24,371
beautiful poem and quite a romantic way
of looking at creative endeavors.

19
00:01:24,890 --> 00:01:28,340
He's also horribly and sentimentally
wrong.

20
00:01:29,670 --> 00:01:34,670
History is filled with creative geniuses
were it didn't just came bursting out of

21
00:01:34,831 --> 00:01:37,470
them.
Take some of our current superintendent

22
00:01:37,471 --> 00:01:38,880
riders,
for example,

23
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:44,540
from Aaron Sorkin who describes having a
perpetual writer's block to George r

24
00:01:45,301 --> 00:01:48,660
Martin,
who can't seem to finish his new book to

25
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:52,050
Terentino's,
who has spoken about how difficult it is

26
00:01:52,051 --> 00:01:57,000
to be staring at an empty piece of paper
where somehow his new movie needs Sapir

27
00:01:57,150 --> 00:02:01,230
and finally Robert Mckee,
writer of the Bible and screenwriting,

28
00:02:01,260 --> 00:02:04,410
who claims he is the biggest
procrastinator in the world.

29
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:09,660
I think for these creative minds,
birth asa for you,

30
00:02:09,690 --> 00:02:13,500
me and many others,
the more excited you are about your

31
00:02:13,501 --> 00:02:16,020
creative endeavor,
the bigger the project,

32
00:02:16,021 --> 00:02:19,050
and to more important to fulfilling your
dreams,

33
00:02:19,110 --> 00:02:22,350
the harder it is to actually sit down
and do it.

34
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:24,870
The trap that many writers,
including myself,

35
00:02:24,871 --> 00:02:29,340
fall into mainly consists of staring
motionless at a blank page.

36
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:32,610
It's not that we don't want to write or
that we don't have the ability to put

37
00:02:32,611 --> 00:02:35,730
words down on the page.
We just don't have any good ideas.

38
00:02:35,790 --> 00:02:38,340
It's not a fun place to be.
Believe me,

39
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:43,350
Steven Pressfield states there was a
secret that real writers know that want

40
00:02:43,351 --> 00:02:45,010
to be writer,
stones it.

41
00:02:45,011 --> 00:02:49,800
It's not the writing part that's hard.
What's hard is sitting down to write and

42
00:02:49,801 --> 00:02:52,710
he calls this force that keeps us from
sitting down.

43
00:02:52,860 --> 00:02:53,820
Resistance.

44
00:02:55,680 --> 00:03:00,680
Resistance according to Pressfield,
is what stands the life we live and are

45
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:04,600
in lifts.
Life stands between us enter dreams or

46
00:03:04,601 --> 00:03:07,630
for we want to become and what we want
to create.

47
00:03:08,140 --> 00:03:11,150
Are you a writer that doesn't write?
A painter,

48
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:15,700
doesn't paint an entrepreneur that never
starts adventure,

49
00:03:15,790 --> 00:03:18,520
then you have fallen victim to
resistance.

50
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:22,300
Resistance is to be taken seriously,
says pressfield's.

51
00:03:22,330 --> 00:03:26,090
It has to be declared evil.
Millions have been defeated by it.

52
00:03:26,110 --> 00:03:30,070
Dreams of diets because one gave up or
never dare to starts.

53
00:03:30,130 --> 00:03:34,270
It is therefore essential to learn to
recognize resistance and learn how to

54
00:03:34,271 --> 00:03:37,120
beat it.
Pressfield gives a beautiful description

55
00:03:37,121 --> 00:03:41,140
of resistance.
He states that resistance is invisible

56
00:03:41,141 --> 00:03:44,290
and internal.
We might think that it is friends,

57
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:45,250
jobs,
bets,

58
00:03:45,251 --> 00:03:48,160
or the Internet that keeps us from our
creative work.

59
00:03:48,161 --> 00:03:49,510
Birth that's false.

60
00:03:50,590 --> 00:03:53,200
Hungry.
I should get coffee.

61
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:56,450
Coffee would help me think pressure,
right,

62
00:03:56,451 --> 00:03:58,630
something purse,
then reward myself with coffee,

63
00:03:59,710 --> 00:04:00,790
coffee,
and a muffin.

64
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:04,290
Okay,
so I need to establish the scenes

65
00:04:06,820 --> 00:04:09,670
maybe been not good enough.

66
00:04:10,970 --> 00:04:14,400
The force of resistance,
stent thrombosis to engage with these

67
00:04:14,401 --> 00:04:17,330
things and procrastinates comes from
ourselves.

68
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:20,870
Resistance is to self generate enemy
from within.

69
00:04:21,980 --> 00:04:26,980
Resistance is most commonly expressed in
procrastination because it is the

70
00:04:27,081 --> 00:04:31,460
easiest to rationalize our starts bit.
I'll start tomorrow.

71
00:04:32,050 --> 00:04:34,880
There was one week when you wore
sweatpants.

72
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:47,210
Of course.
Resistant school is to have a seeing

73
00:04:47,211 --> 00:04:51,800
this until our deathbeds.
Other manifestations of resistance can

74
00:04:51,801 --> 00:04:54,790
be indulging in alcohol,
sex Mr Batian,

75
00:04:54,860 --> 00:04:57,260
TV,
gossip and eating fat,

76
00:04:57,261 --> 00:04:59,030
sugar,
salt and chocolate.

77
00:04:59,540 --> 00:05:04,320
Prestfield describes that indulging is
not always a manifestation of

78
00:05:04,350 --> 00:05:06,110
resistance,
but if fuel,

79
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:10,280
hello and unfulfilled afterwards,
it's probably was.

80
00:05:10,790 --> 00:05:15,440
We subconsciously know that we gave up
our longterm goal for instant

81
00:05:15,441 --> 00:05:18,380
gratification.
Resistance Speedos?

82
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:19,360
Yeah.
Out there.

83
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:22,060
Sticking your Dick in anything that
moves.

84
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:24,220
I'm trying to get back at me,
which is fine.

85
00:05:26,050 --> 00:05:29,740
Do you know what the worst thing is?
You're not writing.

86
00:05:31,180 --> 00:05:33,610
You have this gift.
You have this incredible talent and

87
00:05:33,611 --> 00:05:36,510
you're just flushing it down.
The toilet resistance

88
00:05:36,510 --> 00:05:39,570
expresses itself when you create drama
in your life,

89
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:43,500
claim victim hood when you spent your
time criticizing others,

90
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:48,240
when you turn your life into a soap or
when you rationalize a way while you

91
00:05:48,241 --> 00:05:52,800
haven't started yet as a working artist
doesn't accept this kind of self

92
00:05:52,801 --> 00:05:57,240
destructive behavior in his life because
it prevents him from his work.

93
00:05:59,190 --> 00:06:03,350
Yet resistance can be helpful.
Resistance points us to our true

94
00:06:03,351 --> 00:06:06,440
calling.
It's can be felt when we fear starting a

95
00:06:06,441 --> 00:06:09,170
creative project.
Does fear mean stead?

96
00:06:09,171 --> 00:06:13,400
It is something that we need to do
something we have a deep love for.

97
00:06:13,580 --> 00:06:16,550
If she didn't love project,
that's terrifying you.

98
00:06:16,580 --> 00:06:18,470
You wouldn't feel anything at all.

99
00:06:20,060 --> 00:06:23,110
You want to step on the wire.
I don't know if I'll be able to take

100
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:25,713
to do.

101
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:28,800
The more resistance you feel towards the
project,

102
00:06:28,801 --> 00:06:31,470
the more fulfilled you will be when you
finish it.

103
00:06:31,530 --> 00:06:34,530
Resistance always points us to our true
north,

104
00:06:35,070 --> 00:06:39,570
so how do we consistently beat
resistance as Steven Pressfield,

105
00:06:39,571 --> 00:06:43,560
ses by turning pro as he describes
tuning pro,

106
00:06:43,561 --> 00:06:48,450
it has nothing to do with making or nuts
making money out of your creative work.

107
00:06:48,780 --> 00:06:52,830
It isn't perfect.
If philosophy of work in ideology of

108
00:06:52,860 --> 00:06:56,190
ethics on how you conduct your creative
projects,

109
00:06:56,760 --> 00:07:00,060
you can turn professional one day and
being immature again.

110
00:07:00,061 --> 00:07:00,894
The next

111
00:07:02,380 --> 00:07:05,050
in short,
I was back.

112
00:07:07,870 --> 00:07:08,950
Yes,
yes,

113
00:07:08,951 --> 00:07:12,520
there is something I want to ask you.
How the fuck do you write?

114
00:07:12,521 --> 00:07:17,521
So many books so fast
I think.

115
00:07:20,780 --> 00:07:23,780
Oh,
I've had a really good six months.

116
00:07:23,781 --> 00:07:27,800
I've written three chapters that you've
got three books in that time.

117
00:07:28,050 --> 00:07:30,510
The way that.
The way that I work,

118
00:07:31,130 --> 00:07:34,590
I try to get out there and I try to get
six pages a day,

119
00:07:34,860 --> 00:07:39,420
so with a book like end of watch and I
work when I'm working,

120
00:07:39,421 --> 00:07:41,780
I work every day,
three,

121
00:07:41,810 --> 00:07:46,170
four hours and I try to get those six
pages and I try to get them fairly clean

122
00:07:46,260 --> 00:07:49,080
and you do hit six pages a day.
I usually do.

123
00:07:49,340 --> 00:07:54,340
Now death is an example of a pro as
pressfield states to professional knows

124
00:07:54,621 --> 00:07:59,120
that the mundane physical act of sitting
down and starting to work sets in

125
00:07:59,121 --> 00:08:02,360
motion,
a mysterious process that produces

126
00:08:02,361 --> 00:08:06,260
inspiration.
The immature waits for inspiration.

127
00:08:06,290 --> 00:08:09,110
The professional knows that it will come
off to you.

128
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:11,180
Starts now,
as you see,

129
00:08:11,210 --> 00:08:13,700
turning pro has little to do with
talens.

130
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:18,650
George Rr Martin is one of the most
gifted authors of generation bits.

131
00:08:18,651 --> 00:08:22,900
He hasn't turned pro,
which is why I am still waiting for a

132
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:26,270
next book.
The professional therefore x in the face

133
00:08:26,271 --> 00:08:29,870
of fear when the amateur fierce,
a big creative endeavor.

134
00:08:29,871 --> 00:08:33,920
He waits for the fear to disappear.
The professional knows this will never

135
00:08:33,921 --> 00:08:38,390
happen and starts anyway,
and immature dreams of stardom and

136
00:08:38,420 --> 00:08:41,030
glory.
The professional has no use for this.

137
00:08:41,090 --> 00:08:44,660
He knows that success is merely a
byproduct of work.

138
00:08:44,870 --> 00:08:49,140
He does the work and let's do rewards
come or not come as they may.

139
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:53,370
By doing this pro four,
it's disappointment and Nia offer

140
00:08:53,390 --> 00:08:56,340
assistance that it will use to make us
give up.

141
00:08:56,810 --> 00:09:00,420
Are you now or have you ever been a
member of the Communist Party?

142
00:09:00,740 --> 00:09:04,760
May I introduce to evidence you are out
of order my work?

143
00:09:04,830 --> 00:09:05,250
No,
no,

144
00:09:05,250 --> 00:09:05,731
no,
no,

145
00:09:05,731 --> 00:09:06,261
no,
no.

146
00:09:06,261 --> 00:09:06,921
I will.
No.

147
00:09:06,921 --> 00:09:11,750
I'm making this determination.
The chair will rule critical just a

148
00:09:11,750 --> 00:09:13,370
minute.
Your screenplays for too long.

149
00:09:13,820 --> 00:09:16,280
I've heard that before.
The professional

150
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:20,330
also place it as it lays.
He doesn't find excuses in bed.

151
00:09:20,331 --> 00:09:23,300
Luck at food,
city or injustice needed us.

152
00:09:23,301 --> 00:09:27,260
He led a windfall or good luck for him
into thinking he is there already.

153
00:09:28,300 --> 00:09:32,260
I'll write you a movie for $1,200 and
you don't want your name on it.

154
00:09:32,970 --> 00:09:34,470
No,
you don't want my name.

155
00:09:35,370 --> 00:09:38,970
He accepts the situation as it is the
pro marching song.

156
00:09:39,180 --> 00:09:42,630
No matter what the professional,
let's go his ego.

157
00:09:42,750 --> 00:09:45,570
He doesn't take failure or success
personally.

158
00:09:46,140 --> 00:09:49,800
Fear of rejection is human and lies deep
in everyone.

159
00:09:50,070 --> 00:09:53,690
Resistance,
no stis and uses it to paralyze us and

160
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:58,400
prevent us from doing our work.
Prestfield states that this is one of

161
00:09:58,401 --> 00:10:03,170
the hardest aspects of turning pro.
The professional puts his heart and soul

162
00:10:03,171 --> 00:10:06,280
into his work.
Then he steps back and assesses the.

163
00:10:06,300 --> 00:10:10,220
It's hardly at courtly.
He takes notes where he can do better.

164
00:10:10,221 --> 00:10:14,000
His next project,
and then he moves on the professional.

165
00:10:14,001 --> 00:10:17,420
This accepts criticism,
but it's never takes it personally.

166
00:10:17,660 --> 00:10:20,810
He knows resistance will use rejection
to break him.

167
00:10:21,050 --> 00:10:23,660
Therefore,
the professional and jurors adversity

168
00:10:24,140 --> 00:10:28,490
when he's faced down in arena chewing on
sand and everyone's laughing at him,

169
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:32,940
he knows it is still better to be in the
arena than standing on the sideline.

170
00:10:34,050 --> 00:10:36,780
Lastly,
where the amateur might make romantic

171
00:10:36,781 --> 00:10:41,781
claims about doing it for the love about
not caring or being even proud of not

172
00:10:41,941 --> 00:10:45,360
making money.
The professional recognizes that too

173
00:10:45,361 --> 00:10:46,740
much love,
we'll freeze him.

174
00:10:47,220 --> 00:10:51,960
Playing for money is to device he uses
to adopt a working men modality.

175
00:10:52,230 --> 00:10:55,020
As pressfield states the muse of
inspiration,

176
00:10:55,021 --> 00:10:59,510
loss of blue collar work ethic.
She lost a working stiff and hates prima

177
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:02,490
donnas.
The pro takes money to turn his life

178
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:05,450
into his job,
technically place bay,

179
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:07,980
but in the end he does it for the love
of the game.

180
00:11:11,030 --> 00:11:12,980
At this point,
you might be thinking,

181
00:11:12,981 --> 00:11:15,770
well,
the cold and heartless way to look at

182
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:18,590
creative work.
Where's the romance?

183
00:11:18,620 --> 00:11:22,910
Where stem mythology to beauty and
mystery of ours.

184
00:11:23,420 --> 00:11:28,310
These are things that we aim for when we
turn pro because we know when we beat

185
00:11:28,311 --> 00:11:33,311
resistance and sit down to do our work,
something magical happens when we sit

186
00:11:33,890 --> 00:11:37,010
down and grind it out.
Inspiration strikes,

187
00:11:37,220 --> 00:11:41,960
it starts to flow effortlessly.
Color the flow states call it being in

188
00:11:41,961 --> 00:11:46,961
the zone or espresso fueled does call it
abuse where resistance recites and hell

189
00:11:48,530 --> 00:11:53,530
creation has a seat in heaven.
Here the Mucus looks down and my issue

190
00:11:53,610 --> 00:11:57,940
grades your professionalism.
When you present yourself to her with an

191
00:11:57,941 --> 00:12:00,160
attitude of legalist,
snus and surface,

192
00:12:00,161 --> 00:12:02,530
she will come down and sit on your
shoulder,

193
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:05,470
a powerful ally to help you in your
endeavor.

194
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:10,680
When we beat resistance and starts,
the Muse will guide us battling the dark

195
00:12:10,691 --> 00:12:14,380
force of resistance beside us till we
finish our project.

196
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:17,890
It is only at this moment when you type
that last word,

197
00:12:17,950 --> 00:12:20,950
when you played that last note,
when you danced,

198
00:12:20,970 --> 00:12:25,030
that last step that you can look
resistance in the eye and say,

199
00:12:25,100 --> 00:12:29,200
rest in peace motherfucker.
After which she will start a new project

200
00:12:29,201 --> 00:12:34,201
and the battle starts a new
thanks for watching everyone in the day

201
00:12:39,151 --> 00:12:41,310
or two.
I will drop an extra video for our

202
00:12:41,311 --> 00:12:45,140
patrons where I will talk about other
aspects of turning pro.
