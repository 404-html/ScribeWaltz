1
00:00:17,900 --> 00:00:22,900
The opening scene of classic,
the Terminator immediately aligns its

2
00:00:22,941 --> 00:00:27,030
audience with the films may feet men
versus machine.

3
00:00:27,830 --> 00:00:31,160
This fee,
rum stroud's entire movie as calories

4
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:35,480
and a German etr or sent back in time to
duke it out over Sour O'connor's life.

5
00:00:35,810 --> 00:00:38,690
Both men and machine are fighting for
their very existence.

6
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:40,820
One is trying to killed a mater of
mankind,

7
00:00:40,821 --> 00:00:43,610
savior walls.
[inaudible] seeks to protect her from

8
00:00:43,611 --> 00:00:45,490
harm.
The Co finance roof,

9
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:50,500
the film Arriann pictures known for
classics such as Amadeus and two

10
00:00:53,630 --> 00:00:57,980
didn't think very highly of the story
and reportedly only perceived the film

11
00:00:58,100 --> 00:01:00,650
as a low budget vehicle to make some
quick money.

12
00:01:01,250 --> 00:01:04,580
Even James Cameron wasn't old at certain
off the potential of the film

13
00:01:05,100 --> 00:01:06,840
Terminator One was,
was uh,

14
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:09,450
like a hallucination for me.
I was making my first,

15
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:11,910
my first picture.
I had no idea it was really going to be

16
00:01:11,911 --> 00:01:12,960
a success.
I mean,

17
00:01:12,961 --> 00:01:14,370
when I,
when I wrote it,

18
00:01:14,371 --> 00:01:17,490
I probably thought it has stood the
chance of being a success.

19
00:01:17,550 --> 00:01:19,140
I wrote it that way on purpose,
you know,

20
00:01:19,141 --> 00:01:22,950
but you never really believed that,
that it's going to happen or that it can

21
00:01:22,951 --> 00:01:23,450
happen.

22
00:01:23,450 --> 00:01:26,670
Arielle and picture saw in the
terminator is straight forward action

23
00:01:27,470 --> 00:01:32,470
but field to see what lay hidden beneath
all the onscreen violence or as the

24
00:01:32,901 --> 00:01:34,520
terminator himself explains it.

25
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:39,960
I always felt that this,
this was more than the ordinary action

26
00:01:40,001 --> 00:01:45,001
film and it was more than a special
effects from and uh,

27
00:01:45,730 --> 00:01:48,940
or like with some thought was just a b
movie.

28
00:01:49,810 --> 00:01:52,660
In fact,
I think the story is so solid and so

29
00:01:52,661 --> 00:01:55,840
good and it has so many interesting
messages there and it is also

30
00:01:55,841 --> 00:01:58,480
entertaining and so they will have a
broad appeal

31
00:01:59,670 --> 00:02:01,410
because when we look past the surface
level,

32
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:04,680
another more encompassing theme revealed
itself,

33
00:02:05,220 --> 00:02:09,690
religion versus technology,
the human spirit versus the program

34
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:14,720
mine.
Cause as the story moves into La of

35
00:02:33,151 --> 00:02:36,090
1984,
you might expect to see it widely

36
00:02:36,091 --> 00:02:39,990
contracting world from the post nuclear
wasteland from the star of the movie.

37
00:02:40,590 --> 00:02:42,960
However,
director James Cameron decided to make

38
00:02:42,990 --> 00:02:47,220
la of the ADC gritty,
gray and arguably hostile place.

39
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:52,700
Fuck you asshole.
Of course

40
00:03:00,130 --> 00:03:04,840
human guy and is still very much alive
and in control button is already

41
00:03:04,841 --> 00:03:06,970
becoming apparent that the world is in
decline.

42
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:11,270
New Technologies such as widespread use
of color tvs,

43
00:03:11,620 --> 00:03:13,900
board will,
cassette players and techno music.

44
00:03:13,901 --> 00:03:18,880
I've invaded both the private as well as
the public space as people seem to be in

45
00:03:18,881 --> 00:03:22,150
the kind of trends oblivious to the
world around them.

46
00:03:23,540 --> 00:03:26,350
An example is ginger's obsession with
her music player.

47
00:03:27,070 --> 00:03:29,440
She's dancing around the house,
stuck in her own world.

48
00:03:30,250 --> 00:03:32,110
First she doesn't hear the ring of her
phone,

49
00:03:34,330 --> 00:03:36,370
then she doesn't hear Sarah calling her
name,

50
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:40,630
gender,
it's matte and the first time,

51
00:03:40,990 --> 00:03:41,823
well,

52
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:53,780
another example is the club scene.
Where do people dancing are completely

53
00:03:53,781 --> 00:03:57,830
oblivious to the and Fred and even in to
the existence of our three main

54
00:03:57,831 --> 00:04:01,910
characters in general.
No one even as much as glances at the

55
00:04:01,911 --> 00:04:05,930
massive terminator as he handed it to
club and even security is slow to react.

56
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:18,760
The people of La are not only oblivious,
they're also seen to be egotistical and

57
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:22,430
apathetic.
The police officers don't seem to care

58
00:04:22,431 --> 00:04:26,210
about an act of serial killer
systematically terminating all the sour

59
00:04:26,211 --> 00:04:29,450
conners in town.
Are sure there's a point to all of this.

60
00:04:29,900 --> 00:04:32,990
It is only when confronted with
potential bad press did they decide to

61
00:04:32,991 --> 00:04:36,160
take action hitting me.
The press is going to be short stroking

62
00:04:36,170 --> 00:04:37,550
and all over the place.
Oh,

63
00:04:37,580 --> 00:04:41,270
one day pattern together.
I hate the weird ones.

64
00:04:41,690 --> 00:04:45,020
Even the people whose job it is to
listen to you and help out or is it only

65
00:04:45,021 --> 00:04:49,340
seems to care about themselves choice.
The psychiatrist tasked with analyzing

66
00:04:49,341 --> 00:04:51,910
Carl Sanity isn't really listening to
him.

67
00:04:51,940 --> 00:04:53,720
Yeah,
but it's actually just thinking of how a

68
00:04:53,721 --> 00:04:57,140
story could elevate his own career
surrounded by living tissue.

69
00:04:57,200 --> 00:05:00,320
How right.
This is great stuff.

70
00:05:00,321 --> 00:05:04,340
I could make a career out of this guy
and later on when the terminators run

71
00:05:04,341 --> 00:05:07,640
over by a truck,
you might expect the driver to call for

72
00:05:07,641 --> 00:05:09,290
help,
but alas,

73
00:05:09,620 --> 00:05:13,800
that's good addict.
Good.

74
00:05:15,730 --> 00:05:19,480
Someone Murray's says that has become
very hard to spot a Cyborg.

75
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:22,390
It is not only because they look like
us,

76
00:05:23,020 --> 00:05:25,830
but mainly because when we lose our own
humanness,

77
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:31,320
we are starting to act like den.
Fuck you,

78
00:05:32,841 --> 00:05:37,841
ass whore Sarah and you only ones who
exhibit the traits that human kind and

79
00:05:37,851 --> 00:05:42,230
terminators seems to have lost.
They show compassion to each other and

80
00:05:42,231 --> 00:05:45,200
animals alike.
I came across time for you,

81
00:05:45,201 --> 00:05:46,034
sir.

82
00:05:47,460 --> 00:05:51,480
Have you
always have me

83
00:05:55,410 --> 00:05:58,490
disgusting?
Sarah's almost naive innocence stands in

84
00:05:58,491 --> 00:06:01,010
stark contrast to the world and the
people around her,

85
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:04,880
her worth to the world,
dramatically shifts from a clumsy

86
00:06:04,881 --> 00:06:07,700
waitress to the mater of mankind.
Savior.

87
00:06:08,390 --> 00:06:12,200
You could even argue that Sarah Connor
is an essence,

88
00:06:12,380 --> 00:06:15,920
the biblical Maria,
her innocence and humanities Cetera,

89
00:06:15,940 --> 00:06:20,900
apart from our fellow human beings,
her friend Ginger even acknowledges her

90
00:06:20,901 --> 00:06:25,901
divine worth better than mortal man
deserves and ironically she gets

91
00:06:25,911 --> 00:06:30,260
impregnated by somewhat immortal
character because even though rees dies

92
00:06:30,261 --> 00:06:33,440
in the end,
the paradoxical loop has been created

93
00:06:33,441 --> 00:06:37,040
and we'll make sure that this event will
keep repeating itself forever.

94
00:06:37,580 --> 00:06:39,710
God,
a person could go crazy thinking about

95
00:06:39,711 --> 00:06:40,880
this.
Ultimately,

96
00:06:40,881 --> 00:06:45,881
she will give birth to John Connor or
Jesus Christ who will bring salvation to

97
00:06:46,911 --> 00:06:50,210
mankind,
who will wake us up right before our own

98
00:06:50,270 --> 00:06:54,290
extinction.
Robert McKee calls this grove symbolic

99
00:06:54,291 --> 00:06:57,440
progression.
We start a story with actions,

100
00:06:57,441 --> 00:06:58,880
locations,
and roles.

101
00:06:59,060 --> 00:07:03,860
The represent only themselves,
but a truly great film lists to tell him

102
00:07:03,861 --> 00:07:07,970
to the next level.
Exposivity from the particular to the

103
00:07:07,971 --> 00:07:11,240
universal,
from the specific to the archival

104
00:07:11,990 --> 00:07:16,030
besides the story of Jesus Christ and
the key fines and the terminator echoes

105
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:20,630
the ancient archetype of the maze.
The mythological battle between

106
00:07:20,670 --> 00:07:24,740
[inaudible] and the minutes are,
and indeed most of the action of the

107
00:07:24,741 --> 00:07:27,770
film takes place in corridors,
hallways,

108
00:07:28,340 --> 00:07:32,600
alleyways and the like.
The freedom of space in the terminator

109
00:07:32,601 --> 00:07:35,690
is limited.
Even the chase scene on the highway,

110
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:39,530
it takes place in a tunnel.
It closed off environment source.

111
00:07:40,100 --> 00:07:44,540
So James Cameron shows us stories that
have been taught throughout the ages to

112
00:07:44,541 --> 00:07:46,640
confront us with fears of what lies
ahead.

113
00:07:46,970 --> 00:07:49,550
Determinator franchise has survived up
until now,

114
00:07:49,700 --> 00:07:53,660
and this might partly be because it's
subject is now more relevant than ever.

115
00:07:54,470 --> 00:07:56,720
The majority of the world owns a
smartphone.

116
00:07:57,110 --> 00:08:01,220
Technology literally surrounds us and
changes our perception of the world.

117
00:08:01,670 --> 00:08:05,420
Hopes and fears of the future.
Invention of ai have entered the public

118
00:08:05,421 --> 00:08:09,260
arena.
James Cameron for saw a dark future for

119
00:08:09,261 --> 00:08:13,250
humanity with the terminator,
but also provided us with hope of

120
00:08:13,251 --> 00:08:16,760
changing the outcome.
Silver dust ultimately defeat

121
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:20,000
determinator by working together with
the machines of her own time.

122
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:23,910
Yet the front of Doomsday remains.
There's a storm coming.

123
00:08:28,980 --> 00:08:29,813
I know.

124
00:08:30,570 --> 00:08:34,470
So next time when you don't understand
why a certain film has done so well,

125
00:08:35,010 --> 00:08:38,370
look at the progression.
Look at the archetypes,

126
00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:43,110
because every great new story is often
the product of an old one.

127
00:08:43,230 --> 00:08:46,790
I tell you,
I owe him that.

128
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:54,920
Maybe it'll help if he,
you know that in a few hours that we had

129
00:08:56,431 --> 00:09:01,431
together,
we left a lifetime's worth my,

130
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:03,480
wait,
there's a bench over there.

131
00:09:15,460 --> 00:09:16,510
I'll be back.
