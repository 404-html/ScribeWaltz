1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:03,570
But I'll give you one quick example,
I say,

2
00:00:03,571 --> 00:00:05,760
and it's fairly standard because I
believe it strongly,

3
00:00:06,420 --> 00:00:10,170
the American dream is dead,
but I'm going to make it bigger and

4
00:00:10,171 --> 00:00:11,310
stronger and better.

5
00:00:13,420 --> 00:00:18,310
I think it's safe to say that social
tensions within Western society have

6
00:00:18,311 --> 00:00:22,780
risen dramatically since the century.
How do you elicit concepts like

7
00:00:22,781 --> 00:00:26,560
multiculturalism and the American dream
has come under increasing amounts of

8
00:00:26,561 --> 00:00:30,250
scrutiny from all sides of the political
spectrum and the Mitsui growing

9
00:00:30,251 --> 00:00:33,010
suspicion,
discontent over matters like government,

10
00:00:33,130 --> 00:00:34,600
race,
ethnicity,

11
00:00:34,630 --> 00:00:36,070
gender,
and religion.

12
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:39,670
There's the realization that we've
become so self aware that we've become

13
00:00:39,700 --> 00:00:44,350
too scared to even have an honest debate
about these very subjects that have

14
00:00:44,351 --> 00:00:48,880
since become taboo.
And in order to evaluate our relations,

15
00:00:48,881 --> 00:00:53,350
you concept like the American dream,
we might just have to look in one of the

16
00:00:53,351 --> 00:00:55,480
most unexpected of places,

17
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:00,140
la,
la,

18
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:01,313
la,
la,

19
00:01:01,700 --> 00:01:02,150
la,
la,

20
00:01:02,150 --> 00:01:02,983
la,
la.

21
00:01:06,740 --> 00:01:09,740
Now you don't have to be an analytical
genius to understand.

22
00:01:09,741 --> 00:01:12,750
And Harold and Kumar,
it's about far more than the struggle to

23
00:01:12,751 --> 00:01:15,390
young potheads the perfect fast food

24
00:01:15,710 --> 00:01:18,840
this night,
the American dream.

25
00:01:19,690 --> 00:01:21,670
So let's talk about the American dream
for a second,

26
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:25,110
generally defined as the ideals of
freedom and equality for all American

27
00:01:25,111 --> 00:01:27,010
citizens,
but maybe most importantly,

28
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:29,290
it's the guarantee that within this
landscape,

29
00:01:29,380 --> 00:01:33,310
every individual has the opportunity to
achieve success in whatever it is they

30
00:01:33,311 --> 00:01:35,020
might pursue.
On a surface level,

31
00:01:35,021 --> 00:01:38,080
it seems that the movie aligns itself,
Isi Culture,

32
00:01:38,380 --> 00:01:41,620
as the story's about two members of
minority groups trying to seeing the

33
00:01:41,621 --> 00:01:45,280
fruits of that concept that should be
readily available to every American by

34
00:01:45,281 --> 00:01:46,270
default.
However,

35
00:01:46,271 --> 00:01:49,090
we only have to examine the two main
protagonists who discovered it.

36
00:01:49,091 --> 00:01:54,091
This observation is in fact false.
Both Harold and Kumar seemed to embody

37
00:01:54,281 --> 00:01:58,420
the group in the stereotypical Asian
American and Indian American.

38
00:01:58,660 --> 00:02:01,750
Harold is shown to be hardworking,
anxiety,

39
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:04,060
non provoking,
and shy.

40
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:09,750
Waterfalls and studer group identity of
the smart,

41
00:02:09,751 --> 00:02:12,720
well educated Indian American.
With the talent for the medical

42
00:02:12,721 --> 00:02:15,510
professions,
it quickly becomes clear ever.

43
00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:18,390
There's more to the east characters and
just their stereotypes.

44
00:02:18,700 --> 00:02:20,580
I can't party tonight.
Okay,

45
00:02:20,581 --> 00:02:22,230
I going to stay late at the office.
Dude.

46
00:02:22,231 --> 00:02:24,300
Fuck that shit.
We had friends I know,

47
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:27,510
but I got a lot of work to do.
When is getting high ever prevented you

48
00:02:27,511 --> 00:02:32,511
from doing your work
held in whom are actually shown Zvi

49
00:02:33,291 --> 00:02:36,040
route or a stereotypical as they smoke
weed,

50
00:02:36,510 --> 00:02:40,120
pursue sexual desires and make quads I
racist jokes through their friends.

51
00:02:40,250 --> 00:02:44,640
You you'd use think about tits homes is
there also seemed to be highly conscious

52
00:02:44,641 --> 00:02:46,720
of their struggle with their proposed
group identity.

53
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:49,890
Kumar has no interest in as far as the
man that he becomes.

54
00:02:49,891 --> 00:02:54,740
A dark room is dirty and filled to the
brim with posters or black rep artists

55
00:02:54,750 --> 00:02:58,760
and attempt to appropriate black culture
in favor of his own federal,

56
00:02:58,820 --> 00:03:02,100
on other hand,
still actively Ozon to a large part of

57
00:03:02,101 --> 00:03:06,160
his group and you showed you more
hesitant and Kumar to break away from

58
00:03:06,161 --> 00:03:10,080
his character traits cleared at both
harold and Kumar have a desire to be

59
00:03:10,140 --> 00:03:14,260
someone else to be their own versus at
the beginning of the movie,

60
00:03:14,261 --> 00:03:17,800
both characters are essentially stuck in
their struggle to find your own

61
00:03:17,801 --> 00:03:20,580
identities in relation to their proposed
group.

62
00:03:21,030 --> 00:03:24,730
They're both stereotypical as well as a
stereotypical.

63
00:03:24,780 --> 00:03:25,071
No,
no,

64
00:03:25,071 --> 00:03:25,301
no,
no,

65
00:03:25,301 --> 00:03:25,541
no,
no.

66
00:03:25,541 --> 00:03:30,541
I don't like breaking the law,
makes very clear that is not doing a way

67
00:03:30,970 --> 00:03:35,970
with ethical stereotypes what is ratter
and quite literally poking holes in

68
00:03:36,641 --> 00:03:40,220
them,
in fact,

69
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:44,920
poking holes into stereotypes but not
doing away with them completely becomes

70
00:03:44,921 --> 00:03:47,440
one of the main themes of the movie.
They have a Gelato,

71
00:03:47,460 --> 00:03:49,810
evangelicals,
this multiethnic comedy,

72
00:03:50,140 --> 00:03:53,230
because a story allows the main
characters to interact with people from

73
00:03:53,231 --> 00:03:56,040
a variety of ethnic groups.
Instead of focusing on a group,

74
00:03:56,050 --> 00:03:58,960
the main characters themselves during
these interactions,

75
00:03:58,961 --> 00:04:02,830
Harold and discovered that they choose
are guilty of stereotyping potters

76
00:04:02,980 --> 00:04:07,030
because every person they need one of
their quote unquote reality bubbles pop.

77
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:09,320
First off,
Harold was hesitant to spend time with

78
00:04:09,321 --> 00:04:12,880
the East Asian Club at Stanford as it
seemed to embody to fool stereotypical

79
00:04:12,881 --> 00:04:14,910
group identity of Asian Americans,
humanity,

80
00:04:14,950 --> 00:04:18,610
just to avoid having to go to party only
to find out that there are parties are

81
00:04:18,611 --> 00:04:19,630
absolutely crazy.

82
00:04:25,190 --> 00:04:26,230
Stick it hit you,

83
00:04:27,970 --> 00:04:30,570
Tamara meats too.
Posh British girls who want to meet up

84
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:33,390
for a night of fun and it turned to
prevent is harold and Kumar.

85
00:04:33,391 --> 00:04:37,350
Ended up in the girl's bathroom and find
out just how class you'd these ladies

86
00:04:37,410 --> 00:04:38,243
are

87
00:04:41,980 --> 00:04:46,950
later on if it was shown to be an overly
stereotypical Jesus loving redneck Kumar

88
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:50,230
clearly uncomfortable around him and so
he tells them that are allowed to have

89
00:04:50,231 --> 00:04:55,231
sex with his wife.
Lastly,

90
00:04:57,670 --> 00:05:01,150
when Harold ends up in police custody
after having punched a police officer,

91
00:05:01,390 --> 00:05:04,030
he needs a black American man,
but this time is different.

92
00:05:04,031 --> 00:05:06,720
Demand doesn't look like the
stereotypical like plug.

93
00:05:07,060 --> 00:05:10,630
It seems to be quite the opposite.
As he's reading a compilation of essays

94
00:05:10,631 --> 00:05:14,200
called civil disobedience.
He explained to commodity has been

95
00:05:14,201 --> 00:05:16,930
arrested unfairly.
Then ads that he doesn't get too worked

96
00:05:16,931 --> 00:05:17,764
up about it

97
00:05:18,620 --> 00:05:22,660
in the end,
universe tends done as it should

98
00:05:24,330 --> 00:05:26,440
have a really large penis that keeps me
happy.

99
00:05:27,850 --> 00:05:31,480
Not the first line is arguably the most
important line of the entire movie,

100
00:05:31,730 --> 00:05:35,260
and I'll get back to that in a second,
but the second line obviously reinforces

101
00:05:35,261 --> 00:05:39,970
a stereotype of black men and their son.
David Jolanta explains this recurring

102
00:05:40,030 --> 00:05:42,970
theme and at the movie Los,
every guy to identify themselves in

103
00:05:42,971 --> 00:05:46,390
relation to the stereotypes about your
ethical group is not to say that all the

104
00:05:46,391 --> 00:05:49,720
minority characters in our Kumar,
Sharon's been victims of his legacy.

105
00:05:50,110 --> 00:05:52,960
On the contrary,
even the one person who can legitimately

106
00:05:52,961 --> 00:05:56,500
be seen as a victim refuses to see
himself as such.

107
00:05:56,710 --> 00:05:57,471
In.
Besides that,

108
00:05:57,471 --> 00:06:00,250
most of the auto minority characters
don't seem to take their ethnical

109
00:06:00,270 --> 00:06:03,950
identities very seriously and even
actively engaged in self ridiculed.

110
00:06:04,230 --> 00:06:05,970
You know the Holocaust?
Yeah,

111
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:07,980
picture the exact opposite of that.

112
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:14,060
There still definitely an argument to be
made how Harold and Kumar are being held

113
00:06:14,061 --> 00:06:17,180
back by external forces who seem to be
predominantly white.

114
00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:20,570
It's no coincidence that the castle to
the American dream is called white

115
00:06:20,571 --> 00:06:23,030
guests,
but as we've seen how leukemia is not

116
00:06:23,031 --> 00:06:25,970
about complete generalizations and
victimization,

117
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:27,950
and this seems to be the last bubble to
pop.

118
00:06:28,030 --> 00:06:28,863
We're two friends,

119
00:06:40,870 --> 00:06:45,610
extreme sports bullies and racist cops
are ultimately arrested by police

120
00:06:45,611 --> 00:06:48,200
officers.
Even Neil Patrick Harris redeems himself

121
00:06:48,220 --> 00:06:51,040
by being for Hilton Kumar's food as
they're stealing their car.

122
00:06:51,220 --> 00:06:53,710
So it seems to intellectual black guy
was right,

123
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:54,850
the universe,
Dustin,

124
00:06:54,851 --> 00:06:59,080
to shoot in the end,
how whom I reached their American dream,

125
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:03,430
harold finally rebels against his own
conformity with social conditioning as

126
00:07:03,431 --> 00:07:06,310
he stands up to his coworkers and
ultimately gets the girl.

127
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:07,570
Kumar,
on the other hand,

128
00:07:07,571 --> 00:07:11,410
is now more accepted of his ability to
potentially become a great surgeon and

129
00:07:11,411 --> 00:07:15,670
decides that it's time to let go of
resisting the Spartan you make do with

130
00:07:15,671 --> 00:07:17,980
what you have.
Seems to be the central message here.

131
00:07:18,310 --> 00:07:19,960
Yes,
there will always be people who are

132
00:07:19,961 --> 00:07:21,400
living a little easier.
Yes,

133
00:07:21,401 --> 00:07:23,680
there were always real assholes and
bigots.

134
00:07:24,070 --> 00:07:26,920
There will always be individuals trying
to hold you back,

135
00:07:27,250 --> 00:07:30,580
but it's up to you whether you let that
affect you in whether you can allow

136
00:07:30,581 --> 00:07:33,400
yourself to not take everything so
seriously.

137
00:07:36,070 --> 00:07:39,130
It's our own convictions and our
perception of the world that can hold us

138
00:07:39,131 --> 00:07:42,130
back the most.
That's why Harold and Kumar is about the

139
00:07:42,131 --> 00:07:45,190
American dream.
It's about reevaluating yourself within

140
00:07:45,191 --> 00:07:48,080
the spectrum of group identity and
individuality to them,

141
00:07:48,090 --> 00:07:53,090
proactively work your way towards that
dream to let go of victim and to find

142
00:07:53,231 --> 00:07:55,000
the courage to teach or lead.

143
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:55,953
Oh,
great.

144
00:08:02,810 --> 00:08:04,370
Hey guys,
thanks for watching.

145
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:07,190
If you liked this video and don't mind
telling your friends about it,

146
00:08:07,220 --> 00:08:10,260
please do not hesitate to share it and
give your thoughts on it in the comment

147
00:08:10,261 --> 00:08:13,120
section below.
Next video will be our 24 and the Bourne

148
00:08:13,130 --> 00:08:15,740
ultimatum analysis.
We had some technical issues with that

149
00:08:15,741 --> 00:08:18,680
one,
but it will come out somewhere in the

150
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:19,431
beginning of next week.
See you guys.

151
00:08:19,431 --> 00:08:19,700
Then.
