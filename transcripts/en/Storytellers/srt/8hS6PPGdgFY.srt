1
00:00:01,360 --> 00:00:05,160
And she's carrying something.
It's not uncommon for a film to reveal

2
00:00:05,161 --> 00:00:08,250
its main theme and the opening scene of
its story and Esu.

3
00:00:08,310 --> 00:00:11,340
Grab the audience's attention and give
them a taste of what's to come,

4
00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:15,000
not unlike to ferry essay that I'm
reading to you right now or really any

5
00:00:15,001 --> 00:00:17,820
other medium to tries to effectively
convey a message.

6
00:00:18,210 --> 00:00:21,370
American sniper,
as you can see here is no exception to

7
00:00:21,371 --> 00:00:24,750
this navy seal.
Chris Kyle is laying on a rooftop in war

8
00:00:24,751 --> 00:00:28,380
torn Fallujah.
His rifle aimed at a mother and her son

9
00:00:28,740 --> 00:00:31,110
away for Clint Eastwood to point us to
his films,

10
00:00:31,111 --> 00:00:35,610
main theme family or rather the tragic
destruction of family through war.

11
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,310
However,
it seems that this message didn't really

12
00:00:38,311 --> 00:00:41,100
get you on to a number of high profile
audiences.

13
00:00:42,260 --> 00:00:44,630
Most notable or tweets from the likes of
Seth Rogan,

14
00:00:44,631 --> 00:00:48,770
who compared to films who to throw Nazi
propaganda movie shown and the third act

15
00:00:48,771 --> 00:00:49,910
of inglorious bastards.

16
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:53,060
Then there is Michael Moore staying at
all snipers are cowards.

17
00:00:53,420 --> 00:00:57,590
No on Chomsky weighing in on what he
states is a testament of support of

18
00:00:57,591 --> 00:01:00,320
everything that's wrong with American
foreign policy.

19
00:01:00,740 --> 00:01:05,510
Documentary director Robert Greenwald,
doing roughly the same thing on MSNBC

20
00:01:05,511 --> 00:01:09,830
and finally former presidential
candidate Howard Dean speaking his mind

21
00:01:09,831 --> 00:01:14,030
on real time with Bill Maher.
I bet you if you looked at a cross

22
00:01:14,031 --> 00:01:16,220
section of the tea party and people
would go to see this movie,

23
00:01:16,221 --> 00:01:19,010
there's a lot of intersection I could go
on for a while,

24
00:01:19,011 --> 00:01:22,520
but I think you get the point.
A lot of high profile partisan liberal

25
00:01:22,521 --> 00:01:26,690
viewers did not enjoy what they
interpreted to be blatantly pro war

26
00:01:26,691 --> 00:01:30,110
propaganda movie.
The movie made by a man whose personal

27
00:01:30,111 --> 00:01:33,830
politics already seems to run counter to
dos who stand against the film.

28
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:37,270
When somebody does not do the job,
we've got to let them go

29
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,100
and then he would have therefore
naturally and consciously made a movie

30
00:01:42,101 --> 00:01:46,480
that shows audiences each simplistic and
glorified version of the war were just

31
00:01:46,481 --> 00:01:47,500
odd to say the least.

32
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:51,370
This that would be completely out of
character for clinic sweet and director

33
00:01:51,371 --> 00:01:55,030
who has a record of making nuanced and
often openminded films.

34
00:01:55,330 --> 00:01:59,590
The glamorizing negritude is killing in
western movies addressing gender and

35
00:01:59,591 --> 00:02:03,790
class issues for women in sports.
You minimizing Japanese soldiers during

36
00:02:03,791 --> 00:02:06,820
the Second World War.
Tackling the corrupt criminal justice

37
00:02:06,821 --> 00:02:10,660
system of the early 20th century and
being criticized by some conservatives

38
00:02:10,661 --> 00:02:14,230
for gramitizing to homosexual private
life of FBI director,

39
00:02:14,231 --> 00:02:17,200
Edgar Hoover,
not you accurately point out the true

40
00:02:17,201 --> 00:02:20,680
message of American sniper.
We can make use of literary theorist

41
00:02:20,681 --> 00:02:25,120
Kenneth Burke's cluster analysis method,
which attempts to seek out the film's

42
00:02:25,121 --> 00:02:29,530
most important recurring terms with the
positive god term on the one hand and a

43
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:33,270
counter acting devil term on the other
in between floats,

44
00:02:33,271 --> 00:02:36,100
subordinate terms that align with either
of the main terms,

45
00:02:36,101 --> 00:02:38,800
but that can change their value as the
story progresses.

46
00:02:39,070 --> 00:02:42,400
But before we get into any of that,
let's start by taking a closer look at

47
00:02:42,401 --> 00:02:45,880
our gods term.
In order to truly understand the

48
00:02:45,881 --> 00:02:48,670
character of Chris Kyle and why he does
what he does,

49
00:02:48,700 --> 00:02:51,730
we first need to examine how his value
system works.

50
00:02:52,060 --> 00:02:54,610
Traveling back to is you.
If we can observe how is strict

51
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:58,210
upbringing in a highly conservative
household late the foundations for the

52
00:02:58,211 --> 00:03:00,940
man.
He would later from his father stoic

53
00:03:00,941 --> 00:03:04,630
sheepdog philosophy of protecting the
defense lists from all this evil in the

54
00:03:04,631 --> 00:03:07,090
world.
Two sermons about God's plan for his

55
00:03:07,091 --> 00:03:09,790
believers,
yet unknown path to glory.

56
00:03:10,180 --> 00:03:13,280
And lastly a lesson in perseverance.
Get back here.

57
00:03:16,690 --> 00:03:18,220
You don't ever leave your rifle in the
dirt.

58
00:03:19,450 --> 00:03:21,850
Yes sir.
All these teachings work for her to

59
00:03:21,851 --> 00:03:24,430
concept with family,
to protect it from danger,

60
00:03:24,490 --> 00:03:29,350
to believe in God's plan for his glory
and to never abandoned one's duty

61
00:03:29,351 --> 00:03:33,010
towards it.
It's this value system to cal carries

62
00:03:33,011 --> 00:03:36,680
with them into adulthood and that after
perhaps having laid dormant for some

63
00:03:36,681 --> 00:03:40,660
time miss reawakened by the terrorist
attacks on the American embassies,

64
00:03:42,340 --> 00:03:45,100
cows,
wards and emotional reaction indicating

65
00:03:45,101 --> 00:03:49,900
that his notion of family has extended
into the nation as family and attack on

66
00:03:49,901 --> 00:03:52,960
the nation is indirectly and attack on
his own family,

67
00:03:53,350 --> 00:03:57,550
which pushes him into joining the navy
seals who like many other military units

68
00:03:57,610 --> 00:04:00,850
actively try to form a tight knit group
of non quitters

69
00:04:01,380 --> 00:04:05,680
for the faint of heart there they wash
out the quit on my most men don't quit,

70
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:08,400
so Chris,
despite has apparent old age,

71
00:04:08,401 --> 00:04:11,610
stays faithful to his beliefs and
doesn't quit and this other newly

72
00:04:11,611 --> 00:04:14,670
perceived family.
Another instance where Chris's values

73
00:04:14,671 --> 00:04:18,330
influence events is when he manages to
grab the interest of his future wife

74
00:04:18,331 --> 00:04:22,140
Taya after he denounced as a fellow seal
for cheating and quitting on his

75
00:04:22,141 --> 00:04:24,670
marriage.
Kristen say a shared love for family.

76
00:04:24,671 --> 00:04:28,170
You make sure subsequent relationship
grow and things seem to be shaping up to

77
00:04:28,171 --> 00:04:32,340
cal's divine plan for awhile until one
fateful September morning,

78
00:04:32,650 --> 00:04:33,483
no

79
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:47,290
wars devil term that slowly starts to
take control over at Kyle's family

80
00:04:47,291 --> 00:04:49,530
values.
The first value that's bootsy that's

81
00:04:49,540 --> 00:04:52,120
asked is a sheepdog notion of protecting
family,

82
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:54,850
which as we've seen consists of three
layers.

83
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:58,780
His family at home is military family
and his country.

84
00:04:59,140 --> 00:05:02,650
As Cruz is deployed to Iraq,
we see him excelling in his role on the

85
00:05:02,651 --> 00:05:06,460
battlefield as an overwatch sniper,
keeping the evils of war from his

86
00:05:06,461 --> 00:05:09,220
military family,
as well as keeping it as far away as

87
00:05:09,221 --> 00:05:11,290
possible from his own direct family.

88
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:17,390
The call home was supposed to go,

89
00:05:18,220 --> 00:05:20,980
however,
he slowly finds out that it's impossible

90
00:05:20,981 --> 00:05:24,400
to do either of these things because
regardless of his extra tease as a

91
00:05:24,401 --> 00:05:26,830
sniper,
he's proven to be unable to protect

92
00:05:26,831 --> 00:05:30,940
every single marine under his watch.
And he also has to live with the fact

93
00:05:30,941 --> 00:05:34,490
that in order to protect his family,
he's forced to destroy another.

94
00:05:36,850 --> 00:05:39,700
And even though he does manage to
protect countless of troops from

95
00:05:39,701 --> 00:05:42,040
physical harm,
he can't shield them from the mental

96
00:05:42,041 --> 00:05:44,290
harm.
The war inevitably causes them as is

97
00:05:44,291 --> 00:05:47,740
exemplified when Chris runs into his
little brother who is about to return

98
00:05:47,741 --> 00:05:48,580
home from the war,

99
00:05:49,820 --> 00:05:50,653
just tired man

100
00:05:53,690 --> 00:05:57,740
cows building frustration over his
inability to protect everyone is when he

101
00:05:57,741 --> 00:06:01,370
witnesses to depths of an Iraqi family.
He vouched to protect after having

102
00:06:01,371 --> 00:06:04,810
extracted vital information from them
and thereby consciously having involved

103
00:06:04,811 --> 00:06:07,250
them into the war.
His first deployment ends those with the

104
00:06:07,251 --> 00:06:11,600
notion that war and protecting food war
inevitably makes collateral damage of

105
00:06:11,601 --> 00:06:14,270
family,
which we can see even more clearly is

106
00:06:14,271 --> 00:06:18,580
cal returns home with his feelings of
frustration and guilt gone on resolve

107
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:22,660
that quickly becomes clear that far from
having left the war behind Chris has

108
00:06:22,661 --> 00:06:26,870
brought it home in the form of mental
trauma is developing ptsd causes him to

109
00:06:26,871 --> 00:06:29,600
become increasingly disconnected from
his family life.

110
00:06:29,900 --> 00:06:33,230
Having become absent minded,
he constantly slips back to the evils of

111
00:06:33,231 --> 00:06:35,270
the war,
the death of the rocky family.

112
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:39,570
Perhaps the perfect metaphor for Chris's
inability to keep war and family

113
00:06:39,571 --> 00:06:43,610
separate is when he's watching American
troops getting shot by his rival sniper

114
00:06:43,850 --> 00:06:47,090
while sitting next to at Christmas tree,
the epitome of everything.

115
00:06:47,091 --> 00:06:48,860
Family,
God and peace,

116
00:06:49,340 --> 00:06:53,330
still unwilling to talk about the war.
Chrysalis does unwittingly destroying

117
00:06:53,331 --> 00:06:56,710
his own family.
His tie tries to tell him that Chris

118
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:59,180
talk about it.
You're not protecting me by not talking

119
00:06:59,181 --> 00:07:00,590
about,
but in Kyle's mind,

120
00:07:00,591 --> 00:07:03,800
protecting through wars,
the only way of protecting both his

121
00:07:03,801 --> 00:07:06,170
direct family as well as his other
families.

122
00:07:06,171 --> 00:07:06,720
Yeah,

123
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:10,510
not about them.
It's about us.

124
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:15,110
For Chris quitting the war would mean
quitting on the navy seals or his family

125
00:07:15,111 --> 00:07:17,780
in Iraq,
which is not something has value system

126
00:07:17,781 --> 00:07:22,580
allows him to do and it's why we see him
returning again and again and again.

127
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:26,930
This no quitting mentality is supported
by his confidence and finding glory in

128
00:07:26,931 --> 00:07:31,610
God's divine plan as he carries with him
Miss Old Bible wherever he goes and he

129
00:07:31,611 --> 00:07:34,140
continuously,
it's sure as tie that you to let him

130
00:07:34,141 --> 00:07:34,974
leave,
right.

131
00:07:35,010 --> 00:07:37,040
What do you,
it's all part of the plan for Chris.

132
00:07:37,041 --> 00:07:41,300
His bath to glory is in a self perceived
crusade against the forces of evil in

133
00:07:41,301 --> 00:07:43,940
Iraq,
which seems to be why he's sporting a

134
00:07:43,941 --> 00:07:47,180
crusader cross to to you,
and why he believes in the righteousness

135
00:07:47,181 --> 00:07:50,960
of the u s presence.
There we're singing God's blessing and

136
00:07:50,961 --> 00:07:54,410
Glory Dafur become associated with war,
it and family.

137
00:07:54,710 --> 00:07:56,040
However,
cal's never ending.

138
00:07:56,090 --> 00:08:00,650
Crusade becomes increasingly reckless
and vengeful over time as he sets out on

139
00:08:00,651 --> 00:08:04,310
a personal mission to find and kill the
people responsible for killing his

140
00:08:04,311 --> 00:08:08,620
fellow soldiers and Iraqi family does.
Transformation can be seen in seals

141
00:08:08,630 --> 00:08:10,510
adopting to punish her logo.
Hey,

142
00:08:10,580 --> 00:08:13,010
marvel,
anti hero who will do anything to get

143
00:08:13,011 --> 00:08:15,380
revenge against the people who killed
his family,

144
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:19,280
but it's also noticeable in cals
behavior at home where he's now

145
00:08:19,281 --> 00:08:22,240
completely disconnected from his family
leading to tie,

146
00:08:22,310 --> 00:08:23,480
giving him an ultimatum.

147
00:08:23,810 --> 00:08:28,810
If you leave again,
the puppy here when you get back,

148
00:08:29,350 --> 00:08:33,160
not only does cal's plan and obsession
almost destroy what he holds most dear.

149
00:08:33,161 --> 00:08:35,800
It also comes at a cost of two of his
friends,

150
00:08:36,130 --> 00:08:39,730
one of them whose best friend Mark Lee.
It would be preacher turned.

151
00:08:39,731 --> 00:08:43,380
Soldier was slowly becoming
disillusioned by the war and Carl's

152
00:08:43,381 --> 00:08:45,970
dogmatic interpretation of God's blend
for glory.

153
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:49,060
This is shown through to strongly worded
anti war letter.

154
00:08:49,061 --> 00:08:50,740
He leaves behind my question.
Yeah,

155
00:08:51,470 --> 00:08:54,910
it's one that's glory fade away and
become a rock look.

156
00:08:55,690 --> 00:08:58,440
Oh,
and then just to tie it means by which

157
00:08:58,740 --> 00:09:01,860
consumes what completely.

158
00:09:02,690 --> 00:09:06,740
It's a message of the glorification that
only really hits cow when he's finally

159
00:09:06,741 --> 00:09:10,310
got the chance to take up.
Mustafa you sear in sniper that started

160
00:09:10,311 --> 00:09:12,800
his crusade against orders to stand
down.

161
00:09:12,801 --> 00:09:16,820
Chris chooses to pull the trigger
instead to protect his fellow soldiers,

162
00:09:16,821 --> 00:09:21,821
to show his no quitter mentality and
most of all to finally find catharsis in

163
00:09:22,041 --> 00:09:25,760
his crusade or Ms Bland for glory.
As we staff our false.

164
00:09:25,761 --> 00:09:27,890
However,
there's no great celebration.

165
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:30,830
No Real Catharsis for Chris as his
friends speaks.

166
00:09:30,831 --> 00:09:32,870
Two words,
mission accomplished,

167
00:09:33,140 --> 00:09:37,160
perhaps referring to George W.
Bush infamous speech after the initial

168
00:09:37,161 --> 00:09:39,260
vision of Iraq had ended.
Of course,

169
00:09:39,290 --> 00:09:41,240
the war was far from over.
At that point,

170
00:09:41,270 --> 00:09:44,170
there was no real nuance spot out plan
for postwar,

171
00:09:44,210 --> 00:09:47,150
our rack giving,
but the false sense of catharsis.

172
00:09:47,540 --> 00:09:50,060
Something similar happens after kyle
takes that shot.

173
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:53,490
Their position now exposed,
Kyle's team is quickly surrounded by and

174
00:09:53,491 --> 00:09:57,350
surgeons as they face certain death,
you realize is that his crusade will

175
00:09:57,351 --> 00:09:59,870
ultimately be the end of him and his
family.

176
00:09:59,930 --> 00:10:02,270
As he finally decides it's time to go
home.

177
00:10:02,370 --> 00:10:03,203
Oh,
I'm ready.

178
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:06,150
I'm ready to go home.

179
00:10:06,790 --> 00:10:09,670
By sheer luck,
the team manages to escape then surgeons

180
00:10:09,671 --> 00:10:13,390
for sand storm.
A perfect metaphor for the fog of war,

181
00:10:13,420 --> 00:10:17,350
perhaps signifying Chris struggling with
his internal moral consciousness,

182
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:22,540
his struggle between family and war,
and it's here where he visually quits on

183
00:10:22,541 --> 00:10:26,500
both the war and dogmatism of his
father's upbringing by leaving his rifle

184
00:10:26,501 --> 00:10:28,030
in the dirt.
However,

185
00:10:28,031 --> 00:10:30,880
even after having,
via aligned with his family and taking

186
00:10:30,881 --> 00:10:35,140
up a healthier sheepdog role by helping
disabled and traumatized veterans deal

187
00:10:35,141 --> 00:10:37,350
with their experiences,
Chris too,

188
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:39,790
we would ultimately become a victim of
the war.

189
00:10:40,570 --> 00:10:44,980
So I would argue that far from being a
pro war pro neoconservative propaganda

190
00:10:44,981 --> 00:10:47,560
movie,
American sniper can much more accurately

191
00:10:47,561 --> 00:10:50,380
be described as an anti war movie.
The pay thing.

192
00:10:50,381 --> 00:10:54,100
It's destructive nature towards family,
whether it'd be to cal family,

193
00:10:54,101 --> 00:10:56,850
to navy seal brotherhood,
or even the family.

194
00:10:56,851 --> 00:10:57,790
You'll rival sniper.

195
00:10:57,790 --> 00:11:02,590
Mustafa more always in fates the home
and corrupts and destroys it from event

196
00:11:03,190 --> 00:11:05,860
director Clint Eastwood made a film
condemning the war,

197
00:11:05,861 --> 00:11:08,800
not the warrior,
and criticizing the neoconservative

198
00:11:08,801 --> 00:11:12,280
Baltic step resorted to it.
American sniper is not a direct

199
00:11:12,281 --> 00:11:15,190
adaptation of Chris Gal's life and it
isn't meant to be.

200
00:11:15,670 --> 00:11:19,930
These would seem serve roughly adapted a
story to make you broader statement to

201
00:11:19,931 --> 00:11:23,170
make a film that respects and puts
emphasis on its veterans.

202
00:11:23,590 --> 00:11:27,370
One that helps us understand their
experience and one that asks us not to

203
00:11:27,371 --> 00:11:30,610
forget their struggle in the words of
Bradley Cooper,

204
00:11:30,820 --> 00:11:34,060
for me and for Clinton,
this movie was always a character study

205
00:11:34,061 --> 00:11:37,480
about what the plate is for a soldier.
If it's not this movie,

206
00:11:37,481 --> 00:11:41,350
I hope to God another move he will come
out where it will shed light on the fact

207
00:11:41,351 --> 00:11:45,070
of what service men and women have to go
through and that we need to pay

208
00:11:45,071 --> 00:11:47,860
attention to her.
Yvette's it doesn't go any further than

209
00:11:47,861 --> 00:11:50,050
that.
It's not a political discussion about

210
00:11:50,051 --> 00:11:53,260
war even.
It's a discussion about the reality and

211
00:11:53,261 --> 00:11:55,420
the reality is that people were coming
home.

212
00:11:55,810 --> 00:11:57,070
We have to take care of them.

213
00:12:05,870 --> 00:12:08,060
All right.
Thank you all so much for watching and

214
00:12:08,090 --> 00:12:10,340
seeing how much hate American sniper
received.

215
00:12:10,341 --> 00:12:12,200
They just had to express my views of the
movie.

216
00:12:12,201 --> 00:12:12,830
So,
um,

217
00:12:12,830 --> 00:12:14,960
I hope this,
this video clear things up a little bit.

218
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:17,390
Uh,
I want to thank Danielle Key Mirman for

219
00:12:17,391 --> 00:12:20,240
his thesis on partisan reception of
American sniper,

220
00:12:20,270 --> 00:12:22,280
which was a big influence for this
video,

221
00:12:22,610 --> 00:12:25,550
uh,
Dell's extensively into how and why

222
00:12:25,551 --> 00:12:29,120
political audiences came to such a
widely different interpretation of the

223
00:12:29,121 --> 00:12:30,470
film.
Lastly,

224
00:12:30,471 --> 00:12:33,140
if you want to help us out and sustain
this channel,

225
00:12:33,170 --> 00:12:36,440
hop on over to Patriot or a paypal a
while you can leave as a dollar.

226
00:12:37,010 --> 00:12:39,110
Anyways,
thank you all again for watching happy

227
00:12:39,111 --> 00:12:42,800
4th of July to our American viewers and
I hope to see you all the next one.
